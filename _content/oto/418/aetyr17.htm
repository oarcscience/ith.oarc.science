<p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 17th Aethyr,<br>
  Which is Called TAN</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
<p>Into the stone there first cometh the head of a dragon, and then the Angel 
  Madimi<a href="#2"><font
        size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. She is not the mere elemental 
  that one would suppose from the account of Casaubon. I enquire why her form 
  is different. </p>
<p>She says: Since all things are God, in all things thou seest just so much of 
  God as thy capacity affordeth thee<a
        href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. But behold! Thou 
  must pierce deeply into this Aethyr before true images appear<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
  For TAN is that which transformeth judgment into justice<a
        href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. BAL is the sword, 
  and TAN the balances<a href="#6"><font
        size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>A pair of balances appears in the stone, and on the bar of the balance is written: 
  Motion about a point is iniquity<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>And behind the balances is a plume, luminous, azure<a
        href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. And somehow connected 
  with the plume, but I cannot divine how, are these words: Breath is iniquity<a href="#9"><font
        size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. (That is, any wind must stir the 
  feather of truth.) </p>
<p>And behind the plume is a shining filament of quartz, suspended vertically 
  from the abyss to the abyss<a
        href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. And in the midst 
  is a winged disk<a href="#11"><font
        size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a> of some extremely delicate, translucent 
  substance, on which is written in the &quot;dagger&quot; alphabet: Torsion is 
  iniquity<a
        href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. (This means, 
  that the Rashith Ha-Gilgalim is the first appearance of evil.<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>) 
</p>
<p>And now an Angel appears, like as he were carven in black diamonds. And he 
  cries: Woe unto the Second, whom all nations of men call the First<a href="#14"><font
        size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. Woe unto the First, whom all 
  grades of Adepts call the First<a
        href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. Woe unto me, 
  for I, even as they, have worshipped him. But she is whose paps are the galaxies<a href="#16"><font
        size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>, and he that never shall be known<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>, 
  in them is no motion. For the infinite Without filleth all and moveth not<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>, 
  and the infinite Within goeth indeed<a href="#19"><font
        size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>; but it is no odds, else were 
  the space-marks confounded<a href="#20"><font
        size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>And now the Angel is but a shining speck of blackness in the midst of a tremendous 
  sphere of liquid and vibrating light, at first gold, then becoming green, and 
  lastly pure blue<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. 
  And I see that the green of Libra is made up of the yellow of air and the blue 
  of water, swords and cups, judgment and mercy<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. 
  And this word TAN meaneth mercy<a href="#23"><font
        size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. And the feather of Maat is blue 
  because the truth of justice is mercy<a
        href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. And a voice 
  cometh, as it were the music of the ripples of the surface of the sphere: Truth 
  is delight <a
        href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. (This means 
  that the Truth of the universe is delight.) </p>
<p>Another voice cometh; it is the voice of a mighty Angel, all in silver; the 
  scales of his armour and the plumes of his wings are like mother-of-pearl in 
  a framework of silver<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>. 
  And he sayeth: Justice is the equity that ye have made for yourselves between 
  truth and falsehood. But in Truth there is nothing of this, for there is only 
  Truth. Your falsehood is but a little falser than your truth<a
        href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>. Yet by your 
  truth shall ye come to Truth. Your truth is your troth with Adonai the Beloved 
  one<a href="#28"><font
        size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. And the Chymical Marriage of 
  the Alchemists beginneth with a Weighing, and he that is not found wanting hath 
  within him one spark of fire, so dense and so intense that it cannot be moved, 
  through all the winds of heaven should clamour against it, and all the waters 
  of the abyss surge against it, and all the multitude of the earths heap themselves 
  upon it to smother it. Nay, it shall not be moved<a href="#29"><font
        size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>And this is the fire of which it is written: &quot;Hear thou the voice of fire!&quot; 
  And the voice of fire is in the second chapter of <em>The Book of the Law</em><a
        href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>, that is revealed 
  unto him that is a score and half a score and three that are scores, and six, 
  by Aiwass, that is his guardian, the mighty Angel that extendeth from the first 
  unto the last, and maketh known the mysteries that are beyond. And the method 
  and the form of invocation whereby a man shall attain to the knowledge and conversation 
  of his Holy Guardian Angel shall be given unto thee in the proper place<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a>, 
  and seeing that the word is deadlier than lightning, do thou meditate straitly 
  thereupon, solitary, in a place where is no living thing visible, but only the 
  light of the sun. And thy head shall be bare<a href="#32"><font
        size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a>. Thus mayest thou become fitted 
  to receive this, the holiest of the Mysteries. And it is the holiest of the 
  Mysteries because it is the Next Step. And those Mysteries which lie beyond, 
  though they be holier, are not holy unto thee, but only remote. (The sense of 
  this passage seems to be, that the holiness of a thing implies its personal 
  relation with one, just as one cannot blaspheme an unknown god, because one 
  does not know what to say to annoy him. And this explains the perfect inefficiency 
  of those who try to insult the saints; the most violent attacks are very often 
  merely clumsy compliments.) </p>
<p>Now the Angel is spread completely over the globe, a dewy film of silver upon 
  that luminous blue. </p>
<p>And a great voice cries: Behold the Queen of Heaven, how she hath woven her 
  robes from the loom of justice<a
        href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a>. For as that 
  straight path of the Arrow cleaving the Rainbow became righteousness in her 
  that sitteth in the hall of double truth<a href="#34"><font size="1"><strong>34</strong></font></a>, 
  so at last is she exalted unto the throne of the High Priestess, the Priestess 
  of the Silver Star, wherein also is thine Angel made manifest<a href="#35"><font size="1"><strong>35</strong></font></a>. 
  And this is the mystery of the camel that is ten days in the desert, and is 
  not athirst, because he hath within him that water which is the dew distilled 
  from the the night of Nuit<a href="#36"><font size="1"><strong>36</strong></font></a>. 
  Triple is the cord of silver, that it may be not loosed; and three score and 
  half a score and three is the number of the name of my name<a href="#37"><font size="1"><strong>37</strong></font></a>, 
  for that the ineffable wisdom, that also is of the sphere of the stars, informeth 
  me<a href="#38"><font size="1"><strong>38</strong></font></a>. Thus am I crowned 
  with the triangle that is about the eye, and therefore is my number three<a href="#39"><font
        size="1"><strong>39</strong></font></a>. And in me there is no imperfection, 
  because through me descendeth the influence of TARO<a href="#40"><font size="1"><strong>40</strong></font></a>. 
  And that is also the number of Aiwass the mighty Angel, the Minister of Silence. 
</p>
<p>And even as the shew-stone burneth thy forehead with its intolerable flame, 
  so he who hath known me, though but from afar, is marked out and chosen among 
  men, and he shall never turn back or turn aside, for he hath made the link that 
  is not to be broken, nay, not by the malice of the Four Great Princes of evil 
  of the world, nor by Chorozon, that mighty Devil, nor by the wrath of God, nor 
  by the affliction and feebleness of the soul. </p>
<p>Yet with this assurance be not thou content; for though thou hast the wings 
  of the Eagle, they are vain, except they be joined to the shoulders of the Bull. 
  Now, therefore, I send forth a shaft of my light, even as a ladder let down 
  from the heaven upon the earth, and by this black cross of Themis that I hold 
  before thine eyes, do I swear unto thee that the path shall be open henceforth 
  for evermore. </p>
<p>There is a clash of a myriad silver cymbals, and silence. And then three times 
  a note is struck upon a bell, which sounds like my holy Tibetan bell, that is 
  made of electrum magicum<a href="#41"><font size="1"><strong>41</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>I am happily returned unto the earth. </p>

  <li><a name="5"></a><font size="2">Judgment --- the unmitigated feminine, the 
    severity of sterility. Justice --- she is satisfied by the sword (phallus) 
    and balances (testes) as shown in Atu XIII. The symbolism of the letter Lamed 
    must be very thoroughly studied. It represents the flux of the universe in 
    extension. Contrast this positive equilibrium with the negative, Aleph. The 
    two together form AL (the title of <em>The Book of the Law</em> ) which expresses 
    the universe in its phases, 0 and 2.</font></li>

  <li><a name="14"></a><font size="2">The Demiurgos, Microprosopus, the Black 
    Reflected Countenance, the Creator. He must be distinguished from the Logos. 
    The difference is that the Demiurge creates on his own account; he is not 
    like the Logos, the transmitter of Energy of Kether, and its formulation in 
    a Word.</font></li>
  <li><a name="15"></a><font size="2">Macroposopus himself. For in the ontology 
    of the New Aeon, he is no longer the unique and supreme Point-of-View, to

    are joined by the reciprocating path of Leo. This is Atu IX {WEH Note: SIC.

    of the Sun, life itself, is one with Libra, justice; for the letter Lamed 
    signifies the Universe in extension.</font></li>
  <li><a name="23"></a><font size="2">TAN is given in above as meaning the Balances. 
    Thus, as shown in the previous note, the truth of Justice is Mercy. Hence, 
    to aim at Mercy, which is an idea without measure, and therefore incommensurable 
    with Truth, is to invoke Justice. The injunction is: Be strictly just, and 
    you will find that you have accomplished the true Work of Love. </font></li>
  <li><a name="24"></a><font size="2">See previous note. The blue is again that 
    of Nuit. Justice is only complete when the disturbance of positive existence 
    is annulled by absorption into the Body of Our Lady of the Stars.</font></li>

    Atu II. See infra. </font></li>
  <li><a name="27"></a><font size="2">Human justice is a compromise intended to 
    meet an admittedly false situation. Cf. Lao-tse: Benevolence and righteousness 
    only appear when all naturalness is gone.</font></li>
  <li><a name="28"></a><font size="2">Hence the justice of making the Attainment 
    of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is the next step. 
    The original evil is the separation from Him; so the only approximation to 
    truth is one's oath to Him.</font></li>
  <li><a name="29"></a><font size="2">This spark is Hadit; (hence the reference 
    to <em>Lib. AL</em>, II) he cannot be moved because he is already in motion 
    at the limit of velocity.</font></li>
  <li><a name="30"></a><font size="2">The Oracle of Zoroaster says: &quot;And 
    when, after all the phantoms are vanished shall appear that holy and formless 
    fire, that fire which darts and flashes throughout the depths of the universe 
    --- hear thou the voice of the fire!&quot; And this is the utterance of Hadit, 
    the deepest expression of one's inmost point of view.</font></li>
  <li><a name="31"></a><font size="2">See 8th Aire. </font></li>
  <li><a name="32"></a><font size="2">This I performed in a sort of cave upon 
    the ridge of a great mountain in the Desert near Bou-Sada at 12-3 p.m. on

  <li><a name="33"></a><font size="2">This blue and silver of Luna, the &quot;queen 
    of heaven&quot; (in King and Queen scales) are said to be derived from the 
    justice in her true nature. This justice refers to her point on the Tree; 
    the troth with Adonai.</font></li>
  <li><a name="34"></a><font size="2">The arrow = Sagittarius = blue. Its ruler 
    = Jupiter = blue (Queen scale) = Righteousness. The plumes of Maat, are blue.</font></li>

    of ascending vibration. {HEB:Samekh} = {Sagittarius}, {HEB:Lamed} = {Libra},

    of Logos. We shall see later an important doctrine drawn from this special 
    association of these three letters. The Holy Guardian Angel appears as {HEB:Gemel} 
    because of its position on the Tree.</font></li>

    the Seer thought that Aiwass was spelled {HEB:Samekh} {HEB:Aleph} {HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Aleph} 
    = 78 {WEH Note: TS has &quot;418&quot;}, Whereas, as he found later, {HEB:Zain}{HEB:Vau}
