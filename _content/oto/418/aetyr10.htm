        size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a><font size="6"><strong>.</strong></font></p>
<p align="center">This Aethyr being accursèd, and the seer forewarned, he taketh 
  these precautions for the scribe. </p>
<p align="left">First let the scribe be seated in the centre of the circle in 
  the desert sand, and let the circle be fortified by the Holy Names of God --- 
  Tetragrammaton and Shaddai El Chai and Ararita. </p>
<p>And let the Demon be invoked within a triangle, wherein is inscribed the name 
  of Choronzon, and about it let him write ANAPHAXETON --- ANAPHANETON -- PRIMEUMATON, 
  and in the angles MI-CA-EL<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>: 
  and at each angle the Seer shall slay a pigeon<a
        href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>, and having done 
  this, let him retire to a secret place, where is neither sight nor hearing, 
  and sit within his black robe, secretly invoking the Aethyr<a href="#6"><font
        size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. And let the Scribe perform the 
  Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>, 
  and let him call upon the Holy Names of God, and say the Exorcism of Honorius<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>, 
  and let him beseech protection and help of the Most High. </p>
<p>And let him be furnished with the Magick Dagger<a
        href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>, and let him strike 
  fearlessly at anything that may seek to break through the circle, were it the 
  appearance of the Seer himself. And if the Demon pass out of the triangle, let 
  him threaten him with the Dagger, and command him to return. And let him beware 
  lest he himself lean beyond the circle. And since he reverenceth the Person 
  of the Seer as his Teacher, let the Seer bind him with a great Oath to do this. 
</p>
<p>Now, then, the Seer being entered within the triangle, let him take the Victims 
  and cut their throats, pouring the blood within the Triangle, and being most 
  heedful that not one drop fall without the Triangle; or else Choronzon should 
  be able to manifest in the universe. </p>
<p>And when the sand hath sucked up the blood of the victims, let him recite the 
  Call of the Aethyr apart secretly as aforesaid. Then will the Vision be revealed, 
  and the Voice heard. </p>
<p align="center"><em>The Oath</em> </p>
<p>I, Omnia Vincam, a Probationer of A{.·.} A{.·.}, hereby solemnly promise upon 
  my magical honour, and swear by Adonai the angel that guardeth me, that I will 
  defend this magic circle of Art with thoughts and words and deeds. I promise 
  to threaten with the Dagger and command back into the triangle the spirit incontinent, 
  if he should strive to escape from it; and to strike with a Dagger at anything 
  that may seek to enter this Circle, were it in appearance the body of the Seer 
  himself. And I will be exceeding wary, armed against force and cunning; and 
  I will preserve with my life the inviolability of this Circle, Amen. </p>
<p>And I summon mine Holy Guardian Angel to witness this mine oath, the which 
  if I break, may I perish, forsaken of Him. Amen and Amen.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 10th Aethyr,<br>
  Which is Called ZAX</strong> </font></p>
<p>There is no being in the outermost Abyss, but constant forms come forth from 
  the nothingness of it<a href="#10"><font
        size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>Then the Devil of the Aethyr, that mighty devil Choronzon, crieth aloud, Zazaz<a href="#11"><font
        size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>, Zazas, Nasatanada Zasas. </p>
<p>I am the Master of Form<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>, 
  and from me all forms proceed.</p>
<p>I am I. I have shut myself up from the spendthrifts, my gold is safe in my 
  treasure-chamber, and I have made every living thing my concubine, and none 
  shall touch them, save only I. And yet I am scorched, even while I shiver in 
  the wind. He hateth me and tormenteth me. He would have stolen me from myself, 
  but I shut myself up and mock at him, even while he plagueth me. From me come 
  leprosy and pox and plague and cancer and cholera and the falling sickness. 
  Ah! I will reach up to the knees of the Most High, and tear his phallus with 
  my teeth, and I will bray his testicles in a mortar, and make poison thereof, 
  to slay the sons of men<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>(Here the Spirit stimulated the voice of Frater P., which also appeared to 
  come from his station and not from the triangle.) </p>
<p>I don't think I can get any more; I think that's all there is. </p>
<p>(The Frater was seated in a secret place covered completely by a black robe<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>, 
  in the position called the &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;. He did not move or speak 
  during the ceremony.) </p>
<p>Next the Scribe was hallucinated, believing that before him was a beautiful 
  courtesan whom previously he had loved in Paris. Now, she wooed him with soft 
  words and glances, but he knew these things for delusions of the devil, and 
  he would not leave the circle. </p>
<p>The demon then laughed wildly and loud. </p>
<p>(Upon the Scribe threatening him, the Demon proceeded, after a short delay.) 
</p>
<p>They have called me the God of laughter, and I laugh when I will slay. And 
  they have thought that I could not smile, but I smile upon whom I would seduce. 
  O inviolable one, that canst not not be tempted<a href="#15"><font
        size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. If thou canst command me by the 
  power of the Most High, know that I did indeed tempt thee, and it repenteth 
  me. I bow myself humbly before the great and terrible names whereby thou hast 
  conjured and constrained me. But thy name is mercy, and I cry aloud for pardon. 
  Let me come and put my head beneath thy feet, that I may serve thee. For if 
  thou commandest me to obedience in the Holy names, I cannot swerve therefrom, 
  for their first whispering is greater than the noise of all my temptests. Bid 
  me therefore come unto thee upon my hands and knees that I may adore thee, and 
  partake of thy forgiveness. Is not thy mercy infinite? </p>
<p>(Here Choronzon attempts to seduce the Scribe by appealing to his pride. </p>
<p>But the Scribe refused to be tempted, and commanded the demon to continue with 
  the Aethyr. </p>
<p>There was again a short delay.) </p>
<p>Choronzon hath no form, because he is the maker of all form; and so rapidly 
  he changeth from one to the other as he may best think fit to seduce those whom 
  he hateth, the servants of the Most High. </p>
<p>Thus taketh he the form of a beautiful woman, or of a wise and holy man, or 
  of a serpent that writheth upon the earth ready to sting<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>And, because he is himself, therefore he is no self; the terror of darkness, 
  and the blindness of night, and the deafness of the adder, and the tastelessness 
  of stale and stagnant water, and the black fire of hatred, and the udders of 
  the Cat of slime; not one thing, but many things. Yet, with all that, his torment 
  is eternal. The sun burns him as he writhes naked upon the sands of hell, and 
  the wind cuts him bitterly to the bone, a harsh dry wind, so that he is sore 
  athirst. Give unto me, I pray thee, one drop of water from the pure springs 
  of Paradise, that I may quench my thirst. </p>
<p>(The Scribe refused.) </p>
<p>Sprinkle water upon my head. I can hardly go on<a
        href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>(This last was spoken from the triangle in the natural voice of the Frater, 
  which Choronzon again simulated. But he did not succeed in taking the Frater's 
  form --- which was absurd! </p>
<p>The Scribe resisted the appeal to his pity, and conjured the demon to proceed 
  by the names of the Most High. Choronzon attempted also to seduce the faithfulness 
  of the Scribe. A long colloquy ensued. The Scribe cursed him by the Holy Names 
  of God, and the power of the Pentagram.<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>) 
</p>
<p>I feed upon the names of the Most High. I churn them in my jaws, and I void 
  them from my fundament. I fear not the power of the Pentagram, for I am the 
  Master of the Triangle. My name is three hundred and thirty and three, and that 
  is thrice one<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. Be 
  vigilant, therefore, for I warn thee that I am about to deceive thee. I shall 
  say words that thou wilt take to be the cry of the Aethyr, and thou wilt write 
  them down, thinking them to be great secrets of Magick power, and they will 
  be only my jesting with thee. </p>
<p>(Here the Scribe invoked the Angels, and the Holy Guardian Angel of the Frater 
  P. . . . The demon replied:) </p>
<p>I know the name of the Angel of thee and thy brother P. . . ., and all thy 
  dealings with him are but a cloak for thy filthy sorceries. </p>
<p>(Here the Scribe averred that he knew more than the demon, and so feared him 
  not, and ordered the demon to proceed.) </p>
<p>Thou canst tell me naught that I know not, for in me is all Knowledge: Knowledge 
  is my name. Is not the head of the great Serpent arisen into Knowledge<a href="#19"><font
        size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>?</p>
<p>(Here the Scribe again commanded Choronzon to continue with the call.) </p>
<p>Know thou that there is no Cry in the tenth Aethyr like unto the other Cries, 
  for Choronzon is Dispersion, and cannot fix his mind upon any one thing for 
  any length of time. Thou canst master him in argument, O talkative one; thou 
  wast commanded, wast thou not, to talk to Choronzon? He sought not to enter 
  the circle, or to leave the triangle, yet thou didst prate of all these things. 
</p>
<p>(Here the Scribe threatened the demon with anger and pain and hell. The demon 
  replied:) </p>
<p>Thinkest thou, O fool, that there is any anger and any pain that I am not, 
  or any hell but this my spirit? Images, images, images, all without control, 
  all without reason. The malice of Choronzon is not the malice of a being; it 
  is the quality of malice, because he that boasteth himself &quot;I am I&quot;, 
  hath in truth no self, and these are they that are fallen under my power, the 
  slaves of the Blind One that boasted himself to be the Enlightened One. For 
  there is no centre, nay, nothing but Dispersion. </p>
<p>Woe, woe, woe, threefold to him that is led away by talk, O talkative One. 
</p>
<p>O thou that hast written two-and-thirty books of Wisdom, and art more stupid 
  than an owl, by thine own talk is thy vigilance wearied, and by my talk art 
  thou befooled and tricked, O thou that sayest that thou shalt endure. Knowest 
  thou how nigh thou art to destruction? For thou that art the Scribe hast not 
  the understanding<a
        href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a> that alone availeth 
  against Choronzon. And wert thou not protected by the Holy Names of God and 
  the circle, I would rush upon thee and tear thee. For when I made myself like 
  unto a beautiful woman, if thou hadst come to me, I would have rotted thy body 
  with the pox, and thy liver with cancer, and I would have torn off thy testicles 
  with my teeth. And if I had seduced thy pride, and thou hadst bidden me to come 
  into the circle, I would have trampled thee under foot, and for a thousand years 
  shouldst thou have been but one of the tape-worms that is in me. And if I had 
  seduced thy pity, and thou hadst poured one drop of water without the circle, 
  then would I have blasted thee with flame. But I was not able to prevail against 
  thee. </p>
<p>How beautiful are the shadows of the ripples of the sand! </p>
<p>Would God that I were dead. </p>
<p>For know that I am proud and revengeful and lascivious, and I prate even as 
  thou. For even as I walked among the Sons of God, I heard it said that P. . 
  . . could both will and know, and might learn at length to dare, but that to 
  keep silence he should never learn. O thou that art so ready to speak, so slow 
  to watch, thou art delivered over unto my power for this. And now one word was 
  necessary unto me, and I could not speak it. I behold the beauty of the earth 
  in her desolation, and greater far is mine, who sought to be my naked self. 
  Knowest thou that in my soul is utmost fear? And such is my force and my cunning, 
  that a hundred times have I been ready to leap, and for fear have missed. And 
  a thousand times am I baulked by them of the City of the Pyramids, that set 
  snares for my feet. More knowledge have I than the Most High, but my will is 
  broken, and my fierceness is marred by fear, and I must speak, speak, speak, 
  millions of mad voices in my brain. </p>
<p>With a heart of furious fancies, Whereof I am Commander, With a burning spear 
  And a horse of Air To the wilderness I wander. </p>
<p>(The idea was to keep the Scribe busy writing, so as to spring upon him. For, 
  while the Scribe talked, Choronzon had thrown sand into the circle, and filled 
  it up. But Choronzon could not think fast and continuously, and so resorted 
  to the device of quotation. </p>
<p>The Scribe had written two or three words of &quot;Tom o'Bedlam,&quot; when 
  Choronzon sprang within the circle (that part of the circumference of which 
  that was nearest to him he had been filling up with sand all this time), and 
  leaped upon the Scribe, throwing him to the earth. The conflict took place within 
  the circle. The Scribe called upon Tetragrammaton, and succeeded in compelling 
  Choronzon to return into his triangle. By dint of anger and of threatening him 
  with the Magick Staff did he accomplish this. He then repaired the circle. The 
  discomfited demon now continued:) </p>
<p>All is dispersion. These are the qualities of things. </p>
<p>The tenth Aethyr is the world of adjectives, and there is no substance therein. 
</p>
<p>(Now returneth the beautiful woman who had before tempted the Scribe. She prevailed 
  not.) </p>
<p>I am afraid of sunset, for Tum is more terrible than Ra, and Khephra the Beetle 
  is greater than the Lion Mau. </p>
<p>I am a-cold. </p>
<p>(Here Choronzon wanted to leave the triangle to obtain wherewith to cover his 
  nakedness. The Scribe refused the request, threatening the demon. After a while 
  the latter continued:) </p>
<p>I am commanded, why I know not, by him that speaketh. Were it thou, thou little 
  fool, I would tear thee limb from limb. I would bite off thine ears and nose 
  before I began with thee. I would take thy guts for fiddle- strings at the Black 
  Sabbath. </p>
<p>Thou didst make a great fight there in the circle; thou art a goodly warrior! 
</p>
<p>(Then did the demon laugh loudly. The Scribe said: Thou canst not harm one 
  hair of my head.) </p>
<p>I will pull out every hair of thy head, every hair of thy body, every hair 
  of thy soul, one by one. (Then said the Scribe: Thou hast no power.)</p>
<p>Yea, verily I have power over thee, for thou hast taken the Oath, and art bound 
  unto the White Brothers, and therefore have I the power to torture thee so long 
  as thou shalt be. </p>
<p>(Then said the Scribe unto him: Thou liest.) </p>
<p>Ask of thy brother P. . . ., and he shall tell thee if I lie! </p>
<p>(This the Scribe refused to do, saying that it was no concern of the demon's.) 
</p>
<p>I have prevailed against the Kingdom of the Father, and befouled his beard; 
  and I have prevailed against the Kingdom of the Son, and torn off his Phallus; 
  but against the Kingdom of the Holy Ghost shall I strive and not prevail. The 
  three slain doves are my threefold blasphemy against him; but their blood shall 
  make fertile the sand<a
        href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>, and I writhe 
  in blackness and horror of hate, and prevail not. </p>
<p>(Then the demon tried to make the Scribe laugh at Magick, and to think that 
  it was all rubbish, that he might deny the names of God that he had invoked 
  to protect him; which, if he had doubted but for an instant, he had leapt upon 
  him, and gnawed through his spine at the neck. </p>
<p>Choronzon succeed not in his design.) </p>
<p>In this Aethyr is neither beginning nor end, for it is all hotch- potch, because 
  it is of the wicked on earth and the damned in hell. And so long as it be hotch-potch, 
  it mattereth little what may be written by the sea-green incorruptible Scribe. 
</p>
<p>The horror of it will be given in another place and time, and through another 
  Seer, and that Seer shall be slain as a result of his revealing. But the present 
  Seer, who is not P. . . ., seeth not the horror, because he is shut up, and 
  hath no name. </p>
<p>(Now was there some further parleying betwixt the demon and the Scribe, concerning 
  the departure and the writing of the word, the Scribe not knowing if it were 
  meet that the demon should depart. </p>
<p>Then the Seer took the Holy Ring, and wrote the name BABALON, that is victory 
  over Choronzon, and he was no more manifest.) </p>
<p>(This cry was obtained on Dec. 6, 1909, between 2 and 4:15 p.m., in a lonely 
  valley of fine sand, in the desert near Bou-Sada. The Aethyr was edited and 
  revised on the following day.) </p>
<p>After the conclusion of the Ceremony, a great fire was kindled to purify the 
  place, and the Circle and Triangle were destroyed. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE BY SCRIBE</strong></p>
<p>Almost from the beginning of the ceremony was the Scribe overshadowed, and 
  he spoke as it were in spite of himself, remembering afterwards scarcely a word 
  of his speeches, some of which were long and seemingly eloquent. </p>
<p>All the time he had a sense of being protected from Choronzon, and this sense 
  of security prevented his knowing fear. </p>
<p>Several times did the Scribe threaten to put a curse upon the demon; but ever, 
  before he uttered the words of the curse, did the demon obey him. For himself, 
  he knoweth not the words of the curse. </p>
<p>Also is it meet to record in this place that the Scribe several times whistled 
  in a Magical manner, which never before had he attempted, and the demon was 
  apparently much discomforted thereat. </p>
<p>Now knoweth the Scribe that he was wrong in holding much converse with the 
  demon; for Choronzon, in the confusion and chaos of his thought, is much terrified 
  by silence. And by silence can he be brought to obey. </p>
<p>For cunningly doth he talk of many things, going from subject to subject, and 
  thus he misleadeth the wary into argument with him. And though Choronzon be 
  easily beaten in argument, yet, by disturbing the attention of him who would 
  command him, doth he gain the victory. </p>
<p>For Choronzon feareth of all things concentration and silence: he therefore 
  who would command him should will in silence: thus is he brought to obey. </p>
<p>This the Scribe knoweth; for that since the obtaining of the Accursed Tenth 
  Aethyr, he hath held converse with Choronzon. And unexpectedly did he obtain 
  the information he sought after having long refused to answer the demon's speeches. 
</p>
<p>Choronzon is dispersion; and such is his fear of concentration that he will 
  obey rather than be subjected to it, or even behold it in another. </p>
<p>The account of the further dealings of Choronzon with the Scribe will be found 
  in the Record of Omnia Vincam. </p>

<ol>
  <li><a name="1"></a><font size="2">Choronzon is described by Sir Edward Kelly 
    as &quot;that mighty devil&quot;, as the first and deadliest of all the powers 
    of evil. Rightly so, for although he is not a person, he is the metaphysical 
    contrary of the whole Process of Magick.</font></li>
  <li><a name="2"></a><font size="2">The three Governors of this Aethyr, Lexarp, 
    Comanan, and Tabiton, are drawn from the &quot;little Black Tablet&quot; of 
    Spirit, which united the four watchtowers of the elements. (See <em>Equinox</em> 
    I, No. VII, Plate III; facing p. 234). The one extra letter, L, is the eighth 
    of the reversed letters beneath the bars of the Calvary Crosses in the watch-towers 
    to form trilateral names which designate malignant forces. These letters are 
    thus impurities introduced into the perfection of the Elementary Schema. (That 
    they should be attributed to the element of spirit, which harmonizes and sanctifies 
    the four, is a sublime mystery. The arcanum is declared --- as far as may 
    be --- in this book 418 itself). The other 7 letters form the name PARAOAN, 
    which is the central governor of the 22nd Aire; but here is a correspondence 
    with I, the center letter of LIN; this Aire discloses the glory of the Table 
    7 x 7, which is pure spirit, the rose which is the heart of Babalon.</font></li>
  <li><a name="3"></a><font size="2">ZAX = {Caput Draconis}{Taurus}{Spirit}. Z 
    is the Sun in His southern declination, i.e. at his weakest effect on an hemisphere. 
    Follows the Bull, the type of the &quot;Dying Gods&quot;, and the element 
    of Earth. This letter X occurs only in this, the 15th and 30th Aires. In the 
    15th, water is the prima materia which is treated by being placed between 
    the pillars of judgement. In the 30th, it represents the reduction to mere 
    matter of the false structure of the Aeon of the false formula. Here X is 
    the basis, without constructive possibilities, of the universe; thus the whole 
    formula represents the weakening of the energy of the Sun, and the falling 
    into incoherent elements of all that is organized. </font></li>

    time, and have since been yet further fortified, to keep silence concerning 
    the rite of evocation. The Major Adept is warned most seriously against attempting 
    to emulate this operation, which is (in any case) improper for him to perform. 
    To call forth Choronzon, unless one be wholly above the Abyss, is to ensure 
    the most appalling and immediate catastrophe.</font></li>

  <li><a name="12"></a><font size="2">This (and many following assertions) must 
    not be taken as true. Choronzon is in no sense the master of anything. It 
    is the personification of a moral idea in a much more far-fetched way than 
    that in which we say &quot;Venus is the Lady of Love&quot;. For one can imagine 
    Venus as a living individual being, while Choronzon is essentially not any

    being, conscious that it is not a true organism, and threatened with immediate 
    dissolution, which in its rudimentary psychology it is bound to dread, is 
    of necessity, fear; and fear breeds pain, malice, and envy. Above all there
