**The Cry of the 19th Aethyr,  
Which is Called POP**[**1**](#1)

At first there is a black web over the face of the stone. A ray of light
pierces it from behind and above. Then cometh a black cross[**2**](#2),
reaching across the whole stone; then a golden cross, not so large. And
there is a writing in an arch that spans the cross, in an alphabet in
which the letters are all formed of little daggers[**3**](#3),
cross-hilted, differently arranged. And the writing is: Worship in the
body the things of the body; worship in the mind the things of the mind;
worship in the spirit the things of the spirit[**4**](#4).

(This holy alphabet must be written by sinners, that is, by those who
are impure.)[**5**](#5)

"Impure" means those whose every thought is followed by another thought,
or who confuse the higher with the lower, the substance with the shadow.
Every Aethyr is truth, though it be but a shadow, for the shadow of a
man is not the shadow of an ape[**6**](#6).

(*Note*. --- All this has come to me without voice, without vision,
without thought.)

(The shew-stone is pressed upon my forehead and causes intense pain; as
I go on from Aethyr to Aethyr, it seems more difficult to open the
Aethyr.

The golden cross has become a little narrow door, and an old man like
the Hermit[**7**](#7) of the Taro has opened it and come out. I ask him
for admission: and he shakes his head kindly, and says: It is not given
to flesh and blood to unveil the mysteries of the Aethyr, for therein
are the chariots of fire[**8**](#8). and the tumult of the horsemen;
whoso entereth here may never look on life again with equal eyes. I
insist.

The little gate is guarded by a great green dragon. And now the whole
wall is suddenly fallen away; there is a blaze of the chariots and the
horsemen; a furious battle is raging. One hears nothing but the clash of
steel and the neighing of the chargers and the shrieks of the wounded. A
thousand fall at every encounter and are trampled under foot. Yet the
Aethyr is always full; there are infinite reserves.

No; that is all wrong, for this is not a battle between two forces, but
a mle in which each warrior fights for himself against all the others. I
cannot see one who has even one ally. And the least fortunate, who fall
soonest, are those in the chariots. For as soon as they are engaged in
fighting, their own charioteers stab them in the back[**9**](#9).

And in the midst of the battlefield there is a great tree, like a
chinar-tree[**10**](#10). Yet it bears fruits. And now all the warriors
are dead, and they are the ripe fruits that are fallen -- the ground is
covered with them.

There is a laugh in my right ear: "This is the tree of
life[**11**](#11)."

And now there is a mighty god, Sebek[**12**](#12), with the head of a
crocodile. His head is gray, like river mud, and his jaws fill the whole
Aire. And he crunches up the whole tree and the ground and everything.

Now then at last cometh forth the Angel of the Aethyr, who is like the
Angel of the fourteenth key of Rota[**13**](#13), with beautiful blue
wings, blue robes, the sun in her girdle like a brooch, and the two
crescents of the moon shapen into sandals for her feet. Her hair is of
flowing gold, each sparkle as a star. In her hands are the torch of
Penelope and the cup of Circe[**14**](#14).

She comes and kisses me on the mouth[**15**](#15), and says: Blessed art
thou who hast beheld Sebek my Lord in his glory. Many are the champions
of life, but all are unhorsed by the lance of death. Many are the
children of the light, but their eyes shall all be put out by the Mother
Darkness. Many are the servants of love, but love (that is not quenched
by aught but love) shall be put out, as the child taketh the wick of a
taper between his thumb and finger, by the god that sitteth
alone[**16**](#16).

And on her mouth, like a chrysanthemum of radiant light, is a kiss, and
on it is the monogram I.H.S. The letters I.H.S. mean In Homini Salus and
Instar Hominis Summus, and Imago Hominis deuS. And there are many, many
other meanings, but they all imply this one thing; that nothing is of
any importance but man; there is no hope or help but in
man[**17**](#17).

And she says: Sweet are my kisses, O wayfarer that wanderest from star
to star. Sweet are my kisses, O householder that weariest within four
walls. Thou art pent within thy brain, and my shaft pierceth it, and
thou art free. Thine imagination eateth up the universe as the dragon
that eateth up the moon. And in my shaft is it concentrated and bound
up. See how all around thee gather my warriors, strong knights in goodly
armour ready for war. Look upon my crown; it is above the stars. Behold
the glow and the blush thereof! Upon thy cheek is the breeze that stirs
those plumes of truth. For though I am the Angel of the fourteenth key,
I am also the Angel of the eighth key[**18**](#18). And from the love of
these two have I come, who am the warden of Pop and the servant of them
that dwell therein. Though all crowns fall, mine shall not fall; for my
plumes reach up unto the Knees of Him that sitteth upon the holy throne,
and liveth and reigneth for ever and ever as the balance of
righteousness and truth. I am the Angel of the moon. I am the veiled one
that sitteth between the pillars veiled with a shining veil, and on my
lap is the open Book of the mysteries of the ineffable
light[**19**](#19). I am the aspiration unto the higher; I am the love
of the unknown. I am the blind ache within the heart of man. I am the
minister of the sacrament of pain. I swing the censer of worship, and I
sprinkle the waters of purification. I am the daughter of the house of
the invisible. I am the Priestess of the Silver Star[**20**](#20).

And she catches me up to her as a mother catches her babe, and holds me
up in her left arm, and sets my lips to her breast[**21**](#21). And
upon her breast is written: *Rosa Mundi est Lilium Coeli*[**22**](#22)
squares in the midst. It radiates a blaze of light, too dazzling to make
out the characters, and a voice says: *Non haec piscis
omnium*[**23**](#23).

(To interpret that, we must think of '{GRK:Iota}{GRK:chi}{GRK:theta}
{GRK:upsilon} '{GRK:sigma}, which does not conceal *Iesous Christos
Theon Uios Soter* as traditionally asserted, but is a mystery of the
letter Nun and the letter Qoph, as may be seen by adding it
up[**24**](#24).)

('{GRK:Iota}{GRK:chi}{GRK:theta}{GRK:upsilon}'{GRK:sigma} is only
connected with Christianity because it was a hieroglyph of syphilis,
which the Romans supposed to have been brought from Syria; and it seems
to have been confounded with leprosy, which also they thought was caused
by fish- eating.)

(One important meaning of '{GRK:Iota}{GRK:chi}{GRK:theta}
{GRK:upsilon}'{GRK:sigma}: it is formed of the initials of five Egyptian
deities and also of five Greek deities: in both cases a magic formula of
tremendous power is concealed[**25**](#25).

As to the Holy Table itself, I cannot see it for the blaze of light; but
I am given to understand that it appears in another Aethyr, of which it
forms practically the whole content. And I am bidden to study the Holy
Table very intently so as to be able to concentrate on it when it
appears.

I have grown greater, so that I am as great as the Angel. And we are
standing, as if crucified, face to face, our hands and lips and breasts
and knees and feet together, and her eyes pierce into my eyes like
whirling shafts of steel, so that I fall backwards headlong through the
Aethyr[**26**](#26) ---and there is a sudden and tremendous shout,
absolutely stunning, cold and brutal: Osiris was a black
god[**27**](#27)! And the Aethyr claps its hands, greater than the peal
of a thousand mighty thunders.

I am back.

1.  <span id="1"></span>POP = {Leo}{Libra}{Leo} =
    {HEB:Tet}{HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Tet}. This Aire introduces the Hegemone, or
    leader of the Candidate through the Ceremony of Initiation. She is
    the Holy Guardian Angel, in the form of Isis-Urania, the
    Instructress. {ENO:p} is {Sun} in his Northern declination, the form
    of Horus in his strength of Summer. He appears in his dual form, as
    it were the pillars between which the Hegemone, who bears a
    mitreheaded wand, symbolical of the Balances, is seated. (See the
    Neophyte Ceremony ---*Equinox*, I, II, pp. 244-261.) She is the
    reconciler between all opposites. (See the Ceremony of the Equinox
    --- given in Equ. I, VII, pp. 372-5). Her function is to equilibrate
    all symbols in the sphere of the Candidate; this is the one
    supremely important formula of Instruction. This Aethyr contains
    accordingly the knowledge (somewhat fragmentary at first sight)
    necessary to the Aspirant to the Grade of Magister Templi. 48 is
    {HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Chet}, a woman; also strength, an army.
    {HEB:Chet} the Bearer of the Graal; and the seed of life;
    {HEB:Lamed} the Balances, i.e. She bears the Seed of Life in the
    Holy Cup ion balance. 48 is {HEB:Mem-final}{HEB:Heh} Ham; see the
    sudden Revelation at the end of the Vision.
2.  <span id="2"></span>The Hebemone wears a Black Cross. See also 16th
    Aire, last paragraph.
3.  <span id="3"></span>The idea is that every idea, however apparently
    atomic, is to be analyzed.
4.  <span id="4"></span>Worship all things; for all things are alike
    necessary to the Being of the All. But keep separate the planes.
    Failure to do this is the most frequent Cause of error.
5.  <span id="5"></span>For purity means full simplification --- and the
    keeping of each idea in its Own true perfection, separate from all
    others.
6.  <span id="6"></span>Worship each thing in itself for its own sake,
    not inventing ideas.
7.  <span id="7"></span>See Note 1. This is the Sphere of Kokab
    ({Mercury}). Hence the Man of Atu IX.
8.  <span id="8"></span>The Chariot (Atu VII) of the Bearer of the
    Sangraal. (See Note 1). {HEB:Chet} depends from Binah, the sphere of
    the Hegemone.
9.  <span id="9"></span>This seems to be a Vision of the Ideas which the
    Alphabet of Daggers is to analyze. The confusion suggests the
    influence of Choronzon. It is a warning of what the Aspirant must
    expect if he once lose his grip on Binah.
10. <span id="10"></span>One of the noblest trees of Hindustan.
11. <span id="11"></span>The Tree of Life bears fruit of innumerable
    ideas. They are all self- destroying and valueless unless organized
    by Understanding.
12. <span id="12"></span>The Saturnian Destroyer --- as opposed to
    Shiva. Time swallows up all ideas, all experiences, Life itself.
    That is a statement of the condition which the Exempt Adept aspires
    to transcend by becoming a Magister Templi.
13. <span id="13"></span>She is the Angel of Binah, though in this form.
    For Atu XIV is Sagittarius, the house of the Huntress.
14. <span id="14"></span>She keeps Love alight by patient Fidelity ---
    the Holy Guardian Angel awaits eternally the address of Her Charge.
    And she is also the Arch- harlot, always ready to seduce and to
    intoxicate him who lusts after Her.
15. <span id="15"></span>Relations with the Seer have been established
    long ago.
16. <span id="16"></span>The Destruction of the Universe by the Devourer
    of all Things is the necessary beginning of the Initiation to the
    Grade of Magister Templi.
17. <span id="17"></span>Man is the Candidate; he partakes of the Truth
    of all the Gods initiating.
18. <span id="18"></span>See note 1.
19. <span id="19"></span>See note 1. She is Isis-Urania, in Atu II. As
    Atu XIV she leads directly upwards to Tiphereth ({HEB:Vau}), as Atu
    VII directly upwards to Binah ({HEB:Heh}), and as Atu II, directly
    upwards to Kether (the top point of {HEB:Yod}).
20. <span id="20"></span>The full title of Atu II. Note "Silver Star" as
    title of the Third Order. Hence she must appear as Hegemone to lead
    the Candidate to the first grade of that Order --- Magister Templi.
21. <span id="21"></span>The Babe of the Abyss is taken to its Mother's
    breast. (There is a reference here to the technique of the grade.)
22. <span id="22"></span>i.e.. Malkut is Binah. (The two Hehs of
    Tetragrammaton are attributed to these Sephiroth; the daughter does
    indeed become the mother.
23. <span id="23"></span>Pisces = fish. Nun literally means fish. Qoph
    refers to the sign Pisces. The versicle means: She is not attained
    by all men.
24. <span
    id="24"></span>'{GRK:Iota}{GRK:chi}{GRK:theta}{GRK:upsilon}'{GRK:sigma}
    = 1219 = {HEB:Taw}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Shin}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Resh}{HEB:Bet}
    {HEB:Resh}{HEB:Zain}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod}. The Former (rock-maker) of
    that which was in the Beginning. It refers to {HEB:Nun} and
    {HEB:Qof}: to {HEB:Nun} because the Fish is "Life in the Water",
    i.e. the Primal Water of Thales: to {HEB:Qof} because Atu XVIII
    shews that Life appearing in the Waters of Midnight, Kephra in the
    Pool of Great Dark Sea. This is the Glyph of Birth natural to Binah.
    There is presumably a further mystery --- numerical --- still not
    found.
25. <span id="25"></span>*Egyptian*: *Greek*:  
    Isis --- The Mother -- Binah I.  
    Cneph --- The Winged Egg --- Binah Ch.  
    Thoth --- The Moon God (measurer Themis --- the satisfied woman of
    time) {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Mem}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Aleph} Uramoth --- The Water
    Goddess Uranus --- Heaven, sphere above (The Great Sea) the Abyss.  
    Sebek --- The Devourer (Time) Selene --- The Moon All these deities
    represent divers forms and functions of the Idea of Binah. How to
    combine them in order to obtain Magical Formulae must be studied in
    the light of *Book 4*, Part III.
26. <span id="26"></span>The Seer cannot make Union with his Guide. She
    is the feminine form of his Holy Guardian Angel; but the impulse to
    unite is only valid when it comes from above. In the 20th Aire this
    was the case; and so the Marriage was accomplished.
27. <span id="27"></span>This, to the Seer at that time, was a
    Revelation of the most appalling terror. The doctrine of the Third
    Order had not been promulgated. He expected to unite with the Great
    Mother in a Mode similar to that experienced in attaining to the
    Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. But the
    attainment of the Grade of Magister Templi involves the Annihilation
    of the aspirant. "Osiris was a black god"; i.e. of the nature of
    Binah--- BLACK. The love of Binah is that of the Queen Scorpion, who
    devours her mate. This revelation therefore, was much as if a
    romantic lover of the Richard Feveral type, were suddenly made fully
    aware that the Maiden of his Dreams intended to conclude their First
    Night of Love by a Breakfast, of which he was to form the staple
    dish! The Doctrine implied is that one must not be the child, but
    the Mother.
