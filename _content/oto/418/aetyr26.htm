<h1 align="center"><strong>The Cry of the 26th Aethyr, <br>
        Which is Called DES</strong><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></h1>
        <p>There is a very bright pentagram: and now the stone is
        gone, and the whole heaven is black, and the blackness is
        the blackness of a mighty angel<a href="#2"><font
        size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. And though he is
        black (his face and his wings and his robe and his armour
        are all black), yet is he so bright that I cannot look
        upon him. And he cries: O ye spears and vials of poison
        and sharp swords and whirling thunderbolts that are about
        the corners of the earth<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>,
        girded with wrath and justice, know ye that His name is
        Righteousness in Beauty<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>?
        Burnt out are your eyes, for that ye have seen me in my
        majesty. And broken are the drum-heads of your ears<a
        href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>,
        because my name is as two mountains of fornication, the
        breasts of a strange woman<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>;
        and my Father is not in them. </p>
        <p>Lo! the pools of fire and torment mingled with
        sulphur! Many are their colours, and their colour is as
        molten gold, when all is said. Is not He one, one and
        alone, in whom the brightness of your countenance is as
        1,728 petals of fire<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>.
        </p>
        <p>Also he spake the curse, folding his wings across and
        crying: Is not the son the enemy of his father? And hath
        not the daughter stolen the warmth of the bed of her
        mother<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>?
        therefore is the great curse irrevocable. Therefore there
        is neither wisdom nor understanding nor knowledge in this
        house, that hangeth upon the edge of hell<a href="#9"><font
        size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. Thou art not 4
        but 2, O thou blasphemy spoken against 1<a href="#10"><font
        size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. </p>
        <p>Therefore whoso worshippeth thee is accursed. He shall
        be brayed in a mortar and the powder thereof cast to the
        winds, that the birds of the air may eat thereof and die;
        and he shall be dissolved in strong acid and the elixir
        poured into the sea, that the fishes of the sea may
        breathe thereof and die. And he shall be mingled with
        dung and spread upon the earth, so that the herbs of the
        earth may feed thereof and die; and he shall be burnt
        utterly with fire, and the ashes thereof shall calcine
        the children of flame, that even in hell may be found an
        overflowing lamentation. </p>
        <p>And now on the breast of the Angel is a golden egg
        between the blackness of the wings, and that egg<a
        href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>
        grows and grows all over the aethyr. And it breaks, and
        within there is a golden eagle. </p>
        <p>And he cries: Woe! woe! woe! Yea, woe unto the world!
        For there is no sin, and there is no salvation<a
        href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>.
        My plumes are like waves of gold upon the sea. My eyes
        are brighter than the sun. My tongue is swifter than the
        lightning. </p>
        <p>Yet am I hemmed in by the armies of night, singing,
        singing phrases unto Him that is smitten by the
        thunderbolt of the abyss. Is not the sky clear behind the
        sun? These clouds that burn thee up, these rays that
        scorch the brains of men with blindness; these are
        heralds before my face of the dissolution and the night. </p>
        <p>Ye are all blinded by my glory; and though ye treasure
        in your heart the sacred word that is the last lever of
        the key to the little door beyond the abyss, yet ye gloss
        and comment thereupon; for the light itself is but
        illusion. Truth itself is but illusion. Yea, these be the
        great illusions beyond life and space and time. </p>
        <p>Let thy lips blister with my words! Are they not
        meteors in thy brain? Back, back from the face of the
        accursed one, who am I; back into the night of my father,
        into the silence; for all that ye deem right is left,
        forward is backward, upward is downward<a href="#13"><font
        size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. </p>
        <p>I am the great god adored of the holy ones. Yet am I
        the accursed one, child of the elements and not their
        father<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>.
        </p>
        <p>O my mother! wilt thou not have pity upon me? Wilt
        thou not shield me? For I am naked, I am manifest, I am
        profane. O my father! wilt not thou withdraw me? I am
        extended, I am double, I am profane. </p>
        <p>Woe, woe unto me! These are they that hear not prayer.
        It is I that have heard all prayer alway, and there is
        none to answer <em>me</em>. Woe unto me! Woe unto me!
        Accursed am I unto the aeons! All this time this
        brilliant eagle-headed god has been attacked, seemingly,
        by invisible people<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>,
        for he is wounded now and again, here and there; little
        streams of fresh blood come out over the feathers of his
        breast. And the smoke of the blood is gradually filling
        the Aethyr with a crimson veil. There is a scroll over
        the top, saying: <em>Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine</em><a
        href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>;
        and there is another scroll below it in a language of
        which I do not know the sounds. The meaning is, Not as
        they have understood<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>.
        </p>
        <p>The blood is thicker and darker now, and it is
        becoming clotted and black, so that everything is blotted
        out; because it coagulates, coagulates. And then at the
        top there steals a dawn of pure night- blue <a href="#18"><font
        size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>, --- Oh, the
        stars, the stars in it deeply set! --- and drives the
        blood down; so that all round the top of the oval
        gradually dawns the figure of our Lady Nuit, and beneath
        her is the flaming winged disk, and below the altar of
        Ra-Hoor-Khuit, even as it is upon the Stele of Revealing<a
        href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>.
        But below is the supine figure of Seb, into whom is
        concentrated all that clotted blood<a href="#20"><font
        size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. </p>
        <p>And there comes a voice: It is the dawn of the aeon.
        The aeons of cursing are passed away. Force and fire,
        strength and sight, these are for the servants of the
        Star and the Snake. </p>
        <p>And now I seem to be lying in the desert, exhausted<a
        href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>.
        </p>
