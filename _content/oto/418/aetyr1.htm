<h1 align="center"><strong>The Cry of the 1st Aethyr, <br>
  Which is Called LIL</strong><a href="#1"><font size="2"><strong>1</strong></font></a> 
</h1>
<p>First, let praise and worship and honour and glory and great thank be given 
  unto the Holy One, who hath permitted us to come thus far, who hath revealed 
  unto us the ineffable mysteries, that they might be disclosed before men. And 
  we humbly beseech His infinite goodness that he will be pleased to manifest 
  unto us even the Mystery of the First Aethyr. </p>
<p>(Here followeth the Call of the Aethyr.)<a href="#2"><font
        size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a></p>
<p>The veil of the Aethyr is like the veil of night, dark azure, full of countless 
  stars. And because the veil is infinite, at first one seeth not the winged globe 
  of the sun that burneth in the centre thereof. Profound peace filleth me, --- 
  beyond ecstasy, beyond thought, beyond being itself, IAIDA. (This word means 
  &quot;I am&quot;, but in a sense entirely beyond being.) </p>
<p>(<em>Note</em>. --- In Hebrew letters it adds to 26. In Hebrew letters the 
  name of the Aethyr is 70, ayin; but by turning the Yetziratic attributions of 
  the letters into Hebrew, it gives 66<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>, 
  is the sum of the numbers from 0 to 11.) </p>
<p>Yes; there is peace. There is no <em>tendency</em> of any sort, much less any 
  observation or feeling or impression. There is only a faint consciousness, like 
  the scent of jasmine. </p>
<p>The body of the Seer is rested in a waking sleep that is deeper than sleep, 
  and his mind is still; he seems like a well in the desert, shaded by windless 
  palms. </p>
<p>And it is night; and because the night is the whole night of space, and not 
  the partial night of earth, there is no thought of dawn. For the light of the 
  Sun maketh illusion, blinding man's eyes to the glory of the stars. And unless 
  he be in the shadow of the earth, he cannot see the stars. So, also, unless 
  he be hidden from the light of life, he cannot behold Nuit. Here, then, do I 
  abide in unalterable midnight, utterly at peace. </p>
<p>I have forgotten where I am, and who I am. I am hanging in nothing. </p>
<p>Now the veil opens of itself. (To Scribe. Come nearer; I don't want to have 
  to speak so loudly.) </p>
<p>It is a little child covered with lilies and roses. He is supported by countless 
  myriads of Archangels. The Archangels are all the same colourless brilliance, 
  and every one of them is blind. Below the Archangels again are many, many other 
  legions, and so on far below, so far that the eye cannot pierce. And on his 
  forehead, and on his heart, and in his hand, is the secret sigil of the Beast.<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a> 
  And of all this the glory is so great that all the spiritual senses fail, and 
  their reflections in the body fail. </p>
<p>It is very strange. In my heart is rapture, holy and ineffable, absolutely 
  beyond emotion; beyond even that bliss called Ananda, infinitely calm and pure. 
  Yet at the gates of mine eyes stand tears, like warriors upon the watch, that 
  lean on their spears, listening<a href="#5"><font
        size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>The great and terrible Angel keeps on looking at me, as if to bar me from the 
  vision. There is another forcing my head down in sleep. </p>
<p>(It's very difficult to talk at all, because an impression takes such an immense 
  time to travel from the will to the muscles. Naturally, I've no idea of time.) 
</p>
<p>I have gone up again to the child, led by two Angels, abasing my head. </p>
<p>This child seems to be the child that one attempted to describe in &quot;The 
  Garden of Janus&quot;.<a href="#6"><font
        size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a> </p>
<p>Every volition is inhibited. I have tried to say a lot, but it has always got 
  lost on the way. </p>
<p>Holy art thou, O more beautiful than all the stars of the Night! </p>
<p>There has never been such peace, such silence. But these are <em>positive</em> 
  things. Singing praises of things eternal amid the flames of first glory, and 
  every note of every song is a fresh flower in the garland of peace. </p>
<p>This child danceth not, but it is because he is the soul of the two dances, 
  --- the right hand and the left hand, and in him they are one dance, the dance 
  without motion.</p>
<p>There is dew on all the fire. Every drop is the quintessence of the ecstasy 
  of stars. </p>
<p>Yet a third time am I led to him, prostrating myself seven times at every step. 
  There is a perfume in the air, reflected down even to the body of the seer. 
  That perfume thrills his body with an ecstasy that is like love, like sleep. 
</p>
<p>And this is the song: </p>
<p>I am the child of all who am the father of all, for from me come forth all 
  things, that I might be. I am the fountain in the snows, and I am the eternal 
  sea. I am the lover, and I am the beloved, and I am the first- fruits of their 
  love. I am the first faint shuddering of the Light, and I am the loom wherein 
  night weaveth her impenetrable veil. </p>
<p>I am the captain of the hosts of eternity; of the swordsmen and the spearmen 
  and the bowmen and the charioteers. I have led the armies of the east against 
  the armies of the west, and the armies of the west against the armies of the 
  east. For I am Peace. </p>
<p>My groves of olive were planted by an harlot, and my horses were bred by a 
  thief. I have trained my vines upon the spears of the Most High, and with my 
  laughter have I slain a thousand men. </p>
<p>With the wine in my cup have I mixed the lightnings, and I have carved my bread 
  with a sharp sword. </p>
<p>With my folly have I undone the wisdom of the Magus, even as with my judgments 
  I have overwhelmed the universe. I have eaten the pomegranate in the House of 
  Wrath, and I have crushed out the blood of my mother between mill-stones to 
  make bread. </p>
<p>There is nothing that I have not trampled beneath my feet. There is nothing 
  that I have not set a garland on my brow. I have wound all things about my waist 
  as a girdle. I have hidden all things in the cave of my heart. I have slain 
  all things because I am Innocence. I have lain with all things because I am 
  Untouched Virginity. I have given birth to all things because I am Death. </p>
<p>Stainless are my lips, for they are redder than the purple of the vine, and 
  of the blood wherewith I am intoxicated. Stainless is my forehead, for it is 
  whiter than the wind and the dew that cooleth it. </p>
<p>I am light, and I am night, and I am that which is beyond them. </p>
<p>I am speech, and I am silence, and I am that which is beyond them. </p>
<p>I am life, and I am death, and I am that which is beyond them. </p>
<p>I am war, and I am peace, and I am that which is beyond them. </p>
<p>I am weakness, and I am strength, and I am that which is beyond them. </p>
<p>Yet by none of these can man reach up to me. Yet by each of them must man reach 
  up to me. </p>
<p>Thou shalt laugh at the folly of the fool. Thou shalt learn the wisdom of the 
  Wise. And thou shalt be initiate in holy things. And thou shalt be learned in 
  the things of love. And thou shalt be mighty in the things of war. And thou 
  shalt be adept in things occult. And thou shalt interpret the oracles. And thou 
  shalt drive all these before thee in thy car, and though by none of these canst 
  thou reach up to me, yet by each of these must thou attain to me. And thou must 
  have the strength of the lion, and the secrecy of the hermit. And thou must 
  turn the wheel of life. And thou must hold the balances of Truth. Thou must 
  pass through the great Waters, a Redeemer. Thou must have the tail of the scorpion, 
  and the poisoned arrows of the Archer, and the dreadful horns of the Goat. And 
  so shalt thou break down the fortress that guardeth the Palace of the King my 
  son. And thou must work by the light of the Star and of the Moon and of the 
  Sun, and by the dreadful light of judgment that is the birth of the Holy Spirit 
  within thee. When these shall have destroyed the universe, then mayest thou 
  enter the palace of the Queen my daughter<a href="#7"><font
        size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>Blessed, blessed, blessed; yea, blessed; thrice and four times blessed is he 
  that hath attained to look upon thy face. For I will hurl thee forth from my 
  presence as a whirling thunderbolt to guard the ways, and whom thou smitest 
  shall be smitten indeed. And whom thou lovest shall be loved indeed. And whether 
  by smiting or by love thou workest, each one shall see my face, a glimmer through 
  a thousand veils. And they shall rise up from love's sleep or death's, and gird 
  themselves with a girdle of snake-skin for wisdom, and they shall wear the white 
  tunic of purity, and the apron of flaming orange for will, and over their shoulders 
  shall they cast the panther's skin of courage. And they shall wear the nemyss 
  of secrecy and the ateph crown of truth. And on their feet shall they put sandals 
  made of the skin of breasts, that they may trample upon all they were, yet also 
  that its toughness shall support them, and protect their feet, as they pass 
  upon the mystical way that lieth through the pylons. And upon their breasts 
  shall be the Rose and Cross of light and life, and in their hands the hermit's 
  staff and lamp. Thus shall they set out upon the never-ending journey, each 
  step of which is an unutterable reward<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy; yea, thrice and four times holy art thou, because thou 
  hast attained to look upon my face; not by my favour only, not by thy magick 
  only, may this be won. Yet it is written: &quot;Unto the persevering mortal 
  the blessed Immortals are swift.&quot; </p>
<p>Mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty; yea, thrice and four times mighty art thou. 
  He that riseth up against thee shall be thrown down, though thou raise not so 
  much as thy little finger against him. And he that speaketh evil against thee 
  shall be put to shame, though thy lips utter not the littlest syllable against 
  him. And he that thinketh evil concerning thee shall be confounded in his thought, 
  although in thy mind arise not the least thought of him<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
  And they shall be brought unto subjection unto thee, and serve thee, though 
  thou willest it not. And it shall be unto them a grace and a sacrament, and 
  ye shall all sit down together at the supernal banquet, and ye shall feast upon 
  the honey of the gods, and be drunk upon the dew of immortality --- FOR I AM 
  HORUS, THE CROWNED AND CONQUERING CHILD, WHOM THOU KNEWEST NOT! </p>
<p>Pass thou on, therefore, O thou Prophet of the Gods, unto the Cubical Altar 
  of the Universe; there shalt thou receive every tribe and kingdom and nation 
  into the mighty Order that reacheth from the frontier fortresses that guard 
  the Uttermost Abyss unto My Throne. </p>
<p>This is the formula of the Aeon, and with that the voice of LIL, that is the 
  Lamp of the Invisible Light, is ended. Amen. </p>

    {HEB:Yod}{HEB:Nun} rest, peace; and {HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Bet}{HEB:Ayin}, a Servant 
    (in the noble sense). In Hebrew LIL would be 70, the eye of Horus, {HEB:Ayin}. 
    But see a previous note on the twelvefold table, 15th Aethyr, where these 
    letters rule the Universe. (scil. that of the present Aeon.)</font></li>
  <li><a name="2"></a><font size="2">The Seer was only too well aware that, considering 
    the dire straits to which he was put to obtain the Second Aire, he was surely 
    incapable of penetrating the First. In fact, only a full Magus could pierce 
    the Second properly, and for the First, none but an Ipsissimus would be competent. 
    This apprehension was in fact justified. Only now and then was he able to 
    live at the level of LIL; much of the Vision and the Voice here printed is 
    but a pale reflection in Rauch (and even that at the cost of infinite effort) 
    of the Word of the Angel of the Aethyr. These &quot;Ersatz-words&quot; are 
    indicated in the present edition by square brackets.</font></li>
  <li><a name="3"></a><font size="2">i.e. by taking L as Luna. In the note in 
    the title, we have taken it as {Cancer}, experience having shewn that this 
    mode is more accurate. L is {Moon} in her decrease, and {Cancer} her house. 
    But the Enochian alphabet is referred to the Zodiac and the Elements; only 
    indirectly to the planets; and it is imprudent to make any exception.</font></li>

  <li><a name="5"></a><font size="2">There are long intervals between many of 
    these paragraphs, the Seer having been lost to Being. The reader will note 
    that &quot;The Great and Terrible Angel&quot; has not been mentioned, but 
    comes in suddenly. This was because the Seer's speech was inaudible, or never 
    occurred. This angel was the &quot;Higher Genius&quot; of the Seer.</font></li>
