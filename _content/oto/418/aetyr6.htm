<p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 6th Aethyr,<br>
  Which is Called MAZ</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
<p>There cometh into the stone the great Angel whose name is Av<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>, 
  and in him there are symbols which strive for mastery, --- Sulphur and the Pentagram, 
  and they are harmonized by the Swastika<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. 
  These symbols are found both in the name of Av<a

        href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a> and in the name 
  of the Aethyr. Thus he is neither Horus nor Osiris. He is called the radiance 
  of Thoth; and this Aethyr is very hard to understand, for the images form and 
  dissolve more rapidly than lightning. These images are the illusions made by 
  the Ape of Thoth. And this I understand, that I am not worthy to receive the 
  mysteries of this Aethyr. And all this which I have seen (being all the thoughts 
  that I have ever thought) is, as it were, a guardian of the Aethyr<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>I seem quite helpless. I am trying all sorts of magical methods of piercing 
  the veil: and the more I strive, the farther away I seem to get from success. 
  But a voice comes now: Must not understanding lie open unto wisdom as the pyramids 
  lie open to the stars? </p>
<p>Accordingly, I wait in a certain magical posture which it is not fitting to 
  disclose, and above me appears the starry heaven<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a> 
  of night, and one star greater than all the other stars. It is a star of eight 
  rays. I recognize it as the star in the seventeenth key of the Tarot, as the 
  Star of Mercury. And the light of it cometh from the path of Aleph. And the 
  letter Cheth is also involved in the interpretation of this star, and the paths 
  of he' and vau are the separations which this Star unites<a href="#7"><font

        size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. And in the heart of the star is 
  an exceeding splendour, --- a god standing upon the moon, brilliant beyond imagining<a href="#8"><font

        size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. It is like unto the vision of 
  the Universal Mercury. But this is the Fixed Mercury, and he' and vau are the 
  perfected sulphur and salt. But now I come into the centre of the maze, and 
  whirling dust of stars and great forgotten gods. It is the whirling Svastika 
  which throws off all these things, for the Svastika is in aleph by the shape 
  and number<a

        href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>, and in beth by 
  the position of the arms of the Magician<a

        href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>, and in gimel<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a> 
  because of the sign of the Mourning of Isis, and thus is the Crown defended 
  by these three thunderbolts. Is not thrice seventeen fifty-one, that is, failure 
  and pain? </p>
<p>Now I am shut out again by this black Svastika with a corona of fire about 
  it. </p>
<p>And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shall uncover the nakedness of the Most 
  High, for he is drunken upon the wine that is the blood of the adepts. And BABALON 
  hath lulled him to sleep upon her breast, and she hath fled away, and left him 
  naked, and she hath called her children together, saying: Come up with me, and 
  let us make a mock of the nakedness of the Most High. </p>
<p>And the first of the adepts covered His shame with a cloth, walking backwards; 
  and was white. And the second of the adepts covered His shame with a cloth, 
  walking sideways and was yellow. And the third of the adepts made a mock of 
  His nakedness, walking forwards; and was black. And these are three great schools 
  of the Magi, who are also the three Magi that journeyed unto Bethlehem; and 
  because thou hast not wisdom, thou shalt not know which school prevaileth, or 
  if the three schools be not one<a

        href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. For the Black 
  Brothers lift not up their heads thus far into the Holy Chokmah, for they were 
  all drowned in the great flood, which is Binah, before the true vine could be 
  planted upon the holy hill of Zion. </p>
<p>Now again I stand in the centre, and all things whirl by with incessant fury. 
  And the thought of the god entereth my mind, and I cry aloud: Behold, the volatile 
  is become fixed; and in the heart of eternal motion is eternal rest. So is the 
  Peace beneath the sea that rageth with her storms; so is the changeful moon, 
  the dead planet that revolveth no more. So the far-seeing, the far-darting hawk 
  is poised passionless in the blue; so also the ibis that is long of limb meditateth 
  solitary in the sign of Sulphur. Behold, I stand ever before the Eternal One 
  in the sign of the Enterer<a href="#13"><font

        size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. And by virtue of my speech is 
  he wrapped about in silence, and he is wrapped in mystery by me, who am the 
  Unveiler of the Mysteries. And although I be truth, yet do they call me rightly 
  the God of Lies, for speech is two-fold, and truth is one<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. 
  Yet I stand at the centre of the spider's web, whereof the golden filaments 
  reach to infinity<a href="#15"><font

        size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>But thou that art with me in the spirit-vision art not with me by right of 
  Attainment, and thou canst not stay in this place to behold how I run and return, 
  and who are the flies that are caught in my web. For I am the inmost guardian 
  that is immediately before the shrine. </p>
<p>None shall pass by me except he slay me<a href="#16"><font

        size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>, and this is his curse, that, 
  having slain me, he must take my office and become the maker of Illusions, the 
  great deceiver, the setter of snares<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>; 
  he who baffleth even them that have understanding. For I stand on every path, 
  and turn them aside from the truth by my words, and by my magick arts. </p>
<p>And this is the horror<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a> 
  that was shown by the lake that was nigh unto the City of the Seven Hills<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>, 
  and this is the Mystery of the great prophets that have come unto mankind. Moses, 
  and Buddha, and Lao Tan, and Krishna, and Jesus<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>, 
  and Osiris, and Mohammed; for all these attained unto the grade of Magus, and 
  therefore were they bound with the curse of Thoth. But, being guardians of the 
  truth, they have taught nothing but falsehood, except unto such as understood; 
  for the truth may not pass the Gate of the Abyss<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>But the reflection of the truth hath been shown in the lower Sephiroth. And 
  its balance is in Beauty, and therefore have they who sought only beauty come 
  nearest to the truth. For the beauty receiveth directly three rays from the 
  supernals, and the others no more than one<a

        href="#22"><strong>22</strong></a>. So, therefore, they that have sought 
  after majesty and power and victory and learning and happiness and gold, have 
  been discomfited. And these sayings are the lights of wisdom that thou mayst 
  know thy Master, for he is a Magus. And because thou didst eat of the Pomegranate 
  in hell, for half the year art thou concealed, and half the year revealed<a

        href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>Now I perceive the Temple that is the heart of this Aethyr<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>; 
  it is an Urn suspended in the air, without support, above the centre of a well. 
  And the well hath eight pillars, and a canopy above it, and without there is 
  a circle of marble paving-stones, and without them a great outer circle of pillars. 
  And beyond there is the forest of the stars. But the Urn is the wonderful thing 
  in all this; it is made of fixed Mercury; and within it are the ashes of the 
  Book Tarot<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>, which 
  hath been utterly consumed<a href="#26"><font

        size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>.</p>
<p>And this is that mystery which is spoken of in the Acts of the Apostles; that 
  Jupiter and Mercury (Kether and Chokmah) visited (that is, inspired), Ephesus, 
  the City of Diana<a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>, 
  Binah --- was not Diana a black stone? -- and they burnt their books of magick. 
</p>
<p>Now it seems that the centre of infinite space is that Urn, and Hadit is the 
  fire that hath burnt up the book Tarot. For in the book Tarot was preserved 
  all of the wisdom (for the Tarot was called the Book of Thoth), of the Aeon 
  that is passed. And in the Book of Enoch was first given the wisdom of the New 
  Aeon. And it was hidden for three hundred years, because it was wrested untimely 
  from the Tree of Life by the hand of a desperate magician<a

        href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. For it was the 
  Master<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a> of that Magician 
  who overthrew the power of the Christian church; but the pupil rebelled against 
  the master, for he foresaw that the New (i.e., the Protestant) would be worse 
  than the Old. But he understood not the purpose of his Master, and that was, 
  to prepare the way for the overthrowing of the Aeon<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>There is a writing upon the Urn of which I can but read the (two) words: Stabat 
  Crux juxta Lucem. Stabat Lux juxta Crucem. </p>
<p>And there is writing in Greek above that. The word &quot;nox&quot; written 
  in Greek, and a circle with a cross in the centre of it, a St. Andrew's cross<a

        href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>Then above that is a sigil(?), hidden by a hand<a

        href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>And a voice proceedeth from the Urn: From the ashes of the Tarot who shall 
  make the phoenix-wand? Not even he who by his understanding hath made the lotus-wand 
  to grow in the Great Sea. Get thee back, for thou art not an Atheist, and though 
  thou have violated thy mother, thou hast not slain thy father<a href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a>. 
  Get thee back from the Urn; thy ashes are not hidden here<a

        href="#34"><font size="1"><strong>34</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>Then again arose the God Thoth, in the sign of the Enterer, and he drove the 
  seer from before his face. And he fell through the starry night unto the little 
  village in the desert. </p>

  <li><a name="23"></a><font size="2">It has been curiously true, that the Seer 
    since this time has usually been concealed in A Great Magical Retirement for 
    about half of every year. This doctrine of the eating of the pomegranate refers 
    to the fact that he refused to adopt one of the routine methods of success 
    in Magick. He, being the Beast, 666, felt that he must keep his hold on Tiphereth 
    by maintaining the Formula of the Rosy Cross.</font></li>
  <li><a name="24"></a><font size="2">This is like the Temple of Vesta at Rome

  <li><a name="32"></a><font size="2">All this required a Magus to see properly.</font></li>
  <li><a name="33"></a><font size="2">This again means that the Magus 9x = 2{square

  <li><a name="34"></a><font size="2">This fact is now maintained openly. As to 
    Atheists see <em>Liber LXV</em>, V. 34 - 40. Also 5th Aire; the Magister Templi 
    is already being subtly prepared to attain to be a Magus. </font></li>
