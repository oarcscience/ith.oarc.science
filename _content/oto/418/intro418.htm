<p><em>The Vision and the Voice</em> of the Angels of the thirty Aethyrs, reprinted 
  from the <em>Equinox,</em> Volume 1, Supplement to No. 5, but here represented 
  for the first time with an elaborate commentary by the MASTER THERION, is unique 
  in that it attempts to describe in a perfectly sane and scientific manner spiritual 
  experiences, and the investigations of the more subtle planes. </p>
<p>The first attempts to obtain these visions were made in 1900, in Mexico, where 
  FRATER PERDURABO had journeyed in his efforts to obtain a perfect understanding 
  of the mystic traditions and methods of attainment of every race and clime. 
  The first two Aires were investigated on November 14 and 17, 1900. <em>The Vision 
  and the Voice</em> was mysterious and terrific in character. But what he saw 
  was not altogether beyond his previous experiences; what he heard was as unintelligible 
  to him as William Blake to a 7th Day Adventist. He was encouraged by the evident 
  importance of these results, but found that he was absolutely unable to proceed 
  with the 28th Aethyr. It became evident, some 9 years later, that what stopped 
  his further exploration of the Aethyrs in 1900 was simply that his Grade did 
  not entitle him to go further than the 29th. In fact only a Master of the Temple, 
  8x = 3{square x}, can penetrate beyond a certain point, and further, as sections 
  of the Comment point out, even a Master of the Temple cannot pierce through 
  the veils surrounding the outer of these Aires. </p>
<p>The Seer had not thought of continuing this work for nearly 9 years. It is 
  not at all clear how the idea came to him in 1909, during a walk through the 
  Desert with Frater O.V., (Victor Neuburg) a Probationer of the A{.'.} A{.'.}, 
  but at Aumale a Hand suddenly smote its lightning into his heart, and he knew 
  that now, that very day, he must take up <em>The Vision and the Voice</em> from 
  the point where he had laid it down in 1900. Parallel to this, it is also possible 
  that he had in his ruck sack one of his earliest Magical Note Books, where he 
  had copied with infinite patience the 19 Calls or Keys obtained by Sir Edward 
  Kelly from certain Angels and written down by Queen Elizabeth's astrologer, 
  Dr. John Dee. </p>
<p>The facts that stamp these Keys or Calls are these. Over 100 squares filled 
  with letters were obtained by these two Magicians, in a manner which no one 
  yet has quite understood. Dee would have one or more of these tables (as a rule 
  49 by 49) --- some full, others lettered only on alternate squares --- before 
  him on a writing table. Kelly would sit at what they called the Holy Table, 
  and gaze into a &quot;Shewstone&quot; in which he would see an Angel, who would 
  point with a wand to letters on one of these charts in succession. Kelly would 
  report, for example, &quot;He points to column 6, rank 31&quot;, and so on, 
  apparently not mentioning the letter, which Dee found and wrote down from the 
  &quot;Table&quot; before him. When the Angel had finished, the message was rewritten 
  backwards. It had been dictated backwards as being too dangerous to communicate 
  forwards --- each word being in its nature so powerful that its direct communication 
  would have evoked forces which were not wanted at that time. </p>
<p>These Keys being re-written backwards, there then appeared conjurations in 
  a language which they called &quot;Enochian&quot;, or &quot;Angelic&quot;. It 
  is not a jargon; it has a grammar and a syntax of its own. It is far more sonorous, 
  stately and impressive than even Greek or Sanskrit and the English translations, 
  though in places difficult to understand, contain passages of a sustained sublimity 
  that Shakespeare, Milton and the Bible do not surpass. </p>
<p>&quot;Can the Wings of the Wind understand your voices of Wonder? O Ye! The 
  Second of the First! whom the burning flames have framed in the depths of my 
  Jaws! Whom I have prepared as cups for a wedding, or as flowers in their beauty 
  for the chamber of Righteousness! Stronger are your feet than the barren stone! 
  and mightier are your voices than the manifold winds! For you are become a building 
  such as is not, save in the mind of the All-Powerful.&quot; (Second Key) </p>
<p>There are nineteen of these Keys: the first two conjuring the element called 
  Spirit; the next sixteen invoke the Four Elements; each sub-divided into four; 
  the nineteenth, by changing two names, may be used to invoke any one of what 
  are called the thirty &quot;Aethyrs&quot; or &quot;Aires&quot;. </p>
<p>The genuineness of these Keys, altogether apart from any critical observation, 
  is guaranteed by the fact that anyone with the smallest capacity for Magick 
  finds that they <em>work</em>. The Seer had used these Keys a great deal, --- 
  always with excellent effect. It was in Mexico that the idea occurred to him 
  to discover for himself what these Aethyrs really were, by invoking them in 
  turn by means of the nineteenth key, and, by skrying in the Spirit Vision, judge 
  their nature by what he saw and heard. </p>
<p>It was then in Aumale, that he prepared to commence once more the investigations 
  of these Aethyrs, and accordingly bought a number of notebooks. After dinner, 
  on the 23rd of November, 1909, he invoked the 28th Aethyr by means of this 19th 
  Key. When it was compared with those of the 29th and 30th Aethyrs, --- lo and 
  behold, there were exhibited the same peculiarities of subject and style. This 
  is true also of the 27th, and so on to the 24th; yet there is a continuous advance 
  towards coherence both in each Aethyr itself, and as regards its neighbour. 
  The subject shows solemnity and sublimity, as well as the tendency to fit in 
  with those conceptions of the Cosmos, those mystic Laws of Nature, and those 
  ideas of transcendental Truth which had already been foreshadowed in <em>The 
  Book of the Law</em> (Vernal Equinox, 1904), and the more exalted of the trances 
  which the Seer had experienced prior to this date. </p>
<p>The Method of obtaining <em>The Vision and the Voice</em> was as follows. </p>
<p>The Seer had with him a great golden topaz (set in a Calvary Cross of six squares, 
  made of wood, and painted vermillion) which was engraved with a Greek Cross 
  of five squares charged with the Rose of 49 petals. He held this, as a rule, 
  in his hand. After choosing a spot where he was not likely to be disturbed he 
  would take this stone and recite the Enochian Call, and after satisfying himself 
  that the forces invoked were actually present, made the topaz play a part not 
  unlike that of the looking glass in the case of Alice. (He had long learned 
  not to trouble himself to travel to any particular place in his Body of Light. 
  He realized that Space was not a thing in itself, but merely a convenient category 
  [one of many such] by reference to which we can distinguish objects from each 
  other.) He would then describe what he saw and repeat what he heard, and Frater 
  O.V., the Scribe, would write down his words, and incidentally observe any phenomena 
  which struck him as peculiar. (For instance, He would at times pass into a deep 
  trance so that many minutes might pass between two successive sentences, as 
  the text to the later Aethyrs shows.) </p>
<p>They walked steadily through the Desert, invoking the Aethyrs, one by one, 
  at convenient times and places, or when the Spirit moved them. As a rule, one 
  Aethyr was obtained every day. Bou-Sada was reached on November 30th; on December 
  8th they started again through the desert for Biskra which they reached on December 
  16th, completing the work on the 19th. By the time Bou-Sada was reached, and 
  they had arrived at the 20th Aethyr, the Seer began to understand that these 
  visions were, so to speak, cosmopolitan. They brought all systems of Magical 
  doctrine into harmonious relation. The symbolism of Asiatic cults; the ideas 
  of the Qabalah, both Jewish and Greek; the Arcana of the Gnostics; the Pagan 
  Pantheon, from Mithras to Mars; the Mysteries of Ancient Khem; the Rites of 
  Eleusis; the Scandinavian Sagas; Celtic and Druidical ritual; Mexican and Polynesian 
  traditions; the Mysticism of Molinos no less than that of Islam,--- all these 
  fell into their proper places without the slightest tendency to quarrel. The 
  whole of the past Aeon, in short, appeared in detailed perspective, and each 
  element therefore surrendered its sovereignty to Horus, the Crowned and Conquering 
  Child, the Lord of the Aeon announced in <em>The Book of the Law</em>

  <p align="center"><strong>THE CALL OR KEY OF THE THIRTY AETHYRS</strong> </p>
  <p>O Ye Heavens which dwell in the first Aire<a href="#1">1</a>, ye are mighty 
    in the parts of the Earth, and execute therein the Judgment of the Highest! 
    Unto you it is said: Behold the Face of your God, the beginning of Comfort, 
    whose eyes are the brightness of the Heavens, which provided you for the Government 
    of the Earth, and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with the power of 
    understanding to dispose of all things according to the Foresight of Him that 
    Sitteth on the Holy Throne<a
        href="#2">2</a>, and rose up in the Beginning, saying: The Earth, let 
    her be governed by her parts, and let there be Division in her, that the glory 
    of her may be always ecstasy and imitation of orgasm. Her course, let it run 
    with the Heavens; and as an handmaid let her serve them. One season, let it 
    confound another, and let there be no creature upon or within her the same. 
    All her members, let them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one 
    Creature equal with another. The reasonable Creatures of the Earth, and Men, 
    let them vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling-places, let them 
    forget their Names. The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced. His 
    building, let it be a Cave for the Beast of the Field! Confound her understanding 
    with darkness! For why? It repenteth me concerning the Virgin and the Man. 
    One while let her be known, and another while a stranger: because she is the 
    bed of an Harlot, and the dwelling-place of him that is fallen. </p>
  <p>O ye Heavens arise! The lower heavens beneath you, let them serve you! Govern 
    those that govern! Cast down such as fall. Bring forth with those that increase, 
    and destroy the rotten. No place let it remain in one number. Add an diminish 
    until the stars be numbered. Arise! Move! and appear before the Covenant of 
    His mouth, which He hath sworn unto us in His Justice. Open the Mysteries 
    of your Creation, and make us partakers of THE UNDEFILED KNOWLEDGE.</p>

  <p>Note: In various footnotes to the text, Crowley makes correspondences to 
    Enochian letters and Astrological symbols. An ambiguity exists in regard to 
    the letter &quot;T&quot;. The Germer/Thelema Publishing Edition of 1952 e.v. 
    makes extensive use of symbols for Astrological concepts, and it is not possible 
    to clearly differentiate the signs for Leo and Caput Draconis in all instances, 
    since the handwritten symbols for these two correspondences are usually indistinguishable 
    in the Germer edition. Enochian corresponds directly to English letters, while 
    the astrological correspondences come from correspondences to Hebrew letters. 
    There are two letters in Hebrew which are loosely rendered &quot;T&quot; in 
    English/Enochian; Tet = Leo and Taw = Caput Draconis/Saturn. Crowley uses 
    both Leo and Caput Draconis for the Enochian &quot;T&quot; in his notes. Where 
    Leo or Caput Draconis is made clear by the context of the note, the rendering 
    has been duplicated here. Where this is ambiguous, T is assumed to be matched 
    to Leo in this text. F.I.Regardie, in his edition, usually renders the Enochian 
    &quot;T&quot; as Caput Draconis, a practice reversed in this present version. 
    A concise edition should therefore be made only after careful examination 
    of the notations for every instance of the use of the Enochian &quot;T&quot;, 
    with citation of uncertainty in regard to Leo or Caput Draconis where Crowley's 
    intention is unclear.</p>
