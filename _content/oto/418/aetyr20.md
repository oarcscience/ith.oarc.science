**The Cry of the 20th Aethyr,  
Which is Called KHR**[**1**](#1)

The dew that was upon the face of the stone is gone, and it is become
like a pool of clear golden water. And now the light is come into the
Rosy Cross. Yet all that I see is the night, with the stars therein, as
they appear through a telescope[**2**](#2). And there cometh a
peacock[**3**](#3) into the stone, filling the whole Aire. It is like
the vision called the Universal Peacock, or, rather, like a
representation of that vision. And now there are countless clouds of
white angels[**4**](#4) filling the Aire as the peacock dissolves.

Now behind the angels are archangels with trumpets. These cause all
things to appear at once, so that there is a tremendous confusion of
images. And now I perceive that all these things are but veils of the
wheel, for they all gather themselves[**5**](#5) into a wheel[**6**](#6)
that spins with incredible velocity. It hath many colours, but all
thrilled with white light, so that they are transparent and luminous.
This one wheel is forty-nine wheels, set at different angles, so that
they compose a sphere; each wheel has forty-nine spokes, and has
forty-nine[**7**](#7) concentric tyres at equal distances from the
centre. And wherever the rays from any two wheels meet, there is a
blinding flash of glory. It must be understood that though so much
detail is visible in the wheel, yet at the same time the impression is
of a single, simple object.

It seems that this wheel is being spun by a hand[**8**](#8). Though the
wheel fills the whole Aire, yet the hand is much bigger than the wheel.
And though this vision is so great and splendid, yet there is no
seriousness with it, or solemnity. It seems that the hand is spinning
the wheel merely for pleasure, it would be better to say amusement.

A voice comes: For he is a jocund and a ruddy god, and his laughter is
the vibration of all that exists, and the earthquakes of the soul.

One is conscious of the whirring of the wheel thrilling one, like an
electric discharge passing through one.

Now I see the figures on the wheel, which have been interpreted as the
sworded Sphinx, Hermanubis and Typhon[**9**](#9). And that is wrong. The
rim of the wheel is a vivid emerald snake; in the centre of the wheel is
a scarlet heart; and, impossible to explain as it is, the scarlet of the
heart and the green of the snake are yet more vivid than the blinding
white brilliance of the wheel[**10**](#10).

The figures on the wheel are darker than the wheel itself; in fact, they
are stains upon the purity of the wheel, and for that reason, and
because of the whirling of the wheel, I cannot see them. But at the top
seems to be the Lamb and Flag, such as one sees on some Christian
medals, and one of the lower things is a wolf, and the other a raven.
The Lamb and Flag symbol is much brighter than the other two. It keeps
on growing brighter, until now it is brighter than the wheel itself, and
occupies more space than it did.

It speaks: I am the greatest of the deceivers, for my purity and
innocence shall seduce the pure and innocent, who but for me should come
to the centre of the wheel[**11**](#11). The wolf betrayeth only the
greedy and the treacherous; the raven betrayeth only the melancholy and
the dishonest [**12**](#12). But I am he of whom it is written: He shall
deceive the very elect.

For in the beginning the Father of all called forth lying spirits that
they might sift the creatures of the earth in three sieves, according to
the three impure souls. And he chose the wolf for the lust of the flesh,
and the raven for the lust of the mind; but me did he choose above all
to simulate the pure prompting of the soul[**13**](#13). Them that are
fallen a prey to the wolf and the raven I have not scathed; but them
that have rejected me, I have given over to the wrath of the raven and
the wolf[**14**](#14). And the jaws of the one have torn them, and the
beak of the other has devoured the corpse. Therefore is my flag white,
because I have left nothing upon the earth alive. I have feasted myself
on the blood of the saints, but I am not suspected of men to be their
enemy, for my fleece is white and warm, and my teeth are not the teeth
of one that teareth flesh; and mine eyes are mild, and they know me not
the chief of the lying spirits that the Father of all sent forth from
before his face in the beginning[**15**](#15).

(His attribution is salt; the wolf mercury, and the raven
sulphur[**16**](#16).)

Now the lamb grows small again, there is again nothing but the wheel,
and the hand that whirleth it.

And I said: "By the word of power, double in the voice of the Master; by
the word that is seven, and one in seven; and by the great and terrible
word 210[**17**](#17), I beseech thee, O my Lord, to grant me the vision
of thy glory." And all the rays of the wheel stream out at me, and I am
blasted and blinded with the light. I am caught up into the wheel. I am
one with the wheel. I am greater than the wheel[**18**](#18). In the
midst of a myriad lightnings I stand, and I behold his face. (I am
thrown violently back on to the earth every second, so that I cannot
quite concentrate.)

All one gets is a liquid flame of pale gold. But its radiant force keeps
hurling me back.

And I say: By the word and the will, by the penance and the prayer, let
me behold thy face. (I cannot explain this, there is confusion of
personalities.) I who speak to you, see what I tell you; but I, who see
him, cannot communicate it to me, who speak to you[**19**](#19).

If one could gaze upon the sun at noon, that might be like the substance
of him. But the light is without heat. It is the vision of
Ut[**20**](#20) in the Upanishads. And from this vision have come all
the legends of Bacchus and Krishna and Adonis[**21**](#21). For the
impression is of a youth dancing and making music. But you must
understand that he is not doing that, for he is still[**22**](#22). Even
the hand that turns the wheel is not his hand, but only a hand energized
by him.

And now it is the dance of Shiva. I lie beneath his feet, his saint, his
victim[**23**](#23). My form is the form of the God Phtah[**24**](#24),
in my essence, but the form of the god Seb in my form[**25**](#25). And
this is the reason of existence, that in this dance which is delight,
there must needs be both the god and the adept. Also the earth herself
is a saint; and the sun and the moon dance upon her, torturing her with
delight.

This vision is not perfect. I am only in the outer court of the vision,
because I have undertaken it in the service of the Holy One, and must
retain sense and speech[**26**](#26). No recorded vision is perfect, of
high visions, for the seer must keep either his physical organs or his
memory in working order. And neither is capable. There is no bridge. One
can only be conscious of one thing at a time, and as the consciousness
moves nearer to the vision, it loses control of the physical and mental.
Even so, the body and the mind must be very perfect before anything can
be done, or the energy of the vision may send the body into spasms and
the mind into insanity. This is why the first visions give Ananda, which
is a shock. When the adept is attuned to Samadhi, there is but cloudless
peace[**27**](#27).

This vision is particularly difficult to get into, because he is
I[**28**](#28). And therefore the human ego is being constantly excited,
so that one comes back so often. An acentric meditation practice like
mahasatipatthana ought to be done before invocations of the Holy
Guardian Angel, so that the ego may be very ready to yield itself
utterly to the Beloved.

And now the breeze is blowing about us, like the sighs of love
unsatisfied --- or satisfied. His lips move[**29**](#29). I cannot say
the words at first.

And afterwords: "Shalt thou not bring the children of men to the sight
of my glory[**30**](#30)? 'Only thy silence and thy speech that worship
me avail.' 'For as I am the last, so am I the next, and as the next
shalt thou reveal me to the multitude[**31**](#31).' Fear not for aught;
turn not aside for aught, eremite of Nuit, apostle of Hadit, warrior of
Ra Hoor Khu! The leaven taketh, and the bread shall be sweet; the
ferment worketh, and the wine shall be sweet. My sacraments are vigorous
food and divine madness. Come unto me, O ye children of men; come unto
me, in whom I am, in whom ye are, were ye only alive with the life that
abideth in Light."

All this time I have been fading away. I sink. The veil of night comes
down a dull blue-gray with one pentagram in the midst of it, watery and
dull. And I am to abide there for a while before I come back to the
earth[**32**](#32). (But shut me the window up, hide me from the sun.
Oh, shut the window!)[**33**](#33)

Now, the pentagram is faded; black crosses fill the Aethyr gradually
growing and interlacing, until there is a network.

It is all dark now. I am lying exhausted[**34**](#34), with the sharp
edge of the shew-stone cutting into my forehead.

Bou-Sada.  
November 30, 1909. 9:15 - 10:50 a.m.

1.  <span id="1"></span>KHR = {Dee}{Air}{Gemini} =
    {HEB:Shin}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Vau} = 308. (N.B. by Temurah, R.H.K. =
    Ra-Hoor-Khuit). 308 = 28 x 11. 28 = {HEB:Chet} {HEB:Koph} =
    {Cancer}{Jupiter} (Jupiter is exalted in Cancer) means Power. And 29
    is the "mystic number" of Netzach, Victory, the Sephira that hangs
    from the Sphere of Jupiter, by the path of Jupiter, Atu X, the Wheel
    of Fortune. This Atu is the main subject of the vision in this
    Aethyr. In this Aethyr the Solar Body (Ruach --- the human
    consciousness) of the Seer was prepared for the Great Initiation
    which follows, as in the 27th Aire his Lunar Body (Nephesch ---
    automatic Consciousness) was purified.
2.  <span id="2"></span>These preliminary visions are veils.
3.  <span id="3"></span>The bird sacred to Juno, the feminine
    counterpart of Jupiter, whose Energy is about to appear.
4.  <span id="4"></span>The Chasmalim, "The brilliant ones", are the
    Chior of Angels which pertain to Jupiter.
5.  <span id="5"></span>This unification is necessary to all true
    comprehension.
6.  <span id="6"></span>The Wheel of Fortune (so called); Atu X is the
    Wheel of the Samsara whose spokes are the Three Gunas, the three
    fundamental Modes of Energy, Sattvas, Rajas, and Tamas. See also
    *Book of Lies*, Cap. 78.
7.  <span id="7"></span>The symbolism of the Table (see 22nd Aire) still
    retains its prominence. 7 is the number of the Inferiors, of the
    Feminine Perfection. 3 x 49 = 147 = {HEB:Heh} {HEB:Vau} {HEB:Heh}
    {HEB:Yod} + {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Aleph} +
    {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Lamed} {HEB:Gemel}{HEB:Aleph} +
    {HEB:Yod}{HEB:Nun}{HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Aleph} = the Four Names of god
    used in the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. Thus there is here the
    symbolism of the Fourfold Regimen (Tetragrammaton) implied in 3 x 7
    x 7.
8.  <span id="8"></span>Hand = {HEB:Yod} = {HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod}
    = 20 = K = 4. But also the first is itself K. There is, however, an
    esoteric doctrine in this phrase. {HEB:Yod} is the spermatozoon, the
    source of all Spiritual Energy, the Minute Point, Hadit, the
    foundation of the Alphabet, (Hebrew). But also K =
    {HEB:Peh-final}{HEB:Koph} = 100 = 10 x 10 = {HEB:Yod} x {HEB:Yod};
    and K and P are the initials of Ketis and {GRK:theta} {GRK:alpha}
    {GRK:lambda} {GRK:lambda}{GRK:omicron}{GRK:sigma} whose union
    releases {HEB:Yod}. Thus the Universe is shown as being set in
    motion by Love under Will. See *Book of Lies*, Cap. 43.
9.  <span id="9"></span>See the usual drawing of Atu X by minor
    initiates.
10. <span id="10"></span>The symbolism here assumes the form of *Liber
    LXV*. It is simpler and therefore more difficult than the sevenfold.
    The counter charges become more frequent; the Seer is being led up
    to the state in which opposites are not only equal, but identical.
11. <span id="11"></span>All unbalanced symbols are necessarily evil.
    They distract the attention from the true object of Vision, and so
    destroy Concentration.
12. <span id="12"></span>Note that no hostile force is hurtful. The
    enemy is always oneself.
13. <span id="13"></span>The attacks are against Nephesch, Ruach, and
    Neshama respectively.
14. <span id="14"></span>When the aspiration (Neshama), the natural
    protection against all lower forces, is sullied, befooled, or
    weakened, the wretch becomes an easy prey to grosser forms of
    temptation. We see in fact only too often that a man of the utmost
    probity and intellectual integrity, who errs in some strictly
    spiritual matter, lose every trace of rationality, and throw off all
    moral restraint, becoming the helpless victim of ludicrous and
    hideous temptations which had never threatened him before in his
    whole life. His nature is so radically corrupted that his friends
    believe him to have become insane. But his fall is quite logical, as
    a tumbling steeple may crush the perfectly sound structures beneath
    it.
15. <span id="15"></span>It is the superficial appeal of the idea of
    "Jesus" to the sentimental type of aspiration (the vilest parody of
    Neschamah is this pollution by the least virile elements of Nephesh)
    that has made possible the corruption implied in the doctrines of
    Sin and Vicarious Atonement. From this error have sprung the
    putrefaction of the reasoning faculties, and the suppression of all
    clear thinking, and the abominations of greed, persecution and the
    rest.
16. <span id="16"></span>{Salt} for Neschamah; {Mercury} for Ruach;
    {Sulphur} for Nephesch.
17. <span id="17"></span>N.O.X. = {HEB:Tzaddi}{HEB:Ayin}{HEB:Nun} = 210.
    {Earth} represents the reduction of the Dyad to Unity by Love under
    Will, and thence to 0 by dissolution in Nuit. It is here used by the
    Seer to destroy all positive symbols, for the true Wheel (apart from
    ornaments) is the circle, Nuit Herself.
18. <span id="18"></span>Note the above-the-Abyss-consciousness. Cf. "I
    who am all, and made it all, abide its separate Lord." (Bhagavad
    Gita)
19. <span id="19"></span>This personality-paradox is characteristic of
    visions of similar exaltation. It constitutes an essential
    difficulty of expression superadded to that natural to the
    description of things seen and heard, which are yet not subject to
    the ordinary Laws of perception.
20. <span id="20"></span>See previous note on Falutli.
21. <span id="21"></span>These are Solar, not Jupiterian deities. The
    Jupiter of the Wheel is that Invisible Energy, whom one can only
    divine from his Hand, his means of Expression. He is Amoun, the
    Concealed One, whose plumes are Truth, and whose Phallus is the
    Middle Pillar, the Shivalingam. We hind accordingly that these Solar
    Deities, who spring from the manifested Jupiter (as it at first
    sight appears) are soon recognized in their deeper nature.
22. <span id="22"></span>Change = Stability. 2x = 9{square x}. See the
    11th Aethyr. Again this series of paradoxes (implied in the
    equations 0x = 0{square x}, 1x = 10{squarex}, etc.) is of the
    essence of the Aire.
23. <span id="23"></span>See any true Image of Shiva, who dances upon
    the Yogi, whom he has destroyed in the Union of Love.
24. <span id="24"></span>Phtah, the still and silent Creative Energy.
25. <span id="25"></span>That is, the form of the Seer is now the Earth
    itself, the Malkuth at the other end of the scale from, yet
    identical with, His Kether.
26. <span id="26"></span>See note 5, page 44. Any vision as exalted as
    this must obviously be indicible. The plastic form of the
    expression, the definite character of the shapes, colours, and
    numbers employed, is far better mnemonically than the vaguely
    beatific outbursts customary in the records usually offered by
    Mystics.
27. <span id="27"></span>The psychology of the previous note explained
    at length.
28. <span id="28"></span>In previous visions the Angel of the Aethyr has
    always been peculiar to his Aire. Even in ZAA, where the Angel is
    Luna, and the Vision represents the lustration of the Lunar Body
    (the Automatic Consciousness) of the Seer, He was not so wholly
    involved. For his normal consciousness was above that which the
    Aethyr affected.
29. <span id="29"></span>It seems that the seer recognized in this
    Aethyr, the Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel.
30. <span id="30"></span>In the Crossing of the Abyss by the Seer ("The
    Temple Of Solomon the King", *Equinox* I, No. Viii, pp. 9-13) during
    his Burma-China journey, he accomplished the meditation called
    Sammasati. He became aware of his True Will, of the purpose for
    which he had undertaken Incarnation. And this was expressed thus: to
    aid Mankind to take the Next Step. And at the time he understood
    this as meaning: to lead them to aspire to the Knowledge and
    Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.
31. <span id="31"></span>*Liber LXV* describes this attainment in the
    fullest detail. The first quotation is from *Liber VII*, Cap. VI,
    verse 35. The second is from *Liber LXV*, Chapter III, v. 62. (The
    persons are transposed --- "I" to "Thou", etc.)
32. <span id="32"></span>The splendour of the Vision would have made too
    rapid a return a shock intolerable to human weakness.
33. <span id="33"></span>It was done. --- O.V.
34. <span id="34"></span>The Seer had not previously experienced so
    intense a Communion and had contributed his physical energy to
    maintain it. This was, of course, an error.
