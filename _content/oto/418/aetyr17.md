**The Cry of the 17th Aethyr,  
Which is Called TAN**[**1**](#1)

Into the stone there first cometh the head of a dragon, and then the
Angel Madimi[**2**](#2). She is not the mere elemental that one would
suppose from the account of Casaubon. I enquire why her form is
different.

She says: Since all things are God, in all things thou seest just so
much of God as thy capacity affordeth thee[**3**](#3). But behold! Thou
must pierce deeply into this Aethyr before true images
appear[**4**](#4). For TAN is that which transformeth judgment into
justice[**5**](#5). BAL is the sword, and TAN the balances[**6**](#6).

A pair of balances appears in the stone, and on the bar of the balance
is written: Motion about a point is iniquity[**7**](#7).

And behind the balances is a plume, luminous, azure[**8**](#8). And
somehow connected with the plume, but I cannot divine how, are these
words: Breath is iniquity[**9**](#9). (That is, any wind must stir the
feather of truth.)

And behind the plume is a shining filament of quartz, suspended
vertically from the abyss to the abyss[**10**](#10). And in the midst is
a winged disk[**11**](#11) of some extremely delicate, translucent
substance, on which is written in the "dagger" alphabet: Torsion is
iniquity[**12**](#12). (This means, that the Rashith Ha-Gilgalim is the
first appearance of evil.[**13**](#13))

And now an Angel appears, like as he were carven in black diamonds. And
he cries: Woe unto the Second, whom all nations of men call the
First[**14**](#14). Woe unto the First, whom all grades of Adepts call
the First[**15**](#15). Woe unto me, for I, even as they, have
worshipped him. But she is whose paps are the galaxies[**16**](#16), and
he that never shall be known[**17**](#17), in them is no motion. For the
infinite Without filleth all and moveth not[**18**](#18), and the
infinite Within goeth indeed[**19**](#19); but it is no odds, else were
the space-marks confounded[**20**](#20).

And now the Angel is but a shining speck of blackness in the midst of a
tremendous sphere of liquid and vibrating light, at first gold, then
becoming green, and lastly pure blue[**21**](#21). And I see that the
green of Libra is made up of the yellow of air and the blue of water,
swords and cups, judgment and mercy[**22**](#22). And this word TAN
meaneth mercy[**23**](#23). And the feather of Maat is blue because the
truth of justice is mercy[**24**](#24). And a voice cometh, as it were
the music of the ripples of the surface of the sphere: Truth is delight
[**25**](#25). (This means that the Truth of the universe is delight.)

Another voice cometh; it is the voice of a mighty Angel, all in silver;
the scales of his armour and the plumes of his wings are like
mother-of-pearl in a framework of silver[**26**](#26). And he sayeth:
Justice is the equity that ye have made for yourselves between truth and
falsehood. But in Truth there is nothing of this, for there is only
Truth. Your falsehood is but a little falser than your
truth[**27**](#27). Yet by your truth shall ye come to Truth. Your truth
is your troth with Adonai the Beloved one[**28**](#28). And the Chymical
Marriage of the Alchemists beginneth with a Weighing, and he that is not
found wanting hath within him one spark of fire, so dense and so intense
that it cannot be moved, through all the winds of heaven should clamour
against it, and all the waters of the abyss surge against it, and all
the multitude of the earths heap themselves upon it to smother it. Nay,
it shall not be moved[**29**](#29).

And this is the fire of which it is written: "Hear thou the voice of
fire!" And the voice of fire is in the second chapter of *The Book of
the Law*[**30**](#30), that is revealed unto him that is a score and
half a score and three that are scores, and six, by Aiwass, that is his
guardian, the mighty Angel that extendeth from the first unto the last,
and maketh known the mysteries that are beyond. And the method and the
form of invocation whereby a man shall attain to the knowledge and
conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel shall be given unto thee in the
proper place[**31**](#31), and seeing that the word is deadlier than
lightning, do thou meditate straitly thereupon, solitary, in a place
where is no living thing visible, but only the light of the sun. And thy
head shall be bare[**32**](#32). Thus mayest thou become fitted to
receive this, the holiest of the Mysteries. And it is the holiest of the
Mysteries because it is the Next Step. And those Mysteries which lie
beyond, though they be holier, are not holy unto thee, but only remote.
(The sense of this passage seems to be, that the holiness of a thing
implies its personal relation with one, just as one cannot blaspheme an
unknown god, because one does not know what to say to annoy him. And
this explains the perfect inefficiency of those who try to insult the
saints; the most violent attacks are very often merely clumsy
compliments.)

Now the Angel is spread completely over the globe, a dewy film of silver
upon that luminous blue.

And a great voice cries: Behold the Queen of Heaven, how she hath woven
her robes from the loom of justice[**33**](#33). For as that straight
path of the Arrow cleaving the Rainbow became righteousness in her that
sitteth in the hall of double truth[**34**](#34), so at last is she
exalted unto the throne of the High Priestess, the Priestess of the
Silver Star, wherein also is thine Angel made manifest[**35**](#35). And
this is the mystery of the camel that is ten days in the desert, and is
not athirst, because he hath within him that water which is the dew
distilled from the the night of Nuit[**36**](#36). Triple is the cord of
silver, that it may be not loosed; and three score and half a score and
three is the number of the name of my name[**37**](#37), for that the
ineffable wisdom, that also is of the sphere of the stars, informeth
me[**38**](#38). Thus am I crowned with the triangle that is about the
eye, and therefore is my number three[**39**](#39). And in me there is
no imperfection, because through me descendeth the influence of
TARO[**40**](#40). And that is also the number of Aiwass the mighty
Angel, the Minister of Silence.

And even as the shew-stone burneth thy forehead with its intolerable
flame, so he who hath known me, though but from afar, is marked out and
chosen among men, and he shall never turn back or turn aside, for he
hath made the link that is not to be broken, nay, not by the malice of
the Four Great Princes of evil of the world, nor by Chorozon, that
mighty Devil, nor by the wrath of God, nor by the affliction and
feebleness of the soul.

Yet with this assurance be not thou content; for though thou hast the
wings of the Eagle, they are vain, except they be joined to the
shoulders of the Bull. Now, therefore, I send forth a shaft of my light,
even as a ladder let down from the heaven upon the earth, and by this
black cross of Themis that I hold before thine eyes, do I swear unto
thee that the path shall be open henceforth for evermore.

There is a clash of a myriad silver cymbals, and silence. And then three
times a note is struck upon a bell, which sounds like my holy Tibetan
bell, that is made of electrum magicum[**41**](#41).

I am happily returned unto the earth.

Bou-Sada.  
December 2, 1909. 12:15 - 2 a.m.

1.  <span id="1"></span>TAN = {Leo}{Taurus}{Scorpio} =
    {HEB:Gemel}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Nun} = 59. This number is a prime,
    representing the Yoni demanding "justice". This Aethyr instructs the
    candidate in the formula of justice, of Equilibrium.
2.  <span id="2"></span>See Casaubon's edition of the Sixth book of Dr.
    Dee's "Conversations with some Spirits."
3.  <span id="3"></span>A profound truth of universal application. The
    master-key to any man's character is his appreciation of the
    universe. To one, Pan means terror and madness, to another, the
    All-God.
4.  <span id="4"></span>This is more and more the case as we progress.
5.  <span id="5"></span>Judgment --- the unmitigated feminine, the
    severity of sterility. Justice --- she is satisfied by the sword
    (phallus) and balances (testes) as shown in Atu XIII. The symbolism
    of the letter Lamed must be very thoroughly studied. It represents
    the flux of the universe in extension. Contrast this positive
    equilibrium with the negative, Aleph. The two together form AL (the
    title of *The Book of the Law* ) which expresses the universe in its
    phases, 0 and 2.
6.  <span id="6"></span>The Enochian word for Justice used at the end of
    the Call of the [30 Aethyrs](aetyr30) is BALATANU, (the 2nd A and
    the U merely support their constonants L and N). Bal is Hebrew for
    Lord, i.e. the phallus. See previous note.
7.  <span id="7"></span>It disturbs the simplicity, introducing a new
    dimension.
8.  <span id="8"></span>The blue feather is Maat, the Goddess of Truth.
9.  <span id="9"></span>Breath implies duality, vibration. It thus
    disturbs peace and silence.
10. <span id="10"></span>The middle pillar of the Tree of Life. Quartz,
    perhaps as auriferous.
11. <span id="11"></span>The winged disk = Hadit, i.e. any point which
    one chooses to consider as being the centre from which to
    contemplate the universe.
12. <span id="12"></span>To twist one's point of view is to obtain a
    false idea.
13. <span id="13"></span>The "Beginning of Whirling Motions" introduces
    duality.
14. <span id="14"></span>The Demiurgos, Microprosopus, the Black
    Reflected Countenance, the Creator. He must be distinguished from
    the Logos. The difference is that the Demiurge creates on his own
    account; he is not like the Logos, the transmitter of Energy of
    Kether, and its formulation in a Word.
15. <span id="15"></span>Macroposopus himself. For in the ontology of
    the New Aeon, he is no longer the unique and supreme Point-of-View,
    to which every ego is subsidiary and must conform.
16. <span id="16"></span>Nuit (See Liber LXV, V, v. 65.)
17. <span id="17"></span>Hadit (See *AL*, II, v. 4)
18. <span id="18"></span>Space cannot move, being an idea invented to
    explain motion. 9. See *AL*, II, v. 7)
19. <span id="19"></span>See *Liber AL vel Legis*, II, v. 7.
20. <span id="20"></span>i.e. it does not matter what mode we choose to
    represent these ideas for if it did, we should be unable to measure
    phenomena at all.
21. <span id="21"></span>The outburst is realized as Love (Venus =
    green). The green light that comes through thin lamin of gold. And
    this is absorbed in the true blue of Nuit --- its goal.
22. <span id="22"></span>Severity and Mercy (Geburah and Chesed) are
    joined by the reciprocating path of Leo. This is Atu IX {WEH Note:
    SIC. Should be Atu XI} countercharged with Atu VIII (Libra). Thus
    Leo, the strength of the Sun, life itself, is one with Libra,
    justice; for the letter Lamed signifies the Universe in extension.
23. <span id="23"></span>TAN is given in above as meaning the Balances.
    Thus, as shown in the previous note, the truth of Justice is Mercy.
    Hence, to aim at Mercy, which is an idea without measure, and
    therefore incommensurable with Truth, is to invoke Justice. The
    injunction is: Be strictly just, and you will find that you have
    accomplished the true Work of Love.
24. <span id="24"></span>See previous note. The blue is again that of
    Nuit. Justice is only complete when the disturbance of positive
    existence is annulled by absorption into the Body of Our Lady of the
    Stars.
25. <span id="25"></span>See *AL*, II, v.9. "Remember all ye that
    existence is pure joy;" et al.
26. <span id="26"></span>This silver is the queen scale of Luna, the
    reflection in positive material nature of the personified idea of
    Nuit. The angel appears in the path of Gimel uniting Tiphareth with
    Kether. He is Atu II. See infra.
27. <span id="27"></span>Human justice is a compromise intended to meet
    an admittedly false situation. Cf. Lao-tse: Benevolence and
    righteousness only appear when all naturalness is gone.
28. <span id="28"></span>Hence the justice of making the Attainment of
    the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is the
    next step. The original evil is the separation from Him; so the only
    approximation to truth is one's oath to Him.
29. <span id="29"></span>This spark is Hadit; (hence the reference to
    *Lib. AL*, II) he cannot be moved because he is already in motion at
    the limit of velocity.
30. <span id="30"></span>The Oracle of Zoroaster says: "And when, after
    all the phantoms are vanished shall appear that holy and formless
    fire, that fire which darts and flashes throughout the depths of the
    universe --- hear thou the voice of the fire!" And this is the
    utterance of Hadit, the deepest expression of one's inmost point of
    view.
31. <span id="31"></span>See 8th Aire.
32. <span id="32"></span>This I performed in a sort of cave upon the
    ridge of a great mountain in the Desert near Bou-Sada at 12-3 p.m.
    on Dec. 2.
33. <span id="33"></span>This blue and silver of Luna, the "queen of
    heaven" (in King and Queen scales) are said to be derived from the
    justice in her true nature. This justice refers to her point on the
    Tree; the troth with Adonai.
34. <span id="34"></span>The arrow = Sagittarius = blue. Its ruler =
    Jupiter = blue (Queen scale) = Righteousness. The plumes of Maat,
    are blue.
35. <span id="35"></span>Here we are asked to note a certain
    correspondence of ascending vibration. {HEB:Samekh} = {Sagittarius},
    {HEB:Lamed} = {Libra}, {HEB:Gemel} = {Moon}. {GRK:Lambda}
    {GRK:Gamma} {GRK:Sigma} are the consonants of Logos. We shall see
    later an important doctrine drawn from this special association of
    these three letters. The Holy Guardian Angel appears as {HEB:Gemel}
    because of its position on the Tree.
36. <span id="36"></span>{HEB:Gemel} means camel. The ten days are the
    7x10 years of normal life. Man can go through that desert, nourished
    by the Knowledge and Conversation of the H.G.A.
37. <span id="37"></span>73 = {HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Mem}{HEB:Gemel}, a camel.
    Triple, for {HEB:Gemel} = 3. The cord of silver; the lunar path
    descending from Kether.
38. <span id="38"></span>Wisdom = {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Mem}{HEB:Koph}{HEB:Chet}
    = 73. Mazloth, the sphere of the Stars, pertains to Chokmah.
39. <span id="39"></span>The Eye --- {HEB:Ayin} = 70. 3 + 70 = 73. 73 is
    is here explained as the Eye in the Triangle. So Aiwass is the Eye
    in the Star of Hermes, the messenger, whose formula is 418 =
    {HEB:Chet}
40. <span id="40"></span>TARO has 78 symbols and 78 =
    {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Zain} {HEB:Mem}, the influence that
    descends from the Most Holy Ancient One, Kether, and therefore
    referred to {HEB:Gemel}. The equation 78 = Aiwass; at this time, the
    Seer thought that Aiwass was spelled {HEB:Samekh} {HEB:Aleph}
    {HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Aleph} = 78 {WEH Note: TS has "418"},
    Whereas, as he found later, {HEB:Zain}{HEB:Vau} {HEB:Yod} {HEB:Ayin}
    = 93 and {GRK:Alpha} {GRK:iota} {GRK:digamma}
    {GRK:alpha}{GRK:sigma}{GRK:sigma} = 418. But 78 is actually the
    number of Aiwass in another way.
41. <span id="41"></span>Electrum magicum is an alloy of the seven
    sacred metals, each being added at a moment chosen for its
    astrological advantages.
