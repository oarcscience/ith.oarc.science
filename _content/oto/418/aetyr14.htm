        Which is Called UTI</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
      <p>There come into the stone a white goat, a green dragon, and a tawny bull<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. 
        But they pass away immediately. There is a veil of such darkness before 
        the Aethyr that it seems impossible to pierce it. But there is a voice 
        saying: Behold, the Great One of the Night of Time<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a> 
        stirreth, and with his tail he churneth up the slime, and of the foam 
        thereof shall he make stars. And in the battle of the Python<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a> 
        and the Sphinx shall the glory be to the Sphinx, but the victory to the 
        Python. </p>
      <p>Now the veil of darkness is formed of a very great number of exceedingly 
        fine black veils, and one tears them off one at a time. And the voice 
        says, There is no light or knowledge or beauty or stability<a href="#5"><font
        size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a> in the Kingdom of the Grave, whither 
        thou goest. And the worm is crowned. All that thou wast hath he eaten 
        up, and all that thou art is his pasture until to-morrow. And all that 
        thou shalt be is nothing. Thou who wouldst enter the domain of the Great 
        One of the Night of Time, this burden must thou take up. Deepen not a 
        superficies<a href="#6"><font
        size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>But I go on tearing down the veil that I may behold the vision of UTI, 
        and hear the voice thererof. And there is a voice: He hath drawn the black 
        bean. And another voice answers it: Not otherwise could he plant the Rose. 
        And the first voice: He hath drunk of the waters of death. The answer: 
        Not otherwise could he water the Rose. And the first voice: He hath burnt 
        himself at the Fires of life. And the answer: Not otherwise could he sun 
        the Rose. And the first voice is so faint that I cannot hear it. But the 
        answer is: Not otherwise could he pluck the Rose<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>And still I go on, struggling with the blackness. Now there is an earthquake. 
        The veil is torn into thousands of pieces that go flying away in a whirling 
        wind. And there is an all-glorious Angel before me, standing in the sign 
        of Apophis and Typhon<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. 
        On his Forehead is a star, but all about him is darkness, and the crying 
        of beasts. And there are lamps moving in the darkness. </p>
      <p>And the Angel says: Depart! For thou must invoke me only in the darkness. 
        Therein will I appear, and reveal unto thee the Mystery of UTI. For the 
        Mystery thereof is great and terrible. And it shall not be spoken in sight 
        of the sun. </p>
      <p>Therefore I withdraw myself. (Thus far the vision upon Da'leh </p>
      <p>Addin, a mountain in the desert near Bou-Sada.<a
        href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>)<br>
        December 3, 2:50-3:15 p.m. </p>
      <p align="center"><em>The Angel re-appears.</em> </p>
      <p>The blackness gathers about, so thick, so clinging, so penetrating, so 
        oppressive, that all the other darkness that I have ever conceived would 
        be like bright light beside it<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>His voice comes in a whisper: O thou that art master of the fifty gates 
        of Understanding, is not my mother a black woman? O thou that art master 
        of the Pentagram, is not the egg of spirit a black egg<a href="#11"><font
        size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>? Here abideth terror, and the 
        blind ache of the Soul, and lo! even I, who am the sole light, a spark 
        shut up, stand in the sign of Apophis and Typhon. </p>
      <p>I am the snake that devoureth the spirit of man with the lust of light. 
        I am the sightless storm in the night that wrappeth the world about with 
        desolation. Chaos is my name, and thick darkness. Know thou that the darkness 
        of the earth is ruddy, and the darkness of the air is grey, but the darkness 
        of the soul is utter blackness. </p>
      <p>The egg of the spirit is a basilisk egg, and the gates of the understanding 
        are fifty, that is the sign of the Scorpion<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. 
        The pillars about the neophyte are crowned with flame, and the vault of 
        the Adepts is lighted by the Rose. And in the abyss is the eye of the 
        hawk<a href="#13"><font
        size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. But upon the great sea shall 
        the Master of the Temple find neither star nor moon. </p>
      <p>And I was about to answer him: &quot;The light is within me.&quot; But 
        before I could frame the words, he answered me with the great word that 
        is the Key of the Abyss<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. 
        And he said: Thou hast entered the night; dost thou yet lust for day? 
        Sorrow is my name, and affliction. I am girt about with tribulation. Here 
        still hangs the Crucified One, and here the Mother weeps over the children 
        that she hath not borne. Sterility is my name, and desolation. Intolerable 
        is thine ache, and incurable thy wound. I said, Let the darkness cover 
        me; and behold, I am compassed about with the blackness that hath no name. 
        O thou, who hast cast down the light into the earth, so must thou do for 
        ever. And the light of the sun shall not shine upon thee, and the moon 
        shall not lend thee of her lustre, and the stars shall be hidden, because 
        thou art passed beyond these things, beyond the need of these things, 
        beyond the desire of these things. </p>
      <p>What I thought were shapes of rocks, rather felt than seen, now appear 
        to be veiled Masters, sitting absolutely still and silent. Nor can any 
        one be distinguished from the others. </p>
      <p>And the Angel sayeth: Behold where thine Angel hath led thee! Thou didst 
        ask fame, power and pleasure, health and wealth and love, and strength, 
        and length of days. Thou didst hold life with eight tentacles, like an 
        octopus. Thou didst seek the four powers and the seven delights and the 
        twelve emancipations and the two and twenty Privileges and the nine and 
        forty Manifestations, and lo! thou art become as one of These. Bowed are 
        their backs, whereon resteth the universe. Veiled are their faces, that 
        have beheld the glory Ineffable. </p>
      <p>These adepts seem like Pyramids --- their hoods and robes are like Pyramids. 
      </p>
      <p>And the Angel sayeth: Verily is the Pyramid a Temple of Initiation. Verily 
        also is it a tomb<a href="#15"><font
        size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>}. Thinkest thou that there is 
        life within the Masters of the Temple, that sit hooded, encamped upon 
        the Sea? Verily, there is no life in them. </p>
      <p>Their sandals were the pure light, and they have taken them from their 
        feet and cast them down through the abyss, for this Aethyr is holy ground. 
      </p>
      <p>Herein no forms appear, and the vision of God face to face, that is transmuted 
        in the Athanor called dissolution, or hammered into one forge of meditation, 
        is in this place but a blasphemy and a mockery. </p>
      <p>And the Beatific Vision is no more, and the glory of the Most High is 
        no more. There is no more knowledge. There is no more bliss. There is 
        no more power. There is no more beauty. For this is the Palace of Understanding: 
        for thou art one with the Primeval things. </p>
      <p>Drink in the myrrh of my speech, that is bruised with the gall of the 
        roc, and dissolved in the ink of the cuttle-fish, and perfumed with the 
        deadly nightshade. </p>
      <p>This is thy wine, who wast drunk upon the wine of Iacchus. And for bread 
        shalt thou eat salt, O thou on the corn of Ceres that didst wax fat! For 
        as pure being is pure nothing, so is pure wisdom pure ---<a href="#16"><font
        size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>, and so is pure understanding 
        silence, and stillness, and darkness. The eye is called seventy, and the 
        triple Aleph whereby thou perceivest it, divideth into the number of the 
        terrible word that is the Key of the Abyss<a href="#17"><font
        size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>I am Hermes, that am sent from the Father to expound all things discreetly 
        in these the last words that thou shalt hear before thou take thy seat 
        among these, whose eyes are sealed up, and whose ears are stopped, and 
        whose mouths are clenched, who are folded in upon themselves, the liquor 
        of whose bodies is dried up, so that nothing remains but a little pyramid 
        of dust. </p>
      <p>And that bright light of comfort, and that piercing sword of truth, and 
        all that power and beauty that they have made of themselves, is cast from 
        them, as it is written, &quot;I saw Satan like lightning fall from Heaven.&quot; 
        And as a flaming sword is it dropt through the abyss, where the four beasts 
        keep watch and ward. And it appeareth in the heaven of Jupiter<a href="#18"><font
        size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a> as a morning star, or as an evening 
        star<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. And the 
        light thereof shineth even unto the earth, and bringeth hope and help 
        to them that dwell in the darkness of thought, and drink of the poison 
        of life. Fifty are the gates<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a> 
        of understanding, and one hundred and six<a href="#21"><font
        size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a> are the seasons thereof. And the 
        name of every season<a href="#22"><font
        size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a> is Death. </p>
      <p>During all this speech, the figure of the Angel has dwindled and flickered, 
        and now it is gone out. </p>
      <p>And I come back in the body, rushing like a flame in a great wind. And 
        the shew-stone has become warm, and in it is its own light. </p>

          are very well known in Orthodox Hebrew Qabalah. They consist of taking 
          the influence of each of the lower seven Sephiroth upon each other --- 
          7x7=49. When one is perfectly harmonized in this practice, the fiftieth 
          gate, Binah or Understanding, opens. Crowley repeatedly describes his 
          efforts at such a harmonizing, but is ignorant of the significance of 
          this reference to the Fifty Gates in the Cry.}</font></li>
