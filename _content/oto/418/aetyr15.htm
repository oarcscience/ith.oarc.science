      <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 15th Aethyr,<br>
        Which is Called OXO</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
      <p>There appears immediately in the Aethyr a tremendous column of scarlet 
        fire, whirling forth, rebounding, crying aloud. And about it are four 
        columns of green and blue and gold and silver, each inscribed with writings 
        in the character of the dagger. And the column of fire is dancing among 
        the pillars. Now it seems that the fire is but the skirt of the dancer, 
        and the dancer is a mighty god. The vision is overpowering. </p>
      <p>As the dancer whirls, she chants in a strange, slow voice, quickening 
        as she goes: Lo! I gather up every spirit that is pure, and weave him 
        into my vesture of flame. I lick up the lives of men, and their souls 
        sparkle from mine eyes. I am the mighty sorceress, the lust of the spirit. 
        And by my dancing I gather for my mother Nuit the heads of all them that 
        are baptized in the waters of life. I am the lust of the spirit that eateth 
        up the soul of man. I have prepared a feast for the adepts, and they that 
        partake thereof shall see God<a
        href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>Now it is clear what she has woven in her dance; it is the Crimson Rose 
        of 49 Petals, and the Pillars are the Cross with which it is conjoined. 
        And between the pillars shoot out rays of pure green fire; and now all 
        the pillars are golden. She ceases to dance, and dwindles, gathering herself 
        into the centre of the Rose. Now it is seen that the Rose is a vast ampitheatre, 
        with seven tiers, each tier divided into seven partitions. And they that 
        sit in the Amphitheatre are the seven grades of the Order of the Rosy 
        Cross. This Amphitheatre is built of rose-coloured marble, and of its 
        size I can say only that the sun might be used as a ball to be thrown 
        by the players in the arena. But in the arena there is a little altar 
        of emerald<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>, and 
        its top has the heads of the Four Beasts, in turquoise and rock-crystal<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
        And the floor of the arena is ridged like a grating of lapis lazuli<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
        And it is full of pure quicksilver<a href="#6"><font
        size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>Above the altar is a veiled Figure, whose name is Pan. Those in the outer 
        tier adore him as a Man; and in the next tier they adore him as a Goat; 
        and in the next tier they adore him as a Ram; and in the next tier they 
        adore him as a Crab; and in the next tier they adore him as an Ibis; and 
        in the next tier they adore him as a Golden Hawk; and in the next tier 
        they adore him not<a href="#7"><font
        size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>And now the light streameth out from the altar, splashed out by the feet 
        of him that is above it. It is the Holy Twelve-fold Table of OIT<a href="#8"><font
        size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>The voice of him that is above the altar is silence, but the echo thereof 
        cometh back from the walls of the circus, and is speech. And this is the 
        speech: Three and four are the days of a quarter of the moon, and on the 
        seventh day is the sabbath, but thrice four is the Sabbath of the Adepts 
        whereof the form is revealed in the Aethyr ZID; that is the eighth of 
        the Aires<a href="#9"><font
        size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. And the mysteries of the Table 
        shall not be wholly revealed, nor shall they be revealed herein. But thou 
        shalt gather of the sweat of thy brow a pool of clear water wherein this 
        shall be revealed. And of the oil that thou burnest in the midnight shall 
        be gathered together thirteen rivers of blessing; and of the oil and the 
        water I will prepare a wine to intoxicate the young men and the maidens<a
        href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>And now the Table is become the universe; every star is a letter of the 
        Book of Enoch. And the Book of Enoch is drawn therefrom by an inscrutable 
        Mystery, that is known only to the Angels and the Holy Sevenfold Table<a
        href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. While I have 
        been gazing upon this table, an Adept has come forth, one from each tier, 
        except the inmost Tier. </p>
      <p>And the first<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a> 
        drove a dagger into my heart, and tasted the blood, and said: {GRK:chi}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:theta}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:rho} 
        {GRK:omicron}{GRK:sigma} , {GRK:chi}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:theta}{GRK:alpha} 
        {GRK:rho}{GRK:omicron}{GRK:sigma} , {GRK:chi}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:theta} {GRK:alpha} 
        {GRK:rho}{GRK:omicron}{GRK:sigma} , {GRK:chi}{GRK:alpha} {GRK:theta} {GRK:alpha}{GRK:rho}{GRK:omicron} 
        {GRK:sigma} , {GRK:chi} {GRK:alpha}{GRK:theta}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:rho}{GRK:omicron} 
        {GRK:sigma} , {GRK:chi}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:theta}{GRK:alpha}{GRK:rho}{GRK:omicron} 
        {GRK:sigma}<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>And the second<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a> 
        Adept has been testing the muscles of my right arm and shoulder, and he 
        says: fortis, fortis, fortis, fortis, fortis <a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>And the third<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a> 
        Adept examines the skin and tastes the sweat of my left arm, and says: 
        TAN, TAN, TAN, TAN.<a href="#17"><font
        size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a> And the fourth<a
        href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a> Adept examines 
        my neck, and seems to approve, though he says nothing<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>; 
        and he hath opened the right half of my brain, and he makes some examination, 
        and says: &quot;Samajh, samajh, samajh.<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>And the fifth Adept examines the left half of my brain, and then holds 
        up his hand in protest, and says &quot;PLA . . .<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>&quot; 
        (I cannot get the sentence, but the meaning is: In the thick darkness 
        the seed awaiteth spring.) </p>
      <p>And now am I again rapt in contemplation of that universe of letters 
        which are stars. </p>
      <p>The words ORLO, ILRO, TULE are three most secret names of God. They are 
        Magick names, each having an interpretation of the same kind as the interpretation 
        of I.N.R.I., and the name OIT, RLU, LRL, OOE are other names of God, that 
        contain magical formulae, the first to invoke fire; the second, water; 
        the third, air; and the fourth, earth<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>And if the Table be read diagonally, every letter, and every combination 
        of letters, is the name of a devil. And from these are drawn the formulae 
        of evil magick<a
        href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. But the holy 
        letter I above the triad LLL dominateth the Table, and preserveth the 
        peace of the universe<a
        href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>And in the seven talismans about the central Table are contained the 
        Mysteries of drawing forth the letters. And the letters of the circumference 
        declare in glory of Nuit, that beginneth from Aries<a href="#25"><font
        size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>All this while the Adepts must have been chanting as it were an oratorio 
        for seven instruments. And this oratorio hath one dominant theme of rapture. 
        Yet it applieth to every detail of the universe as well as to the whole. 
        And herein is Choronzon brought utterly to ruin, that all his work is 
        against his will, not only in the whole, but in every part thereof, even 
        as a fly that walketh upon a beryl-stone. </p>
      <p>And the tablet blazeth ever brighter till it filleth the whole Aire. 
        And behold! there is is one God therein, and the letters of the stars 
        in his crown, Orion, and the Pleiades, and Aldebaran, and Alpha Centauri, 
        and Cor Leonis, and Cor Scorpionis, and Spica, and the pole-star, and 
        Hercules, and Regulus, and Aquila, and the Ram's Eye. </p>
      <p>And upon a map of the stars shalt thou draw the sigil of that name; and 
        because also some of the letters are alike, thou shalt know that the stars 
        also have tribes and nations<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>. 
        The letter of a star is but the totem thereof. And the letter representeth 
        not the whole nature of the star, but each star must be known by itself 
        in the wisdom of him that hath the Cynocephalus in leash<a href="#27"><font
        size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>And this pertaineth unto the grade of a Magus --- and that is beyond 
        thine. (All this is communicated not by voice, or by writing; and there 
        is no form in the stone, but only the brilliance of the Table. And now 
        I am withdrawn from all that, but the Rosy Cross of 49 petals is set upright 
        upon the summit of a pyramid, and all is dark, because of the exceeding 
        light behind.) </p>
      <p>And there cometh a voice: The fly cried unto the ox, &quot;Beware! Strengthen 
        thyself. Set thy feet firmly upon the earth, for it is my purpose to alight 
        between thy shoulders, and I would not harm thee.&quot; So also are they 
        who wish well unto the Masters of the Pyramid. </p>
      <p>And the bee said unto the flower: &quot;Give me of thine honey,&quot; 
        and the flower gave richly thereof; but the bee, though he wit it not, 
        carried the seed of the flower into many fields of sun. So also are they 
        that take unto themselves the Masters of the Pyramid for servants. </p>
      <p>Now the exceeding light that was behind the Pyramid, and the Rosy Cross 
        that is set thereon, hath fulfilled the whole Aire. The black Pyramid 
        is like the back of a black diamond. Also the Rosy Cross is loosened, 
        and the petals of the Rose are the mingled hues of sunset and of dawn; 
        and the Cross is the Golden light of noon, and in the heart of the Rose 
        there is the secret light that men call midnight. </p>
      <p>And a voice: &quot;Glory to God and thanksgiving to God, and there is 
        no God but God. And He is exalted; He is great; and in the Sevenfold Table 
        is His Name writ openly, and in the Twelvefold Table is His Name concealed.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>And the Pyramid casts a shadow of itself into the sky, and the shadow 
        spreads over the whole stone. And an angel clad in blue and scarlet, with 
        golden wings and plumes of purple fire, comes forth and scatters disks 
        of green and gold, filing all the Aire. And they become swiftly-whirling 
        wheels, singing together. </p>
      <p>And the voice of the angel cries: Gather up thy garments about thee<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>, 
        O thou that hast entered the circle of the Sabbath; for in thy grave-clothes 
        shouldest thou behold the resurrection. </p>
      <p>The flesh hangeth upon thee like his rags upon a beggar that is a pilgrim 
        to the shrine of the Exalted One. Nevertheless, bear them bravely, and 
        rejoice in the beauty thereof, for the company of the pilgrims is a glad 
        company, and they have no care, and with song and dance and wine and fair 
        women do they make merry. And every hostel is their place, and every maid 
        their queen. </p>
      <p>Gather up thy garments about thee, I say, for the voice of the Aethyr, 
        that is the voice of the Aeon, is ended, and thou art absorbed into the 
        lesser night, and caught in the web of the light of thy mother in the 
        word ARBADAHARBA<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>And now the five and the six are divorced<a href="#30"><font
        size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>, and I am come again within my 
        body. </p>
