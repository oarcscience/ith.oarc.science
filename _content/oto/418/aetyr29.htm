<h1 align="center"><strong>The Cry of the 29th Aethyr,<br>
  Which is Called RII</strong><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a> 
</h1>
<p>The sky appears covered with stars of gold; the background is of green. But 
  the impression is also of darkness. </p>
<p>An immense eagle-angel is before me. His wings seem to hide all the Heaven<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>He cried aloud saying: The Voice of the Lord upon the Waters: the Terror of 
  God upon Mankind. The voice of the Lord maketh the Skies to tremble: the Stars 
  are troubled: the Aires fall. The First Voice Speaketh and saith: Cursed, cursed 
  be the Earth, for her iniquity is great. Oh Lord! Let Thy Mercy be lost in the 
  great Deep! Open thine eyes of Flame and Light, O God, upon the wicked! Lighten 
  thine Eyes! The Clamour of Thy Voice, let it smite down the Mountains! </p>
<p>Let us not see it! Cover we our eyes, lest we see the End of Man. </p>
<p>Close we our ears, lest we hear the cry of Woman. </p>
<p>Let none speak of it: let none write it: I, I am troubled, my eyes are moist 
  with dews of terror: surely the Bitterness of Death is past. </p>
<p>And I turned me to the South and lo! a great lion<a
        href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a> as wounded and 
  perplexed. </p>
<p>He cried: I have conquered! Let the Sons of Earth keep silence; for my Name 
  is become as That of Death! </p>
<p>When will men learn the Mysteries of Creation? </p>
<p>How much more those of the Dissolution (and the Pang of Fire)? </p>
<p>I turned me to the West and there was a great Bull<a
        href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>; White with horns 
  of White and Black and Gold. His mouth was scarlet and his eyes as Sapphire 
  stones. With a great sword he shore the skies asunder, and amid the silver flashes 
  of the steel grew lightnings and deep clouds of Indigo. </p>
<p>He spake: It is finished! My mother hath unveiled herself! </p>
<p>My sister hath violated herself! The life of things hath disclosed its Mystery. 
</p>
<p>The work of the Moon is done! Motion is ended for ever! </p>
<p>Clipped are the eagle's wings: but my Shoulders have not lost their strength. 
</p>
<p>I heard a Great Voice from above crying: Thou liest! For the Volatile hath 
  indeed fixed itself; but it hath arisen above thy sight. The World is desert: 
  but the Abodes of the House of my Father are peopled; and His Throne is crusted 
  over with white Brilliant Stars, a lustre of bright gems. </p>
<p>In the North is a Man upon a Great Horse, having a Scourge and Balances<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a> 
  in his hand (or a long spear glitters at his back or in his hand). He is clothed 
  in black velvet and his face is stern and terrible. </p>
<p>He spake saying: I have judged! It is the end: the gate of the beginning. Look 
  in the Beneath and thou shalt see a new world! </p>
<p>I looked and saw a great abyss and a dark funnel of whirling waters or fixed 
  airs, wherein were cities and monsters and trees and atoms and mountains and 
  little flames (being souls) and all the material of an universe. </p>
<p>And all are sucked down one by one, as necessity hath ordained. For below is 
  a glittering jewelled globe of gold and azure, set in a World of Stars<a href="#6"><font
        size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>And there came a Voice from the Abyss, saying: &quot;Thou seest the Current 
  of Destiny! Canst thou change one atom in its path? I am Destiny. Dost thou 
  think to control me? for who can move my course?&quot; </p>
<p>And there falleth a thunderbolt therein: a catastrophe of explosion: and all 
  is shattered. And I saw above me a Vast Arm reach down, dark and terrible, and 
  a voice cried: I AM ETERNITY. </p>
<p>And a great mingled cry arose: &quot;No! no! no! All is changed; all is confounded; 
  naught is ordered: the white is stained with blood: the black is kissed of the 
  Christ! Return! Return! It is a new chaos that thou findest here: chaos for 
  thee: for us it is the skeleton of a New Truth!&quot; </p>
<p>I said: Tell me this truth: for I have conjured ye by the Mighty Names of God, 
  the which ye cannot but obey. </p>
<p>The voice said: </p>
<p>Light is consumed as a child in the Womb of its Mother to develop itself anew. 
  But pain and sorrow infinite, and darkness are invoked. For this child riseth 
  up within his Mother and doth crucify himself within her bosom. He extendeth 
  his arms in the arms of his Mother and the Light becometh fivefold<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>Lux in Luce, </p>
<p>Christus in Cruce; </p>
<p>Tarot and Mezla. </p>
<p>Deo Duce </p>
<p>Sempiterno<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>And be the glory for ever and ever unto the Most High God, Amen! </p>
<p>Then I returned within my body, giving glory unto the Lord of Light and of 
  the Darkness. In Saecula Saeculorum. Amen! </p>
<p>(On composing myself to sleep, I was shewn an extremely brilliant {HEB:Dalet}<a href="#9"><font
        size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a> in the Character of the Passing 
  of the River, in an egg of white light. And I take this as the best of Omens. 
  The letter was extremely vivid and indeed apparently physical. Almost a Dhyana.) 
</p>
<p>November 17, 1900, Die. </p>
<p>A NOTE<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a> </p>
<p>Concerning the thirty Aethyrs: </p>
<p>The Visions of the 29th and 30th Aethyrs were given to me in Mexico in August<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>, 
  1900, and I am now (23.11.9) trying to get the rest. It is to be remarked that 
  the last three aethyrs have ten angels attributed to them<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>, 
  and they therefore represent the ten Sephiroth. Yet these ten form but one, 
  a Malkuth-pendant to the next three, and so on, each set being, as it were, 
  absorbed in the higher. The last set consists, therefore, of the first three 
  aethyrs with the remaining twenty-seven as their Malkuth. And the letters of 
  the first three aethyrs are the key- sigils of the most exalted interpretation 
  of the Sephiroth. </p>
<p>I is therefore Kether; </p>
<p>L, Chokmah and Binah; </p>
<p>A, Chesed; </p>
<p>N, Geburah; </p>
<p>R, Tiphereth; </p>
<p>Z, Netzach; </p>
<p>N, Hod; </p>
<p>O, Jesod. </p>
<p>The geomantic correspondences of the Enochian alphabet form a sublime commentary. 
</p>
<p>Note that the total angels of the aethyrs are 91, the numeration of Amen. </p>

    or that he is about to be destroyed. He is in the West, i.e. going into Oblivion.

    individual Consciousness.</font></li>
