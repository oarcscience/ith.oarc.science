<h1 align="center"><strong>The Cry of the 27th Aethyr, <br>
  Which is Called ZAA</strong><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a> 
</h1>
<p>There is an angel with rainbow wings, and his dress is green<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a> 
  with silver, a green veil over silver<a href="#3"><font
        size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a> armour. Flames of many- coloured 
  fire dart from him in all directions. It is a woman of some thirty years old, 
  and she has the moon for a crest, and the moon is blazoned on her heart, and 
  her sandals are curved silver, like the moon. </p>
<p>And she cries: Lonely am I and cold in the wilderness of the stars<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
  For I am the queen of all them that dwell in Heaven, and the queen of all them 
  that are pure upon earth, and the queen of all the sorcerers of hell<a href="#6"><font
        size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>I am the daughter of Nuit, the lady of the stars. And I am the Bride of them 
  that are vowed unto loneliness<a
        href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. And I am the mother 
  of the Dog Cerberus<a href="#8"><font
        size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. One person am I, and three gods<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>And thou who hast blasphemed me shalt suffer knowing me. For I am cold as thou 
  art cold, and burn with thy fire<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. 
  Oh, when shall the war of the Aires and the elements be accomplished<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>? 
</p>
<p>Radiant are these falchions of my brothers, invisibly about me, but the might 
  of the aethyrs beneath my feet beareth me down. And they avail not to sever 
  the Kamailow<a
        href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. There is one 
  in green armour, with green eyes, whose sword is of vegetable fire<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
  They shall avail me. My son is he<a href="#14"><font
        size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>, ---and how shall I bear him that 
  have not known man? </p>
<p>All this time intolerable rays are shooting forth to beat me back or destroy 
  me; but I am encased in an egg of blue-violet, and my form is the form of a 
  man with the head of a golden hawk<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. 
  While I have been observing this, the goddess has kept up a continuous wail, 
  like the baying of a thousand hounds<a
        href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>; and now her 
  voice is deep and guttural and hoarse, and she breathes very rapidly words that 
  I cannot hear. I can hear some of them now. </p>
<p>UNTU LA LA ULULA UMUNA TOFA LAMA LE LI NA AHR IMA TAHARA ELULA ETFOMA UNUNA 
  ARPETI ULU ULU ULU MARABAN ULULU MAHATA ULU ULU LAMASTANA<a href="#17"><font
        size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>And then her voice rises to a shriek, and there is a cauldron<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a> 
  boiling in front of her; and the flames under the cauldron are like unto zinc 
  flames<a href="#19"><font
        size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>, and in the cauldron is the Rose, 
  the Rose of 49 petals<a href="#20"><font
        size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>, seething in it. Over the cauldron 
  she has arched her rainbow wings; and her face is bent over the cauldron, and 
  she is blowing opalescent silvery rings on to the Rose; and each ring as it 
  touches the water bursts into flame, and the Rose takes new colours<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>And now she lifts her head, and raises her hands to heaven, and cries: O Mother<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>, 
  wilt thou never have compassion on the children of earth? Was it not enough 
  that the Rose should be red with the blood of thine heart<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>, 
  and that its petals should be by 7 and by 7? </p>
<p>She is weeping, weeping<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. 
  And the tears grow and fill the whole stone with moons<a
        href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. I can see nothing 
  and hear nothing for the tears, though she keeps on praying. &quot;Take of these 
  pearls<a
        href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>, treasure them 
  in thine heart. Is not the Kingdom of the Abyss accurst?&quot; She points downward 
  to the cauldron; and now in it there is the head of a most cruel dragon<a
        href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>, black and corrupted. 
  I watch, and watch; and nothing happens. </p>
<p>And now the dragon rises out of the cauldron, very long and slim (like Japanese 
  Dragons, but infinitely more terrible), and he blots out the whole sphere of 
  the stone<a
        href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>Then suddenly all is gone, and there is nothing in the stone save brilliant 
  white light and flecks like sparks of golden fire; and there is a ringing, as 
  if bells were being used for anvils. And there is a perfume which I cannot describe; 
  it is like nothing that one can describe, but the suggestion is like lignum 
  aloes<a
        href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. And now all 
  these things are there at once in the same place and time<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>Now a veil of olive and silver<a href="#31"><font
        size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a> is drawn over the stone, only 
  I hear the voice of the angel<a href="#32"><font
        size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a> receding, very sweet and faint 
  and sorrowful, saying: Far off and lonely in the secret stone is the unknown, 
  and interpenetrated is the knowledge with the will and the understanding. I 
  am alone. I am lost, because I am all and in all; and my veil is woven of the 
  green earth and the web of stars. I love; and I am denied, for I have denied 
  myself. Give me those hands, put them against my heart. Is it not cold? Sink, 
  sink, the abyss of time remains. It is not possible that one should come to 
  ZAA. Give me thy face. Let me kiss it with my cold kisses. Ah! Ah! Ah! Fall 
  back from me. The word, the word of the aeon is MAKHASHANAH<a
        href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a>{SUP:1}. And these 
  words shalt thou say backwards: ARARNAY OBOLO MAHARNA TUTULU NOM LAHARA EN NEDIEZO 
  LO SAD FONUSA SOBANA ARANA BINUF LA LA LA ARPAZNA UOHULU<a href="#34"><font
        size="1"><strong>34</strong></font></a>{SUP:2}. when thou wilt call my 
  burden unto appearance, for I who am the Virgin goddess am the pregnant goddess, 
  and I have cast down my burden even unto the borders of the universe<a
        href="#35"><font size="1"><strong>35</strong></font></a>{SUP:3}. They 
  that blaspheme me are stoned, and my veil<a
        href="#36"><font size="1"><strong>36</strong></font></a>{SUP:4} is fallen 
  about me even unto the end of time<a href="#37"><font
        size="1"><strong>37</strong></font></a>{SUP:5}. </p>
<p>Now there arises a great raging of thousands and thousands of mighty warriors 
  flashing through the aethyr so thickly that nothing is to be seen but their 
  swords, which are like blue-gray plumes. And the noise is confused, thousands 
  of battle-cries harmonizing to a roar, like the roar of a monstrous river in 
  flood. And all the stone is dull, dull gray. The life is gone from it<a href="#39"><font size="1"><strong>39</strong></font></a>{SUP:1}. 
</p>
<p>There is no more to see. </p>

    on one whose Formula is 3: 8x = 3{square x}. The Seer &quot;knew&quot; that 
    this Word was <em>not</em> the correct Word, which is Abrahadabra = 418. But 
    on writing it down in Hebrew, as above, he saw that it was the correct word 
    after all. Observe that this proves the Angel to have been an Intelligence 
    not of the Seer's conscious mind. Had he given the Word which the Seer knew, 
    it might have been derived from his subconscious Self. Furthermore, this Word 
    contains more than the mere 418 because of its 8 letters suiting the special 
    Formula required by this particular Angel, whereas the other Word is a general 
    Formula, being of 11 letters, all Magick being referred to 11. so far as ABRAHADABRA 
    is specialized, it refers to the Work of 5x = 6{square x}, there being 5 alephs 
    and 6 other letters. In the Latin script also Makhashanah does have 11 letters. 
    Again, the operation of the Cauldron (above) is described by the 5 consonants 
    of this Word. </font>
