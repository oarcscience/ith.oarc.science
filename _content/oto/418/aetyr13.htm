      <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 13th Aethyr,<br>
        Which is Called ZIM</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
      <p>Into the Stone there cometh an image of shining waters, glistening in 
        the sun. Unfathomable is their beauty, for they are limpid, and the floor 
        is of gold. Yet the sense thereof is of fruitlessness. </p>
      <p>And an Angel cometh forth, of pure pale gold, walking upon the water. 
        Above his head is a rainbow, and the water foams beneath his feet. And 
        he saith: Before his face am I come that hath the thirty-three thunders 
        of increase in his hand. From the golden water shalt thou gather corn<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>All the Aire behind him is gold, but it opens as it were a veil. There 
        are two terrible black giants, wrestling in mortal hatred. And there is 
        a little bird upon a bush, and the bird flaps its wings. Thereat the strength 
        of the giants snaps, and they fall in heaps to the earth, as though all 
        their bones were suddenly broken<a
        href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>And now waves of light roll through the Aethyr, as if they were playing. 
        Therefore suddenly I am in a garden<a
        href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>, upon a terrace 
        of a great castle, that is upon a rocky mountain. In the garden are fountains 
        and many flowers. There are girls also in the garden, tall, slim, delicate 
        and pale. And now I see that the flowers are the girls, for they change 
        from one to another; so varied, and lucent, and harmonious is all this 
        garden, that it seems like a great opal<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>A voice comes: This water which thou seest is called the water of death<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. 
        But NEMO hath filled therefrom our springs. </p>
      <p>And I said: Who is NEMO? </p>
      <p>And the voice answered: A dolphin's tooth, and a ram's horns, and the 
        hand of a man that is hanged, and the phallus of a goat<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. 
        (By this I understand that nun is explained by shin, and he' by resh, 
        and mem by yod, and ayin by tau<a href="#8"><font
        size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. NEMO is therefore called 165 = 
        11 x 15; and is in himself 910 = 91 Amen x 10; and 13 x 70 = The One Eye, 
        <em>Achad Ayin</em>.) </p>
      <p>And now there cometh an Angel into the garden, but he hath not any of 
        the attributes of the former Angels, for he is like a young man, dressed 
        in white linen robes. </p>
      <p>And he saith: No man hath beheld the face of my Father. Therefore he 
        that hath beheld it is called NEMO. And know thou that every man that 
        is called NEMO hath a garden that he tendeth<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
        And every garden that is and flourisheth hath been prepared from the desert 
        by NEMO, watered with the waters that were called death. </p>
      <p>And I say unto him: To what end is the garden prepared? </p>
      <p>And he saith: First for the beauty and delight thereof; and next because 
        it is written, &quot;And Tetragrammaton Elohim planted a garden eastward 
        in Eden.&quot; And lastly, because though every flower bringeth forth 
        a maiden, yet is there one flower that shall bring forth a man-child. 
        And his name shall be called NEMO, when he beholdeth the face of my Father. 
        And he that tendeth the garden seeketh not to single out the flower that 
        shall be NEMO. He doeth naught but tend the garden. </p>
      <p>And I said: Pleasant indeed is the garden<a href="#10"><font
        size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>, and light is the toil of tending 
        it, and great is the reward. </p>
      <p>And he said: Bethink thee that NEMO hath beheld the face of my Father. 
        In Him is only Peace. </p>
      <p>And I said: Are all gardens like unto this garden? </p>
      <p>And he waved his hand, and in the Aire across the valley appeared an 
        island of coral, rosy, with green palms and fruit-trees, in the midst 
        of the bluest of the seas<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>And he waved his hand again, and there appeared a valley shut in by mighty 
        snow mountains, and in it were pleasant streams of water, rushing through, 
        and broad rivers, and lakes covered with lilies<a href="#12"><font
        size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>And he waved his hand again, and there was a vision, as it were of an 
        oasis in the desert<a href="#13"><font
        size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>And again he waved his hand, and there was a dim country with grey rocks, 
        and heather, and gorse, and bracken<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>And he waved his hand yet again, and there was a park, and a small house 
        therein, surrounded by yews<a
        href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. This time the 
        house opens, and I see in it an old man, sitting by a table. He is blind. 
        Yet he writeth in a great book, constantly. I see what he is writing: 
        &quot;The words of the Book are as the leaves of the flowers in the garden. 
        Many indeed of these my songs shall go forth as maidens, but there is 
        one among them, which one I know not, that shall be a man-child, whose 
        name shall be NEMO, when he hath beheld the face of the Father, and become 
        blind.&quot; </p>
      <p>(All this vision is most extraordinarily pleasant and peaceful, entirely 
        without strength or ecstasy, or any positive quality, but equally free 
        from the opposites of any of those qualities.) And the young man seems 
        to read my thought, which is, that I should love to stay in this garden 
        and do nothing for ever; for he sayeth to me: Come with me, and behold 
        how NEMO tendeth his garden<a
        href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>So we enter the earth, and there is a veiled figure, in absolute darkness. 
        Yet it is perfectly possible to see in it, so that the minutest details 
        do not escape us. And upon the root of one flower he pours acid so that 
        that root writhes as if in torture. And another he cuts, and the shriek 
        is like the shriek of a mandrake, torn up by the roots. And another he 
        chars with fire, and yet another he anoints with oil. </p>
      <p>And I said: Heavy is the labour, but great indeed is the reward. </p>
      <p>And the young man answered me: He shall not see the reward, he tendeth 
        the garden<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>And I said: What shall come unto him? </p>
      <p>And he said: This thou canst not know, nor is it revealed by the letters 
        that are the totems of the stars, but only by the stars. </p>
      <p>And he says to me, quite disconnectedly: The man of earth is the adherent. 
        The lover giveth his life unto the work among men. The hermit goeth solitary, 
        and giveth only of his light unto men<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>And I ask him: Why does he tell me that? </p>
      <p>And he says: I tell thee not. Thou tellest thyself, for thou hast pondered 
        thereupon for many days, and hast not found light. And now that thou art 
        called NEMO, the answer to every riddle that thou hast not found shall 
        spring up in thy mind, unsought. Who can tell upon what day a flower shall 
        bloom<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>? </p>
      <p>And thou shalt give thy wisdom unto the world, and that shall be thy 
        garden. And concerning time and death, thou hast naught to do with these 
        things. For though a precious stone be hidden in the sand of the desert, 
        it shall not heed for the wind of the desert, although it be but sand. 
        For the worker of works hath worked thereupon; and because it is clear, 
        it is invisible; and because it is hard, it moveth not. </p>
      <p>All these words are heard by everyone that is called NEMO. And with that 
        doth he apply himself to understanding. And he must understand the virtue 
        of the waters of death, and he must understand the virtue of the sun and 
        the wind, and of the worm that turneth the earth, and the stars that roof 
        in the garden. And he must understand the separate nature and property 
        of every flower, or how shall he tend his garden? </p>
      <p>And I said to him: Concerning the Vision and the Voice, I would know 
        if these things be of essence of the Aethyr, or of the essence of the 
        seer<a href="#20"><font
        size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. </p>
      <p>And he answers: It is of the essence of him that is called NEMO, combined 
        with essence of the Aethyr, for from the 1st Aethyr to the 15th Aethyr, 
        there is no vision and no voice, save for him that is called NEMO. And 
        he that seeketh the vision and the voice therein is led away by dog- faced 
        demons that show no sign of truth, seducing from the Sacred Mysteries, 
        unless his name be NEMO. </p>
      <p>And hadst thou not been fitted, thou too hadst been led away, for before 
        the gate of the 15th Aethyr, is this written: He shall send them strong 
        delusion, that they should believe a lie. And again it is written: The 
        Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart. And again it is written that God tempteth 
        man. But thou hadst the word and the sign, and thou hadst authority from 
        thy superior<a href="#21"><font
        size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>, and licence<a
        href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. And thou hast 
        done well in that thou didst not dare, and in that thou dost dare<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. 
        For daring is not presumption. </p>
      <p>And he said moreover: Thou dost well to keep silence, for I perceive 
        how many questions arise in thy mind; yet already thou knowest that the 
        answering, as the asking, must be vain. For NEMO hath all in himself. 
        He hath come where there is no light or knowledge, only when he needeth 
        them no more. </p>
      <p>And then we bow silently, giving a certain sign, called the Sign of Isis 
        Rejoicing<a href="#24"><font
        size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. And then he remaineth to ward 
        the Aethyr, while I return unto the bank of sand that is the bed of the 
        river near the desert. </p>
      <p>The River-bed near Bou-Sada.<br>
