<p align="center"><font size="2">Copyright (c) Ordo Templi Orientis</font></p>
<p>ooo. This is the Book of the Cult of the Infinite Without.</p>
<p>oo. The Aspirant is Hadit. Nuit is the infinite espansion of the Rose; Hadit 
  is the infinite concentration of the Rood (Instruction of V.V.V.V.V.).</p>
<p>o. First let the Aspirant learn in his heart the First Chapter of THE BOOK 
  OF THE LAW (Instruction of V.V.V.V.V).</p>
<p>1. Worship, i.e. identify thyself with, the Khabs, the secret Light within 
  the Heart. Within this again, unextended, is Hadit.<br>
  This is the first practice of the Meditation (ccxx,I:6 and 21).</p>
<p>2. Adore and understand the Rim of the Stele of Revealing.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Above, the gemmed azure is<br>
      The naked splendor of Nuit;<br>
      She bends in ecstasy to kiss<br>
      The secret ardours of Hadit</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the first practice of Intelligence (ccxx, I:14).<br>
  3. Avoid any act of choice or discrimination.<br>
  This is the first practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:22).<br>
  4. Consider the six and fifty that 50/6=0.12.<br>
  o the circumference Nuit.<br>
  . the center, Hadit.</p>
<p>1 the unity proceeding, Ra-Hoor-Khuit.</p>
<p>2 the world of illusion.<br>
  Nuit thus comprehends All in None.<br>
  Also 50+6=56=5+6=11, the key to all Rituals.<br>
  And 50X6=300, the Spirit of the Child within.<br>
  (Note NFic=72, the Shemhamphorash and the Quinaries of the Zodiac, etc.)<br>
  This is the second practice of Intelligence (ccxx,I:24,25).</p>
<p>5. The Result of this Practice is the Consciousness of the Continuity of Existence, 
  the Omnipresence of the Body of Nuit.<br>
  In other words, the Aspirant is conscious only of the Infinte Universe as a 
  single Being.<br>
  This is the first Indication of the Nature of the Result (ccxx,I:26).</p>
<p>6. Meditate upon Nuit as the Continuous One Resolved into None and Two as the 
  phases of her being.<br>
  This is the second practice of Meditation (ccxx,I:27).</p>
<p>7. Meditate upon the facts of Samadhi on all planes the liberation of heat 
  in chemistry, joy in natural history, Ananda in religion, when two things join 
  to lose themselves in a third.<br>
  This is the third practice of Meditation (ccxx, I:28,29,30).</p>
<p>8. Let the Aspirant pay utmost reverence to the Authority of the A.·.A.·. and 
  follow Its instructions, and let him swear a great Oath of Devotion unto Nuit.<br>
  This is the second practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:32).</p>
<p>9. Let the Aspirant beware the slightest exercvise of his will against another 
  being. Thus, lying is a better posture than sitting or standing, as it opposes 
  less resistance to gravitation. Yet his first duty is to the force nearest and 
  most potent; e.g. he may rise to greet a friend.<br>
  This is the third practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:41).</p>
<p>10. Let the Aspirant exercise his will without the least consideration for 
  any other being. This direction cannot be understood, much less accomplished, 
  until the previous practice has been perfected.<br>
  This is the fourth practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:42,43,44).</p>
<p>11. Let the Aspirant comprehend that these two practices are identical.<br>
  This is the third practice of Intelligence (ccxx, I:45).</p>
<p>12. Let the Aspirant live the Life Beautiful and Pleasant. For this freedom 
  hath he won. But let each act, especially of love, be devoted wholly to his 
  true mistress, Nuit.<br>
  This is the fifth practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:51,52,61,63).</p>
<p>13. Let the Aspirant yearn toward Nuit under the stars of Night, with a love 
  directed by his Magical Will, not merely proceeding from the heart.<br>
  This is the first practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:57).</p>
<p>14. The Result of this Practice in the subsequent life of the Aspirant is to 
  fill him with unimaginable joys: to give him certainty concerning the nature 
  of the phenomenon called death, to give him peace unalterable, rest, and ecstasy.<br>
  This is the second Indication of the Nature of the Result<br>
  (ccxx, I:58).</p>
<p>15. Let the Aspirant prepare a perfume of resinous woods and gums, according 
  to his inspiration.<br>
  This is the second practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:59).</p>
<p>16. Let the Aspirant prepare a Pantacle, as follows. Inscribe a circle within 
  a Pentagram, upon a ground square or of such other convenient shape as he may 
  choose. Let the circle be of scarlet, the Pentagram black, the ground royal 
  blue studded with golden stars. Within the circle, at its centre, shall be painted 
  a sigil that shall be revealed to the Aspirant by Nuit herself. And this Pentacle 
  shall serve for a Telesmantic Image, or as an Eidolon, or as a Focus for the 
  mind.<br>
  This is the third practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:60).</p>
<p>17. Let the Aspirant find a lonely place, if possible a place in the Desert 
  of Sand, or if not, a place unfrequented, and without objects to disturb the 
  view. Such are moorlands, fens, the oÿen sea, broad rivers, and open fields. 
  Also, and especially, the summits of mountains. There let him invoke the Goddess 
  as he hath Wisdom and Understanding so to do. But let this Invocation be that 
  of a pure heart, i.e., a heart wholly devoted to Her, and let him remember that 
  it is Hadit Himself in the most secret place thereof that invoketh. Then let 
  this serpent Hadit burst into flame.<br>
  This is the fourth practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:61).</p>
<p>18. Then shall the Aspirant come a little to lie in Her bosom.<br>
  This is the third Indication of the Nature of the Result<br>
  (ccxx, I:61).</p>
<p>19. Let the Aspirant stand upon the edge of a precipice in act or in imagination. 
  And let him imagine and suffer the fear of falling.<br>
  Next let him imagine with this aid that the Earth is falling, and he with it, 
  or he from it; and considering the infinity of space, let him excite the fear 
  within him to the point of ecstasy, so that the most dreadful dream of falling 
  that he hath ever suffered be as nothing in comparison. This is the forth practice 
  of Meditation (Instruction of V.V.V.V.V.).</p>
<p>20. Thus having understood the nature of this Third Indication, let him in 
  his Magick Rite fall from himself into Nuit, or expand into Her, as his imagination 
  may compel him.<br>
  And at that moment, desiring earnestly the Kiss of Nuit, let him give one particle 
  of dust, i.e., let Hadit give himself up utterly to Her.<br>
  This is the fifth practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:61).</p>
<p>21. Then shall he lose all in that hour.<br>
  This is the fourth Indication of the Nature of the Result.<br>
  (ccxx, I:61).</p>
<p>22. Let the Aspirant prepare a lovesong of rapture unto the Goddess, or let 
  him be inspired by Her unto this.<br>
  This is the sixth practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:63).</p>
<p>23. Let the Aspirant be clad in a single robe. An &quot;abbai&quot; of scarlet 
  wrought with gold is most suitable.<br>
  This is the seventh practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:61).</p>
<p>24. Let the Aspirant wear a rich head-dress. A crown of gold adorned with sapphires 
  or diamonds with a royal blue cap of maintenance, or nemmes, is most suitable.<br>
  This is the eighth practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:61).</p>
<p>25. Let the Aspirant wear many jewels such as he may possess.<br>
  This is the ninth practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:61).</p>
<p>26. Let the Aspirant prepare an Elixir or libation as he may have wit to do.<br>
  This is the tenth practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:63).</p>
<p>27. Let the Aspirant invoke, lying supine, his robe spread out as it were a 
  carpet.<br>
  This is the eleventh practice of Magick Art (Instruction of V.V.V.V.V.).</p>
