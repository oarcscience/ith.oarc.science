<p>SINCE nobody can have the presumption to doubt the demonstration of St. Thomas 
  Aquinas that this world is the best of all possible worlds, it follows that 
  the imperfect condition of things which I am about to describe can only obtain 
  in some other universe; probably the whole affair is but the figment of my diseased 
  imagination. Yet if this be so, how can we reconcile the disease with perfection?</p>
<p>Clearly there is something wrong here; the apparent syllogism turns out on 
  examination to be an enthymeme with a suppressed and impossible Major. There 
  is no progression on these lines, and what I foolishly mistook for a nice easy 
  way to glide into my story proves but the blindest of blind alleys.</p>
<p>We must begin therefore by the simple and austere process of beginning.</p>
<p>The conditions of Japan was at this time (what time? Here we are in trouble 
  with the historian at once. But let me say that I will have no interference 
  with my story on the part of all these dull sensible people. I am going straight 
  on, and if the reviews are unfavourable, one has always the resource of suicide) 
  dangerously unstable. The warrior aristocracy of the Upper House had been so 
  diluted with successful cheesemongers that adulteration had become a virtue 
  as highly profitable as adultery. In the Lower House brains were still esteemed, 
  but they had been interpreted as the knack of passing examinations.</p>
<p>The recent extension of the franchise to women had rendered the Yoshiwara the 
  most formidable of the political organizations, while the physique of the nation 
  had been seriously impaired by the results of a law which, by assuring them 
  in case of injury or illness of a life-long competence of idleness which they 
  could never have obtained otherwise by the most laborious toil, encouraged all 
  workers to be utterly careless of their health. The training of servants indeed 
  at this time consisted solely of careful practical instruction in the art of 
  falling down stairs; and the richest man in the country was an ex-butler who, 
  by breaking his leg on no less than thirty-eight occasions, had acquired a pension 
  which put that of a field-marshal altogether into the shade. </p>
<p>As yet, however, the country was not yet irretrievably doomed. A system of 
  intrigue and blackmail, elaborated by the governing classes to the highest degree 
  of efficiency, acted as a powerful counterpoise. In theory all were equal; in 
  practice the permanent officials, the real rulers of the country, were a distinguished 
  and trustworthy body of men. Their interest was to govern well, for any civil 
  or foreign disturbance would undoubtedly have fanned the sparks of discontent 
  into the roaring flame of revolution.</p>
<p>And discontent there was. The unsuccessful cheesemongers were very bitter against 
  the Upper House; and those who had failed in examinations wrote appalling diabetes 
  against the folly of the educational system.</p>
<p>The trouble was that they were right; the government was well enough in fact, 
  but in theory had hardly a leg to stand on. In view of the growing clamour, 
  the official classes were perturbed; for many of their number were intelligent 
  enough to see that a thoroughly irrational system, however well it may work 
  in practice, cannot for ever be maintained against the attacks of those who, 
  though they may be secretly stigmatized as doctrinaires, can bring forward unanswerable 
  arguments. The people had power, but not reason; so were amenable to the fallacies 
  which they mistook for reason and not to the power which they would have imagined 
  to be tyranny. An intelligent plebs is docile; and educated canaille expects 
  everything to be logical. The shallow sophisms of the socialist were intelligible; 
  they could not be refuted by the profounder and therefore unintelligible propositions 
  of the Tory.</p>
<p>The mob could understand the superficial resemblance of babies; they could 
  not be got to understand that the circumstances of education and environment 
  made but a small portion of the equipment of a conscious being. The brutal and 
  truthful &quot;You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear&quot; had been 
  forgotten for the smooth and plausible fallacies of such writers as Ki Ra Di.</p>
<p>So serious had the situation become, indeed, that the governing classes had 
  abandoned all dogmas of Divine Right and the like as untenable. The theory of 
  heredity had broken down, and the ennoblement of the cheesemongers made it not 
  only false, but ridiculous.</p>
<p>We consequently find them engaged in the fatuous task of defending the anomalies 
  which disgusted the nation by a campaign of glaring and venal sophistries. These 
  deceived nobody, and only inspired the contempt, which might have been harmless, 
  with a hate which threatened to engulph the community in an abyss of the most 
  formidable convulsions.</p>
<p>Such was the razor-edge upon which the unsteady feet of the republic strode 
  when, a few years before the date of my visit, the philosoÿher Kwaw landed at 
  Nagasaki after an exhilarating swim from the mainland.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>II</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>&quot;STANDING ALONE.&quot;</strong></font></p>
<p>KWAW, when he crossed the Yellow Sea, was of the full age of thirty-two years. 
  The twenty previous equinoxes had passed over his head as he wandered, sole 
  human tenant, among the colossal yet ignoble ruins of Wei Hai Wei. His only 
  companions were the lion and the lizard, who frequented the crumbling remains 
  of the officers' quarters; while in the little cemetery the hoofs of the wild 
  ass beat (uselessly, if he wished to wake them) upon the tombs of the sportsmen 
  that once thronged those desolate halls.</p>
<p>During this time Kwaw devoted his entire attention to the pursuit of philosophy; 
  for the vast quantities of excellent stores abandoned by the British army left 
  him no anxiety upon the score of hunger.</p>
<p>In the first year he disciplined and conquered his body and its emotions.</p>
<p>In the next six years he disciplined and conquered his mind and its thoughts.</p>
<p>In the next two years he had reduced the Universe to the Yang and the Yin and 
  their permutations in the trigrams of Fo-hi and the hexagrams of King Wu.</p>
<p>In the last year he abolished the Yang and the Yin, and became united with 
  the great Tao.</p>
<p>All this was very satisfactory to Kwaw. But even his iron frame had become 
  somewhat impaired by the unvarying diet of tinned provisions; and it was perhaps 
  only by virtue of the talisman that he succeeded in his famous attempt to outdo 
  the feats of Captain Webb. Nor was his reception less than a triumph. So athletic 
  a nation as the Japanese still were could not but honour so superb an achievement, 
  though it cost them dear, inasmuch as the Navy League (by an astute series of 
  political moves) compelled the party in power to treble the Navy, build a continuous 
  line of forts around the sea-coast, and expend many billions of yen upon the 
  scientific breeding of a more voracious species of shark than had hitherto infested 
  their shores.</p>
<p>So they carried Kwaw shoulder-high to the Yoshiwara, and passed him the glad 
  hand, and called out the Indians, and annexed his personal property for relics, 
  and otherwise followed the customs of the best New York Society, while the German 
  Band accompanied the famous Ka Ru So to the following delightful ballad:</p>

<p>One need not be intimately familiar with the Japanese character to understand 
  that Kwaw and his feat were forgotten in a very few days; but a wealthy Daimio, 
  with a taste for observation, took it into his head to inquire of Kwaw for what 
  purpose he had entered the country in so strange a manner. It will simplify 
  matters if I reproduce in extenso the correspondence, which was carried on by 
  telegram. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Who is your honourable self, and why has your excellency paid us cattle 
    the distinguished compliment of a visit?</li>
  <li>This disgusting worm is great Tao. I humbly beg of your sublime radiance 
    to trample his slave.</li>
  <li>Regret great toe unintelligible.</li>
  <li>Great Tao &#151; T.A.O. &#151; Tao.</li>
  <li>What is the great Tao?</li>
  <li>The result of subtracting the universe from itself.</li>
  <li>Good, but this decaying dog cannot grant your honourable excellency's sublime 
    desire, but, on the contrary, would earnestly pray your brilliant serenity 
    to spit upon his grovelling &quot;joro.&quot;</li>
  <li>Profound thought assures your beetle-headed suppliant that your glorious 
    nobility must meet him before the controversy can be decided.</li>
  <li>True. Would your sublimity condescend to defile himself by entering this 
    muck-sweeper's miserable hovel?</li>
  <li>Expect leprous dragon with beri beri at your high mightiness's magnificent 
    heavenly palace to-morrow (Thursday) afternoon at three sharp.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus met Kwaw, the poet-philosopher of China; and Juju, the godfather of his 
  country.</p>
<p>Sublime moment in eternity! To the names of Joshua and Hezekiah add that of 
  Kwaw! For though he was a quarter of an hour late for the appointment, the hands 
  went back on the dial of Juju's chronometer, so that no shadow of distrust or 
  annoyance clouded the rapture of that supreme event.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>III</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>&quot;THE MANIFESTING OF SIMPLICITY.&quot;</strong></font></p>
<p>&quot;WHAT,&quot; said Juju, &quot;O great Tao, do you recommend as a remedy 
  for the ills of my unhappy country?&quot;</p>
<p>The sage replied as follows: &quot;O mighty and magniloquent Daimio, your aristocracy 
  is not an aristocracy because it is not an aristocracy. In vain you seek to 
  alter this circumstance by paying the noxious vermin of the Dai Li Pai Pur to 
  write fatuous falsehoods maintaining that your aristocracy is an aristocracy 
  because it is an aristocracy.</p>
<p>&quot;As Heracleitus overcame the antinomy of Xenophanes and Parmenides, Melissus 
  and the Eleatic Zero, and Ens and the Non-Ens by his Becoming, so let me say 
  to you; the aristocracy will be an aristocracy by becoming an aristocracy.</p>
<p>&quot;Ki Ra Di and his dirty-faced friends wish to level down the good practice 
  to the bad theory; you should oppose them be levelling up the bad theory to 
  the good practice.</p>
<p>&quot;Your enviers boast that you are no better than they; prove to them that 
  they are as good as you. They speak of a nobility of fools and knaves; show 
  to them wise and honest men, and the socialistic ginger is no longer hot in 
  the individualistic mouth.&quot;</p>
<p>Juju grunted assent. He had gone almost to sleep, but Kwaw, absorbed in his 
  subject, never noticed the fact. He went on with the alacrity of a steam-roller, 
  and the direct and purposeful vigour of a hypnotized butterfly. &quot;Man is 
  perfect by his identity with the great Tao. Subsidiary to this he must have 
  balanced perfectly the Yang and the Yin. Easier still is it to rule the sixfold 
  star of Intellect; while for the base the control of the body and its emotions 
  is the earliest step.</p>
<p>&quot;Equilibrium is the great law, and perfect equilibrium is crowned by identity 
  with the great Tao.&quot;</p>
<p>He emphasized this sublime assertion by a deliberate blow upon the protruding 
  abdomen of the worthy Juju.</p>
<p>&quot;Pray continue your honourable discourse!&quot; exclaimed the half-awakened 
  Daimio.</p>
<p>Kwaw went on, and I think it only fair to say that he went on for a long time, 
  and that because you have been fool enough to read thus far, you have no excuse 
  for being fool enough to read farther.</p>
<p>&quot;Phenacetin is a useful drug in fever, but woe to that patient who shall 
  imbibe it in collapse. Because calomel is a dangerous remedy in appendicitis, 
  we do not condemn its use in simple indigestions.</p>
<p>&quot;As above so beneath! said Hermes the thrice greatest. The laws of the 
  physical world are precisely paralleled by those of the moral and intellectual 
  sphere. To the prostitute I prescribe a course of training by which she shall 
  comprehend the holiness of sex. Chastity forms part of that training, and I 
  should hope to see her one day a happy wife and mother. To the prude equally 
  I prescribe a course of training by which she shall comprehend the holiness 
  of sex. Unchastity forms part of that training, and I should hope to see her 
  one day a happy wife and mother.</p>
<p>&quot;To the bigot I commend a course of Thomas Henry Huxley; to the infidel 
  a practical study of ceremonial magic. Then, when the bigot has knowledge and 
  the infidel faith, each may follow without prejudice his natural inclination; 
  for he will no longer plunge into his former excesses.</p>
<p>&quot;So also she who was a prostitute from native passion may indulge with 
  safety in the pleasure of love; she who was by nature cold may enjoy a virginity 
  in no wise marred by her disciplinary course of unchastity. But the one will 
  understand and love the other.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been taxed with assaulting what is commonly known as virtue. True; 
  I hate it, but only in the same degree that I hate what is commonly known as 
  vice.</p>
<p>&quot;So it must be acknowledged that one who is but slightly unbalanced needs 
  a milder correction than whoso is obsessed by prejudice. There are men who make 
  a fetish of cleanliness; they shall work in a fitter's shop, and learn that 
  dirt is the mark of honourable toil. There are those whose lives are rendered 
  wretched by the fear of infection; they see bacteria of the deadliest sort in 
  all things but the actual solutions of carbolic acid and mercuric chloride with 
  which they hysterically combat their invisible foemen; such would I send to 
  live in the bazaar at Delhi, where they shall haply learn that dirt makes little 
  difference after all.</p>
<p>&quot;There are slow men who need a few months' experience of the hustle of 
  the stockyards; there are business men in a hurry, and they shall travel in 
  Central Asia to acquire the art of repose.</p>
<p>&quot;So much for the equilibrium, and for two months in every year each member 
  of your governing classes shall undergo this training under skilled advice.</p>
<p>&quot;But what of the Great Tao? For one month in every year each of these 
  men shall seek desperately for the Stone of the Philosophers. By solitude and 
  fasting for the social and luxurious, by drunkenness and debauch for the austere, 
  by scourging for those afraid of physical pain, by repose for the restless, 
  and toil for the idle, by bull-fights for the humanitarian, and the care of 
  little children for the callous, by rituals for the rational, and by philosophy 
  for the credulous, shall these men, while yet unbalanced, seek to attain to 
  unity with the great Tao. But for those whose intellect is purified and co-ordinated, 
  for those whose bodies are in health, and whose passions are at once eager and 
  controlled, it shall be lawful to choose their own way to the One Goal; videlicet, 
  identity with that great Tao which is above the antithesis of Yang and Yin.&quot;</p>
<p>Even Kwaw felt tired, and applied himself to saké-and-soda. Refreshed, he continued: 
  &quot;The men who are willing by this means to become the saviours of their 
  country shall be called the Synagogue of Satan, so as to keep themselves from 
  the friendship of the fools who mistake names for things. There shall be masters 
  of the Synagogue, but they shall never seek to dominate. They shall most carefully 
  abstain from inducing any man to seek the Tao by any other way than that of 
  equilibrium. They shall develop individual genius without considering whether 
  in their opinion its fruition will tend to the good or evil of their country 
  or of the world; for who are they to interfere with a soul whose balance has 
  been crowned by the most holy Tao?</p>
<p>&quot;The masters shall be great men among men; but among great men they shall 
  be friends.</p>
<p>&quot;Since equilibrium will have become perfect, a greater than Napoleon shall 
  arise, and the peaceful shall rejoice thereat; a greater than Darwin, and the 
  minister in his pulpit give open thanks to God.</p>
<p>&quot;The instructed infidel shall no longer sneer at the church-goer, for 
  he will have been compelled to go to church until he saw the good points as 
  well as the bad; and the instructed devotee will no longer detest the blasphemer, 
  because he will have laughed with Ingersoll and Saladin.</p>
<p>&quot;Give the lion the heart of the lamb, and the lamb the force of the lion; 
  and they will lie down in peace together.&quot;</p>
<p>Kwaw ceased, and the heavy and regular breathing of Juju assured him that his 
  words had not been wasted; at last that restless and harried soul had found 
  supreme repose.</p>
<p>Kwaw tapped the gong. &quot;I have achieved my task,&quot; said he to the obsequious 
  major-domo, &quot;I pray leave to retire from the Presence.&quot; &quot;I beg 
  your excellency to follow me,&quot; replied the gorgeous functionary, &quot;his 
  lordship has commanded me to see that your holiness is supplied with everything 
  that you desire.&quot; Then the sage laughed aloud.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>IV</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>&quot;THINGS TO BE BELIEVED.&quot;</strong></font></p>
<p>SIX months passed by, and Juju, stirring in his sleep, remembered the duties 
  of politeness, and asked for Kwaw.</p>
<p>&quot;He is on your lordship's estate at Nikko,&quot; the servants hastened 
  to reply, &quot;and he has turned the whole place completely upside down. Millions 
  of yen have been expended monthly; he has even mortgaged this very palace in 
  which your lordship has been asleep; a body of madmen has seized the reins of 
  government&#151;&#151;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Synagogue of Satan!&quot; gasped the outraged Daimio.</p>
<p>&quot;&#151;And you are everywhere hailed as the Godfather of your country!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do not tell me that the British war has ended disastrously for us!&quot; 
  and he called for the elaborate apparatus of hari-kari.</p>
<p>&quot;On the contrary, my lord, the ridiculous Sa Mon, who would never go to 
  sea because he was afraid of being sick, although his genius for naval strategy 
  had no equal in the Seven Abysses of Water, after a month as stowaway on a fishing 
  boat (by the order of Kwaw) assumed the rank of Admiral of the Fleet, and has 
  inflicted a series of complete and crushing defeats upon the British Admirals, 
  who though they had been on the water all their lives, had incomprehensibly 
  omitted to acquire any truly accurate knowledge of the metaphysical systems 
  of Sho Pi Naour and Ni Tchze.</p>
<p>&quot;Again, Hu Li, the financial genius, who had hitherto been practically 
  useless to his country on account of that ugliness and deformity which led him 
  to shun the society of his fellows, was compelled by Kwaw to exhibit himself 
  as a freak. A fortnight of this cured him of shyness; and within three months 
  he has nearly doubled the revenue and halved the taxes. Your lordship has spent 
  millions of yen; but is to-day a richer man than when your excellency went to 
  sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will go and see this Kwaw,&quot; said the Daimio. The servants then 
  admitted that the Mikado in person had been waiting at the palace door for over 
  three months, for the very purpose of begging permission to conduct him thither, 
  but that he had been unwilling to disturb the sleep of the Godfather of his 
  country.</p>
<p>Impossible to describe the affecting scene when these two magnanimous beings 
  melted away (as it were) in each other's arms.</p>
<p>Arrived at the estate of Juju at Nikko, what wonder did these worthies express 
  to see the simple means by which Kwaw had worked his miracles! In a glade of 
  brilliant cherry and hibiscus (and any other beautiful trees you can think of) 
  stood a plain building of stone, which after all had not cost millions of yen, 
  but a very few thousands only. Its height was equal to its breadth, and its 
  length was equal to the sum of these, while the sum of these three meas urements 
  was precisely equal to ten times the age of Kwaw in units of the span of his 
  hand. The walls were tremendously thick and there was only one door and two 
  windows, all in the eye of the sunset. One cannot describe the inside of the 
  building, because to do so would spoil all the fun for other people. It must 
  be seen to be understood, in any case; and there it stands to this day, open 
  to anybody who is strong enough to force in the door.</p>
<p>But when they asked for Kwaw, he was not to be found. He had left trained men 
  to carry out the discipline and the initiations, these last being the chief 
  purpose of the building, saying that he was homesick for the lions and lizards 
  of Wei-Hai-Wei, and that anyway he hadn't enjoyed a decent swim for far too

<p>There is unfortunately little room for doubt that the new and voracious species 
  of sharks (which Japanese patriotism had spent such enormous sums in breeding)

<p>The Mikado wept; but, brightening up, exclaimed: &quot;Kwaw found us a confused 
  and angry mob; he left us a diverse, yet harmonious, republic; while let us

  glory of humanity, realization of our identity with the great and holy Tao.&quot;</p>

<p>Assigned to the Adeptus Major Grade of the A\A\.</p>
<p>At its original publication, this instruction was assigned neither a Document 
  Class nor a catalogue number. In fact, it has never been published with official 
  A\A\ sanction, outside of individual contemporary lineages. The formulation 
  of the A\A\ was, in 1907, in its early stages, and these details may not have 
  as yet been formalized. Later (in the &quot;Syllabus&quot; in Equinox I:10), 
  it was designated as a Class C Document, and given the number XLI. No explanation 
  was given for the assignment of this number. </p>
