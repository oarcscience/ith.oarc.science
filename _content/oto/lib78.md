<p>WITH THEIR ATTRIBUTIONS; INCLUDING A</p>
<p>METHOD OF DIVINATION BY THEIR USE</p>
<p>"All divination resembles an attempt by a man born blind to obtain sight by getting blind drunk."</p>
<p>FRA. P.</p>
<p>{Illustration facing page 145 described:</p>
<p>This is a figure in the shape of an Ankh, with symbols about and upon the form. The loop is a series of four concentric bands like the Rose cross, about a central circle. The central circle is quartered by a vertical Greek cross. This cross has a dot in the center and is marked "Red on white." The ring just about this circle is divided by radial segments into three chambers, with one centered at top; clockwise from top, the chambers are marked: "Bright pale yellow", "Glowing orange scarlet", "Deep blue". The next ring outward is divided into seven chambers, one to bottom, and marked clockwise from 1 o'clock: "Violet", "Indigo", "Blue", "Emerald Green", "Yellow", "Orange", "Red". The next ring outward is divided into twelve chambers, division at top and bottom with six to either side; clockwise from 1 o'clock: "Crimson", "Violet", "Indigo", "Blue", "Green blue", "Emerald Green", "Green Yellowish", "Yellow Greenish", "Amber", "Orange", "Red Orange", "Scarlet". The outer ring is interrupted at the bottom by a segment to match the continuation of the sloping lower sides of the lower upright, the base of this segment is defined not by the ring but by the upper portion of two diagonals drawn from the inner angles of the cross. This five-sided semi-regular figure is further divided within by two crossed lines emanating from the upper corners and extending across the center to the midpoints of the lower sides. In the four chambers resulting are these color abbreviations, clockwise from top: "Blk" (for black), "Russ" (for russet), "Cit'n" (for citrine), "Olive". To either side of this section, on the band itself, is written "white merging into grey". In the top of this outermost ring are these letters in the "Theban Alphabet": u r h --- signifying the "Angel" or "God of Tarot", HRU.</p>
<p>The left arm of the Ankh has from left to right: the symbol of Scorpio (the "M" style, not the Eagle as noted in text), a cup, the words "Deep Blue; Symbols in yellow". The right arm of the Ankh has from left to right: "the words "Red; symbols in Green", a lotus wand, the symbol of Leo.</p>
<p>The basal upright of the Ankh has these in the lower half only, from bottom upward: the symbol of Aquarius, an upright sword in style of the Solomonic Key, the words "Yellow; symbols in Violet.</p>
<p>There are markings and symbols outside the shape of the Ankh: Upper left corner: "L-I-F-E-" above a large "T". Upper right corner: "V-I-T-A-" above a large "A". To left of base: large "O". To right of base: large "P". Below base: "B-I-O-S-" just above the caption "THE COMPLETE SYMBOL OF THE TAROT". The large letters spell "TARO" in Greek capitals ( GR:Tau-Alpha-Rho-Omicron). In the wedges defined by the lower sides of the cross-arms and the base upright sides: to left an upright pentagram with the dot-in-circle Sun symbol in its pentagonal center. To right the same, but with a crescent moon, horns to right.</p>
<p>There is a very small semi-italic note at the lower right, below all else: "["To face p." 145" }</p>

<p>The Descriptions of the Seventy-eight Symbols of this Book {"T" in a circle, composed of two white bars}; together with their meanings.</p>
<p>OF THE ACES</p>
<p>FIRST in order and importance are the Four Aces, representing the Force of the Spirit, acting in, and binding together, the Four Scales of each Element: and answering to the Dominion of the Letters of the Name in the Kether of each. They represent the Radical Forces.</p>
<p>The Four Aces are said to be placed on the North Pole of the Universe wherein they revolve, governing its revolution; and ruling as the connecting link between Yetzirah and the Material Plane or Universe.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF FIRE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Ace of Wands"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds, and grasping a heavy club, which has three branches in the colours, and with the sigils, of the scales. The Right-and Left-hand branches end respectively in three Flames, and the Centre one in four Flames: thus yielding Ten: the Number of the Sephiroth. Two-and-twenty leaping Flames, or Yodh, surround it, answering to the Paths; of these, three fall below the Right branch for Aleph, Men, and Shin, seven above the Central branch for the double letters; and between it and that of the Right twelve: six above and six below about the Left-hand branch. The whole is a great and flaming Torch. It symbolizes Force --- strength, rush, vigour, energy, and it governs, according to its nature, various works and questions.</p>
<p>It implies Natural, as opposed to Invoked, Force.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF THE WATERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Ace of Cups or Chalices"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds, and supporting on the palm thereof a cup, resembling that of the Stolistes.</p>
<p>From it rises a fountain of clear and glistening water: and sprays falling on all sides into clear calm water below, in which grow Lotuses and Water- lilies. The great Letter of the Supernal Mother is traced in the spray of the Fountain.</p>
<p>It symbolizes Fertility --- productiveness, beauty, pleasure, happiness, etc.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF THE AIR</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Ace of Swords"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds, and grasping the hilt of a sword, which supports a White Radiant Celestial Crown; from which depend, on the right, the olive branch of Peace; and on the left, the palm branch of suffering.</p>
<p>Six Vaus fall from its point. It symbolizes "Invoked," as contrasted with Natural Force: for it is the Invocation of the Sword. Raised upward, it invokes the Divine crown of Spiritual Brightness, but reversed it is the Invocation of Demonic Force; and becomes a fearfully evil symbol. It represents, therefore, very great power for good or evil, but invoked; and it also represents whirling Force, and strength through trouble. It is the affirmation of Justice upholding Divine Authority; and it may become the Sword of Wrath, Punishment, and Affliction.</p>
<p><strong>IV</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF THE EARTH</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Ace of Pentacles"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand, holding a branch of a Rose Tree, whereon is a large Pentacle, formed of Five concentric circles. The Innermost Circle is white, charged with a red Greek Cross. From this White Centre, Twelve Rays, also white, issue: these terminate at the circumference, making the whole something like an Astrological figure of the Heavens.</p>
<p>It is surmounted by a small circle, above which is a large white Maltese Cross, and with two white wings.</p>
<p>Four Crosses and two buds are shewn. The Hand issueth from the Clouds as in the other three cases.</p>
<p>It represents materiality in all senses, good and evil: and is, therefore, in a sense, illusionary: it shows material gain, labour, power, wealth, etc.</p>
<p><strong>THE SIXTEEN COURT, OR ROYAL CARDS</strong></p>
<p><strong>"The Four Kings"</strong></p>
<p>THE Four Kings, or "Figures mounted on steeds," represent the Yodh forces of the Name in each Suit: the Radix, Father and commencement of Material Forces, a force in which all the others are implied, and of which they form the development and completion. A force swift and violent in its action, but whose effect soon passes away, and therefore symbolized by a Figure on a Steed riding swiftly, and clothed in complete Armour.</p>
<p>Therefore is the knowledge of the scale of the King so necessary for the commencement of all magical working.</p>
<p>"The Four Queens"</p>
<p>are seated upon Thrones; representing the Forces of the He of the Name in each suit; the Mother and bringer-forth of Material Forces: a force which develops and realizes that of the King: a force steady and unshaken, but not rapid, though enduring. It is therefore symbolized by a Figure seated upon a Throne: but also clothed in Armour.</p>
<p>"The Four Princes"</p>
<p>These Princes are Figures seated in Chariots, and thus borne forward. They represent the Vau Forces of the Name in each suit: the Mighty Son of the King and Queen, who realizes the influence of both scales of Force. A Prince, the son of a King and Queen, yet a Prince of Princes, and a King of Kings: an Emperor whose effect is at once rapid (though not so swift as that of the Queen) and enduring. It is, therefore, symbolized by a Figure borne in a Chariot, and clothed in Armour. Yet is his power vain and illusionary, unless set in Motion by his Father and Mother. "The Four Princesses"</p>
<p>are the Knaves of the Tarot Pack; The Four Princesses or figures of Amazons, standing firmly of themselves: neither riding upon Horses, nor seated upon Thrones, nor borne in Chariots. They represent the forces of the He final of the Name in each suit, completing the Influences of the other scales: The mighty and potent daughter of a King and Queen: a Princess powerful and terrible: a Queen of Queens --- an Empress --- whose effect combines those of the King, Queen, and Prince, at once violent and permanent; therefore symbolized by a Figure standing firmly by itself, only partially draped, and having but little Armour; yet her power existeth not, save by reason of the others: and then indeed it is mighty and terrible materially, and is the Throne of the Forces of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Woe unto whomsoever shall make war upon her, when thus established!</p>
<p><strong>THE SPHERES OF INFLUENCE OF THE<br />
COURT CARDS OF THE TAROT PACK</strong></p>
<p>THE Princesses rule the Four Parts of the Celestial Heavens which lie around the north Pole, and above the respective Cherubic Signs of the Zodiac, and they form the Thrones of the Powers of the Four Aces.</p>
<p>The twelve cards, the Four Kings, Queens and Princes rule the dominion of the Celestial Heavens, between the realm of the Four Princesses and the Zodiac, as is hereafter shewn. And they, as it were, link together the signs.</p>
<p><strong>V</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF THE FLAME AND THE LIGHT-<br />
NING; THE KING OF THE SPIRITS OF FIRE</strong></p>
<strong>"Knight"&lt;</strong>
&gt; "of Wands"
<p>A WINGED Warrior riding upon a black horse with flaming mane and tail: the horse itself is not winged. The rider wears a winged helmet (like the old Scandinavian and Gaulish helmet) with a Rayed Crown, a corslet of scale-mail and buskins of the same, and a flowing scarlet mantle. Above his helmet, upon his curass, and on the shoulder-pieces and buskins, he wears as a crest a winged black horse's head. He grasps a club with flaming ends, somewhat similar to that in the symbol of the Ace of Wands, but not so heavy, and also the sigil of his scale is shown; beneath the rushing feet of his steed are waving flames and fire. He is active --- generous --- fierce --- sudden --- impetuous.</p>
<p>If ill dignified, he is evil-minded --- cruel --- bigoted --- brutal. He rules the celestial heavens from above the Twentieth Degree of Scorpio to the First Two Decans of Sagittarius: and this includes a part of the Constellation Hercules. (Hercules is always represented with a Club.)</p>
<p>Fire of Fire<br />
King of the Salamanders.</p>
<p><strong>VI</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE QUEEN OF THE THRONES OF FLAME</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Queen of Wands"</strong></p>
<p>A CROWNED queen with long red-golden hair, seated upon a Throne, with steady flames beneath. She wears a corslet and buskins of scale-mail, which latter her robe discloses. Her arms are almost bare. On cuirass and buskins are leopard's heads winged, and the same symbol surmounteth her crown. At her side is a couchant leopard on which her hands rest. She bears a long wand with a very heavy conical head. The face is beautiful and resolute.</p>
<p>Adaptability, steady force applied to an object, steady rule, great attractive power, power of command, yet liked notwithstanding. Kind and generous when not opposed.</p>
<p>If ill dignified, obstinate, revengeful, domineering, tyrannical, and apt to turn against another without a cause.</p>
<p>She rules the heavens from above the last Decan of Pisces to above the 20 Degree of Aries: including thus a part of Andromeda.</p>
<p>Water of Fire<br />
Queen of the Salamanders.</p>

<p><strong>"King of Wands"</strong></p>
<p>A KINGLY Figure with a golden, winged crown, seated on a chariot. He has large white wings. One wheel of his chariot is shewn. He wears corslet and buskins of scale armour decorated with a winged lion's head, which symbol also surmounts his crown. His chariot is drawn by a lion. His arms are bare, save for the shoulder-pieces of the corslet, and he bears a torch or fire-wand, somewhat similar to that of the Zelator Adeptus Minor. Beneath the chariot are flames, some waved, some salient.</p>
<p>Swift, strong, hasty; rather violent, yet just and generous; noble and scorning meanness.</p>
<p>If ill dignified --- cruel, intolerant, prejudiced and ill natured. He rules the heavens from above the last Decan of Cancer to the second Decan of Leo; hence he includes most of Leo Minor.</p>
<p>Air of Fire<br />
Prince and Emperor of Salamanders.</p>
<p><strong>VIII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE PRINCESS OF THE SHINING FLAME;<br />
THE ROSE OF THE PALACE OF FIRE</strong></p>

<p>A VERY strong and beautiful woman with flowing red-gold hair, attired like an Amazon. Her shoulders, arms, bosom and knees are bare. She wears a short kilt reaching to the knee. Round her waist is a broad belt of scale-mail; narrow at the sides; broader in front and back; and having a winged tiger's head in front. She wears a Corinthian-shaped helmet and crown with a long plume. It also is surmounted by a tiger's head, and the same symbol forms the buckle of her scale-mail buskins. A mantle lined with tiger's skin falls back from her shoulders. Her right hand rests on a small golden or brazen altar ornamented with ram's heads and with Flames of Fire leaping from it. Her left hand leans on a long and heavy club, swelling at the lower end, where the sigil is placed; and it has flames of fire leaping from it the whole way down; but the flames are ascending. This club or torch is much longer than that carried by the King or Queen. Beneath her firmly placed feet are leaping Flames of Fire.</p>
<p>Brilliance, courage, beauty, force, sudden in anger or love, desire of power, enthusiasm, revenge.</p>
<p>If ill dignified, she is superficial, theatrical, cruel, unstable, domineering.</p>

His general equipment is similar to that of the Knight of Wands, but upon his helmet, cuirass and buskins is a peacock with opened wings. He holds a cup in his hand, bearing the sigil of the scale. Beneath his horse's feet is the sea. From the cup issues a crab. Graceful, poetic, Venusian, indolent, but enthusiastic if roused.</p>

She holds a cup, wherefrom a crayfish issues. Her face is dreamy. She holds a lotus in the hand upon the Ibis.</p>
<p>She is imaginative, poetic, kind, yet not willing to take much trouble for another. Coquettish, good-natured and underneath a dreamy appearance. Imagination stronger than feeling. Very much affected by other influences, and therefore more dependent upon dignity than most symbols. She rules from 20 Degree Gemini to 20 Degree Cancer.</p>

General attire like King of Wands. Beneath his chariot is the calm and stagnant water of a lake. His armour resembles feathers more than scales. He holds in one hand a lotus, and in the other a cup, charged with the sigil of his scale. A serpent issues from the cup, and has its head tending down to the waters of the lake. He is subtle, violent, crafty and artistic; a fierce nature with calm exterior. Powerful for good or evil but more attracted by the evil if allied with apparent Power or Wisdom.</p>
<p>If ill dignified, he is intensely evil and merciless.</p>
<p>He rules from 20 Degree Libra to 20 Degree Scorpio.</p>

Her mantle is lined with swansdown, and is of thin floating material.</p>
<p>Sweetness, poetry, gentleness and kindness. Imaginative, dreamy, at times indolent, yet courageous if roused.</p>

He holds a drawn sword with the sigil of his scale upon its pommel. Beneath his horse's feet are dark-driving stratus clouds.</p>
<p>He is active, clever, subtle, fierce, delicate, courageous, skilful, but inclined to domineer. Also to overvalue small things, unless well dignified.</p>

<p>Rules from 20 Degree Taurus to 20 Degree Gemini.</p>
<p>Fire of Air<br />
King of the Sylphs and Sylphides.</p>
<p><strong>XIV</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE QUEEN OF THE THRONES OF AIR</strong></p>

</p>
<p><strong>OF THE THIRTY-SIX DECANS</strong></p>
<p>HERE follow the descriptions of the smaller cards of the four suits, thirty-six in number, answering unto the thirty-six Decans of the Zodiac.</p>
<p>Commencing from the sign Aries, the "Central" Decans of each sign follow the order of the Days of the Week. Thus ---</p>

<p>The first and third Decans follow the same order: Sunday beginning the First Decan of Virgo and in the Third Decans of Gemini and Capricorn.</p>
<p>The planets govern respectively Decans with the following Titles ---</p>
<p>Saturn 1. Leo Strife 5 of Wands. 2. Libra Sorrow 3 " Swords. 3. Sagittarius Oppression 10 " Wands. 4. Pisces Abundant Success 8 " Cups. 5. Taurus Success Unfulfilled 7 " Pentacles. Or in Taurus Leo Libra Sagittarius Pisces two wands: 1 each of the other suits.</p>

Aquarius Unstable Effort 7 " Swords. 4. Taurus Material Success 6 " Pentacles. 5. Cancer Blended Pleasure 4 " Cups. Or in Taurus Cancer Libra Sagittarius Aquarius two Swords: 1 of each of the others.</p>
<p>There being thirty-six Decans and seven Planets, it follows that one of the latter must rule over one more Decan than the others. This is the Planet Mars, to which are allotted the last Decan of Pisces, and the first of Aries, because the long cold of the winter requires a great energy to overcome it, and initiate spring.</p>
<p>And the beginning of the Decanates is from the royal Star of Leo, the great Star Cor Leonis: and therefore is the first Decan that of Saturn in Leo.</p>
<p>Here follow the general meanings of the small cards of the suits, as classified under the nine Sephiroth below Kether.</p>
<p>HB:ChKMH The Four Twos symbolize the Powers of the King and Queen just uniting and initiating the Force; but before the Prince and Princess are thoroughly brought into action. Therefore do they generally imply the initiation and fecundation of a thing.</p>
<p>HB:BYNH Realization of action owing to the Prince being produced. The central symbol on each card. Action definitely commenced for good or evil.</p>
<p>HB:ChSD Perfection, realization, completion: making a matter settled and fixed.</p>
<p>HB:GBVRH Opposition, strife and struggle: war; obstacle to the thing in hand. Ultimate success or failure is otherwise shewn.</p>
<p>HB:ThPARTh Definite accomplishment. Thing carried out.</p>
<p>HB:NTzCh Generally shew a force transcending the Material Plane: and is like unto a Crown; which, indeed, is powerful, but requireth one capable of wearing it. The Sevens then shew a possible result: which is dependent on the action then taken. They depend much on the symbols that accompany them.</p>
<p>HB:HVD Solitary success: "i.e." success in the matter for the time being: but not leading to much result apart from the thing itself.</p>
<p>HB:YSVD Very great fundamental force. Executive power, because they restore a firm basis. Powerful for good or evil.</p>
<p>HB:MLKVTh Fixed, culminated, complete Force, whether good or evil. The matter thoroughly and definitely determined. Ultimating Force.</p>
<p>Follow the particular descriptions of each of the thirty-six cards: with full meanings.</p>
<p>Decan-cards are always modified by the other symbols with which they are in contact.</p>
<p><strong>XXI</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF STRIFE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Five of Wands"</strong></p>
<p>TWO White Radiant Angelic Hands issuant per nubes dexter and sinister. They are clasped together in the grip of the First Order, "i.e." the four fingers of each right hand crooked into each other, the thumbs meeting above; and they hold, at the same time, by their centres, five wands or torches which are similar unto the wands of a Zelator Adeptus Minor. One wand is upright in the middle; the others cross each other. Flames leap from the point of junction. Above the middle wand is the sign Saturn, and below is that of Leo: thus representing the Decante. Violent strife and boldness, rashness, cruelty, violence, lust, desire, prodigality and generosity; depending on whether the card is well or ill dignified.</p>
<p>Geburah of HB:Y (Quarrelling and fighting).</p>
<p>This Decan hath its beginning from the Royal Star of Leo: and unto it are allotted the two great Angels of the Schemhamphorash HB:VHVYH and HB:YLYAL.</p>
<p>[The proper meaning of the small cards is to be found by making thorough meditation and harmony between these four symbols of each card. It will be seen that this is how the meanings have been done; but the advanced student can go beyond this rude working.]</p>
<p><strong>XXII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF VICTORY</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Six of Wands"</strong></p>
<p>TWO hands in grip as the last, holding six wands crossed three and three. Flames issue from the point of junction. Above and below are short wands with flames issuing, surmounted respectively by the symbols of Jupiter and Leo, representing the Decan.</p>
<p>Victory after strife: Love: pleasure gained by labour: carefulness, sociability and avoiding of strife, yet victory therein: also insolence, and pride of riches and success, etc. The whole dependent on the dignity.</p>
<p>Tiphareth of HB:Y (Gain).</p>
<p>Hereunto are allotted the great Angels HB:SYTAL and HB:a'aLMYH of the Schemhamphorash.</p>
<p><strong>XXIII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF VALOUR</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Seven of Wands"</strong></p>
<p>TWO hands holding by grip six wands, three crossed. A third hand issuing from a cloud at the lower part of the card, holding an upright wand which passes between the others. Flames leap from the point of junction. Above and below the central wand are the symbols of Mars and Leo, representing the Decan.</p>
<p>Possible victory, depending on the energy and courage exercised; valour; opposition, obstacles and difficulties, yet courage to meet them; quarrelling, ignorance, pretence, and wrangling, and threatening; also victory in small and unimportant things: and influence upon subordinates.</p>
<p>Netzach of HB:Y (Opposition, yet courage).</p>
<p>Therein rule the two great Angels HB:MHShYH and HB:LLHAL of the Schemhamphorash.</p>
<p><strong>XXIV</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF PRUDENCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Eight of Pentacles"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, issuing from a cloud, and grasping a branch of a rose tree, with four white roses thereon, which touch only the four lowermost Pentacles. No rosebuds even, but only leaves, touch the four uppermost disks. All the Pentacles are similar to that of the Ace, but without the Maltese cross and wings. They are arranged like the geomantic figure Populus. Above and below them are the symbols Sun and Virgo for the Decan.</p>
<p>Over-careful in small things at the expense of great: "Penny wise and pound foolish": gain of ready money in small sums; mean; avaricious; industrious; cultivation of land; hoarding, lacking in enterprise.</p>
<p>Hod of HB:H (Skill: prudence: cunning).</p>
<p>Therein rule those mighty Angels HB:AKAYH and HB:KHThAL.</p>
<p><strong>XXV</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF MATERIAL GAIN</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Nine of Pentacles"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, holding a rose branch with nine white roses, each of which touches a Pentacle. The Pentacles are arranged thus * * * * * * * * * : and there are rosebuds on the branches as well as flowers. Venus and Virgo above and below.</p>
<p>Complete realization of material gain, good, riches; inheritance; covetous; treasuring of goods; and sometimes theft and knavery. The whole according to dignity. Yesod of HB:H (Inheritance, much increase of goods).</p>
<p>Herein those mighty Angels HB:HZYAL and HB:ALDYH have rule and dominion.</p>
<p><strong>XXVI</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF WEALTH</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Ten of Pentacles"</strong></p>
<p>AN Angelic Hand, holding by the lower extremity a branch whose roses touch all the Pentacles. No buds, however, are shewn. The symbols of Mercury and Virgo&lt;&gt; are above and below.</p>
<p>The Pentacles are thus arranged * * * * * * * * * *. Completion of material gain and fortune; but nothing beyond: as it were, at the very pinnacle of success. Old age, slothfulness; great wealth, yet sometimes loss in part; heaviness; dullness of mind, yet clever and prosperous in money transactions.</p>
<p>Malkuth of HB:H (Riches and wealth).</p>
<p>Herein are HB:LAVYH and HB:HHa'aYH set over this Decan as Angel Rulers.</p>
<p><strong>XXVII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF PEACE RESTORED</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Two of Swords or Pikes"</strong></p>
<p>Two crossed swords, like the air dagger of a Z.A.M., each held by a White Radiant Angelic Hand. Upon the point where the two cross is a rose of five petals, emitting white rays. At the top and bottom of the card are two small daggers, supporting respectively the symbol {Crescent moon with horns upward} thus, and Libra representing the Decanate.</p>
<p>Contradictory characters in the same nature, strength through suffering; pleasure after pain. Sacrifice and trouble, yet strength arising therefrom, symbolized by the position of the rose, as though the pain itself had brought forth beauty. Arrangement, peace restored; truce; truth and untruth; sorrow and sympathy. Aid to the weak; arrangement; justice, unselfishness; also a tendency to repetition of affronts on being pardoned; injury when meaning well; given to petitions; also a want of tact, and asking question of little moment; talkative.</p>
<p>Chokmah of Vau. Quarrel made up, yet still some tension in relations: actions sometimes selfish, sometimes unselfish.</p>
<p>Herein rule the Great Angels HB:YZLAL and HB:MNHAL.</p>
<p><strong>XXVIII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF SORROW</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Three of Swords or Spears"</strong></p>
<p>THREE White Radiating Angelic Hands, issuing from clouds, and holding three swords upright (as though the central sword had struck apart the two others, which were crossed in the preceding symbol): the central sword cuts asunder the rose of five petals, which in the previous symbol grew at the junction of the swords; its petals are falling, and no white rays issue from it.</p>
<p>Above and below the central sword are the symbols of Saturn and Libra.</p>
<p>Disruption, interruption, separation, quarrelling; sowing of discord and strife, mischief-making, sorrow and tears; yet mirth in Platonic pleasures; singing, faithfulness in promises, honesty in money transactions, selfish and dissipated, yet sometimes generous: deceitful in words and repetitions; the whole according to dignity.</p>
<p>Binah of HB:V (Unhappiness, sorrow, and tears).</p>
<p>Herein rule the Great Angels HB:HRYAL and HB:HQMYH as Lords of the Decan.</p>
<p><strong>XXIX</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF REST FROM STRIFE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Four of Swords"</strong></p>
<p>TWO White Radiating Angelic Hands, each holding two swords; which four cross in the centre. The rose of five petals with white radiations is reinstated on the point of their intersection. Above and below, on the points of two small daggers, are Jupiter&lt;&gt; and Libra, representing the Decanate.</p>
<p>Rest from sorrow; yet after and through it. Peace from and after war. Relaxation of anxiety. Quietness, rest, ease and plenty, yet after struggle. Goods of this life; abundance; modified by dignity as is usual.</p>
<p>Chesed of HB:V (Convalescence, recovery from sickness; change for the better).</p>
<p>Herein do HB:LAVYH and HB:KLYAL bear rule.</p>
<p><strong>XXX</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF LOSS IN PLEASURE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Five of Cups or Chalices"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, holding lotuses or water-lilies, of which the flowers are falling right and left. Leaves only, and no buds, surmount them. These lotus stems ascend between the cups in the manner of a fountain, but no water flows therefrom; neither is there water in any of the cups, which are somewhat of the shape of the magical instrument of the Zelator Adeptus Minor.</p>
<p>Above and below are the symbols of Mars and Scorpio for the Decan.</p>
<p>Death, or end of pleasure: disappointment, sorrow and loss in those things from which pleasure is expected. Sadness, treachery, deceit; ill-will, detraction; charity and kindness ill requited; all kinds of anxieties and troubles from unsuspected and unexpected sources.</p>
<p>Geburah of HB:H (Disappointment in love, marriage broken off, unkindness of a friend; loss of friendship).</p>
<p>Herein rule HB:LVVYH and HB:PHLYH. XXXI</p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF PLEASURE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Six of Chalices"</strong></p>
<p>AN Angelic Hand, as before, holds a group of stems of water-lilies or lotuses, from which six flowers bend, one over each cup. From these flowers a white glistening water flows into the cups as from a fountain, but they are not yet full. Above and below are Sun and Scorpio referring to the Decan.</p>
<p>Commencement of steady increase, gain and pleasure; but commencement only. Also affront, detection, knowledge, and in some instances contention and strife arising from unwarranted self-assertion and vanity. Sometimes thankless and presumptuous; sometimes amiable and patient. According to dignity as usual.</p>
<p>Tiphareth of HB:H (Beginning of wish, happiness, success, or enjoyment).</p>
<p>Therein rule HB:NLKAL and HB:YYYAL.</p>
<p><strong>XXXII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF ILLUSIONARY SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Seven of Chalices"</strong></p>
<p>THE seven cups are arranged as two descending triangles above a point: a hand, as usual, holds lotus stems which arise from the central lower cup. The hand is above this cup and below the middle one. With the exception of the central lower cup, each is overhung by a lotus flower, but no water falls from these into any of the cups, which are all quite empty. Above and below are the symbols of the Decanate Venus and Scorpio.</p>
<p>Possible victory, but neutralized by the supineness of the person: illusionary success, deception in the moment of apparent victory. Lying, error, promises unfulfilled. Drunkenness, wrath, vanity. Lust, fornication, violence against women, selfish dissipation, deception in love and friendship. Often success gained, but not followed up. Modified as usual by dignity.</p>
<p>Netzach of HB:H (Lying, promises unfulfilled; illusion, deception, error; slight success at outset, not retained).</p>
<p>Herein the Angels HB:MLHAL and HB:ChHVYH rule.</p>
<p><strong>XXXIII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF SWIFTNESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Eight of Wands or Torches"</strong></p>
<p>FOUR White Radiating Angelic Hands (two proceeding from each side) issuant from clouds; clasped in two pairs in the centre with the grip of the First Order. They hold eight wands, crossed four with four. Flames issue from the point of junction. Surmountin<br />
<br />
he small wands with flames issuing down them, and placed in the centre at the top and bottom of the card respectively, are the symbols of Mercury and Sagittarius for the Decan.</p>
<p>Too much force applied too suddenly. Very rapid rush, but quickly passed and expended. Violent, but not lasting. Swiftness, rapidity, courage, boldness, confidence, freedom, warfare, violence; love of open air, field-sports, gardens and meadows. Generous, subtle, eloquent, yet somewhat untrustworthy; rapacious, insolent, oppressive. Theft and robbery. According to dignity.</p>
<p>Hod of HB:Y (Hasty communications and messages; swiftness).</p>
<p>Therein rule the Angels HB:NThHYH and HB:HAAYH.</p>
<p><strong>XXXIV</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF GREAT STRENGTH</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Nine of Wands or Torches"</strong></p>
<p>FOUR hands, as in the previous symbol, holding eight wands crossed four and four; but a fifth hand at the foot of the card holds another wand upright, which traverses the point of junction with the others: flames leap herefrom. Above and below are the symbols Moon and Sagittarius.</p>
<p>Tremendous and steady force that cannot be shaken. Herculean strength, yet sometimes scientifically applied. Great success, but with strife and energy. Victory, preceded by apprehension and fear. Health good, and recovery not in doubt. Generous, questioning and curious; fond of external appearances: intractable, obstinate.</p>
<p>Yesod of HB:Y (Strength, power, health, recovery from sickness).</p>
<p>Herein rule the Angels HB:YRThAL and HB:ShAHYH.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XXXV</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF OPPRESSION</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Ten of Wands"</strong></p>
<p>FOUR hands holding eight wands crossed as before. A fifth hand holding two wands upright, which traverses the junction of the others. Flames issuant. Saturn and Sagittarius.</p>
<p>Cruel and overbearing force and energy, but applied only to material and selfish ends. Sometimes shows failure in a matter, and the opposition too strong to be controlled; arising from the person's too great selfishness at the beginning. Ill-will, levity, lying, malice, slander, envy, obstinacy; swiftness in evil and deceit, if ill dignified. Also generosity, disinterestedness and self-sacrifice, when well dignified.</p>
<p>Malkuth of HB:V (Cruelty, malice, revenge, injustice).</p>
<p>Therein rule HB:RYYAL and HB:AVMAL.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XXXVI</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF HARMONIOUS CHANGE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Two of Disks or Pentacles"</strong></p>
<p>TWO wheels, disks or pentacles, similar to that of the Ace. They are united by a green-and-gold serpent, bound about them like a figure of 8. It holds its tail in its mouth. A White Radiant Angelic Hand holds the centre of the whole. No roses enter into this card. Above and below are the symbols of Jupiter and Capricorn. It is a revolving symbol.</p>
<p>The harmony of change, alternation of gain and loss; weakness and strength; everchanging occupation; wandering, discontented with any fixed condition of things; now elated, then melancholy; industrious, yet unreliable; fortunate through prudence of management, yet sometimes unaccountably foolish; alternatively talkative and suspicious. Kind, yet wavering and inconsistent. Fortunate in journeying. Argumentative.</p>
<p>Chokmah of HB:H (Pleasant change, visit to friends).</p>
<p>Herein the Angels HB:LKBAL and HB:VShRYH have rule.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XXXVII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF MATERIAL WORKS</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Three of Pentacles"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE-WINGED Angelic Hand, as before, holding a branch of a rose tree, of which two white rosebuds touch and surmount the topmost Pentacle. The Pentacles are arranged in an equilateral triangle. Above and below the symbols Mars and Capricorn.</p>
<p>Working and constructive force, building up, creation, erection; realization and increase of material things; gain in commercial transactions, rank; increase of substance, influence, cleverness in business, selfishness. Commencement of matters to be established later. Narrow and prejudiced. Keen in matters of gain; sometimes given to seeking after impossibilities.</p>
<p>Binah of HB:H (Business, paid employment, commercial transaction).</p>
<p>Herein are HB:YChVYH and HB:LHChYH Angelic Rulers.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XXXVIII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF EARTHLY POWER</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Four of Pentacles"</strong></p>
<p>A HAND holding a branch of a rose tree, but without flowers or buds, save that in the centre is one fully blown white rose. Pentacles are disposed as on the points of a square; a rose in its centre. Symbols Sun and Capricorn above and below to represent the Decan.</p>
<p>Assured material gain: success, rank, dominion, earthy power, completed but leading to nothing beyond. Prejudicial, covetous, suspicious, careful and orderly, but discontented. Little enterprise or originality. According to dignity as usual.</p>
<p>Chesed of HB:H (Gain of money or influence: a present).</p>
<p>Herein do HB:KVQYH and HB:MNDAL bear rule.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XXXIX</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF DEFEAT</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Five of Swords"</strong></p>
<p>TWO Rayed Angelic Hands each holding two swords nearly upright, but falling apart of each other, right and left of the card. A third hand holds a sword upright in the centre as though it had disunited them. The petals of the rose, which in the four had been reinstated in the centre, are torn asunder and falling. Above and below are Venus and Aquarius for Decan.</p>
<p>Contest finished and decided against the person; failure, defeat, anxiety, trouble, poverty, avarice, grieving after gain, laborious, unresting; loss and vileness of nature; malicious, slanderous, lying, spiteful and tale-bearing. A busybody and separator of friends, hating to see peace and love between others. Cruel, yet cowardly, thankless and unreliable. Clever and quick in thought and speech. Feelings of pity easily roused, but unenduring.</p>
<p>Geburah of HB:V (Defeat, loss, malice, spite, slander, evil-speaking).</p>
<p>Herein the Angels HB:ANYAL and HB:Cha'aMYH bear rule.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XL</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF EARNED SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Six of Swords"</strong></p>
<p>TWO hands, as before, each holding two swords which cross in the centre. Rose re-established thereon. Mercury and Aquarius above and below, supported on the points of two short daggers or swords.</p>
<p>Success after anxiety and trouble; self-esteem, beauty, conceit, but sometimes modesty therewith; dominance, patience, labour, etc.</p>
<p>Tiphareth of HB:V (Labour, work, journey by water).</p>
<p>Ruled by the Great Angels HB:RHa'aAL and HB:YYVHL.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XLI</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF UNSTABLE EFFORT</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Seven of Swords"</strong></p>
<p>TWO Angelic Radiating Hands as before, each holding three swords. A third hand holds up a single sword in the centre. The points of all the swords "just touch" each other, the central sword not altogether dividing them.</p>
<p>The Rose of the previous symbols of this suit is held up by the same hand which holds the central sword: as if the victory were at its disposal. Symbols of Moon and Aquarius.</p>
<p>Partial success. Yielding when victory is within grasp, as if the last reserves of strength were used up. Inclination to lose when on the point of gaining, through not continuing the effort. Love of abundance, fascinated by display, given to compliments, affronts and insolences, and to spy upon others. Inclined to betray confidences, not always intentionally. Rather vacillatory and unreliable.</p>
<p>Netzach of HB:V (Journey by land: in character untrustworthy).</p>
<p>Herein rule the Great Angels HB:HHHAL and HB:Ma'aKAL.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XLII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF ABANDONED SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Eight of Chalices"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, holding a group of stems of lotuses or water-lilies. There are only two flowers shown, which bend over the two central cups, pouring into them a white water which fills them and runs over into the three lowest, which later are not yet filled U U U The three uppermost are quite empty. At the top and U U bottom of the card are symbols Saturn and Pisces. U U U</p>
<p>Temporary success, but without further results. Thing thrown aside as soon as gained. Not lasting, even in the matter in hand. Indolence in success. Journeying from place to place. Misery and repining without cause. Seeking after riches. Instability.</p>
<p>Hod of HB:H (Success abandoned; decline of interest).</p>
<p>The Angels ruling are HB:VVLYH and HB:YLHYH.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XLIII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF MATERIAL HAPPINESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Nine of Chalices"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand, issuing from a cloud holding lotus or water-lilies, one flower of which overhangs each cup; from it a white water pours. Cups are arranged in three rows of 3. Jupiter and Pisces above and below.</p>
<p>Complete and perfect realization of pleasure and happiness, almost perfect; self-praise, vanity, conceit, much talking of self, yet kind and lovable, and may be self-denying therewith. High-minded, not easily satisfied with small and limited ideas. Apt to be maligned through too much self-assumption. A good and generous, but sometimes foolish nature.</p>
<p>Yesod of HB:H (Complete success, pleasure and happiness, wishes fulfilled). Therein rule the Angels HB:SALYH and HB:a'aRYAL.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XLIV</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF PERFECTED SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Ten of Cups or Chalices"</strong></p>
<p>HAND, as usual, holding bunch of water-lilies or lotuses, whose flowers pour a white water into all the cups, which "all run over." The uppermost cup is held sideways by a hand, and pours water into the left-hand upper cup. A single lotus flower surmounts the top cup, and is the source of the water that fills it. Above and below the symbols Mars and Pisces.</p>
<p>Permanent and lasting success and happiness, because inspired from above. Not so sensual as "Lord of Material Happiness," yet almost more truly happy. Pleasure, dissipation, debauchery, quietness, peacemaking. Kindness, pity, generosity, wantonness, waste, etc., according to dignity.</p>
<p>Malkuth of HB:H (Matter settled: complete good fortune).</p>
<p>Herein the Great Angels HB:a'aShLYH and HB:MYHAL rule.</p>
<p>[This is not such a good card as stated. It represents boredom, and quarrelling arising therefrom; disgust springing from too great luxury. In particular it represents drug-habits, the sottish excess of pleasure and the revenge of nature.]<br />
</p>
<p><strong>XLV</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF DOMINION</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Two of Wands"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiating Angelic hand, issuing from clouds, and grasping two crossed wands. Flames issue from the point of junction. On two small wands above and below, with flames of five issuing therefrom, are the symbols of Mars and Aries for the Decan.</p>
<p>Strength, domination, harmony of rule and of justice. Boldness, courage, fierceness, shamelessness, revenge, resolution, generous, proud, sensitive, ambitious, refined, restless, turbulent, sagacious withal, yet unforgiving and obstinate.</p>
<p>Chokmah of HB:Y (Influence over others, authority, power, dominion).</p>

</p>
<p><strong>XLVI</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF ESTABLISHED STRENGTH</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Three of Wands"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, as before, issuing from clouds and grasping three wands in the centre (two crossed, the third upright). Flames issue from the point of junction. Above and below are the symbols Sun and Aries.</p>
<p>Established force, strength, realization of hope. Completion of labour. Success after struggle. Pride, nobility, wealth, power, conceit. Rude self-assumption and insolence. Generosity, obstinacy, etc.</p>
<p>Binah of HB:Y (Pride, arrogance, self-assertion).</p>
<p>Herein rule the Angels HB:HHShYH and HB:a'aMMYH.</p>
<p>[This card is much better than as described.]</p>
<p><strong>XLVII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF PERFECTED WORK</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Four of Wands"</strong></p>
<p>TWO White Radiating Angelic Hands, as before, issuing from clouds right and left of the card and clasped in the centre with the grip of the First Order, holding four wands or torches crossed. Flames issue from the point of junction. Above and below are two small flaming wands, with the symbols of Venus and Aries representing the Decan.</p>
<p>Perfection or completion of a thing built up with trouble and labour. Rest after labour, subtlety, cleverness, beauty, mirth, success in completion. Reasoning faculty, conclusions drawn from previous knowledge. Unreadiness, unreliable and unsteady through over-anxiety and hurriedness of action. Graceful in manner, at times insincere, etc.</p>
<p>Chesed of HB:Y (Settlement, arrangement, completion).</p>
<p>Herein are HB:NNAAL and HB:NYThHL Angelic rulers.</p>
<p><strong>XLVIII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF MATERIAL TROUBLE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Five of Pentacles"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand issuing from clouds, and holding a branch of the white rose tree, but from which the roses are falling, and leaving no buds behind. Five Pentacles similar to the Ace. Above and below are Mercury and Taurus.</p>
<p>Loss of money or position. Trouble about material things. Labour, toil, land cultivation; building, knowledge and acuteness of earthly things, poverty, carefulness, kindness; sometimes money regained after severe toil and labour. Unimaginative, harsh, stern, determined, obstinate.</p>
<p>Geburah of HB:H (Loss of profession, loss of money, monetary anxiety).</p>
<p>Herein the angels HB:MBHYH and HB:PNYAL rule.</p>
<p><strong>XLIX</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF MATERIAL SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Six of Pentacles"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand holding a rose branch with white roses and buds, each of which touches a Pentacle. Pentacles are arranged in two columns of three each * * * * * * * *. Above and below are the symbols Taurus and Moon of the Decan.</p>
<p>Success and gain in material undertakings. Power, influence, rank, nobility, rule over the people. Fortunate, successful, liberal and just.</p>
<p>If ill dignified, may be purse-proud, insolent from excess, or prodigal.</p>
<p>Tiphareth of HB:H (Success in material things, prosperity in business).</p>
<p>Herein rule the Angels HB:NMMYH and HB:YYLAL.</p>
<p><strong>L</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF SUCCESS UNFULFILLED</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Seven of Pentacles"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand issuing from a cloud, and holding a white rose branch. Seven Pentacles arranged like the geomantic figure Rubeus. There are only five buds, which overhang, but do not touch the five uppermost Pentacles. Above and below are the Decan symbols, Saturn and Taurus respectively.</p>
<p>Promises of success unfulfilled. (Shewn, as it were, by the fact that the rosebuds do not come to anything.) Loss of apparently promising fortune. Hopes deceived and crushed. Disappointment, misery, slavery, necessity and baseness. A cultivator of land, and yet a loser thereby. Sometimes it denotes slight and isolated gains with no fruits resulting therefrom, and of no further account, though seeming to promise well.</p>
<p>Netzach of HB:H (Unprofitable speculations and employments; little gain for much labour).</p>
<p>Therein HB:HRChAL and HB:MTzRAL are ruling Angels.</p>
<p><strong>LI</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF SHORTENED FORCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Eight of Swords"</strong></p>
<p>FOUR White Radiant Angelic Hands issuing from clouds, each holding two swords, points upwards; all the points touch near the top of the card. Hands issue, two at each bottom angle of the card. The pose of the other sword symbols is re-established in the centre. Above and below are the Decan symbols Jupiter and Gemini.</p>
<p>Too much force applied to small things: too much attention to detail at the expense of the principal and more important points. When ill dignified, these qualities produce malice, pettiness, and domineering characteristics. Patience in detail of study; great care in some things, counterbalanced by equal disorder in others. Impulsive; equally fond of giving or receiving money or presents; generous, clever, acute, selfish and without strong feeling of affection. Admires wisdom, yet applies it to small and unworthy objects.</p>
<p>Hod of HB:V (Narrow, restricted, petty, a prison).</p>
<p>Therein rule the Angels HB:VMBAL and HB:YHHAL.</p>
<p><strong>LII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF DESPAIR AND CRUELTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Nine of Swords"</strong></p>
<p>FOUR Hands, as in the preceding figure, hold eight swords nearly upright, but with the points falling away from each other. A fifth hand holds a ninth sword upright in the centre, as if it had struck them asunder. No rose at all is shewn, as if it were not merely cut asunder, but utterly destroyed. Above and below are the Decan symbols Mars and Gemini.</p>
<p>Despair, cruelty, pitilessness, malice, suffering, want, loss, misery. Burden, oppression, labour, subtlety and craft, dishonesty, lying and slander.</p>
<p>Yet also obedience, faithfulness, patience, unselfishness, etc. According to dignity.</p>
<p>Yesod of HB:V (Illness, suffering, malice, cruelty, pain).</p>
<p>Therein do HB:a'aNVAL and HB:MChYAL bear rule.</p>
<p><strong>LIII</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF RUIN</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Ten of Swords"</strong></p>
<p>FOUR hands holding eight swords, as in the preceding symbol; the points falling away from each other. Two hands hold two swords crossed in the centre, as though their junction had disunited the others. No rose, flower or bud, is shewn. Above and below are Sun and Gemini, representing the Decan.</p>
<p>Almost a worse symbol than the Nine of Swords. Undisciplined, warring force, complete disruption and failure. Ruin of all plans and projects. Disdain, insolence and impertinence, yet mirth and jollity therewith. A marplot, loving to overthrow the happiness of others; a repeater of things; given to much unprofitable speech, and of many words. Yet clever, eloquent, etc., according to dignity.</p>
<p>Malkuth of HB:V (Ruin, death, defeat, disruption).</p>
<p>Herein the Angels HB:DMBYH and HB:MNQAL reign.</p>
<p><strong>LIV</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF LOVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Two of Chalices"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiant Hand, issuant from the lower part of the card from a cloud, holds lotuses. A lotus flower rises above water, which occupies the lower part of the card rising above the hand. From this flower rises a stem, terminating near the top of the card in another lotus, from which flows a sparkling white water, as from a fountain. Crossed on the stem just beneath are two dolphins, Argent and Or, on to which the water falls, and from which it pours in full streams, like jets of gold and silver, into two cups; which in their turn overflow, flooding the lower part of the card. Venus and Cancer above and below.</p>
<p>Harmony of masculine and feminine united. Harmony, pleasure, mirth, subtlety: but if ill dignified --- folly, dissipation, waste, silly actions.</p>
<p>Chokmah of HB:H (Marriage, love, pleasure).</p>
<p>Therein rule the Angels HB:AVa'aAL and HB:ChBVYH.</p>
<p><strong>LV</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF ABUNDANCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Three of Chalices"</strong></p>
<p>A WHITE Radiating Hand, as before, holds a group of lotuses or water-lilies, from which two flowers rise on either side of, and overhanging the top cup; pouring into it the white water. Flowers in the same way pour white water into the lower cups. All the cups overflow; the topmost into the two others, and these upon the lower part of the card. Cups are arranged in an erect equilateral triangle. Mercury and Cancer above and below.</p>
<p>Abundance, plenty, success, pleasure, sensuality, passive success, good luck and fortune; love, gladness, kindness, liberality.</p>
<p>Binah of HB:H (Plenty, hospitality, eating and drinking, pleasure, dancing, new clothes, merriment).</p>
<p>Therein the Angels HB:RAHAL and HB:YBMYH are lords.</p>
<p><strong>LVI</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LORD OF BLENDED PLEASURE</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Four of Chalices"</strong></p>
<p>FOUR cups: the two upper overflowing into the two lower, which do not overflow. An Angelic Hand grasps a branch of lotus, from which ascends a stem bearing one flower at the top of the card, from which the white water flows into the two upper cups. From the centre two leaves pass right and left, making, as it were, a cross between the four cups. Above and below are the symbols Moon and Cancer for the Decan.</p>
<p>Success or pleasure approaching their end. A stationary period in happiness, which may, or may not, continue. It does not mean love and marriage so much as the previous symbol. It is too passive a symbol to represent perfectly complete happiness. Swiftness, hunting and pursuing. Acquisition by contention: injustice sometimes; some drawbacks to pleasure implied.</p>
<p>Chesed of HB:H (Receiving pleasure or kindness from others, but some discomfort therewith).</p>
<p>Therein rule the great Angels HB:HYYAL and HB:MVMYH.</p>
<p><strong>BRIEF MEANING OF TWENTY-TWO KEYS</strong></p>
<p>0. IF the question refers to spiritual matters, the Fool means idea, thought, spirituality, that which endeavours to transcend Earth. But if question is material, it means folly, stupidity, eccentricity, or even mania. 1. Skill, wisdom, adaptation, craft, cunning, or occult wisdom or power. 2. Change, alternation, increase and decrease, fluctuation; whether for good or evil depends on the dignity. 3. Beauty, happiness, pleasure, success. But with very bad dignity it means luxury, dissipation. 4. War, conquest, victory, strife, ambition. 5. Divine wisdom, manifestation, explanation, teaching, occult force voluntarily invoked. 6. Inspiration (passive, mediumistic), motive power, action. 7. Triumph, victory, health (sometimes unstable). 8. Eternal justice. Strength and force, but arrested as in act of judgment. May mean law, trial, etc. 9. Wisdom from on high. Active divine inspiration. Sometimes "unexpected current." 10. Good fortune, happiness (within bounds). Intoxication of success. 11. Courage, strength, fortitude, power passing on to action. Obstinacy. 12. Enforced sacrifice, punishment, loss, fatal and not voluntary, suffering. 13. Time, age, transformation, change involuntary (as opposed to 18, Pisces). Or death, destruction (only latter with special cards). [Specially, a sudden and quite unexpected change.] 14. Combination of forces, realization, action (material effect, good or evil). 15. Materiality, material force, material temptation, obsession. 16. Ambition, fighting, war, courage, or destruction, danger, fall, ruin. 17. Hope, faith, unexpected help. Or dreaminess, deceived hope, etc. 18. Dissatisfaction, voluntary change. Error, lying, falsity, deception. This card is very sensitive to dignity. 19. Glory, gain, riches. With "very" evil cards it means arrogance, display, vanity. 20. Final decision, judgment, sentence, determination of a matter without appeal, "on its plane." 21. The matter itself. Synthesis, world, kingdom. Usually denotes actual subject of question, and therefore depends entirely on accompanying cards. [This table is very unsatisfactory. Each card must be most carefully meditated, taking all its correspondences, and a clear idea formed.] Princes and Queens shew almost always actual men and women connected with the matter. But the Kings (Knights) sometime represent coming or going of a matter, according as they face.</p>
<p>The Princesses shew opinions, thoughts, ideas, either in harmony with or opposed to, the subject.</p>

<p><strong>OF THE DIGNITIES</strong></p>
<p>A CARD is strong or weak, well dignified or ill dignified, according to the cards next to it on either side.</p>
<p>Cards of the same suit on either side strengthen it greatly, for good or evil according to their nature.</p>
<p>Cards of opposite natures on either side weaken it greatly, for either good or evil.</p>
<p>Swords are inimical to Pentacles.</p>
<p>Wands are inimical to Cups.</p>
<p>Swords are friendly with Cups and Wands.</p>
<p>Wands are friendly with Swords and Pentacles.</p>
<p>If a card fall between two other which are mutually contrary, it is not much affected by either.</p>
<p><strong>A METHOD OF DIVINATION BY THE TAROT</strong></p>
<p>[This method is that given to students of the grade Adept Adeptus Minor in the R. R. et A. C. But it has been revised and improved, while certain safeguards have been introduced in order to make its abuse impossible. --- O.M.]</p>
<p>1. THE Significator. Choose a card to represent the Querent, using your knowledge or judgment of his character rather than dwelling on his physical characteristics. 2. Take the cards in your left hand. In the right hand hold the wand over them, and say: I invoke thee, I A O, that thou wilt send H R U, the great Angel that is set over the operations of this Secret Wisdom, to lay his hand invisibly upon these consecrated cards of art, that thereby we may obtain true knowledge of hidden things, to the glory of thine ineffable Name. Amen. 3. Hand the cards to Querent, and bid him think of the question attentively, and cut. 4. Take the cards as cut, and hold as for dealing. "First Operation"</p>
<p>This shows the situation of the Querent at the time when he consults you.</p>
<p>1. The pack being in front of you, cut, and place the top half to the left. 2. Cut each pack again to the left. 3. These four stack represent I H V H, from right to left. 4. Find the Significator. It be in the HB:Y pack, the question refers to work, business, etc.; if in the HB:H pack, to love, marriage, or pleasure; if in the HB:H pack, to money, goods, and such purely material matters. 5. Tell the Querent what he has come for: if wrong, abandon the divination. 6. If right, spread out the pack containing the Significator, face upwards. Count the cards from him, in the direction in which he faces. The counting should include the card from which you count. For Knights, Queens and Princes, count 4. For Princesses, count 7. For Aces, count 11. For small cards, count according to the number. For trumps, count 3 for the elemental trumps; 9 for the planetary trumps; 12 for the Zodiacal trumps. Make a "story" of these cards. This story is that of the beginning of the affair. 7. Pair the cards on either side of the Significator, then those outside them, and so on. Make another "story," which should fill in the details omitted in the first. 8. If this story is not quite accurate, do not be discouraged. Perhaps the Querent himself does not know everything. But the main lines ought to be laid down firmly, with correctness, or the divination should be abandoned. "Second Operation"</p>
<p>Development of the Question</p>
<p>1. Shuffle, invoke suitably, and let Querent cut as before. 2. Deal cards into twelve stacks, for the twelve astrological houses of heaven. 3. Make up your mind in which stack you ought to find the Significator, "e.g." in the seventh house if the question concerns marriage, and so on. 4. Examine this chosen stack. If the Significator is not there, try some cognate house. On a second failure, abandon the divination. 5. Read the stack counting and pairing as before. "Third Operation"</p>
<p>Further Development of the Question</p>
<p>1. Shuffle, etc., as before. 2. Deal cards into twelve stacks for the twelve signs of the Zodiac. 3. Divine the proper stack and proceed as before. "Fourth Operation"</p>
<p>Penultimate Aspects of the Question</p>
<p>1. Shuffle, etc., as before. 2. Find the Significator: set him upon the table; let the thirty-six cards following form a ring round him. 3. Count and pair as before. [Note that the nature of each Decan is shewn by the small card attributed to it, and by the symbols given in Liber DCCLXXVII, cols. 149-151.] "Fifth Operation"</p>
<p>Final Result</p>
<p>1. Shuffle, etc., as before. 2. Deal into ten packs in the form of the Tree of Life. 3. Make up your mind where the Significator should be, as before; but failure does not here necessarily imply that the divination has gone astray. 4. Count and pair as before. [Note that one cannot tell at what part of the divination the present time occurs. Usually Op. 1 seems to indicate the past history of the question; but not always so. Experience will teach. Sometimes a new current of high help may show the moment of consultation. I may add that in material matters this method is extremely valuable. I have been able to work out the most complex problems in minute detail. O.M.]</p>
