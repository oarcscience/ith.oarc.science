# Specimens of Ainu Folk-lore.

### by John Batchelor

###### \[Tokyo, 1888-1893\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These folktales were originally published in the *Transactions of the
Asiatic Society of Japan* in three installments. The printed original is
in parallel columns with the Ainu alongside Batchelor's English
translations, and these Ainu versions are still considered a valuable
source today (one of them was retranslated by Donald Philippi in his
excellent collection *Songs of Gods, Songs of Humans* \[Tokyo, 1979\]);
the untranslated Ainu has, however, been eliminated in this version.

John Batchelor was an Englishman and a missionary to the Ainu for a
large part of his life. Because of his calling, he needs to be
approached with caution as a source, but his large output of Ainu
studies is still one of the primary sources for 19th century Ainu life.
He is also mildly condescending toward his subjects, but unlike the book
*[Aino Folk-Tales](../aft/index)*, also posted at Intangible Textual
Heritage, the author of this collection shows at times a genuine
appreciation for the Ainu as people and for their *yukar* as literature.
