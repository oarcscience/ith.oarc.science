<H2 ALIGN="center">X.&#8212;THE LEGEND OF HOW THE YOUNGER SISTER OF THE WOLF-GOD WAS GIVEN TO ME (<I>to wife</I>.)</H2>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was brought up by my elder sister and always remained at home. I was reared in this wise:&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron<A NAME="page_216_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_216_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and wooden beams (<I>of our house</I>) were painted in diverse colours. Upon the iron beams were placed<A NAME="page_216_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_216_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> pictures of swords

<!------------------------page 217------------------------>

<A NAME="page_217"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 217</FONT></A>

and spears. By night these pictures of swords and spears became living gods<A NAME="page_217_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_217_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> and flashed about blindingly.<A NAME="page_217_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_217_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> The brightness of these tools and sharp instruments lit up the inside of the house during the darkness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst things were in this state it was said that, the inhabitants of Kunashiri and Shumashiri<A NAME="page_217_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_217_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A> were beyond measure brave, and pursued war as a profession. I was so angry at this that I was unable to sleep.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a certain occasion my elder sister cooked two days'<A NAME="page_217_fr_6"></A><A HREF="#page_217_note_6"><SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP></A> food.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this she covered me up with the bed clothes<A NAME="page_217_fr_7"></A><A HREF="#page_217_note_7"><SUP><SMALL>7</SMALL></SUP></A>

<!------------------------page 218------------------------>

<A NAME="page_218"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 218</FONT></A>

and, when I judged her to be fast asleep, I arose and girded on my sword.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then set out for Kunashiri and Shumashiri.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I went along a pretty little water-way opened up (<I>before me</I>). So I came to the river's mouth, and, a little mountain<A NAME="page_218_fr_8"></A><A HREF="#page_218_note_8"><SUP><SMALL>8</SMALL></SUP></A> like fog was (<I>I saw</I>) sitting upon a log of wood which had been cast up by the waves of the sea.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went up to it; and this is what I saw:&#8212;An Ainu woman dressed in white clothing. The little woman looked as though she had come with a message; nevertheless I spake thus her:&#8212;"Look here, I am a person so brave that I cut down fast speakers ere they have finished talking, and slow talkers at the beginning of their speech. (<I>So</I>) speak quickly."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I spake the little woman trembled exceedingly;<A NAME="page_218_fr_9"></A><A HREF="#page_218_note_9"><SUP><SMALL>9</SMALL></SUP></A> and,

<!------------------------page 219------------------------>

<A NAME="page_219"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 219</FONT></A>

chewing the sleeve of her dress (<I>as in fear</I>) spake as follows:&#8212;"At the source of this little river I have a blood-relation<A NAME="page_219_fr_10"></A><A HREF="#page_219_note_10"><SUP><SMALL>10</SMALL></SUP></A>&#8212;the Wolf-god. I am his younger sister and have been sent to say this:&#8212;The inhabitants of Kunashiri and Shumashiri are men so brave that neither gods nor men dare approach them, (<I>so that</I>) if even you go there, and alone, it will be bad (<I>for you</I>). My younger sister is a poor worthless creature,<A NAME="page_219_fr_11"></A><A HREF="#page_219_note_11"><SUP><SMALL>11</SMALL></SUP></A> but I will make up for that by giving you some presents with her. So now return from here; it was to say these things (<I>to you</I>) that my elder brother sent me here." So spake she. I was angry at this and therefore struck her fiercely with my sword. I killed her whilst she was rising. Her soul departed with a great sound; but Lo, the shadow of a man appeared at my side; it was,

<!------------------------page 220------------------------>

<A NAME="page_220"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 220</FONT></A>

without doubt, the aforesaid Wolf-god. He had anger depicted upon his countenance. Now this is what he said:&#8212;"It is ridiculous of you, my young Ainu brother, to get angry in this way. What was there improper in the speech I sent my younger sister to deliver to you that made you slay her so suddenly? If it is death that you are seeking, I will slay you as quickly as you slew her."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had so spoken he set upon me with his sword, but as I had no wish to be killed outright I turned myself into wind<A NAME="page_220_fr_12"></A><A HREF="#page_220_note_12"><SUP><SMALL>12</SMALL></SUP></A> and jumped above his sword-sweep.  I (<I>then</I>) attacked him as he had done me. I cut him down as he was rising up. His soul departed with  a great sound, he became a new man<A NAME="page_220_fr_13"></A><A HREF="#page_220_note_13"><SUP><SMALL>13</SMALL></SUP></A> and went round the mountains towards the source of the little river.

<!------------------------page 221------------------------>

<A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A>

After this there was peace. When this was over, I walked fast till I arrived at Kunashiri and Shumashiri.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, having arrived at Kunashiri I stirred up a grievous war from one end of the land to the other. And, as I was carrying on this war single-handed, both day I and night, I found that my clothes (<I>were torn so much that</I>) nothing but the front of my garment hung from my arms. By and by there arose over the distant mountain tops, such a mighty wind<A NAME="page_221_fr_14"></A><A HREF="#page_221_note_14"><SUP><SMALL>14</SMALL></SUP></A> and shadow, and above all, there was the sound of the approach of a great company of the gods. Yea, they came to the place where I was fighting. On seeing the gods fly before the great wind (<I>I recognised them as being</I>) the spears and swords which were placed upon the iron beams of our house; they had become living gods. When they came, the war with the people of Kunashiri and Shumashiri was as nothing, for in a moment their country

<!------------------------page 222------------------------>

<A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A>

was completely laid waste. When this was over, the spears and swords rose up in the air and departed in the same manner as they had come, before a mighty wind.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I returned home. When going along there appeared a great host of gods riding upon a mighty wind. Hovering over me a voice from a god came forth, which said: "Look here, my lad, I have something to say, so pay attention. As for me I am that Poiyaumbe.<A NAME="page_222_fr_15"></A><A HREF="#page_222_note_15"><SUP><SMALL>15</SMALL></SUP></A> I left my home at Shinutapka in wrath because there was nothing but war in the land. And, as I was coming along I heard the voice of a lad crying among the stones; I went therefore to see what it was and found it to be a little lad weeping. Now, Okikurumi<A NAME="page_222_fr_16"></A><A HREF="#page_222_note_16"><SUP><SMALL>16</SMALL></SUP></A> was the governor of

<!------------------------page 223------------------------>

<A NAME="page_223"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 223</FONT></A>

the middle of Ainu-land; and (<I>once upon a time</I>) the devils made war against him with one accord and slew every one of his<A NAME="page_223_fr_17"></A><A HREF="#page_223_note_17"><SUP><SMALL>17</SMALL></SUP></A> men, for the devils were numerous. The wife of Okikurumi took her child upon her back and came to avenge the death of her husband, but she was slain. You were that little child which she took and wrapped up in a garment and put among the stones. As we much desired to avenge you we brought you up in our home; and after our elder sister had reared you and the younger sister of the Wolf-god had come to you, it was settled that you were to govern the middle of Ainu-land. And now without cause you have warred against Kunashiri and Shumashiri, but above all, what evil had the Wolf-god and his sister done that you should have so quickly killed

<!------------------------page 224------------------------>

<A NAME="page_224"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 224</FONT></A>

them? I am angry with you for this and therefore your sister has been led away into captivity, yea, she is even now being taken away. However, these swords and spears, some of which are of your age and some of which are your elders, are your friends and relations."<A NAME="page_224_fr_18"></A><A HREF="#page_224_note_18"><SUP><SMALL>18</SMALL></SUP></A> So spake the voice which came down from the gods.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again I, was angry, and, weeping very bitterly, called after my sister. While weeping I thought to myself&#8212;"however much you weep it will not bring your sister to you"&#8212;so I wiped my face. On arriving at my home I found that my sister and all her furniture and ornaments had, in truth, entirely disappeared. After this I lived alone. Now, one day, I was much surprised to hear people outside. It was the Wolf-god and his sister whom I had killed that were coming; they were bringing a very large bundle<A NAME="page_224_fr_19"></A><A HREF="#page_224_note_19"><SUP><SMALL>19</SMALL></SUP></A> with

<!------------------------page 225------------------------>

<A NAME="page_225"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 225</FONT></A>

them. After this they stayed as servants; then the pictures of spears and swords came to life at night and did nothing but exercise and talk together of old times. I then married the younger sister of the Wolf-god and we live together.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_216_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_216_fr_1">1</A> The word here translated "iron" is, in the original, <I>kane</I>; by some Ainus also pronounced <I>kani</I>. It is doubtful whether <I>kane</I> would not be better rendered by the word "beautiful" than by "iron;" thus we should read,&#8212;"the beautiful wooden beams," &amp;c., (<A HREF="safl06.htm#notes"><I>see Legend VI Vol. XVI., Part II. note on verses 1 and 2.</I></A>)</P>

<P><A NAME="page_216_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_216_fr_2">2</A> "Placed." <I>Charuwatore</I> really means "to be placed in order;" "to be set in rotation." Hence it is doubtful whether the "spears" and "swords" here spoken of were not real rather than mere pictures or paintings, and were carefully placed in order upon the beams as may sometimes be seen in some few Ainu huts to-day.</P>

None but a "well to do" Ainu could have a <I>kosonde</I>, and most likely the word is here used to show that our hero was a chief of the people. The Ainus, however, mainttain that <I>kosonde</I> is a real word whatever <I>kosode</I> may be.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_218_note_8"></A><A HREF="#page_218_fr_8">8</A> "Mountain like fog." <I>Urat</I> or <I>urara</I> is "fog," and <I>tapkop</I> a single, solitary mountain or hill; or a mountain standing quite alone. The "fog" which looked like a "little mountain" turned out to be an Ainu woman, as will be seen hereafter.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_218_note_9"></A><A HREF="#page_218_fr_9">9</A> "Trembled exceedingly." The Ainu words are <I>hottoro kata kotususatki</I>, lit: "she trembled upon her fore-head." This is a phrase used to express great fear; her forehead shook through fear.</P>

The Wolf-god meant to say that his sister was utterly unworthy of the hand of our hero. However, he would make up for that by giving a large dowry or marriage portion with her. It was customary among to Ainus to give some dowry with a bride when she got married.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_220_note_13"></A><A HREF="#page_220_fr_13">13</A> "Became a new man." <I>Pito</I> is often used in Ainu legends and seems to be from the Japanese word <I>hito</I>, "man." The Wolf-god's spirit having been released from the body was renewed, and went off beyond the mountains. The victory belonged to the Ainu.</P>
