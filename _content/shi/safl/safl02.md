## II.—ANOTHER LEGEND OF A FAMINE.

   The following curious lines were sung to me by an aged Ainu to whom I
had just been explaining the dangers and evils of drinking too much
wine, and to whom I had been endeavouring to show how much better it is
to worship God in spirit and in truth than by offering Him wine and
whittled pieces of willow wood. The old man's object in singing this
tradition to me was to enforce upon my mind the fact that,
notwithstanding all I had said, the gods were, at the time of the famine
indicated below, pleased with these offerings, and are still delighted
when the devout worshipper indicates his sincerity by setting these
things before them.

   This song, tradition, legend, or whatever it may be called, is quite
typical of the way in which the Ainu convey their thoughts on religion
and other serious matters to one another; and I give it here as an
example thereof.

|     |                                                                                                                                    |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. | There was something upon the seas bowing and raising its head.                                                                     |
| 2\. | And when they came to see what it was, they found it to be a monstrous sea-lion fast asleep, which they seized and brought ashore. |
| 3\. | Now, when we look at the matter, we find that there was a famine in Ainu-land.                                                     |
| 4\. | And we see that a large <span id="page_120">p. 120</span> sea-lion was cast upon the shores of the mouth of the Saru river.        |
| 5\. | Thus the Ainu were able to eat (i.e. obtained food).                                                                               |
| 6\. | For this reason *inao* and wine were offered to the gods.                                                                          |
| 7\. | So the gods to whom these offering were made were pleased and are pleased.                                                         |

 

   The first and second of these verses are a kind of introductory
statement of the theme. The remote ancestors of the Ainu race are
represented as having seen some large and curious object floating about
upon the tops of the waves of the sea, and rising and falling with them.
The men, therefore, launch their boats and go to see what the object may
be. They find it is a mighty sea-lion (*shietashbe*). They then seize
the animal, and, by some means or other (how is not stated) bring it
ashore.

   The third and fourth verses make known the fact that at this
particular time there was a famine in Ainu-land, and that the Ainu of
to-day, in looking back upon this sad calamity, see in the sleeping
sea-lion the hand of the gods working to preserve the race from
starvation and certain destructicn. This mighty sea-monster is said to
have been cast upon the shores of the mouth of the Saru river. Saru, it
should be remembered, is regarded by the Ainu of the south of Yezo as
the chief district in this island; and the *Shishiri-muka* is the
largest river in Saru.

   Verses six and seven are intended to show that libations of wine and
the offering of *inao* (i.e. whittled pieces of willow wood having the
shavings left attached) have *always* been a well-pleasing <span
id="page_121">p. 121</span> sacrifice to the gods, and therefore are so
now. They pleased the gods at that time, and that they please them *now*
is seen from the fact that food is still extended to the Ainu race.
Hence one great reason why such ancient religious customs should not be
abolished. Hence too, according to Ainu reasoning, this race of men have
no cause to change one form of religion and its accompanying ceremonies
and rites for another. Thus we see that the Ainu, though without
knowledge, are by no means without reason, nor are they so stupid and
easily led as some people may have us suppose.
