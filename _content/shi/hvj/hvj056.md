<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Taki no oto wa  
Taete hisashiku  
  Narinuredo  
Na koso nagarete  
Nao kikoe kere.

THIS waterfall's melodious voice  
  Was famed both far and near;  
Although it long has ceased to flow,  
  Yet still with memory's ear  
  Its gentle splash I hear.

<span class="small">This poet was the father of the writer of verse No.
[64](hvj065.htm#page_64), and was a member of the Fujiwara family at the
zenith of their power; he was a great statesman and scholar, and died in
the year 1041. The verse was written in praise of a waterfall that had
been made by the orders of the Emperor Saga early in the ninth century,
but which had by this time ceased to exist; and the illustration well
shows the watercourse now run dry.</span>
