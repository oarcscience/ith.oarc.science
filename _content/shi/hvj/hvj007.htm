<p>WHEN on the Magpies' Bridge I see<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Hoar-frost King has cast<br> His sparkling mantle, well I know<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The night is nearly past,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Daylight approaches fast.</div></p>  
<p><small>The author of this verse was Governor of the Province of K&#333;sh&#363;, and Viceroy of the more or less uncivilized northern and eastern parts of Japan; he died A.D. 785. There was a bridge or passageway in the Imperial Palace at Ky&#333;to called the Magpies' Bridge, but there is also an allusion here to the old legend about the Weaver and Herdsman. It is said, that the Weaver (the star Vega) was a maiden, who dwelt on one side of the River of the Milky Way, and who was employed in making clothes for the Gods. But one day the Sun took pity upon her, and gave her in marriage to the Herdboy (the star Aquila), who lived on the other side of the river. But as the result of this was that the supply of clothes fell short, she was only permitted to visit her husband once a year, viz. on the seventh night of the seventh month; and on this night, it is said, the magpies in a dense flock form a bridge for her across the river. The hoar frost forms just before day breaks. The illustration shows the Herdboy crossing on the Bridge of Magpies to his bride.</small></p>
