### 60

### LADY-IN-WAITING KO-SHIKIBU

### KO-SHIKIBU NO NAISHI

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Ohoye yama  
Ikuno no michi no  
  Tohokereba  
Mada fumi mo mizu  
Ama-no-Hashidate.

SO long and dreary is the road,  
  That I have never been  
To Ama-no-Hashidate;  
  Pray, how could I have seen  
  The verses that you mean?

</div>

Koshikibu was the daughter of the writer of verse No.
[56](hvj057.htm#page_56), and early became known as a poetess. The story
goes, that she was suspected of getting help from her mother in
composing poetry; and on one occasion, during the absence of the latter
at Ama-no-Hashidate, she was selected to take part in a poetical contest
at Court. A day or two before the event a nobleman laughingly asked her,
if she was not expecting a letter from her mother, hinting that she
would otherwise be unable to produce a poem good enough for the contest,
and she, touching his sleeve, improvised the above verse. The original
brings in not only Ama-no-Hashidate, a picturesque bay in the Province
of Tango, but also two other proper names, Mount Ohoye and Ikuno, which
are on the road there from Kyōto; but this the translation fails to do.

The last couplet can mean 'I have not walked to or seen Ama-no-Hashidate
', and also, 'I have not seen any letter from Ama-no-Hashidate.'
