<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hito wa iza<br> Kokoro mo shirazu<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Furu sato wa<br> Hana zo mukashi no<br> Ka ni nioi keru.</p>  
<p>THE village of my youth is gone,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;New faces meet my gaze;<br> But still the blossoms at thy gate,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whose perfume scents the ways,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Recall my childhood's days.</div></p>  
<p><small>The writer of this verse, who lived A.D. 884-946, was a nobleman at Court, one of the greatest of the classical poets, and the first writer of Japanese prose. He was the chief compiler of the <i>Kokinshiu</i>, in which work he was assisted by the authors of verses Nos. <A HREF="hvj030.htm#page_29">29</A>, <A HREF="hvj031.htm#page_30">30</A> and <A HREF="hvj034.htm#page_33">33</A>. This work consists of twenty volumes, containing some eleven hundred verses, and was completed in the year 922. It is related that Tsura-yuki once visited a friend after a long absence; and on being asked jestingly by the latter, how he could remember the way after such a long interval of time, the poet broke off a spray of blossoms from a plum tree growing at the entrance, and presented it to his friend with this impromptu verse.</small></p>
