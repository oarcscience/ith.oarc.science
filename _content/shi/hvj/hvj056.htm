<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Taki no oto wa<br> Taete hisashiku<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Narinuredo<br> Na koso nagarete<br> Nao kikoe kere.</p>  
<p>THIS waterfall's melodious voice<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Was famed both far and near;<br> Although it long has ceased to flow,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still with memory's ear<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Its gentle splash I hear.</div></p>  
<p><small>This poet was the father of the writer of verse No. <A HREF="hvj065.htm#page_64">64</A>, and was a member of the Fujiwara family at the zenith of their power; he was a great statesman and scholar, and died in the year 1041. The verse was written in praise of a waterfall that had been made by the orders of the Emperor Saga early in the ninth century, but which had by this time ceased to exist; and the illustration well shows the watercourse now run dry.</small></p>
