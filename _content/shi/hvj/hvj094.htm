<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Yo no naka wa<br> Tsune ni moga mo na<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nagisa kogu<br> Ama no obune no<br> Tsunade kanashi mo.</p>  
<p>I LOVE to watch the fishing-boats<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the bay,<br> The crew, all straining at the oars,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And coiling ropes away;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For busy folk are they.</div></p>  
<p><small>The name of the writer of this verse was Sanetomo Minamato, the second son of the great General Yoritomo. He was a famous man of letters, and was murdered in the year 1219 by his nephew, the Priest Kugy&#333;, at the Temple of Hachiman at Kamakura, whither he had gone to return thanks for his promotion to a high office of state. He seems to have had a premonition of his coming fate; for that morning, while being dressed, he composed the farewell poem to his plum tree given in the Introduction, and pulling out a hair he gave it to his servant, bidding him keep it in memory of him. The assassin sprang out from behind a tree, which is still pointed out to-day, growing at the side of the temple steps, cut him down, and ran off with the head. Kugy&#333; was caught and executed, but the head was never found, and so the single hair was buried in its stead.</small></p>
