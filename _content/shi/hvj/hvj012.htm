<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wada no hara<br> Yasoshima kakete<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Kogi idenu to<br> Hito ni wa tsugeyo<br> Ama no tsuribune.</p>  
<p>OH! Fishers in your little boats,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Quick! tell my men, I pray,<br> They'll find me at Yasoshima,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm being rowed away<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Far off across the bay.</div></p>  
<p><small>Takamura, a well-known scholar, rose from poverty to riches on being appointed a Custom-house officer for the ships trading to and from China. His enemies reported him to the Emperor as an extortioner and a thief, and he was deported to Yasoshima, a group of small islands off the coast; he is said to have composed this song and sung it to the fishing-boats, as he was being carried off. He was afterwards pardoned and reinstated, dying in the year 852.</small></p>
