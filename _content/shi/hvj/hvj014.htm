<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tsukuba ne no<br> Mine yori otsuru<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mina no kawa<br> Koi zo tsumorite<br> Fuchi to nari nuru.</p>  
<p>THE Mina stream comes tumbling down<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;From Mount Tsukuba's height;<br> Strong as my love, it leaps into<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A pool as black as night<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With overwhelming might.</div></p>  
<p><small>It was a frequent custom in the old days for the Emperors of Japan to retire into the church or private life, when circumstances demanded it. The Emperor Y&#333;zei, who was only nine years of age when he came to the throne, went out of his mind, and was forced by Mototsune Fujiwara to retire; he reigned A.D. 877-884, and did not die till the year 949. The verse was addressed to the Princess Tsuridono-no-Miko. Mount Tsukuba (2,925 feet high) and the River Mina are in the Province of Hitachi.</p>  
<p><i>Koi</i> here means the dark colour of the water from its depth, but it also means his love, and is to be understood both ways. Note also <i>mine</i>, a mountain peak, and <i>Mina</i>, the name of the river.</small></p>
