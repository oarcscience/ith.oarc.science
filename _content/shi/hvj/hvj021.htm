<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wabi nureba<br> Ima hata onaji<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Naniwa naru<br> Mi wo tsukushite mo<br> Awamu to zo omou.</p>  
<p>WE met but for a moment, and<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm wretched as before;<br> The <i>tide</i> shall <i>measure</i> out my life,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Unless I see once more<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The maid, whom I adore.</div></p>  
<p><small>The composer of this verse was the son of the Emperor Y&#333;zei, who reigned A.D. 877-884; he was noted for his love-affairs, and he died in the year 943.</p>  
<p><i>Mi wo tsukushite mo</i> means 'even though I die in the attempt', but <i>miotsukushi</i> is a graduated stick, set up to measure the rise and fall of the tide; and Naniwa, the modern seaport of Osaka, seems to have been inserted chiefly as the place where this tide-gauge was set up. The poet may have meant, that the river of his tears was so deep as to require a gauge to measure it; or, as Professor MacCauley reads it, he was hinting, that if he could not attain his ends his body would be found at the tide-gauge in Naniwa Bay. The picture seems to show the poet on the verandah and his lady-love looking through the screen.</small></p>
