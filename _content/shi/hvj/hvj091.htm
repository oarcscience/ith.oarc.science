<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Misebayana<br> Ojima no ama no<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sode dani no<br> Nure ni zo nureshi<br> Iro wa kawaraji.</p>  
<p>THE fisher's clothes, though cheap, withstand<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The drenching they receive;<br> But see I my floods of tears have blurred<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The colours of my sleeve,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As for thy love I grieve.</div></p>  
<p><small>The writer is said to have been one of the Fujiwara family, and to have died in the year 1210. Ojima is an island in the Inland Sea.</p>  
<p>In the last line the word <i>iro</i> can mean both 'colour' and 'love'; so that the meaning is, the writer's love will remain as constant as the colour of the fisher's clothes, even though drenched with salt water. In connexion with this word <i>iro</i>, it may be mentioned that a crimson maple leaf, When sent by a lady to her lover, is a gentle hint that she wishes to see him no more; the meaning being, that as the colour (<i>iro</i>) of the leaf has changed, so her love (<i>iro</i>) has changed also.</small></p>
