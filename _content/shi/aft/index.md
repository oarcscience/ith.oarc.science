# AINO FOLK-TALES.

### by Basil Hall Chamberlain

###### \[London, 1888\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Ainu** are an ethnic minority in Japan, living primarily on the
northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaidō, although there were also small
populations of Ainu living on the island of Sakhalin and in the Kuriles
until the end of World War II, when the Soviet Union took control of
Sakhalin and the Ainu there fled. Until the Meiji Restoration of 1868,
when Japan took formal possession of Hokkaidō and began the systematic
integration of the Ainu into the Japanese nation, the Ainu lived almost
exclusively as hunter-gatherers north of the always advancing frontier
of Japanese agriculture. 'Traditional' anthropological wisdom holds that
the Ainu are descended from the aboriginal inhabitants of Japan who were
gradually dispossessed of their land by the invading Japanese and their
superior civilization. This view is held up by the fact that the Ainu
generally do not look Japanese, by the apparently radical differences
between the two languages, and by the large number of Ainu place-names
in Japan proper. More recent anthropology, however, sees a far greater
continuity between the two cultures, with many deep and ancient
similarities.

**Ainu literature** was traditionally of an exclusively oral variety,
and very little was reduced to writing in any language before the 19th
century. Many of the stories occur in more or less lengthy poems known
as *yukar*, which are an epic-like form. Many of the stories presented
in this book also occur in the context of much longer and deeper
stories, which is not made apparent; more than likely because the
importance or even existence of the *yukar* was unknown to the author.

**Basil Hall Chamberlain** was well-known as one of the pioneering
translators and interpreters of things Japanese in his time. (He also
translated the Shinto classic [*Kojiki*](../kojiki).) Like many
philologists, his interest in the Ainu was purely academic, centering
mainly on the light that knowledge of the Ainu could shed on Japanese
place-names and prehistory. Like many of the Japanese among whom he
lived and worked, his opinion of the Ainu was quite mean, and his
comments in the Prefatory Remarks sound downright inflammatory today, a
fine specimen of Victorian racism.
