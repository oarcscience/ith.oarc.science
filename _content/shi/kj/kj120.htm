So the elder brother refused it, and caused [258] it to be offered to the younger brother, and the younger brother refused it, and caused it to be offered to the elder brother, during which mutual cedings many days elapsed. As such mutual ceding took place not [only] once or twice, the fisherman wept from the fatigue of going backwards and forwards. So the proverb says:</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1940"></A><A HREF="kj120.htm#fr_1945">321:5a</A> Motowori is probably right in saying that the point of this proverb lies in the consideration that, whereas people in general weep for that which they have not, this fisherman wept on account of the trouble which was caused to him by the fish which he had.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1941"></A><A HREF="kj120.htm#fr_1946">321:6</A> Or, "died first," The use in this place of the character <A NAME="img_32100"></A>
