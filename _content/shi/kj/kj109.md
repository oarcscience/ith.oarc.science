## \[SECT. CII.—EMPEROR CHIŪ-AI (PART VIII.—THE EMPRESS JIN-GŌ PRESENTS LIQUOR TO THE HEIR APPARENT).\]

Hereupon, when the \[Heir Apparent\] returned up \[to the Capital\], his
august parent, Her Augustness Princess Okinaga-tarashi. distilled some
waiting-liquor, <span id="fr_1811"></span>[1](#fn_1806) and presented it
to him. Then his august parent sang augustly, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"This august liquor is not my august liquor;—oh! it is august liquor
respectfully brought as a divine congratulation, a repeated
congratulation, a bountiful congratulation, a reiterated congratulation
by the Small August Deity, who dwells eternally, \[239\] firmly
standing. Partake not shallowly! Go on! go on!" <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[2](#fn_1807)

</div>

Having thus sung, she presented to him the great august liquor. Then His
Augustness the Noble Takeuchi replied for the august child and sang,
saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Whatever person distilled this august liquor must surely have distilled
it singing the while with that drum on the mortar,—must surely have
distilled it dancing the while, for this august liquor, august liquor,
to be ever more and more joyful. Go on! go on!" <span

These are Drinking Songs. <span id="fr_1814"></span>[4](#fn_1809)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1806"></span>[297:1](kj109.htm#fr_1811) <span
id="page_297">p. 297</span> *Machi-sake*. This expression, which recurs
in the poems of the "Collection of a Myriad Leaves," signifies liquor
distilled for an absent friend by those who are awaiting his return.

<span id="fn_1807"></span>[297:2](kj109.htm#fr_1812) The General
signification of the Song is: "Think not that this liquor was made by
me. ’Tis a present from the small August Deity (*Suku-na-biko-no*), who
dwells forever in unshaken power and who sends <span id="page_298">p.
298</span> it to thee with endless congratulation. Come on! come on!
drink deeply!"—Some of the expressions in this Song are a subject of
debate among the commentators. Excepting the clause "partake not
shallowly," in which the translator has adopted the opinion of the
author of the "Explanation of the Songs in the Chronicles of Japan,"
Moribe's interpretation has been followed throughout. The latter critic
would identify *asazu* ("not slowly") with *amasazu* ("without leaving
anything"). But there seems no warrant for supposing such an elision of
the syllable *sa*. The use of the expression *karuhoshi* and *motohoshi*
to express reiteration is worthy of notice. It will be remembered that
the Deity mentioned was the microscopic personage who came riding over
the waves to share the sovereignty of Idzumo with the Deity
Master-of-the-Great-Land (see Sect. XXVII).

<span id="fn_1808"></span>[297:3](kj109.htm#fr_1813) This Song
signifies; "Such a joyful feast must surely have been preceded by a
joyful distilling of the liquor for it. Continue to drink, oh
Prince!"—The commentators disagree on the subject of one or two of the
words of this Song, in which the translator has followed Motowori's
interpretation throughout. The words "that drum" are the chief
difficulty. Motowori supposes that drums, being originally unknown in
Japan, were first seen by the Japanese on the occasion of the conquest
of Korea in this very reign, and he thinks that the drum would be placed
by the side of the mortar during the pounding of the rice out of which
the liquor was to be made. "That drum" means the drum belonging to the
pounder of the rice. The original words *so no*, "that," might also be
rendered by "his."

<span id="fn_1809"></span>[297:4](kj109.htm#fr_1814) Literally,
"liquor-rejoicing songs."
