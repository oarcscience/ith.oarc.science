<p>Hereupon, when Her Augustness Princess Okinaga-tarashi was returning up to Yamato, she, owing to doubts concerning the disposition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1781"></A><A HREF="#fn_1776"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the people, prepared a mourning-vessel,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1782"></A><A HREF="#fn_1777"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> set the august child in that mourning-vessel, and let a report ooze out that the august child was already dead. While she went up thus, King Kagosaka and King Oshikuma,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1783"></A><A HREF="#fn_1778"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> having heard [of the circumstance], thought to waylay&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1784"></A><A HREF="#fn_1779"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> her, went forth to the moor of Toga,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1785"></A><A HREF="#fn_1780"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and hunted for an omen. Then King Kagosaka climbed up an oak-tree,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1786"></A><A HREF="#fn_1781"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and then&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1787"></A><A HREF="#fn_1782"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> a large and angry boar came forth, dug up the oak-tree, and forthwith devoured King Kagosaka. His younger brother, King Oshikuma, undaunted by this circumstance, raised an army and lay in wait [for the Empress], to close with the mourning-vessel as being an empty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1788"></A><A HREF="#fn_1783"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> vessel. Then an army was landed from the mourning-vessel,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1789"></A><A HREF="#fn_1784"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> and joined in combat [with the opposing forces]. At this time King Oshikuma made the Noble Isahi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1790"></A><A HREF="#fn_1785"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> ancestor of [236] the Kishi Clan of Naniha,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1791"></A><A HREF="#fn_1786"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> his generalissimo;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1792"></A><A HREF="#fn_1787"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> and on</p>

<p>the august side of the Heir Apparent His Augustness Naniha-ne-ko-take-furu-kuma,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1793"></A><A HREF="#fn_1788"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> ancestor of the Grandees of Wani,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1794"></A><A HREF="#fn_1789"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> was made generalissimo. So when [the Empress's troops] had driven [King Oshikuma's troops] as far as Yamashiro, [the latter] turned and made a stand, and both [sides] fought together without retreating. Then His Augustness Take-furu-kuma planned, and caused it to be said that, as Her Augustness Okinaga-tarashi was already dead, there was no need for further fighting,&#8212;forthwith snapping his bowstrings and feigning submission. Therefore King Oshikuma's generalissimo, believing the falsehood, unbent his bows and put away his arms. Then [the Empress's troops] picked out of their topknots some prepared bowstrings (<small>one name [of the bowstrings] was <i>usa-yu-dzuru</i>;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1795"></A><A HREF="#fn_1790"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></small>) stretched [their bows] again, and pursued and smote [the enemy]. So [these] fled away to Afusaka,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1796"></A><A HREF="#fn_1791"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> rallied, and fought again. Then [the Empress's troops] pursued on, and defeated them, and cut to pieces that army at Sasanami.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1797"></A><A HREF="#fn_1792"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> Thereupon King Oshikuma, together with the Noble Isahi, being pursued and pressed, got on board a vessel and floated on the sea, and sang, saying:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Come on, my lord! rather than be stricken [237] by Furu-kuma's hurtful hand, I will plunge like the grebe into the Sea of Afumi,&#8212;I will!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1798"></A><A HREF="#fn_1793"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></div></p>  
<p>Forthwith they plunged into the sea, and died together.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1790"></A><A HREF="kj107.htm#fr_1795">293:15</A> The text is here somewhat obscure, and the note in small print is of doubtful authenticity. If we retain it, we must understand it to mean that <i>usa-yu-dzuru</i>, a term whose derivation is by no means clear, was an alternative name of the <i>make dzuru</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "prepared bowstrings," such as they had brought <A HREF="errata.htm#67">with</A> them concealed in their top-knots.</P>
