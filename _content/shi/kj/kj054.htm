<p>So then there were in Uda two persons, Ukashi the Elder Brother and Ukashi the Younger Brother.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_951"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> So</p>

Will ye respectfully serve him?" Hereupon Ukashi the Elder Brother waited for and shot at the messenger with a whizzing barb to make him turn back. So the place where the whizzing barb fell is called Kabura-zaki.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_952"></A><A HREF="#fn_948"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Saying that he intended to wait for and smite [His Augustness Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko], he [tried to] collect an army. But being unable to collect an army he said deceitfully that he would respectfully serve [His Augustness Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko], and built a great palace,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_953"></A><A HREF="#fn_949"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and in that palace set a pitfall, and waited. Then Ukashi the Younger Brother came out to&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_954"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> [His Augustness Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko] beforehand, and made obeisance, saying: "Mine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_955"></A><A HREF="#fn_951"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> elder brother Ukashi the Elder Brother has shot at and turned back the messenger [139] of the august child of the Heavenly Deity, and, intending to wait for and attack thee, has [tried to] collect an army; but, being unable to collect it, he has built a great palace, and set&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_956"></A><A HREF="#fn_952"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> a gin within it, intending to wait for and catch thee. So I have come out to inform [thee of this]." Then the two persons His Augustness Michi-no-Omi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_957"></A><A HREF="#fn_953"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> ancestor of the Ohotomo Chieftains,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_958"></A><A HREF="#fn_954"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> and His Augustness Ohokume,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_959"></A><A HREF="#fn_955"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> ancestor of the Kume Lords,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_960"></A><A HREF="#fn_956"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> summoned Ukashi the Elder Brother and reviled him, saying: "Into the great palace which thou&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_961"></A><A HREF="#fn_957"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> hast built to respectfully serve [His Augustness Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko], be thou&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_962"></A><A HREF="#fn_958"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> the first to enter, and declare plainly the manner in which thou intendest respectfully to serve him; "&#8212;and forthwith grasping the hilts of their cross-swords, playing with their spears,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_963"></A><A HREF="#fn_959"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> and fixing arrows [in</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_955"></A><A HREF="kj054.htm#fr_959">170:9</A> <i>I.e.</i>, perhaps "Great Round Eyes," supposed to be a descendant of His Augustness <i>Ama-tsu-kume</i> (see however Sect. XXXIV, Note 7 for a discussion of the etymology of <i>Kume</i>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_956"></A><A HREF="kj054.htm#fr_960">170:10</A> See Sect. XXXIV, Note 13.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_957"></A><A HREF="kj054.htm#fr_961">170:11</A> The expression <i>i ga</i>, here rendered "thou," is, as Motowori remarks, "extremely hard to understand," and its interpretation as an insulting form of the Second Personal Pronoun is merely tentative. Perhaps the text is corrupt.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_958"></A><A HREF="kj054.htm#fr_962">170:12</A> The insulting Second Pronoun <i>ore</i> is here employed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_959"></A><A HREF="kj054.htm#fr_963">170:13</A> Here again we have an expression written phonetically and of uncertain import. The translator has followed Motowori in tentatively rendering it according to the ideographic reading of the parallel passage of the "Chronicles."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_960"></A><A HREF="kj054.htm#fr_964">171:14</A> Literally "struck by."</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_962"></A><A HREF="kj054.htm#fr_966">171:16</A> This Song is unusually difficult of comprehension: and the latest important commentator, Moribe, seems to show satisfactorily that all his predecessors, Motowori included, more or less misunderstood it. He had at least the advantage of coming after them, and the translator has followed his interpretation excepting with regard to <i>isukukashi</i>, the Pillow-Word for "whale," which is here rendered "valiant," in accordance with the traditional view of its signification. The <i>soba</i> tree is identified by Motowori with the <i>Kaname-mochi</i>, "<i>Photinia glabra</i>," <A HREF="errata.htm#31">This</A> <i>saka-ki</i>, taken together with its Prefix <i>ichi</i> (here rendered "vigorous") is supposed in this place to signify, not the usual <i>Cleyera japonica</i>, but another species popularly known as the <i>bishiya-gaki</i>, whose English or Latin name the translator has failed to ascertain. It has a large berry, whereas the soba has a small one. . . The following is the gist of Moribe's exposition of the general signification of the Song: "If for Ukashi's mean design to kill the Emperor in a gin there be sought a term of comparison in the whales and woodcock forming the Imperial banquet, then in lieu of the woodcock that he expected to catch in the trap that he set, that great whale, the Imperial host, has rushed up against it. Again if, as the fishermen's wives might do, your (<i>i.e.</i>, you soldiers') wives ask you <a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="green">p. 173</font></A> for fish, then let each of you give to his elder wife, of whom he must have grown weary, only a small and bony portion, and to his younger wife, who is doubtless his heart's favourite, a good fleshy piece. So jocular a guess at the "<i>penchants</i> of the young warriors excites their ardour, which they give vent to in the following shouts."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_963"></A><A HREF="kj054.htm#fr_967">171:17</A> Some of the Japanese originals of this string of Interjections are of uncertain import. The translator has been guided by Motowori's conjectures, with which Moribe mostly agrees. The exclamations are supposed not to form part of the actual Song, but to proceed from the mouths of the Imperial soldiers. The words rendered "this is saying thou rascal" (such is apparently their meaning) and those rendered "this is laughing [him] to scorn "seem to be glosses as old as the text, which had already been obscure in the eighth century. They are not written altogether phonetically.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_964"></A><A HREF="kj054.htm#fr_968">171:18</A> <i>Uda na Mohitori</i>. This tribe or guild of "water-directors" was entrusted with the charge of the water, the ice, and the gruel used in the Imperial household. In later times the word <i>Mohitori</i> was corrupted to <i>Mondo</i>.</P>
