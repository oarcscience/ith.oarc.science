<p>Thereupon his younger brother His Augustness Midzu-ha-wake came, <A HREF="errata.htm#87">and</A> sent [to ask for] an audience.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2158"></A><A HREF="#fn_2153"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Then the Heavenly Sovereign caused him to be told [these words]: As I am in doubt whether perhaps Thine Augustness may [not] be of like mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2159"></A><A HREF="#fn_2154"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with King Sumi-no-ye-no-naka-tsu, I will not meet and speak with thee." [His Augustness Midzu-ha-wake] replied, saying: "I have no evil intent. I am not of like mind with King Sumi-no-ye-no-naka-tsu." [The Heavenly Sovereign] again caused him to be told [these words]: "If that be so, [do thou] now return down, and slay King Sumi-no-ye-no-naka-tsu, and come up [again hither]. At that time I will surely meet and speak with thee." So he forthwith returned down to Naniha, and deceived [a man] named Sobakari,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2160"></A><A HREF="#fn_2155"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> a man-at-arms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2161"></A><A HREF="#fn_2156"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in the personal service of&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2162"></A><A HREF="#fn_2157"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> King Sumi-no-ye-no-naka-tsu, saying: "If thou wilt obey my words, I shall become Heavenly Sovereign, and will make thee prime Minister, to rule the Empire.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2163"></A><A HREF="#fn_2158"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> How [would this be]?" Sobakari replied, saying "" [I [290] will do] according to thy command." Then plenteously endowing that man-at-arms, he said: "If that be so,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="green">p. 361</font></A></p>  
<p>slay the King." Thereupon Sobakari watched for the time when his King went into the privy, and thrust him to death with a spear. So when [His Augustness Midzu-ha-wake] was making his progress to Yamato taking Sobakari with him, he, on reaching the entrance of the Ohosaka mountain, thought [thus]: "Although Sobakari deserves very well of me, he has truly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2164"></A><A HREF="#fn_2159"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> slain his lord. This is unrighteous. Nevertheless if I reward not his deed, I may be called untruthful; and if I quite carry out my promise, his intentions are on the contrary to be feared. So, though recompensing his deed, I will destroy his actual person." Therefore he said to Sobakari: "I will halt here to-day and bestow on thee the rank of Prime Minister, and to-morrow will [continue my] progress up." So a halt was made at the entrance to the mountain, a temporary palace forthwith built, a copious feast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2165"></A><A HREF="#fn_2160"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> suddenly held, the rank of Prime Minister forthwith bestowed on the man-at-arms, and all the officials&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2166"></A><A HREF="#fn_2161"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> made to do obeisance [to him]. The man-at-arms, delighted, thought that he had accomplished his design. Then [His Augustness Midzu-ha-wake] said to the man-at-arms: "To-day I will drink liquor from the same cup as the Prime Minister." And when they drank together, a bowls large [enough] to hide the face was filled with the liquor presented.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2167"></A><A HREF="#fn_2162"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> Hereupon the King's child drank first, and the man-at-arms drank afterwards. So when the man-at-arms was drinking, the great cup covered his face. Then [His Augustness Midzu-ha-wake] drew forth a sabre which he had laid under the matting, and cut off the head of the man-at-arms. Forthwith on the morrow he made his progress up. So the place was called by the name of Chika-tsu-Asuka.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2168"></A><A HREF="#fn_2163"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>
