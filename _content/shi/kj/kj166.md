## \[SECT CLIX.—EMPEROR [YŪ-RIYAKU](errata.htm#104) (PART X.—THE MOUND OF THE METAL SPADE).\]

Again when the Heavenly Sovereign made a progress to Kasuga to wed
Princess Wodo, <span id="fr_2345"></span>[1a](#fn_2340) daughter of the
Grandee Satsuki of Wani, <span id="fr_2346"></span>[2a](#fn_2341) a
maiden met him by the way, and forthwith seeing the Imperial progress,
ran and hid on the side of a mound. So he composed an august Song. That
august Song said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Oh! the mound where the maiden is hiding! Oh for five hundred metal
spades! then might \[we\] dig her out!" <span
id="fr_2347"></span>[3](#fn_2342)

</div>

So that mound was called by the name of the Mound \[321\] of the Metal
Spade. <span id="fr_2348"></span>[4](#fn_2343)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2340"></span>[401:1a](kj166.htm#fr_2345) *Wodo-hime*. The
signification of this name is obscure.

<span id="fn_2341"></span>[401:2a](kj166.htm#fr_2346) *Wani no Satsuki
no omi*. For *Wani* see Sect. LXII, Note 11. *Satsuki* is the old
Japanese name of the fifth moon.

<span id="fn_2342"></span>[401:3](kj166.htm#fr_2347) Moribe thus
paraphrases this Song: "The Monarch had met a girl carrying a spade in
her hand, and as she was beautiful, wished to address her; but she ran
off and hid on the hill-side, leaving her spade behind her. His words
express a desire for five hundred spades like hers, with which to break
down the hill-side and dig her out. . . . It is in joke that he talks of
the maiden who was on the *other side* of the hill as being *inside*
it." That in ancient times all digging implements were not made of metal
will be seen by reference to Sect. CXXIV, Note 9.

<span id="fn_2343"></span>[401:4](kj166.htm#fr_2348) *Kanasuki no woko*.
