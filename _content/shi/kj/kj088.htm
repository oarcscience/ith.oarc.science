<p>Forthwith entering the Land of Idzumo, and wishing to slay the Idzumo bravo, he on arriving, forthwith bound [himself to him in] friendship. So, having secretly [209] made [the wood of] an oak [-trees&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1590"></A><A HREF="#fn_1586"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>] into a false sword and augustly girded it, he went with the bravo to bathe the River Hi.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1591"></A><A HREF="#fn_1587"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Then, His Augustness Yamato-take</p>

<p>getting out of the river first, and taking and girding on the sword that the Idzumo bravo had taken off and laid down, said: "Let us exchange swords!" So afterwards the Idzumo bravo, getting out of the river, girded on His Augustness Yamato-take's false sword. Hereupon His Augustness Yamato-take, suggested, saying: "Come on! let us cross&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1592"></A><A HREF="#fn_1588"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> swords." Then on drawing his sword, the Idzumo bravo could not draw the false sword. Forthwith His Augustness Yamato-take drew his sword and slew the Idzumo bravo. Then he sang augustly, saying:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Alas that the sword girded on the Idzumo bravo, and wound round with many a creeper, should have had no true blade!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1593"></A><A HREF="#fn_1589"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></div></p>  
<p>So having thus extirpated the [bravoes] and made [the land] orderly, he went up [to the capital], and made his report [to the Heavenly Sovereign].</p>

In the "Chronicle" the time and the heroes of the episode, and the singers of the Song are all different, and in that context the lament sounds like a genuine one. The reader will remember what was said in the Introduction as to the use of creepers for string. That mentioned in the text is supposed to be the <i>Cocculus thunbergi</i>.</P>
