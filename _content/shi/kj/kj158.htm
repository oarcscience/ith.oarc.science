<p>So the Shiraka Clan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2297"></A><A HREF="#fn_2292"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> was established as the august proxy of Prince Shiraka.

<P><A NAME="fn_2294"></A><A HREF="kj158.htm#fr_2299">388:3</A> <i>Kahase no toneri</i>. <i>Kaha-se</i> signifies "river-reach," and the "Chronicles," under date of the eleventh year of this reign, tell a story of the appearance of a white cormorant, to commemorate which this family was established. Cormorants, it will be remembered, were used for catching fish in rivers; hence the appropriateness of the name bestowed on the family in question.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2295"></A><A HREF="kj158.htm#fr_2300">388:4</A> The name given by the early Japanese to Wu (<A NAME="img_38800"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/38800.jpg">), an ancient state in Eastern China to the South of the Yang-tzo River. In Japanese it however, like other names of portions of China, often denotes the whole of that country in a somewhat vague manner. The derivation the word <i>Kura</i> is obscure. The most acceptable proposition is that which would see in it corruption of the original Chinese term <i>Wu</i>, of which <i>Go</i> is the Sinico-Japanese pronunciation. But what of the second syllable <i>re</i>?</P>
