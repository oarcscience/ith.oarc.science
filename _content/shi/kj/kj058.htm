The reason why she is called the august child of a Deity is that the Princess Seya-datara,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_997"></A><A HREF="#fn_993"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> daughter of Mizokuhi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_998"></A><A HREF="#fn_994"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> of Mishima,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_999"></A><A HREF="#fn_995"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> was admired on account of her beauty by the Great-Master-of-Things the Deity of Miwa,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1000"></A><A HREF="#fn_996"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> qui, quum pulchra puella oletum fecit, in sagittam rubro [colore] fucatam se convertit, et ab inferiori parte cloacae [ad usum] faciendi oleti virginis privatas partes transfixit. Tunc pulchra virgo consternata est, et surrexit, et trepide fugit. Statim sagittam attulit, et juxta thalamum posuit. Subito [sagitta] formosus adolescens facta [147] est, qui cito pulchram puellam sibi in matrimonio junxit, et filiam procreavit nomine Hoto-tarara-i-susugi-hime;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1001"></A><A HREF="#fn_997"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> et est nomen alternativum Hime-tatara-i-suke-yori-hime.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1002"></A><A HREF="#fn_998"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> (<small>Id est posterior mutatio nominis, quoniam abhorruit facere mentionem privatarum partium</small>). So therefore she is called the august child of a Deity. Hereupon seven beauteous maidens were out playing on the moor of Takasazhi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1003"></A><A HREF="#fn_999"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> and I-suke-yori-hime&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1004"></A><A HREF="#fn_1000"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> was among them.

<p><a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="green">p. 180</font></A></p>  
<p>seeing I-suke-yori-hime, spoke to the Heavenly Sovereign in a Song, saying:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Seven maidens on the moor of Takasazhi in Yamato:&#8212;which shall be interlaced?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1005"></A><A HREF="#fn_1001"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></div></p>  
<p>Then I-suke-yori-hime was standing first among the beauteous maidens. Forthwith the Heavenly Sovereign, having looked at the beauteous maidens, and knowing in his august heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1006"></A><A HREF="#fn_1002"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> that I-suke-yori-hime was standing in the very front, replied by a Song, saying:</p>

<p>Then His Augustness Ohokume informed I-suke-yori-hime [148] of the Heavenly Sovereign's decree, whereupon she, seeing the slit sharp eyes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1008"></A><A HREF="#fn_1004"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> of His Augustness Ohokume, sang in her astonishment, saying:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"></p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="108">

<p></div></p>  
<p>Then His Augustness Ohokume replied by a Song, saying:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"My slit sharp eyes [are] in order to find the maiden immediately."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1010"></A><A HREF="#fn_1006"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></div></p>  
<p>So the maiden said that she would respectfully serve [the Heavenly Sovereign].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1011"></A><A HREF="#fn_1007"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> Hereupon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1012"></A><A HREF="#fn_1008"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A> the house of Her Augustness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1013"></A><A HREF="#fn_1009"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A> I-suke-yori-hime was on [the back of] the River Sawi.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1014"></A><A HREF="#fn_1010"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A> The Heavenly Sovereign made a progress to the abode of I-suke-yori-hime, and augustly slept [149] [there] one night.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1015"></A><A HREF="#fn_1011"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> (<small>The reason why that river was called the River Sawi was that on the River's banks the mountain-lily-plant grew in abundance.

<P><A NAME="fn_990"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_994">179:6</A> <i>I.e.</i>, perhaps "rudder-ears."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_991"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_995">179:7</A> Motowori adduces good reasons for believing this name to be but a slightly altered form of the preceding one, and for holding that in the original form of the tradition there was but one child mentioned.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_992"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_996">179:8</A> See Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XX, pp. 10-15, for the reasons for thus interpreting the characters <A NAME="img_18100"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/18100.jpg"> in the text. Elsewhere it has generally, for the sake of convenience, been simply rendered "Empress."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_993"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_997">179:9</A> <i>Seya-dotara-hime</i>. The signification of the name is obscure. Motowori supposes <i>Seya</i> to be a place and tatara (<i>nigori&#8217;ed</i> to <i>datara</i>) perhaps a plant written with the Chinese character <A NAME="img_18101"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/18101.jpg">, said by Dr. Williams in his "Syllabic Dictionary" to be possibly a species of <i>Heteroiropa</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_994"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_998">179:10</A> It is uncertain whether this name should, or should not, be <a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="green">p. 182</font></A> regarded as properly that of a place. The meaning is equally obscure. The Chinese characters with which it is here written signify "ditch-eater," whereas those employed in the "Chronicles" signify "ditch-stake." Perhaps both transcriptions are simply phonetic.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_995"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_999">179:11</A> A district in the province of Tsu (Settsu). The name signifies "three islands."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_996"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1000">179:12</A> <i>Miwa-no-oho-mono-mushi-no-kami</i>. This god is supposed to be identical with Oho-kuni-nushi (the "Master of the Great Land," see end of Sect. XX and following Sects). The rigidly literal rendering of the name as here given would be "the Deity Great Master of Things of Miwa "; but the more intelligible version here given represents the Japanese author's meaning. For the traditional etymology of Miwa see the story related in Sect LXV.</p>  
<p>
<P><A NAME="fn_997"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1001">179:13</A> <i>Hoto</i> significat partes privatas. Verbi <i>tatara</i> sensum supra s.v. <i>Seya-datara-hime</i> pertractavimus. <i>I</i> est vox expletiva. <i>Susugi</i> sensus est "trepide fugiens." <i>Hime</i> indicat regiam puellam.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_998"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1002">179:14</A> <i>I.e.</i>, Princess Tatara-Startled-Good-Princess.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_999"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1003">179:15</A> Etymology obscure.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1000"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1004">179:16</A> An abbreviated form of the princess's alternative name.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1001"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1005">180:17</A> The meaning of this Song is: "To which of the seven maidens now disporting themselves on the moor of Takasazhi shall I convey the Emperor's command to come that he may make her his consort, and sleep with his arms intertwined in hers?"&#8212;Motowori, overlooking the difference between mart, which is the word in the text, and the <i>nigori</i>&#8217;ed form <i>magu</i> met with in some other passages, misinterprets the last clause thus: "Which shall be sought?" He makes the same mistake in his explanation of the next Song.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1002"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1006">180:18</A> <i>I.e.</i>, "having a presentiment."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1003"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1007">180:19</A> The translation of this Song follows Moribe's exegesis. Motowori interprets it thus; "Well, well! I will seek the lovely one standing in the very front." As here rendered, the little poem is quite clear,&#8212;simply a declaration on the Emperor's part that he will make the girl standing in front his wife.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1004"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1008">180:20</A> <i>Sakeru-to-me</i>, the original of the phrase here rendered "slit sharp eyes," is obscure and variously understood by the commentators. Moribe supposes the god to have worn a casque with a vizor, and the slit to have been made in the latter, and not actually in, or rather near, the eyes. It should however be observed that, though the Japanese word <i>saku</i> means "to slit," the Chinese character in the text properly signifies <a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="green">p. 183</font></A> "to tattoo (or brand) with ink," and is used with that meaning at the end of Sect. CXLIX, and elsewhere in the ancient books. The present writer, after comparing various passages in which the term occurs, thinks that we may understand a <A HREF="errata.htm#38">tattooing</A> of the outer corners of the eyes, which would give to the latter the appearance of being long and sharp, or, if the tattooing were very dark, of being actually slit.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1005"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1009">180:21</A> The first lines of this short poem are so hopelessly unintelligible that the commentators are not even agreed as to how the syllables composing them should be divided into words. For the straits to which Motowori and his predecessors were driven in their efforts to obtain some plausible signification, see his Commentary, Vol. XX, pp. 27-29, and for Moribe's totally divergent interpretation see "<i>Idzu no Koto-waki</i>," Vol. II, pp. 30-31. It is not worth while to quote here more such conjectures.&#8212;For the doubt attaching to the precise signification of the words rendered by "slit sharp eyes," see the preceding Note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1006"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1010">180:22</A> The signification of his Song is as plain as that of the preceding one is obscure.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1007"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1011">180:23</A> <i>Q.d.</i>, as his wife.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1008"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1012">180:24</A> This initial expression is meaningless.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1009"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1013">180:25</A> Having become the Emperor's consort, this Honorific title is now prefixed for the first time to her name.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1010"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1014">180:26</A> <i>Sawi-gaha</i>. <i>Sawi</i>, as we learn from the compiler's note below, was the name of a kind of lily.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1011"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1015">180:27</A> Literally, "one sojourn."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1012"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1016">181:28</A> The signification of this Song is: "Now indeed thou comest to share the majesty of the palace. But the beginning of our intimacy was on that night when I came to thy humble dwelling on the reed-grown moor where, when we slept together, we had to pile mat upon mat to keep out the damp."&#8212;The translator has followed Moribe's interpretation throughout. Motowori takes in the sense of "ugly" the word here rendered "damp," and all the previous commentators give a different explanation of the words <i>iya saya shikite</i>, here translated by "spreading layer upon layer." They take them to mean "spreading more land more <A HREF="errata.htm#39">cleanly</A>."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1013"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1017">181:29</A> This name may signify "prince eight-wells." But the interpretation of <i>ya wi</i> as "eight wells" in his and the following name is doubtful.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1014"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1018">181:30</A> This name may signify "divine-eight-wells-ears." But see preceding Note.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1016"></A><A HREF="kj058.htm#fr_1020">181:32</A> The character in the text is not actually "Deity," but <A NAME="img_18400"></A>
