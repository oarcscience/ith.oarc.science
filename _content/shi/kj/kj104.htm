These "offerings" (<i>nusa</i>) are the same as those mentioned in Sect. XVI (Notes 24 and 25) under the names <i>nigi-te</i> and <i>mitegura</i>. They consisted of cloth, for which in later times paper has been substituted.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1739"></A><A HREF="kj104.htm#fr_1744">286:3</A> There are different views as to the exact bearing of this curious expression. <i>Conf</i>. Sect. XV, Note 10.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1740"></A><A HREF="kj104.htm#fr_1745">286:4</A> <i>I.e.</i>, incest between parents and children.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1742"></A><A HREF="kj104.htm#fr_1747">286:6</A> The Deities now speak to, as well as through, the Empress. Before the quotation marks announcing their words we must understand some such clause as and they added this divine charge." It would <a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="green">p. 288</font></A> also be possible to translate the whole passage thus: "Thereupon the manner of their instruction and counsel. was '[Things] being exactly as on the former day, altogether this land,'" etc., etc.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1743"></A><A HREF="kj104.htm#fr_1748">286:7</A> <i>I.e.</i>, in the Empress's womb. Motowori supposes that she is thus spoken of as a Deity on account of her being at that moment divinely possessed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1744"></A><A HREF="kj104.htm#fr_1749">286:8</A> Literally, "heart."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1745"></A><A HREF="kj104.htm#fr_1750">287:9</A> <i>Soko-dzu-tsu-no-wo</i>, <i>Naka-dzu-tsu-no wo</i>, and <i>Uha-dzu-tsu-no-wo</i> three of the deities born at the time of the purification of Izanagi (the "Male-Who-Invites") on his return from Hades, and known collectively as the Deities of the Inlet of Sumi. (See Sect. X, Notes 18 and 22). The grammar of this sentence is, as Motowori remarks, not lucid. One would expect the author to say that it was "the august doing" of all the four deities mentioned.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1746"></A><A HREF="kj104.htm#fr_1751">287:10</A> <i>I.e.</i>, says Motowori, they then first informed Take-uchi who they were. Up in that time, it had not been known by what Deities the Empress was possessed. Mabuchi, however, rejected this gloss as a later additions.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1747"></A><A HREF="kj104.htm#fr_1752">287:11</A> <i>I.e.</i>, the sacred offerings of white and blue cloth.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1749"></A><A HREF="kj104.htm#fr_1754">287:13</A> Here, as before, the Singular would be at least as natural an interpretation as the Plural. The three ocean-deities are supposed to be specially referred to, and in that case, the three being easily conceived as one (like the deified peaches mentioned in Sect. IX, Note 19) owing to the want of discrimination in Japanese between Singular and Plural, we might retain the Singular in English. Altogether the Sun-goddess seems out of place in this passage, and it would be satisfactory to have some authority for expunging from it the mention of her name.</P>
