## \[SECT CLII.—EMPEROR YŪ-RIYAKU (PART III.—THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE OF THE GREAT DEPARTMENTAL LORD OF SHIKI).\]

In the beginning, when the Empress <span
id="fr_2303"></span>[1](#fn_2298) dwelt at Kusaka, <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2](#fn_2299) \[the Heavenly Sovereign\] made a
progress in Kafuchi by way of the Tadagoye <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[3](#fn_2300) road at Kusaka. Then, on climbing to
the top of the mountain and gazing on the interior of the country, \[he
perceived that\] there was a house built with a raised roof-frame. <span
id="fr_2306"></span>[4](#fn_2301) The Heavenly Sovereign sent to ask
\[concerning\] that house, saying: "Whose roof with a raised frame is
that?" The answer was: "It is the house of the great Departmental Lord
of Shiki." <span id="fr_2307"></span>[5](#fn_2302) Then the Heavenly
Sovereign said: "What! a slave builds his own house in imitation of the
august abode of the Heavenly Sovereign!" . . . . and forthwith he sent
men to burn the house \[down\], when the Great Departmental Lord, with
trembling and dread, bowed his head, <span
id="fr_2308"></span>[6](#fn_2303) saying: "Being a slave, I like a slave
did not understand, and have built overmuch. I am in great dread." <span
id="fr_2309"></span>[7](#fn_2304) So the thing that he presented as an
august offering \[in token\] of his entreaty was a white dog \[312\]
clothed in cloth <span id="fr_2310"></span>[8](#fn_2305) and with a bell
hung \[round its neck\]; and he made a kinsman of his own, named
Koshihaki, <span id="fr_2311"></span>[9](#fn_2306) lead it by a string
and present it \[to the Heavenly Sovereign\]. So the Heavenly Sovereign
ordered them to desist from burning \[the house\].

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2298"></span>[389:1](kj159.htm#fr_2303) <span
id="page_389">p. 389</span> *I.e.*, *Waka-kusaka-be*.

<span id="fn_2299"></span>[389:2](kj159.htm#fr_2304) See Sect. XLIV,
Note 31. The Kusaka here mentioned is that in Kafuchi.

<span id="fn_2300"></span>[389:3](kj159.htm#fr_2305) From *tada*,
"straight "and *koyuru* "to cross," this being a short cut over the
mountains.

<span id="fn_2301"></span>[389:4](kj159.htm#fr_2306) The original of
this clause is <span id="img_38900"></span> ![](img/38900.jpg), which is
read *katsuwo wo agete ya wo tsukureru ihe ari*. The *katsuwo* (properly
<span id="page_390">p. 390</span> *katsuwo-gi* <span
id="img_39000"></span> ![](img/39000.jpg)) is the name of the uppermost
portion of the roof in modern Shinto temples, and apparently in ancient
times also in houses that were not devoted to religious purposes. The
difficulty is not with the sense, but with the derivation of the word
*katsuwo-gi*. Following the characters with which it is here and
elsewhere written, Motowori sees in it a reference to the shape of the
blocks of wood resembling "dried bonitoes," which is the modern
signification of *katsuwo*. But Moribe, in his "Examination of Difficult
Words," proposes a derivation which approves itself more to the present
writer's mind, viz., *kadzuku wo-gi* (<span id="img_39001"></span>
![](img/39001.jpg)), "small timbers atop" (see "Examination of Difficult
Words," *s.v.*). Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XLI, pp. 11-14, should be
consulted for a discussion of the whole question of the use of these
frames in ancient times, and for the special force to be attributed to
the word "raised" (<span id="img_39002"></span> ![](img/39002.jpg)) in
this passage.

<span id="fn_2302"></span>[389:5](kj159.htm#fr_2307) *Shiki no
oho-agata-nushi*. For Shiki see Sect. LXIII, Note 1.

<span id="fn_2303"></span>[389:6](kj159.htm#fr_2308) *i.e.*, did humble
obeisance by prostrating himself on the ground.

<span id="fn_2304"></span>[389:7](kj159.htm#fr_2309) Or, according to
the older reading, "This *i.e.*, thy command) \[is to be received with\]
awe."

<span id="fn_2305"></span>[389:8](kj159.htm#fr_2310) Or, "tied with \[a
string of\] cloth." The translation follows Motowori's interpretation.

<span id="fn_2306"></span>[389:9](kj159.htm#fr_2311) The name signifies
"loin-girded," *i.e.*, as may be presumed, "wearing a sword."
