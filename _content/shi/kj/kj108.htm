<p>So when His Augustness the Noble Take-uchi, taking with him the Heir Apparent for the purpose of purification,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1799"></A><A HREF="#fn_1794"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> passed through the lands of Afumi and Wakasa,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1800"></A><A HREF="#fn_1795"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he built a temporary palace at Tsunuga&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1801"></A><A HREF="#fn_1796"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> at the mouth of the Road of Koshi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1802"></A><A HREF="#fn_1797"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> [for the Heir Apparent] to dwell in. Then His Augustness the Great Deity Izasa-wake,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1803"></A><A HREF="#fn_1798"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> who dwelt in that place, appeared at night in a dream,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1804"></A><A HREF="#fn_1799"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and said: "I wish to exchange my name for the august name of the august child." Then [the dreamer of the dream] prayed, saying: "[I] am filled with awe!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1805"></A><A HREF="#fn_1800"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> The name shall be respectfully exchanged according to thy command." Again the Deity charged [him, saying]: "To-morrow morning [the Heir Apparent] must go out on the beach; I will present my [thank] offering for the name [given me] in exchange." So when [the Heir Apparent] went out in the morning to the beach, the [238] whole shore was lined with broken-nosed dolphin-fishes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1806"></A><A HREF="#fn_1801"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> Thereupon the august child caused the Deity to be addressed, saying: "Thou bestowest on me fish of thine august food."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1807"></A><A HREF="#fn_1802"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> So again his august name was <A HREF="errata.htm#68">honoured</A> by his being called the Great Deity of August Food.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1808"></A><A HREF="#fn_1803"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>" So he is now styled the Food-Wondrous-Great-Deity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1809"></A><A HREF="#fn_1804"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1794"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1799">295:1</A> Viz., by water, as described in Sect. X.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1795"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1800">295:2</A> Etymology obscure.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1796"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1801">295:3</A> The marvellous etymology of this name which the author seems to adopt will be found at the end of the Section (Note 12). The compiler of the "Chronicles "is probably nearer the truth when he derives it from <i>tsunu-ga</i>, "horned stag."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1797"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1802">295:4</A> For the meaning of this curious expression see Sect. LX, Note 20.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1798"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1803">295:5</A> The commentators give no explanation of this one of the three names of the deity in question. It would appear to be made up of a word expressive of solicitation and of a portion of the Heir Apparent 's name, thus signifying perhaps "Come on, Wake, [give me thy name] "with reference to the legend here narrated.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1799"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1804">295:6</A> To which of the two personages of the legend is not clear. Motowori, however, prefers to suppose that it was to Take-uchi, as, if the prince himself were intended, the word "dream "would probably receive the Honorific <A NAME="img_29600"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/29600.jpg">.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1800"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1805">295:7</A> Or, "I reverence [thy commands]."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1801"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1806">295:8</A> Motowori supposes that they were caught by being speared in the nose.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1802"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1807">295:9</A> <i>I.e.</i>, "fish that would naturally have formed part of thine august food," is less good to translate by "fish for <i>mine</i> august food." As usual, the original Japanese text has no Personal Pronouns to guide the reader; but, though Emperors are sometimes made to use the Honorific in speaking of themselves, this is not the custom in the case of princes' and &#332;-jin is supposed to have not yet assumed the Imperial dignity.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1803"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1808">295:10</A> <i>Mi-ke-tsu-oho-kami</i>. Motowori mentions several Deities of this name, who were, according to him, separate beings.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1804"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1809">295:11</A> <i>Kehi no oho-kami</i>. The meaning of the syllable <i>hi</i>, rendered by "wondrous "in accordance with Motowori's suggestion, is not certain.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1805"></A><A HREF="kj108.htm#fr_1810">296:12</A> <i>I.e.</i>, "the strand of blood." From <i>chi-ura</i> Motowori is obliged to derive Tsunuga as well as he can in order not to throw discredit on the implied assertion of the author: that the latter is but a mispronunciation of the former. The true derivation of Tsunuga is probably from <i>tsunuga</i> "horned stag," as already stated in Note 3.</P>
