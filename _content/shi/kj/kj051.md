## \[SECT. XLIV.—REIGN OF THE EMPEROR JIM-MU <span id="fr_876"></span>[2](#fn_872) (PART I.—HIS PROGRESS EASTWARD, AND DEATH OF HIS ELDER BROTHER)\]

The two Deities His Augustness Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko <span
id="fr_877"></span>[3](#fn_873) and his elder brother His Augustness
Itsu-se, dwelling in the palace of Takachiho. <span
id="fr_878"></span>[4](#fn_874) took counsel, saying: "By dwelling in
what place shall we \[most\] quietly carry on the government of the
Empire? <span id="fr_879"></span>[5](#fn_875) It were probably best to
go east." Forthwith they left Himuka <span
id="fr_880"></span>[6](#fn_876) on their progress <span
id="fr_881"></span>[7](#fn_877) to Tsukushi. <span
id="fr_882"></span>[8](#fn_878) So when they arrived at Usa <span
id="fr_883"></span>[9](#fn_879) in the Land of Toyo, <span
id="fr_884"></span>[10](#fn_880) two of the natives, whose names were
Usa-tsu-hiko and Usa-tsu-hime <span id="fr_885"></span>[11](#fn_881)
built a

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

palace raised on one foot, <span id="fr_886"></span>[12](#fn_882) and
offered them a great august banquet. Removing thence, they dwelt for one
\[131\] year at the palace of Wokoda <span
id="fr_887"></span>[13](#fn_883) in Tsukushi. Again making a progress
up <span id="fr_888"></span>[14](#fn_884) from that land, they dwelt
seven years at the palace of Takeri <span
id="fr_889"></span>[15](#fn_885) in the land of Agi. <span
id="fr_890"></span>[16](#fn_886) Again removing, and making a progress
up from that land, they dwelt eight years at the palace of
Takashima <span id="fr_891"></span>[17](#fn_887) in Kibi. <span
id="fr_892"></span>[18](#fn_888) So when they made their progress up
from that land, they met in the Hayasuhi <span
id="fr_893"></span>[19](#fn_889) Channel a person riding towards them on
the carapace of a tortoise, and raising his wings <span
id="fr_894"></span>[20](#fn_890) as he angled. Then they called to him
to approach, and asked him, saying: "Who art thou?" He replied, saying:
"I <span id="fr_895"></span>[21](#fn_891) am an Earthly Deity. <span
id="fr_896"></span>[22](#fn_892)" Again they asked him, saying: "Knowest
thou the sea-path?" He replied, saying: "I know it well." Again they
asked him, saying: "Wilt thou follow and respectfully serve us?" He
replied, saying: "I will respectfully serve you." So they pushed a
pole <span id="fr_897"></span>[23](#fn_893) across to him, drew him into
the august vessel, and forthwith conferred \[132\] on him the
designation of Sawa-ne-tsu-hiko <span id="fr_898"></span>[24](#fn_894)
(<span class="small">This is the ancestor of the Rulers of the land of
Yamato.</span>) <span id="fr_899"></span>[25](#fn_895) So when they went
up from that land they passed the Namihaya <span
id="fr_900"></span>[26](#fn_896) Crossing, and brought up at the haven
of Shirakata. <span id="fr_901"></span>[27](#fn_897) At this time
Nagasune-biko <span id="fr_902"></span>[28](#fn_898) of Tomi <span
id="fr_903"></span>[29](#fn_899) raised an army, and waited to go out to
fight \[against them\]. Then they took the shields that had been put in
the august vessel, and disembarked. So they called that place by the
name of Tate-dzu. <span id="fr_904"></span>[30](#fn_900) It is what is
now called the Tadetsu of Kusaka. <span id="fr_905"></span>[31](#fn_901)
Therefore when fighting with the Prince of Tomi, <span
id="fr_906"></span>[32](#fn_902) His Augustness Itsu-se was pierced in
his august hand by the Prince of Tomi's hurtful arrow. <span
id="fr_907"></span>[33](#fn_903) So then he said: "It is not right for
me, an august

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

child of the Sun-Deity, to fight facing the sun. It is for this reason
that I am stricken by the wretched villain's <span
id="fr_908"></span>[34](#fn_904) hurtful hand. I will henceforward turn
round, and smite him with my back to the sun." Having \[thus\] decided,
he, on making a progress round from the southern side, reached the sea
of Chinu, <span id="fr_909"></span>[35](#fn_905) and washed the blood on
his august hand: so it is called the sea of Chinu. <span
id="fr_910"></span>[36](#fn_906) Making a progress round from thence,
and arriving at the river-mouth of Wo <span
id="fr_911"></span>[37](#fn_907) in the land of Ki, <span
id="fr_912"></span>[38](#fn_908) he said: "Ah! that I should die
stricken by the wretched villain's hand!" and expired <span
id="fr_913"></span>[39](#fn_909) as a valiant man. <span
id="fr_914"></span>[40](#fn_910) So that river-mouth was called the
river mouth of Wo. <span id="fr_915"></span>[41](#fn_911) The Mausoleum,
too, is on Mount Kama <span id="fr_916"></span>[42](#fn_912) in the land
of Ki.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_871"></span>[159:1](kj051.htm#fr_875) <span
id="page_161">p. 161</span> Literally, "Middle Volume," there being
three in all. See Author's Preface, Note 1.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[159:2](kj051.htm#fr_876) *Jim-mu* signifies
"divine valour." It is the "canonical name" of the Emperor
*Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko* (see Introduction, [p.
xiv](kj002.htm#page_xiv)).

<span id="fn_873"></span>[159:3](kj051.htm#fr_877) In the preceding
Section this name was rendered "Divine-Yamato-Ihare-Prince." But in the
translation of Vols. II and III of this work, the Japanese proper names
are not Englished, unless there be a special reason for so doing. (See
Introduction, pp. [xviii](kj003.htm#page_xviii) and
[xix](kj003.htm#page_xix).)

<span id="fn_874"></span>[159:4](kj051.htm#fr_878) See Sect. XXXIV, Note
5.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[159:5](kj051.htm#fr_879) See Sect. XXVII, Note
13.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[159:6](kj051.htm#fr_880) See Sect. X, Note 4.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[159:7](kj051.htm#fr_881) The Japanese
expression here used is one which exclusively denotes an Imperial
Progress, and not the movements of lesser people. It recurs perpetually
in this and the following Volume.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[159:8](kj051.htm#fr_882) See Sect. V, Note 14.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[159:9](kj051.htm#fr_883) Etymology uncertain.

<span id="fn_880"></span>[159:10](kj051.htm#fr_884) See Sect. V, Note
17.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[159:11](kj051.htm#fr_885) *I.e.*, Prince of
Usa and Princess of Usa.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[160:12](kj051.htm#fr_886) In the original,
<span id="img_16100"></span> ![](img/16100.jpg), read asks *hito-tsu
agari no miya*. The parallel passage of the "Chronicles" has <span
id="img_16101"></span> ![](img/16101.jpg) which is directed to be read
in the same manner. <span id="img_16102"></span> ![](img/16102.jpg)
(*hashira*) however means, not "foot," but "pillar "; and the
commentators understand both passages to allude <span id="page_162">p.
162</span> to a single pillar, which supported the weight of the entire
building,—either as being in the middle of it, or (as Motowori opines)
by standing in the water, the edifice, according to this view, being
built on a river-bank overhanging the stream.

<span id="fn_883"></span>[160:13](kj051.htm#fr_887) This name signifies
"hillock rice-field."

<span id="fn_884"></span>[160:14](kj051.htm#fr_888) *Q.d.* towards
Yamato, the province where the capital was eventually fixed. In
Japanese, as in English, people are said to go of to the capital and
down to the country.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[160:15](kj051.htm#fr_889) Etymology uncertain.

<span id="fn_886"></span>[160:16](kj051.htm#fr_890) Etymology uncertain.
This name is better known (without the *nigori* of the second syllable)
as Aki. Aki is one of the provinces on the northern shore of the Inland
Sea.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[160:17](kj051.htm#fr_891) This name signifies
"high island."

<span id="fn_888"></span>[160:18](kj051.htm#fr_892) Etymology uncertain.
Kibi is the name of a province.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[160:19](kj051.htm#fr_893) This name signifies
"quick sucking."

<span id="fn_890"></span>[160:20](kj051.htm#fr_894) *I.e.*, as Motowori
supposes, beckoning by waving his sleeve.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[160:21](kj051.htm#fr_895) The First Personal
Pronoun is represented by the humble character <span
id="img_16200"></span> ![](img/16200.jpg), "servant."

<span id="fn_892"></span>[160:22](kj051.htm#fr_896) See Sect. I, Note
11. Motowori wishes us here to understand this expression to mean "I am
a Deity (*i.e.* a person) of the country-side." But there is no
sufficient reason for departing from the precedent of rendering the
characters <span id="img_16201"></span> ![](img/16201.jpg), which are
constantly used antithetically to <span id="img_16202"></span>
![](img/16202.jpg), by "Earthly Deity" (as opposed to "Heavenly Deity.")
Motowori likewise proposes to append to this sentence the clause "and my
name is Udzu-biko," which is found in the "Chronicles." The name may be
taken to signify "precious prince."

<span id="fn_893"></span>[160:23](kj051.htm#fr_897) The characters <span
id="img_16203"></span> ![](img/16203.jpg) are evidently, as Motowori
says, meant to represent the Japanese word *sawo*, "pole," though they
do not properly convey that meaning. Probably they are corrupt.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[160:24](kj051.htm#fr_898) *I.e.*, if we
suppress the syllable *ne*, which seems to be either Expletive or
Honorific, the "prince of the pole."

<span id="fn_895"></span>[160:25](kj051.htm#fr_899) *Yamato no kuni no
Miyadzuko*.

<span id="fn_896"></span>[160:26](kj051.htm#fr_900) This is the reading
of the name preferred by Mabuchi and Motowori; but the usual form
*Naniha* seems to be at least as well supported by early documentary
evidence. The "Chronicles" tell us that the place was called *Nani-haya*
<span id="img_16204"></span> ![](img/16204.jpg), *i.e.* "wave swift," in
allusion to the strong current which the Emperor Jim-mu here
encountered; and at the present day it is still a dangerous place for
navigation. The name properly denotes the water at the mouth of the
River Yodo, on <span id="page_163">p. 163</span> which stands the modern
town of Ohosaka (Ōzaka), for whose name Naniha is still often used as a
poetical synonym. <span id="img_16300"></span> ![](img/16300.jpg), "wave
flowers," and <span id="img_16301"></span> ![](img/16301.jpg),
"dangerous waves," are alternative ways of writing it.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[160:27](kj051.htm#fr_901) Motowori says that
he cannot explain the etymology of this word; but "white sandbank" would
seem a simple and obvious derivation. The Shirakata here mentioned is,
according to Motowori, that situated in the province of Idzumo.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[160:28](kj051.htm#fr_902) *I.e.*, the Prince
of Nagasune. A plausible interpretation of *nagasune* would be
"long-shank," which would give us Prince Long-Shank as the name of the
worthy here mentioned; but the "Chronicles" states that Nagasune was
properly the name of a place. The characters with which it is written,
moreover, signify not exactly "long shank," but "long marrow," a
designation which would have no evident personal applicability.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[160:29](kj051.htm#fr_903) A legend in the
"Chronicles" connects the name of this place with the word *tobi*, "a
kite," it being there related that a miraculous gold-coloured kite came
and perched on the Emperor Jim-mu's bow, and helped him to the victory.
Probably the legend grew out of the name of *Tobi*, which is obscure and
may have had had nothing to do with a "kite "originally.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[160:30](kj051.htm#fr_904) *I.e.*,
"shield-haven." But *conf*. next Note.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[160:31](kj051.htm#fr_905) The real etymology
of *Tada-tsu* seems to be "knot-grass-haven," [and](errata.htm#25)
probably *Taka-tsu* (for *Takatsu*), which is mentioned in Sect. LXIX,
Note 29, is but another form of the same name. Kusaka is a well-known
name in the annals of early Japan. Its signification is obscure, and the
characters (<span id="img_16302"></span> ![](img/16302.jpg)), with which
it is written, are particularly curious. There were two Kusaka, one in
the province of Kahachi and the other in Idzumi.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[160:32](kj051.htm#fr_906) Viz.,
*Nagasune-biko*.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[160:33](kj051.htm#fr_907) The wording of the
original <span id="img_16303"></span> ![](img/16303.jpg) is very
curious: Motowori reads it *Tomi-bike ga ita-ya wo ohashite*.
Immediately below we have <span id="img_16304"></span>
![](img/16304.jpg).

<span id="fn_904"></span>[161:34](kj051.htm#fr_908) The character is
<span id="img_16305"></span> ![](img/16305.jpg), properly "slave."

<span id="fn_905"></span>[161:35](kj051.htm#fr_909) The most likely
derivation of this name is from *chi-numa*, "eulalia lagoon," the fact
that it will also bear the interpretation of "blood-lagoon "being
probably but a coincidence of which the mythopoeic faculty took
advantage.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[161:36](kj051.htm#fr_910) Here written with
characters signifying "blood-lagoon."

<span id="fn_907"></span>[161:37](kj051.htm#fr_911) <span
id="page_164">p. 164</span> The characters rendered "river-mouth "are
<span id="img_16400"></span> ![](img/16400.jpg), literally "water. gate;
but here, as elsewhere, "river-mouth "seems to be the signification
meant to be conveyed. Rivers in [Japan](errata.htm#26), even at the
present day, do not bear one continuous name along their entire course,
and there would be nothing unnatural in the fact of the water at the
mouth of the river having a special designation. One of the
significations of *wo* is "man," and the legendary etymology of the name
given immediately below rests on the assumption that such is the meaning
of wo in this place. Even Motowori, however, is not satisfied with it,
and it is probably erroneous.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[161:38](kj051.htm#fr_912) See Sect. XXII, Note
14.

<span id="fn_909"></span>[161:39](kj051.htm#fr_913) The Chinese
character <span id="img_16401"></span> ![](img/16401.jpg), which is here
used, is one that specially denotes the demise of an Emperor.

<span id="fn_910"></span>[161:40](kj051.htm#fr_914) Probably the sense
meant to be conveyed is that he expired with a [gesture](errata.htm#27)
of anger and defiance.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[161:41](kj051.htm#fr_915) Here written <span
id="img_16402"></span> ![](img/16402.jpg), "man." Conf. Note 37.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[161:42](kj051.htm#fr_916) *Kama-yama*, *i.e.*
furnace-mountain."
