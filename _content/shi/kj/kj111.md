## \[SECT. CIV.—EMPEROR Ō-JIN <span id="fr_1819"></span>[1](#fn_1814) (PART 1.—GENEALOGIES).\]

His Augustness Homuda-wake dwelt at the palace of Akira at
Karushima, <span id="fr_1820"></span>[2](#fn_1815) and ruled the Empire.
This Heavenly Sovereign wedded three <span
id="fr_1821"></span>[3](#fn_1816) queens, daughters of King
Homuda-no-Ma-waka, <span id="fr_1822"></span>[4](#fn_1817) the name of
one of whom was Her Augustness Princess Takagi-no-iri; <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[5](#fn_1818) of the next, Her Augustness
Naka-tsu-hime; <span id="fr_1824"></span>[6](#fn_1819) and of the next,
Her Augustness Oto-hime. <span id="fr_1825"></span>[7](#fn_1820) (<span
class="small">The father of these Queens, King Homuda-no-ma-Waka, was
the son of His Augustness Prince Iho-ki-noiri, <span
id="fr_1826"></span>[8](#fn_1821) by his \[241\] wife
Shiritsuki-tome, <span id="fr_1827"></span>[9](#fn_1822) daughter of the
Noble Take-inada, <span id="fr_1828"></span>[10](#fn_1823) ancestor of
the Chiefs of Wohari.</span>) <span id="fr_1829"></span>[11](#fn_1824)

Waka-nuke-futa-mata <span id="fr_1851"></span>[33](#fn_1846) (<span
class="small">one Deity</span>). Again he wedded the Princess of

Shima-tari-ne, <span id="fr_1853"></span>[35](#fn_1848) ancestor \[243\]
of the Agricultural Chiefs of Sakurawi, <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1814"></span>[299:1](kj111.htm#fr_1819) Son of the Emperor
Chiū-ai and the Empress Jin-gō.

<span id="fn_1815"></span>[299:2](kj111.htm#fr_1820) In Yamato. *Akira*
Signifies "brilliant." [*Karushima*](errata.htm#69) seems to mean "the
neighbourhood of Karu, Karu being the often mentioned place of that name
in Yamato.

<span id="fn_1816"></span>[299:3](kj111.htm#fr_1821) The Auxiliary
Numeral for deities is here used.

<span id="fn_1817"></span>[299:4](kj111.htm#fr_1822) <span
id="page_301">p. 301</span> *Homuda-no-ma-waka no miko*. *Homuda* has
already been met with as the came of a place in Kahachi. *Ma-waka*
signifies "truly young." The name might therefore be rendered "truly
young king of Homuda."

<span id="fn_1818"></span>[299:5](kj111.htm#fr_1823) *Takagi no iri-bime
no mikoto*. Motowori identifies this princess with the Takaki-hime of
Sect. LXXVI, Note 21.

<span id="fn_1819"></span>[299:6](kj111.htm#fr_1824) *I.e.*, "middle
princess," she being the second of three sisters.

<span id="fn_1820"></span>[299:7](kj111.htm#fr_1825) *I.e.*, "younger
princess," she being the youngest of the sisters.

<span id="fn_1821"></span>[299:8](kj111.htm#fr_1826)
*I-ho-ki-no-iri-biko no mikoto*. See Sect. LXXVI, Note 12.

<span id="fn_1822"></span>[299:9](kj111.htm#fr_1827) *I.e.*, probably
"old woman of Shiritsuki." But it is not certain that Shiritsuki is the
name of a place.

<span id="fn_1823"></span>[299:10](kj111.htm#fr_1828) *Take-inada no
sukune*. In the "Chronicles of Old Matters of Former Ages" the name is
written *Take-ina-dane*, and it may therefore mean "brave-rice-seed."

<span id="fn_1824"></span>[299:11](kj111.htm#fr_1829) *Wohari no
murazhi*.

<span id="fn_1825"></span>[299:12](kj111.htm#fr_1830) *I.e.*, "great
middle Prince of Nukata," the latter being the name of a place in
Yamato. It is of uncertain signification.

<span id="fn_1826"></span>[299:13](kj111.htm#fr_1831) *I.e.*, "great
mountain-warden." For the appropriateness of this name conf. Sect. CV.

<span id="fn_1827"></span>[299:14](kj111.htm#fr_1832) The same name has
appeared in Sect. LXIII, Note 13.

<span id="fn_1828"></span>[299:15](kj111.htm#fr_1833) *Ohohara no
iratsume*. [Ohohara](errata.htm#70) is the name of a place in Yamato It
signifies "great moor."

<span id="fn_1829"></span>[299:16](kj111.htm#fr_1834) *Komuku no
iratsume*. This name is written <span id="img_30100"></span>
![](img/30100.jpg) and its reading as *Komuku* is somewhat
[hypothetical](errata.htm#71). It is the name of a place in Kahachi, and
probably signifies "an overflowing pool of water."

<span id="fn_1830"></span>[299:17](kj111.htm#fr_1835) *Ki no Arata no
iratsume*. *Ki* is the [province](errata.htm#72) of that name, and Arata
is a place in it. The latter name probably means "uncultivated fields."

<span id="fn_1831"></span>[299:18](kj111.htm#fr_1836) This name
signifies "Great Wren," and is thus accounted for by the author of the
"Chronicles": "On the day when the Emperor \[this Prince became the
Emperor Nin-toku\] was born, an owl flew into the parturition-hall. Next
morning early, the Heavenly Sovereign Homuda \[*i.e.*, the Emperor
Ō-jin\] sent for the Prime Minister, the Noble Takeuchi, and asked him
whereof this might be a sign. The Prime Minister replied, saying: 'It is
a good omen. Moreover yesterday, when thy servant's wife was delivered
of a child, a wren flew into the parturition-house, likewise a strange
thing.' Then the Heavenly Sovereign said: 'It is a portent from heaven
that my child and thine should be born on the same day, and both be
attended by a good omen. So let the names of the birds be taken,' and
each used for the name of the other \[*i.e.*, <span id="page_302">p.
302</span> the name of the owl for him into whose parturition-house the
wren flew, and *vice-versâ*\], as a covenant for the future.' So the
wren's name was bestowed on the Heir Apparent, who was called Great-Wren
Prince, and the owl's name was give Ito the Prime Minister's child. who
was called the Noble Owl."

<span id="fn_1832"></span>[299:19](kj111.htm#fr_1837) This name is
obscure.

<span id="fn_1833"></span>[299:20](kj111.htm#fr_1838) *Abe no iratsume*.
Abe is the name of several places in different provinces, and is of
obscure derivation and import.

<span id="fn_1834"></span>[299:21](kj111.htm#fr_1839) *Ahaji no Mikara
no iratsume*. The text properly has *Ayuchi*, but Motowori emends this
to *Ahaji* on the authority of the "Chronicles."' Mihara is the name of
a district in the island of Ahaji, and probably signifies "three moors."

<span id="fn_1835"></span>[300:22](kj111.htm#fr_1840) *Ki no Unu*
[*no*](errata.htm#74) *iratsume*. *Ki* is the province of that name, and
*Unu* a place in it. The latter name is of uncertain import.

<span id="fn_1836"></span>[300:23](kj111.htm#fr_1841) *Minu no
iratsume*. *Minu* (*Mino*) is the province of that name.

<span id="fn_1837"></span>[300:24](kj111.htm#fr_1842) "Five" must here
be a mistake for "four."

<span id="fn_1838"></span>[300:25](kj111.htm#fr_1843) For this name and
the next see Sect. CVI, Notes 5 and 4.

<span id="fn_1839"></span>[300:26](kj111.htm#fr_1844) *I.e.*, "the young
lord of Uji." Uji is the name of a district in Yamashiro, famous in
classical and modern times for its tea. The etymology is obscure.

<span id="fn_1840"></span>[300:27](kj111.htm#fr_1845) *I.e.*, "the young
lady of Yata." Yata is the name of a place in Yamato. The etymology is
obscure.

<span id="fn_1841"></span>[300:28](kj111.htm#fr_1846) *Medori no* miko.
*Medori* signifies "hen-bird:" but the reason for the application of so
strange a name to this princess, whose fortunes are related at some
length in Sect. CXXVI and CXXVII, does not appear. A similar remark
applies to the next name.

<span id="fn_1842"></span>[300:29](kj111.htm#fr_1847) *I.e.*, probably
"the lady of the little kettle."

<span id="fn_1843"></span>[300:30](kj111.htm#fr_1848) *I.e.*, "the young
lady of Uji."

<span id="fn_1844"></span>[300:31](kj111.htm#fr_1849) *I.e.*, "the truly
young middle princess of Okinaga."

<span id="fn_1845"></span>[300:32](kj111.htm#fr_1850) See Sect. XCII,
Note 27.

<span id="fn_1846"></span>[300:33](kj111.htm#fr_1851)
*Waka-muke-futa-mata no miko*. This name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1847"></span>[300:34](kj111.htm#fr_1852) *Itowi-hime*.
Itowi is the name of a place in Yamato, and is of uncertain origin.

<span id="fn_1848"></span>[300:35](kj111.htm#fr_1853) *Shima* is
probably the name of a place, while *tari* and *ne* are the frequently
recurring Honorifics rendered respectively "perfect" and "lord "in
former parts of this translation.

<span id="fn_1849"></span>[300:36](kj111.htm#fr_1854) *Sakurawi no ta-be
no murazhi*. *Ta-be*, rendered "agricultural," is literally "rice-field
tribe." *Sakurawi* ("cherry well") is the name of a place in Kahachi.

<span id="fn_1850"></span>[300:37](kj111.htm#fr_1855) *I.e.*,
falcon-lord.

<span id="fn_1851"></span>[300:38](kj111.htm#fr_1856) <span
id="page_303">p. 303</span> *Himuka no Idzumi no Naga-hime*. Himuka is
the name of a province, and Idzumi that of a district now comprised
within .the limits of Satsuma. *Nagahime*, literally "long princess,"
probably signifies "elder princess."

<span id="fn_1852"></span>[300:39](kj111.htm#fr_1857) *Oho-haye no
miko*. Signification obscure.

<span id="fn_1853"></span>[300:40](kj111.htm#fr_1858) *Wo-haye no miko*.
Signification obscure. The antithesis of the Adjectives *oho* and *wo*
("great" and "small") shows however that the names partly served to
distinguish the elder from the younger brother.

<span id="fn_1854"></span>[300:41](kj111.htm#fr_1859) *Waki-iratsume* is
"younger lady." *Hata-bi* is incomprehensible.

<span id="fn_1855"></span>[300:42](kj111.htm#fr_1860) See Sect. LXXVI,
Note 28.

<span id="fn_1856"></span>[300:43](kj111.htm#fr_1861) *I.e.*, probably
"the lady of Kaharada." The latter name (literally "rice-field on the
border of a river") is often met with.

<span id="fn_1857"></span>[300:44](kj111.htm#fr_1862) *I.e.*, "the jewel
lady."

<span id="fn_1858"></span>[300:45](kj111.htm#fr_1863) *I.e.*, "the great
middle lady of Osaka," the latter being the name of a place in Yamato
(see Sect. XLVIII, Note 1).

<span id="fn_1859"></span>[300:46](kj111.htm#fr_1864) Motowori
identifies this name with that *Koto-fushi no iratsume* in Sect. CXVII,
*q.v.*, and thinks that both this and the preceding name have only crept
into this Section by mistake.

<span id="fn_1860"></span>[300:47](kj111.htm#fr_1865) *Kataji no miko*,
Signification obscure,

<span id="fn_1861"></span>[300:48](kj111.htm#fr_1866) *Kadzuraki no
Nu-iro-me*. All the elements of this name have already been met with
several times.

<span id="fn_1862"></span>[300:49](kj111.htm#fr_1867) This child has
already appeared early in this Section, and the name is here doubtless
only repeated through some copyist's error.
