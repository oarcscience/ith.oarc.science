So do thou, in accordance with our gracious charge, descend to and dwell in and rule over it." Then the Heir Apparent His Augustness Truly-Conqueror-I-Conquer-Conquering-Swift-Heavenly-Great-Ears replied, saying: "While I&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_719"></A><A HREF="#fn_715"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> have been getting ready to descend, there has been born [to me] a child whose name is His August ness Heaven-Plenty-Earth-Plenty-Heaven's-Sun-Height-Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_720"></A><A HREF="#fn_716"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> This child should be sent down."

So [he replied]: "I will descend from Heaven according to your commands." So when His Augustness-Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty was about to descend from Heaven, there was at the eight-forking road of Heaven a Deity whose refulgence reached upwards to the Plain of High Heaven and downwards to the Central Land of [108] Reed-Plains.

<P><A NAME="fn_713"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_717">128:2</A> It will be remembered that this god was son of the Sun-goddess (or of her brother <i>Susa-no-wo</i>, "the Impetuous Male";&#8212;see Sect. XII, Note 18, and also the first two sentences of Sect. XIV and the first sentence of Sect. XV). The characters rendered "Heir Apparent" are <A NAME="img_13100"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/13100.jpg">, which form the usual Chinese equivalent of that term, and were borrowed by the Japanese. Motowori's reading of them as <i>Hi-tsugi-no-miko</i>, "Prince of the Sun's Succession," has no authority but his own patriotic fancy.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_714"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_718">128:3</A> For this tremendous name see Sect. XIII, Note 18.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_715"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_719">129:4</A> The humble character <A NAME="img_13101"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/13101.jpg">, "servant" is used for the First Personal Pronoun.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_716"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_720">129:5</A> <i>Ame-nigishi-kuni-nigishi-ama-tsu-hi-daka-hiko-ho-no-ni-nigi-no-mi-koto</i>. Excepting as regards the final <i>gi</i> of <i>ni-nigi</i>, which it is surely better with Hirata to consider as helping to form the word <i>nigi</i>, "plenty," than to take it as a separate word signifying "lord," as Motowori does, the translation follows Motowori's interpretation of the various component parts of this tremendous name, which is mostly abbreviated to its latter portion. It is precisely to this latter portion (the syllables <i>hiko ho-no nigi</i>) that considerable doubt attaches. <i>Ho</i> might mean "fire" rather than "rice-ears," and Motowori himself suggests that <i>ni-nigi</i> should perhaps be regarded as a corruption of <i>nigi-kahi</i>, "plentiful spikes of grain," rather than as "ruddy plenty." About the meaning of the rest of the name there cannot be much doubt. "Heaven's Sun Height" must be under stood as an honorific designation signifying "high as the sun in heaven."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_717"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_721">129:6</A> The translator puts this sentence between brackets because it is an evident interruption of the main story. Indeed the edition of 1688 prints it as a note to the text. The grammar of it is curious, as, on a first <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></A> reading, one would be tempted to suppose that this child," <i>i.e.</i>, His August <i>Ame-nigishi-kuni-nigishi-amatsu-hi-doka-hiko-ho-no-ni-nigi</i>, was the father of <i>Hiko-ho-no-ni-nigi</i>. But the latter name is but an abbreviated form of the former, and the god could not be his own father. The meaning rather is (and such a construction is not so forced in Japanese as it sounds in English): "As for the parentage of this child, he was born of the marriage [of His Augustness Truly-Conqueror-etc.] with Her Augustness Myriad-Looms-etc. Princess. There is, however, real confusion in the traditional genealogy, as the "Chronicles" make the deity in question father to His Augustness Heavenly-Rice-ear-Ruddy, instead of younger brother.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_718"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_722">129:7</A> Viz. His Augustness Truly-Conqueror-etc.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_719"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_723">129:8</A> <i>Yorodzu-hata-toyo-aki-dzu-shi-hime-no-mikoto</i>. Mabuchi, as quoted by Motowori, suggests that <i>yorodzu</i>, "myriad," should be connected with the word <i>yoroshi</i> "good," as signifying an extreme degree, the <i>ne plus ultra</i>. But, though perhaps a good guess at the origin in the word, it need not affect our estimate of its actual signification. The translator has, however, followed Mabuchi in considering the syllable <i>shi</i> as an apocopated form of <i>shima</i>, "island," and <i>Aki-dzu-shi</i>[<i>ma</i>] as having its usual signification of "Dragon-fly Island" (more literally "Island of the Autumn Insect") rather than accept Motowori's explanation of <i>shi</i> as representing the Verb <i>chijimu</i>, "to be puckered," and of the whole compound <i>aki-dzu-shi</i> as signifying "crape like dragon-flies' wings." Not only is there no mention of crape in other passages of these "Records," but the derivation does not, to say the least, recommend itself on <A HREF="errata.htm#19">philological</A> grounds.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_720"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_724">129:9</A> <i>Ame-no-ho-akari-no-Mikoto</i>. The word rendered "ripe" will bear equally well the interpretation "red."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_721"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_725">129:10</A> <i>Hiko-ho-no-ni-nigi</i>, the abbreviated form of the name in Note 6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_722"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_726">129:11</A> <i>Toyo-ashi-hara-no-midzu-hono-kuni</i>. This periphrastic synonym of Japan has appeared under a slightly shorter form in Sect. IX (Note 18).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_723"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_727">129:12</A> <i>Ame-no-udzu-me-no-kami</i>, the goddess whose loud, bold merriment was the chief cause of the Sun-Goddess emerging from her retreat in the Cavern (see Sect XVI, Note 28).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_724"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_728">129:13</A> <i>I.e.</i>, "The brazen-facedness allows thee to stare others out of countenance, and make them uneasy."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_725"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_729">130:14</A> Between this sentence and the next, the Alarming-Female-Deity must be supposed to have gone on her embassy and to have delivered the message with which she had been entrusted.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/13200.jpg">, literally "servant."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_727"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_731">130:16</A> <a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></A> <i>Saruta-biko-no-kami</i>. This is Motowori's reading. The more usual reading is <i>Saruda-hiko</i>, transposing the <i>nigori</i>. Hirata prefers to read <i>Sada-biko</i>, and takes <i>Saruda</i> or <i>Sada</i> to be the name of a place, which indeed seems the most acceptable view. The name actually signifies "monkey field." Motowori's interpretation of its import is a marvellous example of Japanese etymological gymnastics (see Vol. XV, p. 16 of his Commentary). Moribe's derivation from <i>sari-hate-hiko</i> (<A NAME="img_13300"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/13300.jpg">) is no better.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_728"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_732">130:17</A> Or "guide."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_729"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_733">130:18</A> For these five names and for the Deity Thought-Includer and the [Heavenly] Hand-Strength-Male-Deity mentioned a few lines further on, see Sect. XVI, Notes 15, 16, 28. 12, 13, 7, and 27 respectively.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_730"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_734">130:19</A> <i>Tomo-no-wo</i>. This expression is here taken to refer to the various offices assumed by the five deities in question at the time of the withdrawal of the Sun-Goddess into the cave. It signifies properly the head of a company.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_731"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_735">130:20</A> The allusion is to the story in Sect. XVI. Moribe, in his Critique on Motowori's Commentary, points out that it was only the mirror which allured the goddess from the cave. In the Japanese original of this passage, however, even more than in the English translation, the expression "that had allured" is made to both objects.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_732"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_736">130:21</A> Obtained from the tail of the Serpent of Koshi. See the story in Sect. XVIII.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_733"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_737">130:22</A> <i>Ame-no-iha-to-wake-no-kami</i>. Hirata observes that this must not be considered as the name of an independent Deity, but be taken simply as an alternative name of <i>Ame-no-jikara-wo-no-kami</i> (the "Heavenly-Hand-Strength-Male-Deity"). The part taken by this Deity in the legend narrated in Sect. XVI. seems a sufficient warrant for such an opinion, though a little lower down in this Section the two are again mentioned separately.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_734"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_738">130:23</A> <i>Toko-yo</i>. These words, which, according to the rules of Japanese construction, are placed at the commencement of the clause, must be understood to apply either to the three gods collectively or to the first-mentioned (the Deity Thought-Includer) alone.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_735"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_739">130:24</A> Or "worshipping before us," or "in our presence." The strictly logical concordance of an English sentence makes it appear as if the mirror were to be taken to represent the spirit of both Deities whose names are subjects of the first clause. In Japanese, however, all such concordances are much more loosely observed, and it is only the spirit of the Sun-Goddess that we must understand to be here intended. </P>
<P><A NAME="fn_736"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_740">130:25</A> <a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></A> <i>Isuzu</i> (literally "fifty bells," or else perhaps the name of a kind of grass with which the neighbourhood may originally have been overgrown) is the name of the site of the "Inner Temple" of Ise. It is in the Japanese text preceded by the Pillow-Word <i>saku-kushiro</i>, literally "rent bracelet." See Mabuchi's "Dictionary of Pillow-Words" <i>s. v</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_737"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_741">130:26</A> <i>Toyo-uke-no-kami</i>, the same as <i>Toyo-uke-bime</i> (see Sect. VII, Note 6). The mention of: this goddess in this place is curious, as she would not seem to be connected with the legend. Motowori, however, supposes that it is through some accidental omission that she does not figure in the list of deities said to have accompanied the heaven-descended Sovereign.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_738"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_742">130:27</A> This name signifies "meeting when crossing" or "crossing to meet", and is connected by the commentators with an unimportant tradition, for which see Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XV, p. 48.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_739"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_743">130:28</A> These two names are in the original <i>Kushi-iha-ma-do-no-kami</i> and <i>Toyo-iha-mado-no-kami</i>. The tradition in the "Gleanings of Ancient Story" makes them two separate deities.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_740"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_744">130:29</A> Viz. of the gate or gates of the Imperial Palace.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_742"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_746">131:31</A> <i>Nakatomi no murazhi</i>. <i>Nakatomi</i> is taken by Motowori to be a contraction of <i>naka-tori-omi</i>, and by Mabuchi to be a contraction of <i>naka-tori-omi</i>, either of which may be freely rendered "<A HREF="errata.htm#20">middlemen</A>," "intercessors," referring to the religious functions which were hereditary in this family. See "Commentary on the Ritual of the General Purification," Vol. II, pp. 2-3.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_743"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_747">131:32</A> <i>Imibe no obito</i>. <i>Imibe</i> is derived from <i>imu</i>, "to avoid," <i>i.e.</i> "to abstain from," and <i>mure</i>, "a flock" or "collection of persons," "a clan," and refers to the religious duties of this hereditary class of priests, which naturally required their avoidance of all ceremonial uncleanness. The word "priest" would fairly, though freely, represent the meaning of the compound.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_744"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_748">131:33</A> <i>Saru me no kimi</i>. For the traditional origin of this name see Sect. XXXV. These "duchesses" were priestesses: but it is a matter of dispute between the commentators whether the title was simply an official one, or hereditary in the female line.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_745"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_749">131:34</A> <i>Kagami-tsukuri no murazhi</i>. Of this family nothing would seem to be known.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_746"></A><A HREF="kj040.htm#fr_750">131:35</A> <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A> <i>Tama-no-ya</i> (or <i>Tama n&#8217;Oya</i>) <i>no murazhi</i>. But the name should probably be <i>Tama-tsukuri no murazhi</i>, <i>i.e.</i> "Jewel-Making Chieftains," a "gentile name" which is found in the later literature. Perhaps, however, we should understand both this means and the previous one to be simple inventions by names, of which divine ancestry was claimed for the hereditary guilds of jewellers and mirror-makers.</P>
