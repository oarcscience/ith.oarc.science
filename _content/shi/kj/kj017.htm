<p>Therefore the Great Deity the Male-Who-Invites said: "Nay! hideous!

So he went out to a plain [covered with] <i>ahagi</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> at a small river-mouth near Tachibana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in Himuka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in [the island of] Tsukushi, and purified and cleansed himself.

<P><A NAME="fn_278"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_281">44:1</A> <a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></A> The words "I have" thus repeated are an attempt to render the concluding words <i>ari keri</i> of the sentence in the original, by which, though they have no particular sense, the author evidently set great store, as he writes them syllabically. They may be considered to emphasize what goes before and, says Motowori, "convey the idea of lamentation." The idiom occurs some half-dozen times in the course of the present work.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_279"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_282">44:2</A> This botanical name is identified by Arawi Hakuseki and Hirata with the modern <i>hagi</i>, or "bushclover" (<i>lespdeza</i> of various species). The received opinion used to be that the <i>awoki</i> (<i>Aucuba Japonica</i>) was here intended.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_280"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_283">44:3</A> Tachibana is understood to be the general designation of trees of the orange tribe. (See however Sect. LXXIV, Note 7). Here it is used as a proper name.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_281"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_284">44:4</A> This name, which signifies "sun-confronting," was not unnaturally bestowed on a province in the eastern part of the westernmost of the larger Japanese islands, as it might well be conceived as lying "opposite the sun." It has, however, been <A HREF="errata.htm#12">supposed</A> to have originally denoted the whole of the island in question. In any case the name is not inappropriate, as the island has a long eastern sea-board.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_282"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_285">44:5</A> In our text <i>Tsuki-tatsu-funa-do</i>. But <i>funa</i> should almost certainly be <i>ku-na</i>, and the name (which has here been translated accordingly) is then illustrated by the more extended version of this myth which is given in the "Chronicles," where we read that the god (probably addressing his sister) threw down his staff with the words: "Come no further." "Stand" must be understood in a Transitive sense: the god <i>stood</i> his staff up by thrusting it into the sand.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_283"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_286">44:6</A> This is Moribe's explanation ("<i>Idzu-no-Chi-waki</i>." Vol. IV, p. 44) of the meaning of the original name <i>Michi-no-naga-chiha-no-kami</i>, the syllable <i>ha</i> of which is considered by him to be an alternative form of <i>ma</i> (<A NAME="img_04700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/04700.jpg">, "space"). It is however a great crux, and Motowori confesses his inability to explain it satisfactorily. Other views as to the import of the syllable in question will be found in the "<i>Jin-dai no maki Mo-shiho-gusa</i>." Vol. II. p. 29.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_284"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_287">45:7</A> This seems to be the meaning of the original name, if we retain the reading <i>Toki-okashi-no-kami</i>. See however Motowori's remarks <i>in loco</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_285"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_288">45:8</A> <i>Wadzurahi-no-ushi-no-kami</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_286"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_289">45:9</A> <i>Chi-mata-no-kami</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_287"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_290">45:10</A> <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></A> <i>Aki-guhi-no-ushi-no-kami</i>. The English rendering of this obscure name proceeds on the assumption that Motowori is correct when he proposes to consider <i>kuhi</i> as equivalent in this place to <i>kuchi</i>, "mouth." The gaping trousers no longer filled by the deity's legs would perhaps suggest the idea of an open mouth, though it is true that this is not the deity said to have been actually born from that portion of the attire.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_288"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_291">45:11</A> or "arm."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_289"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_292">45:12</A> The names of this deity and the five who follow are in the original <i>Oki-zakaru-no-kami</i>, <i>Oki-tsu-nagisa-biko-no-kami</i>, <i>Oki-tsu-kahi-bera-no-kami</i>, <i>He-zakaru-no-kami</i>, <i>He-tsu-nagisa-biko-no-kami</i> and <i>He-tsu-kahi-bera-no-kami</i>. The word "wash," by which for want of a better one the Substantive <i>nagisa</i> has been rendered, must be understood to signify the part nearest to the strand o the sea or of a river,&#8212;the boundary of the waves. The third and sixth of this set of names, in which the syllables <i>kahi-bera</i> (here represented by "Intermediate Direction") offer a good deal of difficulty, have been translated in accordance with Motowori's explanation of their probable meaning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_290"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_293">45:13</A> Lit. "right." In Chinese and Japanese compositions the lines follow each other from right to left instead of from top to bottom as with us. "Right" therefore signifies "foregoing," and "left," "following."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_291"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_294">45:14</A> The names of these two deities in the original are <i>Ya-so-maga-tsu-bi-no-kami</i> and <i>Oho-maga-tsu-bi-no-kami</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_292"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_295">45:15</A> Viv. to Hades.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_293"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_296">46:16</A> The names of these two deities in the original are <i>Kamu-naho-bi-no-kami</i> and <i>Oho-na-ho-bi-no-kami</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_294"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_297">46:17</A> <i>Idzu-no-me-no-kami</i>. The word <i>Idzu</i> is incomprehensible, unless indeed, following Motowori, we identify this goddess with the god and goddess <i>Haya-aki-dzu-hiko</i> and <i>Haya-aki-dsu-hime</i> mentioned in Sect. VI, Note 10, and consider <i>idzu</i> as standing by apheresis for <i>aki-dsu</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_295"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_298">46:18</A> The original names of this deity and the five who follow are <i>Soko-tsu-wata-tsu-mi-no-kami</i>, <i>Soko-dzutsu-no-wo-no-mi-koto</i>, <i>Naka-tsu-wata-tsu-mi-no-kami</i>, <i>Naka-dzutsu-no-wo-mikoto</i>, <i>Uha-tsu-wata-tsu-mi-no-kami</i>, and <i>Uha-dzutsu-no-wo-no-mikoto</i>. There is the usual doubt as to the signification to be assigned to the syllable <i>tsu</i> in the second, fourth and last of these names. If it really means, not "elder" but "possessor," we should be obliged to translate by "the Bottom-<A HREF="errata.htm#13"><i>Possessing</i></A>-Male." etc.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_296"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_299">46:19</A> <i>Adumi-no-murazhi</i>. This name is said by Motowori to be taken from that of a place in the province of Shinano. But Moribe shows that <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></A> at any rate the etymology of the word may be traced to <i>ama-tsu-mochi</i>, "Possessors of fishermen."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_297"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_300">46:20</A> It is impossible to translate this name which, according to Motowori, is derived from those of two districts in Shinano to which the word <i>utsushi</i> (for <i>utsutsu</i>, "present" or "living") is prefixed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_298"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_301">46:21</A> Attention must again be drawn to the vagueness of the Japanese perception of the distinction between Singular and Plural. As three deities are particularly and repeatedly mentioned in the foregoing text, we are forced to translate this passage in the Plural; and yet how could one child have three fathers?</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_299"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_302">46:22</A> <i>Sumi-no-ye</i>, also called <i>Sumi-yoshi</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, by a play upon words, "pleasant to dwell in." The real etymology of <i>sumi</i> is not certain.&#8212;Instead of "the three Great Deities," we might translate by "the Great Deities of the Three Shrines."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_300"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_303">46:23</A> <i>Ama-terasu-oho-mi-kami</i> (<A NAME="img_04900"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/04900.jpg">). The reading <i>terasu</i>, which is established by the authority of the "Collection of a Myriad Leaves" and by almost universal usage, must not mislead the student into imagining that the Verb, because it is Causative in form, has a Causative meaning which would require some such English translation as "Heaven-Illuminating." The Causative form is simply Honorific, and the two words <i>ama terasu</i> signify, as Motowori explains, "shining in heaven."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_301"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_304">46:24</A> <i>Tsuki-yomi-no-kami</i>. There is no doubt as to a moon-god being intended, but the precise import of the name is disputed. The translator has followed Mabuchi's view as quoted by Motowori, and which is supported by the fact that, from classical times down to the present day, <i>tsuku-yo</i> or <i>tsuki-yo</i> has been a word in common use to denote a fine moonlight night. If we were to take <i>yomi</i> as one word, we should have to render it either by "Moon-Hades" or by "Moon-Darkness," which seem less appropriate designations, though still of plain enough intent. The characters <A NAME="img_04901"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/04901.jpg">, <A NAME="img_04902"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/04902.jpg"> and <A NAME="img_04903"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/04903.jpg">, with which the name is variously written, seem all phonetic unless we might take the second set to mean the crescent (lit. "moon-bow).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_302"></A><A HREF="kj017.htm#fr_305">46:25</A> <i>Take-haya-susa-no-wo-no-mikoto</i>. <i>Susa</i>, which is sometimes read <i>Sosa</i>, is rendered by the word "impetuous" in accordance with Mabuchi's View as quoted by Motowori. The first member of this compound name is frequently omitted.</P>
