## \[SECT. XXVIII.—THE AUGUST-LUCK-SPIRIT-THE-AUGUST-WONDROUS-SPIRIT.\] <span id="fr_584"></span>[1](#fn_580)

Thereupon the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land lamented himself, and said:
"How shall I alone be able to make this land? <span
id="fr_585"></span>[2](#fn_581) Together with what Deity can I make this
land?" At this time there came a Deity illuminating the sea. This Deity
said: "If thou wilt lay me to rest <span id="fr_586"></span>[3](#fn_582)
well, I can make it together with thee. If not, the land cannot be
made." Then the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land said: "If that be so,
what is the manner of reverently laying thee to rest?" He replied,
saying: "Reverently worship me on Yamato's green fence, the eastern
mountain's top." <span id="fr_587"></span>[4](#fn_583) This is the Deity
who dwells on the top of Mount Mimoro. <span
id="fr_588"></span>[5](#fn_584)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_580"></span>[106:1](kj035.htm#fr_584) <span
id="page_106">p. 106</span> In the "Chronicles," this is given as the
designation of the Deity who came over the sea, and Motowori therefore
adopts it as the heading of this Section.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[106:2](kj035.htm#fr_585) For an explanation of
this expression see Sect. XXIII, Note 26.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[106:3](kj035.htm#fr_586) *I.e.* "if thou wilt
build me a temple." The original might also be rendered "if thou wilt
worship before me," or "at my shrine," of "if thou wilt establish a
temple to me."

<span id="fn_583"></span>[106:4](kj035.htm#fr_587) *I.e.* on Mount
Mimoro which stands as a protecting fence in the eastern part of the
province of Yamato. *Awo-kaki-yama*, "green fence mountain," became a
proper name used alternatively for Mount Mimoro (or, according to the
later pronunciation, Mimuro). In like manner *Himukashi-yama* (in the
later language *Higashi-yama*) "eastern mountain," has by some been
considered to be a proper name.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[106:5](kj035.htm#fr_588) *I.e.* "august
house;" so called probably from the temple of the deity.
