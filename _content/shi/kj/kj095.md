## \[SECT. LXXXVIII.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART XIII.—YAMATO-TAKE MEETS THE DEITY OF MOUNT IBUKI).\]

Hereupon he said: "As for the Deity of this mountain, I will simply take
him empty-handed." <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1](#fn_1629)—and was
ascending the mountain, when there met him on the mountain-side a white
boar whose size was like unto that of a bull. <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[2](#fn_1630) Then he lifted up words, <span
id="fr_1635"></span>[3](#fn_1631) and said: "This creature that is
transformed into a white boar must be a messenger from the Deity. <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[4](#fn_1632) Though I slay it not now, I will slay
it when I return,"—and \[so saying.\] ascended. Thereupon the Deity
caused heavy ice-rain <span id="fr_1637"></span>[5](#fn_1633) to fall,
striking and perplexing His Augustness Yamato-take. (<span
class="small">This creature transformed into a white boar was not a
messenger from the Deity, <span id="fr_1638"></span>[6](#fn_1634) but
the very Deity in person. Owing to the lifting up of words, he appeared
and misled \[Yamato-take. <span
id="fr_1639"></span>[6](#fn_1634)\])</span> So when, on descending back,
he reached the fresh spring of Tama-kuro-be <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[7](#fn_1635) and rested there, his august heart
awoke somewhat. <span id="fr_1641"></span>[8](#fn_1636) So that fresh
spring is called by the name of the fresh spring of Wi-same.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1629"></span>[269:1](kj095.htm#fr_1633) <span
id="page_269">p. 269</span> *I.e.*, without weapons, and specially
without the magic sword which he had left behind in Princess Miyazu's
house.

<span id="fn_1630"></span>[269:2](kj095.htm#fr_1634) Or "ox," or "cow,"
the original word not distinguishing between the sexes.

<span id="fn_1631"></span>[269:3](kj095.htm#fr_1635) <span
id="page_270">p. 270</span> The Japanese expression *kota-age shite*,
here rendered "lifted up. words," very frequently has the signification
of "lifting up a prayer" to some superhuman being. In this passage,
however, it conveys no more than its proper etymological meaning.

<span id="fn_1632"></span>[269:4](kj095.htm#fr_1636) Viz., the god of
Mount Ibuki.

<span id="fn_1633"></span>[269:5](kj095.htm#fr_1637) Perhaps "hail" may
be intended by this expression, and so Motowori decides. But this
interpretation of the term seems to agree well with the Song in Sect.
CXLII.

<span id="fn_1634"></span>[269:6](kj095.htm#fr_1639) The commentators
disagree as to whether this note should or should not be considered to
form part of the original text. Motowori so considers it. He however, in
the opinion of the translator, is not happy in his alteration of the
*kana* reading given by the editor of 1687, which latter has accordingly
been followed in the English version.

<span id="fn_1635"></span>[269:7](kj095.htm#fr_1640) The literal meaning
of this name is "jewel-store-tribe;" but complete uncertainty attaches
both to the etymology of the word and to the position of the place. The
first printed edition has *Tama-kuhi-be*.

<span id="fn_1636"></span>[269:8](kj095.htm#fr_1641) He had been misled
and dazed, but now came to himself again. Thence, according to the
etymology of our author, the name of *Wi-same*, which signifies
"dwelling (resting) and awaking," given to the spring.
