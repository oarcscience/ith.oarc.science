## \[SECT. CLXVI.—EMPEROR SEI-NEI (PART IV.—PRINCE OHOKE CEDES THE EMPIRE TO PRINCE WOKE).\]

Then each of the two Princes ceded the Empire to the other, and His
Augustness Ohoke \[finally\] ceded it to the younger brother His
[Augustness](errata.htm#118) Woke, saying: "Had not Thine Augustness
revealed our names when we dwelt in the house of Shizhimu in Harima, we
should never have arrived at being the lords of the Empire. This is
quite owing to Thine Augustness's deed. So, though I be the elder
brother, do Thine Augustness rule the Empire first,"—and \[with these
words\] he urgently ceded \[his claim\]. So, being unable to refuse, His
Augustness Woke ruled the Empire first.
