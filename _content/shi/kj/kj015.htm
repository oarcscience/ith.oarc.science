<P><A NAME="fn_235"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_235">35:1</A> <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></A> One "grasp" is defined as "the breadth of four fingers when the hand is clenched," so that the meaning intended to be conveyed is of a big sabre ten hand-breadths long. The length of sabres and of beards was measured by such "grasps" or "hand-breadths."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_236"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_236">36:2</A> The original names of this deity and the next are <i>Iha-saku-no-kami</i> and <i>Ne-saki-no-kami</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_237"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_237">36:3</A> Or the Rock-Elder, <i>i.e.</i>, the Male Deity the Elder of the Rocks, if with Motowori we regard the second <i>tsu</i> of the original name <i>Iha-tsutsu-no-wo-no-kami</i> as being equivalent to <i>chi</i> or <i>ji</i>, supposed to be "the honorific appellation of males" elsewhere rendered "elder." The translation in the text proceeds on the assumption that this <i>tsu</i> represents <i>mochi</i>: The purport of the name remains much the same whichever of these two views be adopted.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_238"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_238">36:4</A> Explained by reference to the parallel passage of the "Chronicles" through a character signifying "the knob at the end of the guard of the sword.'&#8212;(Williams' "Syllabic Dictionary.")</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_239"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_239">36:5</A> <i>Mika-haya-bi-no-kami</i>. Motowori seems to be right in regarding <i>mika</i> as equivalent to <i>ika</i>, the root of <i>ikameshiki</i>, "stern," "awful," and <i>bi</i> as the root of <i>buru</i>, a verbalising suffix.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_240"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_240">36:6</A> <i>Hi-haya-bi-no-kami</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_241"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_241">36:7</A> <i>Take-mika-dzu-chi-no-wo-no-kami</i>, written with the characters <A NAME="img_03700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/03700.jpg">. The translator has without much hesitation followed Motowori's interpretation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_242"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_242">36:8</A> <i>Take-futsu-no-kami</i>. The text name is <i>Toyo-futsu-no-kami</i>. <i>Futsu</i> is interpreted in the sense of "the sound of snapping" by reference to a Passage in the "Chronicles" where it occurs written both ideographically and phonetically in the name of the deity <i>Futsu-no-mi-tama</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_243"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_243">36:9</A> The etymology of both these name is obscure. <i>Kura</i>, the first element of each compound, signifies "dark."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_244"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_244">36:10</A> <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></A> This is the explanation of the original name <i>Ma-saka-yama-tsu-mi-no-kami</i> which is given in the "Secret of the Chronicles of Japan," and is approved by the later commentators.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_245"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_245">36:11</A> <i>Odo-yama-tsu-mi-no-kami</i>. The English rendering is uncertain, as it rests only on a conjecture of Motowori's, deriving <i>odo</i> from <i>ori do</i> (<A NAME="img_03800"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/03800.jpg">), "descending place," "way down."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_246"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_246">36:12</A> The original names of this and the following five deities are: <i>Oku-yama-tsumi-no-kami</i>, <i>Kura-yama-tsu-mi-no-kami</i>, <i>Shigi-yama-tsu-mi-no-kami</i>, <i>Ha-yama-tsu-mi-no-kami</i>, <i>Hayama-tsu-mi-no-kami</i> and <i>To-yama-tsumi-no-kami</i>. <i>Shigi</i>, here translated "dense," seems to be almost certainly a contraction of <i>Shigeki</i>, which has that signification. <i>Ha-yama</i> is a term for which it is hard to find an exact English equivalent. It denotes the lesser hills or first visibly rising ground forming the approach to an actual mountain-range. The signification of <i>to</i> in the last name of the set is disputed. Mabuchi takes it in the sense of "gate." The translator prefers Motowori's view: but after all, the difference in meaning does not amount to much. A third derivation proposed by Motowori is <i>tawa-yama</i>, <i>i.e.</i> "mountains with folds."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_247"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_248">36:13</A> Or "arm."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_248"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_249">36:14</A> Or "leg."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_249"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_250">37:14</A> Or "leg."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_250"></A><A HREF="kj015.htm#fr_251">37:15</A> These two names are in the original <i>Ame-no-wo-ha-bori</i> and <i>Itsu-no-wo-ha-bori</i>. Their import is not absolutely clear, but they seem to designate a weapon broad towards the point, such as is represented in the illustrations given in Vol. I, pp. 19-20 and Vol. II, pp. 4-5 of the "<i>Tokiha-Gusa</i>."</P>
