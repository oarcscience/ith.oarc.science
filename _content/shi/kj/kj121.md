## \[SECT. CXIV.—EMPEROR Ō-JIN (PART XI.—AMA-NO-HI-BOKO CROSSES OVER TO JAPAN)\]

Moreover of old there had been \[a man\] called by the name of
Ama-no-hi-boko, <span id="fr_1947"></span>[1](#fn_1942) child of the
ruler of the land of Shiragi. This person crossed over here \[to
Japan\]. The reason of his crossing over here was \[this\]: In the land
of Shiragi there was a certain lagoon, <span
id="fr_1948"></span>[2](#fn_1943) called by the name of the Agu
Lagoon. <span id="fr_1949"></span>[3](#fn_1944) On the bank of this
lagoon <span id="fr_1950"></span>[4](#fn_1945) a certain poor girl was
\[taking her\] midday sleep. Tunc solis radii, coelesti arcui similes,
in privatas partes impegerunt. Again there was a certain poor man,
\[259\] who, thinking this occurrence <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[5b](#fn_1946) strange, constantly watched the
woman's behaviour. So the woman, having conceived from the time of that
midday sleep, gave birth to

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

a red jewel. Then the poor man who had watched her begged \[to be
allowed\] to take the jewel, and kept it constantly wrapped up by his
side. <span id="fr_1952"></span>[6](#fn_1947) This person, having
planted a rice-field in a valley, <span
id="fr_1953"></span>[7](#fn_1948) had loaded a cow <span
id="fr_1954"></span>[8](#fn_1949) with food for the labourers, and was
getting into the middle of the valley, when he met the ruler's son,
Ama-no-hi-boko, who thereupon asked him, saying: "Why enterest thou the
valley with a load of food upon a cow? Thou wilt surely kill this cow
and eat her." Forthwith he seized the man and was about to put him into
prison, when the man replied, saying: "I was not going to kill the cow.
I was simply taking food to the people in the fields." But still \[the
ruler's child\] would not let him go. 'Then he undid the jewel \[which
hung\] at his side, and \[therewith\] bribed \[the ruler's child\]. So
\[the latter\] let the poor man go, brought the jewel \[home\], and
placed it beside his couch. Forthwith it was trans-formed into a
beautiful maiden, whom he straightway wedded, and made his chief wife.
Then the maiden perpetually prepared all sorts of dainties with which
she constantly fed her husband. So the ruler's child \[grew\] proud in
his heart, and reviled his wife. But the woman said: "I am not a woman
who ought to be the wife of such as thou. I will go to the land of my
ancestors;"—and forthwith she secretly embarked in a boat, and fled away
across here \[to Japan\], and landed <span
id="fr_1955"></span>[9](#fn_1950) at Naniha. <span
id="fr_1956"></span>[10](#fn_1951) (<span class="small">This is the
deity called Princess Akaru, <span id="fr_1957"></span>[11](#fn_1952)
who dwells in the shrine of Hime-goso <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[12](#fn_1953) at Naniha.</span>) Thereupon
Ame-no-hi-boko, hearing \[260\] of his wife's flight, forthwith pursued
her across hither, and was about to arrive at Naniha, when the Deity of
the passage <span id="fr_1959"></span>[13](#fn_1954) prevented his
entrance. So he went back again, and landed in the country of
Tajima. <span id="fr_1960"></span>[14](#fn_1955)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1942"></span>[321:1](kj121.htm#fr_1947) <span
id="page_323">p. 323</span> Or, according to Motowori's reading, *Ame
no-hi boko*. The characters in the next, <span id="img_32300"></span>
![](img/32300.jpg) signify "heavenly sun-spear." But the homonymous
characters <span id="img_32301"></span> ![](img/32301.jpg), with which
the name is written in the "Gleanings from Ancient Story," and which are
approved of both by Motowori and by Tanigaha Shisei. signify
"fisherman's chamaecyparis spear."

<span id="fn_1943"></span>[321:2](kj121.htm#fr_1948) Apparently nothing
more is meant than that there was "*a* lagoon;" but still the *one*
(<span id="img_32302"></span> ![](img/32302.jpg)) in this context is
curious, and Motowori retains it as *hito-tsu no* in the Japanese
reading. "A certain" seems best to render its force in English, as again
in the following sentences, where Motowori interprets it by the
character <span id="img_32303"></span> ![](img/32303.jpg). It is of
strangely frequent recurrence in the opening sentences of this Section,
which are altogether peculiar in style.

<span id="fn_1944"></span>[321:3](kj121.htm#fr_1949) *Agu-numa*. The
meaning of this name is unknown.

<span id="fn_1945"></span>[321:4](kj121.htm#fr_1950) The Old Printed
Edition has the word "mud" instead of "lagoon."

<span id="fn_1946"></span>[321:5b](kj121.htm#fr_1951) Literally, "this
appearance."

<span id="fn_1947"></span>[322:6](kj121.htm#fr_1952) Literally,
"attached to his loins."

<span id="fn_1948"></span>[322:7](kj121.htm#fr_1953) The words rendered
"in a valley "are in the text <span id="img_32304"></span>
![](img/32304.jpg), of which the commentators find it difficult to make
proper Japanese. The translator has followed them in neglecting the
character <span id="img_32305"></span> ![](img/32305.jpg), "mountain."

<span id="fn_1949"></span>[322:8](kj121.htm#fr_1954) Or bull, or
bullock; for Japanese does not distinguish Genders.

<span id="fn_1950"></span>[322:9](kj121.htm#fr_1955) Literally,
"stopped."

<span id="fn_1951"></span>[322:10](kj121.htm#fr_1956) See Sect. XLIV,
Note 26.

<span id="fn_1952"></span>[322:11](kj121.htm#fr_1957) *Akaru-hime*,
*i.e.*, "Brilliant Princess."

<span id="fn_1953"></span>[322:12](kj121.htm#fr_1958) The signification
of this name is obscure. Motowori identifies the place with the modern
Kodzu (<span id="img_32306"></span> ![](img/32306.jpg)).

<span id="fn_1954"></span>[322:13](kj121.htm#fr_1959) *I.e.*, the
water-god of the sea near Naniha.

<span id="fn_1955"></span>[322:14](kj121.htm#fr_1960) See Sect. LXXIV,
Note 1.
