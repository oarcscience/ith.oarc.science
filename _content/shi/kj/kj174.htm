<p>His Augustness Woke-no-ihasu-wake dwelt at the palace of Chika-tsu-Asuka,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2389"></A><A HREF="#fn_2384"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and ruled the Empire for</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_417"><font size="1" color="green">p. 417</font></A></p>  
<p>eight years. The Heavenly Sovereign wedded the Queen of Naniha,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2390"></A><A HREF="#fn_2385"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> daughter of the King of Ihaki.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2391"></A><A HREF="#fn_2386"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> He had no children. At the time when this Heavenly Sovereign was searching for the august bones of the King his father, King Ichinobe,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2392"></A><A HREF="#fn_2387"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> there came out from the land of Afumi [to the palace] a poor old woman, who said: "The place where the prince's august bones are buried is specially well known to me,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2393"></A><A HREF="#fn_2388"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and moreover [his skeleton] can be known by his august teeth." (<small>His august teeth were teeth uneven like a lily.</small>) Then people were set&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2394"></A><A HREF="#fn_2389"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> to dig the [334] ground and search for the august bones; and the bones having been forthwith obtained, an august mausoleum was made on the mountain east of the Moor of Kaya,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2395"></A><A HREF="#fn_2390"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and they were interred, and the children of Kara-fukuro&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2396"></A><A HREF="#fn_2391"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> were made to guard the august mausoleum. Afterwards the august bones were brought up [to the Capital]. So having returned up [to the Capital, the Heavenly Sovereign] sent for the old woman, praised her for having, without forgetting, kept the place in mind, and conferred upon her the name of the Old Woman Oki-me:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2397"></A><A HREF="#fn_2392"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> thus did he send for her into the palace, and deign to treat her with deep and wide kindness. So he built a house for the old woman to dwell in dose to the palace, and always sent for her every day. So he hung a bell by the door of the great hall, and always rang it when he wished to call the old woman. So he composed an august Song. That Song said:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Oh! the far-distant bell tinkles when she has past the moor with its low eulalias and the little valley. Oh! Oki-me must be coming!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2398"></A><A HREF="#fn_2393"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></div></p>  
<p>Hereupon the old woman said: "I am very aged, [335]</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>

<p>and would fain depart to my native land." So when the Heavenly Sovereign let her depart according to her request, he saw her off and sang, saying:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Ah Okime! Okime from Afumi! from to-morrow [onwards] wilt [thou] be hidden behind the deep mountains, and alas! not seen!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2399"></A><A HREF="#fn_2394"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></div></p>

<IMG SRC="img/41800.jpg">, which is more applicable to the raising of troops than to the setting to work of peasants. It seems however here to be used in the latter sense; or perhaps we should consider it to mean that people were got together.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2390"></A><A HREF="kj174.htm#fr_2395">417:7</A> See Sect. CXLVIII, Note 3. Possibly the "mountain east" should be a Proper Name,&#8212;Eastern Mountain,&#8212;but it is not taken as such by Motowori.</P>

Grammar would lead us to expect the order of the words forming the name to be reversed thus, <i>Mo-oki</i>; but see Motowori's remarks in Vol. XLIII, p. 56.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2393"></A><A HREF="kj174.htm#fr_2398">417:10</A> This Song is not comprehensible except by reference to the text of the "Chronicles," whose author gives a somewhat varying version of the story. He tells us that, as a support to the infirm old lady, the Emperor had a string or rope stretched as a sort of hand-rest along the way she was obliged to pass in order to reach the Imperial apartments, and that at the end of the rope was a bell whose tinkling notified the Emperor of her approach. The conjectural exclamation which <A HREF="errata.htm#119">closes</A> the little poem has therefore an obvious sense, which would be wanting if the bell were at the other end, as in the version here given; for the Emperor would not give expression to surprise at her approach, if he had himself just rung for her to come.&#8212;"Far-distant" is an imperfect attempt to represent the Pillow-Word <i>momo-dzutafu</i>, which here alludes to the stages <a name="page_419"><font size="1" color="green">p. 419</font></A> along which the old woman may be supposed to be travelling. The valley and the moor overgrown with short grass form an allusion to the way,&#8212;long and arduous for her,&#8212;which Oki-me had to traverse to reach the Imperial. apartments, and they contain possibly a further allusion to her <A HREF="errata.htm#120">original</A> journey to the capital.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2394"></A><A HREF="kj174.htm#fr_2399">417:11</A> The meaning of this Song is quite clear.&#8212;The second time the name Oki-me occurs, it might, instead of being as here taken as an exclamation, be made the subject of the sentence, thus: "Oki-me from Afumi will by to-morrow, etc." The words "wilt [thou]," which represent <i>ka</i> of the original Japanese may be taken either as an exclamation properly so-called, or as a sort of rhetorical interrogation whose force is simply exclamatory. The meaning comes to the same in either case, and is literally rendered by the same English words; but according to the latter view, we should have to replace the point of exclamation by a point of interrogation.</P>
