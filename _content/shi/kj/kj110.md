### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1810"></span>[298:1](kj110.htm#fr_1815) <span
id="page_298">p. 298</span> The Emperor Chiū-ai. The author of these
"Records "not recognizing, <span id="page_299">p. 299</span> as does the
author of the "Chronicles," the time during which the Empress Jin-gō
held sway as a separate reign, Chiū-ai is by fiction supposed to have
reigned down to the moment his posthumous son Ō-jin mounted the throne
after the conquest of Korea and of Yamato.

<span id="fn_1811"></span>[298:2](kj110.htm#fr_1816) *I.e.* "long
branch," or perhaps "long inlet.

<span id="fn_1812"></span>[298:3](kj110.htm#fr_1817) Etymology obscure.

<span id="fn_1813"></span>[298:4](kj110.htm#fr_1818) Mabuchi and
Motowori seem right in supposing the sentence in small type to be an
addition to the text, copied from the "Chronicles." But as all the MSS.
and printed editions previous to Motowori's contain it, it has been
retained in the translation.
