<p>Forthwith making a progress to the residence of Queen Wakakusaka-be the Heavenly Sovereign sent the dog as a message, saying: "This thing is a strange thing which I got to day on the road. So it is a thing to woo with,"&#8212;and so saying, sent it in as a present. Thereupon Queen Waka-kusaka-be sent to say to the Heavenly Sovereign: "It is very alarming that thou shouldst make a progress with thy back to the sun.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2312"></A><A HREF="#fn_2307"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> So I will come up straight [to the capital], and respectfully</p>

<p>serve thee."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2313"></A><A HREF="#fn_2308"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> When therefore he returned up and dwelt in the palace, he went and stood on the ascent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2314"></A><A HREF="#fn_2309"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of that mountain, and sang, saying:</p>  
<p><small>"In the hollow between the nearer and the further mountain, this Mount Kusakabe and Mount Heguri, [is] growing the flourishing broad-leafed boar-oak; at the base grow intertwining bamboos; on the top grow luxuriant bamboos:&#8212;we sleep not [now] intertwined like the intertwining bamboos, we sleep not certainly like the luxuriant bamboos: [but] oh! my beloved [313] spouse, with whom [I] shall afterwards sleep intertwined!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2315"></A><A HREF="#fn_2310"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></small></p>  
<p>And he forthwith sent back a messenger with this Song.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2316"></A><A HREF="#fn_2311"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_2308"></A><A HREF="kj160.htm#fr_2313">391:2</A> The meaning is: "Thy Majesty must not come to woo me here, as the direction is unlucky. But I will myself come up straightway to the palace to be "thine Empress."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2309"></A><A HREF="kj160.htm#fr_2314">391:3</A> The ascent or way up here mentioned is, says Motowori, the Tadagoye Road, and the mountain is Mount Kusaka. See Sect. CLII, Notes 2 and 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2310"></A><A HREF="kj160.htm#fr_2315">391:4</A> In this Song the Emperor consoles himself for the delay in his union with Princess Waka-kusaka-be by reflecting that after all she will soon be his.&#8212;The first half of the poem down to the colon and dash is a Preface to the rest. Most of the difficult words occurring in it have been explained in previous notes; for the "broad-leafed bear-oak "see Sect. LXXII, Note, 19; for <i>tatami-komo</i>, the Pillow-Word by which Heguri is preceded in the Japanese text, see Sect. LXXXIX, Note 12. <i>Kusaka-be</i> is curious, for whereas it properly signifies Kusaka-Tribe,&#8212;this tribe or family being called after the place where they resided,&#8212;the place itself came to be renamed after them when the fact of the posterior origin of the family designation had been forgotten. The reason (or the <a name="page_392"><font size="1" color="green">p. 392</font></A> mention in the Preface of the oak-tree, which is not referred to in the main text of the poem, is difficult to ascertain. Moribe thinks, however that it is on account of the luxuriance of its foliage which, as if it were a Preface within the Preface, paves the way for the mention of the thick-growing bamboos. The punning connection between <i>tashinu-dake</i>, "luxuriant bamboos," and <i>tashi ni ha wi-nezu</i>, "we sleep not certainly," is necessarily obliterated in the English translation. "Certainly" must be taken in the sense of "undisturbedly."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2311"></A><A HREF="kj160.htm#fr_2316">391:5</A> <i>I.e.</i>, as may be conjectured, a messenger dispatched to him by his mistress. It seems best to suppose the author to represent the Emperor as not having actually gone to her house at all, but as having only communicated with her by messenger.</P>
