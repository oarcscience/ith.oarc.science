## \[SECT. CXXXVIII.—EMPEROR IN-GIYŌ (PART II.—HIS SICKNESS IS CURED BY A KOREAN PHYSICIAN).\]

The Heavenly Sovereign, when first about to rule the succession of
Heaven's Sun, <span id="fr_2205"></span>[1a](#fn_2200) declined, saying:
"I have a long sickness; I cannot rule the sun's succession."
Nevertheless, as from the Empress downwards all the magnates strongly
urged him, he forthwith ruled the Empire. At this time the ruler of
Shiragi <span id="fr_2206"></span>[2a](#fn_2201) dutifully sent
eighty-one vessels with august tribute. Then the chief envoy <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[3](#fn_2202) sent with the august tribute, whose
name was Komu-ha-chimu-kamu-ki-mu, <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[4](#fn_2203) was a man deeply versed in the medical
art. So he cured the Heavenly Sovereign's august sickness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2200"></span>[367:1a](kj145.htm#fr_2205) <span
id="page_367">p. 367</span> For this expression see Sect. XXXIII, Note
27. The story of the refusal of this monarch to accept the crown which
was offered to him by the magnates of the nation is told at considerable
length in the parallel passage of the "Chronicles." According to the
same authority he belonged to a collateral branch of the Imperial
family, and was therefore not in the regular line of succession.
