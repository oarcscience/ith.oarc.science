## \[SECT. XI.—INVESTITURE OF THE THREE DEITIES; THE ILLUSTRIOUS AUGUST CHILDREN.\]

At this time His Augustness the Male-Who-Invites greatly rejoiced,
saying; "I, begetting child after child, have at my final begetting
gotten. three illustrious children," \[with which words,\] at once
jinglingly taking off and shaking the jewel-string <span
id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_303) forming his august necklace, he bestowed
it on the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity, saying: "Do Thine
Augustness rule the Plain-of-High-Heaven." With this charge he bestowed
it on her. Now the name of this august necklace was the
August-Store-house-Shelf-Deity. <span id="fr_307"></span>[2](#fn_304)
Next he said of His Augustness Moon-Night-Possessor: "Do Thine
Augustness rule the Dominion of the "Night." <span
id="fr_308"></span>[3](#fn_305) Thus he charged him. Next he said to
His-Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness: "Do Thine Augustness rule the
Sea-Plain." <span id="fr_309"></span>[4](#fn_306)

the goddess on a shelf in her store-house.
