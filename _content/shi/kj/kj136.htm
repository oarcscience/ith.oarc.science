<p>In this august reign there was a tall tree on the west of the river Tsuki.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2129"></A><A HREF="#fn_2124"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The shadow of this tree, on its being struck by the morning sun, reached to the Island of Ahaji:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2130"></A><A HREF="#fn_2125"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and on its being struck by the evening sun, it crossed Mount Takayasu.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2131"></A><A HREF="#fn_2126"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> So the tree was cut down and made into a vessel, and a very swift-going vessel it was. At the time, this vessel was called by the name of Karanu.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2132"></A><A HREF="#fn_2127"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> So with this vessel the water of the Island of Ahaji was drawn morning and evening, and presented as the great august water.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2133"></A><A HREF="#fn_2128"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> The broken [pieces] of this vessel were used [as fuel] to burn salt and the pieces of wood that remained over from the burning were made into a lute, whose sound re-echoed seven miles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2134"></A><A HREF="#fn_2129"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> [off]. So [some one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2135"></A><A HREF="#fn_2130"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>] sang, saying:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Karanu was burnt [as fuel] for salt; the remainder was made into a lute; oh! when struck, it sounds like the wet plants standing rocked on the reefs in the middle of the harbour, the harbour of Yura."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2136"></A><A HREF="#fn_2131"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></div></p>  
<p>This is a Changing Song which is a Quiet song.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2137"></A><A HREF="#fn_2132"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> [285]</p>

<IMG SRC="img/35600.jpg">, the Chinese <i>li</i> Japanese <i>ri</i>. The length of the <i>ri</i> has varied greatly at different times and in different parts of the country. The modern standard Japanese <i>ri</i> is equivalent to about 2.44 English statute miles: but Motowori supposes the <i>ri</i> of the epoch mentioned in our text to have been less than one-seventh of that distance.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2130"></A><A HREF="kj136.htm#fr_2135">355:7</A> In the "Chronicles" this story is placed in the reign of the Emperor &#332;-jin, and the Song is attributed to that monarch.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2131"></A><A HREF="kj136.htm#fr_2136">355:8</A> In this Song the sound of the twanging of the lute that had been made from the remnant of the boat Karanu is compared to the rustling of the plants standing half out of water on the reefs in the harbour of Yura.&#8212;The compound word <i>kaki-hiku</i>, rendered by "struck," signifies literally "scratched and struck," the lute being struck with the nail. The onomatopoetic word <i>saya-saya</i>, of which "sound" is but a colourless equivalent, represents both the delightful ring of the lute and the rustling of the sea-plants. What plants are intended by the expression "wet plants" (<i>nadzu no ki</i>) is a point that has been much disputed. Moribe even thinks that the term is meant for the name of a particular species of (apparently) coral now found in the island of Hachijo. Yura is in the Island of Ahaji.</P>
