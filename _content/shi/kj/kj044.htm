<p>Hereupon His Augustness Heaven's-Sun-Height-Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty met a beautiful person at the august cape of Kasasa, and asked her whose daughter she was. She replied, saying: "I am a daughter of the Deity-Great-Mountain-Possessor,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_779"></A><A HREF="#fn_775"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and my name is the Divine-Princess-of-Ata,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_780"></A><A HREF="#fn_776"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> another name by which I am called being Princess-Blossoming-Brilliantly-Like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_781"></A><A HREF="#fn_777"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Again he asked: "Hast thou</p>

<p>any brethren?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_778"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> She replied, saying: "There is my elder sister, Princess-Long-as-the-Rocks."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_783"></A><A HREF="#fn_779"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Then he charged her, [saying]: "Ego sum cupidus coiendi tecum. Tibi quomodo videtur?" She replied, saying: "I&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_780"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> am not able to say. My father the Deity Great-Mountain-Possessor will say." So he sent a request [for her] to her father the Deity Great-Mountain-Possessor, who, greatly delighted, respectfully sent her off, joining to her&nbsp;her [116] elder sister Princess Long-as-the-Rocks, and causing merchandise to be carried on tables holding an hundred.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_781"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> So then, owing to the elder sister being very hideous, [His Augustness Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty] was alarmed at the sight of her, and sent her back, only keeping the younger sister Princess-Blossoming-Brilliantly-Like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees, whom he wedded for one night. Then the Deity-Great-Mountain-Possessor was covered with shame at Princess Long-as-the-Rocks being sent back, and sent a message [to His Augustness Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty], saying: "My reason for respectfully presenting both my daughters together was that, by sending Princess-Long-as-the-Rocks, the august offspring&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_786"></A><A HREF="#fn_782"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> of the Heavenly Deity,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_783"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> though the snow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_788"></A><A HREF="#fn_784"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> fall and the wind blow, might live eternally immovable like unto the enduring rocks, and again that by sending Princess-Blossoming-Brilliantly-Like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees, [they] might live flourishingly like unto the flowering of the blossoms of the trees: to insure this,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_789"></A><A HREF="#fn_785"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> I offered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_790"></A><A HREF="#fn_786"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> them. But owing to thy thus sending back&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_791"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> Princess Long-as-the-Rocks, and keeping only Princess-Blossoming-Brilliantly-Like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees, the august offspring of the Heavenly Deity shall be but as frail&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_792"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> as the flowers of the trees. So it is for this [117]</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_777"></A><A HREF="kj044.htm#fr_781">140:3</A> Or "Tree." <i>Ka-no-hama-saku-ya-hime</i>. Perhaps (though there is no native authority for doing so) we might rather understand <i>saku</i> as a Causative in intention, though not in form, and render the name thus: "Princess-Causing-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees-to-Blossom." The tree alluded to is doubtless the cherry. This deity is now worshipped as the goddess of Mount Fuzhi (Fusiyama), and in common parlance the last member of the compound forming her name does not receive the <i>nigori</i>,&#8212;<i>hime</i> instead of <i>bime</i>. The syllable <i>ya</i> has no signification in this and similar names. It will be remembered that there was another sister named "Princess-Falling-like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees. (See Sect. XX, Note 5).</P>

<IMG SRC="img/14202.jpg">)is employed in the text; but it here almost certainly has, as Motowori suggests, a more extended meaning, and signifies the posterity of the Sun-Goddess or of Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty generally, <i>i.e.</i> the Emperors of Japan. The vaguer term "offspring "is therefore nearer to the author's intention.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_783"></A><A HREF="kj044.htm#fr_787">141:9</A> <i>I.e.</i>, either of the Sun-Goddess or of Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty, There is no difference in the sense, whichever of these two deities we take the speaker to refer to.

The parallel passage in the "Chronicles "is <A NAME="img_14300"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/14300.jpg">, <i>i.e.</i> "fading and falling like the flowers of the trees."</P>

<IMG SRC="img/14301.jpg">, a common Japanese designation of the Emperor. It would, especially in the later volumes of this work where the expression is repeated on almost every page, be more convenient to translate by the single word "Emperor." But the commentators lay great stress on the high significance of the component portions of the title, which, they contend, was not borrowed from China, but was first used in Japan. It is first met with in Chinese history in the middle of the seventh century of our era, just early enough indeed for it to have been borrowed before the time of the compilation of these "Records." But as there was no difficulty in putting together the two component parts "Heavenly, Sovereign," it is possible that the contention of the Japanese commentators is correct. The ancient pure native term seems to have been <i>Sumera-mikoto</i>, for which Mr. Satow has proposed the rendering of "Sovereign Augustness."</P>
