of Yamato were established; again, the Pool of Sakate was made, and
bamboos planted on the bank. <span id="fr_1564"></span>[3](#fn_1560)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1558"></span>[254:1a](kj085.htm#fr_1562) <span
id="page_254">p. 254</span> Such is the reasonable explanation of the
original term *tabe* (<span id="img_25400"></span> ![](img/25400.jpg))
given by Motowori. It seems to have become a "gentile-name."

<span id="fn_1559"></span>[254:2](kj085.htm#fr_1563) *Kashikade no
oho-tomo-be*. This "gentile name" originally denoted one who was butler,
steward, or cook, in the Emperor's household. The tradition of its
origin is preserved in the "Chronicles."

<span id="fn_1560"></span>[254:3](kj085.htm#fr_1564) Motowori supposes
that the mention both in his history and in the "Chronicles of Japan" of
the planting of bamboos on the banks of this pool or lake should be
attributed to the rarity of such a proceeding in ancient times.
