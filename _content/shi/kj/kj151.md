## \[SECT. CXLIV.—EMPEROR AN-KŌ (PART I.—HE SLAYS KING OHO-KUSAKA).\]

The august child <span id="fr_2247"></span>[1](#fn_2242) Anaho dwelt at
the palace of Anaho at Isonokami, <span
id="fr_2248"></span>[2](#fn_2243) and ruled the Empire. The Heavenly
Sovereign sent the Grandee of Ne, <span
id="fr_2249"></span>[3](#fn_2244) ancestor of the Grandees of Sakamoto,
to the residence of King Oho-kusaka, on behalf of his younger brother
Prince Oho-hatsuse to command thus: "I wish Thine Augustness's younger
sister

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Queen Waka-kusaka
to wed Prince Oho-hatsuse. So do thou present her." <span
id="fr_2250"></span>[4](#fn_2245) Then King Oho-kusaka did obeisance
four times, and said: "Owing to a supposition that there might be some
such Great Commands, I have kept her always indoor. <span
id="fr_2251"></span>[5](#fn_2246) With reverence <span
id="fr_2252"></span>[6](#fn_2247) will I respectfully offer her
according to the Great Commands." Nevertheless, thinking it
disrespectful \[merely\] to send a message, <span
id="fr_2253"></span>[7](#fn_2248) he forthwith, as a ceremonial
gift <span id="fr_2254"></span>[8](#fn_2249) from his younger sister,
made \[the Grandee of Ne\] take a pushwood jewel head-dress <span
id="fr_2255"></span>[9](#fn_2250) to present \[to the Heavenly
Sovereign\]. The Grandee of Ne forthwith stole the jewel headdress meant
as a ceremonial gift, and slandered King Oho-kusaka, saying: "King
Oho-kusaka would not receive the Imperial Commands, but said: "An soror
mea fiet ejusdem stirpis \[viri\] inferior storea?" <span
id="fr_2256"></span>[10](#fn_2251) and, grasping the hilt of his
cross-sword, <span id="fr_2257"></span>[11](#fn_2252) was angry." So the
Heavenly Sovereign, having in his great anger slain King Oho-kusaka,
took that King's chief wife Nagata-no-oho-iratsume, <span
id="fr_2258"></span>[12](#fn_2253) and made her Empress.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2242"></span>[378:1](kj151.htm#fr_2247) *I.e.*, Prince. In
all other cases we find the word *mikoto*, "Augustness," as the title by
which the Sovereign is mentioned at the commencement of his reign.

<span id="fn_2243"></span>[378:2](kj151.htm#fr_2248) See Sect. XLV, Note
16.

<span id="fn_2244"></span>[378:3](kj151.htm#fr_2249) *Ne no omi*. The
etymology of *ne* is obscure.

<span id="fn_2245"></span>[379:4](kj151.htm#fr_2250) Literally, as
"tribute."

<span id="fn_2246"></span>[379:5](kj151.htm#fr_2251) More literally, "I
have kept her without putting her out of doors."

<span id="fn_2247"></span>[379:6](kj151.htm#fr_2252) *Conf*. Sect. IX,
Note 4 and Sect. XVIII, Note 14.

<span id="fn_2248"></span>[379:7](kj151.htm#fr_2253) Motowori surmises
that <span id="img_37900"></span> ![](img/37900.jpg) may be an error for
<span id="img_37901"></span> ![](img/37901.jpg) in the original of this
clause <span id="img_37902"></span> ![](img/37902.jpg).

<span id="fn_2249"></span>[379:8](kj151.htm#fr_2254) <span
id="img_37903"></span> ![](img/37903.jpg). This term corresponds to the
modern <span id="img_37904"></span> ![](img/37904.jpg), the name by
which the presents which are exchanged at the time of betrothal are
designated.

<span id="fn_2250"></span>[379:9](kj151.htm#fr_2255) <span
id="page_380">p. 380</span> The original term *oshi-ki no tam-akadzura*
is extremely obscure. One of Motowori s conjectures is that the
"push-wood" was a kind of frame by which the jewels or beads, strung on
an erect stem of same hard material, were kept firmly attached to the
head. Perhaps some notion of the *coiffure* intended may be gathered
from the plate opposite p. 354 of Part III of Vol. VIII of these
"Transactions" (Mr. J. Condor's paper on "The History of
[Japanese](errata.htm#91) Costume

<span id="fn_2251"></span>[379:10](kj151.htm#fr_2256) *I.e.*, "An soror
mea, cujus pater Imperator Nin-toku, fiet uxor præsentis Imperatoris?
"—Hujus similitudinis rusticitas et ipsis Japonicis commentatoribus
pudori est.

<span id="fn_2252"></span>[379:11](kj151.htm#fr_2257) See Sect. XLV,
Note 5.

<span id="fn_2253"></span>[379:12](kj151.htm#fr_2258) See Sect. CXXXVII,
Note 5.
