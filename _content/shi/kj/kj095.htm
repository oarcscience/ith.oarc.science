<p>Hereupon he said: "As for the Deity of this mountain, I will simply take him empty-handed."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1633"></A><A HREF="#fn_1629"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#8212;and was ascending the mountain, when there met him on the mountain-side a white boar whose size was like unto that of a bull.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1634"></A><A HREF="#fn_1630"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Then he lifted up words,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1635"></A><A HREF="#fn_1631"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and said: "This creature that is transformed into a white boar must be a messenger from the Deity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1636"></A><A HREF="#fn_1632"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Though I slay it not now, I will slay it when I return,"&#8212;and [so saying.] ascended. Thereupon the Deity caused heavy ice-rain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1637"></A><A HREF="#fn_1633"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> to fall, striking and perplexing His Augustness Yamato-take. (<small>This creature transformed into a white boar was not a messenger from the Deity,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1638"></A><A HREF="#fn_1634"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> but the very Deity in person. Owing to the lifting up of words, he appeared and misled [Yamato-take.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1639"></A><A HREF="#fn_1634"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>])</small> So when, on descending back, he reached the fresh spring of Tama-kuro-be&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1640"></A><A HREF="#fn_1635"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and rested there, his august heart awoke somewhat.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1641"></A><A HREF="#fn_1636"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> So that fresh spring is called by the name of the fresh spring of Wi-same.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1629"></A><A HREF="kj095.htm#fr_1633">269:1</A> <a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="green">p. 269</font></A> <i>I.e.</i>, without weapons, and specially without the magic sword which he had left behind in Princess Miyazu's house.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1630"></A><A HREF="kj095.htm#fr_1634">269:2</A> Or "ox," or "cow," the original word not distinguishing between the sexes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1631"></A><A HREF="kj095.htm#fr_1635">269:3</A> <a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 270</font></A> The Japanese expression <i>kota-age shite</i>, here rendered "lifted up. words," very frequently has the signification of "lifting up a prayer" to some superhuman being. In this passage, however, it conveys no more than its proper etymological meaning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1632"></A><A HREF="kj095.htm#fr_1636">269:4</A> Viz., the god of Mount Ibuki.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1633"></A><A HREF="kj095.htm#fr_1637">269:5</A> Perhaps "hail" may be intended by this expression, and so Motowori decides. But this interpretation of the term seems to agree well with the Song in Sect. CXLII.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1634"></A><A HREF="kj095.htm#fr_1639">269:6</A> The commentators disagree as to whether this note should or should not be considered to form part of the original text. Motowori so considers it. He however, in the opinion of the translator, is not happy in his alteration of the <i>kana</i> reading given by the editor of 1687, which latter has accordingly been followed in the English version.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1635"></A><A HREF="kj095.htm#fr_1640">269:7</A> The literal meaning of this name is "jewel-store-tribe;" but complete uncertainty attaches both to the etymology of the word and to the position of the place. The first printed edition has <i>Tama-kuhi-be</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1636"></A><A HREF="kj095.htm#fr_1641">269:8</A> He had been misled and dazed, but now came to himself again. Thence, according to the etymology of our author, the name of <i>Wi-same</i>, which signifies "dwelling (resting) and awaking," given to the spring.</P>
