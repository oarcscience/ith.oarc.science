<p>When, forthwith crossing over from that land out into Kahi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1621"></A><A HREF="#fn_1617"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he dwelt in the palace of Sakawori,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1622"></A><A HREF="#fn_1618"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he sang, saying:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"How many nights have I slept since passing Nihibari and Tsukuha?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1623"></A><A HREF="#fn_1619"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></div></p>

<p>Then the old man, who was the lighter of the august fire,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1624"></A><A HREF="#fn_1620"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> completed the august Song, and sang, saying:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Oh! having put the days in a row, there are of nights nine nights, and of days ten days!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1625"></A><A HREF="#fn_1621"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></div></p>  
<p>Therefore [Yamato-take] praised the old man, and forthwith bestowed [on him] the Rulership of the Eastern Land[s].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1626"></A><A HREF="#fn_1622"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1617"></A><A HREF="kj093.htm#fr_1621">265:1</A> <a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="green">p. 266</font></A> This name is identified by the native etymology with an homonymous Substantive signifying "a place between mountains."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1618"></A><A HREF="kj093.htm#fr_1622">265:2</A> The etymology of this name is uncertain. But the most likely opinion is that it signifies "a zigzag road down a pass."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1619"></A><A HREF="kj093.htm#fr_1623">265:3</A> <i>I.e.</i>, since leaving the province of Hitachi, of which Tsukuha (in modern parlance <i>Tsukuba</i>, with the last syllable <i>nigori</i>&#8217;ed) and Nihibari (modern <i>Nihiharu</i>) are two districts. In the later poetry <i>Nibari no</i> is often used as a Pillow-Word for the name of Mount Tsukuba. The etymology of both names is uncertain, but "newly tilled "seems to be the most probable etymology of the first of the two.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1620"></A><A HREF="kj093.htm#fr_1624">266:4</A> Not necessarily a fire kindled for the sake of obtaining warmth, but fire in general, including, as Motowori suggests, torches and fires lit to drive away mosquitoes. There are frequent mentions in the classical literature of this latter sort of fire, which may indeed still be met with in some districts where mosquito-nets are not yet in common use.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1621"></A><A HREF="kj093.htm#fr_1625">266:5</A> The meaning is: "On counting up, I find that we have been ten days and nine nights."&#8212;Previous to Motowori the expression <i>ka-ga nabette</i>, "having put in a row (<i>i.e.</i> counted) the days" was curiously misunderstood, and subjected to various far-fetched interpretations. There can however be no doubt but that Motowori is right.&#8212;The reason why the old man is said to have "completed "the Prince's song is that the former taken alone is of incomplete rhythm.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1622"></A><A HREF="kj093.htm#fr_1626">266:6</A> Or, as Motowori would prefer to <A HREF="errata.htm#54">consider</A> it, "the Rulership of an Eastern Land," viz., one out of the twelve Eastern provinces.</P>
