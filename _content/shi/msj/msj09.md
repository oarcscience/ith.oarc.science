### A MOTHER'S FAREWELL TO HER SON

<span class="smallcaps">Departing from Naniha on a Mission to
China</span>

E’en as the hart, who ardent woos his mate  
When the bush-clover opens purple blooms,  
Hath one son only, even thus am I  
Mother of only one, who even now  
On a far journey fares, in a strange land,  
With but, perchance, grass-pillow for his head.  
Wherefore close-threaded beads of bamboo rings  
And brimming jars of saké I set forth,  
And shining yufu cloths, before the shrine,  
Praying the mighty God, with humble prayers,  
To bring my loved one safely home to me!

### A LAMENT

(From the "Manyôshiu")

In the upper reaches of the river,  
Hatsusé's secluded upper reaches,  
Dive the eager cormorants, respondent  
To the will and bidding of their keepers.  
In the lower waters cormorants diving  
Many shining fishes let to swallow.

Fair and bright was she who now is lying,  
Parted from me, a full bow-shot, lying,  
And my heart is burdened down with sorrow,  
Full of thoughts of her and full of sorrow.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

Rudely torn may be a hempen mantle,  
Yet a skilful hand may join it fitly;  
Snapped may be the string where pearls are threaded,  
Yet the thread all swiftly be re-knotted;  
But, my dear one, you and I once parted  
Never more may meet—ah! nevermore!

### A LAY OF COMPLAINT

<span class="smallcaps">By the Lady Sakanohe no Isatsune</span>

My Lord had vowed that with deep constancy  
Firm-rooted as the sturdy sedge that grow  
In the clear pools of Naniha—so he  
Would love and guard me through the golden years.  
I gave my heart to him (ah! foolish heart!  
Yet stainless as a mirror's burnished face)—  
Into his keeping, and on him I leaned,  
Trusting in him, as sailor in his ship  
Nor, as the drifting seaweed to and fro,  
Backwards and forwards in the swirling tides,  
Has my love wavered from that very hour!  
Yet now, perchance, the mighty gods have willed  
To part us twain. Or is it evil words  
Of envious mortals? For he comes no more,  
My Lord who came so often! neither sends  
White-wanded messenger to tell me why.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

From the red dawn until the dense night falls,  
And all the hours of darkness through I weep  
Hopeless and helpless. Plain for all to see  
My misery, and weeping like a babe,  
I wander forth, nor waiting, dare to hope  
For word or message from the one I love!

### DROWNED

(Lay 194 from the "Manyôshiu")

No bird-songs at dawn-breaking, sound by the lonely sea,  
   Where sleeps he, never waking;  
Behind him, faintly looming, the solemn mountains lie;  
   Before him, waves dull booming.  
On shining seaweed pillow, he rests on pebbly shore,  
   Drenched by each wind-tossed billow.  
Not even mantle closing, with wings of dragon-fly,  
   Around his form reposing.  
All lone he lies, as sleeping forgetful of the world,  
   Of laughter or of weeping.  
Once loved him—Father, Mother, haply young wife and fair  
   Loved him above all other.  
But never word of greeting, from him to them shall pass,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

   Nevermore place of meeting!  
Vainly a message seeking, homeplace and name tell not  
   Lips like a babe's unspeaking.  
Piteous the sight, heart-rending, but such the world's sad way,  
   All things to silence tending

### TO A LADY CROSSING A BRIDGE ALONE

(From the "Manyôshiu")

Fair lady, tripping o’er yon bridge,  
Spanning the foaming river's bed,  
Who, scarlet-robed with mantle blue,  
Crosses the lacquered arch of red—  
I wonder, as I watch your form  
All unattended and alone,  
If in your homeplace gallant spouse  
Claims your sweet beauty as his own;  
Or if like single acorn, still  
Unmated and forlorn you pine!  
And nameless still, and still unknown,  
Your name and dwelling would divine.

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

### IN AZUMA <span id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1)

(From the "Manyôshiu"—8th Century)

       In Azuma  
To grace the Imperial Reign  
     All gold the flowers grow  
       In Azuma.  
On all the heights of Michinoku glow  
     The glittering blooms.  
   Imperial eyes might deign  
To glance upon the precious flowers that grow  
       In Azuma!

### A WISH

(From the "Manyôshiu")

<span class="smallcaps">By Prince Aki</span>, A.D. 740

  On Isé's sea  
The white foam-blossoms play.  
  Would they were blooms  
From out whose fair array  
  Choosing the best  
I might select a spray  
  For her I love!

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

### THE MOON'S VOYAGE

<span class="smallcaps">By Prince Aki</span>

The Moon is a barque on the sea of the skies,  
Where stormy and grey the cloud-billows arise,  
Nor tempest, nor calm, her serenity mars  
As she glides on her way to the groves of the stars!

### WILLOWS

     Now ere the rough caress  
Of the Spring breeze has tangled carelessly  
The young green willows' slender silken threads,  
Now would I show them in their fresh young grace  
            Unto my love!

### BLOSSOM-TIME

Not yet is past the cherry's blossom-time;  
  Yet should the petals fall,  
*Now*, while their beauty's moon is at the full,  
And all the love of those who gaze on them  
         Is at its zenith—

### SUGIWARA NO MICHIZANE—TENJIN

<span class="small">A great minister and scholar; after holding high
office, was banished as Governor of Kyūshū, and died in A.D. 903. His
death was said to have been followed by evil portents and disasters to
his foes. He is worshipped as a God of Calligraphy—and plum-trees are
planted near his temple, his crest being plum-blossom.</span>

### THE OFFERING

<span class="smallcaps">By Sugiwara no Michizane</span>

I carry to the Shrine no offering  
     This Autumn day,  
Fairer than any gift that I could bring,  
     The rich display  
Of gold and crimson on Tamuke's side.  
The gods can revel in the maples' pride!

### SPRING SHOWERS

<span class="smallcaps">By Fujiwara Toshiyuki</span>

Through flow’ring branches  
Pour the sudden showers,  
Warm showers through branches  
Sweetly blossoming.  
What if they soak me,  
So the glistening flowers  
Let me partake  
Their fragrance of the Spring!
