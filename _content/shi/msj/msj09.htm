<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Departing from Naniha on a Mission to China</span></p>  
<p>E&#8217;en as the hart, who ardent woos his mate<br> When the bush-clover opens purple blooms,<br> Hath one son only, even thus am I<br> Mother of only one, who even now<br> On a far journey fares, in a strange land,<br> With but, perchance, grass-pillow for his head.<br> Wherefore close-threaded beads of bamboo rings<br> And brimming jars of sak&eacute; I set forth,<br> And shining yufu cloths, before the shrine,<br> Praying the mighty God, with humble prayers,<br> To bring my loved one safely home to me!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">A LAMENT</h3>  
<p align="center">(From the "Many&ocirc;shiu")</p>  
<p>In the upper reaches of the river,<br> Hatsus&eacute;'s secluded upper reaches,<br> Dive the eager cormorants, respondent<br> To the will and bidding of their keepers.<br> In the lower waters cormorants diving<br> Many shining fishes let to swallow.</p>  
<p>Fair and bright was she who now is lying,<br> Parted from me, a full bow-shot, lying,<br> And my heart is burdened down with sorrow,<br> Full of thoughts of her and full of sorrow.</p>  
<p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></A></p>  
<p>Rudely torn may be a hempen mantle,<br> Yet a skilful hand may join it fitly;<br> Snapped may be the string where pearls are threaded,<br> Yet the thread all swiftly be re-knotted;<br> But, my dear one, you and I once parted<br> Never more may meet&#8212;ah! nevermore!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">A LAY OF COMPLAINT</h3>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By the Lady Sakanohe no Isatsune</span></p>  
<p>My Lord had vowed that with deep constancy<br> Firm-rooted as the sturdy sedge that grow<br> In the clear pools of Naniha&#8212;so he<br> Would love and guard me through the golden years.<br> I gave my heart to him (ah! foolish heart!<br> Yet stainless as a mirror's burnished face)&#8212;<br> Into his keeping, and on him I leaned,<br> Trusting in him, as sailor in his ship<br> Nor, as the drifting seaweed to and fro,<br> Backwards and forwards in the swirling tides,<br> Has my love wavered from that very hour!<br> Yet now, perchance, the mighty gods have willed<br> To part us twain. Or is it evil words<br> Of envious mortals? For he comes no more,<br> My Lord who came so often! neither sends<br> White-wanded messenger to tell me why.</p>  
<p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></A></p>  
<p>From the red dawn until the dense night falls,<br> And all the hours of darkness through I weep<br> Hopeless and helpless. Plain for all to see<br> My misery, and weeping like a babe,<br> I wander forth, nor waiting, dare to hope<br> For word or message from the one I love!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">DROWNED</h3>  
<p align="center">(Lay 194 from the "Many&ocirc;shiu")</p>  
<p>No bird-songs at dawn-breaking, sound by the lonely sea,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where sleeps he, never waking;<br> Behind him, faintly looming, the solemn mountains lie;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before him, waves dull booming.<br> On shining seaweed pillow, he rests on pebbly shore,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drenched by each wind-tossed billow.<br> Not even mantle closing, with wings of dragon-fly,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around his form reposing.<br> All lone he lies, as sleeping forgetful of the world,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of laughter or of weeping.<br> Once loved him&#8212;Father, Mother, haply young wife and fair<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved him above all other.<br> But never word of greeting, from him to them shall pass,</p>  
<p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevermore place of meeting!<br> Vainly a message seeking, homeplace and name tell not<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lips like a babe's unspeaking.<br> Piteous the sight, heart-rending, but such the world's sad way,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things to silence tending</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">TO A LADY CROSSING A BRIDGE ALONE</h3>  
<p align="center">(From the "Many&ocirc;shiu")</p>  
<p>Fair lady, tripping o&#8217;er yon bridge,<br> Spanning the foaming river's bed,<br> Who, scarlet-robed with mantle blue,<br> Crosses the lacquered arch of red&#8212;<br> I wonder, as I watch your form<br> All unattended and alone,<br> If in your homeplace gallant spouse<br> Claims your sweet beauty as his own;<br> Or if like single acorn, still<br> Unmated and forlorn you pine!<br> And nameless still, and still unknown,<br> Your name and dwelling would divine.</p>

<p align="center">(From the "Many&ocirc;shiu"&#8212;8th Century)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Azuma<br> To grace the Imperial Reign<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All gold the flowers grow<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Azuma.<br> On all the heights of Michinoku glow<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glittering blooms.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial eyes might deign<br> To glance upon the precious flowers that grow<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Azuma!</p>

</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">A WISH</h3>  
<p align="center">(From the "Many&ocirc;shiu")</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Prince Aki</span>, A.D. 740</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Is&eacute;'s sea<br> The white foam-blossoms play.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Would they were blooms<br> From out whose fair array<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing the best<br> I might select a spray<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For her I love!</p>

<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Prince Aki</span></p>  
<p>The Moon is a barque on the sea of the skies,<br> Where stormy and grey the cloud-billows arise,<br> Nor tempest, nor calm, her serenity mars<br> As she glides on her way to the groves of the stars!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">WILLOWS</h3>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now ere the rough caress<br> Of the Spring breeze has tangled carelessly<br> The young green willows' slender silken threads,<br> Now would I show them in their fresh young grace<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto my love!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">BLOSSOM-TIME</h3>  
<p>Not yet is past the cherry's blossom-time;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet should the petals fall,<br> <i>Now</i>, while their beauty's moon is at the full,<br> And all the love of those who gaze on them<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is at its zenith&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">SUGIWARA NO MICHIZANE&#8212;TENJIN</h3>  
<p><small>A great minister and scholar; after holding high office, was banished as Governor of Ky&#363;sh&#363;, and died in A.D. 903. His death was said to have been followed by evil portents and disasters to his foes. He is worshipped as a God of Calligraphy&#8212;and plum-trees are planted near his temple, his crest being plum-blossom.</small></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE OFFERING</h3>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Sugiwara no Michizane</span></p>  
<p>I carry to the Shrine no offering<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Autumn day,<br> Fairer than any gift that I could bring,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich display<br> Of gold and crimson on Tamuke's side.<br> The gods can revel in the maples' pride!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">SPRING SHOWERS</h3>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Fujiwara Toshiyuki</span></p>  
<p>Through flow&#8217;ring branches<br> Pour the sudden showers,<br> Warm showers through branches<br> Sweetly blossoming.<br> What if they soak me,<br> So the glistening flowers<br> Let me partake<br> Their fragrance of the Spring!</p>
