### KINO TSURAYUKI

<span class="smallcaps">The Poet, and Editor of the "Kokinshiu"</span>

He was a Court noble, and of royal descent; he died in A.D. 946. His
preface to the "Kokinshiu" is full of poetic thoughts and bas much
beauty of style. One of its passages runs as follows: "The Poetry of
Yamato has the human heart for its seed, and grows therefrom into the
manifold forms of speech." For further extracts see W. G. Aston's
"History of Japanese Literature."

Another work of Tsurayuki—the "Tosa Nikki"—is in the form of a diary
written on his return to Kioto after completing his term of office as
prefect there; it is dated the beginning of the year 935 A.D. During his
stay at Tosa he lost his little daughter of nine years, and the Tanks
following probably has reference to his bereavement.

### TANKA FROM THE "TOSA NIKKI"

<span class="smallcaps">By Kino Tsurayuki</span>

Drive us toward the glistening shell-strewn sand,  
I would descend from out my ship, O waves!  
"Shell of forgetfulness" <span id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2) clasped in
my hand,  
Then shall my soul obtain the peace it craves—  
Forgetfulness of all the longing vain  
For her whose face I may not see again!

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

### BROWN SAILS UPON THE SEA

It is the dawning of the Spring,  
Yet does it seem to me  
The brown leaves of the Fall  
Scattered beyond recall  
Float on the jewelled sea!

### THE WILD GEESE

<span class="smallcaps">By Kino Tsurayuki</span>

Unseen above me in the night,  
Dark autumn night, they swiftly fly,  
The wild geese on their southward flight.  
While listening to their plaintive cry,  
I think of old friends far away,  
And muse if, as in olden days,  
These birds some message might convey  
From those who dwell in distant ways!

### PLUM-BLOSSOM AND SNOW

<span class="smallcaps">By Kino Tsurayuki</span>

Were but the plum-flowers scentless as the snow,  
That softly falls upon the budding spray,  
How could we tell the pure white blooms that blow  
From the cold snowflakes, all alike as they,  
Starring the brown boughs’ tracery to-day?

### TANKA FROM THE "KOKINSHIU"

<span class="smallcaps">Compiled</span> A.D. 905-922

### REMEMBRANCE

Shall I forget thee?  
Not for that instant brief,  
In which the lightning's blade  
Lights up each ear of grain,  
Each swaying stem and leaf,  
When Autumn decks the plain  
  In rare brocade

### PLUM-BLOSSOM

  In this Spring night  
Of all-pervading grey,  
  No ray of light  
Reveals the plum-tree's spray,  
But viewless to the skies  
Its perfumes still arise.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

### VANISHING

Even as this passing life of ours,  
The cherry-blossoms fair display!  
Scarce have we gazed, in fragrant showers  
Of petals, from the wind-tossed spray,  
The blossoms’ beauties pass away!

### THE LEAVES

See the red maple-leaves that swirl  
In Autumn storm-winds t brief their span,  
Into the outer dark they whirl!  
More fleeting still the life of man.

### THE TOMB

An ancient tomb, with withered shikimi,  
Where the red dragon-flies flit to and fro!

### THE DREAM

Before I slept, I thought of thee,  
Then fell asleep, and sought for thee,  
     And found thee:  
Had I but known ’twas only seeming,  
I had not waked, but lain for ever dreaming!

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

### SONG OF MIONOSEKI

Seki is a fair place and a lovely,  
With glorious morning sun.  
There, from the holy mountains  
Softly the winds blow, softly!

### PASSING

What of our life! ’Tis imaged by a boat:  
The wide dawn sees it on the sea afloat;  
    Swiftly it rows away,  
And on the dancing waves no trace is seen  
    That it has ever been!

### ILLUSION

That which we see in sleep,  
Is that alone a dream?  
To me the world itself  
Is not what it may seem,  
But just a phantasy!
