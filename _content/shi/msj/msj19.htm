<p align="center">(<i>c</i>. 1190-1332)</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Author Unknown</span></p>  
<p><small>After the battle (naval) of Daimoura, A.D. 1185, between the Gen or Minamoto clan, under Yoshitsune, brother of the Shogun Yoritomo, and the Hei-Teira faction, the Mikado Antoku's nurse, on seeing the utter defeat of the Hei, took him, then a boy of eight, in her arms, and plunged with him into the sea, to avoid capture by the victorious Minamoto.</p>  
<p><i>Note</i>.&#8212;For the following, and for "The Bamboo Flute," I am indebted to prose versions in W. G. Aston's "Japanese Literature."</small></p>  
<p>Then Niidono, the Mikado's nurse,<br> Seeing the hopeless fortunes of her Lord,<br> Flung o&#8217;er her head a sombre-coloured robe,<br> Under her arm placing the sacred seal<br> And on her thigh girding the sacred sword.<br> Then to her breast she clasped the child, and cried,<br> "Though but a feeble woman, yet no foe<br> Lays sullying hands on me! nor on my King!"<br> And calmly on the ship's side placed her foot.</p>  
<p>Fair was his face, the Sov&#8217;reign whom she held;<br> Eight lovely springs above his head had passed,<br> His black locks clustered loosely on his neck,<br> And in his eyes there dawned a faint surprise.</p>  
<p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="green">p. 97</font></A></p>  
<p>"Whither wouldst take me, Amaz&eacute;?" he cried.<br> Weeping, she turned and thus addressed the child:<br> "Dost thou not know, my Lord, that thou wert born<br> Ruler of full ten thousand chariots,<br> Since in thy previous life the Way was kept?<br> But now, the wheel of Fate turns back again,<br> And evil triumphs; thy good Fortune fails.<br> Turn thy august face, first towards the East,<br> Greeting the Shrine of Is&eacute; in farewell;<br> Then to the West, and call upon the Name<br> Buddha, the Lord of Light, All-Merciful,<br> Whose messengers will meet thee, as we cross<br> Into the blessed Regions of the West!"</p>  
<p>Then the child tied to the Imperial robe,<br> Glowing with colours of the mountain dove,<br> His shining top-knot, tearfully he joined<br> His little lovely hands in simple prayer;<br> To Is&eacute;'s shrine he turned, and Hachiman's,<br> Then to the West, calling on Buddha's Name.<br> Niidono then took him in her arms<br> And murmuring, "Beneath the waves there lies<br> Pure Land of Perfect Happiness," she sprang<br> From off the side, and sank in fathoms deep!<br> Alas! how pitiful! the winds of Spring<br> Scattered the beautiful, the flowery form!<br> Billows of severance remorseless roll<br> Above that gem of priceless sovereignty.</p>

<p align="center">(<i>Born</i> A.D. 1203; <i>died</i> 1219)</p>  
<p><small>Son of the founder of the Shogunate, Yoritomo, of the House of Minamoto. He was assassinated at an early age, descending the steps of a temple, where he had been to return thanks for an additional title conferred on him by the Mikado. His assassin was High Priest of the Temple, and his nephew.</small></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">LOYALTY</h3>

<p>Though the high mountains should be rent apart,<br> Though dry the depths where now the deep seas roar,<br> Yet to my Lord I'll bear no double heart,<br> Still to my Prince be true for evermore!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">PRESENTIMENT</h3>  
<p align="center">(<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Written by the Shogun Sanetomo on leaving his Palace, previous to his Assassination</span>)</p>  
<p>If, issuing hence, I leave my dwelling-place<br> Untenanted&#8212;and coming days should bring<br> Its Lord no more, nor well-remembered face<br> Look on its halls, nor echoing footsteps ring&#8212;<br> Yet thou, loved Plum-tree, shadowing these eaves,<br> With boughs whose network fragile tracery weaves,<br> Forget not thou the Coming of the Spring!</p>

<p>Lonely and desolate<br> Stretches the coast line.<br> Here and there thatched roofs<br> Of fishermen's dwellings.<br> Cold gleam the waters.<br> Nor soft hue of blossom,<br> Nor rich glow of maples,<br> To brighten the sadness&#8212;<br> But twilight autumnal!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE DRAGON-FLY</h3>

<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Chiyo</span></p>  
<p>All round the rope a morning glory clings;<br> How can I break its beauty's dainty spell?<br> I beg for water from a neighbour's well,</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE NIGHT</h3>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all is still,<br> Nor one faint breath from icy mountains blown,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet bitter chill<br> The night, since thou art gone, and I alone!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE INFANT</h3>  
<p>Pitiful echoes the wailing,<br> Feeble wailing of infant,<br> Lonely and sad, and uncared for; <a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></A><br> But at the stillness of midnight<br> Suddenly ceases its crying.<br> Dream-like the dead mother passes<br> Swift to the side of her babe,<br> Bends o&#8217;er it, holding it safely,<br> Suckles it, murmuring softly<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispers of mother-love.</p>
