### AKÁHITO-YAMABENO

<span class="smallcaps">Flourished about</span> A.D. 700

<span class="small">One of the earliest distinguished poets of Japan. He
was the rival  of Hitómaro. He accompanied the Mikado Shoran. to Kii;
and afterwards visited the Eastland, where he composed the well-known
lines to Fuji.</span>

### ON WAKA'S SHORE

<span class="smallcaps">By Akáhito—7th Century</span>

On Waka's shore  
  The tide comes flowing.  
No resting-place  
  Above the waters showing,  
Towards the reeds  
  The cranes are swiftly flying,  
All the night sky  
  Resonant with their crying.

### ON VIEWING FUJI

By Tago's shore, I wander to and fro,  
  Gazing on Fuji's peak, where Autumn's earliest snow,  
    White-gleaming, sparkles.

### ON PASSING THE TOMB OF THE MAID OF MAMA

<span class="smallcaps">By Akáhito</span>

Fair was the Maid who dwelt in olden time  
In Mama village—and well wooed was she.  
Exchanged were Shidzu girdles. Bride-hut built,  
And here among dense maki leafage hid,  
     There lay her tomb.  
Long as the pine endures, her piteous tale,  
The record of her sorrows shall endure  
Engraven on my heart compassionate.  
Still the smooth sea-wrack floats upon the tide,  
In the clear waters of Kátsushika.  
How oft the shining tendrils from the sea  
Hath the fair maid of Mama gathered!

LAY ON THE RUINED CHAPEL OF TAKECHI <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0)

<span class="smallcaps">By Kamo no Kimitari-Hito</span>

The Spring mists hover round the hill,  
The Hill of Kagu, where of old  
The Gods descended, sacred still.  
The pine-breeze murmurs through the wold;  
A little ripple grows, and fades,  
As the light air the clear pool stirs.  
The cherry blooms still star the glades,  
Mist-wreaths of blossom ’mid dark firs.  
The wild duck seeks his mate, the teal  
Rise from the reeds on whirring wings,  
But on the lake no cleaving keel  
Over the shining water swings.  
Empty, the pleasure-barges lie,  
Oarless and desolate they float;  
No more for waiting courtiers ply,  
As in Imperial days remote.

<span class="smallcaps">ENVOY</span>

On the straight cedar-shafts the moss grows green,  
Witness how long this solitude has been!

### BY THE WIDE SEA

(From the "Manyôshiu "—Lay 78)

<span class="smallcaps">By Kuramochi no Asomi Chitosē</span>

By the wide sea, wherein the great whales dwell,  
Pleasant it is to wander o’er the shore,  
And watch the seaweed tendrils undulate  
In the green depths translucent, to and fro.  
Fair 'tis to see the thousand ripples gleam,  
In endless sequence in the morning calm;  
And in the eventide to watch the curves  
Of myriad wavelets breaking ceaselessly;  
While always from the depths of ocean rolls  
Through months and years the ever-heaving swell.  
Pleasant it is on Suminoyé's strand  
To watch the great white combers break in foam

SIGHS

The mists that drift across the hill—  
High Hill of Ohonu—  
They are my sighs that hover chill,  
Of sorrow born across the hill—  
High Hill of Ohonu!

### A LOYAL WISH

<span class="smallcaps">By Tanobe Sakimaro</span>

(From the "Manyôshiu"—A.D. 744)

Gentle the rise of wooded hills,  
The rapid's murmur pleasant falls,  
With rippled song and rushing trills  
There by Futagi's Palace walls,  
Where our great Prince and sacred Lord  
        Rules as he wills.

Long as in Spring, when soft and clear,  
The warblers’ liquid love-song flows,  
Upon the rocks resplendent flung,  
The rich brocade of blossom glows,  
Brightening the sombre mountain-foot  
        With gold and rose.

Long as in Autumn when afar  
Unto his mate the proud stag calls,  
From the brown boughs, a crimson star,  
Trailing to earth, the red leaf falls,  
Hurt by the rainy gusts that sweep  
        Through Heaven's blue halls.

So while a thousand years go by,  
Still may His life endure, august,  
While the great Palace shall defy  
Ages where Empires turn to dust.  
Still may the Gods preserve His sway  
        Imperial, just!

### LINES TO A FRIEND

(Lay 117 from the "Manyôshiu"—A.D. 728)

Heavy the burden of this Life to bear!  
By some strange chance we come into this world;  
Yet, live or die, for us one Duty still  
Shines through the dark perplexities of earth,  
Obedience to the bidding of our Lord!  
Therefore, O friend I while yet thy mortal frame  
Dwells in this world, liege-loyal must thou bide  
To thy great Sovereign—thou who farest forth  
Guard to the distant frontier far away,  
With a great company—as wild-fowl flock,  
Winging their flight in the pale shine of Dawn!  
Forget not thou, in far-flung wilds thy friend  
Left far behind in the City-Royal here,  
Whose love is thine, tho’ long thine absence be!

<span class="smallcaps">Envoy</span>

To Koshi as thou farest, crossing hills  
Steep and snow-clad, thy friend remember still  
Who, left behind, ever remembers thee I

### ON THE ASCENT TO HEAVEN OF THE MIKADO

(From the "Manyôshiu.")

<span class="smallcaps">By One of the Ladies of the Court</span>

I may not follow where my Lord  
Blissful ascends to Heaven's high plant;  
But, far from Him whom I adored,  
My sleeve is wet with bitter rain—  
Earthly and mortal I abide  
From His dear Presence sundered wide.

Were I a jewelled ornament,  
A vesture, an embroidered sleeve,  
I had not been so rudely rent  
From Him I saw but yester-eve  
In a dream-vision—Heaven-seat.
