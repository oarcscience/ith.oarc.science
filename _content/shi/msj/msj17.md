### AUTUMN THOUGHTS

<span class="smallcaps">By Tachibane no Masato</span>

  In the chill Autumn breeze  
A lonely insect weeping  
  Heavy dew-tears forlorn.  
Tell me, what feelings sweeping  
  Through its heart, passion-torn,  
Shake its frail frame with weeping?

### THE BARRIER AT NAKOSO

Gone is the barrier that of old  
     Had crossed my way,  
But in its place my eyes behold,  
     As on I stray—  
The wild winds sweep a scented cloud  
Of fluttering petals from the cherry-trees—  
Into the narrow pathway, where they crowd  
     Whirled by the breeze  
     And bid my footsteps stay,

### THE DRAGON-FLIES

The gold sun shimmering in noontide skies  
Shines down, where the red-burnished dragonflies  
Flit to and fro in the translucent haze  
Over the village of eventless days!

### CHERRY-BLOSSOM

<span class="smallcaps">By Tomonori—Early 10th Century</span>

The cherry-blossom gleams, a pearly haze,  
Across the landscape, far as eye can see,  
Like mist-wreaths veiling in their shifting maze  
Yoshino's mountain-gorges’ mystery.

### GLORY OF YOSHINO

<span class="smallcaps">By Teitoku</span>

Would that some stranger hitherward would stray,  
Unto whose wondering eyes I might display  
The blossoms' glory in spring sunrise glowing,  
Rose-pink of dawn upon a mist of grey,  
Yoshino's cherries on her mountains blowing.
