### TSUNEMASA

### By SEAMI

PERSONS

THE PRIEST GYŌKEI.  
THE GHOST OF TAIRA NO TSUNEMASA.  
CHORUS.

GYŌKEI.

I am Gyōkei, priest of the imperial temple Ninnaji. You must know that
there was a certain prince of the House of Taira named Tsunemasa, Lord
of Tajima, who since his boyhood has enjoyed beyond all precedent the
favour of our master the Emperor. But now he has been killed at the
Battle of the Western Seas.

It was to this Tsunemasa in his lifetime that the Emperor had given the
lute called Green Hill. And now my master bids me take it and dedicate
it to Buddha, performing a liturgy of flutes and strings for the
salvation of Tsunemasa's soul. And that was my purpose in gathering
these musicians together.

Truly it is said that strangers who shelter under the same tree or draw
water from the same pool will he friends in another life. How much the
more must intercourse of many years, kindness and favour so deep . .
. <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24)

Surely they will be heard,  
The prayers that all night long  
With due performance of rites  
1 have reverently repeated in this Palace  
For the salvation of Tsunemasa  
And for the awakening of his soul.

CHORUS.

And, more than all, we dedicate  
The lute Green Hill for this dead man; <span id="page_52">p. 52</span>  
While pipe and flute are joined to sounds of prayer.  
For night and day the Gate of Law  
Stands open and the Universal Road  
Rejects no wayfarer.

TSUNEMASA (*speaking off the stage*).

"The wind blowing through withered trees: rain from a cloudless sky.  
The moon shining on level sands: frost on a summer's night." <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25)  
Frost lying . . . but I, because I could not lie at rest,  
Am come back to the World for a while,  
Like a shadow that steals over the grass.  
I am like dews that in the morning  
Still cling to the grasses. Oh pitiful the longing  
That has beset me!

GYŌKEI.

How strange! Within the flame of our candle that is burning low because
the night is far spent, suddenly I seemed to see a man's shadow dimly
appearing. Who can be here?

TSUNEMASA (*his shadow disappearing*).

I am the ghost of Tsunemasa. The sound of your prayers has brought me in
visible shape before you.

GYŌKEI.

"I am the ghost of Tsunemasa," he said, but when I looked to where the
voice had sounded nothing was there, neither substance nor shadow!

TSUNEMASA.

Only a voice,

GYŌKEI.

A dim voice whispers where the shadow of a man  
Visibly lay, but when I looked

TSUNEMASA.

It had vanished--

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

GYŌKEI.

This flickering form . . .

TSUNEMASA.

Like haze over the fields.

CHORUS.

Only as a tricking magic,  
A bodiless vision,  
Can he hover in the world of his lifetime,  
Swift-changing Tsunemasa.  
By this name we call him, yet of the body  
That men named so, what is left but longing?  
What but the longing to look again, through the wall of death,  
On one he loved?  
"Sooner shall the waters in its garden cease to flow  
Than I grow weary of living in the Palace of my Lord." <span
id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26)  
Like a dream he has come,  
Like a morning dream.

GYŌKEI.

How strange! When the form of Tsunemasa had vanished, his voice lingered
and spoke to me! Am I dreaming or waking? I cannot tell. But this I
know,--that by the power of my incantations I have had converse with the
dead. Oh! marvellous potency of the Law!

TSUNEMASA.

It was long ago that I came to the Palace. I was but a boy then, but all
the world knew me; for I was marked with the love of our Lord, with the
favour of an Emperor. And, among many gifts, he gave to me once while I
was in the World this lute which you have dedicated. My fingers were
ever on its strings.

CHORUS.

Plucking them even as now  
This music plucks at your heart;  
The sound of the plectrum, then as now  
Divine music fulfilling <span id="page_54">p. 54</span>  
The vows of Sarasvati. <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27)  
But this Tsunemasa,  
Was he not from the days of his childhood pre-eminent  
In faith, wisdom, benevolence,  
Honour and courtesy; yet for his pleasure  
Ever of birds and flowers,  
Of wind and moonlight making  
Ballads and songs to join their harmony  
To pipes and lutes?  
So springs and autumns passed he.  
But in a World that is as dew,  
As dew on the grasses, as foam upon the waters,  
What flower lasteth?

GYŌKEI.

For the dead man's sake we play upon this lute Green Hill that he loved
when he was in the World. We follow the lute-music with a concord of
many instruments.

(*Music*.)

TSUNEMASA.

And while they played the dead man stole up behind them. Though he could
not be seen by the light of the candle, they felt him pluck the
lute-strings. . . .

GYŌKEI.

It is midnight. He is playing *Yabanraku*, the dance of midnight-revel.
And now that we have shaken sleep from our eyes . . .

TSUNEMASA.

The sky is clear, yet there is a sound as of sudden rain . . . .

GYŌKEI.

Rain beating carelessly on trees and grasses. What season's music <span
id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_28) ought we to play?

 

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

TSUNEMASA.

No. It is not rain. Look! At the cloud's fringe

CHORUS.

The moon undimmed  
Hangs over the pine-woods of Narabi <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29)
Hills.  
It was the wind you heard;  
The wind blowing through the pine-leaves  
Pattered, like the falling of winter rain.  
O wonderful hour!  
"The big strings crashed and sobbed  
Like the falling of winter rain.  
And the little strings whispered secretly together.  
The first and second string  
Were like a wind sweeping through pine-woods,  
Murmuring disjointedly.  
The third and fourth string  
Were like the voice of a caged stork  
Crying for its little ones at night  
In low, dejected notes." <span id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30)  
The night must not cease.  
The cock shall not crow  
And put an end to his wandering. <span id="fr_31"></span>[3](#fn_31)

TSUNEMASA.

"One note of the phœnix-flute <span id="fr_32"></span>[4](#fn_32)

CHORUS.

Shakes the autumn clouds from the mountain-side." <span
id="fr_33"></span>[5](#fn_33)  
The phœnix and his mate swoop down  
Charmed by its music, beat their wings  
And dance in rapture, perched upon the swaying boughs  
Of kiri and bamboo.

(*Dance*.)

 

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

TSUNEMASA.

Oh terrible anguish!  
For a little while I was back in the World and my heart set on its
music, on revels of midnight. But now the hate is rising in me . . .
 <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34)

GYŌKEI.

The shadow that we saw before is still visible.  
Can it be Tsunemasa?

TSUNEMASA.

Oh! I am ashamed; I must not let them see me.  
Put out your candle.

CHORUS.

"Let us turn away from the candle and watch together  
The midnight moon."  
Lo, he who holds the moon,  
The god Indra, in battle appeareth  
Warring upon demons.  
Fire leaps from their swords,  
The sparks of their own anger fall upon them like rain.  
To wound another he draws his sword,  
But it is from his own flesh  
That the red waves flow;  
Like flames they cover him.  
"Oh, I am ashamed of the woes that consume me.  
No man must see me. I will put out the candle!" he said;  
For a foolish man is like a summer moth that flies into the flame. <span
id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35)  
The wind that blew out the candle  
Carried him away. In the darkness his ghost has vanished.  
The shadow of his ghost has vanished.
