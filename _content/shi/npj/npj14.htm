</DIR>

<P>BENKEI.</P>
<P>I am one who lives near the Western Pagoda. My name is Musashib&#333; Benkei. In fulfillment of a certain vow I have been going lately by night at the hour of the Ox&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to worship at the Goj&#333; Temple. Tonight is the last time; I ought soon to be starting.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Hie! Is any one there?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FOLLOWER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Here I am.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BENKEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I sent for you to tell you that I shall be going to the Goj&#333; Temple to-night.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FOLLOWER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I tremble and listen. But there is a matter that I must bring to your notice. I hear that yesterday there was a boy of twelve or thirteen guarding the Goj&#333; Bridge. They say he was slashing round with his short sword as nimble as a bird or butterfly. I beg that you will not make your pilgrimage to-night. Do not court this peril.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BENKEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>That's a strange thing to ask! Why, were he demon or hobgoblin, he could not stand alone against many. We will surround him and You shall soon see him on his knees.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A></P>
<P>FOLLOWER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>They have tried surrounding him, but he always escapes as though by magic, and none is able to lay hands on him.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BENKEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>When he seems within their grasp</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FOLLOWER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>From before their eyes</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BENKEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Suddenly he vanishes.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>This strange hobgoblin, elfish apparition,<BR>
Into great peril may bring<BR>
The reverend limbs of my master.<BR>
In all this City none can withstand the prowess<BR>
Of this unparalleled monster.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BENKEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>If this is as you say, I will not go to-night; and yet . . . No. It is not to be thought of that such a one as Benkei should be affrighted by a tale. To-night when it is dark I will go to the bridge and humble this arrogant elf.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And while he spoke,<BR>
Evening already to the western sky had come;<BR>
Soon the night-wind had shattered and dispersed<BR>
The shapes of sunset. Cheerless night<BR>
Came swiftly, but with step too slow<BR>
For him who waits.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(<I>A Comic interlude played by a bow-master is sometimes used here to fill in the time while</I> BENKEI <I>is arming himself</I>.)</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>USHIWAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I am Ushiwaka. I must do as my mother told me; "Go up to the, Temple&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> at daybreak," she said. But it is still night. I will go to <A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A> Goj&#333; Bridge and wait there till suddenly</P>
<P>Moonlight mingles with the rising waves;<BR>
No twilight closes<BR>
The autumn day, but swiftly<BR>
The winds of night bring darkness.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS (<I>speaking for</I> USHIWAKA).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oh! beauty of the waves! High beats my heart,<BR>
High as their scattered pearls!<BR>
Waves white as dewy calabash&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> at dawn,<BR>
By Goj&#333; Bridge.<BR>
Silently the night passes,<BR>
No sound but my own feet upon the wooden planks<BR>
Clanking and clanking; still I wait<BR>
And still in vain.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BENKEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The night grows late. Eastward the bells of the Three Pagodas toll.<BR>
By the moonlight that gleams through leaves of these thick cedar-trees<BR>
I gird my armour on;<BR>
I fasten the black thongs of my coat of mail.<BR>
I adjust its armoured skirts.<BR>
By the middle I grasp firmly<BR>
My great halberd that I have loved so long.<BR>
1 lay it across my shoulder; with leisurely step stride forward.<BR>
Be he demon or hobgoblin, how shall he stand against me?<BR>
Such trust have I in my own prowess. Oh, how I long<BR>
For a foeman worthy of my hand!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>USHIWAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The river-wind blows keen;<BR>
The night is almost spent,<BR>
But none has crossed the Bridge.<BR>
I am disconsolate and will lie down to rest.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>BENKEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then Benkei, all unknowing, <A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A><BR>
Came towards the Bridge where white waves lapped.<BR>
Heavily his feet clanked on the boards of the Bridge.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>USHIWAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And even before he saw him Ushiwaka gave a whoop of joy.<BR>
"Some one has come," he cried, and hitching his cloak over his shoulder<BR>
Took his stand at the bridge-side.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BENKEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Benkei discerned him and would have spoken....<BR>
But when he looked, lo! it was a woman's form!<BR>
Then, because he had left the World,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with troubled mind he hurried on.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>USHIWAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then Ushiwaka said,<BR>
"I will make game of him," and as Benkei passed<BR>
Kicked at the button of his halberd so that it jerked into the air.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BENKEI (<I>cries out in surprise</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Ah! fool, I will teach you a lesson!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then Benkei while he retrieved his halberd<BR>
Cried out in anger,<BR>
"You shall soon feel the strength of my arm," and fell fiercely upon him.<BR>
But the boy, not a jot alarmed,<BR>
Stood his ground and with one hand pulled aside his cloak,<BR>
While with the other he quietly drew his sword from the scabbard<BR>
And parried the thrust of the halberd that threatened him.<BR>
Again and again he parried the halberd's point.<BR>
And so they fought, now closing, now breaking.<BR>
What shall Benkei do? For when he thinks that he has conquered,<BR>
With his little sword the boy thrusts the blow aside.<BR>
Again and again Benkei strikes.<BR>
Again and again his blows are parried, <A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A><BR>
Till at last even he, mighty Benkei,<BR>
Can do battle no longer.<BR>
Disheartened he steps back the space of a few bridge-beams.<BR>
"Monstrous," he cries, "that this stripling . . . No, it cannot be.<BR>
He shall not outwit my skill."<BR>
And holding out his halberd at full length before him<BR>
He rushed forward and dealt a mighty blow.<BR>
But Ushiwaka. turned and dived swiftly to the left.<BR>
Benkei recovered his halberd and slashed at the boy's skirts;<BR>
But he, unfaltering, instantly leapt from the ground.<BR>
And when he thrust at the boy's body,<BR>
Then Ushiwaka squirmed with head upon the ground.<BR>
Thus a thousand, thousand bouts they fought,<BR>
Till the halberd fell from Benkei's weary hands.<BR>
He would have wrestled, but the boy's sword flashed before him,<BR>
And he could get no hold.<BR>
Then at his wits' end, "Oh, marvellous youth!"<BR>
Benkei cried, and stood dumbfounded.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Who are you that, so young and frail, possess such daring? Tell us your name and state.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>USHIWAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Why should I conceal it from you? I am Minamoto Ushiwaka.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Yoshitomo's son?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>USHIWAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I am. And your name . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS (<I>speaking for</I> BENKEI).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"I am called Musashi Benkei of the Western Pagoda.<BR>
And now that we have told our names,<BR>
I surrender myself and beg for mercy;<BR>
For you are yet a child, and I a priest.<BR>
Such are your rank and lineage, such your prowess<BR>
That I will gladly serve you. <A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A><BR>
Too hastily you took me for an enemy; but now begins<BR>
A three lives' bond; henceforward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
As slave I serve you."<BR>
So, while the one made vows of homage, the other girded up his cloak.<BR>
Then Benkei laid his halberd across his shoulder<BR>
And together they went on their way<BR>
To the palace of Kuj&#333;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></P>
