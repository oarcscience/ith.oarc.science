<P>I am a courtier in the service of the Emperor Shujaku. You must know that the Prime Minister's daughter, Princess Aoi, has fallen sick. We have sent for abbots and high-priests, of the Greater School and of the Secret School, but they could not cure her.</P>
<P>And now, here at my side, stands the witch of Teruhi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a famous diviner with the bow-string. My lord has been told that by twanging her bow-string she can make visible an evil spirit and tell if it be the spirit of a living man or a dead. So he bade me send for her and let her pluck her string. (Turning to the WITCH, who has been waiting motionless.) Come, sorceress, we are ready!</P>

We are brittle as the leaves of the <I>bash&#333;</I>;<BR>
As fleeting as foam upon the sea.<BR>
Yesterday's flower, to-day's dream.<BR>
From such a dream were it not wiser to wake?<BR>
And when to this is added another's scorn<BR>
How can the heart have rest?<BR>
So when I heard the twanging of your bow<BR>
For a little while, I thought, I will take my pleasure;<BR>
And as an angry ghost appeared.<BR>
Oh! I am ashamed!</P></DIR>

On spring mornings I rode out<BR>
In royal retinue and on autumn nights<BR>
Among the red leaves of the Rishis' Cave<BR>
I sported with moonbeams,<BR>
With colours and perfumes<BR>
My senses sated.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I had splendour then;<BR>

Whose span endures not from dawn to midday.<BR>
