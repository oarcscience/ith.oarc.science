<P ALIGN="CENTER">By SEAMI</P>
<P>THE priest Shunkwan, together with Naritsune and Yasuyori, had plotted the overthrow of the Tairas. They were arrested and banished to Devil's Island on the shore of Satsuma.</P>
<P>Naritsune and Yasuyori were worshippers of the Gods of Kumano. They brought this worship with them to the place of their exile, constructing on the island an imitation of the road from Ky&#333;to to Kumano with its ninety-nine roadside shrines. This "holy way" they decked with <I>nusa</I>, "paper-festoons," and carried out, as best they might, the Shint&#333; ceremonies of the three shrines of Kumano.</P>
<P>When the play begins the two exiles are carrying out these rites. Having no albs &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to wear, they put on the tattered hemp-smocks which they wore on their journey; having no rice to offer, they pour out a libation of sand.</P>
<P>Shunkwan, who had been abbot of the Zen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> temple Hossh&#333;ji, holds aloof from these ceremonies. But when the worshippers return he comes to meet them carrying a bucket of water, which he tells them is the wine for their final libation. They look into the bucket and cry in disgust: <I>Ya! Kore wa mizu nari!</I> "Why, it is water!"</P>
<P>In a long lyrical dialogue which follows, Shunkwan, with the aid of many classical allusions, justifies the identification of chrysanthemum-water and wine.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>CHORUS (<I>speaking for</I> SHUNKWAN.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oh, endless days of banishment!<BR>
How long shall I languish in this place,<BR>
Where the time while a mountain dewdrop dries<BR>
Seems longer than a thousand years?<BR>
A spring has gone; summer grown to age;<BR>
An autumn closed; a winter come again,<BR>
Marked only by the changing forms<BR>
Of flowers and trees. <A NAME="page_230"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 230</FONT></A><BR>
Oh, longed-for time of old!<BR>
Oh, recollection sweet whithersoever<BR>
The mind travels; City streets and cloisters now<BR>
Seem Edens&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> garlanded<BR>
With every flower of Spring.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Suddenly a boat appears carrying a stranger to the shore. This is represented on the stage by an attendant carrying the conventionalized N&#333; play "boat" on to the <I>hashi gakari</I>. The envoy, whose departure from the Capital forms the opening scene of the play--I have omitted it is my summary--has been standing by the "Waki's pillar." He now steps into the boat and announces that a following wind is carrying him swiftly over the sea. He leaves the boat, carrying a Proclamation in his hand.</P>
<P>ENVOY.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I bring an Act of Amnesty from the City.</P>
<P>Here, read it for yourselves.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN (<I>snatching the scroll</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Look, Yasuyori! Look! At last!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YASUYORI (<I>reading the scroll</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>What is this? What is this?</P>
<P>"Because of the pregnancy of Her Majesty the Empress, an amnesty is proclaimed throughout the land. All exiles are recalled from banishment, and, of those exiled on Devil's Island, to these two Naritsune, Lieutenant of Tamba and Yasuyori of the Taira clan, free pardon is granted,"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Why, you have forgotten to read Shunkwan's name!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YASUYORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Your name, alas, is not there. Read the scroll.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN (<I>scanning the scroll</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>This must be some scribe's mistake.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ENVOY.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>No; they told me at the Capital to bring back Yasuyori and Naritsune, but to leave Shunkwan upon the island.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_231"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 231</FONT></A></P>
<P>SHUNKWAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>How can that be?<BR>
One crime, one banishment;<BR>
Yet I alone, when pardon<BR>
Like a mighty net is spread<BR>
To catch the drowning multitude, slip back<BR>
Into the vengeful deep!<BR>
When three dwelt here together,<BR>
How terrible the loneliness of these wild rocks!<BR>
Now one is left, to wither<BR>
Like a flower dropped on the shore.<BR>
Like a broken sea-weed branch<BR>
That no wave carries home.</P>
<P>Is not this island named<BR>
The Realm of Fiends, where I,<BR>
Damned but not dead walk the Black Road of Death?<BR>
Yet shall the foulest fiend of Hell<BR>
Now weep for me whose wrong<BR>
Must needs move heaven and earth,<BR>
Wake angels' pity, rend<BR>
The hearts of men, turn even the hungry cries<BR>
Of the wild beasts and birds that haunt these rocks<BR>
To tender lamentation.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>He buries his face in his hands; then after a while begins reading the scroll again</I>.)</P>
<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He took the scroll that he had read before.<BR>
He opened it and looked.<BR>
His eyes, like a shuttle, travelled<BR>
To and fro, to and fro.<BR>
Yet, though he looked and looked,<BR>
No other names he saw<BR>
But Yasuyori's name and Naritsune's name<BR>
Then thinking "There is a codicil, perhaps,"<BR>
Again he opens the scroll and looks.<BR>
Nowhere is the word S&#333;zu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> nowhere the word Shunkwan.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(<I>The </I>ENVOY<I> then calls upon </I>NARITSUNE<I> and </I>YASUYORI<I> to board the boat. </I>SHUNKWAN<I> clutches at</I> YASUYORI'S <A NAME="page_232"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 232</FONT></A> <I>sleeve and tries to follow him on board. The </I>ENVOY<I> pushes him back, calling to him to keep clear of the boat</I>.)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Wretch, have you not heard the saying:<BR>
"Be law, but not her servants, pitiless."<BR>
Bring me at least to the mainland. Have so much charity!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ENVOY.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But the sailor&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> knew no pity;<BR>
He took his oar and struck. . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN (retreating a step).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Nevertheless, leave me my life. . . .<BR>
Then he stood back and caught in both his hands<BR>
The anchor-rope and dragged . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ENVOY.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But the sailor cut the rope and pushed the boat to sea.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He clasped his hands. He called, besought them-</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ENVOY.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But though they heard him calling, they would not carry him.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>It was over; he struggled no more.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But left upon the beach, wildly he waved his sleeves,<BR>
Stricken as she&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who on the shore<BR>
Of Matsura waved till she froze to stone.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ENVOYS, <A HREF="errata.htm#4">NARITSUNE</A> and YASUYORI (<I>together</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Unhappy man, our hearts are not cold. When we reach the City, we will plead unceasingly for your recall. In a little while you shall return. Wait with a good heart.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(<I>Their voices grow fainter and fainter, as though the ship were moving away from the shore</I>.)</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_233"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 233</FONT></A></P>
<P>SHUNKWAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Wait, wait," they cried, "Hope, wait!"<BR>
But distance dimmed their cry,<BR>
And hope with their faint voices faded.<BR>
He checked his sobs, stood still and listened, listened--</P>
<P>(SHUNKWAN <I>puts his hand to his ear and bends forward in the attitude of one straining to catch a distant sound</I>.)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>THE THREE.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Shunkwan, Shunkwan, do you hear us?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>You will plead for me?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>THE THREE.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Yes, yes. And then surely you will be summoned. . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Back to the City? Can you mean it?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>THE THREE.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Why, surely!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I hope; yet while I hope.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Wait, wait, wait!"<BR>
Dimmer grow the voices; dimmer the ship, the wide waves<BR>
Pile up behind it.<BR>
The voices stop. The ship, the men<BR>
Have vanished. All is gone</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P>There is an ancient K&#333;waka dance called I&#333; go Shima, "Sulphur Island," another name for Devil's Island. It represents the piety of Naritsune and Yasuyori, and the amoral mysticism of the Zen abbot Shunkwan. Part of the text is as follows</I>:</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>NARITSUNE.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>This is the vow of the Holy One,<BR>
The God of Kumano: <A NAME="page_234"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 234</FONT></A><BR>
"Whosoever of all mortal men<BR>
Shall turn his heart to m%<BR>
Though he be come to the utmost end of the desert,<BR>
To the furthest fold of the hills,<BR>
I will send a light to lead him;<BR>
I will guide him on his way."<BR>
And we exiled on this far rock,<BR>
By daily honour to the Triple Shrine,<BR>
By supplication to Kumano's God,<BR>
Shall compass our return.<BR>
Shunkwan, how think you?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SHUNKWAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Were it the Hill King of Hiyei,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I would not say no. But as for this God of Kumano, I have no faith in him. (<I>Describing the actions of</I> NARITSUNE <I>and</I> YASUYORI.)</P>
<P>Then lonely, lonely these two to worship went;<BR>
On the wide sea they gazed,<BR>
Roamed on the rugged shore;<BR>
Searching ever for a semblance<BR>
Of the Three Holy Hills.<BR>
Now, where between high rocks<BR>
A long, clear river flowed;<BR>
Now where tree-tops soar<BR>
Summit on summit upward to the sky.<BR>
And there they planned to set<BR>
The Mother-Temple, Hall of Proven Truth;<BR>
And here the Daughter-Shrine,<BR>
The Treasury of Kan.<BR>
Then far to northward aiming<BR>
To a white cliff they came, where from the clouds<BR>
Swift waters tumbled down.<BR>
Then straightway they remembered<BR>
The Hill of Nachi, where the Dragon God,<BR>
Winged water-spirit, pants with stormy breath<BR>
And fills the woods with awe.<BR>
Here reverently they their Nachi set.</P>
<P>The Bonze Shunkwan mounted to a high place;<BR>
His eye wandered north, south, east and west.</P></DIR>

<P>A thousand, thousand concepts filled his heart.<BR>
Suddenly a black cloud rose before him,<BR>
A heavy cloak of cloud;<BR>
And a great rock crashed and fell into the sea.<BR>
Then the great Bonze in his meditation remembered<BR>
An ancient song:<BR>
"The wind scattered a flower at Buddha's feet;<BR>
A boulder fell and crushed the fish of the pool.<BR>
Neither has the wind merit, nor the boulder blame;<BR>
They know not what they do."<BR>
"The Five Limbs are a loan," he cried, "that must be repaid;<BR>
A mess of earth, water, air, fire.<BR>
And the heart--void, as the sky; shapeless, substanceless!<BR>
Being and non-being<BR>
Are but twin aspects of all component things.<BR>
And that which seem to be, soon is not.<BR>
But only contemplation is eternal."<BR>
So the priest: proudly pillowed<BR>
On unrepentance and commandments broke.</P>
