</DIR>

<P>FISHERMAN.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Loud the rowers' cry<BR>
Who through the storm-swept paths of Mio Bay<BR>
Ride to the rising sea.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I am Hakury&#333;, a fisherman whose home is by the pine-woods of Mio.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>BOTH.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"On a thousand leagues of lovely hill clouds suddenly close;<BR>
But by one tower the bright moon shines in a clear sky."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
A pleasant season, truly: on the pine-wood shore<BR>
The countenance of Spring;<BR>
Early mist close-clasped to the swell of the sea;<BR>
In the plains of the sky a dim, loitering moon.<BR>
Sweet sight, to gaze enticing<BR>
Eyes even of us earth-cumbered<BR>
Low souls, least for attaining<BR>
Of high beauty nurtured.<BR>
Oh unforgettable! By mountain paths<BR>
Down to the sea of Kiyomi I come<BR>
And on far woodlands look,<BR>
Pine-woods of Mio, thither<BR>
Come, thither guide we our course.<BR>
Fishers, why put you back your boats to shore,<BR>
No fishing done?<A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A><BR>
Thought you them rising waves, those billowy clouds<BR>
Wind-blown across sea?<BR>
Wait, for the time is Spring and in the trees<BR>
The early wind his everlasting song<BR>
Sings low; and in the bay<BR>
Silent in morning calm the little ships,<BR>
Ships of a thousand fishers, ride the sea.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(<I>The second </I>FISHERMAN<I> retires to a position near the leader of the </I>CHORUS<I> and takes no further part in the action</I>.)</P>
<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Now I have landed at the pine-wood of Mio and am viewing the beauty of the shore. Suddenly there is music in the sky, a rain of flowers, unearthly fragrance wafted on all sides. These are no common things; nor is this beautiful cloak that hangs upon the pine-tree. I come near to it. It is marvellous in form and fragrance. This surely is no common dress. I will take it back with me and show it to the people of my home. It shall be a treasure in my house.</P>
<P>(<I>He walks four steps towards the Waki's pillar carrying the feather robe</I>.)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ANGEL (<I>entering through the curtain at the end of the gallery</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Stop! That cloak is mine. Where are you going with it?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>This is a cloak I found here. I am taking it home.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>It is an-angel's robe of feathers, a cloak no mortal man may wear. Put it back where you found it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>How? Is the owner of this cloak an angel of the sky? Why, then, I will put it in safe keeping. It shall be a treasure in the land, a marvel to men unborn.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I will not give back your cloak.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oh pitiful! How shall I cloakless tread<BR>
The wing-ways of the air, how climb <A NAME="page_180 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 180 </FONT></A><BR>
The sky, my home?<BR>
Oh, give it back, in charity give it back.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>No charity is in me, and your moan<BR>
Makes my heart resolute.<BR>
Look, I take your robe, hide it, and will not give it back.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>Describing his own actions. Then he walks away</I>.)</P>
<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Like a bird without wings,<BR>
I would rise, but robeless</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P>
<P>To the low earth you sink, an angel dwelling<BR>
In the dingy world.</P>
<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>

<P>This way, that way.<BR>
Despair only.</P></DIR>

<P>Help none ...</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then on her coronet,<BR>
Jewelled as with the dew of tears,<BR>
The bright flowers drooped and faded.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
O piteous to see before the eyes,<BR>
Fivefold the signs of sickness<BR>
Corrupt an angel's form.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I look into the plains of heaven,<A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A><BR>
The cloud-ways are hid in mist, The path is lost.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oh, enviable clouds,<BR>
At your will wandering<BR>
For ever idle in the empty sky<BR>
That was my home!<BR>
Now fades and fades upon my ear<BR>
The voice of Kalavink,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Daily accustomed song.<BR>
And you, oh you I envy,<BR>
Wild-geese clamorous<BR>
Down the sky-paths returning;<BR>
And you, O seaward circling, shoreward sweeping<BR>
Swift seagulls of the bay:<BR>
Even the wind, because in heaven it blows,<BR>
The wind of Spring I envy.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Listen. Now that I have seen you in your sorrow, I yield and would give you back your mantle.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oh, I am happy! Give it me then!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Wait. I have heard tell of the dances that are danced in heaven.<BR>
Dance for me now, and I will give back your robe.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I am happy, happy. Now I shall have wings and mount the sky again.<BR>
And for thanksgiving I bequeath<BR>
A dance of remembrance to the world,<BR>
Fit for the princes of men:<BR>
The dance-tune that makes to turn<BR>
The towers of the moon,<BR>
I will dance it here and as an heirloom leave it<BR>
To the sorrowful men of the world. <A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A><BR>
Give back my mantle, I cannot dance without it.<BR>
Say what you will, I must first have back the robe.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Not yet, for if I give back your robe, not a step would you dance, but fly with it straight to the sky.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>No, no. Doubt is for mortals;<BR>
In heaven is no deceit.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I am ashamed. Look, I give back the robe.</P>
<P>(<I>He gives it to her and she takes it in both hands</I>.)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The heavenly lady puts on her garment,<BR>
She dances the dance of the Rainbow Skirt, of the Robe of Feathers.</P></DIR>

<P>HAKURY&#332;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The sky-robe flutters; it yields to the wind.</P></DIR>

<DIR>

<P>Shall I dance?</P></DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>

<P>The dance of Suruga, with music of the East?<BR>
Thus was it first danced.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(<I>The </I>ANGEL<I> dances, while the </I>CHORUS<I> sings the words of the dance, an ancient Shint&#333; chant</I>.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Why name we<BR>
Wide-stretched and everlasting.<BR>
The sky of heaven?<BR>
Two gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> there came of old <A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A><BR>
And built, upon ten sides shut in,<BR>
A measured world for men;<BR>
But without limit arched they<BR>
The sky above, and named it<BR>
Wide-stretched and everlasting."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Thus is the Moon-God's palace:<BR>
Its walls are fashioned<BR>
With an axe of jade.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>In white dress, black dress,<BR>
Thrice ten angels<BR>
In two ranks divided,<BR>
Thrice five for the waning,<BR>
Thrice five for nights of the waxing moon,<BR>
One heavenly lady on each night of the moon<BR>
Does service and fulfils<BR>
Her ritual task assigned.</P></DIR>

<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>

<P>I too am of their number,<BR>
A moon-lady of heaven.</P></DIR>

Dwelt with the people of Earth, and gave them<BR>
A gift of music, song-dance of Suruga.</P>
<P>Now upon earth trail the long mists of Spring;<BR>
Who knows but in the valleys of the moon<BR>
The heavenly moon-tree puts her blossom on?<BR>
The blossoms of her crown win back their glory:<BR>
It is the sign of Spring.<BR>
Not heaven is here, but beauty of the wind and sky.<BR>
Blow, blow, you wind, and build<BR>
Cloud-walls across the sky, lest the vision leave us<BR>
Of a maid divine!<BR>
This tint of springtime in the woods, <A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A><BR>
This colour on the headland,<BR>
Snow on the mountain,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Moonlight on the clear shore,--<BR>
Which fairest? Nay, each peerless<BR>
At the dawn of a Spring day.<BR>
Waves lapping, wind in the pine-trees whispering<BR>
Along the quiet shore. Say you, what cause<BR>
Has Heaven to be estranged<BR>
From us Earth-men; are we not children of the Gods,<BR>
Within, without the jewelled temple wall,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Born where no cloud dares dim the waiting moon,<BR>
Land of Sunrise?"</P></DIR>

<P>ANGEL.</P><DIR>

<P>May our Lord's life<BR>
Last long as a great rock rubbed<BR>
Only by the rare trailing<BR>
Of an angel's feather-skirt.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
Oh, marvellous music!<BR>
The Eastern song joined<BR>
To many instruments;<BR>
Harp, zither, pan-pipes, flute,<BR>
Belly their notes beyond the lonely clouds.<BR>
The sunset stained with crimson light<BR>
From Mount Sumeru's side;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><BR>
For green, the islands floating on the sea;<BR>
For whiteness whirled<BR>
A snow of blossom blasted<BR>
By the wild winds, a white cloud<BR>
Of sleeves waving.</P></DIR>

The fifteenth night,<BR>
With the beam of perfect fulfilment,<BR>
The splendor of Truth.<BR>
The vows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are fulfilled, and the land we live in<BR>
Rich with the Seven Treasures<BR>
By this dance rained down on us,<BR>
The gift of Heaven.<BR>
But, as the hours pass by,<BR>
Sky-cloak of feathers fluttering, fluttering,<BR>
Over the pine-woods of Mio,<BR>
Past the Floating Islands, through the feet of the clouds she flies,<BR>
Over the mountain of Ashitaka, the high peak of Fuji,<BR>
Very faint her form,<BR>
Mingled with the mists of heaven;<BR>
Now lost to sight.</P></DIR>
