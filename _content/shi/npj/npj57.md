# APPENDIX II

SOME of the facts brought to light by the discovery of Seami's
*Works*:--

 

\(1\) It had long been suspected that the current *Kwadensho* was not
the work of Seami. The discovery of the real *Kwadensho* has made this
certain.

\(2\) Traditional dates of Kwanami and Seami corrected.

\(3\) It was supposed that only the music of the plays was written by
their nominal authors. The words were vaguely attributed to "Zen
Priests." We now know that in most cases Kwanami and Seami played the
triple part of author, <span id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_218) musical
composer and actor.

\(4\) It was doubted whether in the fourteenth century Sarugaku had
already become a serious dramatic performance. We now know that it then
differed little (and in respect of seriousness not at all) from Nō as it
exists to-day.

\(5\) It was supposed that the Chorus existed from the beginning. We now
learn from Seami that it was a novelty in 1430. Its absence must have
been the chief feature which distinguished the Sarugaku of the
fourteenth century from the Nō of to-day.

\(6\) Numerous passages prove that Nō at its zenith was not an
exclusively aristocratic art. The audiences were very varied.

\(7\) Seami gives details about the musical side of the plays as
performed in the fourteenth century. These passages, as is confessed
even by the great Nō scholar, Suzuki Chōkō, could be discussed only by
one trained in Nō-music.
