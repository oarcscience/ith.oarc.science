<P>HOSTESS</P>
<P>I who now stand before you am a woman of the village of Kantan in China. A long while ago I gave lodging to one who practised the arts of wizardry; and as payment be left here a famous pillow, called the Pillow of Kantan. He who sleeps on this pillow sees in a moment's dream the past or future spread out before him, and so awakes illumined. If it should chance that any worshipful travellers arrive today, pray send for me.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>She takes the pillow and lays it on the covered "da&iuml;s" which represents at first the bed and afterwards the palace</I>.)</P>
<P>ROSEI (<I>enters</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Lost on the journey of life, shall I learn at last<BR>
That I trod but a path of dreams?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>My name is Rosei, and I have come from the land of Shoku. Though born to man's estate, I have not sought Buddha's way, but have drifted from dusk to dawn and dawn to dusk.</P>
<P>They tell me that on the Hill of the Flying Sheep in the land of So&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> there lives a mighty sage; and now I am hastening to visit him that he may tell by what rule I should conduct my life.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>Song of Travel</I>.)</P>
<P>
</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Deep hid behind the alleys of the sky<BR>
Lie the far lands where I was wont to dwell.<BR>
Over the hills I trail<BR>
A tattered cloak; over the hills again:<BR>
Fen-dusk and mountain-dusk and village-dusk <A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A><BR>
Closed many times about me, till to-day<BR>
At the village of Kantan,<BR>
Strange to me save in name, my journey ends.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>I have travelled so fast that I am already come to the village of Kantan. Though the sun is still high, I will lodge here to-night. (<I>Knocking</I>.) May I come in?</P>
<P>HOSTESS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Who is it?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ROSEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I am a traveller; pray give me lodging for the night.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HOSTESS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Yes, I can give you lodging; pray come this way. You seem to be travelling all alone. Tell me where you have come from and where you are going.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ROSEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1 come from the land of Shoku. They tell me that on the Hill of the Flying Sheep there lives a sage; and I am visiting him that he may tell me by what rule I should conduct my life.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HOSTESS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>It is along way to the Hill of the Flying Sheep. Listen! A wizard once lodged here and gave us a marvellous pillow called the Pillow of Kantan: he who sleeps on it sees all his future in a moment's dream.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ROSEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Where is this pillow?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HOSTESS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>It is on the bed.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ROSEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I will go and sleep upon it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HOSTESS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And I meanwhile will heat you some millet at the fire.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ROSEI (<I>going to the bed</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>So this is the pillow, the Pillow of Kantan that I have heard such <A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A> strange tales of? Heaven has guided me to it, that I who came out t. learn the secret of life may taste the world in a dream.</P>
<P>As one whose course swift summer-rain has stayed,<BR>
Unthrifty of the noon he turned aside<BR>
To seek a wayside dream;<BR>
Upon the borrowed Pillow of Kantan<BR>
He laid his head and slept.</P>
<P>(<I>While </I>ROSEI<I> is still chanting these words, the </I>ENVOY<I> enters, followed by two </I>ATTENDANTS<I> who carry a litter. The </I>ENVOY<I> raps on the post of the bed</I>.)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ENVOY.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Rosei, Rosei! I must speak with you.</P>
<P>(ROSEI<I>, who has been lying with his fan over his face, rises when the </I>ENVOY<I> begins to speak</I>.)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ROSEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But who are you?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ENVOY.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I am come as a messenger to tell you that the Emperor of the Land of So&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> resigns his throne and commands that Rosei shall reign in his stead.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ROSEI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Unthinkable! I a king? But for what reason am I assigned this task?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ENVOY.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I cannot venture to determine. Doubtless there were found in your Majesty's countenance auspicious tokens, signs that you must rule the land. Let us lose no time; pray deign to enter this palanquin.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>ROSEI (<I>looking at the palanquin in astonishment</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>What thing is this? A litter spangled with a dew of shining stones? I am not wont to ride. Such splendour! Oh, little thought I <A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A></P>
<P>When first my weary feet trod unfamiliar roads<BR>
In kingly state to be borne to my journey's end.<BR>
is it to Heaven I ride?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>In jewelled palanquin<BR>
On the Way of Wisdom you are borne; here shall you learn<BR>
That the flower of glory fades like a moment's dream.<BR>
See, you are become a cloud-man of the sky.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

Rise up before you, Ab&#333;'s Hall, the Dragon's Tower;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
High over the tall clouds their moonlit gables gleam.<BR>
The light wells and wells like a rising tide.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
Oh splendid vision! A courtyard strewn<BR>
With golden and silver sand;<BR>
And they that at the four sides<BR>
Pass through the jewelled door are canopied<BR>
With a crown of woven light.<BR>
In the Cities of Heaven, in the home of Gods, I had thought,<BR>
Shine such still beams on walls of stone;<BR>
Never on palace reared by hands of men.<BR>
Treasures, a thousand kinds, ten thousand kinds,<BR>
Tribute to tribute joined, a myriad vassal-kings<BR>
Cast down before the Throne.<BR>
Flags of a thousand lords, ten thousand lords<BR>
Shine many-coloured in the sky,<BR>
And the noise of their wind-flapping<BR>
Rolls round the echoing earth.</P></DIR>
