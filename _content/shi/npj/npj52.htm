<P ALIGN="CENTER">BY KWANAMI OR SEAMI</P>
<P>T&#332;RU was a prince who built a great palace at Rokuj&#333;-kawara, near Ky&#333;to. In its grounds was a counterfeit of the bay of Naniwa, which was filled and emptied twice a day in imitation of the tides. Labourers toiled up from the sea-shore, which was many miles distant, carrying pails of salt water.</P>
<P>In the play a priest passing through Rokuj&#333;-kawara meets an old man carrying salt-water pails. It is the ghost of T&#333;ru. In the second part he rehearses the luxury and splendour of his life at the great palace Rokuj&#333;-kawara no In.</P>
