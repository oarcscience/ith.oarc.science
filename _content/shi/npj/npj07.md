# CHAPTER I.

### ATSUMORI, IKUTA, AND TSUNEMASA.

IN the eleventh century two powerful clans, the Taira and the Minamoto,
contended for mastery. In 1181 Kiyomori the chief of the Tairas died,
and from that time their fortunes declined. In 1183 they were forced to
flee from Kyōto, carrying with them the infant Emperor. After many
hardships and wanderings they camped on the shores of Suma, where they
were protected by their fleet.

Early in 1184 the Minamotos attacked and utterly routed them at the
Battle of Ichi-no-Tani, near the woods of Ikuta. At this battle fell
Atsumori, the nephew of Kiyomori, and his brother Tsunemasa.

When Kumagai, who had slain Atsumori, bent over him to examine the body,
he found lying beside him a bamboo-flute wrapped in brocade. He took the
flute and gave it to his son.

The bay of Suma is associated in the mind of a Japanese reader not only
with this battle but also with the stories of Prince Genji and Prince
Yukihira.
