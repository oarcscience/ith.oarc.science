<P>THESE three plays deal with the boyhood of the hero Yoshitsune, whose child-name was Ushiwaka.</P>
<I><P>Eboshi-ori</I> is a <I>genzai-mono</I>, that is to say a play which describes events actually in progress. In <I>Kumasaka</I> these same events are rehearsed by the ghost of one who participated in them. There are two other well-known Yoshitsune plays, <I>Funa-Benkei</I> and <I>Ataka</I>. In the former the phantoms of the dead Taira warriors attack the boat in which Yoshitsune and Benkei are riding; in the latter occurs the famous scene called the <I>Kwanjinch&#333;</I>, in which Benkei pretends to read out from a scroll a long document which he is in reality improvising on the spot. (See Mr. Sansom's translations of these two plays in the <I>Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan</I>, 1911.) The <I>Kwanjinch&#333;</I> was borrowed by the popular stage, and became one of the favourite "turns" of the great Danj&#363;r&#333; (1660-1703) and his successors.</P>
