<P>PRIEST.</P>
<P>I am a priest from Kiyosumi in Awa. I have never yet seen the country of Kai, so now I am minded to go there on pilgrimage.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>Describing the journey</I>.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>On the foam of white waves<BR>
From Kiyosumi in the land of Awa riding<BR>
To Mutsura I come; to the Hill of Kamakura,<BR>
Lamentably tattered, yet because the World<BR>
Is mine no longer, unashamed on borrowed bed,<BR>
Mattress of straw, to lie till the bell swings<BR>
Above my pillow. Away, away! For dawn<BR>
Is on the hemp-fields of Tsuru. Now the noonday sun<BR>
Hangs high above us as we cross the hills.<BR>
Now to the village of Isawa we come.<BR>
Let us lie down and rest awhile in the shelter of this shrine.</P></DIR>

<P>FISHER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>When the fisher's torch is quenched<BR>
What lamp shall guide him on the dark road that lies before?<BR>
Truly, if the World had tasked me hardly<BR>
I might be minded to leave it, but this bird-fishing,<BR>
Cruel though it be in the wanton taking of life away, <A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A><BR>
Is a pleasant trade to ply<BR>
Afloat on summer streams.</P>
<P>I have heard it told that Y&#363;shi and Hakuy&#333; vowed their love-vows<BR>
by the moon, and were changed to wedded stars of heaven. And<BR>
even to-day the high ones of the earth are grieved by moonless nights.<BR>
Only 1 grow weary of her shining and welcome nights of darkness.<BR>
But when the torches on the boats burn low,</P>
<P>Then, in the dreadful darkness comes repentance<BR>
Of the crime that is my trade,<BR>
My sinful sustenance; and life thus lived<BR>
Is loathsome then.<BR>
Yet I would live, and soon<BR>
Bent on my oar I push between the waves<BR>
To ply my hateful trade.</P>
<P>I will go up to the chapel as I am wont to do, and give my cormorants<BR>
rest. (<I>Seeing the</I> PRIESTS.) What, have travellers entered here?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>We are pilgrim-priests. We asked for lodging in the village. But they told us that it was not lawful for them to receive us, so we lay down in the shelter of this shrine.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FISHER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Truly, truly: I know of none in the village that could give you lodging.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Pray tell me, sir, what brings you here?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FISHER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Gladly. I am a cormorant-fisher. While the moon is shining I rest at this shrine; but when the moon sinks, I go to ply my trade.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then you will not mind our lodging here. But, sir, this work of slaughter ill becomes you; for I see that the years lie heavy on you. Pray leave this trade and find yourself another means of sustenance.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FISHER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>You say well. But this trade has kept me since I was a child. I cannot leave it now.</P>

<P>SECOND PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Listen. The sight of this man. has brought back something to my mind. Down this river there is a place they call Rock-tumble. And there, when I passed that way three years ago, I met just such a fisherman as this. And when I told him this cormorant-fishing was reckoned a sin against life, I think he listened; for he brought me back to his house and lodged me! with uncommon care.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FISHER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And you are the priest that came then?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SECOND PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Yes, I am he.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FISHER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>That cormorant-fisher died.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>How came he to die?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FISHER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Following his trade, more shame to him. Listen to his story and give his soul your prayers.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Gladly we will.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FISHER (<I>seats himself facing the audience and puts down his torch</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>You must know that on this river of Isawa, for a stretch of three leagues up stream and down, the killing of any living creature is forbidden. Now at that Rock-tumble you spoke of there were many cormorant-fishers who every night went secretly to their fishing. And the people of the place, hating the vile trade, made plans to catch them at their task. But he knew nothing of this; and one night he went there secretly and let his cormorants loose.</P>
<P>There was an ambush set for him; in a moment they were upon him. "Kill him!" they cried; "one life for many," was their plea. Then he pressed palm to palm. "Is the taking of life forbidden in this place? Had I but known it! But now, never again . . ." So with clasped hands he prayed and wept; but none helped him; and as fishers set their stakes they planted him deep in the stream. He cried, but no <A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A> sound came. (<I>Turning to the</I> PRIEST <I>suddenly</I>.) I am the ghost of that fisherman.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oh strange! If that be so, act out before me the tale of your repentance. Show me your sin and I will pray for you tenderly.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FISHER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I will act before your eyes the sin that binds me, the cormorant-fishing of those days. Oh give my soul your prayer!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I will.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>FISHER (<I>rising and taking up his torch</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The night is passing. It is fishing-time.<BR>
I must rehearse the sin that binds me.</P></DIR>

<P>I have read in tales of a foreign land&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
How sin-laden the souls of the dead<BR>
Have toiled at bitter tasks;<BR>

To see such penance done!</P></DIR>

Plunging, scooping,<BR>
Ceaselessly clutch their prey:<BR>
In the joy of capture<BR>
Forgotten sin and forfeit<BR>
Of the life hereafter!<BR>
Oh if these boiling waters would be still,<BR>
Then would the carp rise thick<BR>
As goldfinch in a bowl.<BR>
Look how the little <I>ayu</I> leap&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Playing in the shallow stream.<BR>
Hem them in: give them no rest!<BR>
Oh strange!<BR>
The torches burn still, but their light grows dim;<BR>
And I remember suddenly and am sad.<BR>
It is the hated moon!</P></DIR>

<P>I dip my hand in the shallows,<BR>
I gather pebbles in the stream.<BR>
I write Scripture upon them,<BR>
Upon each stone a letter of the Holy Law.<A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A><BR>
Now I cast them back into the waves and their drowned spell<BR>
