<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">NOTE ON TANIK&#332; AND IKENIYE.</H3>
<P>BOTH of these plays deal with the ruthless exactions of religion; in each the first part lends itself better to translation than the second. <I>Tanik&#333;</I> is still played; but <I>Ikeniye</I>, though printed by both Owada and Haga, has probably not been staged for many centuries.</P>
<P>The pilgrims of <I>Tanik&#333;</I> are <I>Yamabushi</I>, "mountaineers," to whom reference has been made on page <A HREF="npj06.htm#page_33">33</A>. They called themselves <I>Shugenja</I>, "portent-workers," and claimed to be the knight-errants of Buddhism. But their conduct seems to have differed little from that of the <I>S&#333;hei</I> (armed monks) who poured down in hordes from Mount Hiyei to terrorize the inhabitants of the surrounding country. Some one in the <I>Genji Monogatari</I> is said to have "collected a crowd of evil-looking Yamabushi, desperate, stick-at-nothing fellows."</P>
<I><P>Ikeniye</I>, the title of the second play, means "Pool Sacrifice," but also "Living Sacrifice," i. e. human sacrifice.</P>
