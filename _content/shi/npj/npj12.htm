<I><P>A PRIEST FROM THE CAPITAL.<BR>
A PRIEST OF AKASAKA (really the ghost of the robber KUMASAKA NO CHOHAN).<BR>
CHORUS</I>.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>These weary feet that found the World<BR>
Too sad to walk in, whither<BR>
Oh whither shall wandering lead them?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>I am a priest from the Capital. I have never seen the East Country, and now I am minded to go there on pilgrimage.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>He describes the journey, walking slowly round the stage</I>.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Over the mountains, down the &#332;mi road by a foam-flecked stream;<BR>
And through the woods of Awazu.<BR>
Over the long bridge of Seta<BR>
Heavily my footfall clangs.<BR>
In the bamboo-woods of Noji I await the dawn.<BR>
There where the Morning dew lies thick, over the Greenfield Plain,<BR>
Green in name only--for the leaves are red with autumn--<BR>
In evening sunshine to the village of Akasaka I am come!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>It is convenient to call him this, but he is the ghost of Kumasaka, appearing in the guise of a priest</I>.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Hey, you priest, I have something to say to you!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>What is it you would say to me?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A></P>
<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>To-day is some one's birthday. I beg of you to pray for the salvation of his soul.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I have left the World, and it is my business now to say such prayers; but of whom am I to think when I pray?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There is no need to know his name. He is buried in that tomb over there, among the rushes to this side of the pine-tree. It is because he cannot get free&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that he needs your prayers.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>No, no; it will not do. I cannot pray for him unless I know his name.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Pray, none the less. For it is written, "All the creatures of the world shall be profited.<BR>
There shall be no distinction."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>From dying and being born.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Deliver him, oh deliver him!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>For he that taketh a prayer unto himself<BR>
Even though his name be not named, if he receive it gladly,<BR>
Is the owner of the prayer.<BR>
Was not the promise made to the trees of the field,<BR>
To the soil of the land? Though the heart that Prays marks no name upon the prayer,<BR>
Yet shall it be heard.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then come back to my cottage with me and pass the night there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></P>
<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I will come.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>They go into the cottage, which is represented by a wicker framework at the front</I>.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Listen! I thought you were taking me to where there would be a chapel, so that I could begin my prayers. But here I ran see no painted picture nor carven image that I could put up. There is nothing on the wall but a great pike,--no handstaff, but only an iron crowbar; and other weapons of war are nailed up. What is the reason of this?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>You must know that when I first took the vows of priesthood I went round from village to village here, to Tarui, Anhaka and Akasaka--there is no end to them, but I know all the roads,--through the tall grass at Aono and the thick woods of Koyasu, night or day, rain or fine. For I was a hill-bandit in those days, a thief of the night, tilting baggage from mules' backs; even stripping servant-girls of their clothes, as they went from farm to farm, and leaving them sobbing.</P>
<P>Then it was that I used to take with me that pike there and waving it in their faces, "Stand and deliver!" I would cry.</P>
<P>But at last a time came when it was not so.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And after that time I was glad enough to find shelter even in such a place as this. I yielded my will and was content. For at last I had indeed resolved to leave the hateful World.</P>
<P>Oh petty prowess of those days!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>For hand of priest unfit indeed<BR>
Such deeds and weapons had I thought;<BR>
Yet among gods<BR>
Hath not the Lord Amida his sharp sword?<BR>
Doth not the King of Love&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Shoot arrows of salvation from his bow?<BR>
Tamon with tilted lance<BR>
Outbattled demons and hath swept away<BR>
All perils from the world.</P>

<DIR>

<P>Thoughts of love and pity<BR>
May be sins fouler</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Than the Five Faults of Datta;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And the taking of life for faith<BR>
Be holiness greater<BR>
Than the six virtues of Bosatsu.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
These things have I seen and heard.<BR>
But for the rest, is it not Thought alone<BR>
That either wanders in the trackless night<BR>
Of Error or awakes to the wide day?<BR>
"Master thy thoughts, or they will master thee,"<BR>
An ancient proverb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> says.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>Speaking for Kumasaka</I>.)</P>
<P>"But I must have done, or dawn will find me talking still. Go to your rest, Sir; and I too will doze awhile." So he spoke, and seemed to go into the bedroom. But suddenly the cottage vanished: nothing was left but the tall grass. It was under the shadow of a pine-tree that he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> had rested!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>There is usually an interlude to occupy the time while Kumasaka is changing his costume. An inhabitant of Akasaka tells stories of Kumasaka's exploits</I>.)</P>
<P>PRIEST.</P>
<P>I have seen strange things. I cannot sleep, no, not even for a while as little as the space between the antlers of a young stag. Under this autumn-winded pine-tree lying, all night long I will perform a service of chanted prayer.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></P>

<P><A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A> The wind is rising in the south-east. The clouds of the north are shifting; it is a dark night. A wild wind is sweeping the woods under the hill.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>See how the branches are heaving.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The moon does not rise till dawn to-night; and even when she rises she will be covered.</P>
<P>Send along the order for an assault!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>Recollecting himself</I>.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The whole heart divided between bow-hand and rein-hand,--oh the sin of it! For ever seizing another's treasure! Look, look on my misery, how my heart clings to the World!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>If you are Kumasaka himself, tell me the story of those days.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There was a merchant, a trafficker in gold, called Kichiji of the Third Ward. Each year he brought together a great store, and loading it in bales carried it up-country. And thinking to waylay him I summoned divers trusty men. . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Tell me the names of those that were chosen by you and the countries they came from.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There was Kakuj&#333; of Kawachi, and the brothers Surihari that had no rivals in fencing.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Well, and from within the City itself among many there were--</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There was Emon of the Third Ward and Kozaru of Mibu.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P><A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A></P>
<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Skilful torch-throwers; in broken-attack</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Their like will never be seen.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And from the North country, from Echizen</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There was Matsuwaka of Asau and Kur&#333; of Mikuni.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And from the country of Kaga, from Kumasaka</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There was this Ch&#333;han, the first of them, a great hand at deeds of villainy; and with him seventy men of the band.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>On all the roads where Kichiji might be passing, up hill and down dale on every halting-place they spied, till at last</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Here at the Inn of Akasaka we found him,--a fine place, with many roads leading from it. We set watch upon the place. The merchants had sent for women. From nightfall they feasted. They roystered the hours away--</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And at last, very late at night,<BR>
Kichiji and his brother, with no thought for safety,<BR>
Fell into a sodden sleep.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But there was with them a boy of sixteen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
He put his bright eye to a hole in the wall.<BR>
He did not make the least noise.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_66"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 66</FONT></A></P>
<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He did not sleep a wink.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Ushiwaka! We did not know he was there.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then the robbers, whose luck was run out,</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Thinking that the hour of fortune was come,</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Waited impatiently.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oh how long it seemed till at last the order came.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Dash in!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And, hurling their firebrands,<BR>
In they rushed, each jostling to be first,<BR>
More of them and more, in a wild onslaught.<BR>
Not even the God of Peril had dared to face them.<BR>
But little Ushiwaka showed no fear.<BR>
He drew his belt-sword and met them.<BR>
The Lion Pounce, The Tiger Leap, The Bird Pounce . . .&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
He parried them all. They thrust at him but could not prevail.<BR>
Thirteen there were who attacked him;<BR>
And now, done to death, on the same pillow head to head they lie.<BR>
And others, wounded, have flung down their swords and slunk back weaponless,<BR>
Stripped of all else but life.<BR>
Then Kumasaka cried: "What demon or god can he be<BR>
Under whose hand all these have fallen? For a man he cannot be!<BR>
But even robbers need their lives! This is no work for me; I will withdraw."<BR>
And slinging his pike, slowly he turned to go.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A></P>
<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I was thinking.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He was thinking as he went,<BR>
"Though this stripling slash so bravely,<BR>
Yet should Kumasaka employ his secret art,--<BR>
Then though the boy be ogre or hobgoblin,<BR>
Waist-strangled he would be pressed to dust."<BR>
"I will avenge the fallen," he cried, and, turning back,<BR>
He levelled his pike ;and sheltered behind the wattled door,<BR>
Waiting for the urchin to come.<BR>
Ushiwaka saw him, and drawing his sword held it close to his side,<BR>
Stood apart and watched. But Kumasaka too stood with his pike ready.<BR>
Each was waiting for the other to spring.<BR>
Then Kumasaka lost patience. He lunged with his left foot and with his pike<BR>
Struck a blow that would have pierced an iron wall.<BR>
But Ushiwaka parried it lightly and sprang to the left.<BR>
Kumasaka was after him in a moment, and as he sprang nimbly over the pike,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Turned the point towards him.<BR>
But as he drew back the pike, Ushiwaka crossed to the right.<BR>
Then levelling the pike, Kumasaka struck a great blow.<BR>
This time the boy parried it with a blow that disengaged them,<BR>
And springing into the air leapt hither and thither with invisible speed.<BR>
And while the robber sought him,<BR>
The wonderful boy pranced behind and stuck his sword through a chink in his coat of mail.<BR>
"Hey, what is that?" cried Kumasaka. "Has this urchin touched me?"<BR>
And he was very angry.<BR>
But soon Heaven's fatal ordinance was sealed by despair:<BR>
"This sword-play brings me no advantage," he cried; "I will wrestle with him."<BR>
Then he threw away his pike, and spreading out his great hands, <A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A><BR>
Down this corridor and into this corner he chased him, but when he would have grasped him,<BR>
Like lightning, mist, moonlight on the water,--<BR>
The eye could see, but the hand could not touch.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I was wounded again and again.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He was wounded many times, till the fierce strength of his spirit weakened and weakened. Like dew upon the moss that grows.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KUMASAKA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Round the foot of this pine-tree</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Are vanished the men of this old tale.<BR>
"Oh, help me to be born to happiness."</P></DIR>
