<P>We who on shallow hills&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> have built our home<BR>

<P>In a dream-lull our lives are passed; all, all<BR>
That round us lies<BR>
Is visionary, void.<BR>
Yet got we by rare fortune at our birth<BR>
Man's shape, that is hard to get;<BR>
And dearer gift was given us, harder to win,<BR>
The doctrine of Buddha, seed of our Salvation.<BR>
And me this only thought possessed,<BR>
How I might bring that seed to blossom, till at last<BR>
I drew this sombre cassock across my back.<BR>
And knowing now the lives before my birth,<BR>
No love I owe<BR>
To those that to this life engendered me,<BR>
Nor seek a care (have I not disavowed<BR>
Such hollow bonds?) from child by me begot.<BR>
A thousand leagues<BR>
Is little road <A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A><BR>

Should the tide entice,<BR>
I would come, I think; but now<BR>
No wave asks; no stream stirs.<BR>
Long ago I was full of pride;<BR>
Crowned with nodding tresses, halcyon locks,<BR>
I walked like a young willow delicately wafted<BR>
By the winds of Spring.<BR>
I spoke with the voice of a nightingale that has sipped the dew.<BR>
I was lovelier than the petals of the wild-rose open-stretched<BR>
In the hour before its fall.<BR>
But now I am grown loathsome even to sluts,<BR>
Poor girls of the people, and they and all men<BR>
Turn scornful from me.<BR>
Unhappy months and days pile up their score;<BR>
I am old; old by a hundred years.<BR>
In the City I fear men's eyes,<BR>
And at dusk, lest they should cry "Is it she?"<BR>
Westward with the moon I creep<BR>
From the cloud-high City of the Hundred Towers.<BR>
No guard will question, none challenge<BR>
Pilgrim so wretched: yet must I he walking<BR>
Hid ever in shadow of the trees.<BR>
Past the Lovers' Tomb,<BR>
And the Hill of Autumn<BR>
To the River of Katsura, the boats, the moonlight.</P></DIR>

Three times did homage before her.</P></DIR>

To crown her head?<BR>
Where are gone the lovely locks, double-twined,<BR>
The coils of jet?<BR>
Lank wisps, scant curls wither now<BR>
On wilted flesh;<BR>
And twin-arches, moth-brows tinge no more<BR>
With the hue of far hills. "Oh cover, cover<BR>
From the creeping light of dawn<BR>
Silted seaweed locks that of a hundred years<BR>
Lack now but one.<BR>
Oh hide me from my shame."</P></DIR>
