<P>"All men are sinners." What have I to fear<BR>
More than the rest?<BR>
My name is Kiyoyori the Bird-Catcher. I was very well known on <A NAME="page_256"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 256</FONT></A> the Terrestrial Plane. But the span of my years came to its appointed close; I was caught in the Wind of Impermanence; and here I am, marching to the Sunless Land.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a pang I leave the world where I was wont to dwell,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temporal World.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whither, oh whither have my feet carried me?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Six Ways already I have come.<BR>
Why, here I am already at the meeting of the Six Ways of Existence. I think on the whole I'll go to Heaven.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>DEMON.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Haha! That smells like a man. Why, sure enough here's a sinner coming. We must report him. (<I>To</I> YAMA.) Please, sir, here's the first sinner arrived already!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YAMA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then bustle him to Hell at once.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>DEMON.</P>
<DIR><DIR><P>"Hell is ever at hand,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> which is more than<BR>
Can he said of Heaven. (<I>Seizing</I> KIYOYORI.)<BR>
Come on, now, come on! (KIYOYORI <I>resists</I>.)<BR>
Yai! yai!<BR>
Let me tell you, you're showing a great<BR>
Deal more spirit than most sinners do.<BR>
What was your job when you were on the<BR>
Terrestrial Plane?</P></DIR></DIR>
<P>KIYOYORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I was Kiyoyori, the famous bird-catcher.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>DEMON.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Bird-catcher? That's bad. Taking life from morning to night. That's very serious, you know. I am afraid you will have to go to Hell.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KIYOYORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Really, I don't consider I'm as had as all that. I should be very much obliged if you would let me go to Heaven.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>KYOGEN 257</P>
<P>DEMON.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>We must ask King Yama about this. (<I>To</I> YAMA.) Please sir--!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YAMA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Well, what is it?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>DEMON.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>It's like this. The sinner says that on the Terrestrial Plane he was a well-known bird-catcher. Now that means taking life all the time; it's a serious matter, and he certainly ought to go to Hell. But when we told him so, he said we'd entirely misjudged him.</P>
<P>What had we better do about it?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YAMA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>You'd better send him to me.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>DEMON.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Very well. (<I>To</I> KIYOYORI.) Come along, King Yama says he'll see you himself.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KIYOYORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I'm coming.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>DEMON.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Here's that sinner you sent for.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YAMA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Listen to me, you sinner. I understand that when you were in the world you spent your whole time snaring birds. You are a very bad man and must go to Hell at once.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KIYOYORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>That's all very well. But the birds I caught were sold to gentlemen to feed their falcons on; so there was really no harm in it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YAMA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Falcon" is another kind of bird, isn't it?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KIYOYORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Yes, that's right.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P><A NAME="page_258"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A></P>
<P>YAMA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Well then, I really don't see that there was much harm in it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KIYOYORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I see you take my view. It was the falcons who were to blame, not I. That being so, I should be very much obliged if you would allow me to go straight to Heaven.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YAMA (<I>reciting in the N&#333; style</I>.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then the great King of Hell<BR>
Because, though on the Hill of Death<BR>
Many birds flew, he had not tasted one,<BR>
"Come, take your pole," he cried, and here and now<BR>
Give us a demonstration of your art.<BR>
Then go in peace.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KIYOYORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Nothing could be simpler.<BR>
I will catch a few birds and present them to you.<BR>
Then he took his pole, and crying<BR>
"To the hunt, to the hunt! . . ."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"To the bird-hunt," he cried,<BR>
And suddenly from the steep paths of the southern side of the Hill of Death<BR>
Many birds came flying.<BR>
Then swifter than sight his pole<BR>
Darted among them.<BR>
"I will roast them," he cried.<BR>
And when they were cooked,<BR>
"Please try one," and he offered them to the King.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YAMA (<I>greedily</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Let me eat it, let me eat it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>Eats, smacking his lips</I>.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Well! I must say they taste uncommonly good!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KIYOYORI (<I>to the</I> DEMONS).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Perhaps you would like to try some?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P><A NAME="page_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A></P>
<P>DEMONS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oh, thank you! (<I>They eat greedily and snatch</I>.) I want that bit! No, it's mine! What a flavour!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YAMA.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I never tasted anything so nice. You have given us such a treat that I am going to send you back to the world to go on bird-catching for another three years.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>KIYOYORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I am very much obliged to you, I'm sure.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>You shall catch many birds,<BR>
Pheasant, pigeon, heron and stork.<BR>
They shall not elude you, but fall<BR>
Fast into the fatal snare.<BR>
So he, reprieved, turned back towards the World;<BR>
But Yama, loth to see him go, bestowed<BR>
A jewelled crown, which Kiyoyori bore<BR>
Respectfully to the Terrestrial Plane,<BR>
There to begin his second span of life.</P>
