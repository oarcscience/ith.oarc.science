<P>PERSONS</P>
<I><P>THE PRIEST RENSEI (formerly the warrior Kumagai).<BR>
A YOUNG REAPER, who turns out to be the ghost of Atsumori.<BR>
HIS COMPANION.<BR>
CHORUS</I>.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Life is a lying dream, he only wakes<BR>
Who casts the World aside.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>I am Kumagai no Naozane, a man of the country of Musashi. I have left my home and call myself the priest Rensei; this I have done because of my grief at the death of Atsumori, who fell in battle by my hand. Hence it comes that I am dressed in priestly guise.</P>
<P>And now I am going down to Ichi-no-Tani to pray for the salvation of Atsumori's soul.</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(<I>He walks slowly across the stage, singing a song descriptive of his journey</I>.)</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>I have come so fast that here I am already at Ichi-no-Tani, in the country of Tsu.</P>
<P>Truly the past returns to my mind as though it were a thing of to-day.</P>
<P>But listen! I hear the sound of a flute coming from a knoll of rising ground. I will wait here till the flute-player passes, and ask him to tell me the story of this place.</P>
<P>REAPERS (<I>together</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>To the music of the reaper's flute<BR>
No song is sung<BR>
But the sighing of wind in the fields.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YOUNG REAPER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>They that were reaping,<BR>
Reaping on that hill,<A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A><BR>
Walk now through the fields<BR>
Homeward, for it is dusk.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>REAPERS (<I>together</I>).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Short is the way that leads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
From the sea of Suma back to my home.<BR>
This little journey, up to the hill<BR>
And down to the shore again, and up to the hill,--<BR>
This is my life, and the sum of hateful tasks.<BR>
If one should ask me<BR>
I too&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> would answer<BR>
That on the shores of Suma<BR>
I live in sadness.<BR>
Yet if any guessed my name,<BR>
Then might I too have friends.<BR>
But now from my deep misery<BR>
Even those that were dearest<BR>
Are grown estranged. Here must I dwell abandoned<BR>
To one thought's anguish:<BR>
That I must dwell here.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Hey, you reapers! I have a question to ask you.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YOUNG REAPER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Is it to us you are speaking? What do you wish to know?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Was it one of you who was playing on the flute just now?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YOUNG REAPER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Yes, it was we who were playing.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>It was a pleasant sound, and all the pleasanter because one does not look for such music from men of your condition.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>YOUNG REAPER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Unlocked for from men of our condition, you say! Have you not read:--</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>

<P>

<P><A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A></P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Do not envy what is above you<BR>
Nor despise what is below you"?<BR>
Moreover the songs of woodmen and the flute-playing of herdsmen,<BR>
Flute-playing even of reapers and songs of wood-fellers<BR>
Through poets' verses are known to all the world.<BR>
Wonder not to hear among us<BR>
The sound of a bamboo-flute.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>You are right. Indeed it is as you have told me.<BR>
Songs of woodmen and flute-playing of herdsmen . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>REAPER.</P>
<P>Flute-playing of reapers . . .</P>
<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Songs of wood-fellers</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>REAPERS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Guide us on our passage through this sad world.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Song . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>REAPER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And dance</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And the flute . . .</P>
<P>And music of many instruments . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>REAPER.</P>
<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>These are the pastimes that each chooses to his taste.<BR>
Of floating bamboo-wood<BR>
Many are the famous flutes that have been made;<BR>
Little-Branch and Cicada-Cage,<BR>
And as for the reaper's flute,<BR>
Its name is Green-leaf;<BR>
On the shore of Sumiyoshi<BR>
The Corean flute they play.<A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A><BR>
And here on the shore of Suma<BR>
On Stick of the Salt-kilns<BR>
The fishers blow their tune.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>How strange it is! The other reapers have all gone home, but you alone stay loitering here. How is that?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>REAPER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>How is it, you ask? I am seeking for a prayer in the voice of the evening waves. Perhaps you will pray the Ten Prayers for me?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I can easily pray the Ten Prayers for you, if you will tell me who you are.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>REAPER.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>To tell you the truth--I am one of the family of Lord Atsumori.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>One of Atsumori's family? How glad I am!<BR>
Then the priest joined his hands (<I>he kneels down</I>) and prayed:--</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">NAMU AMIDABU.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Praise to Amida Buddha!</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"If I attain to Buddhahood,<BR>
In the whole world and its ten spheres<BR>
Of all that dwell here none shall call on my name<BR>
And be rejected or cast aside."</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Oh, reject me not!<BR>
One cry suffices for salvation,<BR>
Yet day and night<BR>
Your prayers will rise for me.<BR>
Happy am I, for though you know not my name,<BR>
Yet for my soul's deliverance<BR>
At dawn and dusk henceforward I know that you will pray."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>So he spoke. Then vanished and was seen no more.</P>
<P>(<I>Here follows the Interlude between the two Acts, in which a recitation concerning Atsumori's death takes place. These</I> <A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A> <I>interludes are subject to variation and are not considered part of the literary text of the play</I>.)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Since this is so, I will perform all night the rites of prayer for the dead, and calling upon Amida's name will pray again for the salvation of Atsumori.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>The ghost of</I> ATSUMORI<I> appears, dressed as a young warrior</I>.)</P>
<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Would you know who I am<BR>
That like the watchmen at Suma Pass<BR>
Have wakened at the cry of sea-birds roaming<BR>
Upon Awaji shore?<BR>
Listen, Rensei. I am Atsumori.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>How strange! All this while I have never stopped beating my gong and performing the rites of the Law. I cannot for a moment have dozed, yet I thought that Atsumori was standing before me. Surely it was a dream.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Why need it be a dream? It is to clear the karma of my waking life that I am come here in visible form before you.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Is it not written that one prayer will wipe away ten thousand sins? Ceaselessly I have performed the ritual of the Holy Name that clears all sin away. After such prayers, what evil can be left? Though you should be sunk in sin as deep . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>As the sea by a rocky shore,<BR>
Yet should I be salved by prayer.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And that my prayers should save you . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>This too must spring <A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A><BR>
From kindness of a former life.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Once enemies . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But now . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>In truth may we be named . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Friends in Buddha's Law.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There is a saying, "Put away from you a wicked friend; summon to your side a virtuous enemy." For you it was said, and you have proven it true.</P>
<P>And now come tell with us the tale of your confession, while the night is still dark.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> bids the flowers of Spring<BR>
Mount the tree-top that men may raise their eyes<BR>
And walk on upward paths;<BR>
He bids the moon in autumn waves be drowned<BR>
In token that he visits laggard men<BR>
And leads them out from valleys of despair.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Now the clan of Taira, building wall to wall,<BR>
Spread over the earth like the leafy branches of a great tree:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Yet their prosperity lasted but for a day;<BR>
It was like the flower of the convolvulus.<BR>
There was none to tell them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> <A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A></P>
<P>That glory flashes like sparks from flint-stone,<BR>
And after,--darkness.<BR>
Oh wretched, the life of men!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>When they were on high they afflicted the humble;<BR>
When they were rich they were reckless in pride.<BR>
And so for twenty years and more<BR>
They ruled this land.<BR>
But truly a generation passes like the space of a dream.<BR>
The leaves of the autumn of Juyei&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Were tossed by the four winds;<BR>
Scattered, scattered (like leaves too) floated their ships.<BR>
And they, asleep on the heaving sea, not even in dream<BR>
Went back to home.<BR>
Caged birds longing for the clouds,--<BR>
Wild geese were they rather, whose ranks are broken<BR>
As they fly to southward on their doubtful journey.<BR>
So days and months went by; Spring came again<BR>
And for a little while<BR>
Here dwelt they on the shore of Suma<BR>
At the first valley.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
From the mountain behind us the winds blew down<BR>
Till the fields grew wintry again.<BR>
Our ships lay by the shore, where night and day<BR>
The sea-gulls cried and salt waves washed on our sleeves.<BR>
We slept with fishers in their buts<BR>
On pillows of sand.<BR>
We knew none but the people of Suma.<BR>
And when among the pine-trees<BR>
The evening smoke was rising,<BR>
Brushwood, as they call it,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
Brushwood we gathered<BR>
And spread for carpet.<BR>
Sorrowful we lived<BR>
On the wild shore of Suma,<BR>
Till the clan Taira and all its princes<BR>
Were but villagers of Suma.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A></P>
<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But on the night of the sixth day of the second month<BR>
My father Tsunemori gathered us together.<BR>
"To-morrow," he said, "we shall fight our last fight.<BR>
To-night is all that is left us."<BR>
We sang songs together, and danced.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Yes, I remember; we in our siege-camp<BR>
Heard the sound of music<BR>
Echoing from your tents that night,;<BR>
There was the music of a flute . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The bamboo-flute! I wore it when I died.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>We heard the singing . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Songs and ballads . . .</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Many voices</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Singing to one measure.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(ATSUMORI <I>dances</I>.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>First comes the Royal Boat.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The whole clan has put its boats to sea.<BR>
He&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> will not be left behind;<BR>
He runs to the shore.<BR>
But the Royal Boat and the soldiers' boats<BR>
Have sailed far away.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>ATSUMORI.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>What can he do? <A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A><BR>
He spurs his horse into the waves.<BR>
He is full of perplexity. And then</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He looks behind him and sees<BR>
That Kumagai pursues him;<BR>
He cannot escape.<BR>
Then Atsumori turns his horse<BR>
Knee-deep in the lashing waves,<BR>
And draws his sword.<BR>
Twice, three times he strikes; then, still saddled,<BR>
In close fight they twine; roll headlong together<BR>
Among the surf of the shore.<BR>
So Atsumori fell and was slain, but now the Wheel of Fate<BR>
Has turned and brought him back.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(ATSUMORI <I>rises from the ground and advances toward the</I> PRIEST <I>with uplifted sword</I>.)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"There is my enemy," he cries, and would strike,<BR>
But the other is grown gentle<BR>
And calling on Buddha's name<BR>
Has obtained salvation for his foe;<BR>
So that they shall be re-born together<BR>
On one lotus-seat.<BR>
"No, Rensei is not my enemy.<BR>
Pray for me again, oh pray for me again."</P></DIR>
