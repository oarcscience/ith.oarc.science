<P>No whence nor whither know I, only onward,<BR>

<P>I am a holy man of no fixed abode. I have been travelling through the land of Shinano; but the snow lies thick. I had best go up to Kamakura now and wait there. When Spring comes I will set out upon my pilgrimage.</P>

<P>Land of Shinano, Peak of Asama,<BR>
Thy red smoke rising far and near! Yet cold<BR>
Blows the great wind whose breath<BR>
From Greatwell Hill is fetched.<BR>
On to the Village of Friends--but friendless I,<BR>
Whose self is cast aside, go up the path<BR>
Of Parting Hill, that from the temporal world<BR>
Yet further parts me. Down the river, down<BR>
Runs my swift raft plank-nosed to Plank-nose Inn,<BR>
And to the Ford of Sano I am come.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>I have travelled so fast that I am come to the Ford of Sano in the country of K&#333;zuke. Ara! It is snowing again. I must seek shelter here. (Goes to the wing and knocks.) Is there anyone in this house?</P>

<P>Ah! How the snow falls! Long ago when I was in the World&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I loved to see it:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hither and thither the snow blew like feathers plucked from a goose;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long, long I watched it fall, till it dressed me in a white coat."<BR>
So I sang; and the snow that falls now is the same that I saw then. But I indeed am frost-white&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that watch it!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh how shall this thin dress of Kefu-cloth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chase from my bones the winter of to-day,<BR>

<DIR>

<P>I would gladly ask you to stay, but there is scarce space for us two, that are husband and wife. How can we give you lodging? At the village of Yamamoto yonder, ten furlongs further, you will find a good inn. You had best be on your way before the daylight goes.</P></DIR>

<P>Alas, it is because in a former life we neglected the ordinances&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that we are now come to ruin.

<P>If you are of that mind, why did you not speak before? (<I>Looking after the</I> PRIEST.) No, he cannot have gone far in this great snowstorm. I will go after him and stop him. Hie, traveller, hie! We will give you lodging. Hie! The snow is falling so thick that he cannot hear me. What a sad plight he is in. Old-fallen snow covers the way he came and snow new-fallen hides the path where he should go. Look, look! He is standing still. He is shaking the snow from his clothes; shaking, shaking. It is like that old song:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"At Sano Ferry<BR>
No shelter found we<BR>
To rest our horses,<BR>
Shake our jackets,<BR>
In the snowy twilight."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>That song was made at Sano Ferry,<BR>
At the headland of Miwa on the Yamato Way.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But now at Sano on the Eastern Way<BR>
Would you wander weary in the snow of twilight?<BR>
Though mean the lodging,<BR>
Rest with us, oh rest till day!</P></DIR>

<P>Listen. We have given him lodging, but have not laid the least thing before him. Is there nothing we can give?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>WIFE.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>It happens that we have a little boiled millet;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> we can give him that if he will take it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I will tell him. (<I>To the</I> PRIEST.) I have given you lodging, but I have not yet laid anything before you. It happens that we have a little boiled millet. It is coarse food, but pray eat it if you can.</P></DIR>

<DIR>

<P>I will do so.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Long ago when I was in the World I knew nothing of this stuff called millet but what I read of it in poems and songs. But now it is the prop of my life.</P>
<P>Truly Rosei's dream of fifty years' glory<BR>
That he dreamed at K&aacute;nt&aacute;n on lent pillow propped<BR>
Was dreamed while millet cooked, as yonder dish now.<BR>
Oh if I might but sleep as he slept, and see in my dream<BR>
Times that have passed away, then should I have comfort;<BR>
But now through battered walls</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Cold wind from the woods<BR>
Blows sleep away and the dreams of recollection.</P><DIR>

</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>How cold it is! And as the night passes, each hour the frost grows keener. If I had but fuel to light a fire with, that you might sit by it and warm yourself! Ah! I have thought of something. I have some dwarf trees. I will cut them down and make a fire of them.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Have you indeed dwarf trees?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Yes, when I was in the World I had a fine show of them; but when my trouble came I had no more heart for tree-fancying, and gave them away. But three of them, I kept,--plum, cherry and pine. Look, there they are, covered with snow. They are precious to me; yet for this night's entertainment I will gladly set light to them.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>No, no, that must not be. I thank you for your kindness, but it <A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A> is likely that one day you will go back to the World again and need them for your pleasure. Indeed it is not to be thought of.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>My life is like a tree the earth has covered;<BR>
I shoot no blossoms upward to the world.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>WIFE.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And should we burn for you<BR>
These shrubs, these profitless toys,</P></DIR>

<P>Then he brushed the snow from off them, and when he looked,<BR>
"I cannot, cannot," he cried, "O beautiful trees,<BR>
Must I begin?<BR>
You, plum-tree, among bare boughs blossoming<BR>
Hard by the window, still on northward face<BR>
Snow-sealed, yet first to scent<BR>
Cold air with flowers, earliest of Spring;<BR>
'You first shall fall.'<BR>
You by whose boughs on mountain hedge entwined<BR>
Dull country folk have paused and caught their breath,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A><BR>

1, 1 am lonely left, and you, cut down,<BR>

</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>You now, O pine, whose branches I had thought<BR>
One day when you were old to lop and trim,<BR>
Standing you in the field, a football-post,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Such use shall never know.<BR>
Tree, whom the winds have ever wreathed<BR>
With quaking mists, now shimmering in the flame<BR>
Shall burn and burn.<BR>
Now like a beacon, sentinels at night<BR>
Kindle by palace gate to guard a king,<BR>
Your fire burns brightly.<BR>
Come, warm yourself.</P></DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Now we have a good fire and can forget the cold.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>It is because you lodged with us that we too have a fire to sit by.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There is something I must ask you: I would gladly know to what clan my host belongs.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I am not of such birth; I have no clan-name.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Say what you will, I cannot think you a commoner. The times may change; what harm will you get by telling me your clan?</P></DIR>

<P><A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A></P>
<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Indeed I have no reason to conceal it. Know then that Tsuneyo Genzayemon, Lord of Sano, is sunk to this!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>How came it, sir, that you fell to such misery?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Thus it was: kinsmen usurped my lands, and so I became what am.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Why do you not go up to the Capital and lay your case before the Shikken's court?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>By further mischance it happens that Lord Saimy&#333;ji&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> himself is absent upon pilgrimage. And yet not all is lost; for on the wall a tall spear still hangs, and armour with it; while in the stall a steed is tied. And if at any time there came from the City news of peril to our master--</P>
<P>Then, broken though it be I would gird this armour on,<BR>
And rusty though it be I would hold this tall spear,<BR>
And lean-ribbed though he be I would mount my horse and ride<BR>
Neck by neck with the swiftest,<BR>
To write my name on the roll.<BR>
And when the fight began<BR>
Though the foe were many, yet would I be the first<BR>
To cleave their ranks, to choose an adversary<BR>
To fight with him and die.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>He covers his face with his hands; his voice sinks again</I>.)</P><DIR>

<P>Take courage; you shall not end so. If I live, I will come to you again. Now I go.</P></DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO and WIFE.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>We cannot let you go. At first we were ashamed that you should <A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A> see the misery of our dwelling; but now we ask you to stay with us awhile.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Were I to follow my desire, think you I would soon go forth into the snow?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO and WIFE.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>After a day of snow even the clear sky is cold, and to-night--</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>PRIEST.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Where shall I lodge?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>WIFE.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Stay with us this one day.</P></DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO and WIFE.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>You leave us?</P></DIR>

<P>Farewell, Tsuneyo!</P></DIR>

<P>BOTH.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Come back to us again.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS (<I>speaking for</I> PRIEST).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"And should you one day come up to the City, seek for me there. A humble priest can give you no public furtherance, yet can he find ways to bring you into the presence of Authority. Do not give up your suit." He said no more. He went his way,--he sad to leave them and they to lose him from their sight.</P></DIR>

<P>Hie, you travellers! Is it true that the levies are marching to <A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A> Kamakura? They are marching in great force, you say? So it is true. Barons and knights from the Eight Counties of the East all riding to Kamakura! A fine sight it will be. Tasselled breastplates of beaten silver; swords and daggers fretted with gold. On horses fat with fodder they ride; even the grooms of the relay-horses are magnificently apparelled. And along with them (<I>miming the action of leading a horse</I>) goes Tsuneyo, with horse, armour and sword that scarce seem worthy of such names. They may laugh, yet I am not, I think, a worse man than they; and had I but a steed to match my heart, then valiantly--(<I>making the gesture of cracking a whip</I>) you laggard!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P>
<P>The horse is old, palsied as a willow-bough; it cannot hasten. It is lean and twisted. Not whip or spur can move it. It sticks like a coach in a bog. He follows far behind the rest.</P>

And rusty though it be, I would hold this tall spear,<BR>
And bony though he be, I would mount my horse and ride<BR>
Neck by neck with the swiftest."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>These were not vain words; you have come valiantly. But know that this levy of men was made to this purpose: to test the issue of your words whether they were spoken false or true; and to hear the suits of all those that have obeyed my summons, that if any among them have suffered injury, his wrongs may be righted.</P>
<P>And first in the case of Tsuneyo, I make judgment. To him shall be returned his lawful estate, thirty parishes in the land of Sano.</P>
<P>But above all else one thing shall never be forgotten, that in the great snowstorm he cut down his trees, his treasure, and burnt them for firewood. And now in gratitude for the three trees of that time--plum, cherry and pine,--we grant to him three fiefs, Plumfield in Kaga, Cherrywell in Etch&#363; and Pine-branch in K&#333;zuke.</P>
<P>He shall hold them as a perpetual inheritance for himself and for his heirs; in testimony whereof we give this title-deed, by our own hand signed and sealed, together with the safe possession of his former lands.</P></DIR>

<P>"Look, all you barons! (TSUNEYO <I>holds up the documents</I>.)<BR>
Look upon this sight<BR>
And scorn to envy turn!"<BR>
Then the levies of all the lands<BR>
Took leave of their Lord<BR>
And went their homeward way.</P></DIR>

<P>TSUNEYO.</P><DIR>

<P>CHORUS.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Among them Tsuneyo,<BR>
Joy breaking on his brow,<BR>
Rides now on splendid steed<BR>
To the Boat-bridge of Sano, to his lands once torn<BR>
Pitiless from him as the torrent tears<BR>
That Bridge of Boats at Sano now his own.</P>
