YUYA

TAIRA NO MUNEMORI had long detained at the Capital his mistress Yuya,
whose aged mother continually besought him to send back her daughter to
her for a little while, that she might see her before she died. In the
illustration she is shown reading a letter in which her mother begs her
to return.

Munemori insisted that Yuya should stay with him till the Spring
pageants were over; but all their feasting and flower-viewing turned to
sadness, and in the end he let Yuya go home.
