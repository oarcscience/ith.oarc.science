# CHAPTER XI

### WOMAN'S SECRETS

"Search not to find what lies too deeply hid,  
Nor to know things whose knowledge is forbid.:  
DENHAM.

"TO a woman and a magpie tell what you would speak in the market-place,"
runs the Spanish proverb--the reason being that "a woman only keeps a
secret what she does not know;" and therefore an old Latin maxim
solemnly enjoins us "not to trust a woman even when dead." Thus Hotspur
tells his wife in "I Henry IV." (act ii. sc. 3):--

"Constant you are,  
But yet a woman, and for secrecy  
No lady closer; for I well believe  
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know,  
And so far I will trust thee, gentle Kate;"

which, in other words, is equivalent to the well-known German adage, "A
woman can't keep a secret, nor let any one else do it." But this

maxim cannot be applied only to women, for, as it has been often
remarked of secrets, both political and social, they are only too
frequently made to be revealed, a truth illustrated by Bell Jonson's
words in "The Case is Unaltered," wherein we find this passage:--

"A secret in his mouth  
Is like a wild bird put into a cage,  
Whose door no sooner opens but 'tis out."

But, whatever dependence is to be placed on a woman's reliability to
keep to herself what is told in confidence, it has often been remarked
that she can at least keep her own secret, a proof of which will be
quickly found if any one question her on the subject of her age.

Apart from this exception, a secret in the keeping of a woman soon
becomes what the Spanish are accustomed to call, "The Secret of
Anchuelos," that is, one which is known to every one. The town of that
name is situated in a gorge between two steep hills, on one of which a
shepherd tended his flock, on the other a shepherdess. This pair kept up
all amorous converse by bawling from hill to hill, but always with many
mutual strict injunctions of secrecy.

The inability of a woman to keep silent what is told her in
confidence--even where her husband be concerned--is exemplified in the
once popular "He that tells his wife is but lately married"--her
indiscretion in disclosing information entrusted to her only too
frequently causing serious mischief; with which be compared the Tamil
proverb, "Do not disclose your secret to your wife, nor trust your enemy
at any time."

But "A wise woman hath a close mouth," which has its equivalent in the
French saying, "Le plus sage se tait." According to another popular
adage, "Discreet women have neither eyes nor ears," which also has its
French parallel, "La femme de bien n'a ny yeux ny orelles."

A piece of proverbial lore which applies to each sex is this: "Tell your
secret to your servant and you make him your master"--a maxim which may
be traced to an early period when, says Kelly, "it was the policy of the
Greek adventurers in Rome to worm out the secrets of the house, and so
make themselves feared." Juvenal has referred to this practice:--

"Poor simple Corydon! do you suppose  
Aught is kept secret that a rich man does?  
If servants hold their tongues, the beasts will blab,  
The dog, the door-posts, and the marble-slab."

Similarly, we find the same proverb on the Continent, "To whom you tell
your secret you surrender your freedom;" or, according to another
version, "Tell your friend your secret, and he will set his foot on your
throat." And it may be remembered Dryden has introduced the same idea:--

"He who trusts a secret to his servant,  
Makes his own man his master."

African folk-lore, too, introduces the same idea, and a popular proverb
says, "If a man tells his secrets to his wife, she will bring him into
the way of Satan," which, it has been remarked, is rather a strong
contrast to the English proverb, "He who would thrive must ask his
wife." And again, it is said, "Trust your dog to the end, a woman till
the first opportunity."

As might be supposed, folk-lore, at one time or another, has made good
use of the value attaching to secrets; and stories of the supernatural
in romantic fiction have shown how the fair sex, under the influence of
magical influences, have unknowingly revealed the most sacred secrets.
But the moral of most of these tales is the same--and may be applied to
either sex--the lesson conveyed being not to trust any one; for, as the
French say, "the disclosure of a secret is the fault of him who first
disclosed it"--a truth, indeed, which is only too constantly verified in
daily life by mistaken trust in another.

Women, it is said, forget the important fact that as soon as a secret
becomes the property of three persons it is all the world's, which is
summed up in a common Spanish adage, "What three knows every creature
knows;" whereas according to the French proverb, "The secret of two is
God's secret." The same idea also exists in West Africa, where this
proverb is current:" Trust not a woman; she will tell thee what she has
just told her companion," and "Whatever be thy intimacy, never give thy
heart to a woman."

Turning to some of the numerous folk-tales and legendary stories, in
which "the secret" plays the important part, there is the famous one of
Melusine, which has been told in many ways. Raymond, Count of Lusignan,
was one day hunting the boar in the forest of Poitou, when, whilst
wandering in the forest at nightfall through his boar having outstripped
his train, he saw Melusine with her sisters, dancing by a fountain in
the moonlight. Smitten with her beauty, he asked her to marry him, to
which proposal she consented on condition that he would allow her to
remain secret and unseen every Sunday. They were married, and her secret
was kept until one of his friends suggested that she only desired
privacy in order to indulge an adulterous passage.

Raymond thereupon burst into her secret chamber and discovered that she
was doomed to have the lower part of her body transformed to that of a
serpent every Saturday. The secret broken, she was compelled,
henceforth, to leave her husband for ever, and to be totally transformed
to a serpent. But her spirit continued to haunt the Castle of Lusignan
before the death of any of the lords of that race.

Sometimes, on the other hand, the wife is the transgressor. In a North
German story a wizard keeps a young girl by force as his wife. One day,
accidentally, he lets out the secret that his soul resides in a bird,
which is locked up in a church in a desert place, and that, until the
bird is killed, he cannot die. The bird is killed by the girl's lover,
and the wizard dies--a similar story being found in the "Arabian
Nights."
