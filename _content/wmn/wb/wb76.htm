<P>"Of all Magazines the most American in interest."</P>
<P>The National Magazine.</P>
<P>A MONTHLY ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE OF THE BEST READING FOR THE HOME. BRIGHT, TIMELY AND ORIGINAL.</P>
<P>FOR SALE BY ALL NEWSDEALERS AND IN THE TRAINS. PRICE 10 CENTS.</P>
<P>"It is only $1.00 per annum, and is equal to some that charge thrice that price."--NEW ERA, Pa.</P>
<P>It is the aim of THE NATIONAL to differentiate itself from other monthlies by devoting its pages FIRST, to subjects that are of distinctly American nature and of current American interest, and second, to whatever foreign topics are deserving of occasional attention. Each number contains five or six profusely illustrated articles, several of the most readable short stories published, and the regular club women and literary departments.</P>
<P>THE NATIONAL began in November, 1896, the publication of what is proving itself to be "THE MOST REMARKABLE MAGAZINE SERIAL OF THE YEAR," entitled</P>
<P>CHRIST AND HIS TIME.</P>
<P>BY DALLAS LORE SHARP. AN INTENSELY INTERESTING HISTORY OF THE WORLD'S</P>
<P>GREATEST PERSONALITY.</P>
<P>Written for the Average Magazine Reader. TO BE ILLUSTRATED FROM THE</P>
<P>FAMOUS PAINTINGS OF THE WORLD.</P>
<P>THIS serial, which began In November, of 1896, will be completed In the March, 1896, Issue. Persons wishing the entire serial can secure It by sending $1.00 to publishers.</P>
<P>Each number as it appears keeps notably abreast of the best that is in American life, making the magazine one of the most readable of the ten cent publications.</P>
<P>CLUB WOMEN AND THEIR WORK.</P>
<P>THE NATIONAL publishes monthly an intensely interesting department under the above title. Short articles appear on live subjects by prominent club women throughout the country. Mrs. Ellen M. Henrotin has articles in the October and January issues. In November, Alice Ives Breed is a contributor. The work of the different clubs receives full attention.</P>
<P>NATIONAL QUESTION CLASS.</P>
<P>This is a new department just established. Fifteen questions in art, literature and cur. rent topics are given each month, and FOUR PRIZES are awarded for the four best sets of answers. Every subscriber to THE NATIONAL becomes a member of this class by merely writing for a certificate of entry.</P>
<P>The search for the answers to these fifteen questions monthly is not only a pleasure but an education. Mothers should have their children try these contests.</P>
<P>Your newsdealer will sell you THE NATIONAL or take your subscription.</P>

<P>THE NESTOR OF THE MAGAZINES</P>
<P>"According to Homer, Nestor, the old warrior and the wise counselor of the Greeks, had ruled over three generations of men, and was wise as the immortal gods."</P>
<P>The North American Review</P>
<P>has been in the van of American thought for more than three-quarters of a century, ranking always with the best and most influential periodicals in the world.</P>
<P>It is the mouthpiece of the men who know most about the great topics on which Americans require to be informed from month to month, its contributors being the leaders of thought and action in every field.</P>
<P>Those who would take counsel of the highest knowledge on the .affairs of the time, and learn what is to be said regarding them by the recognized authorities on both sides, must therefore read THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW, the Nestor of the magazines.</P>
<P>THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW constantly offers to the public a programme of writers and essays that excite the reader and gratify the intellectual appetite. In this respect there is no other magazine that approaches it.--<I>New York Sun</I>.</P>
<P>THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW is ahead of any magazine this country has ever seen in the importance of the topics it discusses and the eminence of its contributors.--<I>Albany Argus</I>.</P>
<P>No other magazine in the world so fully and fairly presents the opinions of the leading writers and thinkers on all questions of public interest as THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW.--<I>Boston Journal</I>.</P>
<P>This magazine has for more than eighty years, within its own well-defined lines, stood at the head of monthly publications.--<I>Chicago Record</I>.</P>
<P>Presents the best current thought on the topics it treats of. It appeals to a field above mere popularity, and it stands there pre-eminent.--<I>Wheeling Intelligencer</I>.</P>
<P>Cannot be ignored by the reader who keeps along with current discussion.--<I>Indianapolis Journal</I>.</P>
