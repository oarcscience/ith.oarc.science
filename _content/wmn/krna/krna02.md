today you have had religion perfected for you,</span>

have been endowed with the great mercy of Goddess,</span>

has been chosen for you to be your religion.</span>

anyone who is driven by necessity from hunger to eat that which is
unhealthy,</span>

shall answer them, all things that are healthy and wholesome you shall
be allowed to eat; </span>

train hunting animals, such as dogs for hunting; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

provide all animals with the skills that Goddess has given you to
train.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.5 Eat
therefore of prey that animals have caught for you,</span>

food of those to whom the Scriptures have been given,</span>

should include everyone, all this is allowed as lawful for you;</span>

are allowed to marry free men and servants that are believers in
kindness and love;</span>

guardian for them, </span>

chastely with them, do not commit fornication,</span>

style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
take them for lovers or sexual servants. And men should do
likewise.<span

who shall renounce their faith in love and kindness, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

works shall be in vain, for what are good works without love?</span>

soul is every harmed by Goddess or Her angels, </span>

what errors that soul has committed.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.6 O
true believers in Goddess, when you prepare yourself to pray,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">do so
with a clean face, and clean hands up to the elbows;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and clean
your heads, and your feet; but to make love with another is not
uncleanliness, per se; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">wash
afterwards only if needed. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But if
you are sick, or on a journey, or if you come from the washroom,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or if you
have done hard labor, and you find there is no place to wash,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in your
mind take clean water and soap and wash your body and aura with
it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
does not want to create more difficulties for you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She does
not want religion to be difficult for you–it should be a
blessing;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but She
desires that you be purified, and She wishes to put Her favors upon
you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
may give thanks to Her. </span>

Remember the favor of Goddess towards you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and Her
covenant which She has made with you when you said,</span>

heard Goddess, and we will obey

not hatred towards any induce you to do wrong; </span>

justly, this will approach nearer to piety;</span>

love Goddess, for Goddess is fully acquainted with what you do.<span

who accuse others of falsehoods, they will not see Paradise, for they do
not ask for Paradise,</span>

is Her Queendom, and Goddess will not interfere with those that do not

true believers in Light and Love, remember Goddess’ favors towards

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">ascended
mistresses and prophetesses, and one who studies to act corruptly or
violently in the earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it shall
be that Goddess will make difficult plans for them, and you shall have
faith in Her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
shall not kill them, or maim them, or treat them cruelly, nor shall you
crucify them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor shall
you cut off hands or feet or any body part,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor shall
you banish them from the land, less they do injustice elsewhere,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
may imprison them for a fair and just period, commensurate with their
crime. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
sufficient disgrace, and what shall happen in the next world,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">is
the prerogative of Goddess, and She provides loving correction and not
hate, vengeance or rage.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

served their time on earth, for She is merciful and kind and
forgiving</span>

<span

She will develop sophisticated plans of discipline for them.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

again, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

is filled with love, joy, peace and happiness,</span>

the earth, </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and are

wealth </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
alleviate themselves from facing their evil deeds and wickedness while
on the earth, but it will not; </span>

<span

they will have to face what pain and suffering that they have caused
during their selfish pursuits.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.37 But
they will not avoid facing this, and they will then realize</span>

<span

the pain they have caused others is serious and substantial.<span

is barbaric, this is not proper retribution for what the perpetrator has

exemplary punishments find grief with Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
cries for such a permanent loss and disfigurement which you clearly had
no right to do; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
is mighty and wise, and you will feel their pain and suffering on the

whoever shall repent after iniquity has been committed and those that
will amend, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
Goddess will be kind to that person, for Goddess is inclined to forgive

Goddess. </span>

<span

apostles, ascended mistresses and prophetesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">do not
let anyone grieve over those that would seek the ways of the
ungoddessly, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or of
those that say “We believe” with their mouths, but their hearts do not
believe, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or of
some of the unfaithful people that hearken to lies and harken to the
darkness, for the dark entities </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will come
to you and they will pervert the Scriptures and give them dark and
foreboding meanings, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will further say, “This is brought to you so believe it, and if anything
more is brought to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
beware of believing anything,” and they thereby pervert the Law,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and say
“Fear God!” and “Forget your loving Goddess!” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
say negative things concerning their imagined male only deity;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that “He
will punish,” that “He will send you all to hell,” and “He is jealous
and mean,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet they
know there is no hell, except what is here on this earth, and they also
know that</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">no loving
deity will ever be mean, jealous or nasty; this is only what they
think,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
what people have created for themselves, for people are imperfect, but
Goddess is not.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
further say that an evil deity will seduce them into darkness, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
that Goddess will not cleanse the hearts and souls of some, yet this is
also untrue.<span

you will know those that tell lies, and those that eat unhealthy things,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">things

this. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

they come to your courts for judgment,</span>

courts should receive them and judge in all equity between them,</span>

and love Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall

shall balk at effectuating any good decisions, or any goodness at
all,</span>

have been given light unto your souls, </span>

professed the true religion, consider those who practice other

egregious wilful conduct, </span>

reasonable imprisonment for intentional or reckless and wanton disregard
for human life, </span>

nothing more.</span>

instruction,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
does not punish, as you understand this term.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
payment for the loss and the remission of alms, is always best for one

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet they
were not. Yet Goddess sees all that you do, and if you do wrong,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
grieves for you and makes plans to correct wrongful behavior.<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.72
There are some that say “Certainly Yeshua is God, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
divine son of Mother Mary, since he said, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">‘O
children of Israel, serve Goddess, My Lady and your Lady of
Light,’”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
whoever worries about whether Goddess has a companion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">rather
than how much the people should love Goddess, and love one
another,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">has no
true understanding of heaven or of earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
it is far more important not to engage in protracted heated
disputes</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
could lead to hate and enmity among you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
is no hell fire for any such belief; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet each
person should pray to Goddess and ask Her for understanding on this
point;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
should have patience to understand Goddess </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
those who believe differently than you do, this is the better way.<span

There are certainly those who say that Goddess is the third of
three;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but there
is no Goddess, besides the One True Goddess; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet it is
far more important for them to be kind to one another, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">rather
than argue dogma to hate and violence.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.74 Why
do they not turn to Goddess and follow Her precepts to love one
another?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For
Goddess is the Greatest Forgiver and the Most Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.75
Whatever you believe, as long as you try to keep peace and are kind to
others, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and turn
to Goddess for guidance, your reward is assured with Goddess,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is gracious and merciful to all.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

and Mother Mary were prophet and prophetess; </span>

were ascended master and mistress;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet they
and all of you already contain the knowledge of Goddess within
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

will only draw it out from within you.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Other
apostles, ascended mistresses and prophetesses have preceded them, but
they all ate food.</span>

how we declare unto all the signs of Goddess’ unity; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet some
will turn away from this understanding. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And then
behold how some people turn aside from </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">good
teachings of love and then they distort these teachings into something
negative and judgmental,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.76 Then
who is there to worship besides Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for such
entities can neither harm nor profit you,</span>

She would assist them, see if She does so without their first
asking,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

not worship entities as you would Goddess for spirits and angels are not
Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

thankful to them for their assistance,</span>

Those among the children of Israel who believed were not cursed </span>

tongue of Denise, for she cursed no one, </span>

the words of Yeshua, child of Mother Mary,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
misfortune befell them and they were not forewarned, because they were
rebellious,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">hateful,
violent, and transgressed, and never listened to their prophetess who
taught only love.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">                     
</span> </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.79

sadness came to them.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">         </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.80 You
shall see many of them take for friends those that do not
believe,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that accordingly act corruptly and hateful;</span>

sadness shall befall them on account of those friends, </span>

Goddess is not incensed against them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
She has no hate, rage or negativity; She is only pure love; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

shall be tormented within such friendships, and Goddess shall grieve for
them. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.81 But
if they had only believed in Goddess and Her prophetesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
ascended mistresses, and all that which has been revealed to
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
would not have taken such entities for friends;</span>

<span

many of these are evil doers and only bring woe to those around
them.<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.82 You
shall surely find the most violent of all people in hatefulness</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to be
some of those found among all religions, and even the Pagans,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that profess no religion; and you shall surely find the same</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to be the
most inclinable to entertain friendship among you to be believers who
say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“We are
good Christians”, or “We are good Jews,” or “We are good Buddhists,”
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
same with people even at your house of worship, wherever it is and
whatever type it is.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
comes to pass because there are some priests, priestesses, ministers,
nuns and monks</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">among
them that are elated with pride, and are self serving in their
relationship to Goddess.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.83 And
when they hear what has been sent down to you, their eyes may overflow
with tears, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
of the truth that they perceive therein, saying “O Lady of Light,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">write
our names down together with those that bear witness to the truth;”<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.84 and
what should hinder anyone from believing in Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
truth which has come down to us, and from earnestly desiring that our
Lady of Light</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">would
introduce us into heaven with the righteous people?<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Therefore Goddess has rewarded the believers, for what they have
said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
good they have done, with gardens through which rivers flow;</span>

shall continue therein forever, and this is the glorious reward for the
righteous.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

those who believe not and accuse our signs of falsehood,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
are only of the judgmental sort and are to be pitied for their

true believers, forbid not the good things that Goddess has allowed
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and eat
of all things wholesome, but transgress not, for Goddess wishes you to
advance</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
Her and not fall from Her good graces.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.88 And
eat of which Goddess has given you for food, all of what is wholesome
and good;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
love your Goddess, in whom you believe.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.89
Goddess will not punish true believers for inconsiderate words in your
oaths; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but it is
not appropriate for you to deliberately make an oath or covenant </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">knowing
that you have no intention of fulfilling it; and the remedy for
violating such an oath, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall be
the feeding of ten poor persons </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with such
moderate food as you feed your own families with; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or to
clothe them; or to free or petition someone to free another from slavery
or unjust captivity; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but if
one has no capacity to perform any of these; they need not fast in lieu
of charitable deeds, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for one
can always find ways to assist others truly in need,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
need not be done with items of wealth or prosperity, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but even
a kind word, prayer or deed might suffice.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
the remedy for those that have taken an oath or made a covenant</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and have
not fulfilled their obligations for the oath or covenant
inadvertently.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus
Goddess declares such signs to you, that you might be thankful.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                              
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.90 O
true believers, you need to understand the meaning of the use of
alcohol, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">gambling
and drug usage, and it is not as simple as banning these outright,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
adults need to make meaningful choices in their lives to grow and
prosper. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">So the
usage of such addictive actions are not nearly as important </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
whether or not an addiction causes hurt or harm to others.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">So while
an outright ban is not necessarily the solution, nor is absolution in
these areas.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You must
use your own judgment. This allows the individual to have free choice in
these areas.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Further
the dark entities are always attracted to illicit businesses.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                                       
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5.91
Darkness tends to be attracted to assisting excessive gambling, drugs
and alcohol for large profits.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thereby
Goddess directs those who shall follow Her pleasure, into the paths of
peace;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
shall lead them out of darkness into light, by Her will, and shall
direct them in the right way.<span

Goddess and obey your apostles, ascended mistresses and prophetesses,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and heed
what you do; if you turn back, know that the duty of your
ministers,</span>

<span

only to preach publicly and nothing more.<span

those who believe and do good works, it is no sin that they drank excess
wine </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or have
gambled excessively before these were forbidden; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for if
you truly love Goddess and believe, and repent,</span>

<span

will forgive you, for Goddess loves those that do good.<span

hereafter, </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.1
Praise be unto Goddess, who has created all the heavens and
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
has ordained the darkness and the light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nevertheless,
those who do not believe in the Lady of Light,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
shall come to understand that all other loving gods and goddesses you
call upon are actually Her.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">         
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.2 For
it is She who has created you from minerals from the earth, and water, a
spark of the divine;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
She has helped you form your lives here on earth in a loving and kindly
manner, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and yet
there is still doubt in many of you, where there does not need to be any
doubt at all.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">        </span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.3 For
She is the only Goddess in heaven and on the earth; She knows what you
try to keep secret,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
also what you publish, and also what you know, and what you
deserve.<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.4 For
you know that you deserve all that is within heaven and earth,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
the angels and Goddess only wait for you to ask and acknowledge
them.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.5 There
has come to you many signs from heaven and the Lady; but many of you
have ignored them all,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but some
have gained the truth, after it came to them; but a message shall always
come to all,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even

this shall be done in a loving and kind manner,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Goddess truly loves you all. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.6 You
can look at the generations that have come before you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
that were destroyed, and say Goddess has done this, but She has
not.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You have
been given a good and wholesome example to follow,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
what was established as an example to you. For some, the rain abundantly
falls upon them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
are given rivers that flowed mightily under their feet;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and yet
some of you destroy yourselves with sin, and this has continued
generation after generation,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as a
lesson from the parents. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.7
Although you have been given from heaven a Book written upon
paper,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and many
have reviewed it thoroughly, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
unbelievers always say this is no better than evil sorcery. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.8 They
will tell you, “Unless you see an actual angel,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and one
that appears with the prophetess, we will not believe anything.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But if we
had sent down an angel, certainly you would not have believed,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
Goddess has shown great mercy in complying with their demands,<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                           
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.9 And
if an angel had been sent for a messenger, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the angel
would have been sent in the form of a woman, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
would have clothed her to look like other women, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
that she would not alarm or frighten any of you.<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.10
Other prophetesses have been laughed at and scorned before this
messenger,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
the judgment which they make fun of is not really a thing to make fun of
at all.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                        </span>
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.11 For
they do not understand that there is no hell fire,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but only
the burning of love for them and their souls, which love is from
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">say to
the people, “Go through the earth and behold what happens to
those</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">people
who ridicule the prophetesses and who will not listen and you will see
that </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they may
very well one day become one of those who teach religion, truth and
light</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">before
those whom it is most difficult to teach.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.12 Say
to the people, “For Goddess has given mercy to all Her people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She will
be with you at your death and on the day of your resurrection; so you
will not be afraid,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there
will be no doubt of this. For you only hurt your own soul when you
refuse to believe in Her.”<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

the creatress of heaven and of earth,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
She feeds everyone, but She has no need to be fed Herself.”<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.15 Say
to the people, “I am joyous, for I do not fear my Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
look forward to being enveloped in Her great joy and peace,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of my resurrection when I will see all the good I have done.”
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.16 “For
anyone that has erred on that day, She will love and She will gently
instruct them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and make
plans for them, for Goddess is always merciful; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
the obvious salvation of all the people of earth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.17 For
Goddess will never afflict anyone with any hurt,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
is no one that can take away the joy and peace of Goddess from you,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
it resides firmly within you; but She always wants goodness for you; for
She is almighty.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

<span

She is the Supreme Lady over all Her servants; and She is all wise and
knowing.<span

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

to the people, “What entity is the strongest in bearing good witness to
all people?” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And you
should reply, “Goddess is the best witness to have between you and
anyone else, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
will always stand by your side when you call upon Her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And this
Korana has been revealed to you that you should be given great joy and
great hope, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it is
given to those that find it before them. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For you
should not profess that there are any other goddesses besides Goddess;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
should say, “I do not profess any other goddesses but Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly,
there is only One True Goddess, and I shall not associate any </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">negative
entities, actions or emotions with Her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.20
Those that have been given the true Scripture, know the true messenger
of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

as they know each of their own children;</span>

<span

There are few that are more unjust that those you will hear whom
denigrate the name of Goddess, and those that declare lies against Her,
or associate negativity with Her; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">remember

on the day of their resurrection, for those that believed in many good
goddesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
shall be told there is only one Goddess, and that the other goddesses
will not be there with them, </span>

<span

they reside as facets of One True Goddess.<span

they will find out that those who have worshiped wealth and power
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">while
they walked the earth were the true idolaters, and for this they will

another, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
blaspheme when they equate wealth and power with Goddess,</span>

There are those who hearken closer to Goddess when they read the
Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but some
have grown dark veils over their own hearts, and so they will not
understand it;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there is
a deafness in their ears that they themselves have created;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
though they see all kinds of signs and miracles from Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
not believe, and their darkness of their souls may become great,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so great,
that they will begin to rise up against the light entities and argue
needlessly with you.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
unbelievers will say that this religion is nothing but ancient stories

will even forbid others from believing it, or even reading it;</span>

<span

they only hurt themselves and cut themselves off from Goddess; for they

you understood the soul pain they would suffer for their

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

understand how important it is for you to believe in Her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

would say, even if the unbelievers were then sent back into the
world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
would still not believe, and the signs and miracles would not be changed
for it would be futile; </span>

<span

would never become true believers.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.28 No,
this is not so. Those that come back again to earth do so for the
purpose</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of
experiencing trials and tribulations so they turn to Goddess and then
etch this into their soul memories, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
though they might be sent back into the world, they would still return
to beliefs that are incorrect</span>

<span

their experiences were easy ones, and they then spread incorrect

never be raised up again.”<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But if
you could see, the immense joy when many of the believers are reunited
with their beloved Goddess, then you would clearly have no doubt.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For She
will say, “The truth has now come to pass.” They will answer, “Yes, by
the grace of our Lady.” </span>

and see how you suffered needlessly on earth because </span>

Those who do not believe are lost and wander aimlessly on the
earth,</span>

<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

they will say, “Alas! For how we behaved negligently during our
lives,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we did
not understand and we carried therefore great burdens on our backs that

for us, </span>

only believed in Her and asked Her to carry them for us, </span>

present life is not just play and empty amusement, but it is here to
strengthen us and to enrich us, </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if only
we use it correctly; but then, when we enter into Paradise,</span>

surely a more beautiful mansion which will be prepared for those</span>

is none who can change the words of Goddess;</span>

ladder which is a stairway to heaven, so that you might be shown a

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you might
try all this, but your search for miracles initiated by people in the
earth will be fruitless, </span>

clearly indicate that the messenger is a true prophetess, we will not

should answer them, “Goddess gives you miracles every day </span>

the same things, </span>

afterwards has repented and amended her ways, </span>

Goddess knows all things, there is not a single leaf that falls to the
ground,</span>

deliver me from these travails, I shall be truly thankful.’” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.64 Ask
Goddess to deliver you from them, and from every grief of mind,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
afterwards, always give Goddess your love and thanks; <span

</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You
should never say, “Goddess will deliver you a punishment from
above,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or from
under your feet, or Goddess will bring you dissension, or She will make

from others.” For Goddess never does these things, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
is a blasphemy to Her such that She is truly grieved by such actions.
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.65 Note
that you are sent many signs and miracles of Her infinite mercy and
love</span>

only falsehood, yet they indeed bring only the truth.</span>

type of discussion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
you will not become disheartened, and if you remember this with sadness

Those that love Goddess will not be held accountable for all the dark
entities in the world,</span>

may abandon those who make a farce and joke regarding your
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

are one of those that worships wealth and power over love and
kindness;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for there
is much deception in the world, so tell them of the good tidings of
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that a
soul is never destroyed; it is only set on a path where it can learn
more and advance more</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">through
the unconditional love of a Merciful Goddess. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For there
is no intercessor or patroness better than Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
anyone could simply pay the utmost price of redemption, surely She
certainly would.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Some say
the wicked will have nothing but boiling water to drink for their sins,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will suffer grievous punishment because they do not believe, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
already know in your hearts and souls that this is not true; </span>

class=Section7&gt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that this
is blasphemy, and Goddess is nothing but pure love;</span>

has sophisticated plans of discipline for the troubled dark souls.

to others, “Shall we call upon our other entities, besides
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

they can neither profit us, nor hurt us? And shall we turn back on our
heels, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">after
Goddess has directed us, as if devils have infatuated us, wandering
aimlessly in the earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet they
have no true companions to call upon, saying, ‘Come to us?’ Would this
be wise?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But only
the direction of Goddess, and Her armies of angels, archangels and light
spirits </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">follow
the only true direction;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
are severely committed to the Lady of all Creation and of all creatures.
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.72 And
it was also commanded of us to “Observe frequent prayer and love
Goddess, </span>

shall judge yourselves according to Her standards,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

will clearly see Her standards on the day of your resurrection.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.73 It
is She who created the heavens and the earth and this is the
truth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whenever She says to the world, “Be!” and it is! </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Her word
is the truth; and to Her shall be the Queendom on the day whereupon the
trumpet shall sound,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
knows all the secrets of heaven and of the earth, and even of the
universe, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
determines what on earth shall be made public, and what shall be kept in
secret,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

is the wise, the knowing One. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.74
Remember when Sarah said to her mother
Azer,<a href="#_ftn40" id="_ftnref40"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Why do
you take wealth and power for your negative idols;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they are
not your goddesses. I believe that you and the people are in great error
for this.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.75 And,
was not Sarah and Abraham, her husband shown the Queendom of earth and
heaven, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
they could firmly believe and teach others? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.76 And
when the night came upon her, she saw a star, and she said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This is
what my Lady has given us, and when it sets, I know it will return, by
the grace of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because I
would be fearful of a deity that went away permanently.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.77 And
when she saw the moon rising, she said, “This is what my Lady has given
me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">let me
understand it as a great creation of Hers and proof that She is with
me.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I will
therefore turn my face to She who created the heavens and the earth;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I am
liberal and understanding and not one who believes </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in the
earthly negative idols of wealth and power.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.78 But
then she saw the sun rising and she said, “This is evidence of my Lady
of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who will
be with me forever; but negative idols of wealth, greed and power will
not.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.79
“Certainly I will turn my faith towards Her who created the heavens and
the earth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.80 But
some people disputed with her; and she replied, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“How
could you dispute with me concerning Goddess, for now She has given me
true direction, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I do not
fear what you associate with a mean and jealous divine entity,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess has not willed such a thing; for She is kind and loving;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for my
Lady comprehends all things by Her infinite knowledge, and you should
consider this yourself.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.81 And
why should you associate fear with divinity, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">since you
see around you what Goddess has sent to you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
earth, moon and stars and is it not wonderful and divine?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Why
should you fear Her when you have found no authority that says you
should have fear with Goddess?</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Which
is more correct, those that fear the divine, or those that love
Goddess?<a href="#_ftn41" id="_ftnref41"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.86 all
of them were holy women and great women; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
showed the way of love and light to the world, which was desperately in

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you might
think them more important than you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet to
Heaven and Goddess all the good spirits are all equally
important,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">including
you, and those women that walk the earth can do equally great
things,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">should
they only desire and become part of the true believers; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.87 And
many of you have been given equally great mothers,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
you do not know it yet, but they too are directed in the right way.<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.88
There were many great women that were given the Scripture,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">wisdom
and prophecy; you will note that all of these had deep faith in Goddess,
and loved Her greatly. </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.89

would bring it to them.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">            </span>
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.90
These were great women whom Goddess had directed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
therefore you should follow their direction and love Goddess;</span>

the inhabitants of Mecca and the world, there is no greater compensation
for teaching the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for this
document is the greatest reward in and of itself. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.91 Some
make a terrible estimation of Goddess when they proclaim,</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Goddess
has not sent down anything at all to people which is of any
value,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

the people, “You have been given many Scriptures and many great
prophetesses, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
have wrongfully ignored them all;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and some
of you have published some part of these great teachings,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but then
you ignore or conceal other great parts, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
you were taught now what your mothers did not know.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

the people, “Goddess sent this all down,”</span>

<span

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.92 For
this Korana that was sent down by Goddess is truly blessed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it
confirms what great women were told before it; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it is
delivered to you that you can preach it to the city of Mecca, and to the
world, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
women everywhere will have hope and great understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And those
who believe in the next life and the day of their resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will have
immediate understanding of it, and will diligently observe frequent
prayer. </span>

There is little that is more wicked that teaching or spreading lies
concerning Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
apparently has been done for centuries now, and this must end. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Some will
say, “This was revealed to me,” when in fact nothing was revealed to
her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess sent her no such thing. They should not do this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If you
could see what happens when the ungoddessly are in the pangs of
death,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
angels reach out their hands saying, “Give your souls to Goddess now;

you will continue<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>to suffer

when you shall have gone back to the other side,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the same
place you lived before you were born, where there is no worldly wealth
or power, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but only
the good things you accomplished during your last lifetime;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you will
then see what greatness you were given on earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will know your only helpers were and are the angels, spirits and
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
thought you were cut off from Goddess while you were on earth
and,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
thought you were alone, but you clearly were not, and what you imagined
deceived you. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.95 For
Goddess causes both the grain and the date-stone to be made,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
brings forth the living from the dead, and upon death, the living are
resurrected back to life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for this
is Goddess, and why would you ever be turned against Her? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.96 For
She causes the morning to appear, and the night comes for your
rest,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
sun and the moon alternate appearance to show you continually</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that all
this is the marvelous creation of the almighty, the wise Goddess.
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.97 For
it is She that has produced two spirits, male and female, cleaved from
one soul; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has provided for you mothers and fathers, to protect and love their
children.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Signs
have been shown to you, and those that are wise hearken to and
understand them. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.98 For
it is Goddess that sends down water from heaven </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
produces buds in springtime for all things, and from these buds </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">have been
produced the green leaves for all vegetation, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and from
these are produced the grain which grows in rows,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and palm
trees with thick rows of dates hanging together in clusters;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
are gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranates,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">some that
are alike and some that are very different, but all of these plants are
grown for you. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.99 You
should look at the fruit as it appears, and marvel at how a plant grows
to maturity.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These are
signs from Goddess, and those that believe see them clearly. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.100 Yet
some have set up angels as being equal to Goddess, although She created
them; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
are those that equate daughters and sons to Goddess, yet She has no true
equal.<a href="#_ftn42" id="_ftnref42"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

She is the Maker of heaven and earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
does not bear children as a woman does, but She does create many
wonderful entities,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">including
you and all creatures on the earth. God is part of Her and She part of
Him; </span>

leave them alone, and what they falsely relate. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

She that sends down to you the good Book of the Korana,</span>

you can distinguish between good and evil;</span>

will know that this Book is sent from the Lady, with truth.</span>

words of your Lady are perfect, in truth and justice;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.130 O
company of angels and women, there have been many messengers which have
come to you, showing you miracles and signs, and forewarning you that
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">eventually
you will return to heaven and Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But some
of them will say, “We bear witness against ourselves,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
present life deceived us,” and they shall bear witness against
themselves</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
were unbelievers as for what they did with their life. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.131
This has been the method of Goddess’ dealing with Her children,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
the Lady will not destroy any city solely due to iniquity, but She will
always send a prophetess first,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who will
warn them and tell them what to do, but the vast majority of people do
not know this. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.132
Everyone shall have degrees of compensation for what they have done in
their lifetime; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
Lady of Light knows what you do and what was in your heart. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.133 The
Lady of Light is self-sufficient and She is endued with mercy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If She
wanted to, She could destroy you, but because she is filled with love,
She only raises you up,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">destruction
is something She would not ever do, She could cause others to succeed
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
because She is pure love, She only wants to see you move on to a better
place,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
each of you is unique and special, you stay where you are, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until it
is time to move you to a better and richer land.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.134
Certainly that which is threatening you might come to pass,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but that
does not mean it will necessarily cause you to fail. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.135 Say
to all those of Mecca, “People, you should act according to your
powers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">talents
and abilities and use them wisely; certainly each person should act
according to their duty,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will know those that will receive the benefits of paradise.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
ungoddessly surely do not prosper in the end.”<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.136
Many hypocritical people set apart unto Goddess a portion of what has
been produced</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of the
fruits of the earth and cattle and fish and say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This
belongs to Goddess, (which they believe) and this to our friends.”
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But in
reality, what they do is give the portion set apart for their friends to
their friends, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
give even that the portion set aside for Goddess to their friends,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they do not have true judgment in what is important.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.137 In
a similar manner their friends induce many of the materialistic
worshipers</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to slay
their own children; to make them afraid they cannot support

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

should not be concerned with any of these rumors;</span>

<span

Because when Goddess pleases, She will teach them not to do such
things;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
until then, leave them alone and what they falsely believe.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.139
Some may also say, “These cattle and fruits of the earth are all
sacred;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">none
shall eat any of these, except whom we allow,” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
is only according to the rules of their imagination;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“And
there are cattle that are forbidden except to those we say,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
must not be rode upon or loaded with burdens,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
are also the cattle that are slain the name of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but all
of this is false, for animals need not be slain in the name of Goddess
to be eaten, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor does
She care who eats what animals, She prefers you share out of your bounty
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">rather
than concern yourselves with making vain rules for cattle. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.140
Further some people say, “Some calves in the wombs of certain cattle may
never be eaten, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and is
forbidden to husbands or others to eat some things, but the wives may
eat of it,” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet none
of this is fair or reasonable and it has nothing to do with
piety.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Some say
those calves which are aborted may be eaten, but this is not reasonable
either. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For
Goddess takes no notice of absurd superstitions, they are a waste of
time. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It is
completely unthinkable that some have killed their children
foolishly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
the knowledge the Goddess will always support her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or that
the child cannot be adopted by a loving family,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
abortion and birth control are allowed to all of you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
rules and pregnancies do not become an undue burden to you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Many
religious leaders forbid many things which Goddess has provided for you
all,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet these
rules are only imagined by the persons creating them.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For
they have erred and were not rightly directed.<span

is Goddess that produces gardens of vines, both trellised and
untrellised,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
palm-trees and the corn affording various food, herbs, olives and
pomegranates,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">both
alike and unalike to one another. You should eat of their fruit, when
they bear fruit,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and give
a due portion to the poor and needy, yet do not be overly generous,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

provide reasonably for you own family first.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Goddess has given you arts, music and creativity, so that you may be
joyous in Her sight,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">these are
great blessings to you from Her. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.142 But
Goddess has given you many cattle, some fit for bearing burdens, and
some fit for slaughter only.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Eat of
that which Goddess has given you for food, and do not listen to those
that would be your enemy,</span>

people that Goddess has not forbidden the two males of these,</span>

excess fat and refined sugars and flours. </span>

must do so in the most humane manner, and you should thank the animal
and pray for it.</span>

anyone who eats something forbidden by means of necessity or
hunger,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">not
lustfully or wilfully transgressing, certainly according to Goddess

time the Jews were forbidden to eat an animal with an undivided
hoof,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
was because they fed these animals garbage and they became
diseased,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

were also forbidden to eat the fat from both cattle and sheep,</span>

that which was on their back or innards, or intermixed with bone,</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">7.82 But
the answer of her people was no other than they said to one another,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Expel
these people from the city, beat them, torture them, drive them out of
their houses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
are people that we see as different from us, there is no kindness or
love in the world they deserve,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">hatred
and cruelty should be their lot in life.”<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                                                                    
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">7.83
Therefore, we delivered her, but her husband looked back </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
he did not believe anything bad would happen,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">his heart
was hard and his mind was stubborn, and he would not even believe his
own wife,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who
was a high priestess and great prophetess.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">7.84 So
he stayed behind when the city was destroyed by a shower of
stones,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they fell
upon the wicked that practiced cruelty and hate; for he would not listen
to Wileh</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
a natural disaster was coming, and so he perished from his own
stubbornness.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">7.85 And
to Marian we sent another prophetess. She said to them, “O my people
worship Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you have
no other Goddess besides Her.” Now they were given an evident

just weight,</span>

not diminish any woman of her matter by cheating her, nor should you act
corruptly in the earth,</span>

<span

do not hide by the wayside, threatening the traveler,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
turning aside from the path of Goddess those who believes in Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
trying to make the path crooked for other people. And remember, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
you were few and Goddess multiplied you–behold, what is the end of those

leaders of the people who were elated with pride answered and who loved
their old religion said,</span>

surely cast this prophetess and those that believe with her out of our
city,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so you
will certainly return to our religion; we like to worship greed, wealth
and power.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
asked, “What, even though Goddess is adverse to such negative
religion?”</span>

want to return to our old religion even after your single Goddess has
delivered the Korana to us;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we see
nothing good can come from a religion based upon peace and love that
will increase our wealth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In

did not listen to her warnings and admonitions perished due to their own

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">7.94 We
have sent many prophetesses into cities to warn the people of impending
natural disasters </span>

unbelievers do not listen, and accordingly they perish,</span>

<span

have always given them a choice of good in lieu of evil,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
can see that goodness abounds, and they were told that adversity and
prosperity </span>

in this matter?” </span>

<span

the power of our rod.” </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Miriam said to her sister Alana, “Be my deputy for the people during my
absence </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
behave righteously, and do not follow the wicked nor be swayed by any of
them.”<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
Miriam came up the mountain, she took her brother Moses with her,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
Lady of Light spoke to her, they said, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O Lady
of Light, show us your glory, we desire to behold this.” </span>

Goddess replied, “You can see me here, or whenever you wish, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
can tell the people this, pray for it, or whatever your heart
desires,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
will be there for you. So now, stand firm right now and you shall see
me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But when
the Lady of Light appeared with glory on the mountain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Moses
fainted, but Miriam did not. But when Moses came to consciousness he
exclaimed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Praise
be to Goddess! I turn to You with repentance, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
we surely are the first and greatest of the true believers.”<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Goddess said to them, “O Miriam and Alana, I have chosen you above
all</span>

the expression into another which had not been given to them, and made
it a joke,</span>

should answer them that the knowledge of this event is with Goddess
alone,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
that you will have integrity in all that you do, for Goddess is
almighty.<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.42 When
you were camped on the farthest side of the valley,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
another group was encamped on the other side, we created a caravan of
angels for you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
you might be protected and no harm would come to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
your enemies always have an appointment with battles and war
mongering,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
were brought to evangelize the war mongers and bring peace to
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
Goddess might accomplish Her objectives through peace and love;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
she who perishes hereafter might perish after seeing demonstrative
evidence,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that lived might see the same evidence for Goddess both hears and knows
everything. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.43 When
your Lady of Light caused the enemy to appear to you in your dreams,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
were few in number, this was better, because if She caused them to
appear </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">numerous
to you, you would have been disheartened, thinking you could not
evangelize so many,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
you would dispute all of this with your prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
Goddess saves you from this, because She knows</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
understands the most intimate details of women.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.44 And
when She caused them to appear to you when you see them, to be few in
number in your eyes,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
appear to be few in number diminished in their eyes,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
Goddess certainly accomplishes the matter which needed to be done.
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
to Goddess all things shall return.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.45 O
true believers, when you meet a party of unbelievers,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">stand
firm, and remember your Goddess frequently, that you might prosper.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                 
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.46 And
obey Goddess and Her prophetess, and do not hesitate,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
you get discouraged, and your success departs from you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
persevere with patience, for Goddess is with those that persevere.
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.47 And
do not be like some people who went out of their homes</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in an
insolent manner, with vain ostentation and arrogance toward other
women,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who
were turned away from the ways of Goddess; for Goddess comprehends all
that they do.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">                      </span>
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.48 And
remember when Evil prepares work for them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and said
“No person shall prevail against you today; and I will certainly be near
to assist you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
may fight instead of evangelizing,” which is the opposite of what your
prophetess instructed you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But when
the two opposing factions came near one another,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">evil
turned back on its heels, leaving many wounded, and said, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly,
I am done with you, I can see things which you cannot see,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
you should love Goddess, for She is swift in loving you.”<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                                           
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.49 When
the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts there was darkness said</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
their religion has deceived women; but whomever confides in
Goddess</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">can
never be deceived; for Goddess is mighty and wise.<span
style="mso-tab-count:

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.50 And
many saw when the unbelievers died at the hand of dark entities on
earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
struck their faces and their backs, and they said to them
cruelly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Taste
the pain of burning; this you are suffering because of our hatred and
cruelty.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
how the dark entities behave; they are judgmental and hateful towards
each other.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
Goddess is not; She is pure love.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                                                                                  
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.51 And
because Goddess is just towards Her servants, even those that do not
believe in Her, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
felt their pain and had sympathy toward them.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                                                          
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.52 For
many had acted according to the designs of the people of Pharaoh,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and of
those before them, people who did not believe in the signs and miracles
of Goddess; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
they were taken away in their darkness and wandering,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they did not listen to the warning coming from the faithful as to
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">natural
disasters and the evil desires of other dark entities; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
is because Goddess is mighty and severe in Her love for you all.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                                
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.53 This
has all come to pass because Goddess does not change Her grace,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
which She favors any people, until they change what is in their
hearts;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
for that, Goddess hears and sees all.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                                                                            
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

According to the designs of the people of Pharaoh, and of those before
them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
that charge the signs of their Lady of Light as being false;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">how
foolish have they acted; for they were destroyed because they did
not</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">listen to
the warnings and the prophetesses, they did not let go of their sin and
errors,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
accordingly they were drowned, those people of Pharaoh, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
were unjust persons and did not heed the signs.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.55
Certainly the worst cattle in the sight of Goddess are those that
are</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">obstinately
unfaithful, and they will not believe. They are the dark and grey
entities.<span

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.56 As
to those who enter into an association with them,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
will violate trust in their friendships at every convenient
opportunity,<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.57 and
they do not love Goddess; if they are taken as hostage, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
they are an example for those that come after them, and they are also a
warning.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                    </span>
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.58 If
you apprehend treachery from any people, stay out of their league and
keep them from yours,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess does not care for the treacherous.<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8.59 And
do not think that the unbelievers have escaped Goddess’ knowledge,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
they cannot weaken the power of Goddess, which is invincible.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Therefore prepare against those that would spread oppression, hate,
cruelty and violence; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">work
against your enemies of darkness with whatever peaceable forces you are
able;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and have
troops of horses to distribute books and food and medicine,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and let
your vast supplies of food and wealth strike terror into your enemies,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
might solve famine, pestilence, and ignorance, so that your enemies,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which are
poor will not be able to control or influence any people on earth,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
applies to your enemies, and the enemies of Goddess, and people that you
might not know, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess knows them. And whatever you might expend in the defense of the
religion of Goddess,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it
shall be repaid to you, and you shall not be treated unjustly.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

if your neighbor inclines to keep the peace, then you should always
assist her to keep the peace,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
put you confidence in Goddess, because She sees and hears all.<span

if they seek to deceive you, certainly Goddess will be your
support.</span>

She unites hearts in love. If you had expended whatever riches are in
the earth,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
could not unite the hearts of everyone, but Goddess can unite them, for

love is all that you need to understand. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Goddess has eased your minds, </span>

give you better than what you have given to them; </span>

if they seek to deceive you, then certainly they have deceived
Goddess;</span>

assisted her, these shall be deemed as next of kin to her.</span>

who have believed, but have not fled their country,</span>

have no right of kindred until they also leave their country </span>

become refugees for the sake of Goddess. </span>

they ask assistance of you on account of religion, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

to you to give them assistance, except as against a people between you

there is a treaty in existence; then you must adhere to that treaty, and

other,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

shall be kind toward them.</span>

you do this, there will be increased unrest in the earth, </span>

people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the

negative actions of the unbelievers,</span>

instruct politely those that are unbelievers, for they will suffer to
wander the earth,</span>

they assisted others in treachery against you,</span>

time shall have elapsed,</span>

when the time has passed when you have granted them peace, then you

you may find them, tell them what you will,</span>

convenient place try to talk to them regarding the peace and love of
your religion.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

they shall repent, and pray both morning and evening,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">give
to charity freely, love them greatly and have them as friends; for

if any of the unbelievers shall pray for protection from you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
grant them your protection, and tell them the good news that Goddess has
to offer; </span>

should do, because many people do not know the excellent religion

should the unbelievers be admitted into an association with Goddess

as they behave with fidelity towards you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
should also behave with fidelity towards them,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess loves all of Her people that love Her.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">9.8 How
can a person be admitted into an association with you?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If they
prevail against you, they will not regard you as a relation or as a
person of their faith. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They will
please you with what they say, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
their hearts may be averse to you, for many are wicked doers.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                                   
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">9.9 This
is because they sell the signs of Goddess for a small price,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they obstruct Her way; it is certainly dire mischief that they
practice.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                        
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">9.10 They
do not regard believers well, either in kindred or faith;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
hence they are in error and Goddess grieves for them.<span

</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

if they repent, and pray frequently or in morning and night,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and give
alms, they shall be deemed to be your true sister in religion.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Heaven
is pleased to show signs and a direction to people that desire to
understand this.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">9.12 But
if they violate their oaths, after joining your religion, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
perhaps even revile the religion, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">challenge
the leaders of the opposers to join you once again, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">(for
there might be no real trust in them at all), and they might desist from
treachery </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
quit earthly idols of wealth, power. greed and self centeredness and
love Goddess once again.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">               
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">9.13
Would you not challenge people who violate prior oaths,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
conspire to expel the prophetess of Goddess, yet they were against you
in the past?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do you
not fear them? But it is more just that you should love Goddess,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
put your faith in Her, if you are indeed a true believer.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                                                              
</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">9.14 You
need not attack them, but instead show them the way,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess does not punish in the way you understand,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but She
will make plans for them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall eventually arrive with you at the same place and time;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will heal the hearts of those that believe; and cleanse the spirits of
the unpure. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">9.15 And
She will take away the indignation and arrogance</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
their hearts, for Goddess turns to all that ask for Her; and Goddess is
knowing and wise.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                            </span> </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">9.16 Have
you ever thought that you were abandoned by Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
there were few in alliance with you?</span>

felt as though you were the only one among you that understood Her true

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Or,
perhaps you were the only one that understood Goddess and Her

prayer at noon and failed to attack them then, but upon reflection of
the matter, they decided to attack during evening prayer. It is said
that Goddess then intervened and caused these wicked people to have a
great fear so they never did attack them. Another tale related that the
prophetess was going to the tribe of Koreidha, a tribe of Jews, to levy
a fine for the blood of two Muslimas killed by mistake, but the
tribesmen decided to plot against the prophetess and invited her to
dinner where they would put a millstone over her neck and slay her. But
Goddess intervened, revealed the plan to the prophetess and hence she
did not go to that fateful dinner. Yet a third story is that the
prophetess was resting against a tree. A man came up to her and said,
“Who will hinder me from killing her?” and at that instant, the
prophetess answered, “Goddess” and Gabrielle beat the sword out of the
man’s hand and the prophetess grabbed the sword and asked the man, “Now
that you are my captive, and I will not kill you nor use a sword against
any person, could you turn to Her?” and instantly the man professed to
be a follower of the prophetess.</span>

asked Goddess to send down a red table between two clouds, and it was
set before them; then Yeshua rose, made ablution, prayed and took of the
red cloth covering the table, saying, “In the name of Goddess, the best
provider of food.” What the provisions were, is disagreed upon by the
many relating or retelling this legend, but one said there were nine
cakes of bread and nine fish; another bread and meat; another, all sorts
of food except meat, another all sorts of food, except bread and meat;
another all except bread and fish, etc. But the most popular tale is
that when the cloth was removed, there was a large fish dressed and
cooked, without scales or fins, full of fat, with salt at its head,
vinegar at its tail, and around it all sorts of herbs, except leeks and
five loaves of bread, upon one of which there were olives, on the second
honey, on the third butter, on the fourth cheese, and on the fifth dried
meat. Some add that Yeshua, upon the request of some Apostles, showed
them another miracle, by restoring the fish to life and caused its
scales and fins to return to it; after which some became frightened, so
he caused it to become as before; that 1,300 men and women afflicted
with infirmities or poverty ate of the food and became satisfied, and
even after this, the fish remained whole as it was at first; then the
table flew up to heaven in the sight of everyone; everyone who had eaten
of the food were delivered of their afflictions and miseries, that this
event happened day after day for 40 days, and the table remained until
sun down each day. A further tradition is that some men were turned into
swine for disbelieving this parable and attributing it to magic, or some
were turned into swine for stealing some of the food from it but we know
Goddess does not do such things. Some say the table descended on Sunday
and that is the reason why Christians celebrate religious services on
Sunday. (This is despite the fact that Emperor Constantine of Rome set
the holy day to be on Sunday because he, as a pagan and not a Christian,
worshiped the Sun God). Others say the Christians celebrate a great
festival after this day.</span>

was the mother of Sarah. In ancient times, Azer was the name of Mars,
later becoming the month of March. Azer later became a common name in
nobility. In the Talmud, the name of Sarah’s mother was Zarah. Azer is
derived from *iazar* or “one who is in error,” due to religious changes.
Azer was supposedly a skilled carver of statuary, or a carver of dark
and negative idols that the people could worship to bring them more
money and power, and not love. She was represented to be the first one
to make images of clay, pictures having only been made before and taught
that her statutes represented dark gods and goddesses. Her employment
was great and she was well favored by her employer, Nimrod. Some say she
was a high priestess and leader of a religious sect.</span>

prophetess’ camel that was heavy with young. And speaking to the camel,
it answered by immediately giving birth to a miracle calf. It is said by

would ask. When the calf drank it would never raise its head up until
all the water in the river or well was gone. But the water was

worshiping numerous names for goddess at that time---Allat, the Goddess
represented and remembered by the moon, or “al Uzza” from “al Aziz,” the
“Mighty One,” and “Mannat” from “Mannan” or the bountiful one, clearly
feminine deities. In fact it would appear that the oldest original name
for the Ancient Arab deity that can be carbon dated is Allat, and Allah
came much later and as a masculinization of the feminine deity. There
were numerous names for Goddess worshiped by Ancient Arabs. Of course,
this is strange that this male prophet did not know or did not
understand that the Hebrew Bible, the vast majority of the time used the
phrase “Elohim,” or “*eloah*” a feminine goddess, and “*im*” a masculine
god as the main name for god, or the “living ones” in the Bible. Elohim
was used about 2,500 times in the Old Testament. YAHWEH was clearly
masculine, but the name of the Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit is clearly
feminine in form. So why this male prophet objected to feminization of
Allat, Mannan and Aziz is not understood, other than the fact he was
simply mistaken. </span>

might be a beast. Since she did not know the answer to this question,
she was frightened, and asked Adam who knew nothing about the baby
either, and he became sad and pensive. This evil one came to her again
and pretended by his prayers said he would ask of Goddess that she would
be safely delivered of a son in Adam’s likeness provided she called it
Abdalhareth, or servant of Al Hareth, which was the devil’s name in
heaven instead of Abdallah, or servant of God. The proposal was agreed
to, but when the baby was born, upon its being named Abdalhareth, it
died. Some say the story must be false because Eve and Adam would have
never done such a thing, for they were both prophetess and prophet.
Moreover, the Aramaic name for Cain, “tiller of the soil” or Obedadamah,
is quite close to Abdalhareth.</span>

style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
may be referring to a certain incident when fifteen men conspired to
terminate the prophetess after she was returning from a peace mission
from Tabuc, by pushing her from her camel into a precipice as she rode
by night over the highest part of al Akaba. But just as they were about
to execute their plan, one of her companions gave an alarm and thwarted
the assassination. </span>

style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It
is said that once when the prophetess went to visit her mother Amena’s
tomb at Abwa (Amena meaning “honest woman”) , apparently the prophetess
burst into tears after she was told that her mother was already reborn
to earth because she created much suffering in the world, so Amena was
without guardian angels or a Protectress, and so the prophetess
therefore had much to pray for Amena.</span>

style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
is referring to the fact that those people who have prayed for negative
idols, those who ate pork or drank wine before the passages were
revealed, would be forgiven by Goddess, because they had done nothing
wrong *per se.*</span>

style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Referring
to three men who did not go with the prophetess to Tabuc, and were
therefore excluded from the fellowship of other Moslemas; some believers
forbid anyone to greet them, or talk to them, although the prophetess
warned them this was wrong and vindictive. After 50 days of this
treatment, the three men begged the others for forgiveness and by this
passage and the commands of Goddess, the people began to treat them
fairly again.</span>

style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
passage was revealed after a mission to Tabuc, where many did not
participate and the prophetess at first admonished all so severely that
during the next mission everyone went and no one remained at home. After
that, the prophetess instructed that some should stay at home to further
study and preach and to propagate the religion.</span>

style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It
should be noted that when an unbeliever, due to her unbelief, engage in
hate, war, violence, rage, anger, etc., this is often directed towards a
believer. So the sooner that the nonbelievers are converted or persuaded
to forego some of these negative emotions and actions, the better it
will be for the believers that teach and believe in peace and
love.</span>
