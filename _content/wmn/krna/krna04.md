Heaven has not sent down the Korana to you, so that you might be
unhappy,</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.3 it
was meant as a promise of love for those that Love Goddess,</span>

this is not necessary for Goddess to hear them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

knows everything that is secret, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.10
When she saw fire, she said to her family,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Wait
awhile here, for I see a strange fire, perhaps I can find out what it
is,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

find a direction for us by means of this strange

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.11 And
when she came near to it, a voice called to her, saying, “O
Miriam,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.12 “I

“Certainly I am your Goddess, there is no goddess besides Me;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
worship Me, and perform your prayers in remembrance of Me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.15
“Certainly the hour comes, I will make known a special decree,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
every soul may receive a reward for all that it has done.”</span>

“Let those that do not wish to believe, and those that follow only lust,
greed and vain desires</span>

“Now what is in your right hand, O Miriam?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.18 She
answered, “It is my rod which I lean upon, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I use
it to beat down leaves for my flock; and I have other uses for it as
well.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.19
Goddess said to Her, “Throw it on the ground.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.20 And
she threw it down, and behold, it became a serpent, which slithered
about.<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

will be changed to its former condition.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.22 And
put your right had under your left arm, it will come forth white,
without any pain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
will be a sign or miracle to you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.23 “I
am showing some of my greatest miracles to you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.24
“Then go to Pharaoh, for he is especially impious.”</span>

Miriam answered, “Lady of Light, enlarge my breast, and give me great
courage,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.26

“and loosen the knot in my tongue,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

“and give me a counselor from my family,”</span>

“namely my sister, Alana,”</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.31
“give me strength from her strength,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.32
“make her my colleague in business,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.33
“that we may praise You greatly,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.36
Goddess replied, “Now I have heard your request, O Miriam,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.37
“and we have been gracious to you another time,</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.38<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>prior to this, when we revealed to
your mother when you were just born, saying,</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.39
‘put your child into a small ark, and send her afloat in the
river,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
river will wash her ashore where a woman will find her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
will take the baby in to raise her as her
own,’<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
thereby bestowed my love upon you, and you may be raised by a loving
woman,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

protected from harm.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.40
Immediately thereafter, your sister went to the woman and said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Shall I
bring you someone to nurse this child?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">So heaven
returned to the mother her precious child, that her mind might be set at
ease,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
might not be afflicted with grief, and when you accidentally killed a

delivered you from trouble, you were proved by several trials,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
afterwards you lived in Marian. Then you came to this area, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">according
to our command, O Miriam.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.41 “I
have chosen you for myself, </span>

tell her of My miracles;</span>

not be negligent in remembering Me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.43
“then go to Pharoah, for he is very impious,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.44
“but speak mildly to him, perhaps he will reconsider,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or will
understand that Goddess has come to protect Her women.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.45
They answered, “O Lady of Light, certainly we fear that Pharoah may be
violent against us, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or he
might do further harm against my people.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.46
“Goddess replied, “Fear not, for I am with you, I will hear and see
everything.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.47
“Therefor go to Pharaoh and say, ‘We are messengers of</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the Lady
of Light, therefore send the children of Israel with us, and do not harm
them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We have
come to you with a sign from the Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and peace
be upon her who will follow the right direction.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.48
“Certainly it has been revealed to us, that sadness will come to anyone
who shall say </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that we
are impious, and anyone that turns back.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.49 And
when they had delivered their message, Pharaoh said, “Who is your
Goddess, O Miriam?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.50 She
answered, “The same as yours, the Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
brings love, only love.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>She

in hate, violence or oppression, for She gives everything to all,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She has
created you all, and this is how She directs you all.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.51
Pharaoh said, “What therefore is the condition of the former
generations?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.52
Miriam answered, “The knowledge of this is completely with the Lady of
Light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is in
the Book of Her decrees, my Lady of Light has never erred, nor does She
forget.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.53 “It
is She who has spread the earth as a bed for you, and She has made you
paths thereupon,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
sends down rain from heaven, whereby heaven cause all types of
vegetables to spring forth;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.54
saying, ‘eat of part, and feed your cattle with the other part.’</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
these are signs for people who are endued with great
understanding.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.55
“Out of the ground you were created and part of you will one day return
to the same,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will be raised up again to new life after that.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.56 And
we showed Pharaoh all our signs which we had empowered Miriam to
perform;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Pharaoh accused her of sorcery, and Pharaoh refused to believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.57 And
he said, “Have you come to us that you may dispossess us of our lands
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by your
enchantments, Miriam?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.58
“Certainly we will meet you with the same or better magic; therefore
make an appointment for this</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in an
open place, and</span><span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span><span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;"><span
style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>we will not fail to keep it, nor should
you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.59
Miriam answered, “Then let the time and place be on the day of your
solemn feast, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and let
the people be assembled during mid-day.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.60 And
Pharaoh turned away from Miriam, and gathered together</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">all his
most expert magicians to executed his grand plan,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
they came to the appointed time, day and place.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.61
Miriam said to them, “Woe be to you!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Do not devise lies against Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is your only Protectress, and you will lose Her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those who
devise lies about Goddess will not prosper.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.62 And
the magicians debated among themselves regarding the affair,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
discussed these matters in private.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.63 And
they said, “Miriam and Alana are most certainly expert magicians,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they seek
to dispossess you of your land by sorcery,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
lure away your most valuable and knowledgeable women.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.64
“Therefore, collect your best strategy and information and come in
order,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
will not prosper on this day, only the most superior will.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.65
They said, “O Miriam, who will throw down their rods first?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.66 She
answered, “You should throw down your rods first.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
behold, their cords and their rods appeared as if by magic, to run
around like serpents.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.67 And
Miriam became fearful she would not prevail.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.68 But
the angels said to her, “Fear not, for you will prove to be the superior
one,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.69
“therefore throw down your rod which is in your right hand,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
will swallow up the illusionary serpents which they have made,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for what
they have made is only a clever deception of an enchanter,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and an
enchanter shall not prosper over Goddess, no matter where she comes
from.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.70 And
the magicians, when they saw this miracle which Miriam performed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they fell
down worshiping her Goddess and said, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“We
believe in the Lady of Light of Alana and of Miriam.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.71
Pharaoh said to them, “Do you believe in Her before I have granted you
permission to do so?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
this is your new mistress, who is teaching you new magic.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But I
will cut off your hands and your feet on the opposite sides,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will see how I am swift to punish those that do not obey me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I can
cause more pain and your Goddess will not protect you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.72
They answered, “We will not have a greater reward with you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">than what
we see in the evident miracles which were provided by the same Goddess
which created us.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore
pronounce your sentence against us, which you want to pronounce,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for you
can only give us such a cruel sentence in this present life, and not
thereafter.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.73
“Certainly we believe in our Lady of Light, for She will forgive us our
errors,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will forgive us for performing sorcery to trick others to believe you
are a god, when you are not,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess provides the best rewards, and She would never punish us as you
do, for She is pure love.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.74
“Certainly whoever will appear before the Lady of Light on the day of
judgment, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">polluted
with crimes and unrepentant, will be tied to this earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
like hell for you, and you will not die, but you will come back here
repeatedly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to live
without guardian angels and Her protection, until you turn to
Her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.75
“But whoever will appear before Her, having been a true believer,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and will
have worked righteousness, for such a person is prepared the highest
degrees of happiness,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.76
“namely, gardens of perpetual abode, which shall be watered by rivers;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
remain therein forever, and this will be the reward of the
pious.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.77 And
we spoke by revelation to Miriam, saying, “Go forth with My servants out
of Egypt by night,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
strike the waters before you with your rod, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
action will make them a dry path through the
sea,<a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not be apprehensive of Pharaoh overtaking you, nor should you be
afraid.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.78 And
when Miriam had done this, Pharaoh followed them with his forces,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
waters of the sea overwhelmed them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.79 And
Pharaoh caused his people to err, and he did not direct them
justly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by
seeking harm against another human being.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.80
Thus, the children of Israel were delivered from an oppressor of
violence and hate,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
were appointed to the right side of Mt. Sinai</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
discuss with Miriam where she would receive the Word;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
heaven caused manna and quails to descend upon them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.81
saying, “Eat of the good things which we have given you for food,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not err, unless you fall away from the path of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whomever falls away will not have the protection of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor Her
direction, which shall seem like hell to you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.82
“But I will be gracious to her who will repent and believe, and who does
what is right,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
will be rightly directed.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.83
“What has caused you to hasten from your people, O Miriam, to receive
the law?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.84
Miriam answered, “There are many that follow my footsteps
closely,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but I
have hastened to You, O Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that You
might be more pleased with us all, to receive proper direction.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.85
Goddess replied, “We have already put your people through our
trials,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">since
your departure, but al Sameri seduces them to return to past idols of
wealth, greed and power.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.86
Therefore, Miriam returned to her people, with great concern,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and was
very grieved for them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And she
said, “O my people, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">did not
the Lady of Light promise you an excellent reward? Did the time of my
absence seem long to you?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Or did
you desire that the Lady of Light would not fail to be your protectress
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though you have fallen away from Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
have failed to keep your promises with Her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.87 The
people answered, “We have not failed in what we promised you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Miriam,
but we were made to carry in several loads of gold and silver,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of the
ornaments of the people, and we threw them into the fire,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and in a
similar manner al Sameri also cast in what he had collected.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.88
“and he produced an ornamental calf, which was able to low,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and al
Sameri and his companions said, ‘this is a new god for you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and as
for the Goddess of Miriam, she has forgotten Her altogether, and she was
gone to seek another.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.89
“Did they not therefore see that their idol returned no answer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
was not able to advise them or provide any hurt or profit,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet al
Samari had the people worshiping wealth, power and greed; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there was
no mention of love, kindness or tenderness in any of this.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.90 And
Alana had said to them before, “O my people, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
you are only shown to be self centered by worshiping</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a calf
made of gold and silver and your own greed and wealth thereby.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.91
They answered, “We will no longer be devoted to worship of Goddess,
until Miriam returns to us.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.92 And
when Miriam returned, she said, “O Alana, what prevented you from doing
something,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when the
people went astray?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.93
“Why did you not admonish them sternly and turn them back to me and
Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">How could
you be so very disobedient to me and my commands?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.94
Alana answered, “O daughter of my mother, do not hurt me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor the
hair of my head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Certainly I
feared that you would say this when you returned, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">‘you have
made a division among the children of Israel, and you have not observed
my sayings.’”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.95
Miriam said to al
Sameri<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

“What was your purpose, O Sameri,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
leading the people astray with such self centered worship,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
not of Goddess, this is not what She taught?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.96 He
answered, “I see what they cannot, so I took a handful of dust</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from the

because I thought this was best.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.97
Miriam said, “This is not what you were told to do while I was
away,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
promised to keep the faith to Goddess, and now the people see who and
what you are,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and now
they will not touch you, until you repent and come back to
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will not have Her as a protectress; as for the golden calf, it will be
melted down and sold,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
profit distributed to the poor, to teach the people how wrong self
centeredness is.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.98
“Your Goddess is the One True Goddess, besides whom there is no other
goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
understands all things by Her omnipotent knowledge.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.99
Thus do we recite to you, O prophetess revelations of past
herstory,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
show you the blessings of the love of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.100
She who turns aside from this herstory will surely</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">be
disappointed with sadness on the day of her resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for all
the good she could have accomplished, if she had only believed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.101
And they will continue on in such a manner, without assistance,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
will become a grievous burden, until the truth is revealed to her on the
day of her resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.102 On
that day the trumpet shall sound, and the unbelievers will be gathered
together on that day,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
eyes will become transparent to show their
souls.<a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.103
They will speak only with a low voice to one another, saying, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“We have
not tarried more than ten days.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.104
Heaven will know what they say, when the best are brought
forward,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will say, “You have not tarried more than one day.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.105
They will ask you concerning the mountains, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">answer
the people, “My Lady of Light can reduce them to dust,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
scatter them abroad, but She would never harm you or make you
afraid.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.106
“And She might leave them as a flat plain;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.107<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>with no part higher or lower than
another, but She will never harm you or make you afraid.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.108 On
that day, womankind shall follow the angel </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and bring
everyone to the final judgment for all womankind; none shall have the
power to run away,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
voices will be low before the Merciful lady,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor shall
they hear anything but the soft sound of shuffling feet.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.109 On
that day, no one will need to intercede for another any longer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
Merciful Lady has the ultimate intercession for all with Her
love,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and all
will finally be acceptable to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.110
Goddess will know exactly that which is before Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
which they put behind them; but no person will have the same great level
of knowledge,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.111
and all faces will be humbled before the living, the self-sustaining
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will show all at that time Her wondrous love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.112
But whosoever has done good works, was a true believer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">should
not fear any injustice or any diminution of her reward from
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.113
And thus heaven has sent down this great Book, being a Korana or
reading,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in the
English language, which is easily translatable to other
languages,<a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
heaven has inserted various promises and instructions therein,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
women may love Goddess freely, and with love it may awaken deep
consideration in them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.114
Therefore, let Goddess be highly exalted, the Queen, the Truth!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do not be
overhasty in receiving or repeating the Korana </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">before
the revelation thereof has been completed to
you,<a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and say,
“O Lady of Light, increase my knowledge.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.115
Prior to this, we gave a command to Eve;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but she
ignored this
command,<a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:

mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">[18]</span></span></span></span></a>
and she ate of the forbidden fruit;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and while
there was not any firm resolution of the soul,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
allowed her to leave Eden and come to earth to experience more,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">through
trial and tribulation and to perfect her soul.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.116
And remember when the angels were told,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Worship
Eve,” and they all worshiped her, except for Eblis, who refused.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.117
And we said, “O Eve, certainly the serpent is an enemy to you and to
your husband, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
beware of him, unless he turns you out of paradise, for then you will
experience misery.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.118
“Certainly we will make a provision for you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
will not experience hunger, nor shall you be naked,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.119
“and there is also a provision made for you that you will not thirst,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
you be overcome with heat.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.120
But the serpent whispered suggestions to her, saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O Eve I
will guide you to the tree of eternity, and a Queendom which will never
fail.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.121
and Eve and her husband both ate of the fruit, and their nakedness
appeared to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
began to sew together the leaves of paradise to cover themselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And thus
Eve disobeyed her Lady of Light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.122
Afterwards her Lady accepted her on her repentance,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so
Eve turned back to Her, and was directed by Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.123
And Goddess said, “Go forth from the Garden,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">live on
the earth, where one shall be an enemy to another.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
hereafter a direction will come to you from Me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whoever will follow my directions will not err, nor shall she be
unhappy;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.124
“but whomever will turn aside from my directions,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
have a miserable life, without any protection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will appear before Me and be sad on the day of their
resurrection.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.125
And she said, “O Lady of Light, why do I feel blind now, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
before this everything appeared clearly to me?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.126
Goddess answered, “This was done, because the signs came to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
made a different decision, indicating you are ready for this.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.127
And those that are faithful will have a great reward,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and will
believe in the signs and miracles of the Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and while
we do not punish, life on earth without a protectress will seem like a
grave punishment, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet the
rewards of the next life will be better if you believe and obey
Me.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.128
Are not all the people, therefore, acquainted with how many generations
have suffered terribly</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
turned away from Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
despite the fact they walk right by these empty and dilapidated
dwellings now?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
these are signs to those that are endued with understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.129
And unless a decree had previously issued forth from the Lady of
Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for their
respite, certainly there are many natural disasters occurring frequently
upon the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but there
is always a predetermined time for each one which was decreed by
Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but it is
not for punishment, only for the necessary changes the earth must go
through to sustain life.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.130
Therefore, O prophetess, bear patiently what the people say to
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
celebrate the praise of the Lady of Light before the rising of the
sun,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
before the setting thereof, and praise Her in the hours of the night,
and in the extremities of the day,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
you may be well pleased with the prospect of receiving the favors of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.131
And do not cast your eyes on things which were granted to the
unbelievers to enjoy, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">namely,
the splendors of the present life, that we can prove them
therewith,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
provision of the Lady of Light is so much better, and more
permanent.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.132
Command your family to observe frequent prayer, and persevere with
them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We do not
require that you labor to gain provisions for yourself and your
family;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but we
will provide them for you; for prosperity will attend those that are
pious.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.133
The unbelievers say, “Unless she comes to us with a sign directly and
obviously </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from the
Lady of Light, we will not believe what she says.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But has
not a plain declaration come to them, that which is contained in former
volumes of Scripture,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">before
the revelation of this Korana?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.134 If
we had destroyed them by a judgment before the same was revealed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
would have said, at the resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O Lady
of Light, how could we believe since you did not send us a
prophetess,<span style="mso-tab-count:1">    </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so we
might follow Your directions, for now we are humbled and
shameful.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">20.135
Say to the people, “Each of us must wait for this issue to be
determined;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">REVEALED
AT MECCA</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;"></span>

 

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In the
name of the most Merciful Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.1 The
time of giving up their account draws near to the</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">people,
while they have sunk into negligence, turning aside from the
considerations of their situation.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.2 No
admonition comes to them from their Lady of Light, being recently
revealed in the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but when
they hear it, they are not in a believing mood; their head is filled
with worldly delights.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.3 And
the people who act unjustly discuss matters privately together,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying,
“Is this prophetess any more than a woman, like us? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Will you
therefore come to hear a piece of sorcery, when you can see that it
plainly is such a thing?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.4 Say,
“My Lady of Light knows whatever is spoken in heaven and on the earth,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is She
who hears and knows all.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.5 But
they say, “The Korana is a confused heap of dreams, no, she must have
forged it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Or no,
she is only a poet, so let her come forward with a miracle, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in a
similar manner as other prophetesses have done.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.6 None
of the cities which are now gone believed in the signs and miracles that
occurred, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
never believed their prophetesses that they must leave,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will
these unbelieving people believe us now?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.7 We
do not send any prophetess, other than women, whom we have revealed our
will to.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Ask those
who are acquainted with the Scriptures, if you do not know this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.8 We
give each person a body that will not live unless it receives food on a
continuing basis for survival, food which heaven obviously provides, yet
still they do not believe. No person is immortal.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">No person
cannot live without the provisions of heaven and Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.9 But
we have made good our promise to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
we delivered them, and those whom we pleased;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but earth
creates natural disasters, and the exorbitant transgressors are
destroyed, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they will not listen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Others are
lost because it is their predetermined time.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.10 Now
we have sent down to you this Book of the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">wherein
there is an honorable mention of you, will you not understand?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.11 And
how many cities were overthrown, that held the ungoddessly and the
violent and hateful;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and other
peaceful nations were raised up after them?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.12 But
do not mistake this for vengeance, because heaven and Goddess bear no
vengeance,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">only
love, still people fled the cities.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.13 And
the angels said to them, “Do not fly from your cities, but return to
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will understand that it does you no good to heap up your treasures here,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but heap
up treasures for Goddess and the life to come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for your
fancy homes which you delight in are mostly in vain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
on the day of your resurrection you will not be asked concerning
them.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.14
They answered, “Alas for us!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Certainly we have erred.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.15 But
their lamentations would not cease,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for their
love of Goddess had been mowed down like rows of corn, utterly
destroyed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.16<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>We did not create the heavens and the
earth and what is between them, just for your amusement.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.17 If
we had pleased to create such an environment, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we would
have done it for you all, if we had resolved to do this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.18 But
we will present both truth and vanity, and this will confuse only some
who desire only the vain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
will see this vanish away. Sadness will come to the ones that are
impious concerning Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.19
Since whoever is in heaven and upon the earth is subject to Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
angels who are in Her presence do not insolently disdain Her service,
nor do they tire of it ever.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.20
They praise Her night and day, they never fade in their praises.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.21
Have they made up their own negative goddesses on earth? Does vanity
raise the dead to life?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.22 If
there were godesses besides the one in heaven and upon the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
all such goddesses would be as one entity working together, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
everything is connected on the other side and there is no division, only
peace and harmony. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But far
be that which they say about Goddess, the Lady of the throne!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.23 No
account shall be demanded of Her for what She will do,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but an
account will be demanded from each person for what she did.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.24
Have the people taken other negative goddesses of wealth, power and
greed besides Her?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say,
“Produce your proof that these are true goddesses.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
an instruction for those who are contemporaries with the
prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
admonition of those who have gone before the prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
greater part of the people do not know this truth, and they desire to
turn away from it, regardless.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.25 We
have sent you prophetesses before this, and they revealed to the people
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there are
no other goddesses except Goddess, and were told to serve only
Me.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.26 The
people say, “The Merciful Lady has a child and the angels are Her
daughters,” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
is not true; no angels are her daughters like you have daughters.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She does
not become pregnant and bear angels as a woman bears children.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>It is not necessary!<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
angels are Her honored servants. But those that say that Goddess has
children </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">are only
noticing the many facets of Her personality, and this is not any severe
error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You
should let them alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Saying
that the angels are her daughters is only an analogy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.27 No
person prevents Her from doing anything she does not choose, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
angels execute all Her commands.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.28 She
knows what came before them, and what will come after,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">no one
may intercede for another, except if this is pleasing to Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
nearly faint at the great love received from Her which fills them
completely with peace and joy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.29
Whoever claims that they are a goddess besides Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">is
mistaken and is not an angel, and she only misleads the unjust.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.30 Do
not the unbelievers know that the heavens and the earth were once
solid,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
they were separated by Her, and we made every living thing from water,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">some
minerals from the earth, and a divine spark? Why will they not believe
when this is so very obvious?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.31 And
we placed stable mountains on the earth, so that it would not move with
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
made broad passages between them for paths, so that they could be
directed in their journeys;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.32 and
we made the heaven a well supported roof.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.33 It
is She who has created the night and the day, and the sun and the
moon,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and all
the celestial bodies which move swiftly in their assigned orbits.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.34 We
have not granted to any woman eternal permanency in this world;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
they die they are immortal human beings but spirit entities.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.35
Every soul shall taste death; and you have been provided with means for
evil if you so chose,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but there
is much good, and all of this is a trial and school for you, and to
heaven you will assuredly return.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.36
When some unbelieving people see you, they will receive you only with
scoffing, saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Is this
the person who mentions our favorite self centered deities only with
contempt?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Even when
we know that greed and power is only what humans naturally
desire?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They do
not believe what is told to them by the Merciful Lady.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.37
Many people desire only to be hasty and
inconsiderate.<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">After
this, you will be shown signs and miracles so that you will not wish to
hasten to evil.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.38
Some people ask, “When will this event of resurrection be accomplished,
if you speak the truth?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.39 If
the people who believe this did know that the time will certainly
come</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
will not be able to drive away the sadness from their faces, nor from
their backs,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
they have their friends as assistants, then they would not want to
hasten this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.40 But
times of vengeance come from people only, not from Goddess, for She is
pure love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">People
who believe that Goddess has negative emotions will be stricken with
astonishment,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
not be able to believe it, and there will be no vengeance for those that
seek it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.41
Other prophetesses have been mocked before you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
were saddened for what they had done later, on they day of their
resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
saw what the prophetess said was true, and they saw all the love they
could have disseminated.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.42 Say
to the scoffers, “What have you received by night and day from the
Merciful Lady?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">What has
this benefitted you when you see the peace and love in the countenances
of the believers?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet they
utterly neglect the remembrance of their Lady of Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.43 Do
they think that their self centered goddesses will defend them, besides
the angels of heaven?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They are
not able to help themselves, nor shall they assisted by us as their
companions.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.44 But
we have permitted some women and their mothers to enjoy worldly
prosperity, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so long
as life was continued for them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do they
not perceive that the angels come to the land of the unbelievers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
enlarge the borders of believers, making them straight? Will the
unbelievers be the conquerors?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.45 Say
to the people, “I only preach to you the revelations of Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
intentionally deaf will not hear your call, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whenever
they are preached to, because they do not desire it.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.46 Yet
if the least breath of the sadness which is to come falls on
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
surely say, “Alas for us!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>We were
certainly unjust!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.47 We
will appoint just balances on each day of resurrection; neither shall
any soul be injured at all;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
the merit or guilt of a single action be only the weight of a mustard
seed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it will
be duly noted and there will be an accounting to the soul.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.48 We
formerly gave to Miriam and Alana the Law, with clear distinctions
between good and evil,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and a
light and instructions to the pious;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.49
those that love the Lady of Light in secret, and those who look forward
to greater understanding </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of their resurrection and do not fear it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
know Goddess is all love and She will gently lead them, will certainly
be blessed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.50 And
this is a blessed Book which we have sent to the people, and why should
they reject it?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.51 And
we gave Sarah a true direction for her people, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
knew she was worthy of the revelations with which she was
favored.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.52
Remember when she said to her parents and her people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Why do
you need so many images, to which you are entirely devoted to,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to remind
you of the One True Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.53
They replied, “These are the negative goddesses our parents worshiped,
and they do well by us.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.54 She
told everyone that they were mistaken by this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.55 But
they replied, “Do you seriously tell us the truth, or are you just
someone that jests with us?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.56 She
replied, “Certainly your Lady of Light is the Lady of the heavens and
the earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is She
who has created you; and I am sent to bear witness to this fact.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.57 “By
the commands of Goddess, I will endeavor to show you that idols of
greed, wealth and power,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">do you no
good, and they actually do you harm, and you should turn your backs on
them.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.58 And
in the people’s absence, she went into the temple where the idols
stood,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
wrote down before each statute how it could do them harm,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">(i.e.,
worshiping just beauty, just wealth, just greed, just hate, just
violence, etc.);</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
the people understood and sold the statutes as works of art, donating
the money to the poor,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and left
only one statute, so that the people could lay blame on that
one.<a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.59 And
when other people returned and saw the statues were gone and
sold,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
said, “Who has done this to our goddesses?<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>She is certainly impious.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.60 And
certain people then answered, “We heard a young woman speak
reproachfully of them: </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">her name
is Sarah.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.61
They said, bring her before all the people, so they may try her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.62 And
when she was brought before the assembly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they said
to her, “Why have you done this to our goddesses, O Sarah?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.63 She
answered, “The largest statute did it, and you may request that it speak
to you now.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.64
There was an uproar, and when they regained their composure,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
said, one to the other, “She is one of the impious persons,” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.65 and
many lapsed into their former obstinacy, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
said, “Certainly you know these statutes do not speak.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.66
Sarah answered, “But you let the people worship, besides the Lady of
Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">statutes
in the form of hate, vengeance, greed, wealth, and other negative
emotions and actions,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
know this will not profit you in the end, yet they can injure your
soul.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.67
“Shame on you all, and on the negative goddesses you worship besides the
One True Goddess!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do you
not understand?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.68 The
people declared, “Burn her, and avenge our goddesses, for these are
goddesses of hate, vengeance and death, and we desire to have such
emotions; if you do this, all will be well.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.69 And
when Sarah was thrown onto the burning pyre,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">heaven
pronounced, “Fire!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Be cold, and a
preservation to Sarah,” and the fire did as it was commanded.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.70 So
when they wanted to bring an evil plot against her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they were
the ones that suffered, returning to old, evil
goddesses.<a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.71 And
when we delivered her, and Wileh,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we
brought them into the land where we have blessed all creatures.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.72 And
we bestowed upon her Iris and Jacklyn, as an additional gift, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
made both of them righteous persons and prophetesses.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.73 We
also made them models of religion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
might direct others by our command,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
inspired into them the doing of good works,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
observance of prayer, and the giving of alms, and they served us.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.74 And
unto Wileh we gave wisdom and knowledge,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
delivered her out of the city which committed filthy crimes</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by the
people who were violent, hateful, vengeful, and oppressed others,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
were a wicked and insolent
people;<a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.75 and
we let her into our mercy, for she was an upright person.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.76 And
remember Nora, when she called on Goddess to deliver her family and
friends</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from
imminent natural destruction, before the prophetesses above mentioned,
and we heard her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
delivered her and her family from a great disaster;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.77 and
we protected her from those that were not loving,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
giving and forgiving, and they were allowed to drown,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they did not turn to Goddess and heaven for help.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.78 And
remember Denise and Salome, when they pronounced judgment concerning a
field,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where the
sheep of certain people had fed there by
night,<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
any shepherd, and we were witnesses of what happened to them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.79 and
we gave the understanding of this to Salome.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And upon
all of them we bestowed wisdom and knowledge.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And we
compelled the mountains to praise us, with Denise; and the birds
also,<a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
did this to show the people the magnificent power of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.80 And
we taught many people the art of making coats of mail for you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
you would be protected against base war mongers, so will the people now
be thankful?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.81 And
to Salome we subjected a strong wind,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it blew
at her command to the land where we had bestowed our blessings, and we
knew all things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.82 And
we also subjected to her command divers, who might dive into the sea to
obtain pearls for her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to do
other work besides this, and we watched over them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.83 And
remember Joan when she cried to her Lady of Light, saying “Certainly
evil has assailed
me,<a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
are the most merciful of those that give mercy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.84
Therefore we heard her and relieved her from the evil which had come to
her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and her
family was restored, and as many more with them, through our
mercy,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for a
sign for those that serve and love Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.85 And
remember the other wonderful prophetesses. Many were patient
persons,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.86
therefore we led them in our mercy; for they were righteous
doers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
remember Joanie, when she departed
angry,<a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
thought that we could not exercise our power over her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.87 And
she cried out in the darkness, saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“There is
no Goddess besides You; all praises be for Her! Certainly I was one of
the unjust.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.88
Therefore, we heard her, and we delivered her from affliction, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as we
always deliver the true believers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.89 And
remember Elizabeth, when she called upon her Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying,
“O Lady of Light, leave me not childless; even though you are the best
heir.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.90
Therefore we heard her and we gave her Jane the Baptizer;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
rendered her husband potent and fit for bearing a child as a blessing to
them both.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These
prophetesses strove to excel in good works, and they called upon us with
hope and love,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
humbled themselves before us.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.91 And
remember Mother Mary who preserved her
chasteness,<a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and into
whom we breathed our spirit, ordaining her and her son for a miracle to
all creatures.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.92
Certainly the religions also of Christians, Jews, pagans and others that
teach of a loving Goddess</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">are one
true religion also, provided that none in any particular house of
worship preaches</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">evil,
war, hate or violence, including sexism and discrimination; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I am
your Lady of Light, therefore serve Me.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.93 But
certain religions have made schisms among themselves,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
does not matter, and all will appear with love before us on the day of
their resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.94
Whosoever shall do good works, be a true believer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there
will be no denial of the reward due to her endeavors; and we will surely
write it down for her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.95 An
inviolable prohibition is laid on every extinct city; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.96 for
the city will not return until God and Magog will have a passage opened
for
them,<a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall hasten from every high hill,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.97 and
the certain promise shall draw near to be fulfilled,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
behold the eyes of the unfaithful will be fixed with
astonishment,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will say, “Alas for us! We were regardless of this day, and we
erred.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.98
Certainly both you, the women of Mecca, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
idols of hate, vengeance, evil, violence, wealth and greed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which you
worshiped besides Goddess, will not prosper, and you will not escape
this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.99 If
such concepts were really goddesses, they would not be near to
evil,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
would not allow any to escape the trials of evil.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.100
For on earth, without a protectress they will groan with anguish, and
they will be deaf to goodness.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.101 As
for those that the most excellent reward of paradise has been reserved
by us, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be transported far away,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.102<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>they will not hear the groans on earth
and the trials and tribulations there,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall continue forever in the felicity and love that their souls
desire.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.103
The greatest terror will not trouble them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
angels will meet them to congratulate them, saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This is
your day which you were promised.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.104 On
that day we will roll up the heavens, as the angel al Sijil rolls up the
scroll</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
records the actions of everyone.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">As the
first creature was made out of nothing, except a divine spark, some
minerals from earth and water,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so we
will also raise up each soul out of nothing on the day of their
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For this
is a promise which we will fulfil; we will surely perform it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.105
And we have written in the psalms, after the promulgation of the
law,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that My
servants, the righteous ones, they shall inherit paradise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.106
Certainly in this Book are contained sufficient paths to your salvation,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
people who serve and love Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.107 We
have not sent you, our prophetess, but as a mercy to all
creatures.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say
“Nothing else has been revealed to me, but your Goddess is one
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will you
then be resigned unto Her?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.108
But if they turn their backs to the confession of Goddess’ unity, and
the last day,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">say, “I
proclaim that you will be saddened on the day of your
resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for all
the good that you might have done, if you had only believed that Goddess
is pure love,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but I do
not know when this will happen, if it is near or if it is a long time
away.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.109
“Certainly Goddess knows all the discussions you have in public,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
also knows the ones you hold in private.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.110 “I
do not know: perhaps the respite that might occur is only a trial for
you; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
might enjoy the prosperity of this world for a short time
longer.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.111
Say to the people, “Lady of Light, judge between me and those</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
would not serve You with truth and their love.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">21.112
Our Lady of Light is the Merciful Lady;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whose
assistance is to be implored against the trials and tribulations of

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In the
name of the most Merciful Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.1 O
people, love your Lady of Light and do good works.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Otherwise,<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>you will be terribly saddened on the
day of your resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when you
see all the good that you could have done, if you chose Her for a guide
and protectress.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.2 On
the day where you shall see it, every woman will no longer need to nurse
her infant,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and every
woman that is pregnant will bear a healthy baby that day, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and many
people will appear to be drunk, yet they are not drunk with liquor,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but only
from peace and joy, and the method of Goddess is love, pure love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.3
There is a person who disputes concerning Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that does
not have any real knowledge of Her, and he follows every rebellious
devil;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">he spews
hatred and prejudice, and for whom it is decreed;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.4
whomever will take him for a patron, he will seduce her and lead her
into torment and tribulations.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.5 O
people, if you are in doubt concerning the resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">consider
that you were once created from a divine spark; afterwards of an ovum,
and then an embryo,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then of
flesh, perfectly formed in part, and imperfectly formed in part;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that we
make our power obvious to you; and we caused that which we created to
grow in the womb,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until it
is time to deliver the baby. Then we bring forth infants, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
we permit you to attain your age of majority,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and while
one might die in youth, another may reach a decrepit old age, sometimes
without memory.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You see
the earth sometimes dried up and barren; but when we send down rain upon
it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is put
in full growth and it swells, and it produces every kind of luxuriant
vegetation.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.6 This
shows that Goddess is the truth, and She raises the dead to life, and
that She is almighty;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.7 and
that the hour of your understanding will certainly come to you; there is
no doubt of this,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess will raise again those who are corpses.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.8
There is a woman who disputes concerning concepts of Goddess</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
either knowledge or direction, or an enlightening Book;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.9 she
proudly turns the minds of others,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that She
may seduce the people away from the truth concerning Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Ignominy
shall attend her in this world;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and on
the day of her resurrection she will see all the pain she caused,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">all of
those persons who could have done great good in the world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
that she taught them Goddess is judgmental, full of vengeance, rage,
hate and violence, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when She
is clearly not; She is pure love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.10 On
the day of her resurrection it will be said to her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This
your soul will grieve because of that error which your mouth
committed</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to injure
your soul; for Goddess is not unjust towards any person.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.11
There are some people who serve Goddess in a wavering manner, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">standing,
as it were, on the verge of true religion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet if
good happens to any of them, they are steadfast;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but if
any tribulation befalls them, then they turn around,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with the
loss of both this world and of the life to come. This is manifest
sadness.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.12 She
will call upon her idols of wealth and power,<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>but not upon her Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
false idols can neither hurt her nor profit her in the end. This is an
error that is far from the truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.13 She
will invoke those idols of wealth and power who will sooner</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">be of
hurt to a worshiper than of any advantage.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Such is
surely a miserable patron, and a miserable companion.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.14 But
Goddess will introduce those who shall believe,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
righteous works, into gardens through which rivers flow;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess does what She finds good and just.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.15
Whoever thinks that Goddess will not assist Her prophetess in this world
and in the world to come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">let her
stretch a rope towards heaven, then let her put an end to her
life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and see
whether or not such a device may render the prophetess ineffectual,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
at the time many people were quite angry that evil would be condoned no
longer.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.16
Therefore we have sent down the Korana, with evident signs and
miracles;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess directs whomever asks for direction, as this is pleasing to
Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.17 As
to the true believers, and those of certain religions and sects, which
follow darkness and
hate,<a href="#_ftn31" id="_ftnref31"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">including
pagans and magicians, certainly Goddess will also show them
everything</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of their resurrection; for Goddess is witness to all things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.18 Do
you not perceive that all creatures, both in heaven and on the earth
adore Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
sun and the moon and the stars and the mountains,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
trees and the beasts and many people?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>But many people need discipline in their lives,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whosoever Goddess finds in trouble, She will assist, even to honor,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess does what is wonderful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.19
There are two opposite parties, those who do not dispute concerning
their Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that do,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.20 and
those who fully believe in Her will have </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a simple
life with trials and tribulations fitted to them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
who believe will have warm water showered over their heads,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">their
stomachs will be filled with delicious foods, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
skins will be anointed with the finest oils,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.21 and
they will be given the best massages for their
skin.<a href="#_ftn32" id="_ftnref32"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.22 But
for those that do not believe, so often as they will endeavor to get out
of earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
of the anguish of their torments, they will go back there over and over,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet the
angels will say to them, “Repent and turn to Goddess, repent and turn to
Goddess, </span>

cycle of rebirth to earth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.23
Goddess will introduce those who shall believe, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and act
righteously, into gardens through which rivers flow,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where
they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their
garments will be made from silk.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.24
They will be directed to a good saying, and will be directed in an
honorable way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.25 But
those people who disbelieve, and obstruct the ways of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
hinder the people from visiting the holy temple,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which has
been appointed for a place of worship for all people;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
inhabitants thereof, and the stranger and even the unbeliever have an
equal right to visit it;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whosoever shall seek impiously to profane it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
cause them to find sadness and see their error on the day of their
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.26
Remember when we gave the site of the house of the Caaba for an abode to
Sarah, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying,
“Do not associate negative emotions with Me; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
cleanse My house for those who will walk around it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
who stand up in it, and those who will bow down to worship in
it.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.27 And
proclaim to the people a solemn pilgrimage,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if they
desire it, let them come on foot, and on a lean camel, arriving from
every distant road;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.28
that they may be witnesses of the advantages which accrue to them
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from them
visiting this holy place,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
may commemorate the name of Goddess on the appointed days,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
gratitude for the cattle which Goddess has given the people.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore,
you may eat of the cattle, and you should feed the needy and the
poor.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.29
Afterwards let them put an end to the neglect of their persons;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and let
them pay their vows and let them walk around the ancient
buildings.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.30
This you should let them do. And whomever shall regard highly the sacred
ordinances of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this will
be better for her in the sight of her Lady of Light. All types of cattle
are allowed for you to eat,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
those which have been told to you, in the former passages of the Korana,
to be forbidden.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
depart from the abomination of negative idols, and avoid speaking of
anything which is false;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.31 be
liberal with respect to loving Goddess, associate no dark or evil
emotion with Her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
whomever associates anything dark or negative with Her is in wide
error.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For such
an action is like something that falls from heaven, and which the birds
snatch away,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or the
wind blows to a distant place.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.32
This is the situation you will encounter. And whoever makes valuable
offerings to Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
they proceed from the piousness of women’s hearts.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.33 You
receive certain advantages from the cattle designated for
sacrifices,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until a
determined time for slaying them; then the place of sacrificing them is
at the ancient
house.<a href="#_ftn33" id="_ftnref33"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.34 To
the professors of every religion, heaven has appointed certain
rites,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that the
people may commemorate the name of Goddess while slaying the cattle
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which She
had provided for them as a gift to the poor and needy for their
nourishment.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.35
Your Goddess is one Goddess, therefore resign yourselves entirely to
Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And bear
good greetings to those that humble themselves,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whose
hearts, when mention is made of Goddess, are struck with joy and love
for all;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
those who patiently endure everything which befalls them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
duly perform their prayers, and give alms out of what heaven has
bestowed upon them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.36 The
camels slain for sacrifice have been appointed for you as symbols of
obedience to Goddess; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you also
receive other advantages from them. Therefore commemorate the name of
Goddess over them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when you
slay them, standing on their feet disposed in the right
order,<a href="#_ftn34" id="_ftnref34"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
whatever is most comfortable for the animal, and treat them kindly
always,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
they fall down dead, you may eat of them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and also
give their meat to persons in need that do not ask for it, and also
those that beg openly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus
heaven has given you dominion over them, and you might return thanks to
us.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.37
Although Goddess does not Herself need the flesh of any animal,<span
style="mso-tab-count:2">                 </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor does
She need animal blood, but She accepts your piety.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus you
have been given dominion over these animals, so that you may praise and
magnify Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
revelations She has given to you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.38 And
bear good tidings to the righteous, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
Goddess will distinguish the ill designs of the unbeliever from the true
believers;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess forgets perdition, but loves Her people perfectly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.39
Permission is granted to those who take up nonviolent arms and protest
peacefully</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">against
the unbelievers, when the believers have been unjustly
persecuted,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess is certainly able to assist them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.40 and
for those who have been turned out of their homes unjustly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and not
for any other reason other than they say, “We worship Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And if
Goddess did not repel the violence of some people by others,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
nunneries, churches, synagogues and the temples of the</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Moslemas,
where the name of Goddess is frequently commemorated,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">would
have been utterly demolished. Peaceable resistance is best, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
are allowed to defend yourselves and do so in the manner that causes the
least amount of harm.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Goddess will certainly assist her who shall be on Her side, for Goddess
is strong and mighty.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.41 And
She will assist those who have been well established in the
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those who
observe prayer, and give alms, and command what is just, and forbid what
is unjust to others.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And to
Goddess will be the end of all things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.42 If
the people accuse you, O prophetess, of being a fraud, consider that,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">before
these people were here, the people of Nora, and the many ancient
tribes,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.43 and
the people of Sarah, and the people of Wileh,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.44 and
the inhabitants of Marian, all of these accused their prophetesses of
being fraudulent;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Miriam was also charged with fraud, and a long respite was granted to
the unbelievers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
afterwards they were shown the error of their ways, and all the good
they might have done;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and each
of them had their condition changed, so they might further learn.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.45
Many cities were destroyed from natural causes,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
only survivors were those that believed the prophetesses;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
ungoddessly are gone and many roofs fell into ruin.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do the
people not see how many wells have been abandoned, and how many lofty
castles are gone?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.46 Do
the people not journey through the land? And have they not hearts to
understand this with,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or ears
to hear the tales with? Certainly as to these things their eyes are not
blind,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
hearts within their own breasts are blind. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.47 The
unbelievers will urge you to hasten the day of their
resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess will never fail to do exactly what She has promised,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
certainly one day with the Lady of Light is the same as one thousand of
your years.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.48 How
many cities have been granted respite from natural disasters?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet
afterwards, on their last day, we did show them their error,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and many
others will surely be shown the same on their last day.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.49
Say, “O people, certainly I am only a public preacher to you,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.50 and
those who believe, and do good works, shall obtain forgiveness and an
honorable provision.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.51 But
as for those who endeavor to show others that </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the signs
and miracles of the Lady are of no effect, will be saddened on the day
of their resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.52 We
have sent prophetesses before you, except when some preached,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Evil
arose and suggested some false error in her reading.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
Goddess shall made void that which Evil previously suggested,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it was a
temptation to those within whose hearts there is darkness, and those
whose hearts are hardened,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">(for the
ungoddessly certainly present nasty arguments far from the
truth).</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.53 But
this Goddess permits free will, so that She can see what is in each
person’s heart,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
has hardened their own heart,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
ungoddessly are certainly in perpetual disagreement and far from the
truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.54 and
they upon whom knowledge has been bestowed</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will know
that this good Book is the truth from your Lady of Light, and that they
may believe in it;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
hearts may be opened wide to accept it;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is certainly the director of those that believe, into the right
way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.55 But
the unfaithful will not cease to proffer many doubts concerning
it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">up and
until their moment of resurrection and judgment, which will suddenly
come to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or until
they hear the blessings of the Lady for Her good understanding of what
they have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.56 On
that day the Queendom shall be Goddess’, She shall advise all of
them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And those
persons who shall have believed, and shall have wrought
righteousness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall be
in gardens of pleasure;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.57 but
those people who shall have not believed, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that charged the signs and miracles of the Divine with falseness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
shall suffer soul saddness and torment when they</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">see and
realize all the good they could have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.58 And
as to those who shall have fled their country for the sake of Goddess’
true religion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
afterwards shall have been slain, or shall have died,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">upon them
Goddess will bestow an excellent provision; and Goddess is the best
provider.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.59 She
will certainly introduce them with a very pleasing introduction;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is all knowing and gracious.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.60
This is the way it will be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Whoever shall refrain from taking vengeance equal to the </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">injury
that has been done to them, shall be blessed; and if she is afterwards
unjustly treated, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
will assist her; for Goddess is merciful, and ready to forgive.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.61
This will be done, for Goddess causes the night to follow the
day,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
causes the day to follow the night; and thus Goddess both hears and sees
all in between.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.62
This is because Goddess is the truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
anything the people invoke for hate, vengeance, self-centeredness and
greed is in vain;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is the greatest entity and the almighty.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.63 Do
you not see that Goddess sends down water from heaven,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
makes the earth become green? For Goddess is gracious and wise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.64 To
Her belongs whatever is in heaven and upon the earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess is self sufficient and worthy of your praise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.65 Do
you not see that Goddess has subjected whatever is in the earth to your
service, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and also
the ships which sail upon the sea, by Her command?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And She
holds up the very heavens so that they do not fall upon the earth,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is gracious to womankind, and She is merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.66 It
is She who has given you your life, and it is with Her you shall face
death;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">afterwards
She will again raise you to everlasting life, on the day of your
resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but many
people are certainly ungrateful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.67 To
the professors of every religion we have appointed certain rites, which
they observe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You do
not need to engage in disputes concerning these rites; but invite them
to love your Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for this
is the right direction.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.68 But
if they enter into needless arguments with you, answer, “Goddess knows
what you do;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.69
“for Goddess will advise you as to what you did on the day of your
resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though you argue about it now.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.70 Do
you not know that Goddess knows everything about whatever is in heaven
and upon the earth?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
this is all written in the Book of Her decrees; and this task is easy
for Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.71 The
people associate things with Goddess, for which there is no proof or
knowledge,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
unjust doers should understand that greed, vengeance, hate </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and self
centeredness will never assist them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.72 And
when our obvious miracles are shown to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
might perceive, in the minds of the unbelievers, a disdain for it;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for all
they rush into is violence and hate against the believers when they
discuss our miracles.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
them, “Shall I tell you a worse thing than this? Would you believe if I
threatened you with hell fire?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">No you
would not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>So all I will tell you
about is the great love </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
has for you if you would only believe.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.73 O
women, a parable is told to you; therefore listen to it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
the idols of greed, power, wealth and self centeredness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which you
worship, besides Goddess, can never create even a single fly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even if
all were assembled before you for that very purpose;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
the fly snatched anything from the people near to it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
could not recover even a bit of it from a tiny fly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.74 No
one here on earth can judge Goddess based upon only what they have
learned here on earth, according to their own judgment.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.75
Goddess chooses messengers from among the angels,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and from
among women here on earth; for Goddess is She who hears and sees
everything.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.76 She
knows everything which is before any person, and anything which is
behind them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
Goddess shall all things return.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.77 O
true believers bow down, humble yourselves, and worship your Lady of
Light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and work
righteousness so that you might be happy;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">22.78 and
fight a nonviolent fight in defense of Goddess’ true religion, as it
behooves you to fight for this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She has
chosen you, and has not imposed upon you any difficulty</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in a
religion which She has given you ample ability to perform,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is the
religion of your foremother Sarah; She has named you Moselmas before and
in this Book;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that our
prophetesses may be a witness for you upon the day of your
judgment,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
might be witnesses for the good among womankind. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore
be frequent at prayer; and give alms; and adhere firmly to the love of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She is
your Mistress, and She is the best Mistress; and She is the best

they desire.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.12
Before this, we created woman of minerals and water of the earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and a
divine spark was issued from Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.13 and
then she became an ovum in the womb;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.14
afterwards the ovum was supported by blood, and it became flesh; and
flesh became bones;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
bones were clothed with more flesh; and you became an infant, then a
child, then an adult.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore,
blessed be Goddess, the most excellent Creatress!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.15
After this you shall die;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.16 and
afterwards you will be restored to life, on the day of your
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.17 And
heaven has created over you seven heavens; and heaven does not neglect
what it has created.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.18 And
we send down rain from heaven, by measure; and we cause it to remain on
the earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
you might be deprived of it from time to time, your faith should sustain
you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.19 And
we created gardens of palm trees for you, and vineyards, to spring forth
for you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so you
shall have many fruits to eat of.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.20 And
we raised a tree for you from Mt. Sinai; which produces oil, and a sauce
for those who eat it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.21 You
also have a lesson in the cattle; we give you milk to drink, from their
udders,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
receive many advantages from them; and you also may eat them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.22 and
ride upon them, and upon ships you are carried.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.23 We
sent Nora to her people, and she said, “O my people, serve your
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
should not have any other Goddess besides Her; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
should not be concerned about worshiping anything else.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.24 And
the leaders of the people who did not believe her said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“She is
nothing more than a woman, as you are;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she wants
to raise herself to a position of authority over you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If
Goddess had desired to send you a messenger, She would have sent the
angels;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we never
heard of this before from our foremothers.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.25
“Certainly she is no other than a woman disturbed with mental
illness;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore,
wait to see if what she predicts will come true.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.26
Nora said, “O Lady of Light, please protect me; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
people accuse me of being a false prophetess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.27 And
we revealed our orders to her, saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Make an
ark as our sign; and according to our standards. And when our decree
came to be accomplished, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">carry
onto the ark every species of animals in one pair; and also your family,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that are unbelievers, and as to those who will not listen to your
prophecies,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
drown by accord of the natural disaster which is to
come.<a href="#_ftn35" id="_ftnref35"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.28 And
when you and your family are on the ark, say</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“All
praise be to Goddess who has delivered us from a great natural
disaster.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.29 And
say, “O Lady of Light, allow me to leave this ark with a blessed
descent; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for you
are the best entity to carry me from this ark home to safety.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.30
Certainly herein are signs of the omnipotence of heaven;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
showed womankind our ways thereby.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.31
Afterwards another generation came after them, and we sent down a
prophetess from among them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
said, “Worship Goddess: you do not have any other Goddess besides
Her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">do you
not understand Her great Love for All?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.32 And
to the leaders of the people who would not believe,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
denied the afterlife and resurrection, even though heaven had sent them
affluence,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.33
they said, “This is nothing other than a woman as you are; she eats what
you eat,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
drinks what you drink,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.34
“and if you obey a woman like yourself, you will certainly
suffer.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.35
“Does she promise you, that after you die, you will become dust and
bones,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but then
you will after that be brought back to life from your graves?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.36
“You should turn away from such nonsense!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.37
“There is no other life than the present one; so that when we die, we
die, and we live once,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will not be raised again.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.38
“This is no other than an ordinary woman, who devises lies concerning
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will not believe her!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.39
Their prophetess said to them, “O Lady of Light, defend me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
have accused me of being a false prophetess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.40
Goddess answered, “After but a little while,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be shown the error of their ways and all the good they might have
done.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.41
Therefore, they shall know soul sadness, and it will justly come to
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
evil deeds were swept away, as flotsam is, when it is carried down the
river.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It is
therefore extreme sadness the ungoddessly will suffer!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.42 And
another generation was raised up after a period of time.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.43 No
nation shall see any disaster before its appointed time;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
anyone be given relief from it after the disaster, except those that
believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.44
Afterwards we sent one prophetess after another.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">So often
as a prophetess came to any nation, many charged her with
imposture;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
were shown what good they could have done;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
were also made subjects of traditional stories. And the unbelievers will
fall away! </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.45
After this, we sent Miriam, and her sister Alana, with obvious signs and
miracles and great power,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.46 she
was sent to Pharaoh </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.47 and
his princes with this; but they proudly refused to believe in
Her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.48 and
they accused Miriam of lying; and they would not listen to her
warnings,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and with
this, they entered by choice into their own destruction.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.49 And
we gave the Book of the law to Miriam, so that the children of Israel
were directed therewith.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.50 And
we appointed Yeshua and Mother Mary as a miracle,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
prepared a dwelling for them in an elevated part of the earth, as a
place of quiet and security,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
was watered with running springs.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.51 “O
prophetesses, eat of those things which are good for
you,<a href="#_ftn36" id="_ftnref36"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">[36]</span></span></span></span></a></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and work
righteousness; because heaven knows well what you do.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.52
This your religion is one religion, and I am your Lady of Light,
therefore love Me greatly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.53 But
women have created numerous sects in religion on this earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">every
person rejoices in the religious sect which they follow.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.54
Therefore, leave them in confusion, until a predetermined time.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.55 Do
they not think that while many have wealth and children</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
have been abundantly bestowed upon them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.56
this was only for their own good and it was not a test? But they do not
understand.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.57
Certainly those that stand in awe and love their Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.58 and
those who believe in the miracles of their Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.59 and
those who do not associate companions of evil and negativity with
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.60 and
those that give alms, with their hearts pouring out love do well</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
everyone must return to the Lady of Light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.61
these people hasten to do good works, and will be the first to receive
good.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.62
Heaven does not impose any difficulty on a soul, except according to her
ability;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with us
is a Book that is truthful; and none shall be injured that follows this
good Korana.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.63 But
some people possess hearts that drowned in negligence as to these
issues, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
have works very different from those that we have just now
mentioned,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will continue to do these mistaken works,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.64
until they are shown the error of their affluence of their fortune, by
means of sadness, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
cry aloud when they see the good they might have done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.65 but
it shall be answered to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“There is
no need to cry for your angels are all about you and they will guide
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but your
hearts need to listen to them.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.66
“The signs and miracles were read to you, but you did not listen.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Proudly
you elated yourselves, because you<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>possessed the holy temple,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.67 and
they freely discussed many subjects together by night, but they talked
foolishness.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.68 Do
they not attentively consider what they have been told?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Whether a
revelation came to them which never came to their foremothers?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.69 Or
do they not know their prophetess very well and therefore they reject
her?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.70 Or
do they say, “She is insane!” No, but she comes to them with the
truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
greater part of them detest the truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.71 If
the dark entities had followed their desires, certainly the heavens and
the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whatever is therein, would have been corrupted. But heaven has brought
them light and love,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet many
turned away from light and love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.72 Do
you ask of them any payment for your preaching? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For the
sustenance of the Lady of Light is better; for She is the most bounteous
provider.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.73 You
certainly invite all to the right way of love and light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.74 and
those who do not believe in the life to come, have certainly deviated
from that way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.75 If
heaven had compassion upon them, and had taken them from calamities
which had befallen them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
would have continued to wander in error.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.76 For
heaven has sent them love and adverse experiences,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet still
they have not humbled themselves before the Lady of Light, nor did they
worship Her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.77 But
then we opened up for them a door, with rich life experiences,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">many were
difficult, and they experienced despair.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.78 For
it is Goddess who has created in you the senses of hearing and of
sight,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so you
may perceive teachings from heaven; and your hearts may learn,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
may seriously consider them, but few give thanks!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.79 It
is Goddess who has produced you upon the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
before Her you shall be all assembled together.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.80 It
is She who gives life, and who is with you at death,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
before Her you will all be assembled together.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.81 But
the unbelievers say as did their predecessors,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.82
“When we are dead, we become dust and bones, there is no way we will
return to life!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.83 “We
have already been promised this, and so were our foremothers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
is only fables of the ancients because we have never seen it.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.84 Say
to them, “Who do you believe holds the earth, and whatever is within
it?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.85
They will answer, “It belongs to Goddess.” Say, “Will you not therefore
consider this?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.86 Ask
them, “Who is the Lady of the seven heavens and the Lady of the
magnificent throne?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.87
They will answer, “They all belong to Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Ask them,
“Will you therefore not love Her greatly for all this?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.88 Ask
them, “In whose hand is the Queendom of all things?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Who
protects everyone, but is protected by no one? Do you know?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.89
They will answer, “This is all Goddess.’” Ask them, “Then how are you in
denial as to all of this?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.90 For
heaven has brought them the truth; and yet they deny the truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.91
Goddess does not possess negative human emotions</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of hate,
jealousy, vengeance; nor does She live with this;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">otherwise,
heaven would not be a place of joy, peace, harmony and beauty, which it
clearly is.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.92 Far
be it from Goddess, what most people associate with Her!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She knows
what is concealed, and what is made public;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
far be it from Her to have people accuse Her of negative thoughts,
emotions and deeds.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.93 Say
to the people, “O Lady of Light, please show them the love</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which you
have promised them and myself.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.94 “O
Lady of Light, do not place me with the ungoddessly people;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.95 for
we are surely able to make them all see your wonder, beauty and infinite
love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.96
That the people might turn from evil back to love,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
far better, for we all well know the evil they utter against
You.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.97 “O
Lady of Light, I fly to your refuge, against the suggestions of
Evil;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.98 and
I have your assistance, O Lady of Light, to drive them away, so they are
not near me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.99 The
false declarations of the unbelievers will not cease, until death
overtakes them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
they will plead to enter into life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.100
and they will promise to do what is right; they will promise to profess
true faith, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
what they have neglected, but this will not happen with them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These are
the words which the unbelievers will speak when they experience
death,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
will encounter a partition on the day of their resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
earth immediately they will return, which is not paradise, and which
will be like hell for them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.101
Then on one final fateful day, the trumpet will sound,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
will be no relation between what they desire on that day, and what they
will be provided with,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
they be able to receive assistance from any other entity.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.102 On
the day of their resurrection, those who have balances laden with
goodness will be happy,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.103
but those who have little goodness, but mostly evil will return to
earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
shall be like hell for them; they will not enter paradise then.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.104
The heat of the sun will beat upon them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
fire of troubles and difficulties shall continue to burn for
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will writhe with illness, when it happens, which it will,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.105
and it will be said to them, “You were informed of the signs and
miracles of the Lady of Light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet you
declared Her love and light to be false to you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.106
They will answer, “O Lady of Light, unhappiness overtook us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
were people who were led astray by others.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.107 “O
Lady of Light, take us from these difficulties;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we have
learned, and we know our former wickedness made us one of the
unjust.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.108
“You shall return to earth, the land of troubles, for it is not time for
Me to deliver you just yet.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.109
Certainly there are some servants who said, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O Lady
of Light, we believe, therefore forgive us, and be merciful to
us;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for you
are the best of all entities who show mercy.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.110
But many people treated them in a scoffing, deriding manner,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
they suffered and they were laughed at with scorn.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.111But
when they are resurrected, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">heaven
acknowledges the nastiness they experienced with great patience; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
they will enjoy great happiness.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.112
Goddess will ask them, “What number of lifetimes do you think that you
lived upon earth?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.113
They will answer, “We have lived there only one, for that is all we
recall.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But they
will ask those angels who keep accounts of this,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.114<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>and they will inform them they have
lived many, and without entering into paradise
ever.<a href="#_ftn37" id="_ftnref37"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.115
They will be asked, “Do you think you were created and lived on earth in
sport, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
would not be asked to perfect, grow and learn towards love and the
light?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.116
Therefore, let Goddess be exalted, as the Queen, the Truth!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">There is
no Goddess besides Her, the Lady of Light of the honorable
throne.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Whoever
will associate any negative emotion with Her, will have no demonstrative
proof of that;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will be correctly informed of this later.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">23.117
Say, “O Lady of Light, pardon us and show us your mercy,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In the
name of the most Merciful Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.1 This
chapter has been sent down from heaven; and it has been ratified,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
heaven has revealed evident signs and miracles,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to show
you all the great love which Goddess has for you all.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.2 The
prostitute and the prostitute’s customer should not be scourged with a
hundred stripes, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or any
beatings whatsoever, for Goddess does not allow cruel and torturous
punishments.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
expects you to show strength, compassion and humanity,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where
ever you are, and to speak out for the oppressed;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if you
believe in Goddess and the last day, and let the true believers exert
only fair and just punishments,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">not
involving bodily injury or mental abuse.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.3 A
prostitute’s customer that repents shall be forgiven, and shall be
allowed to marry a believer.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And a
prostitute that repents may also be allowed to marry a true
believer.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But those
that actively and openly practice prostitution and solicit prostitutes,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">should
only marry among themselves, to prevent sadness to those that are chaste
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
she repents and asks forgiveness and turns to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.4 But
as to those that accuse women of prostitution,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or they
accuse men of soliciting prostitutes, they must show credible evidence
of such accusations,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or they
may be sued for damages to reputation.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.5
However, those false accusers who repent and amend,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to those
persons Goddess will be gracious and merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.6 Men
who accuse their wives of adultery, and have no credible evidence
thereof, besides themselves,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">must
swear four times that he has spoken the truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.7 and
the fifth time, Goddess alone will be the judge, if he is a liar.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.8 And
it shall avert the punishment from the wife, if she swears four times by
Goddess that he is a liar;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.9 and
on the fifth time she swears that she has spoken the truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">upon the
fifth time, Goddess alone will be the judge, if she is a liar.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.10 If
it were not for the indulgence of Goddess towards you, and Her mercy
upon you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
fact that Goddess is easy to be reconciled, and She is wise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She would
immediately show your crimes to the world.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.11 As
to the party among you who published the falsehood concerning my
husband,<a href="#_ftn38" id="_ftnref38"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">do not
think that your falsehood is without blame, for what you have done is
wrong.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.12<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Did not the faithful people, in the
past, judge in their own minds for the best and say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This is
certainly a falsehood.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.13 Has
anyone produced any credible witnesses thereof?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Since
they have not produced witnesses, they are liars in the sight of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.14 Had
it not been for the indulgence of Goddess towards you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and Her
mercy, in this world and in that which is to come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
you would experience great sadness for the evil which you have
spread:</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.15
when you declare lies with your tongues, and speak that which is not
true,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">things
which you have no knowledge or evidence of; and you esteem it to be of
the light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to be
of minor importance to Goddess, which it clearly is not.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.16
When you heard these rumors, did you say, “This is none of our business,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it is
evil that we should gossip about such a thing?” Goddess forbid!<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>This is grievous error.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.17 For
Goddess has warned you that you should not engage</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in such
evil thoughts and malicious rumors, if you are true believers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.18 And
Goddess has declared to you Her signs and miracles, for Goddess is
knowing and wise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.19
Certainly anyone who loves scandal shall see sadness, and this is not an
activity of a true believer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for true
believers do not rejoice in the sufferings of others,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
will be saddened on the day of their resurrection. Goddess knows all of
this, but you do not.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.20 If
it had not been for the indulgence of Goddess towards you and Her mercy,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
Goddess is gracious and merciful,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you would
have experienced great vengeance and suffering, but She does not do
this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.21 O
true believers, do not follow the steps of Evil; for whosoever shall
follow the steps of Evil;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be directed to commit filthy crimes, and that which is unlawful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If it
were not for the indulgences of Goddess and Her infinite mercy towards
all of you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there
would be no person cleansed of guilt, but Goddess cleanses all those who
ask Her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess sees and hears all you do and ask.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.22 Let
not those among you who possess abundance of wealth</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and have
ability, swear that they will not give to their kindred,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
the poor, and those who have fled their country for the sake of the one
true religion of Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but let
them forgive, and act with benevolence towards them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do you
not desire that Goddess should pardon you? And Goddess is gracious and
merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.23
Moreover, those who falsely accuse the chaste, and those who behave in a
negligent manner,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those are
not true believers, and they will suffer in this world for lack of their
Protectress,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and in
the afterlife; and they will be greatly saddened on the day of their
resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
see all the good they might have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.24 One
day their own tongues shall bear witness against them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
hands and their feet, concerning what they have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.25<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>On that day Goddess will explain the
truth to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall know that Goddess knows all truths.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.26
While it is written that dark souls will marry light ones,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
light souls shall marry the dark entities, yet some will marry their own
kind,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you will
not know when you marry what you have chosen.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It is
right for you to speak up and clear others of slander, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
shall obtain a favorable reward for doing so.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.27 O
true believers, do not enter the house of another person,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
you ask first, and have greeted the family properly, this is better for
you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.28 And
if you find no person in the house,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you shall
not enter the house, and you should leave the property promptly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If
someone tells you to stay away from a house, that has authority there,
then you shall stay away.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.29 It
is not an error to enter uninhabited, abandoned and unused homes, when
in need,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where
there are no signs posted not to do this, and you may find convenience
there.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
knows what you have discovered, and that which you conceal.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.30 And
speak to the believers, that they may restrain their eyes </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
mouths from sexually harassing others, this is better for them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is well acquainted with all that they do.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.31 And
speak to the believing men, that they restrain their eyes and their
mouths,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
preserve their appreciation for women, and they do not comment upon
their ornaments negatively, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
require them to be veiled or hidden, or that they must cover their
ornaments,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
should do this especially if they are their husbands, their fathers, or
their husbands’ fathers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or their
sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers, or their brother’s
sons,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or their
sister’s sons, or those men especially given to being self appointed and
unwarranted </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">directors
of women, which is completely in error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And women
may make noise with the ornaments of their feet, where noise is
generally permitted,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
may be free to delight in these ornaments, and no man should tell her
otherwise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And you
shall all be turned to Goddess, O true believers so that you may be
happy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.32
Those that are single among you should be free to marry</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whom they
chose and who they are in love with,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and male
and female servants shall be free to marry non-servants;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if they
are poor, Goddess will enrich you with Her abundance; for Goddess is
bounteous and wise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.33 And
let those who cannot find a match, keep away from prostitution,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until
Goddess shall enrich them of Her abundance. And for each of your
slaves,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">allow
them a written instrument that they may redeem themselves upon paying
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a
reasonable sum certain in no greater than five years, if you are to be
good to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and give
them some of your riches which Goddess has given to you and treat them
fairly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
compel not your servants to prostitute themselves,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
encourage them to live chastely or to marry, that you may seek the
advantage of this present life;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
whosoever is compelled to enter into prostitution, by means of
necessity,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
afterwards repents, certainly Goddess will be gracious and merciful to
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
believers will forgive them too and welcome them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.34 And
now heaven has revealed to you evident signs and miracles,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and a
herstory of which is much like many of the herstories which were
revealed to you before this, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it is
a declaration of the infinite love Goddess has for all people.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.35
Goddess is the light of heaven and earth; She is like a niche in a wall
where a lamp is placed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
lamp has been enclosed in a case of glass; the glass appears as if it
were a shining star.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It is
lighted with the oil of a blessed tree, and the olive tree was neither
of the east, nor of the west;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it wants
but a little oil, so that the oil would give light, although no fire
touches it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
light added to light. Goddess directs all who desire Her and Her
love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
sends wonderful parables to women; for Goddess loves all things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.36 In
the homes where Goddess is permitted to be raised up,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
Her name is commemorated therein,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">women
celebrate Her praise in the same, morning and evening,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.37
where neither merchandising nor selling diverts anyone from remembering
Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
observe frequent prayer, and they observe the giving of alms;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they look
forward to the day when they shall be shown all the good that they have
done;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.38<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>and Goddess will then add to them of
Her abundance a most excellent award;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess bestows abundance upon whom She pleases with mercy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.39 But
as to the unbelievers, their works are like the vapor upon a
plain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where the
thirsty traveler believes something to be water,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until
when she comes upon it, she finds it to be nothing at all; but she finds
Goddess with her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess will give her an account and explanation;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess is swift in providing an account with love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.40 Or,
as the darkness in a deep sea, which is covered by waves riding upon
waves,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">above
which are clouds, there are additions of darkness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">one upon
the other, when one stretches out her hand, there is no way to see
it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And to
whomever has cast herself into a world without light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
will not grant her light, until she asks for it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.41 Do
you not understand that all creatures both in heaven and earth praise
Goddess without end;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
birds also, extending their wings? Every one knows Her prayers and Her
praises,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess knows everything you do.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.42 To
Goddess belongs the Queendom of heaven and earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
Goddess you all shall return at your last day.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.43 Do
you not see that Goddess gently drives forward the clouds,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
She gathers them together, and then layers them up in heaps?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You also
see the rain, which falls from the midst of the clouds,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess sends down the rain from heaven, as if it were mountains, within
which there is hail;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
lightening is stricken where it pleases, and it misses where it
pleases;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
brightness of the lightening dazzles the eyes of the living.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.44
Goddess shifts the night to the day; herein there is an instruction to
those who have lost faith.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.45 And
Goddess has created every animal from a base of water, minerals and a
divine spark;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">some move
on their bellies, and others walk on two feet, and yet another kind
walks on four feet;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
creates what She determines is best; for Goddess is almighty.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.46 Now
heaven has sent down evident signs and miracles;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
directs each person that asks for the direction of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.47 The
hypocrites say, “We believe in Goddess, and in Her prophetess, and we
obey them,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet a
part of them turns away, after this, but they are not really true
believers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.48 And
when they are summoned before Goddess </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and Her
prophetess, that She may explain to them what they have done, a part of
them will be saddened;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.49 but
if right had been on their side, they would have come and submitted
themselves to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.50 Is
there an infirmity in their hearts? Do they doubt Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Or do
they fear Goddess, fear the prophetess and act out of fear and not
love?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But they
themselves choose to be unjust and to turn to evil.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.51 The
sayings of the true believers, when they are summoned before Goddess and
Her prophetess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that She
may explain this fact to them, is not other than they will say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“We have
heard and we will obey, so that we might prosper.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.52
Whoever will obey Goddess and Her prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and will
love Goddess greatly, and will be devout towards Her, these souls will
enjoy great happiness.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.53
They will swear by Goddess, with a most solemn oath,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
if you command them, then they will go out from their homes, and away
from their possessions.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say,
“Swear not to falsehoods and evil; obedience is required of true
believers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess is well acquainted with what you do.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.54
Say, “Obey Goddess and Her prophetess; but if you turn back, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is
expected that you will do your duty, and those of you that perform your
duty,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that obey Her, you shall be rightly directed; but the duty of a
prophetess is only to preach.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.55
Goddess promises to such of you that believes and does good
works,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that She
will cause them to succeed the unbelievers in the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as She
caused those who were before you to succeed the unbelievers of that
time, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will establish for you a religion that pleases both you and Her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will exchange your fear with security. They shall worship Her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will not associate Goddess with any false idols of wealth, power and
greed, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor with
any negative human emotions.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
whoever will disbelieve after this will follow evil and will live in
soul misery.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.56
Observe prayer and give alms and obey your prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
you may obtain the mercy of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.57 Do
not think that the desires of the unbelievers will frustrate the plans
of Goddess upon earth; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
abode hereafter shall be like hell fire,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
another journey upon this earth without a protectress will be
miserable.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.58 O
true believers, require your servants ask permission </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to come
into your private rooms before you have arisen in the morning,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
you nap during the day, then during that time, and after you retire to
bed at night.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These are
your private times, but it is no crime if they come to see you during
these times,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if a need
for frequent attendance arises, due to sickness or health. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus
Goddess declares Her signs to you; for Goddess is knowing and
wise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.59 And
when your children attain the age of puberty,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
should ask leave to come into their presence when they are in their
private areas, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
should do likewise for you. Thus Goddess declares Her signs to you,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess is knowing and wise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.60 As
for women of whatever age, childbearing or not,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">advanced
age or not, it is not any mistake or crime at all for them to lay aside
outer garments,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or show
their ornaments in public, and you should never prevent them from doing
this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For
Goddess both hears and knows all.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.61 It
is no crime to eat with the blind, nor is it a crime to eat with the
lame, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or with
the sick, nor must you only eat in your own houses, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or in the
houses of your mother,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or in the
houses of your fathers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or in the
houses of your sisters,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or in the
houses of your brothers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or in the
houses of your aunts on the mother’s side,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or in the
houses of your uncles on the mother’s side,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or in the
houses of your aunts on the father’s side,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or in the
houses of your uncles on the father’s side,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or in
those houses the keys that you have in your possession, or in the house
of your
friend.<a href="#_ftn39" id="_ftnref39"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It shall
not be any crime in you whether you eat together,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
separately, but it is best to eat as a family, whenever possible.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
you enter anyone else’s house, greet them in a friendly matter,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
part of Goddess, with a blessed and a welcome salutation.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus
Goddess declares Her signs to you, that you might understand.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.62
Certainly they only are true believers, who believe in Goddess and Her
prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
they are assembled with her on any affair, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">do not
depart until you have obtained Her permission.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">24.63 Do
not let the calling of any prophetess be found lacking in esteem among
you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as if you
were calling one to the other. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
knows which of you privately withdraw themselves from the world, taking

heed, </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
they find sadness upon the day of their resurrection,</span>

they shall return to earth, which is a grievous situation.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;"></span>

 

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In the
name of the most Merciful Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;"></span>

 

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.1
Blessed are those that have revealed the Forkana to Her servants,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that She
might be a preacher to all creatures;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.2 to
whom belongs the Queendom of heaven and earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who
performs no negative actions of war, violence, rage or jealousy, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor does
She possess any negative human emotions,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She has
created all things, and has made plans according to Her loving will, for
the benefit of all souls.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.3 Yet
many people have taken other idols besides Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">idols of
greed, wealth, power and self centeredness, they have created
nothing,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">such
idols cannot avert evil, nor can they procure good to any person,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
do not have the power of death, or of life, or of the raising of the
dead.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.4 And
the unbelievers say, “This Korana is no other than a forgery which the
prophetess</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">has
contrived; and other people have falsely assisted in this
creation;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but it is
nothing but an unjust thing and a falsehood.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.5 They
also say, “These are silly fables of the ancients,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which she
has caused to be written down, and they are dictated to her morning and
evening.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.6 Say
to these people, “She has revealed it, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Gabrielle
who knows the secrets of heaven and of earth; certainly Goddess is
gracious and merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.7 And
they will say to you, “What kind of prophetess is this?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She eats
food, and walks in the streets, just as we do; unless an angel is set
down to her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
angel becomes an assistant preacher to her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.8 or
unless a treasure is cast down to her, or she is given a great garden,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of the
fruit one may eat forever, we will not believe.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
ungoddlessly also say, “You follow nothing other than an insane
woman.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.9
Behold what they compare you with.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But they
are deceived, nor can they find anything just to reproach you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.10
Blessed is She, who, if She pleases, will make you a better provision
than people who speak like this,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">namely,
the good believers are the ones who will receive gardens through which
rivers flow; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will receive palaces and mansions there for an eternal dwelling
place.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.11 But
those people who have rejected the belief of the day of resurrection as
a falsehood;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">heaven
has prepared for them a return to the earth, which shall be like burning
fire;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.12 and
then it will seem to them a place that is roaring and raging
furiously.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.13 And
when they shall be thrown back there, all bound up with despair, back to
this difficult place,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
wish dearly for paradise;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.14 but
it will be answered them, “Do not call this day for the return of just a
few,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
will have the return of many.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.15
They will ask, “Is this better, or is a garden of eternal beauty
better,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which has
been promised to the pious?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.16 It
shall be given to the pious only, as a reward, and a retreat;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
they shall have whatever they please, and they shall continue there
forever.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is a
promise which will be delivered by the hands of the loving Lady of
Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.17 On
the day of each person’s resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be called, and on this day they may worship whatever they desire;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall say to their servants of wealth, greed, jealousy and self
centeredness, “Did you seduce me? Or did I wander from Goddess of my own
accord?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.18 And
they will be answered, “This was your own choice.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They will
reply, “It was not fitting for us, that we should take any refuge
besides Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess permitted us and our ancestors to enjoy abundance;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
we were tempted to wealth, greed and self centeredness;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so we
forgot our warnings, and we became lost.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.19 And
Goddess will reply to such worshipers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Now you
have seen the falsehood in what you have done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and your
false negative goddesses will not avert any difficulties for you,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
they provide you with any assistance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>And those of you that are guilty of injustice,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be greatly saddened when they see what they have wrought.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.20 We
have not sent any messenger to you, except they ate food and walked
through the streets;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have given you many trials that you might turn to Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Can you
persevere with patience? The Lady of Light requests your
perseverance.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.21
Those persons who hope not to meet up with sadness at their resurrection
will say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Unless
the angels are sent down to us, or we see the Lady of Light Herself, we
will not believe.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But they
behave arrogantly in doing so; and they have committed error in doing
so.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.22 On
the day when they shall see the angels, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there
will be sadness for the wicked when they see all the good they might
have done;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall say, “But this was far removed from us when we travailed the
difficulties of earth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.23 And
heaven will show them the work that they shall have wrought, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
heaven will make what evil they have done as dust scattered
abroad.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.24 On
that day, those that are destined to paradise will be most happy in
their new lovely abode, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will have a wondrous place of leisure at noon.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.25 On
that day the heaven shall be cloven in sunder by the clouds,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
angels shall be sent down, descending openly to all,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet none
will be afraid, for Goddess will be there and will give everyone peace
of mind.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.26 On
that day, the Queendom shall then pass to the Merciful;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and on
that day the unbelievers shall see all the pain they caused,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as well
as the pain they could have avoided creating for others.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.27 On
that day the unjust person shall bite his hand, out of anguish and
despair, and shall say,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“How I
regret that I did not follow the truth of the prophetess!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.28 Woe
is me!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Oh I regret greatly that I
had taken Evil for a friend!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.29 “I
have been seduced from the instruction of Goddess, even after it was
given to me;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for Evil
is the betrayer of all women.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.30 And
the prophetess shall say, “O my Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
my people honestly believed that this Korana was only a vain
composition.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.31 In
a similar manner, all prophetesses have met many enemies from among the
wicked ones; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
Lady of Light is a good director and a defender.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.32 The
unbelievers say, “Unless the Korana is sent down entirely in one
piece,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
not believe in it.” But we have revealed it in the best manner, so your
hearts might grow with it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have dictated it gradually, in distinct parcels.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.33
They shall not come to you with any strange questions;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
heaven will provide you with truth as an answer, and you will have an
excellent interpretation.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.34
Those persons who have erred and are not believers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of their resurrection, will be gently placed into a chute designed
by the angels for this purpose,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will return to earth, for they have so much to learn still,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and earth
will be like hell for them, and without a protectress, until they turn
to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.35
Heaven has before this delivered to Miriam the Book of the law;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and her
sister, Alana, for an assistant.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.36 And
heaven said to them, “Go to the people who claim that our signs and
miracles are false.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.37 And
because they did not listen,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they were
destroyed when natural disasters on earth occurred. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Also
remember the people of Nora, when they accused our prophetesses of being
false,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they also
were drown because they did not listen to their prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who could
have informed them as to how they could have avoided the great
flood.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And as
for the unbelievers, they will suffer great soul torment</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of their resurrection when they see all the good they might have
done; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess will inform them accordingly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.38
Remember also Ada and Thelma, and those who lived at Rasha,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and many
other generations who could have avoided or mitigated natural
disasters,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if only
they had listened to their prophetesses.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.39 For
each of them, heaven propounded examples for their learning and
understanding,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and each
of them left earth after a severe disaster which each could have easily
avoided.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.40
Certain peoples have passed frequently by a certain city which was
rained on by a devastating rain. Does anyone not see where this city
used to be?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet not
one of them appears to be concerned regarding the day of their
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.41
When they see a good prophetess, they only receive her with scoffing,
saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Is this
she whom Goddess has sent as an apostle?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.42
Certainly it would have been a tragedy if we were drawn away from
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">worshiping
our goddesses of wealth, power, greed and self centeredness. But they
will see hereafter,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
view the problems which lay in store for them, who has strayed further
from the right path.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.43
What are they thinking? A person who takes lust for a goddess; can lust
be a guardian?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.44 Do
they imagine that the greater part of the people hear or understand?
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They are
none other than like the brute cattle; yet, they stray fields afar from
the true path.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.45 Do
you not consider the works of the Lady of Light?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">How She
may stretch forth a shadow before sunrise?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If She
had pleased, She would have made shadows immovable forever.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.46
Then heaven causes the sun to rise, and how the earth is steeped in long
shadows is beautiful;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
afterwards heaven contracts these shadows by an easy and gradual
contraction.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.47 It
is Goddess who has given you the night time, to cover you, as if night
were a garment;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and sleep
will give you rest; and She has ordained the day for waking.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.48 It
is She who sends out the winds, driving abroad the pregnant clouds,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as the
forerunners of Her mercy; and we send down pure water from heaven,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.49
that we may thereby revive a dead country, and we give water to drink,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which we
have created, both to cattle and to the people, in vast
quantities,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.50 and
we distribute the same among them at various times, that they may
consider;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
greater part of the people refuse to consider this, only out of
ingratitude.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.51 If
heaven had pleased, there would have been a prophetess sent to every
city;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.52
therefore, do not believe the unbelievers, but in your minds oppose them
strenuously,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
openly be polite but firm in your resolution not to be mean or nasty
with them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.53 It
is Goddess who has created the two types of bodies of water; the fresh
type which is sweet, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
salty which is bitter and undrinkable;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has placed between them a land formation;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
boundaries that generally cannot be passed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.54 It
is She who has created woman of water and a divine spark;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has made woman to bear the double relationship of friends and family;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
Lady of Light is almighty.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.55
Many people worship other entities besides Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
that which can neither profit them nor hurt them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
unbeliever is an assistant of Evil against the Lady of Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.56
Heaven has sent to you a prophetess which is none other than a bearer of
good tidings,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and a
blessing of love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.57 Say
to the people, “I do not ask of you any reward for my
revelations,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">besides
the conversion of those women who wish to be guided to the way of the
Lady of Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.58 And
you should trust in Goddess who lives, but never dies;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
celebrate Her praise; (for She is well acquainted with the faults of Her
servants);</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.59<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>for She has created the heavens and
the earth, and whatever is in between them in six days, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She

is the Merciful One,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and ask
the knowing prophetesses concerning Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.60
When it has been said to the unbelievers, “Adore the Merciful One;” they
reply,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“And who
is the Merciful One? Should we just rotely adore whomever you command us
to worship?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And this
commandment simply causes some people to fly even faster from the one
true faith.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.61
Blessed be to the One that has placed the twelve astrological signs in
the heavens; and has given us the sun, as a lamp, which shines brightly
by day, and the moon which glows softly by night!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.62 It
is She who has ordained the night and the day to succeed one another
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
observation of those persons who desire to show gratitude to
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.63 The
servants of the Merciful One are those that walk meekly upon the
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
the ignorant speak to them, they always answer, “Peace,” with patience
and kindness;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.64 and
they pass the night time adoring the Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
stand or sit or meditate to pray love upon Her and the earth, and for
what She has done;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.65 and
they say, “O Lady of Light, avert us or mitigate our torments upon
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
earth which is like hell to us; for while we are here, the torment is
perpetual in nature.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.66
Certainly where they may be is often a miserable abode, and a wretched
place;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.67 and
when they bestow alms, the believer is neither profuse nor stingy,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
observe a just medium between these two extremes;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.68 and
they never invoke other entities to worship together with the One True
Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">such as
greed, jealousy, hate or violence; nor do they slay any person on earth,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but act
violently only out of a just and immediate defense of themselves or
another person; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
are not guilty of lust outside a committed relationship. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But she
who shall do this in the name of Goddess shall not meet any adverse
reward of added troubles;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.69 but
those that do evil, will continue to be reborn on earth, and upon the
day of their resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall continue to live only on the earth, without a Protectress or
guardian angels,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">faced
with much adversity and hard work;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.70
except her who shall repent and believe, and she shall work for
righteousness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and for
her Goddess will change her former evils into good; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is ready to forgive, and She is merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.71 And
whomever repents and does what is right, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
she turns to Goddess with a blessed conversion.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.72 And
those people that do not bear false witness;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
they pass by idle, annoying conversation, they pass by with decency and
do not linger.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.73 And
when the light entities see the signs and miracles of Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they do
not turn away as if they were deaf and blind, but they look closer and
are attentive.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.74 And
a light entity says, “O Lady of Light, grant me a husband and children
such that I might desire;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and make
me an example of someone that loves You greatly.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.75
Such persons shall be rewarded with the highest apartments and mansions
in paradise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they have persevered with patience,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall be met there with a joyous greeting and warm salutation;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.76
they shall remain there forever; it shall be an excellent abode, and a
delightful place.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">25.77 Say
to the people; “My Lady of Light will not solicit you until you solicit
Her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
you charge Her prophetesses with being false,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is a
severe error that will lead you away from the right path.”</span>

Disclosed herein are the signs and miracles of an easily understood
Book.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.3
Prophetess, do not worry yourself sick to death that any unbeliever will
not become a believer.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.4 If
heaven pleased, we could have sent down an easy and convincing sign or
miracle from heaven, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
would all readily submit.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.5 But
there comes no message from the Merciful One, which occurs from time to
time,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
unbelievers ignore completely, as they do not want to see or understand
it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.6 And
the unbelievers charge all the signs and miracles they encounter with
falseness;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
messages come to them, and they laugh and scorn them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
their hearts are hardened and they do not want to believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.7 Do
they not behold the earth how many types of vegetables which heaven
causes to spring up,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of every
noble and desirous species?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.8
Certainly that is a sign and miracle for people of understanding,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet the
majority of the people do not want to believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.9
Certainly your Lady of Light is the Mighty One, the Merciful
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.10
Remember when your Lady of Light called to Miriam, saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Go to
the unjust people, the people of Pharaoh; will they not come to love
Me?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.11
Miriam answered, “O Lady of Light, will they not dread me?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.12
“And I fear that Pharaoh might accuse me of being a false
prophetess,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.13
“and that my heart and courage might fail me, and my tongue will fail
me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
send my sister Alana to be my assistant in this matter.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.14
“Also, as you know, they are aware of a crime I committed some time
ago</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
might arrest me for,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>and I fear
they might put me to death.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.15
Goddess answered, “They shall certainly not put you to death;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore,<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>go with our message of signs and
miracles; for we will be with you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.16 “Go
to Pharaoh and say, ‘Certainly I am an apostle and prophetess sent by
the Lady of All Creatures;’</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.17
‘Send me away with the Children of Israel.’”<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will hear all that happens between you and them.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.18 And
when they had delivered their message,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Pharaoh
answered, “Did we not bring Miriam and Alana up among us, when they were
only children;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and have
they not been with us for many years of their lives?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.19
“Yet Miriam has done a dreadful deed, and therefore she is truly an
ungrateful person.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.20
Miriam replied, “I did this indeed, yet I knew that it was wrong, and I
deeply regret it;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.21
“therefore, I fled from you, because I feared you; but my Lady of Light
has given me wisdom, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has appointed me as one of Her prophetesses and apostles.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.22
“And this is the great favor you have granted me?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">That you
have enslaved the Children of Israel?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.23<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Pharaoh said, “And who reigns supreme
over all creatures?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.24
Miriam answered, “The Lady of heaven and earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whatever is in between reigns supreme over us all; you would understand
if you were a wise person.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.25
Pharaoh said to those who were present, “Did you not hear me?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.26
Miriam continued, “Your Lady and the Lady of your foremothers.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.27
Pharaoh replied to all those that were present, “Your apostle and
prophetess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who has
been sent to you all, is most certainly insane.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.28
Miriam said, “The Lady of the east, and of the west and of whatever is
between, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">them
reigns supreme, if you have women of understanding among you, they
already know this.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.29
Pharaoh said to her, “Certainly if you take any god besides me, I will
imprison you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.30
Miriam answered,”What? Although I came to you </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with a
most convincing miracle, you still deny me?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.31
Pharaoh replied, “Produce it therefore, if you speak the truth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.32 And
she threw down her rod, and behold, it became a serpent.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.33
Then Miriam drew forth her hand out from her blouse;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
behold, it appeared glowing white to the spectators.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.34
Pharaoh said to the princes who surrounded him, “Certainly this woman is
a skillful magician;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.35 she
seeks to dispossess us of our land through sorcery; what do you suggest
that we do about this?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.36
They answered, “Delay her and her sister by placating them with kind
words, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
seek women in the cities to assemble together,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.37 in
order to bring to you every skilled magician.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.38 So
then the magicians assembled together at an appointed time, on a solemn
day.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.39 And
it was said to the people, “Are you properly assembled together, to view
the event?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.40
“Perhaps we may follow the magicians, if they do attain victory.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.41 And
when the magicians gathered together,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
asked Pharaoh, “Will we receive a reward if we are the victors?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.42
Pharaoh answered, “Yes, I will reward you;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you will become one of those persons who may approach near to me.”<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">           </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.43
Miriam said to them, “Throw down whatever it is you will be casting
down.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.44
Wherefore, they threw down ropes and rods and said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“By the
might of Pharaoh, certainly we will be the conquerors.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.45 And
Miriam threw down her rod, and behold,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it
swallowed up those things which they had caused falsely to appear
changing into serpents.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.46
Whereupon, the magicians prostrated themselves, worshiping the Goddess
of Miriam and said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.47 “We
believe in the Lady of all creatures;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.48
“the Lady of Miriam and Alana.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.49
Pharaoh said to them, “Have you believed in Her, before I have given you
permission?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
she is your leader who has taught you magic, but after this, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.50 you
will surely know my power. I will torture you and beat you for what you
have done.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.51
They answered, “There will be no true harm done to us;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for we
shall only return to our Lady, should you even kill us.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.52 “We
hope that our Lady will forgive us our errors,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">since we
are the first who have believed among the Egyptians.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.53 And
we spoke by revelation to Miriam, saying, “March forth with the people
of Israel by night,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for you
will all be pursued.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.54 And
Pharaoh sent officers through the cities to assemble together
troops,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.55
saying, “Certainly the Israelites are a small company,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.56 and
they are enraged against us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.57 but
we are a large force well equipped.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.58 So
we caused them to leave their gardens and fountains,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.59 and
their treasures and fair homes;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.60 and
we did this, so that the Children of Israel would inherit the
same.<a href="#_ftn43" id="_ftnref43"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.61 and
they pursued them at dawn;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.62 And
when the two armies came into sight of one another, the companions of
Miriam said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“We will
most certainly be overcome by them.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.63<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Miriam answered, “Certainly not; for
my Lady of Light is with me, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will assuredly direct me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.64 And
we commanded Miriam by revelation saying, “Strike the sea with your
rod.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
she had hit it as instructed, it became divided into twelve parts,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">between
which there were many paths, and every part was like a vast
mountain.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.65 And
we drew together all the others;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.66 and
we delivered Miriam and all those that were with her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.67
Then the sea closed up again and the others were drowned because they
were not with Miriam.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.68
Certainly this was a sign for the people to believe, but the greater
part of them still did not believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.69
Certainly your Lady of Light is mighty and merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.70 And
tell the people regarding the story of Sarah, when she said to her
father, and to her people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.71
“What are you worshiping?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.72
They answered, “We worship idols of power, wealth, greed and self
centeredness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and out
of these come hate, aggression, violence and war, which we also
worship,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
constantly serve them all the day long.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.73
Sarah said, “Do they hear you, when you call to them? Or do they either
assist you or hurt you?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.74
They replied, “No, but our mothers always worshiped them.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.75
Sarah said, “The things which you worship–greed, self centeredness,
wealth, war, violence–all these things–do you understand they are evil
and wicked?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.76
“And you and your mothers were then worshiping evil.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And they are all”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.77 “my
enemy and your enemy; except for the Lady of all Creatures, a Goddess of
peace and love;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.78
“for She has created me, and She directs me;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.79
“and She gives me food to eat, and water to drink,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.80
“and when I am sick, She heals me;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.81
“and She will be with me when I die, and afterwards She will restore me
to life;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.82
“and She will, I hope, forgive all my errors on the day of my
resurrection.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.83 “O
that my Lady of Light may bestow wisdom upon me and make me one of the
righteous,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.84
“and She may grant that I will be spoken of with honor among my
posterity,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.85
“and She may make me an heir of the garden of delight;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.86
“and perhaps She may forgive my father, for my father was one of those
that went astray.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.87
“and I pray that She will not cause me any dismay, on the day of my
resurrection;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.88
“And on that day in which neither riches nor children shall assist
me,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.89
“and only those that come to Goddess with a sincere heart will be
joyous;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.90
“and this is when paradise will be brought near to the view of the
pious;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.91
“and hell as life on earth shall appear clearly to those that have
erred;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.92
“and it shall be said to the unbelievers,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where are
your deities of wealth, power, greed, war, hate, violence, that you
served, besides Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.93
“Will they now deliver you from punishment of life again on
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or will
they only deliver themselves?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.94
“And when they are cast down back to earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">both
they, and those who have been seduced to their worship;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.95 and
all the host of Eblis they will truly be without a protectress.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.96
“The seduced shall dispute with their false goddesses,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.97
saying, ‘O Goddess, we were in obvious error,’”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.98
“when we held you equivalent to the Lady of all Creatures;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.99
“and no one seduced us but the wicked.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.100
“We now have no friends to help us,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.101
“nor any friend who cares for us.”<span style="mso-tab-count:1">     
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.102
“If only we were allowed to return to earth, knowing what we know
now,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then we
would most certainly become a true believer.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.103
Certainly there were many signs shown to them; but the greater part of
people do not believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.104
The Lady is the Mighty One, the Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.105
The people of Nora accused Goddess’ messengers of lies;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.106
when their sister Nora said to them, “Will you not love Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.107
“Certainly I am a faithful prophetess and a messenger to you;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.108
“Therefore, love Goddess, and listen to me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.109 “I
ask no reward from you for my preaching to you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I expect
my reward from nothing other than the Lady of all Creatures;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.110
“Therefore, love Goddess and listen to me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.111
They answered, “Why should we believe what you have to say,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when only
the most abject persons seem to listen to you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.112
Nora said, “I have no knowledge of what you are saying,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.113
“it is entirely up to the Lady as to whom She leads to a blessed
accounting, if you understand.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.114
“Therefore, I will not drive away any of the true believers.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.115 “I
am no more than a public preacher and teacher.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.116
They replied, “Assuredly, unless you stop this insanity, Nora, you will
surely be stoned.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.117
She said, “O Lady of Light, certainly my people believe that I am only a
liar;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.118
“therefore please instruct everyone properly; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
deliver myself and the true believers who are with me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.119
Therefore, all the prophetesses were warned of a disastrous flood to
come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
told all that would listen and directed them to follow Nora,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but most
would not listen, and an ark was filled with people and animals, in
pairs;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.120
but the rest were drowned because they were stubborn and would not
listen to Nora’s warnings.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.121
Certainly this was a sign, but the majority of the people still did not
believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.122
The Lady of Light is the Almighty One, the Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.123
The tribe of Ada charged the messengers of Goddess with lies;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.124
when their sister Hue said to them, “Will you not love Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.125
“Certainly I am a faithful messenger for you;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.126
“therefore love Goddess and listen to me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.127 “I
do not demand any reward from you for my preaching to you; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I expect
my reward from no one other than the Lady of all Creatures.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.128
“Did you build a landmark on every high place, to amuse
yourself?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.129
“And do you erect magnificent works, hoping that you will possess them
forever?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.130
“And when you exert power, do you exert it with cruelty and
vigor?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.131
“Love Goddess, by foregoing such evil works, and listen to me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.132
“And love Her who has given you wonderful things to know;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.133
“for She has given you cattle and children,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.134
“and gardens and springs of water.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.135
“Certainly, I fear that you will never leave earth, and this is like
punishment to you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.136
They answered, “It is equal to us whether you instruct us, or if you do
not instruct us;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.137
“we believe that what you are preaching are only idle theories from the
ancient ones,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.138
“nor will we ever be punished for what we have done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor do we
need to forego what is expedient for us.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.139
And they accused her of lying; and they were given a chance to
listen,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
did not, and they were all killed in a natural disaster, and only the
believers were saved.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.140
Your Lady of Light is the Almighty One, the Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.141
The tribe of Thelma also charged the messengers of Goddess with
lying.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.142
When their sister Sally said to them, “Will you not love
Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.143
“Certainly, I am a faithful messenger sent to you,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.144
“therefore love Goddess and listen to me.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I demand
no reward from you, for my preaching to you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.145
“Do you believe that you will always possess the things you see
here?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.146
“that you will have gardens and fountains,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.147
“and corn and palm trees, whose branches are laden with flowers?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.148
“and do you believe that you will always have homes cut from the
mountainsides, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even when
you behave quite insolently?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.149
“You should love Goddess and listen to me;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.150
“but do not be guided by the transgressors;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.151
“for they act corruptly on the earth;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.152
“and they will not reform.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.153
They answered, “Certainly you are insane; you are nothing greater than a
woman, just as we are;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.154
“produce some signs or miracles, if you speak the truth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.155
Sally said, “Then this female camel here will be a sign to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on one
day she will drink your water, and on the next you will have the
water;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
must do her no harm, or disaster might befall those of you that will not
believe
me.”<a href="#_ftn44" id="_ftnref44"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.156
But some of the people assembled together and decided to kill the
camel,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
were made to repent of their impiety,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.157
for the disaster that had been forthcoming overtook all the unbelievers
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they would not listen to their prophetess Sally, who preached only a
loving Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
forewarned them of this disaster so they might avoid or mitigate
it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.158
Certainly this was a sign to the people; still the majority of the
people did not believe.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">     </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.159
The Lady of Light is the Almighty One, the Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.160
The people of Wileh likewise accused Goddess’ messengers of
lying.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.161
When their sister Wileh said to them, “Will you not love
Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.162
“Certainly I am a faithful messenger sent to you;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.163
“therefore, Love Goddess, and listen to me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.164 “I
ask no reward from you for my preaching,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I expect
my reward from none other than the Lady of all creatures.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.165
“Do you beat and torture your neighbors who are men that love
men;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.166
“or the women that love women, all of which are people created by
Goddess,</span>

you should care for?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Do you not
know that all committed love is blessed, </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
hate, rage, violence and oppression are all despised by the Lady of
Light?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.167
They answered, “Unless you stop preaching this, O Wileh, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
certainly exile you from this city.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.168
She answered, “Certainly I am one of those that abhor what you are

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.169 O
Lady of Light, deliver myself and my family, from the evil ways that
these people act.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.170
Therefore, we delivered her and her family, so that when a natural
disaster came,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
prophetess warned all the people, but the wicked ones refused to listen
and so they were drowned.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.171
Except an old man also died in the disaster, who was her husband.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">He was
wicked, and perished among the ones who remained behind.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For even
he would not listen to his wife, who was a prophetess and a high
priestess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">He
exhorted others not to listen to Wileh, and he advised them in violence
and oppression of others.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.172
And heavy showers rained down; and this terrible tragedy killed
many,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.173
falling upon those that refused to listen to the warnings of their
prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.174
Certainly, this was a sign from heaven; but the great majority of people
did not believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.175
Your Lady of Light is the Almighty One, the Merciful One.</span>

also accused the prophetess of Goddess of lying.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.177
When Sally said to her, “Will you not love Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.178
“Certainly I am a faithful messenger sent to you;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.179
“therefore love Goddess and listen to me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.181
“Give just measure to your customers, and do not defraud them;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.182
“and always weigh with an equal balance;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.183
“and do not cheat women one iota of their property; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
commit violence in the earth, acting corruptly.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.184
“And love Her who has created you, and also your ancestors.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.185
They answered, “Certainly you are an insane person;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.186
“you are no more than an ordinary woman, as we are; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have determined furthermore that you are nothing but a liar.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.187
“If you want us to believe you, then cause a part of heaven to fall upon
us now,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if you
really speak the truth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.188
Sally said, “My Lady of Light knows best of all that you do.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.189
And the people said that she was a liar. And she told them of an ominous
cloud that was to come;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
first dry heat would scorch the land, then the cloud would form and
drown away everything.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But the
people would not listen to her, so they were scorched first, then
drowned,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and lost
all that they owned, all their crops and livestock.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.190
Certainly this was a sign to the people, but still the vast majority of
them would not believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.191
This Korana is a revelation from the Lady of all Creatures,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.192
which the faithful spirit, Gabrielle, has sent to your heart,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.193 so
that you, O prophetess, might be a preacher to your people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.194 in
the easy to understand English tongue which is easily translatable to
many other languages;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.195
and it bears witness to the Scripture of earlier times.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.196
Had we revealed this Korana to a foreigner,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.197 or
had the prophetess recited it to a foreigner, they would not have
believed;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.198
and they would say, “May we be given respite?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.199
Why would they want any difficulties to be hastened?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.200
Thus obstinate infidelity is its own reward; the people harden their own
hearts,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
when disaster strikes, they will not be saved, for they have not
listened to their own prophetesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which we
have sent them heretofore.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.201
They never seem to believe, even after they have been given a sign, a
warning or a miracle.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.202
These disasters often come suddenly upon them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and by
then their prophetesses have already made the announcement,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
faithful have prepared for it, but the unfaithful have not.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.203
Why would they desire that any disaster should be
hastened?<a href="#_ftn46" id="_ftnref46"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

What are they thinking?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>If they

many good works as they can, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

perhaps they might repent and find a good measure on the day of their
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.205

it first</span>

warn of impending disaster.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.210 No
form of Evil has descended with the Korana, as the infidels are wont to
complain.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.211 It
was sent to them too, as good news, but you should note, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
could never produce such a Book,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
are not in the habit of spreading good news and love about
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.212
For they are very far removed from hearing the conversations of angels
in heaven.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.213 Do
not invoke with the One True Goddess, any negative idol of wealth,
power, greed, or jealousy,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
you become one of those who will be saddened on the day of your
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.214
And speak freely with your family, regarding what you believe,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to spread
the good news of the love of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.215
And behave with meekness towards the believers who follow you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.216
and if they are disobedient in your sight,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you need
only tell them, “I am not responsible for what you do.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.217
And trust in the most mighty, the Merciful Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.218
the one who sees you arise in the morning;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.219
and She is the one who sees the behavior of those that worship;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.220
for She both hears and knows all.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.221
Should I declare to you upon whom Evil will descend?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.222 It
descends with glee upon every lying and wicked person;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.223
and they may learn what is heard;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.224
but most of them are liars.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">26.225
And those who err follow in the steps of many poets; they claim to do
good, but they spread
corruption.<a href="#_ftn47" id="_ftnref47"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:

These are the signs of the Korana, and of this easily understood
Book,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.2 it

believers;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.3

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
firmly believe in heaven and the angels.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.4 As
to those that refuse to believe in the life to come, and have
accordingly not prepared for it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they may
be greatly saddened on the day of their resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.5 for
they will be astonished at their disappointment, when they are raised
again;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they are
those people who create evil in this life; and in the life to come, they
will surely be disappointed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.6 You,
O prophetess, have received the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from the
presence of a wise, knowing and loving Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.7
Remember when Miriam said to her family, “Look!<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>I see fire; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I will
bring you back the meaning of this, or I will bring you back a lighted
torch from it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
might be warmed.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.8 But
when she approached the fire, a voice cried to her saying, “Blessed is
She who is part of the fire,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
blessed is she who is near the fire, and all praises be to Goddess, the
Lady of all Creatures!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.9 “O
Miriam, I am you Goddess, the Almighty, the Wise One;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.10
“Throw down your rod.” And when she did this, the rod was moving and it
looked like it was a serpent, and she was scared, and ran away, and
would not come back near it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
saw this and said, “O Miriam, do not fear Me; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for My
messages are not intended to bring you any fear, you should love Me and
not fear me,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.11
“this is true of even the soul that has erred, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and even
the soul that repents and substitutes good works for evil ones, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for I am
gracious, merciful and most of all, loving.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.12
“Moreover, put your hand into your blouse;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it will
come out glowing white, but it shall not hurt or harm you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
shall be one of nine signs that will be sent to Pharaoh and his
people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Pharaoh has been exceedingly wicked, and he has led his people into
error.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.13 And
when these signs from heaven had come to the Pharaoh and his people,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
said, “This is nothing but black magic.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.14 And
when they denied them, even though these people knew the signs were from
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">out of
evil and pride, they became even more corrupted.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.15
Before this, we have sent you knowledge of Denise and Salome; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
said, “All praise be to Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who has
made us more blessed than even many of her faithful servants!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.16 And
Salome was the heir of Denise and she said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O women,
we have been taught the speech of birds,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have had many wonderful things granted to us;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
magnificent excellence from our Lady.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.17 And
so their women were gathered together, and they consisted of </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
women, the genii or haughty ones and the birds, and they were led by her
in distinct groups;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.18
until they came to the Valley of Ants. And an ant, seeing the groups
approaching, said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O ants,
go back into your burrows, unless Salome and her people tread you under
their feet,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">not
knowing what they are doing.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.19 And
Salome smiled, laughing at the words of the ant,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and said,
“O Lady, make me happy and excited for all the favors you have bestowed
upon me, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and my
parents; and that I might do what is right and pleasing in your
sight;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
introduce me, through your mercy into paradise, together with your
righteous servants.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.20 And
she saw the birds, and she asked, “What is the reason that I do not see
the lapwing?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Why is
she absent?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.21
“Certainly I will scold her for not being here with swiftness and
justice to serve me, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
she has a valid excuse.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.22 And
she tarried not long before the lapwing presented herself to
Salome,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
lapwing said, “I have seen a country which you have not;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

found there a Queen, who has everything necessary to be a strong ruler,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she

the precepts of Goddess; they believe that their deities comes from the

only male, and so there is little love there for others.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.25
“and Evil has prepared works that will corrupt them further,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and has
turned them aside from the way of truth, and they will not be directed
toward the right path,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until
they turn to Goddess, who brings light to all in heaven and upon earth,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
knows what they conceal.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.26
Goddess!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>There is no Goddess but

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.27
Salome said, “I will see whether you have spoken the truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
whether you have told me nothing but lies.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.28
“Please take this letter I have written and deliver it to the Queen of
Saba,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and wait
there to know what the Queen’s answer will be.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.29 And
when the Queen of Saba had received her letter, she said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O wise
women, certainly an honorable letter has been delivered to me;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.30 “It
is from Salome, and this is the meaning of the letter,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">‘In the
name of the most Merciful Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

said, “O wise women, advise me in this business,</span>

not take any action, until your review this and approve what should be

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.33 The
wise women replied, “We are endued with strength, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
are endued with great prowess in warfare, but the command seems to
pertain to you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">advise us
as to what your decision is.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.34 She
said, “Certainly rulers, when they enter a city by force, waste many
resources, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
abase the most powerful of the inhabitants, and they may do this with
us.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.35 “So
I will send gifts to
them,<a href="#_ftn50" id="_ftnref50"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

ask for peace,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will wait for whatever information will be sent back to us.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.36<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And when the Queen’s ambassador came
to Salome,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she said,
“Will you send me back with riches?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Salome
replied, “Certainly what Goddess has given me is better than what
Goddess has given you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
have much glory in many riches.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.37
“Return to the people of Saba.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I know
what they desire, they desire that we will come to them with
troops,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
they will not be able to withstand, and we will drive them out from
their city, humbled;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will become contemptible, and in doing so, we will become
corrupted.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.38 And
Salome said, “O wise women, which of you will send her a throne from me,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a
beautiful throne, to show that we are earnest in making peace.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.39 A
genie appeared and said, “I will bring them news of your peace,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
illustrate that you are not corrupted, nor corruptible,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
desire to live in peace and teach the benefits of your religion, for I
may be trusted.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.40 And
another woman, with knowledge of the Scriptures said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“I will
bring it to the Queen, in the twinkling of an eye.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
Salome saw the throne placed before her, she said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This is
a favor of the Lady, but it is nothing but trial, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to see if
I will be grateful, or whether I will be ungrateful;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
who is grateful is grateful to her own advantage, but if any person is
ungrateful,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">my Lady
of Light is self sufficient and magnificent.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.41 And
Salome said to her servants, “Alter the throne so that she will not
discern it, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to show
whether she is one of those that are rightly directed.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.42 And
when she came to see Salome, it was said to her, “Is your throne like
this?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
answered, “As if it were the same.” And we have had knowledge given to
us before like this,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
are resigned to Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.43 But
the false idols she worshiped of greed and wealth, had turned her aside
from the truth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for she
came from an unbelieving people, that had no love for one
another.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.44 It
was said to her, “Enter the palace.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
she entered therein, she thought there was a great body of water
there,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
lifted up her robe, to pass through
it.”<a href="#_ftn51" id="_ftnref51"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.45 And
Salome told her, “Do not worry, the floor of this palace is covered with
smooth glass.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Then said
the Queen, “O Lady of Light, certainly I have dealt unjustly with my own
soul; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
resign myself, together with Salome,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to the
One True Goddess, the Lady of all Creatures.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.46 And
before this we sent to the tribe of Thelma their sister Sally,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who said
to them, “Serve Goddess.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And
behold, they were divided into two parties,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
disputed among themselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.47
Sally said, “O my people, why do you hasten evil rather than
good?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Unless
you ask for forgiveness of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
you will obtain Her mercy, you are lost and wandering.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.48
They answered, “We foretell evil from you, and from those that are with
you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Sally
replied, “The evil which you foretell is only from Evil;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
are a people who are proved by the variation between prosperity and
adversity.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.49 And
there were nine women in the city, who had acted corruptly in the
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
did not behave with integrity.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.50 And
they said to one another, “Swear to Goddess, that we will attack Sally
and her family by night;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
afterwards we will tell her how we had the right to avenge spilled
blood,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we were
not present at the destruction of her family; and we certainly speak the
truth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.51 And
they devised a plot against Sally, but heaven devised a counter plot,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
did not know this at the time. And see what was the result of their
plot,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
could not avoid a rock avalanche, they were cut off from their
prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But they
were warned first, but refused to believe a prophetess that had a loving
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.52 And
today their homes remain empty, because they were destroyed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
this is a sign for people who understand.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.53 And
we delivered those who believed, and loved Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.54 And
remember Wileh, when she said to her people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Do you
commit wickedness and persecute and oppress people in your town,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
you see how terrible this is?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.55 “Do
you beat and torture those men that love men,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and women
that love women, those that are different from you?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You are
most assuredly ignorant in doing this wickedness.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.56 But
the answer of her people was none other than,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Throw
out the family of Wileh and her miserable husband
Lot<a href="#_ftn52" id="_ftnref52"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

our city,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
are people that would prevent us from doing what we want;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">torturing
and abusing those we do not like and do not understand.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>We are not patient nor
tolerant.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.57
Wherefore, when a natural disaster came, we told Wileh,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and all
her family was saved, except for her husband, who was an old man,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and he
would not believe his wife, who was a prophetess and a high priestess,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so he
remained behind and was destroyed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.58 And
a shower of brimstone rained down on this land,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that did not listen to their prophetess Wileh were all destroyed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.59
Say, “Praise be to Goddess, and peace be upon Her servants,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whom She
has carefully chosen!”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Is Goddess
more worthy,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or the
false negative idols of wealth, greed, jealousy and self centeredness
that </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they have
associated with Her?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.60 Is
She not to be preferred, the one who has created the heavens and the
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
sends down rain for you from heaven, whereby the delicious groves spring
up?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Is it not
in your power to cause the trees to grow up?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Is there
any negative emotion that you should partner with the One True
Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
the people of Wileh deviated far from the truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.61 Is
it not more worthy to adore Goddess who has made the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and has
caused rivers to flow through it, and has placed upon it immovable
mountains, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and has
set large tracts of land between two great seas? Is there any entity
equal with Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet the
vast majority of the people do not know this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.62 Is
She not more worthy who hears the afflicted, when they call upon
Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
sweeps away evil which distresses a person,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has made you the successors of your ancestors in the earth?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Is there
any other entity who can be equaled with the One True Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It is
amazing how few people consider these things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.63 Is
She not more worthy who directs you to walk in the dark paths of land
and sail the sea in safety;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
sends the winds which drive the clouds about, to portend Her great mercy
to womankind?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Is there
any other entity who may be equaled with the One True Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Far be it
from Goddess from having negative actions and emotions associated with
Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.64 Is
She not the Most Worthy, that She is able to produce a creature,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and even
after it has been dead, and then restore it to life?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And She
gives you food from heaven, bestowed upon the earth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Is there
anything you can associate with Goddess that can do all this?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
the people, “Produce your proof, if you speak the truth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.65 Say
to the people, “No one in heaven or upon the earth knows all that is
obscure, besides Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor do
many understand that upon death they will be raised to an
afterlife.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.66
However, their knowledge attains some notice of the life to come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet most
have a great amount of uncertainty concerning the same;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yes, they
are blind to many truths concerning the afterlife.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.67 And
the unbelievers say, “When we and our ancestors have been reduced to
dust, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall we
be taken out of our graves?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.68
“Certainly we have been threatened with this, both us and our mothers
before us.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
none other than a fable of the ancients.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.69 Say
to the people, “Pass through the earth, and see what has happened
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to the
wicked people that have not listened to their prophetess before a
disaster.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Furthermore,
if Goddess created you once, She most certainly may raise you to life
again.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.70 And
do not be grieved for those people that do not listen;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
should you be concerned with any of the dark schemes that they are
contriving against you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.71 And
some people say, “When will your prediction of final resurrection
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
destruction of the heavens and earth be accomplished, if you speak the
truth?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.72
Answer them, “You should consider that your day of resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which you
seem to desire to be hastened, may follow soon after today;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.73
“Certainly your Lady of Light is endued with indulgence towards
womankind; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
vast majority of people are not thankful.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.74
“Certainly the Lady of Light knows what the hearts of women
conceal,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and what
they declare openly and publicly.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.75 And
there is nothing hidden in heaven or upon the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but it is
written in an easily understood Book.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.76
Certainly this Korana declares to the Children of Israel and to all
others,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">most of
those points which they currently disagree upon;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.77 and
it is certainly a direction, and a mercy unto the true believer.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.78
Your Lady of Light will decide all controversies between religions by a
definitive decree;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
is the Almighty One, the Wise One; but remember, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is
still more important to be kind to one another than to criticize the
beliefs of another religion; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there are
many paths to Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.79
Therefore, put your trust in Goddess; for you will find in Her the
obvious truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.80
Certainly you will never make the dead to hear;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor shall
you make the deaf to hear your call to the one true faith,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
walk away from you and turn their backs;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.81 nor
will you direct the blind to extricate themselves from their
error.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You will
not be able to make any person hear you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
the person who desires to believe in our signs; and they will be wholly
resigned to the truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.82
When the day of the final resurrection is near, an
animal<a href="#_ftn53" id="_ftnref53"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

appear upon the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
will speak to the people, yet many people do not believe in our signs
and miracles.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.83 On
the day of the final resurrection, we will assemble together,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">out of
every nation, a company of unbelieving souls, until they shall arrive at
a final place.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Goddess will say to them, “Did you charge my signs as lies, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though you did not understand them?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">What were
you thinking? You were given the opportunity to change evil to
good,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
great and wonderful things on this earth, yet you did not.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">There was
much good to learn there. These persons will be prevented from mixing
with the believers.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.84 Yet
She will then cleanse the unbelievers with Her pure bright light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will no longer act unjustly; and they will have no final excuse, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet they
will be assuredly deeply saddened, when they have reviewed all their
lifetimes,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
see all the good and kind things they might have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.85 And
She will cleanse them with pure light, which will not burn, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though they have acted unjustly, and even though they have no
excuse.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.86 Do
they not see that we have ordained the night as a time of rest, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have given the day bright light?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
we have shown many signs and miracles to people of understanding that
believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.87 On
a certain day the trumpet will sound, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
people on the earth will come together in love, peace and
harmony,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">before
their Goddess with great gratitude.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Even the
unbelievers will come before Her in humble supplication,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be so very much amazed at what they will see.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.88 And
you will see the mountains, and will think that they are firm
structures, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
shall pass away, even as the clouds pass away. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This will
be the work of Goddess, who rightly determines all things;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
is well acquainted with all that you do.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.89
Whomever will have brought righteousness into the world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall
receive a reward well beyond what they did; and they shall reign happy
and secure on that day;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.90 but
whomever was an unbeliever,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will be
greatly saddened when they see all the good that they might have
done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Will any
soul receive a reward, other than what it is owed?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.91
Certainly I am commanded to worship the Lady of this territory of the
world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whom She
has sanctified, and to Her belongs everything.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And I am commanded to be a
Moslema;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.92 and
to recite the Korana;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>she who is
directed with this Book will be directed to her own advantage;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to those
that go astray say, “Certainly I am a preacher only.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.93 And
say, “Praise be to Goddess!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>She
will show you Her signs and miracles,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will know them; and your Lady is not inattentive of what Her people
do.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In the
name of the most Merciful Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.1
T.S.M.<a href="#_ftn54" id="_ftnref54"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.2
These are the signs of this easily understood Book.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.3 We
will advise you, O prophetess, of some of the parts of herstory</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of Miriam
and Pharaoh with truth, for the sake of the people who will
believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.4 Now
Pharaoh exalted himself in the land of Egypt;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and he
caused his subjects to be divided into parties;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">he
weakened one party of them, by slaying the female children, and
preserving the males alive, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so their
numbers would be greatly reduced, and their culture suppressed, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
males would have no wives, other than a few Egyptian women that would
have them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for he
was an oppressor.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.5 And
heaven was of the mind set to be gracious to those who were weakened in
the land,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
make them models of religion; and to make them heirs of the wealth of
Pharaoh and his
people,<a href="#_ftn55" id="_ftnref55"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

by their forces,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
destruction of their kingdom and their nation, which they sought to
avoid.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.7 And
we directed the mother of Miriam, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by
revelation, saying, “Nurse her, and when you fear for her life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
place her into the river in a small vessel,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and fear
not, neither be saddened, for we will keep her safe for you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will appoint her as one of our prophetesses and apostles.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.8 And
when she had put the child in the small vessel,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and had
set it out into the river, the family of Pharaoh took her up,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and at
this time, it was predetermined that she would become an enemy to those
that raised her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and a
sorrow unto them. Assuredly Pharaoh and Haman were evil doers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.9 And
the wife of Pharaoh said, “This child is delightful to my eye, and to
you, please do not kill her; perhaps we might use her one day, or we may
adopt her for our daughter.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And they
did not know the consequences of what they had done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.10 And
the heart of the mother of Miriam was still oppressed with fear;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
had almost failed to put Miriam in the small ark, had we not armed her
heart with courage,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
she might be one of those who believed in the promises of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.11 And
she said to her other daughter, Alana, “Follow her.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And she
watched her at a distance; but no one knew this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.12 And
we arranged it so that the baby would not take the breasts of her wet
nurses, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so before
long Alana went to Pharaoh’s wife. The sister asked the wife of Pharaoh,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Should I
find you a wet nurse for her, perhaps she will nurse from a woman from
my family, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
will take good care of her?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Pharaoh’s wife allowed it, and so Miriam nursed from her own
mother.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.13 And
accordingly, Miriam was restored to her own mother, so that her mind was
set at ease,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so
she would not be sick with grief;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so
she might know that the promises of Goddess were good and true;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
great majority of the people do not know this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.14 And
when Miriam had become an adult and</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">attained
her full age of strength and was a perfect woman,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we
bestowed on her wisdom and knowledge; and this is how we reward the
righteous.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.15 And
she went to the city at a time when people were out in the
street,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
found therein two women fighting; one was an acquaintance of hers,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
other was not and appeared to be an enemy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And the
woman who was an acquaintance of Miriam’s begged her assistance against
the unknown person,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Miriam struck the stranger with a heavy object, and the stranger
died;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but then
Miriam was immediately sorry for what she had done, and she said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly
this is an evil work, what have I done?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.16
After which she said, “O Lady of light, most certainly I have injured my
own soul; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I implore
your forgiveness.” So Goddess forgave her; for She is ready to forgive
and She is merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.17 She
said, “O Lady of Light, by the favors that you have given me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I will
never again be an assistant to the wicked.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.18 And
the next morning she was afraid in the city,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
looked all around her, as one that is apprehensive of danger;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
behold, she saw the same acquaintance again,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but now
she was crying out for help a second time in a fight against another
stranger.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But this
time Miriam said to her, “You are assuredly a quarrelsome person,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
should seek peace with those around you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.19 And
when she sought to seize the woman who was an enemy to them both,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she said,
“O Miriam, do you intend to kill me, as you killed another woman
yesterday?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It seems
all you desire to be is a tyrant, and you do not want to be a
peacemaker.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.20 And
a certain woman came from the farthest part of the city,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">running
swiftly and said, “O Miriam, the magistrates are deliberating right
now</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as to
whether you should be put to death; you must leave immediately,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I will
let you know what they decide.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.21
Wherefore, she fled the city in great fear, looking all about her,
unless she was pursued.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And she
said, “O Lady of Light, deliver me from the unjust people.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.22 And
when she was traveling towards the town of Marian,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she said,
perhaps my Lady of Light will now direct me in the right way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.23 And
when she arrived at the waters of Marian,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she found
near a well a company of men that were watering their flocks.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And she
also found, besides them, two women, who waited at a distance to water
their own sheep. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Miriam said to them, “What is the matter with you?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
answered, “We are not allowed to water our flock until the men have gone
away,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
will not let us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Our mother is an
old frail woman that can no longer assist us with this.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.24 So
Miriam asked the men to move, reminded them they should take their turn
and share the water, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
did, and Miriam watered the sheep for them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
afterwards she rested in the shade, saying “O Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I stand
in need of some good assistance at this moment, please send it down to
me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.25 And
one of the young ladies came back to her, walking swiftly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
said, “My mother called to me that she may compensate you</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
trouble which you have taken in watering our sheep for us.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
she came to Sally, and had told her of the story of her
adventures,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she said
to Miriam, “Fear not; you have escaped from some very unjust
people.”<a href="#_ftn57" id="_ftnref57"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.26 One
of the young ladies said, “My mother will hire you for wages;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
the best servant that one can have is a fit and trustworthy
person.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.27<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And Sally said to Miriam, “Certainly I
will give you one of my handsome two sons in marriage, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on
condition that you will serve me for eight years, and if you fulfil ten
years, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it would
be from the kindness of your heart; for I do not desire to impose any
hardship on you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will find me, Goddess willing, a woman of my word.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.28
Miriam answered, “Let this be the agreement between me and you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">either of
the two terms I might work for you, it will not be wrongful for me to
quit your service; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess will be witness of that which we have said.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.29 And
when Miriam had fulfilled the term, and was journeying with her family
towards Egypt,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she saw
fire on the side of Mount Sinai. And she said to her family, “Wait here
awhile;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for I see
fire and perhaps I may bring you tidings of good direction from
it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or at
least a torch from the fire, that you will be warmed.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.30 And
when she came to the fire, a female voice cried to her from the right
side of the valley,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in the
sacred bottom, from a tree, saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O Miriam
certainly I am your Goddess, the Lady of all Creatures;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.31
“Now throw down your staff.” And when she threw it down, she saw that it
moved,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
appeared to be a serpent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>She ran
from it, and would not come back near to it, she was so afraid.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Goddess said to her, “O Miriam, you may come near it without any fear;
for you are safe with Me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.32
“Put your hand in your blouse, and it will come out glowing white,
without any hurt; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
draw it back, even though you are afraid to do so.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These are
two evident signs from your Lady of Light for Pharaoh and his
princes,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
are a wicked people.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.33
Miriam said, “O Lady of light, I have in the past slain an
Egyptian,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
fear they will arrest me and put me to death;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.34
“but my sister Alana is more eloquent than I am in these matters;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
send her with me as my assistant; so that I may attain credit;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for I am
afraid that they might accuse me of being a liar.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.35
Goddess replied, “I will strengthen your courage by your sister,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will give each of you extraordinary power, so that they will not attack
you, as part of our signs.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The two
of you, and whomsoever follows you, shall be the victors.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.36 And
when Miriam came to them with evident signs and miracles</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
said, “This is none other than a despicable work of sorcery;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we have
never heard of anything like it spoken of by our foremothers.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.37 And
Miriam said, “My Lady of Light bests knows who comes with instructions
from Her; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
shall have success in this life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as well
as in the next; but the unjust shall not prosper.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.38 And
Pharaoh said, “O my princes, I did not know that there were any other
divine entities </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">besides
myself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Wherefore, Haman, make me
bricks and build a tall tower, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that I
may ascend to the Goddess of Miriam; for I believe that she is a
liar.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.39 And
both he and his troops behaved themselves insolently and unjustly on the
earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
imagined that they would never suffer harm.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.40 So
we tested him by having Miriam say he should not follow her away,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Pharaoh and his forces did, and they were accordingly drowned.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.41 And
they were deceitful guides of their people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
invited their followers to also be saddened on the day of their
resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
lives that they reviewed on this day surely grieved them greatly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.42
Without a protectress like Goddess, their lives appear to be cursed to
them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and on
the day of their resurrection they will be saddened for all of the good
that they might have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.43 And
we gave the Book of the law to Miriam, after many generations had
passed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
enlighten the minds of the people, and for a direction, and mercy to
them; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
perhaps they might consider.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.44
You, O prophetess, were not on the west side of Mt. Sinai when we
delivered Miriam </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">her
commission; nor were you one of those who were present when she received
it;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.45 but
we raised up several generations after Miriam; and they lived long
lives.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Nor did
you dwell among the inhabitants of Marian, informing them of our signs
and miracles;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but we
have sent you good instructions in many matters.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.46 Nor
were you present on the side of the mountain when we called to
Miriam;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
are sent as a mercy from the Lady of Light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
might preach to a people where no preacher had come before,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
perhaps they might listen and consider.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.47 And
unless a calamity had come to them, and they could not avoid it by their
own hand,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
should have said, “O Lady of Light, since you have not sent a prophetess
to us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that we
might listen to her and become true believers and avoid disasters,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">are we
exempt from the day of our resurrection?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.48 Yet
when the truth has come to light from us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they say,
“Unless she receives the same power to work miracles as Miriam received,
we will not believe.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do they
not understand why Miriam received these powers?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They say
“Two cunning liars have mutually assisted one another;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
say, “We most certainly reject them both.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.49 Say
to the people, “Produce therefore a Book from Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
more right than these two, that I might understand, if you speak the
truth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.50 But
if they return to you without an answer, know that they only follow
their own desires,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
proper direction from Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.51 And
now we have caused our Word to come to them, that they may be instructed
properly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.52 The
people to whom have been given the Scriptures, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
have been heretofore revealed, believed in them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.53 And
when it was read to them, they said, “We believe in this; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is
certainly the truth from our Lady of Light, certainly we were Moslemas
before this.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.54
These people shall receive their reward many times over,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they have persevered, and they repelled evil with good works,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
distributed alms out of which we have bestowed upon them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.55 and
when they hear idle chatter, they avoid the same,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying,
“We have our own works and you have what you will do. Peace be with
you.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And they
do not desire the acquaintance of the ignorant.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.56
Certainly you cannot direct whomever you wish; yet Goddess will gently
guide those that seek Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.57
Some people say, “If we follow the same direction as you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then we
might be forcibly expelled from our land.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Did we
not establish a secure land for
them,<a href="#_ftn58" id="_ftnref58"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

which fruits of every sort are brought,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as a
provision from our bounty. But the great majority of womankind do not
understand this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.58
There have been plenty of cities destroyed by natural disasters,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whose
inhabitants lived in ease and plenty, but thought they received no
warning,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for to
receive a warning they had to turn to a prophetess who preached that
Goddess was all love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And they
did not want to hear this; they did not want to give up their hate,
rage, jealousy and greed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And after
the disaster, their homes were not inhabited, unless for a little
while,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
others were the inheritors of their wealth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.59 But
your Lady of Light did not allow those cities to be destroyed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until She
had first sent to their capitals a prophetess, to instruct them of our
signs;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor did
any natural disaster come, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
the inhabitants who had acted wrongfully were first warned by a
prophetess we had sent them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.60 The
things which are given to you are the provisions of the present
life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and all
of its vain grandeur; but that which comes from Goddess is far
better,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and more
durable; will you not understand this?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.61
Will it be then to whom we have promised an excellent promise of future
happiness, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
it has been attained,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will this
be the same as the person whom has been granted every advantage in the
present life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who,
on the day of her resurrection, shall be one of those subject to
immediate rebirth</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
they will once again wander lost and confused upon the earth?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.62 On
the day of their resurrection, Goddess will call to them, and She will
ask, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Where
are your idols of wealth, greed and self centeredness, that which you
relied upon?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.63<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">   </span>And they upon whom the sentence of
immediate rebirth has been passed shall answer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“These, O
Lady of Light are those whom we seduced; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we
seduced them as we also had been seduced by them, but now we forsake
them, and we turn to You.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They did
not worship us, but only what was expedient.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.64 And
it shall be said to those that worshiped such false entities,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Call now
upon the false negative idols of wealth, greed and self
centeredness,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will call upon them, but they will not answer them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
they shall be greatly saddened at all the good that they might have
provided to others, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if they
had only believed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.65 On
that day, Goddess shall call to them and say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“What
answer did you send to our messengers, when they came to you?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.66 But
they shall not be able to give any account on this day;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
they be able to ask one another for information.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.67 But
those who shall repent and believe, and those that do what is right,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they can
expect to be happy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.68 For
your Lady of Light creates what She pleases,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
chooses freely; but they have no free choice to get what they desire.
Praise be to Goddess; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.69 and
the Lady knows both the secret malice </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
their hearts contain, and the open hatred that spews forth from
them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.70 She
is Goddess; there is no Goddess but She;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to Her is
all praise due; both in this life and in that which is yet to
come;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to Her
only does judgment belong; and before Her you shall be assembled on the
day of your resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.71 Say
to the people, “What were you thinking? If Goddess should cover you with
perpetual night, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until the
day of your resurrection; what goddess, besides Goddess, will bring you
light?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Will your
goddesses of wealth, greed, self centeredness and power bring you light?
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Will you
not listen, therefore?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.72 Say
to the people, “What were you thinking? If Goddess should give you
continual day, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until the
day of resurrection; what goddess besides Goddess, would bring you
night, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
could rest for a period between the day? Will you not consider these
issues?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.73
From Her mercy, She has made for you the night and the day, that you may
rest during the one,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
may seek to obtain provisions for yourselves during the other,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
from Her abundance, and by your industry; so therefore you should give
Her thanks.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.74 On
a certain day Goddess will call to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
shall say to them, “Where are the idols of wealth, power and
greed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
that you imagined to share the divine power with me?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.75 And
we will produce a witness out of every nation,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will say, “Bring here your proof of what you have asserted.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And they
will know that the right way is Goddess’ alone;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
false deities of wealth, power, greed and self centeredness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
they only devised and imagined are not truly there.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.76
Karen was one of the people of Marian, but she behaved insolently
towards her people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for we
had given her so much treasure, that it would have loaded down many
strong people.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">When her
people said to her, “Do not arrogantly rejoice in your wealth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess does not care for those who arrogantly rejoice in their
wealth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">especially
when it incites others to envy, jealousy and greed;”</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.77
“But seek to attain, by means of the wealth which Goddess has given
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

do not forget your portion in this world;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but be
generous to others, as Goddess has been bounteous to you; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not seek to act corruptly in the earth; for Goddess does not love the
corrupt.”</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.78<span

riches, only because of the knowledge which is with me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Did she
not know that Goddess had already sent disasters before her?<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And this
was for several generations, who were mightier than she in strength,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
had amassed more abundance of riches? And the wicked shall not be asked
to recite their crimes.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.79 And
Karen went out to the people, with her ostentatious displays of
wealth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And they
who loved this present life said, “O we wish that we had such great
wealth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as that
which had been given to Karen. Certainly she is the lucky mistress of a
great fortune.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.80 But
those upon whom knowledge has been bestowed answered,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Alas for
you! The reward of Goddess in the next life </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will be
far better to her who will have believed and has done good works;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but no
one will attain the same, except those who persevere with
loyalty.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.81 And
there was an earthquake, and the ground cleaved in sunder,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and some
people who did not listen to their prophetess were swallowed up
therein;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and Karen
was one of those; and her palace was destroyed;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
had no forces to defend her besides Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

she rescued from seeing sadness on the day of her resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.82 And
in the next morning, those who had coveted her wealth the day before
said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Aha!
Goddess may give abundant wealth on such servants as She pleases,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

is sparing to others. Unless Goddess has been gracious to us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the earth
would have swallowed us up also. Aha! The unbelievers never prosper in
the end.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.83 As
to the future mansions in paradise, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

give them to those who do not seek ostentatious wealth on the earth and
taunt others with it; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and not
to those that do wrong; for only happy works attend the pious.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.84
Whomsoever does good shall receive a reward which shall exceed the
merit, several times over; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but as to
those that do evil, they shall see only sadness on the day of their
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.85
Certainly she who has been given the Korana for a rule of faith;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
practices what is taught therein, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will
certainly bring it back home to those that are near and dear to
you.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Say to them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“My Lady
best knows who comes with a true direction, and who is in obvious
error.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.86 You
did not expect that the Book of the Korana will be given to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
have now received it through the mercy of your Lady of Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do not
assist the unbelievers in being unfaithful;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.87 Nor
should you turn them away from the signs of the Lady of Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">28.88 And
do not idolize wealth, greed, power and self centeredness;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
should you associate any negative emotion with Goddess, such as hate,
jealousy, envy or vengeance;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is pure love, compassion, understanding, mercy and hope.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Everything
on earth will eventually perish, except Her; to Her only belongs all
judgment;</span>

women imagine that it will be sufficient for them to say,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“We
believe” only, do they not think that they will be tested in their
faith?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.3 We
have before this proved many who came before them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess will know people who are sincere; and She will know who the
liars are.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.4 Do
these people who work evil think that they will escape seeing what they
have done </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of their resurrection?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.5
Whomever hopes to meet Goddess, certainly Goddess’ appointed time will
come; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
knows and hears all.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.6
Whomever strives to promote the one true loving and kind religion</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">also
strives for the advantage of her own soul; for Goddess does not need any
of Her creatures;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.7 and
as to those who believe and work righteousness, their errors will be
forgiven; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will be given a reward in heaven according to the utmost merit of their
good works.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.8 We
have commanded woman to show kindness towards her parents;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but if
they endeavor you to turn away from righteousness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
avoid doing good works, then you need not obey them in this
regard,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">only be
kind and solicitous to them, to the extent you are able to with patience
and forbearance.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.9
Those who shall believe and will work righteousness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
certainly introduce you into paradise, along with the righteous.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.10
There are some who say, “We believe in Goddess;” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but when
they are afflicted in person or property, they believe that the
persecution of other people </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">is the
same as if Goddess were punishing them. Yet if success comes their way,
they say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Most
certainly, we are with You.” Does Goddess not know what is in the heart
of Her creatures?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.11
Certainly Goddess well knows the true believers, and She knows the
hypocrites.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.12 The
unbelievers say to those that do believe, “Follow our way, and we will
bear your sins.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But there
is no way for them to bear the sins of anyone else; for they are
liars.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.13<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will be very saddened to see all of this on the day of their
resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">concerning
all they have falsely imagined.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.14
Before this, we sent you Nora to her people, and she was with them one
thousand years, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">less
fifty years; and then the flood took them away, because they would not
listen to their prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.15 But
we delivered her and her family that believed; and those that were in
the ark;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
was a sign to all people.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.16 We
also sent Sarah, a high priestess; when she said to her people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Serve
Goddess, and do not serve false idols of wealth, greed, power and self
centeredness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this will
be better for you, if you can understand.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.17 But
they worshiped such false idols besides Goddess, and they openly
declared lies concerning Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
those negative entities you worship, besides Goddess, are not able to
make any provision for you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
seek your provision from Goddess; and serve only Her, and give thanks
and praise to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">27.18 If
you charge me with lying, certainly various nations before you</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">have also
charged their prophetesses with lying; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
public preaching and teaching is the only required work of a
prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.19 Do
the people not see how Goddess produces creatures, and after they have
died, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they are
automatically replenished? Certainly this is all simple with
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.20 Say
to the people, “Look at the earth, and see how She originally produced
creatures; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">after
which, when these creatures are gone, there are more to come, for
Goddess is the Almighty One.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.21 She
will give trials to whom She desires, and She will provide mercy upon
those that request it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is the Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.22
Before Her you will be brought together on the day of your
resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will find Her full of love, both on earth and in heaven;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you truly
have no other patroness or defender besides Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.23 As
for those people who did not believe in the signs of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or that
they will meet Her on the day of their resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be greatly saddened on the day of their resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for all
the good news that they might have spread to others,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">others
that live in toil and trouble and difficulties, for the world is
plentiful with these.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.24 And
the answer of the people of Nora was none other than,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Slay her
or burn her.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>But Goddess saved
her from the fire.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly,
these are signs for people who desire to believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.25 And
Sarah, the high priestess, said to her people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“You have
idolized wealth, greed, power and self centeredness, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to cement
affection towards materialistic things; but on the day of your
resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the one
of you will not know the other, and the other will not be able to
contact you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and your
rebirth on the earth without guardian angels shall be like hell fire,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
will be no avoiding this.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.26 And
Wileh believed in the religion of Sarah and Nora;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And Sarah
said, “Certainly I fly from my people, to the place where the Lady of
Light has sent me;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is the Almighty One, the Wise one.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.27 And
we gave her Iris and Jacklyn; and we placed among her descendants the
gifts of prophecy</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
Scriptures, and we gave her a reward in this world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and in
the next world she shall be one of the righteous.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.28 We
also sent Wileh, and she said to her people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Do you
commit evil in the world by oppressing and torturing people, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which you
were commanded not to do?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.29 “Do
you beat and torture and maim those men that love men,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and women
that love women, when all they have done is created love, is love not
from Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And the
answer of the people was, “Then bring down the vengeance of
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if what
we have done is wrongful, and if you speak the truth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.30
Wileh prayed to her Lady of Light, “O Lady, defend me against the
corrupt people.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
our messages came to Sarah with good tidings,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.31<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>they said, “Most of the inhabitants of
this city will suffer disaster,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
are unbelievers and they will not listen when you warn them of the
upcoming disaster.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.32
Sarah answered, “Certainly Wileh lives there and many of her family are
faithful true believers, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the light
entities.” They replied, “We very well know who lives there,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
surely deliver her and her family, except her husband, for his corrupt
ways and his unbelief,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">he will
not believe even his own wife when she warns him and preaches to him
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that hate
and violence against others is exceedingly wicked.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.33 And
when our messengers came to Wileh, she was troubled for the
unbelievers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
was greatly grieved. But they said, “Fear not, nor be grieved,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for we
will deliver you and your family, except your husband, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for he
has been a great source of trouble for you, and he will remain behind
for he is influenced by evil.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.34
“The necessary changes in the earth have been put in place,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
inhabitants of the city will surely be destroyed, for they are engaged
in primarily wicked deeds,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
do not listen to their prophetess;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.35
“This is despite the fact that we have given obvious signs, knowledge of
fire, earthquakes and floods,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and yet
the people do not pay attention, they do not understand.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.36 And
to the inhabitants of Marian, we sent them a prophetess, their sister
Shobi,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
said to them, “O my people, serve Goddess, and expect your day of
resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not commit error or engage in corruption.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.37 But
they accused her of lying; and they would not listen to her predictions
of disaster,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and a
storm came from heaven, and it assailed them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.38 And
we looked on when there were also natural disasters that came to the
tribe of Ada and Thelma,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
is well known to you what happened, when you see their empty
dwellings.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And Evil
prepared their works for them, and they were turned away from the
truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
they were a people endowed with great knowledge.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.39 And
we looked on when natural disasters came to Karen, Pharaoh and
Haman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Miriam
came to them with obvious signs from heaven, and they behave insolently;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
would not listen, and so they were destroyed when they followed Miriam;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the sea
would split for her, but not for them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.40
Every person that is a dark entity will not listen to the prophetesses
we send them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
are at risk of destruction at any time. And some of them encountered a
violent wind;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">some of
them encountered violent storms; and some of them encountered
earthquakes, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
swallowed them up; and some were drowned.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
Goddess did not treat them unjustly; these were all natural disasters
brought about by</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">necessary
changes in a living earth; but the unbelievers deal unjustly with their
own souls,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
do not listen to the prophetesses sent to them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.41 The
likeness of those who take other patrons of hate, jealousy, evil and
envy besides Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">is as the
likeness of the spider, which makes a dwelling out of webbing,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but its
dwelling is quite weak when large creatures walk nearby, if only people
could understand this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.42
Moreover, Goddess knows what things are relied upon by people;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
is the Almighty One, the Wise One. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.43
These parables we send to women; but none will understand them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
the wise ones who seek Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.44
Goddess has created the heavens and earth in truth; certainly this is a
sign to the true believers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.45
Recite that which has been revealed to you as the Book of the Korana;
and persevere at prayer;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
prayer preserves a woman from crime; and from that which is
blameworthy;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
remembering of Goddess is certainly a most important duty. Goddess knows
all of which you do.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.46 Do
not dispute issues with those who have received the Scriptures,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except in
a mild and respectful manner;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not commit violence, except in self defense and only against those that
are threatening </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yourself
or your property with imminent injury; self defense is always allowed,
aggression is not;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and say,
“We believe in the divine revelation which has been sent down to
us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and in
giving alms from that which has been sent down to us; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">our
Goddess and your Goddess is one, and unto Her we are resigned.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.47
Thus we have sent down the Book of the Korana to you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
people who have been given former Scriptures believe in this;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and of
course the good people also believe in this Book; and none should reject
our signs,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.48 And
you were not able to preach Scripture such as this Korana until it came
to you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor were
you able to transcribe it with your right
hand;<a href="#_ftn62" id="_ftnref62"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
the liars justly doubted of the divine origin of it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.49 But
the same result is evident signs in the hearts of those </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who have
received understanding; for none reject our signs except the
unjust.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.50
They say, “Unless a sign is sent down to her from her Lady of
Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
not believe.” Answer them, “Signs are in the power of Goddess
alone;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I am
no more than a public preacher and teacher.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.51 Is
it not sufficient for those people to whom we have sent down the
Korana</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to be
read to them? Certainly this is a great mercy, and a message of love to
the people who believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.52
Say, “Goddess is a sufficient witness between you and I</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She knows
whatever is in heaven and on earth; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
who believe in vain idols of wealth, power, greed and corruption, and
deny Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
have great sadness on the day of their resurrection.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.53
They will urge you to hasten their judgment day, as a proof of your
position, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
is not your place; if there had not been a determined time for their
delay of resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it would
have come before this; but it will surely overtake them suddenly, and
they will not predict it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.54
They will urge you to bring down vengeance swiftly upon them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
is not the way of Goddess; you shall not associate any such negative
human emotions with Her.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">   </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.55 On
a certain day they will experience their day of resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
will suddenly come upon them, both from above them, and from under their
feet, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess shall say, “See the love that I provide for you today and
always.”</span>

class=Section3&gt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.56 O
my servants who have faithfully believed, certainly My earth is
spacious, therefore serve only Me.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.57
Every soul shall taste death; afterwards you will all return to
heaven;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.58 and
as for those who shall have believed and done righteousness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be housed in the higher apartments and mansions of paradise; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">rivers
will flow beneath them, and they will continue therein forever.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.59
Whosoever perseveres with patience and puts their trust in the Lady of
Light will have all of this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.60 How
many creatures are there upon the earth, which are provided with food
and water, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">all by
the bounty of the Lady. It is certainly Goddess who provides for them,
and for you all;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
both hears and knows everything.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.61
Certainly, if you ask some of the people, “Who created the heavens and
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
makes the sun and the moon fly about in their orbits,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
answer, “Goddess, of course.” How therefore do they lie, in
acknowledging their worship</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of
wealth, power, greed and self centeredness?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.62
Goddess makes an abundant provision for each of Her servants, as She
chooses; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
is sparing to her, if She pleases; for Goddess knows all things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.63<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Certainly, if you ask a person, “Who
sends the rain down from heaven,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
can resurrect the earth after a drought, after it has appeared dead?”
They will say, “Goddess.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
them, “Goddess be praised!” But the vast majority of the people do not
understand.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.64
This present life is none other than a school, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and an
instruction to you that you might grow and perfect, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
future mansion of paradise is more blessed indeed;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if all
the people knew this, they would not prefer the former to the
latter.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.65
When they sail on a ship, they call upon Goddess, sincerely exhorting
others to Her true religion;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but when
She brings them safe to land, behold they return to worshiping wealth,
greed and power, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">their
other beloved false and negative idols.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.66
They show themselves ungrateful for all that heaven has bestowed upon
them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
desire only to enjoy the delights of this life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but later
they will have complete understanding of the situation.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.67 Do
they not see that we have made the territory of Mecca an inviolable and
secure asylum </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where
women are spoiled in comparison to the countries around them? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do they
therefore believe in things which are in vain, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
do not acknowledge the goodness of Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">29.68 But
who is more unjust than a person that devises lies regarding Goddess,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or who
denies the truth, when it has come to her?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do they
not realize that the day of their resurrection will be very sad for the
unbelievers?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.2 The
Greeks have been overcome by the Persians preaching their
gospels;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.3 in
the nearest part of the land, but after that defeat, they shall overcome
others in their turn,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.4
within three to nine years. To Goddess belongs the disposition of this
matter,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">both for
what is past, and for what is to come;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and on
that day shall the believers rejoice in the success granted by
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.5 for
She grants success to whom She pleases, and She is the Almighty One, the
Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.6 This
is the promise of Goddess; Goddess will not act contrary to Her
promise;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
greater part of women are not acquainted with the veracity of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.7 They
know the outward appearance of the present life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
are careless regarding the life which is to come.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.8 Do
they not consider themselves that Goddess has not created the heavens
and the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whatever is between them, otherwise than in truth and love,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and will
make them exist for a predetermined period?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet the
vast majority of the people reject the notion </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
will meet their Lady of Light upon the day of their resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.9 Do
they not travel the earth and see what has been</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
natural destruction of those that have gone before them?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
excelled in strength and they easily broke earth to their own
advantage;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
lived in far greater affluence and prosperity than you now exhibit the
same;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
prophetess came to them with obvious miracles;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess was not inclined to treat them unjustly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
injured their own souls by their stubbornness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
infidelity, and their refusal to listen to their prophetess</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who would
have warned them of any impending disaster.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Rest
assured that the prophetess and her people were saved from disaster by
their faith in Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.10 For
the end of those who had done evil was a very sad resurrection
day;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they believed that the signs of Goddess were false, and they laughed
their prophetesses to scorn.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.11
Goddess produces all creatures, and will afterwards restore them to
life, then you shall return to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.12 And
on that day when the hour shall come, the unbelievers will be struck
dumb with sadness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
see all the good they might have done, they will not know what to
say,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet their
hearts will grieve mightily.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.13 And
they shall have no intercession from among the false idols they
worshiped</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
exhibited negative emotions of hate, jealousy, fear and violence,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
they had wrongfully associated with Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.14 On
the day and the hour when the final resurrection will come to them,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the true
believers and the unbelievers will be separated;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.15 and
those who shall have believed, and had brought righteousness into the
world, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall
take their pleasure in a delightful meadow;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.16 but
as for those who have disbelieved, and rejected our divine signs,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
resurrection and the next life, they will be delivered up to Goddess to
be purified.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.17
Wherefore, glorify Goddess, when the evening comes to you, and when you
arise in the morning,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.18 and
to Her is given all praise from heaven and upon the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and at
sunset, and if you rest at noon, give Her praise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.19 She
brings forth the living out of the dead, and She brings forth the dead
out of the
living,<a href="#_ftn64" id="_ftnref64"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
quickens the earth after it has been dead; and in a like manner you will
be brought back to life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from out
of your corpse.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.20 One
of Her signs is: that She has created you out of a divine spark,
minerals from earth and water,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
behold, you grow to women and men, and spread out over the entire face
of the earth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.21 And
another of Her signs is: that She has created from you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">out of
the love which is already within you, a strong marriage bond between
spouses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
you may live with them, and She has put love and compassion between
you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly,
these are signs to people who carefully consider matters.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.22 And
of Her signs are also the creation of the heavens and the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
variety of your languages, and your complexions, and music and art and
drama, your creativity;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly,
these are also important signs to people who carefully consider such
matters.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.23 And
of Her signs are also your sleeping by night, so that during the
day</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you might
seek to provide for yourselves out of Her abundance, and you might learn
and grow;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
these are signs to a people who carefully listen.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.24 Of
Her signs, others are that She shows you lightening,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to strike
terror and She will comfort you, to give hope of rain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
She sends down water from heaven which gives new life to the
soil,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">after it
appears to have been dead; certainly these are also signs to people that
try to understand matters.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.25 And
of Her signs, this is yet another one, namely,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that the
heaven and the earth are firmly separated by Her command;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">hereafter
when She will call you out of the earth, upon the final day of your
resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">behold,
you will be happy to come forward to Her out of your love for
Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.26 To
Her everything is subject which is in the heavens and upon the
earth;<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">       </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">everything
and creature is obedient to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.27 It
is She who originally produced creatures, and after they die, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She will
once again raise them to new life; and this is assuredly an easy task
for Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.28 She
shows you parables, comparisons and analogies, taken from your daily
lives.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do you
have, among your slaves, which your right hands possess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">any
partner in the substance we have bestowed upon you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
you become equal sharers with them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or do you
have trouble with them as you troubles with other
people?<a href="#_ftn65" id="_ftnref65"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus, we
may explain our signs, to people who easily understand them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.29 But
those that act unjustly, by attributing negative emotions of hate,
greed, jealousy, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nastiness
to Goddess, and who follow their own beliefs, and have no true
knowledge;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
shall direct her whom Goddess knows to have erred?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They will
have no entity to help them, if Goddess is not their protectress.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.30
Therefore, be liberal in your understandings, but set your heart on the
one true religion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
institution of Goddess, which She has created as a pattern for
womankind;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there is
complete perfection in what Goddess creates for you. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
the right religion; but the vast majority of the people do not know
this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.31 And
turn towards Her, and love Her with your entire heart, and be frequent
at prayer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not idolize false idols of wealth, greed, self centeredness and
violence.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.32 As
to those that have made a schism in their religion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and are
divided into various sects, every sect rejoices in its own
opinions,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet there
are many paths to Goddess, and you must respect them all.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.33
When adversity befalls women, they immediately call upon their Lady of
Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">turning
to Her; afterwards when She has granted them the mercy asked for,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">behold, a
portion of them associate false negative idols with Goddess, and return
to their old habits.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.34
They show themselves ungrateful for the favors which heaven has bestowed
upon them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.35
Have we sent down any authority to them, which speaks of a false
associate of Goddess </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with base
human emotions such as jealousy, hate, greed or envy?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.36
When we cause women to taste mercy, they immediately rejoice
therein,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but if
evil or hardship happens to them, and often it is a result of a
situation they themselves have created,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">behold
they despair and ask why does Goddess do this to them?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.37 Do
they not see that Goddess bestows provisions abundantly</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">upon many
people as She sees fit for their purpose; while others Goddess is
sparing with?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And many
of the poor find their own happiness regardless. Certainly these are
signs to people who believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.38
Give reasonable amounts to your needy relatives; and also to the poor,
and to the stranger:</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
better for those who seek to see the smiling face of Goddess, and they
will prosper.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.39
Whatever you shall take as excessive
usury<a href="#_ftn66" id="_ftnref66"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

be an increase of your substance,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall not
be increased by the blessings of Goddess; but whatever you give in alms,
in the name of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
amount will vastly multiply your reward with Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.40 It
is Goddess who has created you, and She has provided for you; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">hereafter
you will die at your appointed time, and She will be with you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and after
that She will raise you again to life.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do any of
your false idols of wealth, greed, power or jealousy help you do any of
these things?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">All
praises be to Her; and be far removed from associating your worship with
such things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.41
Disasters have appeared by land and by sea, and many people were not
saved that might have been,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for many
do not listen to their prophetesses, except those that were saved,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
tasted the sweet fruits of their steadfast faith, and the unbelievers
could note this, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
perhaps they might turn from their evil ways.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.42 Say
to the people, “Travel the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and see
what has been the end of many who have lived before you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">many of
them believed in and worshiped false idols of wealth, greed, power and
jealousy.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.43 Set
your heart towards the right religion, before the day comes, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when you
will hasten to the call of Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for there
will be none to prevent the unbelievers from seeing what harm they have
caused in the earth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.44
Whomever will have been an unbeliever,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
see how their unbelief caused themselves and others harm,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whomever shall have done righteousness, shall lounge on couches of
repose in paradise;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.45 so
that She may reward those who have believed, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
worked righteousness, out of Her abundant provisions;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
does not care for the unbelievers who have not asked for Her care and
Her bounty.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.46 One
of Her signs is that She sends the winds, bearing the welcome tidings of
rain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
She may show you Her mercy; and so that ships may sail at Her
command,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
you may seek to enrich yourselves out of Her abundance by your industry
and commerce;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so
that you might also give Her thanks.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.47 We
have sent prophetesses before you, to their respective peoples, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
came to them with obvious proofs; and when natural disasters came, which
they will,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">most
unbelievers died, yet many believers were saved, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for it
was incumbent upon us to assist the true believers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
the only true believers who perished in these disasters,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">did so
because they had agreed it was to be their time to leave earth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.48 It
is Goddess who sends down the winds, and She raises up the
clouds,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and also
spreads the clouds across the heavens as She pleases, and afterwards,
She disperses them away;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
may see the rain issuing from the midst of the clouds,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
She pours down rain on such of Her servants as She pleases,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">behold
they are filled with joy and they are thankful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.49
Although before the rains were sent down to them, before they received
such relief,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they had
been in deep despair.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.50
Consider therefore the traces of the mercy of Goddess; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">how She
brings new life to an earth that was barren, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
She will bring all the dead to life on the day of their resurrection as
well; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is the Almighty One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.51 Yet
if a blasting hot wind should come, and the corn turns yellow and
dies,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
would surely become ungrateful, many would blame this on Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">despite
all of Her previous favors sent to them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.52 You
can not make the dead to hear your call, nor can you make the deaf to
hear your call,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
will leave and turn their backs to you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.53
neither can you direct the blind out of their error; you shall make none
to hear, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
those believers who are attentive to our signs; for they are resigned to
the Lady of Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.54 It
is Goddess who has created you as a young weak child, but then She gave
you strength;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and after
you attained strength, again you will be reduced to weakness and grey
hairs;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
creates what is best for you, and She is the Wise One, the Powerful
One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.55 On
the day when the last and final resurrection shall come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
wicked will swear that they have only lived once and it was a good life,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in a like
manner they uttered lies in their lifetime.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.56 But
upon those who received knowledge, and those that received faith, will
say,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“You have
lived many lifetimes, one after the other and after you last died,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you have
now come to the day of your final resurrection, but you did not know
this.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.57 On
that day, their excuses will not avail them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
will be saddened when they see clearly what they have done on the earth;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
they be allowed to make further excuses for the wickedness which they
have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.58 And
now we have given you this Korana, with easily understood parables of
every kind;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet if
you bring them a verse, the unbelievers will surely say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“You are
no other than publishers of vain lies.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.59
Thus has Goddess allowed the hearts of many to harden </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">among
those that do not pray to Her or call upon Her when needed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">30.60 But
do, O prophetess, persevere in this matter, for Goddess is true;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not let those induce you to waver, who have no certain knowledge of
anything.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.3 it
is to be taken as a kind direction, and a mercy to the righteous;</span>

These believers are directed by their Lady of Light, and they shall
prosper.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.6
There is a person who purchases ludicrous and poorly told
stories,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that she
might seduce women from the ways of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
knowledge, and she laughs at the believers to scorn;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she will
suffer terribly on the day of her resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when she
sees all of the good that she might have

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as though
she does not hear them, as though there was an actual deafness in her
ears; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">wherefore,
she will be deeply saddened on the day of her resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when she
sees all the good she might have done.</span>

shall enjoy gardens of pleasure in the afterlife; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.9 they
shall continue in paradise forever; this is a certain promise of
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
is the Mighty One, the Wise One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.10 For
She has created the heavens without visible pillars to hold them
up,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has thrown about the earth many mountains, standing firm, so they do not
move with you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has replenished the earth with all kinds of creatures; and we send down
rain from heaven,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and cause
every kind of delicious vegetable to spring forth thereupon.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.11
This is the creation of Goddess; yet show me now what some people have
created,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
that have the idols of wealth, greed, power and envy to worship, besides
Her?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
the ungoddessly are in obvious error.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.12 We
have before this bestowed wisdom on
Lockelani<a href="#_ftn69" id="_ftnref69"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

directed her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying,
“Be thankful to Goddess; for whomever is thankful does so to the
advantage of her own soul; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
any person shall be unthankful, certainly Goddess is self sufficient,
and worthy to be praised.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.13 And
remember when Lokelani said to one of her daughters,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O my
child, do not partner Goddess with negative human emotions,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">such as
hate, jealousy, or greed, for this type of polytheism is a great
impiety.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.14 We
have directed woman concerning her parents, that the mother carried her
in her uterus,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
weakness and faintness, and then she nursed her baby for two or more
years,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying,
“Be grateful to Me, and to your parents.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">To Me
shall all persons come to see any errors in what they have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.15 But
sometimes, some parents will endeavor to prevail upon you</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
associate negative human emotions such as hate, violence, nastiness, and
the like with Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and these
are things which they have no knowledge of, and so you should not obey
them in this regard; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but bear
them kind and polite company in this world, what should be
reasonable;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but do
not follow the direction of anyone that creates impious lies concerning
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.16 O
my daughters, certainly every matter, whether good or bad,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whether
it is as small as the grain of a mustard seed, and hidden within a
rock,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or in the
heavens, or in the earth, Goddess will see and bring the same to
light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is clear sighted and the All Knowing One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.17 O
my daughters, be frequent at prayer, and command whatever is just, and
forbid what is evil;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and be
patient during the adverse trials which may befall you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for this
is a duty absolutely required of all women.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.18 Do
not make disdainful faces at others, nor should you walk upon the earth
with insolence;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess does not value arrogance or vanity in a person.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.19 And
be moderate in your pace at all things; do not shout when it is not
necessary in polite company;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for there
is no worse noise than the loud braying of a donkey.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.20 Do
you not see that Goddess has subjected many things</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">upon the
earth and what is in heaven to your service,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has abundantly poured upon you Her favors, both outwardly and
inwardly.<a href="#_ftn70" id="_ftnref70"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

when it is said to the people, “Follow what Goddess has revealed to
you,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
answer, “No, we will follow that which we found our foremothers
practicing.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

concepts of hate, jealousy, greed, violence, self centeredness,

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do you
not see that Goddess is pure love?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.22
Whomsoever resigns herself to Goddess, and is a worker of peace and
righteousness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will take
hold of a strong firm handle; and to Goddess belongs the issuance of all
good things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.23 But
whomever shall be an unbeliever, do not let her unbelief sadden
you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to heaven
everyone will return, and they will be shown what they have done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess knows the innermost parts of the hearts of women.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.24 We
will suffer them to enjoy all the riches and benefits of this
world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but for a
little while; afterwards we bring them back to us and show them the
great grief,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">sadness,
toil and troubles they have caused themselves and others,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">while
they were on this earth and did not care about the resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.25 If
you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will most
certainly answer “Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
them, “Goddess be praised!” But the vast majority of the people do not
understand.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.26 To
Goddess belongs whatever is in heaven and upon the earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is the self sufficient one, the praise worthy one.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.27 If
whatever trees in the earth became pens, and all that is in the seas
should be ink,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the words
of Goddess would not be exhausted.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.28
Your creation and your resurrection are but as the creation and
resurrection of one
soul.<a href="#_ftn71" id="_ftnref71"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

you not see that Goddess has caused the night to follow the day;</span>

causes the day to succeed the night, and She compels the sun and the

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.30
With Goddess is the only true reality and what you have on earth here is
not reality;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when you
invoke negative emotions and negative actions, these are not part of
truth and love;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is the Most High, and the Most Powerful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.31 Do
you not see that the ships sail the sea,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">only by
the favor of Goddess, that She may show you one of Her signs?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
these are signs and miracles for every patient, grateful person.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.32
When waves cover the boats, like overshadowing clouds,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
people upon the ships quickly call upon Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
find Her to be omnipotent and magnificent, as She is;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.33<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>exhibiting the correct feeling for the
pure religion and faith you should all have for Her; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but when
She brings all the people back safely to land,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there is
but a few of them that do not readily fall from the strength of the
faith formerly exhibited </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in a time
of distress, and then they add false, negative attributes to
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.34 O
women, love your Lady of Light greatly, as do the people on a wave
tossed ship,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and act
piously, as though the day of resurrection is drawing near,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for a
mother will not be able to make amends for her daughter on that
day;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
promise of Goddess is assuredly true. Do not let this present life,
therefore, deceive you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor let
the deceivers upon this earth lead you to deception concerning
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">31.35
Certainly the knowledge of the hour of judgment is with Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
causes the rain to descend at Her own appointed time,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and in
Her own way; and She is also the one that knows what is in the uterus of
every woman.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">No soul
knows what will happen tomorrow with certainty;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor does
any soul know where it is destined to die and pass over;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess is all knowing and fully acquainted with all these
things.</span>

All Creatures.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.3 Will
the people say, the prophetess has forged it without basis?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">No, the
truth has now come from the Lady of Light, that you may preach to all
peoples,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a light
that has not come before into the world; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
hopefully, all the light believing people will be rightly
directed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.4 It
is the Lady of Light who has created the heavens and the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whatever is between them, in six days; and then She ascended to Her
throne.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You have
no patroness or intercessor besides Her. Will you not therefore
consider?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.5 She
governs all things from heaven even down to the earth; hereafter
everyone shall return to Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
finally on the day whose length shall seem a thousand earth
years,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but will
pass in the twinkling of an eye, with much love, peace and joy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.6 This
is because She knows the future and the present; for She is the
Almighty, the Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.7 It
is She who has made everything and created it in a most excellent manner
and style;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
first created people from a divine spark, split the spark into two
entities, male and female,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.8 She
fashioned some materials from earth and much water,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
formed her into a proper shape, and breathed life into her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.9 and
She has given you the sense of hearing and seeing,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
hearts to understand and for compassion and love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">How small
thanks do most people return to Her!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.10 And
the people say, “When we lie in a grave, hidden in the earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">how shall
we be raised to new life?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yes, they
deny the resurrection and the meeting of their Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though it will be a joyous time for many.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.11 Say
to the people, “The angel of death, who is over those about to
die,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall
gently lift your spirit from you; you will be given back your spiritual
body,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
you shall come to see your Lady of Light, in another dimension.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.12 If
you could see that a bit later, when the wicked will bow down before the
Lady,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will ask “O Lady, we have seen our lives,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
great suffering we endured and caused others because we did not
believe,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
suffer us to return to the world, and we will work what is right;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">since we
are now certain of the truth of what was preached to us, and we have new
amazing sight.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.13 If
heaven had pleased we would have given every soul directly our
instructions, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from day
to day and everyplace all the people were; but the Word given by
Goddess, must be fulfilled,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so they
will return to earth, both humans and the genii or the haughty
ones,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.14<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>and this will be like hell for them,
because they will have no guardian angels,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and earth
is a difficult and dangerous place.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Still
they must forget before they leave and improve their own souls without
any remembrance of the past.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.15
Most certainly they only believe in our signs, when they are in
immediate danger,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then they
fall down adoring and worshiping, and they celebrate the praise of their
Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
are not elated with pride;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.16 and
when a person is suffering, their side will raise from their
beds,<a href="#_ftn74" id="_ftnref74"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.17 No
soul knows the complete satisfaction, which is secretly prepared for
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as a
reward for that which they have done, at or after the time they have
done it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.18
Shall a person, therefore, who is a true believer, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">be held
in the same esteem as one who was an impious transgressor?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Of course
not, they will not be held equal, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
neither do you know all the plans that Goddess has made for each
soul,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so you
must not judge; this is the sole prerogative of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.19 As
to those who believe and do that which is right,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
shall have gardens of perpetual happiness, as an ample compensation for
all of their good works.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.20 But
as for those who have impiously erred, their next abode after their
resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall be
rebirth to earth, which shall be like hell fire to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
will not have guardian angels or a protectress there,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
they perchance call upon them for assistance and guidance.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">So often
as they might try to escape this, they will be enticed by the beauty and
riches upon the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will gladly return.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.21 And
we will cause them to taste the difficulties of earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
until they believe, they will taste the same difficulties of yet another
life on earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
guardian angels or Goddess, unless they repent and call upon Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.22 Who
is more unjust than one who is warned by the signs of the Lady of Light,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
she turns away? For these people, they shall return to earth, without
any help or guidance.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.23 We
have before this delivered a Book of Scripture to Miriam,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
should not be in doubt as to the revelation of this Book;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
ordained the same to be a direction to the Children of Israel.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.24 And
we appointed teachers from among them, who were able to direct the
people at our command,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
had persevered with patience, and they had firmly believed in our
signs.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.25
Certainly, the Lady of Light will advise them of what they have done,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of their resurrection, even though before this they had disagreed
among themselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.26 Why
do they not consider how many generations which were destroyed before
them</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who had
been warned by a prophetess, but they still refused to believe
her?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
here are signs and miracles; will the people will not listen
carefully?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.27 Do
the people not see that we drive rain to a land bare of grass and dried
up,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
it soon produces corn, of which the cattle eat, and themselves
also?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Will they
not hold all of this in high regard?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.28 The
unbelievers say to the true believers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“On the
day of decision, the faith of those that have disbelieved will not
assist them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor shall
they be relieved any longer.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">32.29
Therefore, avoid discussion with them politely, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
advise them sincerely and cordially when asked regarding Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Most of
them only expect to gain some advantage over you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In the
name of the most Merciful Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.1 O
prophetess, love Goddess with all your heart and soul,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
certainly Goddess is the All Knowing One and She is All Wise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.2 But
follow only that which has been revealed to you from the Lady of Light;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is well acquainted with all that you do.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.3 And
put your trust in Goddess, for Goddess is an excellent
protectress.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.4
Goddess knows that a woman does not have two hearts within her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor has
She made your husbands your true
fathers,<a href="#_ftn75" id="_ftnref75"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>despite the fact that you have
divorced some men,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">regarding
them afterwards as “your fathers.” Nor has She made your adopted sons
your true sons.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
your saying in your mouths, but Goddess speaks the truth and She directs
the right way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.5 Call
those which you claim have been adopted, only the sons of their natural
fathers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
more just in the sight of Goddess. And if you did not know their
fathers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">let them
be as your brothers in religion, and your companions,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
will be no crime in you, that you have erred in this matter,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but there
is serious error when your hearts purposely intend it, for Goddess is
gracious and merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.6 The
prophetess is nearer to the true believer than their own kin, and her
husband is your father.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Those who
are related by blood and are true believers are nearer of kin to one
another,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">than are
kin who are not true believers, according to the Book of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But you
should do what is fitting and reasonable to your relations in
general.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">   </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">All
others are on earth are your neighbors, and you are to be polite and
kind to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
is written in the Book of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.7
Remember when we accepted the promises from the prophetesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and from
you, O prophetess, and from Nora, and Sarah and Miriam,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Mother Mary, and Mary Magdalene, all of which were high priestesses and
prophetesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
promise was also accepted of Yeshua, son of Mother Mary.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We
received this firm promise from each of them</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.8 that
Goddess may examine the speakers of truth concerning their
veracity,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has prepared difficult plans for the unbelievers, but She will not harm
or torment them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.9 O
true believers, remember the favor of Goddess towards you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when the
armies of the unfaithful came against you, and we sent a wind against
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and a
host of angels, which you did not see, and Goddess saw all the things
which you did.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.10
When they came against you from above you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and from
below you, and when your mind became troubled,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and your
hearts flew to your throats out of fear, and you imagined that Goddess
was not with you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.11
there the faithful were tried, and made to tremble, with a severe
trembling.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.12 And
when the hypocrites and those whose hearts had hardened threatened
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
needed only to remember that Goddess and Her prophetess does not make
any fictitious promises.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.13 And
when a certain party said, “O inhabitants of
Yamka<a href="#_ftn76" id="_ftnref76"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">[76]</span></span></span></span></a>,
there is no place of security for you here,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
return home,” for it is often difficult to fight a nonviolent
battle,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
others wish to assail you, yet you have promised others to defend them
and their homes,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
were assailed upon. And a part of them asked leave of the prophetess to
depart,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying
“Certainly our homes are defenseless and exposed to the enemy,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though they were not defenseless; and their intention was nothing other
than to flee </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
defensive battle, helping an oppressed people.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.14 If
their city had been entered upon then by the enemy from parts nearby,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
had been asked to desert the true believers, and to fight against
them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they had
certainly consented thereto; but they had not stayed, but a little
while.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.15
They had before made a promise to Goddess, that they would not turn
their backs,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
would stand firm, and that the performance of their promise with
Goddess</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will be
examined in the hereafter.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.16 Say
to the people, “Flight will not profit you, if you fly from death or
slaughter,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
you understood, you would know that your enjoyment of this world is but
for a short time.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.17 Say
to the people, “Who will intercede for you, on the day of your
resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if she
leads you into evil, for the avoidance of evil is best and the mercy of
Goddess is infinite.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The evil
ones will find no one to be their patroness or protectress, besides
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.18
Goddess already knows those among you who prevent others from following
the prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
say to their sisters, come listen to us, for we know many ways to be
violent towards others,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
sake of their religion.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.19
This is because they are desirous of your attentions, yet when they are
fearful,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
seek you out for assistance, their eyes rolling about like those
suffering the pains of death;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet when
their fear has subsided, they invoke use of their sharp tongues with
you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
there are any spoils from those that have fled, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
cowards always desire the most valuable portion of any spoils. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
would never even dream of returning spoils to their rightful owners,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or if
that could not be determined, then to a charity serving the people of
that area, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
commanded by your Goddess. These people say they believe, but they are
not sincere, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
Goddess will set plans and arrange more trials and tribulations on earth
for them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for all
this is easy with Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.20 The
brave ones imagined that their cowardly friends would not depart,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">leaving
them to fight alone in defense of an oppressed people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
their friends returned, they would rather live in the desert with the
Arabs who dwell in tents,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
only inquire of news concerning you; and although they defended their
homes with you this time,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
still fought defensively, but a very little.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.21 You
have in the prophetess of Goddess an excellent example,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
illustrate for you that she who puts her hope in Goddess, and the day of
her resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
remembers Goddess frequently, will do well in this lifetime.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.22
Whenever the true believers saw their friends, they said, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This is
what Goddess and Her prophetess have foretold us;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess and Her prophetess have spoken the truth; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
only increased their faith and determination.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.23 Of
the true believers, some women properly performed what they had promised
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">while
some of them have finished their loyal
covenant,<a href="#_ftn77" id="_ftnref77"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

some gained some
advantage;<a href="#_ftn78" id="_ftnref78"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
did not change their promise by deviating therefrom in the least.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.24 But
Goddess will exceedingly reward the just performers of their promises
for their loyalty,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
hypocrites will be greatly saddened on the day of their
resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
see all the good that they might have done;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess is always ready to forgive, and She is the Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.25
Goddess has driven back the unfaithful in their wrath, they obtained no
advantage,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess was a sufficient protectress to the faithful,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in their
defensive battle of a greatly oppressed people; for Goddess is strong
and mighty.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.26 And
She has caused the people who have received the Scriptures,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as have
assisted the allies, to come down out of their fortresses, and make
peace with their enemies,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and forge
fair and equitable treaties, and fill their hearts with love and hope of
peace;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
saw the grief of dying in battle, and the sadness of the prisoner and
their hearts were sympathetic.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.27
When some fled the area out of terror,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
allowed you to inherit the land of the homes of the oppressors,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
received your wealth, and even additional lands which you never stepped
foot upon, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is the Almighty One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.28 O
prophetess, say to your husband, “If you seek the present life, and the
pomp thereof,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in lieu
of the life to come, I will provide you with wealth, but if you do not,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then I
will also dismiss you with an honorable dismissal.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.29 But
if you seek Goddess and Her prophetess, and the life to come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
Goddess has prepared for you, for your works of righteousness, a great
reward.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.30 O
the husband of the prophetess, whomever of you have committed any
wickedness, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
you repent, your sadness on the day of your resurrection will be greatly
increased, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for this
is easy with Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.31 But
whomever of you will be obedient to Goddess and the prophetess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
does what is right, your reward shall be greatly increased,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have prepared for you an honorable provision in paradise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.32 O
husband of the prophetess, you are not as other men;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if you
love Goddess, be not complaisant in
speech,<a href="#_ftn79" id="_ftnref79"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

other women might desire you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">out of
their own lack of control for their lustful desires for you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
rebuke them with firm convenient speech.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.33 And
it is best to stay at home, rather than to wander the streets,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in an
ostentatious display of material wealth for the purpose of attracting
other women, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
observe frequent prayer, and give alms, and obey Goddess and Her
prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess only desires to remove from you the evil of vanity,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">since you
are in the household of your prophetess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you need
to purify your behavior by a perfect purification.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.34 And
remember of what is read in your homes,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the best
readings are always the Words of Goddess, and the wisdom related in the
Korana;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess has clear sight, and is well acquainted with all of your
actions.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.35
Certainly the Moslemas of either gender, and the true believers of
either gender,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
devout women, and the devout men, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and women
of truth, and the men of truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
patient women, and the patient men,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
humble women, and the humble men,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
alms givers of either sex,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
women who fast, and the men who fast,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
chaste women, and the chaste men,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
of either sex who remember Goddess frequently;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for them
Goddess has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.36 It
is not fit for a true believer of either sex, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
Goddess and Her prophetess have decided a matter, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that a
person should have the liberty of changing this on their own;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whomever is disobedient to Goddess and Her prophetess, surely errs with
obvious error.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.37 And
remember when you say to a person to whom Goddess has been
gracious,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and upon
whom you have also given favors, “Keep your husband to yourself, and
love Goddess,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
did conceal in your mind that which Goddess had determined to
uncover,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
did fear another woman,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">still it
would have been more appropriate to act out of your love for
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But when
Zebina<a href="#_ftn80" id="_ftnref80"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

determined a matter concerning her husband,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and had
resolved to divorce him from her, we would join her husband in marriage
to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but only
if you desired it, unless a crime should be charged upon the true
believers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
marrying the husbands of their followers, and when they have determined
the matter concerning them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they knew
that the command of Goddess must be
performed.<a href="#_ftn81" id="_ftnref81"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.38 No
crime is to be charged on the prophetess, as to what Goddess has allowed
her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and what
is conformable to the ordinance of Goddess with respect to those that
came before her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
command of Goddess is a determined decree;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.39 for
it was the prophetess who brought the messages of Goddess and loved Her,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
loves no other goddess besides Her; for Goddess is a sufficient
accountant of deeds.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.40 The
prophetess is not the mother of any child among you; but she is the
prophetess of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
bears the seal of the prophetesses; and Goddess knows all things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.41 O
true believers, remember Goddess with frequent remembrance;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.42 and
celebrate Her praise morning and evening.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.43 It
is She who is gracious to you, and Her angels intercede for you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
She may lead you forth from darkness into light; and She is merciful
towards the true believers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.44
Their greeting, on the day when they shall meet Her again,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will be
“Peace!” and She has prepared for them an honorable compensation.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.45 O
prophetess, certainly we have sent you to be a witness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and a
bearer of good tidings and to announce the love of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.46 And
you should be one who invites the people to accept Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.47
Bear good tidings therefore to the true believers, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
will receive great abundance from Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.48 But
do not obey the unbelievers or the hypocrites, and pay no attention to
their evil treatment;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but trust
in Goddess; and Goddess is a sufficient protectress.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.49 O
true believers, when you marry men who are true believers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
afterwards divorce them, before you have touched them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there is
no minimum time to wait to finalize the divorce,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">other
than that which is proscribed by law, and dismiss them with an honorable
dismissal.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.50 O
prophetess, we have allowed you husbands,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
have bestowed upon them gifts which are theirs.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And you
also have servants which Goddess has brought to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
have nephews on your father’s side, and on your mother’s side,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and these
have fled with you from other lands, and there are believing men you met
in other lands, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if they
give themselves to the prophetess, in case you desire in the future to
take any as a husband.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is a
peculiar advantage granted to you, above the rest of the true
believers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We know
what we have ordained them concerning marrying a spouse, and their
servants or employees,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
this be deemed a crime to make use of the privilege we are granting you,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is gracious and merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.51 You
may postpone the taking to bed of your husband at any time,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as you
please, in being called to your duty, and your husband should be
receptive in coming to your bed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whenever
you please; and he should not feel rejected when you do not.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This will
be easier for you, that you both may be contented,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and he
should not be grieved, but he should be well pleased with what Goddess
has given him;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
knows whatever is in your hearts and minds; and Goddess is knowing and
gracious.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.52 It
shall not be lawful for you to take any other man as your
husband,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">hereafter,
unless your husband has divorced you on just grounds or has died, or you
have divorced him,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
should you exchange anything for him, although the beauty of someone
might please you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
includes your servants or employees; and Goddess sees all things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.53 O
true believers, do not enter the home of the prophetess, unless it is
permitted you to eat with her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
should wait for her during a convenient time, but when you are invited,
then enter.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
you have eaten, you should leave, and not stay to enter into vain
discussion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
you have been so invited, for this inconveniences the prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She is
ashamed to request that you leave; but Goddess is not ashamed of the
truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
you ask of the prophetess’ family what you desire,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">ask them
respectfully, and at a distance, invading not their personal
space.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This will
be more pure for your hearts and their hearts.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Nor is it
fitting for you to give any uneasiness to the prophetess of
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or to
marry any of her husbands after her; for this would be a sad thing in
the sight of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.54
Whether you divulge a thing or conceal it, certainly Goddess knows all
things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.55 It
shall not be a crime for any woman to speak to any man, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or to
their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brothers’
sons,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or their
sisters’ sons or their women, or their servants,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if they
speak to them unveiled; for you should love Goddess; for Goddess is
witness of all things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.56
Certainly Goddess and Her angels bless the prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">O true
believers, do you also bless her, and greet her with a cordial
greeting?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.57 As
for those persons who offend Goddess and Her prophetess </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
negative emotions, hate, jealousy, violence or greed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
have great sadness on the day of their resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
see all the good that they failed to accomplish.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.58 And
those who injure the true believers of either sex, without their
deserving it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall
also see great sadness on the day of their resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
see all the good that they failed to accomplish.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.59 O
prophetess, speak to the wives and the daughters you know,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
the wives and daughters of the true believers, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
no longer have to place outer garments over them when they walk
outside,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
more proper and convenient for them, and all men should be respectful of
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so they
do not feel the need to utilize outer garments, for when they do, this
shows disgrace to their men,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
feel they must cover up themselves to be safe,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not let any man accuse them of having an ill reputation when they are
not covered up,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
rebuke those men that would threaten a woman for no such good
reason,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">other
than she is not covered, for it is the actions of such men that are
immodest and unseemly, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
should be properly rebuked for their improper actions against
women.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.60<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Certainly, if the hypocrites and those
who have hardened their own hearts,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
who raise disturbances in the places of worship do not desist,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
surely be chastised for such actions, and they should not be allowed to
live nearby.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.61 For
the wicked people that do such things,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
create harm to the persons and property of the places of worship,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">should be
arrested and imprisoned for the crimes they commit against the believers
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
places in which they worship. For they are full of error, and when they
are found, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
should be arrested, tried and imprisoned, if they are found guilty;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
should not be subject to cruel or unusual punishment, including beatings
or torture.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.62
This is the sentence of Goddess concerning these people;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will not find any change in the sentence of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.63
Women will ask you concerning the approach of the last hour,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">answer
them, “Certainly the knowledge of this is with Goddess only;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will not inform me; perhaps the hour is near at hand, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
should never fear it, for Goddess is gracious.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.64
Certainly Goddess grieves for the unfaithful, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will have great sadness on the day of their resurrection</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
see all the good that they might have accomplished.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.65 And
after they have been resurrected, they will return to earth
again,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
shall be like hell fire, to walk upon the earth without a protectress or
any guardian angels.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.66 On
the day whereupon they shall see the sadness they caused in their
lifetime,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
say, “O how we wished that we had obeyed Goddess, and her
apostle.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.67 And
they shall say, “O Lady of Light, certainly we obeyed our leaders on
earth </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
people having much knowledge there, but we were seduced into
error.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">33.68 “O
Lady of Light, give the seducers double our punishment;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and curse
them with a heavy curse!”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And the
Lady will respond,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“I am all
love and compassion, I do not punish, I only discipline.<span

her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.5 “But
those who endeavor to render our signs and miracles null and of no
effect</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall be
greatly saddened on the day of their resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
see all the good that they might have done.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.6
Those to whom the knowledge has been given,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will see
the Book which has been revealed to you from the Lady of Light is in
fact Truth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and will
direct you to the glorious and laudable way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.7 The
unbelievers will say to one another, “Shall we show you a woman who will
prophesy to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that when
you have been dispersed with total dispersion, you will be raised to a
new creature?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.8
“This prophetess has forged lies concerning Goddess, or rather she is
insane.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But those
people who do not believe in the life to come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will be
very saddened on the day of their resurrection in seeing all the people
which</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they had
led astray in wide error.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.9 Did
they not consider what happened before them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and what
is after them, and did they not see all the love that is in the heavens
and on the earth?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But they
are told by Evil that the angels debate all the time about whatever they
please, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
heaven will cause the earth to open up and swallow them alive.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Or, often
Evil says the angels will cause pieces from heaven to fall upon the
people and kill them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
clearly that is not what heaven does, for the angels are pure
love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
here is a sign to every servant who turns to Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.10 We
have also bestowed on Denise excellence from us;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
said, “O mountains, sing alternate praises with her,” and we obliged the
birds to join in the same. And we softened iron for her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.11
saying, “Make coats of mail, as a defense to those who would harm
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and also
use small plates within it to strengthen it; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and work
righteousness by making peace with your enemies, whenever possible.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">O family
of Denise, I, your Lady of Light, see all the good that you do.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.12 And
we made the wind subject to Salome;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it blew
in the morning for a month, and then in the evening for a month.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And we
made a fountain of molten brass to flow for Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And some
of the genii or haughty ones were obliged to work in her
presence,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by the
command of the Lady of Light, and whomever of them turned aside from our
command,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be greatly saddened on the day of their resurrection, when they see all
the grief they caused,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and all
the goodness they might have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.13
They made for her whatever she pleased of palaces, and
statutes,<a href="#_ftn87" id="_ftnref87"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

standing firm on trivets, and we said, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Work
righteousness, O family of Denise, with thanksgiving; for few servants
are truly thankful.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.14 And
when we had decreed that it was Salome’s time to pass,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nothing
discovered her death to them, except the creeping things of the
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and these
gnawed her staff. And when her body fell down, the genii plainly knew
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that if
they had known her secrets, they would not have endeavored in
evil,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and would
not have to encounter sadness on the day of their
resurrection.<a href="#_ftn90" id="_ftnref90"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.15 The
descendants of Saba had seen a sign in their house;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">namely
two gardens on the right hand, and two on the left,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
was said to them, “Eat of the provisions from your Lady of Light, and
give thanks to Her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for you
have a good country, and a gracious Lady of Light.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.16 But
then they turned aside from what they were commanded;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and no
longer did we provide special care to their gardens,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so
they withered, and the fruit became bitter and dry,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and only
tamarisks<a href="#_ftn91" id="_ftnref91"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
their gardens were flooded with waters from
Arama.<a href="#_ftn93" id="_ftnref93"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

This happened because they were ungrateful, and does this not happen
often to the ungrateful?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.18<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And we placed between them and the
cities which are blessed, cities situated near to one another;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
made the journey easy between them, saying,</span>

between the cities, by day and night, in security.”</span>

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
were unjust to themselves, and we made them the subject of legends,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and these
ungrateful ones were dispersed with total dispersion.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly,
here are signs to every patient, grateful person.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.20 And

Evil had no true power over them, unless to tempt them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

does the Lady of Light say?” They will answer, “That which is just, and

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Answer
them, “Goddess; and either we or you follow the one true religion, or we

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.25 Say

speak the truth?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.30
Answer them, “You will not know the day, nor the hour, nor will you
hasten this time.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.31 The
unbelievers will say, “We will by no means believe in this

Lady of Light!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

initiate conversation with one another wherein one that was esteemed
weak </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">On the
contrary, you acted wickedly out of your own free will, so do not blame
us for your situation.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.33 And
those who were esteemed weak shall say to those who behaved with

the crafty plot which you devised by night and by day led us to
ruin;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when you
commanded that we should not believe in Goddess,</span>

we should worship wealth, greed, power and self centeredness as equals

shall conceal their repentance, after which they shall grieve as they
begin to see </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">all the
wrongful actions and the hurt that they caused others.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.34 We
have sent no prophetess to any city, but the inhabitants therein who
lived in affluence said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly
we do not believe that you are sent by Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.35 And
those of Mecca also say, “We abound in riches and children,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">more than
you, and we will never be punished for any evil things that we
do.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.36
Answer the people, “Certainly my Lady will bestow provisions in
abundance </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to whom
She pleases, and will be sparing to those as it is best for
them.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But the
vast majority of people do not know this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.37
Neither your riches nor your children are the things which will cause
you to draw near to us; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">only
those that believe, and work righteousness, they will receive a greatly
increased reward </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for that
which they shall have done; and they shall dwell in security, in the
upper apartments of paradise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.38 But
those who endeavor to render the signs of Goddess void shall be steeped
in sadness </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of their resurrection, when they see all the goodness they might
have done, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if only
they had believed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.39 Say
to the people, “Certainly my Lady of Light will grant provisions in
abundance </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to whom
She pleases out of her servants, but She will be sparing, unto those it
is best for;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whatever thing you shall give in alms, She will return it many times
over,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
is the best provider of food.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.40 On
a certain day, She shall gather all the souls together;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then She
will say to the angels, “Did they worship you?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.41 And
the angels would say, “Some were grateful and thankful to us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
majority of them worshiped their own idols of wealth, greed, power and
self centeredness; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">most
believed in this evil rather than the love of Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.42 On
this day none of you shall be able to profit or to hurt another.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And we
will say to those that have acted unjustly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“You will
be purified by the Light, and it will not harm you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.43
When our evident signs and miracles are read to them, they will say to
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O
prophetess, you are no other than a woman who seeks to turn us</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">away from
the idolization of wealth, greed and power, which we love,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and which
our foremothers loved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And they
say of the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This is
none other than a blasphemous lie.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>And the unbelievers say of the truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when it
comes to them, “This is none other than manifest dark magic.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.44 Yet
we have given them no Books of Scripture wherein they might discover the
lies of the forgers, nor have we sent to them any prophetess before you
that taught anything else.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.45
Those people, who before were like them in manner, accused their
prophetesses of lying; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but these
people have not even arrived to but one tenth</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of the
riches and strength that we have granted the people before them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and yet
they still accuse My prophetess of lying, and how great My sadness
was!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.46 Say
to the people, “Certainly I advise you that you will do one
thing;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">namely,
that on the day of your resurrection, you will stand before
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">two by
two and singly, then consider this matter seriously and you will find
that there is no insanity </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in your
prophetess, for she is none other than a preacher and an announcer of
the love of Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
you might turn toward Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.47 Say
to the people, “I ask not of you any reward for my preaching,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is
your own blessing, either to spread or not to spread, my reward is
expected from Goddess alone,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
is witness over all things.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.48 Say
to the people, “Certainly my Lady sends down the truth to Her
prophetesses; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She is
the Knower of all Secrets.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.49 Say
to the people, “Truth has come and falsehood has vanished, and will not
return any morel”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.50 Say
to the people, “If I err, then certainly I err only as against my own
soul;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but if I
am rightly directed, it will be by that which my Lady of Light has
revealed to me;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is ready to hear, and near to those that call upon Her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.51 If
you could see, when the unbelievers are grieving for what they have
done, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will not have happiness at that time, and they will be taken to a nearby
place,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.52 and
they shall say, “We believe in Her!”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>But how shall they receive the faith from a distant place?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.53 But
they denied Goddess before this, and they reviled the mysteries of faith
from their distant place.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">34.54 And
they will then reenter the earth,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>and a veil is placed between</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

name of the most Merciful Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.1
Praise be unto Goddess, the Creatress of heaven and of earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who makes
the angels Her messengers, furnished with two, and then three, and then

hold this back,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
is none that can grant, besides Goddess; for She is the Almighty One and
the Wise One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.3 O
women, remember the favor of Goddess towards you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">is there
any creatress besides Goddess, who provides food for you from heaven and
from earth?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">There is
no Goddess but She; how therefore are you turned aside from
acknowledging Her unity?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.4 If
they accuse you of lying, prophetesses long before you have also been
accused of lying;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
Goddess shall all things return.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.5 O
women, certainly the promise of Goddess is true; therefore do not let
the present life deceive you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor let
the deceivers deceive you concerning Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.6 for
Evil is an enemy to you; therefore hold Evil as an enemy;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
entity only invites his friends to be the inhabitants of earth, over and
over again.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.7 For
those who do not believe, they will be greatly saddened on the day of
their resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but for
those who believe and do that which is right, there is prepared for them
a mercy and great reward.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.8
Shall the person for whom an evil work has been prepared </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and whom
imagines it to be good, is to be the same as one who is rightly
disposed, and discerns the truth?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
Goddess will not help those that do not seek Her; but will direct those
that call upon Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do not
let your heart make repeated sighs for those that do not want to
believe, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess well knows all that they do.<span

is Goddess who sends the winds, and She raises up the clouds;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
drive the same to a barren country, and will enliven the soil after it
has been barren,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as this
happens to the land, so shall your resurrection be to your soul.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.10
Whoever desires excellence, to Goddess does all excellence
belong;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to Her
ascends all good speech and the righteous work will exalt.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But as
for those people who devise wicked plots,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
suffer great sadness on the day of their resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
device of those people will be rendered void.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.11 For
Goddess created, first out of a divine spark, then out of minerals from
the earth and water, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
an ovum, and then She makes you a wife with a husband.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">No woman
conceives, or bears a child, without Her knowledge.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Nor is
there generally any days added to the age of a person whose time has
come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but which
has already been written in the Akashic records. Certainly this is easy
with Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.12 The
two seas are not to be held in comparison; one is fresh and sweet a
pleasure to drink;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
other is salty and unpleasant, yet out of each you are given delicious
fish from each,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
take

therefrom for you to wear. You also see ships traversing the
waves,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
might seek to enrich yourselves by commerce, from the abundance of
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">perhaps
you should be truly thankful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.13 She
causes the night to follow the day, and the day to follow the
night;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
obliges the sun and the moon to perform their services; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">each of
them orbits in an appointed course. This is Goddess, your Lady of Light;
to Her is the Queendom.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But the
idols you worship of wealth, greed and power, they do not even have
power over a date stone.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">On the
day of your resurrection, they will not claim you or give you
protection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will not give you Truth, as Goddess will on that day.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.15 O
women!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>While you have need of
Goddess, She does not need you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is self sufficient, and to be praised.</span>

Evil tells you, “If She wanted, She will take you away and put a new
people in your stead,” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
is not true, for She loves you greatly. It is more correct to say, “If
She pleased, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
have done well, She could move you to a more prosperous land, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
another less fortunate nation would then take your place.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.17 And
this cannot be done by Evil.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Evil

heavy burdened soul tries to call upon another to bear part of its
burden,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">no part

closely related.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

frequent at prayer, and those who cleanse themselves of the guilt of
disobedience,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

to the advantage of her own soul; </span>

Certainly we have sent you truth, and to be a bearer of good
tidings,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
should be an announcer of the Love of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.24
There has been no nation, but a preacher has in past times </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">been sent
to them to converse among them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.25 if
they charge you with lying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">many
people who lived before this also charged their prophetesses with
lying.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Their
prophetesses came to them with evident miracles and with divine
writings,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and with
enlightening Books;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.26
afterwards, many were shown the errors of their ways that were
unbelievers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and how
great was their sadness on the day of their resurrection!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.27 Do
you not see that Goddess sends down rain from heaven,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
we thereby produce fruits of various colors and types?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In the
mountains also there are some tracts colored white and red,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of
various colors, and some are a deep black.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.28 And
of humans and beasts and cattle, there are colors that are similarly of
many variations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Only
those that love Goddess will be endued with complete understanding;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
Goddess is almighty and ready to forgive.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.29
Certainly those who read the Book of Goddess and are frequent at
prayer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and give
alms out of what we have granted them, both in secret and openly,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">hope for
a type of good merchandise which will never perish;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.30 and
rest assured that Goddess pays every soul what they have earned,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
often receive as their reward many times over what they have
earned;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is the Frequent Bestower, and the Most Appreciative One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.31
That which we have revealed to you from the Book of the Korana is the
truth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">confirming
the Scriptures which were revealed before,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
adding in additional and more correct information that you will now
understand;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess knows and provides regards to Her servants.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.32 And
we have given the Book of the Korana in heritage to such of our servants
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as we
have carefully chosen; yet there are those that continually injure their
own souls;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
are others who keep the moderate

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by the
permission and supplication to Goddess. This is the great
excellence.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.33
Those believers shall be introduced into gardens of perpetual
abode;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, pearls, and their clothing
shall be made from silk;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.34 and
they shall say, “Praise be to Goddess, who has taken away sorrow from
us!” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
our Lady of Light is ready to forgive those who have erred, and to
reward the obedient;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.35
those who have caused us to take our rest in a dwelling of eternal
stability;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">though
Her great bounty, where no labor shall touch us, nor any weariness
affect us.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.36 But
as for the unbelievers is prepared yet another incarnation on
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without a
protectress and guardian angels, which will be like hell;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
be born again; and they will not avoid this discipline; nor will it be
made easier for them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus
shall every unbeliever be rewarded.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.37 And
they shall cry out aloud once again upon the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Lady of
Light, please take us to heaven, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will act righteously therein, and not do what we formerly did.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But it
will be answered to them, “Were you not provided with lives of
sufficient length,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
whomever that might be warned, would be warned; and did not a prophetess
come to you?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore,
experience the pain and suffering of earth, until you turn to
Her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And the
unjust shall have no protectress, until they call out to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.38
Certainly Goddess knows all the secrets of both heaven and earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
knows the innermost parts of the hearts of humans.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.39 It
is She who has made you to come into the earth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Whomever
shall disbelieve, upon her is her own disbelief;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
unbelief shall gain the unbelievers even more sadness</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of their resurrection with Goddess. Yet She will not harm or
threaten them in any way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.40 Say
to the people, “What do you think now of worshiping</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">greed,
power and wealth, which you sought out, but did not call upon
Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Show me
what part of earth they have created or sustained. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Or did
they share in the creation of the heavens?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Were the
unbelievers given the Book of revelations,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so they
may rely on any proof therefore to authorize what they do?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">No, but
the ungoddessly make to one another only deceitful promises.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.41
Certainly Goddess sustains the heavens and the earth, less they
fail;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
they should fail, none could support them, except Her; She is gracious
and merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.42
Some people swore by Goddess, with almost solemn oath, that if a
prophetess had come to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
would have been better directed than any nation; but now a prophetess
has come to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but it
has only increased their aversion from the truth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.43
their arrogance in the earth, and their contrivance of evil;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
contrivance of evil shall only encompass the authors of it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do they
expect anything other than that which happened to the unbelievers before
them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
should suffer grief?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For you
shall not find any change over time in the ordinance of Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor shall
you find any variations in interpreting the ordinance of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.44
Have they not traveled the earth and seen what has happened to the many
peoples before them?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Although
they were more might in strength than the prior peoples were, they
perished.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
will not be frustrated by anything either in heaven,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or upon
the earth; for She is the Wise and the Powerful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">35.45 If
Goddess should punish women and men according to what they
deserve,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She would
not leave anything on the earth, except beasts; but She respites them to
a determined time;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
the time has come, certainly Goddess will properly instruct Her

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.5 This
is a revelation of the most Mighty, the Merciful Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.6 that
you may bring the love of Goddess to a people whose mothers were not
told of this great love;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
lived neglected lives without it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.7 Our
decrees have been pronounced to the vast majority of the people; yet
most do not believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.8
Their errors and stubbornness are like yokes on their
necks,<a href="#_ftn101" id="_ftnref101"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and these
come up to their chins; and they must strain to hold up their
heads;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.9 and
we have set a veil before them, and a veil around them, when they are on
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so they
do not see paradise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.10 It
will be no matter to them whether you preach to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or do not
preach to them at all, for they do not desire to believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.11 But
you shall preach effectively to only those who follow the commands of
the Korana, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and know
the love of the Merciful One in secret.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore
bear good tidings to women, out of your mercy,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and for
that you will receive an honorable reward in the afterlife.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.12
Certainly we will restore the dead to life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
works will be recorded, and their footsteps left behind we will
know;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
everything which was done will be recorded in an easily reviewed
recording devic.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.13
Propound to them as an example the inhabitants of the city of
Antonia,<a href="#_ftn102" id="_ftnref102"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">[102]</span></span></span></span></a></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when the
prophetesses of Yeshua came to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.14 two
prophetesses were sent to them, but the people charged them with
lying.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Then we
strengthened the two with a third.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And they
said, “Certainly we were sent to you from Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.15 The
inhabitants answered, “You are just like any other woman,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">no
different from any of us; nor has the Merciful One revealed anything to
you; you only speak lies.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.16 The
prophetesses replied, “Our Lady of Light knows that we really were sent
to you;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.17
“and our duty is only to preach and teach.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.18 The
people of Antonia replied, “Certainly we are afraid of evil emanating
from you; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if you do
not desist from preaching, we will stone you, and this will be a painful
and deadly punishment.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.19 The
prophetesses answered, “Your evil emanations come only from
yourselves;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
you have been told you are absolutely forbidden to use violence against
one another, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">why do
you persist in error? Certainly you are a people that transgress
exceedingly.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.20 And
a certain person came swiftly from the outskirts of the city,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and said,
“O my people, follow the prophetesses of Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.21
follow the women that do not command any reward from you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for these
prophetesses are rightly directed.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.22
“What reason do I have that I should not worship Her who created me?
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For to
Her all things will return.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.23
“Should I have for goddesses wealth, greed, power and self centeredness?
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If the
Merciful One allows afflictions to assail me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">their
assistance will not alleviate my condition, nor will they deliver
me;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.24
then I will be in manifest error.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.25
“Certainly I believe in your Lady of Light, therefore listen to
me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.26 But
they stoned her; and the prophetess died, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
was said to her by the angels and Goddess after death, “Enter into
paradise.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.27 “O
that the people could know how merciful that Goddess has been to
me!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For She
has highly honored me!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.28 And
after the prophetess had died, it was to be that a dreadful disaster was
to come;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but there
was no prophetess to warn the inhabitants;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.29 and
with one blast of hot, torrential air from Evil; all the people utterly
perished.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.30 O,
the misery of women! No prophetess has come to them, but they laughed
her to scorn.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.31 Do
they not see how dangerous a place the earth is,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and how
many civilizations have been destroyed before them?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.32 No
person will return thereto; but all of them in general will have a day
of resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.33 One
sign of the resurrection is where you see barren land,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
heaven sends down rain and livens the earth once again,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
various sorts of grain are produced, of which the people may eat.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.34 And
we make on the earth gardens of palm trees and vines;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
cause springs of fresh water to gush forth in the gardens of palm trees
and vines;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.35
that the people may eat of the fruits produced thereby, and of the labor
of their hands.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Will they
not therefore give thanks to Her?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.36
Praise be to Her who has created all the different kinds of
produce,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">both of
vegetables,<a href="#_ftn103" id="_ftnref103"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

which the earth brings forth, and of their own species, by
reproducing,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and all
sorts of miracles which they do not understand the source of.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.37 The
night also is a sign to them; we withdraw the day from the same, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
behold they are covered with darkness for rest;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.38 and
the sun hastens to a place of rest. This is the disposition of the
mighty one, the Wise Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.39 And
for the moon we have appointed certain
mansions,<a href="#_ftn104" id="_ftnref104"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until it
changes and returns to be like the branch of a palm tree.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.40 It
is not expedient that the sun should overtake the moon in orbit;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor does
the night outstrip the day; but each of the luminaries moves in a
peculiar orbit.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.41 It
is a sign also to them, that we carried their offspring in an ark safely
through the flood;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.42 and
that we have made for them other conveniences like it, whereon they
ride.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.43 but
only evil tells them, “If the angels pleased, they would drown you
all,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and no
one would help you, nor would you be delivered,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.44
except Evil would help, but only for a season.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
incorrect, for the angels and Goddess do not seek the destruction of
anyone.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.45
When it is said to the people, “Fear that which is before you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
which is behind you,” this is incorrect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>With Goddess you need not fear anything.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You will
always obtain mercy from your Lady of Light whenever you request
it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.46 And
you do not bring them but one sign, out of the many signs of the Lady of
Light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
turn aside from the same.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.47 And
when it is said to them, “Give alms out of that which Goddess has
granted you; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
unbelievers say to those that believe, by mocking them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Shall we
feed those whom Goddess could very well feed, if Goddess wanted to?<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
this is none other than obvious error.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.48 And
they say, “When will this promise of the resurrection be fulfilled, if
you speak the truth?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.49
They only wait for one sounding of the trumpet,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
shall overtake them while they are engaging in fruitless debates;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.50 and
they shall not have time to make any final disposition of their effects,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor shall
they return to their family.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.51 And
the trumpet will be sounded again, and behold,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the dead
shall appear to the living, as if they came out of their graves, but
they did not; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they came
out from behind the veil, and all will hasten to their Lady of
Light!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.52 The
unbelievers will say, “Alas for us! We see the suffering we have caused
others.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
what the Merciful One promised us, and Her prophetesses spoke the
truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.53 It
shall be but one sound of the trumpet </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and all
souls shall be assembled together before the Lady of Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.54 On
this day, no soul shall be unjustly treated in the least;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor shall
any be rewarded that wrought evil on the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but each
will be shown what they have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.55 On
this day the inhabitants of paradise will be filled with joy;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.56
they and their husbands will rest in shady groves, leaning on
magnificent couches.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.57
There they shall have fruit, and they shall obtain whatever they shall
desire.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.58
Peace will be the word spoken to the righteous, by a Merciful
Lady.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.59 But
She shall say to the wicked, “Do not fear, but you will be separated
from the believers, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
we will purify you, and it will be painless.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.60
“For you were all commanded, O daughters of Eve, that you should not
worship Evil;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
this was hateful to you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.61
"And did I not say to you, ‘Worship Me;’ this is the right way?”</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.62
“But now Evil seduced a great multitude of you; did you not
understand?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.63
“For now you see that life on earth was like Hell; that was the true
place that you were promised,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
was only a place to learn and to grow in paths of love.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.64
“You were cast many times back to that place, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
felt like burning flesh, for that is the demise of the
unbeliever.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.65 “On
this day, you need not defend yourself, nor do you need to use your
hands to speak to us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
your feet betray you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.66
“Only Evil tells you, ‘If Goddess pleased, She would put out your
eyes,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will run in the wild manner that you were used to on earth’,” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
believed Evil, then this is another obvious error because you were
clearly told </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
is all love and She does not punish, She only disciplines.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.67 And
Evil will also say to you, “If we pleased, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we could
transform the unbelievers into hideous shapes in any place they were
found;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will not be able to depart; nor will we let them repent.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But this
is certainly not the case, for Goddess does not make souls into</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">hideous
shapes to terrorize them, nor does She ever keep any soul from
repenting,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
repentance is what She hopes for and loves dearly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Again you
believe Evil over what Goddess has commanded. What good does that do
you?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.68 To
all the righteous souls that desire it, they are granted a long
life;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though their bodies may be cast down at an elderly age. Do not the
people understand?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.69 We
have not taught the prophetess the art of poetry;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor is it
easy for her to be a poet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>A true
poet has great talents and abilities to entertain the people; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">rather
the prophetess is a bearer of love from Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and one
who recites the easily understood Korana;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.70
that She may bring love and good tidings to the living;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
judgment at the time of resurrection will be justly executed on the
unbelievers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.71 Do
the people not consider that we have created for them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">among
what our hands have wrought, cattle of various kinds, of which they
possess; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.72 and
we have also put cattle in submission to them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.73
Some cattle are for riding; and some are to eat; and they will receive
other advantages from cattle;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
drink the milk of cows. Will they not therefore be thankful to
Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.74
They have worshiped idols of greed, power and wealth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in the
hopes that they may be assisted by them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.75 but
these idols are of no assistance upon death, yet the unbelievers defend
their worship of them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.76 Do
not let their talk grieve any prophetess, we know what they privately
conceal,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
which they publicly disclose.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.77
Does not woman know that we have created her from a one celled
ovum?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet
behold, many people openly dispute against the resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.78 and
the unbelievers propound to us comparisons, and they forget their false
idols.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She says,
“Who can restore bones to life, when they have rotted?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">36.79
Answer them, “She shall restore them to life, for She created them the
first time;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is skilled in every kind of creation.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.5 She
is the Lady of heaven and of earth, and of whatever is between them, and
the Lady of the east.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.6 We
have adorned the lower heaven with ornamentation of stars;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

we have placed therein a guard against every rebellious devil;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.8 that
they may not listen to the discussions of angels;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.9 for
they are darted at from every side, to repel them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.10
except someone that catches a word by stealth, but then is pursued by a
shining flame.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.11 Ask
your enemies therefore, whether they are stronger by nature,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or are
the angels, whom we have created? We have surely created them of
magnificent divine sparks.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.12 You
wonder at the power of Goddess and their obstinacy;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
mock at the arguments urged to convince them of faith;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.13
when they are warned, they do not listen;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.14 and
when they see any sign or miracle, they scoff at it;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.15 and
they say, “This is none other than manifest dark magic;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.16
“after we are dead, and we are dust and bones, will we really be raised

“and our ancestors also?”</span>

themselves raised,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.20 and
they shall say, “Alas for us!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>This is the day of judgment, which did come;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.21 it

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.22
Gather together those who have acted unjustly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
friends, and the idols of wealth, greed and power, which they
worshiped,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.23
besides Goddess, and direct them back to the earth, which shall seem
like Hell;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.24 and
set them before the tribunal of Goddess; for they will be called to
account,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.25
then what will be the matter that you will not defend one
another?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.26 But
on this day, they shall submit themselves to Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.27 and
they shall draw near to one another, and shall dispute among
themselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.28 And
the seduced shall say to those who seduced them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly
you came to us with promises of prosperity,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.29 and
the seducers shall answer them, “No, it is just that you were not true
believers,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.30
“for we had no true power over you; but you were people who desired to
err;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.31
“therefore, the Lady of Light had instructed us; and we shall surely be
returned to earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
shall feel like severe vengeance, but Goddess does not avenge, She only
disciplines.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.32 “We
seduced you; but we also greatly erred ourselves.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.33
They shall both therefore be made to partake of the same banishment to
earth on that same day.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.34
This is how Goddess deals with the wicked; they are either returned to
earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or at the
final resurrection, they will be purified without harm or fear, by Her
pure light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.35
Before, when it was said to them, “There is no goddess besides the One
True Goddess,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
swelled with arrogance</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.36 and
they said, “Shall we abandon our idols of wealth, greed and power for an
insane poet?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.37 No,
the prophetess comes with the truth, and she bears witness to all former
prophetesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
were many that came before, and there are still many to come, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess does not abandon Her people ever.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.38 You
shall live again on the earth, which shall seem like a painful torment
of Hell;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.39 and
you shall not be rewarded for you have no good works.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.40 But
as for the sincere servants of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.41
they shall have an abundant provision in paradise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.42
namely, delicious fruits; and they shall be honored,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.43
they shall be placed in gardens of pleasure,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.44
leaning on couches, facing one another;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.45 a
cup shall be carried around to them, filled from a gushing
fountain;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.46 for
the delight of those who drink;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.47 it
shall not cloud the understanding, nor shall anyone be inebriated
thereby.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.48 And
near them shall lie the virgin men of paradise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">refraining
their looks from beholding any except their spouses, having large black
eyes,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.49 and
resembling the color of the eggs of an ostrich covered with
feathers,<a href="#_ftn108" id="_ftnref108"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.50 and
they shall turn to one another and ask one another questions.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.51 And
one of them will say, “Certainly I had an intimate friend while I walked
the earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.52 who
had said to me, ‘Are you one of those who says that the miracle of the
resurrection is true?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.53
Then after we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will we be
judged?’”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.54
Then she will say to her companions, “Will you look down?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.55 and
they will look down, and shall see her former friends in the midst of
sadness, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">grieving
for all the good each one of them might have done;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.56 and
she shall say to her friends, “By Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it was
not by much that I would have met the same fate, for you were tempting
me to do evil with you,” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.57
“and had it not been for the grace of my Lady of Light, I would surely
have been </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">one of
those who are now suffering great sadness on the day of their
resurrection.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.58
Will we die any</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.59
other than one death; for do we suffer from sadness and grief for what
we have done?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.60
Certainly, there is a great happiness for some;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.61 for
attaining such pure joy and happiness such as this, let the laborers
labor strenuously.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.62 Is
this a better situation, or should one visit the tree of al
Zakkum?<a href="#_ftn109" id="_ftnref109"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.63
Certainly this is all a great amount of subject matter for dispute by
the unrighteous.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.64 For
the Zakkum tree is a tree that belongs in the worst place on
earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.65 the
fruit of it resembles the heads of little demons;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.66 and
the grief experienced by the unbelievers shall be the same as eating
such fruits, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
fill up one’s belly, is similar to filling up with the negativity that
the unbelievers preach.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.67 and
the worst drink on earth, is filthy boiled water;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.68
after the unjust have reviewed what they have done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they are
returned to earth, as innocent, ignorant babies.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.69
Many people found their mothers going astray, preaching hate and
negativity, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.70 and
they hastily walked right in their footsteps;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.71 for
the vast majority of the ancients did so before them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.72 And
we sent preachers and teachers to them before;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.73 and
see how miserable was the demise of those who</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">had a
prophetess, but did not listen, and then disaster struck.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.74 The
believers were all saved, but unbelievers were not.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.75
Nora called upon the angels in former times; and we heard her
graciously;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.76 and
we delivered her and her family out of great distress;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.77 and
we caused her offspring to be those persons that survived to inherit the
earth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.78 and
we left the following salutation to be granted to her, by all posterity,
namely, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.79
“Peace be upon Nora of all creatures!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.80
Thus do we reward the righteous;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.81 for
she was one of our servants which was a true believer.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.82 And
the floods came, and the unbelievers drowned, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they would not listen to their prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.83
Sarah also was of the true religion;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.84
because she came to her Lady of Light with a pure heart.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.85
When she said to her mother and her people, “What are you
worshiping?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.86 Do
you choose the false goddesses of all the earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">goddesses
of wealth, power, greed and self centeredness?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.87
What therefore is your opinion of the Lady of Light, creatress of all
creatures?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.88 And
she looked up above at the stars,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.89 and
she said, “Certainly I will be sick, and I cannot condone the
sacrificing of innocent animals.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.90 And
they looked at her askance, turned their backs to her and walked
away.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.91 And
Sarah went privately to the gold idols they had created</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
represented wealth, power, greed and self centeredness, and said to
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Do you
not eat of the meat of innocent creatures which is set before
you?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.92
“What ails you that you do not speak?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.93 And
she turned upon them, and by a mere touch of her hand they
disintegrated, as if by a miracle.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.94 And
the people came to her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.95 And
she said, “Do you worship images which show your love</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of
wealth, power, greed and self centeredness? What good is there in doing
this?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.96
“Despite the fact it is Goddess that made you? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And that
She has commanded you to love one another over wealth, power and
greed?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.97
They said, “Build a pyre for her, and we will throw her into the
fire.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.98 And
they contrived a scheme against her, but we saved her and delivered her
from death.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.99 And
Sarah said, “Certainly I am only returning to my Lady of Light, and She
will direct me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.100
She prayed, “O Lady of Light, grant me a righteous daughter.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.101
Therefore, we told her that she will have a daughter, who will be a
strong and good child.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.102
And when she had become an adolescent, and could join in religious
services with her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Sarah
said to her, “O my daughter, certainly I saw in a dream that I should
offer you in a sacrifice;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">surely it
is Evil that has come to me, advise me as to what your opinion is that I
should do.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.103
She answered, “O my mother, do only what you have been commanded,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
heaven never commands violence, but you will find me, if Goddess
pleases, a very patient person.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.104
And we cried to her, “O Sarah,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.105
“We have not commanded you to commit violence,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we would
never do that, although we do appreciate the fact</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.106
that you would sacrifice your own daughter to Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet you
must never, ever do such a thing, or even think of it!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.107
Only Evil commands sacrifices of people and animals.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.108
And for her error, she sacrificed much food to the poor, in the form of
a ram, a noble victim.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.109
And for her worry and concern to avoid violence,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
what was right, we rewarded her with the salutation of good and loving
posterity,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.110
“Peace be upon Sarah!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.111
Thus do we reward the righteous;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.112
for she was one of our faithful servants.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.113
and we blessed her and Iris; and of their daughters were many righteous
women;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but only
a few that injured their own souls.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.114 We
were also gracious to Miriam and Alana before this;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.115
and we delivered them and their people from great distress;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.116
And we assisted them against the Egyptians; and they became the
conquerors.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.117
And we gave them the easily understood Book of the Law,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.118
and we directed them to the right religious way;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.119
and we left the following salutation to be bestowed on them, by all
posterity, namely, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.120
“Peace be upon Miriam and Alana!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.121
Thus do we reward the righteous;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.122
for they were two of our faithful servants.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.123
And
Elana<a href="#_ftn110" id="_ftnref110"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

also one of those who were sent by us.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.124
When she said to her people, “Do you not have love for Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.125 Do
you pray to false goddesses of wealth, greed, power and self
centeredness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
forsake the One True Creatress?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.126
Because Goddess is your Lady of Light and the Lady of your
foremothers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.127
But they accused her of lying; therefore they will see much sadness on
the day of their resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.128
and the only ones to escape the great sadness will be the servants of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.129
And we bestowed the following salutation on the prophetess by her
posterity, namely,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.130
“Peace be upon Elana!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.131
Thus does heaven reward the righteous;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.132
for she was one of our faithful servants.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.133
And Wileh was also one of those that were sent by us.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.134
When we delivered her and her whole family,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.135
except an old man, who was a troublesome and violent husband,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who
perished together with the violent ones left behind;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.136
afterwards the others were destroyed because they </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">did not
listen to their prophetess concerning an impending disaster.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.137
and you pass by many ruins during the day,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.138
and by night. Will any of you not understand?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.139
Joanie was also one of those that were sent by heaven.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.140
When she fled into a loaded ship;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.141
and those who were on board cast lots among themselves, and she was
thrown overboard;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.142
and the fish swallowed her whole; for she was in need of additional
tribulations.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.143
and because she was one of those that would not praise Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.144
Certainly, she might have remained in the belly of the fish, until the
day of her resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.145
and we cast her on the shore; and she was sick;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.146
and we caused a plant of a gourd to grow up over her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.147
and we sent her to a hundred thousand persons, or there was even a
greater number;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.148
and she caused them to believe; therefore she enjoyed life for another
season.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.149
Inquire of some people whether the Lady has sons; but then they only
appreciate loving daughters?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.150 Do
we create angels of just the male sex? Certainly not.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Have they
not seen any male angels come to them?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Are they sure?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Angels do
not incarnate and suffer childbirth, as human women do.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.151
Are they not saying this of their own false imagination?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.152
Has Goddess born a child? Did She incarnate and give birth?<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Of course not!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.153
Would She have chosen sons in preference to daughters? Of course
not!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.154
Will the people not understand this?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.155
You have no reason to think this is possible or probable.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.156 Or
do you have obvious proof of what you claim?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.157
Then produce your Book of revelations, if you speak the truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.158
And some make the children of Goddess to be kin to the angels or genii,
the fierce and haughty;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but even
the genii know this is not possible.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.159
Far be it from Goddess, what they claim of Her!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.160
Certainly the sincere servants of Goddess do not claim this, that She
has given birth to sons,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
these children are in some manner different from the people, who are all
her children.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.161
Moreover, you know that what you worship,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.162
will not seduce any one concerning Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.163
except those that will experience great sadness on the day of their
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.164
There is not one of the light entities that does not have an appointed
place for them in heaven;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.165 we
will one day arrange ourselves in order, according to the commands of
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.166
and we one day will celebrate the divine praise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.167
The unbelievers will say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.168
“If we had been given a Book of divine revelations, similar to what was
given to the ancients,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.169
“we would have most certainly been sincere servants of Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.170
Yet now that the Korana has been revealed, still most refuse to believe
in it;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but after
this, on the day of their resurrection, they will see great
sadness.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.171
Our word formerly has been give to our servants and the
prophetesses;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.172
that they will certainly be assisted in ministering to the
unbelievers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.173
and our nonviolent, peaceful armies should surely be the victors.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.174
Turn aside from the unbelievers, yet be patient and polite with
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for you
are not to judge them, only Goddess is, and She is merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.175
And everyone will see many natural disasters on this earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
may afflict them, but the believers will see future success and
prosperity.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.176
Some people want vengeance to be hastened to the world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
is the product of a wicked imagination;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
neither heaven nor your Goddess has such negative human emotion like
vengeance, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
an emotion known only to people.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.177
Certainly when the day of resurrection will descend into the courts of
the unbelievers, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a very
sad morning it will be for those that were told to believe and do good
works, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
talk was all in vain for them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.178
Turn aside from wickedness for a season;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.179
and see how blessed it feels to remove the yoke of evil from your
throats.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.180
All praise be to the Lady of Light; the Lady who is far exalted above
all others!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.181
And peace be upon Her prophetesses!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">37.182
And all praise be unto Goddess, The Lady of all Creatures!</span>

Certainly the unbelievers are addicted to pride and contention.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.3 How
many generations have been destroyed by natural causes before
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
cried for mercy, but there was no time to escape, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they had not listened to their prophetesses, which foretold of the
disaster.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.4 They
wonder that a preacher from among themselves has come to them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And the
unbelievers say, “This woman is a sorcerer and a liar,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.5 Does
she affirm that all of our goddesses of wealth, power, greed and self
centeredness </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to be
just one goddess of pure light an dlove? Surely this is a strange
thing.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.6 And
the chief women among them departed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying to
one another, “Go, and persevere in the worship of your goddess </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.8 But
was not a message sent down to them, preferable to any other people on
the earth?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But they
do not seem to take the grief of the last day seriously.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

the treasures of the mercy of your Lady of Light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
Almighty, the Magnificent Goddess, in their hands?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.10 Is
the Queendom of heaven, and the earth, and of whatever is between them,
in their possession?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If this

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.11 But
the nonviolent armies of friends and peacemakers will be put to the test
even more.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.12 The
people of Nora, and the tribe of Ada, and Pharaoh,</span>

were all put to flight as a result.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.13 As
were the tribe of Thelma, and the people of Wileh, and the inhabitants
of the wood near Marian,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they all
accused their prophetess of lying;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.14
these were the peoples that stood against Goddess. They all accused the
prophetesses of lying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so
they will see the grief they caused others on the day of their
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.15 And
these people will wait only for one sounding of the trumpet,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
final day of their resurrection; which may not be deferred by
anyone.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.16 And
some people will scoffingly say, “O Lady of Light, hasten our sentence
of vengeance to us </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">before
the day of our final resurrection to You.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But She
waits with patience, for they have been told She has no vengeance, this
is a base human emotion.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.17 You
will need to be very patient with what they say; and remind them of our
servant Denise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who was
endued with strength, for she was one of those that turned her entire
heart towards Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.18 We
compelled the mountains to celebrate our praise with Her, in the evening
and at sunrise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.19 and
also the birds, which gathered themselves for Her; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">all of
them returned frequently to Her for this purpose.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.20 And
we established a Queendom for her, and we gave her wisdom and eloquent
speech.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.21 Has
not the story of the two adversaries come to you?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

rooms of a home.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But they
said, “Fear not; we are two adversaries who have a controversy to be
decided by you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The one
had wronged the other, therefore, please instruct us all properly with
truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not be unjust; and direct us to the right path.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.23
This is my sister and she had ninety-nine sheep; and I had only one ewe;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
said, “Give her to me to keep for you;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
prevailed over me in the discussion we had regarding this matter.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.24
Denise answered, “Certainly she had wronged you </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
demanding your ewe as an addition to her own sheep which were quite
numerous;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and many
people in business wrong one another in their transactions,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
those who believe and do what is right; but how few are such
people!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Denise perceived that we had tried her by this parable, and she asked
pardon of her Lady of Light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
fell down and repented of all she had done wrong in business and
otherwise.<a href="#_ftn115" id="_ftnref115"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

approach near to us;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
shall have an excellent place of abode in heaven.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.26 O
Denise, certainly we have appointed you as a sovereign princess on the
earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">judge
therefore between women and men with truth; and do not follow your own
desires,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">less this
causes you to err from the ways of Goddess; for those who err from the
ways of Goddess</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall
suffer great grief on the day of their resurrection, when they see all
the pain they caused others,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they have feared the day of their day of resurrection, when there is
nothing to fear if you believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.27 We
have not created the heavens and the earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whatever is in between them, for only vain purposes. This is the opinion
of the unbelievers;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
sadness will be upon those who will not believe on the day of their
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.28
Shall we deal with those who believe and do good works</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in the
same manner as those that are wicked, hasty and expedient?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.29 A
blessed Book has been sent down to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">O
prophetess, that you may attentively meditate on the signs and miracles
therein, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
women of understanding may be shown the love of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.30 And
we gave to Denise and Salome what was necessary to be an excellent
servant to Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
frequently turned to Goddess for what they needed in life.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.31
When the horses stood on three feet, and touched the edge of the ground
with their fourth foot,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
were swift in their courses, we had set in motion this lesson in the
evening,<a href="#_ftn116" id="_ftnref116"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.32 She
said, “Certainly I have loved the love of earthly goods </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">above the
remembrance of my Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
have spent the time in watching these horses, until the sun was hidden
by the veil of night;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.33
bring the horses back to me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.34 And
all the horses were brought back to her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she
remembered the many people that labored in the fields and
elsewhere,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
beasts of burden, and she directed Her staff to find good,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">hardworking
people that could use a good horse and to give the horse to such a
person, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">one to a
family, to make their burdens on earth easier.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.35 We
also tried Salome, and placed on her throne an android body;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
afterwards she turned to Goddess, and said, “O Lady of Light, forgive
me, and give me a queendom</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
not falsely obtained by anyone else; for you are the giver of
queendoms.<a href="#_ftn117" id="_ftnref117"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.36 And
we made even the wind subject to her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it ran
gently at her command; wherever she directed it to go, it went.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.37 We
also put the haughty and strong genii in subjection under her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and among
them there was every skilled trade, both in building and in diving for
pearls; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.38<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>and other wicked ones, we delivered to
her in chains,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.39
saying “This is our gift; therefore be bounteous, or be sparing to those
you believe fit,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
render an accounting to us.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.40 And
she shall approach near to us, and shall have an excellent abode in
heaven.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.41 And
remember our servant Joan, when she cried to her Lady of Light,
saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly
evil has afflicted me with great calamity and pain.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.42 It
was said to her, “Strike the earth with your foot;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which,
when she did, a fountain sprang up and it was said to her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This is
for you to wash in, to refresh you, and to drink.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.43 And
we restored her to her family, and an even greater number of people,
through our mercy;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and as a
direction to those who are endued with understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.44 And
Evil said to her, coming to her in a dream, “Take a handful of rods in
your hand,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
strike your husband with it, and do not break your
promises.”<a href="#_ftn118" id="_ftnref118"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But Joan
knew that Goddess did not condone violence,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She was
all love and would never command such a thing; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
instead she divorced her husband when she recovered, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
he left the house and her wealth, he joined a band of robbers, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and was
then beaten 100 times and
died.<a href="#_ftn119" id="_ftnref119"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">all of
whom were strong women and prudent.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.46
Certainly we purified them with perfect purification through the
remembrance of the life to come;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.47 and
they were in our sight, upright and good women.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.48
Remember Emma and Elisha and
Duaa,<a href="#_ftn120" id="_ftnref120"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

these three were good women.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.49
This is a reminder and divine instruction.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
the pious will have an excellent place to return home to.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.50
Namely, they shall have gardens of perpetual abode, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the gate
of which will stand open forever to them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.51 As
they lie down in these gardens, they may ask for many types of fruits,
and for delicious drinks,</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.52<span

male virgins of paradise,</span>

these lovely young men refraining from looking at any other women,
besides their spouses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

This is a heavenly provision, which will not fail.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.55
This shall be the reward of the righteous. But for the transgressors is
prepared a day of sadness.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.56
Until the final day of resurrection, when the trumpet shall sound, they
will return to earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
will be like hell; there they will feel difficulties like burning
fire,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

uncomfortable couch it will be for them!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.57
This they will taste, for on earth there is filthy boiled water, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
corruption abounds at every corner, from the unbelievers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.58 and
there are similar torments all around.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.59 And
it shall be said to the seducers, “This troop which was guided by you,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will
forever be reborn to earth, until the final judgment day, and this will
be hell for you all;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for earth
bids no one welcome, and the only greeting is like scorching
fire.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.60 And
the seduced, shall say to their seducers; “Certainly you will not be
welcomed there;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
have misled us; and the earth is like miserable hell for us
also.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.61
They will say, “O Lady of Light, we desire the seducers to have double
the torment</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that we
will have on earth.” Yet She hears no requests for torment; She is all
love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.62 And
the unbelievers will say, “Why do not we see the people who we numbered
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">together
with the wicked, and those that we scorned? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And where
is hell, a burning punishment they told us about?”</span>

our eyes miss them?”</span>

“Certainly this is the truth, where the perpetual inhabitants of earth
dispute that hell is real</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
those that know that Goddess is pure love.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.65 Say
to them, O prophetess, “Certainly the truth is that I was no more than a
preacher and a teacher;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
is no goddess of greed, wealth or power,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there is
only the One True Goddess and She is made from pure love, She is the
Almighty, the Loving One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.66 the
Lady of the heavens and earth, and whatever is between them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
Mighty Breasted One, the Forgiver of Sins and Errors.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.67 Say
this is a message of great importance;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.68 and
you are turning away from it;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.69 I
had no knowledge of the exalted princes, when they disputed concerning
the creation of woman;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.70
This was only revealed to me as proof that I am a plain public teacher
and preacher;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.71
when the Lady of Light said to the angels, “Certainly I am about to
create people </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from a
divine spark, ova and minerals from the earth;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.72
“and when I have formed this, and I have breathed my spirit into
this,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will you
fall down and worship her?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.73 And
all the angels worshiped her, in general,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.74
except Eblis, who was full of pride, and he was an unbeliever in the
good works of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.75
Goddess said to him, “O Eblis, what prevents you from worshiping what I
have created,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with My
own hands? Are you elated with vain pride? Or are you really one with
exalted merit?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.76 He
replied, “I am more excellent than this creation; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You have
created me from a divine spark full of fire,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and You
have created this from a small divine spark, water and minerals from the
earth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.77
Goddess said to him, “Then you must leave paradise, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for you
are driven away by your own lack of mercy, kindness and
compassion,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.78
“but I will not take part, in any Evil that you create, together with
the unbelievers.”<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span></span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.79<span

respite, until the day of final resurrection.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.80
Goddess replied, “I will grant you respite,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.81
“until the final day of resurrection.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.82
Eblis said, “By Your might, I swear, I will attempt to seduce those that
are unbelievers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not love You;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.83
“except those servants who worship You.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.84
Goddess replied, “This is a fair situation; and I speak the truth.”<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and You
may have the good ones, because the believers will be of no use to
me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">38.86 Say
to the people, “I do not ask any person for any reward for my preaching
and teaching;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In the
name of the most Merciful Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.1 The
revelation of this perfect Book is from the Almighty One, the Wise
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.2
Certainly we have revealed this Book to you all with truth; therefore
serve Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">showing
the pure religion to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.3
Should not the pure religion be reflected back to Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But as to
those that take other goddesses besides Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
negative goddesses of wealth, power, greed and self centeredness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying
“We worship these that they bring us only closer to Goddess,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">no such
negative worship brings them closer to Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
Goddess will instruct everyone properly concerning issues that they now
disagree on.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Surely
Goddess does not direct the liars or the ungrateful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.4 If
Goddess decided to have a daughter, She would have descended to earth
and given birth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but She
does not incarnate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>She is able
to create from paradise! She is the sole, the Almighty Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.5 She
has created the heavens and the earth with truth; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
causes the night to succeed the day,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
causes the day to succeed the night, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
obliges the sun and the moon to perform services for women;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">each of
them hasten to an appointed course and time. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It is not
She the Almighty, the Forgiver of Sins and Errors?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.6 She
has created people of one divine spark, and afterwards she was joined
with her husband;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has bestowed on you pairs of cattle. She formed you in the uterus of you
mothers,</span>

Her Queendom; there is no Goddess but She. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Why
therefore are you turned aside from the worship of Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
pure light and love, to idols of hate, greed and violence?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.7 If
you are ungrateful, certainly Goddess has no need of that;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She does
not seek ingratitude in Her servants; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but if
you are thankful, She will be well pleased with you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">A
burdened soul does not bear the burdens of another; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">after
this you will return to your Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will declare to you all that you have wrought, and She will reward you
accordingly;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
knows the innermost parts of your hearts. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.8 When
harm comes to a woman, she calls upon her Lady of Light and turns to
Her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet
afterwards, when Goddess has bestowed upon her favors from
Herself,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she
forgets the divine source which she invoked before, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
sets up negative idols with Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that she
may seduce other women from the righteous way. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
such a woman, “Enjoy this life in infidelity for but a short
time,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but after
this you will surely be one of those that comes back to earth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.9
Shall she who gives herself up to prayer in the hours of the
night,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">prostrate
or standing or otherwise, and she who takes seriously the life to
come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and hopes
for mercy from the Lady of Light, which she knows is certain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">be
treated the same as the wicked unbeliever? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
the people, “Will those that perform their duty to Goddess, and those
that stray be held equal?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
the women of understanding will heed what is said to them.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.10 Say
to the people, “O my servants who believe, love your Lady of Light with
all your heart.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Those who
do good in this world, will obtain goodness in the next, and Goddess’
earth is spacious.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
those that persevere with patience shall receive their compensation
without measure.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.11 Say
to the people, “I am commanded to worship Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

show the pure religion to her who will listen;”</span>

“and I am commanded to be the first Moselma.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

to the people, “Certainly I fear, if I am disobedient to my Lady of
Light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that I
will be grief struck on the day of my resurrection.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.14 Say
to the people, “I worship Goddess, showing that my religion is pure to
the people;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.15 but
you worship all sorts of negative entities besides Her.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
the people, “Certainly they will be shown in the next life</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
have lost a great deal, for they have injured their own souls,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
families will not be with them on the day of their resurrection; is this
not a horrid loss?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.16
Over them shall be the roof of earth, or cloudy days,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
beneath them shall be the floor of earth or barren soil, or a floor of
dust.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">With
this, Goddess shows discipline to Her children.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.17 But
those that eschew the worshiping of negative idols </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of
wealth, greed, power and self centeredness, and those that are turned to
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall
receive good tidings and Her Love. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore,
the faithful should bear good tidings to Her servants.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.18 For
they hearken to My word, and they follow that which is most
excellent;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">these are
the servants that Goddess directs, and these are women of
understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.19 For
her, therefore, on whom the discipline of eternal rebirth upon earth is
destined,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this will
be like hell for them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.20 But
for those that Love Goddess, there will be prepared high apartments and
mansions in paradise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">over
which there shall be other apartments built; and rivers shall run
beneath them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
the promise of Goddess, and Goddess will not be contrary to Her
promises.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.21 Do
you not see that Goddess sends down water from heaven,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
causes the same to enter and form sources in the earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
produces therewith grain of many varieties?<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Afterwards
She causes the same to wither at the end of a season; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
see that the plant turns to yellow; afterwards, She makes it crumble
into dust.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
here is an instruction to people of understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.22
Shall she, therefore, whose heart Goddess has softened to receive the
religion of Islama, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
follows the light from her Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">be
treated the same as a person who has hardened their own heart and turns
away from love?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
sadness will come to those whose hearts are hardened against the
remembrance of Goddess!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They are
steeped in obvious error.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.23
Goddess has revealed a most excellent instruction;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a Book
conformable to itself, and it contains repeated statements and paths of
love to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The skins
of those who love the Lady of Light shall not wrinkle, nor will their
thoughts age with them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">afterwards,
their skin grows soft and their hearts also, at the remembrance of their
Lady of Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
the direction of Goddess; She directs only those that seek Her and pray
to Her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that do not worship Her, will not have any protectress.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.24
Shall the person who averts her eyes from what She has done</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">be
treated the same as one who does not need to do so?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.25
Those persons who came before them accused the prophetesses of lying;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
they hardened their own hearts;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and least
did they know that they would return to earth, which would be like hell
for them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.26 And
Goddess showed them the shame of their prior life;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
subsequent rebirth on earth without angels or a protectress,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will
indeed be an immense difficulty to them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If they
were women of understanding, they would know this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.27 Now
in this Korana, we have provided every type of parable;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that all
women may be forewarned;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.28 an
English Korana, which almost all the world can read now, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or it is
easily translatable into all languages,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and which
there is nothing askance, so that all may truly love Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.29
Goddess shows as a parable, a woman that has numerous negative idols
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">such as
wealth, greed, power and self centeredness, all of which are at mutual
variance,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and a
woman that commits herself only to Love, that is the divine love from
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">would
these be held in equal comparison?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Goddess forbid!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.30
Certainly you, O prophetess, will die, and assuredly all the people in
the world will also die;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.31 and
you may debate these matters here, but on the day of resurrection for
each person,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there the
debate will end and you all will be shown the obvious truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.32 Who
is more unjust than a person who utters lies against Goddess</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and says
that Her companions are negative human emotions, even after the truth
has come to Her?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.33 But
she who brings the truth to others, and gives credit where credit is
due,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">these are
those that truly love Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.34 and
they shall obtain whatever they desire in the sight of their Lady of
Light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
shall be compensation for the righteous;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.35
that Goddess may extract them from the very worst of what they have
done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
may provide them a reward from only the best that they have
accomplished.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.36 Is
Goddess not a sufficient protectress of Her servants?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet many
will attempt to make you afraid of the false and negative idols</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
they worship besides Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But she
who refuses to turn to Goddess, will assuredly err, and will have no one
to direct her;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.37 and
anyone that has Goddess to direct her, will have no one to mislead
her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Is not
Goddess the most Almighty, the most able to love infinitely?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.38 If
you ask the people who has created the heavens and the earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
assuredly answer, “Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
them, “Do you think, therefore, that the negative deities you
worship,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">besides
Goddess, will be able to help you, if you are afflicted with a disease
or condition?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Or will
they withhold mercy when you ask for it from them?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
them, “Goddess is my best support; in Her let the people put their
trust,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
should seek Her only to confide in.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.39
Say, “O my people, do you act according to your state of mind?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
is all love, and always acts out of love. Hereafter you shall find out
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.40<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>that apart from Goddess, you will
suffer great sadness on the day of your resurrection.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.41
Certainly we have revealed to you the Book of the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
instruction of womankind, with truth. Whomever shall be directed
thereby,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall be
directed to the advantage of her own soul;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whomsoever shall err, will only err against their own soul.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.42
Goddess Herself takes the souls of women at the time of their
death;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
which do not die, but are merely asleep, she holds;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
keeps some souls on earth for a period of time longer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when it
has been determined that it was not yet their time to die, and they are
sent back.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
here are signs for a people who will consider.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.43
Have the
Koreish<a href="#_ftn123" id="_ftnref123"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">[123]</span></span></span></span></a>
taken false negative goddesses for intercessors with Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Ask them
if wealth, greed, power and violence can help them if they are sick, or
afflicted with a condition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>For
these entities cannot help anyone with anything, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor do
they understand pain and suffering.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.44 Say
to these people, “Only Goddess will intercede with illness, grief, and
grant you peace, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is all compassionate and understanding. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Hers is
the Queendom of heaven and earth, and Hereafter you shall return to
Her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.45
When the One True Goddess is mentioned, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
hearts of those that do not believe in the life to come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shrink
away with horror; but when the false negative goddesses are
mentioned,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those of
wealth, power and greed, their self serving hearts are filled with
joy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.46 Say
to the people, “O Goddess, the creatress of heaven and earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Who knows
what is secret, and everything that is openly published;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You shall
inform us as between Your servants in all that they now
disagree.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.47 If
those that act unjustly were mistress of whatever is in the
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and as
much more therewith, certainly they would give it all away </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to avoid
the grief and sadness which they will encounter on the day of their
resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
shall appear to them, from Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even the
most horrible things that they have done, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
they might learn from this;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.48 and
they will see the evils of all that has occurred; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will see themselves mock the innocents,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and for
this they will grieve.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.49
When harm befalls a woman, she calls upon us;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
afterwards, when we have bestowed upon her favors from us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she says,
“I have received it merely due to Goddess’ knowledge of my
actions.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">On the
contrary, it is a trial and a learning experience; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
vast majority of people do not understand this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.50
Those who came before these people all said the same thing; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but that
which they gained, did not profit them at all;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.51 and
because they had no protectress and no prophetess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Evil came
to them and they fell into temptation.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
whomsoever of these people, who have acted unjustly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on them
likewise shall come to them trials which they have not necessarily
desired;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor shall
they frustrate the purpose of Goddess in assisting your soul’s
perfection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.52 Do
the people not know that Goddess bestows provisions and love on those
who call </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and pray
to Her?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Certainly this is a sign
to people who believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.53 Say
to the people, “O my servants who have injured your own souls,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">do not
despair at the mercy of Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess forgives all sins and errors, for She is gracious and merciful
to you all.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.54 And
be turned to your Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
resign yourselves to Her, for you will surely see your life on the day
of your resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
will not know when it will come.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.55 And
follow the most excellent instructions which have been</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">sent down
to you from your Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">before
you must view your life, and you are not ready to do this, for it would
be far too painful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.56 And
a soul might say, “Alas!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>For I
have been negligent in my</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">duty to
Goddess; certainly I have been one of those that vainly scorned
others.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.57 Or
they might say, “If only Goddess had directed me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
I would have been one of the pious;” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
despite the fact she had received the Scriptures and had not prayed to
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.58 Or
they might say, “When it appeared that my day of resurrection seemed
very near, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when I
thought of all the horrid things I had done and felt immense grief,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
return, but without guardian angels or a Protectress, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will not clearly remember their last life, being reborn as innocent
babies.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.59 But
Goddess will answer, “My signs and miracles came to you long ago,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
said they were nothing but lies, and that the prophetess was vainly
proud,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
became one of the unbelievers because you did not turn to Me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.60 On
the day of your resurrection, you shall see the faces of those </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that have
told lies concerning Goddess, and they will darken with grief;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
know what they are about to see is not pleasant.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.61 But
Goddess shall deliver those who love Her dearly, and She shall place
them in a secure position;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Evil will
not touch them, nor shall they be grieved.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.62 For
Goddess is the Creatress of all things, and She is the governess of all
things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.63
Hers are the keys of heaven and earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
people who do not believe in the signs and miracles of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
not enter into paradise, but will be reborn on earth, which is like
hell.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.64 Say
to the people, “Do you therefore welcome me to worship</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">your
false idols of wealth, greed, power and self centeredness, other than
Goddess, O you are such fools!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.65
Since it has been spoken by revelation to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and also
to the prophetesses who have come before you saying, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly
if you associate any negative qualities, emotions or actions with
Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">your work
will be unprofitable, and you will be greatly saddened on the day of
your resurrection.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.66
Therefore, you should love Goddess with all your heart and soul,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and be
one of those that give thanks to a kindly Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.67 But
those that do not assess Goddess properly, for the entire world is in
Her loving hands,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of resurrection, the heavens will roll up into Her right
hand.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">All
praise be to Her!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And far be it
from Her that She is associated with any negative qualities, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">actions
or emotions which the unbelievers assign to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.68 The
trumpet will sound, and whomever is in heaven,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whomever is on earth, shall be raised up to assemble before
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
believers will be raised up to a special exalted place.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Afterwards
the trumpet will make a sound once again,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
behold the unbelievers shall arise and look up.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.69 And
the earth will shine only by the light of the Lady;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
review of each person will then be seen by them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
prophetesses and the martyrs will be brought forward,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
Lady will inform them of everything they had done with truth, and no one
will be treated unjustly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.70 And
every soul shall be fully rewarded, according to exactly what she has
done; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
perfectly understands everything regarding what a soul has done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.71 And
the unbelievers will be driven to a special place by troops of
angels,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until,
when they shall arrive at their special place, the gates for them will
open;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
angels will say to them; “You were told that the Lady of Light was all
love;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and Her
signs were shown to you; and you were also told that one day you might
be purified,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
properly ascend into Her realm; and this you were promised,
correct?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And they
will answer in the affirmative, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
and there they will be purified with the Light of Her Love, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it will
not burn and it will not be fearsome.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.72 It
will be said to them all, “Stand here for awhile, and you shall feel the
pure bliss and joy</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that the
righteous have felt for many generations, when they ascended into
paradise;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so
now your abode will be just as wonderful!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.73 But
those who shall have feared their Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and told
others to do so, will understand that this was not correct,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
misled others and aided and abetted grief.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
believers in love; however, will be led by troops of angels back into
paradise,</span>

open;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.74 And
the believers will answer, “All Praise be to Goddess!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She has
kept Her promise in a most excellent fashion, and we have inherited Her
Queendom,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
we may dwell in paradise wherever we please!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

excellent is the reward of those who work righteousness!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">39.75 And
you shall see the angels going in procession around the throne,</span>

the praises of their Lady of Light; </span>
