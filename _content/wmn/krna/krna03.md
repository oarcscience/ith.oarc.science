affliction,</span>

<span

continues upon her former course of life, as though she had not called

another,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">despite
the fact that prophetesses had come to them before with evident
miracles, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
had warned them of the disaster which was to come and told them what to
do,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
because she preached only love and tolerance no one would believe</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
hence many were destroyed out of their own stubbornness and hardness of
their hearts.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">10.14 We
have caused many people to succeed in life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so when
natural disasters came, their prophetess warned them and instructed them
as to what to do,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet the
unbelievers did not listen and obey, and so they suffered, and many lost
their lives,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
is so that heaven might see how you would act with wealth and
authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Did you use it
wisely?<span style="mso-tab-count:1">           </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those who
hope not to meet the angels at the resurrection say,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Bring a
different Korana from this so we may justify our actions of hate,
violence and war; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

some changes so we may oppress others without guilt.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You
should answer, “It is not fitting for me that I should change this good
Book at my pleasure; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

I fear, that if I am disobedient to my Goddess,</span>

<span

I should be forgotten and alone on the day of my resurrection.”<span

to the people, “If Goddess had not cared about you, you would not have
received the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
your prophetess would not have taught it to you.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I
have already dwelt among you all to the age of 45 before I received it.

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">10.17 And
who is more unjust than one who devises lies, inspires
oppression,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
teaches war, hate and violence, for all are against the teachings of
Goddess,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
they accuse Her signs and miracles of being false. Certainly the wicked
do not prosper in the end.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">             
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">10.18 For
they worship power, wealth and greed besides Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
will not profit them in the end, and they say, “These are good
intercessors with Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they help
us gain much that we desire in life.” But you should answer them,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Can you
tell Goddess something which She does not already know,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whether
it is in heaven or on the earth? Praise be to Her! </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
far be it from Her those negative emotions and actions which the dark
entities associate with Her.”<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

dissented therefrom; and if a decree had not previously issued</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from the
Lady of Light deferring discipline, certainly the matter would have been
decided between them,</span>

<span

which they had disagreed upon.<span

They say, “Unless a sign or miracle is sent down to the prophetess from
the Lady of Light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
not believe.” Answer them, “Certainly that which is hidden is known only
to Goddess;</span>

<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is a

return to heaven,</span>

provided with various plants; and the inhabitants there imagine that
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

power over the same; but heaven’s commands come down by night or by

should serve only Her, and your prophetess is only an instructor of

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">do they
not know that they cannot conceal what is in their hearts, and what they
declare publicly:</span>

<span

Goddess knows the innermost parts of the hearts of the people.<span

knows the place where it roams, and She knows where it sleeps.</span>

<span

whole plan is written clearly in the easily understood Book of heaven’s

it is She who is the One that created the heavens and the earth in six
celestial days,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and Her

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
She might prove everything to you, and see which of you would excel in
works.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If you
say, “You shall surely be raised again after death,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
unbelievers will say, “this is nothing but evil sorcery or a
tale.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">11.8 And
certainly if we defer the day of resurrection to a predetermined
season,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
say, “What prevented this event from happening to us?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Will it
not come to them on day when it may be not averted,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
those things that they scoffed at should fail to happen?<span

</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">11.9
Certainly, if we cause some people to taste mercy, and then afterwards
take it away,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
people will certainly become desperate and ungrateful.<span

</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">11.10 And
if heaven causes some people to taste goodness, after an affliction had
befallen them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
surely say, “The evils which I suffered have passed from me,” </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they will once again be joyful and insolent;<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">11.11
Only those people that persevere with patience, and do what is
right;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
shall receive pardon, and a great reward.<span

</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">11.12
Consider those people that desire to publish part of the revelations of
heaven,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so your
heart will become stronger, less they say, “Until a treasure is sent to
her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or until
an angel comes with her to bear witness to her, we will not
believe.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
a prophetess is but a preacher only, and Goddess is the governess of all
things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">11.13
Will they say, “She has created the Korana by herself?” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Answer
them, “Bring therefore ten chapters like it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">created
by yourselves, and call upon whomever you like to assist you, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
Goddess, if you speak the truth.”<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">11.14 But
if your false companions of wealth, greed and power do not hear
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">know that
this Book has been revealed by the knowledge of Goddess only,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
that there is no Goddess but Her. Will you now therefore become
Moslemas?<span

Whoever chooses the present life, and the pomp that is with it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to those
persons will be given the due compensation of the works performed in
their life, </span>

<span

shall make plans for them, </span>

<span

what they have missed in this life; for their past life has been in
vain.<span

Shall your prophetess be compared to such people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who
follow evident declarations from the Lady of Light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
whom a witness from heaven attends to her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">preceded
by the Books and teachings of Miriam, which were revealed as guides for
women,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and out
of mercy to womankind?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Many good
people believe in the Korana;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

dark entities with hard hearts will not believe;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
Goddess will make plans and trials for them, which will be
executed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">not as a
threat, but as loving plans; do not be in doubt concerning this;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for this
is the truth from your Lady of Light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

better part of womankind will not believe it or understand it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">11.18
There is little more unjust than a person that imagines a lie concerning
Goddess</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
preaches hate and violence against others and teaches war.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For they
shall be set before the Lady of Light, on the day of their
resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
witnesses will say, “These are those that lied against their Lady of
Light,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
will not be cursed, but Goddess shall make special plans for
them,</span>

<span

that they might see that violence and hate is a grievous mistake that
will only fail you in the end;<span

There are those that turn women aside from the ways of Goddess,</span>

<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

These people were not able to prevail against Goddess on earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
desired to escape punishment, neither did they have any protectress
besides Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so
they will have greatly increased toils and tribulations on earth,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
learn the way of enlightenment. They could not hear, nor could they

abandoned them.<span

There is no doubt that in the life to come,</span>

<span

sameness of the two groups, the light and dark entities;</span>

the governesses of the people, who did not believe, answered,</span>

When the angels came to Wileh, she was troubled for these people,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
her arm was extended to them out of concern, and she said, “This is
indeed a grievous day.”<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">11.78 And
her people came to her, rushing at her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
had been formerly guilty of violence, hate and persecution against
innocent people, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Wileh
said to them, “You should listen to my daughters that will tell you of
the love and kindness </span>

violence and hate against homosexuals,</span>

<span

other innocents that you fear for no reason. Is there not a person of
peace among you?”<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

They answered, “You know that we have no need to listen to</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">any of
your daughters that teach peace, love and kindness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you know
that we desire war, hate, torture and oppression more than anything
else,</span>

<span

us.”<span

could have recourse to someone you have respect for, to teach you of
love and kindness, </span>

<span

Lady of Light, </span>

not turn back, but as for your husband, he is not one of the believers
in peace and love, </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">he is
hateful and full of anger and will not heed you Wileh, as a prophetess,

Josie answered, “It grieves me that you take her away,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
I am worried that a wolf will devour her, when you are not watching
her.”<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

They replied, “Surely if a wolf attacks her, there are many of us
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
we would certainly be the weak ones if we could not defend her from a

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.15 And
when they had carried her with them, and agreed to set her at the bottom
of the well,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
carried out their plan, and heaven spoke to her saying, “You shall
hereafter declare a plan to them,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
afterwards your siblings will not know that you are really their long
lost sister Jacklyn.”<span

<span

left Jacklyn with our bags, and the wolf attacked her.<span

they produced her inner garment stained with false blood.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Josie
answered, “No, I think you have falsified this story to your own

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

certain travelers came, and they sent someone to the well to draw water
for them; </span>

class=Section7&gt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and he
let down his bucket, and said, “Good news, there is a young girl down
here.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And they
hid her, that they might sell her as a piece of merchandise; but Goddess
knew what they
did.<a href="#_ftn44" id="_ftnref44"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.20 And
they sold her for a very small price, for just a few pennies, and they
valued her little.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.21 And
the Egyptian who bought her said to his wife, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Use her
honorably, perhaps she will be of service to us, or we may adopt her for
a daughter.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In such a
manner, Jacklyn was given provisions in this world, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
angels taught her the interpretation of dreams and prophetic sayings,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess invokes such attributes in many, but few people are willing to
understand them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.22 And
when she had attained the age of maturity, she was given wisdom and
knowledge,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for those
attributes are given to the righteous.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.23 And
the man where Jacklyn was living desired her for himself,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and he
shut the doors and said, “Come hither.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
answered, “Goddess forbid!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Certainly my lord has made living here easy;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
generally the ungrateful do not prosper.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.24 But
he resolved further still to enjoy her, and he would have resolved to
enjoy her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">had he
not saw evident demonstration to the contrary from the Lady of

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But it is
only the good people who turn away from evil and filthiness, and she was
a sincere servant.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.25 And
she then ran to get out through the door, and he tore at the back of her
garment,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
met the mistress of the house at the door.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
mistress said, “What should be the reward of anyone who desires to
commit evil in this family,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but it
should be only imprisonment and dishonor?”</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.26<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>But Jacklyn said to her, “Mistress, he
asked me to sleep with him.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And a
witness in the family confirmed this matter saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.27 “If
the garment is torn in front, he speaks the truth and she is a
liar;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but if
her garment is torn in the back, then she is telling the truth and he is
a liar.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.28 And
when his wife saw that her garment was torn in the back,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she said,
“This is a cunning contrivance of your sex, for certainly your cunning
is great.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.29 “O
Jacklyn, take no further notice of this affair:</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and my
husband, what will you do for pardon for your crime, for you are clearly
guilty.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.30 And
certain women in the city said
publicly,<a href="#_ftn46" id="_ftnref46"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

obvious error.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.31 And
when Jacklyn’s mistress,

heard of their gossip, she invited them all to a
banquet,<a href="#_ftn48" id="_ftnref48"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she gave
each one of them a knife and said to Jacklyn, “Come here.”<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And when Jacklyn came to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
praised Jacklyn greatly, and they cut their own
hands<a href="#_ftn49" id="_ftnref49"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

said, “O Goddess!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>This is not a
mortal;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she is no
other than an angel deserving of the highest respect.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.32 And
the mistress said, “This is her, for whom you blame of the evils in my
household,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">he asked
her to lie with him, but she consistently refused.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But if
she solicited my husband to be her lover, surely she should go to prison
because she inflamed his lust,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
should be made one of the dishonored ones.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.33
Jacklyn said, “O Lady of Light, a prison is more desirable to me</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">than the
crime I have been invited to commit against you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for You
hear and know all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>But unless You
turn away their snares,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I will
youthfully succumb to them, and become one of the foolish ones.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.34 But
Goddess heard her, and turned aside the snare, for She hears and knows
everything.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.35 And
it seemed a good idea to those that were present,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though they had seen the signs that Jacklyn was innocent, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
Jacklyn should be imprisoned for a time, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for it is
certain that a nobleman would never be tempted to err.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.36 And
so Jacklyn entered the
prison<a href="#_ftn50" id="_ftnref50"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

two of the Queen’s servants.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">One of
them said, “It seemed to me in my dream that I pressed wine out of
grapes.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And the
other said, “It seemed to me in my dream that I carried bread </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on my
head, and the birds came and ate it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Please
declare the interpretation of our dreams, for we believe that you are a
caring person.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.37
Jacklyn answered, “No food with which you might be nourished will come
to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but I
will provide you with the interpretation, before this happens to
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
knowledge is part of what the Lady of Light has shown me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for I
have left the religion of people who believe in a mean, angry
goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
who deny the life to come.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.38 “It
is because I follow the religion of my foremothers, Sara, Deborah, Nora
and Wileh,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I am able
to do this.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>It is not lawful for
us to associate anything nasty or negative with our Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

is all loving, all kind and all caring.” </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
knowledge of the divine unity of goodness has been given out of the
bounty of Goddess towards us, and toward womankind, yet the greater part
of the people are not thankful.”<span

</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.39 “O,
my fellow prisoners, are the mean and evil goddesses better,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or is the
One better that is mighty in Her love, kindness and compassion?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.40
“You should not worship any negative deities besides Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">None of
the names you have named, you and your foremothers, were loving
goddesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so you
worshiped negative deities without authoritative proof from Her; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">judgment
belongs to Goddess alone, for She commands that you worship none besides
Her. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
the right religion, but the better portion of people do not know
this.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.41 “O,
my fellow prisoners, certainly the one of you shall serve wine to her
mistress, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as she
had done formerly, but the other shall be crucified, and the bird shall
eat from off her head.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
the matter which was sent down which you wanted to know about.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.42 And
Jacklyn said to her who was to escape punishment, remember me in the
presence of your Lady.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But the

Lady;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

she remained in the prison some years
longer.<a href="#_ftn51" id="_ftnref51"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.43 And
the Queen of Egypt said, “Certainly, I saw in my dream, seven fat cows,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
seven lean cows devoured, and seven green ears of corn, and another
seven withered ears,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">O my
noble princes tell me what my vision means, if you are able to interpret
this vision.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.44
They answered, “These are confused dreams,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we are
not skilled in the art of interpreting confused dreams.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.45 And
Jacklyn’s fellow prisoner who had been delivered said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">(for this
event caused her to remember Jacklyn after a period of time),</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“I can
tell you the interpretation of this dream, if you will allow me to
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">go to the
person who can interpret it for me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.46 And
she went to the prison, and said, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O
Jacklyn, your are a woman of truth, tell me the interpretation of seven
fat cattle, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
seven lean cattle devour; and of seven green ears of corn with seven
withered ears, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">all of
which the Queen saw in her dreams.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I desire
to return to court, so that we can understand what this means.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.47
Jacklyn answered, “You shall sow seven years as usual: </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
corn which is reaped, should be left in the
ear<a href="#_ftn52" id="_ftnref52"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

you should eat just a little.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.48
Then there will come after this, seven grievous years of famine,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whereupon
you shall eat what you have laid up as a provision for the upcoming
famine,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except a
little which you shall have kept.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.49
Then there shall come after this, a year where there will be plenty of
rain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
shall be able to press wine and oil.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.50 And
when the chief butler had reported this, the Queen said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Bring
her to me.” And when the messenger came to Jacklyn, he said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Return
to your Lady and ask of her, what is the intent of the women who cut
their hands,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for my

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

when the women were assembled before the Queen,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she said
to them, “What was your design when you asked Jacklyn about her unlawful
love?” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
answered, “Goddess be praised!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>We
found nothing evil in her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
nobleman said, “Now that the truth has come out, it was I who solicited
her to lie with me; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
is one of those that speak the truth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.52 And
when Jacklyn became acquainted with all that had happened, she
said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This
discovery has been made known so that my mistress understands</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that I
was not unfaithful to her in her absence, and that Goddess does not
direct the plots of evil doers.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.53
“Neither can I absolutely justify all my actions, since every soul is
given opportunities to do evil,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
opportunities to do good, for we are all blessed with freewill; for
Goddess is gracious and merciful.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.54 And
the Queen said, “bring her to me; I will make her one of my own special
servants.”<a href="#_ftn54" id="_ftnref54"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
Jacklyn was brought to the Queen, and had spoken with her, the Queen
said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“You are

Jacklyn replied, “Place me in charge of the warehouses for this country;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for I

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.56
Thus, Jacklyn was established in the land, that she might provide
herself a dwelling therein,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where she
pleased. Heaven bestows mercy on those that it will,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
does not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.57 And
certainly the reward of the next life is better, for those who believe
and love Goddess.</span>

when she had furnished them with provisions, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she said
“Bring to me your sister, the daughter of your mother;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

you ever return to see me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.61
They answered, “We will endeavor to bring her to you, by permission of
her mother,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will do whatever you require.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.62 And
Jacklyn said to her servants, “Take the money they have brought to pay
for corn</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and put
it into each of their sacks with the corn, so they will know this only
after they return home;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
believe that they will return to us.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.63 And
when they returned home to their mother, they said, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O
mother, we have been told we may not receive additional corn until we
bring back our </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">youngest
sister Barbara with us, so please let her<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will obtain more corn, and we will guard her from any mischief.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.64
Josie answered, “Why should I entrust you with her and expect any better
success </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">than when
I entrusted your sister Jacklyn with you before this? But Goddess is the
best guardian,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
is most merciful to those that show mercy to others.”</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.65<span

corn, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
found that all their money had been returned to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
said, “O mother, what do we desire in addition?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It
appears that our money has been returned to us, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we may
therefore return and provide corn for our family;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we can
care for our sister; and we can receive a camel’s burden more than we
did the last time.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is a
small quantity that we have now.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.66
Josie said, “I will by no means send her with you, until you give me a
solemn promise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and swear
by Goddess that you will assuredly bring her back to me, unless a
terrible disaster befalls you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">When they
gave her their solemn promise, she said, “Goddess is witness of all we
say.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.67 And
she said, “My children, do not enter into the city through the same
gate; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but enter
by different gates. But this precaution will be of no advantage to
you</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">against
any decrees of Goddess; for judgment belongs to Goddess alone;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in Her I
put my trust, and in Her let those who confide in Goddess, to put their
trust in Her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.68 And
when they entered the city, as their mother had commanded them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it was no
advantage to them against the decrees of Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
same served only to satisfy the desire of Jacklyn’s soul, which she
directed them to perform, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for she
was endued with knowledge of that which came from heaven;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
greater part of people do not understand this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.69 And
when they came again into the presence of Jacklyn,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she
received her sister Barbara as her guest, and said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

sister Barbara’s sack.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
is an appropriate punishment for a thief.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.76
Then they began to search all the sacks, and found the cup in the sacks
of a sister,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
was taken from the sister’s sack. But it was not lawful for this person
to be taken as a hostage</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by the
Queen of Egypt, had Goddess not allowed it, despite what the siblings
had avowed to do.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Heaven
raises to high degrees of knowledge and honor those that are in need of
this; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
is one who is more knowing above all those endued with learning and
knowledge.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.77 The
siblings replied, “If Barbara is guilty of theft, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then so
is Jacklyn guilty for what she had done
before.”<a href="#_ftn60" id="_ftnref60"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
Jacklyn had concealed these things in her mind,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
did not tell them of her plan, and so she said to herself,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You are
in a worse condition that myself and Barbara;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess knows best what you have discussed amongst yourselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.78
They said to Jacklyn, “Noble Lady, certainly this young lady has an aged
mother, <span style="mso-tab-count:1">   </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
take one of us in her place, for we believe that you are a merciful
person.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.79
Jacklyn answered, “Goddess forbid that we should take</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Barbara
with us as a hostage, for then we would be unjust.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.80 And
when they despaired of taking Barbara back with them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
discussed the matter privately amongst themselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And the
eldest said, “Do you not know that you had made a solemn promise to
everyone </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in the
presence of Goddess, and how wickedly you behaved here towards
Jacklyn?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore,
I will not leave here, until mother gives us permission to return
home,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
Goddess makes Her will known to me; for She is the Best Instructor and
Adviser.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.81 “Go
ahead and return to your mother and say, ‘O mother,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
your child has committed theft; we bear witness to the extent that we
have knowledge,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
could not have guarded against this;’”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.82
“And inquire in the city as to where we have been, and of the company of
merchants,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with whom
we arrived, and you will find that we have spoken the truth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.83 And
when they returned and talked with their mother,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she said,
“I do not believe you and I think you have contrived this entire matter
for your own sakes;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but I am
very patient and I hope that Goddess will bring back all of my children
to me;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is all knowing and wise.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.84 And
she turned away from them and said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O how I
am grieved for Jacklyn!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And now I
grieve likewise for Barbara, I am afraid for her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that she
might never return to me.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Her
eyes then became white from
weeping,<a href="#_ftn61" id="_ftnref61"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
fell into deep sorrow for her two missing daughters.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.85 Her
children said, “By Goddess, you will not cease to remember
Jacklyn,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until you
are at death’s door, and you surely might die from such deep
sorrow.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.86 She
answered, “I only felt my intense grief, which I am not able to
control,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and my
sorrow is sent to Goddess in prayer;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but I
know by prior revelation from Goddess things which you do not
know.”<a href="#_ftn62" id="_ftnref62"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.87 “O
my children, go and make inquiry of Jacklyn and her sister;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not despair that you will not find the mercy of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for none
despair of Goddess’ mercy, except for unbelievers.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.88
Therefore, the siblings returned to Egypt, and when they saw her, they
said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Noble
Lady, the famine has been disastrous to us and our family,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have come with only a small amount of money,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet we
beg that we might be provided a full allotment, and we also beg corn as
alms,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess rewards the charitable.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.89
Jacklyn said to them, “Do you know what happened to Jacklyn and her
sister, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and how
you have pretended to be ignorant of all

They answered, “Aren’t you really Jacklyn?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
replied, “I am Jacklyn, and Barbara is my sister. Goddess has been
gracious to us both.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For those
that love Goddess, and persevere with patience, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
find relief; for Goddess will not suffer the reward of the righteous to
perish.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.91
They said, “By Goddess, She has chosen you above us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have certainly erred in what we have
done.”<a href="#_ftn64" id="_ftnref64"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Jacklyn answered, “I do not want there to be any vengeance upon you
today,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess forgives you all, for She is the most merciful of those that
show mercy.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.93
“Therefore leave here with my inner garment, and throw it upon our
mother’s face,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
will regain her sight, and then come back to me with all our
family.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.94 And
when the siblings left from Egypt on their journey towards
Canaan,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">their
mother said to those nearby, “I believe that I smell Jacklyn,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">though
you probably all think that I am just doting and grief

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.95
Those around her thought, “By Goddess, you are old and mistaken.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.96 But
when the messenger of good tidings came to her with Jacklyn’s</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">inner
garment, she threw it over her face, and her mother recovered her
eyesight.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And Josie
said, “Didn’t I tell you that I knew from Goddess Herself, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">many
things which you all did not know?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.97
They answered, “O mother, pardon our errors, for certainly we have been
in error.”<span style="mso-tab-count:2">                       
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.98 She
replied, “I will certainly ask pardon for you from my Lady of Light,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is gracious and merciful.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.99 And
when Josie and her family arrived in Egypt,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and were
introduced to Jacklyn, Jacklyn received them and said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Enter
into Egypt, by the favor of Goddess, in full

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

And she raised her parents to the seat of state, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
together with her siblings, did fall down and did obeisance to her, and
she said, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O my

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and now
the Lady of Light has brought this to fruition, and She has surely been
gracious to me,</span>

This was a secret herstory which we have revealed to our prophetess,

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
you were not present with the siblings of Jacklyn,</span>

You shall not demand any reward for publishing the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

And how many signs are there to show the being, unity and

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

But the greater part of them will not believe in Goddess,</span>

they not believe that some severe natural disaster will not come to
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as a
trial from Goddess, when She sends them a beloved prophetess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Or, that
the hour of resurrection will never take them suddenly, when they have
not expected it?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.108
Tell the women of Mecca, “This is my way: I invite you to
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by Her
evident demonstrations; both I and she who follows me are welcomed by
Her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
praise be to Goddess! I am not one that idolizes wealth, power and
money.”</span>

The people have been sent many apostles and prophetesses before,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
that heaven has revealed their will to; and those that were chosen

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But the

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.110
Their predecessors were born for only a time until,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when our
prophetesses despaired of their nasty conversations,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
thought they were liars, the help of heaven came to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that were delivered were those that listened;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
natural disasters of life were not avoided by the wicked,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they were stubborn and would not listen to their prophetesses.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12.111
Certainly in the herstories of the prophetesses and their
peoples,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there is
an instructive example to those that are endued with
understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
Korana is not a new invented fiction;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but it is
a confirmation of the Scriptures of many prophetesses which have</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">been
revealed before it, and it is a distinct explanation of everything
necessary,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
respect to either faith or practice, and it is a direction and mercy to
</span>

is Goddess who has raised the heavens without visible pillars; and then
She ascended to Her throne,</span>

Her signs vividly, so you will know that you will return once again to
Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

is She who has laid out the earth and placed thereupon steadfast
mountains and rivers, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.4 And
upon the earth there are tracts of land with differing geographic
features;</span>

though they border one another, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

are vineyards, seeds and palm trees springing up differently, yet all
from a root structure, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and many
plants have different types of roots. They are watered with the same
water,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet some
of these plants yield a fruit which is more excellent than others to
eat.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These
surely are signs for people that use understanding in their

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

you wonder at the unbelievers who deny the resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

there have already been examples of divine love shown to them.</span>

iniquity; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
Lady of Light is severe in providing Her love to all.</span>

unbelievers will say, “Unless a sign is sent down from the Lady of
Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

people there has been appointed a protectress and a prophetess.</span>

Goddess knows what every woman bears in her uterus;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whether the child will be born early, on time or late, and the number of
young she carries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

the great, the most high.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.10 She
knows from among you who conceals Her words, and she who proclaims them
in public,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she who
seeks to hide herself in the night, and she who travels openly during
the day,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
all equal knowledge to Goddess.</span>

Each person has angels with her, before her and behind her;</span>

watch every person by the command of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
Goddess does not change the bounty of her grace given to each
person,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until
they change their disposition by creating error on earth, nor do they
have any Protectress besides Her.</span>

is She who causes the lightening to appear to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She sends
down thunderbolts, and some will be stricken, but this is not the
intentional work of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is
merely life on earth, so you see it is dangerous, for She is mighty and
powerful. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

is She who you should all invoke for help;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
false negative idols of wealth, power and self centeredness will be of
no help to you at all;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but She
will hear you, for She stretches out Her hands to rain water down upon
you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but it
will not descend without Her; the pleading of the unbelievers is all in

Whatsoever is in heaven and upon earth may freely worship
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
should be done voluntarily, and not by force, and in the manner of the
person’s own choosing;</span>

the forces of wealth and power be treated equally with Goddess,</span>

your creation of these should bear any resemblance to the creations of

the people, “Goddess is the Creatress of all good things;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
brings love to everyone and She is the one, the victorious
Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.17 She
causes water to descend from heaven, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

brooks to flow according to the volumes appointed them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
floods that bear floating froth, and even the metals which people melt
in fire,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">seeking
to create ornaments or vessels for use, but there arises a scum similar
to this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus,
Goddess creates and propagates truth, while some people propagate
vanity.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But the
scum of molten metal may be thrown off and that which remains</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">may be
made useful to people on earth. In this manner, Goddess sets forth Her
parables.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but those
that do not obey Her, although they may be possessed of what is in the
entire earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and maybe
even much more than that, when they see what they have done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
would give it all up for their own ransom.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These
people will be brought to a very sad reckoning, they will live on earth
life after life, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it is
like hell fire here, and what an unhappy couch this shall be!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.19 If
you knew what has been sent down to you is the truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then why
do some of you treat it as if you were blind?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It would
appear that only the prudent and wise will consider this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.20 For
those who fulfil the covenants of Goddess to love one another, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.22 and
those who persevere out of a sincere desire to love and please their
Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and pray
frequently, and give alms out of what has been bestowed upon
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">both in
secret and openly, and who turn away evil with good;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
reward of these shall be paradise and gardens of eternal abode,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.23
which they shall enter, and among those that have acted </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in an
upright fashion, of their mothers, and their husbands, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
posterity; the angels shall go by them, through every gate
saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.24
“Peace be upon you, because you have endured with patience;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
because you have loved and cared for many, how excellent a reward is
paradise!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.25 But
as for those who violate the covenants of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">after
they have been told of the establishment of them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
who cut asunder things which Goddess has joined together,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that act corruptly on the earth, those people will have great sadness
and woe,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall remain on earth, which is like a miserable dwelling in
hell.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.26 But
Goddess gives provisions of abundance to those whom She pleases, and She
is sparing to none.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Some
people rejoice in the present life; but rest assured that the present
life, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">compared
to your future life, is but a fleeting and precarious provision. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.27 The
unfaithful will say, “Unless a sign is sent

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to her
who is allegedly from the Lady of Light, we will not believe.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Answer
them, “Certainly Goddess will not lead you to Her, until you pray for it
and repent.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.28 And
for those who believe, and those whose hearts rest securely in the
meditation of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">paradise
is assured, so should not every woman’s heart rest securely in
meditation of Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.29
Those people who believe and do that which is right shall enjoy
blessedness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall partake of a happy resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.30
Thus heaven has sent to your nation a prophetess, as has been done for
nations preceding you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
likewise prophetesses have been sent, that you might reveal to all what
heaven has given to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
while the people did not believe in a merciful and loving Goddess. Say
to the people, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“She is
my Lady of Light, there is no Goddess but Her, in Her I do trust, and to
Her I must return.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.31
Though a Korana could have been revealed by which mountains could be
moved, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or the
earth cleaved asunder, or the dead be caused to speak, this would all be
in vain. </span>

class=Section10&gt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These
matters belong entirely to Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do not
the believers know that if Goddess had pleased, She would direct all
people in an obvious manner?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Adversity
shall not cease to afflict the unbelievers for what they have
done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
it cause them to stay within their dwellings, until the promises of
Goddess have been revealed;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is not contrary to Her promises.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.32
Prophetesses, before this you have been laughed at and scorned,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
unfaithful have had long lives despite this, and yet the unbelievers
were unhappy, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
continue to be tied to the
earth,<a href="#_ftn78" id="_ftnref78"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><em><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;

and what a horrid situation that is!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.33 Who
is it then, that stands above every soul, to observe what that soul has
done? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
unfaithful attribute dark emotions and actions of hate, jealousy, rage
and injustice to Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
these people, “Name these emotions you attribute to Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">why do
you speak about things which Goddess has not commanded on earth?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But the
deceitful procedures of the unfaithful are already well known to
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they are
turned aside from the right path; for only Goddess knows who will err on
this subject,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
without Goddess, they will have no true direction.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.34
They shall suffer the punishment of staying on earth</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and being
reborn after this life, and such a punishment is very grievous,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
without Goddess and Her angels, they will have no Protectress,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and life
on earth is indeed a dangerous proposition.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.35
This is the description of paradise which has been promised to the
pious:</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is
watered by rivers; its food is perpetual, and its shade is also; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
the reward of those that love Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But the
reward of the unfaithful it that they shall be tied to this earth
plane;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
shall be reborn without protection from angels and Goddess, and this
shall be like hell fire to them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for upon
the earth there is bad food, bad water, extreme heat and cold, and you
must support yourselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.36 For
those that have been given the Scriptures, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
should rejoice at what has been now revealed to
them.<a href="#_ftn79" id="_ftnref79"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet there
are some dissidents who deny part of the Korana.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Say to
these people, “I am commanded to worship Goddess alone;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and not
to associate dark emotions or actions with Her; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">upon Her
I call for assistance and guidance, and to Her I shall return.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.37 To
effectuate this purpose, heaven has sent down the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a rule of
hope, love and guidance in the English language which is easily
translatable</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">into all
other languages on earth. Certainly, if you follow your own selfish
desires,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">after
receiving this knowledge which has been given to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there
will be none to defend or protect you, except Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.38
Heaven has formerly send down prophetesses before you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and has
given them handsome husbands and
children,<a href="#_ftn80" id="_ftnref80"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

no prophetess needs to come with a sign,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except by
permission of Goddess. Every time and place is given a Book of
revelations from heaven.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.39 For
Goddess confirms or abolishes what She believes is best for you.</span>

class=Section11&gt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
original of this Book is found both with Goddess and in heaven.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.40
Moreover, whether the people on earth know of the travails that will
befall them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or if
they die prematurely, the only duty of a prophetess is to preach and
teach them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
judgment is left to heaven alone, and even that is accomplished based
upon what the soul has done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">13.41 Do
not the people understand that angels from heaven are in their land

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

judgment; </span>

Many predecessors have devised subtle plots against their</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">prophetesses,
but Goddess is mistress of every subtle device.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She knows
everything a soul conjures up, and the unfaithful will certainly
know</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who will
receive the reward of paradise, for they have been instructed

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
may lead women forth from darkness into light, by the permission of the
Lady of Light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in a
glorious and laudable way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.2
Goddess is She to whom belongs everything that is in heaven and upon
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
sadness is the state of the unbelievers, for they wander in confusion
and darkness, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without a
protectress.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.3 For
those that love the present life above what is to come, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and for
those who turn women away from Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
who seek to make life difficult, these people are mistaken and far from
Truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.4
Heaven has sent a prophetess with only the best language of her people,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
she might declare the love of Goddess plainly to them. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For
people err as they please, and Goddess will attempt to direct them,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if they
will listen and pray to Her, for She is the mighty and the Wise
One.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.5 We
formerly sent Miriam with our signs, and commanded her saying, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Lead
forth the people from darkness into light.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.6 And
recall when Miriam said to Her people, “Remember the favor of Goddess
towards you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when She
delivered you from the people of Pharaoh:</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
grievously oppressed you, and they slew your female
children,<a href="#_ftn83" id="_ftnref83"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but let
your males live, and this was a great trial.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.7 And
when you Lady of Light said, through Miriam, “If you are
grateful,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I will
surely increase my favor towards you; but if you are ungrateful,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
you will be like those that wander in confusion.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.8 And
Miriam said, “If you are ungrateful, many people in the earth are surely
ungrateful;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
Goddess does not need your thanks, though She deserves your highest
praise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.9 Have
you not heard of the herstory of your predecessors, namely, the people
of Wileh,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and of
Ada or Thelma, and of those prophetesses that succeeded them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whose
number no one knows except Goddess. Their prophetesses came to them with
evident miracles;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
clapped their hands to their mouths out of indignation,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
said, “We do not believe the message with which you pretend to be
sent,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
are in doubt concerning the religion to which </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
invite us to join; we have just reasons to be suspicious.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.10
Their prophetesses answered,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>“Is
there any doubt concerning Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
Creatress of heaven and earth? She invited you to the true faith that
She might forgive your sins,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and may
respite harm, by granting you a time to repent until the appointed
hour.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
answered, “You are just like other women, and like us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you seek
to turn us aside from the negative
goddesses<a href="#_ftn84" id="_ftnref84"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

which our mothers worshiped;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
bring us an evident demonstration by some miracle if you speak the
truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.11 The
prophetesses replied to them, “We are no different than women like
you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess is bountiful to Her servants as She pleases;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it is
not in our power to give you a miraculous demonstration of our mission,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
with the permission of Goddess; therefore, in Goddess let the faithful
put their trust.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.12
“And what excuse do you have to allege that we should not put our trust
in Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">since She
has directed each of our paths? Certainly we will suffer with patience
the persecution we will </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">encounter
while we walk this earth; in Goddess therefore let us put our confidence
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and only
in people that seek the trust of Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.13 And
those who believed did not say to their prophetesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“We will
expel you from our land until you return to our religion.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Goddess spoke to them by revelation, saying “We will love the
unbelievers, nonetheless.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.14 But
they will be tied to the earth long after you, without guardians or My
protection.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They will
not have a joyous day of resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
instead will come back to this earth plane, and they will not have My
love, until they seek it.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.15 And
many people have asked for the assistance of Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but every
rebellious spirit found no success in this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.16 For
the earth is the permanent abode of the rebellious,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
has filthy water, which many must drink;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.17
many people will dip it up little by little, and it often cannot pass
down their throat</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">due to
nauseousness, and when death comes, it is not death,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for no
soul ever truly dies, and to be born again to earth is indeed a grievous
torment.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.18<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>This is what will happen to those that
do not believe in Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Their
misdeeds and erroneous works are like ashes, which the wind violently
scatters on a stormy day;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
not be able to obtain any advantage from what they have done on
earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">theirs is
error from the most distant truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.19 Do
you not see that Goddess has created the heavens and earth in all Her
wisdom?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If She
were pleased with you, She could move you to a new and better and richer
land,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and put
another poorer nation in your place, this is how She shows you She is
all Love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.20
Such a task would not be at all difficult for Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.21<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And all spirits shall come into the
presence of Goddess at their last day, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and many
weak entities will be able to tell those that behaved arrogantly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly
we were your followers on earth, why did you not avert us from a
troubled cycle of rebirth?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
shall answer, “If Goddess had directed us properly, then we would have
directed you properly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It was
the same thing for us to bear our torments impatiently, or whether we
endured them with patience,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for we
all had no way to escape the continued rebirth process.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.22 And
Evil shall say, after judgment will have been shown to you all, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly
Goddess promised you the promise of truth, and I made you a promise
also, but I deceived you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But I did
not have any power to compel you to behave in this manner,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I only
called out and you answered to me, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
do not say I was the source of your problems, for you convicted only
yourselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I cannot
assist you now; nor can you assist me.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
I will renounce you now for having associated with me with Goddess
before this. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">A
grievous torment of continued life on earth was always prepared for the
unjust.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.23 But
those people who have believed and have only done righteousness </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall be
introduced into gardens where rivers flow and they shall remain there
forever, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
by the permission of Goddess, and their salutation there shall be
“Peace!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.24 Do
you not understand how Goddess has rendered a parable, representing a
good word,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as a good
tree, whose roots are firmly fixed in the earth, and whose branches
reach to heaven;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.25 who
brings forth its fruit in all seasons, by the will of Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For
Goddess propounds parables to women, that they may be properly
instructed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.26<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And the likeness of an evil word is
like an evil tree,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
must be torn up from the face of the earth, for it has no
stability.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.27
Goddess shall confirm those who believe, with the steadfast Words of
faith,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">both in
this life and that which is to come;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess suffers the wicked to err because they never call upon Her for
direction;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for they
all have free will and Goddess does what she deems best for you all, for
She is wise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.28
Have you not considered those persons who have changed the grace of
Goddess to unfaithfulness, and they have caused<span

of perdition, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">namely,

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

an unhappy dwelling it is.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.30
These people also set up the idols of wealth, power and self
centeredness as copartners with Goddess, that they might cause people to
stray from the path of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But say
to the people, “You can only enjoy the pleasures of this life for a
short time,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.31
Speak to the servants of heaven who have believed, note that they have
been assiduous at prayer, and they gave alms from what heaven bestowed
upon them, both privately and in public;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
all occurred before the day when there will no longer be any buying,
selling or friendship.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.32 It
is Goddess who has created the heavens and the earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
causes the water to descend from heaven, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and by
this means She produces fruits for your sustenance; </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and by
Her command She obliges ships to sail in the sea for your service,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
also forces the rivers to supply you with many uses;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.33 She
also compels the sun and the moon to diligently follow their
predetermined orbits to serve you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has subjected the day and the nighttime to your service.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.34 She
has given you everything which you could ever ask for;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
you attempted to tally all the favors of Goddess, in comparison to the
favors you have done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there
would be no comparison. For many people are unjust and
ungrateful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.35
Remember when Sarah said, “O Lady of Light, make this land a place of
security;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and grant
that I and my children may avoid the worship</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of idols
of greed, wealth, power and self centeredness;”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.36
“for they, O Lady of Light, have seduced a great number of people.<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whomever shall disobey, I pray you will be gracious and
merciful.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.37 “O
Lady of Light, I have directed some of my children to settle in an
unfruitful valley, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nearby

therefore, that the hearts of some women may be affected with kindness
towards them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
bestow on them all sorts of fruits, that they might give thanks.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.38 “O
Lady of Light, you know whatever we conceal,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whatever we declare openly, for nothing is hidden from Goddess, either
on earth or in heaven.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.39
“Praise be to Goddess, who has given me in my old age Isabell and Iris;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
Lady of Light listens to all prayers.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.40 “O
Lady of Light, grant that I may be one that observes prayer, and a most
of my posterity also,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">O Lady of

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.41 “O
Lady of Light, forgive me, and my parents, and my children,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
faithful, on the day of our resurrection and accounting.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.42 For
the prophetess should not think that the Lady of Light is regardless of
what the unbelievers do. She only defers Her judgment of love till the
day when a person’s eyes shall be fixed, as they stare in awe</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.43 at
the voice of the angels calling everyone to judgment, and they shall
lift up their heads,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will not be able to avert their sight from seeing truly what they have
done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
hearts will be filled with remorse, for what they have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.44
Therefore tell the people about the last day, where they shall see what
they have done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and where
those who have acted unjustly shall say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O Lady
of Light, give us respite from what we have done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will obey your call, and follow your prophetess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But it
shall be answered to them, “Did you not swear before this, that no
adversities will befall you?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.45

unjustly, </span>

knew how heaven had dealt with them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but their
efforts were entirely apparent to Goddess, and She is able to frustrate
their designs;</span>

their designs were so great, one would think that mountains could be
moved thereby.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">14.47 A
prophetess should not think that Goddess will ever be contrary to Her
promises of assistance, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is mighty and able to quickly love.</span>

Neither heaven nor Goddess destroys any city, but during a fixed term
their prophetesses warn them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so they
can avoid upcoming natural disasters.</span>

Meccans say, “O the people who lived where the disaster occurred,

“Heaven would have sent angels to warn us, if they had spoken the
truth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.8 You
should answer them, “Heaven does not send down angels,</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless it
is a just occasion, and there is no respite for a period of

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.9
Heaven has sent down the Korana, and it will be preserved from
corruption.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.10
Heaven has prior to this, sent down prophetesses among you, and to the
ancient peoples,</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.11 and
no prophetess ever came to a people wherein they did not laugh at her

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.12 In
the same manner will the hearts of the wicked turn, for the Meccans will
scoff at their prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.13
They will not believe in her, and this has happened before.</span>

send water down from heaven, which you are given to drink, and which you
do not store up.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.25 And
your Lady of Light shall gather you all together at the last day, for
She is knowing and wise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.26 For
humanity was created from a divine spark, water and minerals of the
earth, formed into shape,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.27 and
evil was created from fire and hate,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.28 and
remember when the Lady of Light said to the angels,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly
I am about to create a woman out of a divine spark, earthly minerals and
water, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
will fashion her into shape,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.29 and
when I have completely formed her, and I shall have breathed my spirit
into her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you must
fall down and worship her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.30 And
all the angels worshiped Eve together,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.31
except Eblis, who refused to be with those that worshiped woman.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.32 And
then Goddess said to him, “O Eblis, what has hindered you from
worshiping Eve</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with the
others?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.33 He
answered, “It is not fitting that I should worship a woman,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whom you
have created of earthly minerals and water that was fashioned into
shape.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.34
Goddess said, “Then leave Heaven, or you will be driven out with
stones.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.35

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.36
Eblis answered, “O Lady of light, give me respite until the day of final
resurrection.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.37 And
Goddess answered, “Certainly you will be one of those that are
respited,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.38
until the final judgment day.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.39
Eblis replied, “O Lady of Light, because you have seduced me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I will
tempt your people to disobedience in the earth;</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.40<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>and I will seduce those that desire to
be my servants.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.41
Goddess said, “The people will have free will to decide whether or not
to follow you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.42
“But as to my faithful servants, you will have no power over
them;</span>

over those that desire to be seduced, and who want to follow you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.43 And
eternal rebirth on earth, which is like hell, will be assigned to each
of the dark entities.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.44 For
hell will have seven gates, and for each gate a distinct type of soul
will be assigned to it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.45 but
as for those that love Goddess, these people shall dwell in gardens
amidst fountains.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.46 The
angels will say to them, ‘Enter in peace and security,</span>

weariness shall not affect them, nor shall they be thrown out from
Paradise.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

“Declare to my servants that I am the gracious, the Merciful

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.54 She
said, “Why do you bring me the promise of a great daughter when I am so
very old?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">What are
you telling me?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.55
They said, “We have told you the truth, do not be among those that
despair.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.56 She
answered, “And who would ever despair of the mercy of Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
those that are in error?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.57 And
she said, “What is your errand, therefore, O messengers of
Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.58
They answered, “Certainly we have been sent </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to warn
the believers of a natural disaster which is to come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.59 but
as for the family of Wileh, we will save them all, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

infidels and those that persecute and hate others.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.61 And
when the messengers came to the family of Wileh,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.62 she
said to them, “You appear to be good people that are unknown to
me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.63
They answered, “But we come to you, to warn you of a coming natural
disaster,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">one that
your fellow citizens have doubted.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.64 “We
will tell you the truth of what will happen, we are messengers of
veracity.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.65
“Therefore you must lead your family, during the night, out of this
place,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not let anyone lag behind, nor let anyone turn back, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but go
where you have been commanded.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.66 And
the angels gave her this command, because the other people were left
behind,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
would be a disaster in the morning whereby many would perish.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.67 And
some inhabitants of the city came to Wileh, rejoicing at the arrival of
some strangers.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.68 And
she said to them, “These are my guests, do not treat them rudely or with
abuse.”</span>

class=Section13&gt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.69
“Love your Goddess and do not put me to shame.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.70
They answered, “Have we not forbidden you to protect the innocent?<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We will
deal with them as we see fit.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.71
Wileh replied, “These are my daughters, they will teach you the ways of
peace and love</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will forget your violent, abusive and oppressive ways.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.72 “As
you have been living, you have wandered in folly.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.73
Wherefore a terrible storm came from Heaven and assailed them all at
dawn,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.74 and
the city was turned upside down; and upon it rained stones of baked
clay.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.75
Certainly these are signs for the wise person to contemplate.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.76 And
of those cities experienced natural disasters, there was none that did
not have </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a
prophetess who was sent first, to warn the inhabitants of the upcoming
calamity.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The lack
of faith and stubbornness of the unbelievers was to demonstrate to the
believers </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">what
Goddess can do for the faithful, and to point out a right way for women
to walk in.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.77
Certainly this is a miracle for the true believers to understand.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.78<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Therefore they also were not warned of an upcoming disaster
because</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
would not listen to their prophetess that tried to warn them. And two
cities were destroyed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
were shown as an example of how not to

false;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

they likewise experienced a natural disaster without warning,</span>

Heaven will protect you from the scoffers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">15.96 and
those who would associate Goddess with wealth, power, self centeredness

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

She shall cause the angels to descend with revelations, </span>

“Preach that there is no Goddess, except myself; therefore, love Me with
all your heart.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.3 For
She has created the heavens and the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
manifest Her justice, and do not associate any evil with Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.4 She
has created woman from ova and a divine spark; and yet some dispute this
and the

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

has created cattle for you; and they will keep you warm,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has given you other advantages from them, and you also use them for
food.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.6 And
they will be a credit for you, when you drive them home in the
evening,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
you lead them out in the morning.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.7 And
they will carry your burdens to a distant country, that you could not
travel to, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
great difficulty,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for your
Lady of Light is compassionate and merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.8 And
She also created horses, and mules and donkeys, that you may ride
upon,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
are an ornament to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
also created many other things which you do not even know about.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.9 It
is the work of Goddess to instruct women in living properly;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and many
may turn aside from such teaching; for She teaches everyone, but only
some will listen.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.10 It
is She who sends rain water down from heaven, which is provided for you
to drink,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and for
the plants which feed your cattle.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.11 And
She has also caused corn, olives, palm trees, grapes and all types of
fruit to spring forth for you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
this is a sign of the divine power and wisdom, for the wise person to
consider.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.12 And
She has given you day and night, for your service; and the sun, and the
moon and the stars,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which are
compelled to serve you by Her command.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.13 And
She also has given you dominion over what She has created for you in the
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
can see things by their different colors. Certainly this is a sign for
the wise person to consider.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

you might be joyous before Her and in your homes and public

abundance of Goddess by your commerce; at that time you should give Her
thanks.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.15 And
She has thrown upon the earth great mountains that are firmly rooted,

She has created landmarks, so that you will know your way, and also
stars to direct you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.17
Should Goddess, therefore, be the same as you, that whom She has
created?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do you
ever consider these things?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.18 If
you ever attempted to tally all the favors of Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you would
never be able to tabulate them all. For Goddess is gracious and
merciful;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.19 and
Goddess knows all that you conceal, and all that you have openly
published.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.20 But
the idols of wealth, greed and power, which you invoke and seek, besides
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">create no
goodness for you, but you create imagined goodness from them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.21 For
wealth, greed and power are like the dead, and they are not for the
living,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will likely be a hindrance at your resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.22
Your Goddess is one Goddess.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>As
for those that do not believe in the life to come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">their
hearts deny the plainest evidence, and they proudly reject the
truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.23
There is no doubt regarding that Goddess knows all they conceal, and all
they openly declare.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly,
She does not love pride.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.24 And
when it is said to the unbelievers, “What did your Lady send down to the
prophetess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They will
answer, “Nothing but fables from ancient times.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.25
Therefore, they are given to error, and they will have to bear their own
burdens without mitigation,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">up to the
day of their resurrection, when they will also see and grieve for the
others that</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they have
caused to lead astray.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.26
Their predecessors devised plots before this; but natural forces came
upon their building,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
was overthrown from the
foundations,<a href="#_ftn104" id="_ftnref104"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the roof fell, and disaster came to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
did not expect it, for they did not listen to their prophetesses.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.27
Also, on the day of their resurrection, they will cover themselves with
shame,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will ask, “What good did they do me, my earthly companions of wealth,
greed and power?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But those
who are wise will answer them saying that </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the day
of resurrection is a day of sadness for the unbelievers, when they see
what they have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.28
There are those whose souls the angels will take on the day of
death,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who have
acted unjustly, for they shall offer to make peace with death saying,
“We have done no evil.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But the
angels shall reply, “Yes but heaven already knows all the pain you have
caused others.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.29 And
they shall be tied to the earth, which is like the gates of hell,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where
they will remain and be born over again, through water and the spirit,
but without guardian angels,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will come back again and again to this miserable earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
the everlasting abode of the proud.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.30 But
for those that love Goddess, they will be asked,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“What was
sent down to you?”, they shall answer, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“The best
Good Book,” and for many of those that fail to do right may be given
rewards in this world;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
dwelling of the next life shall be better; and happy will be the
dwelling of the pious!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.31
Namely, the Garden of Eternal Love is the place which they shall enter,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">rivers
shall flow beneath the it; therein they will enjoy whatever they wish.
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus will
Goddess recompense the pious.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.32 To
the righteous, when they shall die at their time, the angels will take
their souls and say to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Peace be
upon you; and enter into Paradise, as a reward for what you have
done.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.33 Do
the unbelievers expect anything other than </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
angels will lovingly take their souls from their bodies,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or that
they will not review what they have done in their lives? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Many
acted likewise that came before them, and it was not injustice, and
Goddess did not destroy them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
ignored the angels and Goddess and turned away from them </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
there were warnings of difficulties to come, so they dealt unjustly with
their own souls.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.34 The
sadness of what they had done came back to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
reviewed their lives and saw divine judgment; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
event which they had previously scoffed at then came true for
them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.35 The
unbelievers say, “If Goddess had decreed it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then we
would not have worshiped the earthly idols of greed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">power and
wealth, nor would have our ancestors done so, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor would
we have forbidden things without Her direction.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But they
have free will and they actually chose this to be. So did those women
who came before them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But it is
the duty of the prophetess to do nothing other than public
preaching.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.36 We
have raised up in every nation a prophetess to warn and teach them with
love, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying
“Worship Goddess and avoid those that preach evil.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And some
of the people were those that Goddess directed, and some of them decided
to go astray.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">So walk
the earth and see what happens to those that ignore the
prophetesses.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.37 If
you, O prophetess, earnestly wish for them to be directed by
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
Goddess will not direct anyone who does not wish to be directed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
everyone has free will, but they will not have guardian angels to help
them on earth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.38 And
they swear most solemnly by Goddess saying, “Goddess will not raise the
dead.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Be
assured that the promise to raise the dead is true, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
better part of women and men do not know this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.39
Goddess will raise the dead so that She can show the </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unbelievers
that they were liars in saying such things and to show Her great love
for Her children.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.40
Certainly when heaven speaks to any person,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">what is
said is always the same, and we only need to say, “Be!” And it
is.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.41 As
for those that have fled their country for the sake of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">after
they had been unjustly persecuted,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
surely provide them an excellent habitation in this world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
reward of the next life shall be greater; if only they knew it.</span>

class=Section14&gt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.42
Those who persevere patiently, and put their trust in their Lady of
Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall not
fail to find happiness in this life, and in the world which is to
come.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.43 We
have not sent anyone before you prophetess, as a prophetess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">other
than mortal women that were given revelations.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Inquire
therefore, of those who have custody of Scriptures, so you know this
will be the truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.44 We
have sent from heaven evident miracles, and written revelations;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have sent you this great Korana, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
may declare unto womankind this love that which was sent down for them,
so they may reflect.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.45 Are
those who have plotted evil again prophetesses secure</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
Mother Nature will not cause the earth to cleave under them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or that
trials and tribulations will not come upon them, from a situation they
did not expect?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Should
not they desire to have a warning first? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.46 Or
that She will not allow a disaster to come to them during travel from
place to place, and in traffic? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.47 For
no one may elude the kind and loving power of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or that
She will not discipline them with trials and tribulations, yet love them
greatly at the same time.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For your
Lady of Light is truly gracious and merciful in granting you
respite.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.48 Do
people not consider the wondrous things which Goddess has created?<span

the angels do also,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
are not elated with pride, so as to distract from Her service;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.50
They love their Lady of Light, who is exalted above them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
perform all that they are commanded.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.51
Goddess said, “Do not take other negative goddesses besides Me, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for there
is but one Goddess, and revere Me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.52 To
Her belongs whatsoever is in heaven and upon the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
Her your obedience is eternally due.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Would you
therefor love any entity more greatly than Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.53
Whatever favors you have received certainly come from Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
evil afflicts you, only to Her do you make your supplications.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.54 But
when She takes a portion of the troubles from you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">behold
that a portion of you take on the former idols of wealth, greed and
power.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.55
This is how many people show ingratitude for the favors and respite
heaven has granted them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Delight
yourselves in the enjoyments of this life; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
hereafter you shall know that you cannot escape the review of your
life.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.56 And
yet many of you give your food and sustenance to the greedy and the
wealthy, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in order
to gain favors and corruption,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this is
part of the good that heaven has provided to you, the innocent.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">By
Goddess, you shall surely be amazed at your review of what you have
unjustly devised.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.57
Some attribute sons to Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but this
is not a concern of yours, for there is only One True Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But then
they prefer children of one certain gender over
another.<a href="#_ftn106" id="_ftnref106"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">her face
becomes saddened, and she is deeply afflicted;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she hides
herself from the people, because of the ill tidings which she has been
part of.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.59 She
considers whether she shall keep it with disgrace, or whether she could
bury it in the dust.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do they
not make an ill
judgment?<a href="#_ftn107" id="_ftnref107"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.60 But
for those who do not believe in the next life, this allegory of evil
should be applied,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and unto
Goddess are possessed the most sublime allegories.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.61 If
Goddess punished people for iniquity, there would not be a single living
person on the earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

gives them all a time of respite, until their time of judgment;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
their time shall come, they shall not be respited an hour,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor shall
a painful review of their life be anticipated.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.62
They attribute to Goddess what they dislike in themselves–hate,
violence, jealousy</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">self
centeredness and judgment, but their tongues utter a lie, namely,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that the
reward of paradise is for them and for those that practice such negative
actions and emotions.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">There is
no doubt that those that worship these nasty companions, will be
eternally on earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
is like hell fire for them, and they shall be born again to earth
immediately after death </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and a
review of their last lifetime.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.63 By
Goddess, we have sent messengers to the nations before you: but Evil
prepared works for them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Evil was
their patron in the earth world, and in that which is to come they will
suffer</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">additional
trials and tribulations.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.64 We
have not sent down the Book of the Korana to you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for any
other purpose, than you should declare the truth </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

many disagreements which currently exist;<span

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Goddess sends down water from heaven and causes the earth </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to revive
after it has appeared to have died. Certainly this is a sign of the
resurrection to people who listen.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.66 You
have also in cattle an example of instruction,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we have
given you to drink what is in their bellies; a liquor between digested
crumbs and blood,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">namely
pure milk, which is swallowed with pleasure by those who would drink
it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.67 And
of the fruits of palm trees, and of grapes, you may drink an inebriating
liquor, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and find
good nourishment. Certainly this is a sign to good people of
understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.68
Your Lady of Light spoke by inspiration to the bee saying,</span>

your Lady of Light.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Goddess has created you, and She will hereafter allow you to die at your
appointed time,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will be with you at your death; and some of you shall have your life
prolonged to a decrepit age,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
may forget what you once knew; for Goddess is wise and powerful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Goddess provides for some of you to excel over others in worldly
possessions; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet those
who excel often do not give to the needy what their right hand
possesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
others may become equal sharers
thereby.<a href="#_ftn110" id="_ftnref110"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

they then deny the generosity of Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Goddess has ordained you husbands from your own nations and tribes,

has bestowed on you good things for nourishment.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Will they
therefore believe in that which is in vain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
ungratefully deny the goodness and greatness of Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.73
They worship, besides Goddess, vain idols of wealth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">power,
greed and self centeredness, of which possess nothing to sustain
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">either in
heaven or on earth, and these idols have no power but to bring
unhappiness.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.74
Therefore do not liken anything unto Goddess, for Goddess knows, even
though you do not.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.75
Goddess propounds as a parable a slave, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who had
power over nothing, but the mistress was one upon whom heaven bestowed a
good provision, and who gave alms frequently, yet both secretly and
openly, gave her slave nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

these two be held equal? Goddess forbid!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">

them was born dumb, unable to do or understand anything, she was a

more quick, for Goddess is almighty.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.78
Goddess has brought you forth from the abdomens of your mothers; you
appeared to know nothing,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and so
She gave you the senses of hearing and seeing and understanding, that
you might give Her thanks.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.80
Goddess has also provided houses for habitations for you;</span>

has also provided you tents of the skins of cattle,</span>

has given you garments to protect you from the heat, </span>

They acknowledge the goodness of Goddess, but afterwards they deny the
same,</span>

a certain day we will raise a witness out of every nation;</span>

shall have been unbelievers shall not be suffered to excuse themselves,

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

when those who shall have been guilty of worshiping</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">their
false goddesses of wealth, power and greed, they shall say, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O Lady
of Light, these are our idols which we worshiped besides You.”<span

liars.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.87 And
on that day the wicked shall offer their submission to Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
false deities which they imagined to worship will abandon them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

for those who shall have been infidels, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and shall
have turned aside others from the ways of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">their
sadness will be greatly increased, because they will see how their
negative influence corrupted others, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
caused them to do evil and to turn away from goodness.</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.89 On
a certain day we will raise up in every nation those persons who have
suffered in such a manner, and we will bring the prophetesses as
witnesses and to explain what the souls will experience.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We have
sent down to you a Book of the Korana, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for an
explanation of everything necessary both as to faith,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and as to
living, and as a direction and mercy, with good tidings to true
Moslemas.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.90
Certainly Goddess commands justice, and the doing of good,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
giving to your kin what is necessary; and She forbids wickedness, and
iniquity and oppression;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
admonishes you that you may remember.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.91
Perform your covenant with Goddess, and when you enter into a covenant
with Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">do not
violate your oaths, after the ratification of them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">since you
have made Goddess a witness over you. Certainly Goddess knows all that
you do.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.92 And
do not be like those women that undo what she has

yourselves deceitfully,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
one party is more numerous than another party. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
Goddess only tempts you by this situation, and She will make that
obvious to you</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">on the
day of your resurrection, concerning all about which you now
disagree.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.93 If
Goddess had pleased, She would have certainly made you one
people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but She
suffered those that desired evil to be led to evil,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will direct those to goodness only those that desire goodness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
shall certainly see an account of what you have done, at the appointed
time.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.94
Therefore, do not take your oaths between yourselves deceitfully,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
your foot slips, after it has been steadfastly planted, and you taste
evil in this life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for then
you will have turned aside from the ways of Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will suffer grievous sadness at your resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.95 And
sell not the covenants of Goddess for a small price,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for with
Goddess is a better compensation given to you, if you are women of
understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.96
That which is with you will fail; but that which is with Goddess is
eternal;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will surely reward those who shall have persevered, according to the
utmost merit of their actions.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.97
Whoever works righteousness, whether they are female or male,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whoever is a true believer, we will surely raise her to a happy
life;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will give them reward, according to the utmost merit of their
actions.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

may preserve you from Evil driven away with stones;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.99 for
Evil has no power over those who believe,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
who put their confidence in their Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.100

patroness, </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
take idols of greed, wealth and power as their goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

When heaven substitutes in the Korana a changed verse</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">(and only
Goddess best knows the fitness of that which She revealed),</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
unbelievers say, “You are only a forger of these verses,”

greater part of them cannot discern truth from falsehood.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.102
Say, “The Holy Spirit has brought this good Book down from your Lady of
Light with truth; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that She
may confirm those who desire to believe,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it is
a direction and it brings good tidings to the Moslemas.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.103
Heaven also knows that such people say,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly
a certain woman teaches the prophetess to compose the Korana.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
tongue of the person that espouses such an idea is a foreign
tongue,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
tongue which the Korana is written in, is the easily tranlatable English
tongue.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.104
Moreover, as for those who will not believe in the signs of
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
will not direct them, and they will suffer sadness and grief</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">at the
time of their resurrection for all the good they might have accomplished
with their lifetime.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.105
Certainly they imagine only lies when they do not believe in the signs
of Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
really are liars.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.106
Whoever denies Goddess, after She has believed, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except a
person who was compelled to do so against her will,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but whose
heart continued steadfast in the true faith,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.107
This shall be their sentence, because they have loved the present life
above that which is to come,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and for
that Goddess will not force the unbelieving people to believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.108
There are those whose hearts, hearing and sight they have themselves
decided not to use,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
there are the negligent ones, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.109
but there is no doubt that they will see that they were in error on the
day of their resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.110
Moreover, your Lady of Light will be favorable to those who have fled
their country,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">after
having suffered persecution, and had been compelled to deny their faith
by violence,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">(for
compulsion of faith of anyone under threat of violence to person or
property is grave error),</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
who have since fought in defense of the true religion, and have
persevered with patience;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
the Lady of Light will be gracious and merciful to these faithful
believers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they have shown their immense sincerity.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.111 On
a certain day, every soul shall see what it has done during its
life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and every
soul shall be repaid that which it shall have wrought,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall not be treated unjustly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.112
Goddess propounds as a parable a city which was secure and quiet,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to which
Her provisions came in abundance from every place,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
people ungratefully denied the favors of Goddess bestowed unto
them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">wherefore,
when the natural disasters of famine, fear and distress came to
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there was
no warning, and no preparations were made </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
inhabitants suffered terribly for what they had ignored </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and for
the prophetess they had refused to believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.113
And now your prophetess has come to the women of the world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from
among themselves, and some people accuse her of imposture,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore,
those that do this, when the natural disasters come, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
suffer terribly, and will not listen to their prophetess out of the
hardness of their own hearts.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6.114 Eat
of what Goddess has given you for food, that which is lawful, good, and
healthy; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and be
thankful for the favors of Goddess, if you will serve only Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.115
She only forbids you to eat anything thing which has died by itself,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">anything
that which is toxic, or anything unhealthy.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">   </span>It does not matter that an animal was
sacrificed </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in the
name of another deity; for Goddess is one deity, and when one calls the
name of another deity,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they are
actually calling Her, and you need not be concerned with what other
religions do,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
you have so many other good things to do.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But as
for those who have been compelled by necessity to eat things which are
unhealthy, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">not
lusting or wilfully transgressing, Goddess will surely be grateful and
merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Be more
concerned about your fellow woman and what you say and do, rather than
what you eat.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.116
And do not allow your tongues to utter a lie saying,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“This is
lawful, and this is unlawful,” when it is not and you were not told by
Her to say this,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
would be devising lies concerning Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for those
that devise lies concerning Goddess will not prosper.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.117
They will have little enjoyment in this world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and in
that world which is to come, there they will be saddened as for what
they have done.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.118 As
for certain religions, they forbid themselves things which were not
necessarily unlawful, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and yet
Goddess never injured them, they injured only themselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.119
Moreover your Lady of Light will be favorable to those who do evil only
through ignorance, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
afterwards repent and amend,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
to these people will the Lady of Light be gracious and merciful, after
their repentance.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.120
Sarah was a model of true religion, obedient to her Goddess, liberal in
loving others, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
never idolized wealth, power or greed, and she cared greatly for her
people.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.121
She was also grateful for the benefits she received from Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">wherefore
Goddess chose her, and directed Her in the right way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.122
And heaven bestowed upon her much good in this world;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and in
the next she will surely be one of the righteous.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.123 We
have also spoken to you, O prophetess by revelation, saying, “The
religion of Sarah, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who was
liberal in loving others, and who never idolized greed, wealth or self
centeredness</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">certainly
exhibited a good and true religion.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.124
The Sabbath was only appointed to those persons who differed with their
prophetess concerning it, and the Lady of Light will not judge between
them on it, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">either
now or on the day of their resurrection, concerning what they differed
to, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
the Sabbath of love should be practiced each day.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.125
Invite women to the way of your Lady of Light, by wisdom,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and by
mild exhortation; and dispute with them in the most gentle of
manners,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
Lady of Light well knows who is rightly directed.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.126 If
you take vengeance on any, take vengeance with those that would hate and
be violent,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet do so
in a kind and loving way, using words only, never violence or
nastiness,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but if
you suffer insubstantial wrongs patiently, certainly this would be best
for you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.127
Therefore, bear oppression with patience and non violent
resistance;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but your
patience will never be practicable, unless without the assistance of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.128
And do not be grieved on account of the unbelievers;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
should you be troubled for that which they subtly devise;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">16.129

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

name of the most Merciful Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.1
Praises be to Her who transported Her servant by night,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from the
sacred temple of Mecca to the far temple of Jerusalem, the circuit of
which heaven has blessed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that we
might show some of our signs and miracles, for Goddess is She who hears
and sees all.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.2 And
we gave to Miriam the Book of the law,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
appointed the same to be a direction to the children of Israel,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we
commanded them, saying, “Beware that you do not take any negative

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.3 O

was a grateful servant.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.4 And
we expressly declared revelations to certain people in the Book of the
law,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">saying,
“You will surely commit evil in the earth twice, and you will be elated
with great

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.5 And
when the natural disaster loomed for the first of the unbelievers came
to pass, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we sent
to you our prophetess, who advised you to stay away from your homes on a
certain day, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that an
earthquake was to come, but many did not believe her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or her
message that Goddess was a loving Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
after the quake, when your neighbors searched the inner apartments of
your houses, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and found
you all dead, everyone then knew the believers from the unbelievers
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
was a sign and a miracle, to those who would believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.6
Afterwards, the new believers became your companions so that you could
evangelize others</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in your
turn, and we granted you increase in wealth and children,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
made you a more numerous people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.7
saying, “If you do well, you will do well to your own soul,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but if
you do evil, you will injure only your own soul.”<span

you were sent yet another natural disaster, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
came to pass, you were all in the temple, and it was utterly
destroyed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
you would not listen to your prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
had warned you that this calamity was to come, but out of the hardness
of your hearts,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and your
own stubbornness, you entered the temple to hear someone preach hate and
war,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

prepared a method of understanding for them, you need not be overly
concerned with it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.11
Many people pray for evil, as well as pray for good, for people can be
very hasty.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.12 We
have ordained the night and the day for two signs of our power;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">afterwards
we blot out the signs of the night, and we cause the sign of the day to
shine forth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
may endeavor to obtain plenty from your Lady of Light by doing your
business therein, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
you may know numbers of years, and the computation of time,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
everything necessary to you we have explained properly.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.13 The
fate of every evil person we have bound about their neck,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
will produce to them, on the day of their resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a device
by which their actions were recorded, which they may look upon, <span

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.14<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>and the angels will say to her, “Look
into the device to see clearly what you have done.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.15 The
believers are only directed to the advantages of their own souls;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
who shall err shall err only against the same;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">neither
shall any ladened soul be charged with the burden of another.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We do not
punish any people, as you understand this term,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
we always send every people a prophetess to warn them before
hand.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.16 And
when we know the plan that a natural disaster will strike and will
destroy a city, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we
command the inhabitants thereof, who live in affluence, to obey their
prophetess, but few will listen;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">most
continue to act corruptly therein, and when the disaster occurs, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
city is destroyed with utter destruction,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you then
understand that few ever listened to the prophetess who warned them to
leave.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.17 And
how many generations have been destroyed since Nora?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For the
Lady of Light sufficiently knows and sees the errors of Her
servants.</span>

we will bestow on her what has been predetermined;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

those that have acted with evil and malice, we appoint this hell on
earth for her abode;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she will
continue to live therein, and it will be like being scorched, covered
with ignominy,</span>

will be utterly rejected from mercy.</span>

also a true believer; the endeavors of such people are acceptable to
Goddess.</span>

these and on those, of the gifts of the Lady of Light;</span>

not set up other idols of wealth, greed and power </span>

negative emotions as companions with the one true loving Goddess,

you must submit to behave humbly towards them, out of tender affection,

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.25
Your Lady of Light well knows that which is in your souls,</span>

you are women of integrity, and She will be gracious to those </span>

sincerely desire to return to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.26 And
give to your kin their due, and also to the poor,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.28 But
if you turn from them, in expectation of the mercy which you hope from
your Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">at least
speak kindly to them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.29 And
do not let your hand be tied up to your neck out of greed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

it with vain unbounded expansion, lest you become worthy of </span>

and reduced to poverty.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.30
Certainly the Lady of Light will enlarge the bounty of whom She
pleases,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and will
be sparing to whom She pleases, for She knows and regards Her servants

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.31 Do
not kill your newborn infants for fear of being left in poverty;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

will provide for them and for you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
killing of newborn infants because you fear poverty is indeed great
error;</span>

Goddess will excuse those who suffer from mental illness, and also
should you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.32 Do
not betray your beloved, for it is wickedness, and an evil way.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If you

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.33 Nor
should you kill any person, for Goddess absolutely forbids it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
out of self defense or innocent mistake, and whosoever has been slain
unjustly,</span>

period;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but do
not put any murderer to death, and do not seek revenge by another’s
blood,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
victims should be assisted by the law in a fair manner in court.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.34 Do
not treat an orphan, or someone entrusted to your care unfairly,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless it
is to clearly improve it, until she reaches the age of majority,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
perform your covenants, for an accounting is fair and just.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.35 And
give full measure, when you measure anything, and weigh with a just
balance.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
better and easier for understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.36 And
do not follow rumor and innuendos,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where
facts have not been proven, or you do not truly know the facts,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
hearing and the sight and the heart, everyone of these will be examined
at the last day.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.37 Do
not walk proudly on the earth, because you cannot cleave the earth,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

you as tall as the mountains.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">  
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.38 All
of this is error in the eyes of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.39
These precepts are a part of the wisdom which thy Lady of Light has
revealed to you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Set up no
other idols of wealth, power and greed with Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
associate hate, greed, jealousy or other negative emotions with Her, for
she has no such companions,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
association with these may cause rejection and chastisements from
others.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.40 Has
your Lady of Light granted you sons, and taken sons from among the
angels?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This is
despite the fact that many of you prefer daughters to sons.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet you
may see many facets to the personality of Goddess, such that some see a
trinity in Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
having children as a woman bears children is not something that Goddess
does.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.41 We
have used various arguments and repetitions in the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
may serve as advice and knowledge to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet some
remain greatly disposed to fly from the truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.42 It
is only the unbelievers that say “If there were other sons or powerful
angels with Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
surely one would make an attempt against the throne of Goddess!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Because
the reality is that everyone on the other side works as one and is full
of peace and love and joy;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they do
not war against one another.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.43
Goddess forbid!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>You should not
listen to such nonsense.</span>

class=Section15&gt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
is One and has no such negative companions or sons.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But do
not bother with those that believe differently; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is
much more important to respect the religions of others, than it is to
create hate and negativity</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with your
neighbors, for life is difficult enough without additional
adversity.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.44 The
seven heavens praise Her, and the earth, and all that are in
them;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
do not understand their celebration of this; for She is gracious and
merciful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.45
When you read the Korana, the dark and grey entities</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">filter
this knowledge as if there were a veil between them and the knowledge of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.46 It
is as if they have a covering over their hearts, so they will not
understand it, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they do
not desire love, there is a thickness they build up themselves in their
own ears.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And when
you make mention in repeating the Korana of the Lady of Light, they turn
their backs to Her, they dispute the doctrine of Her absolute
love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.47
Heaven very well knows with what design they hearken to, when they
listen to Evil, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when they
privately discuss issues together, when the ungoddessly says, “You
follow only the insane.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.48
Behold all the negative epithets they bestow on their
prophetesses.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But they
are deceived; they cannot find any just occasion to reproach their
prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.49
Some people also say, “After we have been bones and dust, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">how can
we be raised to a new creature?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.50 You
should answer them, “If you were stones, or iron, or even some other
base creature, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">more
improbably is that your opinions will be raised to life.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.51 But
they will say, “Who shall restore us to life?” Answer, “She who created
you the first time”;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet they
will shake their heads at you saying, “When shall this be?” Answer,
“Perhaps the time is near.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.52 On
that day that you die, Goddess shall call you forth from where your
corpse is,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
shall obey, with celebration of Her praise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
shall think that your have tarried but only a little while.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.53
Speak to my servants that they speak mildly to the unbelievers, less you
exasperate them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for Evil
brings discord among them, and Evil is the declared enemy of
woman.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.54
Your Lady of Light knows you well, and She will have mercy on you
all,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
will never punish you in the manner that you on earth understand
it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but we do
not send a prophetess to be a steward over the people.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.55
Your Lady of Light knows all entities in heaven and on earth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Heaven
has bestowed particular favors on some of the prophetesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">some
preferably to others, and we gave Denise the psalms.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.56 Say
to the people, “Call upon those you imagine to be </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">your
idols of wealth, power and greed, and those negative emotions</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of hate,
jealousy and envy you associate with Goddess.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But none
of this will enable you to have freedom from harm or to create any harm
to others</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">through
negative spells and enchantments and vain desires.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.57
When you invoke such false concepts, you believe that this will allow
you to be closer to Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you also
hope for Her mercy, you dread fear from an imagined false angry
goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess has no anger, and does not create fear; you only create your own
fears.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.58
There is no city on earth that will not suffer some form of natural
disaster,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from time
to time, for the earth is a dangerous place, some will be destroyed or
nearly destroyed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">some will
appear to suffer grievous punishment, but this is not the case; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you all
have guardian angels and have been given means to mitigate or avoid such
actions. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">All of
this is written in our Book of eternal laws.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.59
Nothing hinders us from sending you signs and miracles, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
that many people say such actions are false or imagined.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We gave
certain people of Thelma a camel, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which was
a miracle visible to their sight, yet they dealt unjustly with
her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We do not
send a prophetess to strike terror, but to work miracles of love</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
compassion wherever she is welcomed in.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.60
Remember when heaven said to our prophetess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Certainly
your Lady of Light surrounds women by Her knowledge and power.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We
appointed a vision, which we showed you, and also the trees discussed in
the
Korana<a href="#_ftn121" id="_ftnref121"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">only for
a occasion of dispute to women, and not to strike them with
terror,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet some
of them were caused to make mistakes only more frequently.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.61
Remember when the angels were told “Worship Eve,” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
all worshiped her except Eblis, who said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Shall I
worship her whom You have created of dirt?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.62 And
he added to this, “What are You thinking that humans must be worshiped
above me? </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
if You grant me respite until the last day of resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I will
destroy her offspring, except for a very few.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.63
Goddess answered, “Begone from here, you evil
angel,<a href="#_ftn122" id="_ftnref122"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

I will grant you respite;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
whomever shall follow you will be greatly saddened on their day of
resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
will also have an ample reward for you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.64 And
Eblis will entice to vanity as many people as he can, by his voice, he
will do it, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and he
will assault them on all sides with horsemen and footmen, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and he
will share with them in their riches, and their children, and he will
make them promises,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
will be no more than deceitful promises.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.65 As
to my servants, you will have no power over them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for your
Lady of Light is a good protectress of those who trust in Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.66 It
is your Lady of Light who drives forward the ships for you in the
sea,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
may enrich yourselves of the abundance of Her mercy with commerce,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is merciful towards you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.67
When a misfortune comes to you at sea, the false deities of wealth,
power and greed </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">are
forgotten by you for a period of time, except Evil remembers them;
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet when
Goddess brings you to dry land, and you seem far from Her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">most of
you return to these idols, for people can be very ungrateful.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.68 Are
you really secure in your knowledge that you will not be</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">swallowed
up by even the dry land, or that there will not be great</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whirlwinds
driving the sands that will overwhelm you? These false negative
goddesses will not protect you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.69 Or
are you secure that you will not be sent out to sea again</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">where you
will find tempestuous winds where you might drown,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will not call on Her because you are truly ungrateful?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">There you
will find no entity to defend you against Evil, in your distress.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.70 Now
we honor the children of Eve with various privileges and
endowments,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have given them conveniences of carriage by land and by sea,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have provided food for them of good things; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have preferred them before many of our creatures, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">created
by us, by granting you great prerogatives.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.71 On
a certain day we will call all women to judgment together with their
prophetesses, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
they are called to look at their lives,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
look with great joy and happiness, and they will not have wronged
anyone.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.72 And
whomever was blind in this life, will likely be blind in the next
life,<a href="#_ftn123" id="_ftnref123"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and will
pass thereto quickly, and continue to wander from the path of
salvation,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
heaven and Goddess calls clearly to them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.73 The
unbelievers always have tempted their prophetess</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to wander
from the instructions that heaven has given to
her,<a href="#_ftn124" id="_ftnref124"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">[124]</span></span></span></span></a></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as if she
might change her instructions to something different,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and only
then they would like to have her as their friend.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.74 And
unless we had made you resolute, you might have inclined to them a
bit.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.75
Then we would have certainly have caused you to find </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">disappointment
on the day of your resurrection, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
would not have been any protection against this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.76 The
unbelievers had likewise almost caused you to leave this land,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that they
might have expelled you by force, but then they should not have tarried,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except a
little while until all became safe for you again.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.77
This is the method of dealing we prescribe to care for our prophetesses,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as we
have done for those which were sent before you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
will not find any change in our particular methods.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.78 It
is good to perform prayers during the setting of the sun,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">at first
darkness of night, and the prayers at sunrise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
angels pay particular attention to your prayers at sunrise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.79 And
watch some part of the night while engaged in prayer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as a work
of submission and your Lady of Light will raise you to an honorable
station.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.80 And
say, “O Lady of Light, have me enter Your realm with a favorable
entry,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and make
me come to You with favor, and grant me power to assist You.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.81 And
say “Truth has come, and falsehood has
vanished,<a href="#_ftn125" id="_ftnref125"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
falsehood is only of a short duration.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.82
Heaven has sent down the Korana which is a medicine and a mercy to the
true believers, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but it
will mean nothing to the unbelievers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it will
serve as something hateful, or a source of love and peace they do not
desire,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
find love and peace and joy and compassion to be a very difficult
thing,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or they
may pretend to be able to do it, but you will find out where they
stand.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.83
Oftentimes when we bestow favors on a person,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then they
draw away from us in an ungrateful manner,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but when
evil comes to them, they despair of our mercy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.84 Say
to the people, “Everyone acts in their own way,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but your
Lady of Light best knows who is truly directed towards Her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.85<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>The people will ask you concerning the
Spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Answer
them, “The Spirit was created at the command of the Lady of Light,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
may call upon Her to fill you with love and peace,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but woman
has no knowledge, except for very
little.”<a href="#_ftn126" id="_ftnref126"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.86 If
heaven pleased, you would not have received this information,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in which
case you would not have any assistance to find your way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.87 But
the mercy from your Lady of Light is immense towards you.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.88
Say, “Certainly if women and genii were assembled together,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
purpose of producing a Book like this Korana, they could not produce one
like it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though they might strive hard together to do so.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.89 And
we have given to women in this Korana every type of wonderful argument
and discussion, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
greater part of the people will refuse to believe it, out of
stubbornness.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.90 And
the people will say, “We will not believe this, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until you
cause a spring of water to gush out of dry earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.91 or
you must have a garden of palm trees and vines spring up and </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">create
abundance where there was none before,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.92 or
cause heaven to fall down upon us, and give it out in pieces to
us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or bring
down Goddess and the angels to vouch for you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.93 or
create a house of gold, or ascend a ladder to heaven,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">neither
will we believe by your ascending there alone, until you cause a Book to
descend to us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">bearing a
witness you are a true prophetess, only then will we believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Answer
them, “I am only a mortal woman as you all are, but I was sent as your
prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because I
can understand you and teach you best.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.94 But
nothing hinders women from believing, when direction has come to them,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">other
than they say, “Has Goddess sent us a mere woman for a
prophetess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.95
Answer them, “If the angels had walked on earth, familiar as any
inhabitants here,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then you
would have been sent an angel for a prophetess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.96 Say
to them, “Goddess is a sufficient witness between you and I,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
knows and regards highly each one of Her servants.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.97
Whomever desires to be directed by Goddess, she shall be rightly
directed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whomever does not desire to be directed by Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they will
not be directed by Her, for each person has free will.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And that
person will fall into error, because they have no one to assist them,
besides Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.98
This will be their destiny, because they do not want to believe </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in the
goodness of heaven’s signs and miracles, and they say, “When we are
reduced to dust and bones,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">how could
we ever be raised up as new creatures?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.99 Do
they not perceive that Goddess, who created the heavens and the
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">is able
to create new bodies, which are the same as their present body?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.100
Say to them, “If you possessed all the treasures of the mercy of the
Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you would
certainly refrain from using them for goodness, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for fear
of spending them, for many people are unnecessarily greedy.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.101 We
have before this gave to Miriam the power of working nine evident
signs.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Ask the
children of Israel, as to the story of Miriam, when she came to
Pharaoh,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Pharaoh said to her, “Certainly I believe that you, Miriam, have been
deluded by evil sorcery.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.102
Miriam answered, “You well know that no one has sent down these
miracles,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
the Lady of heaven and earth, and I believe that you, Pharaoh, are
indeed a lost soul.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.103
Therefore, Pharaoh sought to kill all the Children of Israel,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but he
was drowned instead, and all that were with him, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when the
miracle of the receding waters were not meant for any person</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who did
not have Goddess as a protectress.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.104
And we said to the children of Israel, after his destruction, “Dwell in
the land we promised you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and on
the day of the resurrection each of you will each see what you have done
during this life.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.105 We
have sent down this Korana with love and truth, and it has descended
with truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have not sent you this other than to be a bearer of good tidings,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
you should denounce those that say Goddess threatens anyone.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.106 We
have divided the Korana, revealing it in parcels,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
might read it to women with deliberation,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
have sent it down, causing it to be sent, as the occasion
required.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.107
Say to the people, “Whether you believe what is written in this
Book,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or you
chose not to believe, certainly those who have been favored</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
knowledge of the Scriptures which were revealed before it, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when the
same is shown to them, they fall down with their faces to the floor,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.108
worshiping, and they will say, ‘Our Lady be praised, for the promise of
our</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Lady of
Light has now been fulfilled.’”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.109
And they fall, with their faces to the ground, weeping, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
hearing of this increases their humility.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.110
Say to them, “Call upon Goddess, or call upon the Merciful One,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by
whichsoever of the two names you invoke Her, it is equal, for She has
the most excellent names.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Do not
pray loudly, nor do it in too low a voice, but follow the middle way
between these.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">17.111
You should say, “Praise be to Goddess, who is pure love and</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who has
no negative emotions, nor does She take any negative actions, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
admonishes you not to worship any false idols of greed, power or
wealth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
needs no one to protect Her from contempt,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
magnify Her by proclaiming Her greatness.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In the
name of the most Merciful Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.1 All
praise be to Goddess, Who has sent down to Her servants</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this Book
of the Korana, and has not filled it with corruption,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.2<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>but has made it correct in knowledge
and wisdom.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Tell the
unbelievers that they should love Her presence, as She bears good
tidings to all</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">especially
to those that are faithful and work righteousness, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
they should receive an excellent reward, namely paradise.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.3 In
this place they shall remain forever,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.4 and
in this Book She admonishes those that would associate with Her
any</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">negative
emotions of hate, jealousy, rage and envy, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
negative actions such as violence or threats to persons or
property,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.5 of
which matter they have no knowledge, nor did most of their
parents.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">A
grievous matter it is that they say such things: they speak only
lies.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.6
Perhaps you will kill yourself with grief after them, out of zeal for
their conversion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if they
do not believe in the revelation of the Korana.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.7
Certainly we have ordained whatsoever is on the earth belongs to Her,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
has given you many things for your ornamentation, that women might have
trials and tribulations</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and learn
and perfect, and we shall see which of them excel in their works.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.8 And
we will certainly reduce what was formerly on the earth to dust, at the
appointed time,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet none
will be afraid and they will be filled with love, peace and joy.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.9 Do
you not consider carefully the companions of the cave and of the persons
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">sleeping
in the cave were truly one of our
miracles?<a href="#_ftn128" id="_ftnref128"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.10
When the young women took refuge in the cave, they said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O Lady
of Light, grant us mercy, and cause your justice to mitigate our
troubles.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.11
Therefore heaven struck their ears with a deafness, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so they
slept without disturbance in the cave for a great number of
years.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.12
Then we awakened them, to see which of them could compute the time which
was spent sleeping.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.13 We
relate this tale to you as herstorical truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
they were young women who had believed in their Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
had abundantly shown them the right way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.14 And
we fortified their hearts with firmness when they stood before the
tyrant,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
said, “Our Lady of Light is creatress of heaven and earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
not call on any other deity besides Her, unless we become
impious.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.15
Despite this, our fellow people have taken the false gods of wealth,
power and greed besides Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
they bring no valid argument for this, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and who
is more unjust than to devise such a lie concerning Goddess?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.16 And
the angels instructed them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“When you
separate yourselves from the unbelievers, and from their false
idols,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
they worship, except Goddess, then escape to the cave, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">your
Goddess will pour Her mercy on you abundantly, and She will care for you
there to your advantage.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.17 And
you might have seen the sun, when it arose, to descend from the cave
towards the right hand,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
when it set, to leave them on the left hand, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
they were in the spacious portion of the cave.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>This was one of the signs of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Whomsoever
Goddess shall direct, she will be rightly directed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whoever seeks Evil will err, and will not find any entity to defend or
direct her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.18<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And if you had seen them, you would
have thought them to have been awake,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
they were actually sleeping, and we caused them to turn themselves to
the right, and to the left.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And their
dog stretched out his front legs into the mouth of the cave,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if you
would have seen such a sight, you would have turned and fled, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">filled
with fear at the sight of this
dog.<a href="#_ftn129" id="_ftnref129"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.19 And
so we awakened them from their sleep, that they might question one
another.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">One spoke
and asked, “How long have we tarried here?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
answered, “We have tarried only a day, or part of a day.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
others said, “Your Lady of Light best knows the time you have spent
here,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and now
send one of you with some money into the city,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and see
which of its inhabitants has the best and purest food, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
should purchase some food from him, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and let
him behave discretely, and not tell your tale to anyone.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.20
“Certainly if they come to assault you, they will stone you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or force
you to return to your prior negative religion, and then you will not
prosper, ever again.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.21 And
so we acquainted their people with what had happened to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so they
might know that the promise of Goddess is true,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
is no doubt of the resurrection and the last hour, which they had
disputed among themselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.22
Some people say, “The sleepers were three;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and their
dog was the fourth,” and others say, “They were five,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
dog was the sixth,” only guessing at a secret matter:</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
others say, “They were seven, and their dog was the eighth.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You
should say, “My Lady of Light best knows their number; none shall know
this number, except a few.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore,
you should not dispute with anyone over the number of sleepers,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">according
to what has been revealed to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
need not ask other religions concerning this matter.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.23 Do
not say of any matter, “I will certainly do this tomorrow”, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.24
unless you add, “If Goddess pleases.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>And remember your Lady of Light, when you forget something, and
say, “My Lady is able to direct me so that I may come closer to the
truth of a matter.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.25 And
the sleepers remained in the cave 300 years, and nine years
additional.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.26 Say
to the people, “Goddess knows best how long they continued in the cave,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
knows all the secrets of heaven and earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you are
not the one that directs Goddess to see for you.” No one has any
protectress besides Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor does
anyone share in what She does or intends to do here on earth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.27 You
should read what has been revealed to you, out of the Book of your Lady
of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
without making any changes therein. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">There is
no one who has the power to change the words of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
cannot escape to anyone else, should you even attempt it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.28
Behave yourself with firmness towards those who call upon</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the Lady
of Light morning and evening, and those who seek Her favor;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and do
not let your eyes turn away from them, seeking the pomp of this
life,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
should you obey those who neglect the remembrance of us.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.29 And
say to the people, “The truth is from you Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
let any person that desires to believe, believe,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whoever does not, leave them alone. A plan is prepared for the
unbelievers which is not punishment,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in the
manner you understand it to be, but they will be tied to the earth,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
like hell, flame and smoke, and it will be all around them, like a
pavilion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for many
regions of the earth have foul air and are either too hot or too
cold,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and if
they beg relief, they will not be helped, till they turn to Her, and
after they call upon Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then they
will receive paradise with water scented with roses; O how wonderful a
portion,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and how
happy a bed they will make.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.30 As
to those that believe and do good works,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
not suffer the reward of her who works righteousness to perish,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.31 for
them are prepared gardens of eternal abode, which shall be watered by
rivers;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will be clothed in green garments of fine silk and brocades; sitting on
thrones.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">O how
happy a reward they shall have, and how happy a bed they will have
made!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.32 And
propound to them, as a parable two women,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">one of
whom was given two vineyards, surrounded by palm trees, and corn grew
between them.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.33
Each of the gardens brought forth fruit every season,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">never
failing, and we caused a river to flow in the midst of the
garden.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.34 And
the owner had great abundance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>And she said to her friend by way of debate,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“I am
superior to you in wealth, and I have a more beautiful family.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.35 And
she went into her garden, being guilty of injustice against her own
soul,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
declared, “I believe this garden will never decay.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.36
“Nor do I think the last hour will ever come, and if I ever return to my
Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She will
give me an ever better garden in exchange for it!”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.37 And
her friend said to her, by way of debate,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Do you
not believe in your Goddess, who created you from a divine spark,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and then
by an ovum, and then shaped you into a perfect woman?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.38
“But for me, Goddess is my Lady; and I will not associate</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">any other
false idols of wealth, power and greed with Her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.39 And
when you enter your garden, will you not say, ‘What Goddess pleases
shall come to pass,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there is
no power but from Goddess alone?’</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Although
you see me to be inferior to you in wealth, number of children and
beauty,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.40 my
Lady of Light is well able to bestow on me even better gifts than this
garden, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
without your asking for Her protection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">stars may
naturally shoot from Heaven, destroying it completely.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.41
“Or, its water may sink back deep into the earth so that you will no
longer be able to draw it out.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.42 And
one day, her possessions were destroyed by the forces of nature, as her
friend had warned her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
began to turn down her hands with grief and regret, for what she had
done,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
vines fell down on the trails, and she said “I am sorry to Goddess that
I associated </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the false
idols of pride, greed and wealth with Her, above my love for
everyone.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.43 And
she had no entity to assist her besides Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">neither
was she able to defend herself against this loss,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but she
had to build up a new garden by herself again.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.44 In
such a case, the absolute right of protection belongs to Goddess alone,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She is
the best provider of rewards, and the best one to give success to
anyone.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.45 And
we also propound to the people an analogy of the present life.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It is
like water which we send down from heaven, and the herbs of the earth
are mixed with it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and after
it has become green and it flourishes, in the morning it may become dry
stubble,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which the
winds may scatter abroad, if Goddess is not present therewith, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is able to do all things.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.46
Wealth and children are like ornaments in this world, but good works,
which are eternal,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">are
better in the sight of the Lady of Light, with respect to receiving a
reward, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
are also better with respect to hope.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.47 On
a certain day we will cause the mountains to pass away, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
shall see the earth plain and even; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we will
gather the people together, and we will leave no one behind.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.48 And
they shall be set in front of the Lady of Light in distinct
order,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
shall say to them, “You have come before Me in simple white
garments,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so you
might appreciate the beauty which I have bestowed upon you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
some of you might have forgotten the promise of unending love that I had
made to you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as if I
would not perform that promise.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.49 And
the device which records everyone’s actions has been reviewed by you,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet some
were quite saddened because their life primarily caused pain to others,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
is shown therein, and they shall say, “Alas for us! But what is meant by
this review?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It has
omitted neither a small action nor a great one, but it clearly shows
all,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall peruse all that they have done in their last lifetime, shown
before their eyes,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess will not be unjust, but will be loving and kind.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.50
Remember when we said to the angels, “Worship Eve,” and they all
worshiped her, except Eblis,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who was
one of the genii, and he departed from the commands of his Lady of
Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Will you
then take him and his friends for your patrons besides Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">not
understanding they are not your friends? Miserable will be such a charge
to the ungoddessly!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.51 I
did not call them to be present at the creation of the heavens and of
the earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor even
at their own creation, nor did I take any seducer for an
assistant.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.52 On
a certain day, Goddess shall say to those that worship </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">wealth,
power and greed, “Call upon your experiences </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
wealth, power and greed, and see if any of these have ever helped
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or did
they protect you?”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And they will
see an entire valley of wisdom in this.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.53 And
the wicked shall be tied to the earth, and it will be like hell
fire,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will know that they come back time after time there,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will find no way to avoid this, unless they turn to Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.54 And
we have told may tales to you in the Korana, a parable of every
kind,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but many
people object on such trivial grounds.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.55 Yet
nothing presented in this Book should prevent any person from
believing,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">now a
true direction has come to them, and they should ask pardon from their
Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
that many wait until they see some disaster come to them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or to
someone they knew or did not know.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.56
Heaven does not send out messengers, but to bear good tidings,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
only denounce people who say Goddess is mean, jealous or
demanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Those who
do not believe, always dispute with vain arguments, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
attempt to render the truth to no effect;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
hold the signs of Goddess and the announcement of Love, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which is
given therewith, in derision.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.57 And
who is more unjust, than a person who has become acquainted</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with the
signs and miracles of the Lady of Light, and retires from them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
forgets what her soul has formerly required her to do?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
they have cast veils over their own hearts, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
they should understand the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
put into their own ears, a thickness to thwart their own hearing,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even if
you invite them to the true direction, they will not desire to be
directed forever.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.58 The
Lady of Light is gracious, endued with mercy, as if She punishes, but
she does not,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it makes
no difference to provide a hasty punishment,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor a
slow one, the soul does not learn anything by such base methods, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there is
only refuge in learning with Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.59 You
will observe that some former cities were destroyed, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but only
because they would not listen to us or our prophetesses.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.60 And
remember when Miriam said to her servant, Josana, daughter of
Nan,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“I will
not move forward one more inch, until I come to the place where the two
seas meet,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
will travel for a long, long time to do this.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.61 But
when they arrived at the meeting of the two seas, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
forgot their fish which they had taken with them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
fish jumped out from their control freely into the sea.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.62 And
when they had passed beyond that place, Miriam said to her servant,
“Bring us our dinner,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for we
are famished by our long journey.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.63 Her
servant answered, “Do you know what has happened to me?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">When we
went to our lodgings near the rock, I forgot the fish, but no one made
me forget the fish, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
Evil, so that I would not remind you of it. Then the fish jumped from me
by themselves into the sea,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of their
own accord, in a most wondrous manner.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.64
Miriam replied, “But that is what we originally were
seeking.”<a href="#_ftn130" id="_ftnref130"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And then
they both went back, returning the same way they came.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.65 And
coming to the rock, they found one of our servants</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to whom
we had granted mercy, and whom we had taught wisdom before.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.66 And
Miriam said to her, “May I follow you, that I might be taught</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">part of
the wisdom that you have been taught, as a direction to me?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.67 She
answered, “Certainly you could never be sufficiently patient to quietly
assist me in my work.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.68
“For how can you patiently suffer these things,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
without complete knowledge, you could not possibly understand</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">what I am
doing and why I am doing it.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.69
Miriam replied, “You will find me very patient, if Goddess
pleases,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
I be ever disobedient to you, Goddess willing.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.70 She
said, “If you will follow along with me, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then do
not ask me concerning any of my tasks,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until I
declare the true meaning thereof to you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.71 So
they both went to the seashore,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
went into a ship, and the Light Being made a hole in the ship, thereby
scuttling it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Miriam
said to her, “Why have you made a hole in this ship </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so that
people might drown?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">   </span>This is very
strange.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.72 She
answered, “Did I not tell you, that you could not bear what I might
do?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.73
Miriam said, “Please do not chide me, because I forgot,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
please do not impose upon me such an extreme difficulty </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as I was
never told exactly what you would do.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.74
Then they left the ship and went forth until they found a certain young
boy, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
watched as lightening struck him dead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Miriam
said, “How could you allow an innocent child to die,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
him having done anything wrong, and your powers are so great?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
now you have done something very unjust.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.75 She
answered, “Did I not tell you that you could not bear with me?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.76
Miriam replied, “You are right concerning that.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore,
if I ask you one more question regarding something that I can no longer
bear, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then I
will depart from your company.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.77
They went out, therefore, until they came to the inhabitants of a
certain city, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
asked some people there for food, but these people refused them
food.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But in
the city, they found a wall, which was ready to fall down,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
Light Being repaired it, and set it straight. Whereupon, Miriam said to
her, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“If you
wanted, you could have been paid well to do such a thing.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.78<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>The Light Being answered, “Now it is
time for us to go our separate ways,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but first
I will explain the significance of all this which you could not bear
with patience.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.79
“The vessel belonged to certain poor women who did their business in the
sea,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but I was
requested by them to render it unserviceable, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
there was an evil king that ruled over them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and he
repeatedly took their ship by force, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">though
they begged him not to, and he made war continually, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">though
his intended victims were to be soldiers that desired to fight,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but he
also regularly killed the elderly, women and children, ignoring the pain
he caused the innocent.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.80 “As
to the boy, he and his parents were true believers, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">however,
he was destined to suffer one of two deaths so they might learn
separation, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">loss of a
beloved and grief. In the first death, he was to suffer for a long
period of time, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">becoming
sicker and sicker each day. In the second death, he was to be found dead
by lightening </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">such that
the parents would never know what it was he actually died from, or if he
was murdered.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Because
of duties in paradise, he has now elected the shorter and quicker of the
two,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it is
written that if he so elected, I was to put him in the right place and
watch him die.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">In such a
manner his parents would also learn patience and forgiveness.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.81
“However, his parents will, in a few more years, have a new child in
exchange for him,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">one that
is very affectionate and kind towards them. So do not grieve for any of
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
believe that any injustice has occurred.” </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.82 “As
to the wall, it belonged to two orphan children in the city.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Beneath
it was a treasure hidden which belonged to them, and their mother was a
righteous person,</span>

<span

their Lady of Light was pleased that they had attained their age of

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

might now take their treasure, for they can see the hole in the
wall,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which I
built for them so that only they can see it and take out the treasure,
</span>

the mercy of the Lady of Light,</span>

did was commanded of me, not of my own will, but by the direction of
Goddess.</span>

Answer, “I will give you an account of her.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.84 She
was made powerful in the earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
gave her means to accomplish everything she pleased,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.85 and
she followed her way until she came to the place of the setting
sun;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.86
where she found that it had set that evening in a spring of black
mud,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
found near the black mud spring a tribe of people.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We said
to the ruler, treat all people with kindness and understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.87
This ruler answered, “Whosoever I determine shall commit injustice,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I will
punish them cruelly and with torture for Goddess in this world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then I
believe they will return to the next world, where Goddess will punish
them again,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a severe
punishment, and eternal torment in hell fire.” This is because the ruler
did not know </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this was
not permitted by Goddess, for she was not properly directly at this
time.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">So we
covered her eyes, and she found no one to harm.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.88 “I
believe that only those that do what is right, shall receive the most
excellent reward,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
will receive thereafter only the simplest of duties.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.89
Then she continued on her way, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.90
until she came to the place where she saw the sun rise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and at
that place she found a different tribe of people, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and this
tribe had not been given by heaven anything where they could shelter
themselves from the
sun.<a href="#_ftn132" id="_ftnref132"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.91
Thus it was, and we understood with our knowledge that there were great
military forces with her.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.92 And
she continued her journey from south to north, until she came between
two sets of mountains,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.93 and
she found yet a third tribe, one that could barely understand her
language.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.94 And
they said, “O great ruler, Gog and
Magog<a href="#_ftn133" id="_ftnref133"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

have wasted our land,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">might we
pay a tribute to you so that you could build a great barrier between us
and them?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.95 She
answered, “The power which my Lady of Light has strengthened me with
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">is better
than your payment, but help me vigorously, and I will set a strong wall
between you and them.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.96
“Bring me iron in large pieces, until it fills up the spaces between the
two sides of the mountains.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And she
said to the workers, “Blow with your bellows, until it makes the iron
red hot.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And she
said further, “Bring me molten brass, that we may pour this over all of
the iron.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.97
Wherefore, when this wall was complete, Gog and Magog could not scale
it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor could
they dig under it or through
it.<a href="#_ftn134" id="_ftnref134"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.98 The
ruler then said to them, “This is a mercy from my Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but when
the prediction of my Lady of Light shall come to be fulfilled,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the wall
will be reduced to dust, the people will war no longer, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
prediction of my Lady of Light is true.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.99 On
that day, the people will rise up and rejoice, like waves on an
ocean,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
trumpet shall sound, and all the people will gather in one body together
in love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.100
And as to those who believed in hell and punishment,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.101
their eyes will be opened and they will see the love of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for their
eyes were veiled from remembering this, and they could not hear Her
words.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.102 Do
the unbelievers think that Goddess will not love them and care for
them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they will take Evil for a protectress besides Me?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Although
many would like to believe it,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there is
no hell prepared as an abode for the infidels or the unfaithful,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for we
have more sophisticated plans for them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
cleanse their souls, provide them with experience and draw them closer
to Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.103
Say to the people, “Does heaven need to declare outright to you</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
whose works are in vain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.104
those whose endeavors in the present life have been wrongly
directed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
who think they do the work of what is right, so you will know
plainly?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.105
There are many who do not believe in the signs and miracles of the Lady
of Light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and when
they appear before Her, they will know that works of evil are in
vain,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and evil
works will not be accorded any weight on the day of their
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.106
This is not a reward, it is an assistance to the development of the
soul.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And while
life on earth is like hell, there is no other hell,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for those
that have disbelieved and did not understand Her miracles</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and Her
prophetesses will come to understand all this later,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
will all pass through many trials and tribulations along the way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.107
But as for those who believe and do good works,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
shall have the gardens of paradise for their eternal abode.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.108
They shall remain there forever, they will never desire any change
therefrom.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.109
Say to the people, “If the sea became as ink to write down all the words
of the Lady of Light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it would
run out, and this would happen, even if heaven were to provide </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">an equal
amount of sea as ink for a writing supply to Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">18.110
Say to the people, “Certainly I am only a woman, as you are.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It has
been revealed to me that your Goddess is only one Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">let her
who hopes to meet her Lady of Light do righteous works,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and let
her not make any other person who does not desire it, worship the Lady
of Light.<span style="mso-tab-count:2">              </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.2 This
is a commemoration of the mercy of the Lady of Light toward Anna
and<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Zacharias.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.3 When
Anna called upon the Lady of Light, invoking Her in secret,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.4 she
said, “O Lady of Light, certainly my bones are weak, my head has become
white,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but I
have never been unsuccessful in my prayers to You, O Lady of
Light.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.5 “But
now I fear my nieces, who will succeed me, for my husband is
impotent,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">wherefore,
give me a successor of my own body out of Your Love.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.6
“That She might be my heir, and She may be an heir to the family of
Jacklyn,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and grant
me O Lady of Light, that she will be acceptable to You.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.7 And
an angel answered her, “O Anna, certainly we bring you good tidings of
the birth of a daughter,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whose
name shall be Jane, and there has lived no one with this name
before.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.8 And
Anna said to the Lady of Light, “How shall I have a daughter, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">seeing
that my husband is impotent,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I am
now very old, and I am also frail.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.9 The
angel said, “So it shall be: your Lady of Light has spoken and said,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">‘this is
easy for me, since I created you before, when you were just a divine
spark.’”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.10
Anna said, “O Lady of Light, please grant me a sign.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The angel
replied, “Your husband will not be able to speak for three nights,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
he is in perfect health.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.11 And
she went to her husband and her people, telling them this,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and her
husband had already quit being able to speak, for no apparent
reason.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But her
husband, being a believer, went forth making signs to the people,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as if he
should say, “Praise Goddess,” in the morning and in the evening.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.12 And
we said to her daughter, “O Jane, receive the Book of the law, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to study
it and to observe it.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And we
bestowed on her great wisdom, while she was still a child.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.13 And
she received mercy from us, and purity of life, and she was a devout
person,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.14 and
she was dutiful toward her parents, and she was not proud or
rebellious.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.15
Peace was upon her the day she was born, and the day whereupon she would
die,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
day that she would be raised to eternal life.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.16 And
remember in the Book of the Korana, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the story
of Mother Mary, when she left her family to a place in the east,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.17 she
took a veil to conceal her and her husband from the people, so they
might be in peace,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
sent our spirit Gabrielle to her, and she appeared to her in the shape
of a perfect woman, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so as not
to make her afraid.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.18 But
she was afraid of the strange Light Being and said,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“I desire
to fly for refuge to the Merciful Goddess, that She may defend me from
you;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if you
love Goddess, you will not approach nearer to me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.19 She
answered, “Certainly I am a messenger of the Lady of Light </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I am
sent here to give you a holy child.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.20 She
replied, “How could that be that I should have a son,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">since I
have not been with a man and I am chaste.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.21
Gabrielle replied, “It shall be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>For everything is simple and easy for the Lady of Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
heaven shall do it, and this will be a sign to the people, and a mercy
from us,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for it is
an event miracle which has been decreed.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.22
Therefore she conceived a son, and she went away with him in her womb to
a distant place,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.23 and
the pains of childbirth came upon her near the trunk of a palm
tree.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She said,
in her great pain, “I wish to Goddess that I had died before this,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and had
become a thing forgotten, and lost in oblivion,”.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.24 And
she heard from beneath her, a voice saying, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Do not
be grieved, for Goddess has given you a river under you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.25 and
you should shake the body of the palm tree, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and it
will let fall ripe dates for you, easy to gather.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.26 You
should eat and drink and calm your mind. Also, if you see any person,
and they ask you, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">reply
that you have vowed silence to honor the Merciful Lady, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and that
you will speak to no one today.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.27 So
she brought the child to her people, carrying him in her arms.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They said
to her, “O Mary, how have you done this strange thing?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.28
“Understand that your father was a faithful and chaste husband, and so
was your mother.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.29 But
she made signs to the child to answer them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but they
said, “How could we speak to a child who is but an infant in the
cradle?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.30
Whereupon, the child said, “Certainly I am a servant of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She has
given me the Book of the gospel, and She has appointed me as Her
Prophet.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.31
“And She has made me blessed, wherever I am, and She has commanded me to
observe prayer,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and to
give alms, so long as I should live,”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.32
“and I will be dutiful towards my mother, and I will not be proud or
unhappy.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.33
“And peace shall be upon me the day when I was born, and on the day that
I will die,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and on
the day when I am raised to new life.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.34
This was Yeshua, the son of Mother Mary, the Word of Truth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet many
will have great doubts concerning him.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.35 It
is not for you to debate whether Goddess has a son, Goddess forbid you
should hurt another!</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">When
Goddess decrees a thing, She need only say, “Be!” and it is.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.36 And
certainly Goddess is my Lady of Light and your Lady; </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore,
serve Her, this is the right way.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.37 Yet
the religious sects differ among themselves concerning Yeshua,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but woe
shall come to those that are unbelievers, because of their appearance at
the last day.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.38 Do
you cause them to hear, or do you cause them to see?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You will
not on the day where they will come to review their own lives;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but the
ungoddessly will see their obvious error on this day.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.39 But
you should warn them of the day of sighing, when the matter will be
shown to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
now they are sunk in negligence, and do not believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.40
Certainly we will inherit the earth, and whatever creatures are therein,
and to us shall all return.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.41 And
remember Sarah in the Book of the Korana, for she was one of great
veracity, and a prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.42
When she said to her father, “O my dear father,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">why do
you worship greed, wealth and power, how does it help you see or hear
better?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">How does
it profit your soul in the end?”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.43 “O
my dear father, a degree of knowledge has been given to me,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which has
not been given to you, therefore follow me, and I will lead you to the
right way.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.44 “O
my father, serve not Evil, for Evil is not loved by Goddess.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.45 “O
my father, certainly I fear that you will suffer great trials</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
tribulations from the Merciful Lady because you find Evil to be a good
companion.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.46 Her
father answered, “Why do you reject my love of wealth and power,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">why do
you reject them, Sarah?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>If you do
not refrain from continually chastising me, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">I will
surely stone you to death, therefore leave me alone for a long, long
while regarding this.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.47
Sarah replied, “Peace be upon you, I will ask pardon for you from my
Lady of Light, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for She
is most gracious to me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.48
“And I will separate myself from you, at your request, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and I
will not love wealth and power as you do, and I will call upon my Lady
of Light;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">however,
it may be that I will not be as unsuccessful in calling upon my
Lady,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as you
are successful at putting your trust in what you desire.”</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.49 And
when she separated herself from her father, and from his worship of
wealth and power, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she was
given Iris and Jacklyn, each of them we made prophetesses.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.50 And
we bestowed upon them, through our mercy, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the gift
of prophecy, and children and wealth;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and we
caused them to deserve the highest commendations, and they did this all
very well.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.51 And
remember Miriam in the Book of the Korana,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for she
was sincerely
upright,<a href="#_ftn136" id="_ftnref136"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:

and was an apostle and a prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.52 And
we called to her from the right side of Mt. Sinai,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
caused her to draw near, and to speak with us privately. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.53 And
we gave her through our mercy, a sister Alana, a prophetess, for her
assistant.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.54
Remember also Emma in the same Books, for she was true to her promise
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and was
an apostle and a prophetess.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.55 And
she showed her family that to observe prayer and to give alms is good,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and she
was acceptable to her Lady of Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.56 And
remember

the same Book, for she was a just person, and a prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.57 And
we exalted her to a high

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.58
There are those to whom Goddess has been bounteous, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">some of
the prophetesses of the posterity of Eve,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and there
are some born of the prophetesses of those carried in the ark with Nora,
</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and of
the posterity of Sarah, and of Isabell, and those that heaven directs
and has chosen.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">When the
signs of the Lady of Light were read to them, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they fell
down and began to worship Her, and they wept for joy,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.59 But
succeeding generations came after them, and their people neglected
prayer, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
followed lust and false idols, and they fell into evil.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.60
Except she who repents, believes and does what is right, those persons
shall enter paradise,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and they
shall not in the least be wronged.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.61
Gardens of perpetual abode will be their reward, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which the
Lady of Light has promised to Her servants, as an object of
faith,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for Her
promise will surely come to be fulfilled.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.62 At
that time there will be no more vain arguments,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">only
peace, and their provision will be prepared for them both morning and
evening.</span>

worship Her and be frequent in prayer.</span>

names?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.67
Some people say, “After I have died, shall I really be brought back
alive from the grave?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.68 Do
not the people remember that Goddess created them before, </span>

nothing and surely She may easily do this again?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.69 But

which was the best of them,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a kind

excelling in outward appearance is completely in vain?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.75 Say
to the people, “Even those that live in error, </span>

Goddess only directs those that ask for Her direction,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and the
good works which they do will remain forever in the sight of the Lady of

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.79 By

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.85 On
a certain day, all the pious will be assembled together before Mother
Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in an
honorable manner, as ambassadors called into the presence of their
Queen;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.86 and
the wicked will be purified, as thirsty cattle are driven to drink
water,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.87 the
time of intercession will be over and will no longer be needed,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and those
that have received further covenants from the Merciful Lady, will
receive them at that time.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.88
Some say that the Merciful Lady has begotten a child,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.89 but
She does not bear children as a woman does, </span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor is
She ever born to earth as souls are,</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
She does send her Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost if you pray for them, these
are sent to the faithful. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And yet
some of you dispute over this, but it is not right to dispute to
hatred,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it is far
more important to love one another than to prove who is right. </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.90 For
the heavens will never be truly be torn asunder, nor will the earth
truly cleave in half,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor will
the mountains ever be overthrown and fall such that you will be afraid
and worried,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but you
will find that what you see now really was an illusion and
unreal;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for the
Lady of Light does not intend to destroy any of you, nor frighten
you,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for you
are all Her beloved children.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.91 The
destruction of the earth will never occur because</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">someone
says that Goddess has created a child that walked the earth.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.92 Why
is it all that you need to fight over whether or not She had a
child,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when your
lives are in such a disarray over hate, violence, rage, jealousy,
confusion</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
misunderstandings?</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.93
Certainly, there is no entity in heaven or upon the earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that does
not approach Goddess as a servant and assistant.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.94
Goddess encompasses all things by Her infinite knowledge and
power,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and She
numbers everything with exact computation,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.95 and
every one shall come to Her on the day of her resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">without
any of their helpers and followers they worshiped as negative
idols.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.96 But
as for those who believe and do good works, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
Merciful Lady will bestow upon them love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.97 We
have made the Korana easy for the tongue,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that you
may readily declare the promises of heaven to the pious,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and you
may denounce the beliefs among the people </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
Goddess is mean, jealous, demanding and nasty; for She is not; She is
pure love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">19.98 And
how many generations have we loved greatly </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that did
not return the love to Goddess and heaven?<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Yet She
perseveres in perfect love.</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Although
you see them no more, She did not destroy even a single soul, for She
does not destroy souls.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You may
not see the good ones any longer, but if you listen closely and become
alert to love,</span>

is said that when the prophetess entered the temple at Mecca that there
were 360 statutes, most of them negative male deities, and all she had
to say was “Truth has come, and falsehood has vanished” and the statutes
appear to topple over with just the touch of a stick.<span

were a problem circa 625 CE, the use of images and statutes should not
present a problem now, as long as they are positive ones and not
predominately males ones either.</span>
