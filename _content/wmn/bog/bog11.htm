<p>This light is come, amid all lights the fairest; born is the brilliant, far-extending brightness.<br> Night, hath yielded up a birth-place for the Morning.<br> The Fair, the Bright is come with her offspring; to her the Dark One hath resigned her dwelling.<br> Akin, immortal, following each other, changing their colors both the heavens move onward.<br> Common, unending is the Sisters' pathway; taught by the Goddess, alternately they travel.<br> Fair-formed, of different hues and yet one-minded, Night and Dawn clash not, neither do they travel.<br> Bright leader of glad sounds, our eyes behold her; splendid in hue she hath unclosed the portals.<br> She, stirring up the world, hath shown us riches: Dawn hath awakened every living creature.<br> Rich Dawn, she sets afoot the coiled-up sleeper, one for enjoyment, one for wealth or worship,<br> Those who saw little for extended vision. All living creatures hath the Dawn awakened.<br> One to high sway, one to exalted glory, one to pursue her gain, and one her labor:<br> All to regard their different vocations, all moving creatures hath the Dawn awakened.<br> We see her there, the Child of Heaven apparent, the young Maid, flushing in her shining raiment.<br> You sovereign Lady of all earthly treasure, flush on us here, auspicious Dawn, this morning.<br> She first of endless morns to come hereafter, follows the path of morns that have departed.<br> Dawn, at her rising, urges forth the living; who is dead she wakes not from her slumber.<br> As you, Dawn, hast caused Fire to be kindled, and with the Sun's eye hast revealed creation.<br> And hast awakened women to offer worship, you hast performed, for the Goddess a noble service.<br> How long a time, and they shall be together,--Dawns that have shone and Dawns to shine hereafter?<br> She yearns for former Dawns with eager longing, and goes forth gladly shining with the others.<br> Gone are the women who in the days before us looked on the rising of the earlier Morning.<br> We, we the living, now behold her brightness and they come nigh who shall hereafter see her.<br> Foe-chaser, born of Law, the Law's protectress, joy-giver, waker of all pleasant voices,<br> Auspicious, bringing food for the Goddesses' enjoyment, shine on us here, most bright, O Dawn, this morning.<br> From days eternal hath Dawn shone, the Goddess, and shows this light to-day, endowed with riches.<br> So will she shine on days to come immortal she moves on in her own strength, undecaying.<br> In the sky's borders hath she shone in splendor: the Goddess hath thrown off the veil of darkness.<br> Awakening the world with purple horses, on her well-harnessed chariot Dawn approaches.<br> Bringing all life-sustaining blessings with her, showing herself she sends forth brilliant luster.<br> Last of the countless mornings that have vanished, first of bright morns to come hath Dawn arisen.<br> Arise! the breath, the life, again hath reached us: darkness hath passed away and light approaches.<br> She for the Sun hath left a path to travel we have arrived where women prolong existence.<br> Singing the praises of refulgent Mornings with his hymn's web the priestess, the poetess rises.<br> Shine then to-day, rich Maid, on she who lauds thee, shine down on us the gift of life and offspring.<br> Dawns giving daughters to women, shining upon the woman who brings offerings,--<br> Mother of Goddesses, shine forth exalted.<br> Rise up, bestowing praise on our devotion all-bounteous,<br> Whatever splendid wealth the Dawns bring with them to bless the woman who offers praise and worship.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">IV.</h3>  
<p>Fain to bring light to homes of women the noble and active Goddess hath emerged from darkness.<br> She before all the living world hath wakened, the Lofty One who wins and gathers treasure.<br> Revived and ever young on high she glances. Dawn hath come first to our morning worship.<br> If, Dawn, thou Goddess nobly born, thou give fortune this day to all the race of mortals,<br> May the Goddess declare before the Sun that we are sinless.<br> Showing her wonted form each day that passes, spreading the light she visits each dwelling.<br> Eager for conquest, with bright sheen she comes. Her portion is the best of goodly treasures.<br> First among all sing forth, O joyous Morning.<br> Let our glad hymns and holy thoughts rise upward, for the flames brightly burning have ascended.<br> The far-refulgent Mornings make apparent the lovely treasures which the darkness covered.<br> The one departs and the other comes: unlike in hue day's, halves march on successive.<br> One hides the gloom of the surrounding Parents. Dawn on her shining chariot is resplendent.<br> She who has knowledge of the first day's nature is born refulgent white from out the darkness.<br> The Maiden breaks not the law of Order, day by day coming to the place appointed.<br> In pride of beauty like a maid thou go, O Goddess, to the lovers who longs to pleasure thee,<br> And smiling youthful, as you shines brightly, before your adoring lovers.<br> Fair as a lover embellished by her sister you show forth your form that all may see it.<br> Blessed art thou O Dawn. Shine yet more widely. No other Dawns have reached what thou attain.<br> In constant operation with the sunbeams,<br> The Dawns depart and come again and again assuming their wonted forms that promise happy fortune.<br> Obedient to the rein of Law Eternal give us each thought that more and more shall bless us.<br> Shine thou on us to-day, Dawn, swift to listen. With us be pleasure who worship.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">V.</h3>  
<p>Now this day,<br> My sun mother, Amaterasu<br> Now that you have come out standing to your sacred place,<br> That from which we draw the water of life,<br> Here I give to you.<br> Your long life,<br> Your old age,<br> Your waters,<br> Your seeds,<br> Your riches,<br> Your power,<br> Your strong spirit,<br> All these to me may you grant.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">VI.</h3>  
<p>The Sun comes, the darkness goes away,<br> The Sun comes, the Sun sets,<br> The darkness comes, the moon comes at night.<br> The day breaks, the Sun comes out,<br> The darkness goes away, the Sun comes.<br> The Moon comes out,<br> The Moon brightens the darkness,<br> The darkness departs;<br> The Moon comes out,<br> The Moon shines, taking away the darkness;<br> She goes along,<br> She has made bright the darkness, She sets.<br> The Sun comes out,<br> She follows the darkness.</p>
