<p align="center">Oh Goddess,<br> You Yourself are the Creator. Everything that happens is by Your Doing.<br> There is no one except You.</p>  
<p>You created the creation; You behold it and understand it.<br> Amongst all is the Light--You are that Light.<br> By this Illumination, that Light is radiant within all.<br> The Goddess is the Greatest of the Great. No one calls Her any less.<br> No one can estimate Her Worth. By speaking of Her, Her Greatness is not increased.<br> You are the One True Mistress of all the other beings, of so many worlds.<br> Come, my dear sisters and spiritual companions; hug me close in your embrace.<br> You have so many Creative Powers, Mistress; Your Bountiful Blessings are so Great.<br> So many of Your beings and creatures praise You day and night.<br> You have so many forms and colors, so many classes, high and low.<br> Meeting the True One, Truth wells up. The truthful are absorbed into the True Goddess.<br> Upon that Highest Plane of Sublime Beauty, stands the Grove of the Goddess.<br> By true actions, this human body is obtained,<br> And the door within ourselves which leads to the Grove of the Goddess, is found.<br> The True Goddess Herself knows all; She makes no mistakes.<br> She is the Great Gardener of the Universe.<br> First, She prepares the ground, and then She plants the Seed of the True Name.<br> The nine treasures are produced from Name of the One Goddess.<br> The blind have forgotten the Name of the Goddess.<br> Their comings and goings in reincarnation do not end;<br> Through death and rebirth, they are wasting away.<br> Without the Word of the Goddess, people wander lost in reincarnation.<br> Through the love of duality, multitudes have been drowned.<br> O mind, swim across, by focusing your consciousness on Her names.<br> As it pleases You, Mistress, You save me. There is no other for me at all.<br> In front of me, I see the forest burning; behind me, I see green plants sprouting.<br> We shall merge into the One from whom we came.<br> The True One is pervading each and every heart.<br> She Herself unites us in Union with Herself;<br> The True Mansion of Her Presence is close at hand.</p>  
<p>With each and every breath, I dwell upon You; I shall never forget You.<br> The more the Goddess dwells within the mind,<br> The more the lover of the Goddess drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.<br> Mind and body are Yours; You are my Mistress.<br> Please rid me of my hate, my jealousy, and my ignorance, and let me merge with You.<br> Everyone belongs to the One who rules the Universe.<br> The lover of the Goddess practices good deeds, and the truth is revealed in the heart.<br> True is the reputation of the true, within whom truth abides.<br> Those who meet the True Goddess are not separated again;<br> They come to dwell in the home of the self deep within.<br> O mind, don't cry out that you are hungry, always hungry; stop complaining.<br> The One who created the infinite species of beings gives sustenance to all.<br> The Fearless Goddess is forever Merciful; She takes care of all.</p>  
<p>O lover of the Goddess, She understands, and finds the Door of Liberation.<br> Those who keep the Goddess enshrined within their hearts are said to be blessed.<br> Placing mind and body in offering before the Goddess,<br> They conquer and eradicate jealousy from within.<br> Blessed and acclaimed is that lover of the Goddess, who shall never be defeated.<br> Those who receive Her Grace find Her;<br> Without Her Grace, She cannot be found.<br> In the Grove of the Goddess, peace is found,<br> Meditating on Her nine billion names night and day.<br> The truthful ones are not stained by hate.<br> Meditating on the Goddess, their minds remain pure;<br> The lovers of the Goddess shed their ego; attuned to her orgasm, they find peace.<br> The One Goddess is the Giver of all; She Herself bestows all blessings.<br> No one else has any say in this; She gives just as She pleases.</p>  
<p>O mind, vibrate and meditate forever on the Goddess; seek the Protection of Her Grove.<br> The Mistress of the Universe is the Treasure of Excellence; Her limits cannot be found.<br> She is not obtained by mouthing mere words, but by rooting out jealousy from within.<br> By Goddess' Grace, one remains blended with the True Name of the Creatrix;<br> This mind is very powerful; we cannot escape it just by trying.<br> In the love of duality, people suffer in pain, condemned to terrible punishment.<br> O mind, give up the love of duality.<br> The Goddess dwells within you; serving the Goddess, you shall find peace.<br> Engrossed in jealousy, the world perishes.<br> It dies and is re-born; it continues coming and going in reincarnation.<br> The self-willed do not recognize the Goddess;<br> They forfeit their honor, and depart in disgrace.</p>  
<p>The True Queen has written Her Order, which no one can erase.<br> The self-willed do not obtain the Grove of the Goddess' Presence.<br> The false are plundered by falsehood.<br> Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes.<br> Without the Goddess, there is utter darkness.<br> In emotional attachment to one lover, they have forgotten the Great Giver, the Giver of Peace.<br> Those who serve the True Goddess are saved;<br> They keep the True Goddess enshrined in their hearts.<br> By Her Grace, we find the Queen, and reflect on the True Word of the Goddess.<br> The desires of the mind are fulfilled, when one is filled to overflowing with Her orgasm.<br> One who fears, loves, and is devoted to the Dear Goddess day and night,<br> Sees Her always close at hand.<br> Doubt runs far away from the bodies of those,<br> Whose minds remain forever attuned to the True Word of the Goddess.<br> The Immaculate Mistress is found. She is True; She is the Ocean of Excellence.<br> Those who remain awake and aware are saved, while those who sleep are plundered.<br> They do not recognize the True Word of the Goddess, and like a dream, their lives fade away.<br> Like guests in a deserted house, they leave just exactly as they have come.</p>
