<p>I will sing of stately Aphrodite, gold-crowned and beautiful,<br> Whose dominion is the realm of love and beauty.<br> The moist breath of the western wind wafted<br> Her over the waves of the loud-moaning sea in soft foam,<br> And there the gold-filleted Graces welcomed her joyously.<br> They clothed her with heavenly garments:<br> On her head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold,<br> And in her pierced ears they hung ornaments of amber and precious gold,<br> And adorned her with golden necklaces over her soft neck and snow-white breasts,<br> Jewels which the gold-filleted Graces wear themselves whenever they go<br> To their Mothers' grove to join the lovely dances of the Devas.<br> And when they had fully decked her, they brought her to the Devas,<br> Who welcomed her when She saw her, taking Her by their hands.<br> Each one of them prayed that she might lead her home to be her girlfriend,<br> So greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Aphrodite.<br> Hail, sweetly-winning, coy-eyed Goddess of Love!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">II.</h3>  
<p>Shimmering-thron&eacute;d immortal Aphrodite,<br> Daughter of the Creatrix, Enchantress, I implore thee,<br> Spare me, O queen, this agony and anguish,<br> Crush not my spirit<br> Whenever before thou has hearkened to me--<br> To my voice calling to thee in the distance,<br> And heeding, thou hast come, leaving thy mother's<br> Golden dominions,<br> With chariot yoked to thy fleet-winged coursers,<br> Fluttering swift pinions over earth's darkness,<br> And bringing thee through the infinite, gliding<br> Downwards from heaven,<br> Then, soon they arrived and thou, blessed goddess,<br> With divine countenance smiling, didst ask me<br> What new woe had befallen me now and why,<br> Thus I had called thee.<br> What in my mad heart was my greatest desire,<br> Who was it now that must feel my allurements,<br> Who was the fair one that must be persuaded,<br> Who wronged you?<br> For if now she flees, quickly she shall follow<br> And if she spurns gifts, soon shall she offer them<br> Yea, if she knows not love, soon shall she feel it<br> Even reluctant.<br> Come then, I pray, grant me surcease from sorrow,<br> Drive away care, I beseech thee, O goddess<br> Fulfil for me what I yearn to accomplish,<br> Be thou my ally.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">III.</h3>  
<p>When jealousy surges through thy heart<br> Let not thy foolish tongue take part.<br> With my two arms, I do not aspire to touch the sky.<br> So, like a child after its mother, I flutter.</p>  
<p>Now lust shakes my soul,<br> A wind on the mountain overwhelming the oaks.<br> I know not what to do: I have two minds.<br> Face me, my dear one and unveil the grace in your eyes.<br> And a sweet expression spreads over her fair face.</p>  
<p>I love refinement and for me<br> Love has the splendor and beauty of the morning star.<br> I yearn and I seek.<br> To you, fair maidens, my mind does not change.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">IV.</h3>  
<p>I will sing of stately Aphrodite,<br> Goddess of Love, pan-erotic,<br> Who stirs up sweet passion<br> And subdues the tribes of mortal women<br> And birds that fly in air<br> And all the many creatures that the dry land rears,<br> And all the sea: all these love the deeds of Aphrodite.<br> Gold-crowned and beautiful,<br> Whose dominion is the cities of all sea-set Califas.<br> There the moist breath of the western wind<br> Wafted her over the waves of the loud-moaning sea in soft foam,<br> And there the gold-filleted surf-goddesses welcomed her joyously.<br> They clothed her with heavenly garments:<br> On her head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold,<br> And in her pierced ears they hung ornaments of platinum<br> And precious gold, and adorned her with golden necklaces<br> Over her soft neck and snow-white breasts,<br> Jewels which the gold-filleted surf-goddesses wear themselves<br> Whenever they go to their mother's house<br> To join the lovely dances of the Goddess.<br> And when they had fully decked her,<br> They brought her to the goddesses,<br> Who welcomed her when they saw her,<br> Giving her their hands.<br> Each one of them prayed that she might lead her home,<br> To share pleasure with her,<br> So greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Aphrodite.<br> Hail, sweetly-winning, coy-eyed goddess!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">V.</h3>  
<p>O Aphrodite!<br> In honor of thee I will hold this feast,<br> Feast and drain the goblet deep,<br> We, will dance and wildly leap,<br> And if thou grant the grace which I require,<br> Then when the dance is wildest, all the lamps<br> Shall be extinguished and we'll freely love!</p>
