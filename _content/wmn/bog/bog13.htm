<p>The gleaming stars all about the shining moon<br> Hide their bright faces, when full-orbed and splendid<br> In the sky she floats, flooding the shadowed earth<br> With clear silver light.</p>  
<p>Now rose the moon, full and silver,<br> While round stood the maidens, as at a shrine.<br> Thus sometimes, the women, tender footed,<br> Dance in measure round the fair altar,<br> Crushing the fine bloom of the grass.</p>  
<p>Come hither moon goddess, Selene, come,<br> And in golden goblets pour richest nectar<br> All mixed in most ethereal perfection,<br> Thus to delight us.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">III.</h3>  
<p>This many are the days<br> Since our moon mother<br> Yonder in the west<br> Appeared, still small;<br> When but a short space yet remained<br> Till she was fully grown,<br> This many days we have waited.<br> We have come to the appointed time.<br> My children,<br> All my children,<br> Will make offerings.<br> My mother, moon,<br> All my children will clothe you with offerings.<br> When you have arrayed yourselves in these,<br> With your waters,<br> Your seeds<br> You will bless all my children.<br> All your good fortune<br> You will grant to them all.<br> To this end, My mother:<br> May I finish my road;<br> May I grow old;<br> May you bless me with life.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">IV.</h3>  
<p>Sweet voiced Muses, daughters of the Goddess,<br> Well-skilled in song, tell of the long-winged Moon.<br> From her immortal head a radiance<br> Is shown from heaven and embraces earth;<br> And great is the beauty that arises from her shining light.<br> The air, unlit before, glows with the light of her golden crown,<br> And her rays beam clear, whensoever bright Selene<br> Having bathed her lovely body in the waters of Ocean,<br> And donned her far-gleaming, shining team,<br> Drives on her long-maned horses at full speed,<br> At eventide in the mid-month:<br> Then her great orbit is full<br> And then her beams shine brightest as she increases.<br> So she is a sure token and a sign to mortal women.<br> Hail, white-armed goddess, bright Selene,<br> Mild, bright-tressed queen!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">V.</h3>  
<p>Lovely Goddess of the bow!<br> Lovely Goddess of the arrows!<br> Of all hounds and of all hunting<br> Thou who wakest in starry heaven<br> When the sun is sunk in slumber<br> Thou with moon upon they forehead,<br> Who the chase by night preferrest<br> Unto hunting in the daylight,<br> With thy nymphs unto the music<br> Of the horn--thyself the huntress,<br> And most powerful: I pray thee<br> Think, although but for an instant,<br> Upon us who pray unto thee!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">VI.</h3>  
<p>"Luna! Diana! Selene!<br> Queen of all enchantresses<br> And of the dark night,<br> And of all nature,<br> Of the stars and of the moon,<br> And of all fate or fortune!<br> Thou who rulest the tide,<br> Who shinest by night on the sea,<br> Casting light upon the waters;<br> Thou who art mistress of the ocean<br> In thy boat made like a crescent,<br> Crescent moon-bark brightly gleaming,<br> Ever smiling high in heaven,<br> Sailing too on earth, reflected<br> In the ocean, on its water;<br> We implore thee give this sleeper,<br> Give unto this good woman<br> The great gift of understanding<br> What all creatures say while talking!"</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">VI.</h3>  
<p>O Selene, who brought me from the rest of last night<br> Unto the joyous light of this day,<br> Be Thou bringing me from the new light of this day<br> Unto the guiding light of eternity.<br> Oh! from the new light of this day<br> Unto the guiding light of eternity.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">VII.</h3>  
<p>In name of the Holy Spirit of the Goddess,<br> In name of the Mother of the Grove of peace,<br> In name of Persephone who took death off us,<br> Oh! in name of the Three who shield us in every need,<br> If well thou hast found us tonight,<br> Seven times better may thou leave us without harm,<br> Thou bright white Moon of the seasons,<br> Bright white Moon of the seasons.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">VIII.</h3>
