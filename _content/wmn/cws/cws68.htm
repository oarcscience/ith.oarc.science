</I><P>AND the Spirit of Wisdom gave counsel, whose is the angel of the innermost sphere, the brightest of the sons of heaven.</P>
<P>2. Lord Adonai, who createst, remember the souls beneath Thine altar.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>3. And put a firmament between them and Thee, to divide the upper from the nether, and the inner from the without.</P>
<P>4. And whereas there hath been but one, let there henceforth be twain, the form and the substance, the apparent and the real;</P>
<P>5. That they who are bound may remain in the outer element.</P>
<P>6. But to me Thou committest thine only begotten, who shall enter within the veil.</P>
<P>7. And God made a firmament in the midst of all being, and divided the spirit from the body.</P>
<P>8. And the firmament is the gate of the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>9. And God gave the keys thereof to the angel of the second sphere, whose spirit is the Spirit of Understanding.</P>
<P>10. He is Hermes, the mediator, for he mediates between the outer and the inner.</P>
<P>
</P>

<P>11. He is the transmuter and the healer, Raphael the physician of souls.</P>
<P>12. There is no riddle he shall not solve for thee, nor any solid he shall not melt, nor any wall he shall not pass through.</P>
<P>13. Many are his states and his aspects; his weight is as lead, he runneth like water, he is light as the mist of dawn.</P>
<P>14. Yet he is as a rock between earth and heaven, and the Lord God shall build his Church thereon;[F]</P>
<P>15. As a city upon a mountain of stone, whose windows look forth on either side.</P>
<P>16. And upon the left are the kingdoms of the world and the shapes of illusion; and upon the right are the heights of heaven and the kingdom of spirit.</P>
<P>17. And to him are committed the keys of the invisible, and of the Holy of Holies within the veil.</P>
<P>18. Whatsoever soul he shall bind, shall be bound in the outer and the nether.</P>
<P>19. And whatsoever soul he shall loose, shall be loosed in the inner and the upper.</P>
<P>20. He shutteth and no man openeth; he setteth free and none shall bind again.</P>
<P>21. And his number is the number of twain; he is the angel of the twofold states.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>22. And the waters below and above the firmament, are the evening and the morning of the second day.[G]</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">Hymn to Hermes</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></P>
<P>1. As a moving light between heaven and earth; as a white cloud assuming many shapes;</P>
<P>2. He descends and rises, he guides and illumines, he transmutes himself from small to great, from bright to shadowy, from the opaque image to the diaphanous mist.</P>
<P>3. Star of the East conducting the Magi: cloud from whose midst the holy voice speaketh: by day a pillar of vapour, by night a shining flame.</P>

<P>4. I behold thee, Hermes, Son of God, slayer of Argus,[H] archangel, who bearest the rod of knowledge, by which all things in heaven or on earth are measured.</P>
<P>5. Double serpents entwine it, because as serpents they must be wise who desire God.'</P>
<P>6. And upon thy feet are living wings, bearing thee fearless through space and over the abyss of darkness; because they must be without dread to dare the void and. the deep, who desire to attain and to achieve.</P>
<P>7. Upon thy side thou wearest a sword of a single stone, two-edged, whose temper resisteth all things.</P>
<P>8. For they who would slay or save must be armed with a strong and perfect will, defying and penetrating with no uncertain force.</P>
<P>9. This is Herpe, the sword which destroyeth demons; by whose aid the hero overcometh, and the saviour is able to deliver.</P>
<P>10. Except thou bind it upon thy thigh thou shalt be overborne, and blades of mortal making shall prevail against thee.</P>
<P>11. Nor is this all thine equipment, Son of God; the covering of darkness is upon thine head, and none is able to strike thee.</P>
<P>12. This is the magic hat, brought from Hades, the region of silence, where they are who speak not.</P>
<P>13. He who bears the world on his shoulders shall give it to thee, lest the world fall on thee, and thou be ground into powder.[J]</P>
<P>14. For he who has perfect wisdom and knowledge, he whose steps are without fear, and whose will is single and all-pervading;</P>
<P>15. Even he must also know how to keep the divine secret, and not to expose the holy mysteries of God to the senses of the wicked.</P>
<P>16. Keep a bridle upon thy lips, and, cover thy head in the day of battle.</P>
<P>17. These are the four excellent things,--the rod, the wings, the sword, and the hat.</P>
<P>18. Knowledge, which thou must gain with labour: the spirit of holy boldness, which cometh by faith in God; a mighty will, and a complete discretion.</P>
<P>19. He who discovers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the holy mysteries is lost.</P>
<P>20. Go thy way in silence, and see thou tell no man.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">An Exhortation of Hermes to his Neophytes</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>I. He whose adversaries fight with weapons of steel, must himself be armed in like manner, if he would not be ignominiously slain or save himself by flight.</P>
<P>2. And not only so, but forasmuch as his adversaries may be many, while he is only one; it is even necessary that the steel he carries be of purer temper and of more subtle point and contrivance than theirs.</P>
<P>3. 1, Hermes, would arm you with such, that bearing a blade with a double edge, ye may be able to withstand in the evil hour.</P>
<P>4. For it is written that the tree of life is guarded by a sword which turneth every way.</P>
<P>5. Therefore I would have you armed both with a perfect philosophy and with the power of the divine life.</P>
<P>6. And first the knowledge; that you and they who hear you may know the reason of the faith which is in you.</P>
<P>7. But knowledge cannot prevail alone, and ye are not yet perfected.</P>
<P>8. When the fulness of the time shall come, I will add unto you the power of the divine life.</P>
<P>9. It is the life of contemplation, of fasting, of obedience, and of resistance.</P>
<P>10. And afterwards the chrism, the power, and the glory. But these are not yet.</P>
<P>11. Meanwhile remain together and perfect your philosophy.</P>
<P>12. Boast not, and be not lifted up; for all things are God's, and ye are in God, and God in you.</P>
<P>13. But when the word shall come to you, be ready to obey.</P>
<P>14. There is but one way to power, and it is the way of obedience.</P>
<P>15. Call no man your master or king upon the earth, lest ye forsake the spirit for the form and become idolaters.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></P>

<P>16. He who is indeed spiritual, and transformed into the divine image, desires a spiritual king.</P>
<P>17. Purify your bodies, and eat no dead thing that has looked with living eyes upon the light of Heaven.</P>
<P>18. For the eye is the symbol of brotherhood among you. Sight is the mystical sense.</P>
<P>19. Let no man take the life of his brother to feed withal his own.</P>
<P>20. But slay only such as are evil; in the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>21. They are miserably deceived who expect eternal life, and restrain not their hands from blood and death.</P>
<P>22. They are miserably deceived who look for wives from on high, and have not yet attained their manhood.</P>
<P>23. Despise not the gift of knowledge; and make not spiritual eunuchs of yourselves.</P>
<P>24. For Adam -was first formed, then Eve.</P>
<P>25. Ye are twain, the man with the woman,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="cws69.htm#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and she with him, neither man nor woman, but one creature.</P>
<P>26. And the kingdom of God is within you.[K]</P>
