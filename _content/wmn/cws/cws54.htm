<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">(I)</H5>
<P>THE spirit absorbed in man or in the planet does not exhaust Deity.</P>
<P>Nor does the soul evolved upward through matter exhaust substance.</P>
<P>There remain, then, ever in the fourth dimension--the principium--above the manifest, unmanifest God and soul.</P>
<P>The perfection of man and of the planet is attained when the soul of the one and of the other is throughout illuminate by spirit.</P>
<P>But spirit is never the same thing as soul. It is always celestial energy, and soul is always substance.</P>
<P>That which creates is Spirit (God).</P>
<P>The immanent consciousnesses (spirits) of all the cells of a man's entity, cause by their polarisation a central unity of consciousness, which is more than the sum total of all their consciousnesses, because it is on a higher round or plane.</P>
<P>For in spiritual science everything depends upon levels; and the man's evolution works round spirally, as does the planetary evolution.</P>
<P>In this relation consider the worlds of form and formless worlds of Hind&ucirc; theosophy.</P>
<P>Similarly the soul of the planet is more than the associated essences of the souls upon it: because this soul also is on a higher plane than they.</P>
<P>Similarly, too, the consciousness of the solar system is more than that of the associated world-consciousnesses.</P>
<P>And the consciousness of the manifest universe is greater than that of its corporate systems.</P>
<P>But that of the unmanifest is higher and greater still: as, except in substance, God the Father is greater than God the Son.</P>
<P>

<P>The elemental kingdoms represent spirit on its downward path into matter.</P>
<P>There are three of these before the mineral is reached.</P>
<P>These are the formless worlds before the worlds of form.</P>
<P>They are in the planet, and also in man.</P>
<P>All the planets inhabited by manifest forms are themselves manifest.</P>
<P>After the form-worlds come other formless worlds, caused by the upward arc of ascending spirit: but these also are in the planet.</P>
<P>They are also in the man: and are the states of pure thought.</P>
<P>The thinker, therefore, who is son of Hermes, is as far beyond the medium who is controlled and who is not self-conscious, as the formless worlds of the ascending arc are beyond the formless worlds of the elemental, or descending, arc.</P>
<P>In the planet and in the man they only seem contiguous because each round is spiral.</P>
<P>But each round takes the One Life higher in the spiral.</P>
<P>Neither the planet-soul nor the man-soul goes over exactly the same ground again.</P>
<P>But perverse and disobedient will may reverse the direction of the spiral.</P>
<P>Individuals in whom the will so acts are finally abandoned by the planet to the outer sphere.</P>
<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">(3)</H5>
<P>The One Life is the point of consciousness.</P>
<P>The will is the impulse which moves it.</P>
<P>In the celestial the One Life is the Elohim; and the will is the Father.</P>
<P>The One Life is manifest by effulgence (the Son).</P>
<P>So, then, the will begets in substance the effulgence, which is the manifestation of the One Life.</P>
<P>In man and the planet the effulgence is dim and diffuse until it moves into the soul. Then only Christ is born.</P>
<P>The One Life is invisible until Christ manifests it.</P>
<P>Christ in man has for counterpart Adonai in the heavens.</P>
<P>So, then, the One Life is in the Father-Mother latently, until manifest by the Son (effulgence).</P>
<P><A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A></P>
<P>And the procession of the Holy Spirit is from the Father-Mother through the Son.</P>
<P>Herein is the difference reconciled between the Greek and Latin Churches.</P>
<P>The point of consciousness shineth more and more unto the perfect day of brightness ("Nativity of Christ" within man).</P>
<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">(4)</H5>
<P>The object of creation is the production of "Ancients."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>They are the first-fruits of the souls of the planets; or First Resurrection." (First in dignity, not in time.)</P>
<P>They are not themselves creators; but are regenerators of that which is created;</P>
<P>Being vehicles for the Holy Spirit, who is the regenerator, through Christ.</P>
<P>Because will can create only when it is in the abstract; the derived does not create.</P>
<P>The Father-Mother creates through Adonai by means of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>The will of the perfect man renovates through the effulgence of his One Life.</P>
<P>His Karma is poured out over the world to save mankind.</P>
<P>He is the Saviour through his precious life.</P>
<P>There are twenty-four Ancients, because there are twelve Avat&acirc;rs of the Lord, and every one is dual.</P>
<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">(5)</H5>
<P>Will, when it is derived through existence, begets Karma.</P>
<P>God has no Karma. God does not exist: God is.</P>
<P>Karma is the channel of initiation. God is not initiated.</P>
<P>The perfect man saves himself and saves others by his righteousness.</P>
<P>The two terms of existence are creation and redemption.</P>
<P>The first is God's work; the second is the work of Christ,--God in man.</P>
<P>The reason why the Ancient cannot create is because he is not infinite.</P>
<P>He is immortal, not eternal; he is derived, not self-subsistent.</P>
<P>His is the point of grace, not the point of projection.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A></P>
<P>The thrones of the Ancients are round about the Throne of God and below it.</P>
<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">(6)</H5>
<P>The lower self is the cause of the difference between man and nature.</P>
<P>This lower self is the unreal self, the magnetic states.</P>
<P>These magnetic states are the serpent, in whose folds all nature is involved (to man).</P>
<P>It is the serpent that tempts Eve, the soul.</P>
<P>How does this magnetic self arise?</P>
<P>It is a reflect, the pole of which is antithetic to the pole of the true self.</P>
<P>The perfect balance is to be in the centre or equator, between the two.</P>
<P>Nature has no lower self; consequently she is not self-conscious (does not know that she is "naked").</P>
<P>The centre of the true self is in eternity; the poles are in time.</P>
<P>The soul's proper seat is in the centre,--eternity.</P>
<P>When she is there, the man is in eternal life.</P>
<P>This centre is the tree of life.</P>
<P>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the condition of the cognisance of the two poles.</P>
<P>Eating the fruit of this tree is the act by which the soul beholds these two poles.</P>
<P>While she remained in her first state she was as nature is, seeing only one pole, the good, and not knowing herself.</P>
<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">(7)</H5>
<P>There are two modes of God,--the manifest and the unmanifest.</P>
<P>God manifest rises gradually through nature to meet God unmanifest.</P>
<P>Every level in nature rises out of itself to merge in every other level.</P>
<P>When the mind-plane is reached, God emerges thence as the soul, and looks upon himself.</P>
<P>That into which the soul looks <I>back</I> is the past of her journey,--time and nature.</P>
<P>That into which she looks <I>forward</I> is God,--spirit and eternity.</P>
<P>The point she has reached is eternal life,--the tree in the midst of paradise.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></P>
<P>The false self is the mirage in time.</P>
<P>As the planes evolved, their laws were the laws of God.</P>
<P>But backwards they are the laws of the Devil.</P>
<P>"A prayer said backwards is an evocation of the Evil One."</P>
<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">(8)</H5>
<P>The God manifest is the true self.</P>
<P>The God unmanifest is the Divine overshadowing, the true spouse of the soul.</P>
<P>To know one's self is no sin.</P>
<P>God planted the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P>
<P>The sin is in the retrogression towards the astral.</P>
<P>It is the giving of the apple to Adam.</P>
<P>Adam is commanded; Adam is rebuked.</P>
<P>From the moment of the fall, a new projection takes place, similar to that of God's first projection into time.</P>
<P>The wheel turns again, and all is done over again in the microcosm.</P>
<P>For the retrogression towards the intellectual (Adam) is a displacement of the centre.</P>
<P>It is a transference of the tree of life from the place of Eve (the soul) to the place of Adam.</P>
<P>The centre can be nowhere save in the meeting place of the two lines which intersect at right angles the two triangles of the "Seal of Solomon."</P>
<P>There can be but one point of centre, therefore the two trees represent two lines crossed.</P>
<P>When the One Life has reached the seventh kingdom, then is the Sabbath.</P>
<P>That is the point of return from Nature--God in Action--to God in God--Rest.</P>
<P>Seven for the outgoing, seven for the incoming.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">(9)</H5>
<P>Thought in nature is the law of God.</P>
<P>Thought in man is the law of God; because man is the offspring of nature, and there is but one law.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A></P>
<P>All the planes in nature express this thought in unison.</P>
<P>Law in one plane does not conflict with law in another plane. Therefore God is invariable in nature.</P>
<P>But in man there appears to be conflict of two diverse wills. How is this, and whence comes the will which conflicts with the law of God in man?</P>
<P>Man like the world, is constituted of many planes.</P>
<P>Each plane has its consciousness, and the medium of one plane is more responsive and powerful in expressing the will of God than that of another plane.</P>
<P>The same is true of nature's plane. It is a question of subtlety and rarefaction of media.</P>
<P>The cause of evolution is the constant convergence of radii.</P>
<P>That is,--the consciousness of the mineral plane has a tendency to express itself in a higher plane, <I>i.e.</I> as vegetable consciousness; and the vegetable as animal; and the animal as human; and the human as divine.</P>
<P>But when the human is reached, the whole process begins over again, <I>in petto</I>.</P>
<P>And in man unregenerate, the tendency is not from behind forwards, in upward order, but in downwards, or retrogressive series.</P>
<P>For in man all the planes are consubstantiate, and all their modes of law <I>obtain</I>. Some media are weaker or denser than others, and these are the lowermost and outermost,--" touching negation."</P>
<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">(10)</H5>
<P>As the earth in its whirling, or individuation, throws off its Karma, so it is with man.</P>
<P>It is through Karma that initiation occurs.</P>
<P>Karma is two-faced, good and evil. But only the good face reflects on us the divine light.</P>
<P>Diana is the moon; so also is Hecate.</P>
<P>The "moon" is good or evil, according to the condition of the postulant.</P>
