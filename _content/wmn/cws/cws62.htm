<P>BEFORE the beginning of things, before the generation of the heavens, the great and invisible God alone subsisted.</P>
<P>2. Even the God whose name is unspeakable, upon Whom no eye hath ever looked, whose nature no mind create can fathom.</P>
<P>3. In the bosom of the eternal were all the Gods comprehended, as the seven spirits of the prism, contained in the Invisible Light.</P>
<P>4. The Elohim filled and comprised the universe, and the universe was at rest.</P>
<P>5. There was no motion, nor darkness, nor space, nor matter.</P>
<P>6. There was no other than God.</P>
<P>7. For there was One only, the Uncreate and Self-subsistent.</P>
<P>8. But forasmuch as motion was conceived in the bosom of the Elohim, the Invisible Light moved on itself;</P>
<P>9. And gathering itself inward toward its axis, left beyond and without it another self.</P>
<P>10. So that where God was not, there was darkness and the abyss.</P>
<P>11. Yet had the darkness of itself no existence, for before the beginning God was all in all.</P>
<P>12. And that which had been God became darkness by the withdrawal of God.</P>
<P>13. So that the darkness is no entity, for it is the negation of being.</P>
<P>14. It is no presence, for where a presence is, there is God.</P>
<P>15. Neither can it produce, neither can it be manifested, neither can it be annihilated.</P>
<P>16. Yet, forasmuch as the darkness doth not comprehend God, it is as another self.</P>
<P>17. Not having power in itself, for all power is God's.</P>
<P>18. Neither having personality, for all personality is of God.</P>
<P>19. But unless there were again to be cessation of motion, there can be no extinction of negation.</P>
<P>20. It may be bounded, but never annihilated.</P>
<P>21. Whatever is, is of God; but God only is absolute and perfect being.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A></P>
<P>22. All things visible and invisible were potential in God before the beginning, and of God's fulness we have all received.</P>
<P>23. Inasmuch as anything is absolute, strong, perfect, true, insomuch it resembles God and is God.</P>
<P>24. Inasmuch as anything is out of reason, weak, divided, false, insomuch it approaches negation, and is of negation.</P>
<P>25. Now the Absolute, which is God, is Spirit.</P>
