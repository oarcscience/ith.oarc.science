<P>AS is the outer so is the inner: He that worketh is One.</P>
<P>2. As the small is, so is the great: there is one law.</P>
<P>3. Nothing is small and nothing is great in the Divine Economy.</P>

<P>corruption, and the condition to which sin hath reduced the work of God,</P>
<P>5. Meditate upon the aspect of a corpse; and consider the method of the putrefaction of its tissues and humours.</P>
<P>6. For the secret of death is the same, whether of the outer or of the inner.</P>
<P>7. The body dieth when the central will of its system no longer bindeth in obedience the elements of its substance.</P>
<P>8. Every cell is a living entity, whether of vegetable or of animal potency.</P>
<P>9. In the healthy body every cell is polarised in subjection to the central will, the Adonai of the physical system.</P>
<P>10. Health, therefore, is order, obedience, and government.</P>
<P>11. But wherever disease is, there is disunion, rebellion, and insubordination.</P>
<P>12. And the deeper the seat of the confusion the more dangerous the malady, and the harder to quell it.</P>
<P>13. That which is superficial may be more easily healed; or, if need be, the disorderly elements may be rooted out, and the body shall be whole and at unity again.</P>
<P>14. But if the disobedient molecules corrupt each other continually, and the perversity spread, and the rebellious tracts multiply their elements; the whole body shall fall into dissolution, which is death.</P>
<P>15. For the central will, that should dominate all the kingdom of the body, is no longer obeyed; and every element is become its own ruler, and hath a divergent will of its own.</P>
<P>1:6. So that the poles of the cells incline in divers directions; and the binding power, which is the life of the body, is dissolved and destroyed.</P>
<P>17. And when dissolution is complete, then follow corruption and putrefaction.</P>
<P>18. Now, that which is true of the physical, is true likewise of its prototype.</P>
<P>19. The whole world is full of revolt; and every element hath a will divergent from God.</P>
<P>20. Whereas there ought to be but one will, attracting and ruling the whole man.</P>
<P>21. But there is no longer brotherhood among you; nor order, nor mutual sustenance.</P>
<P>22. Every cell is its own arbiter; and every member is become a sect.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A></P>
<P>23. Ye are not bound one to another: ye have confounded your offices and abandoned your functions.</P>
<P>24. Ye have reversed the direction of your magnetic currents; ye are fallen into confusion, and have given place to the spirit of misrule.</P>
<P>25. Your wills are many and diverse; and every one of you is an anarchy.</P>
<P>26. A house that is divided against itself, falleth.</P>
<P>27. O wretched man; who shall deliver you from this body of death?</P>
