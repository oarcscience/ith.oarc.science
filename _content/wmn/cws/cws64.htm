<P>THEN from the midst of the Divine Duality, the Only Begotten of God came forth:</P>
<P>2. Adonai, the Word, the Voice invisible.</P>
<P>3. He was in the beginning, and by Him were all things discovered.</P>

<P>4. Without Him was not anything made which is visible.</P>
<P>5. For He is the Manifestor, and in Him was the life of the world.</P>
<P>6. God the nameless hath not revealed God, but Adonai hath revealed God from the beginning.</P>
<P>7. He is the presentation of Elohim, and by Him the Gods are made manifest.</P>
<P>8. He is the third aspect of the Divine Triad:</P>
<P>9. Co-equal with the Spirit and the heavenly deep.</P>
<P>10. For except by three in one, the Spirits of the Invisible Light could not have been made manifest.</P>
<P>11. But now is the prism perfect, and the generation of the Gods discovered in their order.</P>
<P>12. Adonai dissolves and resumes; in His two hands are the dual powers of all things.</P>
<P>13. He is of His Father the Spirit, and of His Mother the great deep.</P>
<P>14. Having the potency of both in Himself, and the power of things material.</P>
<P>15. Yet being Himself invisible, for He is the cause, and not the effect.</P>
<P>16. He is the Manifestor, and not that which is manifest.</P>
<P>17. That which is manifest is the Divine Substance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="cws65.htm#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
