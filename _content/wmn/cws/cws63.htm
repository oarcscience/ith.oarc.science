<P>IN the beginning, the potentialities of all things were in Elohim.</P>
<P>2. And Elohim. was twain, the Spirit and the Water,--that is, the heavenly deep.</P>
<P>3. Now the spirit of Elohim is original life, and the heavenly waters are space and dimension.</P>
<P>4. He is the line, and She is the circle.</P>
<P>5. And without them is void and darkness.</P>
<P>6. Now the Divine twain were from the beginning contained in the bosom of the One who was before the beginning:</P>
<P>7. Even God the nameless, invisible, unfathomable, unspeakable, motionless:</P>
<P>8. From whom proceeded the heavens--that is, the duality, spirit, and deep--and the earth--that is, spiritually, the beyond.</P>
<P>9. Now the beyond was without form and void, and darkness covered the face of it.</P>
<P>10. But the heavenly waters were covered by the Spirit of God.</P>
