<P>ALL Scriptures which are the true Word of God, have a dual interpretation, the intellectual and the intuitional, the apparent and the hidden.</P>
<P>2. For nothing can come forth from God save that which is fruitful..</P>
<P>3. As is the nature of God, so is the Word of God's mouth.</P>
<P>4. The letter alone is barren; the spirit and the letter give life.</P>
<P>5. But that Scripture is the more excellent which is exceeding fruitful and brings forth abundant signification.</P>
<P>6. For God is able to say many things in one, as the perfect ovary contains many seeds in its chalice.</P>
<P>7. Therefore there are in the Scriptures of God's Word certain writings, which, as richly yielding trees, bear more abundantly than others in the self-same holy garden.</P>
<P>8. And one of the most excellent is the history of the generation of the heavens and the earth.</P>
<P>9. For therein is contained in order a genealogy, which has four heads, as a stream divided into four branches, a word exceeding rich.</P>
<P>10. And the first of these generations is that of the Gods.</P>
<P>11. The second is that of the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>12. The third is that of the visible world.</P>
<P>13. And the fourth is that of the Church of Christ.</P>
