<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">CONCERNING THE "GREAT WORK," THE REDEMPTION, AND THE SHARE OF CHRIST JESUS THEREIN&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></H4>
<P>"FOR this cause is Christ manifest, that he may destroy the works of the devil."</P>
<P>2. In this text of the holy writings is contained the explanation of the mission of the Christ, and the nature of the Great Work.</P>
<P>3. Now the devil, or old serpent, the enemy of God, is that which gives pre-eminence to matter.</P>
<P>4. He is disorder, confusion, distortion, falsification, error. He is not personal, he is not positive, he is not formulated. Whatever God is, that the devil is not.</P>
<P>5. God is light, truth, order, harmony, reason: and God's works are illumination, knowledge, understanding, love, and sanity.</P>
<P>6. Therefore the devil is darkness, falsehood, disorder, discord, ignorance; and his works are confusion, folly, division, hatred and delirium.</P>
<P>7. The devil is therefore the negation of God's Positive. God is I AM: the devil is NOT. He has no individuality and no existence; for he represents the not-being. Wherever God's kingdom is not, the devil reigns.</P>
<P>8. Now the Great Work is the redemption of spirit from matter; that is, the establishment of the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A></P>
<P>9. Jesus being asked when the kingdom of God should come, answered, "When Two shall be as One, and that which is Without as that which is Within."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>10. In saying this, he expressed the nature of the Great Work. The Two are spirit and matter: the within is the real invisible; the without is the illusory visible.</P>
<P>11. The kingdom of God shall come when spirit and matter shall be one substance, and the phenomenal shall be absorbed into the real.</P>
<P>12. His design was therefore to destroy the dominion of matter, and to dissipate the devil and his works.</P>
<P>13. And this he intended to accomplish by proclaiming the knowledge of the Universal Dissolvent, and giving to men the keys of the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>14. Now, the kingdom of God is within us; that is, it is interior, invisible, mystic, spiritual.</P>
<P>15. There is a power by means of which the outer may be absorbed into the inner.</P>
<P>16. There is a power by means of which matter may be ingested into its original substance.</P>
<P>17. He who possesses this power is Christ, and he has the devil under foot.</P>
<P>18. For he reduces chaos to order, and indraws the external to the centre.</P>
<P>19. He has learnt that matter is illusion, and that spirit alone is real.</P>
<P>20. He has found his own central point: and all power is given unto him in heaven and on earth.</P>
<P>21. Now, the central point is the number thirteen: it is the number of the marriage of the Son of God.</P>
<P>22. And all the members of the microcosm are bidden to the banquet of the marriage.</P>
<P>23. But if there chance to be even one among them which has not on a wedding garment,</P>
<P>24. Such a one is a traitor, and the microcosm is found divided against itself.</P>
<P>25. And that it may be wholly regenerate, it is necessary that Judas be cast out.</P>
<P>26. Now the members of the microcosm are twelve: of the senses three, of the mind three, of the heart three, and of the conscience three.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A></P>
<P>27. For of the body there are four elements; and the sign of the four is sense, in the which are three gates;</P>
<P>28. The gate of the eye, the gate of the ear, and the gate of touch.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>29. Renounce vanity, and be poor: renounce praise, and be humble: renounce luxury, and be chaste.</P>
<P>30. Offer unto God a pure oblation: let the fire of the altar search thee, and prove thy fortitude.</P>
<P>31. Cleanse thy sight, thine hands, and thy feet: carry the censer of thy worship into the courts of the Lord; and let thy vows be unto the Most High.</P>
<P>32. And for the magnetic man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> there are four elements: and the covering of the four is mind, in the which are three gates;</P>
<P>33. The gate of desire, the gate of labour, and the gate of illumination.</P>
<P>34. Renounce the world, and aspire heavenward: labour not for the meat which perishes, but ask of God thy daily bread: beware of wandering doctrines, and let the Word of the Lord be thy light.</P>
<P>35. Also of the soul there are four elements: and the seat of the four is the heart, whereof likewise there are three gates:</P>
<P>36. The gate of obedience, the gate of prayer, and the gate of discernment.</P>
<P>37. Renounce thine own will, and let the law of God only be within thee: renounce doubt: pray always and faint not: be pure of heart also, and thou shalt see God.</P>
<P>38. And within the soul is the Spirit: and the Spirit is One, yet has it likewise three elements.</P>
<P>39. And these are the gates of the oracle of God, which is the ark of the covenant:</P>
<P>40. The rod, the host,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the law:</P>
<P>41. The force which solves, and transmutes, and divines: the bread of heaven which is the substance of all things and the food of angels; the table of the law, which is the will of God, written with the finger of the Lord.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A></P>
<P>42. If these three be within thy spirit, then shall the Spirit of God be within thee.</P>
<P>43. And the glory shall be upon the propitiatory, in the holy place of thy prayer.</P>
<P>44. These are the twelve gates of regeneration: through which if a man enter he shall have right to the tree of life.</P>
<P>45. For the number of that tree is thirteen.</P>
<P>46. It may happen to a man to have three, to another five, to another seven, to another ten.</P>
<P>47. But until a man have twelve, he is not master over the last enemy.</P>
<P>48. Therefore was Jesus betrayed to death by Judas: because he was not yet perfected.</P>
<P>49. But he was perfected through suffering: yea, by the passion, the cross, and the burial.</P>
<P>50. For he could not wholly die: neither could his body see corruption.</P>
<P>51. So he revived: for the elements of death were not in his flesh; and his molecules retained the polarity of life eternal.</P>
<P>52. He therefore was raised and became perfect: having the power of the dissolvent and of transmutation.</P>
<P>53. And God glorified the Son of Man: yea, he ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</P>
<P>54. Thence also the Christ shall come again: in power like unto the power of his ascension.</P>
<P>55. For as yet the devil is undissipated: the Virgin indeed has crushed his head; but still he lies in wait for her heel.</P>
<P>56. Therefore the Great Work is yet to be accomplished.</P>
<P>57. When the leaven shall have leavened the whole lump; when the seed shall have become a tree; when the net shall have gathered all things into it.</P>
<P>58. For in the same power and glory he had at his ascension, shall Christ Jesus be manifested from heaven before angels and men.</P>
<P>59. For when the cycle of the creation is completed, whether of the macrocosm, or of the microcosm, the Great Work is accomplished.</P>
<P>60. Six for the manifestation, and six for the interpretation: six for the outgoing, and six for the ingathering: six for the man, and six for the woman.</P>
<P>61. Then shall be the Sabbath of the Lord God.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
