<P>During the second wave of feminism in the 1960s and 70s a popular
slogan was "not the church, not the state, women shall decide their fate".
Matilda Joslyn Gage would have approved.
Vehemently anti-clerical, <I>Women, Church and State</I> was one of the first
books to draw the conclusion that Christianity is a primary impediment to
the progress of women, as well as civilization.
Then, as now, religious doctrine was used as a justification
for the dehumanization of
women, depriving them of civil, human, economic and political rights,
even denying them the right to worship alongside men.
Gage reviews extensive evidence of this complex.
From a 21st Century perspective it is both 
astounding how far we have progressed, and dismaying how
little has changed.

Gage was one of the first writers to emphasize the ancient Matriarchy and
the witch trials as key episodes of women's history.
Her statement that <A HREF="wcs07.htm#page_247">nine million</A> people
were killed during the witch trials
has been widely quoted; more recent estimates
range from 50 to 100 thousand, which does not lessen the horror.

This book had numerous typographical errors.
