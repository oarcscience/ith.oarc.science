# PREFACE.

    This work explains itself and is given to the world because it is
needed. Tired of the obtuseness of Church and State; indignant at the
injustice of both towards woman; at the wrongs inflicted upon one-half
of humanity by the other half in the name of religion; finding appeal
and argument alike met by the assertion that God designed the subjection
of woman, and yet that her position had been higher under Christianity
than ever before: Continually hearing these statements, and knowing them
to be false, I refuted them in a slight *résumé* of the subject at the
annual convention of the National Woman Suffrage Association,
Washington, D. C., 1878.

    A wish to see that speech in print, having been expressed, it was
allowed to appear in *The National Citizen*, a woman suffrage paper I
then edited, and shortly afterwards in "The History of Woman Suffrage,"
of which I was also an editor. The kindly reception given both in the
United States and Europe to that meager chapter of forty pages confirmed
my purpose of a fuller presentation of the subject in book form, and it
now appears, the result of twenty years investigation, in a volume of
over five hundred and fifty pages.

    Read it; examine for yourselves; accept or reject from the proof
offered, but do not allow the Church or the State to govern your thought
or dictate your judgment.
