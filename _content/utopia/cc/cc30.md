# CHAPTER XXIX.

### ELYSIUM

It was a bright and sunny autumn day. We were a very happy party.
Estella was disguised with gold spectacles, a black wig and a veil, and
she looked like some middle-aged school-teacher out for a holiday. We
took the electric motor to a station one mile and a half from Mr.
Jansen's, and walked the rest of the way. The air was pure and sweet and
light; it seemed to be breathed right out of heaven. The breezes touched
us and dallied with us and delighted us, like ministering angels. The
whole panoply of nature was magnificent; the soft-hued, grassy fields;
the embowered trees; the feeding cattle; the children playing around the
houses;--

"Clowns cracking jokes, and lasses with sly eyes,  
And the smile settling on their sun-flecked cheeks  
Like noon upon the mellow apricot."

My soul rose upon wings and swam in the ether like a swallow; and I
thanked God that he had given us this majestic, this beautiful, this
surpassing world, and had placed within us the delicate sensibility and
capability to enjoy it. In the presence of such things
death--annihilation--seemed to me impossible, and I exclaimed aloud:

                    "Hast thou not heard  
That thine existence, here on earth, is but  
The dark and narrow section of a life  
Which was with God, long ere the sun was lit,  
And shall be yet, when all the bold, bright stars  
Are dark as death-dust?"

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

And oh, what a contrast was all this to the clouded world we had left
behind us, in yonder close-packed city, with its poverty, its misery,
its sin, its injustice, its scramble for gold, its dark hates and
terrible plots. But, I said to myself, while God permits man to wreck
himself, he denies him the power to destroy the world. The grass covers
the graves; the flowers grow in the furrows of the cannon balls; the
graceful foliage festoons with blossoms the ruins of the prison and the
torture-chamber; and the corn springs alike under the foot of the helot
or the yeoman. And I said to myself that, even though civilization
should commit suicide, the earth would still remain--and with it some
remnant of mankind; and out of the uniformity of universal misery a race
might again arise worthy of the splendid heritage God has bestowed upon
us.

Mr. Jansen had closed up his forge in honor of our visit, and had donned
a new broadcloth suit, in which he seemed as comfortable as a whale in
an overcoat. Christina ran out to meet us, bright and handsome, all in
white, with roses in her curly hair. The sweet-faced old lady took her
to her arms, and called her "my daughter," and kissed her, and expressed
her pleasure that her son was about to marry so good and noble a girl.
Mrs. Jansen held back modestly at first, a little afraid of "the great
folks," but she was brought forward by Christina, and introduced to us
all. And then we had to make the acquaintance of the whole flock of
blue-eyed, curly-haired, rosy-cheeked little ones, gay in white dresses
and bright ribbons. Even Master Ole forgot, for a time, his enrapturing
hammer and nails, and stood, with eyes like saucers, contemplating the
irruption of outside barbarians. We went into the house, and there, with
many a laugh and jest, the spectacled school-teacher was transformed
into my own bright and happy Estella. The two girls flowed into one
another, by natural affinity, like a couple of drops of quicksilver;
each recognized the transparent

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

soul in the other, and in a moment they were friends for life.

We were a jolly party. Care flew far away from us, and many a laugh and
jest resounded.

"There is one thing, Christina," said Max, "that I cannot comprehend,
and of which I demand an explanation. Your name is 'Christina Jansen,'
and yet you appeared in public by the name of 'Christina Carlson.' Now I
refuse to marry you until this thing is explained; for I may be arrested
and charged with bigamy for marrying two women at once! I am willing to
wed 'Christina Jansen'--but what am I to do with 'Christina Carlson'? I
could be "happy with either were t'other dear charmer away.'"

Christina laughed and blushed and said:

"If you do not behave yourself you shall not have either of the
Christinas. But I will tell you, my dear friend, how that happened. You
must know that in our Sweden, especially in the northern part of it,
where father and mother came from, we are a very primitive people--far
'behind the age,' you will say. And there we have no family names, like
Brown or Jones or Smith; but each man is simply the son of his father,
and he takes his father's first name. Thus if 'Peter' has a son and he
is christened 'Ole,' then he is 'Ole Peterson,' or Ole the son of Peter;
and if his son is called 'John,' then he is 'John Oleson.' I think, from
what I have read in the books you gave me, Frank, that the same practice
prevailed, centuries ago, in England, and that is how all those English
names, such as Johnson, Jackson, Williamson, etc., came about. But the
females of the family, in Sweden, are called 'daughters' or 'dotters;'
and hence, by the custom of my race, I am 'Christina Carl's Dotter.' And
when Mr. Bingham asked me my name to print on his play bills, that is
what I answered him; but he said 'Christina Carl's Dotter' was no name
at all. It would never do; and so he called me 'Christina

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Carlson.' There you have the explanation of the
whole matter."

"I declare," said Frank, "this thing grows worse and worse! Why, there
are three of you. I shall have to wed not only 'Christina Jansen,' and
'Christina Carlson,' but 'Christina Carl's Dotter.' Why, that would be
not only bigamy, but *trigamy!*"

And then Estella came to the rescue, and said that she felt sure that
Max would be glad to have her even if there were a dozen of her.

And Frank, who had become riotous, said to me:

"You see, old fellow, you are about to marry a girl with a pedigree, and
I another without one."

"No," said Christina, "I deny that charge; with us the very name we bear
declares the pedigree. I am 'Christina Carl's Dotter,' and 'Carl' was
the son of 'John,' who was the son of 'Frederick,' who was the son of
'Christian;' and so on for a hundred generations. I have a long
pedigree; and I am very proud of it; and, what is more, they were all
good, honest, virtuous people." And she heightened up a bit. And then
Frank kissed her before us all, and she boxed his ears, and then dinner
was announced.

And what a pleasant dinner it was: the vegetables, crisp and fresh, were
from their own garden; and the butter and milk and cream and schmearkase
from their own dairy; and the fruit from their own trees; and the mother
told us that the pudding was of Christina's own making; and thereupon
Frank ate more of it than was good for him; and everything was so neat
and bright, and everybody so happy; and Frank vowed that there never was
before such luscious, golden butter; and Mrs. Jansen told us that that
was the way they made it in Sweden, and she proceeded to explain the
whole process. The only unhappy person at the table, it seemed to me,
was poor Carl, and he had a wretched premonition that

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

he was certainly going to drop some of the food on that brand-new
broadcloth suit of his. I feel confident that when we took our departure
he hurried to take off that overwhelming grandeur, with very much the
feeling with which the dying saint shuffles off the mortal coil, and
soars to heaven.

But then, in the midst of it all, there came across me the dreadful
thought of what was to burst upon the world in a few days; and I could
have groaned aloud in anguish of spirit. I felt we were like silly sheep
gamboling on the edge of the volcano. But why not? We had not brought
the world to this pass. Why should we not enjoy the sunshine, and that
glorious light, brighter than all sunshine--the love of woman? For God
alone, who made woman--the true woman--knows the infinite capacities for
good which he has inclosed within her soul. And I don't believe one bit
of that orthodox story. I think Eve ate the apple to obtain knowledge,
and Adam devoured the core because he was hungry.

And these thoughts, of course, were suggested by my looking at Estella.
She and Christina were in a profound conference; the two shades of
golden hair mingling curiously as they whispered to each other, and
blushed and laughed. And then Estella came over to me, and smiled and
blushed again, and whispered: "Christina is delighted with the plan."

And then I said to Max, in a dignified, solemn way:

'My dear Max, or Frank, or Arthur, or whatever thy name may be--and 'if
thou hast no other name to call thee by I will call thee devil'--I have
observed, with great regret, that thou art very much afraid of standing
up to-morrow and encountering in wedlock's ceremony the battery of
bright eyes of the three Christinas. Now I realize that a friend should
not only 'bear a friend's infirmities,' but that he should stand by him
in the hour of danger; and so to-morrow, 'when fear comes down upon you
like a house,' Estella and I have concluded

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

to stand with you, in the imminent deadly breach, and share your fate;
and if, when you get through, there are any of the Christinas left, I
will--with Estella's permission--even marry them myself 'For I am
determined that such good material shall not go to waste.'

There was a general rejoicing, and Max embraced me; and then he hugged
Christina; and then I took advantage of the excuse--I was very happy in
finding such excuses--to do likewise by my stately beauty; and then
there was handshaking by the old folks all around, and kisses from the
little folks.

Not long afterward there was much whispering and laughing between
Christina and Estella; they were in the garden; they seemed to be
reading some paper, which they held between them. And then that scamp,
Max, crept quietly behind them, and, reaching over, snatched the paper
out of their hands. And then Estella looked disturbed, and glanced at me
and blushed; and Max began to dance and laugh, and cried out, "Ho! ho!
we have a poet in the family!" And then I realized that some verses,
which I had given Estella the day before, had fallen into the hands of
that mocker. I would not give much for a man who does not grow poetical
when he is making love. It is to man what song is to the bird. But to
have one's weaknesses exposed--that is another matter! And so I ran
after Max; but in vain. He climbed into a tree, and then began to recite
my love poetry:

"Listen to this," he cried; "here are fourteen verses; each one begins
and ends with the word *'thee.'* Here's a sample:

"'All thought, all fear, all grief, all earth, all air,  
    Forgot shall be;  
Knit unto each, to each kith, kind and kin,--  
Life, like these rhyming verses, shall begin  
    And end in--*thee!*'

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

"And here," he cried, "is another long poem. Phœbus! what a name--

'Artesian Waters!'

Here Christina, Estella and I pelted the rogue with apples.

"I know why they are called 'Artesian Waters,'" he cried; "it is because
it took a great *bore* to produce them. Hal ha! But listen to it:

"'There is a depth at which perpetual springs  
    Fresh water, in all lands:  
The which once reached, the buried torrent flings  
    Its treasures o'er the sands.'

"Ouch!" he cried, "that one hit me on the nose: I mean the apple, not
the verse.

"'One knows not how, beneath the dark, deep crust,  
    The clear flood there has come:  
One knows not why, amid eternal dust,  
    Slumbers that sea of foam.'

"Plain enough," he cried, dodging the apples; "the attraction of
gravitation did the business for it.

"'Dark-buried, sepulchred, entombed and deep,  
    Away from mortal ken,  
It lies, till, summoned from its silent sleep,  
    It leaps to light again.'

"Very good," he said, "and now here comes the application, the moral of
the poem.

"'So shall we find no intellect so dull,  
No soul so cold to move,  
No heart of self or sinfulness so full,  
But still hath power to love.'

"Of course," he said; "he knows how it is himself; the poet fills the
bill exactly.

'It lives immortal, universal all,  
    The tenant of each breast; <span id="page_241">p. 241</span>  
Locked in the silence of unbroken thrall,  
    And deep and pulseless rest;  
Till, at a touch, with burst of power and pride,  
    Its swollen torrents roll,  
Dash all the trappings of the mind aside,  
    And ride above the soul.'

"Hurrah!" he cried, "that's splendid! But here's some more: *'To
Estella.'*"

But I could stand no more, and so began to climb the tree. It was an
apple-tree, and not a very big one at that, and Max was forced to
retreat out upon a limb, and then drop to the ground. But the young
ladies were too quick for him; they pounced upon him as he fell; and
very soon my precious verses were hidden in Estella's bosom, whence, in
a burst of confidence and pride, they had been taken to exhibit to
Christina.

"Yes," said Estella, "it was nothing but mean jealousy, because he could
not write such beautiful poetry to Christina." "Exactly," said
Christina, "and I think I will refuse to marry him until he produces
some verses equally fine."

"Before I would write such poetry as that," said Max, "I would go and
hang myself."

"No man ought to be allowed to marry," said Estella, "until he has
written a poem."

"If you drive Max to that," I said, "other people will hang themselves
rather than hear his verses."

And thus, with laugh and jest and badinage, the glorious hours passed
away.

It was growing late; but we could not go until we had seen the cows
milked, for that was a great event in the household; and "Bossy"
especially was a wonderful cow. Never before in the world had there been
such a cow as "Bossy." The children had tied some ribbons to her horns,
and little Ole was astride of her broad back, his chubby legs pointing
directly to the horizon, and the rest of the juveniles danced around

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

her; while the gentle and patient animal stood chewing her cud, with a
profound look upon her peaceful face, much like that of a chief-justice
considering "the rule in Shelley's case," or some other equally solemn
and momentous subject.

And I could not help but think how kindly we should feel toward these
good, serviceable ministers to man; for I remembered how many millions
of our race had been nurtured through childhood and maturity upon their
generous largess. I could see, in my imagination, the great bovine
procession, lowing and moving, with their bleating calves trotting by
their side, stretching away backward, farther and farther, through all
the historic period; through all the conquests and bloody earth-staining
battles, and all the sin and suffering of the race; and far beyond, even
into the dim, pre-historic age, when the Aryan ancestors of all the
European nations dwelt together under the same tents, and the
blond-haired maidens took their name of "daughters" (the very word we
now use) from their function of milkmaidens. And it seemed to me that we
should love a creature so intimately blended with the history of our
race, and which had done so much, indirectly, to give us the foundation
on which to build civilization.

But we must away; and Carl, glad to do something in scenes in which he
was not much fitted to shine, drove us to the station in his open spring
wagon; Estella, once more the elderly, spectacled maiden, by my side;
and the sunny little Christina beside Max's mother--going to the station
to see us off; while that gentleman, on the front seat, talked learnedly
with Carl about the pedigree of the famous horse "Lightning," which had
just trotted its mile in less than two minutes.

And I thought, as I looked at Carl, how little it takes to make a happy
household; and what a beautiful thing the human race is under favorable
circumstances; and what a wicked and cruel and utterly abominable thing
is the man who could oppress it, and drive it into the filth of sin and
shame.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

I will not trouble you, my dear brother, by giving you a detailed
account of the double marriage the next day. The same person married us
both--a Scandinavian preacher, a friend of the Jansen family. I was not
very particular who tied the knot and signed the bill of sale of
Estella, provided I was sure the title was good. But I do think that the
union of man and wife should be something more than a mere civil
contract. Marriage is not a partnership to sell dry goods--(sometimes,
it is true, it is principally an obligation to buy them)--or to practice
medicine or law together; it is, or should be, an intimate blending of
two souls, and natures, and lives; and where the marriage is happy and
perfect there is, undoubtedly, a growing-together, not only of spirit
and character, but even in the physical appearance of man and wife. Now
as these two souls came--we concede--out of heaven, it seems to me that
the ceremony which thus destroys their individuality, and blends them
into one, should have some touch and color of heaven in it also.

It was a very happy day.

As I look upon it now it seems to me like one of those bright, wide rays
of glorious light which we have sometimes seen bursting through a rift
in the clouds, from the setting sun, and illuminating, for a brief space
of time, the black, perturbed and convulsed sky. One of our poets has
compared it to--

"A dead soldier's sword athwart his pall."

But it faded away, and the storm came down, at last, heavy and dark and
deadly.
