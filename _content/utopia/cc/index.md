After the commercial success of [Atlantis, the Antediluvian
World](../../atl/ataw/index) and [Ragnarok](../../atl/rag/index), which
guaranteed him an income for the rest of his life, Ignatius Donnelly
published *The Great Cryptogram*, his attempt to prove that Francis
Bacon was the author of Shakespeare's plays. This turgid 1000 page
volume sunk like stone. Following a lecture tour of Britain, and an
unsuccessful third senatorial campaign, Donnelly turned to fiction. In
1889, Donnelly wrote Cæser's Column, a remarkably prescient utopian
science fiction novel.

Donnelly was attempting to cash in on the success of Edward Bellamys'
[Looking Backwards](../lb/index), published in 1888, which had been a
smash best-seller (300,000 copies in the first two years). Donnelly
published the book in 1890 under a pseudonym--an attempt to create
intrigue, which, as it turns out, was unnecessary. Cæser's Column hit
paydirt; and sold sixty thousand copies in the first year alone, mostly
by word of mouth.

This book could be subtitled *Two Weddings and an Apocalypse*. Like Jack
London's [The Iron Heel](../ih/index), Cæser's Column is a cautionary
tale set in the distant Twentieth Century. The year is 1988--ironically,
only a few years before 'the end of history' according to one theory.
Two trivial Victorian romantic arcs are grafted onto a deadly serious
novel of ideas. Donnelly scores some direct hits: he predicts
globalization, the triumph of Capitalism, air travel and air warfare,
biological and chemical weapons, medical advances, the erosion of
American democracy, liberal theology, and perhaps most remarkably, the
Internet. His misses include the continued use of horses for urban
transportation and his projection of the status of women and labor to
*minima* (which nonetheless serve as useful plot devices).

Somewhat confusing to contemporary sensibilities is his treatment of
Jews, which superficially may appear anti-Semitic. However, this is
misleading. Donnelly goes out of his way to include both heroes and
villians who are identified as Jewish. His depiction of Jews as part of
the late 20th Century ruling class was meant as an ironic touch, since
at the time the book was written they were an oppressed minority. This
would be similar to a contemporary science fiction novel postulating a
lesbian President in the year 2090.

The midsection of the novel is burdened with way too much exposition for
modern tastes (not to mention the two maudlin romantic subplots).
However, the pace picks up with the spectacular destruction of the
corrupt society he has constructed. One of his heroes ends up committing
tragic and brutal acts of revenge; the other ends up literally writing
the epitaph for modern civilization. Both are recognizably, in
hindsight, true inhabitants of the 20th Century.

Donnelly, in a departure from the genre, describes both a dystopia and a
utopia in the same work. In a bucolic coda to the savage body of the
novel, he outlines his ideal society, based on universal suffrage and
education, a non-metal based currency, and the strict prohibition of
compound interest. Like his hypothetical exiles from Ragnarok and
Atlantis, the protagonists end up creating a redoubt from which
civilization can be renewed.
