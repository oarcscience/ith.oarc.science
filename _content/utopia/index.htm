<P>The dream of a golden age, first expressed by
<A HREF="../cla/hesiod/index">Hesiod</A>,
and philosophical writings such as Plato's
<A HREF="../cla/plato/rep/index">Republic</A>,
has become
a recurring theme in literature.
Many have attempted to define the ideal society.
For some, the dream has turned into a nightmare, a dystopia.
This page includes the best of these speculations.
