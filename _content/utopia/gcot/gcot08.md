### Chapter Six

#### Administration

'The present evils of city life are temporary and remediable. The
abolition of the slums, and the destruction of their virus, are as
feasible as the drainage of a swamp, and the total dissipation of its
miasmas. The conditions and circumstances that surround the lives of the
masses of the people in modern cities can be so adjusted to their needs
as to result in the highest development of the race, in body, in mind
and in moral character. The so-called problems of the modern city are
but the various phases of the one main question: How can the environment
be most perfectly adapted to the welfare of urban populations? And
science can meet and answer every one of these problems. The science of
the modern city—of the ordering of the common concerns in dense
population groups—draws upon many branches of theoretical and practical
knowledge. It includes administrative science, statistical science,
engineering and technological science, sanitary science, and
educational, social and moral science. If one uses the term City
Government in the large sense that makes it -inclusive of this entire
ordering of the general affairs and interests of the community, and,
further, if one grasps the idea that the cheerful and rational
acceptance of urban life as a great social fact demands that the City
Government should proceed to make such urban life conduce positively to
the welfare of all the people whose lawful interests bring them together
as denizens of great towns, he will understand the point of view from
which this book had been written.'—ALBERT SHAW, *Municipal Government in
Great Britain* (1895).

I have in the fourth and fifth chapters dealt with the fund at the
disposal of the Board of Management, and have endeavoured to show, and I
believe with success, that the rate-rents collected by the trustees in
their capacity of landlords of the towns will suffice: (1) to provide
interest on the debentures with which the estate is purchased; (2) to
provide a sinking fund which will at a comparatively early date leave
the community free from the burden of interest on such debentures, and
(3) to enable the Board of Management to carry on such undertakings

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

as are elsewhere, for the most part, carried out by means of rates
compulsorily levied.

A most important question now arises regarding the extent to which
municipal enterprise is to be carried, and how far it is to supersede
private enterprise. We have already by implication stated that the
experiment advocated does not involve, as has been the case in so many
social experiments—the complete municipalization of industry and the
elimination of private enterprise. But what principle is to guide us in
determining the line which shall separate municipal from private control
and management? Mr. Joseph Chamberlain has said: 'The true field for
municipal activity is limited to those things which the community can do
better than the individual.' Precisely, but that is a truism, and does
not carry us one whit further, for the very question at issue is as to
what those things are which the community can do better than the
individual; and when we seek for an answer to this question we find two
directly conflicting views —the view of the socialist, who says: Every
phase of wealth-production and distribution can be best performed by the
community; and the view of the individualist, who contends these things
are best left to the individual. But probably the true answer is to be
found at neither extreme, is only to be gained by experiment, and will
differ in different communities and at different periods. With a growing
intelligence and honesty in municipal enterprise, with greater freedom
from the control of the Central Government, it may be found—especially
on municipally owned land—that the field of municipal activity may grow
so as to embrace a very large area, and yet the municipality claim no
rigid monopoly and the fullest rights of combination exist.

Bearing this in mind, the municipality of Garden City will, at the
outset, exercise great caution, and not attempt too much. The difficulty
of raising the necessary funds with which to carry on municipal
undertakings would be greatly increased if the Board of Management
attempted to do everything; and, in the prospectus to be ultimately
issued, a clear statement will be made of what the Corporation
undertakes to do with the moneys entrusted to it, and this will at first
embrace little more than those things which experience has proved
municipalities

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

can perform better than individuals. Tenants, too, will, it is obvious,
be far more ready to offer adequate 'rate-rents' if they are given
distinctly to understand to what purpose those 'rate-rents' are to be
devoted, and after those things are done, and done well, little
difficulty will be placed in the way of further appropriate extensions
of the field of municipal enterprise.

Our answer, then, to the question, what field is to be covered by
municipal enterprise, is this. Its extent will be measured simply by the
willingness of the tenants to pay rate-rents, and will grow in
proportion as municipal work is done efficiently and honestly, or
decline as it is done dishonestly or inefficiently. If, for example, the
tenants find that a very small additional contribution, recently made in
the shape of 'rate-rent', has enabled the authorities to provide an
excellent supply of water for all purposes, and they are convinced that
so good a result at so small a cost would not have been achieved through
the agency of any private undertaking working for a profit, they will
naturally be willing and even anxious that further hopeful-looking
experiments in municipal work should be undertaken. The site of Garden
City may, in this respect, be compared with Mr. and Mrs. Boffin's famous
apartment, which, the reader of Dickens will remember, was furnished at
one end to suit the taste of Mrs. Boffin, who was 'a dab at fashion',
while at the other end it was furnished to conform to the notions of
solid comfort which so gratified Mr. Boffin, but with the mutual
understanding between the parties that if Mr. B. should get by degrees
to be 'a high-flyer' at fashion, then Mrs. B.'s carpet would gradually
'come for’arder', whilst if Mrs. B. should become 'less of a dab at
fashion', Mrs. B.'s carpet would 'go back’arder'. So, in Garden City, if
the inhabitants become greater 'dabs' at co-operation, the municipality
will 'come for’arder'; if they become less 'dabs' at co-operation, the
municipality will 'go back’arder'; while the relative number of
positions occupied by municipal workers and non-municipal workers at any
period will very fairly reflect the skill and integrity of the public
administration and the degree of value which is therefore associated
with municipal effort.

But the municipality of Garden City, besides setting its face against
any attempt to embark upon too large a field of enterprise,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

will so frame its constitution that the responsibility for each branch
of the municipal service will be thrown directly upon the officers of
that branch and not be practically lost sight of because loosely thrown
upon the larger central body—a plan which makes it difficult for the
public to perceive where any leakage or friction may be taking place.
The constitution is modelled upon that of a large and well-appointed
business, which is divided into various departments, each department
being expected to justify its own continued existence—its officers being
selected, not so much for their knowledge of the business generally as
for their special fitness for the work of their department.

THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT

consists of:

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top"><p>(1) The Central Council.</p>
<p>(2) The Departments.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

THE CENTRAL COUNCIL

In this council (or its nominees) are vested the rights and powers of
the community as sole landlord of Garden City. Into its treasury are
paid (after provision has been made for landlord's rent and sinking
fund) all rate-rents received from its tenants, as well as the profits
derived from its various municipal undertakings, and these, we have
seen, are amply sufficient to discharge all public burdens without any
resort to the expedient of compulsory rates. The powers possessed by the
Central Council are, it may be noticed in passing, more ample than those
possessed by other municipal bodies, for whilst most of these enjoy only
such powers as are expressly conferred on them by Acts of Parliament,
the Central Council of Garden City exercises on behalf of the people
those wider rights, powers and privileges which are enjoyed by landlords
under the common law. The private owner of land can do with his land and
with the revenue he derives from it what he pleases so long as he is

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

not a nuisance to his neighbour; while, on the other hand, public bodies
which acquire land or obtain power to levy rates by Acts of Parliament,
can only use that land or spend those rates for such purposes as are
expressly prescribed by those Acts. But Garden City is in a greatly
superior position, for, by stepping as a quasi public body into the
rights of a private landlord, it becomes at once clothed with far larger
powers for carrying out the will of the people than are possessed by
other local bodies, and thus solves to a large extent the problem of
local self-government.

But the Central Council, though possessing these large powers, delegates
many of them, for convenience of administration, to its various
departments, retaining, however, responsibility for:

\(1\) The general plan on which the estate is laid out.

\(2\) The amount of money voted to each of the various spend.. ing
departments, as schools, roads, parks, etc.

\(3\) Such measure of oversight and control of the departments as is
necessary to preserve a general unity and harmony, but no more.

THE DEPARTMENTS

These are divided into various groups—for example:

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top"><p>(A) Public Control.</p>
<p>(B) Engineering.</p>
<p>(C) Social Purposes.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

GROUP A, PUBLIC CONTROL

This group may consist of the following sub-groups:

<div align="center">

|         |               |            |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Finance |               | Assessment |
| Law     |               | Inspection |

</div>

*Finance*

Into this department are paid, after making provision for landlord's
rent and sinking fund, all rate-rents; and out of it the necessary sums
for the various departments are voted by the Central Council.

*Assessment*

This department receives all applications from would-be

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

tenants, and fixes the rate-rent to be paid—such rate-rents not,
however, being fixed arbitrarily by the department, but upon the
essential principle adopted by other Assessment Committees —the really
determining factor being the rate-rent which an average tenant is found
willing to pay. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14)

*Law*

This department settles the terms and conditions under which leases
shall be granted, and the nature of the covenants to be entered into by
and with the Central Council.

*Inspection*

This department carries out such reasonable duties in relation to
inspection as the municipality, in its capacity of landlord, may with
the tenants of the municipality mutually agree upon.

GROUP B, ENGINEERING

This group may consist of the following departments—some of which would
be later creations.

<div align="center">

|                                       |                           |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Roads                                 | Parks and open spaces     |
| Subways                               | Drainage                  |
| Sewers                                | Canals                    |
| Tramways                              | Irrigation                |
| Municipal Railway                     | Water-supply              |
| Public Buildings (other than schools) | Motive-power and Lighting |
|                                       | Messages                  |

</div>

GROUP C, SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL

This group is also divided into various departments, dealing with:

<div align="center">

|                       |            |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Education             | Libraries  |
| Baths and Wash-houses |            |
| Music                 | Recreation |

</div>

*Election of Members of Board of Management*

Members (who may be men or women) are elected by the rate-renters to
serve on one or more departments, and the

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Chairmen and
Vice-Chairmen of the departments constitute the Central Council.

Under such a constitution it is believed that the community would have
the readiest means of rightly estimating the work of its servants, and,
at election times, would have clear and distinct issues brought before
it. The candidates would not be expected to specify their views upon a
hundred and one questions of municipal policy upon which they had no
definite opinions, and which would probably not give rise within their
term of office to the necessity for recording their votes, but would
simply state their views as to some special question or group of
questions, a sound opinion upon which would be of urgent importance to
the electors, because immediately connected with the welfare of the
town.
