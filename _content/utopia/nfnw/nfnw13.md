### CHAPTER XIII: CONCERNING POLITICS

Said I: "How do you manage with politics?"

Said Hammond, smiling: "I am glad that it is of ME that you ask that
question; I do believe that anybody else would make you explain
yourself, or try to do so, till you were sickened of asking questions.
Indeed, I believe I am the only man in England who would know what you
mean; and since I know, I will answer your question briefly by saying
that we are very well off as to politics,—because we have none. If ever
you make a book out of this conversation, put this in a chapter by
itself, after the model of old Horrebow's Snakes in Iceland."

"I will," said I.
