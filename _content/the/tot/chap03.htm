  <h1 align="center">THE FORMATION OF A SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>

  <p align="left"><font size="3">THE beginning of the universe (if ever it had a beginning) is beyond our ken. At the
  earliest point of history that we can reach, the two great opposites of spirit and matter, of life and form, are
  already in full activity. We find that the ordinary conception of matter needs a revision, for what are commonly
  called force and matter are in reality only two varieties of Spirit at different stages in evolution and the real
  matter or basis of everything lies in the background unperceived. A French scientist has recently said: &quot;There
  is no matter; there are nothing but holes in the æther.&quot; This also agrees with the celebrated theory of
  Professor Osborne Reynolds. Occult investigation shows this to be the correct view, and in that way explains what
  Oriental sacred books mean when they say that matter is an illusion.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The ultimate root-matter as seen at our level is what scientists call the æther of
     space.[<a name="text02" href="#foot02">2</a>] To every physical sense the space occupied by it appears empty, yet
     in</font> <font size="3">reality this aether is far denser than anything of which we can conceive. Its density is
     defined by Professor Reynolds as being ten thousand times greater than that of water, and its mean pressure as
     seven hundred and fifty thousand tons to the square inch.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">This substance is perceptible only to highly developed clairvoyant power. We must assume a time
  (though we have no direct knowledge on this point) when this substance filled all space. We must also suppose that
  some great Being (not the Deity of a solar system, but some Being almost infinitely higher than that) changed this
  condition of rest by pouring, out His spirit or force into a certain section of this matter, a section of the size of
  a whole universe. This effect of the introduction of this force is as that of the blowing of a mighty breath; it has
  formed within this aether an incalculable number of tiny spherical bubbles,[<a name="text03" href="#foot03">3</a>]
  and these bubbles are the ultimate atoms of which what we call matter is composed. They are not the atoms of the
  chemist, nor even the ultimate atoms of the physical world. They stand at a far higher level, and what are usually
  called atoms are composed of vast aggregations of these bubbles, as will be seen later.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">When the Solar Deity begins to make His system, He finds ready to His hand this material--this
  infinite mass of tiny bubbles which can be built up into various kinds of matter as we know it. He commences by
  defining the limit of His field of activity, a vast sphere whose circumference is far larger than the orbit of the
  outermost of His future planets. Within the limit of that sphere He sets up a kind of gigantic vortex--a motion which
  sweeps together all the bubbles into a vast central mass, the material of the nebula that is to be.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Into this vast revolving sphere He sends forth successive impulses of force, gathering together the
  bubbles into ever more and more complex aggregations, and producing in this way seven gigantic interpenetrating
  worlds of matter of different degrees of density, all concentric and all occupying the same space.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Acting through His Third Aspect He sends forth into this stupendous sphere the first of these
  impulses. It sets up all through the sphere a vast number of tiny vortices, each of which draws into itself
  forty-nine bubbles, and arranges them in a certain shape. These little groupings of bubbles so formed are the atoms
  of the second of the interpenetrating worlds. The whole number of the bubbles is not used in this way, sufficient
  being left in the dissociated state to act as atoms for the first and highest of these worlds. In due time comes the
  second impulse, which seizes upon nearly all these forty-nine bubble-atoms (leaving only enough to provide atoms for
  the second world), draws them back into itself and then, throwing them out again, sets up among them vortices, each
  of which holds within itself 2,401 bubbles (49<sup>2</sup>). These form the atoms of the third world. Again after a
  time comes a third impulse, which in the same way seizes upon nearly all these 2,401 bubble-atoms, draws them back
  again into their original form, and again throws them outward once more as the atoms of the fourth world--each atom
  containing this time 49<sup>3</sup> bubbles. This process is repeated until the sixth of these successive impulses
  has built the atom of the seventh or the lowest world--that atom containing 49<sup>6</sup> of the original
  bubbles.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">This atom of the seventh world is the ultimate atom of the physical world--not any of the atoms of
  which chemists speak, but that ultimate out of which all their atoms are made. We have at this stage arrived at that
  condition of affairs in which the vast whirling sphere contains within itself seven types of matter, all one in
  essence, because all built of the same kind of bubbles, &quot;but differing in their degree of density. All these
  types are freely intermingled, so that specimens of each type would be found in a small portion of the sphere taken
  at random in any part of it, with, however, a general tendency of the heavier atoms to gravitate more and more
  towards the centre.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The seventh impulse sent out from the Third Aspect of the Deity does not, as before, draw back the
  physical atoms which were last made into the original dissociated bubbles, but draws them together into certain
  aggregations, thus making a number of different kinds of what may be called proto-elements, and these again are
  joined together into the various forms which are known to science as chemical elements. The making of these extends
  over a long period of ages, and they are made in a certain definite order by the interaction of several forces, as is
  correctly indicated in Sir William Crookes&#39;s paper, <i>The Genesis of the Elements.</i> Indeed the process of
  their making is not even now concluded; uranium is the latest and heaviest element so far as we know, but others
  still more complicated may perhaps be produced in the future.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">As ages rolled on the condensation increased, and presently the stage of a vast glowing nebula was
  reached. As it cooled, still rapidly rotating, it flattened into a huge disc and gradually broke up into rings
  surrounding a central body--an arrangement not unlike that which Saturn exhibits at the present day, though on a far
  larger scale. As the time drew near when the planets would be required for the purposes of evolution, the Deity set
  up somewhere in the thickness of each ring a subsidiary vortex into which a great deal of the matter of the ring was
  by degrees collected. The collisions of the gathered fragments caused a revival of the heat, and the resulting planet
  was for a long time a mass of glowing gas. Little by little it cooled once more, until it became fit to be the
  theatre of life such as ours. Thus were all the planets formed.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Almost all the matter of those interpenetrating worlds was by this time concentrated into the newly
  formed planets. Each of them was and is composed of all those different kinds of matter. The earth upon which we are
  now living is not merely a great ball of physical matter, built of the atoms of that lowest world, but has also
  attached to it an abundant supply of matter of the sixth, the fifth, the fourth and other worlds. It is well known to
  all students of science that particles of matter never actually touch one another, even in the hardest of substances.
  The spaces between them are always far greater in proportion than their own size--enormously greater. So there is
  ample room for all the other kinds of atoms of all those other worlds, not only to lie between the atoms of the
  denser matter, but to move quite freely among them and around them. Consequently, this globe upon which we live is
  not one world, but seven interpenetrating worlds, all occupying the same space, except that the finer types of matter
  extend further from the centre than does the denser matter.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">We have given names to these interpenetrating worlds for convenience in speaking of them. No name
  is needed for the first, as man is not yet in direct connection with it; but when it is necessary to mention it, it
  may be called the divine world. The second is described as the monadic, because in it exist those Sparks of the
  divine Life which we call the human Monads; but neither of these can be touched by the highest clairvoyant
  investigations at present possible for us. The third sphere, whose atoms contain 2,401 bubbles, is called the
  spiritual world, because in it functions the highest Spirit in man as now constituted. The fourth is the intuitional
  world,[<a name="text04" href="#foot04">4</a>] because from it come the highest intuitions. The fifth is the mental
  world, because from its matter is built the mind of man. The sixth is called the emotional or astral world, because
  the emotions of man cause undulations in its matter. (The name astral was given to it by mediæval alchemists, because
  its matter is starry or shining as compared to that of the denser world.) The seventh world, composed of the type of
  matter which we see all around us, is called the physical.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The matter of which all these interpenetrating worlds are built is essentially the same matter, but
  differently arranged and of different degrees of density. Therefore the rates at which these various types of matter
  normally vibrate differ also. They may be considered as a vast gamut of undulations consisting of many octaves. The
  physical matter uses a certain number of the lowest of these octaves, the astral matter another group of octaves just
  above that, the mental matter a still further group, and so on.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Not only has each of these worlds its own type of matter; it has also its own set of aggregations
  of that matter--its own substances. In each world we arrange these substances in seven classes according to the rate
  at which their molecules vibrate. Usually, but not invariably, the slower oscillation involves also a larger
  molecule--a molecule, that is, built up by a special arrangement of the smaller molecules of the next higher
  subdivision. The application of heat increases the size of the molecules and also quickens and amplifies their
  undulation, so that they cover more ground, and the object, as a whole expands, until the point is reached where the
  aggregation of molecules breaks up, and the latter passes from one condition to that next above it. In the matter of
  the physical world the seven subdivisions are represented by seven degrees of density of matter, to which, beginning
  from below upwards, we give the names solid, liquid, gaseous, etheric, superetheric, sub-atomic and
  atomic.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The atomic subdivision is one in which all forms are built by the compression into certain shapes
  of the physical atoms, without any previous collection of these atoms into blocks or molecules. Typifying the
  physical ultimate atom for the moment by a brick, any form in the atomic subdivision would be made by gathering
  together some of the bricks, and building them into a certain shape. In order to make matter for the next lower
  subdivision, a certain number of the bricks (atoms) would first be gathered together and cemented into small blocks
  of say four bricks each, five bricks each, six bricks or seven bricks; and then these blocks so made would be used as
  building stones. For the next subdivision several of the blocks of the second sub-division cemented together in
  certain shapes would form building-stones, and so on to the lowest.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">To transfer any substance from the solid condition to the liquid (that is to say, to melt it) is to
  increase the vibration of its compound molecules until at last they are shaken apart into the simpler molecules of
  which they were built. This process can in all cases be repeated again and again until finally any and every physical
  substance can be reduced to the ultimate atoms of the physical world.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Each of these worlds has its inhabitants, whose senses are normally capable of responding to the
  undulations of their own world only. A man living (as we are all-doing) in the physical world sees, hears, feels, by
  vibrations connected with the physical matter around him. He is equally surrounded by the astral and mental and other
  worlds which are interpenetrating his own denser world, but of them he is normally unconscious, because his senses
  cannot respond to the oscillations of their matter, just as our physical eyes cannot see by the vibrations of
  ultra-violet light, although scientific experiments show that they exist, and there are other consciousnesses with
  differently-formed organs who <i>can</i> see by them. A being living in the astral world might be occupying the very
  same space as a being living in the physical world, yet each would be entirely unconscious of the other and would in
  no way impede the free movement of the other. The same is true of all other worlds. We are at this moment surrounded
  by these worlds of finer matter, as close to us as the world we see, and their inhabitants are passing through us and
  about us, but we are entirely unconscious of them.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Since our evolution is centred at present upon this globe which we call the earth, it is in
  connection with it only that we shall be speaking of these higher worlds, so in future when I use the term
  &quot;astral world&quot; I shall, mean by it the astral part of our own globe only, and not (as heretofore) the
  astral part of the whole solar system. This astral part of our own world is also a globe, but of astral matter. It
  occupies the same place as the globe which we see, but its matter (being so much lighter) extends out into space on
  all sides of us further than does the atmosphere of the earth--a great deal further. It stretches to a little less
  than the mean distance of the moon, so that though the two physical globes, the earth and the moon, are nearly
  240,000&#39; miles apart, the astral globes of these two bodies touch one another when the moon is in perigee, but
  not when she is in apogee. I shall apply the term &quot;mental world&quot; to the still larger globe of mental matter
  in the midst of which our physical earth exists. When we come to the still higher globes we have spheres large enough
  to touch the corresponding spheres of other planets in the system, though their matter also is just as much about us
  here on the surface of the solid earth as that of the others. All these globes of finer matter are a part of us, and
  are all revolving round the sun with their visible part. The student will do well to accustom himself to think of our
  earth as the whole of&quot; this mass of interpenetrating worlds--not only the comparatively small physical ball in
  the centre of it.</font></p>
