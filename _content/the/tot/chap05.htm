  <h1 align="center">THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN</h1>

  <p><font size="3">MAN is therefore in essence a Spark of the divine Fire, belonging to the monadic world.[<a href=
  "#foot1" name="text1" id="text1">5</a>] To that Spark, dwelling all the time in that world, we give the name
  &quot;Monad&quot;. For the purposes of human evolution the Monad manifests itself in lower worlds. When it descends
  one stage and enters the spiritual world, it shows itself there as the triple Spirit having itself three aspects
  (just as in worlds infinitely higher the Deity has His three Aspects). Of those three one remains always in that
  world, and we call that the Spirit in man.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The second aspect manifests itself in the intuitional world, and we speak of it as the Intuition in
  man. The third shows itself in the higher mental world, and we call it the Intelligence in man. These three aspects
  taken together constitute the ego which ensouls the fragment from the group-soul. Thus man as we know him, though in
  reality a Monad residing in the monadic world, shows himself as an ego in the higher mental world, manifesting these
  three aspects of himself (Spirit, Intuition and Intelligence) through that vehicle of higher mental matter which we
  name the causal body.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">This ego is the man during the human stage of evolution; he is the nearest correspondence, in fact,
  to the ordinary unscientific conception of the soul. He lives unchanged (except for his growth) from the moment of
  individualization until humanity is transcended and merged into divinity. He is in no way affected by what we call
  birth and death; what we commonly consider as his life is only a day in his life. The body which we can see, the body
  which is born and dies, is a garment which he puts on for the purposes of a certain part of his evolution.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Nor is it the only body which he assumes. Before he, the ego in the higher mental world, can take a
  vehicle belonging to the physical world, he must make a connection with it through the lower mental and astral
  worlds. When he wishes to descend he draws around himself a veil of the matter of the lower mental world, which we
  call his mental body. This is the instrument by means of which he thinks all his concrete thoughts--abstract thought
  being a power of the ego himself in the higher mental world.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Next he draws round himself a veil of astral matter, which we call his astral body; and that is the
  instrument of his passions and emotions, and also (in conjunction with the lower part of his mental body) the
  instrument. of all such thought as is tinged by selfishness and personal feeling. Only after having assumed these
  intermediate vehicles can he come into touch with a baby physical body, and be born into the world which we know. He
  lives through what we call his life, gaining certain qualities as the result of its experiences; and at its end, when
  the physical body is worn out, he reverses the process of descent and lays aside one by one the temporary vehicles
  which he has assumed. The first to go is the physical body, and when that is dropped, his life is centred in the
  astral world and he lives in his astral body.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The length of his stay in that world depends upon the amount of passion and emotion which he has
  developed within himself in his physical life. If there is much of these, the astral body is strongly vitalized, and
  will persist for a long time; if there is but little, the astral body has less vitality, and he will soon be able to
  cast that vehicle aside in turn. When that is done he finds himself living in his mental body. The strength of that
  depends upon the nature of the thoughts to which he has habituated himself, and usually his stay at this level is a
  long one. At last it comes to an end, and he casts aside the mental body in turn, and is once more the ego in his own
  world.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Owing to lack of development, he is as yet but partially conscious in that world; the vibrations of
  its matter are too rapid to make any impression upon him, just as the ultra-violet rays are too rapid to make any
  impression upon our eyes. After a rest there, he feels the desire to descend to a level where the undulations are
  perceptible to him, in order that he may feel himself to be fully alive; so he repeats the process of descent
  <i>into</i> denser matter, and assumes once more a mental, an astral and a physical body. As his previous bodies have
  all disintegrated, each in its turn, these new vehicles are entirely distinct from them, and thus it happens that in
  his physical life he has no recollection whatever of other similar lives which have preceded it.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">When functioning in this physical world he remembers by means of his mental body; but since that is
  a new one, assumed only for this birth, it naturally cannot contain the memory of previous births in which it had no
  part. The man himself, the ego, does remember them all when in his own world, and occasionally some partial
  recollection of them or influence from them filters through into his lower vehicles. He does not usually, in his
  physical life, remember the experiences of earlier lives, but he does manifest in physical life the qualities which
  those experiences have developed in him. Each man is therefore exactly what he has made himself during those past
  lives; if he has in them developed good qualities in himself, he possesses the good qualities now; if he neglected to
  train himself, and consequently left himself weak and of evil disposition, he finds himself precisely in that
  condition now. The qualities, good or evil, with which he is born are those which he has made for himself.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">This development of the ego is the object of the whole process of materialization; he assumes those
  veils of matter precisely because through them he is able to receive vibrations to which he can respond, so that his
  latent faculties may thereby be unfolded. Though man descends from on high into these lower worlds, it is only
  through that descent that a full cognizance of the higher worlds is developed in him. Full consciousness in any given
  world involves the power to perceive and respond to all the undulations of that world; therefore the ordinary man has
  not yet perfect consciousness at any level--not even in this physical world which he thinks he knows. It is possible
  for him to unfold his percipience in all these worlds, and it is by means of such developed consciousness that we
  observe all these facts which I am now describing.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The causal body is the permanent vehicle of the ego in the higher mental world. It consists of
  matter of the first, second and third subdivisions of that world. In ordinary people it is not yet fully active, only
  that matter which belongs to the third subdivision being vivified. As the ego unfolds his latent possibilities
  through the long course of his evolution, the higher matter is gradually brought into action, but it is only in the
  perfected man whom we call the Adept that it is developed to its fullest extent. Such matter can be discerned by
  clairvoyant sight, but only by a seer who knows how to use the sight of the ego. It is difficult to describe a causal
  body fully, because the senses belonging to its world are altogether different from and higher than ours at this
  level. Such memory of the appearance of a causal body as it is possible for a clairvoyant to bring into his physical
  brain represents it as ovoid, and as surrounding the physical body of the man, extending to a distance of about
  eighteen inches from the normal surface of that body. In the case of primitive man it resembles a bubble, and gives
  the impression of being empty. It is in reality filled with higher mental matter, but as this is not yet brought into
  activity it remains colourless and transparent. As advancement continues it is gradually stirred into alertness by
  vibrations which reach it from the lower bodies. This comes but slowly, because the activities of man in the earlier
  stages of his evolution are not of a character to obtain expression in matter so fine as that of the higher mental
  body; but when a man reaches the stage where he is capable either of abstract thought or of unselfish emotion the
  matter of the causal body is aroused into response.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">When these rates of undulation are awakened within him they show themselves in his causal body as
  colours, so that instead of being a mere transparent bubble it gradually becomes a sphere filled with matter of the
  most lovely and delicate hues--an object beautiful beyond all conception. It is found by experience that these
  colours are significant. The vibration which denotes the power of unselfish affection shows itself as a pale
  rose-colour; that which indicates high intellectual power is yellow; that which expresses sympathy is green, while
  blue betokens devotional feeling, and a luminous lilac-blue typifies the higher spirituality. The same scheme of
  colour-significance applies to the bodies which are built of denser matter, but as we approach the physical world the
  hues are in every case by comparison grosser--not only less delicate but also less living.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">In the course of evolution in the lower worlds man often introduces into his vehicles qualities
  which are undesirable and entirely inappropriate for his life as an ego--such, for example, as pride, irritability,
  sensuality. These, like the rest, are reducible to vibrations, but they are in all cases vibrations of the lower
  subdivisions of their respective worlds, and therefore they cannot reproduce themselves in the causal body, which is
  built exclusively of the matter of the three higher subdivisions of its world. For each section of the astral body
  acts strongly upon the corresponding section of the mental body, but only upon the corresponding section; it cannot
  influence any other part. So the causal body can be affected only by the three higher portions of the astral body;
  and the oscillations of those represent only good qualities. The practical effect of this is that the man can build
  into the ego (that is, into his true self) nothing but good qualities; the evil qualities which he develops are in
  their nature transitory and must be thrown aside as he advances, because he has no longer within him matter which can
  express them. The difference between the causal bodies of the savage and the saint is that the first is empty and
  colourless, while the second is full of brilliant, coruscating tints. As the man passes beyond even saint-hood and
  becomes a great spiritual power, his causal body increases in size, because it has so much more to express, and it
  also begins to pour out from itself in all directions powerful rays of living light. In one who has attained
  Adeptship this body is of enormous dimensions.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The mental body is built of matter of the four lower subdivisions of the mental world, and
  expresses the concrete thoughts of the man. Here also we find the same colour-scheme as in the causal body. The hues
  are somewhat less delicate, and we notice one or two additions. For example, a thought of pride shows itself as
  orange, while irritability is manifested by a brilliant scarlet. We may see here sometimes the bright brown of
  avarice, the grey-brown of selfishness, and the grey-green of deceit. Here also we perceive the possibility of a
  mixture of colours; the affection, the intellect, the devotion may &quot;be tinged by selfishness, and in that case
  their distinctive colours are mingled with the brown of selfishness, and so we have an impure and muddy appearance.
  Although its particles are always in intensely rapid motion among themselves, this body has at the same time a kind
  of loose organization.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The size and shape of the mental body are determined by those of the causal vehicle. There are in
  it certain striations which divide it more or less irregularly into segments, each of these corresponding to a
  certain department of the physical brain, so that every type of thought should function through its duly assigned
  portion. The mental body is as yet so imperfectly developed in ordinary men that there are many in whom a great
  number of special departments are not yet in activity, and any attempt at thought belonging to those departments has
  to travel round through some inappropriate channel which happens to be fully open. The result is that thought on
  those subjects is for those people clumsy and uncomprehending. This is why some people have a head for mathematics
  and others are unable to add correctly--why some people instinctively understand, appreciate and enjoy music, while
  others do not know one tune from another.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">All the matter of the mental body should be circulating freely, but sometimes a man allows his
  thought upon a certain subject to set and solidify, and then the circulation is impeded, and there is a congestion
  which presently hardens into a kind of wart on the mental body. Such a wart appears to us down here as a prejudice;
  and until it is absorbed and free circulation restored, it is impossible for the man to think truly or to see clearly
  with regard to that particular department of his mind, as the congestion checks the free passage of undulations both
  outward and inward.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">When a man uses any part of his mental body it not only vibrates for the time more rapidly, but it
  also temporarily swells out and increases in size. If there is prolonged thought upon a subject this increase becomes
  permanent, and it is thus open to any man to increase the size of his mental body either along desirable or
  undesirable lines.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Good thoughts produce vibrations of the finer matter of the body, which by its specific gravity
  tends to float in the upper part of the ovoid; whereas bad thoughts, such as selfishness and avarice, are always
  oscillations of the grosser matter, which tends to gravitate towards the lower part of the ovoid. Consequently the
  ordinary man, who yields himself not infrequently to selfish thoughts of various kinds, usually expands the lower
  part of his mental body, and presents roughly the appearance of an egg with its larger end downwards. The man who has
  repressed those lower thoughts, and devoted himself to higher ones, tends to expand the upper part of his mental
  body, and therefore presents the appearance of an egg standing on its smaller end. From a study of the colours and
  striations of a man&#39;s mental body the clairvoyant can perceive his character and the progress he has made in his
  present life. From similar features of the causal body he can see what progress the ego has made since its original
  formation, when the man left the animal kingdom.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">When a man thinks of any concrete object--a book, a house, a landscape--he builds a tiny image of
  the object in the matter of his mental body. This image floats in the upper part of that body, usually in front of
  the face of the man and at about the level of the eyes. It remains there as long as the man is contemplating the
  object, and usually for a little time afterwards, the length of time depending upon the intensity and the clearness
  of the thought. This form is quite objective, and can be seen by another person, if that other has developed the
  sight of his own mental body. If a man thinks of another, he creates a tiny portrait in just the same way. If his
  thought is merely contemplative and involves no feeling (such as affection or dislike) or desire (such as a wish to
  see the person) the thought does not usually perceptibly affect the man of whom he thinks. If coupled with the
  thought of the person there is a feeling, as for example of affection, another phenomenon occurs besides the forming
  of the image. The thought of affection takes a definite form, which it builds out of the matter of the thinker&#39;s
  mental body. Because of the emotion involved, it draws round it also matter of his astral body, and thus we have an
  astromental form which leaps out of the body in which it has been generated, and moves through space towards the
  object of the feeling of affection. If the thought is sufficiently strong, distance makes absolutely no difference to
  it; but the thought of an ordinary person is usually weak and diffused, and is therefore not effective outside a
  limited area.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">When this thought-form reaches its object it discharges itself into his astral and mental bodies,
  communicating to them its own rate of vibration. Putting this in another way, a thought of love sent from one: person
  to another involves the actual transference of a certain amount both of force and of matter from the sender to the
  recipient, and its effect upon the recipient is to arouse the feeling of affection in him, and slightly but
  permanently to increase his power of loving. But such a thought also strengthens the power of affection in the
  thinker, and therefore it does good simultaneously to both.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Every thought builds a form; if the thought be directed to another person it travels to him; if it
  be distinctly selfish it remains in the immediate neighbourhood of the thinker; if it belongs to neither of these
  categories it floats for awhile in space and then slowly disintegrates. Every man therefore is leaving behind him
  wherever he goes a trail of thought forms; as we go along the street we are walking all the time amidst a sea of
  other men&#39;s thoughts. If a man leaves his mind blank for a time, these residual thoughts of others drift through
  it, making in most cases but little impression upon him. Sometimes one arrives which attracts his attention, so that
  his mind seizes upon it and makes it its own, strengthens it by the addition of its force, and then casts it out
  again to affect somebody else. A man, therefore, is not responsible for a thought which floats into his mind, because
  it may be not his, but someone else&#39;s; but he <i>is</i> responsible if he takes it up, dwells upon it and then
  sends it out strengthened.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Self-centred thought of any kind hangs about the thinker, and most men surround their mental bodies
  with a shell of such thoughts. Such a shell obscures the mental vision and facilitates the formation of
  prejudice.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Each thought-form is a temporary entity. It resembles a charged battery, awaiting an opportunity to
  discharge itself. Its tendency is always to reproduce its own rate of vibration in the mental body upon which it
  fastens itself, and so to arouse in it a like thought. If the person at whom it is aimed happens to be busy or
  already engaged in some definite train of thought, the particles of his mental body are already swinging at a certain
  determinate rate, and cannot for the moment be affected from without. In that case the thought-form bides its time,
  hanging about its object until he is sufficiently at rest to permit its entrance; then it discharges itself upon him,
  and in the act ceases to exist.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The self-centred thought behaves in exactly the same way with regard to its generator, and
  discharges itself upon him when opportunity offers. If it be an evil thought, he generally regards it as the
  suggestion of a tempting demon, whereas in truth he tempts himself. Usually each definite thought creates a new
  thought-form; but if a thought-form of the same nature is already hovering round the thinker, under certain
  circumstances a new thought on the same subject, instead of creating a new form, coalesces with and strengthens, the
  old one, so that by long brooding over the same subject a man may sometimes create a thought-form of tremendous
  power. If the thought be a wicked one, such a thought-form may become a veritable evil influence, lasting perhaps for
  many years, and having for a time all the appearance and powers of a real living entity.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">All these which have been described are the ordinary unpremeditated thoughts of man. A man can make
  a thought-form intentionally, and aim it at another with the object of helping him. This is one of the lines of
  activity adopted by those who desire to serve humanity. A steady stream of powerful thought directed intelligently
  upon another person may be of the greatest assistance to him. A strong thought-form may be a real guardian angel, and
  protect its object from impurity, from irritability or from fear.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">An interesting branch of the subject is the study of the various shapes and colours taken by
  thought-forms of different kinds. The colours indicate the nature of the thought, and are in agreement with those
  which we have already described as existing in the bodies. The shapes are of infinite variety, but are often in some
  way typical of the kind of thought which they express.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Every thought of definite character, such as a thought of affection or hatred, of devotion or
  suspicion, of anger or fear, of pride or &quot;jealousy, not only creates a form but also radiates an undulation. The
  fact that each one of these thoughts is expressed by a certain colour indicates that the thought expresses itself as
  an oscillation of the matter of a certain part of the mental body. This rate of oscillation communicates itself to
  the surrounding mental matter precisely in the same way as the vibration of a bell communicates itself to the
  surrounding air.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">This radiation travels out in all directions, and whenever it impinges upon another mental body in
  a passive or receptive condition it communicates to it something of its own vibration. This does not convey a
  definite complete idea, as does the thought-form, but it tends to produce a thought of the same character as itself.
  For example, if the thought be devotional its undulations will excite devotion, but the object of the worship may be
  different in the case of each person upon whose mental body they impinge. The thought-form, on the other hand, can
  reach only one person, but will convey to that person (if receptive) not only a general devotional feeling, but also
  a precise image of the Being for whom the adoration was originally felt.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Any person who habitually thinks pure, good and strong thoughts is utilizing for that purpose the
  higher part of his mental body--a part which is not used at all by the ordinary man, and is entirely undeveloped in
  him. Such an one is therefore a power for good in the world, and is being of great use to all those of his neighbours
  who are capable of any sort of response. For the vibration which he sends out tends to arouse a new and higher part
  of their mental bodies, and consequently to open before them altogether new fields of thought.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">It may not be exactly the same thought as that sent out, but it is of the same nature. The
  undulations generated by a man thinking of Theosophy do not necessarily communicate Theosophical ideas to all those
  around him; but they do awaken in them more liberal and higher thought than that to which they have before been
  accustomed. On the other hand, the thought-forms generated under such circumstances, though more limited in their
  action than the radiation, are also more precise; they can affect only those who are to some extent open to them, but
  to them they will convey definite Theosophical ideas.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The colours of the astral body bear the same meaning as those of the higher vehicles, but are
  several octaves of colours below them, and much more nearly approaching to such hues as we see in the physical world.
  It is the vehicle of passion and emotion, and consequently it may exhibit additional colours, expressing man&#39;s
  less desirable feelings, which cannot show themselves at higher levels; for example, a lurid brownishred indicates
  the presence of sensuality, while black clouds show malice and hatred. A curious livid grey betokens the presence of
  fear, and a much darker grey, usually arranged in heavy rings around the ovoid, indicates a condition of depression.
  Irritability is shown by the presence of a number of small scarlet flecks in the astral body, each representing a
  small angry impulse. Jealousy is shown by a peculiar brownish-green, generally studded with the same scarlet flecks.
  The astral body is in size and shape like those just described, and in the ordinary man its outline is usually
  clearly marked; but in the case of primitive man it is often exceedingly irregular, and resembles a rolling cloud
  composed of all the more unpleasant colours.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">When the astral body is comparatively quiet (it is never actually at rest) the colours which are to
  be seen ;in it indicate those emotions to which the man is most in the habit of yielding himself. When the man
  experiences a rush of any particular feeling, the rate of vibration which expresses that feeling dominates for a time
  the entire astral body. If, for example, it be devotion, the whole of his astral body is flushed with blue, and while
  the emotion remains at its strongest the normal colours do little more than modify the blue, or appear faintly
  through a veil of it; but presently the vehemence of the sentiment dies away, and the normal colours reassert
  themselves. But because of that spasm of emotion the part of the astral body which is normally blue has been
  increased in size. Thus a man who frequently feels high devotion soon comes to have a large area of the blue
  permanently existing in his astral body.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">When the rush of devotional <i>feeling</i> comes over him, it is usually accompanied by
  <i>thoughts</i> of devotion. Although primarily formed in the mental body, these draw round themselves a large amount
  of astral matter as well, so that their action is in both worlds. In both worlds also is the radiation which was
  previously described, so that the devotional man is a centre of devotion, and will influence other people to share
  both his thoughts and his feelings. The same is true in the case of affection, anger, depression--and, indeed, of all
  other feelings.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The flood of emotion does not itself greatly affect the mental body, although for a time it may
  render it almost impossible for any activity from that mental body to come through into the physical brain. That is
  not because that body itself is affected, but because the astral body, which acts as a bridge between it and the
  physical brain, is vibrating so entirely at one rate as to be incapable of conveying any undulation which is not in
  harmony with that.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The permanent colours of the astral body react upon the mental. They produce in it their
  correspondences, several octaves higher, in the same manner as a musical note produces overtones. The mental body in
  its turn reacts upon the causal in the same way, and thus all the good qualities expressed in the lower vehicles by
  degrees establish themselves permanently in the ego. The evil qualities cannot do so, as the rates of vibrations
  which express them are impossible for the higher mental matter of which the causal body is constructed.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">So far, we have described vehicles which are the expression of the ego in their respective
  worlds--vehicles, which he provides for himself; in the physical world we come to a vehicle which is provided for him
  by Nature under laws which will be later explained--which, though also in some sense an expression of him, is by no
  means a perfect manifestation. In ordinary life we see only a small part of this physical body--only that which is
  built of the solid and liquid subdivisions of physical matter. The body contains matter of all the seven
  subdivisions, and all of them play their part in its life and are of equal importance, to it.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">We usually speak of the invisible part of the physical body as the etheric double;
  &quot;double&quot; because it exactly reproduces the size and shape of the part of the body that we can see, and
  &quot;etheric&quot; because it is built of that finer kind of matter by the vibrations of which light is conveyed to
  the retina of the eye. (This must not be confused with the true æther of space--that of which matter is the
  negation.) This invisible part of the physical body is of great importance to us, since it is the vehicle through
  which flow the streams of vitality which keep the body alive, and without it, as a bridge to convey undulations of
  thought and feeling from the astral to the visible denser physical matter, the ego could make no use of the cells of
  his brain.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The life of a physical body is one of perpetual change and in order that it shall live, it needs
  constantly to be supplied from three distinct sources. It must have food for its digestion, air for its breathing,
  and vitality for its absorption. This vitality is essentially a force, but when clothed in matter it appears to us as
  a definite element, which exists in all the worlds of which we have spoken. At the moment we are concerned with that
  manifestation of it which we find in the highest sub-division of the physical world. Just as the blood circulates
  through the veins, so does the vitality circulate along the nerves; and precisely as any abnormality in the flow of
  the blood at once affects the physical body, so does the slightest irregularity in the absorption or flow of the
  vitality affect this higher part of the physical, body.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Vitality is a force which comes originally from the sun. When an ultimate physical atom is charged
  with it, it draws round itself six other atoms, and makes itself into an etheric element. The original force of
  vitality is then subdivided into seven, each of the atoms carrying a separate charge. The element thus made is
  absorbed into the human body through the etheric part of the spleen. It is there split up into its component parts,
  which at once flow to the various parts of the body assigned to them. The spleen is one of the seven force centres in
  the etheric part of the physical body. In each of our vehicles seven such centres should be in activity, and when
  they are thus active they are visible to clairvoyant sight. They appear usually as shallow vortices, for they are the
  points at which the force from the higher bodies enters the lower. In the physical body these centres are: (1) at the
  base of the spine, (2) at the solar plexus, (3) at the spleen, (4) over the heart, (5) at the throat, (6) between the
  eyebrows, and (7) at the top of the head. There are other dormant centres, but their awakening is
  undesirable.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The shape of all the higher bodies as seen by the clairvoyant is ovoid, but the matter composing
  them is not equally distributed throughout the egg. In the midst of this ovoid is the physical body. The physical
  body strongly attracts astral matter, and in its turn the astral matter strongly attracts mental matter. There-fore
  by far the greater part of the matter of the astral body is gathered within the physical frame; and the same is true
  of the mental vehicle. If we see the astral body of a man in its own world, apart from the physical body we shall
  still perceive the astral matter aggregated in exactly the shape of the physical, although, as the matter is more
  fluidic in its nature, what we see is a body built of dense mist, in the midst of an ovoid of much finer mist. The
  same is true for the mental body. Therefore, if in the astral or the mental world we should meet an acquaintance, we
  should recognise him by his appearance just as instantly as in the physical world.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">This, then, is the true constitution of man. In the first place he is a Monad, a Spark of the
  Divine. Of that Monad the ego is a partial expression, formed in order that he may enter evolution, and may return to
  the Monad with joy, bringing his sheaves with him in the shape of qualities developed by garnered experience. The ego
  in his turn puts down part of himself for the same purpose into lower worlds, and we call that part a personality,
  because the Latin word <i>persona</i> means a mask, and this personality is the mask which the ego puts upon himself
  when he manifests in worlds lower than his own. Just as the ego is a small part and an imperfect expression of the
  Monad, so is the personality a small part and an imperfect expression of the ego; so that what we usually think of as
  the man is only in truth a fragment of a fragment.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">The personality wears three bodies or vehicles, the mental, the astral and the physical. While the
  man is what we call alive and awake on the physical earth he is limited by his physical body, for he uses the astral
  and mental bodies only as bridges to connect himself with his lowest vehicle. One of the limitations of the physical
  body is that it quickly becomes fatigued and needs periodical rest. Each night the man leaves it to sleep, and
  withdraws into his astral vehicle, which does not become fatigued, and therefore needs no sleep. During this sleep of
  the physical body the man is free to move about in the astral world; but the extent to which he does this depends
  upon his development. The primitive savage usually does not move more than a few miles away from his sleeping
  physical form--often not as much as that; and he has only the vaguest consciousness. The educated man is generally
  able to travel in his astral vehicle wherever he will, and has much more consciousness in the astral world, though he
  has not often the faculty of bringing into his waking life any memory of what he has seen and done while his physical
  body was asleep. Sometimes he does remember some incident which he has seen, some experience which he has had, and
  then he calls it a vivid dream. More often his recollections are hopelessly entangled with vague memories of waking
  life, and with impressions made from without upon the etheric part of his brain. Thus we arrive at the confused and
  often absurd dreams of ordinary life. The developed man becomes as fully conscious and active in the astral world as
  in the physical, and brings through into the latter full remembrance of what he has been doing in the former--that
  is, he has a continuous life without any loss of consciousness throughout the whole twenty-four hours, and thus
  throughout the whole of his physical life, and even through death itself.</font></p>
