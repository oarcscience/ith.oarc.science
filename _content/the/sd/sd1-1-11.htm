<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) The hierarchy of Creative Powers is divided into
seven (or 4 and 3) esoteric, within the twelve great Orders, recorded
in the twelve signs of the Zodiac; the seven of the manifesting
scale being connected, moreover, with the Seven Planets. All this
is subdivided into numberless groups of divine Spiritual, semi-Spiritual,
and ethereal Beings.
<P>
The Chief Hierarchies among these are hinted at in the great Quaternary,
or the &quot;four bodies and the three faculties&quot; of Brahma
exoterically, and the Panchasyam, the five Brahmas, or the five
Dhyani-Buddhas in the Buddhist system.
<P>
The highest group is composed of the divine Flames, so-called,
also spoken of as the &quot;Fiery Lions&quot; and the &quot;Lions
of Life,&quot; whose esotericism is securely hidden in the Zodiacal
sign of Leo. It is the <EM>nucleole </EM>of the superior divine
World (see <EM>Commentary </EM>in first pages of Addendum). They
are the formless Fiery Breaths, identical in one aspect with the
upper Sephirothal <STRONG>T</STRONG>RIAD, which is placed by the
Kabalists in the &quot;Archetypal World.&quot;
<P>
The same hierarchy, with the same numbers, is found in the Japanese
system, in the &quot;Beginnings&quot; as taught by both the Shinto
and the Buddhist sects. In this system, Anthropogenesis precedes
Cosmogenesis, as the Divine merges into the human, and creates

<P>
midway in its descent into matter -- the visible Universe. The
legendary personages -- remarks reverentially Omoie -- &quot;having
to be understood as the stereotyped embodiment of the higher (secret)
doctrine, and its sublime truths.&quot; To state it at full length,
however, would occupy too much of our space, but a few words on
this old system cannot be out of place. The following is a short
synopsis of this Anthropo-Cosmogenesis, and it shows how closely
the most separated notions echoed one and the same Archaic teaching.
<P>
When all was as yet Chaos (<EM>Kon-ton</EM>)<EM> </EM>three spiritual
Beings appeared on the stage of future creation: (1) <EM>Ame no
ani naka nushi no Kami</EM>,<EM> </EM>&quot;Divine Monarch of
the Central Heaven&quot;; (2)<EM> Taka mi onosubi no Kami</EM>,<EM>
</EM>&quot;Exalted, imperial Divine offspring of Heaven and the
Earth&quot;; and (3)<EM> Kamu mi musubi no Kami</EM>,<EM> </EM>&quot;Offspring
of the Gods,&quot; simply.
<P>
These were without form or substance (our <EM>arupa </EM>triad),
as neither the celestial nor the terrestrial substance had yet
differentiated, &quot;nor had the essence of things been formed.&quot;
<P>
In the Zohar -- which, as now arranged and re-edited by Moses
de Leon, with the help of Syrian and Chaldean Christian Gnostics
in the XIIth century, and corrected and revised still later by
many Christian hands, is only a little less exoteric than the
Bible itself -- this divine &quot;Vehicle&quot; no longer appears
as it does in the &quot;Chaldean Book of Numbers.&quot; True enough,
Ain-Soph, the <STRONG>A</STRONG>BSOLUTE <STRONG>E</STRONG>NDLESS
<STRONG>N</STRONG>O-THING, uses also the form of the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE,
the manifested &quot;Heavenly man&quot; (the FIRST CAUSE) as its
chariot (<EM>Mercabah</EM>,<EM> </EM>in Hebrew; <EM>Vahan</EM>,<EM>
</EM>in Sanskrit) or vehicle to descend into, and manifest through,
in the phenomenal world. But the Kabalists neither make it plain
how the <STRONG>A</STRONG>BSOLUTE can use anything, or exercise
any attribute whatever, since, as the Absolute, it is devoid of
attributes; nor do they explain that in reality it is the First
Cause (Plato's<EM> Logos</EM>)<EM> </EM>the original and eternal
IDEA, that manifests through Adam Kadmon, the <EM>Second </EM>Logos,
so to speak. In the &quot;Book of Numbers&quot; it is explained
that <STRONG>E</STRONG>N (or <EM>Ain</EM>,<EM> </EM>Aior) is the
only self-existent, whereas its &quot;Depth&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Bythos</EM>
or<EM> Buthon </EM>of the Gnostics, called <EM>Propator</EM>)<EM>
</EM>is only periodical. The latter is Brahm as differentiated
from Brahma or Parabrahm. It is the Depth, the Source of Light,
or Propator, which is the <EM>unmanifested </EM>Logos or the abstract
<EM>Idea</EM>, and not Ain-Soph, <EM>whose ray </EM>uses Adam-Kadmon
or the <EM>manifested </EM>Logos (the objective Universe) &quot;male
and female&quot; -- as a chariot through which to manifest. But
in the Zohar we read the following incongruity: &quot;<EM>Senior</EM>
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 215 ONE PARENT FLAME, COUNTLESS FLAMES.</H6>

<P>
<EM>occultatus est et absconditus; Microprosopus manifestus est</EM>,<EM>
et non manifestus.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Rosenroth; Liber Mysterii</EM>,<EM>
</EM>IV<EM>.</EM>,<EM> </EM>1.) This is a fallacy, since <EM>Microprosopus
</EM>or the <EM>microcosm</EM>,<EM> </EM>can only exist during
its manifestations, and is destroyed during the Maha-Pralayas.
Rosenroth's Kabala is no guide, but very often a puzzle.
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>)<EM> </EM>As in the Japanese system, in the Egyptian,
and every old cosmogony -- at this divine FLAME, The &quot;One,&quot;
are lit the three descending groups. Having their potential being
in the higher group, they now become distinct and separate Entities.
These are called the &quot;Virgins of Life,&quot; the &quot;Great
Illusion,&quot; etc., etc., and collectively the &quot;Six-pointed
Star.&quot; The latter is the symbol, in almost every religion,
of the <EM>Logos </EM>as the first emanation. It is that of Vishnu
in India (the <EM>Chakra</EM>,<EM> </EM>or wheel), and the glyph
of the Tetragrammaton, the &quot;He of the four letters&quot;
or -- metaphorically -- &quot;the limbs of Microprosopos&quot;
in the Kabala, which are ten and six respectively. The later Kabalists
however, especially the Christian mystics, have played sad havoc
with this magnificent symbol.* For the &quot;<I>ten</I> limbs&quot;
of the Heavenly Man are the ten Sephiroth; but the first Heavenly
Man is the unmanifested Spirit of the Universe, and ought never
to be degraded into Microprosopus -- the lesser Face or Countenance,
the prototype of man on the terrestrial plane.** Of this, however,
later on. The six-pointed Star refers to the six Forces or Powers
of Nature, the six planes, principles, etc., etc., all synthesized
by the seventh, or the central point in the Star. All these, the
upper and lower hierarchies included, emanate from the &quot;Heavenly
or Celestial Virgin,&quot;*** the great mother in all religions,
the Androgyne, the
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Indeed, the Microprosopus -- who is, philosophically speaking,
quite distinct from the unmanifested eternal Logos &quot;one with
the Father,&quot; -- has been finally brought, by centuries of
incessant efforts, of sophistry and paradoxes, to be considered
as one with Jehovah, or the ONE living God (!), whereas Jehovah
is no better than Binah, a female Sephiroth. This fact cannot
be too frequently impressed upon the reader.
<P>
** The Microprosopus is, as just said, the Logos manifested, and
of such there are many.
<P>
*** Sephira is the Crown, KETHER, in the abstract principle only,
as a mathematical<EM> x </EM>(the unknown quantity). On the plane
of differentiated nature she is the female counterpart of Adam
Kadmon -- the first Androgyne. The Kabala teaches that the word
&quot;<EM>Fiat Lux</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Genesis </EM>ch. i.)
referred to the formation and evolution of the Sephiroth, and
not to light as opposed to darkness. Rabbi Simeon says: &quot;Oh
com- [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 216 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
Sephira-Adam-Kadmon. In its <EM>Unity</EM>,<EM> </EM>primordial
light is the seventh, or highest, principle, <EM>Daivi-prakriti</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the light of the unmanifested Logos. But in its differentiation
it becomes <EM>Fohat</EM>,<EM> </EM>or the &quot;Seven Sons.&quot;
The former is symbolised by the Central point in the double-Triangle;
the latter by the hexagon itself, or the &quot;six limbs&quot;
of the Microprosopus the Seventh being Malkuth, the &quot;Bride&quot;
of the Christian Kabalists, or our Earth. Hence the expressions:
<P>
&quot;<EM>The first after the </EM>'<EM>One</EM>'<EM> is divine
Fire; the second</EM>,<EM> Fire and AEther; the third is composed
of Fire</EM>,<EM> AEther and Water; the fourth of Fire</EM>,<EM>
AEther</EM>,<EM> Water</EM>,<EM> and Air.</EM>&quot;<EM>* The
One is not concerned with Man-bearing globes</EM>,<EM> but with
the inner invisible Spheres. </EM>&quot;<EM>The </EM>'<EM>First-Born</EM>'<EM>
are the </EM><STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE, <EM>the heart and pulse of
the Universe; the Second are its </EM><STRONG>M</STRONG>IND <EM>or
Consciousness</EM>,&quot;<EM>**</EM> 
<P>
as said in the Commentary.
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>) The second Order of Celestial Beings, those of Fire
and AEther (corresponding to Spirit and Soul, or the Atma-Buddhi)
whose names are legion, are still formless, but more definitely
&quot;substantial.&quot; They are the first differentiation in
the Secondary Evolution or &quot;Creation&quot; -- a misleading
word. As the name shows, they are the prototypes of the incarnating
Jivas or Monads, and are composed of the Fiery Spirit of Life.
It is through these that passes, like a pure solar beam, the ray
which is furnished by them with its future vehicle, the Divine
Soul, Buddhi. These are directly concerned with the Hosts of the
higher world of <EM>our </EM>system. From these twofold <EM>Units
</EM>emanate the <EM>threefold.</EM> 
<P>
In the cosmogony of Japan, when, out of the chaotic mass, an egglike
nucleus appears, having within itself the germ and potency of
all the universal as well as of all terrestrial life, it is the
&quot;three-fold&quot; just named, which differentiates. &quot;The
male aethereal&quot; (<EM>Yo</EM>) principle

man as an emanation was both man and woman, Adam Kadmon verily,
and this is the sense of the words 'Let there be Light, and it
was Light.' And this is the two-fold man.&quot; (<EM>Auszuge aus
dem Zohar</EM>,<EM> </EM>pp. 13-15.)
<P>
* See next footnote. These elements of Fire, Air, etc., are not
our compound elements.
<P>
** This &quot;Consciousness&quot; has no relation to our consciousness.
The consciousness of the &quot;One manifested,&quot; if not absolute,
is still unconditioned. Mahat (the Universal Mind) is the first
production of the Brahma-Creator, but also of the Pradhana (undifferentiated
matter).<HR>

<P>
ascends and the female grosser or more material principle (<EM>In</EM>)
is precipitated into the Universe of substance, when a separation
occurs between the celestial and the terrestrial. From this the
female, the mother, the first rudimentary objective being is born.
It is ethereal, without form or sex, and yet it is from this and
the mother that the Seven Divine Spirits are born, from whom will
emanate <EM>the seven creations</EM>,<EM> </EM>just as in the
Codex Nazaraeus from Karabtanos and the Mother <EM>Spiritus </EM>the
seven <EM>evilly disposed </EM>(material) spirits are born. It
would be too long to give here the Japanese names, but once translated
they stand in this order: --
<P>
(1.) The &quot;Invisible Celibate,&quot; which is the creative
logos of the noncreating &quot;father,&quot; or the creative potentiality
of the latter made manifest.
<P>
(2.) &quot;The Spirit (or the God) of the rayless depths&quot;
(of Chaos); which becomes differentiated matter, or the world-stuff;
also the mineral realm.
<P>
(3.) &quot;The Spirit of the Vegetable Kingdom,&quot; of the &quot;Abundant
Vegetation.&quot;
<P>
(4.) This one is of dual nature, being at the same time &quot;The
Spirit of the Earth&quot; and &quot;the Spirit of the Sands,&quot;
the former containing the potentiality of the male element, the
latter that of the female element, the two forming a combined
nature.
<P>
These two were ONE; yet unconscious of being two.
<P>
In this duality were contained (<I>a</I>) the male, dark and muscular
Being, <EM>Isu no gai no Kami; </EM>and<EM> </EM>(<EM>b</EM>)<EM>
Eku gai no Kami</EM>,<EM> </EM>the female, fair and weaker or
more delicate Being. Then, the: --
<P>
(5th and 6th.) Spirits who were androgynous or dual-sexed, and,
finally: --
<P>
(7.) The <EM>Seventh </EM>Spirit, the last emanated from the &quot;mother,&quot;
appears as the first divine human form distinctly male and female.
It was the seventh creation, as in the Puranas, wherein man is
the seventh creation of Brahma.
<P>
These,<EM> Tsanagi-Tsanami</EM>,<EM> </EM>descended into the Universe
by the celestial Bridge (the milky way), and &quot;<EM>Tsanagi</EM>,<EM>
</EM>perceiving far below a chaotic mass of cloud and water, thrust
his jewelled spear into the depths, and dry land appeared.&quot;
Then the two separated to explore <EM>Onokoro</EM>,<EM> </EM>the
newly-created island-world; etc., etc. (<EM>Omoie</EM>)<EM>.</EM>
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 218 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
Such are the Japanese exoteric fables, the rind that conceals
the kernel of the same one truth of the Secret Doctrine. Turning
back to the esoteric explanations in every cosmogony: --
<P>
(<EM>d</EM>) The<EM> Third </EM>order corresponds to the <EM>Atma-Buddhi-Manas:
</EM>Spirit, Soul and Intellect, and is called the &quot;Triads.&quot;
<P>
(<EM>e</EM>) The<EM> Fourth </EM>are substantial Entities. This
is the highest group among the <EM>Rupas </EM>(Atomic Forms*).
It is the nursery of the human, conscious, spiritual Souls. They
are called the &quot;Imperishable Jivas,&quot; and constitute,
through the order below their own, the first group of the first
septenary** host -- the great mystery of human conscious and
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* It is worthy of notice that, while rejecting as a superstition
of Occultism, and religion too, the theory of substantial and
invisible Beings called Angels, Elementals, etc. -- without, of
course, having ever looked into the philosophy of these incorporeal
Entities, or thought over them -- modern chemistry, owing to observation
and discovery, should have unconsciously been forced to adopt
and recognize the same ratio of progression and order in the evolution
of chemical atoms as Occultism does, both for its Dhyanis and
Atoms -- analogy being its first law. As seen above, the very
first group of the Rupa Angels is quaternary, an element being
added to each in descending order. So are the atoms, adopting
the phraseology of chemistry, monatomic, diatomic, and tetratomic,
progressing downwards. Let it be remembered that Fire, Water,
and Air, or the &quot;Elements of primary Creation&quot; so-called,
are not the compound Elements they are on Earth, but noumenal
homogeneous Elements -- the Spirits thereof. Then follow the septenary
groups or hosts. Placed on parallel lines in a diagram with Atoms,
the Natures of those Beings would be seen to correspond in their
downward scale of progression to composite elements in a mathematically
identical manner, as to analogy. This refers, of course, only
to diagrams made by the Occultists; for were the scale of Angelic
Beings to be placed on a parallel line with the scale of the chemical
atoms of Science -- from the hypothetical Helium down to Uranium
-- they would of course be found to differ. For these have, as
correspondents on the Astral plane, only the four lowest orders
-- the higher three principles in the atom, or rather molecule
or chemical element, being perceptible only to the initiated Dangma's
eye. But then, if Chemistry desired to find itself on the right
path, it would have to correct its tabular arrangement by that
of the Occultists -- which it may refuse to do. In Esoteric Philosophy,
every physical particle corresponds to and depends on its higher
<I>noumenon</I> -- the Being to whose essence it belongs; and
above as below, the Spiritual evolves from the Divine, the psycho-mental
from the Spiritual -- tainted from its lower plane by the astral
-- the whole animate and (seemingly) inanimate Nature evolving
on parallel lines, and drawing its attributes from above as well
as from below.
<P>
** The number seven does not imply only seven Entities, but seven
groups or Hosts, as explained before. The highest group, the Asuras
born in Brahma's first body -- [[Footnote continued on next page]]

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 219 THE HIERARCHIES OF SPIRITS.</H6>

<P>
intellectual Being. For the latter are the field wherein lies
concealed <EM>in its privation </EM>the germ <EM>that will fall
into generation. </EM>That germ will become the spiritual potency
in the physical cell that guides the development of the embryo,
and which is the cause of the hereditary transmission of faculties
and all the inherent qualities in man. The Darwinian theory, however,
of the transmission of acquired faculties, is neither taught nor
accepted in Occultism. Evolution, in it, proceeds on quite other
lines; the physical, according to esoteric teaching, evolving
gradually from the spiritual, mental, and psychic. This inner
soul of the physical cell -- this &quot;spiritual plasm&quot;
that dominates the germinal plasm -- is the key that must open
one day the gates of the terra incognita of the Biologist, now
called the dark mystery of Embryology. (<EM>See text and note
infra.</EM>)
<P>
(<EM>f</EM>) The Fifth group is a very mysterious one, as it is
connected with the Microcosmic Pentagon, the five-pointed star
representing man. In India and Egypt these Dhyanis were connected
with the Crocodile, and their abode is in Capricornus. These are
convertible terms in Indian astrology, as this (tenth) sign of
the Zodiac is called <EM>Makara</EM>,<EM> </EM>loosely translated
&quot;crocodile.&quot; The word itself is occultly interpreted
in various ways, as will be shown further on. In Egypt the defunct
man -- whose symbol is the pentagram or the five-pointed star,
the points of which represent the limbs of a man -- was shown
emblematically transformed into a crocodile: Sebakh or Sevekh
&quot;or seventh,&quot; as Mr. Gerald Massey says, showing it
as having been the type of intelligence, is a dragon in reality,
not a crocodile. He is the &quot;Dragon of Wisdom&quot; or Manas,
the &quot;Human Soul,&quot; Mind, the Intelligent principle, called
in our esoteric philosophy the &quot;Fifth&quot; principle.
<P>
Says the defunct &quot;Osirified&quot; in ch. lxxxviii., &quot;Book
of the Dead,&quot; or the <EM>Ritual</EM>,<EM> </EM>under the
glyph of a mummiform god with a crocodile's head: --
<P>
(1) &quot;I am the god (crocodile) presiding at the fear . . .
at the arrival of his Soul among men. I am the god-crocodile brought
for destruction&quot; (an allusion to the destruction of divine
spiritual purity
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] which turned into &quot;Night&quot;
-- are septenary, <EM>i.e.</EM>, divided like the Pitris into
seven classes, three of which are arupa (bodiless) and four with
bodies. (See Vishnu Purana, Book I.) They are in fact more truly
our <EM>Pitris </EM>(ancestors) than the Pitris who projected
the first physical men. (See Book II.)<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 220 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
when man acquires the knowledge of good and evil; also to the
&quot;fallen&quot; gods, or angels of every theogony).
<P>
(2) &quot;I am the fish of the great Horus (as <EM>Mankara </EM>is
the &quot;crocodile,&quot; the vehicle of Varuna). I am merged
in Sekten.&quot;
<P>
This last sentence gives the corroboration of, and repeats the
doctrine of, esoteric Buddhism, for it alludes directly to the
fifth principle (Manas), or the most spiritual part of its essence
rather, which merges into, is absorbed by, and made one with Atma-Buddhi
after the death of man. For Se-khen is the residence or <EM>loka
</EM>of the god Khem (Horus-Osiris, or Father and Son), hence
the &quot;Devachan&quot; of Atma-Buddhi. In the Ritual of the
Dead the defunct is shown entering into Sekhem with Horus-Thot
and &quot;emerging from it as pure spirit&quot; (lxiv., 29). Thus
the defunct says (v. 130): &quot;I see the forms of (myself, as
various) men transforming eternally . . . I know this (chapter).
He who knows it . . . takes all kinds of living forms.&quot; .
. .
<P>
And in verse 35, addressing in magic formula that which is called,
in Egyptian esotericism, the &quot;ancestral heart,&quot; or the
re-incarnating principle, the permanent <STRONG>E</STRONG>GO,
the defunct says: --
<P>
&quot;Oh my heart, my ancestral heart necessary for my transformations,
. . . . . . do not separate thyself from me before the guardian
of the Scales. Thou art my personality within my breast, divine
companion <EM>watching over my fleshes </EM>(bodies). . . . .
. .&quot;
<P>
It is in Sekhem that lies concealed &quot;the Mysterious Face,&quot;
or the real man concealed under the false personality, the triple-crocodile
of Egypt, the symbol of the higher Trinity or human Triad, <EM>Atma</EM>,<EM>
Buddhi </EM>and<EM> Manas.* </EM>In all the ancient papyri the
crocodile is called <EM>Sebek </EM>(Seventh), while the water
is the fifth principle esoterically; and, as already stated, Mr.
Gerald Massey shows that the crocodile was &quot;the Seventh Soul,
the supreme one of seven -- the Seer unseen.&quot; Even exoterically
<EM>Sekhem </EM>is the residence of the god Khem, and Khem is
Horus avenging the death of his father Osiris, hence punishing
the Sins of man when he becomes a disembodied Soul. Thus the defunct
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* One of the explanations of the real though hidden meaning of
this Egyptian religious glyph is easy. The crocodile is the first
to await and meet the devouring fires of the morning sun, and
very soon came to personify the solar heat. When the sun arose,
it was like the arrival on earth and among men &quot;of the divine
soul which informs the Gods.&quot; Hence the strange symbolism.
The mummy donned the head of a crocodile to show that it was a
soul arriving from the earth.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 221 CORRELATION OF BEINGS.</H6>

<P>
&quot;Osirified&quot; became the god Khem, who &quot;gleans the
field of <EM>Aanroo</EM>,&quot;<EM> i.e.</EM>, he gleans either
his reward or punishment, as that field is the celestial locality
(Devachan) where the defunct is given <EM>wheat</EM>,<EM> </EM>the
food of divine justice. The fifth group of the celestial Beings
is supposed to contain in itself the dual attributes of both the
spiritual and physical aspects of the Universe; the two poles,
so to say, of Mahat the Universal Intelligence, and the dual nature
of man, the spiritual and the physical. Hence its number Five,
multiplied and made into ten, connecting it with <EM>Makara</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the 10th sign of Zodiac.
<P>
(<EM>g</EM>)<EM> </EM>The sixth and seventh groups partake of
the lower qualities of the Quaternary. They are conscious, ethereal
Entities, as invisible as Ether, which are shot out like the boughs
of a tree from the first central group of the four, and shoot
out in their turn numberless side groups, the lower of which are
the Nature-Spirits, or Elementals of countless kinds and varieties;
from the formless and unsubstantial -- the ideal THOUGHTS of their
creators -- down to the Atomic, though, to human perception, invisible
organisms. The latter are considered as the &quot;Spirits of Atoms&quot;
for they are the first remove (backwards) from the physical Atom
-- sentient, if not intelligent creatures. They are all subject
to Karma, and have to work it out through every cycle. For, as
the doctrine teaches, there are no such privileged beings in the
universe, whether in our or in other systems, in the outer or
the inner worlds,* as the angels of the Western Religion and the
Judean. A Dhyan Chohan has to become one; he cannot be born or
appear suddenly on the plane of life as a full-blown angel. The
Celestial Hierarchy of the present Manvantara will find itself
transferred in the next cycle of life into higher, superior worlds,
and will make room for a new hierarchy, composed of the elect
ones of our mankind. Being is an endless cycle within the one
absolute eternity, wherein move numberless inner cycles finite
and conditioned. Gods, created as such, would evince no personal
merit in being gods. Such a class of beings, perfect only by virtue
of the special immaculate nature inherent in them, in the face
of suffering and struggling humanity, and even of the lower creation,
would be the

by reason of its location, but because it is superior in quality

symbol of an eternal injustice quite Satanic in character, an

Therefore the &quot;Four&quot; and the &quot;Three&quot; have
to incarnate as all other beings have. This sixth group, moreover,
remains almost inseparable from man, who draws from it all but
his highest and lowest principles, or his spirit and body, the
five middle human principles being the very essence of those Dhyanis.*
Alone, the Divine Ray (the Atman) proceeds directly from the One.
When asked how that can be? How is it possible to conceive that
those &quot;gods,&quot; or angels, can be at the same time their
own emanations and their personal selves? Is it in the same sense
in the material world, where the son is (in one way) his father,
being his blood, the bone of his bone and the flesh of his flesh?
To this the teachers answer &quot;Verily it is so.&quot; But one
has to go deep into the mystery of BEING before one can fully
comprehend this truth.

Science has provided for all this; and, I dare say, her theories,
embryological, biological, and physiological, are correct enough
so far as exact observation of the material goes. Nevertheless,
the two chief difficulties of the science of embryology -- namely,
what are the forces at work in the formation of the foetus, and
the <EM>cause </EM>of &quot;hereditary transmission&quot; of likeness,
physical, moral or mental -- have never been properly answered;
nor will they ever be solved till the day when scientists condescend
to accept the Occult theories.* But if this physical pheno-

<P>
* The materialists and the evolutionists of the Darwinian school
would be ill-advised to accept the newly worked-out theories of
Professor Weissmann, the author of <EM>Beitrage zur Descendenzlehre</EM>,<EM>
</EM>with regard to one of the two mysteries of Embryology, as
above specified, which he seems to have solved -- as he thinks.
For, when it is solved, Science will have stepped over into the
domain of the truly occult, and stepped for ever out of the realm
of transformation, as taught by Darwin. The two are irreconcileable,
from the standpoint of materialism. Regarded from that of the
Occultists, it solves all these mysteries. Those who are not acquainted
with the new discovery of Professor Weissman -- at one time a
fervent Darwinist -- ought to hasten to repair the deficiency.
The German Embryologist-philosopher shows -- thus stepping over
the heads of the Greek Hippocrates and Aristotle, right back into
the teachings of the old Aryans -- one infinitesimal cell, out
of millions of others at work in the formation of an organism,
determining alone and unaided, by means of constant segmentation
and multiplication, the correct image of the future man (or animal)
in its physical, mental, and psychic characteristics. It is that
cell which impresses on the face and form of the new individual
the features of the parents or of some distant ancestor; it is
that cell again which transmits to him the intellectual and mental
idiosyncracies of his sires, and so on. This Plasm is the immortal
portion of our bodies -- simply through the process of successive
assimilations. Darwin's theory, viewing the embryological cell
as an essence or the extract from all other cells, is set aside;
it is incapable of accounting for hereditary transmission. There
are but two ways of explaining the mystery of heredity; either
the substance of the germinal cell is endowed with the faculty
of crossing the whole cycle of transformations that lead to the
construction of a separate organism and then to the reproduction
of identical germinal cells; or, <EM>those germinal cells do not
have their genesis at all in the body of the individual</EM>,<EM>
but proceed directly from the ancestral germinal cell passed from
father to son through long generations. </EM>It is the latter
hypothesis that Weissmann accepted and has worked upon; and it
is to this cell that he traces the immortal portion of man. So
far, so good; and when this almost correct theory is accepted,
how will Biologists explain the first appearance of this everlasting
cell? Unless man &quot;grew&quot; like the &quot;immortal Topsy,&quot;
and was not born at all, but fell from the clouds, how was that
embryological cell born in him?<HR>

menon astonishes no one, except in so far as it puzzles the Embryologists,
why should our intellectual and inner growth, the evolution of
the human-spiritual to the Divine-Spiritual, be regarded as, or
seem, more impossible than the other? Now to the simile.
<P>
Complete the physical plasm, mentioned in the last foot-note,
the &quot;Germinal Cell&quot; of man with all its material potentialities,
with the &quot;spiritual plasm,&quot; so to say, or the fluid
that contains the five lower principles of the six-principled
Dhyan -- and you have the secret, if you are spiritual enough
to understand it.
<P>
&quot;When the seed of the animal man is cast into the soil of
the animal woman, that seed cannot germinate unless it has been
fructified by the five virtues (the fluid of, or the emanation
from the principles) of the six-fold Heavenly man. Wherefore the
Microcosm is represented as a Pentagon, within the Hexagon Star,
the &quot;Macrocosm.&quot; (&quot;[[<EM>Anthropos</EM>]],&quot;)
a work on Occult Embryology, Book I.). Then: &quot;The functions
of <EM>Jiva </EM>on this Earth are of a five-fold character. In
the mineral atom it is connected with the lowest principles of
the Spirits of the Earth (the six-fold Dhyanis); in the vegetable
particle, with their second -- the <EM>Prana </EM>(life); in the
animal, with all these plus the third and the fourth; in man,
the germ must receive the fruition of all the five. Otherwise
he will be born no higher than an animal&quot;; namely, a congenital
idiot. Thus in man alone the Jiva is complete. As to his seventh
principle, it is but one of the Beams of the Universal Sun. Each
rational creature receives only the temporary loan of that which
has to return to its source; while his physical body is shaped
by the lowest terrestrial lives, through physical, chemical, and
physiological evolution. &quot;The Blessed Ones have nought to
do with the purgations of matter.&quot; (Kabala, Chaldean Book
of Numbers).
<P>
It comes to this: Mankind in its first prototypal, shadowy form,
is the offspring of the Elohim of Life (or Pitris); in its qualitative
and physical aspect it is the direct progeny of the &quot;Ancestors,&quot;
the lowest Dhyanis, or Spirits of the Earth; for its moral, psychic,
and spiritual nature, it is indebted to a group of divine Beings,
the name and characteristics of which will be given in Book II.
Collectively, men are the handiwork of hosts of various spirits;
distributively, the tabernacles of those hosts; and occasionally
and singly, the vehicles of some of them. In our present all-material
Fifth Race, the earthly Spirit of the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 225 SPIRIT FALLING INTO MATTER.</H6>

<P>
Fourth is still strong in us; but we are approaching the time
when the pendulum of evolution will direct its swing decidedly
upwards, bringing Humanity back on a parallel line with the primitive
third Root-Race in Spirituality. During its childhood, mankind
was composed wholly of that Angelic Host, who were the indwelling
Spirits that animated the monstrous and gigantic tabernacles of
clay of the Fourth Race built by (as they are now also) and composed
of countless myriads of lives.* This sentence will be explained
later on in the present Commentary. The &quot;tabernacles&quot;
have improved in texture and symmetry of form, growing and developing
with the globe that bore them; but the physical improvement took
place at the expense of the spiritual inner man and nature. The
three middle principles in earth and man became with every race
more material; the Soul stepping back to make room for the physical
intellect; the essence of elements becoming the material and composite
elements now known.
<P>
Man is not, nor could he ever be, the complete product of the
&quot;Lord God&quot;; but he <EM>is </EM>the child of the <EM>Elohim</EM>,<EM>
</EM>so arbitrarily changed into the singular masculine gender.
The first Dhyanis, commissioned to &quot;create&quot; man in their
image, could only throw off their shadows, like a delicate model
for the Nature Spirits of matter to work upon. (See Book II.)
Man is, beyond any doubt, formed physically out of the dust of
the Earth, but his creators and fashioners were many. Nor can
it be said that the &quot;Lord God breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life,&quot; unless that God is identified with the
&quot;<STRONG>O</STRONG>NE <STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE,&quot; Omnipresent
though invisible, and unless the same operation is attributed
to &quot;God&quot; on behalf of every <EM>living Soul</EM> --<EM>
</EM>or<EM> Nephesch</EM>,<EM> </EM>which is the <EM>vital </EM>Soul,
not the divine Spirit or <EM>Ruach</EM>,<EM> </EM>which ensures
to man alone a divine degree of immortality, that no animal, as
such, could ever attain in this cycle of incarnation. It is the
inadequate distinctions made by the Jews, and now by our Western
metaphysicians, who, not knowing of, and being unable to understand,
hence to accept, more than a triune man -- Spirit, Soul,

infinitesimals in the human body, and see in them but occasional
and abnormal visitors to which diseases are attributed. Occultism
-- which discerns a life in every atom and molecule, whether in
a mineral or human body, in air, fire or water -- affirms that
our whole body is built of such lives, the smallest bacteria under
the microscope being to them in comparative size like an elephant

Body -- thus confuse the &quot;breath of life&quot; with immortal
Spirit.* This applies also directly to the Protestant theologians,
who, in translating verse 8 of Ch. III. in the Fourth Gospel,
have entirely perverted the meaning. Indeed the verse is made
to say &quot;The <EM>wind </EM>bloweth where it listeth,&quot;
instead of &quot;the <EM>Spirit </EM>goeth where it willeth,&quot;
as in the original and also in the translation of the Greek Eastern
Church.
<P>
Thus the philosophy of psychic, spiritual, and mental relations
with man's physical functions is in almost inextricable confusion.
Neither the old Aryan, nor the Egyptian psychology are now properly
understood. Nor can they be assimilated without accepting the
esoteric septenary, or, at any rate, the Vedantic quinquepartite
division of the human inner principles. Failing which, it will
be for ever impossible to understand the metaphysical and purely
psychic and even physiological relations between the Dhyan-Chohans,
or Angels, on the one plane, and humanity on the other. No Eastern
(Aryan) esoteric works are so far published, but we possess the
Egyptian papyri which speak clearly

<P>
* The learned and very philosophical author of &quot;New Aspects
of Life&quot; would impress upon his reader that the <EM>Nephesh
chaiah </EM>(living soul), according to the Hebrews, &quot;proceeded
from, or was produced by, the infusion of the Spirit or Breath
of Life into the quickening body of man, and was to supersede
and take the place of that spirit in the thus constituted self,
so that the spirit passed into, was lost sight of, and disappeared
in the living Soul.&quot; The human body, he thinks, ought to
be viewed as a matrix in which, and from which, the Soul (which
he seems to place higher than the spirit) is developed -- considered
<EM>functionally </EM>and from the standpoint of activity, the
Soul stands undeniably higher in this finite and conditioned world
of Maya -- the Soul, he says, &quot;is ultimately produced from
the animated body of man.&quot; Thus the author identifies &quot;Spirit&quot;
(Atma) simply with &quot;the breath of life.&quot; The Eastern
Occultists will demur to this statement, for it is based on the
erroneous conception that <EM>Prana</EM> and<EM> Atma </EM>or<EM>
Jivatma </EM>are one and the same thing. The author supports the
argument by showing that with the ancient Hebrews, Greeks and
even Latins, <EM>Ruach</EM>,<EM> Pneuma </EM>and<EM> Spiritus</EM>
-- with the Jews undeniably, and with the Greeks and Romans very
probably -- meant Wind; the Greek word <EM>Anemos </EM>(wind)
and the Latin <EM>Anima </EM>&quot;Soul&quot; having a suspicious
relation.
<P>
This is very far fetched. A legitimate battle-field for deciding
this question is hardly to be found, since Mr. Pratt seems to
be a practical, matter-of-fact metaphysician, a kind of Kabalist-Positivist,
and the Eastern metaphysicians, especially the Vedantins, are
all Idealists. The Occultists are also of the extreme esoteric
Vedantin school, and they call the One Life (Parabrahm), the Great
Breath and the Whirlwind; but they disconnect the seventh principle
entirely from matter or any relation to, or connection with it.

of the seven principles or the &quot;Seven Souls of Man.&quot;*
The Book of the Dead gives a complete list of the &quot;transformations&quot;
that every defunct undergoes, while divesting himself, one by
one, of all those principles -- materialised for the sake of clearness
into ethereal entities or bodies. We must, moreover, remind those
who try to prove that the ancient Egyptians knew nothing of and
did not teach Reincarnation, that the &quot;Soul&quot; (the <EM>Ego
</EM>or<EM> Self</EM>)<EM> </EM>of the defunct is said to be living
in Eternity: it is immortal, &quot;co-eval with, and disappearing
with the Solar boat,&quot; <EM>i.e.</EM>, for the cycle of necessity.
This &quot;Soul&quot; <EM>emerges from the Tiaou </EM>(the realm
<EM>of the cause of life</EM>)<EM> </EM>and joins the living on
Earth <EM>by</EM> <EM>day</EM>,<EM> </EM>to return to <EM>Tiaou

Like alone produces like. The Earth gives Man his body, the gods

** Another suggestive analogy between the Aryan or Brahmanical
and the Egyptian esotericism. The former call the Pitris &quot;the
lunar ancestors&quot; of men; and the Egyptians made of the Moon-God,
Taht-Esmun, the first human ancestor. This &quot;moon-god&quot;
&quot;expressed the Seven nature-powers that were prior to himself,
and were summed up in him as his seven souls, of which he was
the manifestor as the eighth one (hence the eighth sphere). The
seven rays of the Chaldean Heptakis or Iao, on the Gnostic stones
indicate the same septenary of souls.&quot; . . . &quot;The first
form of the mystical SEVEN was seen to be figured in heaven, by
the seven large stars of the Great Bear, the constellation assigned
by the Egyptians to the Mother of Time, and of the seven elemental
powers.&quot; (See<EM> The Seven Souls</EM>,<EM> </EM>etc.) As
well known to every Hindu, this same constellation represents
in India the Seven Rishis, and as such is called <EM>Riksha</EM>,<EM>

esotericism, came out from the moon (a triple mystery -- astronomical,
physiological, and psychical at once); he crossed the whole cycle
of existence and then returned to his birth-place before issuing
from it again. Thus the defunct is shown arriving in the West,
receiving his judgment before Osiris, resurrecting as the god
Horus, and circling round the sidereal heavens, which is an allegorical
assimilation to Ra, the Sun; then having crossed the <EM>Noot
</EM>(the celestial abyss), returning once more to Tiaou: an assimilation
to Osiris, who, as the God of life and reproduction, inhabits
the moon. Plutarch (Isis and Osiris, ch. xliii.) shows the Egyptians
celebrating a festival called &quot;The Ingress of Osiris into
the moon.&quot; In chapter xli. life is promised after death;
and the renovation of life is placed under the patronage of Osiris-Lunus,
because the moon was the symbol of life-renewals or reincarnations,
owing to its growth, waning, dying, and reappearance every month.
In the <EM>Dankmoe</EM>,<EM> </EM>(iv.<EM> </EM>5) it is said:
-- &quot;Oh, Osiris-Lunus! That renews to thee thy renewal.&quot;
And Safekh says to Seti I. (Mariette's Abydos, plate 51), &quot;Thou
renewest thyself as the god Lunus when a babe.&quot; It is still
better explained in a Louvre papyrus (P. Pierret, &quot;Etudes
Egyptologiques&quot;): &quot;Couplings and conceptions abound
when he (Osiris-Lunus) is seen in heaven on that day.&quot; Says
Osiris: &quot;Oh, sole radiant beam of the moon! I issue from
the circulating multitudes (of stars) . . . . . . Open me the
Tiaou, for Osiris N. I will issue by day to do what I have to
do amongst the living&quot; (&quot;Book of the Dead,&quot; ch.
ii.), -- <EM>i.e.</EM>,<EM> </EM>to produce conceptions.
<P>
Osiris was &quot;God manifest in generation,&quot; because the
ancients knew, far better than the moderns, the real occult influences
of the lunar body upon the mysteries of conception.* Later on,
when the moon became connected with female goddesses** -- with
Diana, Isis, Artemis,

* In the oldest systems we find the Moon always male. Thus Soma
is, with the Hindus, a kind of sidereal Don Juan, a &quot;King,&quot;
and the father, albeit illegitimate, of Buddha -- Wisdom, which
relates to Occult Knowledge, a wisdom gathered through a thorough
acquaintance with lunar mysteries including those of sexual generation.
(See &quot;Holy of Holies.&quot;)
<P>
** If instead of being taught in Sunday Schools useless lessons
from the Bible, the armies of the ragged and the poor were taught
Astrology -- so far, at any rate, as the occult properties of
the Moon and its hidden influences on generation are concerned,
then there would be little need to fear increase of the population
nor to resort to the questionable literature of the Malthusians
for its arrest. For it is the Moon and her [[Footnote continued

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 229 MANY STREAMS, BUT ONE SOURCE.</H6>

<P>
Juno, etc., that connection was due to a thorough knowledge of
physiology and female nature, physical as much as psychic. But,
primarily, the Sun and Moon were the only visible and, so to say,
<EM>tangible </EM>[by their effects] psychic and physiological
deities -- the Father and the Son, while Space and air in general,
or that expanse of Heaven called Noot by the Egyptians, was the
concealed Spirit or Breath of the two. These &quot;Father and
Son&quot; were interchangeable in their functions and worked harmoniously
together in their effects upon terrestrial nature and humanity;
hence they were regarded as ONE, though TWO in personified Entities.
They were both males, and both had their distinct and also collaborative
work in the causative generation of Humanity. So much from the
astronomical and cosmic standpoints viewed and expressed in symbolical
language -- which became in our last races theological and dogmatic.
But behind this veil of Cosmic and Astrological symbols, there
were the Occult mysteries of Anthropography and the primeval genesis
of man. And in this, no knowledge of symbols -- or even the key
to the <EM>post-diluvian </EM>symbolical language of the Jews
-- will, or can help, save only with reference to that which was
laid down in national scriptures for exoteric uses; the sum of
which, however cleverly veiled, was only the smallest portion
of the real primitive history of each people, often relating,
moreover, -- as in the Hebrew Scriptures -- merely to the terrestrial
human, not divine life of that nation. That psychic and spiritual
element belonged to MYSTERY and INITIATION. There were things
never recorded in scrolls, but, as in Central Asia, on rocks and
in subterranean crypts.
<P>
Nevertheless, there was a time when the whole world was &quot;of
one lip and of one knowledge,&quot; and Man knew more of his origin
than he does now, and thus knew that the Sun and Moon, however
large a part they do play in the constitution, growth and development
of the human body, were not the direct causative agents of his
appearance on Earth;

conceptions, and every astrologer in India knows it. During the
previous and the present races, at least at the beginning of this
one, those who indulged in marital relations during certain lunar
phases that made those relations sterile were regarded as sorcerers
and sinners. But even now those sins of old, based on the Occult
knowledge and the abuse of it, would appear preferable to the
crimes of to-day, which are perpetrated because of the complete
ignorance of, and disbelief in all such occult influences.<HR>

<P>
these agents being, in truth, the living and intelligent Powers
which the Occultists call Dhyan Chohans.
<P>
As to this, a very learned admirer of the Jewish Esotericism tells
us that &quot;the Kabala says expressly that Elohim is a '<EM>general
abstraction</EM>'<EM>; </EM>what we call in mathematics 'a constant
co-efficient' or a 'general function' entering into all construction,
not particular; that is, by the general ratio 1 to 31415, (the
astro-Dhyanic and) Elohistic figures.&quot; To this the Eastern
Occultist replies: Quite so, it is an abstraction to our physical
senses. To our spiritual perceptions, however, and to our inner
spiritual eye, the Elohim or Dhyanis are no more an abstraction
than our soul and spirit are to us. Reject the one and you reject
the other -- since that which is the <EM>surviving Entity in us
</EM>is partly the direct emanation from, and partly <EM>those
celestial Entities themselves. </EM>One thing is sure; the Jews
were perfectly acquainted with sorcery and various maleficent
forces; but, with the exception of some of their great prophets
and seers like Daniel and Ezekiel (Enoch belonging to a far distant
race and not to any nation but to all, as a generic character),
they knew little of, nor would they deal with, the real divine
Occultism, their national character being averse to anything which
had no direct bearing upon their own ethnical, tribal, and individual
benefits -- witness their own prophets, and the curses thundered
by them against the &quot;stiff-necked race.&quot; But even the
Kabala plainly shows the direct relation between the Sephiroth,
or Elohim, and men.
<P>
Therefore, when it is proved to us that the Kabalistic identification
of Jehovah with Binah, a female Sephiroth, has still another,
a sub-occult meaning in it, then and then only the Occultist will
be ready to pass the palm of perfection to the Kabalist. Until
then, it is asserted that, as Jehovah is in the abstract sense
of a &quot;one living God,&quot; a single number, a metaphysical
figment, and a reality only when put in his proper place as an
emanation and a Sephiroth -- we have a right to maintain that
the Zohar (as witnessed by the <STRONG>B</STRONG>OOK OF <STRONG>N</STRONG>UMBERS,
at any rate), gave out originally, before the Christian Kabalists
had disfigured it, and still gives out the same doctrine that
we do; <EM>i.e.</EM>,<EM> </EM>it makes Man emanate, not from
one Celestial <STRONG>M</STRONG>AN, but from a Septenary group
of Celestial men or Angels, just as in &quot;Pymander, the Thought
Divine.&quot;<HR>

This is the metaphysical explanation, and refers to the very beginning
of Evolution, or, as we should rather say, of Theogony. The meaning
of the Stanza when explained from another standpoint in its reference
to the mystery of man and his origin, is still more difficult
to comprehend. In order to form a clear conception of what is
meant by the One becoming two, and then being transformed into
the &quot;three-fold,&quot; the student has to make himself thoroughly
acquainted with what we call &quot;Rounds.&quot; If he refers
to &quot;Esoteric Buddhism&quot; -- the first attempt to sketch
out an approximate outline of archaic Cosmogony -- he will find
that by a &quot;Round&quot; is meant the serial evolution of nascent

taught in our earlier volume, &quot;Isis Unveiled.&quot; Though
in that work the doctrine could only be hinted at, there are many
passages, nevertheless, in which the septenary constitution of
both man and chain is openly mentioned. Speaking of the Elohim
in Vol. II., page 420, it is said: &quot;They remain over the
seventh heaven (or spiritual world), for it is they who, according
to the Kabalists, formed in succession the six material worlds,
or rather, attempts at worlds that preceded our own, which, they
say, is the seventh.&quot; Our globe is, of course, upon the diagram
representing the &quot;chain,&quot; the seventh and the lowest;
though, [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

<P>
vegetable, and animal kingdoms (man being there included in the
latter and standing at the head of it) during the whole period
of a life-cycle. The latter would be called by the Brahmins &quot;a
Day of Brahma.&quot; It is, in short, one revolution of the &quot;Wheel&quot;
(our planetary chain), which is composed of seven globes (or seven
separate &quot;Wheels,&quot; in another sense this time). When
evolution has run downward into matter, from planet A to planet
G, or Z, as the Western students call it, it is one Round. In
the middle of the Fourth revolution, which is our present &quot;Round&quot;:
&quot;Evolution has reached its acme of physical development,
crowned its work with the perfect physical man, and, from this
point, begins its work spirit-ward.&quot; All this needs little
repetition, as it is well explained in &quot;Esoteric Buddhism.&quot;
That which was hardly touched upon, and of which the little that
was said has misled many, is the origin of man, and it is upon
this that a little more light may now be thrown, just enough to
make the Stanza more comprehensible, as the process will be fully
explained only in its legitimate place, in Book II.
<P>
Now every &quot;Round&quot; (on the descending scale) is but a
repetition in a more concrete form of the Round which preceded
it, as every globe -- down to our fourth sphere (the actual earth)
-- is a grosser and more material copy of the more shadowy sphere
which precedes it in their successive order, on the three higher
planes. (See diagram in Stanza VI. Comm. 6). On its way upwards
on the ascending arc, Evolution spiritualises and etherealises,
so to speak, the general nature of all, bringing it on to a level
with the plane on which the twin globe on the opposite side is
placed; the result being, that when the seventh globe is reached
(in whatever Round) the nature of everything that is evolving
returns to the condition it was in at its starting point -- plus,
every time, a new and superior degree in the states of consciousness.
Thus it becomes clear that the &quot;origin of man,&quot; so-called,
on this our present
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] as the evolution on
these globes is cyclic, it is the fourth in descending the arc
of matter. And again, on page 367, Vol. II., it is written: &quot;In
the Egyptian notions, <EM>as in those of all other faiths founded
on philosophy</EM>,<EM> </EM>man was not merely . . . an union
of soul and body; he was a trinity when spirit was added to it;
and besides that doctrine made him consist of body, astral form,
or shadow, the animal soul, the higher soul, and terrestrial intelligence
and a sixth principle, etc., etc. -- the seventh -- <STRONG>S</STRONG>PIRIT.&quot;
So clearly are these principles mentioned, that even in the <EM>Index</EM>,<EM>
</EM>one finds on page 683: -- \&quot;Six principles of man&quot;
-- the seventh being the synthesis of the six, and <EM>not a principle
</EM>but a ray of the Absolute <STRONG>A</STRONG>LL -- in strict
truth.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 233 WHAT INCARNATES IN ANIMAL MAN.</H6>

<P>
Round, or life-cycle on this planet, must occupy the same place
in the same order -- save details based on local conditions and
time -- as in the preceding Round. Again, it must be explained
and remembered that, as the work of each Round is said to be apportioned
to a different group of so-called &quot;Creators&quot; or &quot;Architects,&quot;
so is that of every globe; <EM>i.e.</EM>, it is under the supervision
and guidance of special &quot;Builders&quot; and &quot;Watchers&quot;
-- the various Dhyan-Chohans.
<P>
The group of the hierarchy which is commissioned to &quot;create&quot;*
men is a special group, then; yet it evolved shadowy man in this
cycle just as a higher and still more spiritual group evolved
him in the Third Round. But as it is the Sixth -- on the downward
scale of Spirituality -- the last and seventh being the terrestrial
Spirits (elementals) which gradually form, build, and condense
his physical body -- this Sixth group evolves no more than the
future man's shadowy form, a filmy, hardly visible transparent
copy of themselves. It becomes the task of the fifth Hierarchy
-- the mysterious beings that preside over the constellation Capricornus,
Makara, or &quot;Crocodile&quot; in India as in Egypt -- to inform
the empty and ethereal animal form and make of it the Rational
Man. This is one of those subjects upon which very little may
be said to the general public. It is a MYSTERY, truly, but only
to him who is prepared to reject the existence of intellectual
and conscious spiritual Beings in the Universe, limiting full
Consciousness to man alone, and that only as a &quot;function
of the Brain.&quot; Many are those among the Spiritual Entities,
who have incarnated bodily in man, since the beginning of his
appearance, and who, for all that, still exist as independently
as they did before, in the infinitudes of Space. . . .
<P>
To put it more clearly: the invisible Entity may be bodily present
on earth without abandoning, however, its status and functions
in the supersensuous regions. If this needs explanation, we can
do no better than remind the reader of like cases in Spiritualism,
though such cases are very rare, at least as regards the nature
of the Entity incarnating,**
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* Creation is an incorrect word to use, as no religion, not even
the sect of the Visishta Adwaitees in India -- one which anthropomorphises
even Parabrahmam -- believes in creation out of <EM>nihil </EM>as
Christians and Jews do, but in evolution out of preexisting materials.
<P>
** The so-called &quot;Spirits&quot; that may occasionally possess
themselves of the bodies of mediums are not the Monads or Higher
Principles of disembodied personalities. Such a &quot;Spirit&quot;
can only be either an Elementary, or -- a Nirmanakaya.<HR>

or taking temporary possession of a medium. Just as certain persons
-- men and women, reverting to parallel cases among living persons
-- whether by virtue of a peculiar organization, or through the
power of acquired mystic knowledge, can be seen in their &quot;double&quot;
in one place, while the body is many miles away; so the same thing
can occur in the case of superior Beings.
<P>
Man, philosophically considered, is, in his outward form, simply
an animal, hardly more perfect than his pithecoid-like ancestor
of the third round. He is a living body, not a living being, since
the realisation of existence, the &quot;Ego-Sum,&quot; necessitates
self-consciousness, and an animal can only have direct consciousness,
or instinct. This was so well understood by the Ancients that
the Kabalist even made of soul and body two lives, independent
of each other.* The soul, whose body vehicle is the Astral, ethero-substantial
envelope, could die and man be still living on earth -- <EM>i.e.</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the soul could free itself from and quit the tabernacle for
various reasons -- such as insanity, spiritual and physical depravity,
etc.** Therefore, that which living men (Initiates)

<P>
* On p. 340-351 (Genesis of the Soul) in the &quot;<EM>New Aspects
of Life</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>the Author states the Kabalistic
teaching: &quot;They held that, functionally, Spirit and Matter
of corresponding opacity and density tended to coalesce; and that
the resultant created Spirits, in the disembodied state, were
constituted on a scale in which the differing opacities and transparencies
of Elemental or uncreated Spirit were reproduced. And that these
Spirits in the disembodied state attracted, appropriated, digested
and assimilated Elemental Spirit and Elemental Matter whose condition
was conformed to their own.&quot; &quot;They therefore taught
that there was a wide difference in the condition of created Spirits;
and that in the intimate association between the Spirit-world
and the world of Matter, the more opaque Spirits in the disembodied
state were drawn towards the more dense parts of the material
world, and therefore tended towards the centre of the Earth, where
they found the conditions most suited to their state; while the
more transparent Spirits passed into the surrounding aura of the
planet, the most rarified finding their home in its satellite.&quot;
<P>
This relates exclusively to our Elementary Spirits, and has naught
to do with either the Planetary, Sidereal, Cosmic or Inter-Etheric
Intelligent Forces or &quot;Angels&quot; as they are termed by
the Roman Church. The Jewish Kabalists, especially the practical
Occultists who dealt with ceremonial magic, busied themselves
solely with the spirits of the Planets and the &quot;Elementals&quot;
so-called. Therefore this covers only a portion of the Esoteric
Teaching.
<P>
** The possibility of the &quot;Soul&quot; (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the
eternal Spiritual Ego) dwelling in the unseen worlds, while its
body goes on living on Earth, is a pre-eminently occult doctrine,
especially in Chinese and Buddhist philosophy. See &quot;Isis
Unveiled,&quot; vol. i., [[Footnote continued on next page]]

<P>
can do, the Dhyanis, who have no physical body to hamper them,
can do still better. This was the belief of the Antediluvians,
and it is fast becoming that of modern intellectual society, in
Spiritualism, besides the Greek and Roman Churches, which teach
the ubiquity of their angels. The Zoroastrians regarded their
Amshaspends as dual entities (Ferouers), applying this duality
-- in esoteric philosophy, at any rate -- to all the spiritual
and invisible denizens of the numberless worlds in space which
are visible to our eye. In a note of Damascius (sixth century)
on the Chaldean oracles, we have a triple evidence of the universality
of this doctrine, for he says: &quot;In these oracles the seven
Cosmocratores of the world, ('The World-Pillars,') mentioned likewise
by St. Paul, are double -- one set being commissioned to rule
the superior worlds the spiritual and the sidereal, and the other
to guide and watch over the worlds of matter.&quot; Such is also
the opinion of Jamblichus, who makes an evident distinction between
the archangels and the &quot;Archontes.&quot; (See &quot;De Mysteriis,&quot;
sec. ii., ch. 3.) The above may be applied, of course, to the
distinction made between the degrees or orders of spiritual beings,
and it is in this sense that the Roman Catholic Church tries to
interpret and teach the difference; for while the archangels are
in her teaching divine and holy, their doubles are denounced by
her as devils.* But the word &quot;ferouer&quot; is not to be
understood in this sense, for it means simply the reverse or the
opposite side of some attribute or quality. Thus when the Occultist
says that the &quot;Demon is the lining of God&quot; (evil, the
reverse of the medal), he does not mean two separate

Many are the <EM>Soulless </EM>men among us, for the occurrence
is found to take place in wicked materialists as well as in persons
&quot;who advance in holiness and never turn back.&quot; (See
ibid and also &quot;Isis,&quot; vol. ii., p. 369.)
<P>
* This identity between the Spirit and its material &quot;double&quot;
(in man it is the reverse) explains still better the confusion,
alluded to already in this work, made in the names and individualities,
as well as the numbers, of the Rishis and the Prajapatis; especially
between those of the Satyayuga and the Mahabharatan period. It
also throws additional light on what the Secret Doctrine teaches
with regard to the Root and the Seed Manus (see Book ii. &quot;On
the primitive Manus of humanity&quot;). Not only those progenitors
of our mankind, but every human being, we are taught, has its
prototype in the Spiritual Spheres; which prototype is the highest
essence of his seventh principle. Thus the seven Manus become
14, the Root Manu being the Prime Cause, and the &quot;Seed-Manu&quot;
its effect; and when the latter reach from Satyayuga (the first
stage) to the heroic period, these Manus or Rishis become 21 in
number.<HR>

actualities, but the two aspects or facets of the same Unity.
Now the best man living would appear, side by side with an Archangel
-- as described in Theology -- a fiend. Hence a certain reason
to depreciate a lower &quot;double,&quot; immersed far deeper
in matter than its original. But there is still as little cause
to regard them as devils, and this is precisely what the Roman
Catholics maintain against all reason and logic.
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>)<EM> </EM>The concluding sentence of this sloka shows
how archaic is the belief and the doctrine that man is seven-fold
in his constitution. The thread of being which animates man and
passes through all his personalities, or rebirths on this Earth
(an allusion to Sutratma), the thread on which moreover all his
&quot;Spirits&quot; are strung -- is spun from the essence of
the &quot;threefold,&quot; the &quot;fourfold&quot; and the &quot;fivefold&quot;;
which contain all the preceding. <EM>Panchasikha</EM>,<EM> </EM>agreeably
to Bhagavata Purana (V. XX. 25-28), is one of the seven <EM>Kumaras
</EM>who go to Sveta-Dvipa to worship Vishnu. We shall see further
on, what connection there is between the &quot;celibate&quot;
and chaste sons of Brahma, who refuse &quot;to multiply,&quot;
and terrestrial mortals. Meanwhile it is evident that &quot;the
Man-Plant,&quot; Saptaparna, thus refers to the seven principles,
and man is compared to the seven-leaved plant of this name* so
sacred among Buddhists.
<P>
For further details as to Saptaparna and the importance of the
number seven in occultism, as well as in symbology, the reader
is referred to Part II., Book II., on Symbolism: Sections on &quot;<EM>Saptaparna</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>&quot;The Septenary in the Vedas,&quot; etc. etc.

* The Egyptian allegory in the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; already
mentioned, the hymn that relates to the reward &quot;of the Soul,&quot;
is as suggestive of our Septenary Doctrine as it is poetical.
The deceased is allotted a piece of land in the field of Aanroo,
wherein the Manes, the deified shades of the dead, glean, as the
harvest they have sown by their actions in life, the corn seven
cubits high, which grows in a territory divided into 14 and 7
portions. This corn is the food on which they live and prosper,
or that will kill them, in Amenti, the realm of which the Aanroo
field is a domain. For, as said in the hymn, (see chap. xxxii.
9) the deceased is either destroyed therein, or becomes pure spirit
for the Eternity, in consequence of the &quot;Seven times seventy-seven
lives&quot; passed or to be passed on Earth. The idea of the corn
reaped as the &quot;fruit of our actions&quot; is very graphic.

the fruition of the latter assimilated by the first two after

and are extinguished, are the four lower principles, including
the body.

&quot;I am the three-wicked Flame and my wicks are immortal,&quot;
says the defunct. &quot;I enter into the domain of Sekhem (the
God whose arm sows the seed of action produced by the disembodied
soul) and I enter the region of the Flames who have destroyed
their adversaries,&quot; <EM>i.e.</EM>, got rid of the sin-creating

(<EM>b</EM>) Just as milliards of bright sparks dance on the waters
of an ocean above which one and the same moon is shining, so our
evanescent personalities -- the illusive envelopes of the immortal
MONAD-EGO -- twinkle and dance on the waves of Maya. They last
and appear, as the thousands of sparks produced by the moon-beams,
only so long as the Queen of the Night radiates her lustre on
the running waters of life: the period of a Manvantara; and then
they disappear, the beams -- symbols of our eternal Spiritual
Egos -- alone surviving, re-merged in, and being, as they were
before, one with the Mother-Source.
