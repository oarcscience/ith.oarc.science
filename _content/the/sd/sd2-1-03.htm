<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) This relates to an inclination of the axis -- of
which there were several -- to a consequent deluge and chaos on
Earth (having, however, no reference to primeval chaos), in which
monsters, half-human, half-animal, were generated. We find it
mentioned in the &quot;Book of the Dead,&quot; and also in the
Chaldean account of creation, on the Cutha Tablets, however mutilated.

same division. In the<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Physician</EM>'<EM>s

came into being <EM>three ages </EM>(Triyugam) before the gods&quot;
on our Earth (See &quot;Chronology of the Brahmins&quot; at the
end of this Stanza).<HR>

<P>
It is not even allegory. Here we have <EM>facts, </EM>that are
found repeated in the account of <EM>Pymander, </EM>as well as
in the Chaldean tablets of creation. The verses may almost be
checked by the Cosmogony, as given by Berosus, which has been
disfigured out of recognition by Eusebius, but some of the features
of which may yet be found in fragments left by ancient Greek authors
-- Apollodorus, Alexander Polyhistor, etc., etc. &quot;The water-men
terrible and bad,&quot; who were the production of physical nature
alone, a result of the &quot;evolutionary impulse&quot; and the
first attempt to create <EM>man</EM> the &quot;crown,&quot; and
the aim and goal of all animal life on Earth -- are shown to be
failures in our Stanzas. Do we not find the same in the Berosian
Cosmogony, denounced with such vehemence as the culmination of
heathen absurdity? And yet who of the Evolutionists can say that
things in the beginning have not come to pass as they are described?
That, as maintained in the Puranas, the Egyptian and Chaldean
fragments, and even in Genesis, there have not been two, and even
more, &quot;creations&quot; before the last formation of the Globe;
which, changing its geological and atmospheric conditions, changed
also its flora, its fauna, and its men? This claim agrees not
only with every ancient Cosmogony, but also with modern science,
and even, to a certain degree, with the theory of evolution, as
may be demonstrated in a few words.
<P>
There is no &quot;dark creation,&quot; no &quot;Evil Dragon&quot;
conquered by a Sun-God, in the earliest World-Cosmogonies. Even
with the Akkads, the great Deep (the Watery Abyss, or <STRONG>S</STRONG>PACE)
was the birthplace and abode of Ea, Wisdom, the incognizable infinite
Deity. But with the Semites and the later Chaldeans, the fathomless
Deep of Wisdom becomes gross matter, sinful Substance, and Ea
is changed into Tiamat, the dragon slain by Merodach, or Satan,
in the astral waves.
<P>
In the Hindu Puranas, Brahma, the creator, is seen recommencing
<EM>de</EM> <EM>novo </EM>several creations after as many failures;
and two great creations are mentioned,* the Padma and the Varaha,
the present, when the Earth was lifted out of the water by Brahma,
in the shape of a boar, or &quot;Varaha Avatar.&quot; Creation
is shown as a sport, an amusement (Lila) of the creative god.
The Zohar speaks of primordial worlds, which perished as soon
as they came into existence. And the same is said in Midraish,
Rabbi Abahu explaining distinctly (in Bereschith Rabba, Parscha
<STRONG>IX</STRONG>.) that &quot;the Holy One&quot; had successively
created and de-
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* These two must not be confused with the seven creations or divisions
in each Kalpa (See Book I. &quot;<EM>The Seven Creations</EM>&quot;)<EM>.
</EM>The <EM>primary</EM> and <EM>secondary </EM>creations are
here meant. <HR>

stroyed sundry worlds, before he succeeded in the present one.
This does not relate only to other worlds in space, but to a mystery
of our own globe contained in the allegory about the &quot;kings
of Edom.&quot; For the words, &quot;This one pleases me,&quot;
are repeated in Genesis i. 31, though in disfigured terms, as
usual. The Chaldean fragments of Cosmogony on the Cuneiform inscriptions,
and elsewhere, show two distinct creations of animals and men,
the first being destroyed, as it was a failure. The Cosmogonical
tablets prove that this our actual creation was preceded by others
(See &quot;Hibbert Lectures,&quot; p. 390); and as shown by the
author of &quot;The Qabbalah,&quot; in the Zohar, Siphrah Dzeniouta,
in Jovah Rabbah, 128<I>a</I>, etc., etc. The Kabala states the
same.
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>) Oannes (or Dagon, the Chaldean &quot;Man-fish&quot;)
divides his Cosmogony and Genesis into two portions. First the
abyss of waters and darkness, wherein resided most hideous beings
--
<P>
-men with wings, four and two-faced men, human beings with two
heads, with the legs and horns of a goat (our &quot;goat-men,&quot;)*
hippocentaurs, bulls with the heads of men, and dogs with tails
of fishes. In short, combinations of various animals and men,
of fishes, reptiles and other monstrous animals assuming each
other's shapes and countenances. The feminine element they resided
in, is personified by Thalatth -- the Sea, or &quot;Water&quot;
-- which was finally conquered by Belus, the male principle. And
Polyhistor says: &quot;Belus came and cut the woman asunder, and
of one half of her he formed the Earth, and of the other half
the heavens, and at the same time he destroyed the animals within
her.&quot; As pertinently remarked by I. Myer, &quot;with the
Akkadians each object and power of Nature had its Zi, Spirit.
The Akkadians formed their deities into triads, usually males
(sexless, rather?); the Semites also had triadic deities, but
introduced sex&quot; (p. 246) -- or phallicism. With the Aryans
and the earliest Akkadians all things are emanations <EM>through,</EM>
not<EM> by, </EM>a creator or logos. With the Semites everything
is <EM>begotten.</EM>

* Whence the identity of the ideas? The Chinese have the same
traditions. According to the commentator Kwoh P'oh, in the work
called <EM>Shan-Hai-King, </EM>&quot;Wonders by Sea and Land,&quot;
a work which was written by the historiographer Chung Ku from
engravings on nine urns made by the Emperor Yu, (B.C. 2255), an
interview is mentioned with men <EM>having two distinct faces
on their heads, </EM>before and behind, monsters with bodies of
goats and human faces, etc. Gould, in his &quot;<EM>Mythical Monsters,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>p. 27, giving the names of some authors on Natural History,
mentions <EM>Shan-Hai-King. Ac</EM>cording to Kwoh P'oh (A.D.
276-324) this work was compiled three thousand years before his
time, or at seven dynasties distance. Yang Sun of the Ming Dynasty
(commencing A.D. 1368) states that it was compiled by Kung Chia
and Chung Ku (as stated above). Chung Ku at the time of the last
emperor of the Hia dynasty, B.C. 1818, fearing that the emperor
might destroy the books treating of the ancient time, carried
them in his flight to Yin. (See &quot;<EM>Mythical Monsters,</EM>&quot;<EM>

(<I>a</I>).
<P>
(<I>a</I>) The explanations given in our Stanzas are far more
clear than that which the legend of creation from the <EM>Cutha
</EM>tablet would give, even were it complete. What is preserved
on it, however, corroborates them. For, in the tablet, &quot;the
Lord of Angels&quot; destroys the men in the abyss, when &quot;there
were not left the carcases and waste&quot; after they were slaughtered.
After which they, the Great Gods, create men with the bodies of
birds of the desert, human beings, &quot;seven kings, brothers
of the same family,&quot; etc., which is a reference to the locomotive
qualities of the primary ethereal bodies of men, which could fly
as well as they could walk,** but who &quot;were destroyed&quot;
because they were not &quot;<EM>perfect,</EM>&quot;<EM> i.e.</EM>,
they &quot;were sexless, like the Kings of Edom.&quot;
<P>
Weeded of metaphors and allegories, what will science say to this
idea of a primordial creation of species? It will object to the
&quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Spirits&quot; having anything to
do therewith: but if it is nature and the physical law of evolution
that are the creators of all there is now on Earth, why could
there be &quot;no such abyss&quot; when the globe was covered
with waters, in which numbers of monstrous beings were generated?
Is it the &quot;human beings&quot; and animals with human heads
and double faces, which are a point of the objection? But if man
is only a higher animal and has evolved from the brute species
by an infinite series of transformations, why could not the &quot;missing
links&quot; have had human heads attached to the bodies of animals,
or, being two-headed, have heads of beasts and <EM>vice versa,
</EM>in Nature's early efforts? Are we not shown during the geological
periods, in the ages of the reptiles and the mammalia, lizards
with birds' wings, and serpents' heads on animal bodies.*** And,
arguing from the standpoint of science, does not even our modern
human race occasionally furnish us with monster-specimens: two-headed
children, animal bodies with human heads, dog-headed babies, etc.,
etc.? And this proves that, if nature will still play such

freaks now that she has settled for ages into the order of her
evolutionary work, monsters, like those described by Berosus,
were a possibility in her opening programme; which possibility
may even have existed once upon a time as a law, before she sorted
out her species and began regular work upon them; which indeed
now admits of definite proof by the bare fact of &quot;<STRONG>R</STRONG>EVERSION,&quot;
as science puts it.
<P>
This is what the doctrine teaches and demonstrates by numerous
proofs. But we shall not wait for the approval of either dogmatic
theology or materialistic science, but proceed with the Stanzas.
Let these speak for themselves, with the help of the light thrown
by the Commentaries and their explanations; the scientific aspect
of these questions will be considered later on.
<P>
Thus physical nature, when left to herself in the creation of
animal and man, is shown to have failed. She can produce the first
two and the lower animal kingdoms, but when it comes to the turn
of man, spiritual, independent and intelligent powers are required
for his creation, besides the &quot;coats of skin&quot; and the
&quot;Breath of animal Life.&quot; The human Monads of preceding
Rounds need something higher than purely physical materials to
build their personalities with, under the penalty of remaining
even below any &quot;Frankenstein&quot; animal.*

* In the first volume of the lately published &quot;<EM>Introduction
a l</EM>'<EM>atude des Races Humaines,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>by
M. de Quatrefages, there is proof that since the post-tertiary
period and even before that time -- since many Races were already
scattered during that age on the face of the Earth -- man has
not altered one iota in his physical structure. And if, surrounded
for ages by a fauna that altered from one period or cycle to another,
which died out, which was reborn in other forms -- so that now
there does not exist one single animal on Earth, large or small,
contemporary with the man of that period -- if, then, every animal
has been transformed save man himself, this fact goes to prove
not only his antiquity, but that he is a <EM>distinct Kingdom.
</EM>Why should he alone have escaped transformation? Because,
says de Quatrefages, the weapon used by him, in his struggle with
nature and the ever-changing geological conditions and elements,
was &quot;his <EM>psychic force,</EM> <EM>not his physical strength
or body</EM>,&quot; as in the case of animals. Give man only that
dose of intelligence and reason with which other mammalia are
endowed, and with his present bodily organization he will show
himself the most helpless of creatures of Earth. And as everything
goes to prove that the <I>human </I><EM>organism with all its
characteristics, peculiarities and idiosyncrasies existed already
on our Globe in those far distant geological periods when there
was not yet one single specimen of the now-existing forms of mammalia</EM>,
what is the unavoidable conclusion? Why this: Since all the human
races are of one and the same species, it follows that this species
is the <EM>most ancient of all </EM>the now-living mammalia. Therefore
it is the most stable and persevering of all, and was already
as fully developed as it is now when all the other mammalia now
known had not made even their first approach to appearance on
this Earth. Such is the opinion of the great French Naturalist,
who gives thereby a terrible blow to Darwinism. <HR>

Lha </EM>(<EM>Spirits</EM>)<EM>, possessed of a dual body </EM>(an

creators of our body of illusion</EM>.&quot; . . . .

&quot;<EM>Into the forms projected by the Lha </EM>(Pitris)<EM>

<EM>descend from the spheres of expectation.*** But they are like

. .
<P>
&quot;<EM>Man needs four flames and three fires to become one
on Earth, and he requires the essence of the forty-nine fires****
to be perfect. It is those who have deserted the Superior Spheres,
the Gods of Will,***** who complete the Manu of illusion. For
the </EM>'<EM>Double Dragon</EM>'<EM> has no hold upon the mere
form. It is like the breeze where there is no tree or branch to
receive and harbour it. It cannot affect the form where there
is no agent of transmission </EM>(Manas, &quot;Mind&quot;) <EM>and
the form knows it not.</EM>&quot;
<P>
&quot;<EM>In the highest worlds, the three are one,****** on Earth
</EM>(<EM>at first</EM>)<EM> the one becomes two. They are like
the two </EM>(<EM>side</EM>)<EM> lines of a triangle that has
lost its bottom line -- which is the third fire.</EM>&quot;<EM>

whose esoteric interpretations may differ from our own -- we shall
have to explain to them the foregoing by certain passages in their
own exoteric books, namely, the Puranas. In the allegories of
the latter, Brahma, who is collectively the creative Force of
the Universe, is said to be &quot;at the beginning of the Yugas
(cycles) . . . . <EM>Possessed of the desire and of the power
to create, and, impelled by the potencies of what is to be created,
</EM>again and again does he, at the outset of a Kalpa, put forth
a similar creation,&quot; (see <EM>Vishnu Purana, </EM>Book I.
ch. V., closing Sloka. Also &quot;<EM>Manava Dharma Shastra</EM>&quot;
I. 30.) It is now proposed to examine the exoteric account in
the Vishnu Purana, and see how much it may agree or disagree with
our occult version.

<STRONG>C</STRONG>REATION OF <STRONG>D</STRONG>IVINE <STRONG>B</STRONG>EINGS
IN THE <STRONG>E</STRONG>XOTERIC <STRONG>A</STRONG>CCOUNTS.
<P>
In the <EM>Vishnu Purana </EM>-- which is certainly the earliest
of all the scriptures of that name -- we find, as in all the others,
Brahma assuming as the male God, for purposes of creation, &quot;<EM>four
bodies invested by three qualities.</EM>&quot;<EM>* </EM>It is
said: &quot;In this manner, Maitreya, <EM>Jyotsna </EM>(dawn),
<EM>Ratri </EM>(night)<EM>, Ahan </EM>(day), and <EM>Sandhya </EM>(evening
twilight) are the four bodies of Brahma&quot; . . (p. 81, Vol.
I., Wilson's translation). As Parasara explains it, when Brahma
wants to create the world anew and construct progeny <EM>through
his will</EM>, in the fourfold condition (or the four orders of
beings) termed gods (Dhyan Chohans), Demons** (<EM>i.e.</EM>,
more material Devas), Progenitors (Pitris) and men, &quot;he collects
Yoga-like (Yuyuje) his mind.&quot;
<P>
Strange to say, he begins by creating DEMONS, who thus take precedence
over the angels or gods. This is no incongruity, nor is it due
to inconsistency, but has, like all the rest, a profound esoteric
meaning, quite clear to one free from Christian theological prejudice.
He who bears in mind that the principle <STRONG>M</STRONG>AHAT,
or Intellect, the &quot;Universal Mind&quot; (literally &quot;the
great&quot;), which esoteric philosophy explains as the &quot;manifested
Omniscience&quot; -- the &quot;first product&quot; of Pradhana
(primordial matter) as Vishnu Purana says, but the first Cosmic
aspect of Parabrahm or the esoteric SAT, the Universal Soul,***
as Occultism
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* This has in <EM>esotericism </EM>a direct bearing upon the seven
principles of the manifested Brahma, or universe, in the same
order as in man. Exoterically, it is only four principles.
<P>
** <EM>Demons </EM>is a very loose word to use, as it applies
to a great number of inferior -- <EM>i.e., </EM>more material
-- Spirits, or minor Gods, who are so termed because they &quot;war&quot;
with the higher ones; but they are no devils.
<P>
*** The same order of principles in man: -- <EM>Atma</EM> (Spirit)<EM>,
Buddhi </EM>(Soul), its vehicle, as Matter is the <EM>Vahan </EM>of
Spirit, and <EM>Manas </EM>(mind), the third, or the fifth microcosmically.
On the <EM>plane of personality, Manas </EM>is the first.<HR>

teaches -- is at the root of <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF-Consciousness,
will understand the reason why. The so-called &quot;Demons&quot;
-- who are (esoterically) the Self-asserting and (intellectually)
active Principle -- are the <EM>positive poles of creation, </EM>so
to say; hence, the first produced. This is in brief the process
as narrated allegorically in the Puranas.
<P>
&quot;Having concentrated his mind into itself and the quality
of darkness pervading Brahma's assumed body, the Asuras, issuing
from his thigh, were first produced; after which, abandoning this
body, it was transformed into NIGHT.&quot; (See Part <B>II.</B>,
&#167;<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>The Fallen Angels.</EM>&quot;)
<P>
Two important points are involved herein: -- (<EM>a</EM>) Primarily
in the <EM>Rig-Veda, </EM>the &quot;Asuras&quot; are shown as
<EM>spiritual divine beings; </EM>their etymology is derived from
<EM>asu </EM>(breath), the &quot;Breath of God,&quot; and they
mean the same as the Supreme Spirit or the Zoroastrian <EM>Ahura.
</EM>It is later on, for purposes of theology and dogma, that
they are shown issuing from Brahma's thigh, and that their name
began to be derived from a privative, and <EM>sura, </EM>god (solar
deities), or <EM>not-a-god, </EM>and that they became the enemies
of the gods. Every ancient theogony without exception -- from
the Aryan and the Egyptian down to that of Hesiod -- places, in
the order of Cosmogonical evolution, Night before the Day; even<EM>
Genesis, </EM>where &quot;darkness is upon the face of the deep&quot;
before &quot;the <EM>first day.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>The reason
for this is that every Cosmogony -- except in the Secret Doctrine
-- begins by the &quot;Secondary Creation&quot; so-called: to
wit, the <EM>manifested </EM>Universe, the Genesis of which has
to open by a marked differentiation between the eternal Light
of <EM>Primary </EM>Creation, whose mystery must remain for ever
&quot;Darkness&quot; to the prying finite conception and intellect
of the profane, and the Secondary Evolution of manifested visible
nature. The Veda contains the whole philosophy of that division
without having ever been correctly explained by our Orientalists,
because it has <EM>never been understood </EM>by them.
<P>
Continuing to create, Brahma assumes another form, that of the
Day, and creates from his breath the gods, who are endowed with
the quality of goodness (passivity)*. In his next body the quality
of great passivity prevailed, which is also (negative) goodness,
and from the side of that personage issued the Pitris, the progenitors
of men, because, as the text explains, &quot;Brahma thought of
himself (during the process) as the father of the world.&quot;**
This is <EM>Kriya-sakti -- </EM>the mysterious <EM>Yoga</EM> power
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Thus, says the Commentary, the saying &quot;by day the gods
are most powerful, and by night the demons,&quot; is purely allegorical.
<P>
** This <EM>thinking of oneself </EM>as this, that, or the other,
is the chief factor in the production of every kind of psychic
or even physical phenomena. The words &quot;whosoever shall say
to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea, and <EM>shall
not doubt </EM>. . . . that thing will come to pass,&quot; are
no vain words. Only the word &quot;faith&quot; ought to be translated
by WILL. Faith without Will is like a wind-mill without <EM>wind</EM>
-- barren of results.<HR>

<P>
explained elsewhere. This body of Brahma when cast off became
the <EM>Sandhya </EM>(evening twilight), the interval between
day and night.
<P>
Finally Brahma assumed his last form pervaded by the <EM>quality
of foulness, </EM>&quot;and from this MEN, in whom foulness and

off became the dawn, or morning twilight -- the twilight of Humanity.
Here Brahma stands esoterically for the <EM>Pitris. </EM>He is
collectively the Pitar, &quot;father.&quot;
<P>
The true esoteric meaning of this allegory must now be explained.
Brahma here symbolizes personally the collective creators of the
World and Men -- the universe with all its numberless productions
of things movable and (seemingly) immovable.* He is collectively
the Prajapatis, the Lords of Being; and the four bodies typify
the four classes of creative powers or Dhyan Chohans, described
in the Commentary directly following Stanza <B>VII</B>. in Book
I. The whole philosophy of the so-called &quot;Creation&quot;
of the good and evil in this world and of the whole cycle of Manvantaric
results therefrom, hangs on the correct comprehension of these
Four bodies of Brahma.
<P>
The reader will now be prepared to understand the real, the esoteric
significance of what follows. Moreover there is an important point
to be cleared up. Christian theology having arbitrarily settled
and agreed that Satan with his Fallen Angels belonged to the earliest
creation, Satan being the first-created, the wisest and most beautiful
of God's Archangels, the word was given, the key-note struck.
Henceforth all the <EM>pagan </EM>scriptures were made to yield
the same meaning, and all were shown to be demoniacal, and it
<EM>was </EM>and<EM> is </EM>claimed that <EM>truth and fact </EM>belong
to, and commence only with, Christianity. Even the Orientalists
and Mythologists, some of them no Christians at all but &quot;infidels,&quot;
or men of science, entered unconsciously to themselves, and by
the mere force of association of ideas and habit, into the theological
groove. Purely Brahmanical considerations, based on greed of power
and ambition, allowed the masses to remain in ignorance of great
truths; and the same causes led the Initiates among the early
Christians to remain silent, while those who had never known the
truth disfigured the order of things, judging of the hierarchy
of &quot;Angels&quot; by their exoteric form. Thus as the <EM>Asuras
</EM>had become the rebellious inferior gods fighting the higher
ones in popular creeds, so the highest archangel, in truth the
Agathodaemon, the eldest benevolent Logos, became with theology
the &quot;Adversary&quot; or <EM>Satan. </EM>But is this warranted
by the correct interpretation of any old Scripture? The answer
is, <EM>most certainly not. </EM>As the Mazdean Scriptures of
the

* The same idea is found in the first four chapters of <EM>Genesis,
</EM>with their &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;God,&quot; which are

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 61 WHAT THE GNOSTICS SAY.</H6>

<P>
<EM>Zend-Avesta, </EM>the<EM> Vendidad </EM>and others correct
and expose the later cunning shuffling of the gods in the Hindu
Pantheon, and restore through <STRONG>A</STRONG>HURA the <EM>Asuras
</EM>to their legitimate place in theogony, so the recent discoveries
of the Chaldean tablets vindicate the good name of the first divine
Emanations. This is easily proved. Christian Angelology is directly
and solely derived from that of the Pharisees, who brought their
tenets from Babylonia. The Sadducees, the real guardians of the
Laws of Moses, knew not of, and rejected, any angels, opposing
even the immortality of the human <EM>Soul </EM>(not impersonal
Spirit). In the Bible the only &quot;Angels&quot; spoken of are
the &quot;Sons of God&quot; mentioned in Genesis vi. (who are
now regarded as the <EM>Nephilim, </EM>the<EM> </EM>Fallen Angels),
and several angels in human form, the &quot;Messengers&quot; of
the Jewish God, whose own rank needs a closer analysis than heretofore
given. (<EM>Vide Supra, </EM>Stanza I., sub-sections 2, <EM>3,
et seq., </EM>where it is shown that the early Akkadians called
<I>Ea</I>, Wisdom, that which was disfigured by the later Chaldees
and Semites into <EM>Tismat, </EM>Tisalat and the Thallath of
Berosus, the female Sea Dragon, now Satan.) Truly -- &quot;How
art thou fallen (by the hand of man), O bright star and son of
the morning&quot;!
<P>
Now what do the Babylonian accounts of &quot;Creation,&quot; as
found on the Assyrian fragments of tiles, tell us; those very
accounts upon which the Pharisees built their angelology? But
compare Mr. G. Smith's &quot;<EM>Assyrian Discoveries,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>p. 398, and his &quot;<EM>Chaldean Account of Genesis,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>p. 107. The &quot;<EM>Tablet with the story of the Seven
Wicked Gods or Spirits,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>has the following
account -- we print the important passages in italics: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. In the <EM>first days </EM>the evil Gods,<BR>
2. the<EM> angels, who were in rebellion, </EM>who<EM> in the
lower part of heaven</EM> <BR>
3<EM>. had been created,</EM> <BR>
4. they caused their evil work<BR>
5. devising with wicked heads . . . . etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Thus we are shown, as plainly as can be, on a fragment which remained
unbroken, so that there can be no dubious reading, that the &quot;rebellious
angels&quot; had been created in the <EM>lower part of heaven,
i.e., </EM>that they belonged and do belong to a <EM>material
plane of evolution, </EM>although as it is not the plane of which
we are made cognizant through our senses, it remains generally
invisible to us, and is thus regarded as subjective. Were the
Gnostics so wrong, after this, in affirming that this our visible
world, and especially the Earth, had been created by <EM>lower
</EM>angels, the inferior Elohim, of which, as they taught, the
God of Israel was one. These Gnostics were nearer in time to the
records of the Archaic Secret Doctrine, and therefore ought to
be allowed to have known better than non-initiated Christians,
who took upon themselves, hundreds of years<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 62 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
later, to remodel and <EM>correct </EM>what was said. But let
us see what the same Tablet says further on: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
7. There were seven of them (the wicked gods) . . . . (then follows
the description of these, the fourth being a &quot;serpent,&quot;
the phallic symbol of the <EM>fourth </EM>Race in human Evolution).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
15. The seven of them, messengers of the God Anu, their king.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Now Anu belongs to the Chaldean trinity, and is identical with
Sin, the &quot;Moon,&quot; in one aspect. And the Moon in the
Hebrew Kabala is the Argha of the seed of all material life, and
is still more closely connected, kabalistically, with Jehovah,
who is double-sexed as Anu is. They are both represented in Esotericism
and viewed from a dual aspect: male or spiritual, female or material,
or Spirit and Matter, the two antagonistic principles. Hence the
&quot;Messengers of Anu,&quot; (who is Sin, the &quot;Moon,&quot;)
are shown, in verses 28 to 41, as being finally overpowered by
the same Sin with the help of Bel (the Sun) and Ishtar (Venus).
This is regarded as a contradiction by the Assyriologists, but
is simply <EM>metaphysics </EM>in the esoteric teaching.
<P>
There is more than one interpretation, for there are seven keys
to the mystery of the Fall. Moreover there are two &quot;Falls&quot;
in Theology: the rebellion of the Archangels and their &quot;Fall,&quot;
and the &quot;Fall&quot; of Adam and Eve. Thus the lower as well
as the higher Hierarchies are charged with a supposed crime. The
word &quot;supposed&quot; is the true and correct term, for in
both cases it is founded on misconception. Both are considered
in Occultism as Karmic effects, and both belong to the law of
Evolution: intellectual and spiritual on the one hand, physical
and psychic on the other. The &quot;Fall&quot; is a universal
allegory. It sets forth at one end of the ladder of Evolution
the &quot;rebellion,&quot; <EM>i.e., </EM>the action of differentiating
intellection or consciousness on its various planes, seeking union
with matter; and at the other, the lower end, the rebellion of
matter against Spirit, or of action against spiritual inertia.
And here lies the germ of an error which has had such disastrous
effects on the intelligence of civilized societies for over 1,800
years. In the original allegory it is matter -- hence the more
material angels -- which was regarded as the conqueror of Spirit,
or the Archangels who &quot;fell&quot; on this plane. &quot;They
of the <EM>flaming sword </EM>(or animal passions) had put to
flight the Spirits of Darkness.&quot; Yet it is the latter who
fought for the supremacy of the conscious and divine spirituality
on Earth and failed, succumbing to the power of matter. But in
theological dogma we see the reverse. It is Michael, &quot;who
is like unto God,&quot; the representative of Jehovah, who is
the leader of the celestial hosts -- as Lucifer, in Milton's fancy,
is of the infernal hosts -- who has the best of Satan. It is true
that the nature of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 63 WHO ARE THE &quot;FLAMES&quot;?</H6>

<P>
Michael depends upon that of his Creator and Master. Who the latter
is, one may find out by carefully studying the allegory of the
&quot;War in Heaven&quot; with the astronomical key. As shown
by Bentley, the &quot;War of the Titans against the gods&quot;
in Hesiod, and also the war of the Asuras (or the Tarakamaya)
against the devas in Puranic legend, are identical in all save
the names. The aspects of the stars show (Bentley taking the year
945 <B>B.C</B>. as the nearest date for such conjunction) that
&quot;all the planets, except Saturn, were on the same side of
the heavens as the Sun and Moon,&quot; and hence were his opponents.
And yet it is Saturn, or the Jewish &quot;Moon-god,&quot; who
is shown as prevailing, both by Hesiod and Moses, neither of whom
was understood. Thus it was that the real meaning became distorted.

of the highest Spheres -- whence the name of the capital of Tibet,

<P>
Besides a statement of a purely physical nature and belonging
to the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 64 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
evolution of life on Earth, there may be another allegorical meaning
attached to this Sloka, or indeed, as is taught, several. The
FLAMES, or &quot;Fires,&quot; represent Spirit, or the male element,
and &quot;Water,&quot; matter, or the opposite element. And here
again we find, in the action of the Spirit slaying the purely
material form, a reference to the eternal struggle, on the physical
and psychic planes, between Spirit and Matter, besides a scientific
cosmic fact. For, as said in the next verse: --
<P>
-------
<P>
9. <STRONG>M</STRONG>OTHER-WATER, THE GREAT SEA WEPT. <STRONG>S</STRONG>HE
AROSE, SHE DISAPPEARED IN THE <STRONG>M</STRONG>OON, WHICH HAD
LIFTED HER, WHICH HAD GIVEN HER BIRTH (<EM>a</EM>).
<P>
(<EM>a</EM>)<EM> </EM>Now what can this mean? Is it not an evident
reference to tidal action in the early stage of the history of
our planet in its fourth Round? Modern research has been busy
of late in its speculations on the Palaeozoic high-tides. Mr.
Darwin's theory was that not less than 52,000,000 years ago --
and probably much more -- the Moon originated from the Earth's
plastic mass. Starting from the point where research was left
by Helmholtz, Ferrel, Sir William Thomson and others, he retraced
the course of tidal retardation of the earth's rotary motions
far back into the very night of time, and placed the Moon during
the infancy of our planet at only &quot;a fraction of its present
distance.&quot; In short, his theory was that it is the Moon which
separated from the Earth. The tidal elevation concurring with
the swing of the globular mass -- centrifugal tendency being then
nearly equal to gravity -- the latter was overcome, and the tidally
elevated mass could thus separate completely from the Earth.*
<P>
The Occult teaching is the reverse of this. The Moon is far older
than the Earth; and, as explained in Book I., it is the latter
which owes its being to the former, however astronomy and geology
may explain the fact. Hence, the tides and the attraction to the
Moon, as shown by the liquid portion of the Globe ever striving
to raise itself towards its parent. This is the meaning of the
sentence that &quot;the Mother-Water arose and disappeared in
the Moon, which had lifted her, which had given her birth.&quot;
<P>

<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* But see the difficulties suggested later, in the works of various
geologists, against this theory. Compare Sir R. S. Bull's article
in &quot;<EM>Nature</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(Dec. 1, 1881), and also
what the American geologists say.<HR>

<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) The time for its incrustation had arrived. The waters
had separated and the process was started. It was the beginning
of a new life. This is what one key divulges to us. Another key
teaches the origin of Water, its admixture with Fire (liquid fire
it calls it),*** and enters upon an alchemical description of
the progeny of the two -- solid matter such as minerals and earths.
From the &quot;Waters of Space,&quot; the progeny of the male
Spirit-Fire and the female (gaseous) Water has become the Oceanic
expanse on Earth. Varuna is dragged down from the infinite Space,
to reign as Neptune over the finite Seas. As always, the popular
fancy is found to be based on a strictly scientific foundation.
<P>
Water is the symbol of the female element everywhere; <I>mater</I>,
from which the letter M, is derived pictorially from [[diagram]]
a water hieroglyph. It is the universal matrix or the &quot;Great
Deep.&quot; Venus, the great Mother-Virgin, issues forth from
the Sea-wave, and Cupid or <EM>Eros is </EM>her son. But Venus
is the later mythological variant of <EM>Gaia </EM>(or<EM> Gaea</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>the Earth, which, in its higher aspect is Nature (<EM>Prakriti</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>and metaphysically Aditi, and even Mulaprakriti, the root
of Prakriti or its noumenon.
<P>
Hence Cupid or Love in his primitive sense is Eros, the Divine
Will, or <EM>Desire of manifesting itself through visible creation.
</EM>Thence Fohat, the prototype of Eros, becomes on Earth the
great power &quot;Life-electricity,&quot; or the Spirit of &quot;Life-giving.&quot;
Let us remember the Greek Theogony and enter into the spirit of
its philosophy. We are taught by the Greeks (See &quot;<EM>Iliad</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>IV., 201, 246) that all things, gods included, owe their
being to the Ocean and his wife Tethys, the latter being Gaea,
the Earth or Nature. But who is <EM>Ocean? </EM>Ocean is the immeasurable
SPACE (Spirit in Chaos), which is the Deity (<EM>see </EM>Book
I.); and Tethys is not the Earth, but primordial matter in the
process of formation. In our case it is no longer Aditi-Gaea who
begets <EM>Ouranos </EM>or Varuna, the chief Aditya among the
seven planetary gods, but Prakriti, materialised and localised.
The Moon, masculine in its theogonic character, is,

bodies), and Kimnaras (men with the heads of horses) created by
Brahma in the commencement of the Kalpa.

in its cosmic aspect only, the female generative principle, as
the Sun is the male emblem thereof. Water is the progeny of the
Moon, an androgyne deity with every nation.

Evolution proceeds on the laws of analogy in Kosmos as in the
formation of the smallest globe. Thus the above, applying to the
<EM>modus operandi </EM>at the time when the Universe was appearing,
applies also in the case of our Earth's formation.
<P>
This Stanza opens by speaking of thirty crores, 30,000,000, of
years. We may be asked -- What could the ancients know of the
duration of geological periods, when no modern scientist or mathematician
is able to calculate their duration with anything like approximate
accuracy? Whether they had or had not better means (and it is
maintained that they had them in their Zodiacs), still the chronology
of the ancient Brahmins shall now be given as faithfully as possible.
<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="chronology">T</A></STRONG>HE <STRONG>C</STRONG>HRONOLOGY
OF THE <STRONG>B</STRONG>RAHMINS.
<P>
No greater riddle exists in science, no problem is more hopelessly
insoluble, than the question: How old -- even approximately --
are the Sun and Moon, the Earth and Man? What does modern science
know of the duration of the ages of the World, or even of the
length of geological periods?
<P>
Nothing; <EM>absolutely nothing.</EM> 
<P>
If one turns to science for chronological information, one is
told by those who are straightforward and truthful, as for instance
Mr. Pengelly, the eminent geologist, &quot;We do not know.&quot;*
One will learn that, so far, no trustworthy numerical estimate
of the ages of the world and man could be made, and that both
geology and anthropology are at sea. Yet when a student of esoteric
philosophy presumes to bring forward the teachings of Occult Science,
he is at once sat upon. Why should this be so, since, when reduced
to their own physical methods, the greatest scientists have failed
to arrive even at an approximate agreement?
<P>
It is true that science can hardly be blamed for it. Indeed, in
the Cimmerian darkness of the prehistoric ages, the explorers
are lost in a labyrinth, whose great corridors are doorless, allowing
no visible exit into the Archaic past. Lost in the maze of their
own conflicting speculations, rejecting, as they have always done,
the evidence of Eastern tradition, without any clue, or one single
certain milestone to guide them, what can geologists or anthropologists
do but pick up the slender

<P>
thread of Ariadne where they first perceive it, and then proceed
at perfect random? Therefore we are first told that the farthest
date to which documentary record extends is now generally regarded
by Anthropology as but &quot;the earliest distinctly visible point
of the pre-historic period<EM>.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Encyclopaedia
Britannica.</EM>)
<P>
At the same time it is confessed that &quot;beyond that period
stretches back a vast indefinite series of prehistoric ages.&quot;
(<EM>Ibid.</EM>)
<P>
It is with those specified &quot;Ages&quot; that we shall begin.
They are &quot;prehistoric&quot; to the naked eye of matter only.
To the spiritual eagle eye of the seer and the prophet of every
race, Ariadne's thread stretches beyond that &quot;historic period&quot;
without break or flaw, surely and steadily, into the very night
of time; and the hand which holds it is too mighty to drop it,
or even let it break. Records exist, although they may be rejected
as fanciful by the profane; though many of them are tacitly accepted
by philosophers and men of great learning, and meet with an unvarying
refusal only from the official and collective body of <EM>orthodox
</EM>science. And since the latter refuses to give us even an
approximate idea of the duration of the geological ages -- save
in a few conflicting and contradictory hypotheses -- let us see
what Aryan philosophy can teach us.
<P>
Such computations as are given in Manu and the Puranas -- save
trifling and most evidently <EM>intentional </EM>exaggerations
-- are, as already stated, almost identical with those taught
in esoteric philosophy. This may be seen by comparing the two
in any Hindu calendar of recognised orthodoxy.
<P>
The best and most complete of all such calendars, at present,
as vouched for by the learned Brahmins of Southern India, is the
already mentioned Tamil calendar called the &quot;Tirukkanda Panchanga,&quot;
compiled, as we are told, from, and in full accordance with, secret
fragments of Asuramaya's data. As Asuramaya is said to have been
the greatest astronomer, so he is whispered to have also been
the most powerful &quot;Sorcerer&quot; of the &quot;<STRONG>W</STRONG>HITE<STRONG>
I</STRONG>SLAND, which had become <STRONG>B</STRONG>LACK with
sin,&quot; <EM>i.e., </EM>of the islands of Atlantis.
<P>
The &quot;White Island&quot; is a symbolical name. Asuramaya is
said to have lived (see the tradition of Jhana-bhaskara) in <EM>Romaka-pura
</EM>in the West: because the name is an allusion to the land
and cradle of the &quot;Sweat-born&quot; of the Third Race. That
land or continent had disappeared ages before Asuramaya lived,
since he was an Atlantean; but he was a direct descendant of the
<EM>Wise Race, the Race that never dies. </EM>Many are the legends
concerning this hero, the pupil of Surya (the Sun-God) himself,
as the Indian accounts allege. It matters little whether he lived
on one or another island, but the question is to prove that he
was no myth, as Dr. Weber and others would make him. The<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 68 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
fact of &quot;<EM>Romaka-pura </EM>in the West&quot; being named
as the birth-place of this hero of the archaic ages, is the more
interesting because it is so very suggestive of the esoteric teaching
about the &quot;Sweat-born&quot; Races, the men born from the
<EM>pores of their parents. </EM>&quot;<STRONG>R</STRONG>OMAKUPAS&quot;
means &quot;hair-pores&quot; in Sanskrit. In <EM>Mahabharata XII.
</EM>10,308, a people named Raumyas are said to have been created
from the pores of Virabhadara, the terrible giant, who destroyed
Daksha's sacrifice. Other tribes and people are also represented
as born in this way. All these are references to the later Second
and the earlier Third Root Races.
<P>
The following figures are from the calendar just referred to;
a footnote marks the points of disagreement with the figures of
the Arya Samaj school: --

<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The esoteric doctrine says that this &quot;cosmic evolution&quot;
refers only to our solar system; while exoteric Hinduism makes
the figures refer, if we do not mistake, to the whole Universal
System.
<P>
** Another point of disagreement. Occultism says: &quot;The astral
prototypes of the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms up to
man have taken that time (300 million years) to evolve, re-forming
out of the cast-off materials of the preceding Round, which, though
very dense and physical in their own cycle, are relatively ethereal
as compared with the materiality of our present middle Round.
At the expiration of these 300 million years, Nature, on the way
to the physical and material, down the arc of descent, begins
with mankind and works downwards, hardening or materialising forms
as it proceeds. Thus the fossils found in strata, to which an
antiquity, not of eighteen, but of many hundreds of millions of
years, must be ascribed, belong in reality to forms of the preceding
Round, which, while living, were far more ethereal than physical,
as <EM>we</EM> <EM>know the physical. </EM>That we perceive and
disinter them as tangible forms, is due to the process of materialization
or crystallization referred to, which took place subsequently,
at the beginning of the Fourth Round, and reached its maximum
after the appearance of man, proceeding parallel with his physical
evolution. This alone illustrates the fact that the degree of
materiality of the Earth changes <EM>pari passu </EM>with that
of its inhabitants. And thus man now finds, as tangible fossils,
what were once the (to his present senses) ethereal forms of the
lower kingdoms. The above Brahmanical figures refer to evolution
beginning on Globe A, and in the First Round. In this Volume we
speak only of this, the Fourth Round.&quot;
<P>
*** This difference and the change of cyphers in the last three
triplets of figures, the writer cannot undertake to account for.
According to every calculation, once the three hundred millions
are subtracted, the figures ought to stand, 1,655,884,687. But
they are given as stated in the Tamil calendar above-named and
as they were translated. The school of the late Pandit Dayanand
Saraswati, founder of the Arya Samaj, gives a date of 1,960,852,987.

* <STRONG>V</STRONG>AIVASVATA Manu is the one human being -- some
versions add to him the seven Rishis -- who in the <EM>Matsya
</EM>Avatar allegory is saved from the Deluge in a boat, like
Noah in the Ark. Therefore, this <EM>Vaivasvata Manvantara </EM>would
be the &quot;post-Diluvian&quot; period. This, however, does not
refer to the later &quot;Atlantean&quot; or Noah's deluge, nor
to the Cosmic <EM>Deluge </EM>or<EM> Pralaya </EM>of obscuration,
which preceded our Round, but to the appearance of mankind in
the latter Round. There is a great difference made, however, between
the &quot;<EM>Naimitika,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>occasional or incidental,
&quot;<EM>Prakritika</EM>,&quot; elemental, &quot;<EM>Atyantika,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>the absolute, and &quot;<EM>Nitya,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>the
perpetual Pralaya; the latter being described as &quot;Brahma's
contingent recoalescence of the Universe at the end of Brahma's
<STRONG>D</STRONG>AY.&quot; The question was raised by a learned
Brahmin Theosophist: &quot;Whether there is such a thing as <EM>Cosmic
</EM>Pralaya; because, otherwise, the <EM>Logos </EM>(Krishna)
would have to be reborn, and he is <EM>Aja</EM> (unborn).&quot;
We cannot see why. The <EM>Logos </EM>is said to be born only
metaphorically, as the Sun is born daily, or rather a beam of
that Sun is born in the morning and is said to die when it disappears,
whereas it is simply reabsorbed into the parent essence. Cosmic
<EM>Pralaya </EM>is for things visible, not for the <EM>Arupa</EM>,
formless, world. The Cosmic or Universal <EM>Pralaya</EM> comes
only at the end of one hundred years of Brahma; when the Universal
dissolution is said to take place. Then the <EM>Avyaya, </EM>say
the exoteric scriptures, the eternal life symbolized by Vishnu,
assuming the character of Rudra, the <EM>Destroyer, </EM>enters
into the <EM>Seven</EM> Rays of the Sun and drinks up all the
waters of the Universe. &quot;Thus fed, the seven solar Rays dilate
to <EM>seven Suns </EM>and set fire to the whole Cosmos. . . .

<P>
These are the exoteric figures accepted throughout India, and
they dovetail pretty nearly with those of the Secret works. The
latter, moreover, amplify them by a division into a number of
esoteric cycles, never mentioned in Brahmanical popular writings
-- one of which, the division of the Yugas into racial cycles,
is given elsewhere as an instance. The rest, in their details,
have of course never been made public. They are, nevertheless,
known to every &quot;<EM>Twice-born</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(Dwija,
or Initiated) Brahmin, and the Puranas contain references to some
of them in veiled terms, which no matter-of-fact Orientalist has
yet endeavoured to make out, nor could he if he would.
<P>
These sacred astronomical cycles are of immense antiquity, and
most of them pertain, as stated, to the calculations of Narada
and Asuramaya. The latter has the reputation of a giant and a
sorcerer. But the antediluvian giants (the Gibborim of the Bible)
were not all bad or Sorcerers, as Christian Theology, which sees
in every Occultist a servant of the Evil one, would have it; nor
were they worse than many of &quot;the faithful sons of the Church.&quot;
A Torquemada and a Catherine de Medicis certainly did more harm
in their day and in the name of their Master than any Atlantean
giant or demigod of antiquity ever did; whether his name was Cyclops,
or Medusa, or yet the Orphic Titan, the <EM>anguipedal </EM>monster
known as Ephialtes. There were <EM>good </EM>&quot;giants&quot;
in days of old just as there are <EM>bad</EM> &quot;pigmies&quot;
now; and the Rakshasas and Yakshas of Lanka are no worse than
our modern dynamiters, and certain Christian and civilised generals
during modern wars. Nor are they myths. &quot;He who would laugh
at Briareus and Orion ought to abstain from going to, or even
talking of, Karnac or Stonehenge,&quot; remarks somewhere a modern
writer.
<P>
As the Brahmanical figures given above are approximately the basic
calculations of our esoteric system, the reader is requested to
carefully keep them in mind.
<P>
In the &quot;<EM>Encyclopaedia Britannica</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>one
finds, as the last word of science, that the antiquity of man
is allowed to stretch <EM>only over </EM>&quot;tens of thou-<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 71 SCIENTIFIC SELF-COMPLACENCE.</H6>

<P>
sands of years.&quot;* It becomes evident that as these figures
may be made to fluctuate between 10,000 and 100,000, therefore
they mean very little if anything, and only render still denser
the darkness surrounding the question. Moreover, what matters
it that science places the birth of man in the &quot;pre- or post-glacial
drift,&quot; if we are told at the same time that the so-called
&quot;ice age&quot; is simply a long succession of ages which
&quot;shaded without abrupt change of any kind into what is termed
the human or Recent period . . . the overlapping of geological
periods having been the rule from the beginning of time.&quot;
The latter &quot;rule&quot; only results in the still more puzzling,
even if strictly <EM>scientific </EM>and correct, information,
that &quot;even to-day man is contemporary with the ice-age in
the Alpine valleys and in the Finmark.&quot;**
<P>
Thus, had it not been for the lessons taught by the <EM>Secret
Doctrine, </EM>and even by exoteric Hinduism and its traditions,
we should be left to this day to float in perplexed uncertainty
between the indefinite ages of one school of science, the &quot;tens
of thousands&quot; of years of the other, and the 6,000 years
of the Bible interpreters. This is one of the several reasons
why, with all the respect due to the conclusions of the men of
learning of our modern day, we are forced to ignore them in all
such questions of pre-historic antiquity.
<P>
Modern Geology and Anthropology must, of course, disagree with
our views. But Occultism will find as many weapons against these
two sciences as it has against astronomical and physical theories,
in spite of Mr. Laing's assurances that*** &quot;in (chronological)
calculations of this sort, concerning older and later formations,
there is no <EM>theory, </EM>and they are based on positive <EM>facts,
</EM>limited only by a certain possible (?) amount of error either
way,&quot; occultism will prove, scientific confessions in hand,
that geology is very much in error, and very often even more so
than Astronomy. In this very passage by Mr. Laing, which gives
to Geology pre-eminence for correctness over Astronomy, we find
a passage in flagrant contradiction to the admissions of the best
Geologists themselves. Says the author --
<P>
&quot;In short, the conclusions of Geology, at any rate up to
the Silurian period,**** when the present order of things was

<EM>theories </EM>based on <EM>data so uncertain, </EM>that while

cases they give results incredibly short . . . in others they
give results almost incredibly long.&quot;
<P>
After which, the reader is advised that the safest course &quot;seems
to be to <EM>assume </EM>that Geology really proves the <EM>duration
of the present order of things </EM>to have been somewhere over
100 millions of years,&quot; as &quot;Astronomy gives an enormous
though unknown time in the past, and to come in the future, for
the birth, growth, maturity, decline, and death of the Solar System,
of which our Earth is a small planet now passing through the habitable
phase.&quot; (p. 49.)
<P>
Judging from past experience, we do not entertain the slightest
doubt that, once called upon to answer &quot;the absurd unscientific
and preposterous claims of exoteric (and esoteric) Aryan chronology,&quot;
the scientist of &quot;the results incredibly short,&quot; <EM>i.e.</EM>,
only 15,000,000 years, and the scientist, who &quot;would require
600,000,000 years,&quot; together with those who accept Mr. Huxley's
figures of 1,000,000,000 &quot;since sedimentation began in Europe&quot;
(<EM>World Life</EM>)<EM>, </EM>would all be as dogmatic one as
the other. Nor would they fail to remind the Occultist and the
Brahmin, that it is the modern men of science alone who represent
exact science, whose duty it is to fight <EM>inaccuracy</EM> and<EM>
superstition.</EM> 
<P>
The earth is passing through the &quot;habitable phase&quot; only
for the <EM>present order </EM>of things, and as far as our present
mankind is concerned with its actual &quot;coats of skin&quot;
and phosphorus for bones and brain.
<P>
We are ready to concede the 100 millions of years offered by Geology,
since we are taught that our present physical mankind -- or the
<EM>Vaivasvata</EM> humanity -- began only 18 millions of years
ago. But Geology has no facts to give us for the duration of geological
periods, as we have shown, no more indeed than has Astronomy.
The authentic letter from Mr. W. Pengelly, <STRONG>F.R.S</STRONG>.,
quoted elsewhere, says that: &quot;It is at present, and perhaps
always will be, <STRONG>IMPOSSIBLE </STRONG>to reduce, even approximately,
geological time into years or even into millenniums.&quot; And
having never, hitherto, excavated a fossil man of any other than
the <EM>present form -- </EM>what does Geology know of him? It
has traced zones or strata and, with these, primordial zoological
life, down to the Silurian. When it has, in the same way, traced
man down to his primordial protoplasmic form, then we will admit
that it may know something of primordial man. If it is not very
material &quot;to the bearings of modern scientific discovery
on modern thought,&quot; whether &quot;man has existed in state
of constant though slow progression for the last 50,000 years
of period of 15 millions, or for the last 500,000 years of a period
of 150 millions&quot; (&quot;Modern Science, etc.&quot; p. 49),
as Mr. S. Laing tells his readers, it is very much so for the
claims of the Occultists. Unless the latter show that it is a<EM>
possibility, </EM>if not a perfect certainty, that man<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 73 COSMOGONY, AN INTELLIGENT PLAN.</H6>

<P>
lived 18 millions of years ago, the Secret Doctrine might as well
have remained unwritten. An attempt must, therefore, be made in
this direction, and it is our modern geologists and men of science
generally who will be brought to testify to this fact in the third
part of this volume. Meanwhile, and notwithstanding the fact that
Hindu Chronology is constantly represented by the Orientalists
as a fiction based on no &quot;<EM>actual</EM> computation,&quot;*
but simply a &quot;childish boasting,&quot; it is nevertbeless
often twisted out of recognition to make it yield to, and fit
in with, Western theories. No figures have ever been more meddled
with and tortured than the famous 4, <EM>3, 2, </EM>followed by
cyphers of the Yugas and Maha-Yugas.
<P>
As the whole cycle of prehistoric events, such as the evolution
and transformation of Races and the extreme antiquity of man,
hangs upon the said Chronology, it becomes extremely important
to check it by other existing calculations. If the Eastern Chronology
is rejected, we shall at least have the consolation of proving
that no other -- whether the figures of Science or of the Churches
-- is one whit more reliable. As Professor Max Muller expresses
it, it is often as useful to prove what a thing is not as to show
what it may be. And once we succeed in pointing out the fallacies
of both Christian and scientific computations -- by allowing them
a fair chance of comparison with our Chronology -- neither of
the two will have a reasonable ground to stand upon, in pronouncing
the esoteric figures less reliable than its own.
<P>
We may here refer the reader to our earlier work &quot;<EM>Isis
Unveiled,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Vol. I., p. 32, for some remarks
concerning the figures which were cited a few pages back.
<P>
To-day a few more facts may be added to the information there
given, which is already known to every Orientalist. The sacredness
of the cycle of 4320, with additional cyphers, lies in the fact
that the figures which compose it, taken separately or joined
in various combinations, are each and all symbolical of the greatest
mysteries in Nature. Indeed, whether one takes the 4 separately,
or the 3 by itself, or the two together making 7, or again the
three added together and yielding 9, all these numbers have their
application in the most sacred and occult things, and record the
workings of Nature in her eternally periodical phenomena. They
are never erring, perpetually recurring numbers, unveiling, to
him who studies the secrets of Nature, a truly divine System,
an <EM>intelligent </EM>plan in Cosmogony, which results in natural
cosmic divisions of times, seasons, invisible influences, astronomical
phenomena, with their action and reaction on terrestrial and even
moral nature; on

<P>
birth, death, and growth, on health and disease. All these natural
events are based and depend upon cyclical processes in the Kosmos
itself, producing periodic agencies which, acting from without,
affect the Earth and all that lives and breathes on it, from one
end to the other of any Manvantara. Causes and effects are esoteric,
exoteric, and <EM>endexoteric, </EM>so to say.
<P>
In<EM> Isis Unveiled </EM>we wrote that which we now repeat: --
&quot;<EM>We are at the bottom of a cycle and evidently in a transitory
state. </EM>Plato divides the intellectual progress of the universe
during every cycle into fertile and barren periods. In the sublunary
regions, the spheres of the various elements remain eternally
in perfect harmony with the divine nature, he says; 'but their
parts,' owing to a too close proximity to earth, and their commingling
with the <EM>earthly </EM>(which is matter, and therefore the
realm of evil), 'are sometimes according, and sometimes contrary
to (divine) nature.' When those circulations -- which Eliphas
Levi calls ' currents of the astral light' -- in the universal
ether which contains in itself every element, take place in harmony
with the divine spirit, our earth and everything pertaining to
it enjoys a fertile period. The occult powers of plants, animals,
and minerals magically sympathize with the ' superior natures,'
and the divine soul of man is in perfect intelligence with these
'inferior' ones. But during the barren periods, the latter lose
their magic sympathy, and the spiritual sight of the majority
of mankind is so blinded as to lose every notion of the superior
powers of its own divine spirit. We are in a barren period: the
eighteenth century, during which the malignant fever of scepticism
broke out so irrepressibly, has entailed unbelief as an hereditary
disease upon the nineteenth. The divine intellect is veiled in
man; his animal brain alone<EM> philosophizes.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>And philosophizing alone, how can it understand the &quot;<STRONG>S</STRONG>OUL
<STRONG>D</STRONG>OCTRINE&quot;?
<P>
In order not to break the thread of the narrative we shall give
some striking proofs of these cyclic laws in Part II., proceeding
meanwhile with our explanations of geological and racial cycles.
