<H4>THE MYSTERIES OF THE HEBDOMAD.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>W</STRONG>E must not close this Part on the Symbolism
of Archaic History, without an attempt to explain the perpetual
recurrence of this truly mystic number in every scripture known
to the Orientalists. As every religion, from the oldest to the
latest, claims its presence, and explains it on its own grounds
agreeably with its own special dogmas, this is no easy task. We
can, therefore, do no better or more explanatory work than to
give a bird's-eye view of all. These sacred numbers (3, 4, 7)
are the sacred numbers of <EM>Light, Life,</EM> and<EM> Union
</EM>-- especially in this present manvantara, our Life-cycle;
of which number seven is the special representative, or the <EM>Factor
</EM>number. This has now to be demonstrated.
<P>
If one happened to ask a Brahmin learned in the Upanishads --
so full of the secret wisdom of old, why &quot;he, of whom seven
forefathers have drunk the juice of the moon-plant, is <EM>trisuparna,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>as Bopaveda is credited with saying; and why the Somapa Pitris
should be worshipped by the Brahmin <EM>trisuparna</EM> -- very
few could answer the question; or, if they knew, they would still
less satisfy one's curiosity. Let us, then, hold to what the old
Esoteric doctrine teaches.
<P>
&quot;<EM>When the first </EM>'<EM>Seven</EM>'<EM> appeared on
earth, they threw the seed of</EM> <EM>everything that grows on
the land into the soil. First came three, and</EM> <EM>four were
added to these as soon as stone was transformed into plant.</EM>
<EM>Then came the second </EM>'<EM>Seven,</EM>'<EM> who, guiding
the </EM>Jivas <EM>of the plants,</EM> <EM>produced the middle
</EM>(<EM>intermediate</EM>)<EM> natures between plant and moving</EM>
<EM>living animal. The third </EM>'<EM>Seven</EM>'<EM> evolved</EM>
<EM>their</EM> Chhayas. . . . <EM>The fifth</EM> '<EM>Seven</EM>'<EM>
imprisoned their </EM><STRONG>E</STRONG>SSENCE. . . . <EM>Thus
man became a Saptaparna.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Commentary.</EM>)

Such is the name given in Occult phraseology to man. It means
as shown elsewhere, a seven-leaved plant, and the name has a great
significance in the Buddhist legends. So it had, also, under disguise,
in the Greek &quot;myths.&quot; The T, or <IMG SRC="sd1-5e.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
(<EM>tau</EM>)<I>, </I>formed from the figure 7, and the Greek
letter [[<I>G</I>]] (<EM>gamma</EM>)<EM>, </EM>was<EM> </EM>(<EM>see

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 591 THE MEANING OF THE DOUBLE TRIANGLE.</H6>

<P>
and of life eternal: of earthly life, because [[<I>G</I>]] (<EM>gamma</EM>)<EM>
</EM>is the symbol of the Earth (<EM>gaia</EM>)*; and of &quot;life
eternal,&quot; because the figure 7 is the symbol of the same
life <EM>linked with divine life, </EM>the double glyph expressed
in geometrical figures being: --
<P>
<IMG SRC="sd2-591a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
a triangle and a quaternary, the symbol of <EM>septenary </EM>MAN.
<P>
Now, the number <EM>six </EM>has been regarded in the ancient
mysteries as an emblem of <EM>physical nature. </EM>For six is
the representation of the <EM>six</EM> dimensions of all bodies:
the <EM>six </EM>lines which compose their form, namely, the four
lines extending to the four cardinal points, North, South, East,
and West, and the two lines of height and thickness that answer
to the Zenith and the Nadir. Therefore, while the <EM>senary </EM>was
applied by the sages to <EM>physical </EM>man, the <EM>septenary
</EM>was for them the symbol of that man <EM>plus </EM>his immortal
soul.
<P>
Ragon gives in his <EM>Maconnerie Occulte </EM>a very good illustration
of the &quot;hieroglyphical senary,&quot; as he calls our double
equilateral triangle, <IMG SRC="sd2-591b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">.
He shows it as the symbol of the commingling of the &quot;<EM>philosophical
three </EM>fires and the <EM>three </EM>waters, whence results
the procreation of the elements of all things. The same idea is
found in the Indian equilateral double triangle. For, though it
is called in that country the sign of Vishnu, yet in truth it
is the symbol of the Triad (or the Trimurti). For, even in the
exoteric rendering, the lower triangle <IMG SRC="sd2-591c.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
with the apex downward, is the symbol of Vishnu, the god of the
moist principle and water (&quot;<EM>Nara</EM>-yana,&quot; or
the moving Principle in <EM>Nara, </EM>water;**) while the triangle,
with its apex upward, <IMG SRC="sd1-113.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> is
Siva, the Principle of Fire, symbolized by the triple flame in
his hand. (See the bronze statue of Tripurantika Siva, &quot;Mahadeva
destroying Tripurasura,&quot; at the museum of the India House).
It is these two interlaced triangles -- wrongly called &quot;Solomon's
seal,&quot; which also form the emblem of our
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Hence the Initiates in Greece called the <EM>Tau</EM> [[<I>I</I>]]<EM>,
</EM>son of <EM>gaia</EM>, &quot;sprung from earth,&quot; like
<EM>Tityos </EM>in Odyssey 7, 324.
<P>
** See the <EM>Mahabharata, e.g.,</EM><STRONG> III</STRONG>.,
189, 3, where Vishnu says, &quot;I called the name of water <EM>nara</EM>
in ancient times, and am hence called <EM>Narayana</EM>, for that
was always the abode I moved in&quot; (<EM>Ayana</EM>). It is
into the water (or chaos, the &quot;moist principle&quot; of the
Greeks and Hermes), that the first seed of the Universe is thrown.
&quot;The 'Spirit of God' moves on the dark waters of Space&quot;;
hence Thales makes of it the primordial element and prior to Fire,
which was yet latent in that Spirit.<HR>

<P>
Society -- that produce the Septenary and the Triad at one and
the same time, and are the <EM>Decad, </EM>whatever way this sign
<IMG SRC="sd2-591b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> is examined, as all the
ten numbers are contained therein. For with a point in the middle
or centre, thus <IMG SRC="sd2-36b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> it is a
sevenfold sign; its triangles denote number 3; the <EM>two</EM>
triangles show the presence of the binary; the triangles with
the central point common to both yield the quaternary; the six
points are the senary; and the central point, the unit; the <EM>quinary
</EM>being traced by combination, as a compound of <I>two</I>
triangles, the even number, and of <EM>three </EM>sides in each
triangle, the first odd number. This is the reason why Pythagoras
and the ancients made the number <EM>six </EM>sacred to Venus,
since &quot;the union of the two sexes, and the spagyrisation
of matter by triads are necessary to develop the generative force,
that prolific virtue and tendency to reproduction which is inherent
in all bodies.&quot;*
<P>
Belief in &quot;Creators,&quot; or the personified Powers of Nature,
is in truth no polytheism, but a philosophical necessity. Like
all the other planets of our system, the Earth has seven Logoi
-- the emanating rays of the one &quot;Father-Ray&quot; -- the
PROTOGONOS, or the manifested &quot;Logos&quot; -- he who sacrifices
his Esse (or flesh, the Universe) that the world may live and
every creature therein have conscious being.
<P>
Numbers 3 and 4 are respectively male and female, Spirit and Matter,
and their union is the emblem of life eternal in spirit on its
ascending arc, and in matter as the ever resurrecting element
-- by procreation and reproduction. The spiritual male line is
vertical <IMG SRC="sd2-592a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">; the differentiated
matter-line is horizontal; the two forming the cross or <IMG SRC="sd2-592b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">.
The former (the 3), is invisible; the latter (the 4), is on the
plane of objective perception. This is why all the matter of the
Universe, when analyzed by science to its ultimates, can be reduced
to four elements only -- carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen:
and why the three primaries, the noumenoi of the four, or graduated
Spirit or Force, have remained a <EM>terra incognita </EM>and
mere speculations, names, to exact Science. Her servants must
believe in and study first the primary causes, before they can
hope to fathom the nature and acquaint themselves with the potentialities
of the effects. Thus, while the men of Western learning had, and
still have, the four, or matter to toy with, the Eastern Occultists
and their disciples, the great alchemists the world over, have
the whole septenate to study from.** As those Alche-

mists have it: -- &quot;When the Three and the Four kiss each
other, the Quaternary joins its middle nature with that of the
Triangle,&quot; (or Triad, <EM>i.e.</EM>, the face of one of its
plane surfaces becoming the middle face of the other), &quot;and
becomes a cube; then only does it (the cube unfolded) become the
vehicle and the number of <STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE, the Father-Mother

may be sufficient, as shown by the Taraka Yoga system; but for
<EM>practical occult teaching </EM>our septenary division is the
best and easiest. It is, however, a matter of school and choice.

stones that hardened&quot; (Stanza) followed by the &quot;hard
plants that softened,&quot; which are the product of the mineral,
for &quot;it is from the bosom of the stone that vegetation is
born&quot; (<EM>Commentary, Book IX., F. </EM>19); and then to
man -- all the primitive models in every kingdom of nature begin
by being ethereal, transparent, films. This, of course, takes
place only in the first beginning of life. With the next period
they consolidate, and at the <EM>seventh </EM>begin to branch
off into species, <EM>all except men, </EM>the first of the mammalian

philosophy, sang evolution in the following strains: --

<P>
&quot;First came three, or the triangle.&quot; This expression
has a profound meaning in Occultism, and the fact is corroborated
in mineralogy, botany, and even in geology, as was demonstrated
in the section on &quot;Ancient Chronology,&quot; by the compound
number seven, the three and the four being in it. Salt in solution
proves it. For when its molecules, clustering together, begin
to deposit themselves as a solid, the first shape they assume
is that of triangles, of small pyramids and cones. It is the figure
of <EM>fire</EM>, whence the word &quot;<EM>pyramids</EM>&quot;<EM>;
</EM>while the second geometrical figure in <EM>manifested </EM>Nature
is a square or a cube, 4 and 6; for, &quot;the particles of earth
being cubical, those of fire are pyramidal&quot; truly -- (Enfield).
The pyramidal shape is that assumed by the pines -- the most primitive
tree after the fern period. Thus the two opposites in cosmic nature
-- fire and water, heat and cold -- begin their metrographical
manifestations, one by a trimetric, the other by a hexagonal system.
For the stellate crystals of snow, viewed under a microscope,

in mind that when we speak of &quot;animals,&quot; the mammalians
alone are meant. Crustacea, fishes, and reptiles are contemporary
with, and most have preceded <EM>physical </EM>man in this Round.
All were bisexual, however, before the age of mammalia in the
closing portion of the secondary or Mesozoic ages, <EM>yet nearer
to the Palaeozoic than the Cenozoic ages. </EM>Smaller marsupial
mammalia are contemporary with the huge reptilian monsters of

the vital principles </EM>of the flying kind and the monsters
which the Ocean breeds under its smooth crystal plane.&quot; &quot;All
proceeds from Ether and from its seven natures&quot; -- said the
alchemists. Science knows these only in their superficial effects.

Darwin, in his &quot;Descent of Man,&quot; p. 164. showing that
the inhabitants of the sea-shore are greatly affected by the tides:
--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The most ancient progenitors in the Kingdom of the Vertebrata
. . . apparently consisted of a group of marine animals. . . .
Animals living either about the <EM>mean </EM>high-water mark,
or about the <EM>mean</EM> low-water mark, pass through a complete
cycle of tidal changes in a fortnight. . . . Now it is a mysterious
fact that in the higher and now terrestrial Vertebrata . . . many
normal and abnormal processes have one or more weeks (septenates)
as their periods . . . such as gestation of mammals, the duration
of fevers,&quot; etc. . . &quot;The eggs of the pigeon are hatched
in two weeks (or 14 days); those of the fowl in three; those of
the duck in four: those of the goose in five; and those of the
ostrich in seven.&quot; (Bartlett's &quot;Land and Water.&quot;)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This number is closely connected with the moon, whose occult influence
is ever manifesting itself in septenary periods. It is the moon
which is the guide of the occult side of terrestrial nature, while
the Sun is the regulator and factor of manifested life; (See also
Vol. I., Part<STRONG> II</STRONG>.), and this truth was ever evident
to the Seers and the adepts. Jacob Boehme, by insisting on the
fundamental doctrine of the seven properties of everlasting mother
Nature, proved himself thereby a great Occultist.
<P>
But to return to the consideration of the septenary in ancient
religious symbolism. To the metrological key to the symbolism
of the Hebrews, which reveals numerically the geometrical relations
of the Circle (All-Deity) to the Square, Cube, Triangle, and all
the integral emanations of the divine area, may be added the theogonic
Key. This Key explains that Noah, the deluge-Patriarch, is in
one aspect the permutation of the Deity (the Universal Creative
Law), for the purpose of the formation of our Earth, its population,
and the propagation of life on it, in general.
<P>
Now bearing in mind the Septenary division in divine Hierarchies,
as in Cosmic and human constitutions, the student will readily
understand that Jah-Noah is at the head of, and is the synthesis
of the lower Cosmic Quaternary. The upper Sephirothal <IMG SRC="sd1-113.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,
triad -- of which Jehovah-Binah (Intelligence) is the left, female
angle -- emanates the <IMG SRC="sd1-114a.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
Quaternary. The latter symbolizing by itself the &quot;Heavenly
Man,&quot; the sexless Adam-Kadmon viewed as Nature in the abstract,
becomes a septenate again by emanating from itself the additional
three principles, the lower terrestrial or manifested physical
Nature, Matter and our Earth (the seventh being Malkuth, the &quot;Bride
of the Heavenly Man&quot;), thus forming, with the higher triad,
or Kether, the Crown, the full number of the Sephirothal Tree
-- the 10, the Total in Unity, or the Universe. Apart from the
higher Triad, the lower creative Sephiroth are seven.
<P>
The above is not directly to our point, though it is a necessary
<HR>

<P>
reminder to facilitate the comprehension of what follows. The
question at issue is to show that Jah-Noah, or the Jehovah of
the Hebrew Bible, the alleged Creator of our Earth, of man and
all upon it, is: --
<P>
(<I>a</I>) The lowest Septenary, the Creative Elohim -- in his
Cosmic aspect.
<P>
(<I>b</I>) The Tetragrammaton or the Adam-Kadmon, &quot;the Heavenly
Man&quot; of the Four letters -- in his theogonic and Kabalistic
aspects.
<P>
(<I>c</I>) Noah -- identical with the Hindu <EM>Sishta, </EM>the
human seed, left for the peopling of the Earth from a previous
creation or Manvantara, as expressed in the Puranas, or the pre-diluvian
period as rendered allegorically in the Bible -- in his Cosmic
character.
<P>
But whether a Quaternary (Tetragrammaton) or a Triad, the Bible
Creative God is not the Universal 10, unless blended with <STRONG>A</STRONG>IN-<STRONG>S</STRONG>OPH
(as Brahma with Parabrahm), but a septenary, one of the many Septenaries
of the Universal Septenate. In the explanation of the question
now in hand, his position and status as Noah may best be shown
by placing the 3, <IMG SRC="sd1-113.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,and 4,
<IMG SRC="sd1-114a.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> on parallel lines with
the &quot;Cosmic&quot; and &quot;Human&quot; principles. For the
latter, the old familiar classification is made use of. Thus:

&quot;In the language of Hindu philosophers it is the original

existence which remains in the universe of Ideas. This . . . then,

of any other object. In their opinion, a conscious God cannot
be the origin of the Universe, as his Ego would be the effect
of a previous cause, if the word conscious conveys but its ordinary
meaning. They cannot admit that <EM>the grand total of all the
states of consciousness in the Universe </EM>is their deity, as
these states are constantly changing, and as cosmic ideation ceases
during <EM>Pralaya</EM>. There is only one permanent condition
in the Universe, which is the state of perfect unconsciousness,
bare <EM>Chidakasam </EM>(the field of consciousness) in fact.
When my readers once realize the fact that this grand universe
is in reality but a huge aggregation of various states of consciousness,
they will not be surprised to find that the ultimate state of
unconsciousness is considered as Parabrahmam by the Adwaitees.&quot;*

Being itself entirely out of human reckoning or calculation, yet
this &quot;huge aggregation of various states of consciousness&quot;

in <EM>its</EM> totality entirely composed of Septenary groups;
simply because &quot;the capacity of perception <EM>exists in
seven different aspects corresponding</EM> <EM>to the seven conditions
of matter</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>ibid</EM>)<EM>, </EM>or the
seven properties, or states, or conditions of matter. And, therefore,
number 1 down to number 7 begins in the esoteric calculations
with the first manifested principle, which is number one if we
commence from above, and the <EM>seventh </EM>when reckoning from
below, or from the lowest Principle.
<P>
The <EM>Tetrad </EM>is esteemed in the Kabala, as it was by Pythagoras,
the most perfect, or rather <EM>sacred</EM> number, because it
emanated from the <EM>one,</EM> the first manifested Unit, or
rather <EM>the three in one. </EM>Yet the latter has been ever
impersonal, sexless, incomprehensible, though within the possibility
of the higher mental perceptions.
<P>
The first manifestation of the eternal monad was never meant to
stand as the symbol of another symbol, the <STRONG>U</STRONG>NBORN
for the Element-born, or the one <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS for the
Heavenly man. Tetragrammaton, or the Tetractys of the Greeks,
is the <EM>Second logos, </EM>the Demiurgos. The Tetrad, as Thomas
Taylor thought (<EM>vide</EM> the<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Pythagorean
Triangle</EM>&quot;)<EM>, </EM>&quot;is the <EM>animal itself
</EM>of Plato, who, as Syrianus justly observes, was the best
of the Pythagoreans; it subsists at the extremity of the intelligible
triad, as is most satisfactorily shown by Proclus in the third
book of his treatise on the theology of Plato. And between these
two triads (the double triangle), the one intelligible, and the
other intellectual, another order of gods exists which partakes
of both extremes.&quot; &quot;The Pythagorean world,&quot; Plutarch
tells us (in <EM>De anim. procr.,</EM> 1027)<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>consisted
of a double</EM> <EM>quaternary.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>This statement
corroborates what is said about the choice, by the exoteric theologies,
<EM>of the lower </EM>Tetraktis. For: -- &quot;The quaternary
of the intellectual world (the world of <EM>Mahat</EM>)<EM> </EM>is
T'Agathon, Nous, Psyche, Hyle; while that of the sensible world
(of matter), which is properly what Pythagoras meant by the word
Kosmos -- is Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. The four elements are
called by the name of <EM>rizomata, </EM>the roots or principles
<EM>of all mixed bodies,</EM>&quot;<EM> i.e., </EM>the lower Tetraktis
is the root of <EM>illusion </EM>of the world of matter; and this
is the tetragrammaton of the Jews, and the &quot;mysterious deity,&quot;
over which the modern Kabalists make such a fuss!
<P>
&quot;Thus number <EM>four</EM> forms the arithmetical mean between
the monad and the <EM>heptad, </EM>as this contains all powers,
both of the productive and produced numbers; for this of all numbers
under ten, is made of a certain number; the duad doubled makes
a tetrad, and the tetrad doubled or unfolded makes the <EM>hebdomad
</EM>(the septenary). Two multiplied into itself produces four;
and retorted into itself makes the first cube. This first cube
<EM>is a fertile number, </EM>the ground of multitude and variety,
constituted of two and four (depending on the monad, the <EM>seventh</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>Thus the two principles of temporal things, the <EM>pyramis

cube, form and matter, flow from one fountain, the tetragon (on
earth) the<EM> monad </EM>(in heaven) . . . . &quot; (See Reuchlin,
&quot;<EM>Cabala</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>1<EM>, </EM>ii.).
<P>
Here Reuchlin, the great authority on the Kabala, shows the cube
to be <EM>matter, </EM>whereas the pyramid or the <EM>triad </EM>is
&quot;form.&quot; With the Hermesians the number four becomes
the symbol of truth <EM>only when amplified into a cube, </EM>which,
unfolded, makes seven, as symbolizing the male and female elements
and the element of <STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE.*
<P>
Some students have been puzzled to account for the vertical line,
which is male, becoming (<EM>vide infra</EM>)<EM> </EM>in the
cross a four-partitioned line <EM>-- four </EM>being a female
number, while the horizontal (the line of matter) becomes three-divisioned.
But this is easy of explanation. Since the middle face of the
cube unfolded <EM>is common </EM>to both the vertical and the
horizontal bar, or double-line, it becomes <EM>neutral</EM> ground
so to say, and belongs to neither. The spirit line remains triadic,
and the matter line two-fold -- two being an even and therefore
a female number also. Moreover, according to Theon, the Pythagoreans
who gave the name of Harmony to the Tetraktis, &quot;because it
is a diatessaron in sesquitertia&quot; -- were of opinion that
&quot;the division of the canon of the monochord was made by the
tetraktis in the <EM>duad, triad, </EM>and<EM> tetrad;</EM> for
it comprehends a sesquitertia, a sesquialtera, a double, a triple,
and a quadruple proportion, the section of which is 27.&quot;
&quot;In the ancient musical notation, the tetrachord consisted
of <EM>three </EM>degrees or intervals, and <EM>four </EM>terms
of sounds called by the Greeks diatessaron, and by us a fourth.&quot;
Moreover, the quaternary though an even, therefore a female (&quot;infernal&quot;)
number, varied according to its form. This is shown by Stanley
(in <EM>Pythag. </EM>p. 61). The 4 was called by the

in connection with the circle . . . . &quot;becomes . . a cross
proper, or of the <EM>tau</EM> form, and the attachment of the
circle to this last gives the <EM>ansated cross </EM>of the Egyptians
. . . . while there are but 6 faces to a cube, the representation
of the cross as the cube unfolded, as to the cross-bars, displays
<EM>one face of the cube as common to</EM> <EM>two bars, </EM>counted

&quot;Here we have the famous 4, and 3, and 7.&quot; Esoteric
philosophy explains that <EM>four</EM> is the symbol of the Universe
in its potential state, or <EM>chaotic matter,</EM> and that it
requires Spirit to permeate it actively, <EM>i.e.</EM>, the primordial
<EM>abstract </EM>triangle has to quit its one dimensional quality
and spread across that matter, thus forming a <EM>manifested</EM>
basis on the three dimensional space, in order that the Universe
should manifest intelligibly. This is achieved by the cube unfolded.
Hence the <EM>ansated </EM>cross <IMG SRC="sd2-29b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">

<P>
Pythagoreans the Key-Keeper of Nature; but in union with the 3,
which made it seven, it became the most perfect and harmonious
number -- <EM>nature</EM> <EM>herself. </EM>The four was &quot;the
Masculine of Feminine Form,&quot; when forming the Cross; and
Seven is &quot;the Master of the Moon,&quot; for this planet is
forced to alter her appearance every seven days. It is on number
seven that Pythagoras composed his doctrine on the Harmony and
Music of the Spheres, calling &quot;a tone&quot; the distance
of the Moon from the Earth; from the Moon to Mercury half a tone,
from thence to Venus the same; from Venus to the Sun l 1/2 tones;
from the Sun to Mars a tone; from thence to Jupiter 1/2 a tone;
from Jupiter to Saturn 1/2 a tone; and thence to the Zodiac a
tone; thus making seven tones -- the diapason harmony. All the
melody of nature is in those seven tones, and therefore is called
&quot;the Voice of Nature.&quot;
<P>
Plutarch explains (<EM>de Plac. Phil., </EM>p. 878) that the Achaean
Greeks regarded the tetrad as the root and principle of all things,
since it was the number of the elements which gave birth to all
visible and invisible <EM>created</EM> things. With the brothers
of the Rosy Cross, the figure of the Cross, or <EM>Cube unfolded,
</EM>formed the subject of a disquisition in one of the theosophic
degrees of Peuret, and was treated according to the fundamental
principles of light and darkness, <EM>or good and evil.</EM> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The intelligible world proceeds out of the divine mind (or
unit) after this manner. The Tetraktis reflecting upon its own
essence, <EM>the first unit, productrix</EM> <EM>of all things,
</EM>and on its own beginning, saith thus: Once one, twice two,
immediately ariseth a tetrad, having on its top the highest unit,
<EM>and becomes a Pyramis,</EM> <EM>whose base </EM>is a plain
tetrad, answerable to a superficies, upon which the radiant light
of the divine unity produceth the form of incorporeal fire, by
reason of the descent of Juno (matter) to inferior things. Hence
ariseth essential light, not burning but illuminating. This <EM>is
the creation of the middle world, </EM>which the Hebrews <EM>call
the Supreme, </EM>the world of the (<EM>their</EM>)<EM> </EM>deity.
It is termed Olympus, entirely light, and replete with separate
forms, where is the seat of the immortal gods, '<EM>deum domus
alta,</EM>'<EM> </EM>whose top is UNITY, its wall <EM>trinity,</EM>
and its superficies <EM>quaternity.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(Reuchlin,<EM>
Cabala, </EM>p. 689).

<P>
The &quot;superficies&quot; has thus to remain a <EM>meaningless
surface, </EM>if left by itself. <STRONG>U</STRONG>NITY only &quot;illuminating&quot;
<EM>quaternity; </EM>the famous lower four has to build for itself
also a wall from <EM>trinity, </EM>if it would be manifested.
Moreover, the <EM>tetragrammaton, </EM>or Microprosopus, is &quot;Jehovah&quot;
arrogating to himself very improperly the &quot;Was, Is, Will
be,&quot; now translated into the &quot;<EM>I am that I am,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>and interpreted as referring to the highest abstract Deity,
while esoterically and in plain truth, it means only periodically
chaotic, turbulent, and eternal MATTER with all its potentialities.
For the Tetragrammaton is one with Nature or Isis, and is the
exoteric series of androgyne gods such as Osiris-Isis, Jove-Juno,
Brahma-Vach, or the Kabalistic <EM>Jah-hovah; </EM>all male-females.

has his name written with four letters. Thus with the Egyptians,
he was <EM>Teut; </EM>the Arabs, <EM>Alla</EM>; the Persians,

the Greeks, <EM>Theos; </EM>the ancient Turks, <EM>Esar; </EM>the
Latins, <EM>Deus; </EM>to which J. Lorenzo Anania adds the German
<EM>Gott; </EM>the Sarmatian, <EM>Bouh</EM>, etc., etc.
<P>
The Monad being one, and an <EM>odd</EM> number, the ancients
therefore called the odd, the only perfect numbers; and -- selfishly,
perhaps, yet as a fact -- considered them all as masculine and
perfect, being applicable to the celestial gods, while even numbers,
such as two, <EM>four, </EM>six, and especially eight, as being
female, were regarded as imperfect, and given only to the <EM>terrestrial</EM>
<EM>and infernal deities. </EM>In his eighth eclogue, Virgil records
the fact by saying, &quot;<EM>Numero deus impare gaudet,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>&quot;Unequal numbers please the gods.&quot;
<P>
But number <EM>seven, </EM>or the <EM>heptagon, </EM>the Pythagoreans
considered to be a <EM>religious and perfect </EM>number. It was
called &quot;<EM>Telesphoros,</EM>&quot; because <EM>by it all
in the Universe and mankind is led to its end, i.e., </EM>its
culmination (<EM>Philo. de Mund. opif.</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Being under
the rule of seven sacred planets,* the doctrine of the Spheres
shows, from Lemuria to Pythagoras, the seven powers of terrestrial
and sublunary nature, as well as the seven great Forces of the
Universe, proceeding and evolving in seven tones, which are the
seven notes of the musical scale. The <EM>heptad</EM> (our Septenary)
was regarded &quot;<EM>as the number of a virgin, because it is</EM>
<EM>unborn</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(like the Logos or the &quot;Aja&quot;
of the Vedantins); &quot;without a father or a mother, <EM>but
proceeding directly from the Monad, </EM>which is the origin and
crown of all things.&quot; (<EM>Pythag. Triangle, </EM>p. 174.)
And if the <EM>heptad </EM>is made to proceed from the Monad directly,
then it is, as taught in the Secret Doctrine of the oldest schools,
the perfect and sacred number of this Maha-Manvantara of ours.
<P>
The septenary, or <EM>heptad, </EM>was sacred indeed to several
gods and goddesses; to Mars, with his seven attendants, to Osiris,
whose body was divided into seven and twice seven parts; to Apollo
(the Sun), between his seven planets, and playing the hymn to
the seven-rayed on his seven-stringed harp; to Minerva, the fatherless
and the motherless, and others.
<P>
Cis-Himalayan Occultism with its <EM>sevening, </EM>and because
of such sevening, must be regarded as the most ancient, the original
of all. It is opposed by <EM>some </EM>fragments left by Neo-Platonists;
and the admirers of the latter, who hardly understand what they
defend, say to us: &quot;See, your forerunners believed only in
<EM>triple </EM>man, composed of

<P>
* The seven planets are not limited to this number because the
ancients knew of no others, but simply because they were the primitive
or primordial <EM>houses </EM>of the seven <EM>Logoi. </EM>There
may be nine and ninety-nine other planets discovered -- this does
not alter the fact of these seven alone being sacred.<HR>

Spirit, Soul, and body. Behold, the Taraka Raja Yoga of India
limits that division to 3, we, to 4, and the Vedantins to 5 (koshas).&quot;
To this, we of the Archaic school, ask: --
<P>
Why then does the Greek poet say that &quot;<EM>it is not four
</EM>but SEVEN who sing the praise of the Spiritual Sun,&quot;
[[<I>HEPTA ME</I>]]? He says--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Seven sounding letters sing the praise of me,<BR>
The immortal God, the Almighty deity.&quot; <BR>
. . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Why again is the <EM>triune </EM><STRONG>I</STRONG>AO (the Mystery
God) called the &quot;fourfold,&quot; and yet the triad and tetradic
symbols come under one unified name with the Christians -- the
Jehovah of the seven letters? Why again in the Hebrew Sheba is
the Oath (the Pythagorean <EM>Tetraktis</EM>)<EM> </EM>identical
with number 7; or, as Mr. G. Massey has it, &quot;taking an oath
was synonymous with 'to seven,' and the 10 expressed by the letter
<EM>Yod, </EM>was the full number of <STRONG>I</STRONG>AO-<STRONG>S</STRONG>ABAOTH,
the ten-lettered God&quot;? In Lucian's <EM>Auction,</EM> Pythagoras
asks, &quot;How do you reckon?&quot; The reply is, &quot;One,
Two, Three, Four.&quot; &quot;Then, do you see,&quot; says Pythagoras,
&quot;in <EM>what you</EM> <EM>conceive </EM><STRONG>F</STRONG>OUR
there are Ten; then, <EM>a perfect triangle and our Oath</EM>
(tetraktis, <EM>four!</EM>)<EM>,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>or Seven.
Why does Proclus say in <EM>Timaeus,</EM> c<EM>. iii.</EM> -<EM>-</EM>
&quot;The Father of the golden verses celebrates the Tetractys
as the fountain of perennial nature&quot;?
<P>
Simply because those Western Kabalists who quote the <EM>exoteric
</EM>proofs against us have no idea of the real <EM>esoteric </EM>meaning.
Because all the ancient Cosmologies -- the oldest Cosmographies
of the two most ancient people of the Fifth Root Race, the Hindu
Aryans and the Egyptians, adding to them the early Chinese races
(the remnants of the Fourth or Atlantean Race) -- based the whole
of their mysteries on number 10: the higher triangle standing
for the invisible and metaphysical world, the lower three and
four, or the <EM>Septenate, </EM>for the physical realm. It is
not the Jewish Bible that brought number seven into prominence.
Hesiod used the words &quot;The seventh is the sacred day,&quot;
before the Sabbath of &quot;Moses&quot; was ever heard of. The
use of number seven was never confined to any one nation. This
is well testified by the seven vases in the temple of the Sun,
near the ruins of Babion in Upper Egypt; the seven fires burning
continually for ages before the altars of Mithra; the seven holy
fanes of the Arabians; the seven peninsulas, the seven islands,
seven seas, mountains, and rivers of India; and of the <EM>Zohar
</EM>(See<EM> Ibn Gebirol</EM>)<EM>; </EM>the Jewish Sephiroth
of the <EM>Seven </EM>splendours; the seven Gothic deities, the
seven worlds of the Chaldeans and their seven Spirits; the seven
constellations mentioned by Hesiod and Homer; and all the interminable
sevens which the Orientalists find in every <STRONG>MS</STRONG>.
they discover.
<P>
What we have to say finally is this: Enough has been brought forward
to show why the human principles were and are divided in the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 604 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
esoteric schools into seven. Make it <EM>four </EM>and it will
either leave man <EM>minus </EM>his lower terrestrial elements,
or, if viewed from a physical stand-point, make of him a soulless
animal. The Quaternary must be the higher or the lower -- the
celestial or terrestrial Tetraktis: to become comprehensible,
according to the teachings of the esoteric <EM>ancient</EM> school
man must be regarded as a Septenary. This was so well understood,
that even the so-called Christian Gnostics had adopted this time-honoured
system (<EM>Vide </EM>&#167; on &quot;<EM>The Seven Souls</EM>&quot;)<EM>.
</EM>This remained for a long time secret as, though suspected,
no <STRONG>MSS</STRONG>. of that time spoke of it clearly enough
to satisfy the sceptic. But there comes to our rescue the literary
curiosity of our age -- the oldest and best preserved gospel of
the Gnostics, <EM>Pistis Sophia </EM>[[<I>Pictic Cophia</I>]].
To make the proof absolutely complete, we shall quote from an
authority (C. W. King) -- the only archaeologist who had a faint
glimmer of this elaborate doctrine, and the best writer of the
day on the Gnostics and their gems.
<P>
According to this extraordinary piece of religious literature
-- a true Gnostic fossil -- the human Entity is the Septenary
ray from the One,* just as our school teaches. It is composed
of seven elements, four of which are borrowed from the four Kabalistical
manifested worlds. Thus &quot;from Asia it gets the <EM>Nephesh
</EM>or seat of the physical appetites (vital breath, also); from
Jezirah, the Ruach, or seat of the passions (? !); from Briah,
the <EM>Neshamah, </EM>and from Aziluth it obtains the <EM>Chaiah,</EM>
or principle of spiritual life;&quot; (King). &quot;This looks
like an adaptation of the Platonic theory of the Soul's obtaining
its respective faculties from the Planets in its downward progress
through their Spheres. But the <EM>Pistis-Sophia, </EM>with its
accustomed boldness, puts this theory into a much more poetical
shape (&#167; 282).&quot; The <EM>Inner Man </EM>is similarly
made up of <EM>four </EM>constituents, <EM>but these are supplied
by the rebellious AEons of</EM> <EM>the Spheres, </EM>being the
<EM>Power -- </EM>a particle of the Divine light (&quot;<EM>Divinae</EM>
<EM>particula aurae</EM>&quot;)<EM> </EM>yet left in themselves;
the <EM>Soul </EM>(the fifth) &quot;formed out of the tears of
their eyes, and the sweat of their torments; the [[<I>Antimimon
Prieumatos</I>]]<EM>, Counterfeit of the Spirit </EM>(seemingly
answering to our Conscience), (<EM>the sixth</EM>)<EM>; </EM>and
lastly the [[<I>Moira</I>]], <EM>Fate** </EM>(Karmic Ego), whose

* The Seven Centres of Energy evolved, or rendered objective by
the action of Fohat upon the one element; or, in fact, the &quot;<EM>Seventh</EM>
Principle&quot; of the Seven Elements which exist throughout manifested
Kosmos. We may here point out that they are in truth the Sephiroth
of the Kabalists; the &quot;Seven gifts of the Holy Ghost&quot;
in the Christian system; and in a mystical sense, the seven children
or sons of Devaki killed before the birth of Krishna by Kamsa.
Our seven principles symbolize all of these. We have to part or
separate from them before we reach the <EM>Krishna or Christ-state,
</EM>that of a <EM>Jivanmukta</EM>, and centre ourselves entirely
in the highest, the Seventh or the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE.

** [[<I>Moira</I>]] is destiny, not &quot;Fate,&quot; in this
case, as it is an appellation, not a proper noun. (See Wolf's
