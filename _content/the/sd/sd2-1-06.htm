<P>
In the later Commentary, the sentence is translated: --
<P>
&quot;<EM>The Sons of the Sun and of the Moon, the nursling of
ether </EM>(or the wind )<EM> </EM>(<EM>a</EM>) . . . . . . .
<P>
&quot;<EM>They were the shadows of the shadows of the Lords </EM>(<EM>b</EM>)<EM>.
They </EM>(the shadows) <EM>expanded. The Spirits of the Earth
clothed them</EM>;<EM> the solar Lhas warmed them </EM>(<EM>i.e.
</EM>preserved the vital fire in the nascent physical forms).
<EM>The Breaths had life, but had no understanding. They had no
fire nor water of their own </EM>(<EM>c</EM>)<EM>.</EM> 
<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) Remember in this connection the <EM>Tabula Smaragdina
</EM>of Hermes, the esoteric meaning of which has seven keys to
it. The Astro-Chemical is well known to students, the anthropological
may be given now. The &quot;One thing&quot; mentioned in it is
MAN. It is said: &quot;The Father of THAT ONE ONLY THING is the
Sun; its Mother the Moon; the Wind carries it in his bosom, and
its nurse is the Spirituous Earth.&quot; In the occult rendering
of the same it is added: &quot;and <EM>Spiritual </EM>Fire is
its instructor (Guru).&quot;
<P>
This fire is the higher Self, the Spiritual Ego, or that which
is eternally reincarnating under the influence of its lower personal
Selves, changing with every re-birth, full of <EM>Tanha </EM>or
desire to live. It is a strange law of Nature that, on this plane,
the higher (Spiritual) Nature should be, so to say, in bondage
to the lower. Unless the Ego takes refuge in the Atman, the ALL-SPIRIT,
and merges entirely into the essence thereof, the personal Ego
may goad it to the bitter end. This cannot be thoroughly understood
unless the student makes himself familiar with the mystery of
evolution, which proceeds on triple lines -- spiritual, psychic
and physical.
<P>
That which propels towards, and forces evolution, <EM>i.e.</EM>,
compels the growth and development of Man towards perfection,
is (a) the MONAD,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 110 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
or that which acts in it unconsciously through a force inherent
in itself; and (b) the lower astral body or the <EM>personal </EM>SELF.
The former, whether imprisoned in a vegetable or an animal body,
is endowed with, is indeed itself, that force. Owing to its identity
with the ALL-FORCE, which, as said, is inherent in the Monad,
it is all-potent on the <EM>Arupa, </EM>or formless plane. On
our plane, its essence being too pure, it remains all-potential,
but individually becomes inactive: <EM>e.g.</EM>, the rays of
the Sun, which contribute to the growth of vegetation, do not
select this or that plant to shine upon. Uproot the plant and
transfer it to a piece of soil where the sunbeam cannot reach
it, and the latter will not follow it. So with the Atman: unless
the higher Self or EGO gravitates towards its Sun the Monad --
the lower <EM>Ego, </EM>or<EM> personal </EM>Self, will have the
upper hand in every case. For it is this Ego, with its fierce
Selfishness and animal desire to live a Senseless life (<EM>Tanha</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>which is &quot;the maker of the tabernacle,&quot; as Buddha
calls it in <EM>Dhammapada </EM>(153 and 154). Hence the expression,
&quot;the Spirits of the Earth clothed the shadows and expanded
them.&quot; To these &quot;Spirits&quot; belong temporarily the
human astral selves; and it is they who give, or build, the physical
tabernacle of man, for the Monad and its conscious principle,
Manas, to dwell in. But the &quot;Solar&quot; <EM>Lhas, </EM>Spirits,
warm them, the shadows. This is physically and literally true;
metaphysically, or on the psychic and spiritual plane, it is equally
true that the Atman alone <EM>warms </EM>the inner man; <EM>i.e.</EM>,
it enlightens it with the ray of divine life and alone is able
to impart to the inner man, or the reincarnating Ego, its immortality.
Thus, as we shall find, for the first three and a half Root-Races,
up to the middle or turning point, it is the astral shadows of
the &quot;progenitors,&quot; the lunar Pitris, which are the formative
powers in the Races, and which build and gradually force the evolution
of the physical form towards perfection -- this, at the cost of
a proportionate loss of spirituality. Then, from the turning point,
it is the Higher Ego, or incarnating principle, the <EM>nous </EM>or<EM>
Mind, </EM>which reigns over the animal Ego, and rules it whenever
it is not carried down by the latter. In short, Spirituality is
on its ascending arc, and the animal or physical impedes it from
steadily progressing on the path of its evolution only when the
selfishness of the <EM>personality </EM>has so strongly infected
the real <EM>inner </EM>man with its lethal <EM>virus, </EM>that
the upward attraction has lost all its power on the thinking reasonable
man. In sober truth, vice and wickedness are an <EM>abnormal,
unnatural </EM>manifestation, at this period of our human evolution
-- at least they ought to be so. The fact that mankind was never
more selfish and vicious than it is now, civilized nations having
succeeded in making of the first an ethical characteristic, of
the second an art, is an additional proof of the exceptional nature
of the phenomenon.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 111 THE SHELLS OF SHEBA HACHALOTH.</H6>

<P>
The entire scheme is in the &quot;<EM>Chaldean Book of Numbers,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>and even in the <EM>Zohar, </EM>if one only understood the
meaning of the apocalyptic hints. First comes En-Soph, the &quot;Concealed
of the Concealed,&quot; then the <EM>Point, </EM>Sephira and the
later Sephiroth; then the <EM>Atzilatic </EM>World, a <EM>World
of Emanations </EM>that gives birth to three other worlds -- called
the Throne, the abode of pure Spirits; the second, the <EM>World
of Formation, </EM>or<EM> </EM>Jetzira, the habitat of the Angels
who sent forth the Third, or World of Action, the Asiatic <EM>World,
</EM>which is the Earth or <EM>our </EM>World; and yet it is said
of it that this world, also called <EM>Kliphoth, </EM>containing
the (six other) Spheres, [[diagram]], and matter, is the residence
of the &quot;Prince of Darkness.&quot; This is as clearly stated
as can be; for <EM>Metatron, </EM>the Angel of the second or <EM>Briatic
</EM>World, means Messenger [greek char], Angel, called the great
Teacher; and under him are the Angels of the third World, <EM>Jetzira,
</EM>whose ten and seven classes are the <EM>Sephiroth,* </EM>of
whom it is said that &quot;they inhabit and vivify this world
as Essential <EM>Entities</EM> and<EM> Intelligences, </EM>whose<EM>
correlatives</EM> and<EM> contraries </EM>inhabit the third or
<EM>Asiatic World.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>These &quot;Contraries&quot;
are called &quot;the <EM>Shells,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>[[daigam]],
or <EM>demons,** </EM>who inhabit the seven habitations called
<EM>Sheba Hachaloth, </EM>which are simply the seven zones of
our globe. Their prince is called in the Kabala Samael, the Angel
of Death, who is also the seducing serpent Satan; but that Satan
is also Lucifer, the bright angel of Light, the <EM>Light</EM>
and<EM> Life-bringer, </EM>the &quot;Soul&quot; alienated from
the Holy <EM>Ones, </EM>the other angels, and for a period, <EM>anticipating
the time </EM>when they would have descended on Earth to incarnate
in their turn.
<P>
&quot;The <EM>Souls </EM>(Monads) are pre-existent in the world
of Emanations,&quot; (<EM>Book of Wisdom</EM> viii.,<EM> </EM>20);
and the <EM>Zohar </EM>teaches that in the &quot;Soul&quot; &quot;is
the <EM>real man, i.e., </EM>the Ego and the conscious I AM: '<EM>Manas.</EM>'
&quot;
<P>
&quot;They descend from the pure air to be <EM>chained to bodies,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>says Josephus repeating the belief of the Essenes (<EM>De
Bello Judaeo, </EM>11, 12)<EM>. </EM>&quot;The air is full of
Souls,&quot; states Philo, &quot;<EM>they descend to be tied to
mortal bodies, being desirous to live in them.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>De Gignat,</EM> 222 c.;<EM> De Somniis, </EM>p. 455)***;
because through, and in, the human form they will become <EM>progressive
</EM>beings, whereas the nature of the angel is purely <EM>intransitive,
</EM>therefore man has in him the potency of transcending the
faculties of the Angels. Hence the Initiates in India say that
it is the Brahmin, the twice-born, who rules the gods or devas;
and Paul repeated it in
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* See Vol. 1. Part III., &quot;<EM>Gods, Monads and Atoms.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>It is symbolised in the Pythagorean Triangle, the 10 dots
within, and the seven points of the Triangle and the Cube.
<P>
** Whence the Kabalistic name of <EM>Shells </EM>given to the
astral form, the body called <EM>Kama Rupa, </EM>left behind by
the higher angels in the shape of the higher <EM>Manas, </EM>when
the latter leaves for Devachan, forsaking its residue.
<P>
*** Which shows that the Essenes believed in re-birth and many
reincarnations on Earth, as Jesus himself did, a fact we can prove
from the New Testament itself.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 112 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
I<EM> Corinthians </EM>vi.,<EM> </EM>3: &quot;Know ye not that
we (the Initiates) shall judge angels&quot;?
<P>
Finally, it is shown in every ancient scripture and Cosmogony
that man evolved primarily as a <EM>luminous incorporeal form,
</EM>over which, like the molten brass round the clay model of
the sculptor, the physical frame of his body was built by, through,
and from, the lower forms and types of animal terrestrial life.
&quot;The Soul and the <EM>Form </EM>when descending on Earth
put on an earthly garment,&quot; says the <EM>Zohar. </EM>His
protoplastic body was not formed of that matter of which our mortal
frames are fashioned. &quot;When Adam dwelt in the garden of Eden,
he was clothed in the celestial garment, which is the garment
of heavenly light. . . . <EM>light of that light which was used
in the garden of Eden</EM>,&quot; (<EM>Zohar II </EM>229 <EM>B</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>&quot;Man (the heavenly Adam) <EM>was created </EM>by the
ten Sephiroth of the Jetziric world, and by the <EM>common power
</EM>they (the seven angels of a still lower world) <EM>engendered
the earthly Adam </EM>. . . . First Samael fell, and then <EM>deceiving
</EM>(?) man, caused his fall also.&quot;
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>)<EM> </EM>The sentence: &quot;They were the shadows
of the shadows of the Lords,&quot; <EM>i.e.</EM>, the progenitors
created man out of their own astral bodies, explains an universal
belief. The <EM>Devas </EM>are credited in the East with having
no shadows of their own. &quot;The devas cast no shadows,&quot;
and this is the sure sign of a <EM>good holy Spirit.</EM> 
<P>
Why had they &quot;no fire or water of their own&quot;?* Because:
--
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>) That which Hydrogen is to the elements and gases
on the objective plane, its noumenon is in the world of mental
or subjective phenomena; since its trinitarian latent nature is
mirrored in its three
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* It is corroborated, however, as we have shown, by the esotericism
of <EM>Genesis. </EM>Not only are the animals created therein
after the &quot;Adam of Dust,&quot; but vegetation is shown <EM>in
</EM>the Earth before &quot;the heavens and the Earth were created.&quot;
&quot;Every plant of the field before it (the day that the heavens
and the Earth were made, v. 4) was in the Earth&quot; (v. 5).
Now, unless the Occult interpretation is accepted, which shows
that in this 4th Round the Globe was covered with vegetation,
and the first (<EM>astral</EM>)<EM> </EM>humanity was produced
before almost anything could grow and develop thereon, what can
the dead letter mean? Simply that the grass was in the earth of
the Globe before that Globe was created? And yet the meaning of
verse 6, which says that &quot;there went up a mist from the Earth&quot;
and watered the whole face of the Earth before it rained, and
caused the trees, etc., to grow, is plain enough. It shows also
in what geological period it occurred, and further what is meant
by &quot;Heaven and Earth.&quot; It meant the firmament and dry
<EM>incrustated </EM>land, separated and ridden of its vapours
and exhalations. Moreover, the student must bear in mind that,
as Adam Kadmon, &quot;the male and female being&quot; of <EM>Genesis,
ch. </EM>I., is no physical human being but the host of the Elohim,
among which was Jehovah himself -- so the animals mentioned in
that chapter as &quot;created&quot; before man in the dead letter
text, were no animals, but the Zodiacal signs and other sidereal
bodies.<HR>

<P>
active emanations from the three higher principles in man, namely,
&quot;Spirit, Soul, and Mind,&quot; or <EM>Atma, Buddhi, </EM>and<EM>
Manas. </EM>It is the spiritual and also the material human basis.
Rudimentary man, having been nursed by the &quot;air&quot; or
the &quot;wind,&quot; becomes the perfect man later on; when,
with the development of &quot;Spiritual fire,&quot; the <EM>noumenon
</EM>of the &quot;Three in One&quot; within his Self, he acquires
from his inner Self, or Instructor, the Wisdom of Self-Consciousness,
which he does not possess in the beginning. Thus here again divine
Spirit is symbolised by the Sun or Fire; divine Soul by Water
and the Moon, both standing for the Father and Mother of <EM>Pneuma,
</EM>human Soul, or Mind, symbolised by the Wind or air, for <EM>Pneuma,
</EM>means &quot;breath.&quot;
<P>
Hence in the <EM>Smaragdine Tablet, </EM>disfigured by Christian
hands: --
<P>
&quot;The Superior agrees with the Inferior; and the Inferior
with the Superior; to effect that one truly wonderful Work&quot;
-- which is <STRONG>M</STRONG>AN. For the secret work of Chiram,
or King Hiram in the Kabala, &quot;one in Essence, but three in
Aspect,&quot; is the Universal Agent or <EM>Lapis Philosophorum.
</EM>The culmination of the Secret Work is Spiritual Perfect Man,
at one end of the line; the union of the three elements is the
Occult Solvent in the &quot;Soul of the World,&quot; the <EM>Cosmic
</EM>Soul or Astral Light, at the other; and, on the material
plane, it is <EM>Hydrogen </EM>in its relation to the other gases.
The To ON, truly; the ONE &quot;whom no person has seen except
the Son&quot;; this sentence applying both to the metaphysical
and physical Kosmos, and to the spiritual and material Man. For
how could the latter understand the To ON the &quot;One Father,&quot;
if his <EM>Manas, </EM>the &quot;Son,&quot; does not become (<EM>as</EM>)
&quot;One with the Father,&quot; and through this absorption receive
enlightenment from the &quot;divine instructor,&quot; Guru --
<EM>Atma-Buddhi?</EM> 
<P>
&quot;<EM>If thou would</EM>'<EM>st understand the SECONDARY </EM>(&quot;Creation,&quot;
so-called), <EM>oh Lanoo, thou should</EM>'<EM>st first study
its relation to the PRIMARY.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(Commentary,
Book of Dzyan, III. 19.)
<P>
The first Race had three elements, but no <EM>living </EM>Fire.
Why? Because: --
<P>
&quot;We say <EM>four </EM>elements, my Son, but ought to say
three,&quot; says Hermes Trismegistus. &quot;In the Primary Circle&quot;
(creation) that which is marked <IMG SRC="sd2-113.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
reads &quot;Root,&quot; as in the Secondary likewise.

<P>
And these three are all quaternaries completed by their Root,
Fire. The Spirit, beyond manifested Nature, is the fiery BREATH
in its absolute Unity. In the manifested Universe, it is the Central
Spiritual Sun, the electric Fire of all Life. In our System it
is the visible Sun, the Spirit of Nature, the terrestrial god.
And in, on, and around the Earth, the fiery Spirit thereof --
air, fluidic fire; <EM>water</EM>, liquid fire; <EM>Earth, </EM>solid
fire. All is fire -- <EM>ignis, </EM>in its ultimate constitution,
or I, the root of which is O<EM> </EM>(<EM>nought</EM>)<EM> </EM>in
our conceptions, the All in nature and its mind. <EM>Pro-Mater
</EM>is divine fire. It is the Creator, the Destroyer, the Preserver.
The primitive names of the gods are all connected with fire, from
AGNI, the Aryan, to the Jewish god who &quot;is a consuming fire.&quot;
In India, God is called in various dialects, <EM>Eashoor, Esur,
Iswur, </EM>and <EM>Is</EM>'<EM>Vara, </EM>in Sanskrit the Lord,
from <EM>Isa, </EM>but this is primarily the name of Siva, the
Destroyer; and the three Vedic chief gods are Agni (<EM>ignis</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>Vayu, and Surya -- Fire, Air, and the Sun, three occult degrees
of fire. In the Hebrew <IMG SRC="sd2-114a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
(<EM>aza</EM>), means to illuminate, and <IMG SRC="sd2-114b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
(<EM>asha</EM>) is fire. In Occultism, &quot;to kindle a fire&quot;
is synonymous to evoking one of the three great fire-powers, or
&quot;to call on God.&quot; In Sanskrit <EM>Osch </EM>or <EM>Asch
</EM>is fire or heat; and the Egyptian word Osiris is compounded
(as shown by Schelling) of the two primitives <EM>aish</EM> and<EM>
asr, </EM>or a &quot;fireenchanter.&quot; <EM>Aesar </EM>in the
old Etruscan meant a God (being perhaps derived from <EM>Asura
</EM>of the Vedas). <EM>Aeswar </EM>and<EM> Eswara </EM>are analogous
terms, as Dr. Kenealy thought. In the <EM>Bhagavad Gita </EM>we
read, &quot;Iswara resides in every mortal being and puts in motion,
by his supernatural power, all things which mount on the Wheel
of Time.&quot; It is the creator and the destroyer, truly. &quot;The
primitive fire was supposed to have an insatiable appetite for
devouring. Maximus of Tyre relates that the ancient Persians threw
into the fire combustible matter crying: 'Devour, oh Lord!' In
the Irish language <EM>Easam,</EM> or<EM> Asam, </EM>means 'to
create,' and<EM> Aesar </EM>was the name of an ancient Irish god,
meaning 'to light a fire' &quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Kenealy</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>The Christian Kabalists and symbologists who disfigured Pymander
-- prominent among them the Bishop of Ayre, Francois de Tours,
in the 16th century -- divide the elements in this way: --

The first race of men were, then, simply the images, the astral
doubles, of their Fathers, who were the pioneers, or the most
progressed Entities from a preceding though <EM>lower </EM>sphere,
the shell of which is now our Moon. But even this shell is all-potential,
for, having generated the Earth, it is the <EM>phantom </EM>of
the Moon which, attracted by magnetic affinity, sought to form
its first inhabitants, the pre-human monsters, (<EM>vide supra,
</EM>Stanza II.). To assure himself of this, the student has again
to turn to the Chaldean Fragments, and read what Berosus says.
Berosus obtained his information, he tells us, from <EM>Ea</EM>,
the male-female deity of Wisdom. While the gods were generated
in its androgynous bosom (Svabhavat, Mother-space) its (the Wisdom's)
reflections became on Earth the woman Omoroka, who is the Chaldean
Thavatth, or the Greek Thalassa, the Deep or the Sea, which esoterically
and even exoterically is <EM>the Moon. </EM>It was the Moon (Omoroka)
who presided over the monstrous creation of nondescript beings
which were slain by the Dyanis. (<EM>Vide Hibbert Lectures, </EM>p.
370 <EM>et seq.</EM>;<EM> </EM>also in Part II. &quot;Adam-Adami.&quot;)
<P>
Evolutionary law compelled the lunar &quot;Fathers&quot; to pass,
in their monadic condition, through all the forms of life and
being on this globe; but at the end of the Third Round, they were
already human in their divine nature, and were thus called upon
to become the creators of the forms destined to fashion the tabernacles
of the less progressed Monads, whose turn it was to incarnate.
These &quot;Forms&quot; are called &quot;Sons of Yoga,&quot; because
Yoga (union with Brahma exoterically) is the supreme condition
of the passive infinite deity, since it contains all the divine
energies and is the essence of Brahma, who is said (as Brahma)
to create everything through Yoga power. Brahma, Vishnu and Siva
are the most powerful energies of God, Brahma, the Neuter, says

&quot;Study first the <B>ABC </B>of Occult Alchemy.&quot; In their
anxiety, however, to identify Pymander, &quot;the mouth of Mystery,&quot;
with St. John the Baptist prophetically, they thus identified
also the 7 <EM>Kabeiri </EM>and the Assyrian Bulls with the Cherubs
of the Jews and the Apostles. Having, moreover, to draw a line
of demarcation between the <EM>four </EM>and the <EM>three --
</EM>the latter being the <EM>Fallen Angels</EM>;<EM> </EM>and
furthermore to avoid connecting these with the &quot;Seven Spirits
of the Face,&quot; the Archangels, they unceremoniously threw
out all they did not choose to recognise. Hence the perversion
in the order of the Elements, in order to make them dovetail with
the order of the Gospels, and to identify the Angel-Man with Christ.
With the Chaldees, the Egyptians, from whom Moses adopted the
<EM>Chroub </EM>(Cherubs in their animal form), and the Ophites;
with all these, the Angels, the Planets, and the Elements, were
symbolized mystically and alchemically by the <EM>Lion</EM> (Mikael);
the <EM>Bull </EM>(Uriel); the <EM>Dragon </EM>(Raphael); the
<EM>Eagle </EM>(Gabriel); the <EM>Bear</EM> (Thot-Sabaoth); the
<EM>Dog </EM>(Erataoth); the <EM>Mule </EM>(Uriel or Thartharaoth).
All these have a qualificative meaning.<HR>

Puranic text. Yoga here is the same as Dhyana, which word is again
synonymous with Yoga in the Tibetan text, where the &quot;Sons
of Yoga&quot; are called &quot;Sons of Dhyana,&quot; or of that
abstract meditation through which the Dhyani-Buddhas create their
celestial sons, the Dhyani-Bodhisattvas. All the creatures in
the world have each a superior above. &quot;This superior, whose

<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) What will be most contested by scientific authorities
is this a-sexual Race, the Second, the fathers of the &quot;Sweat-born&quot;
so-called, and perhaps still more the Third Race, the &quot;Egg-born&quot;
androgynes. These two modes of procreation are the most difficult
to comprehend, especially for the Western mind. It is evident
that no explanation can be attempted for those who are not students
of Occult metaphysics. European language has no words to express
things which Nature repeats no more at this stage of evolution,
things which therefore can have no meaning for the materialist.
But there are analogies. It is not denied that in the beginning
of physical evolution there must have been processes in Nature,
spontaneous generation, for instance, now extinct, which are repeated
in other forms. Thus we are told that microscopic research shows
no permanence of any particular mode of reproducing life. For
&quot;it shows that the same organism may run through various
metamorphoses in the course of its life-cycle, during some of
which it may be <EM>sexual, </EM>and in others <EM>a-sexual</EM>;<EM>
i.e., </EM>it may reproduce itself alternately by the co-operation
of two beings of opposite sex, and also by fissure or <EM>budding
</EM>from one being only, which is of no sex.&quot;* &quot;Budding&quot;
is the very word used in the Stanza. How could these Chhayas reproduce
themselves otherwise; viz., procreate the Second Race, since they
were ethereal, a-sexual, and even devoid, as yet, of the vehicle
of desire, or Kama Rupa, which evolved only in the Third Race?
They evolved the Second Race unconsciously, as do some plants.
Or, perhaps, as the <EM>Amoeba, </EM>only on a more ethereal,
impressive, and larger scale. If, indeed, the cell-theory applies
equally to Botany and Zoology, and extends to Morphology, as well
as to the Physiology of organisms,

as independent living beings -- just as Occultism regards the
&quot;fiery lives&quot;* -- there is no difficulty in the conception

Consider the first stages of the development of a germ-cell. Its
<EM>nucleus </EM>grows, changes, and forms a double cone or spindle,
thus, <IMG SRC="sd2-117.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <EM>within </EM>the
cell. This spindle approaches the surface of the cell, and one
half of it is <EM>extruded </EM>in the form of what are called
the &quot;<EM>polar cells.</EM>&quot; These polar cells <EM>now
</EM>die, and the embryo develops from the growth and segmentation
of the remaining part of the nucleus which is <EM>nourished </EM>by
the substance of the cell. Then why could not beings have lived
thus, and been created in <EM>this </EM>way -- at the very beginning
of <EM>human and mammalian evolution?</EM> 
<P>
This may, perhaps, serve as an analogy to give some idea of the
process by which the Second Race was formed from the First.

The astral form clothing the Monad was surrounded, as it still
is, by its egg-shaped sphere of <EM>aura, </EM>which here corresponds
to the substance of the germ-cell or <EM>ovum. </EM>The astral
form itself is the nucleus, now, as then, instinct with the principle
of life.
<P>
When the season of reproduction arrives, the <EM>sub-</EM>astral<EM>
</EM>&quot;<EM>extrudes</EM>&quot; a<EM> </EM>miniature of itself
from the egg of surrounding aura. This germ grows and feeds on
the aura till it becomes fully developed, when it gradually separates
from its parent, carrying with it its own sphere of aura; just
as we see living cells reproducing their like by growth and subsequent
division into two.
<P>
The analogy with the &quot;<EM>polar cells</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>would
seem to hold good, since their death would <EM>now </EM>correspond
to the change introduced by the separation of the sexes, when
gestation <EM>in utero, i.e., within the cell, </EM>became the

This passage from the Commentary refers to the work of evolution
from the beginning of a Race to its close. The &quot;Sons of Yoga,&quot;
or the primitive astral race, had seven stages of evolution <EM>racially,
</EM>or collectively; as every individual Being in it had, and
has now. It is not Shakespeare only who divided the ages of man
into a series of seven, but Nature herself. Thus the first sub-races
of the Second Race were born at first by the process described
on the law of analogy; while the last began gradually, <EM>pari
passu </EM>with the evolution of the human body, to be formed
otherwise. The process of reproduction had seven stages also

<P>
Primeval human hermaphrodites are a fact in Nature well known
to the ancients, and form one of Darwin's greatest perplexities.
Yet there is certainly no impossibility, but, on the contrary,
a great probability that hermaphroditism existed in the evolution
of the early races; while on the grounds of analogy, and on that
of the existence of one universal law in physical evolution, acting
indifferently in the construction of plant, animal, and man, it
must be so. The mistaken theories of mono-genesis, and the descent
of man from the mammals instead of the reverse, are fatal to the
completeness of evolution as taught in modern schools on Darwinian
lines, and they will have to be abandoned in view of the insuperable
difficulties which they encounter. Occult tradition -- if the
terms Science and Knowledge are denied in this particular to antiquity
-- can alone reconcile the inconsistencies and fill the gap. &quot;If
thou wilt know the invisible, open thine eye wide on the visible,&quot;
says a Talmudic axiom.
<P>
In the &quot;<EM>Descent of Man</EM>&quot;*<EM> </EM>occurs the
following passage; which shows how near Darwin came to the acceptance
of this ancient teaching.
<P>
&quot;It has been known that in the vertebrate kingdom one sex
bears rudiments of various accessory parts appertaining to the
reproductive system, which properly belong to the opposite sex.
. . . Some remote progenitor of the whole vertebrate kingdom appears
to have been hermaphrodite or androgynous** . . . But here we
encounter a <EM>singular difficulty.</EM> In<EM> the mammalian
class the males possess rudiments of a uterus with the adjacent
passages in the Vesiculae prostaticae</EM>;<EM> they bear also
rudiments of mammae, and some male marsupials have traces of a
marsupial sac. </EM>Other analogous facts could be added. Are
we then to suppose that some extremely ancient mammal continued
androgynous after it had acquired the chief distinctions of its
class, and therefore after it had diverged from the lower classes
of the vertebrate kingdom? This seems very improbable,*** for
<EM>we have to look to fishes, the lowest of all the classes,
to find any still existent androgynous forms.</EM>&quot;
<P>
Mr. Darwin is evidently strongly disinclined to adopt the hypothesis
which the facts so forcibly suggest, viz., that of a primeval
androgynous

<P>
stem from which the mammalia sprang. His explanation runs: --
&quot;The fact that various accessory organs proper to each sex,
are found in a rudimentary condition in the opposite sex may be
explained by such organs having been gradually acquired by the
one sex and then transmitted in a more or less imperfect condition
to the other.&quot; He instances the case of &quot;spurs, plumes,
and brilliant colours, acquired for battle or for ornament by
male birds&quot; and only <EM>partially </EM>inherited by their
female descendants. In the problem to be dealt with, however,
the need of a more satisfactory explanation is evident, the facts
being of so much more prominent and important a character than
the mere superficial details with which they are compared by Darwin.
Why not candidly admit the argument in favour of the hermaphroditism
which characterises the old fauna? Occultism proposes a solution
which embraces the facts in a most comprehensive and simple manner.
These relics of a prior androgyne stock must be placed in the
same category as the pineal gland, and other organs as mysterious,
which afford us silent testimony as to the reality of functions
which have long since become atrophied in the course of animal
and human progress, but which once played a signal part in the
general economy of primeval life.
<P>
The occult doctrine, anyhow, can be advantageously compared with
that of the most liberal men of science, who have theorised upon
the origin of the first man.
<P>
Long before Darwin, Naudin, who gave the name of <EM>Blastema</EM>
to<EM> </EM>that which the Darwinists call protoplasm, put forward
a theory half occult and half scientifico-materialistic. He made
Adam, the <EM>a-sexual, </EM>spring suddenly from the <EM>clay,
</EM>as it is called in the Bible, the <EM>Blastema </EM>of Science.
&quot;It is from this larval form of mankind that the evolutive
force effected the completion of species. For the accomplishment
of this great phenomenon, Adam had to pass through a phase of
immobility and unconsciousness, very analogous to the nymphal
state of animals undergoing metamorphosis,&quot; explains Naudin.
For the eminent botanist, Adam was not one man, however, but <EM>mankind,
</EM>&quot;which remained concealed within a temporary organism
. . . . distinct from all others and never contracting alliance
with any of these.&quot; He shows the differentiation of sexes
accomplished by &quot;a process of germination similar to that
of Medusae and Ascidians.&quot; Mankind, thus constituted physiologically,
&quot;would retain a sufficient evolutive force for the rapid
production of the various great human races.&quot;
<P>
De Quatrefages criticises this position in the &quot;<EM>Human
Species.</EM>&quot; It is <EM>unscientific, </EM>he says, or,
properly speaking, Naudin's ideas &quot;do not form a scientific
theory,&quot; inasmuch as primordial <EM>Blastema </EM>is connected
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 120 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
in his theory with the <EM>First Cause, </EM>which is credited
with having made potentially in the Blastema all past, present,
and future beings, and thus of having in reality <EM>created </EM>these
beings <EM>en masse</EM>;<EM> </EM>moreover, Naudin does not even
consider the <EM>secondary </EM>Causes, or their action in this
evolution of the organic world. Science, which is only occupied
with Secondary Causes, has thus &quot;nothing to say to the theory
of Naudin&quot; (<EM>p</EM>. 125).
<P>
Nor will it have any more to say to the occult teachings, which
are to some extent approached by Naudin. For if we but see in
his &quot;primordial Blastema&quot; the Dhyan-Chohanic essence,
the <EM>Chhaya </EM>or<EM> </EM>double of the <EM>Pitris, </EM>which
contains within itself the potentiality of all forms, we are quite
in accord. But there are two real and vital differences between
our teachings. M. Naudin declares that evolution has progressed
by sudden leaps and bounds, instead of extending slowly over millions
of years; and his primordial Blastema is endowed only with blind
instincts -- a kind of <EM>unconscious </EM>First Cause in the
<EM>manifested Kosmos --</EM> which<EM> </EM>is an absurdity.
Whereas it is our Dhyan Chohanic essence -- the <EM>causality
</EM>of the <EM>primal cause </EM>which creates <EM>physical </EM>man
-- which is the living, active and potential matter, pregnant
<EM>per se </EM>with that animal consciousness of a superior kind,
such as is found in the ant and the beaver, which produces the
long series of physiological differentiations. Apart from this
his &quot;ancient and general process of <EM>creation</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>from <EM>proto-organisms </EM>is as occult as any theory
of Paracelsus or Khunrath could be.
<P>
Moreover, the Kabalistic works are full of the proof of this.
The <EM>Zohar, </EM>for instance, says that every type in the
visible has its prototype in the invisible Universe. &quot;All
that which is in the lower (our) world is found in the upper.
The Lower and the Upper act and react upon each other.&quot; (<EM>Zohar,

<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) The old (primitive) Race merged in the second race,
and became one with it.
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>) This is the mysterious process of transformation
and evolution of mankind. The material of the first forms -- shadowy,
ethereal, and negative -- was drawn or absorbed into, and thus
became the complement of the forms of the Second Race. The <EM>Commentary
</EM>explains this by saying that, as the First Race was simply
composed of the astral shadows of the creative progenitors, having
of course neither astral nor physical bodies of their own -- this
Race <EM>never died. </EM>Its &quot;men&quot; melted gradually
away, becoming absorbed in the bodies of their own &quot;sweat-born&quot;
progeny, more solid than their own. The old form vanished and
was absorbed by, disappeared in, the new form, more human and
physical. There was no death in those days of a period more blissful
than the Golden Age; but the first, or parent material was used
for the formation of the new being, to form the body and even
the inner or <EM>lower </EM>principles or bodies of the progeny.
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>) When the shadow retires, <EM>i.e.</EM> when the astral
body becomes covered with more solid flesh, man develops a physical
body. The &quot;wing,&quot; or the ethereal form that produced
its shadow and image, became the shadow of the astral body and
its own progeny. The expression is queer but original.
<P>
As there may be no occasion to refer to this mystery later, it
is as well to point out at once the dual meaning contained in
the Greek myth bearing upon this particular phase of evolution.
It is found in the several variants of the allegory of Leda and
her two sons Castor and Pollux, which variants have each a special
meaning. Thus in Book <B>XI</B>. of the <EM>Odyssey, </EM>Leda
is spoken of as the spouse of Tyndarus, who gave birth by her
husband &quot;to two sons of valiant heart&quot; -- Castor<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 122 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
and Pollux. Jupiter endows them with a marvellous gift and privilege.
They are semi-immortal; they live and die, each in turn, and every
alternate day; [[<EM>eteremeroi</EM>*]]. As the Tyndaridae, the
twin brothers are an astronomical symbol, and stand for <EM>Day
</EM>and<EM> Night</EM>;<EM> </EM>their two wives, Phoebe and
Hilasira, the daughters of Apollo or the Sun, personifying the
Dawn and the Twilight.** Again, in the allegory where Zeus<EM>
</EM>is shown as the father of the two heroes -- born from the
egg to which Leda gives birth -- the myth is entirely theogonical.
It relates to that group of cosmic allegories in which the world
is described as born from an egg. For Leda assumes in it the shape
of a white swan when uniting herself to the Divine Swan.*** Leda
is the mythical bird, then, to which, in the traditions of various
peoples of the Aryan race, are attributed various ornithological
forms of birds which all lay golden eggs.**** In the <EM>Kalevala
</EM>(the Epic Poem of Finland), the beauteous daughter of the
Ether, &quot;the Water Mother,&quot; creates the world in conjunction
with a &quot;Duck&quot; (another form of the Swan or Goose, Kalahansa),
who lays six golden eggs, and the seventh, &quot;an egg of iron,&quot;
in her lap. But the variant of the Leda allegory which has a direct
reference to mystic man is found in Pindar***** only, with a slighter
reference to it in the Homeric hymns.****** Castor and Pollux
are in it no longer <EM>the Dioscuri </EM>(of<EM> Apollodorus
</EM>III<EM>. </EM>10, 7); but become the highly significant symbol
of the dual man, the Mortal and the Immortal. Not only this, but
as will now be seen, they are also the symbol of the Third Race,
and its transformation from the animal man into a god-man with
only an animal body.
<P>
Pindar shows Leda uniting herself in the same night to her husband
and also to the father of the gods -- Zeus. Thus Castor is the
son of the Mortal, Pollux the progeny of the Immortal. In the
allegory made up for the occasion, it is said that in a riot of
vengeance against the <EM>Apherides******* </EM>Pollux kills Lynceus
-- &quot;of all mortals he whose sight is the most penetrating&quot;
-- but Castor is wounded by <EM>Idas, </EM>&quot;he who sees and
knows.&quot; Zeus puts an end to the fight by hurling his thunderbolt
and killing the last two combatants. Pollux finds his brother
dying.******** In

not die altogether,&quot; answers the master of the Gods; &quot;thou
art of a divine race.&quot; But he gives him the choice: Pollux
will either remain immortal, living eternally in Olympus; or,
if he would share his brother's fate in all things, he must pass
half his existence underground, and the other half in the golden
heavenly abodes. This semi-immortality, which is also to be shared
by Castor, is accepted by Pollux.* <EM>And thus the twin brothers
live alternately, one during the day, and the other during the
night.**</EM> 
<P>
Is this a poetical fiction only? An allegory, one of those &quot;solar
myth&quot; interpretations, higher than which no modern Orientalist
seems able to soar? Indeed, it is much more. Here we have an allusion
to the &quot;Egg-born,&quot; <EM>Third </EM>Race; the first half
of which is mortal, <EM>i.e.</EM>, unconscious in its personality,
and having nothing within itself to survive***; and the latter
half of which becomes immortal in its individuality, by reason
of its fifth principle being called to life by the <EM>informing
gods, </EM>and thus connecting the Monad with this Earth. This
is Pollux; while Castor represents the <EM>personal, </EM>mortal
man, an animal of not even a superior kind, when unlinked from
the divine individuality. &quot;Twins&quot; truly; yet divorced
by death forever, unless Pollux, moved by the voice of twinship,
bestows on his less favoured mortal brother a share of his own
divine nature, thus associating him with his own immortality.
<P>
Such is the occult meaning of the metaphysical aspect of the allegory.
The widely spread modern interpretation of it -- so celebrated
in antiquity, Plutarch tells us,**** as symbolical of brotherly
devotion -- namely, that it was an image borrowed from the spectacle
of Nature -- is weak and inadequate to explain the secret meaning.
Besides the fact that the Moon, with the Greeks, was feminine
in exoteric mythology, and could therefore hardly be regarded
as Castor -- and at the same time be identified with Diana --
ancient symbologists who held the Sun, the King of all sidereal
orbs, as the visible image of the highest deity, would not have
personified it by Pollux, a demi-god only.*****

An impenetrable veil of secrecy was thrown over the occult and
religious mysteries taught, after the submersion of the last remnant
of the Atlantean race, some 12,000 years ago, lest they should
be shared by the unworthy, and so desecrated. Of these sciences
several have now become exoteric -- such as Astronomy, for instance,
in its purely mathematical and physical aspect. Hence their dogmas
and tenets, being all symbolised and left to the sole guardianship
of parable and allegory, have been forgotten, and their meaning
has become perverted. Nevertheless, one finds the hermaphrodite
in the scriptures and traditions of almost every nation; and why
such unanimous agreement if the statement is only a fiction?
<P>
It is this secrecy which led the Fifth Race to the establishment,
or rather the re-establishment of the religious mysteries, in
which ancient truths might be taught to the coming generations
under the veil of allegory and symbolism. Behold the imperishable
witness to the evolution of the human races from the divine, and
especially from the androgynous Race -- the Egyptian Sphinx, that
riddle of the Ages! Divine wisdom incarnating on earth, and forced
to taste of the bitter fruit of personal experience of pain and
suffering, generated under the shade of the tree of the knowledge

called their name Adam&quot; (ch. v. 5). Then it proceeds to say:
&quot;And Adam begat a son in <EM>his own likeness, </EM>after
his image, and called his name Seth&quot; (v. 3); after which
he begets other sons and daughters, thus proving that Cain and
Abel are his own allegorical permutations. Adam stands for the
primitive <EM>human </EM>race, especially in its cosmo-sidereal
sense. Not so, however, in its theo-anthropological meaning. The
compound name of Jehovah, or <EM>Jah-Hovah, </EM>meaning <EM>male
life </EM>and female life -- first androgynous, then separated
into sexes -- is used in this sense in <EM>Genesis </EM>from ch.
v. onwards. As the author of &quot;The Source of Measures&quot;
says (<EM>p. </EM>159): &quot;The two words of which Jehovah is
composed make up the original idea of male-female, as the birth
originators&quot;; for the Hebrew letter <EM>Jod </EM>was the
<EM>membrum virile </EM>and <EM>Hovah </EM>was Eve, the mother
of all living, or the procreatrix, Earth and Nature. The author
believes, therefore, that &quot;It is seen that the <EM>perfect
one</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(the perfect female circle or <EM>Yoni,
</EM>20612<EM>, numerically</EM>)<EM>, </EM>&quot;as<EM> originator
of measures, </EM>takes also the form of <EM>birth</EM>-origin,
as <EM>Hermaphrodite one</EM>;<EM> </EM>hence the phallic form
and use.&quot;
<P>
Precisely; only &quot;the phallic form and use&quot; came long
ages later; and the first and original meaning of Enos, the son
of Seth, was the First <EM>Race </EM>born in the present usual
way from man and woman --for Seth is no man, but a <EM>race. </EM>Before
him humanity was hermaphrodite.

To screen the real mystery name of AIN-SOPH -- the Boundless and

the compound <EM>attribute-</EM>appellation of one of the personal
creative Elohim, whose name was <EM>Yak</EM> and<EM> Jab, </EM>the
letters <EM>i</EM> or <EM>j </EM>or <EM>y </EM>being interchangeable,
or <EM>Jah-Hovah, i.e. male</EM> and<EM> female</EM>;<EM>* Jah-Eve
</EM>an<EM> hermaphrodite, </EM>or the <EM>first form of humanity,
</EM>the original Adam of Earth, not even <EM>Adam Kadmon, </EM>whose
&quot; mind-born son&quot; is the earthly Jah-Hovah, mystically.
And knowing this, the crafty Rabbin-Kabalist has made of it a
name so secret, that he could not divulge it later on without
exposing the whole scheme; and thus he was obliged to make it
<EM>sacred.</EM> 
<P>
How close is the identity between Brahma-Prajapati and Jehovah-Sephiroth,
between Brahma-Viraj and Jehovah-Adam, the Bible and the Puranas
compared can alone show. Analysed and read in the same light,
they afford cogent evidence that they are two copies of the same
original -- made at two periods far distant from each other. Compare
once more in relation to this subject <EM>Genesis </EM>ch. 4.
verses 1 and 26 and <EM>Manu </EM>I., and they will both yield
their meaning. In <EM>Manu </EM>(<EM>Book </EM>I.<EM> </EM>32)
Brahma, who is also both man and god, and divides his body into
male and female, stands in his esoteric meaning, as does Jehovah
or Adam in the Bible, for the symbolical personification of creative
and <EM>generative </EM>power, both divine and human. The Zohar
affords still more convincing proof of identity, while some Rabbins
repeat word for word certain original Puranic expressions; <EM>e.g.</EM>,
the &quot;creation&quot; of the world is generally considered
in the Brahmanical books to be the Lila, delight or sport, the
amusement of the Supreme Creator, &quot;Vishnu being thus discrete
and indiscrete substance, spirit, and time, sports like a playful
boy in frolics.&quot; (Vishnu Purana, Book I., ch. ii.) Now compare
this with what is said in the Book, &quot;Nobeleth' Hokhmah&quot;:
&quot;The Kabalists say that the entering into existence of the
worlds happens through <EM>delight</EM>, in that Ain-Soph (? !)<EM>
rejoiced </EM>in Itself, and flashed and beamed from Itself to
Itself . . . . which are all called delight,&quot; etc. (Quoted
in <EM>Myer</EM>'<EM>s </EM>&quot;<EM>Qabbalah,</EM>&quot; p<EM>.
</EM>110). Thus it is not a &quot;curious idea of the Qabbalists,&quot;
as the author just quoted remarks, but a purely Puranic, Aryan
idea. Only, why make of Ain-Soph a Creator?
<P>
The &quot;Divine Hermaphrodite&quot; is then Brahma-Vach-Viraj;
and that of the Semites, or rather of the Jews, is Jehovah-Cain-Abel.

<P>
later Israelites and Rabbis, who undeniably knew the real meaning
of their exoteric deity. The Jews regard the name given to them
-- the Yah-oudi -- as an insult. Yet they have, or would have
if they only wished it, as undeniable a right to call themselves
the ancient Yah-oudi, &quot;Jah-hovians,&quot; as the Brahmins
have to call themselves Brahmins, <EM>after their national deity.
</EM>For Jah-hovah is the generic name of that group or hierarchy
of creative planetary angels, under whose star their nation has
evolved. He is one of the planetary <EM>Elohim </EM>of the regent
group of Saturn. Verse 26 of <EM>Genesis, </EM>ch. iv., when read
correctly, would alone give them such a right, for it calls the
new race of men sprung from <EM>Seth</EM> and Enos, <EM>Jehovah,
</EM>something quite different from the translation adopted in
the Bible: -- &quot;To him also, was born a son, Enos; then began
men to call themselves Jah or Yah-hovah,&quot; to with <EM>men
and women, </EM>the &quot;lords of creation.&quot; One has but
to read the above-mentioned verse in the original Hebrew text
and by the light of the Kabala, to find that, instead of the words
as they now stand translated, it is: -- &quot;Then began men to
<EM>call themselves Jehovah,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>which is the
correct translation, and not &quot;Then began men to call upon
the name of the Lord&quot;; the latter being a mistranslation,
whether deliberate or not. Again the well-known passage: &quot;I
have gotten a man from the Lord,&quot; should read: &quot;I have
gotten a man, even Jehovah.&quot;* Luther translated the passage
one way, the Roman Catholics quite differently. Bishop Wordsworth
renders it: &quot;Cain -- <EM>I have gotten </EM>Kain, from <EM>Kanithi,</EM>
I<EM> </EM>have gotten.&quot; Luther: &quot;I have gotten a man
0-- even the Lord&quot; (Jehovah); and the author of &quot;The
Source of Measures&quot;: &quot;I have <EM>measured a man, </EM>even<EM>
Jehovah</EM>.&quot;<EM> </EM>The last is the correct rendering,
because (<EM>a</EM>) a famous Rabbin, a Kabalist, explained the
passage to the writer in precisely this way, and (<EM>b</EM>)
because this rendering is identical with that in the Secret Doctrine
of the East with regard to Brahma. In &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled,</EM>&quot;<EM>**
</EM>it was explained by the writer that &quot;Cain . . . is the
son of the 'Lord' not of Adam (<EM>Genesis </EM>iv<EM>. </EM>I)&quot;
The &quot;Lord&quot; is Adam Kadmon, the &quot;father&quot; of
<EM>Yodcheva, </EM>&quot;Adam-Eve,&quot; or Jehovah, the son of
sinful thought, not the progeny of flesh and blood. Seth, on the
other hand, is the <EM>leader and the progenitor of the Races
of the Earth</EM>;<EM> </EM>for he is the son of Adam, exoterically,
but esoterically he is the progeny of Cain and Abel, since Abel
or Hebel is a female, the counterpart and female half of the male
Cain, and Adam is the collective name for man and woman: &quot;male
and female (<EM>Zachar va Nakobeh</EM>)<EM> </EM>created he them
. . . and called <EM>their</EM> name Adam.&quot; The verses in
<EM>Genesis </EM>from chs. i. to v., are purposely mixed up for
Kabalistic reasons. After MAN of

<EM>Genesis </EM>ch. i. 26 and <EM>Enos, </EM>Son of Man of ch.
iv. <EM>v. </EM>26, after Adam, the first androgyne, after Adam
Kadmon, the sexless (the first) <EM>Logos, </EM>Adam and Eve once
separated, come finally Jehovah-Eve and Cain-Jehovah. These represent
distinct Root-Races, for millions of years elapsed between them.
<P>
Hence the Aryan and the Semitic Theo-anthropographies are two
leaves on the same stem; their respective personifications and
symbolic personages standing in relation to each other in this
way.
<P>
I. The <EM>Unknowable, </EM>referred to in various ways in <EM>Rig
Vedic </EM>verse, such as &quot;<EM>Nought </EM>Was,&quot; called,
later on &quot;Parabrahm;&quot; the <IMG SRC="sd1-353b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
(<EM>Ain, </EM>nothing, or the &quot;Ain-Soph&quot; of the Kabalists),
and again, the &quot;Spirit&quot; (of God) that moves upon the
face of the waters, in <EM>Genesis. </EM>All these are <EM>identical.
</EM>Moreover, in <EM>Genesis, </EM>ch. i., v. 2, is placed as
verse 1 in <EM>the secret </EM>Kabalistic texts, where it is followed
by the <EM>Elohim </EM>&quot;creating the Heaven and the Earth.&quot;
This deliberate shifting of the order of the verses was necessary
for <EM>monotheistic </EM>and Kabalistic purposes. Jeremiah's
curse against those Elohim (gods) who <EM>have not created </EM>the
Heavens and the Earth, ch. x., <EM>v. </EM>11, shows that there
were other Elohim who had.
<P>
II. The &quot;Heavenly&quot; <EM>Manu-Swayambhuva, </EM>who sprang
from Swayambhu-Narayana, the &quot;Self-existent,&quot; and Adam
Kadmon of the Kabalists, and the androgyne MAN of <EM>Genesis
ch. </EM>1 are also identical.
<P>
III. Manu-swayambhuva is Brahma, or the Logos; and he is Adam
Kadmon, who in Genesis iv., 5, separates himself into two halves,
male and female, thus becoming Jah-Hovah or Jehovah-Eve; as Manu
Swayambhuva or Brahma separates himself to become &quot;Brahma-Viraj
and Vach-Viraj,&quot; male and female; all the rest of the texts
and versions being <EM>blinds.</EM> 
<P>
IV. Vach is the daughter of Brahma and is named <EM>Sata-Rupa,
</EM>&quot;the<EM> </EM>hundred-formed,&quot; and <EM>Savitri,
</EM>&quot;<EM>generatrix,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>the mother of the
gods and of all living. She is identical with Eve, &quot;the mother
(of all the lords or gods or) of all living.&quot; Besides this
there are many other occult meanings.
<P>
What is written in &quot;<EM>Isis,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>although
scattered about and very cautiously expressed at the time, is
correct:
<P>
Explaining esoterically Ezekiel's wheel,* it is said of <EM>Jodhevah
</EM>or Jehovah: -
<P>
&quot;When the ternary is taken in the beginning of the Tetragram,
it expresses the divine creation <EM>spiritually, </EM>without
any carnal sin; taken at its opposite end it expresses the latter:
it is feminine. The name of Eva is composed of three letters,
that of the primitive or heavenly

<P>
Adam, is written with one letter, Jod or Yodh; therefore it must
not be read Jehovah but Ieva, or Eve. The Adam of the first chapter
is the spiritual, therefore pure, androgyne Adam Kadmon. When
woman issues from the rib of the second Adam (of dust), the pure
<EM>Virgo </EM>is<EM> </EM>separated, and falling &quot;into generation,&quot;
or the downward cycle, becomes <EM>Scorpio, </EM>emblem of sin
and matter. While the ascending cycle points to the purely spiritual
races, or the ten prediluvian patriarchs, the Prajapatis and Sephiroth
are led on by the creative Deity itself, who is Adam Kadmon or
Yod-cheva. Spiritually, the lower one (Jehovah) is that of the
terrestrial races, led on by Enoch or <EM>Libra, </EM>the seventh;
who, because he is half-divine, half-terrestrial, is said to have
been taken by God alive. Enoch, Hermes, and Libra, are one.&quot;
<P>
This is only one of the several meanings. No need to remind the
scholar that <EM>Scorpio </EM>is<EM> </EM>the astrological sign
of the organs of reproduction. Like the Indian Rishis, the Patriarchs
are all convertible in their numbers, as well as interchangeable.
According to the subject to which they relate they become ten,
twelve, seven or five, and even <EM>fourteen, </EM>and they have
the same esoteric meaning as the <EM>Manus </EM>or Rishis.
<P>
Moreover, Jehovah, as may be shown, has a variety of etymologies,
but only those are true which are found in the Kabala. <IMG SRC="sd1-355b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
(<EM>Ieve</EM>)<EM> </EM>is the Old Testament term, and was pronounced
Ya-<EM>va</EM>. Inman suggests that it is contracted from the
two words <IMG SRC="sd2-129a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <EM>Yaho-Iah,
Jaho-Jah, </EM>or <EM>Jaho is Jah. </EM>Punctuated it is <IMG SRC="sd2-129b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
which is, however, a Rabbinical caprice to associate it with the
name <EM>Adoni </EM>or <IMG SRC="sd2-129c.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,
which has the same points. It is curious, and indeed hardly conceivable,
that the Jews anciently read the name <IMG SRC="sd2-129d.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
(<EM>Adoni</EM>)<EM>, </EM>when they had so many names of which
<EM>Jeho </EM>and <EM>Jah </EM>and Iah constituted a part. But
so it was; and Philo Byblus, who gives us the so-called fragment
of Sanchoniathon, spelt it in Greek letters [[<EM>IEUO</EM>]],
<EM>Javo </EM>or <EM>Jevo. </EM>Theodoret says that the Samaritans
pronounced <EM>Yahva, </EM>and the Jews <EM>Yaho. </EM>Prof<EM>.
</EM>Gibbs, however, suggests its punctuation thus: <IMG SRC="sd2-129e.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
(<EM>Ye-hou-vih</EM>);<EM> </EM>and he cut the Gordian knot of
its true occult meaning. For in this last form, as a Hebrew verb,
it means &quot;he will -- be.&quot;* It was also derived from
the Chaldaic verb <IMG SRC="sd2-129f.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> or 
<IMG SRC="sd2-129g.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><EM> eue </EM>(<EM>eva</EM>)
or<EM> eua </EM>(<EM>Eva</EM>)<EM> </EM>&quot;to be.&quot; And
so it was, since from Enosh, the &quot;Son of Man,&quot; only,
were the truly human races to begin and &quot;to be,&quot; as
males and females. This statement receives further corroboration,
inasmuch as Parkhurst makes the verb <IMG SRC="sd2-129h.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
to mean: (1) &quot;To

and the same as Hebe, the Grecian goddess of youth and the Olympian
bride of Heracles, makes the name Jehovah appear still more clearly
in its primitive double-sexed form.

Finding in Sanskrit such syllables as <EM>Jah</EM> and <EM>Yah,
e.g., Jah </EM>(<EM>navi</EM>)<EM> </EM>&quot;Ganges&quot; and
<EM>Jagan-natha, </EM>&quot;Lord of the World,&quot; it becomes
clear why Mr. Rawlinson is so very confident in his works of an
<EM>Aryan</EM> or <EM>Vedic </EM>influence on the early mythology
of Babylon. Nor is it to be much wondered at that the alleged
ten tribes of Israel disappeared during the captivity period,
without leaving a trace behind them, when we are informed that
the Jews had <EM>de facto </EM>but two tribes -- those of J<EM>udah
</EM>and of <EM>Levi. </EM>The <EM>Levies, </EM>moreover, were
not a tribe at all, but a priestly caste. The descendants have
only followed their progenitors, the various patriarchs, into
thin, sidereal air. There were <EM>Brahms </EM>and <EM>A-brahms,
</EM>in days of old, truly, and before the first Jew had been
born. Every nation held its first god and gods to be androgynous;
nor could it be otherwise, since they regarded their distant primeval
progenitors, their dual-sexed ancestors, as divine Beings and
Gods, just as do the Chinese to this day. And they were divine
in one sense, as also were their first human progeny, the &quot;mind-born&quot;
primitive humanity, which were most assuredly bi-sexuals as all
the more ancient symbols and traditions show. Under the emblematical
devices and peculiar phraseology of the priesthood of old, lie
latent hints of sciences as yet undiscovered during the present
cycle. Well acquainted as may be a scholar with the hieratic writing
and hieroglyphical system of the Egyptians, he must first of all
learn to sift their records. He has to assure himself, compasses
and rule in hand, that the picture writing he is examining fits,
to a line, <EM>certain fixed geometrical figures </EM>which are
the hidden keys to such records, before he ventures on an interpretation.&quot;
<P>
&quot;But there are myths which speak for themselves. In this
class we may include the double-sexed first creators of every
Cosmogony. The Greek Zeus-Zen (AEther), and Chthonia (the chaotic
earth) and Metis (water), his wives; Osiris and Isis-Latona --
the former god also representing AEther, the first emanation of
the Supreme Deity, Amun, the primeval source of Light; the goddess
Earth and Water again; Mithras, the rock-born god, the symbol
of the male mundane fire, or the personified primordial light,
and Mithra, the fire goddess, at once his mother and his wife;
the pure element of fire (the active, or male principle) regarded
as light and heat, in conjunction with Earth and Water, or Matter,
the female or passive element of cosmical generation&quot; --
all these are records of the primeval divine Hermaphrodite.<HR>
