THE FOUR ELEMENTS.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>M</STRONG>ETAPHYSICALLY and esoterically there is but
One <B>E</B>LEMENT in nature, and at the root of it is the Deity;
and the so-called <EM>seven </EM>elements, of which five have
already manifested and asserted their existence, are the garment,
<EM>the veil</EM>,<EM> of that deity; </EM>direct from the essence
whereof comes <STRONG>M</STRONG>AN, whether physically, psychically,
mentally or spiritually considered. Four elements only are generally
spoken of in later antiquity, five admitted only in philosophy.
For the body of ether is not fully manifested yet, and its noumenon
is still &quot;the Omnipotent Father -- AEther, the synthesis
of the rest.&quot; But what are these &quot;<B>E</B>LEMENTS&quot;
whose compound bodies have now been discovered by Chemistry and
Physics to contain numberless sub-elements, even the sixty or
seventy of which no longer embrace the whole number suspected.
(Vide <EM>Addenda</EM>,<EM> </EM>&#167;&#167;<EM> </EM><B>XI.</B>
and <B>XII</B>., quotations from Mr. Crookes' Lectures.) Let us
follow their evolution from the <EM>historical </EM>beginnings,
at any rate.
<P>
The four Elements were fully characterized by Plato when he said
that they were <EM>that </EM>&quot;which<EM> composes </EM>and<EM>
decomposes </EM>the<EM> compound bodies.</EM>&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 461 ON THE ELEMENTS.</H6>

<P>
Hence Cosmolatry was never, even in its worst aspect, the fetishism
which adores or worships the passive external form and matter
of any object, but looked ever to the <EM>noumenon </EM>therein.
Fire, Air, Water, Earth, were but the visible garb, the symbols
of the informing, invisible Souls or Spirits -- the Cosmic gods
to whom worship was offered by the ignorant, and simple, respectful
recognition by the wiser. In their turn the <EM>phenomenal </EM>subdivisions
of the noumenal Elements were informed by the Elementals, so called,
the &quot;Nature Spirits&quot; of lower grades.
<P>
In the <EM>Theogony </EM>of Mochus, we find Ether first, and then
the air; the two principles from which Ulom the <EM>intelligible
</EM>([[<EM>noetos</EM>]]) God (the visible universe of matter)
is born.*
<P>
In the Orphic hymns, the Eros-Phanes evolves from the Spiritual
Egg, which the AEthereal winds impregnate, Wind being &quot;the
Spirit of God,&quot; who is said to move in AEther, &quot;brooding
over the chaos&quot; -- the Divine &quot;Idea.&quot; In the Hindu
<EM>Katakopanisad</EM>,<EM> </EM>Purusha, the Divine Spirit, already
stands before the original matter, from whose union springs the
great Soul of the World, &quot;Maha = Atma, Brahm, the Spirit
of Life;&quot;** these latter appellations being again identical
with the Universal Soul, or <EM>Anima Mundi</EM>,<EM> </EM>the
Astral Light of the Theurgists and Kabalists, being its last and
lowest division.&quot;
<P>
The [[<EM>stoicheia</EM>]] (Elements) of Plato and Aristotle,
were thus the <EM>incorporeal principles </EM>attached to the
four great divisions of our Cosmic World, and it is with justice
that Creuzer defines those primitive beliefs . . . <EM>as a species
of magism</EM>,<EM> a psychic paganism</EM>,<EM> </EM>and a <EM>deification
of potencies</EM>;<EM> </EM>a spiritualization which placed the
believers in a close community with these potencies,&quot; (Book
IX, p. 850). So close, indeed, that the hierarchies of those potencies
or Forces have been classified on a graduated scale of seven from
the ponderable to the imponderable. They are Septenary, -- not
as an artificial aid to facilitate their comprehension -- but
in their real <EM>Cosmic </EM>gradation, from their chemical (or
physical) to their purely spiritual composition. <EM>Gods</EM>
--<EM> </EM>with the ignorant masses -- gods independent and supreme;
daemons with the fanatics, who, intellectual as they often may
be, are unable to understand the Spirit of the philosophical sentence,
<EM>in pluribus unum. </EM>With the hermetic philosopher they
are FORCES <EM>relatively </EM>&quot;<EM>blind</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>or<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>intelligent</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>according
to which of the principles in them he deals with. It required
long millenniums before they found themselves, in our cultured
age, finally degraded into simple chemical elements.
<P>
At any rate, good Christians, and especially the Biblical Protestants,

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 462 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
ought to show more reverence for the four Elements, if they would
show any for Moses. For the Bible manifests the consideration
and mystic significance in which they were held by the Hebrew
Lawgiver, on every page of the Pentateuch. The tent which contained
the Holy of Holies &quot; was a Cosmic Symbol, sacred, in one
of its meanings, to the Elements, the four cardinal points, and
<STRONG>E</STRONG>THER. Josephus shows it built in white, the
colour of Ether. And this explains also why, in the Egyptian and
the Hebrew temples -- according to Clemens Alexandrinus -- a gigantic
curtain, supported by five pillars, separated the <EM>sanctum
sanctorum </EM>(now represented by the altar in Christian churches)
wherein the priests alone were permitted to enter, from the part
accessible to the profane. By its <EM>four </EM>colours the curtain
symbolized the four principal Elements, and signified the knowledge
of the divine that the <EM>five</EM> senses of men can enable
man to acquire with the help of the <EM>four </EM>Elements. (See
<EM>Stromata </EM>I., v. &#167; 6).
<P>
In Cory's <EM>Ancient Fragments</EM>,<EM> </EM>one of the &quot;Chaldean
Oracles&quot; expresses ideas about the elements and Ether in
language singularly like that of the <EM>Unseen Universe</EM>,<EM>
</EM>written by two eminent scientists of our day.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It states that &quot;from ether have come all things, and to it
all will return; that the images of all things are indelibly impressed
upon it; and that it is the store-house of the germs or of the
remains of all visible forms, and even ideas. It appears as if
this case strangely corroborates our assertion that whatever discoveries
may be made in our days will be found to have been anticipated
by many thousand years by our 'simple-minded ancestors.' &quot;
-- (<I>Isis Unveiled.</I>)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Whence came the four elements and the <EM>malachim </EM>of the
Hebrews? They have been made to merge, by a theological sleight-of-hand
on the part of the Rabbins and the later Fathers of the Church
into Jehovah, but their origin is identical with that of the Cosmic
gods of all other nations. Their symbols, whether born on the
shores of the Oxus, on the burning sands of Upper Egypt, or in
the wild forests, weird and glacial, which cover the slopes and
peaks of the sacred snowy mountains of Thessaly, or again, in
the <EM>pampas </EM>of America, their symbols, we repeat, when
traced to their source, are ever one and the same. Whether Egyptian
or Pelasgian, Aryan or Semitic, the <EM>genius loci</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the local god, embraced in its unity all nature; but not
especially the four elements any more than one of their creations,
such as trees, rivers, mounts or stars. The <EM>genius loci</EM>
--<EM> </EM>a very late after-thought of the last sub-races of
the Fifth Root-race, when the primitive and grandiose meaning
had become nearly lost -- was ever the representative in his accumulated
titles of all his colleagues. It was the god of <EM>fire</EM>,
symbolised by thunder, as Jove or Agni; the god of <EM>water</EM>,<EM>
</EM>symbolised by the fluvial bull or some sacred river or fountain,
as Varuna, Neptune, etc.; the god of <EM>air</EM>, manifesting
in the hurricane and tempest, as Vayu and Indra; and the god or
spirit<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 463 THE COSMIC GODS.</H6>

<P>
of the earth, who appeared in earthquakes, like Pluto, Yama, and
so many others.
<P>
These were the Cosmic gods, ever synthesizing all in one, as found
in every cosmogony or mythology. Thus, the Greeks had their Dodonean
Jupiter, who included in himself the four elements and the four
cardinal points, and who was recognized, therefore, in old Rome
under the pantheistic title of <EM>Jupiter Mundus</EM>;<EM> </EM>and
who now, in modern Rome, has become the <EM>Deus Mundus</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the one mundane god, who is made to swallow all others in
the latest theology -- by the arbitrary decision of his special
ministers.
<P>
As gods of Fire, Air, Water, they were <EM>celestial </EM>gods;
as gods of the <EM>lower region</EM>,<EM> </EM>they were <EM>infernal
</EM>deities: the latter adjective applying simply <EM>to the
Earth. </EM>They were &quot;Spirits of the Earth&quot; under their
respective names of Yama, Pluto, Osiris, the &quot;Lord of the
lower kingdom, etc., etc.,&quot; and their tellurial character
proves it sufficiently.* The ancients knew of no worse abode after
death than the <EM>Kamaloka</EM>,<EM> </EM>the<EM> limbus </EM>on
this Earth. If it is argued that the Dodonean Jupiter was identified
with Aidoneus, the king of the subterranean world, and <EM>Dis</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or the Roman Pluto and the Dionysius Chthonios, the subterranean,
wherein, according to Creuzer (I, vi., ch. 1), oracles were rendered,
then it will become the pleasure of the Occultists to prove that
both Aidoneus and Dionysius are the bases of Adonai, or &quot;Jurbo
Adonai,&quot; as Jehovah is called in Codex Nazaraeus. &quot;Thou
shalt not worship the Sun, who is named Adonai, whose name is
also <EM>Kadush </EM>and El-El&quot; (<EM>Cod. Naz.</EM>,<EM>
</EM>I, 47; see also Psalm lxxxix., 18), and also &quot;Lord Bacchus.&quot;
Baal-Adonis of the <EM>Sods </EM>or Mysteries of the pre-Babylonian
Jews became the Adonai by the Massorah, the later-vowelled Jehovah.
Hence the Roman Catholics are right. All these Jupiters are of
the same family; but Jehovah has to be included therein to make
it complete. Jupiter-<EM>Aerios </EM>or<EM> Pan</EM>,<EM> </EM>the
Jupiter Ammon, and the Jupiter-Bel-Moloch, are all correlations
and one with Yurbo-Adonai, because they are all one cosmic nature.
It is that nature and power which create the specific terrestrial
symbol, and the physical and material fabric of the latter, which
proves the Energy manifesting through it as <EM>extrinsic.</EM>

<P>
For primitive religion was something better than simple pre-occupation
about physical phenomena, as remarked by Schilling; and principles,
more elevated than we modern Sadducees know of, &quot;were hidden
under the transparent veil of such merely natural divinities as
thunder,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The<EM> Gehenna </EM>of the Bible was a valley near Jerusalem,
where the monotheistic Jews immolated their children to Moloch,
if the prophet Jeremiah is to be believed on his word. The Scandinavian
<EM>Hel</EM> or <EM>Hela</EM> was a frigid region -- again Kamaloka
-- and the Egyptian Amenti a place of purification. (See <EM>Isis
Unveiled</EM>,<EM> </EM>Vol. II., p. 11.)<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 464 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
the winds, and rain.&quot; The ancients knew and could distinguish
the <EM>corporeal </EM>from the <EM>spiritual </EM>elements, in
the forces of nature.
<P>
The four-fold Jupiter, as the four-faced Brahma -- the aerial,
the fulgurant, the terrestrial, and the marine god -- the lord
and master of the four elements, may stand as a representative
for the great Cosmic gods of every nation. While passing power
over the fire to Hephaistos-Vulcan, over the sea, to Poseidon-Neptune,
and over the Earth, to Pluto-Aidoneus -- the AERIAL Jove was all
these; for <STRONG>AE</STRONG>THER, from the first, had pre-eminence
over, and was the synthesis of, all the elements.
<P>
Tradition points to a grotto, a vast cave in the deserts of Central
Asia, whereinto light pours through its four seemingly natural
apertures or clefts placed crossways at the four cardinal points
of the place. From noon till an hour before sunset that light
streams in, of four different colours, as averred -- red, blue,
orange-gold, and white -- owing to some either natural or artificially
prepared conditions of vegetation and soil. The light converges
in the centre around a pillar of white marble with a globe upon
it, which represents our earth. It is named the &quot;grotto of
Zaratushta.&quot;
<P>
When included under the arts and sciences of the fourth race,
the Atlanteans, the phenomenal manifestation of the four elements,
justly attributed by the believers in Cosmic gods to the intelligent
interference of the latter, assumed a scientific character. The
<EM>magic </EM>of the ancient priests consisted, in those days,
in addressing <EM>their gods in their own language. </EM>&quot;The
speech of the men of the earth cannot reach the Lords. Each must
be addressed in the language of his respective element&quot; --
is a sentence which will be shown pregnant with meaning. &quot;<EM>The
Book of Rules</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>cited adds as an explanation
of the nature of that <EM>Element</EM>-language: &quot;It is composed
of <EM>sounds</EM>,<EM> </EM>not words; of sounds, numbers and
figures. He who knows how to blend the three, will call forth
the response of the superintending Power&quot; (the regent-god
of the specific element needed).
<P>
Thus this &quot;language&quot; is that of <EM>incantations </EM>or
of <STRONG>M</STRONG>ANTRAS, as they are called in India, sound
being <EM>the most potent and effectual magic agent</EM>,<EM>
and the first of the keys which opens the door of communication
between Mortals and the Immortals. </EM>He who believes in the
words and teachings of St. Paul, has no right to pick out from
the latter those sentences only that he chooses to accept, to
the rejection of others; and St. Paul teaches most undeniably
the existence of cosmic gods and their presence among us. Paganism
preached a dual and simultaneous evolution: &quot;creation&quot;
-- &quot;<EM>spiritualem ac mundanum</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>as the
Roman Church has it -- ages before the advent of that Roman Church.
Exoteric phraseology has changed little with respect to divine
hierarchies since the most palmy days of Paganism, or &quot;Idolatry.&quot;
Names alone have changed,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 465 A CONFESSION OF SCIENCE.</H6>

<P>
along with claims which have now become false pretences. For when
Plato put in the mouth of the Highest Principle -- &quot;Father
AEther&quot; or Jupiter -- these words, for instance: &quot;The
gods of the gods of whom I am the <EM>maker </EM>(<EM>opifex</EM>)<EM>
</EM>as<EM> </EM>I am the father of all their works (<EM>operumque
parens</EM>)&quot;; he knew the spirit of this sentence as fully,
we suspect, as St. Paul did, when saying: &quot;For though there
be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there
be gods many and lords many,&quot; . . . . etc. (1 Cor. viii.
5.)* Both knew the sense and the meaning of what they put forward
in such guarded terms.
<P>
Says Sir W. Grove, <B>F.R.S</B>., speaking of the correlation
of forces, &quot;The ancients when they witnessed a natural phenomenon,
removed from ordinary analogies, and unexplained by any mechanical
action known to them, referred it to a soul, a spiritual or preternatural
power. . . . Air and gases were also at first deemed spiritual,
but subsequently they became invested with a more material character;
and the same words [[<EM>pneuma</EM>]], spirit, etc., were used
to signify the soul or a gas; the very word gas, from <EM>geist</EM>,<EM>
</EM>a ghost or spirit, affords us an instance of the gradual
transmutation of a spiritual into a physical conception . . .
. . .&quot; (P. 89.) This, the great man of science (in his preface
to the fifth edition of &quot;Correlation of Physical Forces&quot;)
considers as the <EM>only </EM>concern of exact science, which
has no business to meddle with the CAUSES. &quot;Cause and effect,&quot;
he explains, &quot;are therefore, in their abstract relation to
these forces, words solely of convenience. We are totally unacquainted
<EM>with the ultimate generating power </EM>of each and all of
them, and probably shall ever remain so; we can only ascertain
the norma of their actions; we must humbly refer their causation
to one omnipresent influence, and content ourselves with studying
their effects and developing, by experiment, their mutual relations&quot;
(p. xiv.).
<P>
This policy once accepted, and the system virtually admitted in
the above-quoted words, namely, the <EM>spirituality </EM>of the
&quot;ultimate generating power,&quot; it would be more than illogical
to refuse to recognise this quality which is inherent in the <EM>material
elements</EM>,<EM> </EM>or rather, in their com-
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* We cannot be taken to task by the Protestants for interpreting
the verse from the <EM>Corinthians </EM>as we do; for, if the
translation in the English Bible is made ambiguous, it is not
so in the original texts, and the Roman Catholic Church accepts
the words of the Apostle in their true sense. For a proof see
the <EM>Commentaries on St. Paul</EM>'<EM>s Epistles</EM>,<EM>
</EM>by St. John Chrysostom &quot;<EM>directly inspired </EM>by
the Apostle,&quot; and &quot;who wrote under his dictation,&quot;
as we are assured by the Marquis de Mirville, whose works are
approved by Rome. And St. Chrysostom says, commenting on that
special verse, &quot;And, though there are (in fact) they who
are called gods . . . . -- for it seems, there are really <EM>several
gods</EM> --<EM> </EM>withal, and for all that, the God-<EM>principle
</EM>and the Superior God ceasing to remain essentially <EM>one</EM>
and indivisible.&quot; . . . Thus spoke the old Initiates also,
knowing that the worship of minor gods could never affect the
&quot;God <EM>Principle</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(See<EM> </EM>de Mirville,
&quot;<EM>Des Esprits</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>vol. ii., 322)<EM>.</EM>

<P>
pounds -- as present in the fire, air, water or earth. The ancients
knew these powers so well, that, while concealing their true nature
under various allegories, for the benefit (or to the detriment)
of the uneducated rabble, they never departed from the multiple
object in view, while inverting them. They contrived to throw
a thick veil over the nucleus of truth concealed by the symbol,
but they ever tried to preserve the latter as a <EM>record </EM>for
future generations, sufficiently transparent to allow their wise
men to discern that truth behind the fabulous form of the glyph
or allegory. They are accused of <EM>superstition </EM>and<EM>
credulity</EM>,<EM> </EM>those ancient sages; and this by those
very nations, which, learned in all the modern arts and sciences,
cultured and wise in their generation, accept to this day as their
one living and infinite God, the anthropomorphic &quot;Jehovah&quot;
of the Jews.
<P>
What were some of the alleged &quot;superstitions&quot;? Hesiod
believed, for instance, that &quot;the winds were the sons of
the giant Typhoeus,&quot; who were chained and unchained at will
by AEolus, and the polytheistic Greeks accepted it along with
Hesiod. Why should not they, since the monotheistic Jews had the
same beliefs, with other names for their <EM>dramatis personae</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and since Christians believe in the same to this day? The
Hesiodic AEolus, Boreas, etc., etc., were named <EM>Kadim</EM>,<EM>
Tzaphon</EM>,<EM> Daren</EM>,<EM> and Ruach Hajan </EM>by the
&quot;chosen people&quot; of Israel. What is, then, the fundamental
difference? While the Hellenes were taught that AEolus tied and
untied the winds, the Jews believed as fervently that their Lord
God, &quot;<EM>with smoke coming out of his nostrils and fire
out of his mouth</EM>,<EM> rode upon a cherub and did fly; </EM>and
was seen <EM>upon the wings of the wind</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>II.
Sam.</EM>,<EM> xxii. </EM>9<EM> and </EM>11). The expressions
of the two nations are either both figures of speech, or both
<EM>superstitions. </EM>We think they are neither; but only arise
from a keen sense of oneness with nature, and a perception of
the mysterious and the intelligent behind every natural phenomenon,
which the moderns no longer possess. Nor was it &quot;superstitious&quot;
in the Greek pagans to listen to the oracle of Delphi, when, at
the approach of the fleet of Xerxes, that oracle advised them
to &quot;sacrifice to the Winds,&quot; if the same has to be regarded
as <EM>Divine </EM>Worship in the Israelites, who sacrificed as
often to the wind and fire -- especially to the latter element.
Do they not say that their &quot;God is a consuming fire&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Deut. iv.</EM>,<EM> </EM>24), who appeared generally
<EM>as </EM>Fire and &quot;encompassed by fire&quot;? and did
not Elijah seek for him (the Lord) in the &quot;great strong wind,
and in the earthquake&quot;? Do not the Christians repeat the
same after them? Do not they, moreover, sacrifice to this day,
to the same &quot;<EM>God of Wind and Water?</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>They
do; because special prayers for rain, dry weather, trade-winds
and the calming of storms on the seas exist to this hour in the
prayer-books of the three Christian churches; and the several
hundred sects of the Protestant religion<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 467 THE FIGHTING GODS.</H6>

<P>
offer them to their God upon every threat of calamity? The fact
that they are no more answered by Jehovah, than they were, probably,
by Jupiter <EM>Pluvius</EM>,<EM> </EM>does not alter the fact
of these prayers being addressed to the Power or Powers supposed
to rule over the Elements, or of these Powers being identical
in Paganism and Christianity; or have we to believe that such
prayers are crass idolatry and absurd &quot;superstition&quot;
<EM>only </EM>when addressed by a Pagan to his <EM>idol</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and that the same superstition is suddenly transformed into
<EM>praiseworthy piety </EM>and<EM> religion </EM>whenever the
name of the celestial addressee is changed? But the tree <EM>is
</EM>known by its fruit. And the fruit of the Christian tree being
no better than that of the tree of Paganism, why should the former
command more reverence than the latter.
<P>
Thus, when we are told by the Chevalier Drach, a converted Jew,
and the Marquis de Mirville, a Roman Catholic fanatic of the French
aristocracy, that in Hebrew <EM>lightning </EM>is a synonym of
<EM>fury</EM>,<EM> </EM>and is always handled by an <EM>evil </EM>Spirit;
that <EM>Jupiter Fulgur</EM> or <EM>Fulgurans </EM>is also called
by the Christians <EM>oelicius</EM>,<EM> </EM>and denounced as
the <EM>soul of lightning</EM>,<EM> </EM>its<EM> </EM>daemon*;
we have either to apply the same explanation and definitions to
the &quot;Lord God of Israel,&quot; under the same circumstances,
or renounce our right of abusing the gods and creeds of other
nations.
<P>
The foregoing statements emanating as they do from two ardent
and learned Roman Catholics, are, to say the least,<EM> dangerous</EM>,<EM>
</EM>in the presence of the Bible and its prophets. Indeed, if
Jupiter, the &quot;chief Daemon of the Pagan Greeks,&quot; hurled
his deadly thunder-bolts and lightnings at those who excited his
wrath, so did the Lord God of Abraham and Jacob. We find in I.
Samuel, that &quot;the Lord thundered from heaven, and the most
High uttered <EM>his </EM>voice, and he sent out arrows (thunder
bolts) and scattered them (Saul's armies) with lightning, and
discomforted them.&quot; (<EM>Chap. xxii. </EM>14,<EM> </EM>15.)
<P>
The Athenians are accused of having sacrificed to Boreas; and
this &quot;Demon&quot; is charged with having submerged and wrecked
400 ships of the Persian fleet on the rocks of Mount Pelion, and
of having become so furious &quot;that all the Magi of Xerxes
could hardly counteract it by offering contra-sacrifices to Tethys&quot;
[<EM>Herodotus </EM>&quot;Polym.&quot; cxc]. Very fortunately,
no authenticated instance is on the records of Christian wars
showing a like catastrophe on the same scale happening to one
Christian fleet owing to the &quot;prayers&quot; of its enemy
-- another Christian nation. But this is from no fault of theirs,
for each prays as ardently to Jehovah for the destruction of the
other, as the Athenians prayed to Boreas. Both resorted to a neat
little piece of black magic <EM>con amore. </EM>Such abstinence
from divine interference being hardly due to lack of
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Cosmolatry, p. 415.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 468 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
prayers, sent to a <EM>common </EM>Almighty God for mutual destruction,
where, then, shall we draw the line between Pagan and Christian?
And who can doubt that all Protestant England would rejoice and
offer thanks to the Lord, if, during some future war, 400 ships
of the hostile fleet were to be wrecked owing to such holy prayers.
What is, then, the difference, we ask again, between a Jupiter,
a Boreas, and a Jehovah? No more than this: The crime of one's
own next-of-kin -- say of one's &quot;father&quot; -- is always
excused and often exalted, whereas the crime of our neighbour's
parent is ever gladly punished by hanging. Yet the crime is the
same.
<P>
So far the &quot;blessings of Christianity&quot; do not seem to
have made any appreciable advance on the morals of the converted
Pagans.
<P>
The above is not a defence of Pagan gods, nor is it an attack
on the Christian deity, nor does it mean belief in either. The
writer is quite impartial, and rejects the testimony in favour
of either, neither praying to, believing in, nor dreading any
such &quot;personal&quot; and anthropomorphic God. The parallels
are brought forward simply as one more curious exhibition of the
illogical and blind fanaticism of the civilized theologian. For,
so far, there is not a very great difference between the two beliefs,
and there is none in their respective effects upon <EM>morality</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or spiritual nature. The &quot;light of Christ&quot; shines
upon as hideous features of the animal-man now, as the &quot;light
of Lucifer&quot; did in days of old.
<P>
&quot;Those unfortunate heathens in their superstition regard
even the Elements as something that has comprehension! . . . .
They still have faith in their idol Vayu -- the god or, rather,
Demon of the Wind and Air . . . they firmly believe in the efficacy
of their prayers, and in the powers of their Brahmins over the
winds and storms. . . . .&quot; (The Missionary Lavoisier, of
Cochin, in the <EM>Journal des Colonies.</EM>)<EM> </EM>In reply
to this, we may quote from <EM>Luke viii.</EM>,<EM> </EM>24: &quot;And
he (Jesus) arose and <EM>rebuked the Wind and the raging of the
Water</EM>,<EM> and they ceased and there was a calm</EM>.&quot;
And here is another quotation from a prayer book: . . . &quot;Oh,
Virgin of the Sea, blessed Mother and Lady of the Waters, stay
thy waves . . .&quot; etc., etc. (prayer of the Neapolitan and
Provencal sailors, copied textually from that of the Phoenician
mariners to their Virgingoddess Astarte.) The logical and irrepressible
conclusion arising from the parallels brought forward, and the
denunciation of the Missionary is this: The <EM>commands </EM>of
the Brahmins to their element-gods not <EM>remaining </EM>&quot;<EM>ineffectual,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>the power of the Brahmins is thus placed on a par with that
of Jesus. Moreover, Astarte is shown not a whit weaker in potency
than the &quot;Virgin of the Sea&quot; of Christian sailors. It
is not enough to give a dog a bad name, and then hang him; the
dog has to be proven guilty. Boreas and Astarte may be <EM>devils
</EM>in theological<HR>

<P>
fancy, but, as just remarked, the tree has to be judged by its
fruit. And once the Christians are shown as immoral and wicked
as the pagans ever were, what benefit has humanity derived from
its change of gods and idols?
<P>
That, however, which God and the Christian Saints are justified
in doing, becomes a crime, if successful, in simple mortals. Sorcery
and incantations are regarded as fables now; yet from the day
of the <EM>Institutes of Justinian </EM>down to the laws against
witchcraft of England and America -- <EM>obsolete </EM>but not
repealed to this day -- such incantations, even when only suspected,
were punished as criminal. Why punish a chimera? And still we
read of Constantine, the Emperor, sentencing to death the philosopher
Sopatrus <EM>for unchaining the winds, </EM>and thus preventing
ships loaded with grain from arriving in time to put an end to
famine. Pausanias, when affirming that he saw with his own eyes
&quot;men who by simple <EM>prayers and incantations</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>stopped a strong hail-storm, is derided. This does not prevent
modern Christian writers from advising prayer during storm and
danger, and believing in its efficacy. Hoppo and Stadlein two
magicians and sorcerers -- were sentenced to death for throwing
<EM>charms on fruit </EM>and transferring a harvest <EM>by magic
arts </EM>from one field to another, hardly a century ago, if
we can believe Sprenger, the famous writer, who vouches for it:
&quot;<EM>Qui fruges excantassent segetem pellicentes incantando.</EM>&quot;
<P>
Let us close by reminding the reader that, without the smallest
shadow of superstition, one may believe in the dual nature of
every object on Earth -- in the spiritual and the material, the
visible and the invisible nature, and that science virtually proves
this, while denying its own demonstration. For if, as Sir William
Grove has it, the electricity we handle is but the <EM>result
</EM>of ordinary matter affected by something <EM>invisible, the
</EM>&quot;<EM>ultimate </EM>generating power&quot; of every Force,
the &quot;<EM>one omnipresent influence,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>then
it only becomes natural that one should believe as the ancients
did; namely, that every Element is <EM>dual </EM>in its nature.
&quot;ETHEREAL fire is the emanation of the KABIR proper; the
<EM>aerial </EM>is but the union (correlation) of the former with
<EM>terrestrial fire, </EM>and its guidance and application on
our earthly plane belongs to a <EM>Kabir </EM>of a lesser dignity&quot;
-- an Elemental, perhaps, as an Occultist would call it; and the
same may be said of every Cosmic Element.
<P>
No one will deny that the human being is possessed of various
forces: magnetic, sympathetic, antipathetic, nervous, dynamical,
occult, mechanical, mental -- every kind of force; and that the
physical forces are all biological in their essence, seeing that
they intermingle with, and often merge into, those forces that
we have named intellectual and moral -- the first being the vehicles,
so to say, the <EM>upadhi, of </EM>the second. No one, who does
not deny soul in man, would hesitate in<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 470 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
saying that their presence and commingling are the very essence
of our being; that they constitute the <EM>Ego </EM>in man, in
fact. These potencies have their physiological, physical, mechanical,
as well as their nervous, ecstatic, clairaudient, and clairvoyant
phenomena, which are now regarded and recognised as perfectly
natural, even by science. Why should man be the only exception
in nature, and why cannot even the ELEMENTS have their <EM>vehicles,
</EM>their &quot;Vahans&quot; in what we call the PHYSICAL FORCES?
And why, above all, should such beliefs be called &quot;superstition&quot;
along with the religions of old?
