<STRONG>W</STRONG>ESTERN <STRONG>S</STRONG>PECULATIONS,

FOUNDED ON THE <STRONG>G</STRONG>REEK AND <STRONG>P</STRONG>URANIC
<STRONG>T</STRONG>RADITIONS.
<P>
Thus it becomes natural to find that, on even such meagre data
as have reached the profane historian, Rudbeck, a Swedish scientist,
tried to prove about two centuries ago that Sweden was the Atlantis
of Plato. He thought, even, that he had found in the configuration
of ancient Upsala, the situation and measurements given by the
Greek sage of the capital of &quot;Atlantis.&quot; As Bailly proved,
Rudbeck was mistaken; but so was Bailly likewise, and still more.
For Sweden and Norway had formed part and parcel of ancient Lemuria,
and also of Atlantis on the European side, just as Eastern and
Western Siberia and Kamschatka had belonged to it, on the Asiatic.
Only, once more, when was it? We can find it out approximately
only by studying the <EM>Puranas, </EM>if we will have nought
to do with the Secret teachings.
<P>
Three quarters of a century have already elapsed since Captain
(now Colonel) Wilford brought forward his fanciful theories about
the British islands being the &quot;White Island,&quot; the <EM>Atala
</EM>of the Puranas. This was sheer nonsense, as the Atala is
one of the seven <EM>dwipas, </EM>or islands, belonging to the
nether lokas, one of the seven regions of Patala (the antipodes).
Moreover, as Wilford* shows, the Puranas place it &quot;on
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Wilford makes many mistakes. He identifies, for instance, Sveta-dwipa
(the white Island), the &quot;island in the northern part of <EM>Toyambhudi,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>with England, and then tries to identify it with Atala (a
nether region) and Atlantis. Now the former is the abode of Vishnu,
<EM>exoterically, </EM>and Atala is a hell. He also places it
in the Euxine or Icshu (Black) Sea, and then seems to connect
it, in another place, with Africa and Atlas.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 403 ORIENTALISTS IN THE WRONG BOX.</H6>

<P>
the seventh zone or seventh climate,&quot; -- rather, on the seventh
measure of heat: which thus locates it between the latitudes of
24 and 28 degrees north. It is then to be sought on the same degree
as the Tropic of Cancer, whereas England is between the 50th and
60th degrees of latitude. Wilford speaks of it as <EM>Atala, </EM>Atlantis,
the white island. And in vol. viii. of Journal of Asiatic Researches,
p. 280, its enemy is called the &quot;White Devil,&quot; the <EM>demon
of terror. </EM>For he says: &quot;In their (the Hindu and Mahomedan)
romances, we see Kai-caus going to the mountain of '<EM>As-burj,
at the foot of which </EM>the Sun sets,' to fight the <EM>Dev-Sefid,
</EM>or white devil, the <EM>Taradaitya </EM>of the <EM>Puranas,
</EM>whose abode was on the <EM>seventh stage </EM>of the world,
answering to the seventh zone of the Buddhists, or the <EM>White
</EM>Island.&quot;
<P>
Now here the Orientalists have been, and are still, facing the
Sphinx's riddle, the wrong solution of which will ever destroy
their authority, if not their persons, in the eyes of every Hindu
scholar, even those who are not initiates. For there is not a
statement in the Puranas -- on the conflicting details of which
Wilford based his speculations -- which has not several meanings,
and does not apply to both the physical and the metaphysical worlds.
If the old Hindus divided the face of the globe geographically
into seven zones, climates, dwipas, and into seven hells and seven
heavens, allegorically, that measure of seven did not apply in
both cases to the same localities. It is the north pole, the country
of &quot;Meru,&quot; which is the seventh division, as it answers
to the Seventh principle (or fourth metaphysically), of the occult
calculation, for it represents the region of Atma, of pure soul,
and Spirituality. Hence Pushkara is shown <EM>as the seventh zone,
</EM>or dwipa, which encompasses the <EM>Kshira </EM>Ocean, or
Ocean of milk (the ever-frozen white region) in the Vishnu (and
other) Puranas (<EM>Book II ch. iv.</EM>).<EM> </EM>And Pushkara,
with its two <EM>Varshas, </EM>lies directly at the foot of Meru.
For it is said that &quot;the two countries north and south of
Meru are <EM>shaped like a</EM> <EM>bow,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>.
. and that &quot;one half of the surface of the earth is on the
south of Meru and the other half on the north of Meru <EM>-- beyond
which</EM> <EM>is half of Pushkara</EM>&quot; (<EM>Vishnu Purana,
Asiatic Researches, etc.</EM>).<EM> </EM>Geographically, then,
Pushkara is America, Northern and Southern; and <EM>allegorically
</EM>it is the prolongation of Jambu-dwipa* in the middle of
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Every name in the Puranas has to be examined at least under
two aspects; geographically, and metaphysically, in its allegorical
application; <EM>e.g., Nila, </EM>the (blue) mountain which is
one of the boundaries to the north of Meru, is again to be sought
geographically in a mountain range in Orissa, and again in a mountain
quite different from the others (in Western Africa). Jambu-dwipa
is Vishnu's dominion -- the world, limited in the Puranas to our
globe, the region which contains Meru <EM>only</EM>, and again
it is divided to contain Bharata-varsha (India), its <EM>best
</EM>division, and the fairest, says Parasara. Likewise with Pushkara
and all others. <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 404 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
which stands Meru, for it is the country inhabited by beings who
live ten thousand years, who are free from sickness or failing;
where there is neither virtue nor vice, caste or laws, for these
men are &quot;of the same nature as the Gods,&quot; (Vishnu Purana,
Book <STRONG>II</STRONG>. ch. iv.). Wilford is inclined to see
Meru in Mount Atlas, and locates there also the Loka-lokas. Now
Meru, we are told, which is the <EM>Swar</EM>-loka, the abode
of Brahma, of Vishnu, and the Olympus of Indian exoteric religions,
is described geographically as &quot;passing through the middle
of the earth-globe, and protruding on either side&quot; (<EM>Surya
Siddhanta, v. 5, Whitney</EM>'<EM>s</EM> <EM>trans.</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>On its upper station are the gods, on the nether (or South
pole) is the abode of demons (hells). How can then Meru be Mount
Atlas? Besides which, Taradaitya, a demon, cannot be placed on
the seventh zone if the latter is identified with the &quot;white&quot;
Island, which is <EM>Sveta-dwipa, </EM>for reasons given in the
foot-note. (<EM>Vide infra.</EM>)
<P>
Wilford accuses the modern Brahmans &quot;of having jumbled them
(islands and countries) all together&quot; (A.R. <STRONG>III</STRONG>.
300); but<EM> he</EM> jumbled them still more. He believes that
as the Brahmanda and Vayu Puranas divide the old continent into
seven dwipas, said to be surrounded by a vast ocean, beyond which
lie the regions and mountains of Atala (<EM>ibid</EM>), hence
&quot;most probably the Greeks divided the nation of Atlantis,
which, as it could not be found after having once been discovered,
they conceived to have been destroyed by some shock of nature.&quot;
<P>
Finding certain difficulties in believing that the Egyptian priests,
Plato, and even Homer, had all built their notions of Atlantis
on Atala -- a nether region located at the Southern pole -- we
prefer holding to the statements given in the secret books. We
believe in the seven &quot;continents,&quot; four of which have
already lived their day, the fifth still exists, and two are to
appear in the future. We believe that each of these is not strictly
a continent in the modern sense of the word, but that each name,
from Jambu down to Pushkara,* refers to the geographical names
given (i.) to the dry lands covering the face of the whole earth
during the period of a Root-Race, in general; and (ii.) to what
remained of these after a geological (race) <EM>Pralaya</EM> --
as &quot;Jambu,&quot; for instance: and (iii.) to those localities
which will enter, after the future cataclysms, into the formation
of new <EM>universal </EM>&quot;continents,&quot; peninsulas,
or dwipas** -- each continent being, in one sense, a greater or
smaller region of dry land surrounded with water. Thus, that whatever
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Jambu, Plaksha, Salmali, Kusa, Krauncha, Saka, and Pushkara.
<P>
** Such as Saka and Pushkara, for instance, which do not yet exist,
but into which will enter such lands as some portions of America,
of Africa, and Central Asia, with the Gobi region. Let us bear
in mind that <EM>Upadwipas </EM>means<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>root</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>islands, or the dry land in general.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 405 FUTURE CONTINENTS, SYMBOLIZED.</H6>

<P>
&quot;jumble&quot; the nomenclature of these may represent to
the profane, there is none, in fact, to him who has the key.
<P>
Thus, we believe <EM>we know </EM>that, though two of the Puranic
&quot;islands&quot; -- the <EM>sixth and seventh </EM>&quot;continents&quot;
-- are yet to come, nevertheless there <EM>were, </EM>or there
<EM>are</EM>, lands which will enter into the composition of the
future dry lands, of new earths whose geographical faces will
be entirely changed, as were those of the past. Therefore we find
in the Puranas that Saka-dwipa is (or will be) a continent, and
that Sankha-dwipa, as shown in the Vayu Purana, is only &quot;a
minor island,&quot; one of the nine divisions (to which Vayu adds
six more) of Bharata Varsha. Because Sankha-dwipa was peopled
by &quot;Mlechchhas (unclean foreigners), who worshipped Hindu
divinities,&quot; therefore they were connected with India.* This
accounts for Sankhasura, a King of a portion of Sankha-dwipa,
who was killed by Krishna; that King who resided in the palace
&quot;which was an ocean shell, and whose subjects lived in shells
also,&quot; says Wilford.
<P>
&quot;On the banks of the Nile** (?) there were frequent contests
between the Devatas (divine beings, demi-gods) and the Daityas
(giants); but the latter tribe having prevailed, their King, Sankhasura,
who resided in the Ocean, made frequent incursions in the night&quot;
(<EM>As. Res.,</EM> Vol.<STRONG> III</STRONG>. 225.)
<P>
It is not on the banks of the <EM>Nile, </EM>but on the coasts
of Western Africa, south of where now lies Morocco, that these
battles took place. There was a time when the whole of the Sahara
desert was a sea, then a continent as fertile as the Delta, and
then, only after another temporary submersion, it became a desert
similar to that other wilderness, the desert of Shamo or Gobi.
This is shown in Puranic tradition, for on the same page as above
cited, it is said: &quot;The people were between two fires; for,
while Sankhasura was ravaging one side of the continent, Krauncha
(or Cracacha), King of Kraunch, used to desolate the other; both
armies . . . thus <EM>changed the most fertile regions into a
savage desert.</EM>&quot;
<P>
That not only the last island of Atlantis, spoken of by Plato,
but a large continent, first divided, and then broken later on
into seven peninsulas and islands (called <EM>dwipas</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>preceded Europe, is sure. It covered the whole of the North
and South Atlantic regions, as well as portions of the North and
South Pacific, and had islands even in the Indian Ocean (relics
of Lemuria). The claim is corroborated by Indian Puranas, Greek
writers, and Asiatic, Persian, and Mohammedan traditions. Wilford,
who confuses sorely the Hindu and the Mussulman legends, shows
this, however, clearly. (<EM>See Vol. VIII., X. and XI. of</EM>

<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* They were called demons, <EM>Asuras, </EM>giants, and monsters,
because of their wickedness; and thus their country was likened
to Atala -- a hell, because of that.
<P>
** Not on the river Nile, surely, but near the <EM>Nila</EM> mountains
of the Atlas range.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 406 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
<EM>Asiatic Researches.</EM>)<EM> </EM>And his facts and quotations
from the <EM>Puranas </EM>give direct and conclusive evidence
that the Aryan Hindus and other ancient nations were earlier navigators
than the Phoenicians, who are now credited with having been the
first seamen that appeared in the <EM>post-</EM>diluvian times.
This is what is given in the <EM>Journal </EM>of the Asiatic Society,
<EM>III., pp.</EM> 325,<EM> et seq.: -</EM>-
<P>
&quot;In their distress the few nations who survived (in the war
between Devatas and Daityas) raised their hands to Bhagavan, 'Let
him who can deliver us . . . be our King'; using the word I'T
(a <EM>magic </EM>term not understood by Wilford, evidently) which
re-echoed through the whole country.&quot;
<P>
Then comes a violent storm, the waters of the <EM>Kali </EM>are
strangely agitated, &quot;when there appeared from the waves .
. a man, afterwards called I'T, at the head of a numerous army,
saying <EM>abhayan, </EM>no fear&quot; . . . and scattered the
enemy. &quot;The King I'T,&quot; explains Wilford, &quot;is a
subordinate incarnation of M'rira&quot; (<EM>Mrida, </EM>a form
of Rudra, probably?) who &quot;re-established peace and prosperity
throughout all Sankha-dwipa, <EM>through Barbaradesa, </EM>Hissast'han
and Awasthan or Arabia . . &quot; etc., etc.
<P>
Surely, if the Hindu Puranas give a description of wars on continents
and islands situated beyond Western Africa in the Atlantic Ocean;
if their writers speak of <EM>Barbaras </EM>and other people such
as Arabs -- they who were never known to navigate, or cross the
<EM>Kala pani </EM>(the black waters of the Ocean) in the days
of Phoenician navigation -- then their Puranas must be older than
those Phoenicians (placed at from 2,000 to 3,000 years <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>.).
At any rate those traditions must have been older;* as --
<P>
&quot;In the above accounts,&quot; writes an adept, &quot;the
Hindus speak of this island as <EM>existing </EM>and in great
power; it must, therefore, have been more than <EM>eleven thousand
years ago.</EM>&quot;
<P>
But another calculation and proof may be adduced of the great
antiquity of these Hindu Aryans who knew of (because they had
once dwelt in it) and described the last surviving island of Atlantis
-- or rather of that remnant of the Eastern portion of that continent
which had
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Says Wilford of the division of Atlantis and Bharata or India,
confusing the two accounts and Priyavrata with Medhatithi: --
&quot;The division was made by Priyavrata. . . . He had ten sons,
and it was his intention to divide the whole world. In the same
manner Neptune divided Atlantis between his ten sons. . . . One
of them had . . . the extremity of the Atlantis&quot; -- which
&quot;is probably the old continent. . . . This Atlantis was overwhelmed
by a flood. . . . and it seems that <EM>by Atlantis we should</EM>
<EM>understand the Antediluvian Earth </EM>over which ten princes
were born to rule according to the mythology of the West (and
of the East, also) but <EM>seven only </EM>of them sat upon the
throne.&quot; (<EM>Vol. III. p. </EM>286.) . . Some also are of
opinion that of the seven dwipas <EM>six </EM>were destroyed by
a flood (<EM>Vol. VIII. p. </EM>367). Wilford takes it to be &quot;Gades
which included Spain,&quot; but it was Plato's island -- rather.
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 407 THE PUZZLES OF ANTIQUITY.</H6>

<P>
perished soon after the upheaval of the two Americas* -- the two
Varshas of Pushkara. This may be demonstrated, moreover, on an
astronomical calculation by an adept who criticises Wilford. For
recalling what the Orientalist had brought forward concerning
the Mount Ashburj &quot;at the foot of which the sun sets,&quot;
where was the war between the Devatas and the Daityas,** he says:
--
<P>
&quot;We will consider, then, the latitude and longitude of the
lost island, and of the remaining Mount Ashburj. It was on the
seventh stage of the world, <EM>i.e</EM>., in the seventh climate
(which is between the latitude of 24 degrees and latitude 28 degrees
north) . . . This island, the daughter of the Ocean, is frequently
described as lying in the West; and the sun is represented as
setting at the foot of its mountain (Ashburj, Atlas, Teneriffe
or Nila, no matter the name), and fighting the white Devil of
the 'White Island.' &quot;
<P>
Now, considering this statement from its astronomical aspect,
and knowing that Krishna is the incarnated Sun (Vishnu), a solar
God; and that he is said to have killed Dev-Sefid, the white giant
-- a<EM> possible</EM> personification of the ancient inhabitants
at the foot of the Atlas -- perchance Krishna may be only a representation
of the vertical beams of the Sun? Those inhabitants (the Atlantides)
are, we have seen, accused by Diodorus of daily <EM>cursing the
Sun, </EM>and ever fighting his influence. This is an astronomical
interpretation of course. But it will now be proved that Sankhasura,
and Sancha dwipa, and all their history, is also geographically
and ethnologically Plato's &quot;Atlantis&quot; in Hindu dress.
<P>
It was just remarked that since, in the Puranic accounts, the
island is<EM> still existing, </EM>then those accounts must be
older than the 11,000 years elapsed since Sancha dwipa, or the
Poseidonis of Atlantis, disappeared. Is it not barely possible
that Hindus should have known the island still earlier? Let us
turn again to astronomical demonstrations, which make this quite
plain if one assumes, according to the said adept, that &quot;at
the time when the summer tropical 'colure' passed through the
<EM>Pleiades,</EM> when<EM> cor-Leonis </EM>would be upon the
equator; and when Leo <EM>was vertical</EM> to Ceylon at sunset,
then would <EM>Taurus </EM>be vertical to the island of <EM>Atlantis
at noon.</EM>&quot;
<P>
This explains, perhaps, why the Singhalese, the heirs of the
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* America, the &quot;new&quot; world -- is thus, though not <EM>much,</EM>
older; still it <EM>is</EM> older than Europe, the &quot;old world.&quot;
<P>
** If Div or Dev-Sefid's (the Taradaitya's) abode was on the <EM>seventh
stage, </EM>it is because he came from Pushkara, the <EM>Patala</EM>
(antipodes) of India, or from America. The latter touched the
walls, so to say, of Atlantis, before the latter sank finally.
The word <EM>Patala, </EM>meaning both the antipodal countries
and infernal regions, thus became synonymous in ideas and attributes
as well as in name. <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 408 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Rakshasas and Giants of Lanka, and the direct descendants of <EM>Singha,</EM>
or <EM>Leo, </EM>became connected with Sancha dwipa or Poseidonis
(Plato's Atlantis). Only, as shown by Mackey's &quot;<EM>Sphinxiad,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>this must have occurred about 23,000 years ago, <EM>astronomically</EM>;<EM>
</EM>at which time the obliquity of the ecliptic must have been
rather more than 27 degrees, and consequently Taurus must have
passed over &quot;Atlantis&quot; or &quot;Sancha dwipa.&quot;
And that it was so is clearly demonstrated.
<P>
&quot;<EM>The sacred bull Nandi was brought from Bharata to Sancha
to meet</EM> <EM>Rishabha </EM>(<EM>Taurus</EM>) <EM>every Kalpa.
But when those of the White Island</EM> (who descended originally
from Sveta dwipa),* <EM>who had mixed with the</EM> <EM>Daityas
</EM>(giants)<EM> of the land of iniquity, had become black with
Sin, then</EM> <EM>Nandi remained for ever in the </EM>&quot;<EM>White
Island</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(or Sveta dwipa.) &quot;<EM>Those</EM>
<EM>of the Fourth World</EM> (race)<EM> lost </EM><STRONG>AUM</STRONG>&quot;<EM>
-- </EM>say the <EM>Commentaries.</EM> 
<P>
Asburj (or Azburj), whether the peak of Teneriffe or not, was
a volcano, when the sinking of the &quot;western Atala&quot; (or
hell) began, and those who were saved told the tale to their children.
Plato's Atlantis perished between water below and fire above;
the great mountain vomiting flames all the while. &quot;The 'fire-vomiting
Monster' survived alone out of the ruins of the unfortunate island.&quot;
<P>
Do the Greeks, accused of borrowing a Hindu fiction (Atala), and
inventing from it another (Atlantis), stand also accused of getting
their geographical notions and the number seven from them? (<EM>Vide
</EM>in Part <STRONG>II</STRONG>. the several sections on the
<STRONG>S</STRONG>EPTENATE in nature.)
<P>
&quot;The famous Atlantis exists no longer, but we can hardly
doubt that it did once,&quot; says Proclus, &quot;for Marcellus,
who wrote a history of Ethiopian affairs, says that such, and
so great an island once existed, and this is evidenced by those
who composed histories relative to the external sea. For <EM>they
relate that in this time there were seven islands in </EM>the
Atlantic sea sacred to Proserpine; and besides these, three of
immense magnitude, sacred to Pluto . . . Jupiter . . . and Neptune.
And, besides this, the inhabitants of the last island (Poseidonis)
<EM>preserved</EM> <EM>the memory of the prodigious magnitude
</EM>of the Atlantic island as related by their ancestors, and
of its governing for many periods all the islands in the Atlantic
sea. From this <EM>isle </EM>one may pass to other large
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Neither Atlantis, nor yet Sancha dwipa, was ever called &quot;White
Island.&quot; When tradition says that &quot;the White Island
became black on account of the sins of people&quot; it only means
the denizens of the &quot;White Island,&quot; or Siddhapura, or
Sveta dwipa, who descended to the Atlantis of the Third and Fourth
races, to &quot;inform the latter; and who, having incarnated,
became black with sin&quot; -- a figure of speech. All the Avatars
of Vishnu are said to come originally from the White Island. According
to Tibetan tradition the White Island is the only locality which
escapes the general fate of other dwipas and can be destroyed
by neither fire nor water, for -- it is the &quot;eternal land.&quot;
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 409 WHAT MARCELLUS SAYS.</H6>

<P>
islands beyond, which are not far from the firm land, near which
is the true sea.&quot;
<P>
&quot;These seven dwipas (inaccurately rendered islands) constitute,
according to Marcellus, the body of the famous Atlantis,&quot;
writes Wilford himself. . . . . This evidently shows that <EM>Atlantis
is the old continent</EM>. . . . The Atlantis was destroyed after
a violent storm (?): this is well known to the Puranics, some
of whom assert that in consequence of this dreadful convulsion
of nature, six of the dwipas disappeared&quot; . . <EM>. </EM>(<EM>xi.,
</EM>27).
<P>
Enough proofs have now been given to satisfy the greatest sceptic.
Nevertheless, direct proofs based on exact science are also added.
Volumes might be written, however, to no purpose for those who
will neither see nor hear, except through the eyes and ears of
their respective authorities.
<P>
Hence the teaching of the Roman Catholic scholiasts, namely, that
Hermon, the mount in the land of Mizpeth -- meaning &quot;anathema,&quot;
&quot;destruction&quot; -- is the same as Mount Armon. As a proof
of this, Josephus is often quoted, as affirming that still in
his own day enormous bones of giants were daily discovered on
it. But it was the land of Balaam the prophet, whom the &quot;Lord
loved well&quot;; and so mixed up are facts and personages in
the said scholiasts' brains, that, when the Zohar explains the
&quot;birds&quot; which inspired Balaam to mean &quot;Serpents,&quot;
to wit, the wise men and adepts at whose school he had learnt
the mysteries of prophecy -- the opportunity is again taken of
showing Mount Hermon inhabited by the &quot;winged dragons of
Evil, whose chief is Samael&quot; (the Jewish Satan).
<P>
&quot;It is to those unclean spirits chained on Mount Hermon of
the Desert, that the scapegoat of Israel, who assumed the name
of one of them (Azaz(y)el), was sent&quot; (<EM>Spencer</EM>).
<P>
We say it is not so. The Zohar has the following explanation on
the practice of magic which is called in Hebrew <EM>Nehhaschim,
</EM>or the &quot;Serpents' Works.&quot; It says (<EM>Part III.
col. 302</EM>)<EM>: -</EM>- &quot;It is called <EM>nehhaschim,
</EM>because the magicians (practical Kabalists) work <EM>surrounded
by</EM> <EM>the light of the primordial serpent, </EM>which they
perceive in heaven as a luminous zone composed of myriads of small
stars&quot; . . . which means simply the <EM>astral light, </EM>so
called by the Martinists, by Eliphas Levi, and now by all the
modern Occultists. (Vide Sections about.)

<P>
The foregoing teachings of the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ECRET <STRONG>D</STRONG>OCTRINE,
supplemented by universal traditions, must now have demonstrated
that the Brahmanas and Puranas, the Yathas and other Mazdean Scriptures,
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 410 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
down to the Egyptian, Greek, and Roman, and finally to the Jewish
Sacred records, all have the same origin. None are meaningless
and baseless stories, invented to entrap the unwary profane: all
are allegories intended to convey, under a more or less fantastic
veil, the great truths gathered in the same field of pre-historic
tradition. Space forbids us from entering, in these two volumes,
into further and more minute details with respect to the four
Races which preceded our own. But before offering to the student
the history of the psychic and spiritual evolution of the direct
antediluvian fathers of our Fifth (Aryan) humanity, and before
demonstrating its bearing upon all the other side branches grown
from the same trunk, we have to elucidate a few more facts. It
has been shown, on the evidence of the whole ancient literary
world, and the intuitional speculations of more than one philosopher
and scientist of the later ages, that the tenets of our Esoteric
Doctrine are corroborated by inferential as well as by direct
proof in almost every case. That neither the &quot;legendary&quot;
giants, nor the lost continents, nor yet the evolution of the
preceding races, are quite baseless tales. In the <EM>Addenda
</EM>which close this volume, science will find itself more than
once unable to reply; they will, it is hoped, finally dispose
of every sceptical remark with regard to the sacred number in
nature, and our figures in general. (Vide &#167;&#167; on the
<EM>Septenaries.</EM>)
<P>
Meanwhile, one task is left incomplete: that of disposing of that
most pernicious of all the theological dogmas -- the CURSE under
which mankind is alleged to have suffered ever since the supposed
disobedience of Adam and Eve in the bower of Eden.
<P>
Creative powers in man were the gift of divine wisdom, not the
result of sin. This is clearly instanced in the paradoxical behaviour
of Jehovah, who first <EM>curses </EM>Adam and Eve (or Humanity)
for the supposed committed crime, and then <EM>blesses </EM>his
&quot;chosen people&quot; by saying &quot;Be fruitful and multiply,
and replenish the earth&quot; (<EM>Gen. ix. </EM>1). The curse
was not brought on mankind by the Fourth Race, for the comparatively
sinless Third Race, the still more gigantic Antediluvians, had
perished in the same way; hence the Deluge was no punishment,
but simply a result of a periodical and geological law. Nor was
the curse of <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA called down upon them for
seeking <EM>natural </EM>union, as all the mindless animal-world
does in its proper seasons; but, for abusing the creative power,
for desecrating the divine gift, and wasting the life-essence
for no purpose except bestial personal gratification. When understood,
the third chapter of Genesis will be found to refer to the Adam
and Eve of the closing Third and the commencing Fourth Races.
In the beginning, conception was as easy for woman as it was for
all animal creation. Nature had never intended that woman should
bring forth her young ones &quot;in sorrow.&quot; Since that period,
however, during the <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 411 THE ANCIENT AND THE MODERN MAN.</H6>

<P>
evolution of the Fourth Race, there came enmity between its seed,
and the &quot;Serpent's&quot; seed, the seed or product of <EM>Karma
</EM>and divine wisdom. For the seed of woman or lust, <EM>bruised
the head </EM>of the seed of <EM>the fruit of</EM> <EM>wisdom
and knowledge, </EM>by turning the holy mystery of procreation
into animal gratification; hence the law of Karma &quot;bruised
the <EM>heel</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>of the Atlantean race, by gradually
changing physiologically, morally, physically, and mentally, the
whole nature of the Fourth Race of mankind,* until, from the healthy
King of animal creation of the Third Race, man became in the Fifth,
our race, a helpless, scrofulous being, and has now become the
wealthiest heir on the globe to constitutional and hereditary
diseases, the most consciously and intelligently bestial of all
animals!**
<P>
This is the real CURSE from the physiological standpoint, almost
the only one touched upon in the Kabalistic esotericism. Viewed
from this aspect, the curse is undeniable, for it is evident.
The intellectual evolution, in its progress hand-in-hand with
the physical, has certainly been a curse instead of a blessing
-- a gift quickened by the &quot;Lords of Wisdom,&quot; who have
poured on the human <EM>manas </EM>the fresh dew of their own
spirit and essence. The divine Titan has then suffered in vain;
and one feels inclined to regret his benefaction to mankind, and
sigh for those days so graphically depicted by AEschylus, in his
&quot;Prometheus Bound,&quot; when, at the close of the first
Titanic age (the age that followed that of ethereal man, of the
pious Kandu and Pramlocha), nascent, physical mankind, still mindless
and (physiologically) senseless, is described as --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Seeing, they saw in vain;<BR>
Hearing, they heard not; but like shapes in dreams,<BR>
Through the long time all things at random mixed.&quot;

* How wise and grand, how far-seeing and morally beneficent are
the laws of Manu on connubial life, when compared with the licence
tacitly allowed to man in civilized countries. That those laws
have been neglected for the last two millenniums does not prevent
us from admiring their forethought. The Brahmin was a <EM>grihasta,
</EM>a family man, till a certain period of his life, when, after
begetting a son, he broke with married life and became a chaste
Yogi. His very connubial life was regulated by his Brahmin astrologer
in accordance with his nature. Therefore, in such countries as
the Punjab, for instance, where the lethal influence of Mussulman,
and later on of European, licentiousness, has hardly touched the
orthodox Aryan castes, one still finds the finest men -- so far
as stature and physical strength go -- on the whole globe; whereas
the mighty men of old have found themselves replaced in the Deccan,
and especially in Bengal, by men whose generation becomes with
every century (and almost with every year) dwarfed and weakened.

for &quot;Him&quot; &quot;who dared alone &quot;-- when Zeus &quot;ardently
desired&quot; to quench the entire human race -- to save &quot;that
mortal race&quot; from perdition, or, as the suffering Titan is

and exterminating the first product of nature and the sea, in
the Stanzas (V, <EM>et seq</EM>.). . . . Prometheus <EM>represents
</EM>himself as having frustrated this design, and as being consequently
subjected, for the sake of mortals, to the most agonising pain,
inflicted by the remorseless cruelty of Zeus. We have, thus, the
Titan, the symbol of finite reason and free will (of intellectual
humanity, or the higher aspect of <EM>Manas</EM>),<EM> </EM>depicted
<EM>as the sublime philanthropist, </EM>while Zeus, the supreme

<P>
instead of &quot;an untainted mind, heaven's first gift&quot;
(AEschylus), there was created the eternal vulture of the ever
unsatisfied desire, of regret and despair coupled with &quot;the
dreamlike feebleness that fetters the blind race of mortals&quot;
(<EM>p</EM>. 556), unto the day when Prometheus is released by
his heaven-appointed deliverer, Herakles.
<P>
Now Christians -- Roman Catholics especially -- have tried to
prophetically connect this drama with the coming of Christ. No
greater mistake could be made. The true theosophist, the pursuer
of divine wisdom and worshipper of ABSOLUTE perfection -- the
unknown deity which is neither Zeus nor Jehovah -- will demur
to such an idea. Pointing to antiquity he will prove that there
never was an <EM>original </EM>sin, but only an abuse of physical
intelligence -- the psychic being guided by the animal, and both
putting out the light of the spiritual. He will say, &quot;All
ye who can read between the lines, study ancient wisdom in the
old dramas -- the Indian and the Greek; read carefully the one
just mentioned, one enacted on the theatres of Athens 2,400 years
ago, namely 'Prometheus Bound' &quot; The myth belongs to neither
Hesiod nor AEschylus; but, as Bunsen says, it &quot;is older than
the Hellenes themselves,&quot; for it belongs, in truth, to the
dawn of human consciousness. The <EM>Crucified</EM> Titan is the
personified symbol of the collective Logos, the &quot;Host,&quot;
and of the &quot;Lords of Wisdom&quot; or the HEAVENLY MAN, who
incarnated in Humanity. Moreover, as his name <EM>Pro</EM>-me-<EM>theus</EM>,
meaning &quot;he who sees before him&quot; or futurity, shows*
-- in the arts he devised and taught to humanity, psychological
insight was not the least. For as he complains to the daughters
of Oceanos: --

* From [[<EM>pro metis</EM>]] <EM>pro metis</EM>, &quot;forethought.&quot;
&quot;Professor Kuhn,&quot; we are told in the above-named volumes
of &quot;The Dramas of AEschylus,&quot; &quot;considers the name
of the Titan to be derived from the Sanskrit word Pramantha, the
instrument used for kindling fire. The root<EM> mand</EM> or<EM>
manth</EM>, implies rotatory motion, and the word <EM>manthami</EM>
(used to denote the process of fire kindling) acquired the secondary
sense of snatching away; hence we find another word of the same
stock, <EM>pramatha</EM>, signifying theft.&quot; This is very
ingenious, but perhaps not altogether correct; besides, there
is a very prosaic element in it. No doubt in physical nature,
the higher forms may develop from the lower ones, but it is hardly
so in the world of thought. And as we are told that the word <EM>manthami</EM>
passed into the Greek language and became the word <EM>manthano,
</EM>to learn; that is to say, to appropriate knowledge; whence
<EM>prometheia, </EM>fore-knowledge, fore-thought; we may find,
in searching, a more poetical origin for the &quot;fire-bringer&quot;
than that displayed in its Sanskrit origin. The <EM>Svastica,
</EM>the sacred sign and the instrument for kindling <EM>sacred
</EM>fire, may explain it better. &quot;Prometheus, the fire-bringer,
is the <EM>Pramantha </EM>personified,&quot; goes on the author;
&quot;he finds his prototype in the Aryan [[Footnote continued

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 414 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Leaving for a few pages the main subject, let us pause and see
what may be the hidden meaning of this, the most ancient as it
is the most suggestive of traditional allegories. As it relates
directly to the early races, this will be no real digression.
<P>
The subject of AEschylus' drama (the trilogy is lost) is known
to all cultured readers. The demi-god robs the gods (the Elohim)
of their secret -- the mystery of the <EM>creative fire. </EM>For
this sacrilegious attempt he is struck down by KRONOS* and delivered
unto Zeus, the FATHER and creator of a mankind which he would
wish to have blind intellectually, and animal-like; a <EM>personal
</EM>deity, which will not see MAN &quot;like one of us.&quot;
Hence Prometheus, &quot;the fire and light-giver,&quot; is chained
on Mount Caucasus and condemned to suffer torture. But the triform
Fates (Karma), whose decrees, as the Titan says, even Zeus: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;E'en he the fore-ordained cannot escape. . . &quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
-- ordain that those sufferings will last only to that day when
a son of Zeus --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Ay, a son bearing stronger than his sire&quot; (787)<BR>
. . . . . . . . . . <BR>
&quot;One of thine (Io's) own descendants it must be. .&quot;(791)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
-- is born. This &quot;Son&quot; will deliver Prometheus (the
suffering Humanity) from his own fatal gift. His name is, &quot;He
who has to come. . . . &quot;
<P>
On the authority, then, of these few lines, which, like any other
allegorical sentence, may be twisted into almost any meaning;
namely, on the words pronounced by Prometheus and addressed to
Io, the daughter of Inachos, persecuted by Zeus -- a whole prophecy
is constructed by some Catholic writers. Says the crucified Titan:
--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;And, portent past belief, the speaking oaks<BR>
By which full clearly, in no riddling phrase<BR>
Wast hailed <I>as the illustrious spouse of Zeus</I> <BR>

With <I>touch alone of unalarming hand;</I> <BR>
Then thou <I>dark Epaphos </I>shalt bear, whose name<BR>

ville amongst others -- into a clear prophecy. Io -- &quot;is
the mother of God,&quot; we are told, and &quot;dark Epaphos&quot;
-- Christ. But, the latter has not dethroned his father, except
metaphorically, if one has to regard Jehovah as that &quot;Father&quot;;
nor has the Christian Saviour hurled <EM>his</EM> Father down
into Hades. Prometheus says, in verse 930, that Zeus will be humbled
yet; as for himself: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot; . . . . such marriage he prepares<BR>
Which from his throne of power to nothingness<BR>
Shall hurl him down; so shall be all fulfilled<BR>
His father Kronos' curse . . . .<BR>
. . . . Then let him sit<BR>
Confiding in his lofty thunder-peals,<BR>
And wielding with both hands the fiery bolt;<BR>
For <I>these shall not avail, but fail he shall,</I> <BR>
<I>A fall disgraceful, </I>not to be endured . . . . &quot; (v.
980).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&quot;Dark Epaphos&quot; was the Dionysos-Sabazius, the son of
Zeus and of Demeter in the Sabasian Mysteries, during which the
&quot;father of the gods,&quot; assuming the <EM>shape of a Serpent,
</EM>begot on Demeter, Dionysos, or the solar Bacchus. Io is the
moon, and at the same time the <STRONG>E</STRONG>VE <EM>of a</EM>
<EM>new race, </EM>and so is Demeter -- in the present case. The
Promethean myth is a prophecy indeed; but it does not relate to
any of the cyclic Saviours who have appeared periodically in various
countries and among various nations, in their transitionary conditions
of evolution. It points to the last of the mysteries of cyclic
transformations, in the series of which mankind, having passed
from the ethereal to the solid physical state, from spiritual
to physiological procreation, is now carried onward on the opposite
arc of the cycle, toward that second phase of its primitive state,
when <EM>woman knew no man, </EM>and human progeny <EM>was created,</EM>
<EM>not begotten.</EM> 
<P>
That state will return to it and to the world at large, when the
latter shall discover and really appreciate the truths which underlie
this vast problem of sex. It will be like &quot;the light that
never shone on sea or land,&quot; and has to come to men through
the Theosophical Society. That light will lead on and up to the
<EM>true spiritual intuition. </EM>Then (as expressed once in
a letter to a theosophist), &quot;the world <EM>will have a race
of Buddhas and</EM> <EM>Christs, </EM>for the world will have
discovered that individuals <EM>have it in their</EM> <EM>own
powers to procreate Buddha-like children -- or demons.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>&quot;When that knowledge comes, all dogmatic religions,
and with these the demons, will die out.&quot;
<P>
If we reflect upon the serial development of the allegory, and
the character of the heroes, the mystery may be unriddled. <STRONG>K</STRONG>RONOS
is of course &quot;time&quot; in its cyclic course. He swallows
his children -- the

<P>
<EM>personal </EM>gods of exoteric dogmas included. He has swallowed
instead of Zeus, his <EM>stone </EM>idol; but the symbol has grown,
and has only developed in human fancy as mankind was cycling down
toward only its physical and intellectual -- not spiritual --
perfection. When it is as far advanced in its spiritual evolution
Kronos will be no longer deceived. Instead of the <EM>stone image
</EM>he will have swallowed the anthropomorphic fiction itself.
Because, <EM>the serpent of wisdom, </EM>represented in the Sabasian
mysteries by the anthropomorphised Logos, the unity of spiritual
and physical Powers, will have begotten in Time (Kronos) a progeny
-- Dionysos-Bacchus or the &quot;dark Epaphos,&quot; the &quot;mighty
one&quot; -- the race that will overthrow him. Where will he be
born? Prometheus traces him to his origin and birth-place in his
prophecy to Io. Io is the moon-goddess of generation -- for she
is Isis and she is Eve, the great mother.* He traces the path
of the (racial) wanderings as plainly as words can express it.
She has to quit Europe and go to Asia's continent, reaching there
the highest of the mountains of Caucasus (737), the Titan telling
her: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;When thou hast crossed the flood, limit betwixt<BR>
Two continents, fronting the burning East.&quot; (810)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
that she must travel eastward, after passing the &quot;Kimmerian
Bosphorus,&quot; and cross what is evidently the Volga and now
Astrakhan on the Caspian Sea. After this she will encounter &quot;fierce
northern blasts&quot; and cross thither to the land of the &quot;Arimaspian
host&quot; (east of Herodotus' Scythia) to --

&quot;Pluto's gold-abounding flood. . . .&quot;(825)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Which is rightly conjectured by Professor Newman to have meant
the
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* It is complained by the author of the version on, and translator
of, &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; that in this tracing of Io's
wanderings, &quot;no consistency with our known geography is attainable&quot;
(<EM>p.</EM> <EM>191, Vol. II</EM>). There may be good reason
for it. First of all it is the journey and wandering from place
to place of the <EM>race</EM> from which the &quot;tenth,&quot;
or <EM>Kalki </EM>Avatar, so called, is to issue. This he calls
the &quot;Kingly race born <EM>in Argos</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(888).
But Argos has no reference here to Argos in Greece. It comes from
<EM>Arg</EM> or<EM> arca </EM>-- the female generative power symbolised
in the moon -- the navi-formed Argha of the mysteries, meaning
the Queen of Heaven. Eustathius shows that, in the dialect of
the Arg-ians, Io signified the moon; while esotericism explains
it as the divine Androgyne, or the mystic 10; in Hebrew 10 is
the perfect number, or Jehovah. <EM>Arghya </EM>in Sanskrit is
the libation cup, the <EM>navi</EM>-form or boat-shaped vessel
in which flowers and fruit are offered to the deities. <EM>Arghyanath
</EM>is a title of the Maha-Chohan, meaning &quot;the Lord of
Libations;&quot; and <EM>Arghya Varsha -- </EM>&quot;the land
of libations&quot; -- is the mystery name of that region which
extends from Kailas mountain nearly to the Schamo Desert -- from
within which the <EM>Kalki Avatar </EM>is expected. The Airyana-Varsedya
of the Zoroastrians, as a locality, is identical with it. It is
now said to have been situated between the sea of Aral, Baltistan,
and little Tibet; but in olden times its area was far larger,
as it was the birth-place of <EM>physical </EM>humanity, of which
Io is the mother and symbol.<HR>

And here comes, between verses 825 and 835, a puzzle to all the

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;To these (Arimaspi and Grypes) approach not; a far border

The mighty rapids, where from Bybline heights<BR>
Pure draughts of sacred water Neilos sends . . . &quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
There Io was ordained to found a colony for herself and sons.
Now we must see how the passage is interpreted. As Io is told
that she has to travel eastward till she comes to the river Ethiops,
which she is to follow till it falls into the Nile -- hence the
perplexity. &quot;According to the geographical theories of the
earliest Greeks&quot; we are informed by the author of the version
on &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;This condition was fulfilled by the river Indus. Arrian
(<I>vi.</I> i.) mentions that Alexander the Great, when preparing
to sail down the Indus (having seen crocodiles in the river Indus,
and in no other river except the Nile . . . ), seemed to himself
to have discovered the sources of the Nile, as though the Nile,
rising from some place in India, and flowing through much desert
land, and thereby losing its name Indus, next . . . flowed through
inhabited land, being now called the Nile by the Ethiopians of
those parts and afterwards by the Egyptians. Virgil in the 4th
Georgic echoes the absolute error&quot; (<I>p</I>. 197, <I>Vol.
II</I>.).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Both Alexander and Virgil may have erred considerably in their
geographical notions; but the prophecy of Prometheus has not so
sinned, in the least -- not, at any rate, in its esoteric spirit.
When a certain race is symbolised, and events pertaining to its
history are rendered allegorically, no topographical accuracy
ought to be expected in the itinerary traced for its personification.
Yet it so happens, that the river &quot;Ethiops&quot; is certainly
the Indus, and it is also the <EM>Nil or Nila. It </EM>is the
river born on the <EM>Kailas</EM> (heaven) mountain, the mansion
of the gods -- 22,000<EM> </EM>feet above the level of the sea.
It was the Ethiops river -- and was so called by the Greeks, long
before the days of Alexander, because its banks, from Attock down
to Sind, were peopled by tribes generally referred to as the Eastern
Ethiopians. India and Egypt were two kindred nations, and the
Eastern Ethiopians -- the mighty builders -- have come from India,
as is pretty well proved, it is hoped, in &quot;<STRONG>I</STRONG>SIS
<STRONG>U</STRONG>NVEILED.&quot; (Vol. I. p. 569-70).
<P>
Then why could not Alexander, and even the learned Virgil have
used the word Nile or <EM>Neilos </EM>when speaking of the Indus,
since it is one of its names? To this day that river is called,
in the regions around Kala-Bagh,<EM> nil </EM>(blue), and <EM>Nilah,
</EM>&quot;the blue river.&quot; The water here is of such dark
blue colour that the name given to it from time immemorial led
to<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 418 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
a small town on its banks being called by the same name. It exists
to this day. Evidently Arrian -- who wrote far later than the
day of Alexander, and who was ignorant of the old name of the
Indus -- has unconsciously slandered the Greek conqueror. Nor
are our modern historians much wiser, in judging as they do. For
they often make the most sweeping declarations on mere appearances,
as much as their ancient colleagues ever did in days of old, when
no Encyclopaedias were yet ready for them.
<P>
The race of IO, &quot;the cow-horned maid&quot; is then simply
the first pioneer race of the AEthiopians brought by her from
the Indus to the Nile (which received its name in memory of the
mother river of the colonists from India*). For does not Prometheus
say to Io** that the sacred Neilos (the god, not the river) --
<P>
. . . &quot;He to the land, <EM>three-cornered, </EM>thee shall
guide,&quot; -- namely, to the <EM>Delta, </EM>where her sons
are foreordained to found -- . . . . . &quot;that far-off colony
. . .&quot; (<EM>v</EM>. 830 <EM>et seq</EM>.).

It is there that a new race (the Egyptians) will begin, and a

** That Io is identical allegorically with Isis and the moon is
shown by her being &quot;cow-horned.&quot; The allegory undeniably
reached Greece from India, where Vach -- &quot;the melodious cow&quot;
(Rig-Veda) &quot;from whom mankind was produced&quot; (Bhagavata
Purana) is shown in the Aitareya Brahmana as pursued by her father
Brahma, who was moved by an illicit passion, and changed her into
a deer. Hence Io, refusing to yield to Jupiter's passion, becomes
&quot;horned.&quot; The cow was in every country the symbol of
the passive generative power of nature, Isis, Vach, Venus -- the
mother of the prolific god of love, Cupid, but, at the same time,
that of the <EM>Logos </EM>whose symbol became with the Egyptians
and the Indians -- the bull -- as testified to by Apis and the
Hindu bulls in the most ancient temples. In esoteric philosophy
the cow is the symbol of creative nature, and the Bull (her calf)
the spirit which vivifies her, or &quot;the Holy Spirit,&quot;
as Mr. Kenealy shows. Hence the symbol of the horns. These were
sacred also with the Jews, who placed near the altar horns of
Shittim wood, by seizing which a criminal ensured his safety.

That the subject formed part of the Sabasian mysteries is made
known by several ancient writers: by Cicero (<EM>in Tuscul. Quaest.
I, ii. No.</EM> 20)<EM> </EM>and by Clemens Alexandrinus (<EM>Strom</EM>.
I,<EM> ii., oper. tom</EM>. 1<EM>, </EM>p. 467 -- <EM>Ed.</EM>
<EM>Potter</EM>'<EM>s</EM>).<EM> </EM>The latter writers are the
only ones who attribute the fact that AEschylus was charged by
the Athenians with sacrilege and condemned to be stoned to death,
to its true cause. They say that having been himself uninitiated,
AEschylus had profaned the Mysteries by exposing them in his trilogies
on a public stage.* But he would have incurred the same condemnation
had he been initiated -- which must have been the case, as otherwise
he must, like Socrates, have had a <EM>daimon </EM>to reveal to
him the secret and sacred allegorical drama of initiation. At
all events, it is not the &quot;father of the Greek tragedy&quot;
who invented the prophecy of Prometheus; for he only repeated
in dramatic form that which was revealed by the priests during
the MYSTERIA of the Sabasia.** The latter, however, is one of
the oldest sacred festivals, whose origin is to this day unknown
to history. Mythologists connect it through Mithras (the Sun,
called Sabasius on some old monuments) with Jupiter and Bacchus.
But it was never the property of the Greeks, but dates from days
immemorial.
<P>
The translators of the drama wonder how AEschylus could become
guilty of such &quot;discrepancy between the character of Zeus
as portrayed in the 'Prometheus Bound' and that depicted in the
remaining dramas.&quot; (<EM>Mrs. A. Swanwick.</EM>)<EM> </EM>This
is just because AEschylus, like Shakespeare, was and will ever
remain the intellectual &quot;Sphinx&quot; of the ages. Between
Zeus, the abstract deity of Grecian thought, and the Olympic Zeus,
there was an abyss. The latter represented during the mysteries
no higher a principle than the lower aspect of human physical
intelligence -- <EM>Manas </EM>wedded to <EM>Kama</EM>; Prometheus
-- its divine aspect merging into and aspiring to Buddhi -- the
divine Soul. Zeus was the human soul and nothing more, whenever
shown yielding to his lower passions, -- the <EM>jealous </EM>God,
revengeful and cruel in its egotism or <STRONG>I</STRONG>-AM-NESS.
Hence, Zeus is represented as a serpent -- the intellectual tempter
of man -- which, nevertheless, begets in the course of

* Herodotus and Pausanias supposed that the cause of the condemnation
was that AEschylus, adopting the theogony of the Egyptians, made
Diana, the daughter of Ceres, and not of Latona. (See <EM>AElian

cyclic evolution the &quot;Man-Saviour,&quot; the solar Bacchus

<P>
Dionysos is one with Osiris, with Krishna, and with Buddha (the
heavenly wise), and with the coming (tenth) Avatar, the glorified
Spiritual <EM>Christos, </EM>who will deliver the suffering <EM>Christos
</EM>(mankind, or Prometheus, on its trial). This, say Brahminical
and Buddhistic legends, echoed by the Zoroastrian and now by the
Christian teachings (the latter only occasionally), will happen
at the end of <EM>Kaliyuga. </EM>It is only after the appearance
of Kalki-Avatar, or Sosiosh, that man will be born from woman
without sin. Then will Brahma, the Hindu deity; Ahura-Mazda (Ormazd),
the Zoroastrian; Zeus, the Greco-Olympian Don Juan; Jehovah, the
jealous, repenting, cruel, tribal God of the Israelites, and all
their likes in the universal Pantheon of human fancy -- vanish
and disappear in thin air. And along with these will vanish their
shadows, <EM>the dark aspects </EM>of all those deities, ever
represented as their &quot;twin brothers&quot; and creatures,
in exoteric legend, <EM>their own reflection on </EM>earth --
in esoteric philosophy. The Ahrimans and Typhons, the Samaels
and Satans, must be all dethroned on that day, when every dark
evil passion will be subdued.
<P>
There is one eternal Law in nature, one that always tends to adjust
contraries and to produce final harmony. It is owing to this law
of spiritual development superseding the physical and purely intellectual,
that mankind will become freed from its false gods, and find itself
finally -<EM>- </EM><STRONG>SELF</STRONG><EM>-</EM><STRONG>REDEEMED</STRONG><EM>.</EM>

<P>
In its final revelation, the old myth of Prometheus -- his<EM>
proto- </EM>and <EM>anti-</EM>types being found in every ancient
theogony -- stands in each of them at the very origin of physical
evil, because at the threshold of human physical life. <STRONG>K</STRONG>RONOS
is &quot;Time,&quot; whose first law is that the order of the
successive and harmonious phases in the process of evolution during
cyclic development should be strictly preserved -- under the severe
penalty of abnormal growth with all its ensuing results. It was
not in the programme of natural development that man -- higher
animal though he may be -- should become at once -- intellectually,
spiritually, and psychically -- the demi-god he is on earth, while
his physical frame remains weaker and more helpless and ephemeral
than that of almost any huge mammal. The contrast is too grotesque
and violent; the tabernacle much too unworthy of its indwelling
god. The gift of Prometheus thus became a CURSE -- though <EM>foreknown
</EM>and <EM>foreseen </EM>by the HOST personified in that personage,
as his name well shows.* It is in this that rests, at one and
the same time,

its sin and its redemption. For the Host that incarnated in a
portion of humanity, though led to it by Karma or <EM>Nemesis,
</EM>preferred free-will to passive slavery, intellectual self-conscious
pain and even torture &quot;while myriad time shall flow&quot;
-- to inane, imbecile, instinctual beatitude. Knowing such an
incarnation was premature and not in the programme of nature,
the heavenly host, &quot;Prometheus,&quot; still sacrificed itself
to benefit thereby, at least, one portion of mankind.* But while
saving man from mental darkness, they inflicted upon him the tortures
of the self-consciousness of his responsibility -- the result
of his free will -- besides every ill to which mortal man and
flesh are heir to. This torture Prometheus accepted for himself,
since the Host became henceforward blended with the tabernacle
prepared for them, which was still unachieved at that period of
formation.
<P>
Spiritual evolution being incapable of keeping pace with the physical,
once its homogeneity was broken by the admixture, the gift thus
became the chief cause, if not the sole origin of <EM>Evil.</EM>**
The allegory which shows<STRONG> K</STRONG>RONOS cursing Zeus
for dethroning him (in the primitive &quot;golden&quot; age of
Saturn, when all men were demi-gods), and for creating a physical
race of men weak and helpless in comparison; and then as delivering
to his (Zeus') revenge the culprit, who despoiled the gods of
their prerogative of creation and who thereby raised man to their
level, intellectually and spiritually -- is highly philosophical.
In the case of Prometheus, Zeus represents the Host of the primeval
progenitors, of the PITAR, the &quot;Fathers&quot; who created
man senseless

* Mankind is obviously divided into god-informed men and lower
human creatures. The intellectual difference between the Aryan
and other civilized nations and such savages as the South Sea
Islanders, is inexplicable on any other grounds. No amount of
culture, nor generations of training amid civilization, could
raise such human specimens as the Bushmen, the Veddhas of Ceylon,
and some African tribes, to the same intellectual level as the
Aryans, the Semites, and the Turanians so called. The &quot;sacred

and without any mind; while the divine Titan stands for the Spiritual
creators, the <EM>devas </EM>who &quot;fell&quot; into generation.
The former are spiritually lower, but physically stronger, than
the &quot;Prometheans&quot;: therefore, the latter are shown conquered.
&quot;The lower Host, whose work the Titan spoiled and thus defeated
the plans of Zeus,&quot; was on this earth in its own sphere and
plane of action; whereas, the superior Host was an exile from
Heaven, who had got entangled in the meshes of matter. They (the
inferior &quot;Host&quot;) were masters of all the Cosmic and
lower titanic forces; the higher Titan possessed only the intellectual
and spiritual fire. This drama of the struggle of Prometheus with
the Olympic tyrant and despot, sensual Zeus, one sees enacted
daily within our actual mankind: the lower passions chain the
higher aspirations to the rock of matter, to generate in many
a case the vulture of sorrow, pain, and repentance. In every such
case one sees once more --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;A god . . . in fetters, anguish fraught;<BR>
The foe of Zeus, in hatred held by all. . . . &quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

as the divine Titan is moved by altruism, but the mortal man by
Selfishness and Egoism in every instance.
<P>
The modern Prometheus has now become <EM>Epi-metheus, </EM>&quot;he
who sees only after the event&quot;; because the universal philanthropy
of the former has long ago degenerated into selfishness and self-adoration.
Man will rebecome the<EM> free </EM>Titan of old, but not before
cyclic evolution has re-established the broken harmony between
the two natures -- the terrestrial and the divine; after which
he becomes impermeable to the lower titanic forces, invulnerable
in his personality, and immortal in his individuality, which cannot
happen before every animal element is eliminated from his nature.
When man understands that &quot;<EM>Deus non fecit mortem</EM>&quot;
(<EM>Sap. I., </EM>13), but that man has created it himself, he
will re-become the Prometheus before his Fall.

-- every additional information is given upon those tenets that
will be the most controverted and questioned. This work is so
heterodox, when confronted with the acknowledged standards of
theology and modern science, that no proof which tends to show
that these standards often usurp an illegal authority should be
neglected. <HR>
