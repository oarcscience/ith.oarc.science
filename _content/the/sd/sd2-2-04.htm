<STRONG>W</STRONG>HO, AND <STRONG>W</STRONG>HAT?
<P>
<STRONG>O</STRONG>UR present quarrel is exclusively with theology.
The Church enforces belief in a personal god and a personal devil,
while Occultism shows the fallacy of such a belief. And though
for the Pantheists and Occultists, as much as for the Pessimists,
Nature is no better than &quot;a comely mother, but stone cold&quot;
-- this is true only so far as regards <EM>external </EM>physical
nature. They both agree that, to the superficial observer, she
is no better than an immense slaughter-house wherein butchers
become victims, and victims executioners in their turn. It is
quite natural that the pessimistically inclined profane, once
convinced of Nature's numerous shortcomings and failures, and
especially of her autophagous propensities, should imagine this
to be the best evidence that there is no deity <EM>in abscondito
</EM>within Nature, nor anything divine in her. Nor is it less
natural that the materialist and the physicist should imagine
that everything is due to blind force and chance, and to the survival
of the <EM>strongest, </EM>even more often than of the <EM>fittest.
</EM>But the Occultists, who regard physical nature as a bundle
of most varied illusions on the plane of deceptive perceptions;
who recognise in every pain and suffering but the necessary pangs
of incessant procreation: a series of stages toward an ever-growing
perfectibility, which is visible in the silent influence of never-erring
Karma, or <EM>abstract </EM>nature -- the Occultists, we say,
view the great Mother otherwise. Woe to those who live without
suffering. Stagnation and death is the future of all that vegetates
without a change. And how can there be any change for the better
without proportionate suffering during the preceding stage? Is
it not those only who have learnt the deceptive value of earthly
hopes and the illusive allurements of external nature who are
destined to solve the great problems of life, pain, and death?
<P>
If our modern philosophers -- preceded by the medieval scholars
-- have helped themselves to more than one fundamental idea of
antiquity, theologians have built their God and his Archangels,
their Satan and his Angels, along with the Logos and his staff,
entirely out of the <EM>dramatis personae </EM>of the old heathen
Pantheons. They would have been<HR>

<P>
[[Vol. 2, Page]] 476 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.
<P>
welcome to these, had they not cunningly distorted the original
characters, perverted the philosophical meaning, and taking advantage
of the ignorance of Christendom -- the result of long ages of
mental sleep, during which humanity was permitted to think only
by proxy -- tossed every symbol into the most inextricable confusion.
One of their most sinful achievements in this direction, was the
transformation of the divine <EM>alter ego </EM>into the grotesque
Satan of their theology.
<P>
As the whole philosophy of the problem of evil hangs upon the
correct comprehension of the constitution of the <EM>inner</EM>
being of nature and man, of the divine within the animal, and
hence also the correctness of the whole system as given in these
pages, with regard to the crown piece of evolution -- <STRONG>M</STRONG>AN
-- we cannot take sufficient precautions against theological subterfuges.
When the good St. Augustine and the fiery Tertullian called the
Devil &quot;the monkey of God,&quot; this could be attributed
to the ignorance of the age they lived in. It is more difficult
to excuse our modern writers on the same ground. The translation
of Mazdean literature has afforded to the Roman Catholic writers
the pretext for proving their point in the same direction once
more. They have taken advantage of the dual nature of Ahura Mazda
in the Zend Avesta and the Vendidad, and of his Amshaspends, to
emphasize still further their wild theories. <EM>Satan is the
plagiarist and the copyist</EM> <EM>by anticipation </EM>of the
religion which came ages later. This was one of the master strokes
of the Latin Church, its best trump-card after the appearance
of Spiritualism in Europe. Though only a <EM>succes d'estime,</EM>
in general, even among those who are not interested in either
Theosophy or Spiritualism, yet the weapon is often used by the
Christian (Roman Catholic) Kabalists against the Eastern Occultists.
<P>
Now even the Materialists are quite harmless, and may be regarded
as the friends of Theosophy, when compared to some fanatical &quot;Christian&quot;
(as they call themselves, &quot;Sectarian&quot; as we call them)
Kabalists, on the Continent. These read the <EM>Zohar, </EM>not
to find in it ancient Wisdom, but to discover in its verses, by
mangling the texts and meaning, Christian dogmas, where none could
ever have been meant; and, having fished them out with the collective
help of jesuitical casuistry and learning, the supposed &quot;Kabalists&quot;
proceed to write books and to mislead less far-sighted students
of the Kabala.*
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* Such a <EM>pseudo</EM>-Kabalist was the Marquis de Mirville
in France, who, having studied the <EM>Zohar </EM>and other old
remnants of Jewish Wisdom under the &quot;Chevalier&quot; Drach,
an ancient Rabbi Kabalist converted to the Romish Church -- wrote
with his help half a dozen volumes full of slander and calumnies
against every prominent Spiritualist and Kabalist. From 1848 up
to 1860 he persecuted unrelentingly the old Count d'Ourches, one
of the earliest Eastern Occultists in France, a man the scope
of whose occult knowledge will never be appreciated correctly
by his survivors, because he screened his real beliefs and knowledge
under the mask of Spiritism.<HR>

[[Vol. 2, Page]] 477 THE GENESIS OF THE DEVIL.
<P>
May we not then be permitted to drag the deep rivers of the Past,
and thus bring to the surface the root idea that led to the transformation
of the Wisdom-God, who had first been regarded as the creator
of everything that exists, into an Angel of Evil -- a ridiculous
horned biped, half goat and half monkey, with hoofs and a tail?
We need not go out of the way to compare the pagan demons of either
Egypt, India, or Chaldea with the devil of Christianity, for no
such comparison is possible. But we may stop to glance at the
biography of the Christian Devil, a piratical reprint from the
Chaldeo-Judaean mythology: --
<P>
The primitive origin of this personification rests upon the Akkadian
conception of the cosmic powers -- the Heavens and the Earth --
in eternal feud and struggle with Chaos. Their Silik-Muludag,
&quot;the God amongst all the Gods,&quot; the &quot;merciful guardian
of men on Earth,&quot; was the Son of Hea (or Ea) the great God
of Wisdom, called by the Babylonians Nebu. With both peoples --
as in the case of the Hindu gods -- their deities were both beneficent
and maleficent. As Evil and punishment are the agents of Karma,
in an absolutely just retributive sense, so Evil was the servant
of the good (Hibbert Lect. 1887, pp. 101-115). The reading of
the Chaldeo-Assyrian tiles has now demonstrated it beyond a shadow
of doubt. We find the same idea in the Zohar. Satan was a Son,
and an Angel of God. With all the Semitic nations, the Spirit
of the Earth was as much the Creator in his own realm as the Spirit
of the Heavens. They were twin brothers and interchangeable in
their functions, when not two in one. Nothing of that which we
find in Genesis is absent from the Chaldeo-Assyrian religious
beliefs, even in the little that has hitherto been deciphered.
The great &quot;Face of the Deep&quot; of Genesis is traced in
the <EM>Tohu-bohu,</EM> &quot;Deep,&quot; &quot;Primeval Space,&quot;
or Chaos of the Babylonians. Wisdom (the Great Unseen God) --
called in <EM>Genesis </EM>chap. i. the &quot;Spirit of God&quot;
-- lived, for the older Babylonians as for the Akkadians, in the
<EM>Sea of Space. </EM>Toward the days described by Berosus, this
sea became the visible waters <EM>on the face of the Earth</EM>
-- the<EM> </EM>crystalline abode of the great mother, the mother
of Ea and all the gods, which became, still later, the great Dragon
Tiamat, the Sea Serpent. Its last stage of development was the
great struggle of Bel with the Dragon -- the Devil!
<P>
Whence the Christian idea that God cursed the Devil? The God of
the Jews, whomsoever he was, forbids cursing Satan. Philo Judaeus
and Josephus both state that the Law (the Pentateuch and the Talmud)
undeviatingly forbid one to curse the adversary, as also the gods
of the gentiles. &quot;Thou shalt not revile the gods,&quot; quoth
the god of Moses (Exodus xxii. 28), for it is God who &quot;hath
divided (them) unto all nations&quot; (Deut. iv. 19); and those
who speak evil of<HR>

<P>
[[Vol. 2, Page]] 478 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.
<P>
&quot;Dignities&quot; (gods) are called &quot;<EM>filthy</EM>
dreamers&quot; by Jude (8). For even Michael the Archangel durst
not bring against him (the devil) a railing accusation, but said:
&quot;The Lord rebuke thee&quot; (<EM>ibid </EM>9). Finally the
same is repeated in the Talmud.* &quot;Satan appeared one day
to a man who used to curse him daily, and said to him: 'Why dost
thou this?' Consider that <EM>God himself </EM>would not curse
me, but merely said: 'The Lord rebuke thee, Satan.' &quot;**
<P>
This bit of Talmudic information shows plainly two things: (<EM>a</EM>)
that St. Michael is called &quot;God&quot; in the Talmud, and
somebody else &quot;the Lord&quot;; and (<EM>b</EM>) that Satan
is <EM>a God, </EM>of whom even the &quot;Lord&quot; is in fear.
All we read in the Zohar and other Kabalistic works on Satan shows
plainly that this &quot;personage&quot; is simply the personification
of the abstract evil, which is the weapon of Karmic law and <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA.
It is our human nature and man himself, as it is said that &quot;Satan
is always near and inextricably interwoven with man.&quot; It
is only a question of that Power being latent or active in us.
<P>
It is a well-known fact -- to learned Symbologists at all events
-- that in every great religion of antiquity, it is the Logos
Demiurge (the second logos), or the first emanation from the mind
(Mahat), who is made to strike, so<EM> </EM>to say, the key-note
of that which may be called the correlation of individuality and
personality in the subsequent scheme of evolution. The Logos it
is, who is shown in the mystic symbolism of cosmogony, theogony,
and anthropogony, playing two parts in the drama of Creation and
Being, <EM>i.e</EM>., that of the purely human personality and
the divine impersonality of the so-called Avatars, or divine incarnations,
and of the universal Spirit, called Christos by the Gnostics,
and the Farvarshi (or <EM>Ferouer) </EM>of Ahura Mazda in the
Mazdean philosophy. On the lower rungs of theogony the celestial
Beings of lower Hierarchies had each a <EM>Farvarshi, </EM>or
a celestial &quot;Double.&quot; It is the same, only a still more
mystic, reassertion of the Kabalistic axiom, <EM>&quot;Deus est
Demon inversus&quot;; </EM>the word &quot;demon,&quot; however,
as in the case of Socrates, and in the spirit of the meaning given
to it by the whole of antiquity, standing for the guardian Spirit,
an &quot;Angel,&quot; not a devil of Satanic descent, as theology
will have it. The Roman Catholic Church shows its usual logic
and consistency by accepting, as the <EM>ferouer </EM>of Christ,
St. Michael, who was &quot;his Angel Guardian,&quot; as <EM>proved
</EM>by St. Thomas,*** while he calls the prototypes of Michael
and his synonyms, such as Mercury, for example, devils

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 479 GOD AND DEVIL, BOTH METATRONS.</H6>

<P>
The Church accepts positively the tenet that Christ has his <EM>Ferouer</EM>
as any other god or mortal has. Writes de Mirville: &quot;Here
we have the two heroes of the Old Testament, the <EM>Verbum</EM>
(?),<EM> </EM>or the <EM>second</EM> Jehovah, and his <EM>face
</EM>('Presence,' as the Protestants translate) forming both but
one, and yet being two, a mystery which seemed to us unsolvable
before we had studied the doctrine of the Mazdean <EM>ferouers,</EM>
and learnt that the <EM>ferouer </EM>was the spiritual potency,
at once <EM>image,</EM> <EM>face, </EM>and the <EM>guardian </EM>of
the Soul which finally assimilates the <EM>ferouer.&quot;</EM><I>
</I>(<EM>Memoires a l'Academie, </EM>Vol. v., p. 516.) This is
<EM>almost </EM>correct.
<P>
Among other absurdities, the Kabalists maintain that the word
<EM>metatron </EM>being divided into [[<EM>meta</EM>, <EM>thronon</EM>]],
means <EM>near the throne. </EM>It means quite the reverse, as
meta means &quot;beyond&quot; and not &quot;near.&quot; This is
of great importance in our argument. St. Michael, then, the <EM>quis
ut</EM> <EM>Deus, </EM>is the translator, so to speak, of the
invisible world into the visible and the objective.
<P>
They maintain, furthermore, along with the Roman Catholic Church,
that in the Biblical and Christian theology there does not exist
a &quot;higher celestial personality, after the Trinity, than
that of the Archangel or the Seraphim, <EM>Michael</EM>.&quot;
According to them, the conqueror of the Dragon is &quot;the archisatrap
of the sacred militia, the guardian of the planets, the King of
the Stars, the slayer of Satan and the most powerful Rector.&quot;
In the mystic astronomy of these gentlemen, he is &quot;the conqueror
of Ahriman, who having upset the sidereal throne of the usurper,
bathes in his stead in the solar fires&quot;; and, defender of
the Christ-Sun, he approaches so near his Master, &quot;that he
seems to become one with him . . . . Owing to this fusion with
the <STRONG>W</STRONG>ORD (<EM>Verbum</EM>)<EM> </EM>the Protestants,
and among them Calvin, ended by losing sight entirely of the duality,
and saw no Michael but only his Master,&quot; writes the Abbe
Caron. The Roman Catholics, and especially their Kabalists, know
better; and it is they who explain to the world this duality,
which affords to them the means of glorifying the chosen ones
of the Church, and of rejecting and anathematizing all those Gods
who may be in the way of their dogmas.
<P>
Thus the same titles and the same names are given in turn to God
and the Archangel. Both are called <EM>Metatron, </EM>&quot;both
have the name of Jehovah applied to them when they speak <EM>one
in the other&quot; (sic) </EM>as, according to the <EM>Zohar,
</EM>the term signifies equally &quot;the Master and the Ambassador.&quot;
Both are the <EM>Angel of the Face, </EM>because, as we are informed,
if, on the one hand, the &quot;Word&quot; is called &quot;the
face (or the Presence) and the image of the substance of God,&quot;
on the other, &quot;when
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

speaking of the <EM>Saviour </EM>to the Israelites, Isaiah (?)
tells them that &quot;the angel of his presence saved them in
their affliction&quot; -- &quot;so he was their Saviour.&quot;*
Elsewhere he (Michael) is called very plainly &quot;the Prince
of the <EM>Faces </EM>of the Lord, the <EM>glory </EM>of the Lord.&quot;
Both (Jehovah and Michael) are &quot;the <EM>guides </EM>of Israel**
. . . chiefs of the <EM>armies </EM>of the Lord, <EM>Supreme Judges
</EM>of the souls and even Seraphs.&quot;***
<P>
The whole of the above is given on the authority of various works
by Roman Catholics, and must, therefore, be orthodox. Some expressions
are translated to show what subtle theologians and casuists mean
by the term Ferouer,**** a word borrowed by some French writers
from the <EM>Zend Avesta, </EM>as said, and utilized in Roman
Catholicism for a purpose Zoroaster was very far from anticipating.
In Fargard <STRONG>XIX</STRONG>. of the <EM>Vendidad </EM>it is
said (verse 14), &quot;Invoke, O Zarathustra! my Farvarshi, who
am Ahura Mazda, the greatest, the best, the fairest of all beings,
the most solid, the most intelligent, . . . . and whose soul is
the Holy Word&quot; (Mathra Spenta). The French Orientalists translate
<EM>Farvarshi</EM> by<EM> &quot;Ferouer.&quot;</EM> 
<P>
Now what is a Ferouer, or Farvarshi? In some Mazdean works (<I>e.g</I>.,
Ormazd Ahriman, &#167;&#167; 112, 113), it is plainly implied
that Farvarshi is the <I>inner</I>, immortal man (or that <EM>Ego
</EM>which reincarnates); that it existed before its physical
body and survives all such it happens to be clothed in. &quot;Not
only man was endowed with the Farvarshi, <EM>but gods</EM> <EM>too,
</EM>and the sky, fire, waters, and plants.&quot; (Introduction
to the <EM>Vendidad, </EM>by J. Darmesteter). This shows as plainly
as can be shown that the<EM> ferouer </EM>is the &quot;spiritual
counterpart&quot; of whether god, animal, plant, or even element,
<I>i.e</I>., the refined and the <EM>purer</EM> part of the grosser
creation, the soul of the body, whatever the body may happen to
be. Therefore does Ahura Mazda recommend Zarathustra to invoke
his <EM>Farvarshi </EM>and not himself (Ahura-Mazda); that is
to say, the impersonal and <EM>true </EM>Essence of Deity, <EM>one
with Zoroaster's own Atman </EM>(or Christos), not the <EM>false
</EM>and personal appearance. This is quite clear.
<P>
Now it is on this divine and ethereal prototype that the Roman
Catholics seized so as to build up the supposed difference between
their god and angels, and the deity and its aspects, or the gods
of the old religions. Thus, while calling Mercury, Venus, Jupiter
(whether as gods or planets) <STRONG>D</STRONG>EVILS, they yet
make of the same Mercury the <EM>ferouer</EM> of their Christ.
This fact is undeniable. Vossius (<EM>De Idol., </EM><STRONG>II</STRONG>.,

proves that Michael is the Mercury of the <EM>pagans, </EM>and
Maury and other French writers corroborate him, and add that &quot;according
to great theologians <EM>Mercury and the Sun are one,&quot; </EM>(?)
and no wonder, they think, since &quot;Mercury being so near the
Wisdom of the <EM>Verbum </EM>(the Sun), must be absorbed by and
confounded with him.&quot;
<P>
This &quot;pagan&quot; view was accepted from the first century
of our era, as shown in the ORIGINAL <EM>Acts of the Apostles
</EM>(the English translation being worthless). So much is Michael
the Mercury of the Greeks and other nations, that when the inhabitants
of Lystra mistook Paul and Barnabas for Mercury and Jupiter --
&quot;the gods have come down to us in the likeness of men,&quot;
-- verse 12 (xiv.) adds: &quot;And they called Barnabas Zeus,
and Paul, Hermes (or Mercury), because he was the <EM>leader of
the </EM>WORD<EM> (Verbum),</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>and not &quot;the
chief speaker,&quot; as erroneously translated in the authorised,
and repeated even in the revised, English Bible. Michael is the
angel in the Vision, the Son of God, &quot;who was like unto a
Son of Man.&quot; It is the Hermes-Christos of the Gnostics, the
Anubis-Syrius of the Egyptians, the Counsellor of Osiris in <EM>Amenti,
</EM>the Michael <EM>leontoid </EM>[[<EM>ophiomorphos</EM>]] of
the Ophites, who wears on certain Gnostic jewels a lion <EM>head,
</EM>like his father Ildabaoth. (See King's<EM> Gnostics</EM>.)
<P>
Now to all this the Roman Catholic Church consents tacitly, many
of her writers avowing it publicly. And, unable to deny the flagrant
&quot;borrowing&quot; of their Church, who &quot;spoilt&quot;
the symbols of her seniors, as the Jews had &quot;spoilt&quot;
the Egyptians of their jewels of silver and gold, they explain
the fact quite coolly and as seriously. Thus the writers who were
hitherto <EM>timid</EM> enough to see, in this repetition by Christian
dogmas of old Pagan ideas, &quot;a <EM>legendary plagiarism </EM>perpetrated
by man,&quot; are gravely assured that, far from such a simple
solution of the almost perfect resemblance, it has to be attributed
to quite another cause: &quot;to a <EM>prehistorical </EM>plagiarism,
of a <EM>superhuman </EM>origin.&quot;
<P>
If the reader would know how, he must kindly turn to the same
fifth volume of de Mirville's work. Please note that this author
was the <EM>official and recognised defender </EM>of the Roman
Church, and was helped by the learning of all the Jesuits. On
page 518 we read: --
<P>
&quot;We have pointed out several demi-gods, and also very historical
heroes of the pagans, who were predestined from the moment of
their birth, <EM>to ape while dishonouring it, </EM>the nativity
of the hero, <EM>who was quite</EM> <EM>God, </EM>before whom
the whole earth had to bow; we traced them being born as <EM>he
</EM>was, from an immaculate mother; we saw them strangling serpents
in their cradles, fighting against demons, performing miracles,
dying as martyrs, descending to the nether world and rising again
from the dead. And we have bitterly deplored that timid and shy
Christians should feel compelled to explain all such identities
on the ground of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 482 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
coincidence of myth and symbol. They forgot apparently these words
of the Saviour: '<STRONG>A</STRONG>LL THAT CAME BEFORE ME ARE
THIEVES AND ROBBERS,' a word which explains all without any absurd
negation and which I commented in these words 'The Evangel is
a sublime drama, <EM>parodied</EM> <EM>and played before its appointed
time by ruffians.</EM>' &quot;
<P>
The &quot;ruffians&quot; (<EM>les droles</EM>)<EM>, </EM>are of
course <EM>demons </EM>whose manager is Satan. Now this is the
easiest and the most sublime and simple way of getting out of
the difficulty! The Rev. Dr. Lundy, a Protestant de Mirville,
followed the happy suggestion in his &quot;Monumental Christianity,&quot;
and so did Dr. Sepp of Munich in his works written to prove the
divinity of Jesus and the Satanic origin of all other Saviours.
So much greater the pity that a systematic and collective plagiarism,
which went on for several centuries on the most gigantic scale,
should be explained by another plagiarism, this time in the fourth
Gospel. For the sentence quoted from it, &quot;All that ever came
before me, etc.,&quot; is a <EM>verbatim </EM>repetition of words
written in the &quot;Book of Enoch&quot; lxxxix. In the <EM>Introduction
</EM>to Archbishop Lawrence's translation of it from an Ethiopic
<STRONG>MS</STRONG>. in the Bodleian Library, the editor, author
of the &quot;Evolution of Christianity,&quot; remarks: --
<P>
&quot;In revising the proof-sheets of the Book of Enoch . . .
. . the parable of the sheep, rescued by the good Shepherd from
hireling guardians and ferocious wolves, <EM>is obviously borrowed
by the fourth</EM> <EM>Evangelist </EM>from Enoch, lxxxix., in
which the author depicts the shepherds as killing . . . the sheep
before the advent of their Lord, and thus discloses the true meaning
of that hitherto mysterious passage in the Johannine parable --
'All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers' -- language
in which we now detect an obvious reference to the allegorical
shepherds of Enoch.&quot;
<P>
It is too late in the day to claim that it is Enoch who borrowed
from the New Testament, instead of <EM>vice versa. </EM>Jude (14-15)
quotes <I>verbatim</I> from Enoch a long passage about the coming
of the Lord with his 10,000 saints, and naming specifically the
prophet, <EM>acknowledges</EM> the source. This &quot;parallelism
between prophet and apostle, have placed beyond controversy that,
<EM>in the eyes of the author of an Epistle accepted</EM> <EM>as
divine revelation, </EM>the Book of Enoch <EM>was the inspired
production of an</EM> <EM>antediluvian patriarch . </EM>. . &quot;
and further &quot; . . . the cumulative coincidence of language
and ideas in Enoch and the authors of <STRONG>N.T</STRONG>. Scripture,
. . . clearly indicates that the work of the Semitic Milton was
the inexhaustible source from which Evangelists and Apostles,
or the men who wrote in their names, borrowed their conceptions
of the resurrection, judgment, immortality, perdition, and of
the universal reign of righteousness under the eternal dominion
of the Son of Man. This <EM>Evangelical</EM> <EM>plagiarism </EM>culminates
in the Revelation of John, which adapts the visions<HR>

<P>
of Enoch to Christianity, with modifications in which we miss
the sublime simplicity of the great Master of apocalyptic <EM>prediction</EM><I>,</I>
who prophesied in the name of the antediluvian Patriarch.&quot;
(<STRONG>I</STRONG>NT. xxxv.)
<P>
&quot;Antediluvian,&quot; truly; but if the phraseology of the
text dates hardly a few centuries or even millenniums before the
historical era, then it is no more the original <EM>prediction
</EM>of the events to come, but, in its turn, a copy of some scripture
of a prehistoric religion. . . . . &quot;In the Krita age, Vishnu,
in the form of Kapila and other (inspired sages) . . . imparts
to the world true wisdom as Enoch did. In the Treta age he restrains
the wicked, in the form of a universal monarch (the Chakravartin
or the 'Everlasting King' of Enoch*) and protects the three worlds
(or races). In the Dwapara age, in the person of Veda-Vyasa, he
divides the one Veda into four, and distributes it into hundreds
(<EM>Sata</EM>) of branches.&quot; Truly so; the <EM>Veda </EM>of
the earliest Aryans, before it was written, went forth into every
nation of the Atlanto-Lemurians, and sowed the first seeds of
all the now existing old religions. The off-shoots of the never
dying tree of wisdom have scattered their dead leaves even on

Vishnu, or the &quot;Everlasting King&quot; will appear as Kalki,
and re-establish righteousness upon earth. The minds of those
who live at that time shall be awakened, and become as pellucid
as crystal. &quot;The men who are thus changed by virtue of that

Thus it is pretty well established that Christ, the Logos, or
the God in Space and the Saviour on Earth, is but one of the echoes
of the same antediluvian and sorely misunderstood Wisdom. The
history begins by the descent on Earth of the &quot;Gods&quot;
who incarnate in mankind, and this is the <STRONG>F</STRONG>ALL.
Whether Brahma hurled down on Earth in the allegory by Bhagavant,
or Jupiter by Kronos, all are the symbols of the human races.

the fall of a God into generation. Nowhere is the metaphysical
truth more clear, when explained esoterically, or more hidden
from the average comprehension of those who instead of appreciating
the sublimity of the idea can only degrade, than in the <EM>Upanishads,
</EM>the esoteric glossaries of the Vedas. The Rig-Veda, as Guignault
characterized it, &quot;is the most sublime conception of the
great highways of Humanity.&quot; The Vedas are, and will remain
for ever, in the esotericism of the Vedanta and the Upanishads,
&quot;the mirror of the eternal Wisdom.&quot;
<P>
For over sixteen centuries the new masks, forced on the faces
of the old gods, have screened them from public curiosity, but
they have finally proved a misfit. Yet the metaphorical <STRONG>F</STRONG>ALL,
and as metaphorical atonement and crucifixion, led Western Humanity
through roads knee-deep in blood. Worse than all, they led it
to believe in the dogma of the evil spirit distinct from the spirit
of all good, whereas the former lives in all matter and pre-eminently
in man. Finally it created the God-slandering dogma of Hell and
eternal perdition; it spread a thick film between the higher intuitions
of man and divine verities; and, most pernicious result of all,
it made people remain ignorant of the fact that there were no
fiends, no dark demons in the Universe before man's own appearance
on this, and probably on other earths. Henceforth the people were
led to accept, as the problematical consolation for this world's
sorrows, the thought of original sin.
<P>
The philosophy of that law in Nature, which implants in man as
well as in every beast a passionate, inherent, and instinctive
desire for freedom and self-guidance, pertains to psychology and
cannot be touched on now. To show the feeling in higher Intelligences,
to analyse and give a natural reason for it, would necessitate,
moreover, an endless philosophical explanation for which there
is no room here. Perhaps, the best synthesis of this feeling is
found in three lines of Milton's<EM> Paradise Lost. </EM>Says
the &quot;Fallen One&quot;: --

<P>
We have said elsewhere that the dogma of the first <EM>Fall </EM>rested
on a few verses in <EM>Revelation; </EM>these verses being now
shown a plagiarism from Enoch by some scholars. These grew into
endless theories and speculations, which gradually acquired the
importance of dogma and inspired tradition. Every one wanted to
explain the verse about the seven-headed dragon with his ten horns
and seven crowns, whose tail<HR>

may be learned in the <EM>Addenda </EM>which close Part <STRONG>III</STRONG>.
of this Volume.
<P>
From Newton to Bossuet speculations were incessantly evolved in
Christian brains with regard to these obscure verses. . . . .
&quot;The star that falls, is the heresiarch Theodosius&quot;
. . . . explains Bossuet. &quot;The clouds of smoke, are the heresies
of the Montanists. . . . . The third part of the stars, are the
martyrs, and especially the doctors of divinity. . . . .&quot;
<P>
Bossuet ought to have known, however, that the events described
in <EM>Revelation </EM>were not original, and may, as shown, be
found in other and pagan traditions. There were no scholastics
nor Montanists during Vedic times, nor yet far later in China.
But Christian <EM>theology </EM>had to be <EM>protected and saved.</EM>

<P>
This was only natural. But why should truth be sacrificed in order
to protect from destruction the lucubrations of Christian theologians?
<P>
The<EM> princeps aeris hujus, </EM>the &quot;prince of the air&quot;
of St. Paul, is not the devil, but the effects of the astral light,
as Eliphas Levi correctly explains. The Devil is not &quot;the
God <EM>of this period,&quot; </EM>as he says, for it is the deity
of every age and period, since man appeared on earth, and matter,
in its countless forms and states, had to fight for its evanescent
existence against other disintegrating Forces.
<P>
The &quot;Dragon&quot; is simply the symbol of the cycle and of
the &quot;Sons of Manvantaric Eternity,&quot; who had descended
on earth during a certain epoch of its formative period. The &quot;clouds
of smoke&quot; are a geological phenomenon. The &quot;third part
of the stars of heaven&quot; cast down to the earth -- refers
to the divine Monads, (the Spirits of the Stars in Astrology)
that circumambulate our globe; <EM>i.e.</EM>, the<EM> human </EM>Egos
destined to perform the whole cycle of incarnations. This sentence,
<EM>qui</EM> <EM>circumambulat terram</EM>, however, is again
referred to the <STRONG>D</STRONG>EVIL in theology, the mythical
father of Evil being said to &quot;fall like lightning.&quot;
Unfortunately for this interpretation, the &quot;Son of Man,&quot;
or Christ, is expected, on the personal testimony of Jesus, to
descend on earth likewise, &quot;As the lightning cometh out of
the East,&quot;* just in the same shape and under the same symbol
as Satan, who is seen &quot;as lightning to fall from heaven.&quot;**
All these metaphors and figures of speech, pre-eminently Oriental
in their character, must have their origin searched for in the
East. In all the ancient cosmogonies <I>light </I>comes from <EM>darkness.
</EM>In Egypt, as elsewhere, <EM>darkness </EM>was &quot;the

principle of all things.&quot; Hence Pymander, the &quot;Thought
<EM>divine</EM>,&quot; issues as <EM>light </EM>from DARKNESS.
<EM>Behemoth* </EM>is the principle of Darkness, or <EM>Satan,
</EM>in Roman Catholic Theology, and yet Job says of him that
&quot;Behemoth is the chief (principle) of the ways of God&quot;
(xl. 19) -- <EM>&quot;Principium viarum Domini Behemoth!&quot;</EM><I>
</I>
<P>
Consistency does not seem to be a favourite virtue in any portion
of divine Revelation, so-called -- not as interpreted by theologians,
at any rate.
<P>
The Egyptians and the Chaldeans referred the birth of their <EM>divine</EM>
<EM>Dynasties </EM>to that period when creative Earth was in her
last final throes, in giving birth to her prehistoric mountain
ranges, which have since disappeared, her seas and her continents.
Her face was covered with &quot;deep Darkness and in that (Secondary)
Chaos was the principle of all things&quot; that developed on
the globe later on. And our geologists have ascertained that there
was such a terrestrial conflagration in the early geological periods,
several hundred millions of years ago.** As to the tradition itself,
every country and nation had it, each under its respective national
form.
<P>
It is not alone Egypt, Greece, Scandinavia or Mexico, that had
their Typhon, Python, Loki and its &quot;falling&quot; Demon,
but China, also. The Celestials have a whole literature upon the
subject. In <EM>King, </EM>it is said that in consequence of a
rebellion against <EM>Ti</EM> of a proud Spirit who said he was
<EM>Ti</EM> himself, seven choirs of celestial spirits were exiled
upon earth, which <EM>&quot;brought a change in all nature, </EM>heaven
itself <EM>bending</EM> down and uniting with earth.&quot;
<P>
And in the &quot;Y-King,&quot; one reads: &quot;The flying Dragon,
superb and rebellious, suffers now, and his pride is punished;
he thought he would reign in heaven, he reigns only on the earth.&quot;
<P>
Again, the <EM>Tchoon-Tsieoo </EM>says allegorically: &quot;one
night the stars ceased shining in darkness, and deserted it, falling
down like rain upon the earth, <EM>where they are now hidden.&quot;
</EM>These stars are the Monads.
<P>
Chinese cosmogonies have their &quot;Lord of the Flame&quot; and
their &quot;Celestial Virgin,&quot; with little &quot;Spirits
to help and minister to her; and big Spirits to fight those who
are the enemies of other gods.&quot; But all this does not prove
that the said allegories are <EM>presentments </EM>or <EM>prophetic
</EM>writings which all refer to Christian theology.
<P>
The best proof one can offer to Christian Theologians that the

<P>
esoteric meaning in the Bible -- in both Testaments -- was the
assertion of the same idea as in our Archaic teachings -- to wit,
that the &quot;Fall of the Angels&quot; referred simply to the
incarnation of angels &quot;who had broken through the Seven Circles&quot;
-- is found in the <EM>Zohar. </EM>Now the Kabala of Simeon Ben
Iochai is the soul and essence of its allegory, as the later <EM>Christian</EM>
Kabala<EM> </EM>is the &quot;dark cloaked&quot; Mosaic Pentateuch.
And it says (in the Agrippa <STRONG>MSS</STRONG>.):
<P>
&quot;The wisdom of the Kabala rests in the science of the equilibrium
and Harmony.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Forces that manifest without having been first equilibrized
perish in space&quot; (&quot;equilibrized&quot; meaning differentiated).
<P>
&quot;Thus perished the first Kings (the Divine Dynasties) of
the ancient world, the <EM>self-produced </EM>Princes of giants.
They fell like rootless trees, and were seen no more: for <EM>they
were the Shadow of the Shadow</EM>&quot;<EM>; </EM>to wit, the
<EM>chhaya </EM>of the Shadowy Pitris. (<I>Vide</I> about the
&quot;Kings of Edom.&quot;)
<P>
&quot;But those that came after them, who shooting down like falling
stars were enshrined in the shadows -- prevailed and to this day&quot;:
Dhyanis, who by incarnating in those &quot;empty shadows,&quot;
inaugurated the era of mankind.
<P>
Every sentence in the ancient cosmogonies, unfolds to him who
can read between the lines the identity of the ideas, though under
different garbs.
<P>
The first lesson taught in Esoteric philosophy is, that the incognizable
Cause does not put forth evolution, whether consciously or unconsciously,
but only exhibits periodically <EM>different aspects of itself</EM>
to the perception of <EM>finite </EM>Minds. Now the collective
Mind -- the Universal -- composed of various and numberless Hosts
of Creative Powers, however infinite in manifested Time, is still
finite when contrasted with the unborn and undecaying Space in
its supreme essential aspect. That which is finite cannot be perfect.
Therefore there are inferior Beings among those Hosts, but there
never were any <EM>devils </EM>or &quot;disobedient Angels,&quot;
for the simple reason that they are all governed by Law. The<EM>
Asuras </EM>who incarnated (call them by any other name), followed
in this a law as implacable as any other. They had manifested
prior to the Pitris, and as time (in Space) proceeds in Cycles,
their turn had come -- hence the numerous allegories <EM>(Vide
&quot;Demon est Deus inversus,&quot;</EM> Part <STRONG>II</STRONG>.,
Vol. I.). The name of <EM>Asura </EM>was first given by the Brahmans
indiscriminately to those who opposed their mummeries and sacrifices,
as the great <EM>Asura </EM>called &quot;Asurendra&quot; did.
It is to those ages, probably, that the origin of the idea of
the demon, as opposer and adversary, has to be traced.
<P>
The Hebrew Elohim, called in the translations &quot;God,&quot;
and who create &quot;light,&quot; are identical with the Aryan
Asuras. They are also<HR>

<P>
[[Vol. 2, Page]] 488 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.
<P>
referred to as the &quot;Sons of Darkness&quot; as a philosophical
and logical contrast to light immutable and eternal. The earliest
Zoroastrians did not believe in Evil or Darkness being <EM>co-eternal
</EM>with Good or Light, and they give the same interpretation.
Ahriman is the manifested <EM>shadow</EM> of <STRONG>A</STRONG>HURA-MAZDA
<EM>(Asura-mazda), </EM>himself issued from <EM>Zeruana Akerne</EM>
&quot;boundless (circle of) Time&quot; or the Unknown Cause. &quot;Its
glory,&quot; they say of the latter, &quot;is too exalted, its
light too resplendent for either human intellect or mortal eye
to grasp and see.&quot; Its primal emanation <EM>is eternal light,
which, from having been previously concealed in </EM><STRONG>D</STRONG>ARKNESS<EM>
was called to manifest itself and thus was formed Ormazd, the</EM>
<EM>&quot;King of Life.&quot; </EM>He is the &quot;first-born&quot;
in BOUNDLESS TIME, but, like his own antitype (pre-existing Spiritual
idea), <EM>has lived within darkness from</EM> <EM>all eternity.
</EM>The six Amshaspends (seven with himself, chief of all), the
<EM>primitive Spiritual Angels and Men </EM>are <EM>collectively
his Logos. </EM>The Zoroastrian Amshaspends create the world in
six days or periods also, and rest on the Seventh; whereas that
<EM>Seventh </EM>is the <EM>first </EM>period or &quot;day,&quot;
in esoteric philosophy, (<EM>Primary </EM>creation in the Aryan
cosmogony). It is that intermediate AEon which is the <EM>Prologue
</EM>to creation, and which stands on the borderland between the
uncreated eternal Causation and the produced finite effects; a
state of <EM>nascent </EM>activity and energy as the first aspect
of the eternal immutable Quiescence. In <EM>Genesis, </EM>on which
no metaphysical energy has been spent, but only an extraordinary
acuteness and ingenuity to veil the esoteric Truth, &quot;Creation&quot;
begins at the third stage of manifestation. &quot;God&quot; or
the <EM>Elohim </EM>are the &quot;Seven Regents&quot; of Pymander.
They are identical with all the other Creators.
<P>
But even in Genesis that <EM>period </EM>is hinted at by the abruptness
of the picture, and the <EM>&quot;darkness&quot; </EM>that was
on the face of the deep. The <EM>Alahim </EM>are shown to &quot;create&quot;
-- that is to say, to build or to produce the two or &quot;double
heaven&quot; (<EM>not</EM> Heaven and Earth); which means, in
so many words, that they separated the upper manifested (angelic)
heaven, or plane of consciousness, from the lower or terrestrial
plane; the (to us) eternal and immutable <EM>AEons</EM> from those
periods that are in space, time and duration; Heaven from Earth,
the unknown from the KNOWN -- to the profane. Such is the meaning
of the sentence in Pymander, which says that: &quot;<STRONG>T</STRONG>HOUGHT,
the divine, which is <STRONG>L</STRONG>IGHT and <STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE
(Zeruana Akerne) produced through its <STRONG>W</STRONG>ORD, or
first aspect,&quot; the <EM>other, operating </EM><STRONG>T</STRONG>HOUGHT,
which being the god of Spirit and Fire, constructed <EM>seven
Regents </EM>enclosing within their circle the world of Senses,
named &quot;fatal destiny.&quot; The latter refers to Karma; the
&quot;seven circles&quot; are the seven planets and planes, as
also the seven invisible Spirits, in the angelic spheres, whose
visible symbols are the seven planets,* the
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Another proof, if any were needed, that the ancient Initiates
knew of more than seven planets is to be found in the Vishnu Purana,

seven <EM>Rishis </EM>of the great Bear and other glyphs. As said
of the Adityas by Roth: &quot;they are neither sun, nor moon,
nor stars, nor dawn, but the eternal sustainers of this luminous
life which exists as it were behind all these phenomena.&quot;
<P>
It is they -- the &quot;Seven Hosts&quot; -- who, having &quot;considered
in their Father (<I>divine</I> Thought) the plan of the operator,&quot;
as says Pyrnander, <EM>desired </EM>to operate (or build the world
with its creatures) likewise; for, having been born <EM>&quot;within
</EM>the sphere of operation&quot; -- the manifesting Universe
-- such is the Manvantaric <STRONG>L</STRONG>AW. And now comes
the second portion of the passage, or rather of two passages merged
into one to conceal the full meaning. Those who were born within
the sphere of operation were &quot;the brothers who loved him
well.&quot; The latter -- the &quot;him&quot; -- were the primordial
angels: the Asuras, the Ahriman, the Elohim -- or &quot;Sons of
God,&quot; of whom <EM>Satan </EM>was one -- all those spiritual
beings who were called the &quot;Angels of Darkness,&quot; because
that darkness is <EM>absolute </EM>light, a fact now neglected
if not entirely forgotten in theology. Nevertheless, the spirituality
of those much abused &quot;Sons of Light&quot; which is Darkness,
must be evidently as great in comparison with that of the Angels
next in order, as the ethereality of the latter would be, when
contrasted with the density of the human body. The former are
the &quot;First-born&quot;; therefore so near to the confines
of pure quiescent Spirit as to be merely the &quot;PRIVATIONS&quot;
-- in the Aristotelian sense -- the <EM>ferouers </EM>or the ideal
types of those who followed. They could not create material, <EM>corporeal</EM>
<EM>things; </EM>and, therefore, were said in process of time
to <EM>have refused to</EM> create, as <EM>commanded by </EM>&quot;<EM>God</EM>&quot;
-- otherwise, TO HAVE REBELLED.
<P>
Perchance, this is justified on that principle of the <EM>Scientific
</EM>theory which teaches us about light and sound and the effect
of two waves of equal length meeting. &quot;If the two sounds
be of the same intensity, their coincidence produces a sound four
times the intensity of either, while their interference produces
<EM>absolute silence.&quot;</EM><I> </I>
<P>
Explaining some of the &quot;heresies&quot; of his day, Justin
Martyr shows the identity of all the world religions at their
starting points. The first <EM>beginning </EM>opens invariably
with the <EM>unknown </EM>and PASSIVE deity, from which emanates
a certain active power or virtue, the Mystery that is sometimes
called <STRONG>W</STRONG>ISDOM, sometimes the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ON,
very often God, Angel, Lord, and<STRONG> L</STRONG>OGOS.* The
latter is sometimes applied to the very first emanation, but in
several systems it proceeds from the first androgyne or double
ray produced at the beginning by the unseen. Philo depicts this
wisdom as male and female. But though its first manifestation

had a beginning, for it proceeded from <EM>Oulom* </EM>(Aion,

it had remained with him <EM>before all creations, </EM>for it
is part of him.** Therefore, Philo Judaeus calls Adam Kadmon <EM>&quot;mind&quot;
</EM>(the Ennoia of <EM>Bythos </EM>in the Gnostic system). &quot;The
mind, let it be named Adam.***
<P>
As the old Magian books explain it, the whole <EM>event</EM> becomes
clear. A thing can only exist through its opposite -- Hegel teaches
us, and only a little philosophy and spirituality are needed to
comprehend the origin of the later dogma, which is so truly satanic
and infernal in its cold and cruel wickedness. The Magians accounted
for the origin of evil in their exoteric teachings in this way.
&quot;Light can produce nothing but light, and can never be the
origin of evil&quot;; how then was the evil produced, since there
was nothing co-equal or like the Light in its production? Light,
say they, produced several Beings, all of them spiritual, luminous,
and powerful. But a <STRONG>G</STRONG>REAT ONE (the &quot;Great
Asura,&quot; Ahriman, Lucifer, etc., etc.) had an <EM>evil thought,
</EM>contrary to the Light. He doubted, and by that doubt he became
dark.
<P>
This is a little nearer to the truth, but still wide of the mark.
There was no &quot;EVIL thought&quot; that originated the opposing
Power, but simply THOUGHT <EM>per se; </EM>something which, being
cogitative, and containing design and purpose, is therefore finite,
and must thus find itself naturally in opposition to pure quiescence,
the as natural state of absolute Spirituality and Perfection.
It was simply the law of Evolution that asserted itself; the progress
of mental unfolding, differentiated from spirit, involved and
entangled already with matter, into which it is irresistibly drawn.
Ideas, in their very nature and essence, as conceptions bearing
relation to objects, whether true or imaginary, are opposed to
absolute THOUGHT, that unknowable ALL of whose mysterious operations
Mr. Spencer predicates that nothing can be said, but that &quot;it
has no kinship of nature with Evolution&quot; (<EM>Principles
of Psychology,</EM>****<EM> </EM>474) -- which it certainly has
not.
<P>
The <EM>Zohar </EM>gives it very suggestively. When the &quot;Holy
One&quot; (the Logos) desired to create man, he called the <EM>highest
</EM>host of Angels and said to them what he wanted, but they
<EM>doubted </EM>the wisdom of this desire and answered: &quot;Man
will not continue one night in his glory&quot; -- for

which they were burnt (annihilated?), by the &quot;Holy&quot;
Lord. Then he called another, lower Host, and said the same. And
they contradicted the &quot;Holy One&quot;: &quot;What is the
good of Man?&quot; they argued. Still Elohim created man, and
when man <EM>sinned </EM>there came the hosts of Uzza and Azael,
and twitted God: &quot;Here is the Son of Man that thou hast made,&quot;
they said. &quot;Behold, he sinned!&quot; Then the Holy One replied:
&quot;If you had been among them (men) you would have been worse
than they.&quot; And he threw them from their exalted position
in Heaven even down on the Earth; and &quot;they were changed
(into men) and sinned after the women of the earth&quot;; (<EM>Zohar,

<EM>punished </EM>for it. The only reference to it in the Bible
is in Jude (6). &quot;And the angels which kept not their first
estate but left their habitation, he hath reserved in <EM>everlasting

How truly esoteric and consonant with the Secret Doctrine is &quot;<STRONG>P</STRONG>YMANDER

is seen from the remarks and unconscious <EM>confessions </EM>made
by de St. Marc, in his <EM>Preface </EM>and letter to the Bishop

from a Pantheistic and Egyptian into a mystic Roman Catholic treatise

-- <STRONG>P</STRONG>IMANDRE . . . . &quot; &quot;Oh, ma pensee,
que s'ensuit il? car je desire grandement ce propos. Pimandre
dict, ceci est un mystere cele, jusques a ce jour d'hui. Car nature,
soit mestant avec l'home, a produit le miracle tres merveilleux,
aiant celluy qui ie t'ay dict, la nature de l'harmonie des sept
du pere, et de l'esprit. <EM>Nature ne s'arresta pas la,</EM>
mais incontinent a produict <EM>sept homes, selon les natures
des sept gouverneurs </EM>en puissance des deux sexes et esleuez.
. . . La generation de ces <EM>sept </EM>s'est donnee en ceste
maniere . . . .&quot;

And a gap is made in the translation, which can be filled partially
by resorting to the Latin text of Apuleius. The commentator, the
Bishop, says: &quot;Nature produced in him (man) seven men&quot;
(seven principles).<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 492 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
produced seven men in accordance with the seven natures of the
Seven Spirits&quot; &quot;having in them, potentially, the two
sexes.&quot;
<P>
Metaphysically, the Father and the Son are the &quot;Universal
Mind&quot; and the &quot;periodical Universe&quot;; the &quot;Angel&quot;
and the &quot;Man.&quot; It is the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ON and the
<STRONG>F</STRONG>ATHER at one and the same time; in Pymander,
the <EM>active </EM>IDEA and the <EM>passive </EM>THOUGHT that
generates it; the radical key-note in Nature which gives birth
to the seven notes -- the septenary scale of the creative Forces,
and to the seven prismatic <EM>aspects </EM>of colour, all born
from the one <EM>white ray, </EM>or <STRONG>L</STRONG>IGHT --
itself generated in DARKNESS.
