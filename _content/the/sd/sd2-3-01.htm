<H4>&#167; I.<BR>
ARCHAIC, OR MODERN ANTHROPOLOGY?</H4>

<P>
<B>W</B>HENEVER the question of the origin of man is offered seriously
to an unbiassed, honest, and earnest man of science, the answer
comes invariably: -- &quot;<B>W</B>E DO NOT KNOW.&quot; De Quatrefages,
in his agnostic attitude, is one of such anthropologists.
<P>
This does not imply that the rest of the men of science are neither
fair-minded nor honest, as in such case our remark would be questionably
discreet. But, it is estimated that 75 per cent. of European Scientists
are Evolutionists. Are these representatives of modern thought
all guilty of flagrant misrepresentation of the facts? No one
says this -- but there are a few very exceptional cases. However,
the Scientists in their anti-clerical enthusiasm and despair of
any alternative theory to Darwinism, except that of &quot;special
creation,&quot; are unconsciously insincere in &quot;forcing&quot;
a hypothesis the elasticity of which is inadequate, and which
resents the severe strain to which it is now subjected. Insincerity
on the same subject is, however, patent in ecclesiastical circles.
Bishop Temple has come forward as a thorough-going supporter of
Darwinism in his &quot;Religion and Science.&quot; This clerical
writer goes so far as to regard <I>Matter </I>-- after receiving
its &quot;primal impress&quot; -- as the unaided evolver of all
cosmic phenomena. This view only differs from that of Haeckel,
in postulating a hypothetical deity at &quot;the back of beyont,&quot;
a deity which stands entirely aloof from the interplay of forces.
Such a metaphysical entity is no more the Theological God than
that of Kant. Bishop Temple's truce with Materialistic Science
is, in our opinion, impolitic -- apart from the fact that it involves
a total rejection of the Biblical cosmogony. In the presence of
this display of flunkeyism before the materialism of our &quot;learned&quot;
age, we Occultists can but smile. But how about loyalty to the
Masters such theological truants profess to serve, Christ, and
Christendom at large?
<P>
However, we have no desire, for the present, to throw down the
gauntlet to the clergy, our business being now with materialistic
Science alone. The latter answers to our question, in the person
of its best representatives &quot;We do not know;&quot; -- yet
the majority of these act as though Omniscience was their heirloom,
and they knew all things.
<P>
For, indeed, this negative reply has not prevented the majority
of Scientists from speculating on that question, each seeking
to have his<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 646 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
own special theory accepted to the exclusion of all others. Thus,
from Maillet in 1748 down to Haeckel in 1870, theories on the
origin of the human Race have differed as much as the personalities
of their inventors themselves. Buffon, Bory de St. Vincent, Lamarck,
E. G. St. Hilaire, Gaudry, Naudin, Wallace, Darwin, Owen, Haeckel,
Filippi, Vogt, Huxley, Agassiz, etc., etc., each evolved a more
or less scientific hypothesis of genesis. De Quatrefages arranges
them in two principal groups -- one holding to a <I>rapid, </I>and
the other to a very <I>gradual transmutation</I>;<I> </I>the<I>
</I>former, favouring a new type (man) produced by a being entirely
different; the latter teaching the evolution of man by progressive
differentiation.
<P>
Strangely enough, it is from the most scientific of these authorities
that the most unscientific of all the theories upon the subject
of the origin of man has hitherto emanated. This is so evident,
that the hour is rapidly approaching when the current teaching
about the descent of man from an Ape-like mammal will be regarded
with less respect than the formation of Adam out of clay, and
of Eve out of Adam's rib. For --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;It is evident, especially after the most fundamental principles
of Darwinism, that an organized being cannot be a descendant of
another whose development is in an inverse order to his own. .
. . Consequently, in accordance with these principles <I>man cannot
be considered as the descendant of any simian type whatever.</I>&quot;*
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Lucae's argument <I>versus </I>the Ape-theory, based on the different
flexures of the bones constituting the axis of the skull in the
cases of Man and the Anthropoids, is fairly discussed by Schmidt
(&quot;<I>Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,</I>&quot;<I> </I>p.
290). He admits that &quot;<I>the ape as he grows becomes more
bestial</I>;<I> man </I>. . . <I>more human,</I>&quot;<I> </I>and
seems, indeed, to hesitate a moment before he passes on: <I>e.g</I>.,
&quot;This flexure of the cranial axis may, therefore, still be
emphasized as a human character, in contradistinction to the apes;
the peculiar characteristic of an order can <I>scarcely </I>be
elicited from it; and especially as to the doctrine of descent,
this circumstance <I>seems </I>in no way decisive.&quot; The writer
evidently is not a little disquieted at the argument. He assures
us that it upsets any possibility of the present apes having been
the progenitors of mankind. But does it not also negative the
bare possibility of the man and anthropoid having had a common
-- though, so far, an absolutely theoretical -- ancestor.

The respective developments of the human and Simian brains are
referred to. &quot;In the ape the temporo-spheroidal convolutions,
which form the middle lobe, make their appearance and are completed
before the anterior convolutions which form the frontal lobe.
In man, the frontal convolutions are, on the contrary, the first
to appear, and those of the middle lobe are formed later.&quot;

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 647 THE FALLACIES OF MODERN SCIENTISTS.</H6>

<P>
Even &quot;Natural Selection&quot; itself is with every day more
threatened. The deserters from the Darwinian camp are many, and
those who were at one time its most ardent disciples are, owing
to new discoveries, slowly but steadily preparing to turn over
a new leaf. In the &quot;Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society&quot;
for October, 1886, one can read as follows: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;<B>P</B>HYSIOLOGICAL <B>S</B>ELECTION. -- Mr. G. J. Romanes
finds certain difficulties in regarding natural selection as a
theory for the origin of adaptive structures. He proposes to replace
it by what he calls physiological selection, or the segregation
of the fit. His view is based on the extreme sensitiveness of
the reproductive system to small changes in the conditions of
life, and he thinks that variations in the direction of greater
or less sterility must frequently occur in wild species. If the
variation be such that the reproductive system, while showing
some degree of sterility with the parent form, continues to be
fertile within the limits of the varietal form, the variation
would neither be swamped by intercrossing nor die out on account
of sterility. When a variation of this kind occurs, the physiological
barrier must divide the species into two parts. . . . . The author,
in fine, regards mutual sterility, not as one of the effects of
specific differentiation, but as the cause of it.&quot;*
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
An attempt is made to show the above to be a complement of, and
sequence to, the Darwinian theory. This is a <I>clumsy </I>attempt
at best. The public will soon be made to believe that Mr. C. Dixon's
&quot;<I>Evolution without Natural Selection</I>&quot;<I> </I>is
also Darwinism -- expanded, as the author certainly claims it
to be!
<P>
But it is like splitting the body of a man into three pieces or
various portions of man, and then maintaining that each portion
is the identical man as he was before; only -- expanded. Yet the
author states on p. 79: -- &quot;Let it be clearly understood
that not one single syllable in the foregoing pages has been written
antagonistic to Darwin's theory of Natural Selection. All I have
done is to explain certain phenomena . . . . the more one studies
Darwin's works, the more one is convinced of the truth of his
hypothesis.&quot; (!!)
<P>
And before this, on p. 48, he alludes to: -- &quot;the overwhelming
array of facts which Darwin gave in support of his hypothesis,
and which triumphantly carried the theory of Natural Selection
over all obstacles and objections.&quot;
<P>
This does not prevent the learned author, however, from upsetting
this theory as &quot;triumphantly,&quot; and from even openly
calling his work
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* To this an editorial remark adds that an &quot;<STRONG>F.J.B.</STRONG>,&quot;
in the <I>Athenaeum -- </I>(No. 3069, Aug. 21, 1886, pp. 242-3)
points out that naturalists have long recognised that there are
&quot;morphological&quot; and &quot;physiological&quot; species.
The former have their origin in men's minds, the latter in a series
of changes sufficient to affect the internal as well as the external
organs of a group of allied individuals. The &quot;physiological
selection&quot; of morphological species is a confusion of ideas;
that of physiological species &quot;a redundancy of terms.&quot;
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 648 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
&quot;Evolution <I>without </I>a Natural Selection,&quot; or,
in so many words, with Darwin's fundamental idea knocked to atoms
in it.
<P>
As to Natural Selection itself, the utmost misconception prevails
among many present-day thinkers who tacitly accept the conclusions
of Darwinism. It is, for instance, a mere device of rhetoric to
credit &quot;Natural Selection&quot; with the power of <I>originating
</I>species. &quot;Natural Selection&quot; is no Entity; but a
convenient phrase for describing the mode in which the survival
of the fit and the elimination of the unfit among organisms is
brought about in the struggle for existence. Every group of organisms
tends to multiply beyond the means of subsistence, the constant
battle for life -- the &quot;struggle to obtain enough to eat
and to escape being eaten&quot; added to the environmental conditions
-- necessitating a perpetual weeding out of the unfit. The <I>elite
</I>of any stock thus sorted out, propagate the species and transmit
their organic characteristics to their descendants. All useful
variations are thus perpetuated, and a progressive improvement
is effected. But Natural Selection, in the writer's humble opinion,
&quot;Selection, <I>as a Power,</I>&quot;<I> </I>is in reality
a pure myth; especially when resorted to as an explanation of
the origin of species. It is merely a representative term expressive
of the manner in which &quot;useful variations&quot; are stereotyped
when produced. Of itself, &quot;it&quot; <I>can produce nothing,
</I>and only operates on the rough material presented to &quot;it.&quot;
The real question at issue is: what <STRONG>C</STRONG>AUSE --
combined with other secondary causes -- produces the &quot;variations&quot;
in the organisms themselves. Many of these secondary causes are
purely physical, climatic, dietary, etc., etc. Very well. But
beyond the secondary aspects of organic evolution, a deeper principle
has to be sought for. The materialist's &quot;spontaneous variations,&quot;
and &quot;<I>accidental </I>divergencies&quot; are self-contradictory
terms in a universe of &quot;Matter, Force and <STRONG>N</STRONG>ECESSITY.&quot;
Mere variability of type, apart from the supervisory presence
of a quasi-intelligent impulse, is powerless to account for the
stupendous complexities and marvels of the human body for instance.
The insufficiency of the Darwinists' mechanical theory has been
exposed at length by Dr. Von Hartmann among other purely negative
thinkers. It is an abuse of the reader's intelligence to write,
as does Haeckel, of <I>blind</I> indifferent cells, &quot;arranging
themselves into organs.&quot; The esoteric solution of the origin
of animal species is given elsewhere.
<P>
Those purely <I>secondary </I>causes of differentiation, grouped
under the head of sexual selection, natural selection, climate,
isolation, etc., etc., mislead the Western Evolutionist and offer
no real explanation whatever of the &quot;whence&quot; of the
&quot;ancestral types&quot; which served as the<I> starting point
</I>for physical development. The truth is that the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 649 THE OCCULT AND THE MODERN DOCTRINES.
</H6>

<P>
differentiating &quot;causes&quot; known to modern science only
come into operation after the <I>physicalization of the primeval
animal root-types out of the astral. </I>Darwinism only meets
Evolution at its midway point -- that is to say when astral evolution
has given place to the play of the ordinary physical forces with
which our present senses acquaint us. But even here the Darwinian
Theory, even with the &quot;expansions&quot; recently attempted,
is inadequate to meet the facts of the case. The underlying physiological
variation in species -- one to which all other laws are subordinate
and secondary -- is a sub-conscious intelligence pervading matter,
ultimately traceable to a REFLECTION of the Divine and Dhyan-Chohanic
wisdom.* A not altogether dissimilar conclusion has been arrived
at by so well known a thinker as Ed. von Hartmann, who, despairing
of the efficacy of <I>unaided </I>Natural Selection, regards evolution
as intelligently guided by the <STRONG>U</STRONG>NCONSCIOUS (the
Cosmic <I>Logos </I>of Occultism). But the latter acts only mediately
through <STRONG>F</STRONG>OHAT, or Dhyan-Chohanic energy, and
not quite in the direct manner which the great pessimist describes.
<P>
It is this divergence among men of Science, their mutual, and
often their <I>self</I>-contradictions, that gave the writer of
the present volumes the courage to bring to light other and older
teachings -- if only as hypotheses for <I>future </I>scientific
appreciation. Though not in any way very learned in modern sciences,
so evident, even to the humble recorder of this archaic clearing,
are the said scientific fallacies and gaps, that she determined
to touch upon all these, in order to place the two teachings on
parallel lines. For Occultism, it is a question of self-defence,
and nothing more.
<P>
So far, the &quot;Secret Doctrine&quot; has concerned itself with
metaphysics, pure and simple. It has now landed on Earth, and
finds itself within the domain of physical science and practical
anthropology, or those branches of study which materialistic Naturalists
claim as their rightful domain, coolly asserting, furthermore,
that the higher and more perfect the working of the Soul, the
more amenable it is to the analysis and explanations <I>of the
zoologist and the physiologist alone.</I> (<I>Haeckel on </I>&quot;<I>Cell-Souls
and Soul-Cells.</I>&quot;) This stupendous pretension comes from
one, who, to prove his pithecoid descent, has not hesitated to
include among the ancestors of man the <I>Lemuridae</I>;<I> </I>which
have been promoted by him to the rank of <I>Prosimiae, indeciduate
mammals, </I>to which he very incorrectly attributes a <I>decidua</I>

of the universal guiding <STRONG>F</STRONG>OHAT, rich with the

and a discoidal placenta.* For this Haeckel was taken severely
to task by de Quatrefages, and criticised by his own brother materialists
and agnostics, as great, if not greater, authorities than himself,
namely, by Virchow and du Bois-Reymond.**
<P>
Such opposition notwithstanding, Haeckel's wild theories are,
to this day, called scientific and logical by some. The mysterious
nature of Consciousness, of Soul, Spirit in Man being now explained
as a mere advance on the functions of the protoplasmic molecules
of the lively <I>Protista, </I>and the gradual evolution and growth
of human mind and &quot;social instincts&quot; toward civilization
having to be traced back to their origin in the civilization of
ants, bees, and other creatures, the chances left for an impartial
hearing of the doctrines of archaic Wisdom, are few indeed. The
<I>educated </I>profane is told that &quot;the social instincts
of the lower animals have, of late, been regarded <I>as being
clearly the origin of morals, </I>even of those of man&quot; (!)
and that our divine consciousness, our soul, intellect, and aspirations
have &quot;worked their way up from the lower stages of the simple
cell-soul&quot; of the gelatinous Bathybius -- (<I>See Haeckel</I>'<I>s
</I>&quot;<I>Present Position of Evolution</I>&quot;<I> Notes</I>)<I>,
-- </I>and he seems to believe it. For such men, the metaphysics
of Occultism must produce the effect that our grandest orchestral
and vocal oratorios produce on the Chinaman: a sound that jars
upon their nerves.
<P>
Yet, are our esoteric teachings about &quot;angels,&quot; the
first three <I>pre</I>-animal human Races, and the downfall of
the Fourth, <I>on a lower level of fiction and self-delusion </I>than
the Haeckelian &quot;plastidular,&quot; or the inorganic &quot;molecular
Souls of the <I>Protista</I>&quot;?<I> </I>Between the evolution
of the spiritual nature of man from the above Amoebian Souls,
and the alleged development of his physical frame from the protoplastic
dweller in the Ocean slime, there is an abyss which will not be
easily crossed by any man in the <I>full</I> possession of his
intellectual faculties. Physical evolution, as modern Science
teaches it, is a subject for open controversy; spiritual and moral
development on the same lines is the insane dream of a crass materialism.
<P>
Furthermore, past as well as present daily experience teaches
that no truth has ever been accepted by the learned bodies unless
it dovetailed

but matter in motion,&quot; he asserts; &quot;<I>we must go further,
</I>and admit the utterly incomprehensible nature of the psychical
principle which it is <I>impossible to regard </I>as a mere outcome
of material causes.&quot;<HR>

with the habitual preconceived ideas of their professors. &quot;The
crown of the innovator is a crown of thorns&quot;: -- said G.
St. Hilaire. It is only that which fits in with popular hobbies
and accepted notions that as a general rule gains ground. Hence
the triumph of the Haeckelian ideas, notwithstanding their being
proclaimed by Virchow, du Bois-Reymond, and others as the &quot;<I>testimonium
paupertatis </I>of natural Science.&quot;
<P>
Diametrically opposed as may be the materialism of the German
Evolutionists to the spiritual conceptions of Esoteric philosophy,
radically inconsistent as is their accepted anthropological system
with the real facts of nature, -- the pseudo-idealistic bias now
colouring English thought is almost more pernicious. The pure
materialistic doctrine admits of a direct refutation and appeal
to the logic of facts. The idealism of the present day, not only
contrives to absorb, on the one hand, the basic negations of Atheism,
but lands its votaries in a tangle of <I>unreality, </I>which
culminates in a practical Nihilism. Argument with such writers
is almost out of the question. Idealists, therefore, will be still
more antagonistic to the Occult teachings now given than even
the Materialists. But as no worse fate can befall the exponents
of Esoteric Anthropo-<I>Genesis</I> than being openly called by
their foes by their old and time-honoured names of &quot;lunatics&quot;
and &quot;ignoramuses,&quot; the present archaic theories may
be safely added to the many modern speculations, and bide their
time for their full or even partial recognition. Only, as the
existence itself of these &quot;archaic theories&quot; will probably
be denied, we have to give our best proofs and stand by them to
the bitter end.
<P>
In our race and generation the one &quot;temple in the Universe&quot;
is in rare cases -- <I>within </I>us; but our body and mind have
been too defiled by both Sin and Science to be outwardly <I>now</I>
anything better than a fane of iniquity and error. And here our
mutual position -- that of Occultism and Modern Science -- ought
to be once for all defined.
<P>
We, Theosophists, would willingly bow before such men of learning
as the late Prof. Balfour Stewart, Messrs. Crookes, Quatrefages,
Wallace, Agassiz, Butlerof, and several others, though we may
not agree, from the stand-point of esoteric philosophy, with all
they say. But nothing could make us consent to even a show of
respect for the opinions of other men of science, such as Haeckel,
Carl Vogt, or Ludwig Buchner, in Germany; or even of Mr. Huxley
and his co-thinkers in materialism in England -- the colossal
erudition of the first named, notwithstanding. Such men are simply
the intellectual and moral murderers of future generations; especially
Haeckel, whose crass materialism often rises to the height of
idiotic <I>naivetes </I>in his reasonings. One has but to read
his &quot;Pedigree of Man, and Other Essays&quot; (<I>Aveling</I>'<I>s
transl.</I>)<I> </I>to feel a desire, in the words of Job, that
his<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 652 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
remembrance should perish from the earth, and that he &quot;shall
have no name in the streets.&quot; Hear him deriding the idea
of the origin of the human race &quot;as a supernatural (?) phenomenon,&quot;
as one &quot;that could not result from <I>simple mechanical causes,
</I>from<I> physical and chemical forces, </I>but requires the
direct intervention of a creative personality. . . &quot;
<P>
. . . . &quot;Now the central point of Darwin's teaching,&quot;
. . goes on the creator of the mythical <I>Sozura, </I>&quot;lies
in this, that it demonstrates the simplest mechanical causes,
purely physico-chemical phenomena of nature, as wholly sufficient
to explain the highest and most difficult problems. Darwin puts
in the place of <I>a conscious creative force, </I>building and
arranging the organic bodies of animals and plants on a designed
plan, <I>a series of natural forces working blindly </I>(<I>or
we say</I>)<I> without aim, without design. </I>In place of an
arbitrary act of operation, we have a necessary law of Evolution
. . . . &quot; (So had Manu and Kapila, and, at the same time,
guiding, conscious and intelligent Powers). . . &quot;Darwin had
very wisely . . . put on one side the question as to the first
appearance of life. But very soon that consequence, so full of
meaning, so wide reaching, was openly discussed by able and brave
scientific men, such as Huxley, Carl Vogt, Ludwig Buchner. <I>A
mechanical origin of the earliest living form, </I>was held as
the necessary sequence to Darwin's teaching . . and we are at
present concerned with a single consequence of the theory, <I>the
natural </I>origin of the human race through ALMIGHTY EVOLUTION&quot;
(pp. 34, 37).
<P>
To which, unabashed by this scientific farrago, Occultism replies:
in the course of Evolution, when the physical triumphed over,
and nearly crushed under its weight, spiritual and mental evolutions,
the great gift of<I> Kriyasakti* </I>remained the heirloom of
only a few elect men in every age . . . . Spirit strove vainly
to <I>manifest itself in its fulness in purely organic forms </I>(as
has been explained in Part I. of this Volume), and the faculty,
which had been a natural attribute in the early humanity of the
Third Race, became one of the class regarded as simply phenomenal
by the Spiritualists and Occultists, and as <I>scientifically
impossible </I>by the materialists.
<P>
In our modern day the mere assertion that there exists a power
which can create human forms -- ready-made <I>sheaths </I>for
the &quot;<I>conscious </I>monads&quot; or Nirmanakayas of past
Manvantaras to incarnate within -- is, of course, absurd, ridiculous!
That which is regarded as quite natural, on the other hand, is
the production of a Frankenstein's monster, <I>plus </I>moral
consciousness, religious aspirations, genius, and a feeling of
one's own immortal nature within one's self -- by &quot;physico-chemical
forces, guided by blind Almighty Evolution&quot; (&quot;Pedigree
of Man&quot;).

As to the origin of that man, not <I>ex-nihilo, </I>cemented by
a little red clay, but from a living divine Entity consolidating
the astral body with surrounding materials -- this conception
is too absurd even to be mentioned in the opinion of the materialists.
Nevertheless, Occultists and Theosophists are ready to have their
claims and theories -- however unscientific and superstitious
at first glance -- compared as to their intrinsic value and probability,
with those of the modern evolutionists. Hence the esoteric teaching
is absolutely opposed to the Darwinian evolution, as <I>applied
to man, and partially </I>so with regard to other species.
<P>
It would be interesting to obtain a glimpse of the mental representation
of <I>Evolution </I>in the Scientific brain of a materialist.
What <I>is</I><STRONG> E</STRONG>VOLUTION? If asked to define
the full and <I>complete </I>meaning of the term, neither Huxley
nor Haeckel will be able to do it any better than Webster does:
&quot;the act of unfolding; the process of growth, development;
as the evolution of a flower from a bud, or an animal from the
egg.&quot; Yet the bud must be traced through its parent-plant
to the seed, and the egg to the animal or bird that laid it; or
at any rate to the speck of protoplasm from which it expanded
and grew. And both the <I>seed </I>and the <I>speck </I>must have
the latent potentialities in them for the reproduction and gradual
development, the unfolding of the thousand and one forms or phases
of evolution, through which they must pass before the flower or
the animal are fully developed? Hence, the future plan, if not
a DESIGN, <I>must be there. </I>Moreover, that <I>seed has to
be traced, </I>and its nature ascertained. Have the Darwinists
been successful in this? Or will the Moneron be cast in our teeth?
But this atom of the Watery Abysses is <I>not</I> homogeneous
matter; and there must be something or somebody that had moulded
and cast it into being.
<P>
Here Science is once more silent. But since there is no Self-consciousness
as yet in either speck, seed, or germ, according to both Materialists
and Psychologists of the modern school -- Occultists agreeing
in this for once with their natural enemies -- what is it that
guides the force or forces so unerringly in this process of evolution?
<I>Blind </I>force? As well call <I>blind </I>the brain which
evolved in Haeckel his &quot;Pedigree of Man&quot; and other lucubrations.
We can easily conceive that the said brain lacks an important
centre or two. For, whoever knows anything of the anatomy of the
human, or even of any animal, body, and is still an <I>atheist
</I>and a <I>materialist, </I>must be &quot;hopelessly insane,&quot;
according to Lord Herbert, who rightly sees in the frame of man's
body and the coherence of its parts, something so strange and
paradoxical that he holds it &quot;to be the greatest miracle
of nature.&quot; <I>Blind</I> forces, &quot;and <I>no</I> design&quot;
in anything under the Sun; when no <I>sane </I>man of Science
would hesitate to say that, even from the little he knows and
has hitherto discovered of the forces at work in Kosmos, he sees
very plainly<HR>

<P>
that every part, every speck and atom are in harmony with their
fellow atoms, and these with the whole, each having its distinct
mission throughout the life-cycle. But, fortunately, the greatest,
the most eminent thinkers and Scientists of the day are now beginning
to rise against this &quot;Pedigree,&quot; and even Darwin's <I>natural
selection </I>theory, though its author had never, probably, contemplated
such widely stretched conclusions. The remarkable work of the
Russian Scientist N. T. Danilevsky -- &quot;Darwinism, a Critical
Investigation of the Theory&quot; -- upsets it completely and
without appeal, and so does de Quatrefages in his last work. Our
readers are recommended to examine the learned paper by Dr. Bourges
-- read by its author, a member of the Paris Anthropological Society
at a recent official meeting of the latter -- called &quot;<I>Evolutionary
Psychology</I>;<I> the Evolution of Spirit, etc.</I>&quot;<I>
</I>in which he reconciles entirely the two teachings -- namely,
those of the physical and spiritual evolutions. He explains the
origin of the variety of organic forms, made to fit their environments
with such evident intelligent design, by the existence and the
mutual help and <I>interaction </I>of two principles in (manifest)
nature, the inner Conscious Principle adapting itself to physical
nature and the innate potentialities in the latter. Thus the French
Scientist has to return to our old friend -- <I>Archaeus, </I>or
the life-Principle -- without naming it, as Dr. Richardson has
done in England in his &quot;Nerve-Force,&quot; etc. The same
idea was recently developed in Germany by Baron Hellenbach, in
his remarkable work, &quot;Individuality in the light of Biology
and modern Philosophy.&quot;
<P>
We find the same conclusions arrived at in still another excellent
volume of another Russian deep thinker, N. N<I>. </I>Strachof
-- who says in his &quot;Fundamental Conceptions of Psychology
and Physiology&quot;: -- &quot;The most clear, as the most familiar,
type of development may be found in our own mental or physical
evolution, which has served others as a model to follow . . .
. If organisms are <I>entities</I> .<I> </I>. . then it is only
just to conclude and assert that the organic life strives to beget
psychic life; but it would be still more correct and in accordance
with the spirit of these two categories of evolution to say, that
<I>the true cause of organic life is the tendency of spirit to
manifest in substantial forms, to clothe itself in substantial
reality. It is the highest form which contains the complete explanation
of the lowest, never the reverse.</I>&quot;<I> </I>This is admitting,
as Bourges does in the <I>Memoire </I>above quoted, the identity
of this mysterious, integrally acting and organizing Principle
with the Self-Conscious and Inner Subject, which we call the <STRONG>E</STRONG>GO
and the world at large -- the Soul. Thus, gradually, all the best
Scientists and Thinkers are approaching the Occultists in their
general conclusions.
<P>
But such metaphysically inclined men of Science are out of court
and will hardly be listened to. Schiller, in his magnificent poem
on<HR>

<P>
the Veil of Isis, makes the mortal youth who dared to lift the
impenetrable covering fall down dead after beholding naked Truth
in the face of the stern goddess. Have some of our Darwinians,
so tenderly united in natural selection and affinity, also gazed
at the Saitic Mother bereft of her veils? One might almost suspect
it after reading their theories. Their great intellects must have
collapsed while gauging too closely the uncovered face of Nature,
leaving only the grey matter and ganglia in their brain, to respond
to <I>blind</I> physico-chemical forces. At any rate Shakespeare's
lines apply admirably to our modem Evolutionist who symbolizes
that &quot;proud man,&quot; who --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;<I>Dress</I>'<I>d in a little brief authority</I>;<BR>
<I>Most ignorant of what he</I>'<I>s most assured,<BR>
</I>His glassy essence -- like an angry ape,<BR>
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven,<BR>
As make the Angels weep! . . . . &quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
These have nought to do with the &quot;angels.&quot; Their only
concern is the human ancestor, the pithecoid Noah who gave birth
to three sons -- the tailed Cynocephalus, the tailless Ape, and
the &quot;arboreal&quot; Palaeolithic man. On this point, they
will not be contradicted. Every doubt expressed is immediately
set down as an attempt to cripple scientific inquiry. The insuperable
difficulty at the very foundation of the evolution theory, namely,
that no Darwinian is able to give even an approximate definition
of the period <I>at </I>which, and the form <I>in</I> which, the
first man appeared, is smoothed down to a trifling impediment,
which is &quot;really of no account.&quot; Every branch of knowledge
is in the same predicament, we are informed. The chemist bases
his most abstruse calculations simply &quot;upon a hypothesis
of atoms and molecules, of which not one has ever been seen isolated,
weighed, or defined. The electrician speaks of magnetic fluids
which have never tangibly revealed themselves. No definite origin
can be assigned either to molecules or magnetism. Science cannot
and does not pretend to any knowledge of the beginnings of law,
matter or life, . . .&quot; etc., etc. (<I>Knowledge, </I>January,
1882.)
<P>
And, withal, to reject a <I>scientific hypothesis, </I>however
absurd, is to commit the one unpardonable sin! We risk it.
