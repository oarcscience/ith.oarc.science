<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 277 THE GIANTS.</H6>

<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>RE <STRONG>G</STRONG>IANTS A <STRONG>F</STRONG>ICTION?
<P>
Here, again, we come into collision with Science. The latter denies,
so far, that man has ever been much larger than the average of
the tall and powerful men one meets with occasionally now. Dr.
Henry Gregor denounces such traditions as resting upon ill-digested
facts. Instances of mistaken judgments are brought forward. Thus,
in 1613, in a locality called from time immemorial the &quot;Field
of Giants&quot; in the Lower Dauphine (France, four miles from
St. Romans) enormous bones were found deeply buried in the sandy
soil. They were attributed to human remains, and even to Teutobochus,
the Teuton chief slain by Marius. But Cuvier's later research
proved them to be the fossil remains of the <EM>Dinotherium giganteum
</EM>of the family of tapirs, 18 feet long. Ancient buildings
are pointed to as an evidence that our earliest ancestors were
not much larger than we are, the entrance doors being of no larger
size then than they are now. The tallest man of antiquity <EM>known
to us </EM>was the Roman Emperor Maximus, we are told, whose height
was only seven and a half feet. Nevertheless, in our modern day
we see every year men taller than this. The Hungarian who exhibited
himself in the London Pavilion was nearly 9 feet high. In America
a giant was shown 9 1/2 feet tall; the Montenegrin Danilo was
8 feet 7 inches. In Russia and Germany one often sees men in the
lower classes above 7 feet. And as the ape-theorists are told
by Mr. Darwin that the species of animals which result from cross
breeding &quot;always betray <EM>a tendency to revert to the</EM>
<EM>original type,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>they ought to apply the
same law to men. Had there been no giants as a rule in ancient
days, there would be none now.
<P>
All this applies only to the historic period. And if the skeletons
of the prehistoric ages have failed so far (which is positively
denied) to prove undeniably in the opinion of science the claim
here advanced, it is but a question of time. Moreover, as already
stated, human stature is little changed since the last racial
cycle. The Giants of old are all buried under the Oceans, and
hundreds of thousands of years of constant friction by water would
reduce to dust and pulverize a brazen, far more a human skeleton.
But whence the testimony of well-known classical writers, of philosophers
and men who, otherwise, never had the reputation for lying? Let
us bear in mind, furthermore, that before the year 1847, when
Boucher de Perthes forced it upon the attention of Science, almost
nothing was known of fossil man, for archaeology complacently
ignored his existence. Of Giants who were &quot;in the earth in
those days&quot; of old, the Bible alone had spoken to the wise
men of the West, the Zodiac being the solitary witness called
upon to corroborate the statement in the persons of Atlas or Orion,
whose mighty shoulders are said to support the world.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 278 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Nevertheless, even the &quot;Giants&quot; have not been left without
their witnesses, and one may as well examine both sides of the
question. The three Sciences -- Geological, Sidereal and Scriptural
(the latter in its Universal character) -- may furnish us with
the needed proofs. To begin with geology; it has already confessed
that the older the excavated skeletons, the larger, taller and
the more powerful their structure. This is already a certain proof
in hand. &quot;All those bones&quot; writes Frederic de Rougemont
-- who, though believing too piously in Noah's ark and the Bible,
is none the less a Scientific witness -- &quot;all those skeletons
found in the Departments of the Gard, in Austria, Liege, etc.,
etc. . . those skulls which remind all of the negro type. . .
and which by reason of that type might be mistaken for animals,
have all belonged to men <EM>of very high stature</EM>&quot;<EM>
. </EM>. <EM>.</EM> (&quot;<EM>Histoire de la Terre,</EM>&quot;<EM>
p. </EM>154) The same is repeated by Lartet, an authority, who
attributes a <EM>tall stature </EM>to those who were submerged
in the deluge (not necessarily &quot;Noah's&quot;) and a smaller
stature to the races which lived subsequently.
<P>
As for the evidence furnished by ancient writers, we need not
stop at that of Tertullian, who assures us that in his day a number
of giants were found at Carthage -- for, before his testimony
can be accepted, his own identity* and actual existence would
have to be proven. But we may turn to the scientific journals
of 1858, which spoke of <EM>a sarcophagus of giants </EM>found
that year on the site of that same city. As to the ancient pagan
writers -- we have the evidence of Philostratus, who speaks of
a giant skeleton twenty-two cubits long, as well as of another
of twelve cubits, seen by himself at Sigeus. This skeleton may
perhaps not have belonged, as believed by Protesilaus, to the
giant killed by Apollo at the siege of Troy; nevertheless, it
was that of a giant, as well as that other one discovered by Messecrates
of Stire, at Lemnos -- &quot;horrible to behold,&quot; according
to Philostratus (<EM>Heroica, p. </EM>35)<EM>. </EM>Is it possible
that prejudice would carry Science so far as to class <EM>all
</EM>these men as either fools or <EM>liars?</EM> 
<P>
Pliny speaks of a giant in whom he thought he recognised Orion,
the son of Ephialtes (<EM>Nat. Hist., vol. VII, ch. xvi.</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>Plutarch declares that Sertorius saw the tomb of Antaeus,
the giant; and Pausanias vouches for the actual existence of the
tombs of Asterius and of Geryon, or Hillus, son of Hercules --
all giants, Titans and mighty men. Finally the Abbe Pegues (<EM>cited
in de Mirville</EM>'<EM>s Pneumatologie</EM>)<EM> </EM>affirms
in his curious work on &quot;<EM>The Volcanoes of Greece</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>that &quot;in the neighbourhood of the volcanoes of the isle
of Thera, giants with enormous skulls were found laid out under
colossal stones, the erection of which must have necessi-

* There are critics who, finding no evidence about the existence
of Tertullian save in the writings of Eusebius &quot;the veracious,&quot;
are inclined to doubt it.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 279 CHRISTENDOM IS IDOLATROUS.</H6>

<P>
tated everywhere the use of titanic powers, and which tradition
associates in all countries with the ideas about giants, volcanoes
and magic.&quot; (<EM>Page </EM>48.)
<P>
In the same work above cited of the Abbe Pegues, the author wonders
why in Bible and tradition the <EM>Gibborim, </EM>(Giants, the
mighty ones) the <EM>Rephaim, </EM>or the spectres (<EM>Phantoms</EM>),
the<EM> Nephilim, </EM>or the fallen ones <EM>-- </EM>(<EM>irruentes</EM>)<EM>
-- </EM>are shown &quot;as if identical, though they are all <EM>men</EM>,
since the Bible calls them the primitive and the mighty ones&quot;
-- e.g., Nimrod. The &quot;Doctrine&quot; explains the secret.
These names, which belong by right only to the four preceding
races and the earliest beginning of the Fifth, allude very clearly
to the first two <EM>Phantom</EM> (astral) races; to the <EM>fallen
one -- </EM>the Third; and to the race of the Atlantean Giants
-- the Fourth, after which &quot;men began to decrease in stature.&quot;
<P>
Bossuet (<EM>Elevations p. </EM>56) sees the cause of subsequent
universal idolatry in the &quot;original sin.&quot; &quot;Ye shall
be as gods,&quot; says the serpent of <EM>Genesis </EM>to Eve,
thus laying the first germ of the worship of <EM>false</EM> <EM>divinities.
</EM>Hence, he thinks, came idolatry, or the cult and adoration
of <EM>images, </EM>of anthropomorphized or human figures. But,
if it is the latter that idolatry is made to rest upon, then the
two Churches, the Greek and the Latin especially, are as idolatrous
and pagan as any other religion.* It is only in the Fourth Race
that men, who had lost all right to be considered divine, resorted
to body worship, in other words to phallicism. Till then, they
had been truly gods, as pure and as divine as their progenitors,
and the expression of the allegorical serpent does not, as sufficiently
shown in the preceding pages, refer at all to the physiological
fall of men, but to their acquiring the knowledge of good and
evil, which knowledge comes to them <EM>prior</EM> to their fall.
It must not be forgotten that it is only after his forced expulsion
from Eden that &quot;Adam knew Eve his wife&quot; (<EM>Genesis
iv.</EM>)<EM>. </EM>It is not, however, by the dead-letter of
the Hebrew Bible that we shall check the tenets of the <EM>Secret
Doctrine</EM>;<EM> </EM>but point out, rather, the great similarities
between the two in their esoteric meaning.
<P>
It is only after his defection from the Neo-Platonists, that Clement

* And that, notwithstanding the formal prohibition at the great
Church Council of Elyrus in <STRONG>A.D. </STRONG>303, when it
was declared that &quot;the form of God, which is immaterial and
invisible, shall not be limited by figure or shape.&quot; In 692,
the council of Constantinople had similarly prohibited &quot;to
paint or represent Jesus <EM>as a lamb</EM>,&quot; as also &quot;to
bow the knee in praying, as it is the act of idolatry.&quot; But
the council of Nicaea (787) brought this idolatry back, while
that of Rome (883) excommunicated John, the Patriarch of Constantinople,
for his showing himself a declared enemy of image worship.<HR>

<P>
We may be told that, before we draw parallels between our tenets
and those of the Bible, we have to show better evidence of the
existence of the giants of the Fourth Race than the reference
to them found in Genesis. We answer, that the proofs we give are
more satisfactory, at any rate they belong to a more literary
and scientific evidence, than those of Noah's Deluge will ever
be. Even the historical works of China are full of such reminiscences
about the Fourth Race. In <EM>Shoo-King </EM>(4th part, chap.
<STRONG>XXVII</STRONG>, p. 291), anyone can read in the French
translation, &quot;When the Mao-tse&quot; (&quot;that antediluvian
and perverted race,&quot; explains the Annotator, &quot;which
had retired in the days of old to the rocky caves, and the descendants
of whom are said to be still found in the neighbourhood of Canton&quot;),**

* Treating of the Chinese Dragon and the literature of China,
Mr. Ch. Gould writes in his &quot;<EM>Mythical Monsters</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>on p. 212: -- &quot;Its mythologies, histories, religions,
popular stories and proverbs, all teem with references to a mysterious
being <EM>who has a physical</EM> <EM>nature and spiritual attributes.
</EM>Gifted with an accepted form, which he has the supernatural
power of casting off for the assumption of others, he has the
power of influencing the weather, producing droughts or fertilizing
rains at pleasure, of raising tempests and allaying them. Volumes
could be compiled from the scattered legends which everywhere
abound relating to this subject. . . . &quot;
<P>
This &quot;mysterious being&quot; is the <EM>mythical </EM>Dragon,
<EM>i.e.</EM>, the symbol of the <EM>historical,</EM> actual Adept,
the master and professor of occult sciences of old. It is stated
already elsewhere, that the great &quot;magicians&quot; of the
Fourth and Fifth Races were generally called the &quot;Serpents&quot;
and the &quot;Dragons&quot; after their progenitors. All these
belonged to the hierarchy of the so-called &quot;Fiery Dragons
of Wisdom,&quot; the Dhyan Chohans, answering to the Agnishwatta
Pitris, the Maruts and Rudras generally, as the issue of Rudra
their father, identified with the god of fire. More is said in
the text. Now Clement, an initiated Neo-Platonist, knew, of course,
the origin of the word &quot;Dragon,&quot; and why the initiated
Adepts were so-called, as he knew the secret of <EM>Agathodaemon,</EM>
the Christ, the seven-vowelled Serpent of the Gnostics. He knew
that the dogma of his new faith required the transformation of
all the <EM>rivals </EM>of Jehovah, the angels supposed to have
rebelled against that Elohim as the Titan-Prometheus rebelled
against Zeus, the usurper of his father's kingdom; and that &quot;Dragon&quot;
was the mystic appellation of the &quot;Sons of Wisdom&quot;;
from this knowledge came his definition, as cruel as it was arbitrary,
&quot;Serpents and Giants signify <EM>Demons,</EM>&quot;<EM> i.e.,
</EM>not &quot;Spirits,&quot; but <EM>Devils, </EM>in Church parlance.
<P>
** &quot;What would you say to our affirmation that the Chinese
-- I speak of the inland, the true Chinaman, not of the hybrid
mixture between the Fourth and Fifth Races now occupying the throne,
the aborigines who belong in their unallied nationality wholly
to the highest and last branch of the Fourth Race -- reached their
highest civilization when the Fifth had hardly appeared in Asia&quot;
(<EM>Esoteric Buddhism, </EM>p. 67). And this handful of the inland
Chinese are all of a very high stature. Could the most ancient
<STRONG>MSS.</STRONG> in the Lolo language (that of the aborigines
of China) be got at and translated correctly, many a priceless
piece of evidence would be found. But they are as rare as their
language is unintelligible. So far, one or two European archaeologists
only have been able to procure such priceless works.<HR>

&quot;<EM>according to our ancient documents, </EM>had, owing
to the beguilements of <EM>Tchy-Yeoo, </EM>troubled all the earth,
it became full of brigands. . . . .&quot; The Lord Chang-ty (a
king of the <EM>divine </EM>dynasty) saw that his people had lost
the last vestiges of virtue. Then he commanded Tehong and Lhy
(two lower Dhyan Chohans) to cut away every communication between
heaven and earth. Since then, there was no more <EM>going up and</EM>
<EM>down!</EM>&quot;<EM>**</EM> 
<P>
&quot;Going up and down&quot; means an untrammelled communication
and intercourse between the two worlds. Not being in a position
to give out a full and detailed history of the Third and Fourth
Races, as many isolated facts concerning them as are permitted
must be now collated together; especially those corroborated by
direct as well as by inferential evidence found in ancient literature
and history. As the &quot;coats of skin&quot; of men thickened,
and they fell more and more into physical sin, the intercourse
between physical and ethereal <EM>divine</EM> man was stopped.
The veil of matter between the two planes became too dense for
even the inner man to penetrate. The mysteries of Heaven and Earth,
revealed to the Third Race by their celestial teachers in the
days of their purity, became a great focus of light, the rays
from which became necessarily weakened as they were diffused and
shed upon an uncongenial, because too material soil. With the
masses they degenerated into Sorcery, taking later on the shape
of exoteric religions, of idolatry full of superstitions, and
man-, or hero-worship. Alone a handful of primitive men -- in
whom the spark of divine Wisdom burnt bright, and only strengthened
in its intensity as it got dimmer and dimmer with every age in
those who turned it to bad purposes -- remained the elect custodians
of the Mysteries revealed to mankind by the divine Teachers. There
were those among them, who remained in their <EM>Kumaric</EM>
condition from the beginning; and tradition whispers, what the
secret teachings affirm, namely, that these Elect were the germ
of a Hierarchy <EM>which never died since that period: -</EM>-

<EM>the ignorant, to remain till the end of the present Manvantara.
Though</EM> <EM>unseen, they are ever present. When people say
of one of them, </EM>&quot;<EM>He is</EM> <EM>dead</EM>&quot;;<EM>
behold, he is alive and under another form. These are the Head,</EM>
<EM>the Heart, the Soul, and the Seed of undying knowledge </EM>(Gnyana).
<EM>Thou shalt never speak, O Lanoo, of these great ones </EM>(Maha
. . <EM>.</EM>)<EM> before</EM> <EM>a multitude, mentioning them
by their names. The wise alone will</EM> <EM>understand.</EM>&quot;<EM>
. . . </EM>* (Catechism of the inner Schools.)
<P>
It is these sacred &quot;Four&quot; who have been allegorized
and symbolized in the &quot;<EM>Linga Purana,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>which
states that Vamadeva (Siva) as Kumara is reborn in each Kalpa
(<EM>Race </EM>in this instance), as four youths -- four, white;
four, red; four, yellow; and four, dark or brown. Let us remember
that Siva is pre-eminently and chiefly an ascetic, the patron
of all Yogis and Adepts, and the allegory will become quite comprehensible.
It is the spirit of Divine Wisdom and chaste asceticism itself
which incarnates in these Elect. It is only after <EM>getting
married </EM>and being dragged by the gods from his terrible ascetic
life, that Rudra becomes Siva, a god, and not one of a very virtuous
or merciful type, in the Hindu Pantheon. Higher than the &quot;Four&quot;
is only <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE on Earth as in Heavens -- that still
more mysterious and solitary Being described in Book I.
<P>
We have now to examine the nature of the &quot;Sons of the Flame&quot;
and of &quot;Dark Wisdom,&quot; as well as the <EM>pros</EM> and
<EM>cons </EM>of the Satanic assumption.
<P>
Such broken sentences as could be made out from the fragments
on the tile, which George Smith calls &quot;the Curse after the
Fall&quot; (see p. 81 of his &quot;Chaldean Account of Genesis&quot;),
are of course allegorical; yet they corroborate that which is
taught of the true nature of the <EM>fall of the angels</EM> in
our Books. Thus, it is said in line 12 that the &quot;Lord of
the earth his name called out, the father Elu&quot; (Elohim),
and pronounced his curse, which &quot;The God Hea heard, and his
liver was angry, because <EM>his </EM>man (Angelic man) had corrupted
his purity (14 <EM>and </EM>15),&quot; for which Hea expresses
the desire that &quot;<EM> </EM>'<EM>Wisdom and knowledge</EM>'<EM>
</EM>hostilely may they injure him (man).&quot;
<P>
The latter sentence points to the direct connection of the Chaldean
with the Genetic account. While Hea tries to bring to nought the
wisdom and knowledge gained by man, through his newly-acquired
intellectual and conscious capacity of creating in his turn (thus
taking the monopoly of creation out of the hands of God (the Gods)),
the Elohim do the same in the third chapter of <EM>Genesis. </EM>Therefore
the Elohim sent him out of Eden.
<P>
But this was of no avail. For the spirit of divine Wisdom being

</EM>name is &quot;a most secret arcanum&quot; --- &quot;a secret

upon and <EM>in </EM>man -- verily the Serpent of Eternity and
all Knowledge, that<EM> Manasic </EM>spirit, which made him learn
the secret of <EM>creation </EM>on the Kriyasaktic, and of procreation
on the earthly planes -- led him as naturally to discover his
way to immortality, notwithstanding the jealousy of all the Gods.
<P>
The early Atlanto-Lemurians are charged with taking unto themselves
(divine incarnations) wives of a lower race, namely, the race
of the hitherto mindless men. Every ancient Scripture has the
same, more or less disfigured legend. Primarily, the angelic <EM>Fall</EM>,
which has transformed the &quot;first-born&quot; of God into the
Asuras, or into the Ahriman and Typhon of the &quot;pagans&quot;
(<EM>i.e</EM>., if the accounts given in the Book of Enoch,* and
in Hermes, in Puranas and Bible are taken literally), when read
esoterically means simply this: --
<P>
Sentences such as: &quot;In his (Satan's) ambition he raises his
hand against the Sanctuary of the God of Heaven&quot; etc., ought
to read: &quot;Prompted by the law of eternal evolution and Karma,
the angel incarnated on earth in man; and as his Wisdom and Knowledge
are still divine, although his body is earthly, he is (allegorically)
accused of divulging the mysteries of Heaven.&quot; He combines
and uses the two for purposes of human, instead of super-human,
procreation. Henceforth, &quot;man will <EM>beget, </EM>not <EM>create.</EM>&quot;<EM>**
</EM>But as, by so doing, he has to use
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Returning once more to the most important subject in the archaic
Cosmogony, it may be said that even in the Norse legends, in the
Sacred Scrolls of the goddess Saga, we find Loki, the brother
by blood of Odin (as Typhon, Ahriman, and others are brothers
of Osiris and Ormazd), becoming evil only later, when he has mixed
too long with humanity. Like all other fire or light gods -- fire
burning and destroying as well as warming and giving life -- he
ended by being accepted in the destructive sense of &quot;fire.&quot;
The name <EM>Loki, </EM>we learn (&quot;<EM>Asgard and the Gods,</EM>&quot;<EM>
p.</EM> 250)<EM>, </EM>has been derived from the old word &quot;liechan,&quot;
to enlighten. It has, therefore, the same origin as the Latin
&quot;<EM>lux</EM>, light.&quot; Hence <EM>Loki </EM>is identical
with Lucifer (light-bringer). This title, given to the Prince
of Darkness, is very suggestive and is a <EM>vindication </EM>in
itself against theological slander. But <EM>Loki </EM>is still
more closely related to Prometheus, as he is shown chained to
a sharp rock, while Lucifer, identified with Satan, was chained
down in hell; a circumstance, however, which prevented neither
of them from acting in all freedom on Earth, if we accept the
theological paradox in its fulness. <EM>Loki </EM>is a beneficent,
generous and powerful god in the beginning of times, and the principle
of good, not of evil, in early Scandinavian theogony.
<P>
** The Greek mythos just alluded to a few pages back, namely the
mutilation of <EM>Uranos </EM>by his son <EM>Kronos </EM>in the
Greek theogony, is an allusion to this theft by the Son of the
Earth and Heavens of the <EM>divine creative fire.</EM> If<EM>
Uranos, </EM>the personification of the celestial Powers, has
to stop creating (he is made impotent by <EM>Kronos, </EM>the
god <EM>in time</EM>)<EM> </EM>so, in the Egyptian Cosmogony it
is Thot, the god of Wisdom, who regulates this fight between Horus
and Set, the latter being served by the former as Uranos is by
Kronos (<EM>see </EM>&quot;<EM>Book of the Dead</EM>&quot;<EM>
ch. XVII. V. </EM>26). In the Babylonian account it is the god
Zu, who strips &quot;the father of the gods&quot; of <EM>umsimi
-- </EM>the ideal creative organ not the <EM>crown </EM>(!) as
G. Smith thought (see pp. 115 and 116 Chaldean Account). For,
in the fragment K. 3454 (British Museum) it is said very clearly,
that Zu having stripped the &quot;venerable [[Footnote continued

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 284 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
his weak body as the means of procreation, that body will pay
the penalty for this wisdom, carried from heaven down to the earth;
hence the corruption of physical purity will become a temporary
curse.
<P>
The mediaeval Kabalists knew this well, since one of them did
not fear to write: &quot;The Kabala was first taught by God himself
to a select Company of Angels who formed a theosophic school in
Paradise. After the <STRONG>F</STRONG>ALL the Angels most <EM>graciously
communicated this heavenly doctrine to the disobedient child of
Earth, </EM>to furnish the protoplasts with the means of returning
to their pristine nobility and felicity&quot; (<EM>Quoted by</EM>
<EM>Christian Ginsburg from the Kabala</EM>)<EM>. </EM>This shows
how the event -- of the Sons of God, marrying and imparting the
divine Secrets of Heaven to the daughters of men -- allegorically
told by Enoch and in the sixth chapter of Genesis was interpreted
by the Christian Kabalists. The whole of this period may be regarded
as the <EM>pre-human </EM>period, that of divine man, or as <EM>plastic
</EM>Protestant theology now has it -- the <EM>pre</EM>-adamite
period. But even Genesis begins its<EM> real </EM>history (<EM>chap.
</EM>vi.) by the <EM>giants</EM> of &quot;those days&quot; and
the &quot;Sons of god&quot; marrying and teaching their wives
-- the daughters of man.
<P>
This period is the one described in the Puranas; and relating
as it does to days lost in archaic ages, hence pre-historic, how
can any anthropologist feel certain whether the mankind of that
period was or was not as he knows it now? The whole <EM>personnel
</EM>of the Brahmanas and Puranas -- the Rishis, Prajapatis, Manus,
their wives and progeny -- belong to that pre-human period. All
these are the <EM>Seed </EM>of Humanity, so to speak. It is around
these &quot;Sons of God,&quot; the &quot;Mind born&quot; astral
children of Brahma, that our physical frames have grown and developed
to what they are now. For, the Puranic histories of all those
men are those of our Monads, in their various and numberless incarnations
on this and other spheres, events perceived by the &quot;Siva
eye&quot; of the ancient Seers, (the &quot;third eye&quot; of
our Stanzas) and described allegorically. Later on, they were
disfigured for Sectarian purposes; mutilated, but still left with
a considerable ground-work of truth in them. Nor is the philosophy
less profound in such allegories for being so thickly veiled by
the overgrowth of fancy.
<P>
But with the Fourth Race we reach the purely human period. Those
who were hitherto semi-divine Beings, self-imprisoned in bodies
which were human only in appearance, became physiologically changed
and took unto themselves wives who were entirely human and fair
to look

(15). As the <EM>umsimi </EM>was <EM>on the seat </EM>of Bel,
it could hardly be the &quot;crown.&quot; A fourth version is
in the Bible. Ham is the Chaldean Zu, and both are cursed for
the same allegorically described crime.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 285 THE TIBETAN LILITH.</H6>

<P>
at, but in whom <EM>lower, more material, </EM>though sidereal,
beings had incarnated. These beings in female forms (Lilith is
the prototype of these in the Jewish traditions) are called in
the esoteric accounts &quot;Khado&quot; (Dakini, in Sanskrit).
Allegorical legends call the chief of these Liliths, <EM>Sangye
Khado, </EM>(Buddha Dakini, in Sanskrit); all are credited with
the art of &quot;walking in the air,&quot; and the greatest <EM>kindness</EM>
<EM>to mortals</EM>;<EM> </EM>but <EM>no mind -- </EM>only animal
instinct.*
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>) This is the beginning of a worship which, ages later,
was doomed to degenerate into phallicism and sexual worship. It
began by the worship of the human body -- that &quot;miracle of
miracles,&quot; as an English author calls it -- and ended by
that of its respective sexes. The worshippers were giants in stature;
but they were giants in knowledge and learning, though it came
to them more easily than it does to the men of our modern times.
Their Science was innate in them. The Lemuro-Atlantean had no
need of discovering and fixing in his memory that which his informing
<STRONG>P</STRONG>RINCIPLE <EM>knew </EM>at the moment of its
incarnation. Time alone, and the ever-growing obtuseness of the
matter in which the <EM>Principles </EM>had clothed themselves,
could, the one, weaken the memory of their pre-natal knowledge,
the other, blunt and even extinguish every spark of the spiritual
and divine in them. Therefore had they, from the first, fallen
victims to their animal natures and bred &quot;monsters&quot;
-- <EM>i.e.</EM>, men of distinct varieties from themselves.
<P>
Speaking of the Giants, Creuzer describes them well in saying
that:--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Those children of Heaven and Earth were endowed at their
birth by the <I>Sovereign Powers, </I>the authors of their being,
with extraordinary faculties both moral and physical. They <I>commanded
the Elements, knew the secrets of</I> <I>heaven and the earth,
of the sea and the whole world, and read futurity in</I> the stars.
. . . It seems, indeed, as though one has to deal, when reading
of them, <I>not with men as we are </I>but with Spirits of the
Elements sprung from the bosom of Nature and having full sway
over her. . . . All these beings <I>are</I> <I>marked with a character
</I>of MAGIC and SORCERY. . . . &quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And so they were, those (now) legendary heroes of the pre-historic,
still, once really existing races. Creuzer was wise in his generation,
for he did not charge with deliberate deceit, or dullness and
superstition, an endless series of recognized philosophers, who
mention these races and assert that, even in their own time, they
saw their fossils. There were sceptics in days of old -- no fewer
and as great as they are now. But even a Lucian, a Democritus
and an Epicurus yielded to the evidence of <EM>facts </EM>and
showed the discriminative capacity of really
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* These are the beings whose legendary existence has served as
a ground-work upon which to build the rabbinical Lilith, and what
the believers in the Bible would term the antediluvian women,
and the Kabalists the pre-Adamite races. They are no fiction --
this is certain, however fantastic the exuberance of later growth.
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 286 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
great intellects, which can distinguish fiction from fact, and
truth from exaggeration and fraud. Ancient writers were no more
fools than our modern wise men are; for, as well remarked by the
author of some &quot;<EM>Notes</EM> <EM>on Aristotle</EM>'<EM>s
Psychology in Relation to Modern Thought</EM>&quot; (<EM>in Mind</EM>)<EM>:</EM>--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The common division of history into ancient and modern is
. . . . misleading. The Greeks in the 4th century, <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>.
were in many respects moderns especially, we may add, in their
scepticism. They were not very likely to accept <I>fables </I>so
easily . . . . .&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Yet the &quot;Lemurians&quot; and the Atlanteans, &quot;those
children of Heaven and Earth,&quot; were indeed marked with a
character of SORCERY; for the Esoteric doctrine charges them precisely
with that, which, if believed, would put an end to the difficulties
of science with regard to the origin of man, or rather, his anatomical
similarities to the <EM>Anthropoid Ape. </EM>It accuses them of
having committed the (<EM>to us</EM>)<EM> </EM>abominable crime
of breeding with so-called &quot;animals,&quot; and thus producing
a truly pithecoid species, now extinct. Of course, as in the question
of spontaneous generation -- in which Esoteric Science believes,
and which it teaches -- the possibility of such a cross-breed
between man and an animal of any kind will be denied. But apart
from the consideration that in those early days, as already remarked,
neither the human Atlantean giants, nor yet the &quot;animals,&quot;
were the physiologically perfect men and mammalians that are now
known to us, the modern notions upon this subject -- those of
the physiologists included -- are too uncertain and fluctuating
to permit them an absolute denial <EM>a priori </EM>of such a
fact.
<P>
A careful perusal of the Commentaries would make one think that
the Being that the new &quot;<EM>incarnate</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>bred
with, was called an &quot;animal,&quot; not because he was no
human being, but rather because he was so dissimilar physically
and mentally to the more perfect races, which had developed physiologically
at an earlier period. Remember Stanza <STRONG>VII.</STRONG> and
what is said in its first verse (24th): -- that when the &quot;Sons
of Wisdom&quot; came to incarnate the first time, some of them
incarnated fully, others projected into the forms only <EM>a spark,
</EM>while some of the shadows were left over from being <EM>filled
</EM>and perfected, till the Fourth Race. Those races, then, which
&quot;remained destitute of knowledge,&quot; or those again which
were left &quot;mindless,&quot; remained as they were, even after
the natural separation of the sexes. It is these who committed
the first cross-breeding, so to speak, and bred monsters; and
it is from the descendants of these that the Atlanteans chose
their wives. Adam and Eve were supposed, with Cain and Abel, to
be the only <EM>human </EM>family on Earth. Yet we see Cain going
to the land of Nod and taking there a wife. Evidently one race
only was supposed perfect enough to be called human; and, even
in our own day, while the Singhalese <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 287 THE RACES OF MEN NOT ALL HUMAN.</H6>

<P>
regard the Veddhas of their jungles as <EM>speaking animals </EM>and
no more, some British people believe firmly, in their arrogance,
that every other human family -- especially the dark Indians --
is an <EM>inferior </EM>race. Moreover there are naturalists who
have sincerely considered the problem whether some savage tribes
-- like the Bushmen for instance -- can be regarded as <EM>men
</EM>at all. The Commentary says, in describing that species (or
race) of animals &quot;fair to look at&quot; as a biped: -- &quot;<EM>Having</EM>
<EM>human shape, but having the lower extremities, from the waist
down,</EM> <EM>covered with hair.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Hence the
race of the <EM>satyrs, </EM>perhaps.
<P>
If men existed two million years ago, they must have been -- just
as the animals were -- quite different physically and anatomically
from what they have become; and they were nearer then to the type
of pure mammalian animal than they are now. Anyhow, we learn that
the animal world breeds strictly <EM>inter se, i.e., </EM>in accordance
with genus and species -- only since the appearance <EM>on this
earth </EM>of the Atlantean race. As demonstrated by the author
of that able work, &quot;<EM>Modern Science and</EM> <EM>Modern
Thought,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>this idea of the refusal to breed
with another species, or that sterility is the only result of
such breeding, &quot;appears to be a <EM>prima facie </EM>deduction
rather than an absolute law&quot; even now. He shows that &quot;different
species, do, in fact, often breed together, as may be seen in
the familiar instance of the horse and ass. It is true that in
this case the mule is sterile. . . . but this rule is not universal,
and recently one new hybrid race, that of the leporine, or hare-rabbit,
has been created which is perfectly fertile.&quot; The progeny
of wolf and dog is also instanced, as that of several other domestic
animals (p. 101); &quot;like foxes and dogs again, and the modern
Swiss cattle shown by Rutimeyer as descended from three distinct
species of fossil-oxen, the <EM>Bos primigenius,</EM> <EM>Bos
longifrons and Bos frontosus.</EM>&quot;<EM> Yet some of those
species, as the ape</EM> <EM>family, which so clearly resembles
man in physical structure, </EM>contain, we are told, &quot;numerous
branches, which graduate into one another, but the extremes of
which differ more widely than man does from the highest of the
ape series&quot; -- the gorilla and chimpanzee, for instance (see
<EM>Addenda</EM>)<EM>.</EM> 
<P>
Thus Mr. Darwin's remark -- or shall we say the remark of Linnaeus?
<EM>-- natura non facit saltum, </EM>is not only corroborated
by Esoteric Science but would -- were there any chance of the
real doctrine being accepted by any others than its direct votaries
-- reconcile in more than one way, if not entirely, the modern
Evolution theory with facts, as also with the absolute failure
of the Anthropologists to meet with the &quot;missing link&quot;
in our Fourth Round geological formations.
<P>
We will show elsewhere that, however unconsciously to itself,
modern Science pleads our case upon its own admissions, and that
de Quatrefages is perfectly right, when he suggests in his last
work, that it is far more likely that the anthropoid ape should
be discovered to be<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 288 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
<EM>the descendant of man, </EM>than that these two types should
have a common, fantastic and nowhere-to-be-found ancestor. Thus
the wisdom of the compilers of the old Stanzas is vindicated by
at least one eminent man of Science, and the Occultist prefers
to believe as he ever did that --
<P>
&quot;<EM>Man was the first and highest </EM>(mammalian) <EM>animal
that appeared in</EM> <EM>this </EM>(Fourth Round) <EM>creation.
Then came still huger animals</EM>;<EM> and last</EM> <EM>of all
the dumb man who walks on all fours.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>For,<EM>
&quot;the Rakshasas </EM>(giant-demons) <EM>and Daityas </EM>(<EM>Titans</EM>)<EM>
of the </EM>&quot;<EM>White Dwipa</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(continent)
<EM>spoiled his </EM>(the dumb man's) <EM>Sires.</EM>&quot; (Commentary.)
<P>
Furthermore, as we see, there are anthropologists who have traced
man back to an epoch which goes far to break down the apparent
barrier that exists between the chronologies of modern science
and the Archaic Doctrine. It is true that English scientists generally
have declined to commit themselves to the sanction of the hypothesis
of even a Tertiary Man. They, each and all, measure the antiquity
of Homo primigenius by their own lights and prejudices. Huxley,
indeed, ventures to speculate on a possible Pliocene or Miocene
Man. Prof. Seeman and Mr. Grant Allen have relegated his advent
to the Eocene, but, speaking generally, English scientists consider
that we cannot safely go beyond the quaternary. Unfortunately,
the facts do not accommodate the too cautious reserve of these
latter. The French school of anthropology, basing their views
on the discoveries of l'Abbe Bourgeois, Capellini, and others,
has accepted, almost without exception, the doctrine that the
traces of our ancestors are certainly to be found in the Miocene,
while M. de Quatrefages now inclines to postulate a Secondary-Age
Man. Further on we shall compare such estimates with the figures
given in the Brahminical exoteric books which approximate to the
esoteric teaching.
<P>
(<EM>d</EM>)<EM> </EM>. . . . <EM>Then, </EM>&quot;<EM>the third
eye acted no longer,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>says the Stanza, because
MAN had sunk too deep into the mire of matter.
<P>
What is the meaning of this strange and weird statement in Verse
42, concerning the &quot;third eye of the Third Race which had
died and acted no longer&quot;?
<P>
A few more occult teachings must now be given with reference to
this point as well as some others. The history of the Third and
Fourth Races must be amplified, in order that it may throw some
more light on the development of our present humanity; and show
how the faculties, called into activity by occult training, restore
man to the position he previously occupied in reference to spiritual
perception and consciousness. But the phenomenon of the third
Eye has to be first explained.
