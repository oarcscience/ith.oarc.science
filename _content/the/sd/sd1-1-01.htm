<H5>SEVEN STANZAS TRANSLATED WITH COMMENTARIES<BR>
FROM THE<BR>
SECRET BOOK OF DZYAN.</H5>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page 26]]</H6>

<P>
Nor Aught nor Nought existed; yon bright sky<BR>
Was not, nor heaven's broad roof outstretched above.<BR>
What covered all? what sheltered? what concealed?<BR>
Was it the water's fathomless abyss?<BR>
There was not death -- yet there was nought immortal,<BR>
There was no confine betwixt day and night;<BR>
The only One breathed breathless by itself,<BR>
Other than It there nothing since has been.<BR>
Darkness there was, and all at first was veiled<BR>
In gloom profound -- an ocean without light --<BR>
The germ that still lay covered in the husk<BR>
Burst forth, one nature, from the fervent heat.
<P>
. . . . . . . .
<P>
Who knows the secret? who proclaimed it here?<BR>
Whence, whence this manifold creation sprang?<BR>
The Gods themselves came later into being --<BR>
Who knows from whence this great creation sprang?<BR>
That, whence all this great creation came,<BR>
Whether Its will created or was mute,<BR>
The Most High Seer that is in highest heaven,<BR>
He knows it -- or perchance even He knows not.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Gazing into eternity . . .<BR>
Ere the foundations of the earth were laid,
<P>
. . . . .
<P>
Thou wert. And when the subterranean flame<BR>
Shall burst its prison and devour the frame . . .<BR>
Thou shalt be still as Thou wert before<BR>
And knew no change, when time shall be no more.<BR>
Oh! endless thought, divine <STRONG>E</STRONG>TERNITY.&quot;<HR>

---------------------
<H5>STANZA I.</H5>

<P>
1. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE ETERNAL PARENT WRAPPED IN HER EVER INVISIBLE
ROBES HAD SLUMBERED ONCE AGAIN FOR SEVEN ETERNITIES.
<P>
2. <STRONG>T</STRONG>IME WAS NOT, FOR IT LAY ASLEEP IN THE INFINITE
BOSOM OF DURATION.
<P>
3. <STRONG>U</STRONG>NIVERSAL MIND WAS NOT, FOR THERE WERE NO
<STRONG>A</STRONG>H-HI TO CONTAIN IT.
<P>
4. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE SEVEN WAYS TO BLISS WERE NOT. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE
GREAT CAUSES OF MISERY WERE NOT, FOR THERE WAS NO ONE TO PRODUCE
AND GET ENSNARED BY THEM.
<P>
5. <STRONG>D</STRONG>ARKNESS ALONE FILLED THE BOUNDLESS ALL, FOR
FATHER, MOTHER AND SON WERE ONCE MORE ONE, AND THE SON HAD NOT
AWAKENED YET FOR THE NEW WHEEL, AND HIS PILGRIMAGE THEREON.
<P>
6. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE SEVEN SUBLIME LORDS AND THE SEVEN TRUTHS
HAD CEASED TO BE, AND THE <STRONG>U</STRONG>NIVERSE, THE SON OF
<STRONG>N</STRONG>ECESSITY, WAS IMMERSED IN <STRONG>P</STRONG>ARANISHPANNA,
TO BE OUTBREATHED BY THAT WHICH IS AND YET IS NOT. <STRONG>N</STRONG>AUGHT
WAS.
<P>
7. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE CAUSES OF EXISTENCE HAD BEEN DONE AWAY
WITH; THE VISIBLE THAT WAS, AND THE INVISIBLE THAT IS, RESTED
IN ETERNAL NON-BEING -- THE ONE BEING.
<P>
8. <STRONG>A</STRONG>LONE THE ONE FORM OF EXISTENCE STRETCHED
BOUNDLESS, INFINITE, CAUSELESS, IN DREAMLESS SLEEP; AND LIFE PULSATED
UNCONSCIOUS IN UNIVERSAL SPACE, THROUGHOUT THAT ALL-PRESENCE WHICH
IS SENSED BY THE OPENED EYE OF THE <STRONG>D</STRONG>ANGMA.
<P>
9. <STRONG>B</STRONG>UT WHERE WAS THE <STRONG>D</STRONG>ANGMA
WHEN THE <STRONG>A</STRONG>LAYA OF THE UNIVERSE WAS IN <STRONG>P</STRONG>ARAMARTHA
AND THE GREAT WHEEL WAS <STRONG>A</STRONG>NUPADAKA?<HR>

<H5>STANZA II.</H5>

<P>
1. . . . <STRONG>W</STRONG>HERE WERE THE BUILDERS, THE LUMINOUS
SONS OF <STRONG>M</STRONG>ANVANTARIC DAWN? . . . <STRONG>I</STRONG>N
THE UNKNOWN DARKNESS IN THEIR <STRONG>A</STRONG>H-HI <STRONG>P</STRONG>ARANISHPANNA.
THE PRODUCERS OF FORM FROM NO-FORM -- THE ROOT OF THE WORLD --
THE <STRONG>D</STRONG>EVAMATRI AND <STRONG>S</STRONG>VABHAVAT,
RESTED IN THE BLISS OF NON-BEING.
<P>
2. . . . <STRONG>W</STRONG>HERE WAS SILENCE? <STRONG>W</STRONG>HERE
THE EARS TO SENSE IT? <STRONG>N</STRONG>O, THERE WAS NEITHER SILENCE
NOR SOUND; NAUGHT SAVE CEASELESS ETERNAL BREATH, WHICH KNOWS ITSELF
NOT.
<P>
3. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE HOUR HAD NOT YET STRUCK; THE RAY HAD NOT
YET FLASHED INTO THE <STRONG>G</STRONG>ERM; THE <STRONG>M</STRONG>ATRIPADMA
HAD NOT YET SWOLLEN.
<P>
4. <STRONG>H</STRONG>ER HEART HAD NOT YET OPENED FOR THE ONE RAY
TO ENTER, THENCE TO FALL, AS THREE INTO FOUR, INTO THE LAP OF
<STRONG>M</STRONG>AYA.
<P>
5. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE SEVEN SONS WERE NOT YET BORN FROM THE
WEB OF LIGHT. <STRONG>D</STRONG>ARKNESS ALONE WAS FATHER-MOTHER,
<STRONG>S</STRONG>VABHAVAT; AND <STRONG>S</STRONG>VABHAVAT WAS
IN DARKNESS.
<P>
6. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HESE TWO ARE THE <STRONG>G</STRONG>ERM, AND
THE <STRONG>G</STRONG>ERM IS ONE. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>U</STRONG>NIVERSE
WAS STILL CONCEALED IN THE <STRONG>D</STRONG>IVINE THOUGHT AND
THE <STRONG>D</STRONG>IVINE BOSOM. . . .

<H5>STANZA III.</H5>

<P>
1. . . . <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE LAST VIBRATION OF THE SEVENTH ETERNITY
THRILLS THROUGH INFINITUDE. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE MOTHER SWELLS,
EXPANDING FROM WITHIN WITHOUT, LIKE THE BUD OF THE LOTUS.
<P>
2. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE VIBRATION SWEEPS ALONG, TOUCHING WITH
ITS SWIFT WING THE WHOLE UNIVERSE AND THE GERM THAT DWELLETH IN
DARKNESS: <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE DARKNESS THAT BREATHES OVER THE
SLUMBERING WATERS OF LIFE. . .
<P>
3. <STRONG>D</STRONG>ARKNESS RADIATES LIGHT, AND LIGHT DROPS ONE
SOLITARY RAY INTO THE MOTHER-DEEP. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE RAY SHOOTS
THROUGH THE VIRGIN EGG, THE RAY CAUSES THE ETERNAL EGG TO THRILL,
AND DROP THE NON-ETERNAL GERM, WHICH CONDENSES INTO THE WORLD-EGG.

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 29 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
4. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HEN THE THREE FALL INTO THE FOUR. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE
RADIANT ESSENCE BECOMES SEVEN INSIDE, SEVEN OUTSIDE. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE
LUMINOUS EGG, WHICH IN ITSELF IS THREE, CURDLES AND SPREADS IN
MILK-WHITE CURDS THROUGHOUT THE DEPTHS OF MOTHER, THE ROOT THAT
GROWS IN THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN OF LIFE.
<P>
5. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE ROOT REMAINS, THE LIGHT REMAINS, THE CURDS
REMAIN, AND STILL <STRONG>O</STRONG>EAOHOO IS ONE.
<P>
6. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE ROOT OF LIFE WAS IN EVERY DROP OF THE
OCEAN OF IMMORTALITY, AND THE OCEAN WAS RADIANT LIGHT, WHICH WAS
FIRE, AND HEAT, AND MOTION. <STRONG>D</STRONG>ARKNESS VANISHED
AND WAS NO MORE; IT DISAPPEARED IN ITS OWN ESSENCE, THE BODY OF
FIRE AND WATER, OR FATHER AND MOTHER.
<P>
7. <STRONG>B</STRONG>EHOLD, OH <STRONG>L</STRONG>ANOO! <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE
RADIANT CHILD OF THE TWO, THE UNPARALLELED REFULGENT GLORY: <STRONG>B</STRONG>RIGHT
<STRONG>S</STRONG>PACE <STRONG>S</STRONG>ON OF <STRONG>D</STRONG>ARK
<STRONG>S</STRONG>PACE, WHICH EMERGES FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE GREAT
DARK WATERS. <STRONG>I</STRONG>T IS <STRONG>O</STRONG>EAOHOO THE
YOUNGER, THE * * * <STRONG>H</STRONG>E SHINES FORTH AS THE SON;
HE IS THE BLAZING <STRONG>D</STRONG>IVINE <STRONG>D</STRONG>RAGON
OF <STRONG>W</STRONG>ISDOM; THE <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE IS <STRONG>F</STRONG>OUR,
AND <STRONG>F</STRONG>OUR TAKES TO ITSELF <STRONG>T</STRONG>HREE,**
AND THE <STRONG>U</STRONG>NION PRODUCES THE <STRONG>S</STRONG>APTA,
IN WHOM ARE THE SEVEN WHICH BECOME THE <STRONG>T</STRONG>RIDASA
(OR THE HOSTS AND THE MULTITUDES). <STRONG>B</STRONG>EHOLD HIM
LIFTING THE VEIL AND UNFURLING IT FROM EAST TO WEST. <STRONG>H</STRONG>E
SHUTS OUT THE ABOVE, AND LEAVES THE BELOW TO BE SEEN AS THE GREAT
ILLUSION. <STRONG>H</STRONG>E MARKS THE PLACES FOR THE SHINING
ONES, AND TURNS THE UPPER INTO A SHORELESS SEA OF FIRE, AND THE
ONE MANIFESTED INTO THE GREAT WATERS.
<P>
8. <STRONG>W</STRONG>HERE WAS THE GERM AND WHERE WAS NOW DARKNESS?
<STRONG>W</STRONG>HERE IS THE SPIRIT OF THE FLAME THAT BURNS IN
THY LAMP, OH <STRONG>L</STRONG>ANOO? <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE GERM
IS THAT, AND THAT IS LIGHT, THE WHITE BRILLIANT SON OF THE DARK
HIDDEN FATHER.
<P>
9. <STRONG>L</STRONG>IGHT IS COLD FLAME, AND FLAME IS FIRE, AND
FIRE PRODUCES HEAT, WHICH YIELDS WATER: THE WATER OF LIFE IN THE
GREAT MOTHER.
<P>
10. <STRONG>F</STRONG>ATHER-<STRONG>M</STRONG>OTHER SPIN A WEB
WHOSE UPPER END IS FASTENED TO SPIRIT -- THE LIGHT OF THE ONE
DARKNESS -- AND THE LOWER ONE TO ITS SHADOWY END, MATTER; AND
THIS WEB IS THE UNIVERSE SPUN OUT OF THE TWO SUBSTANCES MADE IN
ONE, WHICH IS <STRONG>S</STRONG>VABHAVAT.

IT; IT CONTRACTS WHEN THE BREATH OF THE MOTHER TOUCHES IT. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HEN
THE SONS DISSOCIATE AND SCATTER, TO RETURN INTO THEIR MOTHER'S
BOSOM AT THE END OF THE GREAT DAY, AND RE-BECOME ONE WITH HER;
WHEN IT IS COOLING IT BECOMES RADIANT, AND THE SONS EXPAND AND
CONTRACT THROUGH THEIR OWN SELVES AND HEARTS; THEY EMBRACE INFINITUDE.

12. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HEN <STRONG>S</STRONG>VABHAVAT SENDS <STRONG>F</STRONG>OHAT
