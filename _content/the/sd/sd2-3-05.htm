<P>
It seems, however, possible to calculate the <I>approximate </I>duration
of the geological periods from the combined data of Science and
Occultism now before us. Geology is, of course, able to determine
almost with certainty one thing -- the thickness of the several
deposits. Now, it also stands to reason that the time required
for the deposition of any stratum on a sea-bottom must bear a
strict proportion to the thickness of the mass thus formed. Doubtless
the <I>rate </I>of erosion of land and the sorting out of matter
on to ocean beds has varied from age to age, and cataclysmic changes
of various kinds break the &quot;uniformity&quot; of ordinary
geological processes. <I>Provided, however, we have some definite
numerical basis on which to work, </I>our task is rendered less
difficult than it might at first sight appear to be. Making due
allowance for variations in the rate of deposit, Professor Lefevre
gives us the <I>relative </I>figures which sum up geological time.
He does not attempt to calculate the lapse of years since the
first bed of the Laurentian rocks was deposited, but postulating
that time as = X, he presents us with the relative proportions
in which the various periods stand to it. Let us premise our estimate
by stating that, roughly speaking, the Primordial rocks are 70,000
ft., the Primary 42,000 ft., the Secondary 15,000 ft., the Tertiary
5,000 ft., and the Quaternary some 500 ft. in thickness: --
<P>
&quot;Dividing into an hundred parts the time, <I>whatever its
actual length, </I>that has passed since the dawn of life on this
earth (lower Laurentian strata), we shall be led to attribute
to the primordial age more than half of the whole duration, say
53.5; to the Primary 32.2; to the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 710 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Secondary 11.5; to the Tertiary 2.3; to the Quaternary 0.5 or
one-half per cent.&quot; (&quot;Philosophy,&quot; p. 481.)
<P>
Now, as it is certain, on occult data, that the time which has
elapsed since the first sedimentary deposits = 320,000,000 years,
we are able to infer that the: --

Eocene<BR>
Miocene<BR>
Pliocene
<P>
Quaternary lasted 1,600,000 years (probably in excess).
<P>
Such estimates harmonise with the statements of Esoteric Ethnology
in almost every particular. The <I>Tertiary </I>Atlantean part-cycle,
from the &quot;apex of glory&quot; of that Race in the early Eocene
to the great mid-Miocene cataclysm, would appear to have lasted
some 3 1/2 to four million years. If the duration of the Quaternary
is not rather (as seems likely) overestimated, the sinking of
Ruta and Daitya would be post-Tertiary. It is probable that the
results here given allow somewhat too long a period to both the
Tertiary and Quaternary, as the <I>Third Race </I>goes very far
back into the Secondary Age. Nevertheless, the figures are most
suggestive.
<P>
But the argument from <I>geological evidence </I>being only in
favour of 100,000,000 years, let us compare <I>our</I> claims
and teachings with those of<I> exact </I>science.
<P>
Mr. Edward Clodd,* in reviewing M. de Mortillet's work &quot;<I>Materiaux

man in the mid-Miocene period,** remarks that &quot;it would be

allowed only 230,000 years to our mankind. Since we learn now
that he places man &quot;in the mid-Miocene period,&quot; we must
say that the much respected Professor of Prehistoric Anthropology
(in Paris) is somewhat contradictory and inconsistent, if not
<I>naif</I> in his views.<HR>

tion teaches, and moreover, win no support from believers in special
creation and the fixity of species, to seek for so highly specialized
a mammalian as man at an early stage in the life-history of the
globe.&quot; To this, one could answer: (<I>a</I>) the doctrine
of evolution, as inaugurated by Darwin and developed by later
evolutionists, is not only the reverse of<I> infallible, </I>but
it is repudiated by several great men of science, <I>e.g</I>.,
de Quatrefages, in France, and Dr. Weismann, an <I>ex</I>-evolutionist
in Germany, and many others, the ranks of the <I>anti</I>-Darwinists
growing stronger with every year;* and (<I>b</I>) truth to be
worthy of its name, and remain truth and fact, hardly needs to
beg for support from any class or sect. For were it to <I>win
support </I>from believers in special creation, it would never
gain the favour of the evolutionists, and <I>vice versa. </I>Truth
must rest upon its own firm foundations of facts, and take its
chances for recognition, when every prejudice in the way is disposed
of. Though the question has been already fully considered in its
main aspects, it is, nevertheless, advisable to combat every so-called
&quot;<I>scientific</I>&quot;<I> </I>objection as we go along,
when making what are regarded as heretical and &quot;anti-scientific&quot;
statements.
<P>
Let us briefly glance at the divergences between orthodox and
esoteric science, on the question of the age of the globe and
of man. With the two respective synchronistic tables before him,
the reader will be enabled to see at a glance the importance of
these divergences; and to perceive, at the same time, that it
is not impossible -- nay, it is most likely -- that further discoveries
in geology and the finding of fossil remains of man will force
science to confess that it is esoteric philosophy which is right
after all, or, at any rate, nearer to the truth.

The Primordial Epoch is, science tells us, by no means devoid
of vegetable and animal life. In the Laurentian deposits are found
specimens of the<I> Eozoon Canadense -</I>- a chambered shell.
In the Silurian are discovered sea-weeds (<I>algae</I>), molluscs,
crustacea, and lower marine organisms, also the first trace of
fishes. The primordial Epoch shows algae, molluscs, crustacea,
polyps, and marine organisms, etc., etc. Science teaches, therefore,
that marine life was present from the very beginnings of time,
leaving us, however, to speculate for ourselves as to <I>how </I>life
appeared on earth. If it rejects the Biblical &quot;Creation&quot;
(as we do), why does it not give us another, approximately plausible
hypothesis?

<P>
The Esoteric Philosophy agrees with the statement made by science
(see parallel column), demurring, however, in one particular.
The 300,000,000 years of vegetable life (see &quot;Brahminical
Chronology&quot;) preceded the &quot;Divine Men,&quot; or Progenitors.
Also, no teaching denies that there were traces of life <I>within</I>
the Earth besides the <I>Eozoon Canadense </I>in the Primordial
Epoch. Only, whereas the said vegetation belonged to this Round,
the zoological relics now found in the Laurentian, Cambrian, and
Silurian systems, so called, <I>are the relics of </I>the<I> Third
</I>Round. At first <I>astral </I>like the rest, they consolidated
and materialized <I>pari passu </I>with the NEW vegetation.

the esoteric doctrine repeats that which was said above. These
are all relics of the preceding Round.**** Once, however, the
prototypes are projected out of the astral envelope of the earth,
an indefinite amount of modification ensues.

<P>
<STRONG>S</STRONG>ECONDARY (Triassic. Jurassic. Chalk or Cretaceous.)
<P>
This is the age of Reptiles, of the gigantic Megalosauri, Ichthyosauri,
Plesiosauri, etc., etc. Science denies the presence of man in
that period. If so, it has to explain how men came to know of
these monsters and describe them <I>before </I>the age of Cuvier?
The old annals of China, India, Egypt, and even of Judea are full
of them, as demonstrated elsewhere. In this period also appear
the first (marsupial) mammals***** -- Insectivorous, carnivorous,
phytophagous; and (as Prof. Owen thinks) an herbivorous hoofed
mammal.

<P>
<STRONG>S</STRONG>ECONDARY -- According to every calculation the
Third Race had already made its appearance, as during the Triassic
there were already a few mammals, and it must have separated.
<P>
This, then, is the age of the Third Race, in which the origins
of the early Fourth may be perhaps also discoverable. We are,
however, here left entirely to conjecture, as no definite data
are yet given out by the Initiates.
<P>
The analogy is but a poor one, still it may be argued that, as
the early Mammalia and pre-mammalia are shown in their evolution
merging from one kind into a higher one, anatomically, so are
the human races in their procreative processes. A parallel might
certainly be found between the Monotremata, the Didelphia (or
Marsupialia) and the placental Mammals, divided in their turn
into three orders******

</I>The parallelism of Races and geological periods here adopted,
is, so far as the origin of 1<I>st and </I>2<I>nd </I>are concerned,
purely tentative, no direct information being available. Having
previously discussed the question of a possible Race in the <I>Carboniferous
Age, </I>it is needless to renew the debate.
<P>
**** During the <I>interim</I> from one Round to another, the
globe and everything on it remains <I>in statu quo. </I>Remember,
Vegetation began in its ethereal form before what is called the
Primordial, running through the Primary, and condensing in it,
and reaching its full physical life in the Secondary.
<P>
***** Geologists tell us that &quot;in the secondary epoch, the
only mammals which have been (hitherto) discovered <I>in Europe
</I>are the fossil remains of a small marsupial or pouch-bearer.&quot;
(<I>Knowledge, March </I>31, 1882, <I>p</I> 464.) Surely the marsupial
or didelphis (the only surviving animal of the family of those
who were on earth during the presence on it of androgyne man)
cannot be the only animal that was then on earth? Its presence
speaks loudly for that of other (though unknown) mammals, besides
the monotremes and marsupials, and thus shows the appellation
of &quot;mammalian age&quot; given only to the Tertiary period
to be misleading and erroneous; as it allows one to infer that
there were no mammals, but reptiles, birds, amphibians, and fishes
alone in the Mesozoic times -- the Secondary.
<P>
****** These <I>Placentalia </I>of the third sub-class are divided,
it appears, into Villiplacentalia (placenta composed of many separate
scattered tufts), the Zonoplacentalia (girdle-shaped placenta),
and the discoplacentaIia (or discoid). Haeckel sees in the Marsupialia
<I>Didelphia</I>, one of the connecting links <I>genealogically

Tertiary period.* Why? Because man has to be shown younger than
the higher mammals. But Esoteric philosophy teaches us the reverse.
And as science is quite unable to come to anything like an approximate
conclusion as to the age of man, or even the geological periods,
therefore, even accepted only as a hypothesis, the occult teaching
is more logical and reasonable.

appear in Tertiary times and the climate, tropical in the Eocene
age, warm in the Miocene and temperate in the Pliocene, was favourable
to his presence, the proofs of his existence <I>in Europe </I>before

carried away by the fearful geological cataclysms of the Secondary

who knows? As the &quot;Historical&quot; Period has begun, with

and far earlier in the Esoteric Records, it is useless to establish
here any parallels.

* Those who feel inclined to sneer at that doctrine of Esoteric
Ethnology, which pre-supposes the existence of Man in the <I>Secondary
</I>Age, will do well to note the fact that one of the most distinguished
anthropologists of the day, M. de Quatrefages, seriously argues
in that direction. He writes: &quot;There is nothing impossible
in the supposition that he (Man) may have appeared on the globe
<I>with</I> <I>the first representatives of the type to which
he belongs in virtue of his organism.</I>&quot;<I> </I>This statement
approximates most closely to our fundamental assertion that man
preceded the other mammalia.
<P>
Professor Lefevre admits that the &quot;labours of Boucher de
Perthes, Lartet, Christy, Bourgeois, Desnoyers, Broca, de Mortillet,
Hamy, Gaudry, Capellini, and a hundred others, have overcome all
doubts and clearly established the progressive development of
the human organism and industries from the <I>Miocene epoch of
the Tertiary age.</I>&quot;<I> </I>(&quot;Philosophy,&quot; p.

of a Secondary-Age man? Simply because he is involved in the meshes
of the Darwinian Anthropology!! &quot;The origin of man is bound
up with that of the higher mammals;&quot; he appeared &quot;only

only a provisional working-hypothesis -- the actual chronology

*** The above parallels stand good only if Professor Croll's earlier
calculations are adopted, namely, of 15,000,000 years since the
beginning of the Eocene period (see Charles Gould's &quot;Mythical
Monsters,&quot; p. 84), not those in his &quot;Climate and Time,&quot;
which allow only 2 1/2 million years', or at the utmost three
million years' duration to the Tertiary age. This, however, would
make the whole duration of the incrusted age of the world only
131,600,000 years according to Professor Winchell, whereas in
the Esoteric doctrine, sedimentation began in <I>this Round </I>approximately
over 320 million years ago. Yet his calculations do not clash
much with ours with regard to the epochs of glacial periods in
the Tertiary age, which is called in our Esoteric books the age
of the &quot;Pigmies.&quot; With regard to the 320 millions of
years assigned to sedimentation, it must be noted that even a
greater time elapsed during the preparation of this globe for
the Fourth Round <I>previous to stratification.</I> 
<P>
**** Though we apply the term &quot;truly human,&quot; only to
the Fourth Atlantean Root-Race, yet the Third Race is almost human
in its latest portion, since it is during its fifth sub-race that
mankind <I>separated</I> sexually, and that the <I>first man was
born </I>according to the now normal process. This &quot;first
man&quot; answers in the Bible (<I>Genesis</I>)<I> </I>to Enos
or Henoch, son of Seth (ch. iv.).
<P>
***** Geology records the former existence of a universal ocean,
sheets of marine sediments uniformly present everywhere testifying
to it; but, it is not even the epoch referred to in the allegory
of Vaivasvata Manu. The latter is a <I>Deva-Man </I>(or Manu)
saving in an ark (the <I>female</I> principle) the germs of humanity,
and also the seven Rishis -- who stand here as the symbols for
the seven human principles -- of which allegory we have spoken
elsewhere. The &quot;Universal Deluge&quot; is the watery abyss
of the Primordial Principle of Berosus. (<I>See Stanzas from </I>2<I>
to </I>8 in Part I.). How, if Croll allowed fifteen million years
to have elapsed since the Eocene period (which we state on the
authority of a Geologist, Mr. Ch. Gould) only 60 millions are
assigned by him &quot;since the beginning of the Cambrian period,
in the <I>Primordial Age</I>&quot;<I> -- </I>passes comprehension.
The Secondary strata are twice the thickness of the Tertiary,
and Geology thus shows the Secondary age alone to be of twice
the length of the Tertiary. Shall we then accept only 15 million
years for both the Primary and the Primordial? No wonder Darwin
rejected the calculation.
<P>
****** We hope that we have furnished all the Scientific data
for it elsewhere.

a considerable period must have supervened after the departure
of Palaeolithic man and before the arrival of his Neolithic successor.&quot;

<P>
man is made out almost an abject savage, his lake dwellings notwithstanding.*
For see what a learned geologist, Mr. Charles Gould, tells the
reader in his &quot;Mythical Monsters&quot;: --
<P>
&quot;Palaeolithic men were unacquainted with pottery and the
art of weaving, and apparently had no domesticated animals or
system of cultivation; but the Neolithic lake-dwellers of Switzerland
had looms, pottery, cereals, sheep, horses,&quot; etc., etc.
<P>
Yet, though &quot;Implements of horn, bone, and wood were in common
use among both races . . . those of the older are frequently distinguished
<I>by their being sculptured with great ability, or ornamented
with life-like engravings of the various animals living at the
period</I>;<I> </I>whereas there appears to have been <I>a marked
absence of any similar artistic ability** </I>on<I> </I>the part
of Neolithic man.&quot; Let us give the reasons for it.
<P>
(1) The oldest fossil man, the primitive cave-men of the old Palaeolithic
period, and of the Pre-glacial period (of whatever length, and
however far back), is always the same genus man, and there are
no fossil remains proving for him &quot;what the Hipparion and
Anchitherium have proved for the genus horse -- that is, gradual
progressive specialization from a simple ancestral type to more
complex existing forms&quot; (&quot;<I>Modern Science,</I>&quot;<I>
</I>p. 181).
<P>
(2) As to the so-called Palaeolithic <I>hatchet</I> . . . &quot;when
placed side by side with the rudest forms of stone hatchets actually
used by the Australian and other savages, it is difficult to detect
any difference&quot; (<I>Ibid,</I> p<I>. </I>112). This goes to
prove that there have been savages <I>at all times</I>;<I> </I>and
the inference would be that there might have been civilized people
in those days as well, cultured nations contemporary with those
rude savages. We see such a thing in Egypt 7,000 years ago.

<P>
* Resembling in a manner the <I>pile-villages </I>of Northern
Borneo.
<P>
** &quot;The <I>most clever sculptor of modern times </I>would
probably not succeed very much better, if his graver were a splinter
of flint and stone and bone were the materials to be engraved&quot;!!
(Prof. Boyd Dawkins' &quot;Cave-Hunting,&quot; p. 344.) It is
needless after such a concession to further insist on Huxley's,
Schmidt's, Laing's, and others' statements to the effect that
Palaeolithic man cannot be considered to lead us back in any way
to a pithecoid human race; thus demolishing the fantasies of many
superficial evolutionists. The relic of artistic merit here <I>re-appearing
</I>in the Chipped-Stone-Age men, is traceable to their <I>Atlantean</I>
ancestry. Neolithic man was a fore-runner of the great <I>Aryan</I>
invasion, and immigrated from quite another quarter -- Asia, and
in a measure Northern Africa. (The tribes peopling the latter
towards the North-West, were certainly of an Atlantean origin
-- dating back hundreds of thousands of years before the Neolithic
Period in Europe, -- but they had so diverged from the parent
type as to present no longer any marked characteristic peculiar
to it.) As to the contrast between Neolithic and Palaeolithic
Man, it is <I>a remarkable fact that, as Carl Vogt remarks, the
former was a cannibal, the much earlier man of the Mammoth era
not. </I>Human manners and customs do not seem to improve with
time, then? Not in this instance at any rate.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 717 ONE SALVATION FOR SCIENCE.</H6>

<P>
(3) An obstacle which is the direct consequence of the two preceding:
Man, if no older than the Palaeolithic period, could not possibly
have had the actual time to get transformed from the &quot;missing
link&quot; into what he is known to have been even during that
remote geological time, <I>i.e.</I>, even <I>a finer specimen
than many of the now existing races.</I> 
<P>
The above lends itself naturally to the following syllogism: (1)
The <I>primitive </I>man (known to Science) was, in some respects,
even a finer man of his genus than he is now. (2) The earliest
monkey known, the <I>lemur,</I> was<I> less </I>anthropoid than
the modern pithecoid species. (3)<I> Conclusion</I>:<I> </I>even
though a <I>missing link </I>were found, the balance of evidence
would remain more in favour of the ape <I>being a degenerated
man </I>made dumb by some fortuitous circumstances,* than tending
to show that man descends from a pithecoid ancestor. The theory
cuts both ways.
<P>
On the other hand, if the existence of Atlantis is accepted, and
the statement is believed that in the Eocene Age &quot;even in
its very first part, the great cycle of the fourth race men, the
Atlanteans had already reached its highest point . . . .&quot;
(Esoteric Buddhism, p. 64) then some of the present difficulties
of science might be easily made to disappear. The rude workmanship
of the Palaeolithic tools proves nothing against the idea that,
side by side with their makers, there lived nations highly civilized.
We are told that &quot;only a very small portion of the earth's
surface has been explored, and of this a very small portion consists
of ancient land surfaces or fresh water formations, where alone
we can expect to meet with traces of the higher forms of animal
life,&quot; . . . and that &quot;even these have been so imperfectly
explored, that where we now meet with thousands and tens of thousands
of undoubted human remains lying almost under our feet, it is
only within the last thirty years that their existence has even
been suspected&quot; (p. 98). It is very suggestive also that
along with the rude <I>haches </I>of the lowest savage, explorers
meet with specimens of workmanship of such artistic merit as could
hardly be found, or expected, in a modern peasant belonging to
any European country -- unless in exceptional cases. The &quot;portrait&quot;
of the &quot;Reindeer feeding,&quot; from the Thayngin grotto
in Switzerland, and those of the man running, with two horse's
heads sketched close to him -- a work of the Reindeer period,
<I>i.e., at least 50,000 years </I>ago -- are pronounced by Mr.
Laing not only exceedingly well done, but, especially the reindeer
feeding, as one that &quot;<I>would do credit to any modern animal</I>
<I>painter</I>&quot;

<P>
* On the data furnished by modern science, physiology, and natural
selection, and without resorting to any miraculous creation, two
negro human specimens of the lowest intelligence -- say idiots
born dumb -- might by breeding produce a dumb <I>Pastrana </I>species,
which would start a new modified race, and thus produce in the
course of geological time the regular anthropoid ape.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 718 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
-- by no means exaggerated praise, as anyone may see (<I>Vide
infra</I>)<I>. </I>Now, since side by side with the modern Esquimaux,
who also have a tendency, like their Palaeolithic ancestors of
the Reindeer period, <I>the rude and savage human species, </I>to
be constantly drawing with the point of their knives sketches
of animals, scenes of the chase, etc., we have our greatest painters
of Europe, why could not the same have happened in those days?
Compared with the specimens of Egyptian drawing and sketching
-- &quot;7,000 years ago&quot; -- the<I> </I>&quot;<I>earliest
</I>portraits&quot; of men, horses' heads, and reindeer, made
50,000 years ago, <I>are certainly superior. </I>Nevertheless,
the Egyptians of those periods are known to have been a highly
civilized nation, whereas the Palaeolithic men are called <I>savages
</I>of the lower type. This is a small matter seemingly, yet extremely
suggestive as showing that every new geological discovery is made
to fit in with current theories, instead of the reverse. Yes;
Mr. Huxley is right in saying, &quot;Time will show.&quot; It
will, and must vindicate Occultism.
<P>
Meanwhile, the most uncompromising materialists are driven by
necessity into the most <I>occult-like </I>admissions. Strange
to say, it is the most materialistic -- those of the German school
-- who, with regard to<I> physical </I>development, come the nearest
to the teachings of the Occultists. Thus, Professor Baumgartner,
who believes that &quot;the germs for the higher animals could
only be the eggs of the lower animals&quot;; who thinks that &quot;besides
the advance of the vegetable and animal world in development,
there occurred in that period the formation of <I>new original
germs,</I>&quot;<I> </I>which formed the basis of new metamorphoses,
etc. -- thinks also that &quot;the first men who proceeded from
the germs of animals beneath them, lived first in a <I>larva </I>state.&quot;
<P>
Just so, in a <I>larva</I> state, we say, too; only from no &quot;animal&quot;
germ, and that &quot;larva&quot; was the soulless astral form
of the pre-physical Races. And we believe, as the German professor
does, with several other men of Science in Europe now, that the
human races &quot;have not descended from one pair, but appeared
immediately in numerous races&quot;; (<I>Anfange zu einer Physiologischen
Schopfungs-geschichte der Pflanzen und Thierwelt, </I>1885). Therefore,
when we read &quot;Force and Matter,&quot; and find that Emperor
of Materialists, Buchner, repeating after Manu and Hermes, that
&quot;the plant passes imperceptibly into the animal, and the
animal into man&quot; (p. 85), we need only add &quot;and man
into a spirit,&quot; to complete the Kabalistic axiom. The more
so, since on page 82 of the same work we read the following admission:
. . . &quot;Produced in the way of spontaneous generation . .
. it is by the aid of intense natural forces and<I> endless periods
of time </I>(that) there has progressively arisen that rich and
infinitely modified organic world by which we are at present surrounded.&quot;
. . . And (page 84) &quot;Spontaneous generation played, no doubt,
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 719 BETWEEN TWO VOIDS.</H6>

<P>
<I>a more important part in the primeval epoch than at present</I>;<I>
nor can it be denied that in this way beings of a higher organization
</I>were produced than now,&quot;* for this is the claim of Occultism.
<P>
The whole difference lies in this: Modern Science places her materialistic
theory of primordial germs on earth, and the <I>last germ of </I>life
on this globe, of man, and everything else, between <I>two voids.
</I>Whence the <I>first </I>germ, if both spontaneous generation
and the interference of external forces, are absolutely rejected
now? Germs of organic life, we are told, by Sir W. Thomson, <I>came
to our earth in some meteor? </I>This helps in no way and only
shifts the difficulty from this earth to the supposed meteor.
<P>
These are our agreements and disagreements with Science. About
the<I> endless periods </I>we are, of course, at one even with
materialistic speculation; for we believe in Evolution, though
on different lines. Professor Huxley very wisely says: &quot;If
<I>any form </I>of progressive development <I>is </I>correct,
we must extend by long epochs the most liberal estimate that has
yet been made of the antiquity of man.&quot; But when we are told
that this man is a product of the natural forces inherent <I>in</I>
matter, <I>force, </I>according to modern views, being but a quality
of matter, a &quot;mode of motion,&quot; etc.; and when we find
Sir W. Thomson repeating in 1885 what was asserted by Buchner
and <I>his </I>school thirty years ago, we fear all our reverence
for real Science is vanishing into thin air! One can hardly help
thinking that materialism is, in certain cases, a <I>disease.
</I>For when men of Science, in the face of the magnetic phenomena
and the attraction of iron particles through insulating substances,
like glass, maintain that the said attraction is due to &quot;molecular
motion,&quot; or to the &quot;rotation of the molecules of the
magnet,&quot; then, whether the teaching comes from a &quot;credulous&quot;
Theosophist innocent of any notion of physics, or from an eminent
man of Science, it is equally ridiculous. The individual who asserts
such a theory in the teeth of <I>fact, </I>is only one more proof
that &quot;When people have not a niche in their minds in which
to shoot facts, so much the worse for the facts.&quot;
<P>
As present the dispute between the spontaneous generationists
and their opponents is at rest, having ended in the provisional
victory of the latter. But even they are forced to admit, as Buchner
did, and Messrs. Tyndall and Huxley still do -- that spontaneous
generation <I>must have occurred once, </I>under &quot;special
thermal conditions.&quot; Virchow refuses even to argue the question;
it <I>must </I>have taken place sometime in the history of our
planet: and there's an end of it. This seems to look more natural
than Sir W. Thomson's hypothesis just quoted, that the germs of
organic life fell on our earth in some meteor; or that other

<P>
<I>scientific </I>hypothesis coupled to the recently adopted belief
that there exists <I>no </I>&quot;Vital principle&quot; whatever,
but only vital phenomena, which can all be traced to the molecular
forces of the original protoplasm. But this does not help Science
to solve the still greater problem -- the origin and <I>the descent
</I>of Man, for here is a still worse plaint and lamentation.
<P>
&quot;While we can trace the skeletons of Eocene mammals through
several directions of specialization in succeeding Tertiary times,
man presents the phenomenon of an <I>unspecialized </I>skeleton
which cannot fairly be connected with any of these lines.&quot;

<P>
The secret could be soon told, not only from the esoteric but
even from the standpoint of every religion the world over, without
mentioning the Occultists. The &quot;specialized skeleton&quot;
is sought for in the wrong place, where it can never be found.
It is expected to be discovered in the physical remains of man,
in some pithecoid &quot;missing link,&quot; with a skull larger
than that of the ape's, and with a cranial capacity smaller than
in man, <I>instead </I>of looking for that <I>specialization </I>in<I>
the super-physical essence of his inner astral constitution, which
can hardly be excavated from any geological strata! </I>Such a
tenacious, hopeful clinging to a self-degrading theory is the
most wonderful feature of the day.

<P>
Meanwhile, this is a specimen of an engraving made by a <I>Palaeolithic
</I>&quot;savage&quot;: Palaeolithic meaning the &quot;earlier
Stone-age&quot; man, one supposed to have been as savage and brutal
as the brutes he lived with.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 721 THE PALAEOLITHIC LANDSEER.</H6>

<P>
Leaving the modern South Sea Islander, or even any Asiatic race,
aside, we defy any grown-up schoolboy, or even a European youth,
one who has never studied drawing, to execute such an engraving
or even a pencil sketch. Here we have the true artistic <I>raccourci,
</I>and correct lights and shadows without any <I>plane </I>model
before the artist, who copied direct from nature, thus exhibiting
a knowledge of anatomy and proportion. The artist who engraved
this reindeer belonged, we are asked to believe, to the primitive
&quot;semi-animal&quot; savages (contemporaneous with the mammoth
and the woolly rhinoceros), whom some over-zealous Evolutionists
once sought to picture to us as distinct approximations to the
type of their hypothetical &quot;pithecoid man&quot;!
<P>
This engraved antler proves as eloquently as any fact can that
the evolution of the races has ever proceeded in a series of rises
and falls, that man, perhaps, is as old as incrustated Earth,
and -- if we can call his Divine ancestor &quot;Man&quot; -- far
older still.
<P>
Even de Mortillet himself seems to experience a vague distrust
of the conclusions of modern archaeologists, when he writes: --
&quot;The prehistoric is a new science, <I>far, very far, </I>from
having said its last word.&quot; (&quot;<I>Prehist. Antiq. of
Man,</I>&quot;<I> </I>1883.) According to Lyell, one of the highest
authorities on the subject, and the &quot;Father&quot; of Geology:
-- &quot;The expectation of always meeting with a lower type of
human skull, the older the formation in which it occurs, <I>is
based on the theory of progressive development,</I> and it <I>may</I>
prove to be sound; nevertheless we must remember that as yet <I>we
have no distinct geological evidence that the appearance of what
are called the inferior races of mankind has always preceded in
chronological order that of the higher races.</I>&quot;<I> </I>(&quot;<I>Antiq.
of Man,</I>&quot;<I> </I>p<I>. </I>25.) Nor has such evidence
been found to this day. Science is thus offering for sale the
skin of a bear, which has hitherto never been seen by mortal eye!
<P>
This concession of Lyell's reads most suggestively with the subjoined
utterance of Professor Max Muller, whose attack on the Darwinian
Anthropology from the standpoint of LANGUAGE has, by the way,
never been satisfactorily answered: --
<P>
&quot;What do we know of savage tribes beyond the <I>last chapter
of their history?</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Cf. this with the esoteric
view of the Australians, Bushmen, as well as of Palaeolithic European
man, the Atlantean offshoots retaining a relic of a lost culture,
which throve when the parent Root-Race was in its prime.) &quot;Do
we ever get an insight into their antecedents. . . . <I>How have
they come to be what they are? </I>. . . . Their language proves,
indeed, that these so-called heathens, with their complicated
systems of mythology, their artificial customs, their unintelligible
whims and savageries, are not the creatures of to-day or yesterday.
Unless we admit a special creation for these savages, they must
be as old as the Hindus, the Greeks and Romans (far older). .
. .<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 722 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
They may have passed through ever so many vicissitudes, and <I>what
we consider as primitive, may be, for all we know, a </I>RELAPSE
INTO SAVAGERY or a corruption of something that was more rational
and intelligible in former stages.&quot; (&quot;India,&quot; 1883,
F. Max Muller.)
<P>
&quot;The primeval savage is a familiar term in modern literature,&quot;
remarks Professor Rawlinson, &quot;but there is no evidence that
the primeval savage ever existed. Rather <I>all the evidence looks
the other way.</I>&quot;<I> </I>(&quot;<I>Antiq. of Man Historically
Considered.</I>&quot;)<I> </I>In his &quot;Origin of Nations,&quot;
pp. 10-11, he rightly adds: &quot;<I>The mythical traditions of
almost all nations place at the beginning of human history a time
of happiness and perfection, </I>a 'golden age' which has no features
of savagery or barbarism, but many of civilization and refinement.&quot;
How is the modern evolutionist to meet this consensus of evidence?
<P>
We repeat the question asked in &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;: &quot;Does
the finding of the remains in the cave of Devon prove that there
were no contemporary races then who were highly civilized? When
the present population of the earth have disappeared, and some
archaeologist belonging to the 'coming race' of the distant future
shall excavate the domestic implements of one of our Indian or
Andaman Island tribes, will he be justified in concluding that
mankind in the nineteenth century was 'just emerging from the
Stone Age'?&quot;
<P>
Another strange inconsistency in scientific knowledge is that
<I>Neolithic </I>man is shown as being far more of a primitive
savage than the Palaeolithic one. Either Lubbock's &quot;Pre-historic
Man,&quot; or Evans' &quot;Ancient Stone Implements&quot; must
be at fault, or -- both. For this is what we learn from these
works and others: --
<P>
(1) As we pass from Neolithic to Palaeolithic Man, the stone implements
become, from gracefully shaped and polished instruments, rude
lumbering makeshifts. Pottery, etc., disappear as we descend the
scale. And yet the latter could engrave such a reindeer!
<P>
(2) Palaeolithic Man lived in caves which he shared with hyaenas
and lions also,* whereas Neolithic man dwelt in lake-villages
and buildings.
<P>
Every one who has followed even superficially the geological discoveries
of our day, knows that a gradual improvement in workmanship is
found, from the clumsy chipping and rude chopping of the early
Palaeolithic <I>haches, </I>to the relatively graceful stone celts
of that part of the Neolithic period immediately preceding the
use of metals. But this <I>is in Europe, </I>a few portions only
of which were barely rising from the waters in the days
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* In such a case Palaeolithic man must have been endowed in his
day with thrice Herculean force and magic invulnerability, or
else the lion was as weak as a lamb at that period, for both to
share the same dwelling. We may as well be asked to believe next
that it is that lion or hyaena which has engraved the deer on
the antler, as be told that this bit of workmanship was done by
a savage of such a kind.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 723 ENTRAPPED BY THE REINDEER.</H6>

<P>
of the highest Atlantean civilizations. There were rude savages
and highly civilized people then, as there are now. If 50,000
years hence, pigmy Bushmen are exhumed from some African cavern
together with far earlier pigmy elephants, such as were found
in the cave deposits of Malta by Milne Edwards, will that be a
reason to maintain that in our age all men and all elephants were
pigmies? Or if the weapons of the Veddhas of Ceylon are found,
will our descendants be justified in setting us all down as Palaeolithic
savages? All the articles which geologists now excavate in Europe
can certainly never date earlier than from the close of the Eocene
age, since the lands of Europe were not even above water before
that period. Nor can what we have said be in the least invalidated
by theorists telling us that these quaint sketches of animals
and men by Palaeolithic man, were executed only <I>toward the
close of the Reindeer period -- </I>for this explanation would
be a very lame one indeed, in view of the geologists' ignorance
of even the approximate duration of periods.
<P>
The Esoteric Doctrine teaches distinctly the <I>dogma </I>of the
risings and falls of civilization; and now we learn that: &quot;It
is a remarkable fact that cannibalism seems to have become more
frequent as man advanced in civilization, and that while its traces
are frequent in <I>Neolithic </I>times they . . . . altogether
disappear in the age of the mammoth and the reindeer.&quot; (&quot;<I>Mod.
Science and Mod. Thought,</I>&quot;<I> </I>p. 164.)
<P>
Another evidence of the cyclic law and the truth of our teachings.
Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out
with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races
of the latter (Chinamen, African negroes, &amp;c.) gradually brought
the worship back. The Vedas countenance no idols; all the modern
Hindu writings do.
<P>
&quot;In the early Egyptian tombs, and in the remains of the pre-historic
cities excavated by Dr. Schliemann, images of owl and ox-headed
goddesses, and other symbolical figures, or idols, are found in
abundance. But when we ascend into Neolithic times, such idols
are no longer found . . . . the only ones which may be said with
some certainty to have been idols are one or two discovered by
M. de Braye in some artificial caves of the Neolithic period .
. . which appear to be intended for female figures of life size&quot;
. . . . (p. 199 <I>Ibid.</I>)
<P>
And these may have been simply statues. Anyhow, all this is one
among the many proofs of the cyclic rise and fall of civilization
and religion. The fact that no traces of human relics or skeletons
are so far found beyond post-tertiary or &quot;Quaternary&quot;
times -- though Abbe Bourgeois' flints may serve as a warning*
-- seems to point to the truth of another esoteric statement,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* More than twenty specimens of fossil monkeys have been found
in one locality alone, in Miocene strata (Pikermi, near Athens).
If man was not then, the period is [[Footnote continued on next
page]]<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 724 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
which runs thus: &quot;Seek for the remains of thy forefathers
in the high places. The vales have grown into mountains and the
mountains have crumbled to the bottom of the seas.&quot; . . .
Fourth Race mankind, thinned after the last cataclysm by two-thirds
of its population, instead of settling on the new continents and
islands that <I>reappeared </I>while their predecessors formed
the floors of new Oceans -- deserted that which is now Europe
and parts of Asia and Africa for the summits of gigantic mountains,
the seas that surrounded some of the latter having since &quot;retreated&quot;
and made room for the table lands of Central Asia.
<P>
The most interesting example of this progressive march is perhaps
afforded by the celebrated Kent's Cavern at Torquay. In that strange
recess, excavated by water out of the Devonian limestone, we find
a most curious record preserved for us in the geological memoirs
of the earth. Under the blocks of limestone, which heaped the
floor of the cavern, were discovered, embedded in a deposit of
black earth, many implements of the Neolithic period of <I>fairly
excellent workmanship, </I>with<I> </I>a few fragments of pottery
-- possibly traceable to the era of the Roman colonization. There
is no trace of Palaeolithic man here. No flints or traces of the
extinct animals of the Quaternary period. When, however, we penetrate
still deeper through the dense layer of stalagmite beneath the
mould into the red earth, which, of course, itself once formed
the pavement of the retreat, things assume a very different aspect.
<I>Not one implement fit to bear </I>comparison <I>with the finely-chipped
weapons found in the overlying stratum is to be seen</I>;<I> </I>only
a host of the rude and lumbering little hatchets (with which the
monstrous giants of the animal world were subdued and killed by
little man, we have to think?) and scrapers of the Palaeolithic
age, mixed up confusedly with the bones of species now either
extinct or emigrated, driven away by change of climate. It is
the artificer of these ugly little hatchets, you see, who sculptured
the reindeer over the brook, on the antler as shown above. In
all cases we meet with the same evidence that, from historic to
Neolithic and from Neolithic to Palaeolithic man, things slope
downwards on an inclined plane from the rudiments of civilization
to the most abject barbarism -- <I>in Europe</I> <I>again. </I>We
are made also to face the &quot;mammoth age&quot; -- the extreme
or earliest division of the Palaeolithic age -- in which the great
rudeness of implements reaches its maximum, and the <I>brutal
</I>(?) appearance of contemporary skulls, such as the Neanderthal,
point to a very low type of Humanity. But they may sometimes point
also to something besides; to a race of men quite distinct from
our (Fifth Race) Humanity.

he was, and if no monkey is found earlier, what follows?<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 725 STRANGE CONFESSIONS OF SCIENCE.</H6>

<P>
As said by an anthropologist in &quot;<I>Modern Thought</I>&quot;<I>
</I>(art. &quot;The <I>Genesis of Man</I>&quot;):<I> </I>&quot;The
theory, scientifically based or not, of Peyrere may be considered
to be equivalent to that which divided man in two species. Broca,
Virey, and a number of the French anthropologists have recognised
that the lower race of man, comprising the Australian, Tasmanian,
and Negro race, excluding the Kaffirs and the Northern Africans,
<I>should be placed apart. </I>The fact that in this species,
or rather sub-species, the third lower molars are usually larger
than the second, and the squamosal and frontal bones are generally
united by suture, places the<I> Homo Afer </I>on the level of
being as good a distinct species as many of the kinds of finches.
I shall abstain on the present occasion from mentioning the facts
of hybridity, whereon the late Professor Broca has so exhaustively
commented. The history, in the past ages of the world, of this
race is peculiar. It has <I>never originated a system of architecture
or a religion of its own</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Dr. C. Carter Blake).
It is peculiar, indeed, as we have shown in the case of the Tasmanians.
However it may be, <I>fossil </I>man in Europe can neither prove
nor disprove the antiquity of man on this Earth nor the age of
his earliest civilizations.
<P>
It is time the Occultists should disregard any attempts to laugh
at them, scorning the heavy guns of the satire of the men of science
as much as the pop-guns of the profane, since it is impossible,
so far, to obtain either proof or disproof, while their theories
can stand the test better than the hypotheses of the Scientists
at any rate. As to the proof for the antiquity which they claim
for man, they have, moreover, Darwin himself and Lyell. The latter
confesses that they (the naturalists) &quot;have already obtained
evidence of the existence of man at so remote a period that there
has been time for many conspicuous mammalia, once his contemporaries,
to die out, and <I>this even before the era of the earliest </I>historical
records.&quot;* This is a statement made by one of England's great
authorities upon the question. The two sentences that follow are
as suggestive, and may well be remembered by the students of Occultism,
for with all others he says: &quot;In spite of the long lapse
of prehistoric ages during which he (Man) must have flourished
on Earth, <I>there is no proof of any perceptible change in his
bodily structure. </I>If, therefore, he ever diverged from some
unreasoning brute ancestor, we must suppose him to have existed
at a far more distant epoch, <I>possibly on some continents or
islands now submerged </I>beneath the Ocean.&quot;
<P>
Thus lost continents are officially suspected. That worlds (also
Races) are periodically destroyed by fire (volcanoes and earthquakes)
and water, in turn, and renewed, is a doctrine as old as man.
Manu, Hermes, the Chaldees, all antiquity believed in this. Twice
already

<P>
has the face of the globe been changed by fire, and twice by water,
since man appeared on it. As land needs rest and renovation, new
forces, and a change for its soil, so does water. Thence arises
a periodical redistribution of land and water, change of climates,
etc., all brought on by geological revolution, and ending in a
final change in the axis. Astronomers may pooh-pooh the idea of
a periodical change in the behaviour of the globe's axis, and
smile at the conversation given in the Book of Enoch between Noah
and his &quot;grandfather&quot; Enoch; the allegory is, nevertheless,
a geological and an astronomical fact: there is a secular change
in the inclination of the earth's axis, and its appointed time
is recorded in one of the great Secret Cycles. As in many other
questions, Science is gradually moving toward our way of thinking.
Dr. Henry Woodward, F.R.S., F.G.S., writes in the <I>Popular Science
Review </I>(New Series in Vol. I. p. 115), Art.: &quot;Evidences
of the Age of Ice.&quot; . . . . &quot;If it be necessary to call
in extramundane causes to explain the great increase of ice at
this glacial period, I would prefer the theory propounded by Dr.
Robert Hooke in 1688; since, by Sir Richard Phillips and others;
and lastly by Mr. Thomas Belt, <STRONG>C.E</STRONG>., <STRONG>F.G.S</STRONG>.;
namely, a slight increase in the present obliquity of the ecliptic,
a proposal in perfect accord with other known astronomical facts,
and the introduction of which is essential to our cosmical condition
as a unit in the great solar system.&quot;
<P>
The following, quoted from a Lecture by W. Pengelly, <STRONG>F.R.S.</STRONG>,
<STRONG>F.G.S</STRONG>., delivered in March, 1885, on &quot;The
extinct Lake of Bovey Tracey&quot; shows the hesitation, in the
face of every evidence in favour of Atlantis, to accept the fact.
It is a quotation in the body of the Lecture: --
<P>
&quot;Evergreen Figs, Laurels, Palms, and Ferns having gigantic
rhizomes have their existing congeners <I>in a sub-tropical climate,
such, it cannot be doubted, as prevailed in Devonshire in Miocene
times, </I>and are thus calculated to suggest caution when the
<I>present climate </I>of any district is regarded as normal.
<P>
&quot;When, moreover, Miocene plants are found in Disco Island,
on the west coast of Greenland, lying between 69[[degrees]] 20'
and 70[[degrees]] 30' N. lat.; when we learn that among them were
two species found also at Bovey (<I>Sequoia couttsiae, Quercus
Lyelli</I>);<I> </I>when, to quote Professor Heer, we find that
&quot;the 'splendid evergreen' (<I>Magnolia Inglefieldi</I>)<I>
</I>'ripened its fruits so far north as on the parallel of 70
[[degrees]] ' &quot;<I> </I>(<I>Phil. Trans. </I>clix., 457, 1869);
when also the number, variety, and luxuriance of the Greenland
Miocene plants are found to have been such that, had land continued
so far, some of them would in all probability have flourished
at the Pole itself, the problem of changes of climate is brought
prominently into view, but only to be dismissed apparently with
the feeling that the <I>time for its solution has not yet arrived.</I>

<P>
&quot;It seems to be admitted on all hands that the Miocene plants
of Europe have their nearest and most numerous existing analogues
in North America, and hence arises the question; How was the migration
from one area to the other effected? Was there, as some have believed,
an Atlantis? -- a continent, or an archipelago of large islands,
occupying the area of the North Atlantic. There is perhaps nothing
unphilosophical in this hypothesis; for since, as geologists state,
'the Alps have acquired 4,000, and even in some places more than
10,000 feet of their present altitude since the commencement of
the Eocene period' (Lyell's<I> Principles, </I>11th ed., p. 256,
1872), a Post-Miocene (?) depression might have carried the hypothetical
Atlantis into almost abysmal depths. But an Atlantis is apparently
unnecessary and uncalled for. According to Professor Oliver, 'A
close and very peculiar analogy subsists between the Flora of
Tertiary Central Europe and the recent Floras of the American
States and of the Japanese region; an analogy much closer and
more intimate than is to be traced between the Tertiary and Recent
Floras of Europe. We find the Tertiary element of the Old World
to be intensified towards its extreme eastern margin. . . . This
accession of the Tertiary element is rather gradual and not abruptly
assumed in the Japan islands only. Although it there attains a
maximum, we may trace it from the Mediterranean, Levant, Caucasus,
and Persia . . . then along the Himalaya and through China. .
. . We learn also that during the Tertiary epoch, counterparts
of Central European Miocene genera certainly grew in North-West
America. . . . We note further that the present Atlantic Islands'
Flora affords no substantial evidence of a former direct communication
with the mainland of the New World. . . . The consideration of
these facts leads me to the opinion that botanical evidence does
not favour the hypothesis of an Atlantis. On the other hand, it
strongly favours the view that at some period of the Tertiary
epoch North-Eastern Asia was united to North-western America,
perhaps by the line where the Aleutian chain of islands now extends.'
&quot; (<I>Nat. Hist. Rev. </I>ii. 164, 1862.) See, however, &quot;Scientific
and Geological Proofs of the Reality of Several Submerged Continents.&quot;
<P>
But nothing short of a pithecoid man, will ever satisfy the luckless
searchers after the thrice hypothetical &quot;missing link.&quot;
Yet, if beneath the vast floors of the Atlantic, from the Teneriffe
Pic to Gibraltar, the ancient emplacement of the lost Atlantis,
all the submarine strata were to be broken up miles deep, no such
skull as would satisfy the Darwinists would be found. As Dr. C.
R. Bree remarks (&quot;<I>Fallacies of Darwinism</I>&quot;)<I>,
</I>no missing links between man and ape having been discovered
in various gravels and formations above the tertiaries, if they
had gone down with the continents now covered with the sea, they

<P>
might still be found &quot;in those beds of contemporary geological
strata which have <I>not</I> gone down to the bottom of the sea.&quot;
Yet they are as fatally absent from the latter as from the former.
Were not preconceptions to fasten vampire-like on man's mind,
the author of &quot;<I>Antiquity of Man</I>&quot;<I> </I>would
have found a clue to the difficulty in that same work of his,
by going ten pages back (530) and reading over a quotation of
his own from Professor G. Rolleston's work. This physiologist,
he says, suggests that as there is considerable plasticity in
the human frame, not only in youth and during growth, but even
in the adult, we ought not always to take for granted, as some
advocates of the development theory seem to do, that each advance
in physical power depends on an improvement in bodily structure,
for why may not <I>the soul, or the higher intellectual and moral
faculties play the first instead of the second part in a progressive
scheme.</I> 
<P>
This hypothesis is made in relation to Evolution <I>not being
entirely due to </I>&quot;<I>natural selection</I>&quot;;<I> </I>but
it applies as well to our case in hand. For we, too, claim that
it is the &quot;Soul,&quot; or the <I>inner</I> man, that descends
on Earth first, the psychic <I>astral, </I>the mould on which
physical man is gradually built -- his Spirit, intellectual and
moral faculties awakening later on as that physical stature grows
and develops.
<P>
&quot;Thus incorporeal Spirits to smaller forms reduced their
shapes immense,&quot; . . . and became the men of the Third and
the Fourth Races. Still later, ages after, appeared the men of
our Fifth Race, reduced from the still gigantic (in our modern
sense) stature of their primeval ancestors, to about half of that
size at present.
<P>
Man is certainly <I>no</I> special creation, and he is the product
of Nature's gradual perfective work, like any other living unit
on this Earth. But this is only with regard to the human tabernacle.
That which lives and thinks in man and survives that frame, the
masterpiece of evolution -- is the &quot;Eternal Pilgrim,&quot;
the Protean differentiation in space and time of the One Absolute
&quot;unknowable.&quot;
<P>
In his &quot;Antiquity of Man,&quot; Sir C. Lyell quotes -- perhaps
in rather a mocking spirit -- what Hallam says (in Vol. iv., p.
162) in his &quot;<I>Introduction to the Literature of Europe</I>&quot;:<I>
</I>--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;If man was made in the image of God, he was also made in
the image of an ape. The framework of the body of him who has
weighed the stars and made the lightning his slave, approaches
to that of a speechless brute who wanders in the forest of Sumatra.
Thus standing on the frontier land between animal and angelic
natures, what wonder that he should partake of both?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
An Occultist would have put it otherwise. He would say that man
was indeed made in the image of a type projected by his progenitor,
the creating <I>Angel-Force, </I>or Dhyan Chohan; while the wanderer
of the forest of Sumatra was made <I>in the image of man, </I>since
the frame-<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 729 PALAEOLITHIC MAN, A CALIGRAPH!</H6>

<P>
work of the ape, we say again, is the revival, the resuscitation
by abnormal means of the actual form of the Third-Round, and of
the Fourth-Round <I>Man</I> as well, later on. Nothing is lost
in nature, <I>not an atom</I>:<I> </I>this latter is at least
certain on scientific data. Analogy would appear to demand that
<I>form </I>should be equally endowed with permanency.
<P>
And yet what do we find: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;It is significant,&quot; says Sir W. Dawson, <STRONG>F.R.S.</STRONG>,
&quot;that Professor Huxley in his lectures in New York, while
resting his case as to the lower animals, mainly on the supposed
genealogy of the horse, which has often been shown to amount to
no certain evidence, <I>avoided altogether the discussion of the
origin of men from the apes, </I>now obviously complicated with
so many difficulties that both Wallace and Mivart are staggered
by them. Professor Thomas in his recent lectures ('Nature,' 1876),
admits that there is no lower man known than the Australian, and
that there is no known link of connection with the monkeys; and
that Haeckel has to admit that the penultimate link in his phylogeny,
the ape-like man, <I>is absolutely unknown </I>('<I>History of
Creation.</I>') .<I> </I>. . . The so-called '<I>tallies</I>'<I>
</I>found with the bones of Palaeocosmic men in European caves,
and illustrated in the admirable works of Christy and Lartet,
show that the <I>rudiments even of writings were already in possession
</I>of the oldest race of men known to archaeology or geology.&quot;
(See Wilson's &quot;<I>Prehistoric Man,</I>&quot;<I> op. cit.,
</I>vol. ii., p. 54. &quot;<I>Origin of the World,</I>&quot;<I>
</I>p. 393.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Again in Dr. C. R. Bree's &quot;<I>Fallacies of Darwinism,</I>&quot;<I>
</I>on page 160, we read: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Mr. Darwin justly says that the difference physically and,
more especially mentally, between the lowest form of man and the
highest anthropomorphous ape, is enormous. Therefore, <I>the time
-- </I>which in Darwinian evolution must be almost inconceivably
slow -- must have been <I>enormous </I>also during man's development
from the monkey.* The chance, therefore, of some of these variations
being found in the different gravels or fresh-water formations
above the tertiaries, must be very great. And yet <I>not one single
variation, not one single specimen of a </I>being between a monkey
and a man has ever been found. Neither in the gravel, nor the
drift-clay, nor the fresh-water beds, nor in the tertiaries below
them has there ever been discovered the remains of any member
of the missing families between the monkey and the man, as <I>assumed
</I>to have existed by Mr. Darwin. Have they gone down with the
depression of the earth's surface and are they now covered with
the sea? If so, it is beyond all probability that they should
not, also be found in those beds of contemporary geological strata
which have <I>not</I> gone down to the bottom of the sea; still
more improbable that some portions should not be dredged from
the ocean bed like the remains of the mammoth and the rhinoceros
which are also found in fresh-water beds and gravels and drift!
. . . . . . the celebrated Neanderthal skull, about which so much
has been said, belongs confessedly to this remote epoch (bronze
and stone ages), and yet presents, although it may have been the
skull of an idiot, immense differences from the highest known
anthropomorphous ape.&quot;

<P>
Our globe being convulsed each time that it <I>reawakens </I>for
a new period of activity, like a field which has to be ploughed
and furrowed before fresh seed for its new crop is thrown into
it -- it does seem quite hopeless that fossils belonging to its
previous Rounds should be found in the beds of either its oldest
or its latest geological strata. Every new Manvantara brings along
with it the renovation of forms, types and species; every type
of the preceding organic forms -- vegetable, animal and human
-- changes and is perfected in the next, even to the mineral,
which has received in this Round its final opacity and hardness;
its softer portions having formed the present vegetation; the
astral relics of previous vegetation and fauna having been utilized
in the formation of the lower animals, and determining the structure
of the primeval Root-Types of the highest mammalia. And, finally,
the form of the gigantic Ape-Man of the former Round has been
reproduced in this one by human bestiality and transfigured into
the <I>parent </I>form in the modern Anthropoid.
<P>
This doctrine, even imperfectly delineated as it is under our
inefficient pen, is assuredly more logical, more consistent with
facts, and <I>far more </I>probable than many &quot;scientific&quot;
theories; that, for instance, of the first organic germ descending
on a meteor to our Earth -- like Ain Soph on his Vehicle, Adam
Kadmon. Only, the latter descent is allegorical, as every one
knows, and the Kabalists have never offered this figure of speech
for acceptance in its dead-letter garb. But the germ on the meteor
theory, as coming from such high scientific quarters, is an eligible
candidate for axiomatic truth and law, a theory people are in
honour bound to accept, if they would be on a right level with
modern Science. What the next theory necessitated by the materialistic
premises will be -- no one can tell. Meanwhile, the <I>present
</I>theories, as any one can see, clash together far more discordantly
among themselves than even those of the Occultists outside the
<I>sacred </I>precincts of learning. For what is there, next in
order, now that exact Science has made even of the Life-principle
an empty word, a meaningless term; and now insists that life is
an effect <I>due to the molecular action of the primordial protoplasm!
</I>The new doctrine of the Darwinists may be defined and summarized
in a few words, in which Mr. Herbert Spencer has defined &quot;special
creation&quot; . . . &quot;it is worthless. Worthless, by its
derivation; worthless, in its intrinsic incoherence; worthless,
as absolutely without evidence; worthless, as not supplying an
intellectual need; worthless, as not satisfying a moral want.
We must, therefore, <I>consider it as counting for nothing in
opposition to any other hypothesis respecting the origin of organic
beings.</I>&quot;<I> </I>(<I>Principles of Biology, Vol. I.,</I>
