<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG> <STRONG>P</STRONG>ANORAMIC <STRONG>V</STRONG>IEW
OF THE <STRONG>E</STRONG>ARLY <STRONG>R</STRONG>ACES.
<P>
There is a period of a few millions of years to cover between
the first &quot;mindless&quot; race and the highly intelligent
and <EM>intellectual </EM>later &quot;Lemurians&quot;; there is
another between the earliest civilization of the Atlanteans and
the historic period.
<P>
As witnesses to the Lemurians but a few silent records in the
shape of half a dozen broken colossi and old cyclopean ruins are
left. These are not allowed a hearing, as they are &quot;productions
of blind natural forces,&quot; we are assured by some; &quot;quite
modern&quot; we are told by others. Tradition is left contemptuously
unnoticed by sceptic and materialist, and made subservient to
the Bible in every case by the too zealous Churchman. Whenever
a legend, however, refuses to fit in with the Noachian &quot;deluge
theory,&quot; it is declared by the Christian clergy &quot;the
insanely delirious voice of old superstition.&quot; Atlantis is
denied, when not confused with Lemuria and other departed continents,
because, perhaps, Lemuria is half the creation of modern science,
and has, therefore, to be believed in; while Plato's Atlantis
is regarded by most of the scientists as a dream.
<P>
Atlantis is often described by believers in Plato as a prolongation
of Africa. An old continent is also suspected to have existed
on the Eastern coast. Only Africa, as a continent, was never part
and parcel of either Lemuria or Atlantis, as we have agreed to
call the Third and Fourth Continents. Their archaic appellations
are never mentioned in the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 264 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Puranas, nor anywhere else. But with simply one of the esoteric
keys in hand it becomes an easy task to identify these departed
lands in the numberless &quot;lands of the gods,&quot; Devas and
Munis described in the Puranas, in their <EM>Varshas, Dwipas,</EM>
and<EM> zones. </EM>Their Sweta-Dwipa, during the early day of
Lemuria, stood out like a giant-peak from the bottom of the sea;
the area between Atlas and Madagascar being occupied by the waters
till about the early period of Atlantis (after the disappearance
of Lemuria), when Africa emerged from the bottom of the ocean,
and Atlas was half-sunk.
<P>
It is of course impossible to attempt, within the compass of even
several volumes, a consecutive and detailed account of the evolution
and progress of the first three races -- except so far as to give
a general view of it, as will be done presently. Race the first
had no history of its own. Of race the second the same may be
said. We shall have, therefore, to pay careful attention only
to the Lemurians and the Atlanteans before the history of our
own race (the Fifth) can be attempted.
<P>
What is known of other continents, besides our own, and what does
history know or accept of the early races? Everything outside
the repulsive speculations of materialistic science is daubed
with the contemptuous term &quot;Superstition.&quot; The wise
men of to-day will believe nothing. Plato's &quot;winged&quot;
and <EM>hermaphrodite </EM>races, and his golden age, under the
reign of Saturn and the gods, are quietly brought back by Haeckel
to their <EM>new</EM> place in nature: our divine races are shown
to be the descendants of Catarrhine apes, and our ancestor, a
piece of sea slime.
<P>
Nevertheless, as expressed by Faber, &quot;the <EM>fictions </EM>of
ancient poetry . . . . will be found to comprehend some portion
of historical truth.&quot; However one-sided the efforts of the
learned author of the &quot;<EM>Mysteries of the Kabiri,</EM>&quot;<EM>
--</EM> efforts directed throughout his two volumes to constrain
the classical myths and symbols of old paganism, &quot;to bear
testimony to the truth of Scripture,&quot; -- time and further
research have avenged, partially at least, that &quot;truth&quot;
by showing it <EM>unveiled. </EM>Thus it is the clever adaptations
of Scripture, on the contrary, which are made to bear evidence
to the great wisdom of archaic paganism. This, notwithstanding
the inextricable confusion into which the truth about the Kabiri
-- the most mysterious gods of antiquity -- was thrown by the
wild and contradictory speculations of Bishop Cumberland, Dr.
Shuckford, Cudworth, Vallancey, etc., etc., and finally by Faber.
Nevertheless, all, from first to last, of these scholars had to
come to a certain conclusion framed by the latter. &quot;We have
no reason to think,&quot; he writes, &quot;that the idolatry of
the Gentile world was of a merely arbitrary contrivance; on the
contrary, it seems to have been built, almost universally, <EM>upon
a traditional remembrance of certain real events. These events
I apprehend to be the destruction of</EM> <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 265 BAILLY AND FABER.</H6>

<P>
<EM>the first </EM>(the fourth in esoteric teachings) <EM>Race
of mankind by the waters of the Deluge.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Chap.
I. p. </EM>9). To this, Faber adds: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;I am persuaded that the tradition of the sinking of the
Phlegian isle is the very same as that of the sinking of the island
Atlantis. They both appear to me to allude to one great event,
the sinking of the whole world beneath the waters of the deluge,
or, if we suppose the arch of the earth to have remained in its
original position, the rising of the central water above it. M.
Bailly, indeed, in his work upon the Atlantis of Plato, the object
of which is evidently to depreciate the authority of Scriptural
chronology, labours to prove that the Atlanteans were a very ancient
northern nation, long prior to the Hindoos, the Phoenicians, and
the Egyptians.&quot; (<I>&quot;A Dissertation on the Kabiri,&quot;
p. </I>284.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In this Faber is in agreement with Bailly, who shows himself more
learned and intuitional than those who accept Biblical chronology.
Nor is the latter wrong when saying that the Atlanteans were the
same as the Titans and the giants.<EM> </EM>(<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Lettres
sur l</EM>'<EM>Atlantide.</EM>&quot;) Faber adopts the more willingly
the opinion of his French <EM>confrere, </EM>as Bailly mentions
Cosmas Indico-Pleustes, who preserved an ancient tradition about
Noah -- that he &quot;formerly inhabited the <EM>island </EM>Atlantis&quot;
(<EM>ibid</EM>). This island, whether it was the &quot;Poseidonis&quot;
mentioned in &quot;Esoteric Buddhism,&quot; or the Continent of
Atlantis, does not much matter. The tradition is there, recorded
by a Christian.
<P>
No Occultist would ever think of dispossessing Noah of his prerogatives,
if he is claimed to be an Atlantean; for this would simply show
that the Israelites repeated the story of Vaivasvata Manu, Xisuthrus,
and so many others, and that they only changed the name, to do
which they had the same right as any other nation or tribe. What
we object to is the literal acceptation of Biblical chronology,
as it is absurd, and in accord with neither geological data nor
reason. Moreover, if Noah was an Atlantean, then he was a Titan,
a giant, as Faber shows; and if a giant, then why is he not shown
as such in <EM>Genesis?* </EM>
<P>
Bailly's mistake was to reject the submersion of Atlantis, and
to call the Atlanteans simply a Northern and <EM>post diluvian
</EM>nation, which, however, as he says, certainly &quot;flourished
before the foundation of the Hindu, the Egyptian, and the Phoenician
empires.&quot; In this, had
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* This is shown by Faber, again a pious Christian, who says that
&quot;the Noetic family also . . . bore the appellations of <EM>Atlanteans
</EM>and <EM>Titans, </EM>and the great patriarch himself was
called by way of eminence <EM>Atlas </EM>and <EM>Titan.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Vol. II. p. </EM>285). And if so, then, <EM>according
to the Bible, </EM>Noah must have been the progeny of the Sons
of God, the <EM>fallen</EM> <EM>angels, </EM>agreeably to the
same authority, and of the &quot;daughters of men who were fair,&quot;
(<EM>See Genesis, chap. </EM>vi.) And why not, since his father
Lamech slew a man, and was, with all his sons and daughters (who
perished in the Deluge), as bad as the rest of mankind?<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 266 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
he only known of the existence of what we have agreed to call
<EM>Lemuria, </EM>he would have again been right. For the Atlanteans
were <EM>post diluvian </EM>to the Lemurians, and Lemuria was
not submerged as Atlantis was, but was <EM>sunk </EM>under the
waves, owing to earthquakes and subterranean fires, as Great Britain
and Europe will be one day. It is the ignorance of our men of
science, who will accept neither the tradition that several continents
have already sunk, nor the periodical law which acts throughout
the Manvantaric cycle -- it is this ignorance that is the chief
cause of all the confusion. Nor is Bailly wrong again in assuring
us that the Hindus, Egyptians, and Phoenicians came after the
Atlanteans, for the latter belonged to the Fourth, while the Aryans
and their Semitic Branch are of the Fifth Race. Plato, while repeating
the story as narrated to Solon by the priests of Egypt, intentionally
confuses (as every <EM>Initiate </EM>would) the two continents,
and assigns to the small island which sunk last all the events
pertaining to the two enormous continents, the prehistoric and
traditional. Therefore, he describes the <EM>first couple, </EM>from
whom the whole island was peopled, as being formed of the Earth.
In saying so, he means neither Adam and Eve, nor yet his own Hellenic
forefathers. His language is simply allegorical, and by alluding
to &quot;Earth,&quot; he means &quot;matter,&quot; as the Atlanteans
were really the first purely <EM>human </EM>and<EM> terrestrial
</EM>race -- those that preceded it being more divine and ethereal
than human and solid.
<P>
Yet Plato must have known, as would any other initiated adept,
about the history of the Third Race after its &quot;Fall,&quot;
though as one pledged to silence and secrecy he never showed his
knowledge in so many words. Nevertheless, it may become easier
now, after acquainting oneself with even the approximate chronology
of the Eastern nations -- all of which was based upon, and followed
the early Aryan calculations -- to realize the immense periods
of time that must have elapsed since the separation of the sexes,
without mentioning the First or even the Second Root-Races. As
these must remain beyond the comprehension of minds trained in
Western thought, it is found useless to speak in detail of the
First and Second, and even of the Third Race in its earliest stage.*
One has to begin with the latter, when it reached its full human
period, lest the uninitiated reader should find himself hopelessly
bewildered.
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* In that wonderful volume of Donnelly's &quot;Atlantis, the Antediluvian
World,&quot; the author, speaking of the Aryan colonies from Atlantis,
and of the arts and sciences the legacy of our Fourth Race --
bravely announces that &quot;the roots of the institutions of
to-day reach back to the Miocene age.&quot; This is an enormous
allowance for a modern scholar to make; but civilization dates
still further back than the Miocene Atlanteans. &quot;Secondary-period&quot;
man will be discovered, and with him his long forgotten civilization.
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 267 THE NATURAL &quot;FALL.&quot;</H6>

<P>
The THIRD RACE FELL -- and created no longer: it <EM>begot </EM>its
progeny. Being still mindless at the period of separation it begot,
moreover, anomalous offspring, until its physiological nature
had adjusted its instincts in the right direction. Like the &quot;lords
the gods&quot; of the Bible ' the &quot;Sons of Wisdom,&quot;
the Dhyan-Chohans, had warned them to leave alone the fruit forbidden
by Nature: but the warning proved of no value. Men realized the
unfitness -- we must not say sin -- of what they had done, only
when too late: after the angelic monads from higher spheres had
incarnated in, and endowed them with understanding. To that day
they had remained simply physical, like the animals generated
from them. For what is the distinction? The doctrine teaches that
the only difference between animate and inanimate objects on earth,
between an animal and a human frame, is that in some the various
&quot;fires&quot; are latent, and in others they are active. The
<EM>vital fires </EM>are in all things and not an atom is devoid
of them. But no animal has the three higher principles awakened
in him; they are simply potential, latent, and thus <EM>non-existing.
</EM>And so would the animal frames of men be to this day, had
they been left as they came out from the bodies of their Progenitors,
whose <EM>shadows </EM>they were, to grow, unfolded only by the
powers and forces immanent in matter. But as said in <STRONG>P</STRONG>YMANDER:
--
<P>
&quot;This is a Mystery that to this day was sealed and hidden.
Nature* being mingled with Man** brought forth a wondrous miracle;
the harmonious commingling <EM>of the essence of the Seven </EM>(Pitris,
governors) and her own; the <EM>Fire </EM>and the <EM>Spirit </EM>and
Nature (the noumenon of matter); which (commingling) forthwith
brought forth seven men of opposite sexes (negative and positive)
according to the essences of the seven governors.&quot; (<EM>Divine
Pymander, Chap. I., Sect. </EM>16.)
<P>
Thus saith Hermes, the thrice great Initiate,*** &quot;the Power
of the
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Nature is the <EM>natural </EM>body, the shadow of the Progenitors;
and --
<P>
** MAN is the &quot;Heavenly man,&quot; as already stated.
<P>
*** The &quot;Pymander&quot; of our museums and libraries is an
abridgement of one of the Books of Thoth, by a Platonist of Alexandria.
In the Third Century it was remodelled after old Hebrew and Phoenician
<STRONG>MSS</STRONG>. by a Jewish Kabalist, and called the &quot;Genesis
of Enoch.&quot; But even its disfigured remnants show how closely
its text agrees with the Archaic Doctrine, as is shown in the
creation of the Seven Creators and <EM>seven primitive men</EM>.
As to Enoch, Thoth or Hermes, Orpheus and Kadmus, these are all
generic names, branches and offshoots of the seven primordial
sages (incarnated Dhyan Chohans or Devas, in <EM>illusive, </EM>not
mortal bodies) who taught Humanity all it knew, and whose earliest
disciples assumed their master's names. This custom passed from
the Fourth to the Fifth Race. Hence the sameness of the traditions
about Hermes (of whom Egyptologists count five) Enoch, etc., they
are all inventors of letters; none of them dies but still lives,
and they are the first Initiators into, and Founders of the Mysteries.
<EM>The Genesis of Enoch </EM>disappeared only very lately among
the Kabalists. Guillaume [[Footnote continued on next page]] 
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 268 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Thought Divine.&quot; St. Paul, another Initiate, called our world
&quot;the enigmatical mirror of pure truth,&quot; and St. Gregory,
of Nazianzen, corroborated Hermes by stating that &quot;things
visible are but the shadow and delineation of things that we cannot
see.&quot; It is an eternal combination, and images are repeated
from the higher rung of the ladder of being down to the lower.
The &quot;Fall of the Angels,&quot; and the &quot;War in Heaven&quot;
are repeated on every plane, the lower &quot;mirror&quot; disfiguring
the image of the superior mirror, and each repeating it in its
own way. Thus the Christian dogmas are but the reminiscences of
the <EM>paradigms </EM>of Plato, who spoke of these things cautiously,
as every Initiate would. But it is all as expressed in these few
sentences of the <EM>Desatir: -</EM>-
<P>
&quot;All that is on Earth, saith the Lord (Ormazd), is the <EM>shadow
of something that is in the superior spheres. </EM>This luminous
object (light, fire, etc.) is the shadow of that which is still
more luminous than itself, and so on till it reaches ME, who am
the light of lights.&quot;
<P>
In the Kabalistic books, and in the <EM>Zohar </EM>pre-eminently,
the idea that everything objective on earth or in this Universe
is the Shadow -- <EM>Dyooknah</EM> -- of the eternal Light or
Deity, is very strong.
<P>
The Third Race was pre-eminently the bright shadow, at first,
of the gods, whom tradition exiles on Earth after the allegorical
war in Heaven; which became still more allegorical on Earth, for
it was the war between spirit and matter. This war will last till
the inner and divine man adjusts his outer terrestrial self to
his own spiritual nature. Till then the dark and fierce passions
of the former will be at eternal feud with his master, the Divine
Man. But the <EM>animal </EM>will be tamed one day, because its
nature will be changed, and harmony will reign once more between
the two as before the &quot;Fall,&quot; when even mortal man was<EM>
created </EM>by the Elements and was not born.
<P>
The above is made clear in all the great theogonies, principally
in the Grecian (<EM>see Hesiod and Theogony</EM>)<EM>. The mutilation</EM>
of<EM> Uranos </EM>by his son <EM>Kronos, </EM>who thus condemns
him to impotency, has never been understood by the modern Mythographers.
Yet, it is very plain; and having been universal* (<EM>vide foot
note infra</EM>)<EM>, </EM>it must have contained a great abstract
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Postel saw it. It was
most certainly in a great measure a transcript from the books
of Hermes, and far anterior to the Books of Moses, as Eliphas
Levi tells his readers.
<P>
* Uranos is a modified Varuna, &quot;the Universal encompasser,&quot;
the all-embracer, and one of the oldest of the Vedic deities --
<STRONG>S</STRONG>PACE, the maker of Heaven and Earth, since both
are manifested out of his (or its) seed. It is only later that
Varuna became the chief of the Adityas and a kind of Neptune riding
on the <EM>Leviathan -- Makara, </EM>now the most sacred and mysterious
of the signs of the Zodiac. Varuna, &quot;without whom no creature
can even wink,&quot; was degraded like Uranos, and, like him,
<EM>he fell into generation, </EM>his functions, &quot;the grandest
cosmical functions,&quot; as Muir calls them, having been lowered
down from heaven to earth by exoteric anthropomorphism. As the
same [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 269 THE SYMBOLISM OF KRONOS.</H6>

<P>
and philosophical idea, now lost to our modern sages. This punishment
in the allegory marks, indeed &quot;a new period, a second phase
in the development of creation,&quot; as justly remarked by Decharme
(<EM>Mythologie de la Grece Antique, p. </EM>7), who, however,
renounces the attempt to explain it. Uranos has tried to oppose
an impediment to that development, or natural evolution, by <EM>destroying
all his children as soon as born. Uranos, </EM>who personifies
all the creative powers of, and in, <EM>Chaos </EM>(Space, or
the unmanifested Deity) is thus made to pay the penalty; for it
is those powers which cause the <EM>Pitris </EM>to evolve primordial
<EM>men</EM> from themselves -- as, later on, these men evolve
<EM>their </EM>progeny -- without any sense or desire for procreation.
The work of generation, suspended during a moment, passes into
the hands of <EM>Kronos,* time, </EM>who unites himself with <EM>Rhea
</EM>(the earth in esotericism -- matter in general), and thus
produces, after celestial -- terrestrial Titans. The whole of
this symbolism relates to the mysteries of Evolution.
<P>
This allegory is the exoteric version of the esoteric doctrine
given in this part of our work. For in <EM>Kronos </EM>we see
the same story repeated again. As Uranos destroyed his children
from <EM>Gaia </EM>(one, in the world of manifestation, with Aditi
or the Great Cosmic Deep) by confining them in the bosom of the
Earth, <EM>Tythea, so Kronos </EM>at this second stage of creation
destroyed his children from <EM>Rhea -- </EM>by devouring them.
This is an allusion to the fruitless efforts of Earth or Nature
alone to create real <EM>human</EM> men. (<EM>See our Stanzas
III. -- X., et seq., and also Berosus</EM>'<EM> account of primeval
creation.</EM>) Time swallows its own fruitless work. Then comes
Zeus -- Jupiter, who dethrones his father in his turn.** Jupiter
the Titan, is Prometheus, in one sense,*** and varies from Zeus,
the Great
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Orientalist says, &quot;The
attributes ascribed to Varuna (in the Vedas) impart to his character
a moral elevation and sanctity far surpassing that attributed
to any other Vedic Deity.&quot; But to understand correctly the
reason of his fall, like that of Uranos, one has to see in every
exoteric religion the imperfect and sinful work of man's fancy,
and also to study the mysteries which Varuna is said to have imparted
to Vasishta. Only . . . &quot;his secrets and those of Mitra <EM>are
not to be revealed to the foolish.</EM>&quot;
<P>
<EM>* Kronos </EM>is not only [[<EM>Chronos</EM>]],<EM> time</EM>,
but also, as Breal showed in his <EM>Hercule et Cacus </EM>(p.
57), comes from the root <EM>Kar</EM>, &quot;to make, to create.&quot;
Whether Breal and Decharme, who quotes him, are as right in saying
that in the Vedas <EM>Kronan </EM>is a creative god, we have our
doubts. Breal probably meant Karma, or rather Visva-Karma, the
creative god, the &quot;Omnificent&quot; and the &quot;great Architect
of the world.&quot;
<P>
** The Titanic struggle, in theogony at least, is the fight for
supremacy between the children of <EM>Uranos </EM>and <EM>Gaia
</EM>(or Heaven and Earth in their abstract sense), the Titans,
against the children of <EM>Kronos, </EM>whose chief is Zeus.
It is the everlasting struggle going on to this day between the
spiritual inner man and the man of flesh, in one sense.

*** Just as the &quot;Lord God,&quot; or Jehovah, is Cain esoterically,

<P>
&quot;Father of the Gods.&quot; He is the &quot;disrespectful
son&quot; in Hesiod. Hermes calls him the &quot;Heavenly man&quot;
(Pymander); and even in the Bible he is found again under the
name of Adam, and, later on -- by transmutation -- under that
of Ham. Yet these are all personifications of the &quot;sons of
Wisdom.&quot; The necessary corroboration that Jupiter belongs
to the purely <EM>human Atlantean cycle -- if Uranus</EM> and<EM>
Kronos </EM>who precede him are found insufficient -- may be found
in Hesiod, who tells us that the Immortals have made men and created
the Golden and the Silver age (First and Second Races); while
Jupiter created the generations of Bronze (an admixture of <EM>two
</EM>elements), of Heroes, and the men of the age of Iron. After
this he sends his fatal present, by Pandora, to Epimetheus,* which
present Hesiod calls &quot;a fatal gift,&quot; or the <EM>first
woman. </EM>It was a punishment, he explains, sent to man &quot;for
the theft of divine creative fire.&quot; Her apparition on earth
is the signal of every kind of evil. Before her appearance, the
human races lived happy, exempt from sickness and suffering --
as the same races are made to live under Yima's rule, in the Mazdean
<EM>Vendidad.</EM> 
<P>
Two deluges may also be traced in universal tradition by carefully
comparing Hesiod, the Rig Veda, the Zend-Avesta, etc., while no
<EM>first </EM>man is ever mentioned in any of the theogonies
save the Bible.** Everywhere the man of <EM>our race </EM>appears
after a cataclysm of water, after which tradition mentions only
the several designations of continents and islands which sink
under the ocean waves in due time.*** &quot;Gods and mortals have
one common origin&quot; says Hesiod (<EM>ibid. v</EM>. 108); and
Pindar echoes the statement (<EM>Nem. VI., </EM>1). Deucalion
and Pyrrha, who escape the Deluge by constructing an ark like
Noah's (<EM>see Apollod.,</EM> 1, 7, 2,<EM> and Ovid, Metam. </EM>I,
260, 899.), ask Jupiter to re-animate the human race whom he had
made to perish under the waters of the Flood. In the Slavonian
Mythology (<EM>Lithuanian legend, in Grimm, Deutsche Myth. </EM>1,
545), all men were drowned, and two old people, a man and his
wife, alone remained. Then <EM>Pram-gimas </EM>(the &quot;master
of all&quot;) advised them to jump <EM>seven times </EM>on the
rocks of the earth, and <EM>seven new races </EM>(couples) were
born, from which came the nine Lithuanian tribes. As well understood
by the author of the <EM>Mythologie de la Grece Antique -- </EM>the<EM>
</EM>four ages

* In the Egyptian legend, translated by M. Maspero (the ex-director
of the Bulaq Museum), called the &quot;two Brothers,&quot; the
original of Pandora is given. <EM>Noum, </EM>the famous heavenly

<EM>Batoo, </EM>after which the happiness of the latter is destroyed.

signify periods of time, and are also an allegorical allusion
to the races. &quot;The successive races, destroyed and replaced
by others,&quot; he says, &quot;without any period of transition,
are characterized in Greece by the name of metals, to express
their ever-decreasing value. Gold, the most brilliant and precious
of all, symbol of purity . . . . qualifies the first race. . .
. . The men of the second race, those of the age of Silver, are
already inferior to the first. Inert and weak creatures, all their
life is no better than a long and stupid infancy. . . . They disappear.
. . . The men of the age of Bronze are robust and violent (the
third race); their strength is extreme. They had arms made of
bronze, habitations of bronze; used nought but bronze. Iron, the
black metal, was yet unknown&quot; (<EM>Op. at D., </EM>143-155).
The fourth generation (race) is, with Hesiod, that of the heroes
who fell before Thebes (see &quot;<EM>The Seven Against Thebes,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>by AEschylus), or under the walls of Troy.
<P>
Thus, the four races being found mentioned by the oldest Greek
poets, though very much confused anachronistically, our doctrines
are once more corroborated by the classics. But this is all &quot;Mythology&quot;
and poetry. What can modern science have to say to such an euhemerization
of old fictions? The verdict is not difficult to foresee. Therefore
an attempt must be made to answer by anticipation, and prove that
fictions and <EM>empirical </EM>speculations are so much of the
domain of that same science, that none of the men of learning
have the slightest right, with such a heavy beam in their own
eye, to point to the speck in the eye of the Occultist, even if
that speck be not a figment of our opponents' imagination.

<P>
memory of whom lingered from one generation and race to another
generation and race down to the days of Moses, and which found
an objective form in those antediluvian giants, those terrible
sorcerers and magicians, of whom the Roman Church has preserved
such vivid and at the same time distorted legends. One who has
read and studied the Commentaries on the archaic doctrine, will
easily recognise in some Atlanteans, the prototypes of the Nimrods,
the Builders of the Tower of Babel, the Hamites, and all these
<EM>tutti quanti </EM>of &quot;accursed memory,&quot; as theological
literature expresses it: of those, in short, who have furnished
posterity with the orthodox types of Satan. And this leads us
naturally to inquire into the religious ethics of these early
races, mythical as these may be.
<P>
What was the religion of the Third and Fourth Races? In the common
acceptation of the term, neither the Lemurians, nor yet their
progeny, the Lemuro-Atlanteans, had any, as they knew no dogma,
nor had they to believe <EM>on faith. </EM>No sooner had the mental
eye of man been opened to understanding, than the Third Race felt
itself one with the ever-present as the ever to be unknown and
invisible ALL, the One Universal Deity. Endowed with divine powers,
and feeling in himself his <EM>inner </EM>God, each felt he was
a Man-God in his nature, though an animal in his physical Self.
The struggle between the two began from the very day they tasted
of the fruit of the Tree of Wisdom; a struggle for life between
the spiritual and the psychic, the psychic and the physical. Those
who conquered the lower principles by obtaining mastery over the
body, joined the &quot;Sons of Light.&quot; Those who fell victims
to their lower natures, became the slaves of Matter. From &quot;Sons
of Light and Wisdom&quot; they ended by becoming the &quot;Sons
of Darkness.&quot; They had fallen in the battle of mortal life
with Life immortal, and all those so fallen became the seed of
the future generations of Atlanteans.*
<P>
At the dawn of his consciousness, the man of the Third Root Race
had thus no beliefs that could be called <EM>religion. </EM>That
is to say, he was equally as ignorant of &quot;gay religions,
full of pomp and gold&quot; as of any system of faith or outward
worship. But if the term is to be defined as the binding together
of the masses in one form of reverence paid to those we feel higher
than ourselves, of piety -- as a feeling expressed by a child
toward a loved parent -- then even the earliest Lemurians had
a religion -- and a most beautiful one -- from the very beginning
of their intellectual life. Had they not their bright gods of
the elements around
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The name is used here in the sense of, and as a synonym of &quot;sorcerers.&quot;
The Atlantean races were many, and lasted in their evolution for
millions of years: all were not bad. They became so toward their
end, as we (the fifth) are fast becoming now.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 273 THE GOLDEN AGE.</H6>

<P>
them, and even within themselves?* Was not their childhood passed
with, nursed and tendered by those who had given them life and
called them forth to intelligent, conscious life? We are assured
it was so, and we believe it. For the evolution of Spirit into
matter could never have been achieved; nor would it have received
its first impulse, had not the bright Spirits sacrificed their
own respective super-ethereal essences to animate the man of clay,
by endowing each of his inner principles with a portion, or rather,
a reflection of that essence. The Dhyanis of the Seven Heavens
(the seven planes of Being) are the NOUMENOI of the actual and
the future Elements, just as the Angels of the Seven Powers of
nature - the grosser effects of which are perceived by us in what
Science is pleased to call the &quot;modes of motion&quot; --
the imponderable forces and what not -- are the still higher noumenoi
of still higher Hierarchies.
<P>
It was the &quot;Golden Age&quot; in those days of old, the age
when the &quot;gods walked the earth, and mixed freely with the
mortals.&quot; Since then, the gods departed (<EM>i.e.</EM>, became
invisible), and later generations ended by worshipping their kingdoms
-- the Elements.
<P>
It was the Atlanteans, the first progeny of <EM>semi-divine </EM>man
after his separation into sexes -- hence the first-begotten and
humanly-born mortals -- who became the first &quot;Sacrificers&quot;
to the <EM>god of matter. </EM>They stand in the far-away dim
past, in ages more than prehistoric, as the prototype on which
the great symbol of Cain was built,** as the first anthropomorphists
who worshipped form and matter. That worship degenerated very
soon into <EM>self-worship, </EM>thence led to phallicism, or
that which reigns supreme to this day in the symbolisms of every
exoteric religion of ritual, dogma, and form. Adam and Eve <EM>became
matter, </EM>or furnished the soil, Cain and Abel -- the latter
the life-bearing soil, the former &quot;the tiller of that ground
or field.&quot;
<P>
Thus the first Atlantean races, born on the Lemurian Continent,
separated from their earliest tribes into the righteous and the
unrighteous; into those who worshipped the one unseen Spirit of
Nature, the ray of which man feels within himself -- or the Pantheists,
and those who offered fanatical worship to the Spirits of the
Earth, the dark Cosmic, anthropomorphic Powers, with whom they
made alliance. These were the earliest <EM>Gibborim, </EM>&quot;the
mighty men of renown in those
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The &quot;Gods of the Elements&quot; are by no means the Elementals.
The latter are at best used by them as vehicles and materials
in which to clothe themselves. . . . .
<P>
** Cain was the <EM>sacrificer, </EM>as shown at first in chap.
iv. of <EM>Genesis, </EM>of &quot;the fruit of the ground,&quot;
of which he was <EM>first tiller</EM>, while Abel &quot;brought
of the firstlings of his flock&quot; to the Lord. Cain is the
symbol of the first male, Abel of the first female humanity, Adam
and Eve being the types of the third race. (See &quot;<EM>The
Mystery of Cain and</EM> <EM>Abel.</EM>&quot;) The &quot;murdering&quot;
is blood-shedding, but not taking life.<HR>

<P>
days&quot; (<EM>Gen. </EM>vi.); who become with the Fifth Race
the <EM>Kabirim:</EM> Kabiri with the Egyptians and the Phoenicians,
Titans with the Greeks, and Rakshasas and Daityas with the Indian
races.
<P>
Such was the secret and mysterious origin of all the subsequent
and modern religions, especially of the worship of the later Hebrews
for their tribal god. At the same time this sexual religion was
closely allied to, based upon and blended, so to say, with astronomical
phenomena. The Lemurians gravitated toward the North Pole, or
the Heaven of their Progenitors (the Hyperborean Continent); the
Atlanteans, toward the Southern Pole, the<EM> pit</EM>, cosmically
and terrestrially -- whence breathe the hot passions blown into
hurricanes by the cosmic Elementals, whose abode it is. The two
poles were denominated, by the ancients, Dragons and Serpents
-- hence good and bad Dragons and Serpents, and also the names
given to the &quot;Sons of God&quot; (Sons of Spirit and Matter):
the good and bad Magicians. This is the origin of this dual and
triple nature in man. The legend of the &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;
in its esoteric signification, contains the key to the manifold
contradictions of human character; it points to the secret of
man's self-consciousness; it is the angle-iron on which hinges
his entire life-cycle; -- the history of his evolution and growth.
<P>
On a firm grasp of this doctrine depends the correct understanding
of esoteric anthropogenesis. It gives a clue to the vexed question
of the Origin of Evil; and shows how man himself is the separator
of the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE into various contrasted aspects.
<P>
The reader, therefore, will not be surprised if so considerable
space is devoted in each case to an attempt to elucidate this
difficult and obscure subject. A good deal must necessarily be
said on its symbological aspect; because, by so doing, hints are
given to the thoughtful student for his own investigations, and
more light can thus be suggested than it is possible to convey
in the technical phrases of a more formal, philosophical exposition.
The &quot;Fallen Angels,&quot; so-called, are <EM>Humanity</EM>
<EM>itself. </EM>The Demon of Pride, Lust, Rebellion, and Hatred,
has never had <EM>any being before </EM>the appearance of physical
conscious man. It is man who has begotten, nurtured, and allowed
the fiend to develop in his heart; he, again, who has contaminated
the indwelling god in himself, by linking the pure spirit with
the impure demon of matter. And, if the Kabalistic saying, &quot;<EM>Demon
est Deus inversus</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>finds its metaphysical and
theoretical corroboration in dual manifested nature, its practical
application is found in Mankind alone.
<P>
Thus it has now become self-evident that postulating as we do
(<EM>a</EM>) the appearance of man before that of other mammalia,
and even before the ages of the huge reptiles; (<EM>b</EM>) periodical
deluges and glacial periods owing to the karmic disturbance of
the axis; and chiefly (<EM>c</EM>) the birth of man<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 275 NO DEVILS OUTSIDE HUMANITY.</H6>

<P>
from a Superior Being, or what materialism would call a <EM>supernatural</EM>
Being, though it is only super-<EM>human</EM> -- it is evident
that our teachings have very few chances of an impartial hearing.
Add to it the claim that a portion of the Mankind in the Third
Race -- all those Monads of men who had reached the highest point
of Merit and <EM>Karma </EM>in the preceding Manvantara -- owed
their psychic and <EM>rational </EM>natures to divine Beings <EM>hypostasizing
</EM>into their fifth principles, and the <EM>Secret</EM> <EM>Doctrine
</EM>must lose caste in the eyes of not only Materialism but even
of dogmatic Christianity. For, no sooner will the latter have
learned that those angels are identical with their &quot;Fallen&quot;
Spirits, than the esoteric tenet will be proclaimed most terribly
heretical and pernicious.* The <EM>divine </EM>man dwelt in the
animal, and, therefore, when the physiological separation took
place in the natural course of evolution -- when also &quot;all
the animal creation was <EM>untied,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>and males
were attracted to <EM>females -- that race fell: </EM>not because
they had eaten of the fruit of Knowledge and knew good from evil,
but because they knew no better. Propelled by the sexless creative
instinct, the early sub-races had evolved an intermediate race
in which, as hinted in the Stanzas, the higher Dhyan-Chohans had
incarnated.** &quot;When we have ascertained the extent of the
Universe and learnt to know all that there is in it, we will multiply
our race,&quot; answer the <EM>Sons of Will and Yoga </EM>to their
brethren of the same race, who invite them to do as they do. This
means that the great Adepts and Initiated ascetics will &quot;multiply,&quot;
<EM>i.e</EM>., once more produce <EM>Mind-born </EM>immaculate
Sons -- in the Seventh Root-Race.
<P>
It is so stated in the Puranas; in <EM>Adi Parvan </EM>(<EM>p.
</EM>115)<EM> </EM>and <EM>Brahma</EM> <EM>Purana, </EM>etc. In
one portion of the <EM>Pushkara Mahatmya, </EM>moreover, the separation
of the sexes is allegorized by Daksha, who, seeing that his will-born
progeny (the &quot;Sons of passive Yoga&quot;), will not create
men, &quot;<EM>converts half himself into a female </EM>by whom
he begets daughters,&quot; the future females of the Third Race
which begat the giants of Atlantis,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* It is, perhaps, with an eye to this <EM>degradation </EM>of
the highest and purest Spirits, who broke through the intermediate
planes of lower consciousness (the &quot;Seven circles of fire&quot;
of Pymander), that St. James is made to say that &quot;this Wisdom
(<EM>psuche </EM>in the original) descended not from above, but
is earthly, sensual, <EM>devilish</EM>&quot;; and <EM>Psuche</EM>
is <EM>Manas, </EM>the &quot;human soul,&quot; the Spiritual Wisdom
or Soul being <EM>Buddhi. </EM>Yet Buddhi <EM>per se, </EM>being
so near the Absolute, is only <EM>latent</EM> consciousness.
<P>
** This is the &quot;undying race&quot; as it is called in Esotericism,
and exoterically the fruitless generation of the first progeny
of Daksha, who curses Narada, the divine Rishi, alleged to have
dissuaded the Haryaswas and the Sabalaswas, the sons of Daksha,
from procreating their species, by saying &quot;Be born in the
womb; there shall not be a resting place for thee in all these
regions&quot;; after this Narada, the representative of that race
of <EM>fruitless </EM>ascetics, is said, as soon as he dies in
one body, to be reborn in another.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 276 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
the Fourth Race, so called. In the Vishnu Purana it is simply
said that Daksha, the father of mankind, established sexual intercourse
as the means of peopling the world.
<P>
Happily for the human race the &quot;Elect Race&quot; had already
become the vehicle of incarnation of the (intellectually and spiritually)
highest Dhyanis before Humanity had become quite material. When
the last sub-races -- save some lowest -- of the Third Race had
perished with the great Lemurian Continent, &quot;the seeds of
<EM>the Trinity of Wisdom</EM>&quot;<EM> had</EM> already acquired
the secret of immortality on Earth, that gift which allows the
same great personality to step <EM>ad libitum </EM>from one worn-out
body into another.
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>)<EM> </EM>The first war that earth knew, the first
human gore shed, was the result of man's eyes and senses being
opened; which made him see that the daughters of his Brethren
were fairer than his own, and their wives also. There were rapes
committed before that of the Sabines, and Menelauses robbed of
their Helens before the Fifth Race was born. Titans or giants
were the stronger; their adversaries, the wiser. This took place
during the Fourth Race -- that of the giants.
<P>
For &quot;there <EM>were </EM>giants&quot; in the days of old,
indeed* and the evolutionary series of the animal world is a warrant
that the same thing took place within the human races. Lower still
in the order of creation we find witnesses for the same in the
flora going <EM>pari passu </EM>with the fauna in respect of size.
The pretty ferns we collect and dry among the leaves of our favourite
volumes are the descendants of the gigantic ferns which grew during
the carboniferous period.
<P>
Scriptures, and fragments of philosophical and scientific works
-- in short, almost every record that has come down to us from
antiquity -- contain references to giants. No one can fail to
recognize the Atlanteans of the Secret Doctrine in the Rakshasas
of Lanka -- the opponents conquered by Rama. Are these accounts
no better than the production of empty fancy? Let us give the
subject a few moments of attention.

* The traditions of every country and nation point to this fact.
Donnelly quotes from Father Duran's <EM>Historia Antigua de la
Nueva Espana </EM>of 1885, in which a native of Cholula, a centenarian,
accounts for the building of the great pyramid of Cholula, by
saying as follows: &quot;In the beginning, before the light of
the Sun had been created, this land (Cholula) was in obscurity
and darkness . . . . but immediately <EM>after the light of</EM>
<EM>the Sun arose in the East, </EM>there appeared gigantic men
. . . . who built the said pyramid, its builders being scattered
after that to all parts of the Earth.&quot;
<P>
&quot;A great deal of the Central American history is taken up
with the doings of an ancient race of giants called Quinanes,&quot;
says the author of &quot;Atlantis&quot; (p. 204.)<HR>
