<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) The text of the Stanza clearly implies that the human
embryo was nourished <EM>ab extra </EM>by Cosmic forces, and that
the &quot;Father-Mother&quot; furnished apparently the germ that
ripened: in all probability a &quot;sweat-born egg,&quot; to be
hatched out, in some mysterious way, disconnected from the &quot;double&quot;
parent. It is comparatively easy to conceive of an oviparous humanity,
since even now man is, in one sense, &quot;egg-born.&quot; Magendie,
moreover, in his <EM>Precis Elementaire de Physiologie, </EM>citing<EM>
</EM>&quot;a case where the umbilical cord was ruptured and perfectly
cicatrized,&quot; yet the infant was born alive, pertinently asks,
&quot;How was the circulation carried on in this organ?&quot;
On the next page he says: &quot;Nothing is at present known respecting
the use of digestion in the foetus;&quot; and respecting its nutrition,
propounds this query: &quot;What, then, can we say of the nutrition
of the foetus? Physiological works contain only <EM>vague conjectures
</EM>on this point.&quot; &quot;Ah, but,&quot; the sceptic may
urge, &quot;Magendie's book belongs to the last generation, and
Science has since made such strides that his stigma of ignorance
can no longer be fixed upon the profession.&quot; Indeed; then
let us turn to a very great authority upon Physiology, viz., Sir
M. Foster (<EM>Text-Book of Physiology, </EM>third edition, 1879,
p. 623); and to the disadvantage of modern Science we shall find
him saying, &quot;Concerning the rise and development of the functional
activities of the embryo, our knowledge is almost a blank. We
know scarcely anything about the various steps by which the primary
fundamental qualities of the protoplasm of the ovum are differentiated
into the complex phenomena which we have attempted in<HR>

<P>
this book to explain.&quot; The students of Trin. Coll. Cantab.
will now kindly draw a veil before the statue of Hygeia and bandage
the eyes of the busts of Galen and Hippocrates, lest they look
reproachfully at their degenerate descendants. One further fact
we must note. Sir M. Foster is discreetly silent about the case
of the ruptured umbilical cord cited by his great French <EM>confrere.</EM>

<P>
This is a very curious statement as explained in the Commentaries.
To make it clear: The First Race having created the Second by
&quot;budding,&quot; as just explained, the Second Race gives
birth to the Third -- which itself is separated into three distinct
divisions, consisting of men differently procreated. The first
two of these are produced by an oviparous method, presumably unknown
to modern Natural History. While the early sub-races of the Third
Humanity procreated their species by a kind of exudation of moisture
or vital fluid, the drops of which coalescing formed an oviform
ball -- or shall we say egg? -- which served as an extraneous
vehicle for the generation therein of a <EM>foetus </EM>and child,
the mode of procreation by the later races changed, in its results
at all events. The little ones of the earlier races were entirely
sexless -- shapeless even for all one knows*; but those of the
later races were born androgynous. It is in the Third Race that
the separation of sexes occurred. From being previously a-sexual,
Humanity became distinctly hermaphrodite or bi-sexual; and finally
the man-bearing eggs began to give birth, gradually and almost
imperceptibly in their evolutionary development, first, to Beings
in which one sex predominated over the other, and, finally, to
distinct men and women. And now let us search for corroboration
of these statements in the religious legends of East and West.
Let us take the &quot;Egg-born Race&quot; first. Think of Kasyapa,
the Vedic sage, and the most prolific of creators. He was the
son of Marichi, Brahma's mind-born son; and he is made to become
the father of the <EM>Nagas, </EM>or Serpents, among other beings.
Exoterically, the <EM>Nagas </EM>are semi-divine beings which
have a human face and the tail of a serpent. Yet there was a race
of <EM>Nagas, </EM>said to be a thousand in number only, born
or rather sprung from Kadra, Kasyapa's wife, for <EM>the purpose
of peopling Patala, </EM>which is undeniably America, as will
be shown; and there was a NAGA-Dwipa, one of the seven divisions
of Bharata-Varsha, India, inhabited by a people bearing the same
name, who are allowed, even by some Orientalists, to be <EM>historical,
</EM>and to have left many a trace behind them to this day.
<P>
Now the point most insisted upon at present is that, whatever
origin be claimed for man, his evolution took place in this order:
(1) Sexless, as all the earlier forms are; (2) then, by a natural
transition, he became,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* See the &quot;Timaeus.&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 133 BI-SEXUAL REPRODUCTION.</H6>

<P>
&quot;a solitary hermaphrodite,&quot; a bi-sexual being; and (3)
finally separated and became what he is now. Science teaches us
that all the primitive forms, though sexless, &quot;still retained
the power of undergoing the processes of A-Sexual multiplication;&quot;
why, then, should man be excluded from that law of Nature? Bi-sexual
reproduction is an evolution, a specialized and perfected form
on the scale of matter of the fissiparous act of reproduction.
Occult teachings are pre-eminently panspermic, and the early history
of humanity is hidden only &quot;from ordinary mortals;&quot;
nor is the history of the primitive Races buried from the Initiates
in the tomb of time, as it is for profane science. Therefore,
supported on the one hand by that science which shows to us progressive
development and an internal cause for every external modification,
as a law in Nature; and, on the other hand, by an implicit faith
in the wisdom -- we may say pansophia even -- of the universal
traditions gathered and preserved by the Initiates, who have perfected
them into an almost faultless system -- thus supported, we venture
to state the doctrine clearly.
<P>
In an able article, written some fifteen years ago, our learned
and respected friend Prof. Alex. Wilder, of New York, shows the
absolute logic and necessity of believing &quot;The Primeval Race
Double-Sexed,&quot; and gives a number of scientific reasons for
it.* He argues firstly, &quot;that a large part of the vegetable
creation exhibits the phenomenon of bisexuality . . . the Linnaean
classification enumerating thus almost all plants. This is the
case in the superior families of the vegetable kingdoms as much
as in the lower forms, from the Hemp to the Lombardy Poplar and
Ailanthus. In the animal kingdom, in insect life, the moth generates
a worm, as in the <EM>Mysteries </EM>the great secret was expressed:
&quot;<EM>Taurus Draconem genuit, et Taurum Draco.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>The<EM> </EM>coral-producing family, which, according to
Agassiz, 'has spent many hundreds of thousands of years, during
the present geological period, in building out the peninsula of
Florida . . . . produce their offspring from themselves like the
buds and ramifications in a tree.' Bees are somewhat in the same
line . . . . The Aphides or plant lice keep house like Amazons,
and <EM>virgin parents </EM>perpetuate the Race for ten successive
generations.&quot;
<P>
What say the old sages, the philosopher-teachers of antiquity.
Aristophanes speaks thus on the subject in Plato's &quot;<EM>Banquet</EM>&quot;:<EM>
</EM>&quot;Our<EM> </EM>nature of old was not the same as it is
now. It was <EM>androgynous, </EM>the<EM> </EM>form and name partaking
of, and being common to both the male and female. . . . Their
bodies were round, and the manner of their running

<P>
circular.* They were terrible in force and strength and had prodigious
ambition. Hence Zeus <EM>divided each of them into two, </EM>making
them weaker; Apollo, under his direction, closed up the skin.&quot;
<P>
Meshia and Meshiane were but a single individual with the old
Persians. &quot;They also taught that man was the product of the
tree of life, growing in androgynous pairs, till they were separated
at a subsequent modification of the human form.**&quot;
<P>
In the <EM>Toleduth </EM>(generation) of Adam, the verse &quot;God
created (<EM>bara, </EM>brought forth) man in his image, in the
image of God created he him, male and female created he them,&quot;
if read esoterically will yield the true sense, viz.: &quot;The
<EM>Elohim </EM>(Gods) brought forth from themselves (by modification)
man in their image . . . . created they <EM>him </EM>(collective
humanity, or <EM>Adam</EM>),<EM> </EM>male and female created
<EM>he</EM> (collective deity) them.&quot;*** This will show the
esoteric point. The <EM>sexless </EM>Race was their first production,
a modification <EM>of </EM>and<EM> from </EM>themselves, the pure
spiritual existences; and this was Adam <EM>solus. </EM>Thence
came the <EM>second </EM>Race: Adam-Eve or <EM>Jod-Heva, </EM>inactive
androgynes; and finally the <EM>Third, </EM>or the &quot;<EM>Separating
</EM>Hermaphrodite,&quot; Cain and Abel, who produce the Fourth,
Seth-Enos, etc. It is that Third, the last semi-spiritual <EM>race</EM>,
which was also the last vehicle of the divine and innate Wisdom,
ingenerate in the Enochs, the Seers of that Mankind. The <EM>Fourth,
</EM>which had tasted from the fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil
-- Wisdom united already to earthy, and therefore <EM>impure,
</EM>intelligence **** had consequently to acquire that Wisdom
by initiation and great struggle. And the union of Wisdom and
Intelligence, the former <EM>ruling </EM>the latter, is called
in the Hermetic books &quot;the God possessing the double fecundity
of the two sexes.&quot; Mystically Jesus was held to be man-woman.

* Compare Ezekiel's vision (chap. i) of the four divine beings
who &quot;had the likeness of a man&quot; and yet had the appearance
of a wheel, &quot;when they went they went upon their four sides
. . . . for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheel.&quot;
<P>
** See Prof. Wilder's Essay &quot;<EM>The Primeval Race Double-Sexed.</EM>&quot;
<P>
*** Eugibinus, a Christian, and the Rabbis Samuel, Manasseh ben
Israel, and Maimonides taught that &quot;Adam had <EM>two</EM>
faces and <EM>one</EM> person, and from the beginning he was both
male and female -- male on one side and female on the other (like
Manu's Brahma), but afterwards the parts were separated.&quot;
The one hundred and thirty-ninth Psalm of David recited by Rabbi
Jeremiah ben Eliazar is evidence of this. &quot;Thou hast <EM>fashioned
</EM>me behind and before,&quot; not <EM>beset </EM>as in the
Bible, which is absurd and meaningless, and this shows, as Prof.
Wilder thinks, &quot;that the primeval form of mankind was androgynous.&quot;

</EM>(divine occult Wisdom) crieth: &quot;Oh, ye simple, understand
Wisdom; and ye <EM>fools, be of an understanding heart.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>It is <EM>spirit </EM>and <EM>matter</EM>, the<EM> nous </EM>and
the <EM>psyche; </EM>of the latter of which St. James says that
it is &quot;earthly, sensual, and devilish.&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 135 THE VIRGIN THIRD RACE.</H6>

<P>
&quot;Zeus is a male, Zeus is an immortal maid.&quot; The Egyptian
Ammon was the goddess Neith, in his other half. Jupiter has female
breasts, Venus is bearded in some of her statues, and Ila, the
goddess, is also Su-Dyumna, the god, as Vaivasvata's progeny.
<P>
&quot;The name <EM>Adam,</EM>&quot; says Professor A. Wilder,
&quot;or man, itself implies this double form of existence. It
is identical with <EM>Athamas, </EM>or<EM> Thomas </EM>(Tamil
<EM>Tam</EM>), which is rendered by the Greek <EM>Didumos, </EM>a
twin; if, therefore, the first woman was formed subsequently to
the first man, she must, as a logical necessity, be 'taken out
of man' . . . and the <EM>side </EM>which the <EM>Elohim </EM>had
taken from man, 'made he a woman' (<EM>Gen. ii.</EM>).<EM> </EM>The
Hebrew word here used is <EM>Tzala, </EM>which bears the translation
we have given. It is easy to trace the legend in Berosus, who
says that <EM>Thalatth </EM>(the<EM> Omoroca, </EM>or Lady of
Urka) was the beginning of creation. She was also Melita, the
queen of the Moon. . . . The two twin births of<EM> Genesis, </EM>that
of Cain and Abel, and of Esau and Jacob, shadow the same idea.
<EM>The name 'Hebel' is the same as Eve, </EM>and its characteristic
seems to be feminine,&quot; continues the author. &quot;Unto thee
shall be his desire,&quot; said the Lord God to Cain, &quot;and
thou shalt rule over him.&quot; The same language had been uttered
to Eve: &quot;Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall
rule over thee.&quot; . . .
<P>
Thus the pristine bi-sexual unity of the human <EM>Third </EM>Root-Race
is an axiom in the Secret Doctrine. Its virgin individuals were
raised to &quot;Gods,&quot; because that Race represented their
&quot;divine Dynasty.&quot; The moderns are satisfied with worshipping
the male heroes of the Fourth Race, who created gods after their
own sexual image, whereas the gods of primeval mankind were &quot;male
and female.&quot;
<P>
As stated in Book I, the humanities developed coordinately, and
on parallel lines with the four Elements, every new Race being
physiologically adapted to meet the additional element. Our Fifth
Race is rapidly approaching the Fifth Element -- call it interstellar
ether, if you will -- which has more to do, however, with psychology
than with physics. We men have learned to live in every climate,
whether frigid or tropical, but the first two Races had nought
to do with climate, nor were they subservient to any temperature
or change therein. And thus, we are taught, men lived down to
the close of the Third Root-Race, when eternal spring reigned
over the whole globe, such as is now enjoyed by the inhabitants
of Jupiter; a &quot;world,&quot; says M. Flammarion, &quot;which
is not subject like our own to the vicissitudes of seasons nor
to abrupt alternations of temperature, but which is enriched with
all the treasures of eternal spring.&quot; (<EM>&quot;Pluralite
des Mondes,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>p. 69.) Those astronomers who
maintain that Jupiter is in a molten condition, in our sense of
the term, are invited to settle their dispute with this learned
French<HR>

<P>
Astronomer.* It must, however, be always borne in mind that the
&quot;eternal spring&quot; referred to is only a condition <EM>cognised
as such by the Jovians. </EM>It is not &quot;spring&quot; <EM>as
we know it. </EM>In this reservation is to be found the reconciliation
between the two theories here cited. Both embrace <EM>partial</EM>
truths.
<P>
It is thus a universal tradition that mankind has evolved gradually
into its present shape from an almost transparent condition of
texture, and neither by miracle nor by sexual intercourse. Moreover,
this is in full accord with the ancient philosophies; from those
of Egypt and India with their Divine Dynasties down to that of
Plato. And all these universal beliefs must be classed with the
&quot;presentiments&quot; and &quot;obstinate conceptions,&quot;
some of them ineradicable, in popular faiths. Such beliefs, as
remarked by Louis Figuier, are &quot;frequently the outcome of
the wisdom and observation of an infinite number of generations
of men.&quot; For, &quot;<EM>a tradition which has an uniform
and universal existence,</EM> 
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* An hypothesis evolved in 1881 by Mr. Mattieu Williams seems
to have impressed Astronomers but little. Says the author of &quot;<EM>The
Fuel of the Sun</EM>,&quot; in <EM>Knowledge, </EM>Dec. 23, 1881:
&quot;Applying now the researches of Dr. Andrews to the conditions
of Solar existence . . . I conclude that the Sun has <EM>no nucleus,
</EM>either solid, liquid, or gaseous, but is composed of dissociated
matter in the critical state, surrounded, first, by a flaming
envelope, due to the recombination of the dissociated matter,
and outside of this, by another envelope of vapours due to this
combination.&quot;
<P>
This is a novel theory to be added to other hypotheses, <EM>all
scientific and orthodox. </EM>The meaning of the &quot;<EM>critical
</EM>state&quot; is explained by Mr. M. Williams in the same journal
(Dec. 9, 1881), in an article on &quot;Solids, Liquids, and Gases.&quot;
Speaking of an experiment by Dr. Andrews on carbonic acid, the
scientist says that &quot;when 88 [[degrees]] is reached, the
boundary between liquid and gas vanished; <EM>liquid and gas have
blended into one mysterious intermediate fluid; an indefinite
fluctuating something is there filling the whole of the tube --
an etherealised liquid or a visible gas. </EM>Hold a red-hot poker
between your eye and the light; you will see an upflowing wave
of movement of what appears like liquid air. The appearance of
the <EM>hybrid</EM> fluid in the tube resembles this, but is sensibly
denser, and evidently stands between the liquid and gaseous states
of matter, as pitch or treacle stands between solid and liquid.&quot;
<P>
The<EM> temperature at which this occurs has been named by Dr.
Andrews the </EM>&quot;<EM>critical temperature</EM>&quot;; here
the gaseous and the liquid states are &quot;<EM>continuous,</EM>&quot;
and it is probable that <EM>all other substances capable of existing
</EM>in both states have their own particular critical temperatures.
<P>
Speculating further upon this &quot;critical&quot; state, Mr.
Mattieu Williams emits some quite <EM>occult</EM> theories about
Jupiter and other planets. He says: &quot;<EM>Our</EM> <EM>notions
of solids, liquids, and gases are derived from our experiences
of the state of matter here upon this Earth. Could we be removed
to another planet, they would be curiously changed. </EM>On Mercury
water would rank as one of the condensible gases; on Mars, as
a fusible solid; but what on Jupiter?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Recent observations justify us in regarding this as a miniature
sun, with an external envelope of cloudy matter, apparently of
partially-condensed water, but red-hot, or probably still hotter
within. His vaporous atmosphere is evidently of enormous depth,
and the force of gravitation being on his visible outer surface
two-and-a-half [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 137 EGYPTIAN BELIEF.</H6>

<P>
<EM>has all the weight of scientific testimony.</EM>&quot;<EM>*
</EM>And there is more than one such tradition in the Puranic
allegories, as has been shown. Moreover, the doctrine that the
first Race of mankind was formed out of the <EM>chhayas </EM>(astral
images) of the Pitris, is fully corroborated in the <EM>Zohar.
</EM>&quot;In the <EM>Tzalam </EM>(shadow image) of Elohim (the
Pitris), was made Adam (man). (Cremona, Ed. iii., 76<EM>a</EM>;
Brody, Ed. iii., 159<EM>a</EM>; &quot;Qabbalah,&quot; Isaac Myer,
p. 420.)
<P>
It has been repeatedly urged as an objection that, however high
the degree of metaphysical thought in ancient India, yet the old
Egyptians had nothing but crass idolatry and zoolatry to boast
of; Hermes, as alleged, being the work of mystic Greeks who lived
in Egypt. To this, one answer can be given -- a direct proof that
the Egyptians believed in the Secret Doctrine is, that it was
taught to them at Initiation. Let the objectors open the &quot;<EM>Eclogae
Physicae et Ethicae</EM>&quot; of <EM>Stobaeus, </EM>the<EM> </EM>Greek
compiler of ancient fragments, who lived in the fifth century,
<B>A.D</B>. The following is a transcription by him of an old
Hermetic fragment, showing the Egyptian theory of the Soul. Translated
word for word, it says: --
<P>
&quot;From one Soul, that of ALL<STRONG>, </STRONG>spring all
the Souls, which spread themselves as if purposely distributed
through the world. These souls undergo many transformations; those
which are already creeping creatures turn into aquatic animals;
from these aquatic animals are derived land animals; and from
the latter the birds. From the beings who live aloft in the air
(heaven) men are born. On reaching that
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] times greater than that
on our Earth's surface, the atmospheric pressure, in descending
below this visible surface, must soon reach that at which the
vapour of water would be brought to its critical condition. Therefore
we may infer that <EM>the oceans of Jupiter are neither of frozen,
liquid, nor gaseous water, but are oceans or atmospheres of critical
water. If any fish or birds swim or fly therein, they must be
very critically organized.</EM>&quot;
<P>
As the whole mass of Jupiter is 300 times greater than that of
the Earth, and its compressing energy towards the centre proportional
to this, its materials, if similar to those of the Earth, and
no hotter, would be considerably more dense, and the whole planet
would have a higher specific gravity; but we know by the movement
of its satellites that, instead of this, its specific gravity
is less than a fourth of that of the Earth. This justifies the
conclusion that it is intensely hot; for even hydrogen, if cold,
would become denser than Jupiter under such pressure.
<P>
&quot;As all elementary substances may exist as solids, liquids,
or gases, or, critically, according to the conditions of temperature
and pressure, I am justified in hypothetically concluding that
<EM>Jupiter is neither a solid, a liquid, nor a gaseous planet,
but a critical planet, or an orb composed internally of associated
elements in the critical state, and surrounded by a dense atmosphere
of their vapours </EM>and those of some of their compounds such
as water. The same reasoning applies to Saturn and other large
and rarified planets.&quot;
<P>
It is gratifying to see how <EM>scientific imagination </EM>approaches
every year more closely to the borderland of our occult teachings.

<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) This verse cannot be understood without the help
of the Commentaries. It means that the First Root-Race, the &quot;Shadows&quot;
of the Progenitors, could not be injured, or destroyed by death.
Being so ethereal and so little human in constitution, they could
not be affected by any element -- flood or fire. But their &quot;Sons,&quot;
the Second Root-Race, could be and were so destroyed. As the &quot;progenitors&quot;
merged wholly in their own astral bodies, which were their progeny;
so that progeny was absorbed in its descendants, the &quot;Sweat-born.&quot;
These were the second Humanity -- composed of the most heterogeneous
gigantic semi-human monsters -- the first attempts of material
nature at building human bodies. The ever-blooming lands of the
Second Continent (Greenland, among others) were transformed, in
order, from Edens with their eternal spring, into hyperborean
Hades. This transformation was due to the displacement of the
great waters of the globe, to oceans changing their beds; and
the bulk of the Second Race perished in this first great throe
of the evolution and consolidation of the globe during the human
period. Of such great cataclysms there have already been four.*
And we may expect a fifth for ourselves in due course of time.

<P>
The accounts in the various Puranas about our Progenitors are
as contradictory <EM>in their details </EM>as everything else.
Thus while, <EM>in the Rig Veda, </EM>Ida (or Ila) is called the
Instructress of Vaivasvata Manu, Sayana makes of her a goddess
presiding over the Earth, and the Sathapatha Brahmana shows her
to be the Manu's daughter, an <EM>offering of his sacrifice, </EM>and,
later on, his (Vaivasvata's) <EM>wife, by whom he begat the race
of Manus. </EM>In the Puranas, again, she is Vaivasvata's daughter,
yet the wife of Budha (Wisdom), the illegitimate son of the Moon
(Soma) and the planet Jupiter's (<EM>Brihhaspati's</EM>) wife,
Tara. All this, which seems a jumble to the profane, is full of
philosophical meaning to the Occultist. On the very face of the
narrative a secret and sacred meaning is per-

ceivable, all the details, however, being so purposely mixed up
that the experienced eye of an Initiate alone can follow them
and place the events in their proper order.
<P>
The story as told in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; strikes the key-note,
and yet it needs to be explained by the secret sense contained
in the Bhagavad Gita. It is the <EM>prologue to the drama </EM>of
our (Fifth) Humanity. While Vaivasvata was engaged in devotion
on the river bank, a fish craves his protection from a bigger
fish. He saves and places it in a jar, where, growing larger and
larger, it communicates to him the news of the forthcoming deluge.
It is the well-known &quot;Matsya Avatar,&quot; the first Avatar
of Vishnu, the <EM>Dagon* </EM>of the Chaldean Xisuthrus, and
many other things besides. The story is too well known to need
repetition. Vishnu orders a ship to be built, in which Manu is
said to be saved along with the seven Rishis, the latter, however,
being absent from other texts. Here the seven Rishis stand for
the <EM>seven Races, </EM>the seven principles, and various other
things; for there is again a double mystery involved in this manifold
allegory.
<P>
We have said elsewhere that the great Flood had several meanings,
and that it referred, as also does the FALL, to both spiritual
and physical, cosmic and terrestrial, events: as above, so it
is below. The ship or ark -- <EM>navis </EM>-- in short, being
the symbol of the female generative principle, is typified in
the heavens by the Moon, and on Earth by the Womb: both being
the vessels and bearers of the seeds of life and being, which
the sun, or Vishnu, the male principle, vivifies and fructifies.**
The First Cosmic Flood refers to primordial creation, or the formation
of Heaven and the Earths; in which case Chaos and the great Deep
stand for the &quot;Flood,&quot; and the Moon for the &quot;Mother,&quot;
from whom proceed all the life-germs.*** But the terrestrial Deluge

were <EM>Ea,</EM> Anu, and the primeval Bel; and that <EM>Ea,</EM>

*** It is far later on that the Moon became a male god; with the
Hindus it was Soma, with the Chaldeans Nannak or Nannar, and Sin,
the son of Mulil, the older Bel. The &quot;Akkadians&quot; called
him the &quot;Lord of Ghosts&quot;; and he was the god of Nipoor
(Niffer) in northern Babylonia. It is Mulil who caused the waters
of the Flood to fall from heaven on Earth, for which Xisuthrus
would not allow him to approach his altar. As the modern Assyriologists
have now ascertained, it is the northern Nipoor which is the centre
whence Chaldean (black) magic spread; and Eridu (the Southern)
which was the primitive seat of the worship of the culture god,
the god of divine wisdom -- the Sun-God being the supreme deity
everywhere. With the Jews, the Moon is connected with Israel's
Jehovah and his seed, because Ur was the chief seat of the worship
of the Moon-god, and because Abraham is said to have come from
Ur, when from A-bra(h)m, he becomes Abraham.<HR>

its story has also its dual application. In one case it has reference
to that mystery when mankind was saved from utter destruction,
by the mortal woman being made the receptacle of the human seed
at the end of the Third Race,* and in the other to the real and
historical Atlantean submersion. In both cases the &quot;Host&quot;
-- or the Manu which saved the <EM>seed -- </EM>is called Vaivasvata
Manu. Hence the diversity between the Puranic and other versions;
while in the Sathapatha Brahmana, Vaivasvata produces a daughter
and begets from her the race of Manu; which is a reference to
the first human <EM>Manushyas, </EM>who<EM> </EM>had to create
women by will (<EM>Kriyasakti</EM>),<EM> </EM>before they were
naturally born from the hermaphrodites as an independent sex,
and who were, therefore, regarded as their creator's <EM>daughters.
</EM>The Puranic accounts make of her (<EM>Ida </EM>or<EM> Ila</EM>)
the wife of Budha (Wisdom), the latter version referring to the
events of the Atlantean flood, when Vaivasvata, the great Sage
on Earth, saved the Fifth Root-race from being destroyed along
with the remnants of the Fourth.
<P>
This is shown very clearly in the <EM>Bhagavad Gita, </EM>where
Krishna is made to say: --
<P>
&quot;The Seven great Rishis, the <EM>four preceding Manus, </EM>partaking
of my essence, were born from my mind: from them sprung (were
born) the human races and the world.&quot; (<EM>Chapter X., verse</EM>
6).
<P>
Here the four preceding &quot;Manus,&quot; out of the seven, are
the four Races** which have already lived, since Krishna belongs
to the Fifth Race, his death having inaugurated the Kali Yuga.

* When Narada, the virgin-ascetic, threatened to put an end to
the human race by preventing Daksha's sons from procreating it.
<P>
** This is corroborated by a learned Brahmin. In his most excellent
lectures on the Bhagavad Gita (<EM>see &quot;Theosophist,&quot;
April, </EM>1887,<EM> p.</EM> 444) the lecturer says: &quot;There
is a peculiarity to which I must call your attention. He (Krishna)
speaks here of four Manus. Why does he speak of four? We are now
in the seventh Manvantara, that of Vaivasvata. If he is speaking
of the past Manus, he ought to speak of six, but he only mentions
four. In some commentaries an attempt has been made to interpret
this in a peculiar manner. The word 'Chatvaraha' is separated
from the word 'Manavaha,' and is made to refer to Sanaka, Sanandana,
Sanatkumara, and Sanatsujata, who are also included among the
mind-born sons of Prajapati. But this interpretation will lead
to a most absurd conclusion, and make the sentence contradict
itself. The persons alluded to in the text have a qualifying clause
in the sentence. It is well known that Sanaka and the other three
refused to create, though the other sons had consented to do so;
therefore, in speaking of those persons from whom humanity has
sprung into existence, it would be absurd to include those four
also in the list. The passage must be interpreted without splitting
the compound into two nouns. The number of Manus will then be
four, and the statement would then contradict the Puranic account,
though it would be in harmony with the occult theory. You will
recollect that it is stated (in Occultism) that we are now in
the Fifth Root-Race. Each Root-Race is considered as the <EM>Santhathi
</EM>of a particular Manu. Now, the Fourth Race has passed, or,
in other words, there have been four past Manus. . . . . &quot;

<P>
Manu, the son of Surya (the Sun), and the saviour of our Race,
is connected with the <EM>Seed of Life, </EM>both physically and
spiritually. But, at present, while speaking of all, we have to
concern ourselves only with the first two.
<P>
The &quot;Deluge&quot; is undeniably an <EM>universal tradition.
</EM>&quot;Glacial periods&quot; were numerous, and so were the
&quot;Deluges,&quot; for various reasons. Stockwell and Croll
enumerate some half dozen Glacial Periods and subsequent Deluges
-- the earliest of all being dated by them 850,000, and the last
about 100,000, years ago.* But which was <EM>our </EM>Deluge?
Assuredly the former, the one which to this date remains recorded
in the traditions of all the peoples, from the remotest antiquity;
the one that finally swept away the last peninsulas of Atlantis,
beginning with Ruta and Daitya and ending with the (comparatively)
small island mentioned by Plato. This is shown by the agreement
of certain details in all the legends. It was the last of its
gigantic character. The little deluge, the traces of which Baron
Bunsen found in Central Asia, and which he places at about 10,000
years <STRONG>B.C.</STRONG>, had nothing to do with either the
semi-universal Deluge, or Noah's flood -- the latter being a purely
mythical rendering of old traditions -- nor even with the submersion
of the last Atlantean island; at least, only a moral connection.
<P>
Our Fifth Race (the non-initiated portions), hearing of many deluges,
confused them, and now know of but one. This one altered the whole
aspect of the globe in its interchange and shifting of land and
sea.
<P>
We may compare the traditions of the Peruvians: -- &quot;The Incas,
<EM>seven </EM>in number, have repeopled the Earth after the deluge,&quot;
they say<EM> (Coste </EM>I,<EM> IV., p. </EM>19); Humboldt mentions
the Mexican version of the same legend, but confuses somewhat
the details of the still-preserved legend concerning the American
Noah. Nevertheless, the eminent Naturalist mentions <EM>twice
seven </EM>companions and the <EM>divine bird </EM>which preceded
the boat of the Aztecs, and thus makes fifteen elect instead of
the seven and the fourteen. This was written probably under some
involuntary reminiscence of Moses, who is said to have mentioned
fifteen grandsons of Noah, who escaped with their grandsire. Then
again Xisuthrus, the Chaldean Noah, is saved and translated <EM>alive
</EM>to heaven -- like Enoch -- with the seven gods, the <EM>Kabirim,
</EM>or the seven divine Titans; again the Chinese <EM>Yao </EM>has<EM>
seven </EM>figures which sail with him and which he will <EM>animate

with Agruerus, the great Phoenician god (whom Faber sought to
identify with Noah*); further, it is suspected that the name of
&quot;Titan&quot; is derived from <EM>Tit-Ain</EM> -- &quot;the
fountains of the chaotic abyss&quot;** (Tit-Theus, or Tityus is
&quot;the <EM>divine deluge</EM>&quot;);<EM> </EM>and thus the
Titans, who are <EM>seven, </EM>are shown to be connected with
the Flood and the seven Rishis saved by Vaivasvata Manu.***
<P>
They are the sons of Kronos (Time) and Rhea (the Earth); and as
Agruerus, Saturn and Sydyk are one and the same personage, and
as the seven Kabiri are said to be the sons of Sydyk or Kronos-Saturn,
the Kabiri and Titans are identical. For once the pious Faber
was right in his conclusions when he wrote: &quot;I have no doubt
of the seven Titans and Kabiri being the same as the seven Rishis
of the Hindu <EM>mythology </EM>(?)<EM>, </EM>who are said to
have escaped in a boat along with Manu, the head (?) of the family.&quot;
<P>
But he is less fortunate in his speculations when he adds &quot;The
Hindoos, in their <EM>wild </EM>legends have <EM>variously perverted
the history of the Noachidae </EM>(? !), yet it is remarkable
that they seem to have religiously adhered to the number seven.&quot;****
Hence Captain (Col.) Wilford very judiciously observes: that &quot;Perhaps
the seven Manus, the seven Brahmadicas and the seven Rishis are
the same, and make only seven individual persons.***** The seven
Brahmadicas were Prajapatis, or lords 'of the prajas or creatures.'
From them mankind was born, and they are probably the same with
the seven Manus. . . . These seven grand ancestors of the human
race were created for the purpose of replenishing the Earth with
inhabitants.&quot; (<EM>Asiatic Researches, Vol. V. p. </EM>246);
and Faber adds that: &quot;the mutual resemblance of the Kabirs,
the Titans, the Rishis, and the Noetic family, is too striking
to be the effect of mere accident.&quot;******
<P>
Faber was led into this mistake, and subsequently built his entire
theory concerning the Kabiri, on the fact that the name of the
scriptural

* Agruerus is <EM>Kronos, </EM>or Saturn, and the prototype of
the Israelitish Jehovah. As connected with <EM>Argha, </EM>the
Moon or Ark of salvation, Noah is mythologically one with Saturn.
But then this cannot relate to the terrestrial flood. (<EM>But

<P>
Japhet is on the list of the Titans contained in a verse of the
Orphic hymns. According to Orpheus the names of the seven &quot;Arkite&quot;
Titans (whom Faber refuses to identify with the <EM>impious </EM>Titans,
their descendants) were Koeus, Kroeus, Phorcys, Kronos, Oceanus,
Hyperion, and <EM>Iapetus:</EM> --

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
But why could not the Babylonian Ezra have adopted the name of
<EM>Iapetos </EM>for one of Noah's sons? The Kabiri, who are the
Titans, are also called Manes and their mother Mania, according
to Arnobius. (<EM>Adversum Gentes, lib. III., p. </EM>124.) The
Hindus can therefore claim with far more reason that the Manes
mean their Manus, and that Mania is the <EM>female </EM>Manu.
(See <EM>Ramayana</EM>.) Mania is Ila or Ida, the wife and daughter
of Vaivasvata Manu, from whom &quot;he begat the race of Manus.&quot;
Like <EM>Rhea, </EM>the mother of the Titans, she is the Earth
(Sayana making her the goddess of the Earth), and she is but the
second edition and repetition of Vach. Both <EM>Ida</EM> and<EM>
Vach </EM>are turned into males and females; Ida becoming Sudyumna,
and Vach, &quot;the female Viraj,&quot; turning into a woman in
order to punish the Gandharvas; one version referring to cosmic
and divine theogony, the other to the later period. The<EM> Manes
</EM>and Mania of Arnobius are names of Indian origin, appropriated
by the Greeks and Latins and disfigured by them.
<P>
Thus it is no accident, but the result of one archaic doctrine
common to all, of which the Israelites, through Ezra, the author
of the modernised Mosaic books, were the latest adapters. So unceremonious
were they with other people's property, that Berosus (<EM>Antiquitates
Libyae,</EM> I, <EM>fol. </EM>8), shows that <EM>Titea -- </EM>of
whom Diodorus makes the mother of the Titans or <EM>Diluvians
</EM>(<EM>See Bibl. lib. III. p. </EM>170) -- was the <EM>wife
of Noah. </EM>For this Faber calls him the &quot;<EM>pseudo-Berosus,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>yet accepts the information in order to register one proof
more that the pagans have borrowed all their gods from the Jews,
by transforming patriarchal material. According to our humble
opinion, this is one of the best proofs possible of exactly the
reverse. It shows as clearly as facts can show, that it is the
Biblical <EM>pseudo</EM>-personages which are all borrowed from
pagan myths, if myths they must be. It shows, at any rate, that
Berosus was well aware of the source of <EM>Genesis, </EM>and
that it bore the same cosmic astronomical character as the allegories
of Isis-Osiris, and the Ark, and other older &quot;Arkite&quot;
symbols. For, Berosus says that &quot;Titea magna&quot; was afterwards
called <EM>Aretia,* </EM>and worshipped with the Earth; and this

mother of the Titans, and with <EM>Ida -</EM>- both being goddesses
who preside over the Earth, and the mothers of the Manus and Manes
(or Tit-an-Kabiri). And &quot;Titea-Aretia&quot; was worshipped
as <EM>Horchia, </EM>says the same Berosus, and this is a title
of Vesta, goddess of the Earth. &quot;<EM>Sicanus deificavit Aretiam,

<P>
Scarce an ancient poet of historic or prehistoric days who failed
to mention the sinking of the two continents -- often called isles
-- in one form or another. Hence the destruction, besides Atlantis,
of the Phlegyae. (See Pausanias and Nonus, who both tell how:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;From its deep-rooted base the Phlegyan isle<BR>
Stern Neptune shook, and plunged beneath the waves<BR>
Its impious inhabitants. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&quot;<BR>
<I>-- Dionysius lib xviii. p. </I>319).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Faber felt convinced that the &quot;insulae Phlegyae&quot; were
Atlantis. But all such allegories are more or less distorted echoes
of the Hindu tradition about that great Cataclysm, which befell
the Fourth, really human, though gigantic, Race, the one which
preceded the Aryan. Yet, as just said, like all other legends,
that of &quot;the Deluge has more than one meaning. It refers
in Theogony, to <EM>pre-cosmic transformations,</EM> to <EM>spiritual
correlations -- </EM>however<EM> </EM>absurd the term may sound
to a scientific ear -- and also to subsequent Cosmogony; to the
great FLOOD of WATERS (matter) in CHAOS, awakened and fructified
by those Spirit-Rays which were swamped by, and <EM>perished </EM>in,
the mysterious differentiation -- a pre-cosmic mystery, the Prologue
to the drama of Being. Anu, Bel, and Noah preceded Adam Kadmon,
Adam the Red, and Noah; just as Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva preceded
Vaivasvata and the rest.&quot; (See &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled.,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>Vol<EM>. </EM>II., pp. 420 <EM>et seq., </EM>where one or
two of the seven meanings are hinted at.)
<P>
All this goes to show that the <EM>semi</EM>-universal deluge
known to geology (first glacial period) must have occurred just
at the time allotted to it by the Secret Doctrine: namely, 200,000
years (in round numbers) after the commencement of our FIFTH RACE,
or about the time assigned by Messrs. Croll and Stockwell for
the first glacial period: <EM>i.e.</EM>, about 850,000 years ago.

source, but with the addition of another factor, the shifting
of the Earth's axis -- a proof of which may be found in the <EM>Book
of Enoch,* </EM>if the veiled language of the Puranas is not understood
-- all this should tend to show that the ancients knew something
of the &quot;modern discoveries&quot; of Science. Enoch, when
speaking of &quot;the great inclination of the Earth,&quot; which
&quot;is in travail,&quot; is quite significant and clear.
<P>
Is not this evident? Nuah is Noah, <EM>floating </EM>on the waters
in his ark; the latter being the emblem of the Argha, or Moon,
the feminine principle; Noah is the &quot;spirit&quot; falling
into matter. We find him, as soon as he descends upon the Earth,
planting a vineyard, drinking of the wine, and getting drunk on
it, <EM>i.e., </EM>the pure spirit becomes intoxicated as soon
as it is finally imprisoned in matter. The seventh chapter of
<EM>Genesis </EM>is only another version of the First. Thus, while
the latter reads: &quot;and darkness was upon the face of the
deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,&quot;
in ch. 7 it is said &quot; . . . and the waters prevailed . .
. and the ark went (with Noah, the spirit) upon the face of the
waters.&quot; Thus Noah, if identical with the Chaldean Nuah,
is the spirit vivifying <EM>matter, </EM>which latter is Chaos,
represented by the <STRONG>D</STRONG>EEP, or the Waters of the
Flood. In the Babylonian legend (the pre-cosmical blended with
the terrestrial event) it is Ishtar (Astaroth or Venus, the lunar
goddess) who is shut up in the ark and sends out &quot;a <EM>dove
</EM>in search of dry land.&quot; (&quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>&quot;<EM>

<P>
George Smith notes in the &quot;<EM>Tablets</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>first
the creation of the moon, and then that of the sun: &quot;Its
beauty and perfection are extolled, and the regularity of its
orbit, which led to its being considered the type of a judge and
the regulator of the world.&quot; If this story related simply
to a cosmogonical cataclysm -- even were this latter universal
-- why should the goddess Ishtar or Astoreth, the Moon, speak
of the <EM>creation of the sun </EM>after the deluge? The waters
might have reached as high as the mountain of <EM>Nizir </EM>(Chaldean
version), or Jebel Djudi (the deluge mountains of the Arabian
legend), or yet Ararat (of the Biblical narrative), and even the
Himalaya (of the Hindu tradition), and yet not reach the sun:
the Bible itself stopped short of such a miracle! It is evident
that the deluge of the people who first recorded it had another
meaning, less problematical and far more philosophical than that
of an <EM>universal </EM>deluge, of which there are no geological
traces whatever.

As all such Cataclysms are periodical and cyclical, and as Manu

serious objection to the supposition that the first &quot;great
flood&quot; had an allegorical, as well as a cosmic meaning, and
that it happened at the end of the Satya Yuga, the &quot;age of
Truth,&quot; when the <EM>Second </EM>Root Race, &quot;The Manu
with bones,&quot; made its primeval appearance as &quot;the Sweat-Born.&quot;*
<P>
The Second Flood -- the so-called &quot;universal&quot; -- which
affected the Fourth Root Race (now conveniently regarded by theology
as &quot;the accursed race of giants,&quot; the <STRONG>C</STRONG>AINITES,
and &quot;the sons of Ham&quot;) is that flood which was first
perceived by geology. If one carefully compares the accounts in
the various legends of the Chaldees and other exoteric works of
the nations, it will be found that all of them agree with the
orthodox narratives given in the Brahmanical books. And it may
be perceived that while, in the first account, &quot;there is
no God or mortal yet on Earth,&quot; when Manu Vaivasvata lands
on the Himavan; in the second, the Seven Rishis are allowed to
keep him company: thus showing that whereas some accounts refer
to the sidereal and cosmic <STRONG>F</STRONG>LOOD before the so-called
creation, the others treat, one of the Great Flood of Matter on
Earth, and the other of a real watery deluge. In the <EM>Satapatha
Brahmana, </EM>Manu finds that &quot;the Flood had swept away
all living creatures, and he alone was left&quot; -- <EM>i.e.,
the seed of life </EM>alone remained from the previous dissolution
of the <EM>Universe, </EM>or <EM>Mahapralaya, </EM>after<EM> </EM>a
&quot;Day of Brahma&quot;; and the <EM>Mahabharata </EM>refers
simply to the geological cataclysm which swept away nearly all
the Fourth Race to make room for the Fifth. Therefore is Vaivasvata
Manu shown under three distinct attributes in our esoteric Cosmogony:**
(<EM>a</EM>) as the &quot;Root-Manu&quot;

sons of Vasishta, who in the <EM>Third</EM> Manvantara, were sons
of Brahma (<EM>i.e</EM>., Rishis), the illustrious progeny of
Urja.&quot; This is plain: the Humanity of the First Manvantara
is that of the seventh and of all the intermediate ones. The mankind
of the First Root-Race is the mankind of the <EM>second, third,
fourth, fifth</EM>, etc. To the last it forms a cyclic and constant
reincarnation of the Monads belonging to the Dhyan Chohans of

on Globe A in the First Round; (<EM>b</EM>) as the &quot;<EM>seed
</EM>of life&quot; on Globe D in the Fourth Round; and (<EM>c</EM>)
as the &quot;Seed of Man&quot; at the beginning of every Root-Race
-- in our Fifth Race especially. The very commencement of the
latter witnesses, during the Dvapara Yuga,* the destruction of
the accursed sorcerers; &quot;of that island (Plato speaking only
of its last island) beyond the Pillars of Hercules, in the Atlantic
Ocean, from which there was an easy transition to other islands
in the neighbourhood of another <EM>large Continent</EM>&quot;
(America). It is this &quot;Atlantic&quot; land which was connected
with the &quot;<EM>White Island,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>and this
White Island was Ruta; but it was not the Atala and the<EM> &quot;White
Devil</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>of Colonel Wilford (<EM>see &quot;Asiatic
Researches,&quot; Vol. VIII., p. </EM>280), as already shown.
It may well be remarked here that the Dvapara Yuga lasts 864,000
years, according to the Sanskrit texts; and that, if the <EM>Kali
Yuga </EM>began only about 5,000 years ago, that it is just 869,000
since that destruction took place. Again, these figures are not
very widely different from those given by the geologists, who
place their &quot;glacial period&quot; 850,000 years ago.
<P>
Then &quot;a woman was produced who came to Manu and declared
<EM>herself his daughter, with whom he lived and begat the offspring
of Manu</EM>.&quot;<EM> </EM>This refers to the physiological
transformation of sexes during the Third Root-Race. And the allegory
is too transparently clear to need much explanation. Of course,
as already remarked, in the separation of sexes an androgyne being
was supposed to divide his body into two halves (as in the case
of Brahma and Vach, and even of Adam and Eve), and thus the female
is, in a certain sense, his daughter, just as he will be her son,
&quot;the flesh of his (and her) flesh and the bone of his (and
her) bone.&quot; Let it be also well remembered that not one of
our Orientalists have yet learned to discern in those &quot;contradictions
and amazing nonsense,&quot; as some call the Puranas, that a reference
to a Yuga may mean a Round, a Root-Race, and often a <EM>Sub-Race,
</EM>as well as form a page torn out of pre-cosmic theogony. This
double and triple meaning is proved by various references to one
and the same individual apparently, under an identical name, while
it refers, in fact, to events divided by entire Kalpas. A good
instance is that of Ila. She is first represented as one thing
and then as another. In the exoteric legends it is said that Manu
Vaivasvata, desiring to create sons, instituted a sacrifice to
Mitra and Varuna; but, through a mistake of the officiating

* The Dvapara Yuga differs for each Race. All races have their
own cycles, which fact causes a great difference. For instance,
the Fourth Sub-Race of the Atlanteans was in its Kali-Yug, when
destroyed, whereas the Fifth was in its Satya or <EM>Krita </EM>Yuga.
The Aryan Race is now in its Kali Yuga, and will continue to be
in it for 427,000 years longer, while various &quot;family Races,&quot;
called the Semitic, Hamitic, etc., are in their own special cycles.
The forthcoming 6th Sub Race -- which may begin very soon -- will
be in its Satya (golden) age while we reap the fruit of our iniquity
in our Kali Yuga.<HR>

Brahman, a daughter only was obtained -- Ila. Then, &quot;through
the favour of the gods,&quot; her <EM>sex is changed </EM>and
she becomes a man, <EM>Su-dyumna. </EM>Then she is again turned
into a woman, and so on; the fable adding that Siva and his consort
were pleased that &quot;she would be male one month and female
another.&quot; This has a direct reference to the Third Root-Race,
whose men were androgynes. But some very learned Orientalists
think (<EM>see </EM>&quot;<EM>Hindu Classical Dictionary</EM>&quot;)<EM>
</EM>and have declared that &quot;Ila was primarily food, nourishment,
or a libation of milk; thence a stream of praise, personified
as the goddess of speech.&quot; The &quot;profane&quot; are not
told, however, the reason why &quot;a libation of milk,&quot;
or &quot;a stream of praise,&quot; should be <EM>male </EM>and<EM>
female </EM>by turn: unless, indeed there is some &quot;internal
evidence&quot; which the occultists fail to perceive.
<P>
In their most mystical meanings, the union of Swayambhuva Manu
with Vach-Sata-Rupa, his own daughter (this being the first &quot;euhemerization&quot;
of the dual principle of which Vaivasvata Manu and Ila are a secondary
and a third form), stands in Cosmic symbolism as the Root-life,
the germ from which spring all the Solar Systems, the worlds,
angels and the gods. For, as says Vishnu: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;From Manu all creation, gods, Asuras, man must be produced,
<BR>
By him the world must be created, that which moves and moveth
not. . . . .&quot;

<P>
But we may find worse opponents than even the Western Scientists
and Orientalists. If, on the question of figures, Brahmins may
agree with our teaching, we are not so sure that some of them,
orthodox conservatives, may not raise objections to the modes
of procreation attributed to their <EM>Pitar Devatas. </EM>We
shall be called upon to produce the works from which we quote,
while they will be invited by us to read their own Puranas a little
more carefully and with an eye to the esoteric meaning. And then,
we repeat again, they will find, under the veil of more or less
transparent allegories, every statement made herein corroborated
by their own works. One or two instances have already been given
as regards the appearance of the Second Race, which is called
the &quot;Sweat-Born.&quot; This allegory is regarded as a fairy-tale,
and yet it conceals a psycho-physiological phenomenon, and one
of the greatest mysteries of Nature.
<P>
But in view of the chronological statements made herein, it is
natural to ask: --
<H4><STRONG>C</STRONG>OULD <STRONG>M</STRONG>EN <STRONG>E</STRONG>XIST
18,000,000<STRONG> Y</STRONG>EARS <STRONG>A</STRONG>GO?</H4>

<P>
To this Occultism answers in the affirmative, notwithstanding
all scientific objectors. Moreover, this duration covers only
the Vaivasvata-Manu <EM>Man, i.e., </EM>the male and female entity
already separated into<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 149 HOW OLD IS HUMANITY?</H6>

<P>
distinct sexes. The two and a half Races that preceded that event
may have lived 300,000,000 years ago for all that science can
tell. For the geological and physical difficulties in the way
of the theory could not exist for the <EM>primeval, ethereal </EM>man
of the Occult teachings. <EM>The whole issue of the quarrel between
the profane and the esoteric sciences depends upon the belief
in, and demonstration of, the existence of an astral body within
the physical, </EM>the former independent of the latter. Paul
d'Assier, the Positivist, seems to have proven the fact pretty
plainly,* not to speak of the accumulated testimony of the ages,
and that of the modern spiritualists and mystics. It will be found
difficult to reject this fact in our age of proofs, tests, and
ocular demonstrations.
<P>
The Secret Doctrine maintains that, notwithstanding the general
cataclysms and disturbances of our globe, which -- owing to its
being the period of its greatest physical development, for the
Fourth Round is the middle-point of the life allotted to it --
were far more terrible and intense than during any of the three
preceding Rounds (the cycles of its earlier psychic and spiritual
life and of its semi-ethereal conditions) physical Humanity has
existed upon it for the last 18,000,000 years.** This period was
preceded by 300,000,000 years of the mineral and vegetable development.
To this, all those who refuse to accept the theory of a &quot;boneless,&quot;
purely ethereal, man, will object. Science, which knows only of
<EM>physical</EM> organisms, will feel indignant; and materialistic
theology still more so. The first will object on logical and reasonable
grounds, based on the preconception that all animate organisms
have always existed on the same plane of materiality in all the
ages; the last on a tissue of most absurd fictions. The ridiculous
claim usually brought forward by theologians, is based on the
virtual assumption that mankind (read Christians) on this planet
have the honour of being the only human beings in the whole Kosmos,
who dwell on a globe, and that they are consequently, the best
of their kind.***

<P>
The Occultists, who believe firmly in the teachings of the mother-philosophy,
repel the objections of both theologians and scientists. They
maintain, on their side, that, during those periods when there
must have been insufferable heat, even at the two poles, successive
floods, upheaval of the valleys and constant shifting of the great
waters and seas, none of these circumstances could form an impediment
to human life and organization, such <EM>as is assigned by them
to the early mankind. </EM>Neither the heterogeneity of ambient
regions, full of deleterious gases, nor the perils of a crust
hardly consolidated, could prevent the First and Second Races
from making their appearance even during the Carboniferous, or
the Silurian age itself.
<P>
Thus the <EM>Monads </EM>destined to animate future Races were
ready for the new transformation. They had passed their phases
of immetalization, of plant and animal life, from the lowest to
the highest, and were waiting for their human, more intelligent
form. Yet, what could the plastic modellers do but follow the
laws of evolutionary Nature? Could they, as claimed by the Biblical
dead-letter, form &quot;Lord-God&quot;-like, or as Pygmalion in
the Greek allegory, Adam-Galatea out of volcanic dust, and breathe
a <EM>living soul </EM>into Man? No: because the soul was already
there, latent in its <EM>Monad, </EM>and needed but a <EM>coating.
</EM>Pygmalion, who fails to <EM>animate his statue, </EM>and
Bahak-Zivo of the Nazarean Gnostics, who fails to construct &quot;a
human soul in the creature,&quot; are, as conceptions, far more
philosophical and scientific than Adam, taken in the dead-letter
sense, or the Biblical Elohim-Creators. Esoteric philosophy, which
teaches spontaneous generation -- after the Sishta and Prajapati
have thrown the seed of life on the Earth -- shows the lower angels
able to <EM>construct physical </EM>man only, even with the help
of Nature, after having evolved the ethereal form out of themselves,
and leaving the physical form to evolve gradually from its ethereal,
or what would now be called, <EM>protoplasmic</EM> model.
<P>
This will again be objected to: &quot;Spontaneous Generation&quot;
is an exploded theory, we shall be told. Pasteur's experiments
disposed of it twenty years ago, and Professor Tyndall is against
it. Well, suppose he is? He ought to know that, should spontaneous

and dwelling of intelligent creatures endowed with will, subject
to law and capable of free-will; then, it would become extravagant
to think that our world should have been the subject of God's
favours and His special interference, of His communications and
His <EM>personal visit</EM>. . . . . . . Can the Earth presume
to be considered the centre of the moral and religious Universe,
he asks, if it has not the slightest distinction to rely upon
in the physical Universe? Is it not as absurd to uphold such an

<P>
be indeed proven impossible in our present world-period and actual
conditions -- which the Occultists deny -- still it would be no
demonstration that it could not have taken place under different
cosmic conditions, not only in the seas of the Laurentian period,
but even on the then convulsed Earth. It would be interesting
to know how Science could ever account for the appearance of species
and life on Earth, especially of <EM>Man, </EM>once that she rejects
both the Biblical teachings and spontaneous generation. Pasteur's
observations, however, are far from being perfect or proven. Blanchard
and Dr. Lutaud reject their importance and show that they have
none. The question is so far left <EM>sub judice, </EM>as well
as that other one &quot;when, at what period, life appeared on
the Earth?&quot; As to the idea that Haeckel's Moneron -- a pinch
of salt! -- has solved the problem of the origin of life, it is
simply absurd. Those materialists, who feel inclined to pooh-pooh
the theory of the &quot;Self-existent,&quot; the &quot;Self-born
heavenly man,&quot; represented as an ethereal, astral man, must
excuse even a tyro in Occultism laughing, in his turn, at some
speculations of modern thought. After proving most learnedly that
the primitive speck of <EM>protoplasm </EM>(moneron) is neither
animal nor plant, but both, and that it <EM>has no ancestors </EM>among
either of these, since it is that moneron which serves as a point
of departure for all organized existence, we are finally told
that <EM>the Monera are their own ancestors. </EM>This may be
very scientific, but it is very metaphysical also; too much so,
even for the Occultist.
<P>
If spontaneous generation has changed its methods now, owing perhaps
to accumulated material on hand, so as to almost escape detection,
it was in full swing in the genesis of terrestrial life. Even
the simple physical form and the evolution of species show how
Nature proceeds. The scale-bound, gigantic sauria, the winged
pterodactyl, the Megalosaurus, and the hundred-feet long Iguanodon
of the later period, are the transformations of the earliest representatives
of the animal kingdom found in the sediments of the primary epoch.
There was a time when all those above enumerated &quot;antediluvian&quot;
monsters appeared as filamentoid infusoria without shell or crust,
with neither nerves, muscles, organs nor sex, and reproduced their
kind by gemmation: as do microscopical animals also, the architects
and builders of our mountain ranges, agreeably to the teachings
of science. Why not man in this case? Why should he not have followed
the same law in his growth, <EM>i.e.</EM>, gradual condensation?
Every unprejudiced person would prefer to believe that primeval
humanity had at first an ethereal -- or, if so preferred, a huge
filamentoid, jelly-like form, evolved by gods or natural &quot;forces,&quot;
which grew, condensed throughout millions of ages, and became
gigantic in its physical impulse and tendency, until it settled
into the huge, physical form of the Fourth Race Man, -- rather
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 152 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
than believe him created of the dust of the Earth (<EM>literally</EM>),<EM>
</EM>or from some unknown anthropoid ancestor.
<P>
Nor does our esoteric theory clash with scientific data, except
on first appearance, as Dr. A. Wilson, <B>F.R.S</B>., says, in
a letter to &quot;<EM>Knowledge,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Dec.
</EM>23<EM>, </EM>1881). &quot;Evolution -- rather Nature, in
the light of evolution -- has only been studied for some <EM>twenty-five
years or so. </EM>That is, of course, a mere fractional space
in the history of human thought.&quot; And just because of that
we do not lose all hope that materialistic science will amend
its ways, and will gradually accept the esoteric teachings --
if even at first divorced from their (to science) too metaphysical
elements.
<P>
Has the last word on the subject of human evolution yet been said?
&quot;Each . . . . answer to the great Question (Man's Real Place
in Nature), invariably asserted by the followers of its propounder,
if not by himself, to be <EM>complete and final, </EM>remains
in high authority and esteem, <EM>it may</EM> <EM>be</EM> <EM>for
one century, </EM>it may be for twenty,&quot; writes Prof. Huxley;
&quot;but, as invariably, time proves each reply to have been
a <EM>mere approximation</EM> <EM>to the truth -- tolerable chiefly
on account of the ignorance of those by</EM> <EM>whom it was accepted,
and wholly intolerable when tested by the larger knowledge of
their successors</EM>&quot;! !<EM> </EM>Will this eminent Darwinian
admit the possibility of his <EM>pithecoid ancestry </EM>being
assignable to the list of &quot;wholly intolerable beliefs,&quot;
in the &quot;larger knowledge&quot; of Occultists? <EM>But whence
the savage? </EM>Mere &quot;rising to the civilized state&quot;
does not account for the evolution of form.
<P>
In the same letter, &quot;The Evolution of Man,&quot; Dr. Wilson
makes other strange confessions. Thus, he observes, in answer
to the queries put to &quot;<EM>Knowledge</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>by
&quot;G. M.&quot;: --
<P>
&quot; 'Has evolution effected any change in man? If so, what
change? If not, why not?' . . . If we refuse to admit (as science
does) that man was created a perfect being, and then became degraded,
there exists only another supposition -- that of evolution. If
man has arisen from a savage to a civilized state, that surely
is evolution. <EM>We do not yet know, because such knowledge is
difficult to acquire, if the human frame is subject to the same
influences as those of lower animals. </EM>But there is little
doubt that elevation from savagery to civilized life means and
implies 'evolution,' and that of considerable extent. Mentally,
man's evolution cannot be doubted; the ever-widening sphere of
thought has sprung from small and rude beginnings, like language
itself. But man's ways of life, his power of adaptation to his
surroundings, and countless other circumstances, have made the
facts and course of his 'evolution' very difficult to trace.&quot;
<P>
This very difficulty ought to make the Evolutionists more cautious
in their affirmations. But why is evolution <EM>impossible, </EM>if
&quot;man was created a perfect being, and then became degraded?&quot;
At best it can only apply<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 153 ARISTOTLE DENIED HELIOCENTRICISM.</H6>

<P>
to the <EM>outward, physical man. </EM>As remarked in &quot;<EM>Isis
Unveiled,</EM>&quot; Darwin's evolution begins at the middle point,
instead of commencing for man, as for everything else, from the
universals. The Aristotle-Baconian method may have its advantages,
but it has undeniably already demonstrated its defects. Pythagoras
and Plato, who proceeded from the Universals downwards, are now
shown more learned, in the light of modern science, than was Aristotle.
For he opposed and denounced the idea of the revolution of the
earth and even of its rotundity. &quot;Almost all those,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;who affirm that they have studied heaven in its
uniformity, claim that the earth is in the centre, but the philosophers
of the Italian School, otherwise called the Pythagoreans, teach
entirely the contrary. . . .&quot; Because (<EM>a</EM>) the Pythagoreans
were Initiates, and (<EM>b</EM>) they followed the deductive method.
Whereas, Aristotle, the father of the inductive system, complained
of those who taught that &quot;the centre of our system was occupied
by the Sun, and the earth was only a star, which by a rotatory
motion around the same centre, produces night and day&quot; (<EM>Vide
De Caelo, </EM>Book II., c. 13.) The same with regard to man.
The theory taught in the Secret Doctrine, and now expounded, is
the only one, which can -- without falling into the absurdity
of a &quot;miraculous&quot; man created out of the dust of the
Earth, or the still greater fallacy of man evolving from a pinch
of lime-salt, (the ex-protoplasmic moneron) -- account for his
appearance on Earth.
<P>
<EM>Analogy </EM>is the guiding law in Nature, the only true Ariadne's
thread that can lead us, through the inextricable paths of her
domain, toward her primal and final mysteries. Nature, as a creative
potency, is infinite, and no generation of physical scientists
can ever boast of having exhausted the list of her ways and methods,
however uniform the laws upon which she proceeds. If we can conceive
of a ball of Fire-mist becoming gradually -- as it rolls through
aeons of time in the interstellar spaces -- a planet, a self-luminous
globe, to settle into a <EM>man-bearing </EM>world or Earth, thus
having passed from a soft plastic body into a rock-bound globe;
and if we see on it everything evolving from the non-nucleated
jelly-speck that becomes the sarcode* of the <EM>moneron, </EM>then
passes from its <EM>protistic </EM>state** into the form of an
animal, to grow into a gigantic reptilian monster of the Mesozoic
times; then dwindles again into the (comparatively) dwarfish crocodile,

escape the general law? &quot;There were giants on earth in those
days,&quot; says <EM>Genesis, </EM>repeating the statement of
all the other Eastern Scriptures; and the <EM>Titans </EM>are
founded on anthropological and physiological fact.
<P>
And, as the hard-shelled crustacean was once upon a time a jelly-speck,
&quot;a thoroughly homogeneous particle of albumen in a firmly
adhesive condition,&quot; so was the outward covering of primitive
man, his early &quot;coat of skin,&quot; <EM>plus </EM>an immortal
spiritual monad, and a psychic temporary form and body within
that shell. The modern, hard, muscular man almost impervious to
any climate, was, perhaps, some 25,000,000 years ago, just what
the Haeckelian Moneron is, strictly &quot;an organism without
organs,&quot; an entirely homogeneous substance with a structureless
albumen body within, and a human form only outwardly.
<P>
No man of science has the right, in this century, to find the
figures of the Brahmins preposterous in the question of Chronology;
for their own calculations often exceed by far the claims made
by esoteric science. This may easily be shown.
<P>
Helmholtz calculated that the cooling of our Earth from a temperature
of 2,000 [[degrees]] to 200' Cent. must have occupied a period
of no less than 350,000,000 years. Western science (including
geology) seems generally to allow our globe an age of about 500,000,000
years altogether. Sir W. Thomson, however, limits the appearance
of the earliest vegetable life to 100,000,000 years ago -- a statement
respectfully contradicted by the archaic records. Speculations,
furthermore, vary daily in the domains of science. Meanwhile,
some geologists are very much opposed to such limitation. &quot;Volger
. . . . calculates, that the time requisite for the deposit of
the strata known to us must at least have amounted to 648 millions
of years . . . . &quot; Both time and space are infinite and eternal.
&quot;The Earth, as a material existence, is indeed infinite;
the changes only which it has undergone can be determined by finite
periods of time&quot; (<EM>Burmeister</EM>)<EM>. </EM>&quot;We
must therefore assume that the starry heaven is not merely in
space, what no astronomer doubts, but also in time, without beginning
or end; that it never was created, and is imperishable.&quot;
(See <EM>Czolbe</EM>)<EM>.**</EM>

Czolbe repeats exactly what the Occultists say. But the Aryan
Occultists, we may be told, knew nothing of these later speculations.

oppose the views of the Occultists in this direction. Except that
&quot;of man, the highest organic being of creation, not a trace
was found in the primary strata; only in the uppermost, the so-called
alluvial layer,&quot; is all that can be urged, so far. That man
was <EM>not the last member in the mammalian family, </EM>but
the first in <EM>this Round, </EM>is something that science will
be forced to acknowledge one day. A similar view also has already
been mooted in France on very high authority.
<P>
That man can be shown to have lived in the mid-Tertiary period,
and in a geological age <EM>when there did not yet exist one single
specimen of the now known species of mammals, </EM>is a statement
that science <EM>cannot </EM>deny and which has now been proven
by de Quatrefages.* But even supposing his existence in the Eocene
period is not yet demonstrated, what period of time has elapsed
since the Cretaceous period? We are aware of the fact that only
the boldest geologists dare to place man further back than the
Miocene age. But how long, we ask, is the duration of those ages
and periods since the Mesozoic time? On this, after a good deal
of speculation and wrangling, science is silent, the greatest
authorities upon the subject being compelled to answer to the
question: &quot;We do not know.&quot; This ought to show that
the men of science are no greater authorities in this matter than
are the profane. If, according to Prof. Huxley, &quot;the time
represented by the coal formation would be six millions of years,**
how many more millions would be required to cover

the time from the Jurassic period, or the middle of the so-called
&quot;Reptilian&quot; age (when the Third Race appeared), up to
the Miocene, when the bulk of the Fourth Race was submerged?*
<P>
The writer is well aware that those specialists, whose computations
of the ages of the globe and man are the most liberal, always
had the shyer majority against them. But this proves very little,
since the majority rarely, if ever, turns out to be right in the
long run. Harvey stood alone for many years. The advocates for
crossing the Atlantic with steamers were in danger of ending their
days in a lunatic asylum. Mesmer is classed to this day (in the
Encyclopaedias) along with Cagliostro, and St. Germain, as a charlatan
and impostor. And now that Messrs. Charcot and Richet have vindicated
Mesmer's claims, and that &quot;Mesmerism&quot; under its new
name of Hypnotism -- a false nose on a very old face -- is accepted
by science, it does not strengthen one's respect for that majority,
when one sees the ease and unconcern with which its members treat
of &quot;Hypnotism,&quot; &quot;Telepathic Impacts,&quot; and
its other phenomena. They speak of it, in short, as if they had
believed in it since the days of Solomon, and had never called
its votaries, only a few years ago, &quot;lunatics and impostors!&quot;**
<P>
The same revulsion of thought is in store for the long period
of years, claimed by esoteric philosophy as the age of sexual
and physiological mankind. Therefore even the Stanza which says:
--
<P>
&quot;The mind-born, the boneless, gave being to the will-born
with bones&quot;; adding that this took place in the middle of
the <EM>Third </EM>Race 18,000,000 years ago -- has yet a chance
of being accepted by future scientists.
<P>
As far as <B>XIX</B>th century thought is concerned, we shall
be told, even by some personal friends who are imbued with an
abnormal respect for the shifting conclusions of science, that
such a statement is absurd. How much more improbable will appear
our further assertion, to the effect that the antiquity of the
<EM>First </EM>Race dates back millions of years beyond this again.
For, although the exact figures are withheld, and it is out of
the question to refer the incipient evolution of the primeval

Since the days of Hume, whose researches culminated in a nihilistic
idealism, Psychology has gradually shifted its position to one
of crass <EM>materialism</EM>. Hume is regarded as a psychologist,
and yet he denied <EM>a priori </EM>the possibility of phenomena
in which millions now believe, including many men of science.
The Hylo-idealists of to-day are rank <EM>Annihilationists. </EM>The
schools of Spencer and Bain are respectively positivist and materialist,

</EM>it reminds one as little of the Vedantic teaching as the
pessimism of Schopenhauer and von Hartmann recalls the esoteric
philosophy, the heart and soul of true Buddhism.<HR>

<P>
Races with <EM>certainty </EM>to either the early Secondary, or
the Primary ages of geology, one thing is clear: that the figures
18,000,000 of years, which embrace the duration of <EM>sexual,
physical, </EM>man, have to be enormously increased if the whole
process of spiritual, astral and physical development is taken
into account. Many geologists, indeed, consider that the duration
of the Quaternary and Tertiary Ages demands the concession of
such an estimate; and it is quite certain that no terrestrial
conditions whatever negative the hypothesis of an Eocene Man,
if evidence for his reality is forthcoming. Occultists, who maintain
that the above date carries us far back into the secondary or
&quot;Reptilian&quot; age, may refer to M. de Quatrefages in support
of the possible existence of man in that remote antiquity. But
with regard to the earliest Root-Races the case is very different.
If the thick agglomeration of vapours, charged with carbonic acid,
that escaped from the soil or was held in suspension in the atmosphere
since the commencement of sedimentation, offered a fatal obstacle
to the life of human organisms as now known, how, it will be asked,
could the primeval men have existed? This consideration is, in
reality, out of court. Such terrestrial conditions as were then
operative had no touch with the plane on which the evolution of
the <EM>ethereal astral </EM>races proceeded. Only in relatively
recent geological periods, has the spiral course of cyclic law
swept mankind into the lowest grade of physical evolution -- the
plane of gross material causation. In those early ages, <EM>astral
</EM>evolution was alone in progress, and the two planes, the
astral and the physical,* though developing on parallel lines,
had no direct point of contact with one another. It is obvious
that a shadow-like <EM>ethereal </EM>man is related by virtue
of his organization -- if such it can be called -- only to that
plane from which the substance of his <EM>Upadhi </EM>is derived.
<P>
There are things, perhaps, that may have escaped the <EM>far-seeing
-- </EM>but not <EM>all-seeing -- </EM>eyes of our modern naturalists;
yet it is Nature herself who undertakes to furnish the missing
links. Agnostic speculative thinkers have to choose between the
version given by the Secret Doctrine of the East, and the hopelessly
materialistic Darwinian and Biblical accounts of the origin of
man; between no soul and no spiritual evolution, and the Occult
doctrine which repudiates &quot;Special creation&quot; and the
&quot;Evolutionist&quot; Anthropogenesis equally.
<P>
Again, to take up the question of &quot;Spontaneous generation&quot;;
life -- as science shows -- has not always reigned on this terrestrial
plane.

There was a time when even the Haeckelian Moneron -- that simple
globule of Protoplasm -- had not yet appeared at the bottom of
the seas. Whence came the <EM>Impulse </EM>which caused the molecules
of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, etc., to group themselves into the
<EM>Urschleim </EM>of Oken, that organic &quot;slime,&quot; now
christened protoplasm. What were the prototypes of the Monera?
They, at least, could not have fallen in meteorites from other
globes already formed, Sir W. Thomson's wild theory to this effect,
notwithstanding. And if <EM>they have </EM>so fallen; if our Earth
got its supply of life-germs from other planets; who, or <EM>what,
</EM>had carried them into those planets? Here, again, unless
the Occult teaching is accepted, we are compelled once more to
face a <EM>miracle; </EM>to accept the theory of a <EM>personal,
anthropomorphic Creator, </EM>the attributes and definitions of
whom, as formulated by the Monotheists, clash as much with philosophy
and logic, as they degrade the ideal of an infinite Universal
deity, before whose incomprehensible awful grandeur the highest
human intellect feels dwarfed. Let not the modern philosopher,
while arbitrarily placing himself on the highest pinnacle of human
intellectuality hitherto evolved, show himself spiritually and
intuitionally so far below the conceptions of even the ancient
Greeks, themselves on a far lower level, in these respects, than
the philosophers of Eastern Aryan antiquity. Hylozoism, when philosophically
understood, is the highest aspect of Pantheism. It is the only
possible escape from idiotic atheism based on lethal materiality,
and the still more idiotic anthropomorphic conceptions of the
monotheists; between which two it stands on its own entirely neutral
ground. Hylozoism <EM>demands </EM>absolute Divine Thought, which
would <EM>pervade </EM>the numberless active, creating Forces,
or &quot;Creators&quot;; which <EM>entities </EM>are moved by,
and have their being in, from, and through that Divine Thought;
the latter, nevertheless, having no more personal concern in them
or <EM>their </EM>creations, than the Sun has in the sun-flower
and its seeds, or in vegetation in general. Such active &quot;Creators&quot;
are known to exist and are believed in, because perceived and
sensed by the <EM>inner </EM>man in the Occultist. Thus the latter
says that an ABSOLUTE Deity, having to be unconditioned and unrelated,
cannot be thought of at the same time as an active, creating,
one living god, without immediate degradation of the ideal.* A
Deity that manifests in <EM>Space </EM>and <EM>Time -</EM>- these
two being simply the forms of THAT which is the Absolute ALL --
can be but a fractional part of the

* The conception and definition of the <EM>Absolute </EM>by Cardinal
Cusa may satisfy only the Western mind, prisoned, so unconsciously
to itself, and entirely degenerated by long centuries of scholastic
and theological sophistry. But this &quot;Recent philosophy of
the Absolute,&quot; traced by Sir W. Hamilton to Cusa, would never
satisfy the more acutely metaphysical mind of the Hindu Vedantin.

<P>
whole. And since that &quot;all&quot; cannot be divided in its
absoluteness, therefore that <EM>sensed </EM>creator (we say <EM>Creators</EM>)<EM>
</EM>can be at best but the mere <EM>aspect </EM>thereof. To use
the same metaphor -- inadequate to express the full idea, yet
well adapted to the case in hand -- these creators are like the
numerous rays of the solar orb, which remains unconscious of,
and unconcerned in, the work; while its mediating agents, the
rays, become the instrumental media every spring -- the Manvantaric
dawn of the Earth -- in fructifying and awakening the dormant
vitality inherent in Nature and its differentiated matter. This
was so well understood in antiquity, that even the moderately
religious Aristotle remarked that such work of direct creation
would be quite <EM>unbecoming </EM>to God -- [[<EM>aprepes toi
theo</EM>]]. Plato and other philosophers taught the same: deity
cannot set its own hand to creation, -- [[<EM>autournein hapanta</EM>]].
This Cudworth calls &quot;Hylozoism.&quot; As old Zeno is credited
by Laertius with having said, &quot;Nature is a habit moved from
itself, according to seminal principles; perfecting and containing
those several things which in determinate times are produced from
it, and acting agreeably to that from which it was secreted.&quot;*
<P>
Let us return to our subject, pausing to think over it. Indeed,
if there was vegetable life during those periods that could feed
on the then deleterious elements; and if there was even animal
life whose aquatic organization could be developed, notwithstanding
the supposed scarcity of Oxygen, why could there not be human
life also, in its incipient physical form,<EM> i.e</EM>., in a
race of beings adapted for that geological period and its surroundings?
Besides, science confesses that it knows nothing of the real length
of &quot;geological periods.&quot;
<P>
But the chief question before us is, whether it is quite certain
that, from the time of that which is called the &quot;Azoic&quot;
age, there ever was such an atmosphere as that hypothesised by
the Naturalists. Not all the physicists agree with this idea.
Were the writer anxious to corroborate the teachings of the Secret
Doctrine by exact science, it would be easy to show, on the admission
of more than one physicist, that the atmosphere has changed little,
if at all, since the first condensation of the oceans -- <EM>i.e.,
</EM>since the Laurentian period, the <EM>Pyrolithic </EM>age.
Such, at any rate, is the opinion of Blanchard, S. Meunier, and
even of Bischof -- as the experiments of the latter scientist
with basalts have shown. For were we to take the word of the majority
of scientists as to the quantity of deadly gases, and of elements
entirely saturated with carbon and nitrogen, in which the vegetable
and animal kingdoms are shown to have lived, thriven, and developed,
then one would have to come to the curious conclusion that there
were, in those days, oceans

of<EM> liquid carbonic acid, </EM>instead of water. With such
an element, it becomes doubtful whether the Ganoids, or even the
Primitive Trilobites themselves could live in the oceans of the
primary age -- let alone in those of the Silurian, as shown by
Blanchard.
<P>
The conditions that were necessary for the earliest race of mankind,
however, require no elements, whether simple or compound. That
which was stated at the beginning is maintained. The spiritual
ethereal Entity which lived in Spaces unknown to Earth, before
the first sidereal &quot;jelly-speck&quot; evolved in the ocean
of crude Cosmic Matter, -- billions and trillions of years before
our globular speck in infinity, called Earth, came into being
and generated the <EM>Moneron </EM>in its drops, called Oceans
-- needed no &quot;elements.&quot; The &quot;Manu with soft bones&quot;
could well dispense with calcic phosphate, as he had no bones,
save in a figurative sense. And while even the Monera, however
homogeneous their organism, still required physical conditions
of life that would help them toward further evolution, the being
which became primitive Man and the &quot;Father of man,&quot;
after evolving on planes of existence undreamt of by science,
could well remain impervious to any state of atmospheric conditions
around him. The primitive ancestor, in Brasseur de Bourbourg's
&quot;<EM>Popul-Vuh,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>who -- in the Mexican
legends -- could act and live with equal ease under ground and
water as upon the Earth, answers only to the Second and early
Third Races in our texts. And if the three kingdoms of Nature
were so different in <EM>pre</EM>-diluvian ages, why should not
man have been composed of materials and combinations of atoms
now entirely unknown to physical science? The plants and animals
now known, in almost numberless varieties and species, have all
developed, according to scientific hypotheses, from primitive
and far fewer organic forms. Why should not the same have occurred
in the case of man, the elements, and the rest? &quot;Universal
Genesis starts from the one, breaks into three, then five, and
finally culminates into seven, to return into four, three, and
one.&quot; (Commentary.)
