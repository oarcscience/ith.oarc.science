1. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>P</STRONG>RIMORDIAL <STRONG>S</STRONG>EVEN,
THE FIRST SEVEN <STRONG>B</STRONG>REATHS OF THE <STRONG>D</STRONG>RAGON
OF <STRONG>W</STRONG>ISDOM, PRODUCE IN THEIR TURN FROM THEIR HOLY
CIRCUMGYRATING <STRONG>B</STRONG>REATHS THE <STRONG>F</STRONG>IERY
<STRONG>W</STRONG>HIRLWIND (<EM>a</EM>).
<H4>COMMENTARY.</H4>

<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) This is, perhaps, the most difficult of all the Stanzas
to explain. Its language is comprehensible only to him who is
thoroughly versed in Eastern allegory and its purposely obscure
phraseology. The question will surely be asked, &quot;Do the Occultists
believe in all these 'Builders,' 'Lipika,' and 'Sons of Light'
as Entities, or are they merely imageries?&quot; To this the answer
is given as plainly: &quot;After due allowance for the imagery
of personified Powers, we must admit the existence of these Entities,
if we would not reject the existence of spiritual humanity within
physical mankind. For the hosts of these Sons of Light and 'Mind-born
Sons' of the first manifested Ray of the <STRONG>U</STRONG>NKNOWN
<STRONG>A</STRONG>LL, are the very root of spiritual man.&quot;
Unless we want to believe the unphilosophical dogma of a specially
created soul for every human birth -- a fresh supply of these
pouring in daily, since &quot;Adam&quot; -- we have to admit the
occult teachings. This will be explained in its place. Let us
see, now, what may be the occult meaning of this Stanza.
<P>
The Doctrine teaches that, in order to become a divine, fully
conscious god, -- aye, even the highest -- the Spiritual primeval
<STRONG>I</STRONG>NTELLIGENCES must pass through the human stage.
And when we say human, this does not apply merely to our terrestrial
humanity, but to the mortals that inhabit any world, <EM>i.e.</EM>,
to those Intelligences that have reached the appropriate equilibrium
between matter and spirit, as <I>we </I>have now, since the middle
point of the Fourth Root Race of the Fourth Round was passed.
Each Entity must have won for itself the right of becoming divine,
through self-experience. Hegel, the great German thinker, must
have known or sensed intuitionally this truth when saying, as
he did, that the Unconscious evolved the Universe only &quot;in
the hope of attaining clear self-consciousness,&quot; of becoming,
in other words, MAN; for this is also the secret meaning of the
usual Puranic phrase about<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 107 NO MAN -- NO GOD.</H6>

<P>
Brahma being constantly &quot;moved by the desire to create.&quot;
This explains also the hidden Kabalistic meaning of the saying:
&quot;The <EM>Breath </EM>becomes a stone; the stone, a plant;
the plant, an animal; the animal, a man; the man, a spirit; and
the spirit, a god.&quot; The Mind-born Sons, the Rishis, the Builders,
etc., were all men -- of whatever forms and shapes -- in other
worlds and the preceding Manvantaras.
<P>
This subject, being so very mystical, is therefore the most difficult
to explain in all its details and bearings; since the whole mystery
of evolutionary creation is contained in it. A sentence or two
in it vividly recalls to mind similar ones in the Kabala and the
phraseology of the King Psalmist (civ.), as both, when speaking
of God, show him making the wind his messenger and his &quot;ministers
a flaming fire.&quot; But in the Esoteric doctrine it is used
figuratively. The &quot;fiery Wind&quot; is the incandescent Cosmic
dust which only follows magnetically, as the iron filings follow
the magnet, the directing thought of the &quot;Creative Forces.&quot;
Yet, this cosmic dust is something more; for every atom in the
Universe has the potentiality of self-consciousness in it, and
is, like the Monads of Leibnitz, a Universe in itself, and <EM>for
</EM>itself.<EM> It is an atom and an angel.</EM> 
<P>
In this connection it should be noted that one of the luminaries
of the modern Evolutionist School, Mr. A. R. Wallace, when discussing
the inadequacy of &quot;natural selection&quot; as the sole factor
in the development of physical man, practically concedes the whole
point here discussed. He holds that the evolution of man was directed
and furthered by superior Intelligences, whose agency is a necessary
factor in the scheme of Nature. But once the operation of these
Intelligences is admitted in one place, it is only a logical deduction
to extend it still further. No hard and fast line can be drawn.

LIFTS HIS VOICE, AND CALLS THE INNUMERABLE SPARKS (<EM>atoms</EM>)<EM>
</EM>AND<EM> </EM>JOINS THEM TOGETHER (<EM>c</EM>).
<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) This shows the &quot;Primordial Seven&quot; using
for their <EM>Vahan </EM>(vehicle, or the manifested subject which
becomes the symbol of the Power directing it), Fohat, called in
consequence, the &quot;Messenger of their will&quot; -- the fiery
whirlwind.
<P>
&quot;Dzyu becomes Fohat&quot; -- the expression itself shows
it. Dzyu is the one real (magical) knowledge, or Occult Wisdom;
which, dealing with eternal truths and primal causes, becomes
almost omnipotence when applied in the right direction. Its antithesis
is Dzyu-mi, that which deals with illusions and false appearances
only, as in our exoteric modern sciences. In this case, Dzyu is
the expression of the collective Wisdom of the Dhyani-Buddhas.
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>)<EM> </EM>As the reader is supposed not to be acquainted
with the Dhyani-Buddhas, it is as well to say at once that, <EM>according
to the Orientalists</EM>,<EM> </EM>there are five Dhyanis who
are the &quot;celestial&quot; Buddhas, of whom the human Buddhas
are the manifestations in the world of form and matter. Esoterically,
however, the Dhyani-Buddhas are seven, of whom five only have
hitherto manifested,* and two are to come in the sixth and seventh
Root-races. They are, so to speak, the eternal prototypes of the
Buddhas who appear on this earth, each of whom has his particular
divine prototype. So, for instance, Amitabha is the Dhyani-Buddha
of Gautama Sakyamuni, manifesting through him whenever this great
Soul incarnates on earth as He did in Tzon-kha-pa.** As the synthesis
of the seven Dhyani-Buddhas, Avalokiteswara was the first Buddha
(the Logos), so Amitabha is the inner &quot;God&quot; of Gautama,
who, in China, is called Amita(-Buddha). They are, as Mr. Rhys
Davids

<P>
correctly states, &quot;the glorious counterparts in the mystic
world, free from the debasing conditions of this material life&quot;
of every earthly mortal Buddha -- the liberated Manushi-Buddhas
appointed to govern the Earth in this Round. They are the &quot;Buddhas
of Contemplation,&quot; and are all Anupadaka (parentless), <EM>i.e.</EM>,
self-born of divine essence. The exoteric teaching which says
that every Dhyani-Buddha has the faculty of creating from himself,
an equally celestial son -- a Dhyani-Bodhisattva -- who, after
the decease of the Manushi (human) Buddha, has to carry out the
work of the latter, rests on the fact that owing to the highest
initiation performed by one overshadowed by the &quot;Spirit of
Buddha&quot; -- (who is credited by the Orientalists with having
created the five Dhyani-Buddhas!), -- a candidate becomes virtually
a Bodhisattva, created such by the High Initiator.
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>) Fohat, being one of the most, if not the most important
character in esoteric Cosmogony, should be minutely described.
As in the oldest Grecian Cosmogony, differing widely from the
later mythology, Eros is the third person in the primeval trinity:
Chaos, Gaea, Eros: answering to the Kabalistic En-Soph (for Chaos
is SPACE, [[<EM><B>C</B>haino</EM>]], &quot;void&quot;) the Boundless
<STRONG>A</STRONG>LL, Shekinah and the Ancient of Days, or the
Holy Ghost; so Fohat is one thing in the yet unmanifested Universe
and another in the phenomenal and Cosmic World. In the latter,
he is that Occult, electric, vital power, which, under the Will
of the Creative Logos, unites and brings together all forms, giving
them the first impulse which becomes in time law. But in the unmanifested
Universe, Fohat is no more this, than Eros is the later brilliant
winged Cupid, or <STRONG>L</STRONG>OVE. Fohat has naught to do
with Kosmos yet, since Kosmos is not born, and the gods still
sleep in the bosom of &quot;Father-Mother.&quot; He is an abstract
philosophical idea. He produces nothing yet by himself; he is
simply that potential creative power in virtue of whose action
the <STRONG>N</STRONG>OUMENON of all future phenomena divides,
so to speak, but to reunite in a mystic supersensuous act, and
emit the creative ray. When the &quot;Divine Son&quot; breaks
forth, then Fohat becomes the propelling force, the active Power
which causes the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE to become <STRONG>T</STRONG>WO
and <STRONG>T</STRONG>HREE -- on the Cosmic plane of manifestation.
The triple One differentiates into the many, and then Fohat is
transformed into that force which brings together the elemental
atoms and makes them aggregate and combine. We find an echo of
this primeval teaching<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 110 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
in early Greek mythology. Erebos and Nux are born out of Chaos,
and, under the action of Eros, give birth in their turn to Ether
and Hemera, the light of the superior and the light of the inferior
or terrestrial regions. Darkness generates light. See in the Puranas
Brahma's &quot;Will&quot; or desire to create; and in the Phoenician
Cosmogony of Sanchoniathon the doctrine that Desire, [[<EM>pothos</EM>]],
is the principle of creation.
<P>
Fohat is closely related to the &quot;ONE LIFE.&quot; From the
Unknown One, the Infinite TOTALITY, the manifested ONE, or the
periodical, Manvantaric Deity, emanates; and this is the Universal
Mind, which, separated from its Fountain-Source, is the Demiurgos
or the creative Logos of the Western Kabalists, and the four-faced
Brahma of the Hindu religion. In its totality, viewed from the
standpoint of manifested Divine Thought in the esoteric doctrine,
it represents the Hosts of the higher creative Dhyan Chohans.
Simultaneously with the evolution of the Universal Mind, the concealed
Wisdom of Adi-Buddha -- the One Supreme and eternal -- manifests
itself as Avalokiteshwara (or manifested Iswara), which is the
Osiris of the Egyptians, the Ahura-Mazda of the Zoroastrians,
the Heavenly Man of the Hermetic philosopher, the Logos of the
Platonists, and the Atman of the Vedantins.* By the action of
the manifested Wisdom, or Mahat, represented by these innumerable
centres of spiritual Energy in the Kosmos, the reflection of the
Universal Mind, which is Cosmic Ideation and the intellectual
Force accompanying such ideation, becomes objectively the Fohat
of the Buddhist esoteric philosopher. Fohat, running along the
seven principles of <STRONG>A</STRONG>KASA, acts upon manifested
substance or the One Element, as declared above, and by differentiating
it into various centres of Energy, sets in motion the law of Cosmic
Evolution, which, in obedience to the Ideation of the Universal
Mind, brings into existence all the various states of being in
the manifested Solar System.
<P>
The Solar System, brought into existence by these agencies, consists
of Seven Principles, like everything else within these centres.
Such is the teaching of the trans-Himalayan Esotericism. Every
philosophy, however, has its own way of dividing these principles.

<P>
* Mr. Subba Row seems to identify him with, and to call him, the
<STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS. (See his four lectures on the &quot;Bhagavadgita&quot;
in the Theosophist.)<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 111 THE PROTEAN SPIRIT-SUBSTANCE.</H6>

<P>
Fohat, then, is the personified electric vital power, the transcendental
binding Unity of all Cosmic Energies, on the unseen as on the
manifested planes, the action of which resembles -- on an immense
scale -- that of a living Force created by WILL, in those phenomena
where the seemingly subjective acts on the seemingly objective
and propels it to action. Fohat is not only the living Symbol
and Container of that Force, but is looked upon by the Occultists
as an Entity -- the forces he acts upon being cosmic, human and
terrestrial, and exercising their influence on all those planes
respectively. On the earthly plane his influence is felt in the
magnetic and active force generated by the strong desire of the
magnetizer. On the Cosmic, it is present in the constructive power
that carries out, in the formation of things -- from the planetary
system down to the glow-worm and simple daisy -- the plan in the
mind of nature, or in the Divine Thought, with regard to the development
and growth of that special thing. He is, metaphysically, the objectivised
thought of the gods; the &quot;Word made flesh,&quot; on a lower
scale, and the messenger of Cosmic and human ideations: the active
force in Universal Life. In his secondary aspect, Fohat is the
Solar Energy, the electric vital fluid,* and the preserving fourth

* In 1882 the President of the Theosophical Society, Col. Olcott,
was taken to task for asserting in one of his lectures that Electricity
is matter. Such, nevertheless, is the teaching of the Occult Doctrine.
&quot;Force,&quot; &quot;Energy,&quot; may be a better name for
it, so long as European Science knows so little about its true
nature; yet matter it is, as much as Ether is matter, since it
is as atomic, though several removes from the latter. It seems
ridiculous to argue that because a thing is imponderable to Science,
therefore it cannot be called matter. Electricity is &quot;immaterial&quot;
in the sense that its molecules are not subject to perception
and experiment; yet it may be -- and Occultism says it is -- atomic;
therefore it is matter. But even supposing it were unscientific
to speak of it in such terms, once Electricity is called in Science
a source of Energy, Energy simply, and a Force -- where is that
Force or that Energy which can be thought of without thinking
of matter? Maxwell, a mathematician and one of the greatest authorities
upon Electricity and its phenomena, said, years ago, that Electricity
was matter, not motion merely. &quot;If we accept the hypothesis
that the elementary substances are composed of atoms we cannot
avoid concluding that electricity also, positive as well as negative,
is divided into definite elementary portions, which behave like
atoms of electricity.&quot; (Helmholtz, <EM>Faraday Lecture, </EM>1881).
We will go further than that, and assert that Electricity is not
only Substance but that it is an emanation from an Entity, which
is neither God nor Devil, but one of the numberless Entities that
rule and guide our world according to the eternal Law of <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA.
(See the Addendum to this Book.)<HR>

<P>
principle, the animal Soul of Nature, so to say, or -- Electricity.
In India, Fohat is connected with Vishnu and Surya in the early
character of the (first) God; for Vishnu is not a high god in
the Rig Veda. The name Vishnu is from the root <EM>vish</EM>,<EM>
</EM>&quot;to pervade,&quot; and Fohat is called the &quot;Pervader&quot;
and the Manufacturer, because he shapes the atoms from crude material.*
In the sacred texts of the Rig Veda, Vishnu, also, is &quot;a
manifestation of the Solar Energy,&quot; and he is described as
striding through the Seven regions of the Universe in three steps,
the Vedic God having little in common with the Vishnu of later
times. Therefore the two are identical in this particular feature,
and one is the copy of the other.
<P>
The &quot;three and seven&quot; strides refer to the Seven spheres
inhabited by man, of the esoteric Doctrine, as well as to the
Seven regions of the Earth. Notwithstanding the frequent objections
made by would-be Orientalists, the Seven Worlds or spheres of
our planetary chain are distinctly referred to in the exoteric
Hindu scriptures. But how strangely all these numbers are connected
with like numbers in other Cosmogonies and with their symbols,
can be seen from comparisons and parallelisms made by students
of old religions. The &quot;three strides of Vishnu&quot; through
the &quot;seven regions of the Universe,&quot; of the Rig Veda,
have been variously explained by commentators as meaning &quot;fire,
lightning and the Sun&quot; cosmically; and as having been taken
in the Earth, the atmosphere, and the sky; also as the &quot;three
steps&quot; of the dwarf (Vishnu's incarnation), though more philosophically
-- and in the astronomical sense, very correctly -- they are explained
by Aurnavabha as being the various positions of the sun, rising,
noon, and setting. Esoteric philosophy alone explains it clearly,
and the Zohar laid it down very philosophically and comprehensively.
It is said and plainly demonstrated therein that in the beginning
the Elohim (Elhim) were called Echod, &quot;one,&quot; or the
&quot;Deity is one in many,&quot; a very simple idea in a pantheistic
conception (in its philosophical sense, of course). Then came
the change, &quot;Jehovah is Elohim,&quot; thus unifying the multiplicity
and taking the first step towards Monotheism. Now to the query,
&quot;How is Jehovah Elohim?&quot; the answer is, &quot;By three
Steps&quot; from below.

vibration assumes a series of regular curved figures of various
descriptions. Can Science give a <EM>complete </EM>explanation
of this fact?<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 113 THE CORRELATION OF THE GODS.</H6>

<P>
The meaning is plain.* They are all symbols, and emblematic, mutually
and correlatively, of Spirit, Soul and Body (MAN); of the circle
transformed into Spirit, the Soul of the World, and its body (or
Earth). Stepping out of the Circle of Infinity, that no man comprehendeth,
Ain-Soph (the Kabalistic synonym for Parabrahm, for the Zeroana
Akerne, of the Mazdeans, or for any other &quot;<STRONG>U</STRONG>NKNOWABLE&quot;)
becomes &quot;One&quot; -- the <STRONG>E</STRONG>CHOD, the <STRONG>E</STRONG>KA,
the <STRONG>A</STRONG>HU -- then he (or it) is transformed by
evolution into the One in many, the Dhyani-Buddhas or the Elohim,
or again the Amshaspends, his third Step being taken into generation
of the flesh, or &quot;Man.&quot; And from man, or Jah-Hova, &quot;male
female,&quot; the <EM>inner </EM>divine entity becomes, on the
metaphysical plane, once more the Elohim.
<P>
The Kabalistic idea is identical with the Esotericism of the Archaic
period. This esotericism is the common property of all, and belongs
neither to the Aryan 5th Race, nor to any of its numerous Sub-races.
It cannot be claimed by the Turanians, so-called, the Egyptians,
Chinese, Chaldeans, nor any of the Seven divisions of the Fifth
Root Race, but really belongs to the Third and Fourth Root Races,
whose descendants we find in the Seed of the Fifth, the earliest
Aryans. The Circle was with every nation the symbol of the Unknown
-- &quot;Boundless Space,&quot; the abstract garb of an ever present
abstraction -- the Incognisable Deity. It represents limitless
Time in Eternity. The Zeroana Akerne is also the &quot;Boundless
Circle of the Unknown Time,&quot; from which Circle issues the
radiant light -- the Universal <STRONG>S</STRONG>UN, or Ormazd**
-- and the latter

* The numbers 3, 5, and 7 are prominent in speculative masonry,
as shown in &quot;Isis.&quot; A mason writes: -- &quot;There are
the 3, 5,<EM> </EM>and 7 steps to show a circular walk. The three
faces of 3, 3; 5,<EM> </EM>3; and 7, 3; etc., etc. Sometimes it
comes in this form -- 753/2 = 376.5 and 7635/2 = 3817.5 and the
ratio of 20612/6561 feet for cubit measure gives the Great Pyramid
measures,&quot; etc., etc. Three, five and seven are mystical
numbers, and the last and the first are as greatly honoured by
Masons as by the Parsis -- the triangle being a symbol of Deity
everywhere. (See the <EM>Masonic Cyclopedia</EM>, and<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Pythagorean
Triangle</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>Oliver.) As a matter of course,
doctors of divinity (Cassel, for instance) show the Zohar explaining
and supporting the Christian trinity (!). It is the latter, however,
that had its origin from the <IMG SRC="sd1-113.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
of the Heathen, in the Archaic Occultism and Symbology. The three
strides relate metaphysically to the descent of Spirit into matter,
of the Logos falling as a ray into the Spirit, then into the Soul,
and finally into the human physical form of man, in which it becomes
<STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE.

is identical with Kronos, in his AEolian form, that of a Circle.
For the circle is Sar, and Saros, or cycle, and was the Babylonian
god whose circular horizon was the visible symbol of the invisible,
while the sun was the ONE Circle from which proceeded the Cosmic
orbs, and of which he was considered the leader. Zero-ana, is
the Chakra or circle of Vishnu, the mysterious emblem which is,
according to the definition of a mystic, &quot;a curve of such
a nature that as to any, the least possible part thereof, if the
curve be protracted either way it will proceed and finally re-enter
upon itself, and form one and the same curve -- or that which
we call the circle.&quot; No better definition could thus be given
of the natural symbol and the evident nature of Deity, which having
its circumference everywhere (the boundless) has, therefore, its
central point also everywhere; in other words, is in every point
of the Universe. The invisible Deity is thus also the Dhyan Chohans,
or the Rishis, the primitive seven, and the nine, without, and
ten, including, their synthetical unit; from which IT steps into
Man. Returning to the Commentary (4) of Stanza IV. the reader
will understand why, while the trans-Himalayan Chakra has inscribed
within it <IMG SRC="sd1-113.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE"> | <IMG SRC="sd1-114a.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
| <IMG SRC="sd1-114b.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE"> (triangle, first line,
cube second line, and a pentacle with a dot in the centre thus:
<IMG SRC="sd1-114b.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">, and some other variations),
the Kabalistic circle of the Elohim reveals, when the letters
of the word <IMG SRC="sd1-144c.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE"> (Alhim or
Elohim) are numerically read, the famous numerals 13514, or by
anagram 31415 -- the astronomical <I> </I>(pi) number, or the
hidden meaning of Dhyani-Buddhas, of the Gebers, the Geborim,
the Kabeiri, and the Elohim, all signifying &quot;great men,&quot;
&quot;Titans,&quot; &quot;Heavenly Men,&quot; and, on earth, &quot;the
giants.&quot;
<P>
The Seven was a Sacred Number with every nation; but none applied
it to more physiologically materialistic uses than the Hebrews.
With these it was pre-eminently the generative number and 9 the
male causative one, forming as shown by the Kabalists the <IMG SRC="sd1-144d.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
or <EM>otz</EM> -- &quot;the Tree of the Garden of Eden,&quot;*
the &quot;double hermaphrodite rod&quot; of the fourth race. Whereas
with the Hindus and Aryans generally, the significance was manifold,
and related almost entirely to purely metaphysical

letter, symbolically an eye; the other a male letter, <EM>tza</EM>,

and astronomical truths.* Their Rishis and gods, their Demons
and Heroes, have historical and ethical meanings, and the Aryans
never made their religion rest solely on physiological symbols,
as the old Hebrews have done. This is found in the exoteric Hindu
Scriptures. That these accounts are blinds is shown by their contradicting
each other, a different construction being found in almost every
Purana and epic poem. Read esoterically -- they will all yield
the same meaning. Thus one account enumerates Seven worlds, exclusive
of the nether worlds, also seven in number; these fourteen upper
and nether worlds have

* We are told by a Kabalist, who in a work not yet published contrasts
the Kabala and Zohar with Aryan Esotericism, that &quot;The Hebrew
clear, short, terse and exact modes far and beyond measure surpass
the toddling word-talk of the Hindus -- just as by parallelisms
the Psalmist says, 'My mouth speaks with my tongue, I know not
thy numbers' (lxxi., 15). <EM>. </EM>. . The Hindu Glyph shows
by its insufficiency in the large admixture of adventitious sides
the same borrowed plumage that the Greeks (the lying Greeks) had,
and that Masonry has: which in the rough monosyllabic (and apparent)
poverty of the Hebrew, shows the latter to have come down from
a far more remote antiquity than any of these, and to have been
the source (!?), or nearer the old original source than any of
them.&quot; This is entirely erroneous. Our learned brother and
correspondent judges apparently the Hindu religious systems by
their Shastras and Puranas, probably the latter, and in their
modern translation moreover, which is disfigured out of all recognition,
by the Orientalists. It is to their philosophical systems that
one has to turn, to their esoteric teaching, if he would make
a point of comparison. No doubt the symbology of the Pentateuch
and even of the New Testament, comes from the same source. But
surely the Pyramid of Cheops, whose measurements are all found
repeated by Professor Piazzi Smythe in Solomon's alleged and mythical
temple, is not of a later date than the Mosaic books? Hence, if
there is any such great identity as claimed, it must be due to
servile copying on the part of the Jews, not on that of the Egyptians.
The Jewish glyphs -- and even their language, the Hebrew -- are
not original. They are borrowed from the Egyptians, from whom
Moses got his Wisdom; from the Coptic, the probable kinsman, if
not parent, of the old Phoenician and from the Hyksos, their (alleged)
ancestors, as Josephus shows in his &quot;<EM>Against Apion</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>I.<EM>, </EM>25. Aye; but who are the Hyksos shepherds? And
who the Egyptians? History knows nothing of the question, and
speculates and theorizes out of the depths of the respective consciousnesses
of her historians. (<EM>See Isis Unveiled</EM>,<EM> </EM>vol.

thus bearing witness to the primitive cognate unity of the Aryan
and Semitic races&quot;; and he places the great events in Egypt
9,000 years <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>. The fact is that in archaic
Esotericism and Aryan thought we find a grand philosophy, whereas
in the Hebrew records we find only the most surprising ingenuity
in inventing apotheoses for phallic worship and sexual theogony.

is there to ascertain the difference in that motion, since all
nature is reduced to its primal essence, and there can be no one

-- to see it?&quot; The answer to this is: &quot;Everything in
Nature has to be judged by analogy. Though the highest Deities
(Archangels or Dhyani-Buddhas) are unable to penetrate the mysteries
too far beyond our planetary system and the visible Kosmos, yet
there were great seers and prophets in olden times who were enabled
to perceive the mystery of Breath and Motion retrospectively,
when the systems of worlds were at rest and plunged in their periodic
sleep.&quot;<HR>

They are also called Rotae -- the moving wheels of the celestial
orbs participating in the world's creation -- when the meaning
refers to the animating principle of the stars and planets; for
in the Kabala, they are represented by the Ophanim, the Angels
of the Spheres and stars, of which they are the informing Souls.

This law of vortical movement in primordial matter, is one of
the oldest conceptions of Greek philosophy, whose first historical
Sages were nearly all Initiates of the Mysteries. The Greeks had
it from the Egyptians, and the latter from the Chaldeans, who
had been the pupils of Brahmins of the esoteric school. Leucippus,
and Democritus of Abdera -- the pupil of the Magi -- taught that
this gyratory movement of the atoms and spheres existed from eternity.*
Hicetas, Heraclides, Ecphantus, Pythagoras, and all his pupils,
taught the rotation of the earth; and Aryabhata of India, Aristarchus,
Seleucus, and Archimedes calculated its revolution as scientifically
as the astronomers do now; while the theory of the Elemental Vortices
was known to Anaxagoras, and maintained by him 500 years B.C.,
or nearly 2,000 before it was taken up by Galileo, Descartes,
Swedenborg, and finally, with slight modifications, by Sir W.
Thomson. (See his<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Vortical Atoms.</EM>&quot;)<EM>
</EM>All such knowledge, if justice be only done to it, is an
echo of the archaic doctrine, an attempt to explain which is now

*&quot;The doctrine of the rotation of the earth about an axis
is taught by the Pythagorean Hicetas, probably as early as 500
<STRONG>B.C</STRONG>. It was also taught by his pupil Ecphantus,
and by Heraclides, a pupil of Plato. The immobility of the Sun
and the orbital rotation of the earth were shown by Aristarchus
of Samos as early as 281 <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>. to be suppositions
accordant with facts of observation. The Heliocentric theory was
taught about 150 <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>., by Seleucus of Seleucia
on the Tigris. -- [It was taught 500 <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>. by
Pythagoras. -- <STRONG>H. P. B</STRONG>.] It is said also that
Archimedes, in a work entitled Psammites, inculcated the Heliocentric
theory. The sphericity of the earth was distinctly taught by Aristotle,
who appealed for proof to the figure of the Earth's shadow on
the moon in eclipses (Aristotle, De Coelo, lib. II, cap. XIV.).
The same idea was defended by Pliny (Nat. Hist., II., 65). These
views seem to have been lost from knowledge for more than a thousand
years. . . <EM>.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Comparative Geology</EM>,

by independent observation; others -- such as Copernicus, Swedenborg,

* That Swedenborg, who could not possibly have known anything
of the esoteric ideas of Buddhism, came independently near the
Occult teaching in his general conceptions, is shown by his essay
on the Vortical Theory. In Clissold's translation of it, quoted
by Prof. Winchell, we find the following <EM>resume</EM>: -- &quot;The
first Cause is the Infinite or Unlimited. This gives existence
to the First Finite or Limited.&quot; (The Logos in His manifestation
and the Universe.) &quot;That which produces a limit is analogous
to motion. (See first Stanza, <EM>supra</EM>.) The limit produced
is a point, the Essence of which is Motion; but being without
parts, this Essence is not actual Motion, but only a connatus
to it.&quot; (In our Doctrine it is not a &quot;connatus,&quot;
but a change from eternal vibration in the unmanifested, to Vortical
Motion in the phenomenal or manifested World). . . &quot;From
this first proceed Extension, Space, Figure, and Succession, or
Time. As in Geometry a point generates a line, a line a surface,
and a surface a solid, so here the connatus of a point tends towards
lines, surfaces and solids. In other words, the Universe is contained
<EM>in ovo </EM>in the first natural point . . . the Motion toward
which the connatus tends, is circular, since the circle is the
most perfect of all figures . . . The most perfect figure of a
Motion <EM>. . </EM>. must be the perpetually circular, that is
to say, it must proceed from the centre to the periphery and from
the periphery to the centre.&quot; (Quoted from <EM>Principia

the evolution of man's as well as Nature's principles; an evolution
which takes place gradually (as will be seen in Book II., on &quot;The
origin of the Human Races&quot;), as does everything else in nature.
The Sixth principle in Man (Buddhi, the Divine Soul) though a
mere breath, in our conceptions, is still something material when
compared with divine &quot;Spirit&quot; (Atma) of which it is
the carrier or vehicle. Fohat, in his capacity of <STRONG>D</STRONG>IVINE
<STRONG>L</STRONG>OVE (<EM>Eros</EM>), the electric Power of affinity
and sympathy, is shown allegorically as trying to bring the pure
Spirit, the Ray inseparable from the ONE absolute, into union
with the Soul, the two constituting in Man the <STRONG>M</STRONG>ONAD,
and in Nature the first link between the ever unconditioned and
the manifested. &quot;The first is now the second&quot; (world)

<P>
(<EM>b</EM>)<EM> </EM>The &quot;Army&quot; at each angle is the
Host of angelic Beings (Dhyan-Chohans) appointed to guide and
watch over each respective region from the beginning to the end
of Manvantara. They are the &quot;Mystic Watchers&quot; of the
Christian Kabalists and Alchemists, and relate, symbolically as
well as cosmogonically, to the numerical system of the Universe.
The numbers with which these celestial Beings are connected are
extremely difficult to explain, as each number refers to several
groups of distinct ideas, according to the particular group of
&quot;Angels&quot; which it is intended to represent. Herein lies
the <EM>nodus </EM>in the study of symbology, with which, unable
to untie by disentangling it, so many scholars have preferred
dealing as Alexander dealt with the Gordian knot; hence erroneous
conceptions and teachings, as a direct result.

The &quot;First is the Second,&quot; because the &quot;First&quot;
cannot really be numbered or regarded as the First, as that is
the realm of noumena in its primary manifestation: the threshold
to the World of Truth, or <STRONG>S</STRONG>AT, through which
the direct energy that radiates from the ONE REALITY -- the Nameless
Deity -- reaches us. Here again, the untranslateable term <STRONG>S</STRONG>AT

conception, since that which is manifested cannot be <STRONG>S</STRONG>AT,

coexistent with the One Life, &quot;Secondless,&quot; but as a
manifestation it is still a Maya -- like the rest. This &quot;World
of Truth&quot; can be described only in the words of the Commentary
as &quot;A bright star dropped from the heart of Eternity; the
beacon of hope on whose Seven Rays hang the Seven Worlds of Being.&quot;
Truly so; since those are the Seven Lights whose reflections are
the human immortal Monads -- the Atma, or the irradiating Spirit
of every creature of the human family. First, this septenary Light;
then: --
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>) The &quot;Divine World&quot; -- the countless Lights
lit at the primeval Light -- the Buddhis, or formless divine Souls,
of the last Arupa (formless) world; the &quot;Sum Total,&quot;

the Master is made to ask the pupil: --

lights above thee, burning in the dark midnight sky?</EM>&quot;
<P>
&quot;<EM>I sense one Flame, oh Gurudeva, I see countless undetached
sparks shining in it.</EM>&quot;
<P>
&quot;<EM>Thou sayest well. And now look around and into thyself.
That light which burns inside thee, dost thou feel it different
in anywise from the light that shines in thy Brother-men?</EM>&quot;

The radical unity of the ultimate essence of each constituent
part of compounds in Nature -- from Star to mineral Atom, from
the highest Dhyan Chohan to the smallest infusoria, in the fullest
acceptation of the term, and whether applied to the spiritual,
intellectual, or physical worlds -- this is the one fundamental
law in Occult Science. &quot;The Deity is boundless and infinite
expansion,&quot; says an Occult axiom; and hence, as remarked,
the name of Brahma.* There is a deep philosophy underlying the
earliest worship in the world, that of the Sun and of Fire. Of
all the Elements known to physical science, Fire is the one that
has ever eluded definite analysis. It is confidently asserted
that
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* In the Rig Veda we find the names <EM>Brahmanaspati </EM>and<EM>
Brihaspati </EM>alternating and equivalent to each other. Also
see &quot;Brihad Upanishad&quot;; Brihaspati is a deity called
&quot;the Father of the gods.&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 121 THE MYSTERY OF THE FIRE.</H6>

<P>
Air is a mixture containing the gases Oxygen and Nitrogen. We
view the Universe and the Earth as matter composed of definite
chemical molecules. We speak of the primitive ten Earths, endowing
each with a Greek or Latin name. We say that water is, chemically,
a compound of Oxygen and Hydrogen. But what is <STRONG>F</STRONG>IRE?
It is the effect of combustion, we are gravely answered. It is
heat and light and motion, and a correlation of physical and chemical
forces in general. And this scientific definition is philosophically
supplemented by the theological one in Webster's Dictionary, which
explains fire as &quot;the instrument of punishment, or the punishment
of the impenitent in another state&quot; -- the &quot;state,&quot;
by the bye, being supposed to be spiritual; but, alas! the presence
of fire would seem to be a convincing proof of its material nature.
Yet, speaking of the illusion of regarding phenomena as simple,
because they are familiar, Professor Bain says (<EM>Logic. </EM>Part
II.): &quot;Very familiar facts seem to stand in no need of explanation
themselves and to be the means of explaining whatever can be assimilated
to them. Thus, the boiling and evaporation of a liquid is supposed
to be a very simple phenomenon requiring no explanation, and a
satisfactory explanation of rarer phenomena. That water should
dry up is, to the uninstructed mind, a thing wholly intelligible;
whereas to the man acquainted with physical science the liquid
state is anomalous and inexplicable. The lighting of a fire by
a flame is a GREAT SCIENTIFIC DIFFICULTY, yet few people think
so&quot; (p. 125).
<P>
What says the esoteric teaching with regard to fire? &quot;Fire,&quot;
it says, &quot;is the most perfect and unadulterated reflection,
in Heaven as on Earth, of the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE <STRONG>F</STRONG>LAME.
It is Life and Death, the origin and the end of every material
thing. It is divine '<STRONG>S</STRONG>UBSTANCE.' &quot; Thus,
not only the <STRONG>F</STRONG>IRE-<STRONG>W</STRONG>ORSHIPPER,
the Parsee, but even the wandering savage tribes of America, which
proclaim themselves &quot;born of fire,&quot; show more science
in their creeds and truth in their superstitions, than all the
speculations of modern physics and learning. The Christian who
says: &quot;God is a living Fire,&quot; and speaks of the Pentecostal
&quot;Tongues of Fire&quot; and of the &quot;burning bush&quot;
of Moses, is as much a fire-worshipper as any other &quot;heathen.&quot;
The Rosicrucians, among all the mystics and Kabalists, were those
who defined Fire in the right and most correct way. Procure a
sixpenny lamp, keep it only supplied with oil, and you will be
able to light at its flame the lamps, candles,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 122 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
and fires of the whole globe without diminishing that flame. If
the Deity, the radical One, is eternal and an infinite substance
(&quot;the Lord thy God is a consuming fire&quot;) and never consumed,
then it does not seem reasonable that the Occult teaching should
be held as unphilosophical when it says: &quot;Thus were the Arupa
and Rupa worlds formed: from <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE light seven
lights; from each of the seven, seven times seven,&quot; etc.,

in the esoteric calculation, of seven principles -- three rays

East and West, Forces having each a distinct occult property.
These BEINGS are also connected with Karma, as the latter needs
physical and material agents to carry out her decrees, such as
the four kinds of winds, for instance, professedly admitted by
Science to have their respective evil and beneficent influences
upon the health of Mankind and every living thing. There is occult
philosophy in that Roman Catholic doctrine which traces the various
public calamities, such as epidemics of disease, and wars, and
so on, to the invisible &quot;Messengers&quot; from North and
West. &quot;The glory of God comes from the way of the East&quot;
says Ezekiel; while Jeremiah, Isaiah, and the Psalmist assure
their readers that all the evil under the Sun comes from the North
and the West -- which proposition, when applied to the Jewish
nation, sounds like an undeniable prophecy for themselves. And
this accounts also for St. Ambrose (On Amos, ch. iv.) declaring
that it is precisely for that reason that &quot;we curse the North-Wind,
and that during the ceremony of baptism we begin by turning towards
the West (Sidereal), to renounce the better him who inhabits it;
after which we turn to the East.&quot;
<P>
Belief in the &quot;Four Maharajahs&quot; -- the Regents of the
Four cardinal points -- was universal and is now that of Christians,*
who call them, after St. Augustine, &quot;Angelic Virtues,&quot;
and &quot;Spirits&quot; when enumerated by themselves, and &quot;Devils&quot;
when named by Pagans. But where is the difference between the
Pagans and the Christians in this cause? Following Plato, Aristotle
explained that the term [[<EM>stoicheia</EM>]] was understood
only as meaning the incorporeal principles placed at each of the
four great divisions of our Cosmical world to supervise them.
Thus, no more than the Christians did, do they <EM>adore </EM>and<EM>
worship </EM>the Elements and the cardinal (imaginary) points,
but the &quot;gods&quot; that ruled these respectively. For the
Church there are two kinds of Sidereal beings, the

* Says the scholarly Vossius, in his Theol. Cir. I. VII.: &quot;Though
St. Augustine has said that every visible thing in this world
had an angelic virtue as an overseer near it, it is not individuals
but entire species of things that must be understood, each such
species having indeed its particular angel to watch it. He is
at one in this with all the philosophers . . . For us these angels
are spirits separated from the objects . . . whereas for the philosophers
(pagan) they were gods.&quot; Considering the Ritual established
by the Roman Catholic Church for &quot;Spirits of the Stars,&quot;
the latter look suspiciously like &quot;Gods,&quot; and were no
more honoured and prayed to by the ancient and modern pagan rabble
than they are now at Rome by the highly cultured Catholic Christians.

Angels and the Devils. For the Kabalist and Occultist there is
but one; and neither of them makes any difference between &quot;the
Rectors of Light&quot; and the Cosmocratores, or &quot;Rectores
tenebrarum harum,&quot; whom the Roman Church imagines and discovers
in a &quot;Rector of Light&quot; as soon as he is called by another
name than the one she addresses him by. It is not the &quot;Rector&quot;
or &quot;Maharajah&quot; who punishes or rewards, with or without
&quot;God's&quot; permission or order, but man himself -- his
deeds or Karma, attracting individually and collectively (as in
the case of whole nations sometimes), every kind of evil and calamity.
We produce CAUSES, and these awaken the corresponding powers in
the sidereal world; which powers are magnetically and irresistibly
attracted to -- and react upon -- those who produced these causes;
whether such persons are practically the evil-doers, or simply
Thinkers who brood mischief. Thought is matter,* we are taught
by modern Science; and &quot;every particle of the existing matter
must be a register of all that has happened,&quot; as in their
&quot;<EM>Principles of Science</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Messrs. Jevons
and Babbage tell the profane. Modern Science is drawn more every
day into the maelstrom of Occultism; unconsciously, no doubt,
still very sensibly. The two main theories of science -- <EM>re</EM>
the relations between Mind and Matter -- are Monism and Materialism.
These two cover the whole ground of negative psychology with the
exception of the quasi-occult views of the pantheistic German
schools.**
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Not of course in the sense of the German Materialist Moleschott,
who assures us that &quot;Thought is the movement of matter,&quot;
a statement of almost unequalled absurdity. Mental states and
bodily states are utterly contrasted as such. But that does not
affect the position that every thought, in addition to its physical
accompaniment (brain-change), exhibits an objective -- though
to us supersensuously objective -- aspect on the astral plane.
(See &quot;The Occult World,&quot; pp. 89, 90.)
<P>
** The views of our present-day scientific thinkers as to the
relations between mind and matter may be reduced to two hypotheses.
These show that both views equally exclude the possibility of
an independent Soul, distinct from the physical brain through
which it functions. They are: --
<P>
(1.) <STRONG>M</STRONG>ATERIALISM, the theory which regards mental
phenomena as the product of molecular change in the brain; <EM>i.e.</EM>,
as the outcome of a transformation of motion into feeling (!).
The cruder school once went so far as to identify mind with a
&quot;peculiar mode of motion&quot; (!!), but this view is now
happily regarded as absurd by most of the men of science themselves.

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 125 THE REAL MEANING OF THE TABERNACLE.</H6>

<P>
In the Egyptian temples, according to Clemens Alexandrinus, an
immense curtain separated the tabernacle from the place for the
congregation. The Jews had the same. In both, the curtain was
drawn over five pillars (the Pentacle) symbolising our five senses
and five Root-races esoterically, while the four colours of the
curtain represented the four cardinal points and the four terrestrial
elements. The whole was an allegorical symbol. It is through the
four high Rulers over the four points and Elements that our five
senses may become cognisant of the hidden truths of Nature; and
not at all, as Clemens would have it, that it is the elements
<EM>per se </EM>that furnished the Pagans with divine Knowledge
or the knowledge of God.* While the Egyptian emblem was spiritual,
that of the Jews was purely materialistic, and, indeed, honoured
only the blind Elements and the imaginary &quot;Points.&quot;
For what was the meaning of the square tabernacle raised by Moses
in the wilderness, if it had not the same cosmical significance?
&quot;Thou shalt make an hanging . . . of blue, purple, and scarlet&quot;
and &quot;five pillars of shittim wood for the hanging . . . four

ch. xxvi., xxvii.) The Tabernacle and the square courtyard, Cherubim
and all, were precisely the same as those in the Egyptian temples.
The square form of the Tabernacle meant just the same thing as
it still means, to this day, in the exoteric worship of the Chinese
and Tibetans -- the four cardinal points signifying that which
the four sides of the pyramids, obelisks, and other such square
erections mean. Josephus takes care to explain the whole thing.
He declares that the Tabernacle pillars are the same

doctrine, which commands a very wide assent, counting among its
upholders such men as Lewis, Spencer, Ferrier, and others, while
positing thought and mental phenomena generally as radically contrasted
with matter, regards both as equal to the two sides, or aspects,
of one and the same substance in some of its conditions. Thought
as thought, they say, is utterly contrasted with material phenomena,

on pedestals whose four angles faced the four cardinal points:
adding that &quot;the angles of the pedestals had equally the
four figures of the Zodiac&quot; on them, which represented the
same orientation (<EM>Antiquities I., </EM>VIII., ch. xxii.).
<P>
The idea may be traced in the Zoroastrian caves, in the rock-cut
temples of India, as in all the sacred square buildings of antiquity
that have survived to this day. This is shown definitely by Layard,
who finds the four cardinal points, and the four primitive elements,
in the religion of every country, under the shape of square obelisks,
the four sides of the pyramids, etc., etc. Of these elements and
their points the four Maharajahs were the regents and the directors.
<P>
If the student would know more of them, he has but to compare
the Vision of Ezekiel (chap. i.) with what is known of Chinese
Buddhism (even in its exoteric teachings); and examine the outward
shape of these &quot;Great Kings.&quot; In the opinion of the
Rev. Joseph Edkins, they are &quot;the Devas who preside each
over one of the four continents into which the Hindus divide the
world.&quot;* Each leads an army of spiritual beings to protect
mankind and Buddhism. With the exception of favouritism towards
Buddhism, the four celestial beings are precisely this. They are
the protectors of mankind and also the Agents of Karma on Earth,
whereas the Lipika are concerned with Humanity's hereafter. At
the same time they are the four living creatures &quot;who have
the likeness of a man&quot; of Ezekiel's visions, called by the
translators of the Bible, &quot;Cherubim,&quot; &quot;Seraphim,&quot;
etc.; and by the Occultists, &quot;the winged Globes,&quot; the
&quot;Fiery Wheels,&quot; and in the Hindu Pantheon by a number
of different names. All these Gandharvas, the &quot;Sweet Songsters,&quot;
the Asuras, Kinnaras, and Nagas, are the allegorical descriptions
of the &quot;four Maharajahs.&quot; The Seraphim are the fiery
Serpents of Heaven which we find in a passage describing Mount
Meru as: &quot;the exalted mass of glory, the venerable haunt
of gods and heavenly choristers . . . . not to be reached by sinful
men . . . . because guarded by Serpents.&quot; They are called
the Avengers, and the &quot;Winged Wheels.&quot;

*The Hindus happen to divide the world into seven continents,

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 127 THE DRAGONS OF SECRET WISDOM.</H6>

<P>
Christian Bible-interpreters say of the Cherubim: -- &quot;The
word signifies in Hebrew, fullness of knowledge; these angels
are so called from their exquisite Knowledge, and were therefore
used for the punishment of men who affected divine Knowledge.&quot;
(Interpreted by Cruden in his Concordance, from Genesis iii.,
24.) Very well; and vague as the information is, it shows that
the Cherub placed at the gate of the garden of Eden after the
&quot;Fall,&quot; suggested to the venerable Interpreters the
idea of punishment connected with forbidden Science or divine
Knowledge -- one that generally leads to another &quot;Fall,&quot;
that of the gods, or &quot;God,&quot; in man's estimation. But
as the good old Cruden knew nought of Karma, he may be forgiven.
Yet the allegory is suggestive. From Meru, the abode of gods,
to Eden, the distance is very small, and from the Hindu Serpents
to the Ophite Cherubim, the third out of the seven of which was
the Dragon, the separation is still smaller, for both watched
the entrance to the realm of Secret Knowledge. But Ezekiel plainly
describes the four Cosmic Angels: &quot;I looked, and behold,
a whirlwind, a cloud and fire infolding it . . . also out of the
midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures . . .
they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces and
four wings . . . the face of a man, and the face of a lion, the
face of an ox, and the face of an eagle . . . &quot; (&quot;Man&quot;
was here substituted for &quot;Dragon.&quot; Compare the &quot;<EM>Ophite
Spirits.</EM>&quot;<EM>*</EM>) . . . &quot;Now as I beheld the
living creatures behold one wheel upon the Earth with his four
faces . . . as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel . . .
for the support of the living creature was in the wheel . . .
their appearance was like coals of fire . . .&quot; etc. (Ezekiel,
ch. i.)

There are three chief groups of Builders and as many of the Planetary
Spirits and the Lipika, each group being again divided into Seven
sub-groups. It is impossible, even in such a large work as this,
to enter into a minute examination of even the three principal
groups, as it would demand an extra volume. The &quot;Builders&quot;
are the representatives of the first &quot;Mind-Born&quot; Entities,
therefore of the primeval Rishi-Prajapati: also of the Seven great
Gods of Egypt, of which Osiris is the chief: of the Seven Amshaspends
of the Zoroastrians, with

* The Angels recognised by the Roman Catholic Church who correspond
to these &quot;Faces&quot; were with the Ophites: -- Dragon --

Ormazd at their head: or the &quot;Seven Spirits of the Face&quot;:
the Seven Sephiroth separated from the first Triad, etc., etc.*
<P>
They build or rather rebuild every &quot;System&quot; after the
&quot;Night.&quot; The Second group of the Builders is the Architect
of our planetary chain exclusively; and the third, the progenitor
of our Humanity -- the Macrocosmic prototype of the microcosm.
<P>
The Planetary Spirits are the informing spirits of the Stars in
general, and of the Planets especially. They rule the destinies
of men who are all born under one or other of their constellations;
the second and third groups pertaining to other systems have the
same functions, and all rule various departments in Nature. In
the Hindu exoteric Pantheon they are the guardian deities who
preside over the eight points of the compass -- the four cardinal
and the four intermediate points -- and are called <EM>Loka-Palas</EM>,
&quot;Supporters or guardians of the World&quot; (in our visible
Kosmos), of which Indra (East), Yama (South), Varuna (West), and
Kuvera (North) are the chief; their elephants and their spouses
pertaining of course to fancy and afterthought, though all of
them have an occult significance.
<P>
The Lipika (a description of whom is given in the Commentary on
Stanza <STRONG>IV</STRONG>. No. 6) are the Spirits of the Universe,
whereas the Builders are only our own planetary deities. The former
belong to the most occult portion of Cosmogenesis, which cannot
be given here. Whether the Adepts (even the highest) know this
angelic order in the completeness of its triple degrees, or only
the lower one connected with the records of our world, is something
which the writer is unprepared to say, and she would incline rather
to the latter supposition. Of its highest grade one thing only
is taught: the Lipika are connected with Karma -- being its direct
Recorders.**

* The Jews, save the Kabalists, having no names for East, West,
South, and North, expressed the idea by words signifying before,
behind, right and left, and very often confounded the terms exoterically,
thus making the blinds in the Bible more confused and difficult
to interpret. Add to this the fact that out of the forty-seven
translators of King James I. of England's Bible &quot;only three
understood Hebrew, and of these two died before the Psalms were
translated&quot; (<EM>Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia</EM>),<EM> </EM>and

The Stanza proceeds with a minute classification of the Orders
of Angelic Hierarchy. From the group of Four and Seven emanates
the &quot;mind-born&quot; group of Ten, of Twelve, of Twenty-one,
etc., all these divided again into sub-groups of septenaries,
novenaries, duodecimals, and so on, until the mind is lost in
this endless enumeration of celestial hosts and Beings, each having
its distinct task in the ruling of the visible Kosmos during its
existence.
<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) The esoteric meaning of the first sentence of the
Sloka is, that those who have been called Lipikas, the Recorders
of the Karmic ledger, make an impassible barrier between the personal
<STRONG>E</STRONG>GO and the impersonal <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF,
the Noumenon and Parent-Source of the former. Hence the allegory.
They circumscribe the manifested world of matter within the <STRONG>R</STRONG>ING
&quot;Pass-Not.&quot; This world is the symbol (objective) of
the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE divided into the many, on the planes
of Illusion, of Adi (the &quot;First&quot;) or of Eka (the &quot;One&quot;);
and this One is the collective aggregate, or totality, of the
principal Creators or Architects of this visible universe. In
Hebrew Occultism their name is both Achath, feminine, &quot;One,&quot;
and Achod, &quot;One&quot; again, but masculine. The monotheists
have taken (and are still taking) advantage of the profound esotericism
of the Kabala to apply the name by which the One Supreme Essence
is known to ITS manifestation, the Sephiroth-Elohim, and call
it Jehovah. But this is

quite arbitrary and against all reason and logic, as the term
Elohim is a plural noun, identical with the plural word <EM>Chiim,
</EM>often compounded with the Elohim.* Moreover, in Occult metaphysics
there are, properly speaking, two &quot;<STRONG>O</STRONG>NES&quot;
-- the One on the unreachable plane of Absoluteness and Infinity,
on which no speculation is possible, and the Second &quot;One&quot;
on the plane of Emanations. The former can neither emanate nor
be divided, as it is eternal, absolute, and immutable. The Second,
being, so to speak, the reflection of the first One (for it is
the Logos, or Iswara, in the Universe of Illusion), can do all
this.** It emanates from itself -- as the upper Sephirothal Triad
emanates the lower seven Sephiroth -- the seven Rays or Dhyan
Chohans; in other words, the Homogeneous becomes the Heterogeneous,
the &quot;Protyle&quot; differentiates into the Elements. But
these, unless they return into their primal Element, can never
cross beyond the Laya, or zero-point.
<P>
Hence the allegory. The Lipika separate the world (or plane) of
pure spirit from that of Matter. Those who &quot;descend and ascend&quot;
-- the incarnating Monads, and men striving towards purification
and &quot;ascending,&quot; but still not having quite reached
the goal -- may cross the &quot;circle of the Pass-Not,&quot;
only on the day &quot;Be-With-Us&quot;; that day when man, freeing
himself from the trammels of ignorance, and recog-

* The sentence in the Sepher Jezirah and elsewhere: &quot;Achath-Ruach-Elohim-Chiim&quot;
denotes the Elohim as androgynous at best, the feminine element
almost predominating, as it would read: &quot;<STRONG>O</STRONG>NE
is She the Spirit of the Elohim of Life.&quot; As said above,
Echath (or Achath) is feminine, and Echod (or Achod) masculine,
both meaning <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE.
<P>
** This metaphysical tenet can hardly be better described than
Mr. Subba Row's in &quot;Bhagavadgita&quot; lectures: &quot;Mulaprakriti
(the veil of Parabrahmam) acts as the one energy through the Logos
(or 'Eswara'). Now Parabrahmam, is the one essence from which
starts into existence a centre of energy, which I shall for the
present call the Logos. . . . It is called the Verbum . . . by
the Christians, and it is the divine Christos who is eternal in
the bosom of his father. It is called Avalokiteshwara by the Buddhists.
. . . In almost every doctrine, they have formulated the existence
of a centre of spiritual energy which is unborn and eternal, and
which exists in the bosom of Parabrahmam at the time of Pralaya,
and starts as a centre of conscious energy at the time of Cosmic
activity. . . .&quot; For, as the lecturer premised by saying,
Parabraham is not this or that, it is not even consciousness,
as it cannot be related to matter or anything conditioned. It
is not Ego nor is it Non-ego, not even Atma, but verily the one
source of all manifestations and modes of existence.<HR>

<P>
nising fully the non-separateness of the Ego within his personality
-- erroneously regarded as his own -- from the <STRONG>U</STRONG>NIVERSAL
<STRONG>E</STRONG>GO (Anima Supra-Mundi), merges thereby into
the One Essence to become not only one &quot;with us&quot; (the
manifested universal lives which are &quot;ONE&quot; LIFE), but
that very life itself.
<P>
Astronomically, the &quot;Ring <STRONG>P</STRONG>ASS-<STRONG>N</STRONG>OT&quot;
that the Lipika trace around the Triangle, the First One, the
Cube, the Second One, and the Pentacle to circumscribe these figures,
is thus shown to contain the symbol of 31415 again, or the coefficient
constantly used in mathematical tables (the value of <I>, </I>pi),
the geometrical figures standing here for numerical figures. According
to the general philosophical teachings, this ring is beyond the
region of what are called nebulae in astronomy. But this is as
erroneous a conception as that of the topography and the descriptions,
given in Puranic and other exoteric Scriptures, about the 1008
worlds of the Devaloka worlds and firmaments. There are worlds,
of course, in the esoteric as well as in the profane scientific
teachings, at such incalculable distances that the light of the
nearest of them which has just reached our modern Chaldees, had
left its luminary long before the day on which the words &quot;Let
there be Light&quot; were pronounced; but these are no worlds
on the Devaloka plane, but in our Kosmos.
<P>
The chemist goes to the <EM>laya </EM>or zero point of the plane
of matter with which he deals, and then stops short. The physicist
or the astronomer counts by billions of miles beyond the nebulae,
and then they also stop short; the semi-initiated Occultist will
represent this laya-point to himself as existing on some plane
which, if not physical, is still conceivable to the human intellect.
But the full Initiate <EM>knows </EM>that the ring &quot;Pass-Not&quot;
is neither a locality nor can it be measured by distance, but
that it exists in the absoluteness of infinity. In this &quot;Infinity&quot;
of the full Initiate there is neither height, breadth nor thickness,
but all is fathomless profundity, reaching down from the physical
to the &quot;para-para-metaphysical.&quot; In using the word &quot;down,&quot;
essential depth -- &quot;nowhere and everywhere&quot; -- is meant,
not depth of physical matter.
<P>
If one searches carefully through the exoteric and grossly anthropomorphic
allegories of popular religions, even in these the doctrine embodied
in the circle of &quot;Pass-Not&quot; thus guarded by the Lipika,
may be dimly perceived. Thus one finds it even in the teachings
of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 132 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
the Vedantin sect of the Visishtadwaita, the most tenaciously
anthropomorphic in all India. For we read of the released soul
that: --
<P>
After reaching Moksha (a state of bliss meaning &quot;release
from Bandha&quot; or bondage), bliss is enjoyed by it in a place
called <STRONG>P</STRONG>ARAMAPADHA, which place is not material,
but made of Suddasatwa (the essence, of which the body of Iswara
-- &quot;the Lord&quot; -- is formed). There, Muktas or Jivatmas
(Monads) who have attained Moksha, are never again subject to
the qualities of either matter or Karma. &quot;But if they choose,
<EM>for the sake of doing good to the world</EM>, they may incarnate
on Earth.&quot;* The way to Paramapadha, or the immaterial worlds,
from this world, is called Devayana. When a person has attained
Moksha and the body dies: --
<P>
&quot;The Jiva (Soul) goes with Sukshma Sarira** from the heart
of the body, to the Brahmarandra in the crown of the head, traversing
Sushumna, a nerve connecting the heart with the Brahmarandra.
The Jiva breaks through the Brahmarandra and goes to the region
of the Sun (Suryamandala) through the solar Rays. Then it goes,
through a dark spot in the Sun, to Paramapadha. The Jiva is directed
on its way by the Supreme Wisdom acquired by Yoga.*** The Jiva
thus proceeds to Paramapadha by the aid of Athivahikas (bearers
in transit), known by the names of Archi-Ahas . . . Aditya, Prajapati,
etc. The Archis here mentioned are certain pure Souls, etc., etc.&quot;
(Visishtadwaita Catechism, by Pundit Bhashyacharya, <STRONG>F.T.S</STRONG>.)
<P>
No Spirit except the &quot;Recorders&quot; (Lipika) has ever crossed
its forbidden line, nor will any do so until the day of the next
Pralaya, for it is the boundary that separates the finite -- however
infinite in man's sight -- from the truly <STRONG>I</STRONG>NFINITE.
The Spirits referred to, therefore, as those who &quot;ascend
and descend&quot; are the &quot;Hosts&quot; of what we loosely
call &quot;celestial Beings.&quot; But they are, in fact, nothing
of the kind.

her on the right Path. Note well, &quot;Christos&quot; with the
Gnostics meant the impersonal principal, the Atman of the Universe,

They are Entities of the higher worlds in the hierarchy of Being,
so immeasurably high that, to us, they must appear as Gods, and
collectively -- <STRONG>G</STRONG>OD. But so we, mortal men, must
appear to the ant, which reasons on the scale of its special capacities.
The ant may also, for all we know, see the avenging finger of
a personal God in the hand of the urchin who, in one moment, under
the impulse of mischief, destroys its anthill, the labour of many
weeks -- long years in the chronology of insects. The ant, feeling
it acutely, and attributing the undeserved calamity to a combination
of Providence and sin, may also, like man, see in it the result
of the sin of its first parent. Who knows and who can affirm or
deny? The refusal to admit in the whole Solar system of any other
reasonable and intellectual beings on the human plane, than ourselves,
is the greatest conceit of our age. All that science has a right
to affirm, is that there are no invisible Intelligences living
under the same conditions as we do. It cannot deny point-blank
the possibility of there being worlds within worlds, under totally
different conditions to those that constitute the nature of our
world; nor can it deny that there may be a certain limited communication*
between some of those worlds and our own. To the highest, we are
taught, belong the seven orders of the purely divine Spirits;
to the six lower ones belong hierarchies that can occasionally
be seen and heard by men, and who do communicate with their progeny
of the Earth; which progeny is indissolubly linked with them,
each principle in man having its direct source in the nature of
those great Beings, who furnish us with the respective invisible
elements in us. Physical Science is welcome to speculate upon
the physiological mechanism of living beings, and to continue
her fruitless efforts in trying to resolve our feelings, our sensations,
mental and spiritual, into functions of their inorganic vehicles.
Nevertheless, all that will ever be accomplished in this direction
has already been done, and Science will go no farther.

* The greatest philosopher of European birth, Imanuel Kant, assures
us that such a communication is in no way improbable. &quot;I
confess I am much disposed to assert the existence of Immaterial
natures in the world, and to place my own soul in the class of
these beings. It will hereafter, I know not where, or when, yet
be proved that the human soul stands even in this life in indissoluble
connection with all immaterial natures in the spirit-world, that
it reciprocally acts upon these and receives impressions from
them.&quot; (Traume eines Geistersehers, quoted by C. C. Massey,

the cobwebs spun by her scientific fancies and illusions. The

of certain nerves. The inference drawn by scientists of the type
of Buchner, Vogt, and others, that thought is molecular motion,
necessitates a complete abstraction being made of the fact of
our subjective consciousness.

Jour de 'Viens a nous' . . . c'est le jour ou Osiris a dit au

(Chap. xvii., p. 61.) The Sun here stands for the Logos (or Christos,
or Horus) as central Essence synthetically, and as a diffused
essence of radiated Entities, different in substance, but not
in essence. As expressed by the <EM>Bhagavadgita </EM>lecturer,
&quot;it must not be supposed that the Logos is but a single centre
of energy manifested from Parabrahmam; there are innumerable other
centres . . . and their number is almost infinite in the bosom

as the square is the Symbol of the Four sacred Forces or Powers

that no man can cross, even in spirit, nor Deva nor Dhyan Chohan.
The Spirits of those who &quot;descend and ascend&quot; during
the course of cyclic evolution shall cross the &quot;iron-bound
world&quot; only on the day of their approach to the threshold
of Paranirvana. If they reach it -- they will rest in the bosom

Paranirvana. As in the exoteric interpretation of the Egyptian
rites the soul of every defunct person -- from the Hierophant
down to the sacred bull Apis -- became an Osiris, was Osirified,
though the Secret Doctrine had always taught, that the real Osirification
was the lot of every Monad only after 3,000 cycles of Existences;
so in the present case. The &quot;Monad,&quot; born of the nature
and the very Essence of the &quot;Seven&quot; (its highest principle
becoming immediately enshrined in the Seventh Cosmic Element),
has to perform its septenary gyration throughout the Cycle of
Being and forms, from the highest to the lowest; and then again
from man to God. At the threshold of Paranirvana it reassumes
its primeval Essence and becomes the Absolute once more.
