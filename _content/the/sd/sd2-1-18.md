###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 307 THE SEVEN AND FOURTEEN MANUS.

**T**HE **P**RIMEVAL **M**ANUS OF **H**UMANITY.

Those who are aware that the "great Flood," which was connected with the
sinking of an entire continent -- save what became a few islands --
could not have happened so far back as 18,000,000 years ago; and that
Vaivasvata Manu is the Indian Noah connected with the *Matsya* (or the
fish) Avatar of Vishnu -- may feel perplexed at this discrepancy between
facts stated and the chronology previously given. But there is no
discrepancy in truth. The reader is asked to turn to the *Theosophist*
of July, 1883, and after studying the article therein, "The Septenary
Principle in Esotericism," the whole question can be explained to him.
It is in this explanation, I believe, that the Occultists differ from
the Brahmins.

For the benefit of those, however, who may not have "The Theosophist" of
that month and year to hand, a passage or two may now be quoted from it:

> "Who was Manu, the son of Swayambhuva? The secret doctrine tells us

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* *Pralaya* -- a word already explained -- is not a term that applies
*only* to every "Night of Brahma," or the world's dissolution following
every Manvantara, equal to 71 Maha-yugas. It applies also to each
"obscuration" as well, and even to every Cataclysm that puts an end, by
Fire or by Water in turn, to each Root-Race. *Pralaya* is a term like
that of "Manu" -- the generic name for the *Sishtas,* who, under the
appellation of "King," are shown in *the Puranas* as preserved "with the
seed of all things in an ark from the waters of that flood" (or the
fires of a general volcanic conflagration, the commencement of which we
already see for our Fifth-Race in the terrible earthquakes and eruptions
of these late years, and especially in the present one) . . . . which in
the season of a pralaya overspreads the world" (the Earth). (*See
Preface,* *p. lxxxi.*, to Wilson's "*Vishnu Purana.*") Time is only a
form of "Vishnu" -- truly, as Parasara says in that Purana. In the Hindu
Yuga Kalpa, we have the regular descending series 4, 3, 2, with ciphers
multiplied as occasion requires for esoteric purposes, but not, as
Wilson and other Orientalists thought, for "sectarian embellishments." A
Kalpa may be an age, a "Day" of Brahma, or a sidereal Kalpa,
astronomical and earthly. Those calculations are found in all the
Puranas, but some differ -- as for instance, "the year of the seven
Rishis, 3,030 mortal years, and the year of Dhruva, 9,090 in the Linga
Purana," which are again esoteric, and which *do* represent actual
(secret) chronology. As said in the *Brahma Vaivarta:* "Chronologers
compute a Kalpa by the life of Brahma. *Minor* Kalpas, as Samvarta and
the rest, are numerous." "*Minor* Kalpas" denote here every period of
destruction, as was well understood by Wilson himself, who explains the
latter as "those in which the Samvarta wind or other destructive agents
operate" (*Vishnu Purana, p.* 54*, vol. I*.).

\* An intuition and a presentiment of the Sishtas may be found in Mr.
Sinnett's "Esoteric Buddhism, "Fifth Edition. See in it *Annotations* --
the "Noah's Ark Theory" pp. 146, 147.

\*\* The fact that Manu himself is made to declare that he was created
by Viraj, and that he then produced the ten Prajapatis, who again
produced seven Manus, who in their turn gave birth to seven other Manus
(*Manu, I,* 33-36) relates to other still earlier mysteries, and is at
the same time a *blind* with regard to the doctrine of the Septenary
chain, and the simultaneous evolution of seven humanities, or **M**EN.
However, the present work is written on the records of Cis-Himalayan
Secret Teachings, and Brahmanical esoteric philosophy may now differ in
form as the Kabala does. But they were identical in hoary antiquity.

\*\*\* There is another *esoteric* reason besides this one for it. A
Vaivasvata is the *seventh* Manu, because this our Round, although the
Fourth, is in the *preseptenary* Manvantara, and the Round itself is in
its *seventh* stage of materiality or physicality. The close of its
middle racial point occurred during the Fourth Root Race, when man and
all nature reached their lowest state of gross matter. From that time,
*i.e.*, from the end of the three and a half races, humanity and nature
entered on the ascending arc of their racial cycle.

\*\*\*\* The interval that precedes each Yuga is called a *Sandhya,*
composed of as many hundreds of years as there are thousands in the
yuga; and that which follows the latter is named *Sandhyamsa,* and is of
similar duration, we are told in *Vishnu Purana.* "The interval between
the Sandhya and the Sandhyamsa is the yuga denominated Krita, Treta,
etc., etc. The (four) Krita, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali constitute a great
age, or aggregate of four ages: a 1000 such aggregates are a Day of
Brahma; and 14 *Manus* *reign within that term*." Now had we to accept
this literally then there would be only one Manu for every 4,320,000,000
of years. As we are taught that it took 300,000,000 of years for the two
lower kingdoms to evolve, and that our humanity is just 18 and some odd
millions old -- where were the other Manus spoken of, unless the
allegory means what the esoteric doctrine teaches us about the 14 being
each multiplied by 49.

\* The words "creation," "dissolution," etc., do not render correctly
the right meaning of either Manvantara or Pralaya. The *Vishnu Purana*
enumerates several: The dissolution of all things is of four kinds,
Parasara is made to *say: -- Naimittika* (occasional), when Brahma
slumbers (his night, when, "At the end of this day occurs a
re-coalescence *of the Universe,* called Brahma's contingent
re-coalescence," because Brahma *is* this universe itself);
"*Prakritika* (elemental), when the return of this universe to its
original nature is partial and physical; *Atyantika* (absolute),
identification of *the embodied* with the incorporeal Supreme spirit --
Mahatmic state, whether temporary or until the following *Maha Kalpa:*
also absolute obscuration -- as of a whole \[\[Footnote continued on

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 310 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

Thus it is shown that there is no real discrepancy in speaking of the
Vaivasvata Manvantara (*Manu-antara,* lit. "between two Manus")
18,000,000 odd years ago, when physical, or the truly human man first
appeared in his Fourth Round on this earth; and of the other
Vaivasvatas, *e.g.,* the Manu of the Great Cosmic or sidereal Flood (a
mystery), or again the Manu Vaivasvata of the submerged Atlantis, when
the *racial* Vaivasvata saved the elect of Humanity, the Fifth Race,
from utter destruction. As the several (and quite different) events are
purposely blended in the *Vishnu* and other Puranas in one narrative,
there may yet be a great deal of perplexity left in the profane reader's
mind. Therefore, as constant elucidation is needed, we must be forgiven
unavoidable repetitions. The blinds which conceal the real mysteries of
Esoteric philosophy are great and puzzling, and even now the last word
cannot be given. The veil, however, may be a little more removed and
some explanations, hitherto denied, may now be offered to the earnest
student.

As somebody -- Colonel Vans Kennedy, if we do not mistake -- remarked,
"the first principle in Hindu religious philosophy is *Unity in*
*diversity.*" If all those Manus and Rishis are called by one generic
name, this is due to the fact that they are one and all the manifested
Energies of one and the same **L**OGOS, the celestial, as well as the
terrestrial messengers and permutations of that Principle which is ever
in a state of activity; conscious during the period of Cosmic evolution,
unconscious (from our point of view) during Cosmic rest, as the Logos
sleepeth in the bosom of THAT which "sleepeth not," nor is it ever awake
-- for it is SAT or *Be-ness,* not a Being. It is from IT that issues
the great unseen Logos, who evolves all the other *logoi,* the primeval
**M**ANU who gives being to the other Manus, who emanate the universe
and all in it collectively, and who represent in their aggregate the
*manifested* Logos.\* Hence we learn in the "Commentaries" that while no
Dhyan Chohan, not even the highest, can realise completely "the
condition of the preceding Cosmic evolution," "the Manus retain a
knowledge of their experiences of all the Cosmic evolutions throughout
Eternity." This is very plain: the first Manu is called *Swayambhuva,*

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] planetary chain, etc.; and
*Nitya* (perpetual) *Mahapralaya* for the Universe, *death --* for man,
*nitya* is the extinction of life, like the extinction of a lamp," also
"in sleep at night." *Nitya Sarga* is "constant or perpetual creation,"
as *Nitya pralaya* is "constant or perpetual destruction of all that is
born." "That which ensues after a minor dissolution is called ephemeral
creation. . . . This is Samyama" (production, existence, and
dissolution) (*Vishnu Purana, Book I., ch. vii.*) The subject is so
difficult that we are obliged to repeat our statements.

\* But see the superb definitions of Parabrahmam and the Logos in Mr.
Subba Row's Lectures on the *Bhagavat Gita* in the early numbers of the
Theosophist of 1887, Feb., March, April, and May.

"the Self-manifested," the Son of the *unmanifested* **F**ATHER. The
Manus are the creators of the creators of our First Race -- the Spirit
of mankind -- which does not prevent the *seven* Manus from having been
the first "pre-Adamic" men on Earth.

Manu declares himself created by Viraj,\* or Vaiswanara, (the Spirit of
Humanity),\*\* which means that his Monad emanates from the never
resting Principle in the beginning of every new Cosmic activity: that
*Logos* or **U**NIVERSAL **M**ONAD (collective Elohim) that radiates
*from* *within himself all* those Cosmic Monads that become the centres
of activity -- progenitors of the numberless Solar systems as well as of
the yet undifferentiated *human* monads of planetary chains as well as
of every being thereon. Each Cosmic Monad is "Swayambhuva," the
SELF-BORN, *which becomes the Centre of Force, from within which*
*emerges a planetary chain* (of which chains there are seven in our
system), and whose radiations become again so many Manus Swayambhuva (a
generic name, mysterious and meaning far more than appears), each of
these becoming, as a *Host,* the Creator of his own Humanity. (*See*
"*The Manus and the Manvantaras Explained by a Western Mystic* *and
Mathematician.*")

As to the question of the four distinct races of mankind that preceded
our Fifth Race, there is nothing mystical in it, except the ethereal
bodies of the first races; and it is a matter of legendary,
nevertheless, very correct history. That legend is universal. And if the
Western *savant* pleases to see in it only a myth, it does not make the
slightest difference. The Mexicans had, and still have, the tradition of
the fourfold destruction of the world by fire and water, just as the
Egyptians had, and the Hindus have, to this day.

Trying to account for the community of legends in the remote antiquity
-- held by Chinese, Chaldean, Egyptians, Indians and Greeks -- and for
the absence of any certain vestige of civilization more ancient than
5,000 years, the author of "*Mythical Monsters,*" remarks, that "we must
not be surprised if we do not immediately discover the vestiges of the
people of ten, fifteen, or twenty thousand years ago. With an ephemeral
architecture (as in China), the sites of vast cities may have become
entirely lost to recollection in a few thousands of years from natural
decay . . . and how much more . . . if . . . minor cataclysms have
intervened, such as local inundations, earthquakes, deposition of
volcanic ashes, the spread of sandy deserts, destruction of life by

magnetic fire that pervades the manifested solar system. It is the most
objective (to us the reverse) and ever present aspect of the ONE LIFE,
for it is the Vital Principle. (*See Theosophist,* *July,* 1883, *p*.
249). It is also a name of *Agni.*

deadly pestilence, by miasma, or by the outpour of sulphurous fumes."
("*Mythical Monsters,*" by Ch. Gould, p. 134.)

And how many of such cataclysms have changed the whole surface of the
earth may be inferred from this *Stanza:*

"*During the first seven* crores *of the Kalpa* (70,000,000 years) *the*
*Earth and its two Kingdoms* (mineral and vegetable), *one already
having* *achieved its seventh circle, the other, hardly nascent, are
luminous and* *semi-ethereal, cold, lifeless, and translucid. In the
eleventh crore\* the* *mother* (Earth) *grows opaque, and in the*
FOURTEENTH\*\* *the throes of* *adolescence take place. These
convulsions of nature* (geological changes) *last till her twentieth
crore of years, uninterruptedly, after which they* *become periodical,
and at long intervals.*"

*The last change took place nearly twelve crores of years ago*
(*120,000,000*)*. But the Earth with everything on her face had become
cool,* *hard and settled ages earlier.* (*Commentary, xxii.*)

Thus, if we are to believe esoteric teaching, there have been no more
*universal* geological disturbances and changes for the last 120
millions of years, and the Earth was, even before that time, ready to
receive her human stock. The appearance of the latter, however, in its
full physical development, as already stated, took place only about
eighteen millions of years ago, after the first great failure of nature
to create beings alone, without the help of the divine "Fashioners," had
been followed by the successive evolution of the first three races
(*See* *above Stanzas III. et seq*.). The actual duration of the first
two and a-half Races is withheld from all but the higher Initiates. The
History of the Races begins at the separation of the Sexes, when the
preceding egg-bearing androgynous race perished rapidly, and the
subsequent sub-races of the

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* This -- in the period of *Secondary* creation, so called. Of the
*Primary,* when Earth is in possession of the three *Elemental*
Kingdoms, we cannot speak for several reasons, one of which is, that,
unless one is a great seer, or naturally intuitional, he will be unable
to realise that which can never be expressed in any existing terms.

\*\* Hippocrates said that number seven "By its occult virtues tended to
the accomplishment of all things, to be the dispenser of life and
fountain of all its changes." The life of man he divided into seven ages
(Shakespeare), for "As the moon changes her phases every seven days,
this number influences all sublunary beings," and even the Earth, as we
know. With the child, it is the teeth that appear in the seventh month
and he sheds them at seven years; at twice seven puberty begins, at
three times seven all our mental and vital powers are developed, at four
times seven he is in his full strength, at five times seven his passions
are most developed, etc., etc. Thus for the Earth. It is now in its
middle age, yet very little wiser for it. The *Tetragrammaton,* the
four-lettered sacred name of the Deity, can be resolved on Earth only by
becoming Septenary through the manifest triangle proceeding from the
concealed *Tetraktis*. Therefore, the number seven has to be adopted on
this plane. As written in the Kabala "The greater Holy Assembly" v.
1161: -- "For assuredly there is no stability in those six, save (what
they derive) from *the seventh.* For *all things depend from the*
SEVENTH."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 313 THE ESOTERIC MEANING OF "FISH."

Third Root-Race appeared as an entirely new race *physiologically. It*
is this "destruction" which is called allegorically the great
"Vaivasvata Manu Deluge," when the account shows Vaivasvata Manu (or
"Humanity") remaining alone on Earth in the Ark of Salvation towed by
Vishnu in the shape of a monstrous fish, and the Seven Rishis "with
him." The allegory is very plain: --

In the Symbolism of every nation, the "Deluge" stands for Chaotic
unsettled matter -- Chaos itself: and the Water for the feminine
principle -- the "Great Deep." As the Greek Lexicon of Parkhurst gives
it -- "*Arche* (ark) answers to the Hebrew *rasit,* or Wisdom . . . .
and (at the same time) to the emblem of the female generative power, the
*Arg* or *Arca,* in which the germ of nature (and of mankind) floats or
broods on the great Abyss of the waters, during the interval which takes
place after every mundane (or racial) cycle." Ark is also the mystic
name of the divine spirit of *life* which broods over chaos. Now Vishnu
*is* the divine Spirit, as an abstract principle, and also as the
*Preserver* and *Generator,* or *Giver of life* -- the third person of
the Trimurti (composed of Brahma, the Creator, Siva, the Destroyer, and
Vishnu, the Preserver). Vishnu is shown in the allegory as guiding,
under the form of a *fish,* the Ark of Vaivasvata Manu clean across the
waters of the Flood. There is no use in expatiating upon the esoteric
meaning of the word *fish.* (*See Payne Knight, Inman, Gerald Massey,
etc.*) Its theological meanings is phallic, but the metaphysical,
*divine*. Jesus is called the "Fish," and so were Vishnu and Bacchus:
\[\[*Ies*\]\], the "Saviour" of mankind, being but the monogram of the
god Bacchus called \[\[*Ichthus*\]\], the fish.\* As to the Seven Rishis
in the Ark, they symbolised the seven principles, which became complete
in man only after he had separated, and become a *human,* and no longer
a divine creature. (*See for further* *details,* "*The Seventh Manu.*")

Nor have we many details about the submersion of the continent inhabited
by the Second Root Race. But the history of the Third, "Lemuria," is
given, as is that of Atlantis, the others being only alluded to. Lemuria
is said to have perished about 700,000 years before the commencement of
what is now called the Tertiary age (the Eocene),\*\* and it is during
this Deluge also -- an actual geological deluge this time -- that
Vaivasvata Manu is again shown as saving mankind (allegorically it is
mankind, or a portion of it, the Fourth Race, which is saved); so also
he saves the Fifth Race during the destruction of the last Atlanteans,
the

midst of waters." Christians called themselves little fishes *--
pisciculi --* in their sacred mysteries. "So many *fishes* bred *in the
water, and saved by one great fish,*" says Tertullian of the Christians
and Christ and the Church.

remnants that perished 850,000 years ago,\* after which there was no
great submersion until the day of Plato's Atlantis, or Poseidonis, known
to the Egyptians only because it happened in such relatively recent
times.

It is the submersion of the great Atlantis which is the most
interesting. It is of this cataclysm that the old records (*See the*
"*Book of Enoch*") say that "the ends of the Earth got loose;" and upon
which the legends and allegories of Vaivasvata, Xisuthrus, Noah,
Deukalion and all the *tutti quanti* of the Elect saved, have been
built. Tradition, taking into no account the difference between sidereal
and geological phenomena, calls both indifferently "deluges." Yet there
is a great difference. The cataclysm which destroyed the huge continent
of which Australia is the largest relic, was due to a series of
subterranean convulsions and the breaking asunder of the ocean floors.
That which put an end to its successor -- the fourth continent -- was
brought on by successive disturbances in the axial rotation. It began
during the earliest tertiary periods, and, continuing for long ages,
carried away successively the last vestige of Atlantis, with the
exception, perhaps, of Ceylon and a small portion of what is now Africa.
It changed the face of the globe, and no memory of its flourishing
continents and isles, of its civilizations and sciences, remained in the
annals of history, save in the Sacred records of the East.

Hence, Modern Science denies Atlantis and its existence. It even denies
any violent shiftings of the Earth's axis, and would attribute the
reason for the change of climates to other causes. But this question is
still an open one. If Dr. Croll will have it that all such alterations
can be accounted for by the effects of nutation and the precession of
the equinoxes, there are other men of Science, such as Sir H. James
(*Athenaeum, Aug.* 25, 1860), and Sir John Lubbock (*ibid*), who feel
more inclined to accept the idea that they are due to a change in the
position of the axis of rotation. Against this the majority of the
astronomers are again arrayed. But then, what have they not denied
before now, and what have they not denounced -- only to accept it later
on whenever the hypothesis became undeniable fact?

How far our figures agree, or rather disagree with modern Science will
be seen further in the *Addenda* to this Book, where the geology and
anthropology of our modern day are carefully compared with the same in
Archaic Science. At any rate, the period assigned in the Secret Doctrine
for the sinking of Atlantis, does not seem to disagree

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* This event, the destruction of the famous island of *Ruta* and the
smaller one *Daitya,* which occurred 850,000 years ago in the later
Pliocene times, must not be confounded with the submersion of the main
continent of Atlantis during the Miocene period. Geologists cannot place
the Miocene only so short a way back as 850,000 years; whatever they do,
it is several million years ago that the main Atlantis perished.

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 315 THE INNER MAN IN THE ZOHAR.

very much with the calculations of Modern Science, which calls Atlantis
"Lemuria," however, whenever it accepts such a submerged continent. With
regard to the pre-human period, all that can be said, at present, is,
that even up to the appearance of the "Mindless" First Race, the Earth
was not without its inhabitants. More may be said: that which Science --
recognizing *only physical man --* has a right to regard as the
*prehuman* period, may be conceded to have extended from the First Race
down to the first half of the Atlantean race, since it is only then that
man became the "complete *organic* being he is now." And this would make
*Adamic* man no older than a few million of years.\*

The author of the Qabbalah remarks truly that "Man to-day, as an
individual, is only a concatenation of the being-hood of precedent human
life," or *lives,* rather. "According to the Qabbalah, the soul sparks
contained in Adam (Rishoun), went into three principal classes
corresponding to his three *sons,* viz.: Hesed, Habel, Ge-boor-ah,
Qai-yin and *Ra*'*hmin* Seth. These three were divided into 70 species,
called: the principal roots of the human race." (p. 422.)

"Said Rabbi Jehudah: 'How many garments (of the incorporeal man) are
these which are crowned' (from the day man was 'created')? Said R.
El'eazar: 'The mountains of the world (the great men of the generation)
are in discussion upon it, but there are three: one to clothe in that
garment the Rua'h spirit, which is in the garden (of Eden) on earth: one
which is more precious than all, in which the *Neshamah is* clothed in
that Bundle of Life, between the angels of the Kings . . . : and one
outside garment, which exists and does not exist, is seen and not seen.
In that garment, the *Nephesh* is clothed, and she goes and flies in it,
to and fro in the world." (Zohar I., 119*b*. col. 475; Qabbalah, 412.)

This relates to the races (their "garments," or degree of materiality)
and to the three principles of man in their three vehicles.

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Mr. Huxley divides those races into the quintuple group of
Australioids, Negroids, Mongoloids, Xanthochroics and Melanochroics --
all issuing from imaginary Anthropoids. And yet, while protesting
against those who say "that the structural differences between man and
apes are small and insignificant," and adding that "every bone of the
gorilla bears a mark by which it can be distinguished from a
corresponding human bone," and that "in the present state of creation,
at least, no intermediary being fills the gap which separates the man
from the troglodyte" -- the great anatomist goes on speaking of the
Simian characteristics in Man! (*See de Quatrefages*' "*The Human*
*Species,*" *p.* 113.)
