<P>
14. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>S</STRONG>EVEN <STRONG>H</STRONG>OSTS,
THE &quot;<STRONG>W</STRONG>ILL (<EM>or Mind</EM>)-<STRONG>B</STRONG>ORN&quot;
<STRONG>L</STRONG>ORDS, <STRONG>P</STRONG>ROPELLED BY THE <STRONG>S</STRONG>PIRIT
OF <STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE-<STRONG>G</STRONG>IVING (<EM>Fohat</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>SEPARATE MEN FROM THEMSELVES, EACH ON HIS OWN <STRONG>Z</STRONG>ONE
(<EM>a</EM>).
<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) They threw off their &quot;shadows&quot; or <EM>astral
bodies </EM>-<EM>- </EM>if such an ethereal being as a &quot;lunar
Spirit&quot; may be supposed to rejoice in an astral, besides
a hardly tangible body. In another Commentary it is said that
the &quot;Ancestors&quot; <EM>breathed </EM>out the first man,
as Brahma is explained to have breathed out the <EM>Suras </EM>(Gods),
when they became &quot;<EM>Asuras</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(from <EM>Asu,
</EM>breath). In a third it is said that they, the newly-created
men, &quot;were the shadows of the Shadows.&quot;
<P>
With regard to this sentence -- &quot;They were the shadows of
the Shadows&quot; -- a few more words may be said and a fuller
explanation attempted. This first process of the evolution of
mankind is far easier to accept than the one which follows it,
though one and all will be rejected and doubted even by some Kabalists,
especially the Western, who study the present effects, but have
neglected to study their primary causes. Nor does the writer feel
competent to explain a mode of procreation so difficult of appreciation
save for an Eastern Occultist. Therefore it is useless to enter
here into details concerning the process, though it is minutely
described in the Secret Books, as it would only lead to speaking
of facts hitherto unknown to the profane world, and hence to their
being misunderstood. An &quot;Adam&quot; made of the dust of the
ground will always be found preferable, by a certain class of
students, to one projected out of the ethereal body of his creator;
though the former process has never been heard of, while the latter
is familiar, as all know, to many Spiritualists in Europe and
America, who, of all men, ought to understand it. For who of those
who have witnessed the phenomenon of a materialising form oozing
out of the pores of a medium or, at other times, out of his <EM>left
side, </EM>can fail to credit the possibility, at least, of such
a <EM>birth? </EM>If there are<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 87 MAN NOT CREATED PERFECT.</H6>

<P>
in the Universe such beings as Angels or Spirits, whose <EM>incorporeal
</EM>essence may constitute an intelligent entity notwithstanding
the absence of any (to us) solid organism; and if there are those
who believe that a god made the first man out of dust, and breathed
into him a living Soul -- and there are millions upon millions
who believe both -- what does this doctrine of ours contain that
is so impossible? Very soon the day will dawn, when the world
will have to choose whether it will accept the miraculous creation
of man (and Kosmos too) out of <EM>nothing, </EM>according to
the dead letter of <EM>Genesis, </EM>or a first man born from
a fantastic link -- absolutely &quot;<EM>missing</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>so far -- the common ancestor of man, and of the &quot;true
ape.&quot;* Between these two fallacies,** Occult philosophy steps
in. It teaches that the first human stock was projected by higher
and semi-divine Beings out of their own essences. If the latter
process is to be considered as abnormal or even inconceivable
-- because obsolete in Nature at this point of evolution -- it
is yet proven possible on the authority of certain &quot;Spiritualistic&quot;
FACTS. Which, then, we ask of the three hypotheses or theories
is the most reasonable and the least absurd? Certainly no one
-- provided he is not a soul-blind materialist -- can ever object
to the occult teaching.
<P>
Now, as shown, we gather from the latter that man was not &quot;created&quot;
the complete being he is now, however imperfect he still remains.
There was a spiritual, a psychic, an intellectual, and an animal
evolution, from the highest to the lowest, as well as a physical
development -- from the simple and homogeneous, up to the more
complex and heterogeneous; though not quite on the lines traced
for us by the modern evolutionists. This double evolution in two
contrary directions, required various ages, of divers natures
and degrees of spirituality and intellectuality, to fabricate
the being now known as man. Furthermore, the one absolute, ever
acting and never erring law, which proceeds on the
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* &quot;. . . Huxley, supported by the most evident discoveries
in Comparative Anatomy, could utter the momentous sentence that
the anatomical differences between man and the highest apes are
less than those between the latter and the lowest apes. In relation
to our genealogical tree of man, the necessary conclusion follows
that the human race has <EM>evolved gradually from the true apes.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(&quot;<EM>The Pedigree of Man,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>by Ernest
Haeckel, translated by Ed. B. Aveling, p. 49).
<P>
What may be the scientific and <EM>logical</EM> objections to
the opposite conclusion -- we would ask? The anatomical resemblances
between Man and the Anthropoids -- grossly exaggerated as they
are by Darwinists, as M. de Quatrefages shows -- are simply enough
&quot;accounted for&quot; when the origin of the latter is taken
into consideration.
<P>
&quot;Nowhere, in the older deposits, is an ape to be found that
approximates more closely to man, or a man that approximates more
closely to an ape . . . . . .&quot;
<P>
** &quot;. . . . . The same gulf which is found to-day between
Man and Ape, goes back with undiminished breadth and depth to
the Tertiary period. This fact alone is enough to make its untenability
clear,&quot; (Dr. F. Pfaff, Prof. of Natural Science in the University
of Erlangen). <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 88 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
same lines from one eternity (or Manvantara) to the other -- ever
furnishing an ascending scale for the manifested, or that which
we call the great Illusion (<EM>Maha-Maya</EM>)<EM>, </EM>but
plunging Spirit deeper and deeper into materiality on the one
hand, and then <EM>redeeming it through flesh </EM>and liberating
it -- this law, we say, uses for these purposes the Beings from
other and higher planes, men, or <EM>Minds </EM>(Manus), in accordance
with their Karmic exigencies.
<P>
At this juncture, the reader is again asked to turn to the Indian
philosophy and religion. The Esotericism of both is at one with
our Secret Doctrine, however much the form may differ and vary.

<P>
<STRONG>O</STRONG>N THE <STRONG>I</STRONG>DENTITY AND <STRONG>D</STRONG>IFFERENCES
OF THE <STRONG>I</STRONG>NCARNATING <STRONG>P</STRONG>OWERS.
<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE Progenitors of Man, called in India &quot;Fathers,&quot;
Pitara or Pitris, are the creators of our bodies and lower principles.
They are ourselves, as the <EM>first personalities,</EM> and<EM>
we are they. </EM>Primeval man would be &quot;the bone of their
bone and the flesh of their flesh,&quot; if they had body and
flesh. As stated, they were &quot;<EM>lunar </EM>Beings.&quot;
<P>
The Endowers of man with his conscious, immortal EGO, are the
&quot;Solar Angels&quot; -- whether so regarded metaphorically
or literally. The mysteries of the Conscious EGO or human Soul
are great. The esoteric name of these &quot;Solar Angels&quot;
is, literally, the &quot;Lords&quot; (<EM>Nath</EM>)<EM> </EM>of<EM>
</EM>&quot;persevering ceaseless devotion&quot; (<EM>pranidhana</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>Therefore they of the <EM>fifth</EM> principle<EM> </EM>(<EM>Manas</EM>)<EM>
</EM>seem to be connected with, or to have originated the system
of the Yogis who make of <EM>pranidhana </EM>their<EM> fifth</EM>
observance (see <EM>Yoga Shastra, </EM>II., 32.) It has already
been explained why the trans-Himalayan Occultists regard them
as evidently identical with those who in India are termed <EM>Kumaras,
Agnishwattas, </EM>and the <EM>Barhishads.</EM> 
<P>
How precise and true is Plato's expression, how profound and philosophical
his remark on the (human) soul or EGO, when he defined it as &quot;a
compound of the <EM>same </EM>and the <EM>other.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>And yet how little this hint has been understood, since the
world took it to mean that the soul was the breath of God, of
Jehovah. It is &quot;the <EM>same </EM>and the <EM>other,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>as the great Initiate-Philosopher said; for the EGO (the
&quot;Higher Self&quot; when merged with and in the Divine Monad)
is Man, and yet the <EM>same </EM>as the &quot;OTHER,&quot; the
Angel in him incarnated, as the same with the universal <STRONG>M</STRONG>AHAT.
The great classics and philosophers felt this truth, when saying
that &quot;there must be something within us which produces our
thoughts. Something very subtle; it is a breath; it is fire; it
is ether;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 89 PITRIS OF THE GODS AND DEMONS.</H6>

<P>
it is quintessence; it is a slender likeness; it is an intellection;
it is a number; it is harmony. . . . . &quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Voltaire</EM>)<EM>.</EM>

<P>
All these are the <EM>Manasam</EM> and<EM> Rajasas:</EM> the<EM>
Kumaras, Asuras, </EM>and<EM> </EM>other rulers and <EM>Pitris,
</EM>who incarnated in the Third Race, and in this and various
other ways endowed mankind with Mind.
<P>
There are seven classes of Pitris, as shown below, three incorporeal
and four corporeal; and two kinds, the Agnishwatta and the Barhishad.
And we may add that, as there are two kinds of Pitris, so there
is a double and a triple set of Barhishad and Agnishwatta. The
former, having given birth to their astral doubles, are reborn
as <EM>Sons of Atri, </EM>and are the &quot;Pitris of the Demons,&quot;
or corporeal beings, on the authority of Manu (III., 196); while
the Agnishwatta are reborn as Sons of Marichi (a son of Brahma),
and are the Pitris of the Gods (<EM>Manu </EM>again, <EM>Matsya</EM>
and<EM> Padma Puranas </EM>and<EM> Kulluka </EM>in the Laws of
the <EM>Manavas, </EM>III., 195).* Moreover, the <EM>Vayu Purana
</EM>declares all the seven orders to have originally been the
<EM>first gods, </EM>the<EM> Vairajas, </EM>whom Brahma &quot;with
the eye of Yoga, beheld in the eternal spheres, and who are the
<EM>gods of gods</EM>&quot;;<EM> </EM>and the <EM>Matsya </EM>adds
that the Gods worshipped them; while the <EM>Harivansa </EM>(<EM>S.
</EM>1, 935) distinguishes the Virajas as one class of the Pitris
only -- a statement corroborated in the Secret Teachings, which,
however, identify the Virajas with the <EM>elder Agnishwattas**
</EM>and the <EM>Rajasas, </EM>or<EM> Abhutarajasas, </EM>who
are incorporeal without even an astral phantom. Vishnu is said,
in most of the <B>MSS</B>., to have incarnated in and through
them. &quot;In the <EM>Raivata Manvantara, </EM>again, Hari, best
of gods, was born of <EM>Sambhuti, </EM>as the divine Manasas
-- originating with the deities called Rajasas.&quot; Sambhuti
was a daughter of Daksha, and wife of Marichi, the father of the
<EM>Agnishwatta, </EM>who, along with the Rajasas, are ever associated
with <EM>Manasas. </EM>As remarked by a far more able Sanskritist
than Wilson, Mr. Fitzedward Hall, &quot;Manasa is no inappropriate
name for a deity associated with the Rajasas. We appear to have
in it Manasam -- the same as <EM>Manas </EM>-- with<EM> </EM>the
change of termination required to express male personification&quot;
(<EM>Vishnu Purana </EM>Bk. III., ch. I., p. 17 footnote). All
the sons of <EM>Viraja </EM>are<EM> Manasa, </EM>says<EM> Nilakantha.
</EM>And
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* We are quite aware that the <EM>Yayu</EM> and<EM> Matsya Puranas
</EM>identify (agreeably to Western interpretation) the Agnishwatta
with the seasons, and the Barhishad Pitris with the months; adding
a fourth class -- the Kavyas -- cyclic years. But do not Christian,
Roman Catholics identify their Angels with planets, and are not
the seven Rishis become the <EM>Saptarshi </EM>-- a constellation?
They are deities presiding over all the cyclic divisions.
<P>
** The Vayu Purana shows the region called Viraja-loka inhabited
by the Agnishwattas.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 90 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Viraja is Brahma, and, therefore, the <EM>incorporeal </EM>Pitris
are called Vairajas from being the sons of Viraja, says <EM>Vayu
Purana.</EM> 
<P>
We could multiply our proofs <EM>ad infinitum, </EM>but it is
useless. The wise will understand our meaning, the <EM>unwise
</EM>are not required to. There are thirty-three crores, or 330
millions, of gods in India. But, as remarked by the learned lecturer
on the Bhagavad Gita, &quot;they may be all devas, but are by
no means all 'gods', in the high spiritual sense one attributes
to the term.&quot; &quot;This is an unfortunate blunder,&quot;
he remarks, &quot;generally committed by Europeans. Deva is a
kind of spiritual being, and because the same word is used in
ordinary parlance to mean god, it by no means follows that we
have to worship thirty-three crores of gods.&quot; And he adds
suggestively: &quot;These beings, as may be naturally inferred
have a <EM>certain affinity </EM>with one of the three component
<EM>Upadhis </EM>(basic principles) into which we have divided
man.&quot; -- (<EM>Vide Theosophist, </EM>Feb.,<EM> </EM>1887,
<EM>et seq.</EM>)
<P>
The names of the deities of a certain mystic class change with
every Manvantara. Thus the twelve great gods, <EM>Jayas, </EM>created
by Brahma to assist him in the work of creation in the very beginning
of the Kalpa, and who, lost in Samadhi, neglected to create --
whereupon they were cursed to be repeatedly born in each Manvantara
till the seventh -- are respectively called <EM>Ajitas, Tushitas,
Satyas, Haris, Vaikunthas, Sadhyas, </EM>and<EM> Adityas: </EM>they
are <EM>Tushitas </EM>(in the second Kalpa), and <EM>Adityas </EM>in
this <EM>Vaivasvata </EM>period (see <EM>Vayu Purana</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>besides other names for each age. But they are identical
with the <EM>Manasa </EM>or<EM> Rajasas, </EM>and these with our
incarnating Dhyan Chohans. They are all classes of the <EM>Gnana-devas.</EM>

<P>
Yes; besides those beings, who, like the Yakshas, Gandharvas,
Kinaras, etc., etc., taken in their <EM>individualities, </EM>inhabit
the astral plane, there are real <EM>Devagnanams, </EM>and to
these classes of <EM>Devas </EM>belong the <EM>Adityas,</EM> the<EM>
Vairajas, </EM>the<EM> Kumaras,</EM> the<EM> Asuras, </EM>and
all those high celestial beings whom Occult teaching calls <EM>Manaswin,
</EM>the Wise, foremost of all, and who would have made all men
the <EM>self-conscious </EM>spiritually intellectual beings they
will be, had they not been &quot;cursed&quot; to fall into generation,
and to be reborn themselves as mortals for their neglect of duty.

THEY WERE CALLED THE <STRONG>C</STRONG>HHAYA (<EM>image or shadow</EM>)
<STRONG>R</STRONG>ACE<EM> </EM>(<EM>c</EM>).
<P>
(<EM>a</EM>)<EM> Manu, </EM>as already remarked, comes from the
root &quot;<EM>man</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>to think, hence &quot;a
thinker.&quot; It is from this Sanskrit word very likely that
sprung the Latin &quot;mens,&quot; mind, the Egyptian &quot;<EM>Menes,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>the &quot;Master-Mind,&quot; the Pythagorean <EM>Monas, </EM>or
conscious &quot;<EM>thinking unit,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>mind also,
and even our &quot;Manas&quot; or mind, the fifth principle in
man. Hence these shadows are called <EM>amanasa, </EM>&quot;mindless.&quot;
<P>
With the Brahmins the Pitris are very sacred, because they are
the Progenitors,* or ancestors of men -- the first <EM>Manushya
</EM>on this Earth -- and offerings are made to them by the Brahmin
when a son is born unto him. They are more honoured and their
ritual is more important than the worship of the gods (See the
&quot;<EM>Laws of Manu,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Bk. III., p. 203).
<P>
May we not now search for a philosophical meaning in this dual
group of progenitors?
<P>
The Pitris being divided into <EM>seven classes, </EM>we have
here the mystic number again. Nearly all the Puranas agree that
three of these are <EM>arupa, </EM>formless, while four are corporeal;
the former being intellectual and spiritual, the latter material
and devoid of intellect. Esoterically, it is the <EM>Asuras </EM>who
form the first three classes of Pitris -- &quot;born in the body
of night&quot; -- whereas the other four were produced from the
body of twilight. Their fathers, the gods, were doomed to be born
fools on Earth, according to <EM>Vayu Purana. </EM>The legends
are purposely mixed up and made very hazy: the Pitris being in
one the sons of the gods, and, in another those of Brahma; while
a third makes them instructors of their own fathers. It is the
Hosts of the four material classes who create men simultaneously
on the seven zones.
<P>
Now, with regard to the seven classes of Pitris, each of which
is again divided into seven, a word to students and a query to
the profane. That class of the &quot;Fire Dhyanis,&quot; which
we identify on undeniable grounds with the Agnishwattas, is called
in our school the &quot;Heart&quot; of the Dhyan-Chohanic Body;
and it is said to have incarnated in the third race of men and
made them perfect. The esoteric Mystagogy speaks of the mysterious
relation existing between the hebdomadic essence or substance
of this angelic Heart and that of man, whose
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* This was hinted at in <EM>Isis Unveiled, Vol. </EM>I.<EM>, p</EM>.
xxxviii., though the full explanation could not then be given:
&quot;The <EM>Pitris </EM>are not the ancestors of the present
living men, but those of the first human kind or Adamic race;
the spirits of <EM>human</EM> races, which, on the great scale
of descending evolution, preceded our races of men, and were physically
as well as spiritually, far superior to our modem pigmies. In
<EM>Manava-Dharma-Sastra </EM>they are called the <EM>Lunar</EM>
ancestors.&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 92 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
every physical organ, and psychic, and spiritual function, is
a reflection, so to say, a copy on the terrestrial plane of the
model or prototype <EM>above. </EM>Why, it is asked, should there
be such a strange repetition of the number seven in the anatomical
structure of man? Why should the heart have <EM>four lower </EM>&quot;cavities
and <EM>three higher </EM>divisions,&quot; answering so strangely
to the septenary division of the human principles, separated into
two groups, the higher and the lower; and why should the same
division be found in the various classes of Pitris, and especially
our Fire Dhyanis? For, as already stated, these Beings fall into
four corporeal (or grosser) and three incorporeal (or subtler)
&quot;principles,&quot; or call them by any other name you please.
Why do the seven nervous plexuses of the body radiate <EM>seven</EM>
rays? Why are there these seven plexuses, and why seven distinct
layers in the human skin?
<P>
&quot;<EM>Having projected their shadows and made men of one element
</EM>(ether), <EM>the progenitors re-ascend to Maha-loka, whence
they descend periodically, when the world is renewed, to give
birth to new men.</EM> 
<P>
&quot;<EM>The subtle bodies remain without understanding </EM>(Manas)<EM>
until the advent of the Suras </EM>(Gods)<EM> now called Asuras
</EM>(not Gods),&quot; says the Commentary.
<P>
&quot;<EM>Not-gods,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>for the Brahmins, perhaps,
but the highest <EM>Breaths, </EM>for<EM> </EM>the Occultist;
since those progenitors (Pitar), the formless and the intellectual,
refuse to build man, but endow him with mind; the four corporeal
classes creating only his body.
<P>
This is very plainly shown in various texts of the <EM>Rig Veda</EM>
-- the highest authority for a Hindu of any sect whatever. Therein
<EM>Asura </EM>means &quot;spiritual divine,&quot; and the word
is used as a synonym for Supreme Spirit, while in the sense of
a &quot;God,&quot; the term &quot;Asura&quot; is applied to Varuna
and Indra and pre-eminently to Agni -- the three having been in
days of old the <EM>three highest gods, </EM>before Brahmanical
Theo-Mythology distorted the true meaning of almost everything
in the Archaic Scriptures. But, as the key is now lost, the Asuras
are hardly mentioned.
<P>
In the <EM>Zendavesta </EM>the same is found. In the Mazdean,
or Magian, religion, &quot;Asura&quot; is the lord <EM>Asura Visvavedas,
</EM>the &quot;all-knowing&quot; or &quot;omniscient Lord&quot;;
and <EM>Asura-Mazdha, </EM>become later <EM>Ahura-Mazdha,</EM>
is, as Benfey shows, &quot;the Lord who <EM>bestows Intelligence</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>-- Asura-Medha and Ahura-Mazdao. Elsewhere in this work it
is shown, on equally good authority, that the Indo-Iranian Asura
was always regarded as <EM>sevenfold. </EM>This fact, combined
with the name Mazdha, as above, which makes of the sevenfold Asura
the &quot;Lord,&quot; or &quot;Lords&quot; collectively &quot;who
<EM>bestow Intelligence,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>connects the <EM>Amshaspends
</EM>with the Asuras and with our incarnating Dhyan Chohans, as
well as with the Elohim, and the seven informing gods of Egypt,
Chaldea, and every other country.
<P>
Why these &quot;gods&quot; refused to create men is not, as stated
in exoteric<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 93 A GRAND APOCALYPTIC METAPHOR.</H6>

<P>
accounts, because their pride was too great to share the celestial
power of their essence with the children of Earth, but for reasons
already suggested. However, allegory has indulged in endless fancies
and theology taken advantage thereof in every country to make
out its case against these first-born, or the <EM>logoi, </EM>and
to impress it as a truth on the minds of the ignorant and credulous.
(Compare also what is said about Makara and the Kumaras in connection
with the Zodiac.)
<P>
The Christian system is not the only one which has degraded them
into demons. Zoroastrianism and even Brahmanism have profited
thereby to obtain hold over the people's mind. Even in Chaldean
exotericism, Beings who <EM>refuse to create, i.e., </EM>who are
said to oppose thereby the <EM>Demiurgos, </EM>are also denounced
as the Spirits of Darkness. The Suras, who win their intellectual
independence, fight the Suras who are devoid thereof, who are
shown as passing their lives in profitless ceremonial worship
based on blind faith -- a hint now ignored by the <EM>orthodox
</EM>Brahmins -- and forthwith the former become <EM>A-Suras.
The </EM>first and <EM>mind-born </EM>Sons of the Deity refuse
to create progeny, and are <EM>cursed </EM>by Brahma to be <EM>born
as men. </EM>They are hurled <EM>down to Earth, </EM>which, later
on, is transformed, in theological dogma, into the <EM>infernal
</EM>regions. Ahriman destroys the Bull created by Ormazd -- which
is the emblem of terrestrial <EM>illusive </EM>life, the &quot;germ
of sorrow&quot; -- and, forgetting that the perishing finite seed
must die, in order that the plant of immortality, the plant of
spiritual, eternal life, should sprout and live, Ahriman is proclaimed
the enemy, the opposing power, the devil. Typhon cuts Osiris into
fourteen pieces, in order to prevent his peopling the world and
thus creating misery; and Typhon becomes, in the exoteric, theological
teaching, the Power of Darkness. But all this is the exoteric
shell. It is the worshippers of the latter who attribute to disobedience
and rebellion the effort and self-sacrifice of those who would
help men to their original status of divinity through <EM>self-conscious
</EM>efforts; and it is these worshippers of Form who have made
demons of the Angels of Light.
<P>
Esoteric philosophy, however, teaches that <EM>one third* </EM>of
the Dhyanis -- <EM>i.e.</EM>, the three classes of the <EM>Arupa
</EM>Pitris, endowed with intelligence, &quot;which is a formless
breath, composed of <EM>intellectual </EM>not elementary substances&quot;
(see <EM>Harivamsa, </EM>932)<EM> </EM>-- was simply <EM>doomed
by the law of Karma and evolution to be reborn </EM>(or incarnated)
on Earth.** Some

seven heads and <EM>ten </EM>horns, and seven crowns upon his
heads,&quot; whose &quot;tail drew the <EM>third part </EM>of
the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth&quot; (ch.
xii.).
<P>
** The verse &quot;did cast them to the Earth,&quot; plainly shows
its origin in the grandest and oldest allegory of the Aryan mystics,
who, after the destruction of the Atlantean [[Footnote continued

of these were <EM>Nirmanakayas </EM>from other Manvantaras. Hence
we see them, in all the Puranas, reappearing on this globe, in
the <EM>third Manvantara, </EM>as Kings, Rishis and heroes (read
Third Root-Race). This tenet, being too philosophical and metaphysical
to be grasped by the multitudes, was, as already stated, disfigured
by the priesthood for the purpose of preserving a hold over them
through superstitious fear.
<P>
The supposed &quot;rebels,&quot; then, were simply those who,
compelled by Karmic law to drink the cup of gall to its last bitter
drop, <EM>had to incarnate </EM>anew, and thus make responsible
thinking entities of the astral statues projected by their inferior
brethren. Some are said to have refused, because they had not
in them the requisite materials -- <EM>i.e.</EM>, an astral body
-- since they were <EM>arupa. </EM>The refusal of others had reference
to their having been Adepts and Yogis of long past preceding Manvantaras;
another mystery. But, later on, as <EM>Nirmanakayas, </EM>they
sacrificed themselves for the good and salvation of the <EM>Monads
</EM>which were waiting for their turn, and which otherwise would
have had to linger for countless ages in irresponsible, animal-like,
though in appearance human, forms. It may be a parable and an
allegory <EM>within an allegory. </EM>Its solution is left to
the intuition of the student, if he only reads that which follows
with his <EM>spiritual eye.</EM> 
<P>
As to their fashioners or &quot;Ancestors&quot; -- those Angels
who, in the exoteric legends, obeyed the law -- they must be identical
with the Barhishad Pitris, or the Pitar-Devata, <EM>i.e.</EM>,
<EM>those possessed of the physical creative fire. </EM>They could
only create, or rather clothe, the human Monads with their own
astral Selves, but they could not make man in their image and
likeness. &quot;Man must not be like one of us,&quot; say the
<EM>creative </EM>gods, entrusted with the fabrication of the
lower animal but higher; (see <EM>Gen. </EM>and<EM> Plato</EM>'<EM>s
Timaeus</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Their creating the semblance of men out
of their own divine Essence means, esoterically, that it is

sorcerers, </EM>concealed the truth --<EM> astronomical, physical,</EM>
and<EM> divine</EM>, as it is a page out of <EM>pre-cosmic </EM>theogony
-- under various allegories. Its esoteric, true interpretation
is a veritable Theodice of the &quot;Fallen Angels,&quot; so called;
the <EM>willing</EM> and the <EM>unwilling,</EM> the <EM>creators
</EM>and those who <EM>refused to create, </EM>being now mixed
up most perplexingly by Christian Catholics, who forget that their
highest Archangel, St. Michael, who is shown to conquer (to master
and to assimilate) the <STRONG>D</STRONG>RAGON OF <STRONG>W</STRONG>ISDOM
and of divine Self-sacrifice (now miscalled and calumniated as
Satan), WAS THE FIRST TO REFUSE TO CREATE! This led to endless
confusion. So little does Christian theology understand the paradoxical
language of the East and its symbolism, that it even explains,
in its <EM>dead letter sense, </EM>the Chinese Buddhist and Hindu
exoteric rite of raising a noise during certain eclipses to scare
away the &quot;great red Dragon,&quot; which laid a plot to carry
away the light! But here &quot;Light&quot; means esoteric Wisdom,
and we have sufficiently explained the secret meaning of the terms
<EM>Dragon, Serpent, </EM>etc., etc., all of which refer to Adepts
and Initiates.<HR>

<P>
they who became the first Race, and thus shared its destiny and
further evolution. They <EM>would </EM>not, simply because they
<EM>could </EM>not, give to man that sacred spark which burns
and expands into the flower of human reason and self-consciousness,
for they had it not to give. This was left to that class of Devas
who became symbolised in Greece under the name of Prometheus,
to those who had nought to do with the physical body, yet everything
with the purely spiritual man. (<EM>See Part II of this volume,
</EM>&quot;<EM>The Fallen Angels</EM>&quot;;<EM> also </EM>&quot;<EM>The
Gods of Light proceed from the Gods of Darkness.</EM>&quot;)
<P>
Each class of Creators endows man with what it has to give: the
one builds his external form; the other gives him its essence,
which later on becomes the Human <EM>Higher Self </EM>owing to
the <EM>personal exertion of the individual</EM>;<EM> </EM>but
they could not make men as they were themselves -- perfect, because
sinless; sinless, because having only the first, pale shadowy
outlines of attributes, and these all perfect -- from the human
standpoint -- white, pure and cold as the virgin snow. Where there
is no struggle, there is no merit. Humanity, &quot;of the Earth
earthy,&quot; was not destined to be created by the angels of
the first divine Breath: therefore they are said to <EM>have refused
</EM>to do so, and man had to be formed by more material creators,*
who, in their turn, could give only what they had in their own
natures, and no more. Subservient to eternal law, the pure gods
could only project out of themselves <EM>shadowy </EM>men, a little
less ethereal and spiritual, less <EM>divine and perfect </EM>than
themselves -- shadows still. The first humanity, therefore, was
a pale copy of its progenitors; too material, even in its ethereality,
to be a hierarchy of gods; too spiritual and pure to be MEN, endowed
as it is with every <EM>negative </EM>(<EM>Nirguna</EM>)<EM> </EM>perfection.
Perfection, to be fully such, must be born out of imperfection,
the <EM>incorruptible </EM>must grow out of the corruptible, having
the latter as its vehicle and basis and contrast. Absolute light
is absolute darkness, and <EM>vice versa. </EM>In fact, there
is neither light nor
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* In spite of all efforts to the contrary, Christian theology
-- having burdened itself with the Hebrew esoteric account of
the creation of man, which is understood <EM>literally</EM> --
cannot find any reasonable excuse for its &quot;<EM>God, </EM>the
Creator,&quot; who produces a man devoid of mind and sense; nor
can it justify the punishment following an act, for which Adam
and Eve might plead <EM>non compos. </EM>For if the couple is
admitted to be ignorant of good and evil before the eating of
the forbidden fruit, how could it be expected to know that <EM>disobedience
was evil? </EM>If primeval man was meant to remain a half-witted,
or rather witless, being, then his creation was aimless and even
<EM>cruel, </EM>if produced by an omnipotent and perfect God.
But Adam and Eve are shown, even in Genesis, to be created by
a class of lower divine Beings, the <EM>Elohim, </EM>who are so
jealous of their personal prerogatives as reasonable and intelligent
creatures, that they will not allow man to become &quot;as one
of us.&quot; This is plain, even from the dead-letter meaning
of the Bible. The Gnostics, then, were right in regarding the
Jewish God as belonging to a class of lower, material and not
very holy denizens of the invisible World.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 96 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
darkness in the realms of truth. Good and Evil are twins, the
progeny of Space and Time, under the sway of Maya. Separate them,
by cutting off one from the other, and they will both die. Neither
exists <EM>per se, </EM>since each has to be generated and created
out of the other, in order to come into being; both must be known
and appreciated before becoming objects of perception, hence,
in mortal mind, they must be divided.
<P>
Nevertheless, as the illusionary distinction exists, it requires
a <EM>lower order of creative angels </EM>to &quot;create&quot;
inhabited globes -- especially ours -- or to deal with matter
on this earthly plane. The philosophical Gnostics were the first
to think so, in the historical period, and to invent various systems
upon this theory. Therefore in their schemes of creation, one
always finds their <EM>Creators </EM>occupying a place at the
very foot of the ladder of spiritual Being. With them, those who
created our earth and its mortals were placed on the very limit
of <EM>mayavic </EM>matter, and their followers were taught to
think -- to the great disgust of the Church Fathers -- that for
the creation of those wretched races, in a spiritual and moral
sense, which grace our globe, no high divinity could be made responsible,
but only angels of a <EM>low hierarchy,* </EM>to which class they
relegated the Jewish God, Jehovah.
<P>
Mankinds different from the present are mentioned in all the ancient
Cosmogonies. Plato speaks, in the <EM>Phaedrus, </EM>of a <EM>winged
race of men. </EM>Aristophanes (<EM>in Plato</EM>'<EM>s Banquet</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>speaks of a race androgynous and with round bodies. In <EM>Pymander,
</EM>all the animal kingdom even is double-sexed. Thus in &#167;
18, it is said: &quot;The circuit having been accomplished, <EM>the
knot was loosened</EM>. . . . and all the animals, which were
equally androgynous, were <EM>untied</EM> (separated)<EM> together
with man</EM>. . . . .&quot; for. . . . &quot;the causes had to
produce effects on earth.&quot;** Again, in the ancient Quiche
Manuscript, the <EM>Popol Vuh </EM>-- published by the late Abbe
Brasseur de Bourbourg -- the first men are described as a race
&quot;whose sight was unlimited, and who knew all things at once&quot;:
thus showing the <EM>divine knowledge of Gods, </EM>not mortals.
The Secret Doctrine, correcting the unavoidable exaggerations
of popular fancy, gives the facts as they are recorded in the
Archaic symbols.
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* In<EM> Isis Unveiled </EM>several of these Gnostic systems are
given. One is taken from the <EM>Codex Nazaraeus, </EM>the Scriptures
of the Nazarenes, who, although they existed long before the days
of Christ, and even before the laws of Moses, were Gnostics, and
many of them Initiates. They held their &quot;Mysteries of Life&quot;
in Nazara (ancient and modern Nazareth), and their doctrines are
a faithful echo of the teachings of the Secret Doctrine -- some
of which we are now endeavouring to explain.

(<EM>b</EM>) These &quot;shadows&quot; were born &quot;each of
his own colour and kind,&quot; each also &quot;inferior to his
creator,&quot; because the latter was a complete being of his
kind. The Commentaries refer the first sentence to the colour
or complexion of each human race thus evolved. In <EM>Pymander,
</EM>the Seven primitive men, created by Nature from the &quot;heavenly
Man,&quot; all partake of the qualities of the &quot;Seven <EM>Governors,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>or Rulers, who loved Man -- their own reflection and synthesis.
<P>
In the Norse Legends, one recognizes in Asgard, the habitat of
the gods, as also in the <EM>Ases </EM>themselves, the same mystical
<EM>loci </EM>and personifications woven into the popular &quot;myths,&quot;
as in our Secret Doctrine; and we find them in the Vedas, the
Puranas, the Mazdean Scriptures and the Kabala. The <EM>Ases </EM>of
Scandinavia, the rulers of the world which preceded ours, whose
name means literally the &quot;pillars of the world,&quot; its
&quot;supports,&quot; are thus identical with the Greek <EM>Cosmocratores,
</EM>the &quot;Seven Workmen or Rectors&quot; of Pymander, the
seven Rishis and Pitris of India, the seven Chaldean gods and
seven evil spirits, the seven Kabalistic Sephiroth synthesised
by the upper triad, and even the seven Planetary Spirits of the
Christian mystics. The Ases create the earth, the seas, the sky
and the clouds, the whole visible world, from the remains of the
slain giant Ymir; but they do not create <STRONG>M</STRONG>AN,
but only his form from the <EM>Ask </EM>or ash-tree. It is Odin
who endows him with life and soul, after Lodur had given him blood
and bones, and finally it is Honir who furnishes him with his
intellect (<EM>manas</EM>)<EM> </EM>and with his conscious senses.
The Norse Ask, the Hesiodic Ash-tree, whence issued the men of
the generation of bronze, the Third Root-Race, and the <EM>Tzite
</EM>tree of the <EM>Popol-Vuh, </EM>out of which the Mexican
<EM>third</EM> race of men was created, are all one.* This may
be plainly seen by any reader. But the Occult reason why the Norse
Yggdrasil, the Hindu Aswatha, the Gogard, the Hellenic tree of
life, and the Tibetan Zampun, are one with the Kabalistic Sephirothal
Tree, and even with the Holy Tree made by Ahura Mazda, and the
Tree of Eden -- who among the western scholars can tell?** Nevertheless,
the fruits of all those &quot;Trees,&quot; whether Pippala or
Haoma or yet the more prosaic apple, are the &quot;plants of life,&quot;
in fact and verity. The prototypes of our races were all enclosed
in the microcosmic tree, which grew and developed <EM>within and
under </EM>the great mundane macrocosmic tree***; and the mystery
is half revealed in the <EM>Dirghotamas, </EM>where it is said:

<EM>love the science, </EM>and where the gods produce all marvels.&quot;
As in the Gogard, among the luxuriant branches of all those mundane
trees, the &quot;Serpent&quot; dwells. But while the Macroscosmic
tree is the Serpent of Eternity and of absolute Wisdom itself,
those who dwell in the Microcosmic tree are the Serpents of the
manifested Wisdom. One is the One and All; the others are its
<EM>reflected </EM>parts. The &quot;tree&quot; is man himself,
of course, and the Serpents dwelling in each, the conscious <EM>Manas,
</EM>the connecting link between Spirit and Matter, heaven and
earth.
<P>
Everywhere, it is the same. The <EM>creating </EM>powers produce
Man, but fail in their final object. All these logoi strive to
endow man with <EM>conscious </EM>immortal spirit, reflected in
the Mind (<EM>manas</EM>)<EM> </EM>alone; they fail, and they
are all represented as being punished for the failure, if not
for the attempt. What is the nature of the punishment? A sentence
of imprisonment in the lower or nether region, which is <EM>our
earth</EM>;<EM> the lowest in its chain</EM>;<EM> </EM>an &quot;eternity&quot;
-- meaning the duration of the life-cycle -- in the <EM>darkness
</EM>of matter, or <EM>within animal Man. </EM>It has pleased
the half ignorant and half designing Church Fathers to disfigure
the graphic symbol. They took advantage of the metaphor and allegory
found in every old religion to turn them to the benefit of the
new one. Thus man was transformed into the darkness of a material
hell; his divine consciousness, obtained from his indwelling Principle
(the Manasa), or the incarnated Deva, became the glaring flames
of the infernal region; and our globe that Hell itself. <EM>Pippala,
Haoma, </EM>the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, were denounced
as the <EM>forbidden </EM>fruit, and the &quot;Serpent of Wisdom,&quot;
the Voice of reason and consciousness, remained identified for
ages with the Fallen Angel, which is the old Dragon, the Devil!
(<EM>Vide </EM>Part II., &quot;The Evil Spirit, who, or what?&quot;)
<P>
The same for the other high symbols. The <EM>Svastica, </EM>the
most sacred and mystic symbol in India, the &quot;Jaina-Cross&quot;
as it is now called by the Masons, notwithstanding its direct
connection, and even identity with the Christian Cross, has become
dishonoured in the same manner. It is the &quot;devil's sign,&quot;
we are told by the Indian missionaries. &quot;Does it not shine
on the head of the great <EM>Serpent </EM>of Vishnu, on the thousand
headed Sesha-Ananta, in the depths of Patala, the Hindu <EM>Naraka
</EM>or Hell&quot;? It does: but what is Ananta? As Sesha, it
is the almost endless Manvantaric cycle of time, and becomes <EM>infinite</EM>
Time itself, when called Ananta, the great seven-headed Serpent,
on which rests Vishnu, the <EM>eternal Deity,</EM> during<EM>
Pralayic</EM> inactivity. What has Satan to do with this highly
metaphysical symbol? The <EM>Svastica </EM>is the most philosophically
scientific of all symbols, as also the most comprehensible. It
is the summary in a few lines of the whole work of <EM>creation,
</EM>or evolution, as one should rather say, from Cosmo-theogony
down to Anthro- <HR>

pogony, from the indivisible unknown Parabrahm to the humble <EM>moneron
</EM>of materialistic science, whose <EM>genesis is as unknown
</EM>to that science as is that of the All-Deity itself. The <EM>Svastica
</EM>is found heading the religious symbols of every old nation.
It is the &quot;Worker's Hammer&quot; in the Chaldean <EM>Book
of Numbers, </EM>the &quot;Hammer&quot; just referred to in the
&quot;<EM>Book of Concealed Mystery</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Ch.
</EM>I., &#167;&#167; 1<EM>, </EM>2, 3, 4, etc.), &quot;which
striketh sparks from the flint&quot; (Space), those sparks becoming
worlds. It is &quot;Thor's Hammer,&quot; the magic weapon forged
by the dwarfs against the Giants, or the <EM>pre-cosmic </EM>Titanic
forces of Nature, which rebel and, while alive in the region of
matter, will not be subdued by the Gods, the Agents of Universal
Harmony, but have first to be destroyed. This is why the world
is formed out of the relics of the murdered Ymir. The Svastica
is the Miolnir, the &quot;storm-hammer&quot;; and therefore it
is said that when the Ases, the holy gods, after having been purified
by fire (the fire of passions and suffering in their life-incarnations),
become fit to dwell in Ida in eternal peace, then Miolnir will
become useless. This will be when the bonds of Hel (the goddess-queen
of the region of the Dead) will bind them no longer, for the kingdom
of evil will have passed away. &quot;Surtur's flames had not destroyed
them, nor yet had the raging waters&quot; of the several deluges.
. . . . &quot;Then came the sons of Thor. They brought <EM>Miolnir</EM>
with them, no longer as a weapon of war, but as the hammer with
which to consecrate the new heaven and the new Earth. . . . .

<P>
Verily many are its meanings! In the <EM>Macrocosmic </EM>work,
the &quot;<STRONG>H</STRONG>AMMER OF <STRONG>C</STRONG>REATION,&quot;
with its four arms bent at right angles, refers to the continual
<EM>motion</EM> and revolution of the invisible Kosmos of Forces.
In that of the manifested Kosmos and our Earth, it points to the
rotation in the cycles of Time of the world's axes and their equatorial
belts; the two lines forming the <EM>Svastica</EM> <IMG SRC="sd2-29a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
meaning Spirit and Matter, the four hooks suggesting the motion
in the revolving cycles. Applied to the <EM>Microcosm, </EM>Man,
it shows him to be a link between heaven and Earth: the right
hand being raised at the end of a horizontal arm, the left pointing
to the Earth. In the <EM>Smaragdine Tablet of Hermes, </EM>the
uplifted right hand is inscribed with the word &quot;<EM>Solve,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>the left with the word &quot;<EM>Coagula.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>It is at one and the same time an Alchemical, Cosmogonical,
Anthropological, and Magical sign, with seven keys to its inner
meaning. It is not too much to say that the compound symbolism
of this universal and most suggestive of signs contains the key
to the seven great mysteries of Kosmos. Born in the mystical conceptions
of the early Aryans, and by them placed at the very threshold
of eternity, on the head of the serpent Ananta, it found

its spiritual death in the scholastic interpretations of mediaeval

Illusion and Deceiver. The light that shines from under the divine

any human schemes or fictions.
<P>
How prophetic are the songs of the three Norse Goddesses, to whom
the ravens of Odin whisper of the past and the future, as they
flutter around in their abode of crystal beneath the flowing river.
The songs are all written down in the &quot;<EM>Scrolls </EM>of
Wisdom,&quot; of which many are lost but some still remain: and
they repeat in poetical allegory the teachings of the archaic
ages. To summarise from Dr. Wagner's &quot;Asgard and the Gods,&quot;
the &quot;renewal of the world,&quot; which is a prophecy about
the seventh Race of our Round told in the past tense.
<P>
The Miolnir had done its duty in this Round, and: --
<P>
&quot;. . . . on the field of Ida, the field of resurrection (for
the Fifth Round), the sons of the highest gods assembled, and
<EM>in them their fathers rose again </EM>(the<EM> Egos </EM>of
all their past incarnations). They talked of the Past and the
Present, and remembered the wisdom and prophecies of their ancestor
which had all been fulfilled. Near them, but <EM>unseen of them,
</EM>was the strong, the mighty One, who rules all things. . .
. and ordains the eternal laws that govern the world. They <EM>all
knew he was there, they felt his presence and his power, but were
ignorant of his name. At his command the new Earth rose out of
the Waters of Space. </EM>To the South above the Field of Ida,
he made another heaven called Audlang, and further off, a third,
Widblain. Over Gimil's cave, a wondrous palace was erected, covered
with gold and shining bright in the sun.&quot; These are the three
gradually ascending planets of our &quot;Chain.&quot; There the
Gods were enthroned, as <EM>they used to be</EM>. . . . From Gimil's
heights (the<EM> seventh </EM>planet or globe, the highest and
the purest), they looked down upon the happy descendants of LIF
and LIFTHRASIR (the coming Adam and Eve of purified <EM>humanity</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>and signed to them to CLIMB <EM>up</EM> <EM>higher,</EM>
to<EM> rise in knowledge and wisdom, </EM>step by step, from one
&quot;heaven to another,&quot; until they were at last fit to
be united to the Gods in the house of All-Father (p. 305).
<P>
He who knows the doctrines of Esoteric <EM>Budhism, </EM>(or Wisdom),
though so imperfectly sketched hitherto, will see clearly the
allegory contained in the above.
<P>
Its more philosophical meaning will be better understood if the
reader thinks carefully over the myth of Prometheus. It is examined

<P>
further on in the light of the Hindu <EM>Pramantha. </EM>Degraded
into a <EM>purely physiological </EM>symbol by some Orientalists,
and taken in connection with terrestrial fire only, their interpretation
is an insult to every religion, including Christianity, whose
greatest mystery is thus dragged down to matter. The &quot;friction&quot;
of divine Pramantha and Arani could suggest itself under this
image only to the brutal conceptions of the German materialists
-- than whom there are none worse. It is true that the Divine
babe, <EM>Agni</EM> with the Sanskrit-speaking Race, who became
<EM>Ignis </EM>with the Latins, is born from the conjunction of
Pramantha and Arani (Svastica) during the sacrificial ceremony.
But what of that? <EM>Twashtri </EM>(Viswakarman) is the &quot;divine
artist and <EM>carpenter</EM>&quot;<EM>* </EM>and is also the
Father of the gods and of <EM>creative fire </EM>in the Vedas.
So ancient is the symbol and so sacred, that there is hardly an
excavation made on the sites of old cities without its being found.
A number of such <EM>terra cotta </EM>discs, called <EM>fusaiolos,</EM>
were found by Dr. Schliemann <EM>under</EM> the ruins of ancient
Troy. Both these forms <IMG SRC="sd2-101a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
and <IMG SRC="sd2-101b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> were excavated in
great abundance, their presence being one more proof that the
ancient Trojans and their ancestors were pure Aryans.
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>) Chhaya, as already explained, is the astral image.
It bears this meaning in Sanskrit works. Thus Sanjna (Spiritual
Consciousness), the wife of Surya, the Sun, is shown retiring
into the jungle to lead an ascetic life, and leaving behind to
her husband her Chhaya, shadow or image.

* The &quot;Father of the Sacred Fire,&quot; writes Prof. Jolly,
&quot;is Twashtri . . . his mother was Maya. He himself was styled
<EM>Akta</EM> (anointed, [[<EM>christos</EM>]]), after the priest
had poured upon his head the <EM>spirituous </EM>(?)<STRONG> S</STRONG>OMA,
and on his body butter purified by sacrifice&quot;; (&quot;<EM>Man
before Metals,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>p. 190). The source of his
information is not given by the French Darwinist. But the lines
are quoted to show that light begins to dawn even upon the materialists.
Adalbert Kuhn, in his &quot;<EM>Die Herabkunft des Feuers,</EM>&quot;
identifies the two signs <IMG SRC="sd2-29a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
and <IMG SRC="sd2-101a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> with <EM>Arani</EM>,
and designates them under this name. He adds: &quot;This process
of kindling fire naturally led men to the idea of sexual reproduction,&quot;
etc. Why could not a more dignified idea, and one more occult,
have led man to invent that symbol, in so far as it is connected,
in one of its aspects, with human reproduction? But its chief
symbolism refers to Cosmogony.
<P>
&quot;<EM>Agni</EM>, in the condition of <EM>Akta, </EM>or anointed,
is suggestive of Christ,&quot; remarks Prof. Jolly. &quot;<EM>Maya,
</EM>Mary, his mother; <EM>Twastri</EM>, St. Joseph, the carpenter
of the Bible.&quot; In the <EM>Rig Veda, </EM>Viswakarman is the
highest and oldest of the Gods and their &quot;Father.&quot; He
is the &quot;carpenter or builder,&quot; because God is called

Still, the original idea is purely metaphysical, and had no connection
with the later Phallicism.<HR>

. . . . . .
<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) Here an explanation again becomes necessary in the
light, and with the help of the exoteric added to the esoteric
scriptures. The &quot;<EM>Manushyas</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(men)
and the <EM>Manus </EM>are here equivalent to the Chaldean &quot;Adam&quot;
-- this term not meaning at all the first man, as with the Jews,
or one solitary individual, but <EM>mankind </EM>collectively,
as with the Chaldeans and Assyrians. It is the four orders or
classes of Dhyan Chohans out of the seven, says the Commentary,
&quot;who were the progenitors of the <EM>concealed </EM>man<EM>,</EM>&quot;<EM>
i.e</EM>., the subtle inner man. The &quot;Lha&quot; of the Moon,
the lunar spirits, were, as already stated, only the <EM>ancestors
of his form, i.e., </EM>of the model according to which Nature
began her external work upon him. Thus primitive man was, when
he appeared, only a senseless Bhuta* or a &quot;Phantom.&quot;
This &quot;creation&quot; was a failure, the reason of which will
be explained in the Commentary on Sloka 20.
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>) This attempt was again a failure. It allegorizes
the vanity of <EM>physical </EM>nature's unaided attempts to construct
even a perfect <EM>animal</EM> -- let alone man. For the &quot;Fathers,&quot;
the lower Angels, are all Nature-Spirits and the higher Elementals
also possess an intelligence of their own; but this is not enough
to construct a THINKING man. &quot;<EM>Living</EM> Fire&quot;
was needed, that fire which gives the human mind its self-perception
and self-consciousness, or <EM>Manas</EM>;<EM> </EM>and the progeny
of <EM>Parvaka</EM> and<EM> Suchi </EM>are the <EM>animal electric
</EM>and solar fires, which create animals, and could thus furnish
but a physical living constitution to that first astral model
of man. The first creators, then, were the Pygmalions of primeval
man: they failed to animate the statue -<EM>- intellectually.</EM>

<P>
This Stanza we shall see is very suggestive. It explains the mystery
of, and fills the gap between, the informing principle in man

<P>
* It is not clear why &quot;<EM>Bhutas</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>should
be rendered by the Orientalists as meaning &quot;evil Spirits&quot;
in the Puranas. In the <EM>Vishnu Purana, </EM>Book I, ch. 5,
the Sloka simply says: &quot;Bhutas -- fiends, frightful from
being monkey-coloured and carnivorous&quot;; and the word in India
now means <EM>ghosts, </EM>ethereal or <EM>astral</EM> phantoms,
while in esoteric teaching it means <EM>elementary</EM> substances,
something made of attenuated, noncompound essence, and, specifically,
the astral <EM>double </EM>of any man or animal. In this case
these primitive men are the <EM>doubles </EM>of the first ethereal
Dhyanis or Pitris.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 103 THE DIVINE REBELS.</H6>

<P>
HIGHER SELF or human Monad -- and the animal Monad, both one and
the same, although the former is endowed with <EM>divine</EM>
intelligence, the latter with <EM>instinctual </EM>faculty alone.
How is the difference to be explained, and the presence of that
HIGHER SELF in man accounted for?
<P>
&quot;<EM>The Sons of </EM>MAHAT <EM>are the quickeners of the
human Plant. They are the Waters falling upon the arid soil of
latent life, and the Spark that vivifies the human animal. They
are the Lords of Spiritual Life eternal.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>.
. . .<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>In the beginning </EM>(in the Second
Race) <EM>some </EM>(of the Lords) <EM>only breathed of their
essence into Manushya </EM>(men);<EM> and some took in man their
abode.</EM>&quot;
<P>
This shows that not all men became incarnations of the &quot;divine
<EM>Rebels,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>but only a few among them. The
remainder had their fifth principle simply quickened by the spark
thrown into it, which accounts for the great difference between
the intellectual capacities of men and races. Had not the &quot;sons
of Mahat,&quot; speaking allegorically, skipped the intermediate
worlds, in their impulse toward intellectual freedom, the animal
man would never have been able to reach upward from this earth,
and attain through self-exertion his ultimate goal. The cyclic
pilgrimage would have to be performed through all the planes of
existence half unconsciously, if not entirely so, as in the case
of the animals. It is owing to this rebellion of intellectual
life against the morbid inactivity of pure spirit, that we are
what we are -- self-conscious, thinking men, with the capabilities
and attributes of Gods in us, for good as much as for evil. Hence
the REBELS are our saviours. Let the philosopher ponder well over
this, and more than one mystery will become clear to him. It is
only by the attractive force of the contrasts that the two opposites
-- Spirit and Matter -- can be cemented on Earth, and, smelted
in the fire of self-conscious experience and suffering, find themselves
wedded in Eternity. This will reveal the meaning of many hitherto
incomprehensible allegories, foolishly called &quot;fables.&quot;
(<EM>Vide infra, </EM>&quot;<EM>The Secret of Satan.</EM>&quot;)
<P>
It explains, to begin with, the statement made in Pymander: that
the &quot;heavenly MAN,&quot; the &quot;Son of the Father,&quot;
who partook of the nature and essence of the Seven Governors,
or <EM>creators </EM>and<EM> Rulers </EM>of the material world,
&quot;peeped through the <EM>Harmony </EM>and, breaking through
the <EM>Seven Circles of Fire, </EM>made manifest the downward-born
nature.&quot;* It explains every verse in that Hermetic narrative,
as also the Greek allegory of Prometheus. Most important of all,
it explains the many allegorical accounts about the &quot;Wars
in Heaven,&quot; including that of <EM>Revelation </EM>with respect
to the Christian dogma of the <EM>fallen angels.</EM> It<EM> </EM>explains
the &quot;rebellion&quot; of the oldest and highest Angels, and
the meaning of their being cast down from Heaven into the depths
of Hell,

<EM>i.e</EM>., MATTER. It even solves the recent perplexity of
the Assyriologists, who express their wonder through the late
George Smith.
<P>
&quot;My first idea of this part&quot; (of the rebellion), he
says, &quot;was that the wars with the powers of Evil <EM>preceded
the Creation</EM>;<EM> </EM>I<EM> </EM>now think it followed the
account of the fall&quot; (<EM>Chaldean Account of Genesis, </EM>p.
92). In this work Mr. George Smith gives an engraving, from an
early Babylonian cylinder, of the Sacred Tree, the Serpent, man
and woman. The tree has seven branches: <EM>three </EM>on the
man's side, <EM>four </EM>on that of the female. These branches
are typical of the seven Root-Races, in the <EM>third </EM>of
which, at its very close, occurred the separation of the sexes
and the so-called FALL into generation. The three earliest Races
were sexless, then hermaphrodite; the other four, male and female,
as distinct from each other. &quot;The Dragon,&quot; says Mr.
G. Smith, &quot;which in the Chaldean account of the creation
leads man to sin, is the creation of Tiamat, the living principle
of the Sea, or Chaos . . . which was opposed to the deities at
the creation of the world.&quot; This is an error. The Dragon
is the male principle, or Phallus, personified, or rather <EM>animalized</EM>;<EM>
</EM>and Tiamat, &quot;the embodiment of the Spirit of Chaos,&quot;
of the deep, or Abyss, is the female principle, the Womb. The
&quot;Spirit of<EM> Chaos </EM>and<EM> Disorder</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>refers to the mental perturbation which it led to. It is
the sensual, attractive, magnetic principle which fascinates and
seduces, the ever living active element which throws the whole
world into disorder, chaos, and sin. The Serpent seduces the woman,
but it is the latter who seduces man, and both are included in
the Karmic curse, though only as a natural result of a cause produced.
Says George Smith: &quot;It is clear that the Dragon is included
in the curse for the Fall, and that the Gods&quot; (the Elohim,
jealous at seeing the man of clay becoming a Creator in his turn,
like all the animals,) &quot;invoke on the head of the human Race
all the evils which afflict humanity. Wisdom and knowledge shall
injure him, he shall have family quarrels, he will anger the gods,
he shall submit to tyranny. . . . he shall be disappointed in
his desires, he shall pour out<EM> useless prayers, </EM>he shall
commit future sin. . No doubt subsequent lines continue this topic,
but again our narrative is broken, and it re-opens only where
the gods are preparing for war with the powers of evil, which
are led by Tiamat (the woman). . . . &quot; (<EM>Babylonian Legend
of Creation, </EM>p. 92.)
<P>
This account is omitted in <EM>Genesis, </EM>for monotheistic
purposes. But it is a mistaken policy -- born no doubt of fear,
and regard for dogmatic religion and its superstitions -- to have
sought to restore the Chaldean fragments by <EM>Genesis, </EM>whereas
it is the latter, far younger than any of the fragments, which
ought to be explained by the former.

<P>
As a full explanation is found in Stanza V. (<EM>Vide</EM> paragraph
(<EM>a</EM>)), a few remarks will now suffice. The &quot;Father&quot;
of primitive physical man, or of his body, is the vital electric
principle residing in the Sun. The Moon is its Mother, because
of that mysterious power in the Moon which has as decided an influence
upon human gestation and generation, which it regulates, as it
has on the growth of plants and animals. The &quot;Wind&quot;
or Ether, standing in this case for the agent of transmission
by which those influences are carried down from the two luminaries
and diffused upon Earth, is referred to as the &quot;nurse&quot;;
while &quot;Spiritual Fire&quot; alone makes of man a divine and
perfect entity.
<P>
Now what is that &quot;Spiritual Fire&quot;? In alchemy it is
HYDROGEN, in general; while in esoteric actuality it is the emanation
or the Ray which proceeds from its <EM>noumenon, </EM>the &quot;Dhyan
of the first Element.&quot; Hydrogen is <EM>gas </EM>only on our
terrestrial plane. But even in chemistry hydrogen &quot;would
be the only existing form of matter, in our sense of the term,&quot;*
and is very nearly allied to <EM>protyle, </EM>which is our <EM>layam.
</EM>It is the father and generator, so to say, or rather the
<EM>Upadhi </EM>(basis), of both AIR and WATER, and is &quot;fire,
air and water,&quot; in fact: <EM>one</EM> under three aspects;
hence the chemical and alchemical trinity. In the world of manifestation
or matter it is the objective symbol and the material emanation
from the subjective and purely spiritual entitative Being in the
region of <EM>noumena. </EM>Well might Godfrey Higgins have compared
Hydrogen to, and even identified it with, the To ON, the &quot;One&quot;
of the Greeks. For, as he remarks, Hydrogen is <EM>not</EM> Water,
though it generates it; Hydrogen is not fire, though it manifests
or creates it; nor is it Air, though air may be regarded as a
product of the union of Water and

<P>
Fire -- since Hydrogen is found in the aqueous element of the
atmosphere. It is three in one.
<P>
If one studies comparative Theogony, it is easy to find that the
secret of these &quot;Fires&quot; was taught in the <EM>Mysteries
</EM>of every ancient people, pre-eminently in Samothrace. There
is not the smallest doubt that the Kabeiri, the most arcane of
all the ancient deities, gods and men, great deities and Titans,
are identical with the Kumaras and Rudras headed by Kartikeya
-- a Kumara also. This is quite evident even exoterically; and
these Hindu deities were, like the Kabeiri, the<EM> personified
sacred Fires of the most occult powers of Nature. The </EM>several
branches of the Aryan Race, the Asiatic and the European, the
Hindu and the Greek, did their best to conceal their true nature,
if not their importance. As in the case of the Kumaras, the number
of the Kabeiri is uncertain. Some say that there were three or
four only; others say seven. Aschieros, Achiosersa, Achiochersus,
and Camillus may very well stand for the <EM>alter egos </EM>of
the four Kumaras -- Sanat-Kumara, Sananda, Sanaka, and Sanatana.
The former deities, whose reputed father was Vulcan, were often
confounded with the Dioscuri, Corybantes, Anaces, etc.; just as
the Kumara, whose reputed father is Brahma, (or rather, the &quot;Flame
of his Wrath,&quot; which prompted him to perform the ninth or
Kumara creation, resulting in Rudra or Nilalohita (Siva) and the
Kumaras), were confounded with the Asuras, the Rudras, and the
Pitris, for the simple reason that they are all one -- <EM>i.e.</EM>,
correlative Forces and Fires. There is no space to describe these
&quot;fires&quot; and their real meaning here, though we may attempt
to do so if the third and fourth volumes of this work are ever
published. Meanwhile a few more explanations may be added.
<P>
The foregoing are all mysteries which must be left to the personal
intuition of the student for solution, rather than described.
If he would learn something of the secret of the FIRES, let him
turn to certain works of the Alchemists, who very correctly connect
fire with every element, as do the Occultists. The reader must
remember that the ancients considered religion, and the natural
sciences along with philosophy, to be closely and inseparably
linked together. AEsculapius was the Son of Apollo -- the Sun
or FIRE of Life; at once <EM>Helios, Pythios, </EM>and the god
of oracular Wisdom. In exoteric religions, as much as in esoteric
philosophy, the Elements -- especially fire, water, and air --
are made the progenitors of our <EM>five</EM> <EM>physical senses,
</EM>and hence are directly connected (in an occult way) with
them. These physical senses pertain even to a lower creation than
the one called in the Puranas <EM>Pratisarga, </EM>or secondary
Creation. &quot;Liquid fire proceeds from indiscrete fire,&quot;
says an Occult axiom.
<P>
&quot;The Circle is the THOUGHT; the diameter (or the line) is
the WORD;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 107 BATH-KOL, DAUGHTER OF THE VOICE.</H6>

<P>
and their union is LIFE.&quot; In the Kabala, Bath-Kol is the
daughter of the <EM>Divine Voice, </EM>or primordial light, Shekinah.
In the Puranas and Hindu exotericism, Vach (the Voice) is the
female <EM>Logos </EM>of Brahma -- a permutation of Aditi, <EM>primordial
light. </EM>And if Bath-Kol, in Jewish mysticism, is an articulate
praeternatural voice from heaven, revealing to the &quot;chosen
people&quot; the sacred traditions and laws, it is only because
Vach was called, before Judaism, the &quot;Mother of the Vedas,&quot;
who entered into the Rishis and inspired them by her revelations;
just as Bath-Kol is said to have inspired the prophets of Israel
and the Jewish High-Priests. And both exist to this day, in their
respective sacred symbologies, because the ancients associated
sound or Speech with the Ether of Space, of which Sound is the
characteristic. Hence Fire, Water and Air are the primordial Cosmic
Trinity. &quot;I am thy Thought, thy God, more ancient than the
moist principle, the <EM>light that radiates within Darkness </EM>(Chaos),
and the shining <EM>Word </EM>of God (Sound) is the Son of the
Deity.&quot; (&quot;Pymander,&quot; &#167; 6.)*
<P>
Thus we have to study well the &quot;Primary creation,&quot; before
we can understand the Secondary. The first Race had three <EM>rudimentary
</EM>elements in it; and <EM>no fire </EM>as yet; because, with
the Ancients, the evolution of man, and the growth and development
of his spiritual and physical senses, were subordinate to the
evolution of the elements on the Cosmic plane of this Earth. All
proceeds from <EM>Prabhavapyaya, </EM>the evolution of the creative
and sentient principles in the gods, and even of the so-called
creative deity himself. This is found in the names and appellations
given to Vishnu in exoteric scriptures. As the <EM>Protologos
</EM>(the<EM> </EM>Orphic), he is called <EM>Purvaja, </EM>&quot;pregenetic,&quot;
and then the other names connect him in their descending order
more and more with matter.
<P>
The following order on parallel lines may be found in the evolution
of the Elements and the Senses; or in Cosmic terrestrial &quot;MAN&quot;
or &quot;Spirit,&quot; and mortal physical man: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Ether ... Hearing ... Sound.<BR>
2. Air ... Touch ... Sound and Touch.<BR>

predecessor; as each Root-Race adds the characterizing sense of
the preceding Race. The same is true in the <EM>septenary </EM>creation
of man, who evolves gradually in seven stages, and on the same
principles, as will be shown further on.
<P>
Thus, while Gods or Dhyan Chohans (Devas) proceed from the First
Cause -- which is not Parabrahm, for the latter is the ALL CAUSE,
and cannot be referred to as the &quot;<EM>First </EM>Cause,&quot;
-- which First Cause is called in the Brahmanical Books Jagad-Yoni,
&quot;the womb of the world,&quot; mankind emanates from these
active agents in Kosmos. But men, during the first and the second
races, were not physical beings, but merely <EM>rudiments </EM>of
the future men: <EM>Bhutas, </EM>which proceeded from Bhutadi,
&quot;origin,&quot; or the &quot;original place whence sprung
the Elements.&quot; Hence they proceeded with all the rest from
<EM>Prabhavapyaya, </EM>&quot;the place whence is the origination,
and into which is the resolution of all things,&quot; as explained
by the Commentator. Whence also our physical senses. Whence even
the highest &quot;created&quot; deity itself, in our philosophy.
As one with the Universe, whether we call him Brahma, Iswara,
or Purusha, he is a manifested deity, -- hence created, or limited
and conditioned. This is easily proven, even from the exoteric
teachings.

After being called the <EM>incognizable, </EM>eternal Brahma (neuter

or &quot;immutable&quot; Nature, he is addressed as <EM>Ekanaka-Rupa,

merged with his own effects; and his names, if placed in esoteric
order, show the following descending scale: --
