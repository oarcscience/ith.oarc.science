OF THE <STRONG>E</STRONG>GYPTOLOGISTS. </H4>

<P>
If one turns to those wells of information, &quot;<EM>The Natural
Genesis</EM>&quot; and the<EM> Lectures </EM>of Mr. Gerald Massey,
the proofs of the antiquity of the doctrine under analysis become
positively overwhelming. That the belief of the author differs
from ours can hardly invalidate the facts. He views the symbol
from a purely natural standpoint, one perhaps a trifle too materialistic,
because too much that of an ardent Evolutionist and follower of
the modern Darwinian dogmas. Thus he shows that &quot;the student
of Bohme's books finds much in them concerning these Seven Fountain
Spirits and primary powers, treated as seven properties of nature
in the alchemistic and astrological phase of the mediaeval mysteries;&quot;*
and adds --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The followers of Bohme look on such matter as divine revelation
of his inspired Seership. They know nothing of the natural genesis,
the history and persistence of the Wisdom** of the past (or of
the broken links), and are unable to recognise the physical features
of the ancient Seven Spirits beneath their modern metaphysical
or alchemist mask. A second connecting link between the Theosophy
of Bohme and the physical origins of Egyptian thought, is extant
in the fragments of <EM>Hermes Trismegistus.*** </EM>No matter
whether these teachings are called Illuminatist, Buddhist, Kabalist,
Gnostic, Masonic, or Christian, the elemental types can only be
truly known in their beginnings.**** When the prophets or visionary
showmen of cloudland come to us claiming original inspiration,
and utter something new, we judge of its value by what it is in
itself. But if we find they bring us the ancient matter which
they cannot account for, and we can, it is natural that we should
judge it by the primary significations rather than the latest
pretensions.***** It is useless for us to read our

have never claimed,&quot; (original inspiration,&quot; not even

later thought into the earliest types of expression, and then
say the ancients meant that.* Subtilized interpretations which
have become doctrines and dogmas in theosophy have now to be tested
by their genesis in physical phenomena, in order that we may explode
their false pretensions to supernatural origin or supernatural
knowledge.*
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
But the able author of the &quot;Book of the Beginnings&quot;
and of &quot;<EM>The</EM> <EM>Natural Genesis</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>does
-- very fortunately, for us -- quite the reverse. He demonstrates
most triumphantly our Esoteric (Buddhist) teachings, by showing
them identical with those of Egypt. Let the reader judge from
his learned lecture on &quot;The Seven Souls of Man.&quot;** Says
the author: --
<P>
&quot;The first form of the mystical <STRONG>S</STRONG>EVEN was
seen to be figured in heaven by the Seven large stars of the <EM>great
Bear, </EM>the constellation assigned by the Egyptians to the
Mother of Time, and of the Seven Elemental Powers.&quot;
<P>
Just so, for the Hindus place in the <EM>great Bear </EM>their
seven primitive Rishis and call this constellation the abode of
the <EM>Saptarishi, Riksha</EM> and <EM>Chitra-Sikhandinas. </EM>But
whether it is only an astronomical myth or a primordial mystery,
having a deeper meaning than it bears on its surface, is what
their adepts claim to know. We are also told that &quot;the Egyptians
divided the face of the sky by night into seven parts. The primary
Heaven was seven-fold.&quot; So it was with the Aryans. One has
but read the Puranas about the beginnings of Brahma, and his &quot;Egg&quot;
to see it. Have the Aryans taken the idea from the Egyptians?
-- &quot;The earliest forces,&quot; proceeds the lecturer, &quot;recognized
in nature were reckoned as seven in number. These became seven
elementals, devils (?) or later, divinities. Seven properties
were assigned to nature, as
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
[[Continued from previous page]] countries, older even than Egypt;
<EM>significations, </EM>moreover, which emanate from a hierarchy
(or hierarchies, if preferred) of <EM>living wise men</EM>, mortals,
notwithstanding that Wisdom, who reject every approach to <EM>supernaturalism.</EM>

<P>
* But where is the proof that the ancients did not mean precisely
that which the theosophists claim? Records exist for what they
say, just as other records exist for what Mr. G. Massey says.
His interpretations are very correct, but equally one-sided. Surely
nature has more than one <EM>physical aspect; </EM>for astronomy,
astrology, and so on, are all on the physical, not the spiritual
plane.
<P>
** It is to be feared that Mr. Massey has not succeeded. We have
our followers as he has his followers, and materialistic Science
steps in and takes little account of both his and our speculations!
<P>
The fact that this learned Egyptologist does not recognise in
the doctrine of the &quot;Seven Souls,&quot; as he terms our <EM>principles,
</EM>or &quot;metaphysical concepts,&quot; but &quot;the primitive
biology or physiology of the Soul,&quot; does not invalidate our
argument. The lecturer touches on only two keys, those that unlock
the astronomical and the physiological mysteries of esotericism,
and leaves out the other five. Otherwise he would have promptly
understood that what he calls the <EM>physiological </EM>divisions
of the living Soul of man, are regarded by theosophists as also
psychological and spiritual.<HR>

<P>
[[Vol. 2, Page]] 632 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.
<P>
matter, cohesion, fluxion, coagulation, accumulation, station,
and division and <EM>seven elements or souls to man.</EM>&quot;<I>
</I>
<P>
All this was taught in the esoteric doctrine, but it was interpreted
and its mysteries unlocked, as already stated, with <EM>seven,
</EM>not two, or at the utmost, three keys; hence the causes and
their effects worked in invisible or mystic as well as psychic
nature, and were made referable to metaphysics and psychology
as much as to physiology. &quot;The principle of <EM>sevening</EM>&quot;<EM>
-- </EM>as the author says -- &quot;was introduced, and the number
seven supplied a sacred type <EM>that could be used for manifold
purposes</EM>&quot;<EM>; </EM>and it was so used. For &quot;the
seven Souls of the Pharaoh are often mentioned in the Egyptian
texts. . . . <EM>Seven Souls or principles in man were</EM> <EM>identified
by our British Druids</EM>. . . . . The Rabbins also ran the number
of souls up to seven; so, likewise, do the Karens of India. .
. .&quot;
<P>
And then, the author tabulates the two teachings -- the Esoteric
and the Egyptian, -- and shows that the latter had the same series
and in the same order.
<P>
<IMG SRC="sd2-632.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
Further on, the lecturer formulates these seven (Egyptian) souls,
as (1) The Soul of Blood -- the<EM> formative</EM>; (2)<EM> </EM>The
Soul of Breath -- &quot;that <EM>breathes</EM>&quot;;<EM> </EM>(3)<EM>
</EM>The Shade or Covering Soul -- &quot;that <EM>envelopes</EM>&quot;;<EM>
</EM>(4) The Soul of Perception -- &quot;that <EM>perceives</EM>;&quot;<EM>
</EM>(5)<EM> </EM>The Soul of Pubescence &quot;that <EM>procreates</EM>&quot;;<EM>
</EM>(6) The Intellectual Soul -- &quot;that<EM> reproduces intellectually</EM>&quot;;<EM>
</EM>and (7) The Spiritual Soul -- &quot;that is <EM>perpetuated
permanently.</EM>&quot;
<P>
From the exoteric and physiological standpoint this may be very
correct; it becomes less so from the esoteric point of view. To
maintain this, does not at all mean that the &quot;Esoteric Buddhists&quot;
<EM>resolve men into</EM> <EM>a number of elementary Spirits,
</EM>as Mr. G. Massey, in the same lecture, accuses them of maintaining.
No &quot;Esoteric Buddhist&quot; has ever been guilty of any such
absurdity. Nor has it been ever imagined that these shadows &quot;become
spiritual beings in another world,&quot; or &quot;seven potential
spirits or elementaries of another life.&quot; What is maintained
is simply that every time the immortal <EM>Ego</EM> incarnates
it becomes, as a total, a com-
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* This is a great mistake made in the Esoteric enumeration. Manas
is the fifth, not the fourth; and <EM>Manas </EM>corresponds precisely
with <EM>Seb, </EM>the Egyptian fifth principle, for that portion
of Manas, which follows the two higher principles, is the ancestral
soul, indeed, the bright, immortal thread of the higher Ego, to
which clings the Spiritual aroma of all the lives or births.<HR>

METAPHYSICS.</H6>

<P>
pound unit of Matter and Spirit, which together act on seven different
planes of being and consciousness. Elsewhere, Mr. G. Massey adds:
-- &quot;The seven souls (our &quot;Principles&quot;) are often
mentioned in the Egyptian texts. The moon god, Taht-Esmun, or
the later sun god, expressed the seven nature-powers that were
prior to himself, and were summed up in him as his seven souls
(we say &quot;principles&quot;) . . . . The seven stars in the
hand of Christ in the Revelation, have the same significance,&quot;
etc.
<P>
And a still greater one, as these stars represent also the <EM>seven
keys </EM>of the Seven Churches or the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ODALIAN
<STRONG>M</STRONG>YSTERIES, cabalistically. However, we will not
stop to discuss, but add that other Egyptologists have also found
out that the septenary constitution of man was a cardinal doctrine
with the old Egyptians. In a series of remarkable articles in
the &quot;Sphinx&quot; (Munich) Herr Franz Lambert gives incontrovertible
proof of his conclusions from the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;
and other Egyptian records. For details the reader must be referred
to the articles themselves, but the following diagram, summing
up the author's conclusions, is demonstrative evidence of the
identity of Egyptian psychology with the septenary division in
&quot;Esoteric Buddhism.&quot;
<P>
On the left hand side the Kabalistic names of the corresponding
human principles are placed, and on the right the hieroglyphic
names with their renderings as in the diagram of F. Lambert.
<P>
<IMG SRC="sd2-633.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">

</H6>

<P>
* There seems a confusion -- lasting for many centuries -- in
the minds of Western Kabalists. They call <EM>Ruach </EM>(Spirit)
what we call <EM>Kama</EM>-rupa; whereas, with us Ruach would
be the &quot;Spiritual Soul&quot; <EM>Buddhi,</EM> and<EM> Nephesh
</EM>the 4th principle, the Vital, Animal Soul. Eliphas Levi falls
into the same error.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 634 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
This is a very fair representation of the number of the &quot;principles&quot;
of Occultism, but much confused; and this is what we call the
7 principles in man, and what Mr. Massey calls &quot;Souls,&quot;
giving the same name to the Ego or the <EM>Monad </EM>which reincarnates
and <EM>resurrects, </EM>so to speak, at each rebirth, as the
Egyptians did, namely -- &quot;the Renewed.&quot; But how can
Ruach (Spirit) be lodged in Kama-rupa? What does Bohme, the Prince
of all the mediaeval Seers, say?
<P>
&quot;We find Seven especial properties in nature whereby this
only Mother works all things&quot; (which he calls -- fire, light,
sound (the upper three) and <EM>desire, bitterness, anguish, </EM>and<EM>
substantiality, </EM>thus analysing the lower in his own mystic
way) . . . &quot;whatever the six forms are spiritually, that
the seventh, the body (or substantiality), is essentially.&quot;
These are the seven forms of the Mother of all Beings from whence
all that is in this world is generated,* and again in <EM>Aurora
xxiv. p. </EM>27 (quoted in <EM>Natural Genesis</EM>)<EM> -- </EM>&quot;The
Creator hath in the body of this world generated himself as it
were <EM>creaturely </EM>in his qualifying Fountain Spirits, and
all the stars are . . . God's powers, and the whole body of the
world consisteth in the seven qualifying or Fountain Spirits.&quot;
<P>
This is rendering in mystical language our theosophical doctrine.
. . But how can we agree with Mr. G. Massey when he states that
--
<P>
&quot;The Seven <EM>Races </EM>of men that have been sublimated
and made Planetary (?) by Esoteric Buddhism,** may be met with
in the Bundahish as (1) the earth-men; (2) water-men; (3) breast-eared
men; (4) breast-eyed men; (5) one-legged men; (6) bat-winged men;
(7) men with tails.&quot; . . . Each of these descriptions, allegorical
and even perverted in their later form -- is, nevertheless, an
echo of the Secret Doctrine teaching. They all refer to the pre-Human
evolution of the water-men &quot;terrible and bad&quot; by <EM>unaided
</EM>Nature through millions of years, as previously described.
But we deny point blank the assertion made that &quot;these were
never real races,&quot; and point to the Archaic Stanzas for our
answer. It is easy to infer and to say that our &quot;instructors
have mistaken these shadows of the Past, for things human and
spiritual&quot;; but that &quot;they are neither, and never were
either,&quot; it is less easy to prove. The assertion must ever
remain on a par with the Darwinian claim that man and the ape
had a common pithecoid ancestor. What the Lecturer takes for a
&quot;mode of expression&quot; and nothing more, in the Egyptian
Ritual, we take as having quite another and an important meaning.
Here is one instance. Says the Ritual, the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;

</EM>Of these last two sentences, one: &quot;whose soul comes

&quot;<EM>that is, as a type</EM> <EM>of intelligence,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>and the other: &quot;<EM>I am the Soul of the Gods,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>as meaning, &quot;the Horus, or Christ, as the outcome of
all.&quot;
<P>
The occult teaching answers: &quot;It means far more.&quot; .
. .
<P>
It gives first of all a corroboration of the teaching that, while
the human monad has passed on globe <EM>A</EM> and others, in
the First Round, through all the three kingdoms -- the mineral,
the vegetable, and the animal -- in this our Fourth Round, every
mammal has sprung from Man if the semi-ethereal, many-shaped creature
with the <EM>human </EM>Monad in it, of the first two races, can
be regarded as Man. But it must be so called; for, in the esoteric
language, it is not the form of flesh, blood, and bones, now referred
to as Man, which is in any way the <STRONG>M</STRONG>AN, but the
inner divine <STRONG>M</STRONG>ONAD with its manifold principles
or aspects.
<P>
The lecture referred to, however, much as it opposes &quot;Esoteric
Buddhism&quot; and its teachings, is an eloquent answer to those
who have tried to represent the whole as a newfangled doctrine.
And there are many such, in Europe, America, and even India. Yet,
between the esotericism of the old Arhats, and that which has
now survived in India among the few Brahmins who have seriously
studied their Secret Philosophy, the difference does not appear
so very great. It seems centred in, and limited to, the question
of the order of the evolution of cosmic and other principles,
more than anything else. At all events it is no greater divergence
than the everlasting question of the <EM>filioque </EM>dogma,
which since the <STRONG>XII</STRONG>th. century has separated
the Roman Catholic from the older Greek Eastern Church. Yet, whatever
the differences in the forms in which the septenary dogma is presented,
the substance is there, and its presence and importance in the
Brahminical system may be judged by what one of India's learned
metaphysicians and Vedantic scholars says of it: --
<P>
&quot;The real esoteric seven-fold classification is one of the
most important, if not the most important classification, which
has received its arrangement from the mysterious constitution
of this eternal type. I may also mention in this connection that
the four-fold classification claims the same origin. The light
of life, as it were, seems to be refracted by the treble-faced
prism of Prakriti, having the three Gunams for its three faces,
and divided into seven rays, which develop in course of time the
seven principles of this classification. The progress of development
presents some points of similarity to the gradual development
of the rays of the spectrum. While the four-fold classification
is amply<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 636 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
sufficient for all practical purposes, this real seven-fold classification
is of great theoretical and scientific importance. It will be
necessary to adopt it to explain certain classes of phenomena
noticed by occultists; and it is perhaps better fitted to be the
basis of a perfect system of psychology. It is not the peculiar
property of 'the trans-Himalayan esoteric doctrine.' In fact,
it has a closer connection with the Brahminical Logos than with
the Buddhist Logos. In order to make my meaning clear I may point
out here that the Logos has seven forms. In other words, there
are seven kinds of Logoi in the Cosmos. Each of these has become
the central figure of one of the seven main branches of the ancient
Wisdom-religion. This classification is not the seven-fold classification
we have adopted. I make this assertion without the slightest fear
of contradiction. The real classification has all the requisites
of a scientific classification. It has seven distinct principles,
which correspond with seven distinct states of Pragna or consciousness.
It bridges the gulf between the objective and subjective, and
indicates the mysterious circuit through which ideation passes.
The seven principles are allied to seven states of matter, and
to seven forms of force. These principles are harmoniously arranged
between two poles, which define the limits of <EM>human</EM> consciousness.&quot;*
<P>
The above is perfectly correct, save, perhaps, one point. The
&quot;sevenfold classification&quot; in the esoteric system has
never been claimed (to the writer's knowledge) by any one belonging
to it, as &quot;the peculiar property of the Trans-Himalayan esoteric
doctrine&quot;; but only as having survived in that old school
alone. It is no more the property of the<EM> trans, </EM>than
it is of the <EM>cis</EM>-Himalayan esoteric doctrine, but is
simply the common inheritance of all such schools, left to the
sages of the Fifth Root Race by the great Siddhas** of the Fourth.
Let us remember that the Atlanteans became the terrible sorcerers,
now celebrated in so many of the oldest <STRONG>MSS</STRONG>.
of India, only toward their fall, the submersion of their continent
having been brought on by it. What is claimed is simply the fact
that the wisdom imparted by the &quot;Divine Ones&quot; -- born
through the <EM>Kriyasakti powers </EM>of the Third Race before
its Fall and Separation into sexes -- to the adepts of the early
Fourth Race, has remained in all its pristine purity in a certain
Brotherhood. The said

plane than our own, who voluntarily incarnate in mortal bodies

School or Fraternity being closely connected with a certain island
of an inland sea, believed in by both Hindus and Buddhists, but
called &quot;mythical&quot; by geographers and Orientalists, the
less one talks of it, the wiser he will be. Nor can one accept
the said &quot;sevenfold classification&quot; as having &quot;a
closer connection with the Brahminical Logos than with the Buddhist
Logos,&quot; since both are identical, whether the one &quot;Logos&quot;
is called <EM>Eswara </EM>or<EM> Avalokiteswara, </EM>Brahma or
Padmapani. These are, however, very small differences, more fanciful
than real, in fact. Brahmanism and Buddhism, both viewed from
their orthodox aspects, are as inimical and as irreconcilable
as water and oil. Each of these great bodies, however, has a vulnerable
place in its constitution. While even in their esoteric interpretation
both can agree but to disagree, once that their respective vulnerable
points are confronted, every disagreement must fall, for the two
will find themselves on common ground. The &quot;heel of Achilles&quot;
of orthodox Brahmanism is the Adwaita philosophy, whose followers
are called by the pious &quot;Buddhists in disguise&quot;; as
that of orthodox Buddhism is Northern mysticism, as represented
by the disciples of the philosophies of Aryasanga (the Yogacharya
School) and Mahayana, who are twitted in their turn by their correligionists
as &quot;Vedantins in disguise.&quot; The esoteric philosophy
of both these can be but one if carefully analysed and compared,
as Gautama Buddha and Sankaracharya are most closely connected,
if one believes tradition and certain esoteric teachings. Thus
every difference between the two will be found one of form rather
than of substance.
<P>
A most mystic discourse, full of septenary symbology, may be found
in the <EM>Anugita.* </EM>There the Brahmana narrates the bliss
of having crossed beyond the regions of illusion, &quot;in which
fancies are the gadflies and mosquitoes, in which grief and joy
are cold and heat, in which delusion is the blinding darkness,
avarice, the beasts of prey and reptiles, and desire and anger
are the obstructors.&quot; . . . . The sage describes the entrance
into and exit from the forest (a symbol for man's life-time) and
also that forest itself:**
<P>
&quot;In that forest are seven large trees (the Senses, Mind and
Understanding, or Manas and Buddhi included), seven fruits and
seven guests; seven hermitages, seven (forms of) concentration,
and seven (forms of) initiation. This is the description of the
forest. That forest is filled with trees producing splendid flowers
and fruits of five colours.&quot;

<P>
** I propose to follow here the text and the editor's commentaries,
who accepts Arjuna Misra and Nilakantha's <EM>dead-letter explanations.
</EM>Our Orientalists never trouble to think that if a native
commentator is a non-initiate, he could not explain correctly,
and if an <EM>Initiate, </EM>would not.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 638 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
&quot;The senses,&quot; says the commentator, &quot;are called
trees, as being producers of the fruits . . . . pleasures and
pains; the <EM>guests </EM>are the powers of each sense personified
-- they receive the fruits above described; the hermitages are
the trees, in which the guests take shelter. The seven forms of
concentration are the exclusion from the self of the seven functions
of the seven senses, etc., already referred to; the seven forms
of initiation refer to the initiation into the higher life . .
. by repudiating as not one's own the actions of each member out
of the group of seven.&quot; (See Khandagya, p. 219, and Com.)
<P>
The explanation is harmless, if unsatisfactory.
<P>
Says the Brahmana continuing his description: --
<P>
&quot;That forest is filled with trees producing flowers and fruits
of four colours. That forest is filled with trees producing flowers
and fruits of three colours, and mixed. That forest is filled
with trees producing flowers and fruits of two colours, and of
beautiful colours. That forest is filled with trees producing
flowers and fruits of one colour and fragrant. That forest is
filled (instead of seven) with two large trees producing numerous
flowers and fruits of undistinguished colours (<EM>mind and understanding
-- the two higher senses, </EM>or theosophically, 'Manas-Buddhi').
Here is one Fire (Self) here connected with the Brahman* and having
a good mind (or <EM>true knowledge, </EM>according to Arjuna Misra).
And there is fuel here, namely, the five senses (or human passions).
The Seven (<EM>forms of</EM>)<EM> </EM>emancipation from them
are the Seven (<EM>forms of</EM>)<EM> </EM>initiation. The qualities
are the fruits. . . . There, the great Sages receive hospitality.
And when they have been worshipped and have disappeared, another
forest shines forth, in which <EM>intelligence is the tree, </EM>and
emancipation the fruit, and which possesses shade (<EM>in the
form of</EM>)<EM> </EM>tranquillity, which depends on Knowledge,
which has contentment for its water, and the <STRONG>K</STRONG>SHETRAGNA
(the &quot;<EM>Supreme </EM><STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF,&quot; says
Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita, p. 102<EM> et seq.</EM>) within
for the Sun.&quot;
<P>
Now, all the above is very plain, and no theosophist, even among
the least learned, could fail to understand the allegory. And
yet, we see great Orientalists making a perfect mess of it in
their explanations. The &quot;great sages&quot; who &quot;receive
hospitality&quot; are explained as meaning <EM>the senses, </EM>&quot;which,
having worked <EM>as unconnected with the self </EM>are finally
absorbed into it.&quot; But one fails to understand, if the senses
are &quot;unconnected&quot; with the &quot;Higher Self,&quot;
in what manner can they be
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The English editor explains here, saying, &quot;I presume devoted
to the Brahman.&quot; This would be a very poor devotion, indeed,
in the accomplishment of the gradually emancipating process of
Yoga. We venture to say that the &quot;Fire&quot; or Self is the
higher real <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF &quot;connected with,&quot;
that is to say <EM>one with Brahma, </EM>the One Deity. The &quot;Self&quot;
separates itself no longer from the universal Spirit.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 639 THE ALLEGORY EXPLAINED. </H6>

&quot;absorbed into it.&quot; One would think, on the contrary,
that just because the personal senses gravitate and strive to
be connected with the <EM>impersonal </EM>Self, that the latter,
which is <STRONG>F</STRONG>IRE, burns the lower five and purifies
thereby the higher two, &quot;mind and understanding&quot; or
the higher aspects of <EM>Manas* </EM>and<EM> Buddhi. </EM>This<EM>
</EM>is quite apparent from the text. The &quot;great sages&quot;
<EM>disappear </EM>after having &quot;been worshipped.&quot; Worshipped
by whom if they (the presumed senses) are &quot;unconnected with
the self&quot;? By<STRONG> M</STRONG>IND, of course; by Manas
(in this case merged in the <EM>sixth sense</EM>)<EM> </EM>which
is not, and cannot be, the Brahman, the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF,
or Kshetragna -- the soul's spiritual sun. Into the latter, in
time, Manas itself must be absorbed. It has worshipped &quot;great
sages&quot; and given hospitality to <EM>terrestrial </EM>wisdom:
but once that &quot;another forest shone forth&quot; upon it,
it is Intelligence (Buddhi, the 7th sense, but 6th principle)
which is transformed into <EM>the</EM> tree -- that tree whose
fruit is emancipation -- which finally destroys the very roots
of the Aswattha tree, the symbol of <EM>life </EM>and of its illusive
joys and pleasures. And therefore, those who attain to that state
of emancipation have, in the words of the above-cited sage, &quot;no
fear afterwards.&quot; In this state &quot;the end cannot be perceived
because it extends on all sides.&quot;
<P>
&quot;There always dwell seven females there,&quot; he goes on
to say, carrying out the imagery. These females, who, according
to Arjuna Misra, are the Mahat, Ahamkara and five Tanmatras, have
always their faces turned downwards, as they are obstacles in
the way of spiritual ascension.
<P>
&quot;<EM> </EM>. . . . In that same (Brahman, the 'Self') the
Seven perfect Sages, together with their chiefs, abide and again
emerge from the same. Glory, brilliance and greatness, enlightenment,
victory, perfection and power -- these seven rays follow after
this same Sun (Kshetragna, the Higher Self). . . . Those whose
wishes are reduced (unselfish). . . . whose sins (passions) are
burnt up by restraint, merging the Self in the Self,t**devote
themselves to Brahman. Those people who understand the forest
of Knowledge (Brahman, or <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF) praise tranquillity.
And aspiring to that forest, they are (re-) born so as not to
lose courage.

* As Mahat (universal intelligence) is first born, or manifests,
as Vishnu, and then, when it falls into matter and develops self-consciousness,
it becomes Egoism, Selfishness, so <EM>Manas </EM>is of a dual
nature. It is respectively under the sun and moon, for as Sankaracharya
says &quot;The moon is the mind, and the sun the understanding.&quot;
The sun and moon are the deities of our planetary Macrocosmos,
and therefore Sankara adds that &quot;the mind and the understanding
are the respective deities of the (human) organs&quot; (<EM>vide</EM>
Brihadaranyaka, pp. 521,<EM> et seq</EM>.) This is perhaps why
Arjuna Misra says that the moon and the <EM>Fire </EM>(the self,
the sun) constitute the universe.
<P>
** &quot;The body in the Soul,&quot; as Arjuna Misra is credited
with saying, or rather the &quot;Soul in the Spirit,&quot; and
on a still higher plane of development: &quot;the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF
or Atman in the Universal Self.&quot;<HR>

Such indeed, is this holy forest . . . . and understanding it,
they (the Sages) act accordingly, being directed by the <STRONG>K</STRONG>SHETRAGNA.
. . . &quot;
<P>
No translator among the Western Orientalists has yet perceived
in the foregoing allegory anything higher than mysteries connected
with sacrificial ritualism, penance, or ascetic ceremonies, and
<EM>Hatha Yoga. </EM>But he who understands symbolical imagery,
and hears the voice of <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF WITHIN <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF,
will see in this something far higher than mere ritualism, however
often he may err in minor details of the philosophy.
<P>
And here, we must be allowed a last remark. No true theosophist,
from the most ignorant up to the most learned, ought to claim
infallibility for anything he may say or write upon occult matters.
The chief point is to admit that, in many a way, in the classification
of either cosmic or human principles, in addition to mistakes
in the order of evolution, and especially on metaphysical questions,
those of us who pretend to teach others more ignorant than ourselves
-- are all liable to err. Thus mistakes have been made in &quot;Isis
Unveiled,&quot; in &quot;Esoteric Buddhism,&quot; in &quot;Man,&quot;
in &quot;Magic: White and Black,&quot; etc., etc.; and more than
one mistake is likely to be found in the present work. This cannot
be helped. For a large or even a small work on such abstruse subjects
to be entirely exempt from error and blunder, it would have to
be written from its first to its last page by a great adept, if
not by an Avatar. Then only should we say, &quot;This is verily
a work without sin or blemish in it!&quot; But, so long as the
artist is imperfect, how can his work be perfect? &quot;Endless
is the search for truth!&quot; Let us love it and aspire to it
for its own sake, and not for the glory or benefit a minute portion
of its revelation may confer on us. For who of us can presume
to have the <EM>whole </EM>truth at his fingers' ends, even upon
one minor teaching of Occultism?
<P>
Our chief point in the present subject, however, was to show that
the Septenary doctrine, or division of the constitution of man,
was a very ancient one, and was not invented by us. This has been
successfully done, for we are supported in this, consciously and
unconsciously, by a number of ancient, mediaeval, and modern writers.
What the former said, was well said; what the latter repeated,
was generally distorted. An instance: Read the &quot;Pythagorean
Fragments,&quot; and compare the Septenary man as given by the
Rev. G. Oliver, the learned mason, in his &quot;Pythagorean Triangle&quot;
(ch. on &quot;<EM>Science of Numbers,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>p. 179).
<P>
He speaks as follows: --
<P>
&quot;The Theosophic Philosophy counted SEVEN <EM>properties </EM>(or
principles), in Man, viz.: --
<P>
(1.) The divine golden Man;
<P>
(2.) The inward holy body from fire and light, like pure silver;
<HR>

<P>
[[Vol. 2, Page]] 641 HYPNOTISM IS -- SATANISM.
<P>
(3.) The elemental man;
<P>
(4.) The mercurial paradisiacal man;
<P>
(5.) The martial Soul-like man;
<P>
(6.) The passionate man of desires;
<P>
(7.) The Solar man; a witness to and inspector of the wonders
of the Universe. They had also <EM>seven fountain </EM>Spirits,
or Powers of Nature.&quot;
<P>
Compare this jumbled account and distribution of Western theosophic
philosophy with the latest theosophic explanations by the Eastern
School of Theosophy, and then decide which is the more correct.
Verily: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Wisdom hath builded her house,<BR>
She hath hewn out her <EM>seven pillars.</EM>&quot;<EM> -- </EM>(<EM>Prov.
ix, </EM>1<EM>.</EM>)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As to the charge that our School has not adopted the Seven-fold
classification of the Brahmins, but has confused it, it is quite
unjust. To begin with, the &quot;School&quot; is one thing, its
exponents (<EM>to Europeans</EM>) quite another. The latter have
first to learn the A B C of practical Eastern Occultism, before
they can be made to understand correctly the tremendously abstruse
classification based on the seven distinct states of<EM> Pragna
</EM>(consciousness); and, above all, to realize thoroughly <EM>what
Pragna is, </EM>in the Eastern metaphysics. To give a Western
student that classification is to try to make him suppose that
he can account for the origin of consciousness, by accounting
for the process by which a certain knowledge, through <EM>only
one of the states </EM>of that consciousness, came to him; in
other words, it is to make him account for something he knows
on <EM>this </EM>plane, by something he knows nothing about on
the other planes; <EM>i.e.</EM>, to lead him from the spiritual
and the psychological, direct to the ontological. This is why
the primary, old, classification was adopted by the Theosophists,
of which classifications there are many.
<P>
To busy oneself, after such a tremendous number of independent
witnesses and proofs have been brought before the public, with
an additional enumeration from theological sources, would be quite
useless. The seven capital sins and seven virtues of the Christian
scheme are far less philosophical than even the Seven Liberal
and the Seven Accursed Sciences -- or the Seven Arts of enchantment
of the Gnostics. For one of the latter is now before the public,
pregnant with danger in the present as for the future. The modern
name for it is <STRONG>H</STRONG>YPNOTISM. In the ignorance of
the seven principles, and used by scientific and ignorant materialists,
it will soon become <STRONG>S</STRONG>ATANISM in the full acceptation
of the term.
