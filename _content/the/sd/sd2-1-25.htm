<H4>CONCLUSION.</H4>

<P>
Space forbids us to say anything more, and this part of the &quot;Secret
Doctrine&quot; has to be closed. The forty-nine Stanzas and the
few fragments from the Commentaries just given are all that can
be published in these volumes. These, with some still older records
-- to which none but the highest Initiates have access -- and
a whole library of comments, glossaries, and explanations, form
the synopsis of Man's genesis.
<P>
It is from the Commentaries that we have hitherto quoted and tried
to explain the hidden meaning of some of the allegories, thus
showing the true views of esoteric antiquity upon geology, anthropology,
and even ethnology. We will endeavour in the Part which follows,
to establish a still closer metaphysical connection between the
earliest races and their Creators, the <EM>divine </EM>men from
other worlds; accompanying the statements proffered with the most
important demonstrations of the same in esoteric Astronomy and
Symbolism.
<P>
In Volume <STRONG>III</STRONG>. of this work (the said volume
and the<STRONG> IV</STRONG>th being almost ready) a brief history
of all the great adepts known to the ancients and the moderns
in their chronological order will be given, as also a bird's eye
view of the Mysteries, their birth, growth, decay, and final death
-- in Europe. This could not find room in the present work. Volume
<STRONG>IV</STRONG>. will be almost entirely devoted to Occult
teachings.
<P>
The duration of the periods that separate, in space and time,
the Fourth from the Fifth Race -- in the historical* or even the
legendary beginnings of the latter -- is too tremendous for us
to offer, even to a Theosophist, any more detailed accounts of
them. During the course of the post-diluvian ages -- marked at
certain periodical epochs by the most terrible cataclysms -- too
many races and nations were born, and have disappeared almost
without leaving a trace, for any one to offer any description
of the slightest value concerning them. Whether the Masters of
Wisdom have a consecutive and full history of our race from its
incipient stage down to the present times; whether they possess
the uninterrupted record of man since he became the complete physical
being, and became thereby the king of the animals and master on
this earth -- is not for the writer to say. Most probably they
have,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The word &quot;historical&quot; is used, because, although historians
have dwarfed almost absurdly the dates that separate certain events
from our modern day, nevertheless, once that they are known and
accepted, they belong to history. Thus the Trojan War <EM>is</EM>
an historical event; and though even less than 1,000 years <STRONG>B.C.</STRONG>
is the date assigned to it, yet in truth it is nearer 6,000 than
5,000 years <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 438 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
and such is our own personal conviction. But if so, this knowledge
is only for the <EM>highest </EM>Initiates, who do not take their
students into their confidence. The writer can, therefore, give
but what she has herself been taught, and no more.
<P>
But even this will appear to the profane reader rather as a weird,
fantastic dream, than as a possible reality.
<P>
This is only natural and as it should be, since for years such
was the impression made upon the humble writer of these pages
herself. Born and bred in European, matter-of-fact and presumably
civilized countries, she assimilated the foregoing with the utmost
difficulty. But there are proofs of a certain character which
become irrefutable and are undeniable in the long run, to every
earnest and unprejudiced mind. For a series of years such were
offered to her, and now she has the full certitude that our present
globe and its human races must have been born, grown and developed
in this, and in no other way.
<P>
But this is the personal view of the writer; and her orthodoxy
cannot be expected to have any more weight than any other &quot;doxy,&quot;
in the eyes of those to whom every fresh theory is heterodox until
otherwise proved. Therefore are we Occultists fully prepared for
such questions as these: &quot;How does one know that the writer
has not invented the whole scheme? And supposing <EM>she </EM>has
not, how can one tell that the whole of the foregoing, as given
in the Stanzas, is not the product of the imagination of the ancients?
How could they have preserved the records of such an immense,
such an incredible antiquity?&quot;
<P>
The answer that the history of this world since its formation
and to its end &quot;is written in the stars,&quot; <EM>i.e.,
</EM>is recorded in the Zodiac and the Universal Symbolism whose
keys are in the keeping of the Initiates, will hardly satisfy
the doubters. The antiquity of the Zodiac in Egypt is much doubted,
and it is denied point-blank with regard to India. &quot;Your
conclusions are often excellent, but your premises are always
doubtful,&quot; the writer was once told by a profane friend.
To this, the answer came that it was one point, at least, gained
on the scientific syllogisms. For, with the exception of a few
problems from the domain of purely physical science, both the
premises and conclusions of the men of Science are as hypothetical
as they are almost invariably erroneous. And if they do not so
appear to the profane, the reason is simply this: the said profane
is very little aware, taking as he does his scientific data on
faith, that both premises and conclusions are generally the product
of the same brains, which, however learned, are not infallible;
a truism demonstrated daily by the shifting and re-shifting of
scientific theories and speculations.
<P>
However it may be, the records of the temples, Zodiacal and traditional,
as well as the ideographic records of the East, as read by the
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 439 MODERN SCIENCE MISTRUSTED.</H6>

<P>
adepts of the Sacred Science and Vidya, are not a whit more doubtful
than the so-called ancient history of the European nations, now
edited, corrected, and amplified by half a century of archaeological
discoveries, and the very problematical readings of the Assyrian
tiles, cuneiform fragments, and Egyptian hieroglyphics. So are
our data based upon the same readings, in addition to an almost
inexhaustible number of Secret works of which Europe knows nothing
-- <EM>plus</EM> the perfect knowledge by the Initiates of the
symbolism of every word so recorded. Some of these records belong
to an immense antiquity. Every archaeologist and palaeontologist
is acquainted with the ideographic productions of certain semi-savage
tribes, who from time immemorial have aimed at rendering their
thoughts symbolically. This is the earliest mode of recording
events and ideas. And how old this knowledge is in the human race
may be inferred from some signs, evidently ideographic, found
on hatchets of the Palaeolithic period. The red Indian tribes
of America, only a few years ago comparatively speaking, petitioned
the President of the United States to grant them possession of
four small lakes, the petition being written on the tiny surface
of a piece of a fabric, which is covered with barely a dozen representations
of animals and birds. (See Lubbock.) The American savages have
a number of such different kinds of writing, but not one of our
Scientists is yet familiar, or even knows of the early hieroglyphic
cypher, still preserved in some Fraternities, and named in Occultism
the <EM>Senzar. </EM>Moreover, all those who have decided to regard
such modes of writing -- <EM>e.g.,</EM> the ideographs of the
Red Indians, and even the Chinese characters -- as &quot;attempts
of the early races of mankind to express their untutored thoughts,&quot;
will decidedly object to our statement, that writing was invented
by the Atlanteans, and not at all by the Phoenicians. Indeed,
such a claim as that writing was known to mankind many hundreds
of millenniums ago, in the face of the philologists who have decreed
that writing was unknown in the days of, and to Panini, in India,
as also to the Greeks in the time of Homer, will be met by general
disapprobation, if not with silent scorn. All denial and ridicule
notwithstanding, the Occultists will maintain the claim, and simply
for this reason: from Bacon down to our modern Royal Society,
we have a too long period, full of the most ludicrous mistakes
made by Science, to warrant our believing in modern scientific
assumptions rather than in the denials of our Teachers. Writing,
our scientists say, was unknown to Panini; and this sage nevertheless
composed a grammar which contains 3,996 rules, and is the most
perfect of all the grammars that were ever made! Panini is made
out to have lived barely a few centuries <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>.,
by the most liberal; and the rocks in Iran and Central Asia (whence
the philologists and historians<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 440 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
show us the ancestors of the same Panini, the Brahmins, coming
into India) are <EM>covered with writing, </EM>two and three thousand
years old (12,000, according to some fearless palaeontologists).
<P>
Writing was an <EM>ars incognita </EM>in the days of Hesiod and
Homer, agreeably to Grote, and unknown to the Greeks so late as
770 <STRONG>B.C.</STRONG>; and the Phoenicians who had <EM>invented
</EM>it, and knew writing as far back as 1500<STRONG> B.C</STRONG>.,
at the earliest,* were living among the Greeks, and elbowing them,
all the time! All these scientific and contradictory conclusions
disappeared, however, into thin air, when Schliemann discovered
(<EM>a</EM>) the site of ancient Troy, whose actual existence
had been so long regarded as a fable; and (<EM>b</EM>), excavated
on that site earthenware vessels with inscriptions <EM>in characters
unknown </EM>to the paleontologists and the all-denying Sanskritists.
Who will now deny Troy, or these Archaic inscriptions? As Professor
Virchow witnesses: -- &quot;I was myself an eye-witness of two
such discoveries, and helped to gather the articles together.
The slanderers have long since been silenced, who were not ashamed
to charge the discoverer with an imposture.&quot;** Nor were truthful
women spared any more than truthful men. Du Chaillu, Gordon-Cumming,
Madame Merian,*** Bruce, and a host of others were charged with
lying.
<P>
Madame Merian -- says the author of &quot;<EM>Mythical Monsters,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>who gives this information in the <EM>Introduction</EM> --
was accused of deliberate falsehood in reference to her description
of a bird-eating spider nearly two hundred years ago. But now-a-days
reliable observers have confirmed it in regard to South America,
India, and elsewhere. Audubon was accused by botanists of having
invented the yellow water-lily, which he figured in his <EM>Birds
of the South </EM>under the name of Nymphaea lutea, and after
having lain under the imputation for years, was confirmed at last
by the discovery of the long-lost flower in Florida in 1876 (<EM>Pop.
Sci. Monthly, </EM>No. 60, April 1877). And, as Audubon was called
<EM>a liar </EM>for this, and for his Holiaetus Washingtonii,****
so Victor Hugo was ridiculed for . . . . his marvellous word-painting
of the devil-fish, and his description of a man becoming its helpless
victim. &quot;The thing was derided as an impossibility; yet within
a few years were discovered, on the shores of Newfoundland, cuttle
fish with arms extending to thirty feet in length, and capable
of dragging a good-sized

in Phoenician characters -- from annals and State documents in
the archives of <EM>the older </EM>Phoenician cities -- the full
record of their religion in 1250 <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>.

for <EM>centuries past</EM> . . . . by Japanese artists.&quot;
(&quot;<EM>Mythical Monsters,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>p. 11 <EM>Introd</EM>.).
<P>
And if Troy was denied, and regarded as a myth; the existence
of Herculaneum and Pompeii declared a fiction; the travels of
Marco Polo laughed at and called as absurd a fable as one of Baron
Munchausen's tales, why should the writer of &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;
and of the &quot;Secret Doctrine&quot; be any better treated?
Mr. Charles Gould, the author of the above-cited volume quotes
in his excellent work a few lines from Macmillan (1860), which
are as true as life, and too much to the point not to be reproduced:
&quot;When a naturalist, either by visiting such spots of earth
as are still out of the way, or by his good fortune, finds a very
queer plant or animal, he is forthwith accused of <EM>inventing
</EM>his game. . . . . . As soon as the creature is found to sin
against preconception, the great (mis ?) guiding Spirit, <EM>a
priori </EM>by name, who furnishes philosophers with their omniscience
<EM>pro re nata, </EM>whispers that no such thing <EM>can </EM>be,
and forthwith there is a charge of hoax. The heavens themselves
have been charged with hoaxes. When Leverrier and Adams predicted
a planet by calculation, it was gravely asserted in some quarters
that the planet which had been calculated was not <EM>the</EM>
planet but another which had clandestinely and improperly got
into the neighbourhood of the true body. <EM>The disposition to
suspect hoax is stronger than the disposition to hoax. </EM>Who
was it that first announced that the classical writings of Greece
and Rome were one huge hoax perpetrated by the monks in what the
announcer would be as little or less inclined than Dr. Maitland
to call the dark ages?&quot; (p. 13).
<P>
Thus let it be. No disbeliever who takes the &quot;Secret Doctrine&quot;
for a &quot;hoax&quot; is forced or even asked to credit our statements.
These have already been proclaimed to be such by certain very
clever American journalists before even the work went to press.*
<P>
Nor, is it after all, necessary that any one should believe in
the Occult Sciences and the old teachings, before one knows anything
or even
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* So far back as July, 1888, at a time when the <STRONG>MSS</STRONG>.
of this work had not yet left my writing table, and the <EM>Secret
Doctrine </EM>was utterly unknown to the world, it was already
being denounced as a product of my brain and no more. These are
the flattering terms in which the <EM>Evening Telegraph </EM>(of
America) referred to this still unpublished work in its issue
of June 30, 1888: &quot;<EM>Among the fascinating books for July</EM>
<EM>reading </EM>is Mme. Blavatsky's new book on Theosophy . .
. (!) the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ECRET <STRONG>D</STRONG>OCTRINE. .
. . But because she can soar back into the Brahmin ignorance .
. . (! ?) . . . <EM>is no proof</EM> <EM>that everything she says
is true.</EM>&quot; And once the prejudiced verdict given on the
mistaken notion that my book was out, and that the reviewer had
read it, neither of which was or could be the case, now that it
is really out the critic will have to support his first statement,
whether correct or otherwise, and thus get out of it, probably
by a more slashing criticism than ever.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 442 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
believes in his own soul. No great truth was ever accepted <EM>a
priori,</EM> and generally a century or two passed before it began
to glimmer in the human consciousness as a possible verity, except
in such cases as the positive discovery of the thing claimed as
a fact. The truths of to-day are the falsehoods and errors of
yesterday, and <EM>vice versa. </EM>It is only in the <STRONG>XX</STRONG>th
century that portions, if not the whole, of the present work will
be vindicated.
<P>
It is no fact going against our statements, therefore, even if
Sir John Evans does affirm that writing was unknown in the stone
age. For it may have been unknown during that period in the Fifth
Aryan race, and have been perfectly known to the Atlanteans of
the Fourth, in the palmy days of their highest civilization. The
cycles of the rise and fall of the nations and races are there
to account for it.
<P>
If told that there have been cases before now of forged pseudographs
being palmed off on the credulous, and that our work may be classed
with Jacolliot's &quot;Bible in India&quot; (in which, by the
way, there are more truths among its errors than are found in
the works of orthodox and recognized Orientalists) -- the charge
and comparison will dismay us very little. We bide our time. Even
the famous &quot;Ezour-Veda&quot; of the last century, considered
by Voltaire &quot;the most precious gift from the East to the
West,&quot; and by Max Muller &quot;about the silliest book that
can be read,&quot; is not altogether without facts and truths
in it. The cases when the <EM>a priori </EM>negations of specialists
became justified by subsequent corroborations form but an insignificant
percentage of those that were fully vindicated by subsequent discoveries,
and confirmed to the great dismay of the learned objectors. &quot;Ezour
Veda,&quot; was a very small bone of contention compared with
the triumph of Sir William Jones, Anquetil de Perron, and others
in the matter of Sanskrit and its literature. Such facts are recorded
by Professor Max Muller himself, who, speaking of the discomfiture
of Dugald Stewart and Co. in connection with this, states that
&quot;if the facts about Sanskrit were true, Dugald Stewart was
too wise not to see that the conclusions drawn from them were
inevitable. He therefore denied the reality of such a language
as Sanskrit altogether, and wrote his famous essay to prove that
Sanskrit had been put together after the model of Greek and Latin,
by those arch-forgers and liars, the Brahmans, and that the whole
of Sanskrit literature was an imposition&quot; (<EM>Science of
Language,</EM> p. 168). The writer is quite willing and feels
proud to keep company with these Brahmans, and other <EM>historical</EM>
&quot;liars,&quot; in the opinion of our modern Dugald Stewarts.
She has lived too long, and her experience has been too varied
and personal, for her not to know at least something of human
nature. &quot;When you doubt, abstain,&quot; says the wise Zoroaster,
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 443 PARADOXES OF SCIENCE.</H6>

<P>
whose prudent aphorism is found corroborated in every case by
daily life and experience. Yet, like St. John the Baptist, this
sage of the past Ages is found preaching in the desert, in company
with a more modern philosopher, namely Bacon, who offers the same
priceless bit of practical Wisdom. &quot;In contemplation,&quot;
he says (in any question of Knowledge, we add), &quot;if a man
begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but <EM>if he
will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in</EM> <EM>certainties.</EM>&quot;
<P>
With this piece of advice from the father of English Philosophy
to the representatives of British scepticism we ought to close
the debate, but our theosophical readers are entitled to a final
piece of Occult information.
<P>
Enough was said to show that evolution in general, events, mankind,
and everything else in Nature proceed in cycles. We have spoken
of seven Races, five of which have nearly completed their earthly
career, and have claimed that every Root-Race, with its sub-races
and innumerable family divisions and tribes, was entirely distinct
from its preceding and succeeding race. This will be objected
to, on the authority of uniform experience in the question of
Anthropology, and Ethnology. Man was -- save in colour and type,
and perhaps a difference in facial peculiarities and cranial capacity
-- ever the same under every climate and in every part of the
world, say the Naturalists: ay, even in stature. This, while maintaining
that man descends from the same unknown ancestor as the ape, a
claim that is logically impossible without an infinite variation
of stature and form, from his first evolution into a biped. The
very logical persons who maintain both propositions are welcome
to their paradoxical views. Once more we address only those who,
doubting the general derivation of myths from &quot;the contemplation
of the visible workings of external nature&quot; . . . . think
it, &quot;less hard to believe that these wonderful stories of
gods and demi-gods, of giants and dwarfs, of dragons and monsters
of all descriptions, are transformations, than to believe them
to be inventions.&quot; It is only such &quot;transformations&quot;
in physical nature, as much as in the memory and conceptions of
our present mankind, that the Secret Doctrine teaches. It confronts
the purely speculative hypotheses of modern Science, based upon
the experience and exact observations of barely a few centuries,
with the unbroken tradition and records of its Sanctuaries; and
brushing away that tissue of cobweb-like theories, spun in the
darkness that covers a period of hardly a few millenniums back,
and which Europeans call their &quot;History,&quot; the Old Science
says to us: Listen, now, to my version of the memoirs of Humanity.
<P>
The human Races are born one from the other, grow, develop, become
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 444 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
old, and die. Their sub-races and nations follow the same rule.
If your all-denying modern science and so-called philosophy do
not contest that the human family is composed of a variety of
well-defined types and races, it is only because the fact is undeniable,
no one would say that there was no external difference between
an Englishman, an African negro, and a Japanese or Chinaman. On
the other hand it is formally denied by most naturalists that
<EM>mixed human races, i.e., </EM>the seeds for entirely new races,
are any longer formed in our days. But this last is maintained
on good grounds by de Quatrefages and some others.
<P>
Nevertheless our general proposition will not be accepted. It
will be said that whatever forms man has passed through in the
long pre-historic Past there are no more changes for him (save
certain variations, as at present) in the future. Hence that our
Sixth and Seventh Root Races are fictions.
<P>
To this it is again answered: How <EM>do you </EM>know? Your experience
is limited to a few thousand years, to less than a day in the
whole age of Humanity and to the present types of the actual continents
and isles of our Fifth Race. How can you tell what will or will
not be? Meanwhile, such is the prophecy of the Secret Books and
their no uncertain statements.
<P>
Since the beginning of the Atlantean Race many million years have
passed, yet we find the last of the Atlanteans, still mixed up
with the Aryan element, 11,000 years ago. This shows the enormous
overlapping of one race over the race which succeeds it, though
in character and external type the elder loses its characteristics,
and assumes the new features of the younger race. This is proved
in all the formations of mixed human races. Now, Occult philosophy
teaches that even now, under our very eyes, the new Race and Races
are preparing to be formed, and that it is in America that the
transformation will take place, and has already silently commenced.
<P>
Pure Anglo-Saxons hardly three hundred years ago, the Americans
of the United States have already become a nation apart, and,
owing to a strong admixture of various nationalities and inter-marriage,
almost a race <EM>sui generis, </EM>not only mentally, but also
physically. &quot;Every mixed race, when uniform and settled,
has been able to play the part of a primary race in fresh crossings,&quot;
says de Quatrefages. &quot;Mankind, in its present state, has
thus been formed, certainly, for the greatest part, by the successive
crossing of a number of races <EM>at present</EM> <EM>undetermined</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(&quot;<EM>The Human Species</EM>,&quot; <EM>p.</EM> 274.)
<P>
Thus the Americans have become in only three centuries a &quot;primary
race,&quot; <EM>pro tem., </EM>before becoming a race apart, and
strongly separated from all other now existing races. They are,
in short, the germs of the <EM>Sixth </EM>sub-race, and in some
few hundred years more, will become<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 445 THE COMING NEW RACE.</H6>

<P>
most decidedly the pioneers of that race which must succeed to
the present European or fifth sub-race, in all its new characteristics.
After this, in about 25,000 years, they will launch into preparations
for the seventh sub-race; until, in consequence of cataclysms
-- the first series of those which must one day destroy Europe,
and still later the whole Aryan race (and thus affect both Americas),
as also most of the lands directly connected with the confines
of our continent and isles -- the Sixth Root-Race will have appeared
on the stage of our Round. When shall this be? Who knows save
the great Masters of Wisdom, perchance, and they are as silent
upon the subject as the snow-capped peaks that tower above them.
All we know is, that it will silently come into existence; so
silently, indeed, that for long millenniums shall its pioneers
-- the peculiar children who will grow into peculiar men and women
-- be regarded as anomalous <EM>lusus naturae, </EM>abnormal oddities
physically and mentally. Then, as they increase, and their numbers
become with every age greater, one day they will awake to find
themselves in a majority. It is the present men who will then
begin to be regarded as exceptional mongrels, until these die
out in their turn in civilised lands; surviving only in small
groups on islands -- the mountain peaks of to-day -- where they
will vegetate, degenerate, and finally die out, perhaps millions
of years hence, as the Aztecs have, as the Nyam-Nyam and the dwarfish
Moola Koorumba of the Nilghiri Hills are dying. All these are
the remnants of once mighty races, the recollection of whose existence
has entirely died out of the remembrance of the modern generations,
just as we shall vanish from the memory of the Sixth Race Humanity.
The Fifth will overlap the Sixth Race for many hundreds of millenniums,
changing with it slower than its new successor, still changing
in stature, general physique, and mentality, just as the Fourth
overlapped our Aryan race, and the Third had overlapped the Atlanteans.
<P>
This process of preparation for the Sixth great Race must last
throughout the whole sixth and seventh sub-races (<EM>vide supra,
</EM>the diagram of the Genealogical Tree of the Fifth Race).
But the <EM>last</EM> remnants of the Fifth Continent will not
disappear until some time after the birth of the <EM>new </EM>Race;
when another and <EM>new </EM>dwelling, the sixth continent, will
have appeared above the <EM>new </EM>waters on the face of the
globe, so as to receive the new stranger. To it also will emigrate
and settle all those who shall be fortunate enough to escape the
general disaster. When this shall be -- as just said -- it is
not for the writer to know. Only, as nature no more proceeds by
sudden jumps and starts, than man changes suddenly from a child
into a mature man, the final cataclysm will be preceded by many
smaller submersions and destructions both by wave and volcanic
fires. The exultant pulse will beat<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 446 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
high in the heart of the race now in the American zone, but there
will be no more Americans when the Sixth Race commences; no more,
in fact, than Europeans; for they will have now become a <EM>new
race, and</EM> <EM>many new nations. </EM>Yet the Fifth will not
die, but survive for a while: overlapping the new Race for many
hundred thousands of years to come, it will become transformed
with it -- slower than its new successor -- still getting entirely
altered in mentality, general physique, and stature. Mankind will
not grow again into giant bodies as in the case of the Lemurians
and the Atlanteans; because while the evolution of the Fourth
race led the latter down to the very bottom of materiality in
its physical development, the present Race is on its ascending
arc; and the Sixth will be rapidly growing out of its bonds of
matter, and even of flesh.
<P>
Thus it is the mankind of the New world -- one by far the senior
of our Old one, a fact men had also forgotten -- of <EM>Patala
</EM>(the Antipodes, or the Nether World, as America is called
in India), whose mission and Karma it is, to sow the seeds for
a forthcoming, grander, and far more glorious Race than any of
those we know of at present. The Cycles of Matter will be succeeded
by Cycles of Spirituality and a fully developed mind. On the law
of parallel history and races, the majority of the future mankind
will be composed of glorious Adepts. Humanity is the child of
cyclic Destiny, and not one of its Units can escape its unconscious
mission, or get rid of the burden of its co-operative work with
nature. Thus will mankind, race after race, perform its appointed
cycle-pilgrimage. Climates will, and have already begun, to change,
each tropical year after the other dropping one sub-race, but
only to beget another higher race on the ascending cycle; while
a series of other less favoured groups -- the failures of nature
-- will, like some individual men, vanish from the human family
without even leaving a trace behind.
<P>
Such is the course of Nature under the sway of <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMIC
<STRONG>L</STRONG>AW: of the ever present and the ever-becoming
Nature. For, in the words of a Sage, known only to a few Occultists:--
&quot;<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>P</STRONG>RESENT IS THE <STRONG>C</STRONG>HILD
OF THE <STRONG>P</STRONG>AST; THE <STRONG>F</STRONG>UTURE, THE
BEGOTTEN OF THE <STRONG>P</STRONG>RESENT. <STRONG>A</STRONG>ND
YET, <STRONG>O</STRONG> PRESENT MOMENT! <STRONG>K</STRONG>NOWEST
THOU NOT THAT THOU HAST NO PARENT, NOR CANST THOU HAVE A CHILD;
THAT THOU ART EVER BEGETTING BUT THYSELF? <STRONG>B</STRONG>EFORE
THOU HAST EVEN BEGUN TO SAY '<STRONG>I </STRONG>AM THE PROGENY
OF THE DEPARTED MOMENT, THE CHILD OF THE PAST,' THOU HAST BECOME
THAT PAST ITSELF. <STRONG>B</STRONG>EFORE THOU UTTEREST THE LAST
SYLLABLE, BEHOLD! THOU ART NO MORE THE <STRONG>P</STRONG>RESENT
BUT VERILY THAT <STRONG>F</STRONG>UTURE. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HUS,
ARE THE <STRONG>P</STRONG>AST, THE <STRONG>P</STRONG>RESENT, AND
THE <STRONG>F</STRONG>UTURE, THE EVER-LIVING TRINITY IN ONE --
THE <STRONG>M</STRONG>AHAMAYA OF THE <STRONG>A</STRONG>BSOLUTE
<STRONG>IS</STRONG>.&quot;
