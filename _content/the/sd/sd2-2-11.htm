<H3>&#167; XXIV. </H3>

<H4>THE CROSS AND THE PYTHAGOREAN DECADE.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE early Gnostics claimed that their Science,
the <STRONG>G</STRONG>NOSIS, rested on a square, the angles of
which represented respectively <EM>Sige</EM> (Silence), <EM>Bythos
</EM>(depth),<EM> Nous </EM>(Spiritual Soul or Mind), and <EM>Aletheia
</EM>(Truth).
<P>
It is they who were the first to introduce and reveal to the world
that which had remained concealed for ages: namely, the <EM>Tau,
</EM>in the shape of a Procrustean bed, and Christos as incarnating
in <EM>Chrestos,</EM> he who became for certain purposes a willing
candidate for a series of tortures, mental and physical.
<P>
For them the whole of the Universe, metaphysical and material,
was contained within, and could be expressed and described by
the digits of Number 10, the Pythagorean <EM>decade</EM>.
<P>
This Decade representing the Universe and its evolution out of
Silence and the <EM>unknown </EM>Depths of the Spiritual Soul,
or <EM>anima mundi,</EM> presented two sides or aspects to the
student. It could be, and was at first so used and applied to
the Macrocosm, after which it descended to the Microcosm, or Man.
There was, then, the purely intellectual and metaphysical, or
the &quot;<EM>inner</EM> Science,&quot; and the as purely materialistic
or &quot;surface science,&quot; both of which could be expounded
by and contained in the <EM>Decade. </EM>It could be studied,
in short, from the Universals of Plato, and the inductive method
of Aristotle. The former started from a divine comprehension,
when the plurality proceeded from unity, or the digits of the
decade appeared, but to be finally re-absorbed, lost in the infinite
Circle. The latter depended on sensuous perception alone, when
the Decade could be regarded either as the unity that multiplies,
or matter which differentiates, its study being limited to the
plane surface; to the Cross, or the <EM>Seven</EM> which proceeds
from the ten -- or the perfect number, on Earth as in heaven.
<P>
This dual system was brought, together with the Decade, by Pythagoras
from India. That it was that of the <EM>Brachmans</EM> and<EM>
Iranians</EM>, as they are called by the ancient Greek philosophers,
is warranted to us by the whole range of Sanskrit literature,
such as the Puranas and the laws of Manu. In these &quot;Laws&quot;
or &quot;Ordinances of Manu,&quot; it is said that Brahma first
creates &quot;the <EM>ten </EM>lords of Being,&quot; the ten Prajapati
or creative Forces; which ten produce &quot;<EM>seven</EM>&quot;
other Manus, or, rather, as some <STRONG>MSS</STRONG>. have it,
<EM>Munin, </EM>instead of Manun = &quot;devotees,&quot; or holy
Beings, which are the Seven Angels of the Presence in the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 574 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Western religion. This mysterious number Seven, born from the
upper triangle <IMG SRC="sd1-113.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">, the latter
itself born from the apex thereof, or the Silent Depths of the
unknown universal soul (<EM>Sige </EM>and<EM> Bythos</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>is the sevenfold <EM>Saptaparna </EM>plant, born and manifested
on the surface of the soil of mystery, from the threefold root
buried deep under that impenetrable soil. This idea is fully elaborated
in Vol. I. &#167; &quot;Primordial Substance and Divine Thought,&quot;
which the reader has to notice carefully, if he would grasp the
metaphysical idea involved in the above symbol. In man as in nature,
it is, according to the cis-Himalayan esoteric philosophy (which
is that of the <EM>original Manu </EM>Cosmogony), the septenary
division that is intended by Nature herself. The seventh principle
(<EM>purusha</EM>)<EM> </EM>alone is the divine <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF,
strictly speaking; for, as said in Manu, &quot;He (Brahma) having
pervaded the subtile parts of those six of unmeasured brightness,&quot;
created or called them forth to &quot;Self&quot;-consciousness
or the consciousness of that <EM>One</EM> <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF
(V. 16, ch. i. <EM>Manu</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Of these six, five elements
(or principles, or <EM>Tattva, </EM>as Medhatithi, the commentator
thinks) &quot;are called the atomic destructible elements&quot;
(v. 27); they are described in the above-named section.
<P>
We have now to speak of the Mystery language, that of the prehistoric
races. It is not a phonetic, but a purely pictorial and symbolical
tongue. It is known at present in its fulness to the very few,
having become with the masses for more than 5,000 years an absolutely
dead language. Yet most of the learned Gnostics, Greeks and Jews,
knew it, and used it, though very differently. A few instances
may be given.
<P>
On the plane above, the Number is no Number but a <EM>nought --
</EM>a CIRCLE. On the plane below, it becomes <EM>one</EM> --
which is an odd number. Each letter of the ancient alphabets having
had its philosophical meaning and <EM>raison d</EM>'<EM>etre,
</EM>the number I signified with the Alexandrian Initiates a<EM>
body erect, </EM>a living standing man, he being the only animal
that has this privilege. And, by adding to the I a head, it was
transformed into a P, a symbol of <EM>paternity, </EM>of the creative
potency; while R signified a &quot;moving man,&quot; one on his
way. Hence <STRONG>P</STRONG>ATER <STRONG>Z</STRONG>EUS had nothing
sexual or phallic either in its sound or form of letters; nor
had [[<EM>pater Deus</EM>]] (<EM>vide</EM> Ragon). If we turn
now to the Hebrew Alphabet, we shall find that while I or aleph,
<IMG SRC="sd1-78b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">, has a bull or an Ox for
its symbol, 10, the perfect number, or <EM>One</EM> of the Kabala
is a <EM>Yodh <IMG SRC="sd1-78c.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (y, i, or
j); and means, as the first letter of Jehovah, the procreative
organ, et seq.</EM> 
<P>
The <EM>odd</EM> numbers are divine, the <EM>even</EM> numbers
are terrestrial, devilish, and unlucky. The Pythagoreans hated
the binary. With them it was the origin of differentiation, hence
of contrasts, discord, or matter, the beginning of evil. In the
Valentinian theogony, Bythos and Sige (Depth, Chaos, matter born
in Silence) are the primordial binary.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 575 THE THREE SCIENCES. </H6>

<P>
With the early Pythagoreans, however, the duad was that imperfect
state into which the first manifested being fell when it got detached
from the Monad. It was the point from which the two roads -- the
Good and the Evil -- bifurcated. All that which was double-faced
or false was called by them &quot;binary.&quot; <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE
was alone Good, and Harmony, because no disharmony can proceed
from one alone. Hence the Latin word<EM> Solus </EM>in relation
to one and only God, the Unknown of Paul. <EM>Solus, </EM>however,
very soon became <EM>Sol</EM> -- the Sun.
<P>
The ternary is thus the first of the odd numbers, as the triangle
is the first of the geometrical figures. This number is truly
the number of mystery <EM>par excellence. </EM>To study it on
the exoteric lines one has to read Ragon's <EM>Cours Interpretatif
des Initiations; </EM>on the esoteric -- the Hindu symbolism of
numerals; as the combinations which were applied to it are numberless.
It is on the occult properties of the three equal lines or sides
of the Triangle that Ragon based his studies and founded the famous
masonic society of the Trinosophists (those who study <EM>three</EM>
<EM>sciences; </EM>an improvement upon the ordinary three masonic
degrees, given to those who study nothing except eating and drinking
at the meetings of their lodges). &quot;The first line of the
triangle offered to the apprentice for study,&quot; writes the
founder, -- &quot;is the mineral kingdom, symbolized by Tubalc
. . . (Tubal-cain). The second side on which the '<EM>companion</EM>'
has to meditate, is the <EM>vegetable </EM>kingdom, symbolized
by Schibb <IMG SRC="sd2-575.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (Schibboleth).
In this kingdom begins the <EM>generation of the bodies. </EM>This
is why the letter G is presented radiant before the eyes of the
adept (? !). The third side is left to the master mason, who has
to complete his education by the study of the <EM>animal kingdom.
</EM>It is symbolized by <EM>Maoben <IMG SRC="sd2-575.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</EM>(Sun of putrefaction)&quot; etc., etc.
<P>
The first solid figure is the <EM>Quaternary, </EM>symbol of immortality.
It is the<EM> pyramid: </EM>for the pyramid stands on a triangular,
square, or polygonal base, and terminates with a point at the
top, thus yielding the triad and the quaternary or the 3 and 4.
It is the Pythagoreans who taught the connection and relation
between the gods and the numbers -- in a Science called <EM>arithmomancy.
</EM>The Soul is a number, they said, which moves of itself and
contains the number 4; and spiritual and physical man is number
3, as the <EM>ternary </EM>represented for them not only the surface
but also the principle of the formation of the physical body.
Thus animals were <EM>ternaries </EM>only, man alone being a septenary,
<EM>when</EM> <EM>virtuous;</EM> a <EM>quinary </EM>when bad,
for: --
<P>
Number 5 was composed of a binary and a ternary, which binary
threw everything in the perfect form into disorder and confusion.
The
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The reason for it is simple, and was given in &quot;<EM>Isis
Unveiled.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>In geometry, one line fails to represent
a perfect body or figure, nor can two lines constitute a demonstratively
perfect figure. The triangle alone is the first perfect figure.
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 576 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
<EM>perfect man, </EM>they said, <EM>was a quaternary and a ternary,
</EM>or four material and three immaterial elements; which three
spirits or elements we likewise find in 5, when it represents
the <EM>microcosm. </EM>The latter is a compound of a binary directly
relating to gross matter, and of three Spirits:
<P>
&quot;since 5 is the ingenious union of two Greek accents <IMG SRC="sd2-576a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
placed over vowels which have or have not to be <EM>aspirated.
</EM>The first sign <IMG SRC="sd2-576b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> is
called 'Strong Spirit' or superior Spirit, the spirit of God aspired
(<EM>spiratus</EM>) and breathed by man. The second sign <IMG SRC="sd2-576c.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
the lower, is the <EM>Spirit of Love,</EM> representing the secondary
Spirit; the third embraces the whole man. It is the <EM>universal
Quintessence, </EM>the vital fluid or Life.&quot; (<EM>Ragon.</EM>)
<P>
The more mystic meaning of 5 is given in an excellent article
by Mr. Subba Row, in &quot;Five Years of Theosophy&quot; (pp.
110,<EM> et seq.</EM>)<EM> -- </EM>&quot;The Twelve Signs of the
Zodiac,&quot; in which he gives some rules that may help the inquirer
to ferret out &quot;the deep significance of ancient Sanskrit
nomenclature in the old Aryan myths and allegories.&quot; Meanwhile,
let us see what has been hitherto stated about the constellation
Capricornus in theosophical publications, and what is known of
it generally. Every one knows that <IMG SRC="sd2-576d.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
is the tenth sign of the Zodiac into which the Sun enters at the
winter solstice, about December 21st. But very few are those who
know -- even in India, unless they are initiated -- the real mystic
connection which seems to exist, as we are told, between the names
<EM>Makara </EM>and<EM> Kumara. </EM>The first means some amphibious
animal called <EM>flippantly </EM>'crocodile,' as some Orientalists
think, and the second is the title of the great patrons of Yogins
(See &quot;<EM>Saiva Puranas,</EM>&quot;)<EM> </EM>the Sons of,
and even one with, Rudra (Siva); a Kumara himself. It is through
their connection with Man that the Kumaras are likewise connected
with the Zodiac. Let us try to find out what the word <EM>Makara
</EM>means.
<P>
The word <EM>Makara, </EM>says the author of &quot;<EM>The Twelve
Signs of the</EM> <EM>Zodiac,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>&quot;contains
within itself the clue to its correct interpretation. The letter
<EM>Ma </EM>is equivalent to No. 5, and <EM>Kara </EM>means hand.
Now in Sanskrit <EM>Thribhujam </EM>means a triangle, <EM>bhujam</EM>
or<EM> Karam </EM>(both synonyms) being understood to mean a side.
So <EM>Makaram </EM>or<EM> Panchakaram </EM>means a Pentagon&quot;
-- the five-pointed star or pentagon representing the five limbs
of man.* Under the old system, we are told, Makara was the <EM>eighth
</EM>instead of the tenth sign.** It is &quot;intended to represent
the faces of the Universe, and indicates that the Universe is
bounded by <EM>Pentagons,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>as the Sanskrit
writers &quot;speak also of
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* What is the meaning and the reason of this figure? Because,
<EM>Manas </EM>is the <EM>fifth</EM> principle, and because the
pentagon is the symbol of Man -- not only of the five-limbed,
but rather of the <EM>thinking, conscious </EM>MAN<EM>.</EM> 
<P>
** The reason for it becomes apparent when Egyptian symbology
is studied. See further on.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 577 POSEION'S FIVE MINISTERS. </H6>

<P>
<EM>Ashtadisa </EM>or eight faces bounding Space,&quot; referring
thus to the <EM>loka-palas,</EM> the eight points of the compass
(the four cardinal and the four intermediate points) . . . &quot;From
an objective point of view the <EM>Microcosm</EM> is represented
by the human body. <EM>Makaram </EM>may be taken to represent
simultaneously both the microcosm and the macrocosm, as external
objects of perception.&quot; (<EM>pp. </EM>113, 115)<EM>.</EM>

<P>
But the true esoteric sense of the word &quot;Makara,&quot; does
not mean &quot;crocodile,&quot; in truth, at all, even when it
is compared with the animal depicted on the Hindu Zodiac. For
it has the head and the fore-legs of an antelope and the body
and tail of a fish. Hence the tenth sign of the Zodiac has been
taken variously to mean a shark, a dolphin, etc.; as it is the
<EM>vahan </EM>of<EM> Varuna, </EM>the Ocean God, and is often
called, for this reason, <EM>Jala-rupa </EM>or &quot;water-form.&quot;
The dolphin was the vehicle of Poseidon-Neptune with the Greeks,
and one with him, esoterically; and this &quot;dolphin&quot; is
the &quot;sea-dragon&quot; as much as the Crocodile of the Sacred
Nile is the vehicle of Horus, and Horus himself. &quot;I am the
fish and seat of the great Horus of Kem-our,&quot; says the mummy-form
God with the crocodile's head (<EM>ch. lxxxviii.,</EM> 2<EM>,
</EM>&quot;<EM>Book of the Dead</EM>&quot;)<EM>. </EM>With the
Peratae Gnostics it is <EM>Chozzar </EM>(Neptune), who converts
into a sphere the dodecagonal pyramid, &quot;and paints its gate
with many colours.&quot; He has FIVE <EM>androgyne </EM>ministers
-- he <EM>is Makara, </EM>the Leviathan.
<P>
The rising Sun being considered the Soul of the Gods sent to manifest
itself to men every day, and the crocodile rising out of the water
at the first sunbeam, that animal came finally to personify a
Solar-fire devotee in India, as it personified that fire, or the
highest soul with the Egyptians.
<P>
In the Puranas, the number of the <EM>Kumaras </EM>changes according
to the exigencies of the allegory. For occult purposes their number
is given in one place as seven, then as four, then as five. In
the <EM>Kurma Purana</EM> it is said of them: &quot;These <EM>five
</EM>(<EM>Kumara</EM>)<EM>, </EM>O Brahman, were Yogins who acquired
entire exemption from passion.&quot; Their very name shows their
connection with the said constellation -- the <EM>Makara, </EM>and
with some other Puranic characters connected with the Zodiacal
signs. This is done in order to veil what was one of the most
suggestive glyphs of the primitive Temples. They are mixed up
astronomically, physiologically, and mystically, in general, with
a number of Puranic personages and events. Hardly hinted at in
the &quot;<EM>Vishnu,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>they figure in various
dramas and events throughout all the other Puranas and sacred
literature; so that the Orientalists, having to pick up the threads
of connection hither and thither, have ended by proclaiming the
Kumaras &quot;due chiefly to the fancy of the Puranic writers.&quot;
But --
<P>
<EM>Ma, -- </EM>we are told by the author of the &quot;Twelve
Signs of the Zodiac&quot; -- is<EM> Five; kara, </EM>a hand with
its five fingers, as also a five-sided sign or<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 578 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
a<EM> pentagon. </EM>The<EM> Kumara </EM>(in this case an anagram
for occult purposes) are <EM>five </EM>in esotericism, as Yogis
-- because the last two names have ever been kept secret; they
are the fifth order of Brahmadevas, and the fivefold Chohans,
having the soul of the five elements in them, Water and Ether
predominating, and therefore their symbols were <EM>both aquatic
and</EM> <EM>fiery</EM>. &quot;Wisdom lies concealed under the
couch of him who rests on the golden lotos (<EM>padma</EM>)<EM>
</EM>floating on the water.&quot; In India it is Vishnu (one of
whose avatars was Budha, as claimed in days of old). The Prachetasas,
the worshippers of Narayana (who, like Poseidon moved or dwelt
<EM>over </EM>not under the waters), plunged into the depths of
the ocean for their devotions and remained therein 10,000 years;
and the Prachetasas are <EM>ten </EM>exoterically, but <EM>five</EM>,
esoterically. &quot;Prachetas&quot; is in Sanskrit, the name of
Varuna, the water god, Nereus, an aspect of the same as Neptune,
the Prachetasas being thus identical with the &quot;<EM>five</EM>
ministers&quot; of [[<EM>CHOZZAR</EM>]] (Poseidon) of the Peratae
Gnostics. These are respectively called [[<EM>AOT, AOAI, OTO,
OTOB</EM>]], &quot;the <EM>fifth,</EM> a<EM> triple </EM>name
(making Seven) being lost&quot;* -- <EM>i.e.</EM>, kept secret.
This much for the &quot;aquatic&quot; symbol; the &quot;fiery&quot;
connecting them with the fiery symbol -- spiritually. For purposes
of identity, let us remember that as the mother of the Prachetasas
was Savarna, the daughter of the Ocean, so was Amphitrite the
mother of Neptune's mystic &quot;ministers.&quot;
<P>
Now the reader is reminded that these &quot;five ministers&quot;
are symbolized both in the Dolphin, who had overcome the chaste
Amphitrite's unwillingness to wed Poseidon, and in Triton their
son. The latter, whose body above the waist is that of a man and
below a dolphin, a fish, is, again, most mysteriously connected
with Oannes, the Babylonian <EM>Dag</EM>, and further also with
the (fish) Avatar of Vishnu, <EM>Matsya, </EM>both teaching mortals
<EM>Wisdom. </EM>The Dolphin, as every mythologist knows, was
placed for his service by Poseidon among the constellations, and
became with the Greeks, <EM>Capricornus, </EM>the goat, whose
hind part is that of a dolphin, thus shown identical with <EM>Makara,
</EM>whose head is also that of an antelope and the body and tail
those of a fish. This is why the sign of the Makara was borne
on the banner of Kama deva, the Hindu god of love, identified,
in Atharva Veda, with Agni (the fire-god), the son of Lakshmi,
as correctly given by Harivansa. For Lakshmi and Venus are one,
and Amphitrite is the early form of Venus. Now Kama (the <EM>Makara-ketu</EM>)
is &quot;Aja&quot; (the unborn), and &quot;Atma-bhu&quot; (the
self-existent), and Aja is the <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS in the Rig-Veda,
as he is shown therein to be the first manifestation of the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE:
&quot;Desire first arose in <STRONG>I</STRONG>T, which was the
primal
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* So is Brahma's <EM>fifth</EM> head, said to be lost, burnt to
ashes by Siva's &quot;central eye&quot;; Siva being also <EM>panchanana
</EM>&quot;five faced.&quot; Thus the number is preserved and
secresy maintained on the true esoteric meaning.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 579 THE PUZZLES OF SYMBOLISM. </H6>

<P>
germ of mind,&quot; that &quot;which connects entity with non-entity&quot;
(or Manas, the <EM>fifth,</EM> with Atma, the <EM>seventh, </EM>esoterically)
say the Sages. This is<EM> the first stage. </EM>The second, on
the following plane of manifestation, shows Brahma (whom we select
as a representative for all the other first gods of the nations)
as causing to issue from his body his mind-born sons, &quot;Sanandana
and others,&quot; who, in the <EM>fifth</EM> &quot;creation,&quot;
and again in the ninth (for purposes of blind) become the Kumara.
Let us close by reminding the reader that goats were sacrificed
to Amphitrite and the Nereids on the sea-shore, as goats are sacrificed
to this day to Durga Kali, who is only the <EM>black </EM>side
of Lakshmi (Venus), the <EM>white</EM> side of Sakti; and by suggesting
what connection these animals may have with Capricornus, in which
appear twenty-eight stars in the form of a goat, which goat was
transformed by the Greeks into Amalthaea -- Jupiter's foster-mother.
Pan, the god of Nature, had goat's feet, and changed himself into
a goat at the approach of Typhon. But this is a mystery which
the writer dares not dwell upon at length, not being sure of being
understood. Thus the mystical side of the interpretation must
be left to the intuition of the student. Let us note one more
thing in relation to the mysterious number five. It symbolizes
at one and the same time the Spirit of life eternal and the Spirit
of life and love terrestrial -- in the human compound; and, it
includes divine and infernal magic, and the universal and the
individual quintessence of being. Thus, the five mystic words
or vowels (<EM>vide infra</EM>)<EM> </EM>uttered by Brahma at
&quot;creation,&quot; which forthwith became the <EM>Panchadasa
</EM>(certain Vedic hymns, attributed to that God) are in their
creative and magical potentiality, the <EM>white</EM> side of
the <EM>black </EM>Tantrik <EM>five</EM> &quot;makaras,&quot;
or the five<EM> m</EM>'<EM>s. </EM>&quot;Makara,&quot; the constellation,
is a seemingly meaningless and absurd name. Yet, even besides
its anagrammatical significance in conjunction with the term &quot;Kumara,&quot;
the numerical value of its first syllable and its esoteric resolution
into <EM>five</EM> has a very great and occult meaning in the
mysteries of nature.
<P>
Suffice it to say, that as the sign of Makara is connected with
the birth of the spiritual &quot;microcosm,&quot; and the death
or dissolution of the physical Universe (its passage into the
realm of the Spiritual)*; so the Dhyan Chohans, called in India
<EM>Kumara, </EM>are connected with both. Moreover, in the exoteric
religions, they have become the synonyms of the Angels of Darkness.
<EM>Mara </EM>is the God of Darkness, the Fallen One, and Death**;
and yet it is one of the names of Kama, the first god in the Vedas,
the Logos, from whom have sprung the Kumaras, and this
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* &quot;When the Sun passes away behind the 30th degree of <EM>Makara
</EM>and will reach no more the sign of the <EM>Meenam </EM>(pisces)
then the night of Brahma has come.&quot; . . .
<P>
** Death of every physical thing truly; but Mara is also the unconscious
quickener of the birth of the Spiritual.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 580 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
connects them still more with our &quot;fabulous&quot; Indian
Makara, and the crocodile-headed God in Egypt.* The crocodiles
in the Celestial Nile are <EM>Five</EM>, and the God Toum, the
primordial deity creating the heavenly bodies and the living beings,
calls forth these crocodiles in his <EM>fifth</EM> <EM>creation.
</EM>When Osiris, &quot;the defunct Sun,&quot; is buried and enters
into Amenti, the sacred crocodiles plunge into the abyss of primordial
Waters -- &quot;the great Green One.&quot; When the Sun of life
rises, they re-emerge out of the sacred river. All this is highly
symbolical, and shows how primeval esoteric truths found their
expression in identical symbols. But, as Mr. T. Subba Row truly
declares, &quot;The veil, that was dexterously thrown over certain
portions of the mystery connected with the (Zodiacal) signs by
the ancient philosophers, <EM>will never be fully lifted up for
the</EM> <EM>amusement or edification of the uninitiated public.</EM>&quot;
<P>
Nor was number five less sacred with the Greeks. The five words
(<EM>Panchadasa</EM>)<EM> </EM>of Brahma have become with the
Gnostics the &quot;Five Words&quot; written upon the akasic (shining)
garment of Jesus at his glorification: the words [[<EM>ZAMA ZAMA
OZZA PAXAMA, OZAI</EM>]], translated by the Orientalists &quot;the
robe, the glorious robe of my strength.&quot; These words were,
in their turn, the anagrammatic blind of the five mystic powers
represented on the robe of the &quot;resurrected&quot; Initiate
after his last trial of three days' trance; the five becoming
seven only after his <EM>death,</EM> when the Adept became the
full <STRONG>C</STRONG>HRISTOS, the full <STRONG>K</STRONG>RISHNA-<STRONG>V</STRONG>ISHNU,
<EM>i.e.</EM>, merged in Nirvana. The E <EM>Delphicum, </EM>a
sacred symbol, was the numeral <EM>five</EM>, again; and how sacred
it was is shown by the fact that the Corinthians (according to
Plutarch) replaced the wooden numeral in the Delphic Temple by
a bronze one; and this one was transmuted by Livia Augusta into
a <EM>fac-simile </EM>of gold.
<P>
It is easy to recognize in the two spirits -- the Greek accents
or signs (<IMG SRC="sd2-576a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">) spoken of by
Ragon (<EM>vide supra</EM>)<EM> </EM>-- Atma and Buddhi, or &quot;divine
spirit and its vehicle&quot; (spiritual soul).
<P>
The <EM>six </EM>or the &quot;Senary&quot; is dealt with later,
while the Septenary will be fully treated in the course of this
volume. (<EM>Vide the </EM>&quot;<EM>Mysteries of</EM> <EM>the
Hebdomad.</EM>&quot;)
<P>
The<EM> Ogdoad </EM>or 8 symbolizes the eternal and spiral motion
of cycles, the 8, <IMG SRC="sd2-580.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">, and
is symbolized in its turn by the Caduceus. It shows the regular
breathing of the Kosmos presided over by the eight great gods
-- the seven from the primeval Mother, the One and the Triad.
<P>
Then comes the number nine or the triple ternary. It is the number
which reproduces itself incessantly under all shapes and figures
in

If we now give our attention to the Egyptian cross, or the <EM>Tau,
</EM>we may discover this letter, so exalted by Egyptians, Greeks,
and Jews, to be mysteriously connected with the <EM>Decade. </EM>The<EM>
tau </EM>is the Alpha and the Omega of secret divine Wisdom, which
is symbolized by the initial and the final letter of Thot (Hermes).
Thot was the inventor of the Egyptian alphabet, and the letter
<EM>tau </EM>closed the alphabets of the Jews and the Samaritans,
who called this character the &quot;end&quot; or &quot;perfection,&quot;
&quot;culmination&quot; and &quot;security.&quot; Thence -- Ragon
tells us -- the words <EM>terminus </EM>(end), and <EM>tectum
</EM>(roof), are symbols of shelter and security, which is rather
a prosaic definition. But such is the usual destiny of ideas and
things in this world of spiritual decadence, if also of physical
progress. <STRONG>P</STRONG>AN was at one time <EM>absolute nature,
</EM>the one and <STRONG>G</STRONG>REAT-ALL; but when history
catches a first glimpse of him, Pan has already tumbled down into
a <EM>godling </EM>of the fields, a rural god; and history will
not recognize him, while theology makes of him the devil. Yet
his seven-piped flute, the emblem of the seven forces of nature,
of the seven planets, the seven musical notes, of all the septenary
harmony, in short, shows well his primordial character. So with
the Cross. Far earlier than the Jews had devised their golden
candlestick of the temple with <EM>three </EM>sockets on one side
and <EM>four </EM>on the other, and made of number 7 a feminine
number of generation,* thus introducing

<P>
* Reflecting on the <EM>Cross, </EM>the author of the &quot;Source
of Measures&quot; shows that this candlestick in the temple &quot;was
so composed that counting on either side there were <EM>four </EM>candle-sockets;
while at the apex, there being <EM>one in common </EM>to both
sides, there were in fact <EM>three </EM>to be counted on the
one side and four on the other, making in all number 7 upon the
self-same idea of <EM>one in common w</EM>ith the cross display.
Take a line of one unit in breadth by three units long, and place
it on an incline; take another of four units long, and lean it
upon this one, from an opposite incline, making the top unit of
the four in length the corner or apex of a triangle. This is the
display of the candlestick. Now take away the line of three units
in length and <EM>cross </EM>it on the one of four units in length,
and the cross form results. The same idea is conveyed in the six
days of the week in Genesis, crowned by the seventh, which was
used by itself as a base of circular measure&quot; (p. 51).<HR>

<P>
the phallic element into religion, the more spiritually-minded
nations had made of the cross (as 3, 4 = 7), their most sacred
divine symbol. In fact, Circle, Cross, and Seven -- the latter
being made a base of <EM>circular </EM>measurement -- are the
first primordial symbols. Pythagoras, who brought his wisdom from
India, left to posterity a glimpse into this truth. His school
regarded number 7 as a compound of numbers 3 and 4, which they
explained in a dual manner. On the plane of the noumenal world,
the triangle was, as the first conception of the manifested Deity,
its image: &quot;Father-Mother-Son&quot;; and the Quaternary,
the perfect number, was the noumenal, ideal root of all numbers
and things on the physical plane. Some students, in view of the
sacredness of Tetraktis and the Tetragrammaton, mistake the mystic
meaning of the Quaternary. The latter was with the ancients <EM>only
a secondary</EM> &quot;perfection,&quot; so to speak, because
it related only to the manifested planes. Whereas it is the <EM>Triangle,
</EM>the Greek <EM>delta, <IMG SRC="sd1-113.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,
which was the &quot;vehicle of the unknown Deity.&quot; A good
proof of it lies with the name of the Deity beginning with Delta.
Zeus </EM>was written [[<EM>Deus</EM>]], by the Boeotians,* thence
the <EM>Deus </EM>of the Latins. This, in relation to the metaphysical
conception, with regard to the meaning of the Septenary <EM>in
the phenomenal world, </EM>but for purposes of profane or exoteric
interpretation, the symbolism changed. <EM>Three</EM> became the
ideograph of the <EM>three material elements -- </EM>air, water,
earth; and four became the principle of all that which is neither
corporeal nor perceptible. But this has never been accepted by
the real Pythagoreans. Viewed as a compound of 6 and 1, the <EM>senary
</EM>and the <EM>unity, </EM>number seven was the invisible centre,
the spirit of everything (see further the explanation of 6), as
there exists no body with six lines constituting its form without
a <EM>seventh</EM> being found as the central point in it (see
crystals and snow-flakes in so-called <EM>inanimate </EM>nature).
Moreover, number <EM>seven</EM>, they said, has all the perfection
of the <STRONG>U</STRONG>NIT -- the number of numbers. For as
absolute unity is uncreated, and impartite (hence number-less)
and no number can produce it, so is the seven: no digit contained
within the decade can beget or produce it. And it is 4, which
affords an arithmetical division between <EM>unity</EM> and<EM>
seven, </EM>as it surpasses the former by the same number (three),
as it is itself surpassed by the seven, since <EM>four </EM>is
by as many numbers above <EM>one, </EM>as<EM> seven </EM>is above
<EM>four</EM>. (From a <STRONG>MS</STRONG>. supposed to be by
&quot;St. Germain.&quot;)

&quot;With the Egyptians number 7 was the symbol <EM>of life </EM>eternal,&quot;
says Ragon, and adds that this is why the Greek letter Z, which
is but a double 7 is the initial letter of <EM>Zao, </EM>&quot;I
live,&quot; and of Zeus, &quot;the father of all living.&quot;

<P>
Moreover, figure 6 was the symbol of the Earth during the autumn
and winter &quot;sleeping&quot; months, and figure 7 during spring
and summer, -- as the Spirit of life animated her at that time
-- the seventh or central informing Force. We find the same in
the Egyptian mythos and symbol of Osiris and Isis, personifying
Fire and Water <EM>metaphysically, </EM>and the Sun and the Nile
<EM>physically. </EM>The number of the Solar year, 365 in days,
is the numerical value of the word <EM>Neilos </EM>(Nile). This,
together with the Bull, with the Crescent and the ansated cross
between its horns, and the Earth under its astronomical symbol
-- <IMG SRC="sd2-29c.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> -- are the most phallic
symbols of later antiquity.
<P>
&quot;The Nile was the river of time with the number of a year,
or year and a day (364 + 1 = 365). It represented the parturient
water of Isis, or Mother Earth, the moon, the woman, and the cow,
also the <EM>workshop </EM>of Osiris, representing the <EM>T</EM>'<EM>sod
Olaum </EM>of the Hebrews. The ancient name of this river was
Eridanus, or the Hebrew Iardan, with the Coptic or old Greek suffix.
This was the door of the Hebrew word Jared, or '<EM>Source,</EM>'<EM>
</EM>or<EM> Descent </EM>. . . of the river Jordan, which had
the same mythical use with the Hebrews that the Nile had with
the Egyptians,* it was the source of descent, and held the waters
of life&quot; (Unpub. <STRONG>MS</STRONG>.) It was, to put it
plainly, the symbol of the personified Earth, or Isis, regarded
as the womb of that Earth. This is shown clearly enough; and Jordan
-- the river so sacred now to Christians -- held no more sublime
or poetical meaning in it than the parturient waters of the moon
(Isis, or Jehovah in his female aspect). Now, as shown by the
same scholar, Osiris was the sun, and the river Nile, and the
tropical year of 365 days; while Isis was the moon, the bed of
that river, or the mother earth &quot;for the parturient energies,
of which water was a necessity,&quot; as also the lunar year of
354 days, &quot;the time-maker of the periods of gestation.&quot;
All this then is sexual and phallic, and our modern scholars seem
to find in these symbols nothing beyond a physiological or phallic
meaning. Nevertheless, the three figures 365, or the number of
days in a solar year, have but to be read with the Pythagorean
Key to find in them a highly philosophical and moral meaning.
One instance will be sufficient. It can read:
<P>
<EM>The Earth -- animated by -- the Spirit of Life.</EM> 
<P>
...... 3 .................. 6 ........................ 5
<P>
Simply because 3 is equivalent to the Greek <EM>gamma,</EM> or
[[<EM>G</EM>]], which letter is the symbol of <EM>gaia </EM>(the
Earth); while the figure 6 is the symbol of the animating or informing
<EM>principle, </EM>and the 5 is the universal quintessence which
spreads in every direction and forms all matter. (St. Germain's
<STRONG>MS</STRONG>.)

</H6>

<P>
* It had no such meaning in the beginnings; nor during the earlier
dynasties.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 584 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
The few instances and examples brought forward reveal only one
small portion of the methods used to read the symbolical ideographs
and numerals of antiquity. The system being of an extreme and
complex difficulty, very few, even among the Initiates, could
master <EM>all</EM> the seven keys. Is it to be wondered, then,
that the metaphysical gradually dwindled down into the physical
nature; that the Sun, once upon a time the symbol of <STRONG>D</STRONG>EITY,
became, as aeons glided by, that of its creative ardour only;
and that thence it fell into a glyph of phallic significance?
But surely, it is not those whose method was (like Plato's) to
proceed from the universals down to the particulars, who could
ever have begun by symbolizing their religions by sexual emblems!
It is quite true, though uttered by that incarnated paradox, Eliphas
Levi, that &quot;man is God on Earth, and God is man in Heaven.&quot;
But this could not, and never did apply to the One Deity, only
to the Hosts of <STRONG>I</STRONG>TS incarnated beams, called
by us Dhyan Chohans, by the ancients, Gods; and now transformed
by the Church into devils on the <EM>left, </EM>and into the Saviour
on the <EM>right </EM>side!
<P>
But all such dogma grew out of the one root, the root of wisdom,
which grows and thrives on the Indian soil. There is not an Archangel
that could not be traced back to its prototype in the sacred land
of Aryavarta. These &quot;prototypes&quot; are all connected with
the Kumaras who appear on the scene of action by <EM>refusing</EM>
-- as<EM> </EM>Sanatkumara and Sananda -- to &quot;create progeny.&quot;
Yet they are called the &quot;creators&quot; of (thinking) man.
More than once they are brought into connection with Narada --
another bundle of <EM>apparent</EM> incongruities, yet a wealth
of philosophical tenets. Narada is the leader of the <EM>Gandharvas,</EM>
the celestial singers and musicians; <EM>esoterically, </EM>the
reason for it is explained by the fact that the latter (<EM>the
Gandharvas</EM>)<EM> </EM>are &quot;the instructors of men in
the secret sciences.&quot; It is they, who &quot;loving the women
of the Earth,&quot; disclosed to them the mysteries of creation;
or, as in the Veda -- the &quot;heavenly Gandharva&quot; is a
deity who knew and revealed the<EM> secrets of heaven and divine
truths, </EM>in general. If we remember what is said of this class
of Angels in Enoch and in the Bible, then the allegory is plain:
their leader, Narada, while refusing to procreate, leads men to
become gods. Moreover, all of these, as stated in the Vedas, are
<EM>Chhandaja </EM>(will-born) or incarnated (in different Manvantaras)
<EM>of their own will; -- </EM>and they are shown in exoteric
literature as existing age after age; some being &quot;cursed
to be re-born,&quot; others, incarnating as a duty. Finally, as
the Sanakadikas, the seven Kumaras who went to visit Vishnu on
the &quot;White Island&quot; (<EM>Sveta-dwipa</EM>) the island
inhabited by the Maha Yogins -- they are connected with <EM>Sakadwipa
</EM>and the Lemurians and Atlanteans of the Third and Fourth
Races.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 585 SEEMING CONTRADICTIONS. </H6>

<P>
In Esoteric Philosophy, the Rudras (Kumaras, Adityas, Gandharvas,
Asuras, etc.) are the highest Dhyan Chohans or Devas as regards
intellectuality. They are those who, owing to their having acquired
by self-development the <EM>five-fold</EM> nature -- hence the
sacredness of number <EM>five</EM> -- became independent of the
pure <EM>Arupa </EM>devas. This is a mystery very difficult to
realize and understand correctly. For, we see that those who were
&quot;obedient to law&quot; are, equally with the <EM>rebels,
doomed to be reborn in every age. </EM>Narada, the Rishi, is cursed
by Brahma to incessant peripateticism on Earth, <EM>i.e.</EM>,
to be constantly reborn. He is a rebel against Brahma, and yet
has no worse fate than the <EM>Jayas --</EM> the<EM> </EM>twelve
great <EM>creative </EM>gods produced by Brahma as <EM>his assistants
in the functions of creation. </EM>For the latter, lost in meditation,
only <EM>forgot to create; </EM>and for this, they are equally
cursed by Brahma to be born in every <EM>manvantara. </EM>And
still they are termed -- together with the rebels <EM>-- Chhandajas,
</EM>or those born of their own will in human form!
<P>
All this is very puzzling to one who is unable to read and understand
the Puranas except in their dead letter sense.* Hence we find
the Orientalists refusing <EM>to be puzzled, </EM>and cutting
the Gordian knot of perplexity by declaring the whole scheme &quot;figments&quot;
&quot;of Brahminical fancy and love of exaggeration.&quot; But
to the student of occultism, the whole is pregnant with deeply
philosophical meaning. We willingly leave the rind to the Western
Sanskritist, but claim the essence of the fruit for ourselves.
We do more: we concede that in one sense much in these so-called
&quot;fables&quot; refers to astronomical allegories about constellations,
asterisms, stars, and planets. Yet, while the <EM>Gandharva</EM>
of the Rig-Veda may there be made to personify the fire of the
Sun, the<EM> Gandharva devas </EM>are entities both of a physical
and psychic character; while the Apsarasas (with other Rudras)
are both <EM>qualities</EM> and<EM> quantities. </EM>In short,
if ever unravelled, the theogony of the Vedic Gods will reveal
fathomless mysteries of Creation and being. Truly says Parasara:
&quot;These thirty-three divinities exist age after age, and their
appearance and disappearance is in the same manner as the sun
sets and rises again.&quot; (Book I., xv.)
<P>
There was a time, when the Eastern symbol of the Cross and Circle,
the<EM> Swastica, </EM>was universally adopted. With the esoteric
(and, for the matter of that, exoteric) Buddhist, the Chinaman
and the Mongolian, it means &quot;the 10,000 truths.&quot; These
truths, they say, belong to the
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Yet this sense, if once mastered, will turn out to be the secure
casket which holds the keys to the Secret Wisdom. True, a casket
so profusely ornamented that its fancy work hides and conceals
entirely any spring for opening it, and thus makes the unintuitional
believe it has not, and cannot have, any opening in it. Still
the Keys are there, deeply buried, yet ever present to him who
searches for them.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 586 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
mysteries of the unseen Universe and primordial Cosmogony and
Theogony. &quot;Since Fohat crossed the Circle like two lines
of flame (horizontally and vertically), the hosts of the Blessed
Ones have never failed to send their representatives upon the
planets they are made to watch over from the beginning.&quot;
This is why the <EM>Swastica </EM>is always placed -- as the ansated
Cross was in Egypt -- on the breasts of the defunct mystics. It
is found on the heart of the images and statues of Buddha, in
Tibet and Mongolia. It is the <EM>seal </EM>placed also on the
hearts of the living Initiates, burnt into the flesh, for ever,
with some. This, because they have to keep those truths inviolate
and intact, in eternal silence and secrecy to the day these are
perceived and read by their chosen successors -- new Initiates
-- &quot;worthy of being entrusted with the ten thousand perfections.&quot;
So degraded, however, has it now become, that it is often placed
on the headgear of the &quot;gods,&quot; the hideous idols of
the sacrilegious <EM>Bhons,</EM> the<EM> Dugpas </EM>(Sorcerers)
of the Tibetan borderlands; until found out by a <EM>Galukpa </EM>and
torn off together with the head of the &quot;god;&quot; though
it would be better were it that of the worshipper which was severed
from the sinful body. Still, it can never lose its mysterious
properties. Throw a retrospective glance, and see it used alike
by the Initiates and Seers, as by the priests of Troy (found by
Schliemann on the site of that old city). One finds it with the
old Peruvians, the Assyrians, Chaldeans, as well as on the walls
of the old-world cyclopean buildings; in the catacombs of the
<EM>New </EM>world, and in those of the <EM>Old</EM> (?), at Rome,
where, because the first Christians are supposed to have concealed
themselves and their religion, it is called <EM>Crux Dissimulata.</EM>

&quot;According to de Rossi, the Swastica from an early period
was a favourite form of the cross <EM>employed with an occult

centuries after the Christian era the foundation of the Christian
religion in a crucified Redeemer is entirely absent from Christian
art! The earliest known form of the human figure on the cross
is the crucifix presented by Pope Gregory the Great to Queen Theodolinde
of Lombardy, now in the Church of St. John at Monza, whilst no
image of the Crucified is found in the Catacombs at Rome earlier
than that of San Giulio, belonging to the seventh or eighth century.
. . . There is no Christ and no Crucified; the Cross is the Christ
even as the Stauros cross was a type and a name of Horus, the
Gnostic Christ. The Cross, not the Crucified, is the essential
object of representation in its art, and of adoration in its religion.
The germ of the whole growth and development can be traced to
the cross. And that cross is pre-Christian, is pagan and heathen,
in half a dozen different shapes. The cult began with the cross,
and Julian was right in saying he waged a 'Warfare with the X';
which he obviously considered had been adopted by the A-Gnostics
and Mytholators to convey an impossible significance.* During
centuries the cross stood for the Christ, and was addressed as
if it were a living being. It was made divine at first, and humanized
at last.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Few world-symbols are more pregnant with real occult meaning than
the Swastica. It is symbolized by the figure 6; for, like that
figure, it points in its concrete imagery, as the ideograph of
the number does, to the Zenith and the Nadir, to North, South,
West, and East; one finds the unit everywhere, and that unit reflected
in all and every unit. It is the emblem of the activity of Fohat,
of the continual revolution of the &quot;wheels,&quot; and of
the Four Elements, the &quot;Sacred Four,&quot; in their mystical,
and not alone in their cosmical meaning; further, its four arms,
bent at right angles, are intimately related, as shown elsewhere,
to the Pythagorean and Hermetic scales. One initiated into the
mysteries of the meaning of the Swastica, say the Commentaries,
&quot;can trace on it, with mathematical precision, the evolution
of Kosmos and the whole period of <EM>Sandhya.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>Also &quot;the relation of the Seen to the Unseen,&quot;
and &quot;the first procreation of man and species.&quot;
<P>
To the Eastern Occultist the <STRONG>T</STRONG>REE of Knowledge
in the Paradise of man's own heart, becomes the Tree of Life eternal,
and has nought to do with man's animal senses. It is an absolute
mystery that reveals itself only through the efforts of the imprisoned
Manas and the Ego to liberate themselves from the thraldom of
sensuous perception and see, in the light of the one eternal present
Reality. To the Western Kabalist, and now far more to the superficial
Symbologist, nursed in the lethal atmosphere of materialistic
science, there is but one chief explanation of the mysteries of
the Cross -- its sexual element. Even the otherwise spiritualistic
modern commentator discerns in the Cross and Swastica, this feature
before all others.

This is perfect and no one can discern in this &quot;sexual worship,&quot;
with which the Orientalists love to break the head of Paganism.
But how about the Jews, and the exoteric religions of some Hindu
sects, especially the rites of the Vallabacharyas? For, as said,
the Lingham and Yoni of Siva-worship stand too high philosophically,
its modern degeneration notwithstanding, to be called a simple
phallic worship. But the <EM>tree </EM>or<EM> Cross-</EM>worship****<EM>
</EM>of the Jews, as denounced by their own Prophets, can hardly
escape the charge. The &quot;Sons of Sorcerers,&quot; &quot;the

lost an opportunity of &quot;enflaming themselves with idols under
every green tree,&quot; which denotes no metaphysical recreation.
It is from these <EM>monotheistic</EM> Jews that the Christian
nations have derived their religion, their &quot;God of gods,

of the Deity of the ancient philosophers. Let such believe in

but rather the <STRONG>F</STRONG>ORCE which directs its growth,
the ever mysterious, as the ever unknown. For this vital Force,
that makes the seed germinate, burst open and throw out shoots,
then form the trunk and branches, which, in their turn, bend down
like the boughs of the <EM>Aswattha, </EM>the holy Tree of Bodhi,
throw their seed out, take root and procreate other trees -- this
is the only <STRONG>F</STRONG>ORCE that has reality for him, as
it is the never-dying breath of life. The pagan philosopher sought
for the Cause, the modern is content with only the effects and
seeks the former in the latter. What is beyond, he does not know,
nor does the modern <EM>A-gnostic </EM>care: thus rejecting the
only knowledge upon which he can with full security base his Science.
Yet this manifested Force has an answer for him who seeks to fathom
it. He who sees in the cross, the decussated circle of Plato,
the <EM>Pagan, </EM>not the antitype of circumcision, as <EM>Christian
</EM>(St.) Augustine did,* is forthwith regarded by the Church
as a heathen: by Science, as a lunatic. This because, while refusing
to worship the god of physical generation, he confesses that he
can know nothing of the Cause which underlies the so-called <EM>First
</EM>Cause, the causeless Cause of this Vital Cause. Tacitly admitting
the All-Presence of the boundless Circle and making of it the
universal Postulate upon which the whole of the manifested universe
is based, the Sage keeps a reverential silence concerning that
upon which no mortal men should dare to speculate. &quot;The Logos
of God is the revealer of man, and the logos (the verb) of man
is the revealer of God,&quot; says Eliphas Levi in one of his
paradoxes. To this, the Eastern Occultist would reply: -- &quot;On
this condition, however, that man should be dumb on the CAUSE
that produced both God and its logos. Otherwise, he becomes invariably
the <EM>reviler, </EM>not the 'revealers' of the incognizable
Deity.&quot;
<P>
We have now to approach a mystery -- the Hebdomad in nature. Perchance,
all that we may say, will be attributed to coincidence. We may
be told that this number in nature is quite <EM>natural </EM>(so
we say too), and has no more significance than the illusion of
motion which forms the so-called &quot;Strobic circles.&quot;
No great importance was given to these &quot;singular illusions&quot;
when Professor Sylvanus Thompson exhibited them at the meeting
of the British Association in 1877. Nevertheless we should like
to learn the scientific explanation why seven should ever form
itself as a pre-eminent number -- six concentric circles around
a seventh, and seven rings within one another round a central
point, etc., etc. -- in this <EM>illusion, </EM>produced by a
swaying saucer, or any other vessel. We give the solution refused
by science in the section which follows.
