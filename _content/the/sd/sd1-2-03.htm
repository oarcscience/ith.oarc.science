PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE AND DIVINE THOUGHT.</H4>

&quot;As it would seem irrational to affirm that we already know
all existing causes, permission must be given to assume, if need

&quot;Assuming, what is not strictly accurate as yet, that the
undulatory hypothesis accounts for all the facts, we are called
on to decide whether the existence of an undulating Ether is thereby
proved. <I>We cannot positively affirm</I>

<I>that no other supposition</I> <I>will explain the facts. </I>Newton's
corpuscular hypothesis is admitted to have broken down on Interference;
and there is, at the present day, no rival. Still, it is extremely
desirable in all such hypotheses to find some collateral confirmation,
some evidence <I>aliunde</I>,<I> </I>of THE SUPPOSED ETHER. .
. . . Some Hypotheses consist of assumptions as to the minute
structure and operations of bodies. From the nature of the case,
these assumptions can never be proved by direct means. Their only
merit is <I>their suitability to express the phenomena. </I>They
are REPRESENTATIVE FICTIONS.&quot; -- (&quot;<I>Logic</I>,&quot;<I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Ether, this <EM>hypothetical </EM>Proteus, one of the &quot;representative
<EM>Fictions</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>of modern Science -- which, nevertheless,
was so long <EM>accepted</EM> --<EM> </EM>is one of the lower
&quot;principles&quot; of what we call PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE (Akasa,
in Sanskrit), one of the <EM>dreams </EM>of old, and which has
now become again the dream of modern science. It is the greatest,
just as it is the boldest, of the surviving speculations of ancient
philosophers. For the Occultists, however, both ETHER and the
Primordial Substance are a reality. To put it plainly, ETHER is
the Astral Light, and the Primordial Substance is <STRONG>A</STRONG>KASA,
the <EM>Upadhi </EM>of DIVINE THOUGHT.
<P>
In modern language, the latter would be better named COSMIC IDEATION
-- Spirit; the former, COSMIC SUBSTANCE, Matter. These, the Alpha
and the Omega of Being, are but the two <EM>facets </EM>of the
one Absolute Existence. The latter was never addressed, or even
mentioned, by any name in antiquity, except allegorically. In
the oldest Aryan race, the Hindu, the worship of the intellectual
classes never consisted (as with the Greeks) in a fervent adoration
of marvellous form and art, which led later on to anthropomorphism.
But while the Greek philosopher adored form, and the Hindu sage
alone &quot;perceived the true relation of earthly beauty and
eternal truth&quot; -- the uneducated of every nation understood
neither, at any time.
<P>
They do not understand it even now. The evolution of the <STRONG>G</STRONG>OD-IDEA
proceeds apace with man's own intellectual evolution. So true
it is that the noblest ideal to which the religious Spirit of
one age can soar, will appear but a gross caricature to the philosophic
mind in a succeeding epoch! The philosophers themselves had to
be <EM>initiated into perceptive mysteries</EM>,<EM> </EM>before
they could grasp the correct idea of the ancients in relation
to this most metaphysical subject. Otherwise -- outside such initiation
-- for every thinker there will be a &quot;Thus far shalt thou
go and no farther,&quot; mapped out by his intellectual capacity,
as clearly and as unmistakeably as there is for the progress of
any nation or race in its cycle by the law of Karma. Outside of
initiation, the ideals of contemporary religious thought must
always have their wings clipped and remain unable to soar higher;
for idealistic as well as realistic thinkers, and even free-thinkers,
are but the outcome and the natural product of their respective
environments and periods. The ideals of both are only<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 327 DIVINE THOUGHT, OR CINERITIOUS MATTER.
</H6>

<P>
the necessary results of their temperaments, and the outcome of
that phase of intellectual progress to which a nation, in its
collectivity, has attained. Hence, as already remarked, the highest
flights of modern (Western) metaphysics have fallen far short
of the truth. Much of current Agnostic speculation on the existence
of the &quot;First Cause&quot; is little better than veiled materialism
-- the terminology alone being different. Even so great a thinker
as Mr. Herbert Spencer speaks of the &quot;Unknowable&quot; occasionally
in terms that demonstrate the lethal influence of materialistic
thought, which, like the deadly Sirocco, has withered and blighted
all current ontological speculation.*
<P>
From the early ages of the Fourth Race, when Spirit alone was
worshipped and the mystery was made manifest, down to the last
palmy days of Grecian art at the dawn of Christianity -- the Hellenes
alone had dared to raise publicly an altar to the <STRONG>U</STRONG>NKNOWN
<STRONG>G</STRONG>OD. Whatever St. Paul may have had in his profound
mind when declaring to the Athenians that this &quot;unknown,&quot;
ignorantly worshipped by them, was the true God announced by himself
-- that Deity <EM>was not </EM>&quot;Jehovah&quot; (<EM>see </EM>&quot;<EM>The
Holy of Holies</EM>&quot;),<EM> </EM>nor was he &quot;The Maker
of the world and all things.&quot; For it is not the &quot;God
of Israel&quot; but the &quot;Unknown&quot; of the ancient and
modern Pantheist that &quot;dwelleth not in temples <EM>made with
hands</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(Acts xviii., 23-4).
<P>
Divine thought cannot be defined, or its meaning explained, except
by the numberless manifestations of Cosmic Substance in which
the former <EM>is sensed </EM>spiritually by those who can do
so. To say this, after having defined it as the Unknown Deity,
abstract, impersonal, sexless, which must be placed at the root
of every Cosmogony and its subsequent evolution, is equivalent
to saying nothing at all. It is like attempting a transcendental
equation of conditions for the true values of a set, having in
hand for deducing them only a number of <EM>unknown</EM> quantities.
Its place is found in the old primitive Symbolic charts, in which,
as shown in the text, it is represented by a boundless darkness,
on the ground of which appears the first central point in white
-- thus symbolising coeval and co-eternal <STRONG>S</STRONG>PIRIT-<STRONG>M</STRONG>ATTER
making its appearance in the phenomenal world, before its first
differentiation. When &quot;the one becomes two,&quot; it may
then be
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* For instance, when he terms the &quot;First Cause&quot; -- the
<STRONG>U</STRONG>NKNOWABLE -- a &quot;power <EM>manifesting </EM>through
phenomena,&quot; and &quot;an infinite eternal <EM>Energy</EM>&quot;
(?) it is clear that he has grasped solely the <EM>physical </EM>aspect
of the mystery of Being -- the Energies of Cosmic Substance only.
The co-eternal aspect of the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE <STRONG>R</STRONG>EALITY
-- Cosmic Ideation -- (as to its <EM>noumenon</EM>,<EM> </EM>it
seems <EM>non-existent </EM>in the mind of the great thinker)
is absolutely omitted from consideration. Without doubt, this
<EM>one-sided </EM>mode of dealing with the problem is due largely
to the pernicious Western practice of subordinating consciousness,
or regarding it as a &quot;by-product&quot; of molecular motion.
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 328 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
referred to as Spirit <EM>and</EM> matter. To &quot;Spirit&quot;
is referable every manifestation of consciousness, reflective
or direct, and of <EM>unconscious purposiveness </EM>(to adopt
a modern expression used in Western <EM>philosophy</EM>,<EM> </EM>so-called)
as evidenced in the Vital Principle, and Nature's submission to
the majestic sequence of immutable law. &quot;Matter&quot; must
be regarded as objectivity in its purest abstraction -- the self-existing
basis whose septenary manvantaric differentiations constitute
the objective reality underlying the phenomena of each phase of
conscious existence. During the period of Universal Pralaya, Cosmic
Ideation is nonexistent; and the variously differentiated states
of Cosmic Substance are resolved back again into the primary state
of abstract potential objectivity.
<P>
Manvantaric impulse commences with the re-awakening of Cosmic
Ideation (the &quot;Universal Mind&quot;) concurrently with, and
parallel to the primary emergence of Cosmic Substance -- the latter
being the manvantaric vehicle of the former -- from its undifferentiated
<EM>pralayic </EM>state. Then, absolute wisdom mirrors itself
in its Ideation; which, by a transcendental process, superior
to and incomprehensible by human Consciousness, results in Cosmic
Energy (<EM>Fohat</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Thrilling through the bosom
of inert Substance, <EM>Fohat </EM>impels it to activity, and
guides its primary differentiations on all the Seven planes of
Cosmic Consciousness. There are thus <EM>Seven Protyles </EM>(as
they are now called), while Aryan antiquity called them the Seven
Prakriti, or Natures, serving, severally, as the <EM>relatively
</EM>homogeneous basis, which in the course of the increasing
heterogeneity (in the evolution of the Universe) differentiate
into the marvellous complexity presented by phenomena on the planes
of perception. The term &quot;relatively&quot; is used designedly,
because the very existence of such a process, resulting in the
primary segregations of undifferentiated Cosmic Substance into
its septenary bases of evolution, compels us to regard the <EM>protyle*
</EM>of<EM> </EM>each plane as only a <EM>mediate </EM>phase assumed
by Substance in its passage from abstract, into full objectivity.
<P>
Cosmic Ideation is said to be non-existent during Pralayic periods,
for the simple reason that there is no one, and nothing, to perceive
its effects. There can be no manifestation of Consciousness, semi-consciousness,
or even &quot;unconscious purposiveness,&quot; except through
the
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The term <EM>Protyle </EM>is due to Mr. Crookes, the eminent
chemist, who has given that name to <EM>pre-Matter</EM>,<EM> </EM>if
one may so call primordial and purely homogeneous substances,
suspected, if not actually yet found, by Science in the ultimate
composition of the atom. But the incipient segregation of primordial
matter into atoms and molecules takes its rise subsequent to the
evolution of the Seven <EM>Protyles. </EM>It is the last of these
-- having recently detected the possibility of its existence on
our plane -- that Mr. Crookes is in search of.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 329 THE UNIVERSAL ILLUSION.</H6>

<P>
vehicle of matter; that is to say, on this our plane, wherein
human consciousness <EM>in its normal state </EM>cannot soar beyond
what is known as transcendental metaphysics, it is only through
some molecular aggregation or fabric that Spirit wells up in a
stream of individual or sub-conscious subjectivity. And as Matter
existing apart from perception is a mere abstraction, both of
these aspects of the <STRONG>A</STRONG>BSOLUTE -- Cosmic Substance
and Cosmic Ideation -- are mutually inter-dependent. In strict
accuracy -- to avoid confusion and misconception -- the term &quot;Matter&quot;
ought to be applied to the aggregate of objects of possible perception,
and &quot;Substance&quot; to <EM>noumena; </EM>for inasmuch as
the phenomena of <EM>our </EM>plane are the creation of the perceiving
Ego -- the modifications of its own subjectivity -- all the &quot;states
of matter representing the aggregate of perceived objects&quot;
can have but a relative and purely phenomenal existence for the
children of our plane. As the modern Idealists would say, the
co-operation of Subject and Object results in the Sense-object
or phenomenon. But this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion
that it is the same on all other planes; that the co-operation
of the two on the planes of their septenary differentiation results
in a septenary aggregate of phenomena which are likewise non-existent
<EM>per se</EM>,<EM> </EM>though concrete realities for the Entities
of whose experience they form a part, in the same manner as the
rocks and rivers around us are real from the stand-point of a
physicist, though unreal illusions of sense from that of the metaphysician.
It would be an error to say, or even conceive such a thing. From
the stand-point of the highest metaphysics, the whole Universe,
gods included, is an illusion; but the illusion of him who is
in himself an illusion differs on every plane of consciousness;
and we have no more right to dogmatise about the possible nature
of the perceptive faculties of an Ego on, say, the sixth plane,
than we have to identify our perceptions with, or make them a
standard for, those of an ant, in <EM>its </EM>mode of consciousness.
The pure object apart from consciousness* is unknown to us, while
living on the plane of our three-dimensional World; as we know
only the mental states it excites in the perceiving Ego. And,
so long as the contrast of Subject and Object endures -- to wit,
as long as we enjoy our five senses and no more, and do not know
how to divorce our all-perceiving <EM>Ego</EM> (the Higher Self)
from the thraldom of these senses -- so long will it be impossible
for the <EM>personal </EM>Ego to break through the barrier which
separates it from a
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Cosmic Ideation focussed in a principle or <EM>upadhi</EM> (basis)
results as the consciousness of the individual Ego. Its manifestation
varies with the degree of <EM>upadhi</EM>,<EM> e.g.</EM>,<EM>
</EM>through that known as <EM>Manas </EM>it wells up as Mind-Consciousness;
through the more finely differentiated fabric (sixth state of
matter) of the <EM>Buddhi </EM>resting on the experience of Manas
as its basis -- as a stream of spiritual INTUITION.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 330 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
knowledge of <EM>things in themselves </EM>(<EM>or Substance</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>That Ego, progressing in an arc of ascending subjectivity,
must exhaust the experience of every plane. But not till the Unit
is merged in the ALL, whether on this or any other plane, and
Subject and Object alike vanish in the absolute negation of the
Nirvanic State (negation, again, only <EM>from our plane</EM>),<EM>
</EM>is<EM> </EM>scaled that peak of Omniscience -- the Knowledge
of things-in-themselves; and the solution of the yet more awful
riddle approached, before which even the highest Dhyan Chohan
must bow in silence and ignorance -- the unspeakable mystery of
that which is called by the Vedantins, the <STRONG>P</STRONG>ARABRAHMAM.
<P>
Therefore, such being the case, all those who sought to give a
name to the incognizable Principle have simply degraded it. Even
to speak of Cosmic Ideation -- save in its <EM>phenomenal </EM>aspect
--<EM> </EM>is like trying to bottle up primordial Chaos, or to
put a printed label on <STRONG>E</STRONG>TERNITY.
<P>
What, then, is the &quot;primordial Substance,&quot; that mysterious
object of which Alchemy was ever talking, and which became the
subject of philosophical speculation in every age? What can it
be finally, even in its phenomenal pre-differentiation? Even <EM>that
</EM>is ALL in manifested Nature and -- <EM>nothing </EM>to our
senses. It is mentioned under various names in every Cosmogony,
referred to in every philosophy, and shown to be, to this day,
the ever grasp-eluding <STRONG>P</STRONG>ROTEUS in Nature. We
touch and do not feel it; we look at it without seeing it; we
breathe it and do not perceive it; we hear and smell it without
the smallest cognition that it is there; for it is in every molecule
of that which in our illusion and ignorance we regard as Matter
in any of its states, or conceive as a feeling, a thought, an
emotion. . . . In short, it is the &quot;<EM>upadhi</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>or vehicle, of every possible phenomenon, whether physical,
mental, or psychic. In the opening sentences of <EM>Genesis</EM>,<EM>
</EM>as in the Chaldean Cosmogony; in the <EM>Puranas </EM>of
India, and in the <EM>Book of the Dead </EM>of Egypt, it opens
everywhere the cycle of manifestation. It is termed &quot;Chaos,&quot;
and the face of the waters, incubated by the Spirit proceeding
from the Unknown, under whatever name. (<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Chaos</EM>,<EM>
Theos</EM>,<EM> Kosmos.</EM>&quot;)
<P>
The authors of the sacred Scriptures in India go deeper into the
origin of things evolved than Thales or Job, for they say: --
<P>
&quot;From <STRONG>I</STRONG>NTELLIGENCE (called <STRONG>M</STRONG>AHAT
in the Puranas) associated with <STRONG>I</STRONG>GNORANCE (Iswar,
as a <EM>personal </EM>deity)<EM> attended by its projective power</EM>,<EM>
</EM>in which the quality of dulness (<EM>tamas</EM>,<EM> </EM>insensibility)
predominates, proceeds <EM>Ether </EM>-- from ether, air; from
air, heat; from heat, water; and from water, earth &quot;with
everything on it.&quot; &quot;From THIS, from this same SELF,
was the Ether produced,&quot; says the Veda. (<EM>Taittiriya Upanishad
II</EM>. 1).
<P>
It becomes thus evident that it is not <EM>this </EM>Ether --
sprung at the fourth<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 331 ETHER, AS ITS NOUMENON.</H6>

<P>
remove from an <EM>Emanation </EM>of Intelligence &quot;associated
with Ignorance&quot; -- which is the high principle, the <EM>deific
</EM>Entity worshipped by the Greeks and Latins under the name
of &quot;<EM>Pater omnipotens AEther</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>and
&quot;<EM>Magnus AEther</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>in its collective
aggregates. The septenary gradation, and the innumerable subdivisions
and differences, made by the ancients between the powers of <EM>Ether
</EM>collectively, from its outward fringe of effects, with which
our Science is so familiar, up to the &quot;Imponderable Substance,&quot;
once admitted as the &quot;Ether of Space,&quot; now about to
be rejected, has been ever a vexing riddle for every branch of
knowledge. The mythologists and symbologists of our day, confused
by this incomprehensible glorification, on the one hand, and degradation
on the other, of the same deified entity and in the same religious
systems, are often driven to the most ludicrous mistakes. The
Church, firm as a rock in each and all of her early errors of
interpretation, has made of Ether the abode of her Satanic legions.*
The whole hierarchy of the &quot;Fallen&quot; angels is there;
the <EM>Cosmocratores </EM>-- or the &quot;world bearers,&quot;
(according to Bossuet);<EM> Mundi Tenentes</EM> --<EM> </EM>the
&quot;world holders,&quot; as Tertullian calls them; and <EM>Mundi
Domini </EM>&quot;world dominations,&quot; or rather <EM>dominators</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the <EM>Curbati</EM>,<EM> </EM>or &quot;Curved,&quot; etc.,
who thus make of the stars and celestial orbs in their course
-- Devils!
<P>
The difference made between the seven states of Ether (itself
one of the Seven Cosmic principles), while the AEther of the Ancients
is <EM>universal Fire</EM>,<EM> </EM>may be seen in the injunctions
by Zoroaster and Psellus, respectively. The former said: &quot;Consult
it only when it is without form or figure,&quot; <EM>absque forma
et figura</EM>,<EM> </EM>which means without flames or burning
coals. &quot;When it has a form -- <EM>heed it not</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>teaches Psellus; &quot;but when it is formless, obey it,
for it is then <EM>sacred fire</EM>,<EM> </EM>and all it will
reveal thee, shall be true.&quot;** This proves that Ether, itself
an aspect of Akasa, has in its turn several aspects or &quot;principles.&quot;
<P>
All the ancient nations deified AEther in its imponderable aspect
and potency. Virgil calls Jupiter, <EM>Pater omnipotens AEther</EM>,<EM>
</EM>&quot;the great AEther.&quot;*** The Hindus have also placed
it among their deities; under the name of Akasa (the synthesis
of AEther). And the author of the <EM>Homoiomerian</EM> 
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* For it is thus that the Church has interpreted verse 12 in the
VI. Chapter to the Ephesians. &quot;For we wrestle not against
flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
the rulers of the darkness of this world.&quot; Further on St.
Paul mentions the spiritual <EM>malices</EM> (&quot;wickedness&quot;
in English texts) SPREAD IN THE AIR -- &quot;<EM>Spiritualia nequitiae
coelestibus</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>the Latin texts giving various
names to these &quot;malices,&quot; the innocent &quot;Elementals.&quot;
But the Church is right this time, though wrong in calling them
all devils. The ASTRAL LIGHT or lower Ether <EM>is </EM>full of
conscious and semi-conscious and unconscious entities; only the
church has less <EM>power </EM>over them than over invisible microbes
or mosquitoes.

<P>
***<EM> Georgica. </EM>Book II.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 332 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
System of philosophy, Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, firmly believed
that the spiritual prototypes of all things, as well as their
elements, were to be found in the boundless Ether where they were
generated, whence they evolved, and whither they returned -- an
Occult teaching.
<P>
It thus becomes clear that it is from Ether in its highest synthetic
aspect, once anthropomorphised, that sprung the first idea of
a personal creative deity. With the philosophical Hindus the elements
are <EM>Tamas</EM>,<EM> i.e.</EM>, &quot;unenlightened by <EM>intellect</EM>,<EM>
</EM>which they obscure.&quot;
<P>
We have now to exhaust the question of the mystical meaning of
&quot;Primordial Chaos&quot; and of the Root-Principle, and show
how they were connected in the ancient philosophies with Akasa,
wrongly translated AEther, and also with <EM>Maya </EM>(illusion)
-- of which <EM>Ishwara </EM>is the male aspect. We shall speak
further on of the <EM>intelligent </EM>&quot;principle,&quot;
or rather of the invisible <EM>immaterial </EM>properties, in
the visible and material elements, that &quot;sprung from the
<EM>primordial </EM>Chaos.&quot;
<P>
For, &quot;What is the primordial Chaos but AEther?&quot; it is
asked in &quot;ISIS UNVEILED.&quot; Not the <EM>modern </EM>Ether;
not such as is recognised now, but such as <EM>was </EM>known
to the ancient philosophers long before the time of Moses; but
AEther, with all its mysterious and occult properties, containing
in itself the germs of universal creation. <EM>Upper A</EM>Ether
or Akasa, is the celestial virgin and mother of every existing
form and being, from whose bosom, as soon as &quot;incubated&quot;
by the Divine Spirit, are called into existence Matter and Life,
Force and Action. AEther is the Aditi of the Hindus, and it is
Akasa. Electricity, magnetism, heat, light, and chemical action
are so little understood even now that fresh facts are constantly
widening the range of our knowledge. Who knows where ends the
power of this protean giant -- AEther; or whence its mysterious
origin? Who, we mean, that denies the spirit that works in it,
and evolves out of it all visible forms?
<P>
It will be an easy task to show that the cosmogonical legends
all over the world are based on a knowledge by the ancients of
those sciences, which have allied themselves in our days in support
of the doctrine of evolution; and that further research may demonstrate
that those ancients were far better acquainted with the fact of
evolution itself, embracing both its physical and spiritual aspects,
than we are now. &quot;With the old philosophers, evolution was
a universal theorem, a doctrine embracing the <EM>whole</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and an established principle; while our modern evolutionists
are enabled to present us merely with speculative theoretics;
with <EM>particular</EM>,<EM> </EM>if not wholly <EM>negative
</EM>theorems. It is idle for the representatives of our modern
wisdom to close the debate and pretend that the question is settled,
merely because the obscure phraseology of the Mosaic, far later,
account clashes with the definite exegesis of 'Exact Science'&quot;<EM>
</EM>(&quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>&quot;)<EM>.</EM> <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 333 WHAT MANU SAYS OF THIS.</H6>

<P>
If one turns to the &quot;Laws (or Ordinances) of Manu,&quot;
one finds the prototype of all these ideas. Mostly lost (to the
Western world) in their original form, disfigured by later interpolations
and additions, they have, nevertheless, preserved quite enough
of their ancient Spirit to show its character. &quot;Removing
the darkness, the Self-existent Lord&quot; (<EM>Vishnu</EM>,<EM>
Narayana</EM>,<EM> etc.</EM>)<EM> </EM>becoming manifest, and
&quot;wishing to produce beings from his Essence, created, in
the beginning, water alone. In that he cast seed. . . . . That
became a golden Egg.&quot; (V. 6, 7, 8, 9.) Whence this Self-existent
Lord? It is called THIS, and is spoken of as &quot;Darkness, imperceptible,
without definite qualities, undiscoverable as if wholly in sleep.&quot;
(V. 5.) Having dwelt in that Egg for a whole divine year, he &quot;who
is called in the world Brahma,&quot; splits that Egg in two, and
from the upper portion he forms the heaven, from the lower the
earth, and from the middle the sky and &quot;the perpetual place
of waters.&quot; (12, 13.)
<P>
But there is, directly following these verses, something more
important for us, as it corroborates entirely our esoteric teachings.
From verse 14 to 36, evolution is given in the order described
in the Esoteric philosophy. This cannot be easily gainsaid. Even
Medhatithi, the son of Viraswamin, and the author of the Commentary,
&quot;the Manubhasya,&quot; whose date, according to the western
Orientalists, is 1,000 A.D., helps us with his remarks to the
elucidation of the truth. He showed himself either unwilling to
give out more, because he knew that truth which has to be kept
from the profane, or else he was really puzzled. Still, what he
does give out makes the septenary principle in men and nature
plain enough.
<P>
Let us begin with Chapter 1. of the &quot;Ordinances&quot; or
&quot;Laws&quot; after the Self-existent Lord, the <EM>unmanifesting
</EM>Logos of the Unknown &quot;Darkness,&quot; becomes manifested
in the golden Egg. It is from this &quot;Egg,&quot; from ----
<P>
(11.) That which is the undiscrete (undifferentiated) cause, eternal,
which <EM>Is and Is not</EM>,<EM> </EM>from It issued that male
who is called in the world Brahma. . . . .
<P>
Here we find, as in all genuine philosophical systems, even the
&quot;Egg&quot; or the Circle (or Zero), boundless Infinity, referred
to as <STRONG>I</STRONG>T,* and Brahma, the first <EM>unit </EM>only,
referred to as the <EM>male </EM>god,<EM> i.e.</EM>, the fructifying
Principle. It is <IMG SRC="sd1-333.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE"> or 10
(ten) the Decade. On the plane of the Septenary <EM>or our World
</EM>only, it is called Brahma. On that of the <EM>Unified Decade
</EM>in the realm of Reality, this male Brahma is an illusion.

justly observes here that it is the reverse of this and shows
already interpolation and rearranging; for it is <EM>Manas </EM>that
springs from <EM>Ahamkara </EM>or<EM> </EM>(Universal) Self-Consciousness,
as <EM>Manas </EM>in the microcosm springs from Mahat, <EM>or
Maha-Buddhi </EM>(Buddhi, in man). For Manas is dual, and as shown
and translated by Colebrooke, &quot;is <EM>serving both for sense
and action</EM>,<EM> </EM>is an organ by affinity, being cognate
with the rest.&quot; &quot;The rest&quot; means, here, that Manas,
our <EM>fifth</EM> principle (the fifth, because the body was
named the <EM>first</EM>,<EM> </EM>which is the reverse of the
true philosophical order)* is in affinity both with Atma-Buddhi
and with the lower four principles. Hence, our teaching: namely,
that Manas follows Atma-Buddhi to Devachan, and that the lower
(dregs, the residue of) Manas remains with Kama rupa, in <EM>Limbus</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or Kama-loka, the abode of the &quot;Shells.&quot;
<P>
(2.) Such is the meaning of <EM>Manas</EM>,<EM> </EM>which<EM>
</EM>&quot;<EM>is</EM>,<EM> and is not.</EM>&quot;
<P>
(3.) Medhatithi translates it as &quot;the one conscious of the
I,&quot; or Ego, not &quot;ruler,&quot; as the Orientalists do.
Thus they translate verse 16: &quot;He also, having made the subtile
parts of those six (the Great Self and the five organs of sense)
of unmeasured brightness, to enter into the elements of Self (<EM>Atmamatrasu</EM>)<EM>
</EM>created all beings.&quot;
<P>
When, according to Medhatithi, it ought to read <EM>matra-Chit
</EM>instead of &quot;Atmamatrasu,&quot; and thus be made to say:
--
<P>
&quot;He having pervaded the subtile parts of those six, of unmeasured
brightness, by elements of self, created all beings.&quot;
<P>
This latter reading must be the correct one, since he, the <EM>Self</EM>,<EM>
</EM>is what we call Atma, and thus constitutes the seventh principle,
the synthesis of the &quot;<EM>six.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Such is
also the opinion of the editor of <EM>Manava-dharma Shastra</EM>,<EM>
</EM>who seems to have intuitionally entered far deeper into the
spirit of the philosophy than has the translator of the &quot;Ordinances
of Manu,&quot; the late Dr. Burnell. For he hesitates little between
the text of Kulluka and the Commentaries of Medhatithi. Rejecting
the <EM>tanmatra</EM>,<EM> </EM>or subtile elements, and the <EM>atmamatrasu
</EM>of Kulluka, he says, applying the principles to the Cosmic
<EM>Self:</EM> &quot;The six appear rather to be the <EM>manas
</EM>plus the five principles of Ether, air, fire, water, earth&quot;;
&quot;having united five portions of these six with the spiritual
element (the <EM>seventh</EM>)<EM> </EM>he (thus) created all
existing things;&quot; <EM>atmamatra </EM>is therefore the spiritual
atom as opposed to the elementary, not reflective &quot;elements
of himself.&quot; Thus he corrects the translation of verse --
&quot;17. As the subtile elements of bodily forms of This One
depend on these six, so

parts (or principles), which reading is borne out by verse 19,
which says: --

that &quot;the five elements plus mind (<EM>Manas</EM>)<EM> </EM>and
Self-Consciousness (Ahamkara)* are meant;&quot; &quot;subtile
elements,&quot; as before (meaning) &quot;five portions of form&quot;
(or principles). For verse 20 shows it, when saying of these (five
elements, or &quot;five portions of form&quot; (<EM>rupa</EM>,<EM>
plus Manas </EM>and Self-Consciousness) that they constitute the
&quot;<EM>seven purusha</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>or<EM> principles</EM>,<EM>
</EM>called in the Puranas the &quot;Seven Prakritis.&quot;
<P>
Moreover, these &quot;five elements&quot; or &quot;five portions&quot;

This creative Brahma, issuing from the mundane or golden egg,
unites in himself both the male and the female principles. He
is, in short, the same as all the creative Protologoi. Of Brahma,
however, it could not be said, as of Dionysos: &quot;[[<EM>protogonon

truly, with David dancing nude before his <EM>symbol </EM>in the
ark -- because no licentious Dionysia were ever established in
his name and honour. All such public worship was exoteric, and
the great universal symbols were distorted universally, as those
of Krishna are now by the Vallabacharyas of Bombay, the followers
of the <EM>infant </EM>god. But are these popular gods the <EM>true
Deity? </EM>Are<EM> they </EM>the Apex and synthesis of the sevenfold
creation, man included? Never! Each and all are one of the rungs
of that septenary ladder of Divine Consciousness, pagan as Christian.
For Ain-Soph also is said to manifest through the <EM>Seven Letters

a &quot;long time.&quot; Nor is the term &quot;eternity&quot;

it is clearly stated that by Eternity and Immortality only &quot;existence

*** Orphic theogony is purely Oriental and Indian in its Spirit.
The successive transformations it has undergone, have now separated
it widely from the spirit of ancient Cosmogony, as may be seen
by comparing it even with Hesiod's theogony. Yet the truly Aryan
Hindu spirit breaks forth everywhere in both Hesiod's and the
Orphic theogony. (See the remarkable work of James Darmesteter,
<EM>Cosmogonies Aryennes</EM>,<EM> </EM>in his <EM>Essais Orientaux.</EM>)<EM>
</EM>Thus the original Greek conception of Chaos is that of the
Secret Wisdom Religion. In Hesiod, therefore, Chaos is infinite,
boundless, endless and beginningless in duration, an abstraction
at the same time as a visible presence. <STRONG>S</STRONG>PACE
filled with darkness, which is primordial matter in its <EM>precosmic

From it proceeds periodically the <STRONG>E</STRONG>NERGY, which
is reflected in the &quot;Deep&quot; or Chaos, the store-house
of future worlds, and, once awakened, stirs up and fructifies
the latent Forces, which are the ever present eternal potentialities
in it. Then awake anew the Brahmas and Buddhas -- the co-eternal
Forces -- and a new Universe springs into being. . . . .

In the <EM>Sepher Jezireh</EM>,<EM> </EM>the Kabalistic Book of
Creation, the author has evidently repeated the words of Manu.
In it, the Divine Substance is represented as having alone existed
from the eternity, boundless and absolute; and as having emitted
from itself the Spirit.* &quot;One is the Spirit of the living
God, blessed be <STRONG>I</STRONG>TS name, which liveth for ever!
Voice, Spirit, and Word, this is the Holy Spirit;&quot;** and
this is the Kabalistic abstract Trinity, so unceremoniously anthropomorphised
by the Christian Fathers. From this triple <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE
emanated the whole Kosmos. First from <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE emanated
number <STRONG>T</STRONG>WO, or Air (the Father), the creative
element; and then number <STRONG>T</STRONG>HREE, <EM>Water </EM>(the
Mother), proceeded from the air; <EM>Ether </EM>or<EM> Fire </EM>completes
the mystic four, the Arba-il.*** &quot;When the Concealed of the
Concealed wanted to reveal Himself, he first made a point (primordial
point, or the first Sephiroth, air, or Holy Ghost), shaped into
a sacred form (the ten Sephiroth, or the Heavenly man), and covered
it with a rich and splendid garment, <EM>that is the world.</EM>&quot;****

primordial elements have long been exiled, and our ambitious physicists
run races to determine who shall add one more to the fledgling

there rages a war in modern chemistry about terms. We are denied
the right to call these substances &quot;chemical elements,&quot;
for they are not &quot;primordial principles of self-existing
essences out of which the universe was fashioned,&quot; according
to Plato. Such ideas associated with the word <EM>element </EM>were
good enough for the &quot;old Greek philosophy,&quot; but modern
science rejects them; for, as Professor Crookes says, &quot;they
are unfortunate terms,&quot; and experimental science will have
&quot;nothing to do with any kind of essences except those which
it can see, smell, or taste. It leaves others to the metaphysicians.

The one prevailing, most distinct idea -- found in all ancient
teaching,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 340 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
with reference to Cosmic Evolution and the first &quot;creation&quot;
of our Globe with all its products, organic and <EM>inorganic
</EM>(strange word for an Occultist to use) -- is that the whole
Kosmos has sprung from the DIVINE THOUGHT. This thought impregnates
matter, which is co-eternal with the ONE REALITY; and all that
lives and breathes evolves from the emanations of the ONE <EM>Immutable
</EM>-- Parabrahm = Mulaprakriti, the eternal one-root. The former
of these is, so to say, the aspect of the central point turned
inward into regions quite inaccessible to human intellect, and
is absolute abstraction; whereas, in its aspect as <EM>Mulaprakriti</EM>
--<EM> </EM>the eternal root of all, -- it gives one some hazy
comprehension at least of the Mystery of Being.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Therefore, it was taught in the <I>inner</I> temples that
this visible universe of spirit and matter is but the concrete
image of the ideal abstraction; it was built on the model of the
first DIVINE IDEA. Thus our universe existed from Eternity in
a latent state. The soul animating this purely spiritual universe
is the central sun, the highest deity itself. It was not the <I>One</I>
who built the concrete form of the idea, but the first-begotten;
and as it was constructed on the geometrical figure of the dodecahedron,*
the first-begotten 'was pleased to employ twelve thousand years
in its creation.' The latter number is expressed in the Tyrrhenian
cosmogony,** which shows man created in the sixth millennium.
This agrees with the Egyptian theory of 6,000 'years'*** and with
the Hebrew computation. But it is the exoteric form of it. The
<I>secret </I>computation explains that the 'twelve thousand and
the 6,000 years' are YEARS OF <STRONG>B</STRONG>RAHMA -- one <I>day</I>
of Brahma being equal to 4,320,000,000 years. Sanchoniathon****
in his <I>Cosmogony</I>,<I> </I>declares that when the wind (spirit)
became enamoured of its own principles (the chaos), an intimate
union took place, which connection was called <I>pothos</I>,<I>
</I>and from this sprang the seed of all. And the chaos knew not
its own production, for it was <I>senseless; </I>but from its
embrace with the wind was generated Mot, or the ilus (mud).*****
From this proceeded the spores of creation and the generation
of the universe.

<P>
The fragments of the systems that have now reached us are rejected
as absurd fables. Nevertheless, occult Science -- having survived
even the great Flood that submersed the antediluvian giants and
with them their very memory, save in the Secret Doctrine, the
Bible and other Scriptures -- still holds the Key to all the world
problems.
<P>
Let us apply that Key to the rare fragments of long-forgotten
cosmogonies and try by their scattered parts to re-establish the
once Universal Cosmogony of the Secret Doctrine. The Key fits
them all. No one can study ancient philosophies seriously without
perceiving that the striking similitude of conception between
all -- in their exoteric form very often, in their hidden spirit
invariably -- is the result of no mere coincidence, but of a concurrent
design: and that there was, during the youth of mankind, one languages,
one knowledge, one universal religion, when there were no churches,
no creeds or sects, but when every man was a priest unto himself.
And, if it is shown that already in those ages which are shut
out from our sight by the exuberant growth of tradition, human
religious thought developed in uniform sympathy in every portion
of the globe; then, it becomes evident that, born under whatever
latitude, in the cold North or the burning South, in the East
or West, that thought was inspired by the same revelations, and
man was nurtured under the protecting shadow of the same TREE
OF KNOWLEDGE.

* Bordj is called a fire-mountain -- a volcano ; therefore it
contains fire, rock, earth and water: the male, or active and
the female, or passive, elements. The myth is suggestive.
