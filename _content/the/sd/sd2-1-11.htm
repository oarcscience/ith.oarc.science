<STRONG>E</STRONG>DENS, <STRONG>S</STRONG>ERPENTS, AND <STRONG>D</STRONG>RAGONS.
<P>
Whence the idea, and the true meaning of the term &quot;Eden&quot;?
Christians will maintain that the Garden of Eden is the holy Paradise,
the place <EM>desecrated by the sin </EM>of Adam and Eve; the
Occultist will deny this dead-letter interpretation, and show
the reverse. One need not believe and see in the Bible divine
revelation in order to say that this ancient book, if read esoterically,
is based upon the same universal traditions. What Eden was is
partially shown in <EM>Isis Unveiled.</EM>*
<P>
It was said that: &quot;The Garden of Eden as a locality is no
myth at all; it belongs to those landmarks of history which occasionally
disclose to the student that the <EM>Bible </EM>is not all mere
allegory. Eden, or the Hebrew <IMG SRC="sd2-202a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
Gan-Eden, meaning the park or the garden of Eden, is an archaic
name of the country watered by the Euphrates and its many branches,
from Asia and Armenia to the Erythraean sea.&quot; (A. Wilder
says that Gan-duniyas is a name of Babylonia.) In the Chaldean
&quot;<EM>Book of Numbers,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>the location is
designated in numerals, and in the cypher Rosicrucian manuscript,
left by Count St. Germain, it is fully described. In the Assyrian
<EM>Tablets </EM>it is rendered <EM>Ganduniyas. </EM>&quot;Behold,&quot;
says the <IMG SRC="sd2-202b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (<EM>Elohim</EM>)<EM>
</EM>of Genesis, &quot;the man is become as one of us.&quot; The
<EM>Elohim </EM>may be accepted in one sense for <EM>gods </EM>or
powers, and in another for <EM>Aleim, </EM>or priests -- the hierophants
initiated into the good and evil of this world; for there was
a college of priests called the <EM>Aleim, </EM>while the head
of their caste, or the chief of the hierophants was known as <EM>Java-Aleim.
</EM>Instead of becoming a neophyte, and gradually obtaining his
esoteric knowledge through a regular initiation, an <EM>Adam,
</EM>or Man, uses his intuitional faculties and, prompted by the
serpent (<EM>Woman </EM>and matter), tastes of the Tree of Knowledge
-- the esoteric or Secret Doctrine -- unlawfully. The priests
of Hercules, or Mel-karth, the &quot;Lord of the Eden,&quot; all
wore &quot;coats of skin.&quot; The text says: &quot;And <EM>Java-Aleim
</EM>made for Adam and his wife <IMG SRC="sd2-202c.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
'Chitonuth our.' &quot; The first Hebrew word, &quot;<EM>chiton,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>is the Greek [[<EM>Chiton</EM>]], <EM>Chiton. </EM>It became
a Slavonic word by adoption from the <EM>Bible, </EM>and means
a <EM>coat, </EM>an upper garment.
<P>
&quot;Though containing the same substratum of esoteric truth
as does every early Cosmogony, the Hebrew Scripture wears on its
face the marks of a double origin. Its Genesis is purely a reminiscence
of the Babylonian captivity. The names of places, men and even
objects, can be traced from the original text to the Chaldeans
and the Akkadians, the progenitors and Aryan instructors of the
former. It is strongly contested that the Akkad tribes of Chaldea,
Babylonia and Assyria were in

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 203 THE GARDEN OF EDEN, A COLLEGE.</H6>

<P>
any way cognate with the Brahmans of Hindostan; but there are
more proofs in favour of this opinion than otherwise. The Shemite
or Assyrian ought, perchance, to have been called the Turanian,
and the Mongolians have been denominated Scyths. But if the Akkadians
ever existed, otherwise than in the imagination of some ethnologists
and philologists, they certainly would never have been a Turanian
tribe, as some Assyriologists have striven to make us believe.
They were simply emigrants on their way to Asia Minor from India,
the cradle of humanity, and their sacerdotal adepts tarried to
civilize and initiate a barbarian people. Halevy proved the fallacy
of the Turanian mania in regard to Akkadian people, and other
scientists have proved that the Babylonian civilization was neither
born nor developed in that country. It was imported from India,
and the importers were Brahminical Hindus.&quot;
<P>
And now, ten years after this was written, we find ourselves corroborated
by Professor Sayce, who says in his first Hibbert lecture that
the culture of the Babylonian city Eridu was of <EM>foreign importation.
It </EM>came from India.
<P>
&quot;Much of the theology was borrowed by the Semites from the
non-Semitic Akkadians or proto-Chaldeans, whom they supplanted,
and whose local cults they had neither the will nor the power
to uproot. Indeed, throughout a long course of ages the two races,
Semites and Akkadians, lived side by side, their notions and worship
of the gods blending insensibly together.&quot;
<P>
Here, the Akkadians are called &quot;non-Semitic,&quot; as we
had insisted they were in &quot;<EM>Isis,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>which
is another corroboration. And we are no less right in always maintaining
that the Jewish Biblical history was a compilation of <EM>historical
</EM>facts, arranged from other people's history in Jewish garb
-- Genesis excluded, which is esotericism pure and simple. But
it is really from the Euxine to Kashmir and beyond, that science
has to search for the cradle -- or rather one of the chief cradles
-- of mankind and the sons of Ad-ah; and especially in after times,
when the Garden of Ed-en on the Euphrates became the college of
the astrologers and magi, the Aleim.
<P>
But this &quot;college&quot; and this Eden belong to the Fifth
Race, and are simply a faint reminiscence of the Adi-varsha, of
the primeval Third Race. What is the etymological meaning of the
word <EM>Eden? </EM>In Greek it is [<EM>hedone</EM>], signifying<EM>
voluptuousness. </EM>In this aspect it is no better than the Olympus
of the Greeks, Indra's heaven (Swarga) on Mount Meru, and even
the paradise full of <EM>Houris, </EM>promised by Mahomet to the
faithful. The Garden of Eden was never the property of the Jews;
for China, which can hardly be suspected of having known anything
of the Jews 2,000 <B>B.C</B>., has such a primitive garden in
Central Asia inhabited by the &quot;Dragons of Wisdom,&quot; the
Initiates. And according to Klaproth,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 204 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
the hieroglyphical chart copied from a Japanese Cyclopaedia in
the book <EM>of Fo-kone-ky, </EM>places its &quot;Garden of Wisdom&quot;
on the plateau of Pamir between the highest peaks of the Himalayan
ranges; and describing it as the culminating point of Central
Asia, shows the four rivers -- Oxus, Indus, Ganges, and Silo --
flowing from a common source, the &quot;<EM>Lake of the Dragons.</EM>&quot;
<P>
But this is not the Genetic Eden; nor is it the Kabalistical Garden
of Eden. For the former -- <EM>Eden Illa-ah </EM>-- means in one
sense Wisdom, a state like that of Nirvana, a paradise of Bliss;
while in another sense it refers to Intellectual man himself,
the container of the Eden in which grows the tree of Knowledge
of good and evil: man being the <EM>Knower </EM>thereof.
<P>
Renan and Barthelemy St. Hilaire, basing themselves &quot;on the
most solid inductions,&quot; think it impossible to doubt any
longer, and both place the cradle of humanity &quot;on the region
of the Timaus.&quot; Finally, the Asiatic Journal* concludes that:
&quot;All the traditions of the human race gathering its primitive
families at the region of their birth-place, show them to us grouped
around the countries where Jewish tradition places the Garden
of Eden; where the Aryans (Zoroastrians) established their Airyana-vaego
or the Meru (?). They are hemmed in to the North by the countries
which join the lake Aral, and to the South by Baltistan, or Little
Tibet. Everything concurs in proving that there was the abode
of that primitive humanity to which we have to be traced.&quot;
<P>
That &quot;primitive humanity&quot; was in its Fifth Race, when
the &quot;four-mouthed Dragon,&quot; the lake, of which very few
traces are now left, was the abode of the &quot;Sons of Wisdom,&quot;
the first mind-born sons of the Third Race. Yet it was neither
the only one nor the primitive cradle of humanity, though it was
the copy of the cradle, verily, of the first thinking <EM>divine
</EM>man. It was the <EM>Paradesa, </EM>the highland of the first
Sanskrit-speaking people, the <EM>Hedone, </EM>the country of
delight of the Greeks, but it was not the &quot;<EM>bower </EM>of
voluptuousness&quot; of the Chaldeans, for the latter was only
the reminiscence of it; and also because it was not there that
the <EM>Fall of Man </EM>occurred after the &quot;separation.&quot;
The Eden of the Jews was <EM>copied </EM>from the Chaldean <EM>copy.</EM>

<P>
That the Fall of man into generation occurred during the earliest
portion of what science calls the Mesozoic times, or the age of
the reptiles, is evidenced by the Bible phraseology concerning
the serpent, the nature of which is explained in the <EM>Zohar.
</EM>The question is not whether Eve's incident with the tempting
reptile is allegorical or textual, for no one can doubt that it
is the former, but to show the antiquity of the symbolism on the
very face of it, and that it was not only a Jewish but an universal
idea.

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 205 FLYING CAMELS.</H6>

<P>
Now we find in the <EM>Zohar </EM>a very strange assertion, one
that is calculated to provoke the reader to merry laughter by
its ludicrous absurdity. It tells us that the serpent, which was
used by <EM>Shamael </EM>(the supposed Satan), to seduce Eve,
was a kind of <EM>flying camel [[</EM>kamelomorphon]].
<P>
A &quot;flying camel&quot; is indeed too much for the most liberal-minded
<B>F.R.S</B>. Nevertheless, the <EM>Zohar, </EM>which can hardly
be expected to use the language of a Cuvier, was right in its
description:* for we find it called in the old Zoroastrian <STRONG>MSS</STRONG>.
<EM>Aschmogh, </EM>which in the Avesta is represented as having
lost after the Fall &quot;its <EM>nature and its name,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>and is described as a huge serpent with a camel's neck.
<P>
&quot;There are no winged serpents, nor veritable dragons,&quot;
asserts Salverte,** &quot; . . . grasshoppers are called by the
Greeks <EM>winged serpents, </EM>and this metaphor may have created
several narratives on the existence of winged serpents.&quot;
<P>
There are none <EM>now</EM>; but there is no reason why they should
not have existed during the Mesozoic age; and Cuvier, who has
reconstructed their skeletons, is a witness to &quot;flying camels.&quot;
Already, after finding simple fossils of certain saurians, the
great naturalist has written, that, &quot;if anything can justify
the Hydra and other monsters, whose figures were so often repeated
by mediaeval historians, it is incontestably the <EM>Plesiosaurus.</EM>&quot;***
<P>
We are unaware if Cuvier had added anything in the way of a further
<EM>mea culpa. </EM>But we may well imagine his confusion, for
all his slanders against archaic veracity, when he found himself
in the presence of a <EM>flying </EM>saurian, &quot;the Pterodactyl&quot;
(found in Germany), &quot;78 feet long, and carrying vigorous
wings attached to its reptilian body.&quot; That fossil is described
as a reptile, the <EM>little fingers of whose hands </EM>are so
elongated as to bear a long membranous wing. Here, then, the &quot;flying
camel&quot; of the Zohar is vindicated. For surely, between the
long neck of the Plesiosaurus and the membranous wing of the Pterodactyl,
or still better the Mosasaurus, there is enough scientific probability
to build a &quot;flying camel,&quot; or a long-necked dragon.
Prof. Cope, of Philadelphia, has shown that the Mosasaurus fossil
in the chalk was a <EM>winged serpent of </EM>this kind. There
are characters in its vertebrae, which indicate union with the
Ophidia rather than with the Lacertilia.
<P>
And now to the main question. It is well known that Antiquity
has never claimed palaeontography and paleontology among its arts
and sciences; and it never had its Cuviers. Yet on Babylonian
tiles, and especially in old Chinese and Japanese drawings, in
the oldest Pagodas

<P>
and monuments, and in the Imperial library at Pekin, many a traveller
has seen and recognised perfect representations of Plesiosauri
and Pterodactyls in the multiform Chinese dragons.* Moreover,
the prophets speak in the Bible of the flying fiery serpents,**
and Job mentions the Leviathan.*** Now the following questions
are put very directly: --
<P>
I. How could the ancient nations know anything of the extinct
monsters of the carboniferous and Mesozoic times, and even represent
and describe them orally and pictorially, unless they had either
<EM>seen those monsters themselves or possessed descriptions of
them in their traditions, </EM>which descriptions necessitate
<EM>living and intelligent eye-witnesses?</EM> 
<P>
II. And if such eye-witnesses are once admitted (unless retrospective
clairvoyance is granted), how can humanity and the first palaeolithic
men be no earlier than about the middle of the tertiary period?
We must bear in mind that most of the men of science will not
allow man to have appeared before the Quaternary period, and thus
shut him out completely from the Cenozoic times. Here we have
extinct species of animals, which disappeared from the face of
the Earth millions of years ago, described by, and known to, nations
whose civilization, it is said, could hardly have begun a few
thousand years ago. How is this? Evidently either the Mesozoic
time has to be made to overlap the Quaternary period, or man must
be made the contemporary of the Pterodactyl and the Plesiosaurus.
<P>
It does not stand to reason, because the Occultists believe in
and defend ancient wisdom and science, even though winged saurians
are called &quot;flying camels&quot; in the translations of the
<EM>Zohar, </EM>that we believe as readily in all the stories
which the middle ages give us of such dragons. Pterodactyls and
Plesiosauri ceased to exist with the bulk
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* We read in the &quot;<EM>Memoire a l</EM>'<EM>Academie</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>of the &quot;naive astonishment of Geoffrey St. Hilaire,
when M. de Paravey showed to him in some old Chinese works and
Babylonian tiles dragons, . . . . saurians and ornithorhynchuses
(aquatic animals <EM>found only in Australia</EM>)<EM>, </EM>etc.,
extinct animals that he had thought unknown on earth. . . . till
his own day.&quot;
<P>
** See <EM>Isaiah, </EM>xxx. 6: &quot;The viper and the flying
serpent unto the land of trouble and anguish,&quot; and the fiery
serpents conquered by the brazen serpent of Moses.
<P>
*** The fossils reconstructed by science, which we know ought
to be sufficient warrant for the possibility of even a <EM>Leviathan,
</EM>let alone Isaiah's flying serpents, or <EM>saraph mehophep,
</EM>which words are translated in all the Hebrew dictionaries
as &quot;saraph,&quot; enflamed or fiery venom, and &quot;mehophep,&quot;
<EM>flying</EM>. But, although Christian theology has always connected
both (<EM>Leviathan and saraph mehophep</EM>)<EM> </EM>with the
devil, the expressions are metaphorical and have nought to do
with the &quot;evil one.&quot; But the word <EM>Dracon </EM>has
become a synonym for the latter. In Bretagne the word <EM>Drouk
</EM>now signifies &quot;devil,&quot; whence, as we are told by

<P>
of the Third Race. When, therefore, we are gravely asked by Roman
Catholic writers to credit Christopher Scherer's and Father Kircher's
cock-and-bull stories of their having seen with their own eyes
living fiery and flying dragons, respectively in 1619 and 1669,
we may be allowed to regard their assertions as either dreams
or fibs.* Nor shall we regard otherwise than as a <EM>poetical
license </EM>that other story told of Petrarch, who, while following
one day his Laura in the woods and passing near a cave, is credited
with having found a dragon, whom he forthwith stabbed with his
dagger and killed, thus preventing the monster from devouring
the lady of his heart.** We would willingly believe the story
had Petrarch lived in the days of Atlantis, when such antediluvian
monsters may still have existed. We deny their existence in our
present era. The sea-serpent is one thing, the dragon quite another.
The former is denied by the majority because it exists and lives
in the very depths of the ocean, is very scarce, and rises to
the surface only when compelled, perhaps, by hunger. Thus keeping
invisible, it may exist and still be denied. But if there was
such a thing as a dragon of the above description, how could it
have ever escaped detection? It is a creature contemporary with
the earliest Fifth Race, and exists no more.
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The ultramontane writers accept the whole series of draconian
stories given by Father Kircher (<EM>Edipus AEgyptiacus, </EM>&quot;<EM>De
Genere Draconum,</EM>&quot;)<EM> </EM>quite seriously. According
to that Jesuit, he himself saw a dragon which was killed in 1669
by a Roman peasant, as the director of the Museo Barberini sent
it to him, to take the beast's likeness, which Father Kircher
did and had it published in one of his <EM>in-folios. </EM>After
this he received a letter from Christopher Scherer, Prefect of
the Canton of Soleure, Switzerland, in which that official certifies
to his having seen himself <EM>with his own eyes, </EM>one fine
summer night in 1619, a living dragon. Having remained on his
balcony &quot;to contemplate the perfect purity of the firmament,&quot;
he writes, &quot;I saw a fiery, shining dragon rise from one of
the caves of Mount Pilatus and direct itself rapidly towards Fluelen
to the other end of the lake. Enormous in size, his tail was still
longer and his neck very extended. His head and jaws were those
of a serpent. In flying he emitted on his way numerous sparks
(? !) . . . . I thought at first I was seeing a meteor, but soon
looking more attentively, I was convinced by his flight and the
conformation of his body that I saw a <EM>veritable dragon. </EM>I
am happy to be thus able to enlighten your Reverence on the <EM>very
real </EM>existence of those animals&quot;; in <EM>dreams, </EM>the
writer ought to have added, of long past ages.
<P>
** As a convincing proof of the reality of the fact, a Roman Catholic
refers the reader to the picture of that incident painted by Simon
de Sienne, a friend of the poet, on the portal of the Church <EM>Notre
Dame du Don </EM>at Avignon; notwithstanding the prohibition of
the Sovereign Pontiff, who &quot;would not allow this triumph
of love to be enthroned in the holy place&quot;; and adds: &quot;Time
has injured and rubbed out the work of art, but has not weakened
its tradition.&quot; De Mirville's &quot;Dragon-Devils&quot; of
our era seem to have no luck, as they disappear most mysteriously
from the museums where they are said to have been. Thus the dragon
embalmed by Ulysses Aldobranda and presented to the Musee du Senat,
either in Naples or Bologna, &quot;was there still in 1700, but
is there no more.&quot; (<EM>Vol. 2, p. 427, &quot;Pneumatologie.</EM>&quot;)
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 208 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
The reader may inquire why we speak of dragons at all? We answer:
<EM>firstly, </EM>because the knowledge of such animals is a proof
of the enormous antiquity of the human race; and <EM>secondly,
</EM>to show the difference between the zoological real meaning
of the words &quot;dragon,&quot; &quot;<EM>Naga,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>and &quot;Serpent,&quot; and the metaphorical one, when used
symbolically. The profane reader, who knows nothing of the mystery
language, is likely, whenever he finds one of these words mentioned,
to accept it literally. Hence, the <EM>quid pro quos </EM>and
unjust accusations. A couple of instances will suffice.
<P>
<EM>Sed et serpens? </EM>aye: but what was the nature of the serpent?
Mystics intuitionally see in the serpent of <EM>Genesis </EM>an
animal emblem and a high spiritual essence: a cosmic force superintelligent,
a &quot;great fallen light,&quot; a spirit sidereal, aerial and
tellurian at the same time, &quot;whose influence circumambulates
the globe (<EM>qui circumambulat terram</EM>)<EM>, </EM>as a Christian
fanatic of the dead-letter (de Mirville) has it, and which only
manifested itself under the physical emblem, which was the most
convenient &quot;with respect to its moral and intellectual <EM>coils</EM>&quot;<EM>:
i.e. </EM>under the ophidian form.
<P>
But what will Christians make of the Brazen Serpent, the &quot;DIVINE
HEALER,&quot; if the serpent is to be regarded as the emblem of
cunning and evil? The &quot;Evil One&quot; itself? How can the
line of demarcation ever be settled, when it is traced arbitrarily
in a sectarian theological spirit. For, if the followers of the
Roman Church are taught that Mercury and AEsculapius, or Asclepios,
who are, in truth, one, are &quot;devils and sons of devils,&quot;
and the wand and serpent of the latter were &quot;the devil's
wand&quot;; how about the &quot;brazen serpent&quot; of Moses?
Every scholar knows that both the <EM>heathen </EM>wand and the
Jewish &quot;serpent&quot; are one and the same, namely, the <EM>Caduceus
of Mercury,</EM> son of <STRONG>A</STRONG>POLLO-PYTHON. It is
easy to comprehend why the Jews adopted the ophidian shape for
their &quot;seducer.&quot; With them it was purely <EM>physiological
and phallic</EM>;<EM> </EM>and no amount of casuistical reasoning
on the part of the Roman Catholic Church can give it another meaning,
once that the mystery language is well studied, and that the Hebrew
scrolls are read numerically. The Occultists know that the serpent,
the <EM>Naga, </EM>and the dragon have each a septenary meaning;
that the Sun, for instance, was the <EM>astronomical </EM>and
cosmic emblem of the two contrasted lights, and the two serpents
of the Gnostics, the good and the evil one; they also know that,
when <EM>generalised, </EM>the conclusions of both science and
theology present two most ridiculous extremes. For, when the former
tells us that it is sufficient to trace the legends of the serpents
to their primal source, the astrological legend, and to meditate
seriously on the <EM>Sun</EM>, conqueror of Python, and the celestial
virgin in the Zodiac forcing back the devouring dragon, if we
would have the key of all the subsequent religious dogmas; it
is easy to perceive that, instead of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 209 COBRAS AS SYMBOLS.</H6>

<P>
generalising, the author simply has his eye on Christian religion
and <EM>Revelation. </EM>We call this one extreme. The other we
see in this: when, repeating the famous decision of the Council
of Trent, theology seeks to convince the masses that &quot;from
the fall of man until the hour of his baptism the devil has full
power over him, and <EM>possesses him by right </EM>(<EM>diabolum
dominationem et potestatem super homines habere et jure cos possidere</EM>).&quot;<EM>
</EM>To this Occult philosophy answers: Prove first the existence
of the devil <EM>as an entity, </EM>and then we may believe in
such congenital possession. A very small amount of observation
and knowledge of human nature may be sufficient to prove the fallacy
of this theological dogma. Had <STRONG>S</STRONG>ATAN any reality,
in the objective or even subjective world (in the ecclesiastical
sense), it is the poor devil who would find himself chronically
obsessed and even possessed by the wicked -- hence by the bulk
of mankind. It is humanity itself, and especially the clergy,
headed by the haughty, unscrupulous and intolerant Roman Church,
which have begotten, given birth to, and reared in love the evil
one; but this is a digression.
<P>
&quot;The whole world of thought is reproached by the Church with
having adored the serpent. The whole of humanity 'incensed and
at the same time stoned it.' The Zend Avesta speaks of it as the
Kings and Vedas do, as the Edda and the Bible. . . . Everywhere
the sacred serpent, the naga, and its shrine and its priest; in
Rome it is the Vestal who prepares its meal with the same care
as she bestows on the sacred fire. In Greece, AEsculapius cannot
cure without its assistance, and delegates to it his powers. Everyone
has heard of the famous Roman embassy sent by the Senate to the
god of medicine and its return with the not less famous serpent,
which proceeded of its own will and by itself toward its Master's
temple on one of the islands of the Tiber. Not a Bacchante that
did not wind it (the serpent) in her hair, not an Augur but questioned
it oracularly, not a necromancer whose tomb is free from its presence!
The Cainites and the Ophites call it Creator, while recognizing,
as Schelling did, that the serpent is 'evil in substance and its
personification.' &quot;*
<P>
Yes, the author is right, and if one would have a complete idea
of the prestige which the serpent enjoys to our own day, one ought
to study the matter in India and learn all that is believed about,
and still attributed to, the <EM>Nagas </EM>(Cobras) in that country;
one should also visit the Africans of Whydah, the Voodoos of Port-au-Prince
and Jamaica, the Nagals of Mexico, and the Pa, or men-serpents
of China, &amp;c. But why wonder that the serpent is &quot;adored&quot;
and at the same time cursed, since we

know that from the beginning it was a symbol?* In every ancient
language the word <EM>dragon </EM>signified what it now does in
Chinese -- (<EM>lang</EM>) <EM>i.e., </EM>&quot;<EM>the being
who excels in intelligence</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>and in Greek [[<EM>drakon</EM>]],
or &quot;he who sees and watches.&quot; And is it to the animal
of that name that any of these epithets can apply? Is it not evident,
wherever superstition and oblivion of the primitive meaning may
have led savages now, that the said qualifications were intended
to apply to the human originals, who were symbolized by serpents
and dragons? These &quot;originals&quot; -- called to this day
in China &quot;the Dragons of Wisdom&quot; -- were the first disciples
of the Dhyanis, who were their instructors; in short, the primitive
adepts of the Third Race, and later, of the Fourth and Fifth Races.
The name became universal, and no sane man before the Christian
era would ever have confounded the man and the symbol.

The symbol of Chnouphis, or the soul of the world, writes Champollion,
&quot;is among others that of an enormous serpent standing on
human legs; this reptile, the emblem of the good genius, is a
<EM>veritable Agathodaemon. </EM>It is often represented bearded.
. . . . That sacred animal, identical with the serpent of the
Ophites, is found engraved on numerous Gnostic or Basilidean stones
. . . . The serpent has various heads, but is constantly inscribed
with the letters [[<EM>CHNOUBIS</EM>]].&quot;** Agathodaemon was
endowed &quot;with the knowledge of good and evil,&quot; <EM>i.e.</EM>,
with divine Wisdom, as without the former the latter is impossible.***

*** The solar Chnouphis, or <EM>Agathodaemon, </EM>is the Christos
of the Gnostics, as every scholar knows. He is intimately connected
with the seven sons of Sophia (Wisdom), the seven sons of Aditi
(universal Wisdom), her eighth being Marttanda, the Sun, which
seven are the seven planetary regents or genii. Therefore Chnouphis
was the <EM>spiritual Sun of Enlightenment,</EM> of Wisdom, hence
the patron of all the Egyptian Initiates, as Bel-Merodach (or
Bel-Belitanus) became later with the Chaldeans.

Hermes, and the names of Hermes, Nebo, Thot were given respectively
in various countries to great Initiates. Thus <EM>Nebo, </EM>the
son of Merodach and Zarpanitu (whom Herodotus calls Zeus-Belos),
gave his name to all the great prophets, seers and Initiates.

<P>
The &quot;<EM>invention of</EM> <EM>magic!</EM>&quot; A strange
term to use, as though the unveiling of the eternal and actual
mysteries of nature could be <EM>invented</EM>! As well attribute,
millenniums hence, the <EM>invention </EM>instead of the discovery
of radiant matter to Prof. Crookes. Hermes was not the inventor,
or even the discoverer, for, as said in the foot-note, Thot-Hermes
is a generic name, as is Enoch (Enoichion, the &quot;inner, spiritual
eye&quot;)<EM>, Nebo,</EM> the prophet and seer, etc. It is not
the proper name of any one living man, but a generic title of
many adepts. Their connection in symbolic allegories with the
serpent is due to their enlightenment by the solar and planetary
gods during the earliest intellectual Race, the Third. They are
all the representative patrons of the Secret Wisdom. Asclepios
is the son of the Sun-god Apollo -- and he is Mercury; Nebo is
the son of Bel-Merodach; Vaivasvata Manu, the great Rishi, is
the son of Vivisvat -- the Sun or Surya, etc., etc. And while,
astronomically, the Nagas along with the Rishis, the Gandharvas,
Apsarasas, Gramanis (or Yakshas, minor gods) Yatudhanas and Devas,
are the Sun's attendants throughout the twelve solar months; in
theogony, and also in anthropological evolution, they are gods
and men -- when incarnated in the <EM>nether</EM> world. Let the
reader be reminded, in this connection, of the fact that Apollonius
met in Kashmir Buddhist <EM>Nagas -</EM>- which are neither serpents
zoologically, nor yet the <EM>Nagas </EM>ethnologically, but &quot;wise
men.&quot;
<P>
The Bible, from <EM>Genesis </EM>to <EM>Revelations, </EM>is but
a series of historical records of the great struggle between white
and black Magic, between the Adepts of the right path, the Prophets,
and those of the left, the Levites, the clergy of the brutal masses.
Even the students of Occultism, though some of them have more
archaic <B>MSS</B>. and direct teaching to rely upon, find it
difficult to draw a line of demarcation between the <EM>Sodales
</EM>of the Right Path and those of the Left. The great schism
that arose between the sons of the Fourth Race, as soon as the
first Temples and Halls of Initiation had been erected under the
guidance of &quot;the Sons of God,&quot; is allegorized in the
Sons of Jacob. That there were two schools of Magic, and that
the orthodox Levites did not belong to the <EM>holy </EM>one,
is shown in the words pronounced by the dying Jacob. And here
it may be well to quote a few sentences from &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled.</EM>&quot;

</EM>Now in the original, the words &quot;their secret&quot; really
are &quot;their <STRONG>S</STRONG>OD.&quot;** And Sod was the
name for the great mysteries of Baal, Adonis and Bacchus, who
were all sun-gods and had serpents for symbols. The Kabalists
explain the allegory of the fiery serpents by saying that this
was the name given to the tribe of Levi, to all the <EM>Levites,
</EM>in short, and that Moses was the chief of the <EM>Sodales.</EM>***<EM>
</EM>It is to the mysteries that the original meaning of the &quot;Dragon-Slayers&quot;
has to be traced, and the question is fully treated of hereafter.
<P>
Meanwhile it follows that, if Moses was the chief of the Mysteries,
he was the Hierophant thereof, and further, if, at the same time,
we find the prophets thundering against the &quot;abominations&quot;
of the people of Israel, that there were two schools. &quot;Fiery
serpents&quot; was, then, simply the epithet given to the Levites
of the priestly caste, after they had departed from the <EM>good
law, </EM>the traditional teachings of Moses: and to all those
who followed <EM>Black Magic. </EM>Isaiah, when referring to the
&quot;rebellious children&quot; who will have to carry their riches
into the land whence come &quot;the viper and <EM>fiery </EM>flying<EM>
serpent</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>xxx. </EM>6), or Chaldea and
Egypt, whose Initiates had already greatly degenerated in his
day (700 <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>.), meant the sorcerers of those
lands.**** But these must be carefully distinguished from the
&quot;Fiery Dragons of Wisdom&quot; and the &quot;Sons of the
Fire Mist.&quot;
<P>
In the &quot;<EM>Great Book of the Mysteries</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>we
are told that: &quot;Seven Lords created Seven men; three Lords
(Dhyan Chohans or Pitris) were holy and good, four less heavenly
and full of passion. . . . The <EM>chhayas </EM>(phantoms) of
the Fathers were as they.&quot;
<P>
This accounts for the differences in human nature, which is divided
into seven gradations of good and evil. There were seven tabernacles
ready to be inhabited by Monads under seven different Karmic conditions.
The Commentaries explain on this basis the easy spread of evil,
as soon as the human Forms had become real men. Some ancient

<P>
philosophers ignored the seven in their genetical accounts and
gave only four. Thus the Mexican local <EM>Genesis </EM>has &quot;four
<EM>good </EM>men&quot; described as the four real ancestors of
the human race, &quot;who were neither begotten by the gods nor
born of woman&quot;; but whose creation was a wonder wrought by
the creative Powers, and who were made only after &quot;three
<EM>attempts at manufacturing men had failed.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>The
Egyptians had in their theology only &quot;four sons of God,&quot;
whereas in <EM>Pymander seven </EM>are given -- thus avoiding
any mention of the evil nature of man; though when Seth from a
god sank into Set-Typhon, he began to be called &quot;the seventh
son.&quot; Whence probably arose the belief that &quot;the seventh
son of the seventh son&quot; is always a natural-born magician,
though, at first, only a <EM>sorcerer </EM>was meant. <STRONG>A</STRONG>PAP,
the serpent symbolizing evil, is slain by Aker, Set's serpent;*
therefore Set-Typhon could not be that evil. In the &quot;<EM>Book
of the Dead</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>it is commanded (<EM>v</EM>. 13)
that chapter clxiii. should be read &quot;in the presence of a
serpent on two legs,&quot; which means a high Initiate, a Hierophant,
for the discus and ram's horns** that adorn his &quot;serpent's&quot;
head in the hieroglyphics of the title of the said chapter denote
this. Over the &quot;serpent&quot; are represented the two mystic
eyes of Ammon,*** the hidden &quot;mystery god.&quot; This passage
corroborates our assertion, and shows what the word &quot;serpent&quot;
meant in antiquity.
<P>
But as to the Nagals and Nargals, whence came the similarity of
names between the Indian Nagas and the American Nagals?
<P>
&quot;The Nargal was the Chaldean and Assyrian chief of the Magi
(Rab-Mag), and the Nagal was the chief sorcerer of the Mexican
Indians. Both derive their names from Nergal-Serezer, the Assyrian
god, and the Hindu Nagas. Both have the same faculties and the
power to have an attendant <EM>daemon</EM>, with whom they identify
themselves completely. The Chaldean and Assyrian Nargal kept his
<EM>daemon, </EM>in the shape of some animal considered sacred,
inside the temple; the Indian Nagal keeps his wherever he can
-- in the neighbouring lake, or wood, or in the house in the shape
of some household animal.&quot;****
<P>
Such similarity cannot be attributed to <EM>coincidence. </EM>A

Kauravya.**
<P>
And now it may be hoped the full meaning of the serpent emblem
is proven. It is neither that of evil, nor, least of all, that
of the devil; but is <EM>,</EM> indeed, the [[SEMES EILAM ABRASAX]]
(&quot;the eternal Sun-Abrasax&quot;), the central spiritual sun
of all the Kabalists, represented in some diagrams by the circle
of Tiphereth.
<P>
And here, again, we may quote from our earlier volumes and enter
into further explanations.
<P>
&quot;From this region of unfathomable depth (Bythos, Aditi, Shekinah,
the veil of the unknown) issues forth a circle formed of spirals.
This is Tiphereth; which, in the language of symbolism, means
a grand cycle, composed of smaller ones. Coiled within, so as
to follow the spirals, lies the serpent -- emblem of Wisdom and
Eternity -- the dual Androgyne; the cycle representing <EM>Ennoia</EM>,
or the divine mind (a power which does not create but which must
assimilate), and the serpent, the Agathodaemon, the Ophis, <EM>the
Shadow of the Light </EM>(non-eternal, yet the greatest divine
light on our plane). Both were the <EM>Logoi </EM>of the Ophites:
or the Unity as <EM>Logos </EM>manifesting itself as a double
principle of Good and Evil.&quot;
<P>
Were it light alone, inactive and absolute, the human mind could
not appreciate nor even realise it. Shadow is that which enables
light to manifest itself, and gives it objective reality. Therefore,
shadow is not evil, but is the necessary and indispensable corollary
which completes Light or Good: <EM>it is its creator on Earth.</EM>

<P>
According to the views of the Gnostics, these two principles are
immutable Light and Shadow, Good and Evil being virtually one
and having existed through all eternity, as they will ever continue
to exist so long as there are manifested worlds.
<P>
This symbol accounts for the adoration by this sect of the Serpent,
as the Saviour, coiled either around the sacramental loaf, or
a Tau, the phallic emblem. As a Unity, Ennoia and Ophis are the
<EM>Logos. </EM>When separated, one is the Tree of Life (spiritual),

Pundit Dayanand Saraswati, certainly the greatest Sanskrit and
Puranic authority in India on such questions, personally corroborated
that Ulupi was daughter of the king of the Nagas at Patala, or
America, 5000 years ago, and that the Nagas were Initiates.<HR>

of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Therefore, we find Ophis urging
the first human couple -- the material production of Ilda-Baoth,
but which owed its spiritual principle to Sophia-Achamoth -- to
eat of the forbidden fruit, although Ophis represents divine Wisdom.
<P>
The serpent, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree
of Life, are all symbols transplanted from the soil of India.
The Arasa-Maram, the banyan tree, so sacred with the Hindus (since
Vishnu during one of his incarnations, reposed under its mighty
shade and there taught human philosophy and sciences), is called
the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life. Under the protecting
foliage of this king of the forests, the Gurus teach their pupils
their first lessons on immortality and initiate them into the
mysteries of life and death. The Java-Aleim of the Sacerdotal
College are said, in the Chaldean tradition, to have taught the
sons of men to become like one of them. To the present day Foh-tchou,*
who lives in his Foh-Maeyu, or temple of Buddha, on the top of
the &quot;Kouin-long-sang,&quot;** the great mountain, produces
his greatest religious miracles under a tree called in Chinese
Sung-Ming-Shu, or the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life,
for ignorance is death, and knowledge alone gives immortality.
This marvellous display takes place every three years, when an
immense concourse of Chinese Buddhists assembles in pilgrimage
at the holy place.
<P>
Now it may become comprehensible why the earliest Initiates and
Adepts, or the &quot;Wise Men,&quot; for whom it is claimed that
they were initiated into the mysteries of nature by the UNIVERSAL
MIND, represented by the highest angels, were named the &quot;Serpents
of Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Dragons;&quot; as also how the first
physiologically complete couples -- after being initiated into
the mystery of human creation through Ophis, <EM>the manifested
Logos </EM>and the androgyne, by eating of the fruit of knowledge
-- gradually began to be accused by the material spirit of posterity
of having <EM>committed Sin, </EM>of having disobeyed the &quot;Lord
God,&quot; and of having been tempted by the Serpent.
<P>
So little have the first Christians (who despoiled the Jews of
their Bible) understood the first four chapters of Genesis in
their esoteric meaning, that they never perceived that not only
was no sin intended in this disobedience, but that actually the
&quot;Serpent&quot; was &quot;the Lord God&quot; himself, who,
as the Ophis, the Logos, or the bearer of divine creative wisdom,
taught mankind to become creators in their turn.*** They

&quot;tree and the serpent,&quot; and thus <EM>became the salvation
of mankind. </EM>By this it would become the very first fundamental
symbol of Creative cause, applying to geometry, to numbers, to
astronomy, to measure and to animal reproduction. According to
the Kabala the <EM>curse on man came with the formation of woman.</EM>*<EM>
</EM>The circle was separated from its diameter line. &quot;From
the possession of the double principle in one, that is the Androgyne
condition, the separation of the dual principle was made, presenting
two opposites, whose destiny it was, for ever after, to seek reunion
into the original <EM>one</EM> condition. The curse was this,
viz.: that nature, impelling the search, evaded the desired result
by the production of a new being, distinct from that reunion or
oneness desired, by which the natural longing to recover a lost
state was and is for ever being cheated. It is by this tantalizing
process of a continued curse that Nature lives.&quot;** (<EM>Vide
</EM>&quot;<EM>Cross and Circle,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Part II.)
<P>
The allegory of Adam being driven away from the &quot;Tree of
Life&quot; means, esoterically, that the newly separated Race
abused and dragged the mystery of Life down into the region of
animalism and bestiality. For, as the <EM>Zohar </EM>shows, that
Matronethah (Shekinah, the wife of Metatron symbolically) &quot;is
the way to the great Tree of Life, the Mighty Tree,&quot; and
Shekinah is divine grace. As explained: This Tree reaches the
heavenly vale and is hidden between three mountains (the upper
triad of principles, in man). From these three mountains, the
Tree ascends above (the adept's knowledge aspires heavenward)
and then redescends below (into the adept's <EM>Ego </EM>on Earth).
This Tree is revealed in the day time and is hidden during the
night, <EM>i.e</EM>., revealed to an enlightened mind and hidden
to Ignorance, which is night. (See <EM>Zohar </EM>I., 172, <EM>a</EM>
and <EM>b</EM>.) &quot;The Tree of the Knowledge of the Good and
the Evil grows from the roots of the Tree of Life.&quot; (Comm.)
But then also: &quot;In the Kabala it is plainly to be found that

all directions and in all senses.&quot;*
<P>
This is the Kabalistic view of the Western Occultists, and it
differs from the more philosophical Eastern or Aryan views upon
this subject.** The separation of the sexes was in the programme
of nature and of natural evolution; and the creative faculty in
male and female was a gift of Divine wisdom. In the truth of such
traditions the whole of antiquity, from the patrician philosopher
to the humblest spiritually inclined plebeian, has believed. And
as we proceed, we may successfully show that the <EM>relative
</EM>truth of such legends, if not their absolute exactness --
vouched for by such giants of intellect as were Solon, Pythagoras,
Plato, and others -- begins to dawn upon more than one modern
scientist. He is perplexed; he stands startled and confused before
proofs that are being daily accumulated before him; he feels that
there is no way of solving the many historical problems that stare
him in the face, unless he begins by accepting ancient traditions.
Therefore, in saying that we believe absolutely in ancient records
and <EM>universal </EM>legends, we need hardly plead guilty before
the impartial observer, for other and far more learned writers,
among those who belong to the modern scientific school, evidently
believe in much that the Occultists do: <EM>e.g., </EM>in &quot;Dragons,&quot;
not only symbolically, but also in their actual existence at one
time.
<P>
&quot;It would have indeed been a bold step for anyone, some thirty
years ago, to have thought of treating the public to a collection
of stories ordinarily reputed fabulous, and of claiming for them
the consideration due to genuine realities, or to have advocated
tales, believed to be time-honoured fictions, as actual facts;
and those of the nursery as being, in many instances, legends,
more or less distorted, descriptive of real beings or events.

those creatures are not chimeras but objects of rational study.

Unicorn seems not incredible, and in fact, more probable than
that theory which assigns its origin to a lunar myth* . . . For
my part I doubt the general derivation of myths from 'the contemplation
of the visible workings of external nature.' It seems to me easier
to suppose that the palsy of time has enfeebled the utterance
of these oft-told tales until their original appearance is almost
unrecognisable, than that <EM>uncultured savages should possess
powers of imagination and poetical invention far beyond those
enjoyed by the most instructed nations of the present day</EM>;<EM>
</EM>less hard to believe that these wonderful stories of gods
and demigods, of giants and dwarfs, of dragons and monsters of
all descriptions are <EM>transformations than to believe </EM>them
to be inventions.&quot;**
<P>
It is shown by the same geologist that man, &quot;successively
traced to periods <EM>variously estimated from thirty thousand
to one million years . </EM>. . . . , co-existed with animals
which have long since become extinct (<EM>p</EM>. 20).&quot;<EM>
</EM>These animals, &quot;weird and terrible,&quot; were, to give
a few instances -- (1) &quot;Of the <EM>genus Cidastes, </EM>whose
huge bones and vertebrae show them to have attained a length of
nearly two hundred feet . . . . . . &quot; The remains of such
monsters, no less than ten in number, were seen by Professor Marsh
in the Mauvaises Terres of Colorado, strewn upon the plains. (2)
The <EM>Titanosaurus montanus, </EM>reaching fifty or sixty feet
in length; (3) the <EM>Dinosaurians </EM>(in the Jurassic beds
of the Rocky Mountains), of still more gigantic proportions; (4)
the <EM>Atlanto-Saurus immanis, </EM>a<EM> femur </EM>of which
alone is over six feet in length, and which would be thus over
one hundred feet in length! But even yet the line has not been
reached, and we hear of the discovery of remains of such titanic
proportions as to possess a thigh-bone over twelve feet in length
(<EM>p</EM>. 37). Then we read of the monstrous <EM>Sivatherium
</EM>in the Himalayas, the four-horned stag, as large as an elephant,
and exceeding the latter in height; of the gigantic <EM>Megatherium:
</EM>of colossal flying lizards, <EM>Pterodactyli, </EM>with

crocodile jaws on a duck's head, etc., etc. <EM>All these were
co-existent with man, most probably attacked man, as man attacked
them</EM>;<EM> </EM>and we are asked to believe that the said
man was no larger then than he is now! Is it possible to conceive
that, surrounded in Nature with such monstrous creatures, man,
unless himself a colossal giant, could have survived, while all
his foes have perished? Is it with his stone hatchet that he had
the best of a <EM>Sivatherium </EM>or a gigantic flying saurian?
Let us always bear in mind that at least one great man of science,
de Quatrefages, sees no good scientific reasons why man should
not have been &quot;contemporaneous with the earliest mammalia
and go back as <EM>far as the</EM> <EM>Secondary Period.</EM>&quot;*
<P>
&quot;It appears,&quot; writes the very conservative Professor
Jukes, &quot;that the flying dragons of romance had something
like a real existence in former ages of the world.&quot;** &quot;Does
the written history of man,&quot; the author goes on to ask, &quot;comprising
a few thousand years, embrace the whole course of his intelligent
existence? Or have we in the long mythical eras, extending over
hundreds of thousands of years, and recorded in the chronologies
of Chaldea and China, shadowy mementoes of prehistoric man, handed
down by tradition, and perhaps transported by a few survivors
to existing lands, from others which, like the fabled Atlantis
of Plato, may have been submerged, or the scene of some great
catastrophe which destroyed them with all their civilization;&quot;
(p. 17).
<P>
The few remaining giant animals, such as elephants, themselves
smaller than their ancestors the Mastodons, and Hippopotami, are
the only surviving relics, and tend to disappear more entirely
with every day. Even they have already had a few pioneers of their
future genus, and have decreased in size in the same proportion
as men did. For the remains of a pigmy elephant were found (<EM>E.
Falconeri</EM>)<EM> </EM>in the cave deposits of Malta; and the
same author asserts that they were associated with the remains
of pigmy Hippopotami, the former being &quot;only two feet six
inches high; or the still-existing <EM>Hippopotamus </EM>(<EM>Choeropsis</EM>)<EM>
Liberiensis, </EM>which M. Milne-Edwards figures as little more
than two feet in height.&quot;***
<P>
Sceptics may smile and denounce our work as full of nonsense or
fairy-tales. But by so doing they only justify the wisdom of the
Chinese philosopher Chuang, who said that &quot;the things that
men do know can in no way be compared, numerically speaking, to
the things that are unknown&quot;;**** and thus they laugh only
at their own ignorance.
