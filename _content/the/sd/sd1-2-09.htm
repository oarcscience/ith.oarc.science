THE MOON, DEUS LUNUS, PHOEBE.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HIS archaic symbol is the most poetical of all
symbols, as also the most philosophical. The ancient Greeks brought
it into prominence, and the modern poets have worn it threadbare.
The Queen of Night, riding in the majesty of her peerless light
in heaven, throwing all, even Hesperos, into darkness, and spreading
her silver mantle over the whole sidereal world, has ever been
a favourite theme with all the poets of Christendom, from Milton
and Shakespeare down to the latest versifier. But the refulgent
lamp of night, with her suite of stars unnumbered, spoke only
to the imagination of the profane. Until lately, Religion and
Science had nought to do with the beautiful mythos. Yet, the cold
chaste moon, she, in the words of Shelley --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . . &quot;Who makes all beautiful on which she smiles<BR>
That wandering shrine of soft, yet icy flame,<BR>
Which ever is transformed, yet still the same,<BR>
And warms, but not illumines.&quot; . . . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
stands in closer relations to Earth than any other sidereal orb.
The Sun is the giver of life to the whole planetary system; the
Moon is the giver of life to our globe; and the early races understood
and knew it, even in their infancy. She is the Queen and she is
the King, and was King Soma before she became transformed into
Phoebe and the chaste Diana. She is pre-eminently the deity of
the Christians, through the Mosaic and Kabalistic Jews, though
the civilized world may have remained ignorant of the fact for
long ages; in fact, ever since the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 387 A GLANCE AT THE LUNAR MYTH.</H6>

<P>
last initiated Father of the Church died, carrying with him into
his grave the secrets of the pagan temples. For the &quot;Fathers&quot;
-- such as Origen or Clemens Alexandrinus -- the Moon was Jehovah's
living symbol: the giver of Life and the giver of Death, the disposer
of being -- in<EM> our </EM>World. For, if Artemis was <EM>Luna
</EM>in Heaven, and, with the Greeks, Diana on Earth, who presided
over child-birth and <EM>life:</EM> with the Egyptians, she was
Hekat (Hecate) in Hell, the goddess of Death, who ruled over magic
and enchantments. More than this: as the personified moon, whose
phenomena are triadic, Diana-Hecate-Luna is <EM>the three in one.
</EM>For she is <EM>Diva triformis</EM>,<EM> tergemina</EM>,<EM>
triceps</EM> --<EM> </EM>three heads on one neck,* like Brahma-Vishnu-Siva.
Hence she is the prototype of our Trinity, which has not always
been entirely male. The number seven, so prominent in the Bible,
so sacred in its seventh (Sabbath) day, came to the Jews from
Antiquity, deriving its origin from the four-fold number 7 contained
in the 28 days of the lunar month, each septenary portion thereof
being typified by one quarter of the moon.
<P>
It is worth the trouble of presenting in this work a bird's-eye
view of the origin and development of the lunar myth and <EM>worship
</EM>in historical antiquity, on our side of the globe. Its earlier
origin is untraceable by <EM>exact </EM>science, rejecting as
it does tradition; while for Theology, which, under the guidance
of the crafty Popes, has put a brand on every fragment of literature
that does not bear the <EM>imprimatur </EM>of the Church of Rome,
its archaic history is a sealed book. Whether the Egyptian or
the Aryan Hindu religious philosophy is the more ancient -- and
the Secret Doctrine says it is the latter -- does not much matter
in this instance, as the lunar and solar &quot;worship&quot; are
the most ancient in the world. Both have survived, and prevail
to this day throughout the whole world, with some openly, with
others -- <EM>e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>in Christian symbolics -- secretly.
The cat, a lunar symbol, was sacred to Isis, herself the Moon
in one sense, as Osiris was the Sun. The cat is often seen on
the top of the<EM> Sistrum </EM>in the hand of the goddess. This
animal was held in great veneration in the city of Bubaste, which
went into deep mourning after the death of every sacred cat, because
Isis, as the Moon, was particularly worshipped in this city of
mysteries. The astronomical symbolism connected with it has already
been given in Section I. of &quot;Symbolism,&quot; and no one
has better described it than Mr. G. Massey, in his Lectures and
in &quot;The Natural Genesis.&quot; The eye of the cat, it is
said, seems to follow the lunar phases in its growth and decline,
and its orbs shine like two stars in the darkness of night. Hence
the mythological allegory which shows Diana hiding under the shape
of a cat in the Moon, when, in company with other deities, she
was seeking to

escape the pursuit of <EM>Typhon </EM>(<EM>Vide </EM>the<EM> Metamorphoses
of Ovid</EM>)<EM>. </EM>The moon in Egypt was both the &quot;Eye
of Horus&quot; and the &quot;Eye of Osiris,&quot; the Sun.
<P>
The same with the <EM>Cynocephalus. </EM>The dog-headed ape was
a glyph to symbolise the sun and moon, in turn, though the Cynocephalus
<EM>is more a Hermetic than a religious symbol. </EM>For it is
the hieroglyph of Mercury, the planet, as of the Mercury of the
Alchemical philosophers, &quot;as,&quot; say the Alchemists, &quot;Mercury
has to be ever <EM>near Isis</EM>,<EM> as her minister</EM>,<EM>
</EM>as without Mercury neither Isis nor Osiris can accomplish
anything in the GREAT WORK.&quot; Cynocephalus, whenever represented
with the Caduceus, the Crescent, or the Lotus, is a glyph of the
&quot;philosophical&quot; Mercury; but when seen with a reed,
or a roll of parchment, he stands for Hermes, the secretary and
adviser of Isis, as Hanuman filled the same office with Rama.
<P>
Though the regular Sun-Worshippers, the Parsis, are few, yet not
only is the bulk of the Hindu mythology and history based upon
and interblended with these two worships, but so is also the Christian
religion itself. From their origin down to our modern day it has
coloured the theologies of both the Roman Catholic and Protestant
Churches. The difference, indeed, between the Aryan Hindu and
the Aryan European faiths is very small, if only the fundamental
ideas of both are taken into consideration. Hindus are proud of
calling themselves <EM>Suryas </EM>and<EM> Chandravansas </EM>(of
the <EM>Solar </EM>and<EM> Lunar </EM>dynasties). The Christians
pretend to regard it as idolatry, and yet they adhere to a religion
entirely based upon the solar and lunar worships. It is useless
and vain for the Protestants to exclaim against the Roman Catholics
for their &quot;Mariolatry,&quot; based on the ancient cult of
lunar goddesses, when they themselves worship Jehovah, pre-eminently
a <EM>lunar </EM>god, and when both Churches have accepted in
their theologies the &quot;<EM>Sun</EM>&quot;-Christ and the lunar
trinity.
<P>
What is known of Chaldaean Moon-Worship, of the Babylonian god,
<EM>Sin</EM>,<EM> </EM>called by the Greeks &quot;Deus Lunus,&quot;
is very little, and that little is apt to mislead the profane
student who fails to grasp the esoteric significance of the symbols.
As popularly known to the ancient profane philosophers and writers
(for those who were initiated were pledged to silence) the Chaldaea
were the worshippers of the moon under <EM>her</EM> (and <EM>his</EM>)
various names, just as were the Jews, who came after them.
<P>
In the unpublished <B>MSS</B>. on the Art Speech, already mentioned,
giving a key to the formation of the ancient (symbolical) languages
a logical <EM>raison d</EM>'<EM>etre </EM>is brought forward for
this double worship. It is written by a wonderfully well-informed
and acute scholar and Mystic, who gives it in the comprehensive
form of a hypothesis. The latter, however, becomes forcibly a
proven fact in the history of religious<HR>

evolution in human thought, to anyone who has ever had a glimpse
into the secret of ancient Symbology. Thus, he says: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;One of the first occupations among men, connected with those
of actual necessity, would be the perception of time periods,*
marked on the vaulted arch of the heavens sprung and rising over
the level floor of the horizon, or the plain of still water. These
would come to be marked as those of day and night, of the phases
of the moon, of its stellar or synodic revolutions, and of the
period of the solar year with recurrence of the seasons, and with
the application to such periods of the natural measure of day
or night, or of the day divided into the light and the dark. It
would also be discovered that there was a longest and shortest
solar day, and two solar days of equal day and night, within the
period of the solar year; and the points in the year of these
could be marked with the greatest precision in the starry groups
of the heavens or the constellations, subject to that retrograde
movement thereof, which in time would require a correction by
intercalation, as was the case in the description of the Flood,
where correction of 150 days was made for a period of 600 years,
during which confusion of landmarks had increased. . . . This
would naturally come to pass . . . . with all races in all time;
and such knowledge must be taken to have been inherent in the
human race, prior to what we call the historic period. . . . .&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On this basis, the author seeks for some natural physical function
possessed in common by the human race, and connected with the
periodical manifestations, such that &quot;the connection between
the two kinds of phenomena . . . became fixed in popular usage.&quot;
He finds it &quot;(<I>a</I>) in the feminine physiological phenomena
every lunar month of 28 days, or&quot; 4 weeks of 7 days each,
so that 13 occurrences of the period should happen in 364 days,
which is the solar week year of 52 weeks of 7 days each. (<I>b</I>)
The quickening of the foetus is marked by a period of 126 days,
or 18 weeks of 7 days each. (<I>c</I>) That period which is called
&quot;the period of viability&quot; is one of 210 days, or 30
weeks of 7 days each. (<I>d</I>) The period of parturition is
accomplished in 280 days, or a period of 40 weeks of 7 days each,
or 10 lunar months of 28 days each, or of 9 calendar months of
31 days each, counting on the royal arch of heavens for the measure
of the period of traverse from the darkness of the womb to the
light and glory of conscious existence, that continuing inscrutable
mystery and miracle . . . Thus the observed periods of time marking
the workings of the birth function would naturally become a basis
of astronomical calculation . . . We may almost affirm . . . that
this was the mode of reckoning among all nations, either independently,
or intermediately and indirectly by tuition. It was the mode with
the Hebrews, for even to-day they calculate the calendar by means
of the 354 and 355 of the lunar year, and we possess a special
evidence that it was the mode with the ancient Egyptians, as to
which this is the proof: --

<P>
* Ancient Mythology includes ancient Astronomy as well as Astrology.
The planets were the hands pointing out, on the dial of our solar
system, the hours of certain periodical events. Thus, Mercury
was <EM>the messenger </EM>appointed to keep time during the daily
solar and lunar phenomena, and was otherwise connected with the
God and Goddess of Light.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 390 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The basic idea underlying the religious philosophy of the
Hebrews was that God contained all things within himself*; and
that man was his image, man including woman . . . The place of
the man and woman with the Hebrews was among the Egyptians occupied
by the bull and the cow, sacred to Osiris and Isis,** who were
represented, respectively, by a man having a bull's head, and
a woman having the head of a cow, which symbols were worshipped.
Notoriously Osiris was the Sun and the river Nile, the tropical
year of 365 days, which number is the value of the word <I>Neilos</I>,<I>
</I>and the bull, as he was also the principle of fire and of
life-giving force, while Isis was the Moon, the bed of the river
Nile, or the Mother Earth, for the parturient energies of which
water was a necessity, the lunar year of 354-364 days, the time-maker
of the periods of gestation, and the cow marked by, or with, the
crescent new moon.&quot; . . . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;But the use of the cow of the Egyptians for the women of
the Hebrews was not intended as of any radical difference of signification,
but a concurrence in the teaching intended, and merely as a substitution
of a symbol of common import, which was this, viz., the period
of parturition with the cow and the woman was held to be the same,
or 280 days, or ten lunar months of four weeks each. And in this
period consisted the essential value of this animal symbol, whose
mark was that of the crescent moon.*** . . . These parturient
and natural periods are found to have been subjects of symbolism
all over the world. They were thus used by the Hindus, and are
found to be most plainly set forth by the ancient Americans, in
the Richardson and Gest tablets, in the Palenque Cross; and manifestly
lay at the base of the formation of the calendar forms of the
Mayas of Yucatan, the Hindus, the Assyrians, and the ancient Babylonians,
as well as the Egyptians and old Hebrews. The natural symbols
. . . would be either the phallus or the phallus and yoni, . .
. or <I>male</I> and<I> female. </I>Indeed, the words translated
by the generalizing terms male and female, in the 27th verse of
the 1st chapter of Genesis are . . <I>. sacr </I>and<I> n</I>'<I>cabrah</I>,<I>
</I>or literally, phallus and yoni,**** while the representation
of the phallic emblems would barely indicate the genital members
of the human body, when their functions and the development of
the seed-vesicles emanating from them was considered; then would
come into indication a mode of measures of lunar time, and, through
lunar, of solar time.&quot; . . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is the physiological or anthropological key to the Moon symbol.
The key that opens the mystery of theogony, or the evolution of
the Manvantaric gods, is more complicated, and has nothing phallic
in it. All is mystical and divine there. But the Jews, beyond
connecting Jehovah directly with the Moon as a generative god,
preferred to ignore the higher hierarchies, and have made of some
of them (zodiacal constellations and planetary gods) their Patriarchs,
thus euhemerizing the

purely theosophical idea and dragging it down to the level of
sinful humanity. (<EM>See section </EM>&quot;<EM>Holy of Holies</EM>&quot;<EM>
in the </EM>&quot;<EM>Symbolism</EM>&quot;<EM> of Book II.</EM>)<EM>
</EM>The <B>MSS</B>. from which the above is extracted explains
very clearly to what hierarchy of gods Jehovah belonged, and who
this Jewish <STRONG>G</STRONG>OD was; for it shows in clear language
that which the writer has always insisted upon -- namely, that
the God with which the Christians have burdened themselves was
no better than the lunar symbol of the reproductive or generative
faculty in nature. They have ever ignored even the Hebrew secret
god of the Kabalists, Ain-Soph, as grand as Parabrahmam in the
earliest Kabalistic and mystical conceptions. But it is not the
Kabala of Rosenroth that can ever give the true original teachings
of Simeon-Ben-Iochai, as metaphysical and philosophical as any.
And how many are there among the students of the Kabala who knew
anything of them except in their distorted Latin translations.
Let us glance at the idea which led the ancient Jews to adopt
a substitute for the ever <STRONG>U</STRONG>NKNOWABLE, and which
has misled the Christians into mistaking the substitute for the
reality.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;If to these organs (phallus and yoni) as symbols of creative
cosmic agencies the idea of . . . . time periods can be attached,
then, indeed, in the construction of Temples as Dwellings of Deity,
or of Jehovah, that post designated as the Holy of Holies, or
the most High Place, should borrow its title from the recognized
sacredness of the generative organs, considered as symbols of
measures as well as of creative Cause.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;With the ancient wise, there was no name, and no idea, and
no symbol, of a First Cause.* With the Hebrews, the indirect conception
of such was couched in a term of negation of comprehension --
viz<I>.</I>,<I> Ain-Soph</I>,<I> </I>or the Without Bounds. But
the symbol of <I>its first comprehensible manifestation</I>,<I>
</I>was the conception of a circle with its diameter line. . .
. . (See the Proem of Book I., Part I.) to carry at once a geometric,
phallic, and astronomic idea . . . . for the one takes its birth
from the nought or the Circle, without which it could not be,
and from one, or primal one, spring the nine digits, and, geometrically,
all plane shapes. So in the Kabala this Circle, with its diameter
line, is the picture of the ten Sephiroth or Emanations, composing
the Adam Kadmon, the Archetypal Man, the creative origin of all
things. . . . . This idea of connecting the circle and its diameter
line, that is, number ten, with the signification of the reproductive
organs, and the Most Holy Place, was carried out constructively
in the King's Chamber, or Holy of Holies, of the great Pyramid,
in the Tabernacle of Moses, and in the Holy of Holies of the Temple
of Solomon. . . . . It is <I>the picture of a double-womb</I>,<I>
</I>for in Hebrew the letter he <IMG SRC="sd1-78d.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
is at the same time the number 5 and symbol of the womb, and twice
5 is 10, or the phallic number.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This &quot;double womb&quot; also shows the duality of the idea
carried from
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Because it was too sacred. It is referred to as <STRONG>T</STRONG>HAT
in the Vedas: it is the &quot;Eternal Cause,&quot; and cannot,
therefore, be spoken of as a &quot;First Cause,&quot; a term implying
the absence of any cause, at one time.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 392 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
the highest, spiritual, down to the lowest or terrestrial plane;
and by the Jews limited to the latter. With them, therefore the
number 7 has acquired the most prominent place in their exoteric
religion, a cult of external forms and empty rituals; as their
Sabbath, for instance, the seventh day sacred to their deity,
the moon, symbolical of the generative Jehovah. While with other
nations the number seven was typical of theogonic evolution, of
cycles, cosmic planes, and the Seven Forces and Occult Powers
in Kosmos, as a boundless whole, whose first upper triangle was
unreachable to the finite intellect of man -- while other nations,
therefore, busied themselves, in their forcible limitation of
Kosmos in Space and Time, only with its septenary manifested plane,
the Jews centred this member solely in the moon, and based all
their sacred calculations thereupon. Hence we find the thoughtful
author of the <B>MSS</B>. just quoted, remarking, in reference
to the metrology of the Jews that: &quot;If 20,612 be multiplied
by 4/3 <EM>the product will afford a base for the ascertainment
of the mean revolution of the moon</EM>,<EM> </EM>and if this
product be again multiplied by 4/3, this continued product will
afford a base for finding the exact period of the mean solar year,
. . . this form . . . becoming, for the finding of astronomical
periods of time, of very great service.&quot; This double number
(male and female) is symbolized also in some well-known idols:
<EM>e.g</EM>., &quot;Ardanari-Iswara, the Isis of the Hindus,
Eridanus, or Ardan, or the Hebrew Jordan, <EM>or source of descent.
</EM>She is standing on a lotus-leaf flowing on the water. But
the signification is, that it is androgyne or hermaphrodite, that
is <EM>phallus </EM>and <EM>yoni</EM> combined, the number 10,
the Hebrew letter <EM>Jod</EM> <IMG SRC="sd1-78c.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">,<EM>
</EM>the <EM>containment of Jehovah. </EM>She, or rather she-he,
gives the minutes of the same circle of 360 degrees.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Jehovah,&quot; in its best aspect is Binah, &quot;the Upper
mediating Mother, the<EM> Great Sea </EM>or Holy Spirit;&quot;
therefore rather a synonym of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, than
of his Father; that &quot;Mother, being the Latin <EM>Mare</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>the Sea is here also, Venus, the <EM>Stella del Mare</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or &quot;Star of the Sea.&quot;
<P>
The ancestors of the mysterious Akkadians -- the <EM>Chandra</EM>
or <EM>Indovansas</EM>,<EM> </EM>the Lunar Kings whom tradition
shows reigning at Prayag (Allahabad) ages before our era -- had
come from India, and brought with them the worship of their forefathers,
of Soma, and his son Budha, which afterwards became that of the
Chaldeans. Yet such adoration, apart from popular Astrolatry and
Heliolatry, was in no sense <EM>idolatry. </EM>No more, at any
rate, than the modern Roman Catholic symbolism which connects
their Virgin Mary -- the <EM>Magna Mater </EM>of the Syrians and
Greeks -- with the Moon.
<P>
Of this worship, the most pious Roman Catholics feel quite proud,

<P>
Surely nothing could be more sincere than this! It justifies entirely
what Mr. Gerald Massey has said in his Lecture on &quot;Luniolatry,
Ancient and Modern&quot;: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The man in the moon (Osiris-Sut, Jehovah-Satan, Christ-Judas,
and other Lunar twins) is often charged with bad conduct. . .
. In the lunar phenomena the moon was one as <I>the </I>moon,
which was two-fold in sex, and three-fold in character -- as mother,
child, and adult male. Thus the child of the moon became the consort
of his own mother! It could not be <I>helped </I>if there was
to be any reproduction. He was compelled to be his own father!
These relationships were repudiated by later sociology, and the
primitive man in the moon got tabooed. Yet, in its latest, most
inexplicable phase, this has become the central doctrine of the
grossest superstition the world has seen, for these lunar phenomena
and their humanly represented relationships, the incestuous included,
are the very foundations of the Christian Trinity in Unity. Through
ignorance of the symbolism, the simple representation of early
time has become the most profound religious mystery in modern
Luniolatry. The Roman Church, without being in any wise ashamed
of the proof, portrays the Virgin Mary arrayed with the sun, and
the horned moon at her feet, holding the lunar infant in her arms
-- as child and consort of the mother moon. The mother, child,
and adult male, are fundamental.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;In this way it can be proved that our Christology is mummified
mythology, and legendary lore, which have been palmed off upon

A charming allegory is found in the <EM>Zohar</EM>,<EM> </EM>one
which unveils better than anything ever did the true character
of Jehovah or <B>YHVH</B> in the primitive conception of the Hebrew
Kabalists. It is now found in the philosophy of I'bn Gebirol's
Kabbalah, translated by Isaac Myer. &quot;In the introduction
written by R'Hez'quee-yah, which is very old,&quot; says our author,
&quot;and forms part of our Brody edition of the Zohar (I, 5<EM>b.
sq.</EM>)<EM> </EM>is<EM> </EM>an account of a journey taken by
R. El'azar, son of R. Shim-on b. Io'hai, and Rabbi Abbah.&quot;
They met a man with a heavy burden and asked his name; but he
refused to give it and proceeded to explain to them Thorah<HR>

(Law). &quot;They asked: 'Who caused thee thus to walk and carry
such a heavy load?' He answered: 'The letter <IMG SRC="sd1-78c.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">,
(Yod, which = 10, and is the symbolical letter of Kether and the
essence and germ of the Holy name <IMG SRC="sd1-355b.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
<STRONG>Y</STRONG><B>HVH</B>) . . . . They said to him: 'If thou
wilt tell us the name of thy father, we will kiss the dust of
thy feet.' He replied: 'As to my father, <EM>he had his dwelling
in the Great Sea</EM>,<EM> and was a fish therein</EM>'<EM> </EM>(like
Vishnu and Dagon or Oannes), 'which (first) destroyed the great
sea' . . . . . and he was great and mighty and 'Ancient of Days,'
until he swallowed all the other fishes in the (Great) Sea . .
. R. El'azar listened and said to him: 'Thou art the Son of the
Holy Flame, thou art the Son of Rab Ham -- '<EM>nun</EM>-ah Sabah
[the old: the <EM>fish </EM>in Aramaic or Chaldee is <EM>nun </EM>(<EM>noon</EM>)]<EM>
</EM>thou art the Son of the Light of the Thorah,&quot; (<EM>Dharma</EM>)<EM>
</EM>etc. Then the author explains that the feminine Sephiroth,
<EM>Binah</EM>,<EM> </EM>is<EM> </EM>termed by the Kabalist the
great sea: therefore Binah, whose divine names are Jehovah, <EM>Yah</EM>,
and Elohim, is simply the Chaldean Tiamat, the female power, the
Thalatth of Berosus, who presides over the Chaos, and was made
out later by Christian theology to be the serpent and the Devil.
She-He (Yah-hovah) is the supernal (Heh, and Eve). This Yah-hovah
then or Jehovah, is identical with our Chaos -- Father, Mother,
Son, -- on the material plane and in the purely physical World.

Lunar magnetism generates life, preserves and destroys it, psychically
as well as physically. And if, astronomically, she is one of the
seven planets of the ancient world, in theogony she is one of
the regents thereof; with Christians now as much as with Pagans,
the former referring to her under the name of one of their archangels,
and the latter under that of one of their gods.
<P>
Therefore the meaning of the &quot;fairy tale&quot; translated
by Chwolson from an old Chaldean <B>MSS.</B> translated into Arabic,
about Qu-tamy being instructed by the <EM>idol </EM>of the moon,
is easily understood (<EM>vide</EM> Book III.) Seldenus tells
us the secret as well as Maimonides (<EM>More Nevochim</EM>,<EM>
</EM>Book III., ch. xxx). The worshippers of the <EM>Teraphim
</EM>(the Jewish Oracles) &quot;carved images and claimed that
the light of the principal stars (planets) permeating these through
and through, the angelic <STRONG>V</STRONG>IRTUES (or the regents
of the stars and planets) conversed with them, teaching them many
most useful things and arts.&quot; And Seldenus explains that
the <EM>Teraphim </EM>were built and composed after the position
of certain planets, those which the Greeks called [[<EM>stoicheia</EM>]],
and according to figures that were located in the sky and called
[[<EM>alexeteroi</EM>]], or the <EM>tutelary </EM>gods<EM>. </EM>Those
who traced out the [[<EM>stoicheia</EM>]] were called [[<EM>stoicheiomatichoi</EM>]],
or the diviners by the [[<EM>stoicheia</EM>]]<EM>.</EM> (<EM>De

have frightened the men of science and made them proclaim the
work &quot;either an <EM>apocrypha </EM>or a fairy tale, unworthy
of the notice of an Academician.&quot; At the same time, as shown,
zealous Roman Catholics and Protestants tore it metaphorically
to pieces; the former because &quot;it described the worship of
demons,&quot; the latter because it is &quot;ungodly.&quot; They
are all wrong, once more. It is <EM>not </EM>a fairy tale; and
as far as regards pious Churchmen, the same worship may be shown
in the Scriptures, however disfigured by translation. Solar and
Lunar worship, as well as that of the Stars and Elements, are
traced, and figure in the Christian theology; defended by Papists,
they are stoutly denied by the Protestants only at their own risk
and peril. Two instances may be given.
<P>
Ammianus Marcellinus teaches that ancient divinations were always
accomplished with the help of the Spirits of the Elements, &quot;<EM>Spiritus
elementorum</EM>,<EM> </EM>and in Greek [[<EM>pneumata ton stoicheion</EM>]]&quot;<EM>
</EM>(1. I., 21).

But it is found now that the planets, the Elements, and the Zodiac,
were figured not only in Heliopolis by the twelve stones called
&quot;mysteries of the elements,&quot; <EM>elementorum arcana</EM>,<EM>
</EM>but also in Solomon's temple, and, as pointed out by various
writers, in several old Italian churches and even at <EM>Notre
Dame de Paris </EM>where they can be seen to this day.

No symbol -- the sun included -- was more complex in its manifold
meanings than the lunar symbol. The sex was, of course, dual.
With some it was male, <EM>e.g</EM>., the Hindu &quot;King Soma,&quot;
and the Chaldean <EM>Sin; </EM>with other nations it was female,
the beauteous goddesses Diana-Luna, I'lythia, Lucina. In Tauris,
human victims were sacrificed to Artemis, a form of the lunar
goddess; the Cretans called her Dictynna, and the Medes and Persians
Anaitis, as shown by an inscription of Koloe: '[[<EM>Artemidi
</EM>'<EM>Anaeiti</EM>]]. But, we are now concerned chiefly with
the most chaste and pure of the virgin goddesses, Luna-Artemis,
to whom Pamphos was the first to give the surname of [[<EM>Kalliste</EM>]],
and of whom Hippolitus wrote: [[<EM>Kallista polu parthenon</EM>]].
(See Pausanias viii., 35, 8.) This Artemis-Lochia, the goddess
that presided at conception and child-birth (Iliad, Pausanias,
etc., etc.), is, in her functions and as the triple Hecate, the
Orphic deity, the predecessor of the God of the Rabbins and pre-Christian
Kabalists, and his lunar type. The goddess [[<EM>Trimorphos</EM>]]<EM>
</EM>was the personified symbol of the various and successive
aspects represented by the moon in each of her three phases; and
this interpretation was already that of the Stoics (Cornut. <EM>De
Nat</EM>,<EM> </EM>D. 34, 1), while the Orpheans explained the
epithet ([[<EM>Trimorphos</EM>]]) by the three kingdoms of nature
over which she reigned. jealous, blood-thirsty, revengeful and
exacting, Hecate-Luna is a worthy counterpart of the &quot;Jealous
God&quot; of the Hebrew prophets. <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 396 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
The whole riddle of the solar and lunar worship, as now traced
in the churches, hangs indeed on this world-old mystery of lunar
phenomena. The correlative forces in the &quot;Queen of Night,&quot;
that lie latent for modern science, but are fully active to the
knowledge of Eastern adepts, explain well the thousand and one
images under which the moon was represented by the ancients. It
also shows how much more profoundly learned in the Selenic mysteries
were the ancients than are now our modern astronomers. The whole
Pantheon of the lunar gods and goddesses, Nephtys or Neith, Proserpina,
Melytta, Cybele, Isis, Astarte, Venus, and Hecate, on the one
hand, and Apollo, Dionysius, Adonis, Bacchus, Osiris, Atys, Thammuz,
etc., etc., on the other, all show on the face of their names
and titles -- those of &quot;Sons&quot; and &quot;Husbands&quot;
of their mothers -- their identity with the Christian Trinity.
In every religious system the gods were made to merge their functions
as Father, Son, and Husband, into one, and the goddesses were
identified as &quot;Wife, Mother, and Sister&quot; of the male
God; the former synthesizing the human attributes as the &quot;Sun,
the giver of Life,&quot; the latter merging all the other titles
in the grand synthesis known as Maia, Maya, Maria, etc., a generic
name. Maia, in its forced derivation, has come to mean with the
Greeks, &quot;mother,&quot; from the root <EM>ma</EM> (nurse),
and even gave its name to the month of May, which was sacred to
all those goddesses before it became consecrated to Mary.* Its
primitive meaning, however, was<EM> Maya</EM>,<EM> Durga</EM>,<EM>
</EM>translated by the Orientalists as &quot;inaccessible,&quot;
but meaning in truth the &quot;<EM>unreachable</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>in the sense of illusion and unreality; as being the source
and cause of spells, the personification of <STRONG>I</STRONG>LLUSION.
<P>
In religious rites the moon served a dual purpose. Personified
as a female goddess for exoteric purposes, or as a male god in
allegory and symbol, in occult philosophy our satellite was regarded
as a sexless Potency to be well studied, because it was to be
dreaded. With the initiated Aryans, Khaldii, Greeks and Romans,
Soma, Sin, Artemis <EM>Soteira </EM>(the hermaphrodite Apollo,
whose attribute is the lyre, and the bearded Diana of the bow
and arrow), <EM>Deus Lunus</EM>,<EM> </EM>and especially Osiris-lunus
and Thot-lunus,** were the occult potencies of the moon. But whether
male or female, whether Thot or Minerva, Soma or Astoreth, the
Moon is the Occult mystery of mysteries, and more a symbol of
evil than of good. Her seven phases (original, esoteric division)
are divided into three astronomical phenomena and four
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The Roman Catholics are indebted for the idea of consecrating
the month of May to the Virgin, to the pagan Plutarch, who shows
that &quot;May is sacred to <EM>Maia </EM>([[<EM>Maia</EM>]])
or Vesta&quot; (<EM>Aulus-Gellius</EM>,<EM> </EM>word Maia) --
our mother-earth, our nurse and nourisher personified.
<P>
** Thot-Lunus is &quot;Budha-Soma&quot; of India, or &quot;Mercury
and the Moon.&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 397 THE MOON, BISEXUAL.</H6>

<P>
purely psychic phases. That the moon was not always reverenced
is shown in the Mysteries, in which the death of the moon-god
(the three phases of gradual waning and final disappearance) was
allegorized by the moon standing for the <EM>genius of evil </EM>that
triumphs for the time over the light and life-giving god (the
sun), and all the skill and learning of the ancient Hierophants
in Magic was required to turn this triumph into a defeat.
<P>
It was the most ancient worship of all, that of the <EM>third
</EM>Race of our Round, the Hermaphrodites, to whom the <EM>male</EM>-moon
became sacred, when after the &quot;Fall&quot; so-called, the
sexes had become separated. &quot;Deus Lunus&quot; then became
an androgyne, male and female in turn; to serve finally, for <EM>purposes
of sorcery</EM>,<EM> </EM>as a dual power, to the <EM>Fourth </EM>Root-race,
the Atlanteans. With the <EM>Fifth </EM>(our own) the lunar-solar
worship divided the nations into two distinct, antagonistic camps.
It led to events described aeons later in the Mahabharatan War,
which to the Europeans is the <EM>fabulous</EM>,<EM> </EM>to the
Hindus and Occultists the historical, strife between the <EM>Suryavansas
</EM>and the <EM>Indovansas. </EM>Originating in the dual aspect
of the moon, the worship of the female and the male principles
respectively, it ended in distinct solar and lunar cults. Among
the Semitic races, the sun was for a very long time <EM>feminine
</EM>and the moon masculine -- the latter notion being adopted
by them from the Atlantean traditions. The moon was called &quot;the
Lord of the sun,&quot; <EM>Bel-Skemesh</EM>,<EM>* </EM>before
the Shemesh worship. The ignorance of the incipient reasons for
such a distinction, and of occult principles, led the nations
into anthropomorphic idol-worship. But the religion of every ancient
nation had been primarily based upon the Occult manifestations
of a purely abstract Force or Principle now called &quot;God.&quot;
The very establishment of such worship shows, in its details and
rites, that the philosophers who evolved those systems of nature,
subjective and objective, possessed profound knowledge, and were
acquainted with many facts
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* During that period which is absent from the Mosaic books --
from the exile of Eden to the allegorical Flood -- the Jews worshipped
with the rest of the Semites <EM>Dayanisi</EM> <IMG SRC="sd1-397.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
&quot;the Ruler of Men,&quot; the &quot;Judge,&quot; or the <STRONG>S</STRONG>UN.
Though the Jewish canon and Christianism have made the sun become
the &quot;Lord God&quot; and Jehovah in the Bible, yet the latter
is full of indiscreet traces of the androgyne Deity, which was
Jehovah the <EM>sun</EM>, and Astoreth the moon in its female
aspect, and quite free from the present metaphorical element given
to it. God is a &quot;consuming fire,&quot; appears <EM>in</EM>,
and is encompassed <EM>by</EM> fire.&quot; It was not only in
vision that Ezekiel (viii., 16) saw the Jews &quot;worshipping
the sun.&quot; The <EM>Baal </EM>of the Israelites (the Shemesh
of the Moabites and the Moloch of the Ammonites) was the identical
&quot;Sun-Jehovah,&quot; and he is till now &quot;the King of
the Host of Heaven,&quot; the Sun, as much as Astoreth was the
&quot;Queen of Heaven&quot; -- or the moon. The &quot;Sun of Righteousness&quot;
has become a <EM>metaphorical </EM>expression <EM>only now.</EM>
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 398 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
of a scientific nature. For besides being purely Occult, the rites
of lunar worship were based, as just shown, upon a knowledge of
physiology (quite a modern science with us), psychology, sacred
mathematics, geometry and metrology, in their right applications
to symbols and figures, which are but glyphs, recording observed
natural and scientific <EM>facts; </EM>in short, upon a most minute
and profound knowledge of nature. Lunar magnetism generates life,
preserves and kills it. <EM>Soma </EM>embodies the triple power
of the <EM>Trimurti</EM>,<EM> </EM>though it passes unrecognized
by the profane to this day. The allegory that makes Soma, the
moon, produced by the churning of the <EM>Ocean of Life </EM>(<EM>Space</EM>)<EM>
</EM>by the gods in another Manvantara (<EM>i.e.</EM>, in the
<EM>pre</EM>genetic day of our planetary system), and that other
allegory, which shows &quot;the Rishis milking the earth, whose
calf was Soma, the moon,&quot; has a deep cosmographical meaning;
for it is neither <EM>our</EM> earth which is milked, nor was
the moon, which we know, the calf.* Had our wise men of science
known as much of the mysteries of nature as the ancient Aryans
did, they would surely never have imagined that the moon was projected
from the Earth. Once more, the oldest of permutations in theogony,
the Son becoming his own father and the mother generated by the
Son, has to be remembered and taken into consideration if the
symbolical language of the ancients is to be understood by us.
Otherwise mythology will be ever haunting the Orientalists as
simply &quot;the disease which springs up at a peculiar stage
of human culture!&quot; -- as Renouf gravely observes in a Hibbert
lecture.
<P>
The ancients taught the, so to speak, <EM>auto</EM>-generation
of the Gods: the one divine essence, <EM>unmanifested</EM>,<EM>
</EM>perpetually begetting a second-self,<EM> manifested</EM>,<EM>
</EM>which second-self, androgynous in its nature, <EM>gives birth
in an immaculate way </EM>to everything macro- and micro-cosmical
in this universe. This was shown in the Circle and the Diameter,
or the Sacred 10, a few pages back.
<P>
But our Orientalists, their extreme desire to discover one homogeneous
<EM>element </EM>in nature notwithstanding, will <EM>not </EM>see
it; cramped in their researches by such ignorance, they -- the
Aryanists and Egyptologists -- are constantly led astray from
truth in their speculations. Thus, de Rouge is unable to understand,
in the text which he translates, the meaning of Ammon-Ra saying
to King Amenophes (supposed to be Memnon), &quot;Thou art my Son,
I have begotten thee&quot;; and as he
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The earth flees for her life in the allegory, before Prithu,
who pursues her. She assumes the shape of a cow, and, trembling
with terror, runs away and hides even in the regions of Brahma.
Therefore, it is <EM>not</EM> our Earth. Again, in every Purana,
the calf changes name. In one it is Manu Swayambhuva, in another
Indra, in a third the Himavat (Himalayas) itself, while Meru was
the milker. This is a deeper allegory than one thinks.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 399 THE DIGNITY OF SAIS.</H6>

<P>
finds the same idea in many a text and under various forms, this
very Christian Orientalist is finally compelled to exclaim that
&quot;for this idea to have entered the mind of a hierogrammatist,
there must have been in their religion a more or less defined
doctrine, <EM>indicating as a possible fact that might come to
pass</EM>,<EM> a divine and immaculate incarnation under a human
form.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Precisely. But why throw the explanation
on an impossible prophecy, when the whole secret is explained
by the later religion copying the earlier?
<P>
That doctrine was universal, and it was not the mind of any one
hierogrammatist that evolved it; for the Indian <EM>avatars </EM>are
a proof to the contrary. After which, having come &quot;to realize
clearer&quot;* what &quot;the Divine Father and Son&quot; were
with the Egyptians, de Rouge still fails to account for, and perceive
what were the functions attributed to the <EM>feminine </EM>principle
in that primordial generation. He does not find it in the goddess
Neith, of Sais. Yet he quotes the sentence of the Commander to
Cambyses when introducing that king into the Saitic temple: &quot;I
made known to his Majesty the dignity of Sais, which is the abode
of Neith, the great (female) producer, <EM>genitrix </EM>of the
<EM>Sun</EM>,<EM> </EM>who is the <EM>first-born</EM>,<EM> and
who is not begotten</EM>,<EM> but only brought forth</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>and hence is the fruit of an <EM>immaculate mother.</EM>

<P>
How much more grandiose, philosophical and poetical is the real
distinction -- for whoever is able to understand and appreciate
it -- made between the <EM>immaculate virgin </EM>of the ancient
Pagans and the modern <EM>Papal</EM> conception. With the former,
the ever-youthful mother nature, the antitype of her prototypes,
the sun and moon, <EM>generates </EM>and<EM> brings forth </EM>her
&quot;mind-born&quot; son, the Universe. The Sun and Moon, as
male-female deities, fructify the earth, the microcosmical mother,
and the latter conceives and brings forth, in her turn. With the
Christians, &quot;the first-born&quot; (<EM>primogenitus</EM>)<EM>
</EM>is indeed generated, <EM>i.e.</EM>, begotten, &quot;<EM>genitum</EM>,<EM>
non factum</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>and positively <EM>conceived and
brought forth </EM>-- &quot;<EM>Virgo pariet</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>explains
the Latin Church. Thus, she drags down the noble spiritual ideal
of the Virgin Mary to the earth, and, making her &quot;of the
earth earthy,&quot; degrades that ideal to the lowest of the anthropomorphic
goddesses of the rabble.
<P>
Truly, Neith, Isis, Diana, etc., etc., were each of them &quot;a
demiurgical goddess, at once visible and invisible, having her
place in Heaven, and <EM>helping to the generation of species</EM>&quot;
--<EM> </EM>the moon, in short. Her occult aspects and powers
are numberless, and, in one of them, the moon becomes with
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* His<EM> clear</EM> realization of it is, that the Egyptians
<EM>prophesied </EM>Jehovah (!) and his incarnated Redeemer (the
good serpent), etc., etc.; even to identifying Typhon with the

as serious and sober <EM>science.</EM> <HR>

the Egyptians Hathor, another aspect of Isis,* and both of these
goddesses are shown suckling Horus. Behold in the Egyptian Hall
of the British Museum, Hathor worshipped by Pharaoh Thotmes, who
stands between her and the Lord of Heavens. The monolith was taken
from Karnac; and the same goddess has the following legend inscribed
on her throne: &quot;<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>D</STRONG>IVINE
<STRONG>M</STRONG>OTHER AND <STRONG>L</STRONG>ADY, OR <STRONG>Q</STRONG>UEEN
OF <STRONG>H</STRONG>EAVEN&quot;; also &quot;the <STRONG>M</STRONG>ORNING
<STRONG>S</STRONG>TAR,&quot; and the &quot;<STRONG>L</STRONG>IGHT
OF THE <STRONG>S</STRONG>EA&quot; (<EM>Stella matutina </EM>and<EM>
Lux maris</EM>)<EM>. </EM>All the lunar goddesses had a dual aspect
-- one <EM>divine</EM>,<EM> </EM>the other <EM>infernal. </EM>All
were the virgin mothers of an<EM> immaculately </EM>born Son --
the <STRONG>S</STRONG>UN. Raoul Rochetti shows the moon-goddess
of the Athenians -- Pallas, or Cybele, Minerva, or again Diana
-- holding her child-son on the lap, invoked in her festivals
as [[<EM>Monogenes Theou</EM>]], &quot;the one Mother of God,&quot;
sitting on a lion, and surrounded by twelve personages; in whom
the Occultist recognises the twelve great gods, and the pious
Christian Orientalist the apostles, or rather the Grecian pagan
prophecy thereof.
<P>
They are both right, for the immaculate <EM>goddess </EM>of the
Latin Church is a faithful copy of the older pagan goddesses;
the number (twelve) of the apostles is that of the twelve tribes,
and the latter are a personification of the twelve great gods,
and of the twelve signs of the Zodiac. Every detail almost in
the Christian dogma is borrowed from the heathens. Semele, the
<EM>wife </EM>of Jupiter and mother of Bacchus, the <EM>Sun</EM>,<EM>
</EM>is, according to Nonnus, also &quot;carried,&quot; or made
to ascend to heaven after her death, where she presides between
Mars and Venus, under the name of the <EM>Queen of the World</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or the universe, [[<EM>panbasileia</EM>]]; &quot;at the names
of which, as at the names of Hathor, Hecate, and other infernal
goddesses,&quot; &quot;tremble all the demons.&quot;**
<P>
&quot;[[Semelen premousi daimones]].&quot; This Greek inscription
on a small temple, reproduced on a stone that was found by somebody,
and copied by Montfaucon, as De Mirville tells us (113, <EM>Archaeologie
de la Vierge mere</EM>)<EM> </EM>informs us of the stupendous
fact, that the <EM>Magna Mater </EM>of the old world was an impudent
<EM>plagiarism</EM>,<EM> </EM>perpetrated by the <EM>Demon</EM>,<EM>
of the Immaculate Virgin Mother </EM>of his Church. Whether so,
or <EM>vice versa</EM>, is<EM> </EM>of no importance. That which
is interesting to note is the perfect identity between the ARCHAIC
COPY and the MODERN ORIGINAL.
<P>
Did space permit we might show the inconceivable coolness and
unconcern exhibited by certain followers of the Roman Catholic

<P>
Venus, and that the pagan rites, proclaimed and practised in honour
of those goddesses, were in a good measure transferred to the
mother of Christ,&quot; the advocate of Rome answers: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;That such <I>is </I>the fact, and that it is just as it
should be and quite natural. As the dogma, the liturgy, and the
rites professed by the Roman Apostolical Church in 1862 are found
engraved on monuments, inscribed on papyri, and cylinders <I>hardly
posterior to the Deluge</I>,<I> </I>it does seem impossible to
deny the existence of a FIRST ANTE-HISTORICAL (Roman) <STRONG>C</STRONG>ATHOLICISM
OF WHICH OUR OWN IS BUT THE FAITHFUL CONTINUATION. . . . But while
the former was the culmination, the <I>summum</I> of the impudence
of demons and Goetic necromancy . . . . the latter is <I>divine.
</I>If in <I>our </I>(Christian) Revelation (<I>l</I>'<I>Apocalypse</I>),<I>
</I>Mary, clothed with the Sun and having the moon under her feet,
has nothing more in common <I>with the humble servant of Nazareth
</I>(<I>sic.</I>),<I> </I>it is because she has now become the
greatest of theological and cosmological powers in<I> our</I>
universe.&quot; -- (Archaeol. de la Vierge, pp. 116 and 119, and
by the Marquis de Mirville).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Verily so, since Pindar's <EM>Hymns to Minerva </EM>(p. 19) .
. . &quot;who sits <EM>at the right hand </EM>of her Father Jupiter,
and who is more powerful than all the other (angels or) gods,&quot;
are likewise applied to the Virgin. It is St. Bernard, who, quoted
by Cornelius <EM>a Lapide</EM>,<EM> </EM>is made to address the
Virgin Mary in this wise: --
<P>
&quot;The <EM>Sun-Christ </EM>lives in thee and thou livest in
him.&quot; (Sermon on the Holy Virgin.) . . . .
<P>
Again the Virgin is admitted to be the MOON by the same unsophisticated
holy man. Being the <EM>Lucina </EM>of the Church, that is in
childbirth, the verse of Virgil -- &quot;<EM>Casta fove Lucina</EM>,<EM>
tuus jam regnat Apollo</EM>&quot; --<EM> </EM>is applied to her.
Like the moon, the Virgin is the Queen of Heaven,&quot; adds the
innocent saint; (Apocal., ch. xii., Comm. by <EM>Cornelius a Lapide</EM>)<EM>.</EM>

<P>
This settles the question. The more similarity, according to such
writers as De Mirville, there exists between the pagan conceptions
and the Christian dogmas, the more divine appears the Christian
religion, and the more is it seen to be the only truly inspired
one, especially in its Roman Catholic form. The unbelieving scientists
and the academicians who think they see in the Latin Church quite
the opposite of divine inspiration, and who will not believe in
the satanic tricks of plagiarism by anticipation, are severely
taken to task. But then &quot;they believe in nothing and reject
even the '<EM>Nabathean Agriculture</EM>'<EM> </EM>as a romance
and a pack of superstitious nonsense,&quot; complains the memorialist.
&quot;In their perverted opinion Qu-ta-my's 'idol of the moon'
and the statue of the Madonna are one!&quot; A noble Marquis wrote
twenty years ago six huge volumes, or, as he calls them &quot;<EM>Memoires
</EM>to the French Academy,&quot; with the sole object of showing
Roman Catholicism an inspired and revealed faith. As a proof thereof,
he furnishes numberless facts, all tending to show that the entire
ancient world, ever since<HR>

<P>
the deluge, had been, with the help of the devil, systematically
plagiarizing the rites, ceremonies, and dogmas of the future Holy
Church to be born ages later. What would that faithful son of
Rome have said had he heard his co-religionist -- M. Renouf, the
distinguished Egyptologist of the British Museum -- declaring,
in one of his learned lectures, that &quot;neither Hebrews nor
Greeks borrowed any of their ideas from Egypt?&quot;*
<P>
But perhaps it is just this that M. Renouf intended to say namely
-- that it is the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Aryans, who borrowed
theirs from the Latin Church? And if so, why, in the name of logic,
do the Papists reject the additional information which the Occultists
may give them on Moon-worship, since it all tends to show their
(the Roman Catholic) worship as old as the world -- OF <STRONG>S</STRONG>ABAEANISM
AND <STRONG>A</STRONG>STROLATRY?
<P>
The reason of early Christian and later Roman Catholic astrolatry,
or the symbolical worship of Sun and Moon -- identical with that
of the Gnostics, though less philosophical and pure than the &quot;Sun
worship&quot; of the Zoroastrians -- is a natural consequence
of its birth and origin. The adoption by the Latin Church of such
symbols as the water, fire, sun, moon and stars, and a good many
other things, is simply a continuation by the early Christians
of the old worship of Pagan nations. Thus Odin got his wisdom,
power, and knowledge, by sitting at the feet of Mimir, the thrice-wise
<EM>Jotun</EM>,<EM> </EM>who passed his life by the fountain of
primeval Wisdom, the crystalline waters of which increased his
knowledge daily. Mimir &quot;drew the highest knowledge from the
fountain, because the world was born of water; hence primeval
wisdom was to be found in that mysterious element&quot; (&quot;Asgard
and the Gods,&quot; 86). The eye which Odin had to pledge to acquire
that knowledge may be &quot;the Sun, which enlightens and penetrates
all things; his other eye being the moon, whose reflection gazes
out of the deep, and which at last, when setting, sinks into the
Ocean.&quot; (<EM>Ibid.</EM>) But it is something more, besides
this. Loki, the fire-god, is said to have hidden in the water,
as well as in the moon, the light-giver, whose reflection he found
therein; and this belief that the fire finds refuge in the water
was not limited to the old Scandinavians. It was shared by all
nations and was finally taken up by the early Christians, who
symbolized the Holy Ghost under the shape of Fire, &quot;cloven
tongues like as fire&quot; -- the breath of the Father-<STRONG>S</STRONG>UN.
This &quot;Fire&quot; descends also into the Water or the Sea:

sea-foam, and it became later the symbol of the Christian <EM>Anima

One of the most occult chapters in the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;
is ch. lxxx., entitled: &quot;To make the transformation into
the god giving light to the path of Darkness,&quot; wherein &quot;Woman-light
of the Shadow&quot; serves Thot in his retreat in the moon. Thot-Hermes
is said to hide therein, because he is the representative of the
Secret Wisdom. He is the manifested logos of its light side, the
concealed deity or &quot;Dark Wisdom&quot; when he is supposed
to retire to the opposite hemisphere. Speaking of her power, the
moon calls herself repeatedly: &quot;The Light which shineth in
Darkness,&quot; the &quot;Woman-Light.&quot; Hence it became the
accepted symbol of all the Virgin-Mother goddesses. As the wicked
&quot;evil&quot; spirits warred against the moon in days of yore,
so they are supposed to war now, without being able to prevail,
however, against the actual Queen of Heaven, Mary, the moon. Hence
also the moon was intimately connected in all the Pagan theogonies
with the Dragon, her eternal enemy; the Virgin, or Madonna, standing
on the mythical Satan under that form, crushed and made powerless,
under her feet. This, because the head and tail of the Dragon,
which represent in Eastern astronomy to this day the ascending
and descending nodes of the moon, were also symbolized in ancient
Greece by the two serpents. Hercules kills them on the day of
his birth, and so does the babe in his virgin mother's arms. As
Mr. Gerald Massey aptly observes in this connection: &quot;All
such symbols figured their own facts from the first, and did not
pre-figure others of a totally different order. The Iconography
(and dogmas, too) had survived in Rome from a period remotely
pre-Christian. <EM>There was neither forgery nor interpolation
of types; nothing but a continuity of imagery with a perversion
of its meaning.</EM>&quot;
