In primeval times, a maiden,<BR>
Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,<BR>
Passed for ages her existence<BR>
In the great expanse of Heaven,
<P>
. . . . . . . . . . .
<P>
Seven hundred years she wandered,<BR>
Seven hundred years she laboured,<BR>
Ere her first-born was delivered.
<P>
. . . . . . . . . . .
<P>
Ere a beauteous duck descending,<BR>
Hastens toward the water-mother.
<P>
. . . . . . . . . . .
<P>
Lightly on the knee she settles,<BR>
Finds a nesting-place befitting,<BR>
Where to lay her eggs in safety,<BR>
Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,<BR>
<EM>Six, </EM>the golden eggs she lays them,<BR>
Then a <EM>Seventh, </EM>an egg of iron . . . . .&quot;
