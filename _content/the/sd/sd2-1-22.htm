<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>O</STRONG>RIGIN OF THE <STRONG>S</STRONG>ATANIC
<STRONG>M</STRONG>YTH.
<P>
Let us then fathom this creation of the Patristic fancy still
deeper, and find its prototype with the Pagans. The origin of
the new <EM>Satanic</EM> myth is easy to trace. The tradition
of the Dragon and the Sun is echoed in every part of the world,
both in its civilized and semi-savage regions. It took rise in
the whisperings about secret initiations among the profane, and
was established universally through the once universal heliolatrous
religion. There was a time when the four parts of the world were
covered with the temples sacred to the Sun and the Dragon;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 379 THE SECRET OF THE DRAGON.</H6>

<P>
but the cult is now preserved mostly in China and the Buddhist
countries, &quot;Bel and the Dragon being uniformly coupled together,
and the priest of the Ophite religion as uniformly assuming the
name of his <EM>God</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(&quot;<EM>Archaeology,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>Vol. xxv., p. 220, London). In the religions of the past,
it is in Egypt we have to seek for its Western origin. The Ophites
adopted their rites from Hermes Trismegistus, and heliolatrous
worship crossed over with its Sun-gods into the land of the Pharaohs
from India. In the gods of Stonehenge we recognise the divinities
of Delphi and Babylon, and in those of the latter the devas of
the Vedic nations. Bel and the Dragon, Apollo and Python, Krishna
and Kaliya, Osiris and Typhon are all one under many names --
the latest of which are Michael and the Red Dragon, and St. George
and his Dragon. As Michael is &quot;one as God,&quot; or his &quot;Double,&quot;
for terrestrial purposes, and is one of the Elohim, the fighting
angel, he is thus simply a permutation of Jehovah. Whatever the
Cosmic or astronomical event that first gave rise to the allegory
of the &quot;War of Heaven,&quot; its earthly origin has to be
sought in the temples of Initiation and archaic crypts. The following
are the proofs: --
<P>
We find (<EM>a</EM>) the priests assuming the name of the gods
they served; (<EM>b</EM>) the &quot;Dragons&quot; held throughout
all antiquity as the symbols of Immortality and Wisdom, of secret
Knowledge and of Eternity; and (<EM>c</EM>) the hierophants of
Egypt, of Babylon, and India, styling themselves generally the
&quot;Sons of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Serpents&quot;; thus
the teachings of the Secret Doctrine are thereby corroborated.
<P>
There were numerous catacombs in Egypt and Chaldea, some of them
of a very vast extent. The most renowned of them were the subterranean
crypts of Thebes and Memphis. The former, beginning on the western
side of the Nile, extended towards the Lybian desert, and were
known as the <EM>Serpent</EM>'<EM>s </EM>catacombs, or passages.
It was there that were performed the sacred mysteries of the <EM>kuklos
anagkes, </EM>the &quot;Unavoidable Cycle,&quot; more generally
known as &quot;the circle of necessity&quot;; the inexorable doom
imposed upon every soul after the bodily death, and when it has
been judged in the Amenthian region.
<P>
In de Bourbourg's book, <EM>Votan, </EM>the Mexican demi-god,
in narrating his expedition, describes a subterranean passage
which ran underground, and terminated at the root of the heavens,
adding that this passage was a snake's hole, &quot;un agujero
de colubra&quot;; and that he was admitted to it because he was
himself &quot;a son of the snakes,&quot; or a serpent. (&quot;Die
Phoinizier,&quot; 70.)
<P>
This is, indeed, very suggestive; for his description of the <EM>snake</EM>'<EM>s</EM>
<EM>hole </EM>is that of the ancient Egyptian crypt, as above
mentioned. The hierophants, moreover, of Egypt, as of Babylon,
generally styled them-<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 380 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
selves the &quot;Sons of the Serpent-god,&quot; or &quot;Sons
of the Dragon,&quot; during the mysteries.
<P>
&quot;The Assyrian priest bore always the name of his god,&quot;
says Movers. The Druids of the Celto-Britannic regions also called
themselves snakes. &quot;I am a Serpent, I am a Druid,&quot; they
exclaimed. The Egyptian Karnak is twin brother to the Carnac of
Bretagne, the latter Carnac meaning the serpent's mount. The Dracontia
once covered the surface of the globe, and these temples were
sacred to the Dragon, only because it was the symbol of the sun,
which, in its turn, was the symbol of the highest god -- the Phoenician
Elon or Elion, whom Abraham recognised as El Elion.* Besides the
surname of serpents, they were called the &quot;builders,&quot;
the &quot;architects&quot;; for the immense grandeur of their
temples and monuments was such that even now the pulverised remains
of them &quot;frighten the mathematical calculations of our modern
engineers,&quot; says Taliesin.**
<P>
De Bourbourg hints that the chiefs of the name of <EM>Votan, the
Quetzo-Cohuatl, </EM>or Serpent deity of the Mexicans, are the
descendants of Ham and Canaan. &quot;I am Hivim,&quot; they say.
&quot;Being a Hivim, I am of the great race of the Dragon (snake).
I am a snake myself, for I am a Hivim.&quot; (&quot;Cartas,&quot;
51;<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Vol.
I., 553, <EM>et seq.</EM>)
<P>
Furthermore, the &quot;War in Heaven&quot; is shown, in one of
its significations, to have meant and referred to those terrible
struggles in store for the candidate for adeptship, between himself
and his (by magic) personified human passions, when the <EM>inner
</EM>enlightened man had to either slay them or fail. In the former
case he became the &quot;Dragon-Slayer,&quot; as having happily
overcome all the temptations; and a &quot;Son of the Serpent&quot;
and a Serpent himself, having cast off his old skin and being
born in a <EM>new</EM> body, becoming a Son of Wisdom and Immortality
in Eternity. (See Part <STRONG>II</STRONG>. on the Satanic Myth.)
<P>
Seth, the reputed forefather of Israel, is only a Jewish travesty
of Hermes, the God of Wisdom, called also Thoth, Tat, Seth, Set,
and Satan. He is also Typhon -- the same as Apophis, the Dragon
slain by Horus; for Typhon was also called Set. He is simply the
<EM>dark side </EM>of Osiris, his brother, as Angra Mainyu is
the black shadow of Ahura-mazda. Terrestrially, all these allegories
were connected with the trials of adeptship and initiation. Astronomically,
they referred to the Solar and Lunar eclipses, the mythical explanations
of which we find to this day in India and Ceylon, where any one
can study the allegorical narratives and traditions which have
remained unchanged for many thousands of years.

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 381 THE THEFT OF RAHU.</H6>

<P>
Rahu, mythologically is a <EM>Daitya -- </EM>a giant, a Demi-god,
the lower part of whose body ended in a Dragon or Serpent's tail.
During the churning of the Ocean, when the gods produced amrita
-- the water of Immortality -- he stole some of it, and drinking,
became immortal. The Sun and Moon, who had detected him in his
theft, denounced him to Vishnu, who placed him in the stellar
spheres, the upper portion of his body representing the Dragon's
head and the lower (Ketu) the Dragon's tail; the two being the
ascending and descending nodes. Since then, Rahu wreaks his vengeance
on the Sun and Moon by occasionally swallowing them. But this
fable had another mystic meaning, since <EM>Rahu, </EM>the Dragon's
head, played a prominent part in the mysteries of the <EM>Sun's
</EM>(<EM>Vikarttana</EM>'<EM>s</EM>)<EM> </EM>initiation, when
the candidate and the Dragon had a supreme fight.
<P>
The caves of the Rishis, the abodes of Tiresias and the Greek
seers, were modelled on those of the <EM>Nagas -- </EM>the Hindu
<EM>King-Snakes, who </EM>dwelled in cavities of the rocks under
the ground. From <EM>Sesha, the</EM> thousand-headed Serpent,
on which Vishnu rests, down to Python, the dragon <EM>serpent
oracle, </EM>all point to the secret meaning of the myth. In India
we find the fact mentioned in the earliest Puranas. The children
of Surasa are the &quot;mighty Dragons.&quot; The <EM>Vayu </EM>Purana
replacing &quot;Surasa&quot; (of <EM>Vishnu </EM>Purana) by Danayas
or <EM>Danavas -- </EM>the descendants of Danu by the sage Kasyapa
-- and those Danavas being the giants (or Titans) who warred against
the gods, they are thus shown identical with the &quot;Dragons&quot;
and &quot;Serpents&quot; of Wisdom.
<P>
By simply comparing the Sun-gods of every country, one may find
their allegories agreeing perfectly with one another; and the
more the allegorical symbol is occult the more its corresponding
symbol in other systems agrees with it. Thus, if from three systems
widely differing from each other in appearance -- the old Aryan,
the ancient Greek, and the modern Christian schemes -- we select
several Sun-gods and dragons at random, these will be found copied
from each other.
<P>
Let us take Agni the fire-god, Indra the firmament, and Karttikeya
from the Hindus; the Greek Apollo; and <EM>Mikael, </EM>the &quot;Angel
of the Sun,&quot; the first of the AEons, called by the Gnostics
&quot;the saviour&quot; -- and proceed in order.
<P>
(1) Agni -- the fire-god -- is called in the Rig-Veda Vaiswanara.
Now Vaisvanara is a Danava -- a giant-demon,* whose daughters
Puloma and Kalaka are the mothers of numberless Danavas (30 millions),
by
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* He is thus named and included in the list of the Danavas in
<EM>Vayu Purana</EM>; the Commentator of Bhagavata Purana calls
him a son of Danu, but the name means also &quot;Spirit of Humanity.&quot;
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 382 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Kasyapa,* and live in <EM>Hiranyapura, </EM>&quot;<EM>the golden
city,</EM>&quot;<EM> floating in the air</EM>. Therefore, Indra
is, in a fashion, the step-son of these two as a son of Kasyapa;
and Kasyapa is, in this sense, identical with Agni, the fire-god,
or Sun (Kasyapa-Aditya). To this same group belongs Skanda or
Karttikeya (god of War, the <EM>six-faced </EM>planet Mars astronomically),
a Kumara, or virgin-youth, born of Agni** for the purpose of destroying
Taraka, the Danava Demon, the grandson of Kasyapa by Hiranyaksha,
his son,*** whose (Taraka's) yogi austerities were so extraordinary
that they became formidable to the gods, who feared such a rival
in power.**** While Indra, the bright god of the Firmament, kills
Vritra (or Ahi), the Serpent-Demon -- for which feat he is called
<EM>Vritra-han, </EM>&quot;the destroyer of Vritra&quot;; he also
leads the hosts of <EM>Devas </EM>(Angels or gods) against other
gods who rebel against Brahma, for which he is entitled <EM>Jishnu,</EM>
&quot;leader of the celestial Host.&quot; Karttikeya is found
bearing the same titles. For killing Taraka, the Danava, he is
Taraka-Jit, &quot;Vanquisher of Taraka,&quot;***** &quot;<EM>Kumara
Guha,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>&quot;the mysterious Virgin-youth&quot;
&quot;<EM>Siddha-Sena</EM>&quot;<EM> -- </EM>&quot;the leader
of the Siddhas&quot;; and <EM>Saktidhara </EM>-- &quot;Spear-holder.&quot;
<P>
(2.) Now take Apollo, the Grecian sun-god, and by comparing the
mythical accounts given of him, see whether he does not answer
both
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Kasyapa is called the Son of Brahma, and is the &quot;Self-Born&quot;
to whom a great part of the work of creation is attributed. He
is one of the seven Rishis; <EM>exoterically,</EM> the son of
Marichi, the son of Brahma; while Atharva-veda says, &quot;The
Self-born Kasyapa sprang from Time&quot;; and <EM>esoterically
-- </EM>Time and Space are forms of the One <EM>incognizable </EM>Deity.
As an <EM>Aditya, </EM>Indra is son of Kasyapa, as also Vaivasvata
Manu, our progenitor. In the instance given in the text, he is
Kasyapa-Aditya, <EM>the Sun, and</EM> <EM>the Sun-god, from whom
all </EM>the &quot;Cosmic&quot; Demons, Dragons (nagas), Serpent,
or Snake-gods, and Danavas, the giants, are born. The meaning
of the allegories given above is purely astronomical and cosmical,
but will serve to prove the identity of all.
<P>
** All such stories differ in the <EM>exoteric </EM>texts. In
the Mahabharata, Karttikeya, &quot;the six-faced Mars,&quot; is
the son of Rudra or Siva, Self-born <EM>without a mother </EM>from
the seed of Siva cast into the fire. But Karttikeya is generally
called <EM>Agnibhu, </EM>&quot;fire born.&quot;
<P>
*** Hiranyaksha is the ruler or king of the <EM>fifth</EM> region
of Patala, a Snake-god.
<P>
**** The <EM>Elohim </EM>also feared the knowledge of Good and
Evil for Adam, and therefore are shown as expelling him from Eden
or killing him <EM>spiritually.</EM> 
<P>
***** The story told is, that Taraka (called also Kalabhana),
owing to his extraordinary Yoga-powers, had obtained all the divine
knowledge of yoga-vidya and occult powers of the gods, who conspired
against him. Here we see the &quot;obedient&quot; Host of <EM>Archangels
</EM>or minor gods conspiring against the (future) <EM>Fallen
</EM>angels, whom Enoch accuses of the great crime of disclosing
to the world all &quot;the <EM>secret things </EM>done in heaven.&quot;
It is Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Surgal and Uriel who denounced
to the Lord God those of their Brethren who were said <EM>to have
pried into the divine mysteries</EM> and taught them to men: by
this means they themselves escaped a like punishment. Michael
was commissioned to fight the Dragon, and so was Karttikeya, and
under the same circumstances. Both are &quot;leaders of the Celestial
Host,&quot; both Virgins, both &quot;leaders of Saints,&quot;
&quot;Spear-holders&quot; (<EM>Saktidhara</EM>),<EM> </EM>etc.,
etc. Karttikeya is the original of Michael and St. George, as
surely as Indra is the prototype of Karttikeya.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 383 THE GODS, THE FACETS OF ONE GEM. </H6>

<P>
to Indra, Karttikeya, and even Kasyapa-Aditya, and at the same
time to Michael (as the Angelic form of Jehovah) the &quot;angel
of the Sun,&quot; who is &quot;like,&quot; and &quot;one with,
God.&quot; Later ingenious interpretations for monotheistic purposes,
elevated though they be into not-to-be questioned Church dogmas,
prove nothing, except the abuse of human authority and power,
perhaps.
<P>
Apollo is <EM>Helios </EM>(the Sun), Phoibus-Apollo (&quot;the
light of life and of the World&quot;*) who arises out of the golden-winged
cup (the sun); hence he is the sun-god <EM>par excellence. </EM>At
the moment of his birth he asks for his bow to kill Python, the
Demon Dragon, who attacked his mother before his birth,** and
whom he is divinely commissioned to destroy -- like Karttikeya,
who is born for the purpose of killing Taraka, <EM>the too holy
and wise demon. </EM>Apollo is born on a sidereal island called
<EM>Asteria -- </EM>&quot;the golden star island,&quot; the &quot;earth
which floats in the air,&quot; which is the Hindu golden <EM>Hiranyapura</EM>;<EM>
</EM>&quot;he is called the pure, [[<EM>agnos</EM>]]<EM>, Agnus
Dei </EM>(the Indian <EM>Agni</EM>, as Dr. Kenealy thinks), and
in the primal myth he is exempt &quot;from all sensual love&quot;
(&quot;<EM>Book</EM> <EM>of God,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>p. 88). He
is, therefore, a <EM>Kumara, </EM>like Karttikeya, and as Indra
was in his earlier life and biographies. Python, moreover, the
&quot;red Dragon,&quot; connects Apollo with Michael, who fights
the Apocalyptic Dragon, who wants to attack the woman in child-birth
(See <EM>Revelation xii.</EM>)<EM>, </EM>as Python attacks Apollo's
mother. Can any one fail to see the identity? Had the Rt. Hon.
W. E. Gladstone, who prides himself on his Greek scholarship and
understanding of the spirit of Homer's allegories, ever had a
real inkling of the <EM>esoteric </EM>meaning of the <EM>Iliad
</EM>and <EM>Odyssey, </EM>he would have understood St. John's
&quot;<EM>Revelation,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>and even the Pentateuch,
better than he does. For the way to the Bible lies through Hermes,
Bel, and Homer, as the way to these is through the Hindu and Chaldean
religious symbols.
<P>
The repetition of this archaic tradition is found in ch. xii.
of St. John's <EM>Revelations, </EM>and comes from the Babylonian
legends without the smallest doubt, though the Babylonian story
had its origin in the allegories of the Aryans. The fragment read
by the late George Smith (See &quot;The Chaldean account of Genesis,&quot;
p. 304) is sufficient to disclose the source of the xii. chapter
of the Apocalypse. Here it is as given by the eminent Assyriologist:
<P>
&quot;Our . . . fragment refers to the creation of <EM>mankind,
</EM>called Adam; as (the man) in the Bible, he is made perfect
. . . but afterwards joins

<P>
* The &quot;life and the light&quot; of the material <EM>physical
</EM>world, the delight of the senses -- not of the soul. Apollo
is pre-eminently the <EM>human </EM>god, the god of emotional,
pomp-loving and theatrical Church ritualism, with lights and music.
<P>
** See chap. xii. in <EM>Revelation </EM>where we find Apollo's
mother persecuted by that Python, the Red Dragon, who is also
<EM>Porphyrion, </EM>the scarlet or red Titan.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 384 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
with the dragon of the Deep, the animal of Tiamat, the Spirit
of Chaos, and offends against his god, who <EM>curses him, </EM>and
calls down on his head all the evils and troubles of Humanity.&quot;*
<P>
&quot;This is followed by a war between the dragon and the powers
of evil, or chaos on one side and the gods on the other.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The gods have weapons forged for them,** and Merodach (the
archangel Michael in <EM>Revelation</EM>) undertakes to lead the
heavenly host against the dragons. The war, which is described
with spirit, ends, of course, in the triumph of the principles
of Good. . . . .&quot;***
<P>
This war of gods with the powers of the Deep, refers also, in
its last and terrestrial application, to the struggle between
the Aryan adepts of the nascent Fifth Race and the Sorcerers of
Atlantis, the Demons of the Deep, the Islanders surrounded with
water who disappeared in the Deluge. (See the last pages of Vol.
I., &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Atlantis.)
<P>
The symbols of the dragons and &quot;War in Heaven&quot; have,
as already stated, more than one significance; religious, astronomical
and geological events being included in the one common allegory.
But it had also a Cosmological meaning. In India the Dragon story
is repeated in one of its forms in the battles of Indra with <EM>Vritra.
</EM>In the Vedas this Ahi-Vritra is referred to as the Demon
of Drought, the terrible hot Wind. Indra is shown to be constantly
at war with him; and with the help of his thunder and lightning
the god compels Ahi-Vritra to pour down in rain on Earth, and
then slays him. Hence, Indra is called the <EM>Vritra-Han </EM>or
&quot;the slayer of Vritra,&quot; as Michael is called the Conqueror
and &quot;Slayer of the Dragon.&quot; Both these &quot;Enemies&quot;
are then the &quot;Old Dragon&quot; precipitated into the depths
of the Earth, in this one sense.
<P>
The Zend-Avestic Amshaspends are a Host with a leader like St.
Michael over them, and seem identical with the legions of Heaven,
when one reads the <EM>Vendidad. </EM>Thus in Fargard <STRONG>XIX</STRONG>.,
ii. 13 (42), Zarathustra is told by Ahura Mazda to &quot;invoke
the Amesha Spenta who rule over the seven <EM>Karshvares</EM>****<EM>
</EM>of the Earth&quot;; which Karshvares in their seven
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* No &quot;god&quot; who <EM>curses </EM>his (supposed) own work,
because he has made it imperfect, can be the one infinite absolute
wisdom, whether called Bel or Jehovah.
<P>
** In the Indian allegory of <EM>Tarakamaya, </EM>the war between
the gods and the Asuras headed by Soma (the moon, the King of
Plants), it is Viswa-Karma, the artificer of the gods, who forges,
like Vulcan (Tubal-Kain), their weapons for them.
<P>
*** We have said elsewhere that the &quot;woman with child&quot;
of Revelation (xii.) was Aime, the great mother, or Binah, the
third Sephiroth, &quot;whose name is Jehovah&quot;; and the &quot;Dragon,&quot;
who seeks to devour her coming child (the Universe), is the Dragon
of absolute Wisdom -- that Wisdom which, recognising the non-separateness
of the Universe and everything in it from the Absolute <STRONG>A</STRONG>LL,
sees in it no better than the great Illusion, <EM>Mahamaya, </EM>hence
the cause of misery and suffering.
<P>
**** The &quot;Seven Karshvares of the Earth&quot; -- the seven
spheres of our planetary chain, [[Footnote continued on next page]]
<HR>

<P>
[[Vol. 2, Page]] 385 THE BUILDERS OF THE MATERIAL WORLD.
<P>
applications refer equally to the seven spheres of our planetary
chain, to the seven planets, the seven heavens, etc., according
to whether the sense is applied to a physical, supra-mundane,
or simply a sidereal world. In the same Fargard (ii. and iii.),
in his invocation against Angra Mainyu and his Host, Zarathustra
appeals to them in these words: &quot;I invoke the seven bright
<EM>Sravah </EM>with their sons and their flocks&quot; (42 <EM>Vendid.</EM>
<EM>Saddh</EM>)<EM>. </EM>The &quot;Sravah&quot; -- a word which
the Orientalists have given up as one &quot;of unknown meaning&quot;
-- means the same Amshaspends, but in their highest occult meaning.
The &quot;<EM>Sravah</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>are the noumenoi of the
phenomenal Amshaspends, the souls or spirits of those <EM>manifested</EM>
Powers; and &quot;their sons and their flock&quot; refers to the
planetary angels and their sidereal flock of stars and constellations.
&quot;Amshaspend&quot; is the exoteric term used in terrestrial
combinations and affairs only. Zarathustra addresses Ahura Mazda
constantly as &quot;thou, the maker <EM>of the</EM> <EM>material
</EM>world.&quot; Ormazd is the father of our earth (Spenta Armaiti),
and she is referred to, when personified, as &quot;the fair daughter
of Ahura Mazda&quot; (<EM>Fargard, </EM><STRONG>XIX</STRONG>.
ii.), who is also the creator of the Tree (of occult and spiritual
knowledge and wisdom) from which the mystic and mysterious <EM>Caresma
</EM>is taken. But the occult name of the bright God was never
pronounced outside the temple.
<P>
Samael or Satan, the seducing Serpent of Genesis, and one of the
primeval angels who rebelled, is the name of the &quot;Red Dragon.&quot;
He is the Angel of <EM>Death, </EM>the Talmud saying that &quot;the
Angel of Death and Satan are the same,&quot; and, killed by Michael,
he is once more killed by St. George, who also is a Dragon Slayer;
but see the transformations of this. Samael is identical with
the <EM>Simoom, </EM>the hot wind of the desert, or again with
the Vedic demon of drought, as Vritra; &quot;<EM>Simoom </EM>is
called <EM>Atabutos</EM>&quot; or <EM>-- Diabolos, </EM>the devil.
<P>
Typhon, or the Dragon Aphophis -- the<EM> Accuser </EM>in the
&quot;Book of the Dead&quot; -- is worsted by Horus, who pierces
his opponent's head with a spear; and Typhon is the all-destroying
wind of the desert, the rebellious element that throws everything
into confusion. As <EM>Set -- </EM>he is the darkness of night,
the murderer of Osiris, who is the light of day and the sun. Archaeology
demonstrates that Horus is identical with Anubis,* whose effigy
was discovered upon an Egyptian monument, with a cuirass and a
spear, like Michael and St. George. Anubis is also represented

as opposed to that which is <EM>yonder </EM>(the six globes on

(See Lenoir's &quot;Du Dragon de Metz.&quot;)
<P>
Cosmologically, then, all the Dragons and Serpents conquered by
their &quot;Slayers&quot; are, in their origin, the turbulent
confused principles in Chaos, brought to order by the Sun-gods
or <EM>creative </EM>powers. In the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;
those principles are called &quot;the Sons of Rebellion.&quot;
(See also &quot;<EM>Egyptian Pantheon,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>pp.<EM>

the same myth. The &quot;evil Spirits,&quot;* having begun by
being simply the emblems of Chaos, became euhemerized by the superstition
of the rabble, until they have finally won the right of citizenship
in the most civilized and learned races of this globe -<EM>- since
its creation </EM>as alleged -- and became a dogma with Christians.
As George Smith has it: &quot;The evil principles (Spirits) emblems
of Chaos&quot; (in Chaldea and Assyria as in Egypt, we see) .
. &quot;resist this change and make war on the Moon, the eldest
son of Bel, drawing over to their side the Sun, Venus and the
atmospheric god Vul.&quot; (&quot;Assyrian Discoveries,&quot;
p. 403.) This is only another version of the Hindu &quot;War in
Heaven,&quot; between Soma, the moon, and the gods -- Indra being
the atmospheric Vul; which shows it plainly to be both a Cosmogonical
and an astronomical allegory, woven into and drawn from the earliest
theogony as taught in the Mysteries.
<P>
It is in the religious doctrines of the Gnostics that the real
meaning of the Dragon, the Serpent, the Goat, and all those symbols
of powers now called <EM>Evil</EM>, can be seen the best; as it
is they who divulged the esoteric nature of the Jewish Substitute
for <STRONG>AIN-SOPH </STRONG><EM>in their </EM>teachings; of
the true meaning of which, while the Rabbins concealed it, the
Christians, with a few exceptions, knew nothing. Surely Jesus
of Nazareth would have hardly advised his apostles to show themselves
as <EM>wise </EM>as the serpent, had the latter been a symbol
of the <EM>Evil one</EM>;<EM> </EM>nor would the Ophites, the
learned Egyptian Gnostics of &quot;the Brotherhood of the Serpent,&quot;
have reverenced a living snake in their ceremonies as the emblem
of <STRONG>WISDOM</STRONG><EM>, </EM>the divine <EM>Sophia </EM>(and
a type of the all-good, not the all-bad), were that reptile so
closely connected with Satan. The fact is, that even as a common
ophidian it has ever been a dual symbol; and

<P>
as a Dragon it had never been anything else than a symbol of the
manifested Deity in its great Wisdom. The <EM>Draco volans, </EM>the
flying Dragon of the early painters, may be an exaggerated picture
of the real extinct antediluvian animal; but those who have faith
in the Occult teachings believe that in the days of old there
were such creatures as flying Dragons, or a kind of Pterodactyl,
and that it is those gigantic winged lizards that served as the
prototypes for the Seraph of Moses and his great Brazen Serpent.*
The Jews had worshipped the latter <EM>idol </EM>themselves, but,
after the religious reforms brought about by Hezekiah, turned
round, and called that symbol of the great or Higher God of every
other nation -- a Devil, and their own usurper -- the &quot;One
God.&quot;**
<P>
The appellation Sa'tan, in Hebrew <EM>satan, </EM>&quot;an adversary&quot;
(from the verb <EM>shatana, </EM>&quot;to be adverse,&quot; to
persecute) belongs by right to the first and cruelest &quot;<EM>adversary
of all the other gods</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>-- Jehovah, not to the
Serpent, which spoke only words of sympathy and wisdom, and is
at the worst, even in the dogma, &quot;the adversary of men.&quot;
This dogma, based as it is on chapter iii. of <EM>Genesis, </EM>is
as illogical and unjust as it is paradoxical. For who was the
first to <EM>create </EM>that original and hence-forward universal
tempter of man -- the woman? Not the serpent surely, but the &quot;Lord
God&quot; himself, who, saying: -- &quot;It is not good that the
man should be alone&quot; -- made woman, and &quot;brought her
unto the man&quot; (18-22). If the unpleasant little incident
that followed <EM>was </EM>and is still to be regarded as the
&quot;original sin,&quot; then it exhibits the Creator's divine
foresight in a poor light indeed. It would have been far better
for the first Adam (of chap. 1.) to have been left either &quot;male
and female,&quot; or &quot;alone.&quot; It is the Lord God, evidently,
who was the real cause of all the mischief, the &quot;<EM>agent
provocateur,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>and the Serpent -- only a prototype
of <EM>Azazel, </EM>&quot;the scapegoat for the sin of (the God
of) Israel,&quot; the poor <EM>Tragos </EM>having to pay the penalty
for his Master's and Creator's blunder. This, of course, is addressed
only to those who accept the opening events of the drama of humanity
in <EM>Genesis </EM>in their dead-letter sense. Those who read
them esoterically, are not reduced to fanciful

* See Numbers xxi. 8-9. God orders Moses to build a brazen Serpent
&quot;Saraph&quot;; <EM>to look upon which </EM>heals those bitten
by the <EM>fiery serpents. </EM>The latter were the <EM>Seraphim</EM>,
each one of which, as Isaiah shows (vi. 2), &quot;<EM>had six
wings</EM>&quot;;<EM> </EM>they are the symbols of Jehovah, and
of all the other Demiurgi who produce out of themselves six sons
or likenesses -- Seven with their Creator. Thus, the Brazen Serpent
<EM>is</EM> Jehovah, the chief of the &quot;fiery serpents.&quot;
And yet, in 2 Kings xviii., it is shown that King Hezekiah, who,
like as David his father, &quot;did that which was right in the
sight of the Lord&quot; -- &quot;brake in pieces the brazen serpent
that Moses had made . . . and called it <EM>Nehushtan,</EM>&quot;<EM>

Israel (Chron. xxi. 1.) &quot;The anger of the Lord Jehovah was

speculations and hypothesis; <EM>they know </EM>how to read the
symbolism therein contained, and cannot err.
<P>
There is at present no need to touch upon the mystic and manifold
meaning of the name Jehovah in its abstract sense, one independent
of the Deity <EM>falsely </EM>called by that name. It was a blind
created purposely by the Rabbins, a secret preserved by them with
ten-fold care after the Christians had despoiled them of this
God-name which was their own property.* But the following statement
is made. The personage who is named in the first four chapters
of <EM>Genesis </EM>variously as &quot;God,&quot; the &quot;Lord
God,&quot; and &quot;Lord&quot; simply, is not one and the same
person; certainly it is not <EM>Jehovah.</EM> There are three
distinct classes or groups of the Elohim called Sephiroth in the
Kabala, Jehovah appearing only in chapter iv., in the first verse
of which he is named Cain, and in the last transformed into <EM>mankind
-- </EM>male and female, jah-veh.** The &quot;Serpent,&quot; moreover,
is not Satan, but the bright Angel, one of the <EM>Elohim </EM>clothed
in radiance and glory, who, promising the woman that if they ate
of the forbidden fruit &quot;<EM>ye shall not surely die,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>kept his promise, and made man immortal in his <EM>incorruptible
nature. </EM>He is the Iao of the mysteries, the chief of the
Androgyne creators of men. Chapter iii. contains (esoterically)
the withdrawal of the veil of ignorance that closed the perceptions
of the Angelic Man, made in the image of the &quot;Boneless&quot;
gods, and the opening of his consciousness to his real nature;
thus showing the bright Angel (Lucifer) in the light of a giver
of Immortality, and as the &quot;Enlightener&quot;; while the
real Fall into generation and matter is to be sought in chapter
iv. There, Jehovah-Cain, the male part of Adam the <EM>dual </EM>man,
having separated himself from Eve, creates in her &quot;Abel,&quot;
<EM>the first natural woman,</EM>*<EM> </EM>and sheds the <EM>Virgin
blood. </EM>Now Cain, being shown identical with Jehovah, on the
authority of the correct reading of verse i. (chapter iv., Genesis),
in the original Hebrew text; and the Rabbins teaching that &quot;<EM>Kin
</EM>(Cain), the Evil, was the Son of Eve by Samael, the devil
who took Adam's place&quot;; and the Talmud adding that &quot;the
evil Spirit, Satan, and Samael, the angel of Death, are the same&quot;
--(<EM>Babba Battra, 16a</EM>)<EM> </EM>-- it becomes easy to
see that Jehovah (<EM>mankind, or</EM> &quot;Jah-hovah&quot;)
and Satan (therefore the tempting Serpent) are one and

* Dozens of the most erudite writers have sifted thoroughly the
various meanings of the name J'hovah (with, and without the masoretic

** In the above-mentioned work (p. 233 App.), verse 26 of the

explained, perhaps, as the last word ought to be written <EM>Jah</EM>

time the race of distinctly separate man and woman began.

the same in every particular. <EM>There is no Devil, no Evil,
outside mankind</EM> <EM>to produce a Devil. </EM>Evil is a necessity
in, and one of the supporters of the manifested universe. It is
a necessity for progress and evolution, as night is necessary
for the production of Day, and Death for that of Life -- <EM>that
man may live for ever.</EM> 
<P>
Satan represents metaphysically simply the <EM>reverse or the
polar opposite </EM>of everything in nature.* He is the &quot;adversary,&quot;
allegorically, the &quot;murderer,&quot; and the great Enemy of
<EM>all</EM>, because there is nothing in the whole universe that
has not two sides -- the reverses of the same medal. But in that
case, light, goodness, beauty, etc., may be called Satan with
as much propriety as the Devil, since they are the <EM>adversaries
</EM>of darkness, badness, and ugliness. And now the philosophy
and the <EM>rationale</EM> of certain early Christian sects --
called <EM>heretical </EM>and viewed as the abomination of the
times -- will become more comprehensible. We may understand how
it was that the sect of <STRONG>S</STRONG>ATANIANS came to be
degraded, and were anathematized without any hope of vindication
in a future day, since they kept their tenets secret. How, on
the same principle, the <STRONG>C</STRONG>AINITES came to be degraded,
and even the (Judas) <STRONG>I</STRONG>SCARIOTES; the true character
of the <EM>treacherous </EM>apostle having never been correctly
presented before the tribunal of Humanity.
<P>
As a direct consequence, the tenets of the Gnostic sects also
become clear. Each of these sects was founded by an Initiate,
while their tenets were based on the correct knowledge of the
symbolism of every nation. Thus it becomes comprehensible why
Ilda-Baoth was regarded by most of them as the god of Moses, and
was held as a proud, ambitious, and impure spirit, who had abused
his power by usurping the place of the <EM>highest God, </EM>though
he was no better, and in some respects far worse than <EM>his
brethren Elohim</EM>;<EM> </EM>the latter representing the all-embracing,
manifested deity only in their collectivity, since they were the
fashioners of the first differentiations of the primary Cosmic
substance for the creation of the phenomenal Universe. Therefore
Jehovah was called by the Gnostics the Creator of, and one with
Ophiomorphos, the Serpent, Satan, or <STRONG>EVIL</STRONG><EM>.
</EM>(<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM><STRONG>II,</STRONG><EM>
</EM>184). They taught that Turbo and Adonai were &quot;names
of Jao-Jehovah, who is an emanation of Ilda Baoth&quot; (<EM>Codex
Nazaraeus</EM>)<EM>. </EM>(<EM>See Part II., </EM>&quot;<EM>The
Fallen</EM> <EM>Angels.</EM>&quot;) This amounted in their language
to saying what the Rabbins expressed in a more veiled way, by
stating that -- &quot;Cain had been generated by Samael or Satan.&quot;

* In Demonology, Satan is the leader of the opposition in Hell,
the monarch of which was Beelzebub. He belongs to the fifth kind
or class of demons (of which there are nine according to mediaeval
demonology), and he is at the head of witches and sorcerers. But
see in the text the true meaning of Baphomet, the goat-headed
Satan, one with Azaziel, the scape goat of Israel. Nature is the
god <STRONG>PAN. </STRONG><HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 390 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
The fallen Angels are made in every ancient system the prototypes
of <EM>fallen </EM>men -- allegorically, and, <EM>those men themselves
-- </EM>esoterically. Thus the Elohim of the hour of creation
became the &quot;Beni-Elohim,&quot; the sons of God, among whom
is Satan -- in the Semitic traditions; war in heaven between Thraetaona
and Azhi-dahaka, the destroying Serpent, ends on earth, according
to Burnouf, in the battle of pious men against the power of Evil,
&quot;of the Iranians with the Aryan Brahmins of India.&quot;
And the conflict of the gods with the <EM>Asuras </EM>is repeated
in the Great War -- the Mahabharata. In the latest religion of
all, Christianity, all the Combatants, gods and demons, adversaries
in both the camps, are now transformed into Dragons and Satans,
simply in order to connect <STRONG>EVIL</STRONG><EM> </EM>personified
with the Serpent of Genesis, and thus prove the new dogma.*

<P>
It matters little whether it is Isis, or Ceres -- the &quot;Kabiria&quot;
-- or again the Kabiri, who have taught men agriculture; but it
is very important to prevent fanatics from monopolising all the
facts in history and legend, and from fathering their distortions
of truth, history, and legend upon one man. Noah is either a <EM>myth
</EM>along with the others, or one whose legend was built upon
the Kabirian or Titanic tradition, as taught in Samothrace; he
has, therefore, no claim to be monopolized by either Jew or Christian.
If, as Faber tried to demonstrate at such cost of learning and
research, Noah is an Atlantean and a Titan, and his family are
the Kabiri or pious Titans, etc. -- then biblical chronology falls
by its own weight, and along with it all the patriarchs -- the
antediluvian and pre-Atlantean Titans. As now discovered and proven,
Cain is Mars, the god of <EM>power and generation, </EM>and of
the first (sexual) bloodshed.** Tubal-Cain is a Kabir, &quot;an
instructor of every artificer in brass and iron&quot;; or -- if
this will please better -- he is one with Hephaestos or Vulcan;
Jabal is taken from the Kabiri -- instructors in agriculture,
&quot;such as have cattle,&quot; and Jubal is &quot;the father
of all those who handle the harp,&quot; he, or <EM>they </EM>who
fabricated the <EM>harp </EM>for Kronos and the trident for Poseidon.***

<P>
The history or &quot;fables&quot; about the mysterious Telchines
-- fables echoing each and all the archaic events of our esoteric
teachings -- furnish us with a key to the origin of <EM>Cain</EM>'<EM>s</EM>
genealogy (<EM>Genesis, </EM>ch. iii.); they give the reason why
the Roman Catholic Church identifies &quot;the accursed blood&quot;
of Cain and Ham with Sorcery, and makes it responsible for the
Deluge. Were not the Telchines -- it is argued -- the mysterious
ironworkers of Rhodes; they who were the first to raise statues
to the gods, furnish them with weapons, and men with magic arts?
And is it not they who were destroyed by a deluge at the command
of Zeus, as the <EM>Cainites </EM>were by that of Jehovah?
<P>
The Telchines are simply the Kabiri and the Titans, in another
form. They are the Atlanteans also. &quot;Like Lemnos and Samothrace,&quot;
says Decharme, &quot;Rhodes, the birth-place of the Telchines,
is an island of volcanic formation.&quot; (<EM>Genii of Fire,
p. </EM>271.) The island of Rhodes emerged suddenly out of the
seas, after having been previously engulfed by the Ocean, say
the traditions. Like Samothrace (of the Kabiri) it is connected
in the memory of men with the Flood legends. As enough has been
said on this subject, however, it may be left for the present.
<P>
But we may add a few more words about Noah, the Jewish representative
of nearly every pagan God in one or another character. The Homeric
songs contain, poetized, all the later fables about the Patriarchs,
who are all sidereal, cosmic, and numerical symbols and signs.
The attempt to disconnect the two genealogies -- those of Seth
and Cain* -- and the further attempt, as futile, to show them
<EM>real, historical </EM>men, has only led to more serious inquiries
into the history of the Past, and to discoveries which have damaged
for ever the supposed <EM>revelation. </EM>For instance, the identity
of Noah and Melchizedek being established, the further identity
of Melchizedek, or Father Sadik, with Kronos-Saturn is proved
also.
<P>
That it is so may be easily demonstrated. It is not denied by
any of the Christian writers. Bryant (<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Analysis
of Ancient Mythology,</EM>&quot;<EM> Vol.</EM> <EM>II., p. </EM>760)
concurs with all those who are of opinion, that Sydic, or

<P>
* Nothing could be more awkward and childish, we say, than this
fruitless attempt to disconnect the genealogies of Cain and of
Seth, or to conceal the identity of names under a different spelling.
Thus, Cain has a Son <STRONG>E</STRONG>NOCH, and Seth a Son <STRONG>E</STRONG>NOCH
also (Enos, Ch'anoch, Hanoch; -- one may do what one likes with
Hebrew unvowelled names). In the Cainite line Enoch begets <STRONG>I</STRONG>RAD,
Irad <STRONG>M</STRONG>EHUJAEL, the latter <STRONG>M</STRONG>ETHUSAEL,
and Methusael, Lamech. In the Sethite line, Enoch begets Cainan,
and this one <STRONG>M</STRONG>AHALEEL (a variation on Mehujael),
who gives birth to <STRONG>J</STRONG>ARAD (or Irad); Jarad to
<STRONG>E</STRONG>NOCH (Number 3), who produces Methuselah (from
Methusael), and finally Lamech closes the list. Now all these
are symbols (Kabalistically) of solar and lunar years, of astronomical
periods, and of physiological (phallic) functions, just as in
any other pagan symbolical creed. This has been proven by a number
of writers.<HR>

Sadic, was the patriarch Noah (as also Melchizedek); and that
the name by which he is called, or Sadic, corresponds to the character

was <IMG SRC="sd2-392.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">, Sadic, a JUST man,

Now it is Sanchoniathon, who informs the world that the Kabiri
were the Sons of Sydic or Zedek (Melchizedek). True enough, this
information, having descended to us through Eusebius (<EM>Preparatio
Evangelica</EM>), may be regarded with a certain amount of suspicion,
as it is more than likely that he dealt with Sanchoniathon's works
as he has with Manetho's Synchronistic Tables. But let us suppose
that the identification of Sydic, Kronos, or Saturn with Noah
and Melchizedek, is based on one of the Eusebian pious hypotheses.
Let us accept it as such, along with Noah's characteristic as
a <EM>just man, </EM>and his supposed duplicate, the mysterious
Melchizedek, King of Salem, and priest of the high god, after
&quot;his own order&quot; (<EM>See Hebrews, ch. v</EM>. 6, <EM>and
vii. 1, et seq.</EM>);<EM> </EM>and finally, having seen what
they all were spiritually, astronomically, psychically and cosmically,
let us now see what they became <EM>rabbinically </EM>and <STRONG>K</STRONG>ABALISTICALLY.
<P>
Speaking of Adam, Kain, Mars, etc., as <EM>personifications, </EM>we
find the author of &quot;<EM>The Source of Measures</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>enunciating our very esoteric teachings in his Kabalistic
researches. Thus he says: --

* The AEolian name of Mars was [[<EM>Areus</EM>]], and the Greek
Ares, [[<EM>Ares</EM>]], is a name over the etymological significance
of which, philologists and Indianists, Greek and Sanskrit scholars
have vainly worked to this day. Very strangely, Max Muller connects
both the names <EM>Mars</EM> and<EM> Ares </EM>with the Sanskrit
root <EM>mar</EM>, whence he traces their derivation, and from
which, he says, the name of <EM>Maruts </EM>(the storm-gods) comes.
Welcker, however, offers more correct etymologies. (<EM>See Griech.
Gotterlehre, I., </EM>415.) However it may be, etymologies of
roots and words alone will never yield the esoteric meaning fully,
though they may help to useful guesses.

The<EM> Noachian </EM>Deluge, as described in its dead letter
and within the period of Biblical chronology, having been shown
to have never existed, the pious, but very arbitrary supposition
of Bishop Cumberland has but to follow that deluge into the land
of fiction. Indeed it seems rather fanciful to any impartial observer
to be told that there were &quot;two distinct races of Kabiri,&quot;
the first consisting of Ham and Mizraim, whom he conceives to
be Jupiter and Dionysus of Mnaseas; the second, &quot;of the children
of Shem, are the Kabiri of Sochoniston, while their father Sydyk
is consequently the Scriptural Shem.&quot; (<EM>Append. de Cabiris,

Legendary lore could not distort facts so effectually as to reduce
them to unrecognisable shape. Between the traditions of Egypt
and Greece on the one hand, and Persia on the other -- a country
ever at war with the former -- there is too great a similarity
of figures and numbers to allow such coincidence to be due to
simple chance. This was well proven by Bailly. Let us pause for
a moment to examine these traditions from every available source,
to compare the better those of the Magi with the so-called Grecian

Those legends have now passed into popular tales, the folklore
of Persia, as many a real fiction has found its way into our universal
History. The stories of King Arthur and his knights of the Round

<P>
Before the creation of <EM>Adam, </EM>two races lived and succeeded
each other on Earth; the Devs who reigned 7,000 years, and the
Peris (the Izeds) who reigned but 2,000, during the existence
of the former. The Devs were giants, strong and wicked; the Peris
were smaller in stature, but wiser and kinder.
<P>
Here we recognize the Atlantean giants and the Aryans, or the
Rakshasas of the Ramayana and the children of Bharata Varsha,
or India; the ante- and the post-diluvians of the Bible.
<P>
Gyan (or rather Gnan, true or occult Wisdom and knowledge), also
called <EM>Gian-ben-Gian </EM>(or Wisdom, son of Wisdom), was
the king of the Peris.* He had a shield as famous as that of Achilles,
only instead of serving against an enemy in war, it served as
a protection against black magic, the <EM>sorcery </EM>of the
Devs. Gian-ben-Gian had reigned 2,000 years when <EM>Iblis, </EM>the
devil, was permitted by God to defeat the Devs and scatter them
to the other end of the world. Even the magic shield, which, produced
on the principles of astrology, destroyed charms, enchantments,
and bad spells, could not prevail against <EM>Iblis, </EM>who
was an agent of Fate (or Karma).** They count ten kings in their
last metropolis called Khanoom, and make the tenth, Kaimurath,
identical with the Hebrew Adam. These kings answer to the ten
antediluvian generations of kings as given by Berosus.
<P>
Distorted as those legends are now found, one can hardly fail
to identify them with the Chaldean, Egyptian, Greek, and even
Hebrew traditions. The latter, disdaining in its exclusiveness
to speak of pre-adamite nations, yet allows these to be clearly
inferred, by sending out Cain -- <EM>one of the two only living
men on earth </EM>-- into the land of Nod, where he gets married
and builds a city (<EM>Gen. iv.</EM>), etc.
<P>
Now if we compare the 9,000 years mentioned by the Persian tales
with the 9,000 years, which Plato declared had passed since the
submersion of the last Atlantis, a very strange fact is made apparent.
Bailly remarked, but distorted it by his interpretation. The Secret
Doctrine may restore the figures to their true meaning. &quot;First
of all,&quot; we read in &quot;Critias&quot; that &quot;one must
remember that 9,000 years have elapsed <EM>since the war of the
nations, </EM>which lived above and outside the Pillars of Hercules,
and those which peopled the lands on this side.&quot;

* Some derive the word from <EM>Paras </EM>which produced Pars,

called Pitar, as were the divine Pitars of the First Race.

<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 395 ESOTERIC CHRONOLOGY.</H6>

<P>
In<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Timaeus</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Plato says the
same. The Secret Doctrine declaring that most of the later islander
Atlanteans perished in the interval between 850,000 and 700,000
years ago, and that the Aryans were 200,000 years old when the
first great &quot;island&quot; or continent was submerged, there
hardly seems any reconciliation possible between the figures.
But there is, in truth. Plato, being an Initiate, had to use the
veiled language of the Sanctuary, and so had the Magi of Chaldea
and Persia, through whose exoteric revelations the Persian legends
were preserved and passed to posterity. Thus, one finds the Hebrews
calling a week &quot;seven days,&quot; and &quot;a week of years&quot;
when each of its days represents 360 solar years, and the whole
&quot;week&quot; is 2,520 years, in fact. They had a Sabbatical
week, a Sabbatical year, etc., etc., and their Sabbath lasted
indifferently 24 hours or 24,000 years -- in their secret calculations
of the Sods. We of the present times call an age <EM>a century.
</EM>They of Plato's day, the initiated writers, at any rate,
meant by a millenium, not a thousand but 100,000 years; Hindus,
more independent than any, never concealed their chronology. Thus,
when saying 9,000 years, the Initiates will read 900,000 years,
during which space of time -<EM>- i.e</EM>, from the first appearance
of the Aryan race, when the Pliocene portions of the once great
Atlantis began gradually sinking* and other continents to appear
on the surface, down to the final disappearance of Plato's small
island of Atlantis, the Aryan races had never ceased to fight
with the descendants of the first giant races. This war lasted
till nearly the close of the age which preceded the Kali Yug,
and was the Mahabharatean war so famous in Indian History. Such
blending of the events and epochs, and the bringing down of hundreds
of thousands into thousands of years, does not interfere with
the numbers of years that had elapsed, according to the statement
made by the Egyptian priests to Solon, since the destruction of
the last portion of Atlantis. The 9,000 years were the correct
figures given. The latter event has never been kept a secret,
and had only faded out of the memory of the Greeks. The Egyptians
had their records complete, because isolated; for, being surrounded
by sea and desert, they had been left untrammelled by other nations,
till about a few millenniums before our era.
<P>
History, for the first time, catches a glimpse of Egypt and its
great mysteries through Herodotus, if we do not take into account
the Bible, and its queer chronology.** And how little Herodotus
<EM>could </EM>tell is

** From Bede downwards all the chronologists of the Church have
differed among themselves, and contradicted each other. &quot;The
chronology of the Hebrew text has been grossly altered, especially
in the interval next after the Deluge&quot;: -- says Whiston (<EM>Old

<P>
confessed by himself when speaking of a mysterious tomb of an
Initiate at Sais, in the sacred precinct of Minerva. There, he
says &quot;behind the chapel . . . is the tomb of One, <EM>whose
name I consider it impious to</EM> <EM>divulge </EM>. . . In the
enclosure stand large obelisks and there is a <EM>lake</EM> near,
surrounded with a stone wall formed <EM>in a circle. </EM>In this
lake they perform by night, that person's adventures, which they
call <EM>Mysteries:</EM> on these matters, however, though I am
accurately acquainted with the particulars of them, <EM>I must
observe a discreet silence</EM>&quot; (<EM>ii. </EM>170).
<P>
On the other hand, it is well to know that no secret was so well
preserved and so sacred with the ancients, as that of their cycles
and computations. From the Egyptians down to the Jews it was held
as the highest sin to divulge anything pertaining to the correct
measure of time. It was for divulging <EM>the secrets of the Gods,
</EM>that Tantalus was plunged into the infernal regions; the
keepers of the sacred Sibylline Books were threatened with the
death penalty for revealing a word from them. Sigalions (images
of Harpocrates) were in every temple -- especially in those of
Isis and Serapis -- each pressing a finger to the lips; while
the Hebrews taught that to divulge, after initiation into the
Rabbinical mysteries, the secrets of Kabala, was like eating of
the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge: it was punishable by death.
<P>
And yet, we Europeans accepted the exoteric chronology of the
Jews! What wonder that it has influenced and coloured ever since
all our conceptions of science and the duration of things!
<P>
The Persian traditions, then, are full of two nations or races,
now entirely extinct, as some think; whereas, they are only transformed.
They are ever speaking of, and describing the mountains of Kaf
(Kafaristan?), which contain a gallery built by the giant Argeak,
wherein the statues of the ancient men under all their forms are
preserved. They call them <EM>Sulimans </EM>(Solomons), or the
wise kings of the East, and count seventy-two kings of that name.*
Three among them reigned for 1,000 years each. (<EM>Herbelot,
p. </EM>829.)
<P>
Siamek, the beloved son of Kaimurath (Adam), their first king,
died murdered by his giant brother. The father had a perpetual
fire preserved on the tomb which contained his cremated ashes;
hence -- the origin of fire-worship, as some Orientalists think.
<P>
Then came <EM>Huschenk, </EM>the prudent and the wise. It was
his dynasty which re-discovered metals and precious stones, which
had been concealed by the Devs or Giants in the bowels of the
earth; how to make brass-work, to cut canals, and improve agriculture.
As usual, it is Huschenk, again, who is credited with having written
the work called

&quot;Eternal Wisdom,&quot; and even with having built the cities
of Luz, Babylon and Ispahan, though they were built ages later.
But as modern Delhi is built on six other older cities, so these
just-named cities may be built on emplacements of other cities
of an immense antiquity. As to his date, it can only be inferred
from another legend.
<P>
In the same tradition that wise prince is credited with having
made war against the giants on a twelve-legged horse, whose birth
is attributed to the <EM>amours </EM>of a crocodile with a female
hippopotamus. This <EM>dodecaped </EM>was found on the &quot;dry
island&quot; or new continent; much force and cunning had to be
used to secure the wonderful animal, but no sooner had Huschenk
mounted him, than he defeated every enemy. No giants could withstand
his tremendous power. Notwithstanding, this king of kings was
killed by an enormous rock thrown at him by the giants from the
great mountains of <EM>Damavend.</EM>*
<P>
Tahmurath is the third king of Persia, the St. George of Iran,
the knight who always has the best of, and who kills, the Dragon.
He is the great enemy of the Devs who, in his day, dwelled in
the mountains of Kaf, and occasionally made raids on the Peris.
The old French chronicles of the Persian folklore call him the
<EM>Dev-bend, </EM>the conqueror of the giants. He, too, is credited
with having founded Babylon, Nineveh, Diarbek, etc., etc. Like
his grand-sire Huschenk, Tahmurath (Taimuraz) also had his steed,
only far more rare and rapid -- a bird called <EM>Simorgh-Anke.
</EM>A marvellous bird, in truth, intelligent, a polyglot, and
even very religious. (<EM>See Orient. Collect. ii., </EM>119.)
What says that Persian Phoenix? It complains of its old age, for
it is born cycles and cycles before the days of Adam (also Kaimurath).
It has witnessed the revolutions of long centuries. It has seen
the birth and the close of twelve cycles of 7,000 years each,
which multiplied esoterically will give us again 840,000 years.**
(<EM>Orient. Collect. ii., 119 et seq</EM>.) Simorgh is born with
the last deluge of the pre-Adamites, says the &quot;romance of
Simorgh and the good Khalif&quot;! (<EM>Tales of Derbent.</EM>)
<P>
What says the &quot;Book of Numbers&quot;? Esoterically, Adam
Rishoon is the lunar Spirit (Jehovah, in a sense, or the Pitris)
and his three Sons -- Ka-yin, Habel, and Seth -- represent the
three races, as already explained. Noah-Xisuthrus represents in
his turn (in the cosmo-geological key) the 3rd Race separated,
and his three sons, its last three races; Ham, moreover, symbolizing
that race which uncovered the &quot;<EM>nakedness</EM>&quot; of
the Parent Race, and of the &quot;Mindless,&quot; <EM>i.e.</EM>,
committed sin.

Tahmurath visits on his winged steed (Ahriman) the Mountains of
Koh-Kaf or <EM>Kaph. </EM>He finds there the Peris ill-treated
by the giants, and slays Argen, and the giant <EM>Demrusch. </EM>Then
he liberates the good Peri, Mergiana*, whom Demrusch had kept
as a prisoner, and takes her over to the <EM>dry</EM> island,<EM>
i.e.</EM>, the new continent of Europe.** After him came Giamschid,
who builds <EM>Esikekar, </EM>or Persepolis. This king reigns
700 years, and believes himself, in his great pride, immortal,
and demands divine honours. Fate punishes him, he wanders for
100 years in the world under the name of <EM>Dhulkarnayn </EM>&quot;the
two horned.&quot; But this epithet has no connection with the
&quot;two-horned&quot; gentleman of the cloven foot. The &quot;two-horned&quot;
is the epithet given in Asia, uncivilized enough to know nothing
of the attributes of the devil, to those conquerors who have subdued
the world from the East to the West.
<P>
Then come the usurper <EM>Zohac, </EM>and Feridan, one of the
Persian heroes, who vanquishes the former, and shuts him up in
the mountains of Damavend. These are followed by many others down
to <EM>Kaikobad,</EM> who founded a new dynasty.
<P>
Such is the legendary history of Persia, and we have to analyze
it. What are the mountains of <EM>Kaf </EM>to begin with?
<P>
Whatever they may be in their geographical status, whether they
are the Caucasian or Central Asian mountains, it is far beyond
these mountains to the North, that legend places the Devs and
Peris; the latter the remote ancestors of the Parses or Farses.
Oriental tradition is ever referring to an unknown glacial, gloomy
sea, and to a dark region, within which, nevertheless, are situated
<EM>the Fortunate Islands, </EM>wherein bubbles, from the beginning
of life on earth, the <EM>fountain of life </EM>(<EM>Herbelot,
p. 593</EM>;<EM> Armenian Tales, p. 35</EM>)<EM>. </EM>But the
legend asserts, moreover, that a portion of the first <EM>dry</EM>
island (continent), having detached itself from the main body,
has remained, since then, beyond the mountains of Koh-kaf, &quot;the
stony girdle that surrounds the world.&quot; A journey of seven
months' duration will bring him who is possessed of &quot;Soliman's
ring&quot; to that &quot;fountain,&quot; if he keeps on journeying
North straight before him as the bird flies. Journeying therefore
from Persia <EM>straight north, </EM>will bring one along the
sixtieth degree of longitude, holding to the west, to Nova Zemblia;

<P>
Nevertheless, the wandering songsters of Persia and the Caucasus
will maintain, to this day, that far beyond the snow-capped summits
of Kap, or Caucasus, <EM>there is a great continent now concealed
from all. </EM>That it is reached by those who can secure the
services of the twelvelegged progeny of the crocodile and the
female hippopotamus, whose legs become at will <EM>twelve wings</EM>**;<EM>
</EM>or by those who have the patience to wait for the good pleasure

race, Simorgh being the Manvantaric cycle.

named the <EM>dry </EM>island. (<EM>Supra, p.</EM> 154.)
<P>
The &quot;Christian topography&quot; of Cosmas Indicopleustes
and its merits are well known; but here the good father repeats
a universal tradition, now, moreover, corroborated by facts. Every
arctic traveller suspects a continent or a &quot;dry island&quot;
beyond the line of eternal ice. Perhaps now the meaning of the
following passage from one of the Commentaries may become clearer.

* To this day the aborigines of Caucasus speak of their mountains
as Kap-kaz, using the consonant p instead of the usual v (Kavkaz
or Caucasus). But their bards say that it requires seven months
for a swift horse to reach the &quot;dry land&quot; beyond Kaf,
holding north without ever deviating from one's way.
<P>
** Bailly thought he saw in this horse a twelve-oared ship. The
Secret Doctrine teaches that the early Third Race built boats
and flotillas before it built houses. But the &quot;horse,&quot;
though a much later animal, has, nevertheless, a more occult primitive
meaning. The crocodile and the hippopotamus were held sacred and
represented divine symbols, both with the ancient Egyptians and
with the Mexicans. Poseidon is, in Homer, the God of the Horse,
and assumes that form himself to please Ceres. Arion, their progeny,
is one of the aspects of that &quot;horse,&quot; which is a cycle.

* Occultism points to the Himalayan chain as that &quot;belt,&quot;
and maintains that whether under the water or above, it encircles
the globe. The <EM>navel</EM> is described as situated to the
setting sun or to the west of the Himavat in which lie the roots
of Meru, which mountain is north of the Himalaya. Meru is <EM>not
</EM>&quot;the fabulous mountain in the navel or centre of the
earth,&quot; but its roots and foundations are in that navel,
though it is in the far north itself. This connects it with the
&quot;central&quot; land &quot;that never perishes&quot;; the
land in which &quot;the day of the mortal lasts six months and
his night another six months.&quot; As the Vishnu Purana has it:
&quot;for the North of Meru there is, therefore, always night

*** For the Stanzas call this locality by a term translated in
the commentary as <EM>a place of no latitude </EM>(niraksha) the
abode of the gods. As a scholiast says from the <EM>Surya-Sidhanta:</EM>

<P>
&quot;Above this (the Siddha) goes the sun when situated at the
equinoxes; they have neither equinoctial shadow nor elevation
of the pole (<EM>akshonnati, </EM>v. 42). In both directions from
these are two pole-stars (<EM>dhruvatara</EM>), fixed in the midst
of the sky; [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

Mercator's Projection, on our side, it may have included, on the
American side, the localities that are now occupied by Baffin's
Bay and the neighbouring islands and promontories.<EM> There</EM>
it hardly reached, southward, the 70th degree of latitude; <EM>here
-</EM>- it formed the horse-shoe continent of which the commentary
speaks; of the two ends of which, one included Greenland with
a prolongation which crossed the 50th degree a little south west,
and the other Kamschatka, the two ends being united by what is
now the northern fringe of the coasts of Eastern and Western Siberia.
This broke asunder and disappeared. In the early part of the Third
Race -- Lemuria was formed (<EM>Vide supra</EM>).<EM> </EM>When
it was destroyed in its turn, Atlantis appeared.<A NAME="DDE_LINK19"></A>

[[Footnote continued from previous page]] to those <EM>who are
situated in places of no latitude </EM>(niraksha) both these have
their place in the horizon. Hence there is (on that land) no elevation
of the poles, the two pole-stars being situated in their horizon;
but their degrees of colatitude (<EM>lumbaka</EM>) are 90; at
Meru the degrees of latitude (<EM>aksha</EM>)<EM> </EM>are of
the same number.&quot; (43 <EM>and </EM>44.)<HR>
