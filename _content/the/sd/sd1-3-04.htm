<H4>IV.<BR>
IS GRAVITATION A LAW?</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE corpuscular theory has been unceremoniously
put aside; but gravitation -- the principle that all bodies attract
each other with a force proportional directly to their masses,
and inversely to the squares of the distances between them --
survives to this day and reigns, supreme as ever, in the alleged
ethereal waves of Space. As a hypothesis, it had been threatened
with death for its inadequacy to embrace all the facts presented
to it; as a <EM>physical law</EM>,<EM> </EM>it is the King of
the late and once all-potent &quot;Imponderables.&quot; &quot;It
is little short of blasphemy . . . . an insult to Newton's grand
memory to doubt it, . . . .&quot; is the exclamation of an American
reviewer of &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled.</EM>&quot; Well; what is
finally that <EM>invisible and intangible </EM>God in whom we
should believe on blind faith? Astronomers who see in gravitation
an easy-going solution for many things, and an <EM>universal </EM>force
which allows them to calculate thereby planetary motions, care
little about the Cause of Attraction. They call Gravity a law,
a <EM>cause </EM>in itself. We call the forces acting under that
name <EM>effects</EM>,<EM> </EM>and very secondary effects, too.
One day it will be found that the scientific hypothesis does not
answer after all; and then it will follow the corpuscular theory
of light and be consigned to rest for many scientific <EM>aeons
</EM>in the archives of all exploded speculations. Has not Newton
himself expressed grave doubts about the Nature of Force and the
corporeality of the &quot;Agents,&quot; as they were then called?
So has Cuvier, another scientific light shining in the night of
research. He warns his readers, in the <EM>Revolution du Globe</EM>,<EM>
</EM>about the doubtful nature of the so-called Forces, saying
that &quot;it is not so sure whether those agents were not <EM>Spiritual
Powers </EM>after all (<EM>des agents spirituels</EM>)<EM>. At
</EM>the outset of his &quot;Principia,&quot; Sir Isaac Newton
took the greatest care to impress upon his school that he did
not use the word &quot;attraction&quot; with regard to the mutual
action of bodies in a physical sense. To him it was, he said,
a purely mathematical conception involving no consideration of
real and primary physical causes. In one of the passages of his
&quot;Principia&quot; (<EM>Defin</EM>. 8,<EM> B. I. Prop. </EM>69,<EM>
</EM>&quot;<EM>Scholium</EM>&quot;),<EM> </EM>he tells us plainly
that, physically considered, attractions are rather <EM>impulses.
</EM>In section XI. (<EM>Introduction</EM>)<EM> </EM>he expresses
the opinion that &quot;there <EM>is some subtle spirit by the
force and action of which </EM>all movements of matter are determined&quot;
(see<EM> Mod. Mater.</EM>,<EM> by Rev. W. F. Wilkinson</EM>)<EM>;
</EM>and in his third Letter to Bentley he says: &quot;It is inconceivable
that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something
else <EM>which is not material</EM>,<EM> </EM>operate upon and
affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if
gravi- <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 491 GRAVITY OR WHAT?</H6>

<P>
tation, in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and inherent in
it. . . . That gravity should be innate, inherent and essential
to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance,
through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else by and
through which their action may be conveyed from one to another,
is to me so great an absurdity that I believe no man, who has
in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking, can
ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly
according to certain laws; but <EM>whether this agent </EM>be
<EM>material or immaterial </EM>I have left to the consideration
of my readers.&quot;
<P>
At this, even Newton's contemporaries got frightened -- at the
apparent return of <EM>occult </EM>causes into the domain of physics.
Leibnitz called his principle of attraction &quot;an incorporeal
and inexplicable power.&quot; The supposition of an attractive
faculty and a perfect <EM>void </EM>was characterized by Bernoulli
as &quot;revolting,&quot; the principle of <EM>actio in distans
</EM>finding thus no more favour then than it does now. Euler,
on the other hand, thought the action of gravity was due to either
a <EM>Spirit </EM>or some subtle medium. And yet Newton knew of,
if he did not accept, the Ether of the Ancients. He regarded the
intermediate space between the sidereal bodies as <EM>vacuum.
</EM>Therefore he believed in &quot;subtle spirit&quot; and <EM>Spirits
</EM>as we do, guiding the so-called attraction. The above-quoted
words of the great man have produced poor results. The &quot;absurdity&quot;
has now become a dogma in the case of pure materialism, which
repeats, &quot;No matter without force, no force without matter;
matter and force are inseparable, eternal and indestructible (true);
there can be no independent force, since all force is <EM>an inherent
and necessary property of matter </EM>(<EM>false</EM>)<EM>; </EM>consequently,
<EM>there is no immaterial </EM>creative power.&quot; Oh, poor
Sir Isaac!
<P>
If, leaving aside all the other eminent men of Science who shared
in the same opinion as Euler and Leibnitz, the Occultists claim
as their authorities and supporters only Sir Isaac Newton and
Cuvier, as above cited, they need fear little from modern Science,
and may loudly and proudly proclaim their beliefs. But, the hesitation
and doubts of the two before cited authorities, and of many others,
too, whom we could name, did not in the least prevent scientific
speculation from wool-gathering on the fields of brute matter
just as before. First it was matter and an imponderable fluid
distinct from it; then came the <EM>imponderable </EM>fluid so
much criticised by Grove; and AEther, which was at first<EM> discontinuous
</EM>and then became continuous; after which came the &quot;mechanical&quot;
Forces. These have now settled in life as &quot;modes of motion&quot;
and the aether has become more mysterious and problematical than
ever. More than one man of Science objects to such crude materialistic
views. But then since the days of Plato, who repeatedly asks his
readers not to confuse <EM>incorporeal </EM>Elements with<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 492 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
their <STRONG>P</STRONG>RINCIPLES -- transcendental or spiritual
Elements; from those of the great Alchemists, who, like Paracelsus,
made a great difference between phenomenon and its cause, or the
Noumenon; and Grove, who, though he sees &quot;no reason to divest
universally diffused matter of the <EM>functions </EM>common to
all matter,&quot; yet uses the term <EM>Forces </EM>where his
critics, &quot;who do not attach to the word any idea of a <EM>specific
action</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>say Force -- from those days to this
nothing has proved competent to stem the tide of brutal materialism.
Gravitation <EM>is the sole cause</EM>,<EM> </EM>the acting God,
and matter is its prophet, said the men of science only a few
years ago.
<P>
They have changed their views several times since then. But do
the men of Science understand the innermost thought of Newton,
one of the most spiritual-minded and religious men of his day,
any better now than they did then? It is certainly to be doubted.
Newton is credited with having given the death-blow to the Elemental
Vortices of Descartes (the idea of Anaxagoras, resurrected, by-the-bye),
though the last modern &quot;vortical atoms&quot; of Sir W. Thomson
do not, in truth, differ much from the former. Nevertheless, when
his disciple Forbes wrote in the <EM>Preface </EM>to the chief
work of his Master a sentence declaring that &quot;attraction
was the <EM>cause </EM>of the System,&quot; Newton was the first
to solemnly protest. That which in the mind of the great mathematician
assumed the shadowy, but firmly rooted image of God, as the <EM>noumenon
</EM>of all,* was called more philosophically by the ancient (and
modern) philosophers and Occultists -- &quot;Gods,&quot; or the
<EM>creative </EM>fashioning Powers. The modes of expression may
have been different, and the ideas more or less philosophically
enunciated by all sacred and profane Antiquity; but the fundamental
thought was the same.** For Pythagoras the Forces were Spiritual
Entities, Gods inde-
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* &quot;<EM>Attraction</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>Le Couturier, a materialist,
writes, &quot;has now become for the public that which it was
for Newton himself -- a simple word, an <EM>idea</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Panorama des Mondes</EM>),<EM> </EM>since its cause
is unknown. Herschell virtually says the same, when remarking,
that whenever studying the motion of the heavenly bodies, and
the phenomena of attraction, he feels penetrated at every moment
with the idea of &quot;the <EM>existence of causes </EM>that act
for us under a veil, disguising <EM>their direct </EM>action<EM>.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Musee des Sciences</EM>,<EM> </EM>August, 1856.)
<P>
** If we are taken to task for believing in operating &quot;Gods&quot;
and &quot;Spirits&quot; while rejecting a <EM>personal God</EM>,<EM>
</EM>we answer to the Theists and Monotheists: &quot;Admit that
your Jehovah is <EM>one of the Elohim</EM>,<EM> </EM>and we are
ready to recognise him. Make of him, as you do, the Infinite,
the ONE and the <EM>Eternal </EM>God, and we will never accept
him in this character.&quot; Of <EM>tribal </EM>Gods there were
many; the One Universal Deity is a principle, an abstract Root-Idea
which has nought to do with the unclean work of finite Form. We
do not worship the Gods, we only honour Them, as beings superior
to ourselves. In this we obey the Mosaic injunction, while Christians
<EM>disobey </EM>their Bible -- Missionaries foremost of all.
&quot;<EM>Thou shalt not revile the gods</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>says
one of them -- (Jehovah) -- in <EM>Exodus xxii.</EM> 28); but
at the same time in verse 20 it is commanded, &quot;He that sacrificeth
to any God, save unto the Lord, he shall be utterly destroyed.&quot;
Now in the [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 493 THE TRIPLE SIDEREAL FORCE.</H6>

<P>
pendent of planets and Matter as we see and know them on Earth,
who are the rulers of the Sidereal Heaven. Plato represented the
planets as moved by an <EM>intrinsic </EM>Rector, one with his
dwelling, like &quot;A boatman in his boat.&quot; As for Aristotle,
he called those rulers &quot;<EM>immaterial </EM>substances;&quot;*
though as one who had never been initiated, he rejected the gods
as <EM>Entities </EM>(<EM>See Vossius</EM>,<EM> Vol. II.</EM>,<EM>
p. </EM>528). But this did not prevent him from recognising the
fact that the stars and planets &quot;were not inanimate masses
but <EM>acting and </EM><I>living </I>bodies indeed. . . . . .
.&quot; As if &quot;<EM>sidereal spirits were the divine </EM>portion
of their phenomena, [[<EM>ta theoitera pon phaneron</EM>]]&quot;
(<EM>De Caelo. I. </EM>9).
<P>
If we look for corroboration in more modern and Scientific times,
we find Tycho Brahe recognising in the stars a triple force, <EM>divine</EM>,<EM>
spiritual and vital. </EM>Kepler, putting together the Pythagorean
sentence, &quot;The Sun, guardian of Jupiter,&quot; and the verses
of David, &quot;He placed his throne in the Sun,&quot; and &quot;The
Lord is the Sun,&quot; etc., said that he understood perfectly
how the Pythagoreans could believe that all the globes disseminated
through Space were rational Intelligences, <EM>facultates ratiocinativae</EM>,<EM>
</EM>circulating around the Sun, &quot;in which resides <EM>a
pure Spirit of fire; </EM>the source of the general harmony&quot;
(<EM>De Motibus planetarum harmonicis</EM>,<EM> p. </EM>248).
<P>
When an Occultist speaks of Fohat -- the energising and guiding
intelligence in the Universal Electric or <EM>Vital </EM>Fluid,
-- he is laughed at. Withal, as now shown, neither the nature
of electricity, nor of Life nor even of Light, are to this day
understood. The Occultist sees in the manifestation of every force
in Nature, the action of the quality, or the special characteristic
of its noumenon; which <EM>noumenon </EM>is a distinct and intelligent
Individuality <EM>on the other side of the manifested mechanical
Universe. </EM>Now the Occultist does not deny -- on the contrary
he will support the claim -- that light, heat, electricity and
so on are <EM>affections </EM>(not properties or qualities) of
matter. To put it more clearly: matter is the condition -- the
necessary basis or vehicle, a <EM>sine qua non</EM> --<EM> </EM>for
the manifestation of these forces, or agents, on this plane.
<P>
But in order to gain the point the Occultists have to examine
the credentials of the law of gravity, first of all, of &quot;Gravitation,
the King

[[Footnote continued from previous page]] <EM>original texts </EM>it
is not &quot;god&quot; but <EM>Elohim</EM>, --<EM> </EM>and we
challenge contradiction -- and Jehovah is one of the Elohim, as
proved by his own words in <EM>Genesis iii.</EM> 22, when &quot;the
Lord God said: Behold the Man has become <EM>as one of us</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>etc. Hence both those who worship and sacrifice to the <EM>Elohim</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the angels, and to Jehovah, those who <EM>revile the gods
</EM>of their fellow-men, are far greater transgressors than the
Occultists or any Theosophist. Meanwhile many of the latter prefer
believing in some one &quot;Lord&quot; or other, and are quite
welcome to do as they like.

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 494 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
and Ruler of Matter,&quot; under every form. To do so effectually,
the hypothesis in its earliest appearance has to be recalled to
mind. To begin with, is it Newton who was the first to discover
it? The <EM>Athenaeum </EM>of Jan. 26, 1867, has some curious
information upon this subject. It says that &quot;positive evidence
can be adduced that Newton derived all his knowledge of gravitation
and its laws from Boehme, <EM>with whom gravitation or </EM>ATTRACTION
is the first property of Nature.&quot; . . . For with him &quot;his
(Boehme's) system, shows us the <EM>inside </EM>of things, while
modern physical science is content with looking at the outside.&quot;
Then again, &quot;the science of electricity, which was not yet
in existence when he (Boehme) wrote, is there anticipated (in
his writings); and not only does Boehme describe all the now known
phenomena of that force, but he even gives us the origin, generation,
and birth of electricity, itself, etc.&quot;
<P>
Thus Newton, whose profound mind read easily between the lines,
and fathomed the spiritual thought of the great Seer in its mystic
rendering, owes his great discovery to Jacob Boehme, the nursling
of the genii (Nirmanakayas) who watched over and guided him, of
whom the author of the article in question so truly remarks, that
&quot;every new scientific discovery goes to prove <EM>his profound
and intuitive insight into the most secret workings of nature.</EM>&quot;
And having <EM>discovered </EM>gravity, Newton, in order to render
possible the action of attraction in space, had, so to speak,
to <EM>annihilate </EM>every physical obstacle capable of impeding
its free action; ether among others, though he had more than a
presentiment of its existence. Advocating the corpuscular theory,
he made an <EM>absolute vacuum </EM>between the heavenly bodies.
. . . Whatever may have been his suspicions and <EM>inner </EM>convictions
about Ether; however many friends he may have unbosomed himself
to -- as in the case of his correspondence with Bentley -- his
teachings never showed that he had any such belief. If he <I>was
</I>&quot;persuaded that the power of attraction could not be
exerted by matter across a vacuum,&quot;* how is it that so late
as 1860, French astronomers (Le Couturier, for instance), combated
&quot;the <EM>disastrous </EM>results of the theory of vacuum
established by the great man?&quot;** Professor Winchell writes,
&quot;These passages (letter to Bentley) show what were his views
respecting the nature of the interplanetary medium of communication.
Though declaring that the heavens '<EM>are void of sensible matter</EM>,'<EM>
</EM>he elsewhere excepted '<EM>perhaps</EM>

<P>
This only shows that even such great men as Newton have not always
the courage of their opinions. Dr. T. S. Hunt &quot;called attention
to some long-neglected passages in Newton's works, from which
it appears that a belief in such universal, intercosmical medium
gradually took root in his mind.&quot; (<EM>Ibid.</EM>)<EM> </EM>But
such attention was never called to the said passages before Nov.
28, 1881, when Dr. Hunt read his &quot;<EM>Celestial Chemistry</EM>,<EM>
from the time of Newton.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>&quot;Till then the
idea was universal, even among the men of Science, that Newton
had, while advocating the corpuscular theory, preached <EM>a void</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>as Le Couturier says. The passages had been &quot;long neglected,&quot;
no doubt because they contradicted and clashed with the preconceived
pet theories of the day, till finally the undulatory theory imperiously
required the presence of an &quot;ethereal medium&quot; to explain
it. This is the whole secret.
<P>
Anyhow, it is from that theory of Newton's of a universal void
-- <EM>taught</EM>,<EM> </EM>if not believed in by himself, --
that dates the immense scorn now shown by modern for ancient physics.
The old sages had maintained that &quot;Nature abhorred vacuum,&quot;
and the greatest mathematicians of the world (read of the Western
races) had discovered the antiquated &quot;fallacy&quot; and exposed
it. And now modern science vindicates, however ungracefully, archaic
knowledge, having, moreover, to vindicate Newton's character and
powers of observation at this late hour, after having neglected
for one century and a half to pay any attention to such very important
passages -- perchance, because it was wiser not to attract any
notice to them. Better late than never.
<P>
And now Father AEther is <EM>re-welcomed </EM>with open arms;
and wedded to gravitation; linked to it for weal or woe, until
the day when it, or both, shall be replaced by something else.
Three hundred years ago it was<EM> plenum </EM>everywhere, then
it became one dismal <EM>vacuity; </EM>later still the sidereal
ocean-beds, dried up by science, rolled onward once more their
ethereal waves. <EM>Recede ut procedes </EM>must become the motto
of exact Science -- &quot;exact,&quot; chiefly, in finding itself
inexact every leap-year.
<P>
But we will not quarrel with the great men. They had to go back
to the earliest &quot;Gods of Pythagoras and old Kanada&quot;
for the very backbone and marrow of their correlations and &quot;newest&quot;
discoveries, and this may well afford good hope to the Occultists,
for their minor gods. For we believe in Le Couturier's prophecy
about gravitation. We know the day is approaching when an <EM>absolute
reform </EM>will be demanded in the present modes of Science by
the scientists themselves -- as was done by Sir W. Grove, <B>F.R.S</B>.
Till that day there is nothing to be done. For if gravitation
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 496 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
were dethroned to-morrow, the day after the Scientists would discover
some other new mode of mechanical motion.* Rough and up-hill is
the path of true Science, and its days are full of vexation of
Spirit. But in the face of its &quot;thousand&quot; contradictory
hypotheses to explain physical phenomena, there never was yet
a better one than that of &quot;motion&quot; -- however paradoxically
interpreted by materialism. As may be found on the first pages
of Book I., Occultists have nothing surely against <EM>motion</EM>**
the GREAT BREATH of Mr. Herbert Spencer's &quot;UNKNOWN.&quot;
But, believing that everything on Earth is the <EM>shadow </EM>of
something in <EM>space</EM> --<EM> </EM>they believe <EM>in smaller
</EM>&quot;Breaths,&quot; which, living, intelligent and independent
of all but Law, blow in every direction during Manvantaric periods.
These Science will reject. But whatever replaces attraction, <EM>alias</EM>
gravitation, the result will be the same. Science will be as far
from the solution of its difficulties as it is now, unless it
comes to some compromise with Occultism and even with Alchemy
-- which supposition will be regarded as an impertinence, but
remains a fact, nevertheless. As Faye says: &quot;<EM>Il manque
quelque chose aux geologues pour faire la geologie de la Lune</EM>,<EM>
c</EM>'<EM>est d</EM>'<EM>etre astronomes. A la verite il manque
aussi quelquechose aux astronomes pour aborder avec fruit cette
etude</EM>,<EM> c</EM>'<EM>est d</EM>'<EM>etre geologues.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>But he might have added, with still more pointedness, &quot;<EM>Ce
qui manque a tous les deux</EM>,<EM> c</EM>'<EM>est l</EM>'<EM>intuition
du mystique.</EM>&quot;
<P>
Let us remember Sir William Grove's wise &quot;concluding remarks,&quot;
on the ultimate structure of matter, or the minutiae of molecular
actions, which, he thought, man will never know.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Much harm has already been done by attempting hypothetically
to dissect matter and to discuss the shapes, sizes, and numbers
of atoms, and their atmospheres of heat, ether, or electricity.
. . . . Whether the regarding electricity, light, magnetism, etc.,
as simply motions of ordinary matter, be or be not admissible,
certain it is that all past theories have resolved, and all existing
theories do resolve, the action of these forces into motion. Whether
it be that, on account of our familiarity with motion, we refer
other affections to it, as to a language which is most easily
construed, and most capable of

</H6>

<P>
* When read in a fair and unprejudiced spirit, Sir Isaac Newton's
works are an ever ready witness to show how he must have hesitated
between gravitation and attraction, impulse and some other <EM>unknown
cause </EM>to explain the regular course of the planetary motion.
But see <EM>Treatise on Colour </EM>(Vol. III., question 31.)
We are told by Herschell that Newton left with his successors
the duty of drawing all the scientific conclusions from his discovery.
How modern Science abused the privilege of building its newest
theories upon the law of gravitation, may be realised when one
remembers how profoundly religious was that great man.
<P>
** The materialistic notion that because, in physics real or sensible
motion is impossible in pure space or <EM>vacuum</EM>, therefore,
the eternal MOTION of and in Cosmos (regarded as infinite Space)

as &quot;pure space,&quot; &quot;pure Being,&quot; &quot;the Absolute,&quot;
etc., of Eastern metaphysics have never been understood in the
West.<HR>

explaining them, or whether it be that it is in reality the only
mode in which <EM>our minds </EM>as<EM> contra-distinguished from
our senses</EM>,<EM> </EM>are able <EM>to conceive material agencies</EM>,<EM>
</EM>certain it is that since the period at which the mystic notions
of spiritual or preternatural powers were applied to account for
physical phenomena, all hypotheses framed to explain them have
resolved them into MOTION.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And then the learned gentleman states a purely occult tenet: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The term perpetual motion, which I have not infrequently
used in these pages, is itself equivocal. If the doctrines here
advanced be well founded, <I>all</I> <I>motion is</I>,<I> in one
sense</I>,<I> perpetual. </I>In masses, whose motion is stopped
by mutual concussion, heat or motion of the particles is generated;
and thus the motion continues, so that if we could venture to
extend such thoughts to the universe, we should assume the same
amount of motion affecting the same amount of matter for ever.&quot;*
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Thus, supposing attraction or gravitation should be given up in
favour of the Sun being a <EM>huge magnet </EM>-- which is a theory
already accepted by some physicists -- a magnet that acts on the
planets as attraction is now supposed to do, whereto, or how much
farther would it lead the astronomers from where they are now?
Not an inch farther. Kepler came to this &quot;curious hypothesis&quot;
nearly 300 years ago. He had not discovered the theory of attraction
and repulsion in Kosmos, for it was known from the days of Empedocles,
the two opposite forces being called by him &quot;hate&quot; and
&quot;love&quot; -- which comes to the same thing. But Kepler
gave a pretty fair description of cosmic magnetism. That such
magnetism exists in nature, is as certain as that gravitation
does not; not at any rate, in the way in which it is taught by
Science, which never took into consideration the different modes
in which the dual Force -- that Occultism calls attraction and
repulsion -- may act within our solar system, the earth's atmosphere,
and <EM>beyond </EM>in the Kosmos.** This was proven by Newton
himself; for there are many phenomena in our

This is precisely what Occultism maintains, and on the same principle
that &quot;where force is made to oppose force, and produce static
equilibrium, the balance of pre-existing equilibrium is affected,
and <EM>fresh motion is started </EM>equivalent to that which
is withdrawn into a state of abeyance.&quot; This process finds
intervals in the pralaya, but is eternal and ceaseless as <EM>the

</EM>True, that since 1860 the nebular theory has sprung up, and
being better known, a few identical phenomena were <EM>supposed
</EM>to be observed beyond the solar system. Yet the great man
is quite right; and no <EM>earths </EM>or<EM> moons </EM>can be
found -- <EM>except in appearance</EM> --<EM> </EM>beyond, or
of the same order of matter as found in our system. Such is the
Occult teaching.<HR>

Solar system, which he confessed his inability to explain by the
law of gravitation. &quot;Such were the uniformity in the directions
of planetary movements, the nearly circular forms of the orbits,
and their remarkable conformity to one plane&quot; (<EM>Prof.
Winchell</EM>)<EM>. </EM>And if there is one single exception,
then the law of gravitation has no right to be referred to as
an <EM>universal law. </EM>&quot;These adjustments,&quot; we are
told, &quot;Newton, in his general Scholium, pronounces to be
'the work of an intelligent and all-powerful Being.' &quot; Intelligent
that &quot;Being&quot; may be; as to &quot;all-powerful&quot;
there would be every reason to doubt the claim. A poor &quot;God&quot;
he, who would work upon minor details and leave the most important
to secondary forces! The poverty of the argument and logic in
this case, is surpassed only by that of Laplace, who, seeking
very correctly to substitute motion for Newton's &quot;all-powerful
Being,&quot; and ignorant of the true nature of that eternal motion,
saw in it a blind physical law. &quot;Might not those arrangements
be an effect of the laws of motion?&quot; he asks, forgetting,
as all our modern Scientists do, that this<I> law </I>and this
motion are a vicious circle, so long as the <EM>nature of both
</EM>remains unexplained. His famous answer to Napoleon: &quot;<EM>Dieu
est devenu une hypothese inutile</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>would be
correctly stated only by one who adhered to the philosophy of
the Vedantins. It becomes a pure fallacy, if we exclude the interference
of operating, intelligent, powerful (never &quot;<EM>all-powerful</EM>&quot;)<EM>
</EM>Beings, who are called &quot;gods.&quot;
<P>
But we would ask the critics of the mediaeval astronomers why
should Kepler be denounced as <EM>most unscientific</EM>,<EM>
</EM>for offering just the same solution as Newton did -- only
showing himself more sincere, more consistent and even more logical.
Where may be the difference between Newton's &quot;all-powerful
Being&quot; and Kepler's <EM>Rectores</EM>,<EM> </EM>his sidereal
and Cosmic Forces, or Angels? Kepler is again criticised for his
&quot;curious hypothesis which made use of a vortical movement
within the solar system;&quot; for his theories in general, for
his favouring Empedocles' idea of attraction and repulsion, and
&quot;Solar magnetism&quot; in particular. Yet several modern
men of Science, as will be shown -- Hunt (if Metcalfe is to be
excluded), Dr. Richardson, etc. -- favour the idea very seriously.
He is half excused, however, on the plea that &quot;to the time
of Kepler no interaction between masses of matter had been distinctly
recognized which was <EM>generically </EM>different from magnetism&quot;
(<EM>World-Life</EM>)<EM>.</EM> Is it<EM> distinctly</EM> recognised
now? Does Prof. Winchell claim for Science any serious knowledge
whatever of the natures of either electricity or magnetism --
except that <EM>both seem to be the effects of some result arising
from an undetermined cause.</EM> 
<P>
The ideas of Kepler, weeded from their theological tendencies,
are purely occult. He saw that:<HR>

<P>
(I.) The Sun is a great Magnet.* This is what some eminent modern
scientists and also the Occultists believe in.
<P>
(II.) The Solar substance is immaterial.** (<I>See</I> &quot;<EM>Isis
Unveiled</EM>,&quot;<EM> Vol. I.</EM> <EM>pp. </EM>270<EM> to
</EM>271.)
<P>
(III.) He provided, for the constant motion and restoration of
the Sun's energy and planetary motion, the perpetual care of a
spirit, or spirits. The whole of Antiquity believed in this idea.
The Occultists do not use the word Spirit, but say <EM>Creative
</EM>Forces, which they <EM>endow with intelligence. </EM>But
we may call them spirits also.
<P>
This theory is tabooed a great deal more on account of the &quot;Spirit&quot;
that is given room in it, than of anything else. Herschell, the
elder, believed in it likewise, and so do several modern scientists
also. Nevertheless Professor Winchell declares that &quot;a hypothesis
more fanciful, and less in accord with the requirements of physical
principles, has not been offered in ancient or modern times.&quot;
(<EM>World-Life</EM>,<EM> p. </EM>554.)
<P>
The same was said, once upon a time, of the universal Ether, and
now it is not only accepted perforce but advocated <EM>as the
only possible theory </EM>to explain away certain mysteries.
<P>
Grove's ideas, when he first enunciated them in London about 1840,
were called as <EM>unscientific </EM>as the above; nevertheless,
<I>his</I> views on the correlation of forces are now universally
accepted. It would, very likely, require one more conversant with
science than is the writer, to combat with any success some of
the now prevailing ideas about gravitation and other similar &quot;solutions&quot;
of Cosmic Mysteries. But, let us recall a few objections that
came from recognized men of Science; from astronomers and physicists
of eminence, who rejected the theory of rotation, as well as that
of gravitation. Thus one reads in the <EM>French Encyclopaedia
</EM>that<EM> </EM>&quot;Science agrees, in the face of all its
representatives, that it is <EM>impossible </EM>to explain the
<EM>physical </EM>origin of the rotatory motion of the solar system.&quot;
<P>
If the question is asked, &quot;what causes rotation?&quot; we
are answered: &quot;It is the centrifugal Force.&quot; &quot;And
this force, what is it that produces it?&quot; &quot;The force
of rotation,&quot; is the grave answer. (<EM>Godefroy</EM>,<EM>
Cosmogonie de la Revelation.***</EM>)<EM> </EM>It will be well,
perhaps, to examine both these theories as being directly or indirectly
connected.
