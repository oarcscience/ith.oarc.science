THE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF BRAHMA.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HIS is the name given to the Periods called
<STRONG>M</STRONG>ANVANTARA (<EM>Manuantara</EM>,<EM> </EM>or
between the Manus) and <STRONG>P</STRONG>RALAYA (Dissolution);
one referring to the active periods of the Universe, the other
to its times of relative and complete <EM>rest </EM>--<EM> </EM>according
to whether they occur at the end of a &quot;Day,&quot; or an &quot;Age&quot;
(a life) of Brahma. These periods, which follow each other in
regular succession, are also called <EM>Kalpas</EM>,<EM> </EM>small
and great, the minor and the <EM>Maha Kalpa; </EM>though, properly
speaking, the Maha Kalpa is never a &quot;day,&quot; but a whole
life or age of Brahma, for it is said in the Brahma Vaivarta:
&quot;Chronologers compute a Kalpa by the Life of Brahma; minor
Kalpas, as Samvarta and the rest, are numerous.&quot; In sober
truth they are infinite; as they have never had a commencement,
<EM>i.e.</EM>, there never was a <EM>first </EM>Kalpa, nor will
there ever be a <EM>last </EM>one, in Eternity.
<P>
One<EM> Parardha</EM> --<EM> </EM>in the ordinary acceptation
of this measure of time -- or half of the existence of Brahma
(in the present <EM>Maha Kalpa</EM>)<EM> </EM>has<EM> </EM>already
expired; the last Kalpa was the Padma, or that of the Golden Lotos;
the present one being <EM>Varaha* </EM>(the &quot;boar&quot; incarnation,
or <EM>Avatar</EM>)<EM>.</EM>

<P>
* There is a curious piece of information in the Buddhist esoteric
traditions. The exoteric or <EM>allegorical </EM>biography of
Gautama Buddha shows this great Sage dying of an indigestion of
<EM>pork and rice</EM>,<EM> </EM>a very prosaic end, indeed, having
little of the solemn element in it. This is explained as an allegorical
reference to his having been born in the &quot;Boar,&quot; or
Varaha-Kalpa when Brahma assumed the form of that animal to raise
the Earth out of the &quot;Waters of Space.&quot; And as the Brahmins
descend direct from Brahma and are, so to speak, identified with
him; and as they are at the same time the mortal enemies of Buddha
and Buddhism, we have the curious allegorical hint and combination.
Brahminism (of the Boar, or <EM>Varaha Kalpa</EM>)<EM> </EM>has
slaughtered the religion of Buddha in India, swept it away from
its face; therefore Buddha, identified with his philosophy, is
said to have died from the effects of eating of the flesh of a
wild hog. [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 369 HUMAN GODS AND DIVINE MEN.</H6>

<P>
By the scholar who studies the Hindu religion from the Puranas,
one thing is to be especially noted. He must not take literally,
and in one sense only, the statements therein found; since those
which especially concern the Manvantaras or Kalpas have to be
understood in their several references. So, for instance, these
periods relate in the same language to both the great and the
small periods, to Maha Kalpas and to minor Cycles. The <EM>Matsya</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or Fish Avatar, happened before the Varaha or Boar Avatar;
the allegories, therefore, must relate to both the<EM> Padma </EM>and
the present manvantara, and also to the minor cycles which took
place since the reappearance of our Chain of Worlds and Earth.
And, as the Matsya Avatar of Vishnu and Vaivasvata's Deluge are
correctly connected with an event that happened on our Earth during
this Round, it is evident that while it may relate to pre-cosmic
events (in the sense of <EM>our </EM>Kosmos or Solar system) it
has reference in our case to a distant geological period. Not
even Esoteric philosophy can claim to know, except by analogical
inference, that which took place before the reappearance of our
Solar System and previous to the last <EM>Maha Pralaya. </EM>But
it teaches distinctly that after the first geological disturbance
in the Earth's axis which ended in the sweeping down to the bottom
of the Seas of the whole second Continent, with its primeval races
-- of which successive &quot;Earths&quot; or Continents Atlantis
was the fourth -- there came another disturbance by the axis resuming
as rapidly its previous degree of inclination; when the Earth
was indeed <EM>raised once more </EM>out of the Waters, and --
as above so it is below; and <EM>vice versa. </EM>There were &quot;gods&quot;
on Earth in those days -- gods, and not men, as we know them now,
says the tradition. As will be shown in Book II., the computation
of periods in exoteric Hinduism refers to both the great cosmic
and the small terrestrial events and cataclysms, and the same
may be shown for names. For instance Yudishthira -- the first
King of the <EM>Sacea</EM>,<EM> </EM>who opens the Kali Yuga era,
which has to last 432,000 years -- &quot;an actual King and man
who lived 3,102 years B.C.,&quot; applies also, name and all,
to the great Deluge at the time of the first sinking of Atlantis.
He is the &quot;Yudishthira* born on the mountain of the hundred
peaks at the extremity of
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] The idea alone of one
who established the most rigorous vegetarianism and respect for
animal life -- even to refusing to eat eggs as <EM>vehicles of
a latent future life </EM>--<EM> </EM>dying of a meat indigestion,
is absurdly contradictory and has puzzled more than one Orientalist.
But this explanation, unveiling the allegory, explains all the
rest. The <EM>Varaha</EM>,<EM> </EM>however, is no simple boar,
and seems to have meant at first some antediluvian lacustrine
animal &quot;delighting to sport in water.&quot; (<EM>Vayu Purana.</EM>)

* According to Colonel Wilford, the conclusion of the &quot;Great
War&quot; was B.C. 1370. (<EM>See A. R.</EM>,<EM> Vol.</EM>9,<EM>

that before the end of this century, the Mahabharatean epics will
be found and proclaimed identical with the wars of the great Napoleon.

&quot;immediately after the flood.&quot; (<EM>See Royal Asiat.
Soc.</EM>,<EM> Vol. </EM>9,<EM> p</EM>. 364.) We know of no &quot;Flood&quot;
3,102 years B.C. -- not even that of Noah, for, agreeably with
Judaeo-Christian chronology, it took place 2,349 years B.C.
<P>
This relates to an esoteric division of time and a mystery explained
elsewhere, and may therefore be left aside for the present. Suffice
to remark at this juncture that all the efforts of imagination
of the Wilfords, Bentleys, and other would-be OEdipuses of esoteric
Hindu Chronology have sadly failed. No computation of either the
Four Ages, or the Manvantaras, has ever been unriddled by our
very learned Orientalists, who have therefore cut the Gordian
Knot by proclaiming the whole &quot;a figment of the Brahmanical
brain.&quot; So be it, and may the great scholars rest in peace.
This &quot;figment&quot; is given in the Preliminary Sections
which preface <EM>Anthropogenesis </EM>in Book II., and with esoteric
additions.
<P>
Let us see, however, what were the three kinds of <EM>pralayas</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and what is the <EM>popular </EM>belief about them. For once
it agrees with Esotericism.
<P>
Of the <EM>pralaya </EM>before which fourteen Manvantaras elapse,
having over them as many presiding Manus, and at whose close occurs
the &quot;incidental&quot; or Brahma's dissolution, it is said
in <EM>Vishnu Purana</EM>,<EM> </EM>in condensed form, that &quot;at
the end of a thousand periods of four ages, which complete a day
of Brahma, the earth is almost exhausted. The eternal <EM>Avyaya
</EM>(Vishnu) assumes then the character of Rudra (the destroyer,
Siva) and re-unites all his creatures to himself. He enters the
Seven rays of the Sun and drinks up all the waters of the globe;
he causes the moisture to evaporate, thus drying up the whole
Earth. Oceans and rivers, torrents and small streams, are all
exhaled. Thus fed with abundant moisture the seven solar rays
become sevens suns by dilation, and they finally set the world
on fire. Hari, the destroyer of all things, who is 'the flame
of time, <EM>Kalagni</EM>,'<EM> </EM>finally consumes the Earth.
Then Rudra, becoming Janardana, breathes clouds and rain.&quot;
<P>
There are many kinds of <EM>Pralaya</EM>,<EM> </EM>but three chief
ones are specially mentioned in old Hindu books; and of these,
as Wilson shows: -- The first is called <STRONG>N</STRONG>AIMITTIKA*
&quot;occasional&quot; or &quot;incidental,&quot; caused by the
intervals of &quot;Brahma's Days;&quot; it is the destruction
of creatures, of all that lives and has a form, but not of the
substance which remains in <EM>statu quo </EM>till the new DAWN
in that &quot;Night.&quot; The
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* In the <EM>Vedanta </EM>and<EM> Nyaya</EM> &quot;nimitta&quot;
(from which &quot;Naimittika&quot;) is rendered as the <EM>efficient
</EM>cause, when antithesized with <EM>upadana </EM>the physical
or material cause. In the Sankhya <EM>pradhana </EM>is a cause
inferior to Brahma, or rather Brahma being himself a cause, is
superior to Pradhana. Hence &quot;incidental&quot; is wrongly
translated, and ought to be translated, as shown by some scholars,
&quot;Ideal&quot; cause, and even <EM>real </EM>cause would have
been better.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 371 THE RE-BIRTH OF GODS.</H6>

<P>
other is called <STRONG>P</STRONG>RAKRITIKA -- and occurs at the
end of the <EM>Age </EM>or Life of Brahma, when everything that
exists is resolved into the primal element, to be remodelled at
the end of that longer night. But the third, <EM>Atyantika</EM>,<EM>
</EM>does not concern the Worlds or the Universe, but only the
individualities of some people; it is thus individual pralaya
or NIRVANA; after having reached which, there is no more future
existence possible, no rebirth till after the <EM>Maha Pralaya.
</EM>The latter night, lasting as it does 311,040,000,000,000
years, and having the possibility of being almost doubled in case
the lucky <EM>Jivanmukti </EM>reaches Nirvana at an early period
of a Manvantara, is long enough to be regarded as <EM>eternal</EM>,<EM>
</EM>if not endless. The <EM>Bhagavata </EM>(<B>XII</B>., iv,
35) speaks of a fourth kind of pralaya, the <EM>Nitya </EM>or
constant dissolution, and explains it as the change which takes
place imperceptibly in everything in this Universe from the globe
down to the atom -- without cessation. It is growth and decay
(life and death).
<P>
When the Maha Pralaya arrives, the inhabitants of Swar-loka (the
upper sphere) disturbed by the conflagration, seek refuge &quot;with
the Pitris, their progenitors, the Manus, the Seven Rishis, the
various orders of celestial Spirits and the Gods, in Maharloka.&quot;
When the latter is reached also, the whole of the above enumerated
beings migrate in their turn from Maharloka, and repair to Jana-loka
in &quot;<EM>their subtile forms</EM>,<EM> destined to become
re</EM>-<EM>embodied</EM>,<EM> in similar capacities as their
former</EM>,<EM> when the world is renewed at the beginning of
the succeeding Kalpa</EM>;&quot;<EM> </EM>(Vayu Purana).
<P>
&quot; . . . . These clouds, mighty in size, and loud in thunder,
fill up all space (Nabhas-tala),&quot; goes on Vishnu Purana.
-- (Book VI., ch. iii.) &quot;Showering down torrents of water,
these clouds quench the dreadful fires, and then they rain uninterruptedly
for a hundred (divine) years, and deluge the whole world (Solar
System). Pouring down, in drops as large as dice, these rains
overspread the earth, and fill the middle region (<EM>Bhuvaloka</EM>)<EM>
</EM>and inundate heaven. The world is now enveloped in darkness,
and all things animate, or inanimate, having perished, the clouds
continue to pour down their waters&quot; . . . &quot;and the Night
of Brahma reigns supreme over the scene of desolation . . . .
.&quot;
<P>
This is what we call in the Esoteric Doctrine a &quot;Solar Pralaya&quot;
. . . When the waters have reached the region of the Seven Rishis,
and the world (our Solar System) is one ocean, they stop. The
breath of Vishnu becomes a strong wind, which blows for another
hundred (divine) years until all clouds are dispersed. The wind
is then reabsorbed: and &quot;<STRONG>T</STRONG>HAT, of which
all things are made, the Lord by whom all things exist, He who
is inconceivable, without beginning, the beginning of the universe,
reposes, sleeping upon Sesha (the Serpent of Infinity) in the
midst of the deep. The <EM>Adikrit</EM> <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 372 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
(Creator?) <EM>Hari</EM>,<EM> </EM>sleeps upon the ocean of Space
in the form of Brahma -- glorified by Sanaka* and the <EM>Siddha
</EM>(Saints) of Jana-loka, and contemplated by the holy denizens
of Brahma-loka, anxious for final liberation, involved in mystic
slumber, the celestial personification of his own illusions. .
. .&quot; This is the <EM>Pratisanchara </EM>(dissolution?) termed
incidental because <EM>Hari </EM>is its incidental (ideal) Cause.
. . . .** When the Universal Spirit wakes, the world revives;
when he closes his eyes, all things fall upon the bed of mystic
slumber. In like manner, as 1,000 great ages constitute a Day
of Brahma (in the original it is Padma-yoni, the same as<EM> Abjayoni
</EM>--<EM> </EM>&quot;lotos-born,&quot; not Brahma), so his Night
consists of the same period. &quot;Awaking at the end of his night,
the unborn . . . creates the Universe anew. . . <EM>.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Vishnu Purana.</EM>)
<P>
This is &quot;incidental&quot; pralaya; what is the Elemental
Dissolution? &quot;When by dearth and fire,&quot; says Parasara
to Maitreya, &quot;all the worlds and Patalas (hells) are withered
up . . .*** the progress of elemental dissolution is begun. Then,
first the waters swallow up the property of Earth (which is the
rudiment of smell), and earth deprived of this property proceeds
to destruction -- and becomes one with water . . . . when the
Universe is thus pervaded by the waves of the watery Element,
its rudimentary flavour is locked up by the elements of fire .
. . on account of which the waters themselves are destroyed .
. . and become one with fire; and the Universe is therefore, entirely
filled with flame (ethereal) which gradually overspreads the whole
world. While Space is one flame, the element of wind seizes upon
the rudimental property or form, which is the cause of light,
and that being withdrawn (<EM>pralina</EM>)<EM> </EM>all becomes
of the nature of air. The rudiment of form being destroyed, and
<EM>Vibhavasu </EM>(fire?) deprived of its rudiment, air extinguishes
fire and spreads over space, which is deprived of light when fire
merges into air. Air, then, accompanied by sound, which is the
source of Ether, extends everywhere throughout the ten regions
. . . . until Ether seizes upon cohesion (<EM>Sparsa </EM>--<EM>
</EM>Touch?) its rudimental property, by the loss of which, air
is destroyed, and KHA remains unmodified; devoid of form, flavour,
touch (<EM>Sparsa</EM>),<EM> </EM>and smell, it exists, embodied
(<EM>murttimat</EM>)<EM> </EM>and vast, and pervades the whole
Space. Akasa, whose characteristic property and rudiment is sound
(the &quot;Word&quot;), occupies the whole containment of Space.
Then the origin (Noumenon?) of the Elements (<EM>Bhutadi</EM>),<EM>
</EM>devours sound (collective <EM>Demiurgos</EM>);<EM> </EM>and
the hosts of Dhyan Chohans, and all the existing

<P>
Elements* are at once merged into their original. The primary
Element, Consciousness, combined with <EM>tamasa </EM>(spiritual
darkness) is itself disintegrated by MAHAT (the Universal Intellect),
whose characteristic property is <EM>Buddhi</EM>,<EM> </EM>and
earth and Mahat are the inner and outer boundaries of the Universe.&quot;
Thus as (in the beginning) &quot;were the seven forms of Prakriti
(nature) reckoned from Mahat to earth, so <EM>these seven </EM>successively
re-enter into each other.&quot;**
<P>
&quot;The Egg of Brahma (<EM>Sarva</EM>-<EM>mandala</EM>)<EM>
</EM>is dissolved in the waters that surround it, with its seven
zones (<EM>dwipas</EM>)<EM> </EM>seven oceans, seven regions,
and their mountains; the investure of water is drunk by the fire;
the (<EM>stratum </EM>of) fire is absorbed by (that of) air; air
blends itself with ether (Akasa); the <EM>Bhutadi </EM>(the origin,
or rather the <EM>cause</EM>,<EM> </EM>of the primary element)
devours the ether and is (itself) destroyed by Mahat (the Great,
the Universal mind), which along with all these is seized upon
by Prakriti and disappears. The Prakriti is essentially the same,
whether discrete or indiscrete; only that which is discrete is
finally absorbed by and lost in the indiscrete. <STRONG>P</STRONG>UMS
(<EM>Spirit</EM>)<EM> </EM>also, which is one, pure, imperishable,
eternal, all-pervading, is a portion of that Supreme spirit which
is all things. That Spirit (<EM>Sarvesa</EM>)<EM> </EM>which is
other than (embodied) Spirit, and in which there are no attributes
of name, species (<EM>naman </EM>and<EM> jati</EM>,<EM> or rupa</EM>,<EM>
</EM>hence body rather than species), or the like -- remains as
the sole existence (<STRONG>S</STRONG>ATTA). . . Prakriti and
Purusha both resolving finally into <STRONG>S</STRONG>UPREME <STRONG>S</STRONG>PIRIT.
. . .&quot; (<EM>From Vishnu Purana</EM>,<EM> </EM>Wilson's mistakes
being here corrected, and original words put in brackets).
<P>
This is the final <STRONG>P</STRONG>RALAYA*** -- the Death of
Kosmos -- after which its Spirit rests in Nirvana, or in <STRONG>T</STRONG>HAT
for which there is neither Day nor Night. All the other pralayas
are periodical and follow, in regular succession, the Manvantaras,
as the night follows the day of every human creature, animal,
and plant. The cycle of creation of the <EM>lives </EM>of Kosmos
is run down, the energy of the manifested &quot;Word&quot; having

</H6>

<P>
* The term &quot;Elements&quot; must be understood here to mean
not only the visible and physical Elements, but also that which
St. Paul calls Elements -- the spiritual, intelligent Potencies
-- Angels and Demons in their Manvantaric form.
<P>
** When this description is correctly understood by Orientalists
in its esoteric significance then it will be found that this Cosmic
correlation of World-Elements may explain the correlation of physical
forces better than those now known. At any rate, theosophists
will perceive that Prakriti has <EM>seven forms</EM>,<EM> </EM>or
principles, &quot;reckoned from Mahat to Earth.&quot; The &quot;Waters&quot;
mean here the Mystic &quot;mother&quot;; the Womb of abstract
nature, in which the manifested Universe is conceived. The Seven
&quot;zones&quot; have reference to the Seven Divisions of that
Universe, or the Noumena of the Forces that bring it into being.
It is all allegorical.
<P>
*** As it is the <EM>Maha</EM>,<EM> </EM>the Great, or so-called
final <STRONG>P</STRONG>RALAYA which is here described, every
thing is re-absorbed into its original ONE Element -- the &quot;Gods
themselves, Brahma and the rest&quot; being said to die and disappear
during that long NIGHT.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 374 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
its growth, culmination, and decrease, as have all things temporary,
however long their duration. The Creative Force is Eternal as
Noumenon; as a phenomenal manifestation in its aspects, it has
a <EM>beginning </EM>and must, therefore, have an end. During
that interval it has its periods of activity and its periods of
rest. And these are the &quot;Days and the nights of Brahma.&quot;
But Brahma, the Noumenon, never rests, as IT never changes and
ever IS, though IT cannot be said to be anywhere. . . . .
<P>
The Jewish Kabalists felt this necessity of <EM>immutability </EM>in
an eternal, infinite Deity, and therefore applied the same thought
to the anthropomorphic god. The idea is poetical and very appropriate
in its application. In the <EM>Zohar </EM>we read as follows:
--
<P>
&quot;As Moses was keeping a vigil on Mount Sinai, in company
with the deity, who was concealed from his sight by a cloud, he
felt a great fear overcome him, and suddenly asked: 'Lord, where
art thou . . . . sleepest thou, O Lord? . . .' And the <EM>Spirit
</EM>answered him: 'I never sleep: were I to fall asleep for a
moment BEFORE MY TIME, all the creation would crumble into dissolution
in one instant.' &quot;
<P>
&quot;<EM>Before my time</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>is very suggestive.
It shows the God of Moses to be only a temporary substitute, like
Brahma the male, a substitute and an aspect of THAT which is immutable,
and which therefore can take no part in the &quot;days,&quot;
or in the &quot;nights,&quot; nor have any concern whatever with
reaction or dissolution.
<P>
While the Eastern Occultists have seven modes of interpretation,
the Jews have only four -- namely, the real-mystical; the allegorical;
the moral; and the literal or <EM>Pashut. </EM>The latter is the
key of the exoteric Churches and not worth discussion. Read in
the first, or mystical key, here are several sentences which show
the identity of the foundations of construction in every Scripture.
It is given in Mr. T. Myer's excellent book on the Kabalistic
works he seems to have well studied. I quote <EM>verbatim. </EM>&quot;<EM>B</EM>'<EM>raisheeth
barah elohim ath hash ama yem v</EM>'<EM>ath haa</EM>'<EM>retz
</EM>--<EM> i.e.</EM>,<EM> </EM>'In the beginning the God(s) created
the heavens and the earth;&quot; (the meaning of which is:) the
six Sephiroth of Construction,* over which B'raisheeth stands,
<EM>all belong Below. </EM>It created six (and) on these stand
all Things. And those depend upon <EM>the seven forms of the Cranium
</EM>up to the Dignity of all Dignities. And the second 'Earth'
does not come into calculation, therefore it has been said: 'And
from it (that Earth) which underwent the curse, came it forth.'
. . . . 'It (the Earth) was without form and void; and darkness
was over the face of the Abyss, and the Spirit of elohim . . .
. was breathing (<EM>me</EM>'<EM> racha </EM>'<EM>phath</EM>)

(forms) of the most worthy Dignity. Six thousand years hang (are
referred to) in the first six words. The seventh (thousand, the
millennium) above it (the cursed Earth) is that which is strong
by Itself. And it was rendered entirely desolate during twelve
hours (one . . . . Day) as is written. . . . . In the thirteenth,

<P>
The &quot;Sephiroth of Construction&quot; are the six Dhyan Chohans,
or Manus, or Prajapati, synthesized by the seventh &quot;B'raisheeth
(the First Emanation or <EM>Logos</EM>),<EM> </EM>and who are
called, therefore, the Builders of the Lower or physical Universe&quot;
all belong Below. These <EM>six</EM> <IMG SRC="sd1-375.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
whose essence is <EM>of the Seventh </EM>--<EM> </EM>are the <EM>Upadhi</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the base or fundamental stone on which the objective Universe
is built, the <EM>noumenoi </EM>of all things. Hence they are,
at the same time, the Forces of nature, the Seven Angels of the
Presence, the sixth and seventh principles in man; the spirito-psycho-physical
spheres of the Septenary chain, the Root Races, etc., etc. They
all &quot;depend upon the Seven forms of the Cranium&quot; up
to the highest. The &quot;<EM>second </EM>Earth&quot; &quot;does
not come into calculation&quot; because it is <EM>no Earth</EM>,<EM>
</EM>but the Chaos or Abyss of Space in which rested the paradigmatic,
or model universe in ideation of the OVER-SOUL brooding over it.
The term &quot;Curse&quot; is here very misleading, for it means
simply <EM>doom </EM>or<EM> destiny</EM>,<EM> </EM>or<EM> that
fatality which sent it forth </EM>into the objective state. This
is shown by that &quot;Earth&quot; under the &quot;Curse&quot;
being described as &quot;without form and void,&quot; in whose
abysmal depths the &quot;Breath&quot; of the Elohim (collective
Logoi) produced or photographed the first divine <STRONG>I</STRONG>DEATION
<EM>of the things to be. </EM>This process is repeated after every
<EM>Pralaya </EM>before the beginnings of a new Manvantara, or
period of sentient individual being. &quot;Thirteen depend on
thirteen forms,&quot; refers to the thirteen periods personified
by the thirteen Manus, with Swayambhuva the fourteenth (13, instead
of 14, being an additional <EM>veil</EM>): those fourteen Manus
who reign within the term of a Mahayuga, a &quot;Day&quot; of
Brahma. These (thirteen-fourteen) of the objective Universe depend
on the thirteen (fourteen) <EM>paradigmatic</EM>,<EM> ideal </EM>forms.
The meaning of the &quot;Six thousand <EM>years</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>which &quot;hang in the first six words,&quot; has again
to be sought in the Indian Wisdom. They refer to the primordial
six (seven) &quot;Kings of Edom&quot; who typify the worlds (or
spheres) of our chain during the first Round, as well as the primordial
men of this Round. They are the septenary <EM>pre</EM>-<EM>Adamic
</EM>(or before the Third, <EM>Separated </EM>Race) first Root-race.
As they were <EM>shadows</EM>,<EM> </EM>and senseless (they had
not eaten yet of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge), they could
not see the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 376 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
<EM>Parguphim</EM>,<EM> </EM>or &quot;Face could not see Face&quot;
(primeval men were unconscious), &quot;therefore, the primordial
(seven) Kings died,&quot; <EM>i.e.</EM>, were destroyed (<EM>vide
Sepherah Djenioutha</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Now, who are they? They are
the Kings who are &quot;the Seven Rishis, certain (secondary)
divinities, Sakra (Indra), Manu, and the Kings his Sons, who <EM>are
created and perish at one period</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>as said
in Vishnu Purana (Book I. chap. iii.). For the seventh (&quot;thousand&quot;)
(<EM>not the millennium of exoteric Christianity</EM>,<EM> but
that of Anthropogenesis</EM>)<EM> </EM>represents both the &quot;seventh
period of creation,&quot; that of physical man (Vishnu Purana),
and the seventh Principle -- both macrocosmic and microcosmic,
-- as also the <EM>pralaya </EM>after the Seventh period, the
&quot;Night&quot; which has the same duration as the &quot;Day&quot;
of Brahma. &quot;It was rendered entirely desolate during twelve
hours, as is written.&quot; It is in the Thirteenth (twice six
and the Synthesis) that everything shall be restored &quot;and
the <EM>six </EM>will continue.&quot;
<P>
Thus the author of the <EM>Qabbalah </EM>remarks quite truly that
&quot;Long before his (Ibn Gebirol's) time . . . many centuries
before the Christian era, there was in Central Asia a 'Wisdom
Religion;' fragments of which subsequently existed among the learned
men of the archaic Egyptians, the ancient Chinese, Hindus, etc.
. . .&quot; and that . . . . . &quot;The Qabbalah most likely
originally came from Aryan sources, through Central Asia, Persia,
India and Mesopotamia, for from Ur and Haran came Abraham and
many others into Palestine&quot; (p. 221). And such was the firm
conviction of C. W. King, the author of &quot;The Gnostics and
their Remains.&quot;
<P>
Vamadeva Modelyar (<EM>Modely</EM>)<EM> </EM>describes the coming
&quot;night&quot; most poetically. Though it is given in <EM>Isis
Unveiled</EM>,<EM> </EM>it is worthy of repetition.
<P>
&quot;Strange noises are heard, proceeding from every point .
. . These are the precursors of the Night of Brahma; <EM>dusk
rises at the horizon</EM>,<EM> </EM>and the Sun passes away behind
the thirteenth degree of Macara (sign of the Zodiac), and will
reach no more the sign of the <EM>Minas </EM>(zodiacal <EM>pisces</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or fish). The gurus of the pagodas appointed to watch the
<EM>rasichakr </EM>(Zodiac), may now break their circle and instruments,
for they are henceforth useless.
<P>
&quot;Gradually light pales, heat diminishes, uninhabited spots
multiply on the earth, the air becomes more and more rarified;
the springs of waters dry up, the great rivers see their waves
exhausted, the ocean shows its sandy bottom and plants die. Men
and animals decrease in size daily. Life and motion lose their
force, planets can hardly gravitate in space; they are extinguished
one by one, like a lamp which the hand of the chokra (servant)
neglects to replenish. Surya (the Sun) flickers and goes out,
matter falls into dissolution (pralaya), and Brahma merges back
into Dayus, the Unrevealed God, and, his task being<HR>

accomplished, he falls asleep. Another day is passed, night sets
in, and continues until the future dawn.
<P>
&quot;And now again he re-enters into the golden egg of His Thought,
the germs of all that exist, as the divine Manu tells us. During
His peaceful rest, the animated beings, endowed with the principles
of action, cease their functions, and all feeling (manas) becomes
dormant. When they are all absorbed in the <STRONG>S</STRONG>UPREME
<STRONG>S</STRONG>OUL, this Soul of all the beings sleeps in complete
repose till the day when it resumes its form, and awakes again
from its primitive darkness.&quot;*
<P>
As the &quot;<EM>Satya</EM>-<EM>yuga</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>is always
the first in the series of the four ages or Yugas, so the Kali
ever comes the last. The <EM>Kali yuga </EM>reigns now supreme
in India, and it seems to coincide with that of the Western age.
Anyhow, it is curious to see how prophetic in almost all things
was the writer of Vishnu Purana when foretelling to Maitreya some
of the dark influences and sins of this Kali Yug. For after saying
that the &quot;barbarians&quot; will be masters of the banks of
the Indus, of Chandrabhaga and Kasmera, he adds:
<P>
&quot;There will be contemporary monarchs, reigning over the earth
-- kings of churlish spirit, violent temper, and ever addicted
to falsehood and wickedness. They will inflict death on women,
children, and cows; they will seize upon the property of their
subjects, and <EM>be intent upon the wives of others; </EM>they
will be of unlimited power, their lives will be short, their desires
insatiable. . . . People of various countries intermingling with
them, will follow their example; and the barbarians being powerful
(in India) in the patronage of the princes, while purer tribes
are neglected, the people will perish (or, as the Commentator
has it, 'The Mlechchhas will be in the centre and the Aryas in
the end.')** Wealth and piety will decrease until the world will
be wholly depraved. Property alone will confer rank; wealth will
be the only source of devotion; passion will be the sole bond
of union between the sexes; falsehood will be the only means of
success in litigation; and women will be objects merely of sensual
gratification. . . . . . <EM>External types will be the only distinction
of the several orders of life;</EM> . . . . . a man if rich will
be reputed pure; dishonesty (<EM>anyaya</EM>)<EM> will</EM> be
the universal means of subsistence, weakness the cause of dependence,
menace and presumption will be substituted for learning; liberality
will be devotion; mutual assent, marriage; fine clothes, dignity.
He who is the strongest will reign; the people, unable to bear
the heavy burthen, <EM>Khara bhara </EM>(the load of taxes) will
take refuge among the valleys. . . . Thus, in the Kali age will
decay constantly proceed, until

the human race approaches its annihilation (pralaya) . . . . When
the close of the Kali age shall be nigh, a portion of that divine
being which exists, of its own spiritual nature . . . shall descend
on Earth . . . (<EM>Kalki Avatar</EM>)<EM> </EM>endowed with the
eight superhuman faculties. . . . He will re-establish righteousness
on earth, and the minds of those who live at the end of Kali Yuga
shall be awakened and become as pellucid as crystal. The men who
are thus changed . . . <EM>shall be the seeds of human beings</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and shall give birth to a race who shall follow the laws
of the Krita age, the age of purity. As it is said, 'When the
sun and moon and the lunar asterism Tishya and the planet Jupiter
are in one mansion, the Krita (or Satya) age shall return.' &quot;
<P>
&quot;. . . . Two persons, Devapi, of the race of Kuru and Moru,
of the family of Ikshwaku, continue alive throughout the four
ages, residing at Kalapa.* They will return hither in the beginning
of the Krita age . . . Moru** the son of Sighru through the power
of Yoga is still living . . . . and will be the restorer of the
Kshattriya race of the Solar dynasty.&quot;*** (<EM>Vayu Purana</EM>,<EM>
</EM>Vol. III, <EM>p</EM>. 197).
<P>
Whether right or wrong with regard to the latter prophecy, the
<EM>blessings </EM>of Kali Yuga are well described, and fit in
admirably even with that which one sees and hears in Europe and
other civilized and Christian lands in full XIXth, and at the
dawn of the XXth century of our great era of <STRONG>E</STRONG>NLIGHTENMENT.

* Matsya Purana gives Katapa.
<P>
** Max Muller translates the name as Morya, of the Morya dynasty,
to which Chandragupta belonged (see Sanscrit Literature). In Matsya
Purana, chapter cclxxii, the dynasty of ten Moryas (or Maureyas)
is spoken of. In the same chapter, cclxxii, it is stated that
the Moryas will one day reign over India, after restoring the
Kshattriya race many thousand years hence. Only that reign will
be purely Spiritual and &quot;not of this world.&quot; It will
be the kingdom of the next Avatar. Colonel Tod believes the name
Morya (or <EM>Maureyas</EM>)<EM> </EM>a corruption of Mori, a
Rajpoot tribe, and the commentary on Mahavansa thinks that some
princes have taken their name Maurya from their town called Mori,
or, as Professor Max Muller gives it, Morya-Nagara, which is more
correct, after the original Mahavansa. Vachaspattya, we are informed
by our Brother, Devan Badhadur R. Ragoonath Rao, of Madras, a
Sanscrit Encyclopedia, places Katapa (Kalapa) on the northern
side of the Himalayas, hence in Tibet. The same is stated in chapter
xii. (Skanda) of Bhagavat, Vol. III, p. 325.
<P>
*** The Vayu Purana declares that Moru will re-establish the Kshattriya
in the Nineteenth coming Yuga. (<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Five years
of Theosophy</EM>,&quot;<EM> p. </EM>483<EM>. </EM>&quot;<EM>The
