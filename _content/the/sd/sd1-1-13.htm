<H3>SUMMING UP.</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The History of Creation and of this world from its beginning
up to the present time is composed of <EM>seven chapters. </EM>The<EM>
seventh </EM>chapter is not yet written.&quot;<BR>
(T. Subba Row, <EM>Theosophist, </EM>1881.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE first of these Seven chapters has been attempted
and is now finished. However incomplete and feeble as an exposition,
it is, at any rate, an approximation -- using the word in a mathematical
sense -- to that which is the oldest basis for all the subsequent
Cosmogonies. The attempt to render in a European tongue the grand
panorama of the ever periodically recurring Law -- impressed upon
the plastic minds of the first races endowed with Consciousness
by those who reflected the same from the Universal Mind -- is
daring, for no human language, save the Sanskrit -- which is that
<EM>of the Gods</EM> -- can<EM> </EM>do so with any degree of
adequacy. But the failures in this work must be forgiven for the
sake of the motive.
<P>
As a whole, neither the foregoing nor what follows can be found
in full anywhere. It is not taught in any of the six Indian schools
of philosophy, for it pertains to their synthesis -- the seventh,
which is the Occult doctrine. It is not traced on any crumbling
papyrus of Egypt, nor is it any longer graven on Assyrian tile
or granite wall. The Books of the <EM>Vedanta </EM>(the last word
of human knowledge) give out but the metaphysical aspect of this
world-Cosmogony; and their priceless thesaurus, the <EM>Upanishads
-- Upa-ni-shad </EM>being a compound word meaning &quot;the conquest
of ignorance by the revelation of <EM>secret, spiritual </EM>knowledge&quot;
-- require now the additional possession of a Master-key to enable
the student to get at their full meaning. The reason for this
I venture to state here as I learned it from a Master.
<P>
The name, &quot;<EM>Upanishads</EM>,&quot; is usually translated
&quot;esoteric doctrine.&quot; These treatises form part of the
<EM>Sruti </EM>or &quot;revealed knowledge,&quot; <EM>Revelation,
</EM>in short, and are generally attached to the <EM>Brahmana</EM>
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 270 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
portion of the Vedas,* as their third division. There are over
150 <EM>Upanishads </EM>enumerated by, and known to, Orientalists,
who credit the oldest with being written <EM>probably </EM>about
600 years B.C.; but of <EM>genuine </EM>texts there does not exist
a fifth of the number. The Upanishads are to the Vedas what the
Kabala is to the Jewish Bible. They treat of and expound the secret
and mystic meaning of the Vedic texts. They speak of the origin
of the Universe, the nature of Deity, and of Spirit and Soul,
as also of the metaphysical connection of mind and matter. In
a few words: They CONTAIN <EM>the beginning and the end of</EM>
<EM>all human knowledge, but they have now ceased to </EM>REVEAL
<EM>it</EM>, since the day of Buddha. If it were otherwise, the
Upanishads could not be called <EM>esoteric, </EM>since they are
now openly attached to the Sacred Brahmanical books, which have,
in our present age, become accessible even to the <EM>Mlechchhas</EM>
(out-<EM>castes</EM>)<EM> </EM>and the European Orientalists.
One thing in them -- and this in all the <EM>Upanishads</EM> --
invariably and constantly points to their ancient origin, and
proves (<EM>a</EM>) that they were written, in some of their portions,
<EM>before </EM>the caste system became the tyrannical institution
which it still is; and (<EM>b</EM>) that half of their contents
have been eliminated, while some of them were rewritten and abridged.
&quot;The great Teachers of the higher Knowledge and the Brahmans
are continually represented as going to Kshatriya (military caste)
kings to become their pupils.&quot; As Cowell pertinently remarks,
the <EM>Upanishads </EM>&quot;breathe an entirely different spirit&quot;
(from other Brahmanical writings), &quot;a freedom of thought
unknown in any earlier work except in the Rig Veda hymns themselves.&quot;
The second fact is explained by a tradition recorded in one of
the <STRONG>MSS</STRONG>. on Buddha's life. It says that the Upanishads
were originally attached to their Brahmanas after the beginning
of a reform, which led to the exclusiveness of the present caste
system among the Brahmins, a few centuries after the invasion
of India by the &quot;twice-born.&quot; They were complete in
those days, and were used for the instruction of the chelas who
were preparing for their initiation.

* &quot;The Vedas have a distinct dual meaning -- one expressed
by the literal sense of the words, the other indicated by the
metre and the <EM>swara</EM> -- intonation -- which are as the
life of the Vedas. . . . Learned pundits and philologists of course
deny that <EM>swara</EM> has anything to do with philosophy or
ancient esoteric doctrines; but the mysterious connection between
<EM>swara </EM>and<EM> light</EM> is one of its most profound
secrets.&quot; (T. Subba Row, <EM>Five Years of</EM> <EM>Theosophy,
</EM>p. 154.) <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 271 OCCULTISM IN THE UPANISHADS.</H6>

<P>
This lasted so long as the Vedas and the Brahmanas remained in
the sole and exclusive keeping of the temple-Brahmins -- while
no one else had the right to study or even read them outside of
the <EM>sacred </EM>caste. Then came Gautama, the Prince of Kapilavastu.
After <EM>learning </EM>the whole of the Brahmanical wisdom in
the <EM>Rahasya </EM>or the <EM>Upanishads, </EM>and finding that
the teachings differed little, if at all, from those of the &quot;Teachers
of Life&quot; inhabiting the snowy ranges of the Himalaya,* the
Disciple of the Brahmins, feeling indignant because the sacred
wisdom was thus withheld from all but the Brahmins, determined
to save the whole world by popularizing it. Then it was that the
Brahmins, seeing that their sacred knowledge and Occult wisdom
was falling into the hands of the &quot;<EM>Mlechchhas,</EM>&quot;
abridged the texts of the Upanishads, originally containing thrice
the matter of the Vedas and the Brahmanas together, without altering,
however, one word of the texts. They simply detached from the
<STRONG>MSS</STRONG>. the most important portions containing the
last word of the Mystery of Being. The key to the Brahmanical
secret code remained henceforth with the initiates alone, and
the Brahmins were thus in a position to publicly deny the correctness
of Buddha's teaching by appealing to their <EM>Upanishads,</EM>
silenced for ever on the chief questions. Such is the esoteric
tradition beyond the Himalayas.
<P>
Sri Sankaracharya, the greatest Initiate living in the historical
ages, wrote many a Bhashya on the <EM>Upanishads. </EM>But his
original treatises, as there are reasons to suppose, have not
yet fallen into the hands of the Philistines, for they are too
jealously preserved in his <EM>maths</EM> (monasteries, <EM>mathams</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>And there are still weightier reasons to believe that the
priceless Bhashyas (Commentaries) on the esoteric doctrine of
the Brahmins, by their greatest expounder, will remain for ages
yet a dead letter to most of the Hindus, except the <EM>Smartava</EM>
Brahmins. This sect, founded by Sankaracharya, (which is still
very powerful in Southern India) is now almost the only one to
produce students who have preserved sufficient knowledge to comprehend

dead letter of the Bhashyas. The reason of this is that they alone,
I am informed, have occasionally real Initiates at their head
in their mathams, as for instance, in the &quot;Sringa-giri,&quot;
in the Western Ghats of Mysore. On the other hand, there is no
sect in that desperately exclusive caste of the Brahmins, more
exclusive than is the Smartava; and the reticence of its followers
to say what they may know of the Occult sciences and the esoteric
doctrine, is only equalled by their pride and learning.
<P>
Therefore the writer of the present statement must be prepared
beforehand to meet with great opposition and even the denial of
such statements as are brought forward in this work. Not that
any claim to infallibility, or to perfect correctness in every
detail of all that which is herein said, was ever put forward.
Facts are there, and they can hardly be denied. But, owing to
the intrinsic difficulties of the subjects treated, and the almost
insurmountable limitations of the English tongue (as of all other
European languages) to express certain ideas, it is more than
probable that the writer has failed to present the explanations
in the best and in the clearest form; yet all that could be done
was done under every adverse circumstance, and this is the utmost
that can be expected of any writer.
<P>
Let us recapitulate and show, by the vastness of the subjects
expounded, how difficult, if not impossible, it is to do them
full justice.
<P>
(1.) The Secret Doctrine is the accumulated Wisdom of the Ages,
and its cosmogony alone is the most stupendous and elaborate system:
<EM>e.g.,</EM> even in the exotericism of the Puranas. But such
is the mysterious power of Occult symbolism, that the facts which
have actually occupied countless generations of initiated seers
and prophets to marshal, to set down and explain, in the bewildering
series of evolutionary progress, are all recorded on a few pages
of geometrical signs and glyphs. The flashing gaze of those seers
has penetrated into the very kernel of matter, and recorded the
soul of things there, where an ordinary profane, however learned,
would have perceived but the external work of form. But modern
science believes not in the &quot;soul of things,&quot; and hence
will reject the whole system of ancient cosmogony. It is useless
to say that the system in question is no fancy of one or several
isolated individuals. That it is the uninterrupted record covering
thousands of generations of Seers whose respective experiences
were made to test and to verify the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 273 THE PITH AND MARROW OF OCCULTISM.</H6>

<P>
traditions passed orally by one early race to another, of the
teachings of higher and exalted beings, who watched over the childhood
of Humanity. That for long ages, the &quot;Wise Men&quot; of the
Fifth Race, of the stock saved and rescued from the last cataclysm
and shifting of continents, had passed their lives <EM>in learning,
not teaching. </EM>How did they do so? It is answered: by checking,
testing, and verifying in every department of nature the traditions
of old by the independent visions of great adepts; <EM>i.e., </EM>men
who have developed and perfected their physical, mental, psychic,
and spiritual organisations to the utmost possible degree. No
vision of one adept was accepted till it was checked and confirmed
by the visions -- so obtained as to stand as independent evidence
-- of other adepts, and by centuries of experiences.
<P>
(2.) The fundamental Law in that system, the central point from
which all emerged, around and toward which all gravitates, and
upon which is hung the philosophy of the rest, is the One homogeneous
divine SUBSTANCE-PRINCIPLE, the one radical cause.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . &quot;Some few, whose lamps shone brighter, have been led
<BR>
From cause to cause to nature's secret head,<BR>
And found that one first Principle must be. . . .&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It is called &quot;Substance-Principle,&quot; for it becomes &quot;substance&quot;
on the plane of the manifested Universe, an illusion, while it
remains a &quot;principle&quot; in the beginningless and endless
abstract, visible and invisible SPACE. It is the omnipresent Reality:
impersonal, because it contains all and everything. <EM>Its impersonality
is the fundamental conception</EM> of the System. It is latent
in every atom in the Universe, and is the Universe itself. (See
in chapters on Symbolism, &quot;Primordial Substance, and Divine
Thought.&quot;)
<P>
(3.) The Universe is the periodical manifestation of this unknown
Absolute Essence. To call it &quot;essence,&quot; however, is
to sin against the very spirit of the philosophy. For though the
noun may be derived in this case from the verb <EM>esse, </EM>&quot;to
be,&quot; yet IT cannot be identified with a <EM>being </EM>of
any kind, that can be conceived by human intellect. IT is best
described as neither Spirit nor matter, but both. &quot;Parabrahmam
and Mulaprakriti&quot; are One, in reality, yet two in the Universal
conception of the manifested, even in the conception of the One
Logos, its first manifestation, to which, as the able lecturer
in the &quot;Notes on the Bhagavadgita&quot; shows, IT appears
from the objective standpoint of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 274 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
the One Logos as Mulaprakriti and not as Parabrahmam; as its <EM>veil</EM>
and not the one REALITY hidden behind, which is unconditioned
and absolute.
<P>
(4.) The Universe is called, with everything in it, MAYA, because
all is temporary therein, from the ephemeral life of a fire-fly
to that of the Sun. Compared to the eternal immutability of the
ONE, and the changelessness of that Principle, the Universe, with
its evanescent ever-changing forms, must be necessarily, in the
mind of a philosopher, no better than a will-o'-the-wisp. Yet,
the Universe is real enough to the conscious beings in it, which
are as unreal as it is itself.
<P>
(5.) Everything in the Universe, throughout all its kingdoms,
is CONSCIOUS:<EM> i.e.,</EM> endowed with a consciousness of its
own kind and on its own plane of perception. We men must remember
that because <EM>we</EM> do not perceive any signs -- which we
can recognise -- of consciousness, say, in stones, we have no
right to say that <EM>no consciousness exists there. </EM>There
is no such thing as either &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;blind&quot;
matter, as there is no &quot;Blind&quot; or &quot;Unconscious&quot;
Law. These find no place among the conceptions of Occult philosophy.
The latter never stops at surface appearances, and for it the
<EM>noumenal </EM>essences have more reality than their objective
counterparts; it resembles therein the mediaeval<EM> Nominalists,</EM>
for whom it was the Universals that were the realities and the
particulars which existed only in name and human fancy.
<P>
(6.) The Universe is worked and <EM>guided </EM>from<EM> within
outwards. </EM>As above so it is below, as in heaven so on earth;
and man -- the microcosm and miniature copy of the macrocosm --
is the living witness to this Universal Law, and to the mode of
its action. We see that every <EM>external </EM>motion, act, gesture,
whether voluntary or mechanical, organic or mental, is produced
and preceded by <EM>internal </EM>feeling or emotion, will or
volition, and thought or mind. As no outward motion or change,
when normal, in man's external body can take place unless provoked
by an inward impulse, given through one of the three functions
named, so with the external or manifested Universe. The whole
Kosmos is guided, controlled, and animated by almost endless series
of Hierarchies of sentient Beings, each having a mission to perform,
and who -- whether we give to them one name or another, and call
them Dhyan-Chohans or Angels -- are &quot;messengers&quot; in
the sense only that they are the agents of Karmic and Cosmic Laws.
They vary infinitely in their<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 275 THE NATURE OF THE CELESTIAL MEN.</H6>

<P>
respective degrees of consciousness and intelligence; and to call
them all pure Spirits without any of the earthly alloy &quot;which
time is wont to prey upon&quot; is only to indulge in poetical
fancy. For each of these Beings either <EM>was, </EM>or prepares
to become, a man, if not in the present, then in a past or a coming
cycle (Manvantara). They are <EM>perfected, </EM>when not<EM>
incipient, </EM>men; and differ morally from the terrestrial human
beings on their higher (less material) spheres, only in that they
are devoid of the feeling of personality and of the <EM>human
</EM>emotional nature -- two purely earthly characteristics. The
former, or the &quot;perfected,&quot; have become free from those
feelings, because (<EM>a</EM>) they have no longer fleshly bodies
-- an ever-numbing weight on the Soul; and (<EM>b</EM>) the pure
spiritual element being left untrammelled and more free, they
are less influenced by<EM> maya </EM>than man can ever be, unless
he is an adept who keeps his two personalities -- the spiritual
and the physical -- entirely separated. The incipient monads,
having never had terrestrial bodies yet, can have no sense of
personality or EGO-ism. That which is meant by &quot;personality,&quot;
being a limitation and a relation, or, as defined by Coleridge,
&quot;individuality existing in itself but with a nature as a
ground,&quot; the term cannot of course be applied to non-human
entities; but, as a fact insisted upon by generations of Seers,
none of these Beings, high or low, have either individuality or
personality as separate Entities, <EM>i.e.,</EM> they have no
individuality in the sense in which a man says, &quot;<EM>I am
myself and</EM> no one else;&quot; in other words, they are conscious
of no such distinct separateness as men and things have on earth.
Individuality is the characteristic of their respective hierarchies,
not of their units; and these characteristics vary only with the
degree of the plane to which those hierarchies belong: the nearer
to the region of Homogeneity and the One Divine, the purer and
the less accentuated that individuality in the Hierarchy. They
are finite, in all respects, with the exception of their higher
principles -- the immortal sparks reflecting the universal divine
flame -- individualized and separated only on the spheres of Illusion
by a differentiation as illusive as the rest. They are &quot;Living
Ones,&quot; because they are the streams projected on the Kosmic
screen of illusion from the ABSOLUTE LIFE; beings in whom life
cannot become extinct, before the fire of ignorance is extinct
in those who sense these &quot;Lives.&quot; Having sprung into
being under the quickening influence of the uncreated beam, the
reflection of the great Central Sun that<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 276 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
radiates on the shores of the river of Life, it is the inner principle
in them which belongs to the waters of immortality, while its
differentiated clothing is as perishable as man's body. Therefore
Young was right in saying that
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Angels are men of a superior kind&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
and no more. They are neither &quot;ministering&quot; nor &quot;protecting&quot;
angels; nor are they &quot;Harbingers of the Most High&quot; still
less the &quot;Messengers of wrath&quot; of any God such as man's
fancy has created. To appeal to their protection is as foolish
as to believe that their sympathy may be secured by any kind of
propitiation; for they are, as much as man himself is, the slaves
and creatures of immutable Karmic and Kosmic law. The reason for
it is evident. Having no elements of personality in their essence
they can have no personal qualities, such as attributed by men,
in their exoteric religions, to their anthropomorphic God -- a
jealous and exclusive God who rejoices and feels wrathful, is
pleased with sacrifice, and is more despotic in his vanity than
any finite foolish man. Man, as shown in Book II., being a compound
of the essences of all those celestial Hierarchies may succeed
in making himself, as such, superior, in one sense, to any hierarchy
or class, or even combination of them. &quot;Man can neither propitiate
nor command the <EM>Devas,</EM>&quot; it is said. But, by paralyzing
his lower personality, and arriving thereby at the full knowledge
of the <EM>non-separateness </EM>of his higher SELF from the One
absolute SELF, man can, even during his terrestrial life, become
as &quot;One of Us.&quot; Thus it is, by eating of the fruit of
knowledge which dispels ignorance, that man becomes like one of
the Elohim or the Dhyanis; and once on <EM>their </EM>plane the
Spirit of Solidarity and perfect Harmony, which reigns in every
Hierarchy, must extend over him and protect him in every particular.
<P>
The chief difficulty which prevents men of science from believing
in divine as well as in nature Spirits is their materialism. The
main impediment before the Spiritualist which hinders him from
believing in the same, while preserving a blind belief in the
&quot;Spirits&quot; of the Departed, is the general ignorance
of all, except some Occultists and Kabalists, about the true essence
and nature of matter. It is on the acceptance or rejection of
the theory of the <EM>Unity of all in Nature, in its</EM> <EM>ultimate
Essence, </EM>that mainly rests the belief or unbelief in the
existence around us of other conscious beings besides the Spirits
of the Dead.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 277 MANY BODIES BUT ONE SOUL.</H6>

<P>
It is on the right comprehension of the primeval Evolution of
Spirit-Matter and its real essence that the student has to depend
for the further elucidation in his mind of the Occult Cosmogony,
and for the only sure clue which can guide his subsequent studies.
<P>
In sober truth, as just shown, every &quot;Spirit&quot; so-called
is either a <EM>disembodied or a future man. </EM>As from the
highest Archangel (Dhyan Chohan) down to the last conscious &quot;Builder&quot;
(the inferior class of Spiritual Entities), all such are <EM>men</EM>,
having lived aeons ago, in other Manvantaras, on this or other
Spheres; so the inferior, semi-intelligent and non-intelligent
Elementals -- are all <EM>future </EM>men. That fact alone --
that a Spirit is endowed with intelligence -- is a proof to the
Occultist that that Being must have been a <EM>man, </EM>and acquired
his knowledge and intelligence throughout the human cycle. There
is but one indivisible and absolute Omniscience and Intelligence
in the Universe, and this thrills throughout every atom and infinitesimal
point of the whole finite Kosmos which hath no bounds, and which
people call SPACE, considered independently of anything contained
in it. But the first differentiation of its <EM>reflection </EM>in
the manifested World is purely Spiritual, and the Beings generated
in it are not endowed with a consciousness that has any relation
to the one we conceive of. They can have no human consciousness
or Intelligence before they have acquired such, personally and
individually. This may be a mystery, yet it is a fact, in Esoteric
philosophy, and a very apparent one too.
<P>
The whole order of nature evinces a progressive march towards
<EM>a</EM> <EM>higher life. </EM>There is design in the action
of the seemingly blindest forces. The whole process of evolution
with its endless adaptations is a proof of this. The immutable
laws that weed out the weak and feeble species, to make room for
the strong, and which ensure the &quot;survival of the fittest,&quot;
though so cruel in their immediate action -- all are working toward
the grand end. The very <EM>fact </EM>that adaptations <EM>do
</EM>occur, that the fittest <EM>do </EM>survive in the struggle
for existence, shows that what is called &quot;unconscious Nature&quot;*
is in reality an aggregate of forces mani-
<H6>[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]
</H6>

<P>
* Nature taken in its abstract sense, <EM>cannot</EM> be &quot;unconscious,&quot;
as it is the emanation from, and thus an aspect (on the manifested
plane) of the ABSOLUTE consciousness. Where is that daring man
who would presume to deny to vegetation and even to minerals <EM>a
consciousness of their own. </EM>All he can say is, that this
consciousness is beyond his comprehension.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 278 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
pulated by semi-intelligent beings (Elementals) guided by High
Planetary Spirits, (Dhyan Chohans), whose collective aggregate
forms the manifested <EM>verbum </EM>of the unmanifested LOGOS,
and constitutes at one and the same time the MIND of the Universe
and its immutable LAW.
<P>
Three distinct representations of the Universe in its three distinct
aspects are impressed upon our thought by the esoteric philosophy:
the PRE-EXISTING (evolved from) the EVER-EXISTING; and the PHENOMENAL
-- the world of illusion, the reflection, and shadow thereof.
During the great mystery and drama of life known as the Manvantara,
real Kosmos is like the object placed behind the white screen
upon which are thrown the Chinese shadows, called forth by the
magic lantern. The actual figures and things remain invisible,
while the wires of evolution are pulled by the unseen hands; and
men and things are thus but the reflections, <EM>on </EM>the white
field, of the realities <EM>behind </EM>the snares of <EM>Mahamaya,
</EM>or the great Illusion. This was taught in every philosophy,
in every religion, <EM>ante </EM>as well as <EM>post </EM>diluvian,
in India and Chaldea, by the Chinese as by the Grecian Sages.
In the former countries these three Universes were allegorized,
in exoteric teachings, by the three trinities emanating from the
Central eternal germ and forming with it a Supreme Unity: the
<EM>initial, </EM>the <EM>manifested, </EM>and the <EM>Creative</EM>
Triad, or the three in One. The last is but the symbol, in its
concrete expression, of the first <EM>ideal </EM>two. Hence Esoteric
philosophy passes over the necessarianism of this purely metaphysical
conception, and calls the first one, only, the Ever Existing.
This is the view of every one of the six great schools of Indian
philosophy -- the <EM>six principles of</EM> <EM>that unit body
of </EM>WISDOM <EM>of which the </EM>&quot;<EM>gnosis,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>the<EM> hidden</EM> knowledge, is the seventh.
<P>
The writer hopes that, superficially handled as may be the comments
on the Seven Stanzas, enough has been given in this cosmogonic
portion of the work to show Archaic teachings to be more <EM>scientific
</EM>(in the modern sense of the word) on their very face, than
any other ancient Scriptures left to be regarded and judged on
their exoteric aspect. Since, however, as confessed before, this
work <EM>withholds far more than it</EM> <EM>gives out, </EM>the
student is invited to use his own intuitions. Our chief care is
to elucidate that which has already been given out, and, to our
regret, very incorrectly at times; to supplement the knowledge
hinted at -- whenever and wherever possible -- by addi-<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 279 HERMES, OR ARISTOTLE?</H6>

<P>
tional matter; and to bulwark our doctrines against the too strong
attacks of modern Sectarianism, and more especially against those
of our latter-day Materialism, very often miscalled Science, whereas,
in reality, the words &quot;Scientists&quot; and &quot;Sciolists&quot;
ought alone to bear the responsibility for the many illogical
theories offered to the world. In its great ignorance, the public,
while blindly accepting everything that emanates from &quot;authorities,&quot;
and feeling it to be its duty to regard every <EM>dictum </EM>coming
from a man of Science as a proven fact -- the public, we say,
is taught to scoff at anything brought forward from &quot;heathen&quot;
sources. Therefore, as materialistic Scientists can be fought
solely with their own weapons -- those of controversy and argument
-- an<EM> Addendum </EM>is added to every Book contrasting our
respective views and showing how even great authorities may often
err. We believe that this can be done effectually by showing the
weak points of our opponents, and by proving their too frequent
sophisms -- made to pass for scientific <EM>dicta</EM> -- to be
incorrect. We hold to Hermes and his &quot;Wisdom&quot; -- in
its universal character; they -- to Aristotle as against intuition
and the experience of the ages, fancying that Truth is the exclusive
property of the Western world. Hence the disagreement. As Hermes
says, &quot;Knowledge differs much from sense; for sense is of
things that surmount it, but Knowledge (gyi) is the end of sense&quot;
--<EM> i.e., </EM>of the illusion of our physical brain and its
intellect; thus emphasizing the contrast between the laboriously
acquired knowledge of the senses and mind (manas), and the intuitive
omniscience of the Spiritual divine Soul -- Buddhi.
<P>
Whatever may be the destiny of these actual writings in a remote
future, we hope to have proven so far the following facts:
<P>
(1) The Secret Doctrine teaches no <EM>Atheism, </EM>except in
the Hindu sense of the word <EM>nastika, </EM>or the rejection
of <EM>idols, </EM>including every anthropomorphic god. In this
sense every Occultist is a <EM>Nastika</EM>.
<P>
(2) It admits a Logos or a collective &quot;Creator&quot; of the
Universe; a <EM>Demi-urgos</EM> -- in<EM> </EM>the sense implied
when one speaks of an &quot;Architect&quot; as the &quot;Creator&quot;
of an edifice, whereas that Architect has never touched one stone
of it, but, while furnishing the plan, left all the manual labour
to the masons; in our case the plan was furnished by the Ideation
of the Universe, and the constructive labour was left to the Hosts
of intelligent Powers and Forces. But that <EM>Demiurgos </EM>is
no<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 280 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
<EM>personal </EM>deity, --<EM> i.e.,</EM> an imperfect <EM>extra-cosmic
god</EM>, -- but only the aggregate of the Dhyan-Chohans and the
other forces.
<P>
As to the latter --
<P>
(3) They are dual in their character; being composed of (<EM>a</EM>)<EM>
</EM>the irrational <EM>brute energy, </EM>inherent in matter,
and (<EM>b</EM>) the intelligent soul or cosmic consciousness
which directs and guides that energy, and which is the <EM>Dhyan-Chohanic
thought reflecting the Ideation of the</EM> <EM>Universal mind.
</EM>This results in a perpetual series of physical manifestations
and <EM>moral effects </EM>on Earth, during manvantaric periods,
the whole being subservient to Karma. As that process is not always
perfect; and since, however many proofs it may exhibit of a guiding
intelligence behind the veil, it still shows gaps and flaws, and
even results very often in evident failures -- therefore, neither
the collective Host (Demiurgos), nor any of the working powers
individually, are proper subjects for divine honours or worship.
All are entitled to the grateful reverence of Humanity, however,
and man ought to be ever striving to help the divine evolution
of <EM>Ideas, </EM>by becoming to the best of his ability a <EM>co-worker
with nature </EM>in the cyclic task. The ever unknowable and incognizable
<EM>Karana </EM>alone, the <EM>Causeless </EM>Cause of all causes,
should have its shrine and altar on the holy and ever untrodden
ground of our heart -- invisible, intangible, unmentioned, save
through &quot;the still small voice&quot; of our spiritual consciousness.
Those who worship before it, ought to do so in the silence and
the sanctified solitude of their Souls*; making their spirit the
sole mediator between them and the <EM>Universal Spirit, </EM>their
good actions the only priests, and their sinful intentions the
only visible and objective sacrificial victims to the <EM>Presence.
</EM>(<EM>See Part II., </EM>&quot;<EM>On the Hidden Deity.</EM>&quot;)
<P>
(4) Matter is <EM>Eternal. </EM>It is the <EM>Upadhi </EM>(the
physical basis) for the One infinite Universal Mind to build thereon
its ideations. Therefore, the Esotericists maintain that there
is no inorganic or <EM>dead </EM>matter in nature, the distinction
between the two made by Science being as unfounded as it is arbitrary
and devoid of reason.

<P>
Whatever Science may think, however -- and <EM>exact</EM> Science
is a fickle dame, as we all know by experience -- Occultism knows
and teaches differently, from time immemorial -- from <EM>Manu</EM>
and<EM> Hermes</EM> down to Paracelsus and his successors.
<P>
Thus Hermes, the thrice great Trismegistus, says: &quot;Oh, my
son, matter <EM>becomes; </EM>formerly it <EM>was; </EM>for matter
is the vehicle of becoming.&quot;* Becoming is the mode of activity
of the uncreate deity. Having been endowed with the germs of becoming,
matter (objective) is brought into birth, for the creative force
fashions it <EM>according to the ideal forms. </EM>Matter not
yet engendered had no form; it becomes when it is put into operation.&quot;
(<EM>The Definitions of Asclepios, </EM>p. 134, &quot;Virgin of
the World.&quot;)
<P>
&quot;Everything is the product of one universal creative effort.
. . . There is nothing <EM>dead, </EM>in Nature. <EM>Everything
is organic and living, </EM>and therefore the whole world appears
to be a living organism.&quot; (Paracelsus, &quot;<EM>Philosophia
ad Athenienes</EM>,&quot; F. Hartmann's translations, p. 44.)
<P>
(5.) The Universe was evolved out of its ideal plan, upheld through
Eternity in the unconsciousness of that which the Vedantins call
Parabrahm. This is practically identical with the conclusions
of the highest Western Philosophy -- &quot;the innate, eternal,
and self-existing Ideas&quot; of Plato, now reflected by Von Hartmann.
The &quot;unknowable&quot; of Herbert Spencer bears only a faint
resemblance to that transcendental <EM>Reality </EM>believed in
by Occultists, often appearing merely a personification of a &quot;<EM>force
</EM>behind phenomena&quot; -- an infinite and eternal <EM>Energy</EM>

<P>
* To this the late Mrs. (Dr.) Kingsford, the able translator and
compiler of the Hermetic Fragments (see &quot;<EM>The Virgin of
the</EM> <EM>World</EM>&quot;) remarks in a foot-note; &quot;Dr.
Menard observes that in Greek the same word signifies <EM>to be
born</EM> and <EM>to become. </EM>The idea here is that the material
of the world is in its essence eternal, but that before creation
or 'becoming' it is in a passive and motionless condition. Thus
it 'was' before being put into operation; now it 'becomes,' that
is, it is mobile and progressive.&quot; And she adds the purely
Vedantic doctrine of the Hermetic philosophy that &quot;Creation
is thus the period of activity (Manvantara) of God, who, according
to Hermetic thought (or <EM>which, </EM>according to the Vedantin)
has two modes -- Activity or Existence, God evolved (<EM>Deus
explicitus</EM>); and Passivity of Being (Pralaya) God involved
(<EM>Deus</EM> <EM>implicitus</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Both modes are perfect
and complete, as are the waking and sleeping states of man. Fichte,
the German philosopher, distinguished Being (Seyn) as One, which
we know only through existence (Dasein) as the Manifold. This
view is thoroughly Hermetic. The 'Ideal Forms' are the archetypal
or formative ideas of the Neo-Platonists; the eternal and subjective
concepts of things subsisting in the divine mind prior to 'becoming'&quot;
(p. 134).<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 282 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
from which all things proceed, while the author of the &quot;Philosophy
of the Unconscious&quot; has come (in this respect only) as near
to a solution of the great <EM>Mystery </EM>as mortal man can.
Few were those, whether in ancient or mediaeval philosophy, who
have dared to approach the subject or even hint at it. Paracelsus
mentions it inferentially. His ideas are admirably synthesized
by Dr. F. Hartmann, F.T.S., in his &quot;Life of Paracelsus.&quot;
<P>
All the <EM>Christian </EM>Kabalists understood well the Eastern
root idea: The active Power, the &quot;Perpetual motion of the
great Breath&quot; only awakens Kosmos at the dawn of every new
Period, setting it into motion by means of the two contrary Forces,*
and thus causing it to become objective on the plane of Illusion.
In other words, that dual motion transfers Kosmos from the plane
of the Eternal Ideal into that of finite manifestation, or from
the <EM>Noumenal </EM>to the <EM>Phenomenal </EM>plane. Everything
that <EM>is, was, </EM>and <EM>will be</EM>, eternally IS, even
the countless forms, which are finite and perishable only in their
objective, not in their <EM>ideal</EM> Form. They existed as Ideas,
in the Eternity,** and, when they pass away, will exist as reflections.
Neither the form of man, nor that of any animal, plant or stone
has ever been <EM>created, </EM>and it is only on this plane of
ours that it commenced &quot;becoming,&quot;<EM> i.e.,</EM> objectivising
into its present materiality, or expanding <EM>from</EM> <EM>within
outwards, </EM>from the most sublimated and supersensuous essence
into its grossest appearance. Therefore <EM>our</EM> human forms
have existed in the Eternity as astral or ethereal prototypes;
according to which models, the Spiritual Beings (or Gods) whose
duty it was to bring them into objective being and terrestrial
Life, evolved the protoplasmic forms of the future <EM>Egos </EM>from<EM>
their own essence. </EM>After which, when this human <EM>Upadhi,
</EM>or basic mould was ready, the natural terrestrial Forces
began to work on those supersensuous moulds <EM>which contained,
besides their own,</EM> <EM>the elements</EM> <EM>of all the past
vegetable and</EM> <EM>future animal</EM> <EM>forms of this globe
in them. </EM>Therefore, man's <EM>outward </EM>shell passed through
every vegetable and animal body before it assumed the human shape.

* The centripetal and the centrifugal forces, which are male and
female, positive and negative, physical and spiritual, the two

<P>
** Occultism teaches that no form can be given to anything, either
by nature or by man, whose ideal type does not already exist on
the subjective plane. More than this; that no such form or shape
can possibly enter man's consciousness, or evolve in his imagination,
which does not exist in prototype, at least as an approximation.

<P>
described in Book II., with the Commentaries thereupon, there
is no need to say more of it here.
<P>
According to the Hermetico-Kabalistic philosophy of Paracelsus,
it is Yliaster -- the ancestor of the just-born <EM>Protyle, </EM>introduced
by Mr. Crookes in chemistry -- or primordial <EM>Protomateria
</EM>that evolved out of itself the Kosmos.
<P>
&quot;When Evolution took place the Yliaster divided itself. .
. . melted and dissolved, developing from within itself the <EM>Ideos
</EM>or Chaos, called re<EM>spectively Mysterium magnum, Iliados,
Limbus Major, </EM>or Primordial Matter. This Primordial essence
is of a monistic nature, and manifests itself not only as vital
activity, a spiritual force, an invisible, incomprehensible, and
indescribable power, but also as vital matter of which the substance
of living beings consists.&quot; In this <EM>Ideos</EM> of primordial
matter, or the <EM>proto-ilos -- </EM>which is the matrix of all
created things -- is contained the substance from which everything
is formed. It is the Chaos . . . out of which the Macrocosm, and,
later on, by evolution and division in <EM>Mysteria Specialia,*
</EM>each separate being, came into existence. &quot;All things
and all elementary substances were contained in it <EM>in potentia
</EM>but not in <EM>actu</EM>&quot;<EM> -- </EM>which makes the
translator, Dr. F. Hartmann, justly observe that &quot;it seems
that Paracelsus anticipated the modern discovery of the 'potency
of matter' three hundred years ago&quot; (P. 42).
<P>
This Magnus Limbus, then, or Yliaster of Paracelsus, is simply
our old friend &quot;Father-Mother,&quot; <EM>within, </EM>before
it appeared in Space, of the second and other Stanzas. It is the
universal matrix of Kosmos, personified in the dual character
of Macro- and Microcosm (or the Universe and our Globe)** by Aditi-Prakriti,
the Spiritual and the physical nature. For we find it explained
in Paracelsus that &quot;the Magnus Limbus is the nursery out
of which all creatures have grown, in the same sense as a tree
grows out of a small seed; with the difference, however, that
the great Limbus takes its origin from the Word, while the Limbus
minor (the terrestrial seed or sperm) takes it from the earth.
<H6>[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]
</H6>

<P>
* This word is explained by Dr. Hartmann from the original texts
of Paracelsus before him, as follows. According to this great
Rosicrucian: &quot;Mysterium is everything out of which something
may be developed, which is only germinally contained in it. A
seed is the 'Mysterium' of a plant, an egg that of a living bird,
etc.&quot;
<P>
** It is only the mediaeval Kabalists who, following the Jewish
and one or two Neo-Platonists, applied the term <EM>Microcosm
</EM>to man. Ancient philosophy called the Earth the Microcosm
of the Macrocosm, and man the outcome of the two.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 284 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
The great Limbus is the seed out of which all beings have come,
and the little Limbus is each ultimate being that reproduces its
form, and that has itself been produced by the 'great.' The latter
possesses all the qualifications of the great one, in the same
sense as a son has an organization similar to that of his father.&quot;
(<EM>See Comment. Book II. para. iii.</EM>)<EM> . </EM>. . &quot;As
Yliaster dissolved, <EM>Ares, </EM>the dividing, differentiating,
and individualising power (<EM>Fohat, </EM>another old friend,)
. . . began to act. All production took place in consequence of
separation. There were produced out of the Ideos, the elements
of Fire, Water, Air and Earth, whose birth, however, did not take
place in a material mode, or by simple separation,&quot; but by
spiritual and dynamical, not even complex, combinations -- e.g.,
mechanical <EM>mixture </EM>as opposed to <EM>chemical </EM>combination
-- just as fire may come out of a pebble, or a tree out of a seed,
although there is originally no fire in the pebble, nor a tree
in the seed. Spirit is living, and Life is Spirit, and Life and
Spirit (<EM>Prakriti Purusha</EM>)<EM> </EM>(?) produce all things,
but they are essentially one and not two. . . . The elements too,
have each one its own Yliaster, because all the activity of matter
in every form is only an effluvium of the same fount. But as from
the seed grow the roots with their fibres, and after that the
stalk with its branches and leaves, and lastly the flowers and
seeds; likewise all beings were born from the elements, and consist
of elementary substances out of which other forms may come into
existence, bearing the characteristics of their parents.&quot;
(&quot;This doctrine, preached 300 years ago,&quot; remarks the
translator, &quot;is identical with the one that has revolutionized
modern thought, after having been put into new shape and elaborated
by Darwin. It was still more elaborated by Kapila in the Sankhya
philosophy&quot;) . . . . The elements as the mothers of all creatures
<EM>are of an invisible, spiritual nature, and have souls.* </EM>They
all spring from the &quot;<EM>Mysterium Magnum.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Philosophia ad Athenienses.</EM>)
<P>
Compare this with Vishnu Purana.
<P>
&quot;From <EM>Pradhana </EM>(primordial substance) presided over

the origin of the subtle elements and from these the organs of
sense (<EM>Book I., ii.</EM>)<EM>.</EM> 
<P>
Thus it may be shown that all the fundamental truths of nature
were universal in antiquity, and that the basic ideas upon spirit,
matter, and the universe, or upon God, Substance, and man, were
identical. Taking the two most ancient religious philosophies
on the globe, Hinduism and Hermetism, from the scriptures of India
and Egypt, the identity of the two is easily recognisable.
<P>
This becomes apparent to one who reads the latest translation
and rendering of the &quot;Hermetic Fragments&quot; just mentioned,
by our late lamented friend, Dr. Anna Kingsford. Disfigured and
tortured as these have been in their passage through Sectarian
Greek and Christian hands, the translator has most ably and intuitionally
seized the weak points and tried to remedy them by means of explanations
and foot-notes. And she says:.......... The creation of the visible
world by the 'working gods' or Titans, as agents of the Supreme
God,* is a thoroughly Hermetic idea, <EM>recognisable in all religious
systems, </EM>and in accordance with modern scientific research
(?), which shows us everywhere the Divine power operating through
natural Forces.&quot;
<P>
&quot;That Universal Being, that contains all, and which is all,
put into motion the Soul and the World, all that nature comprises,
says Hermes. In the manifold unity of universal life, the innumerable
individualities distinguished by their variations, are, nevertheless,
united in such a manner that the whole is one, and that everything
proceeds from Unity.&quot; (<EM>Asclepios, Part I.</EM>)
<P>
&quot;God is not a mind, but the cause that the mind is; <EM>not
a spirit, </EM>but the cause that the Spirit is; not light, but
the cause that the Light is.&quot; (<EM>Divine Pymander, Book
IX., </EM>v. 64.)
<P>
The above shows plainly that &quot;Divine Pymander,&quot; however
much distorted in some passages by Christian &quot;smoothing,&quot;
was nevertheless written by a philosopher, while most of the so-called
&quot;hermetic Fragments&quot; are the production of sectarian
pagans with a tendency towards an anthropomorphic Supreme Being.
Yet both are the echo of the Esoteric philosophy and the Hindu
Puranas.
<P>
Compare two invocations, one to the Hermetic &quot;Supreme All,&quot;
the
<H6>[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]
</H6>

<P>
* A frequent expression in the said Fragments, to which we take
exception. The <EM>Universal Mind </EM>is not a <EM>Being </EM>or
&quot;God.&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 286 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
other to the &quot;Supreme All&quot; of the later Aryans. Says
a Hermetic Fragment cited by Suidas (see Mrs. Kingsford's &quot;<EM>The
Virgin of the World</EM>&quot;)<EM>: </EM>-
<P>
&quot;I adjure thee, Heaven, holy work of the great God; I adjure
thee, Voice of the Father, uttered in the beginning when the universal
world was framed; I adjure thee by the word, only Son of the Father
who upholds all things; be favourable, be favourable.&quot;
<P>
This just preceded by the following: &quot;Thus the Ideal Light
was before the Ideal Light, and the luminous Intelligence of Intelligence
was always, <EM>and its unity was nothing else than the Spirit
enveloping the Universe. Out of whom is neither God nor Angels,
nor any other essentials, for </EM>He (It?) is the Lord of all
things and the power and the Light; and all depends on Him (It)
and is in Him (It), etc.&quot; (<EM>Fragments of the writings
of Hermes to Ammon.</EM>)
<P>
This is contradicted by the very same <EM>Trismegistos, </EM>who
is made to say: &quot;To speak of God is impossible. For corporeal
cannot express the incorporeal. . . . . That which has not any
body nor appearance, nor form, nor matter, cannot be apprehended
by sense. I understand, Tatios, I understand, that which it is
impossible to define -- that is God.&quot; (<EM>Physical Eclogues,
Florilegium of Stobaeus.</EM>)
<P>
The contradiction between the two passages is evident; and this
shows (<EM>a</EM>) that Hermes was a generic <EM>nom-de-plume
</EM>used by a series of generations of mystics of every shade,
and (<EM>b</EM>) that a great discernment has to be used before
accepting a Fragment as esoteric teaching only because it is undeniably
ancient. Let us now compare the above with a like invocation in
the Hindu Scriptures -- undoubtedly as old, if not far older.
Here it is <EM>Parasara, </EM>the Aryan &quot;Hermes&quot; who
instructs <EM>Maitreya, </EM>the Indian Asclepios, and calls upon
Vishnu in his triple hypostasis.
<P>
&quot;Glory to the unchangeable, holy, eternal Supreme Vishnu,
of one universal nature, the mighty over all; to him who is Hiranyagarbha,
Hari, and Sankara (Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva), the creator, the
preserver, and the destroyer of the world; to Vasudeva, the liberator
(of his worshippers); to him whose essence is both single and
manifold; who is both subtile and corporeal, indiscreet and discreet;
to Vishnu the cause of final emancipation, the cause of the creation,
existence, the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 287 ALONE THE ETERNAL IS REST.</H6>

<P>
end of the world; <EM>who is the root of the world, </EM>and who
<EM>consists of the world.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Vish. Purana,
Book L.</EM>)
<P>
This is a grand invocation, full of philosophical meaning underlying
it; but, for the profane masses, as suggestive as is the first
of an anthropomorphic Being. We must respect the feeling that
dictated both; but we cannot help finding it in full disharmony
with its inner meaning, even with that which is found in the same
Hermetic treatise where it is said:
<P>
&quot;Reality is not upon the earth, my son, and it cannot be
thereon. . . . Nothing on earth is real, there are only appearances.
. . He (man) is not real, my son, as man. The real consists solely
in itself and remains what it is. . . Man is transient, therefore
he is not real, he is but appearance, and appearance is the supreme
illusion.
<P>
<EM>Tatios: </EM>Then the <EM>celestial bodies themselves are
not real, my father, since they also vary?</EM> 
<P>
<EM>Trismegistos: </EM>That which is subject to birth and to change
is not real. . . . . There is in them a certain falsity, seeing
that they too are variable.......
<P>
<EM>Tatios: </EM>And what then is the primordial Reality?
<P>
<EM>Trismeg.: </EM>That which is one and alone, 0 Tatios; That
which is not made of matter, nor in any body. Which has neither
colour nor form, which changes not nor is transmitted but which
always is.&quot;
<P>
This is quite consistent with the Vedantic teaching. The leading
thought is Occult; and many are the passages in the Hermetic Fragments
that belong bodily to the Secret Doctrine.
<P>
The latter teaches that the whole universe is ruled by intelligent
and semi-intelligent Forces and Powers, as stated from the very
beginning. Christian Theology admits and even <EM>enforces </EM>belief
in such, but makes an arbitrary division and refers to them as
&quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Devils.&quot; Science denies the
existence of such, and ridicules the very idea. Spiritualists
believe in the Spirits of the Dead, and, outside these, deny entirely
any other kind or class of invisible beings. The Occultists and
Kabalists are thus the only rational expounders of the ancient
traditions, which have now culminated in dogmatic faith on the
one hand, and dogmatic denials on the other. For, both belief
and unbelief embrace but one small corner each of the infinite
horizons of spiritual and physical manifestations; and thus both
are right from<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 288 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
their respective standpoints, and both are wrong in believing
that they can circumscribe the whole within their own special
and narrow barriers; for -- they can never do so. In this respect
Science, Theology, and even Spiritualism show little more wisdom
than the ostrich does, when it hides its head in the sand at its
feet, feeling sure that there can be thus nothing beyond its own
point of observation and the limited area occupied by its foolish
head.
<P>
As the only works now extant upon the subject under consideration
within reach of the profane of the Western &quot;civilized&quot;
races are the above-mentioned Hermetic Books, or rather Hermetic
Fragments, we may contrast them in the present case with the teachings
of Esoteric philosophy. To quote for this purpose from any other
would be useless, since the public knows nothing of the Chaldean
works which are translated into Arabic and preserved by some Sufi
initiates. Therefore the &quot;Definitions of Asclepios,&quot;
as lately compiled and glossed by Mrs. A. Kingsford, F.T.S., some
of which sayings are in remarkable agreement with the Esoteric
Eastern doctrine, have to be resorted to for comparison. Though
not a few passages show a strong impression of some later Christian
hand, yet on the whole the characteristics of the genii* and gods
are those of eastern teachings, while concerning other things
there are passages which differ widely in our doctrines. The following
are a few:--
<H6>[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]
</H6>

<P>
* The Hermetic philosophers called <EM>Theoi, </EM>gods, Genii
and Daimones (in the original texts), those Entities whom we call
<EM>Devas </EM>(gods), Dhyan Chohans, <EM>Chitkala </EM>(Kwan-yin,
the Buddhists call them), and by other names. The <EM>Daimones
</EM>are -- in the Socratic sense, and even in the Oriental and
Latin theological sense -- the guardian spirits of the human race;
&quot;those who dwell in the neighbourhood of the immortals, and
thence watch over human affairs,&quot; as Hermes has it. In Esoteric
parlance, they are called <EM>Chitkala, </EM>some of which are
those who have furnished man with his fourth and fifth Principles
from their own essence; and others the <EM>Pitris </EM>so-called.
This will be explained when we come to the production of the <EM>complete
man. </EM>The root of the name is <EM>Chiti, </EM>&quot;that by
which the effects and consequences of actions and kinds of knowledge
are selected for the use of the soul,&quot; or conscience the
inner Voice in man. With the Yogis, the <EM>Chiti </EM>is a synonym
of <EM>Mahat, </EM>the first and divine intellect; but in Esoteric
philosophy <EM>Mahat </EM>is the root of Chiti, its germ; and
<EM>Chiti </EM>is a quality of <EM>Manas </EM>in conjunction with
Buddhi, a quality that attracts to itself by spiritual affinity
a <EM>Chitkala </EM>when it develops sufficiently in man. This
is why it is said that <EM>Chiti </EM>is a voice acquiring mystic
life and becoming Kwan-Yin.<HR>

It may be interesting, in this connection, to remind the reader
of what Mr. Subba Row said of the Forces -- mystically defined.
See &quot;<EM>Five Years of Theosophy</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>and
&quot;The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac.&quot; Thus he says:
<P>
&quot;Kanya (the sixth sign of the Zodiac, or <EM>Virgo</EM>)<EM>
</EM>means a Virgin, and represents <EM>Sakti or Mahamaya. </EM>The
sign . . . is the 6th <EM>Rasi </EM>or division, and indicates
that there are six primary forces in Nature (synthesized by the
Seventh)&quot; . . . These Sakti stand as follows: -
<P>
(1.) <STRONG>P</STRONG>ARASAKTI. Literally the great or Supreme
Force or power. It means and includes the powers of <EM>light
and heat.</EM> 
<P>
(2.)<STRONG> J</STRONG>NANASAKTI. . . . The power of intellect,
of real Wisdom or Knowledge. It has two aspects:
<P>
The following are <EM>some </EM>of its manifestations <EM>when
placed under the influence or control of material conditions.
</EM>(a) The power of the mind in interpreting our sensations.
(b) Its power in recalling past ideas (memory) and raising future
expectation. (c) Its power as exhibited in what are called by
modern psychologists &quot;the laws of association,&quot; which
enables it to form <EM>persisting </EM>connections between various
groups of sensations and possibilities of sensations, and thus
generate the notion or idea of an external object. (d) Its power
in connecting our ideas together by the mysterious link of memory,
and thus generating the notion of self or individuality; <EM>some
</EM>of its manifestations when liberated <EM>from the bonds of
matter are </EM>-- (<EM>a</EM>) Clairvoyance, (<EM>b</EM>) Psychometry.
<P>
(3.) <STRONG>I</STRONG>TCHASAKTI -- the <EM>power of the Will.
</EM>Its most ordinary manifesta-

* The writers of the above knew perfectly well the physical cause
of the tides, of the waves, etc. It is the informing Spirit of

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 293 THE SEVEN POWERS.</H6>

<P>
tion is the generation of certain nerve currents which set in
motion such muscles as are required for the accomplishment of
the desired object.
<P>
(4.) <STRONG>K</STRONG>RIYASAKTI. The mysterious power of thought
which enables it to produce external, perceptible, phenomenal
results by its own inherent energy. The ancients held that <EM>any
idea will manifest itself externally if one</EM>'<EM>s attention
is deeply concentrated upon it. </EM>Similarly <EM>an intense
volition will be followed by the desired result.</EM> 
<P>
A Yogi generally performs his wonders by means of Itchasakti and
Kriyasakti.
<P>
(5.) <STRONG>K</STRONG>UNDALINI <STRONG>S</STRONG>AKTI. The power
or Force which moves in a curved path. It is the Universal life-Principle
manifesting everywhere in nature. This force includes the two
great forces of attraction and repulsion. Electricity and magnetism
are but manifestations of it. This is the power which brings about
that &quot;continuous adjustment of <EM>internal relations to
external relations</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>which is the essence of
life according to Herbert Spencer, and that &quot;<EM>continuous
adjustment of external relations to internal relations</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>which is the basis of transmigration of souls, <EM>punar
janman </EM>(re-birth) in the doctrines of the ancient Hindu philosophers.
A Yogi must thoroughly subjugate this power before he can attain
Moksham. . . .
<P>
(6.) <STRONG>M</STRONG>ANTRIKA-SAKTI. The force or power of letters,
speech or music. The <EM>Mantra Shastra </EM>has for its subject-matter
this force in all its manifestations......... The influence of
melody is one of its ordinary manifestations. The power of the
ineffable name is the crown of this Sakti.
<P>
Modern Science has but partly investigated the first, second and
fifth of the forces above named, but is altogether in the dark
as regards the remaining powers. The six forces are in their unity
represented by the<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Daiviprakriti</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(the Seventh, the light of the <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS).
<P>
The above is quoted to show the real Hindu ideas on the same.
It is all esoteric, though not covering the tenth part of <EM>what
might be said. </EM>For one, the six names of the Six Forces mentioned
are those of <EM>the six Hierarchies </EM>of Dhyan Chohans synthesized
by their <EM>Primary,</EM> the seventh, who personify the Fifth
Principle of Cosmic Nature, or of the &quot;Mother&quot; in its
Mystical Sense. The enumeration alone of the <EM>yogi </EM>Powers
would require ten volumes. Each of these Forces has a <EM>living
Conscious Entity </EM>at its head, of which entity it is an emanation.

But let us compare with the commentary just cited the words of
Hermes, the &quot;thrice great&quot;:--
<P>
&quot;The creation of Life <EM>by the Sun </EM>is as continuous
as his light; nothing arrests or limits it. Around him, like an
army of Satellites, <EM>are innumerable choirs of genii. </EM>These
dwell in the neighbourhood of the Immortals, and thence watch
over human things. They fulfil the will of the gods (Karma) <EM>by
means of storms, tempests, transitions of fire and earthquakes;
</EM>likewise by famines and wars, for the punishment of impiety.*
. . . It is the sun who preserves and nourishes all creatures;
and even as the Ideal World which environs the sensible world
fills this last with the plenitude and universal variety of forms,
so also the Sun, enfolding all in his light, accomplishes everywhere
the birth and development of creatures.&quot; . . . &quot;<EM>Under
his orders is the choir of Genii, </EM>or rather the choirs, <EM>for
there are many and diverse, and their number corresponds to that
of the stars. Every star has its genii, good and evil by nature,
</EM>or rather by their <EM>operation, for operation is the essence
of the genii. . </EM>. . All these Genii <EM>preside over mundane
affairs,** </EM>they shake and overthrow the constitution of States
and of individuals; they <EM>imprint their likeness on our Souls,
</EM>they are present in our nerves, our marrow, our veins, our
arteries, and <EM>our very brain-substance </EM>. . . at the moment
when each of us receives life and being, he is taken in charge
by the genii (Elementals) who preside over births,*** and who
are classed beneath the astral powers (Superhuman astral Spirits.)
They change perpetually, not always identically, but revolving
in circles.**** They permeate by the body two parts of the Soul,
that it may receive from each the impress of his own energy. But
the reasonable part of the Soul is not subject to the genii; it
is designed

** And &quot;Gods&quot; or Dhyanis, too, not only the genii or
&quot;guided Forces.&quot;
<P>
*** The meaning of this is that as man is composed of all the
Great Elements: Fire, Air, Water, Earth and Ether -- the ELEMENTALS
which belong respectively to these Elements feel attracted to
man by reason of their co-essence. That element which predominates
in a certain constitution will be the ruling element throughout
life. For instance, if man has a preponderance of the Earthly,
gnomic element, the gnomes will lead him towards assimilating
metals -- money and wealth, and so on. &quot;Animal man is the
son of the animal elements out of which his Soul (life) was born,
and animals are the mirrors of man,&quot; says Paracelsus (<EM>De

for the reception of (the) God,* who enlightens it with a sunny
ray. Those who are thus illumined are few in number, and from
them the genii abstain: for neither genii nor Gods have any power
in the presence of a single ray of God.** But all other men, both
soul and body, are directed by genii, to whom they cleave, and
whose operations they affect........... The genii have then the
control of mundane things and our bodies serve them as instruments...........
<P>
The above, save a few sectarian points, represents that which
was a universal belief common to all nations till about a century
or so back. It is still as orthodox in its broad outlines and
features among pagans and Christians alike, if one excepts a handful
of materialists and men of Science.
<P>
For whether one calls the genii of Hermes and his &quot;Gods,&quot;
&quot;Powers of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Angels,&quot; as in the

</EM>or <EM>Djin, </EM>as they are still called in India and Mussulman
countries -- <EM>they are all one and the same thing -- </EM>ILLUSION.
Let not this, however, be misunderstood in the sense into which
the great philosophical doctrine of the Vedantists has been lately
perverted by Western schools.
<P>
All that which <EM>is</EM>, emanates from the ABSOLUTE, which,
from this qualification alone, stands as the one and only reality
-- hence, everything extraneous to this Absolute, the generative
and causative Element, <EM>must </EM>be an illusion, most undeniably.
But this is only so from the purely metaphysical view. A man who
regards himself as mentally sane, and is so regarded by his neighbours,
calls the visions of an <EM>insane </EM>brother -- whose hallucinations
make <EM>the victim either happy or supremely wretched, </EM>as
the case may be -- illusions and fancies likewise. But, where
is that madman for whom the hideous shadows in his deranged mind,
his <EM>illusions, </EM>are not, for the time being, as actual
and as real as the things which his physician or keeper may see?
Everything is relative in this Universe, everything is an illusion.

the experience of any plane is an actuality for the percipient
being, whose consciousness is on that plane; though the said experience,
regarded from the purely metaphysical standpoint, may be conceived
to have no objective reality. But it is not against metaphysicians,
but against physicists and materialists that Esoteric teachings
have to fight, and for these Vital Force, Light, Sound, Electricity,
even to the objectively pulling force of magnetism, have no objective
being, and are said to exist merely as &quot;modes of motion,&quot;
&quot;sensations and <EM>affections </EM>of matter.&quot;
<P>
Neither the Occultists generally, nor the Theosophists, reject,
as erroneously believed by some, the views and theories of the
modern scientists, only because these views are opposed to Theosophy.
The first rule of our Society is to render unto Caesar what is
Caesar's. The Theosophists, therefore, are the first to recognize
the intrinsic value of science. But when its high priests resolve
consciousness into a secretion from the grey matter of the brain,
and everything else in nature into a mode of motion, we protest
against the doctrine as being unphilosophical, self-contradictory,
and simply absurd, from a <EM>scientific </EM>point of view, as
much and even more than from the occult aspect of the esoteric
knowledge.
<P>
For truly the astral light of the derided Kabalists has strange
and weird secrets for him who can see in it; and the mysteries
concealed within its incessantly disturbed waves <EM>are there,

* The astral light of the Kabalists is very incorrectly translated
by some &quot;AEther;&quot; the latter is confused with the hypothetical
Ether of Science, and both are referred to by some theosophists
as synonymous with <EM>Akasa. </EM>This is a great mistake.
<P>
&quot;A characteristic of Akasa will serve to show how inadequately
it is represented by Ether,&quot; writes the author of Rational
Refutations, thus unconsciously helping Occultism. &quot;In dimension
it is infinite; it is not made up of parts; and colour, taste,
smell, and tangibility do not appertain to it. So far forth it
corresponds exactly to time, space, <EM>Isvara, </EM>(&quot;The
Lord,&quot; but rather creative potency and soul -- <EM>anima
mundi</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Its speciality, as compared therewith, consists
in its being the <EM>material cause of sound. </EM>Except for
its being so, one might take it to be one with vacuity&quot; (<EM>p</EM>.

<P>
It is <EM>vacuity, </EM>no doubt, especially for Rationalists.
At any rate Akasa is sure to produce vacuity in the brain of a
materialist. Nevertheless, though Akasa is not that Ether of Science,
not even the Ether of the Occultist, who defines the latter as
one of the principles of Akasa only, it is as certainly, together
with its primary, the cause of sound, only a physical and spiritual,
not a material cause by any means. The relations [[fn continued]]

many other mysteries, will remain non-existent to the materialists
of our age, in the same way as America was a non-existent myth
for Europeans during the early part of the mediaeval ages, whereas
Scandinavians and Norwegians had actually reached and settled
in that very old &quot;New World&quot; several centuries before.
But, as a Columbus was born to re-discover, and to force the Old
World to believe in Antipodal countries, so will there be born
scientists who will discover the marvels now claimed by Occultists
to exist in the regions of Ether, with their varied and multiform
denizens and conscious Entities. Then, <EM>nolens volens, </EM>Science
will have to accept the old &quot;Superstition,&quot; as it has
several others. And having been once forced to accept it -- judging
from past experience -- its learned professors will, in all probability,
as in the case of <STRONG>M</STRONG>ESMERISM and Magnetism, now
re-baptised Hypnotism, father the thing and reject its name. The
choice of the new appellation will depend, in its turn, on the
&quot;modes of motion,&quot; the new name for the older &quot;automatic
physical processes among the nerve fibrils of the (Scientific)
brain&quot; of Moleschott; as also, very likely, upon the last
meal of the namer; since, according to the Founder of the new
Hylo-Idealistic Scheme, &quot;Cerebration is generically the same
as chylification.&quot;* Thus, were one to believe this preposterous
proposition, the new name of the archaic thing would have to take
its chance, on the inspiration of the namer's liver, and then
only would these truths have a chance of becoming scientific!
<P>
But TRUTH, however distasteful to the generally blind majorities,
has always had her champions, ready to die for her, and it is
not the Occultists who will protest against its adoption by Science
under whatever new name. But, until absolutely forced on the notice
and acceptance of Scientists, many an Occult truth will be tabooed,
as the phenomena of the Spiritualists and other psychic manifestations
were, to be finally appropriated by its ex-traducers without the
least acknowledgment or thanks. Nitrogen has added considerably
to chemical knowledge, but its discoverer, Paracelsus, is to this
day called a &quot;quack.&quot;

How profoundly true are the words of H. T. Buckle, in his admirable
&quot;<EM>History of Civilization</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(Vol. <EM>
</EM>I., p. 256), when he says: -
<P>
&quot;Owing to circumstances still unknown (Karmic provision,
H.P.B.) there appear from time to time great thinkers, who, devoting
their lives to a single purpose, are able to anticipate the progress
of mankind, and to produce a religion or a philosophy by which
important effects are eventually brought about. But if we look
into history we shall clearly see that, although the origin of
a new opinion may be thus due to a single man, the result which
the new opinion produces will depend on the condition of the people
among whom it is propagated. If either a religion or a philosophy
is too much in advance of a nation it can do no present service
but must bide its time* until the minds of men are ripe for its
reception. . . . Every science, every creed has had its martyrs.
<EM>According to the ordinary course of affairs, a few generations
pass away, and then there comes a period when these very truths
are looked upon as commonplace facts, and a little later there

It is barely possible that the minds of the present generations
are not quite ripe for the reception of Occult truths. Such will
be the retrospect furnished to the advanced thinkers of the Sixth
Root Race of the history of the acceptance of Esoteric Philosophy
-- fully and unconditionally. Meanwhile the generations of our
Fifth Race will continue to be led away by prejudice and preconceptions.
Occult Sciences will have the finger of scorn pointed at them
from every street corner, and everyone will seek to ridicule and
crush them in the name, and for the greater glory, of Materialism
and its so-called Science. The Addendum which completes the present
Book shows, however, in an anticipatory answer to several of the
forthcoming Scientific objections, the true and mutual positions
of the defendant and plaintiff. The Theosophists and Occultists
stand arraigned by public opinion, which still holds high the
banner of the inductive Sciences. The latter have, then, to be
examined; and it must be shown how far their achievements and
discoveries in the realm of natural laws are opposed, not so much
to our claims, as to the facts in nature. The hour has now struck
to ascertain whether the

walls of the modern Jericho are so impregnable that no blast of
the Occult trumpet is ever likely to make them crumble.

The so-called <EM>Forces, </EM>with Light and Electricity heading
them, and the constitution of the Solar orb must be carefully
examined; as also Gravitation and the Nebular theories. The Natures
of Ether and of other Elements must be discussed: thus contrasting
scientific with other Occult teachings, while revealing some of
the hitherto secret tenets of the latter. (<EM>Vide Addendum.</EM>)

Some fifteen years ago, the writer was the first to repeat, after
the Kabalists, the wise Commandments in the Esoteric Catechism.
&quot;Close thy mouth, lest thou shouldst speak of <EM>this </EM>(the
mystery), and thy heart, lest thou shouldst think aloud; and if
thy heart has escaped thee, bring it back to its place, for such
is the object of our alliance.&quot; (<EM>Sepher Jezireh, Book
of Creation.</EM>)<EM> </EM>And again: -- &quot;This is a secret
which gives death: close thy mouth lest thou shouldst reveal it
to the vulgar; compress thy brain lest something should escape
from it and fall outside.&quot; (Rules of Initiation.)

A few years later, a corner of the Veil of Isis had to be lifted;
and now another and a larger rent is made. . . .

But old and time-honoured errors -- such as become with every
day more glaring and self-evident -- stand arrayed in battle-order
now, as they did then. Marshalled by blind conservatism, conceit
and prejudice, they are constantly on the watch, ready to strangle
every truth, which, awakening from its age-long sleep, happens
to knock for admission. Such has been the case ever since man
became an animal. That this proves in every case <EM>moral death
</EM>to the revealers, who bring to light any of these old, old
truths, is as certain as that it gives LIFE and REGENERATION to
those who are fit to profit even by the little that is now revealed
to them.
