<H4>PROMETHEUS, THE TITAN.</H4>

<H5><STRONG>H</STRONG>IS <STRONG>O</STRONG>RIGIN IN <STRONG>A</STRONG>NCIENT
<STRONG>I</STRONG>NDIA.</H5>

<P>
<STRONG>I</STRONG>N our modern day there does not exist the slightest
doubt in the minds of the best European symbologists that the
name Prometheus possessed the greatest and most mysterious significance
in antiquity. While giving the history of Deukalion, whom the
Boeotians regarded as the ancestor of the human races, and who
was the Son of Prometheus, according to the significant legend,
the author of the <EM>Mythologie</EM> <EM>de la Grece Antique
</EM>remarks: &quot;Thus Prometheus is something more than the
archetype of humanity; he is <EM>its generator. </EM>In the same
way that we saw Hephaestus moulding the first woman (Pandora)
and endowing her with life, so Prometheus kneads the moist clay,
of which he fashions the body of the first man whom he will endow
with the soul-spark&quot; (<EM>Apollodorus, </EM>I., 7, 1). After
the Flood of Deukalion, Zeus, it was taught, had commanded Prometheus
and Athena to call forth a new race of men from the mire left
by the waters of the deluge (<EM>Ovid</EM>, <EM>Metam. </EM>1,
81. <EM> Etym. M. </EM><I>v</I>. [[<I>Prometheus</I>]]); and in
the day of Pausanias the slime which the hero had used for this
purpose was still shown in Phocea (<EM>Paus. </EM>x, 4, 4). &quot;On
several archaic monuments one still sees Prometheus modelling
a human body, either alone or with Athena's help&quot; (<EM>Myth.
Grece Ant. 246</EM>)<EM>.</EM> 
<P>
The same authors remind the world of another equally mysterious
personage, though one less generally known than Prometheus, whose
legend offers remarkable analogies with that of the Titan. The
name of this second ancestor and generator is <EM>Phoroneus, </EM>the
hero of an ancient poem, now unfortunately no longer extant --
the<EM> Phoronidae. </EM>His legend was localized in Argolis,
where a perpetual flame was preserved on his altar as a reminder
that he was the bringer of fire upon earth (<EM>Pausanias,</EM>
11, 19, 5;<EM> Cf. </EM>20<EM>, </EM>3.) A benefactor of men as
Prometheus was, he had made them participators of every bliss
on earth. Plato (<EM>Timaeus, p. </EM>22)<EM>,</EM> and Clemens
Alexandrinus (<EM>Strom.</EM> 1<EM>, p. </EM>380) say that Phoroneus
was the first man, or &quot;the father of mortals.&quot; His genealogy,
which assigns to him as his father Inachos, the river, reminds
one of that of Prometheus, which makes that Titan the son of the
Oceanid Clymene. But the mother of Phoroneus was the nymph Melia;
a significant descent which distinguishes him from Prometheus.
<P>
Melia, Decharme thinks, is the personification of the <EM>ash-tree,
</EM>whence,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 520 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
according to Hesiod, issued the race of the age of Bronze* (<EM>Opera
et</EM> <EM>Dies, </EM>142-145); and which with the Greeks is
the <EM>celestial tree </EM>common to every Aryan mythology. This
<EM>ash </EM>is the Yggdrasil of the Norse antiquity, which the
Norns sprinkle daily with the waters from the fountain of Urd,
that it may not wither. It remains verdant till the last days
of the Golden Age. Then the Norns -- the three sisters who gaze
respectively into the Past, the Present, and the Future -- make
known the decree of Fate (<EM>Karma, Orlog</EM>)<EM>, </EM>but
men are conscious only of the Present. But when Gultweig comes
(the golden ore) &quot;the bewitching enchantress who, thrice
cast into the fire, arises each time more beautiful, and fills
the souls of gods and men with unapproachable longing, then the
Norns . . . enter into being, and the blessed peace of childhood's
dreams passes away, and Sin comes into existence with all its
evil consequences . . .&quot; and <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA (<EM>See
&quot;Asgard and the Gods,&quot; p. </EM>10-12)<EM>. </EM>The
thrice purified Gold is -<EM>- Manas, </EM>the Conscious Soul.
<P>
With the Greeks, the &quot;ash-tree&quot; represented the same
idea. Its luxuriant boughs are the sidereal heaven, golden by
day and studded with stars by night -- the fruits of Melia and
Yggdrasil, under whose protecting shadow humanity lived during
the Golden Age without desire as without any fear . . . . &quot;That
tree had a fruit, or an inflamed bough, <EM>which was lightning,&quot;
</EM>Decharme guesses.
<P>
And here steps in the killing materialism of the age; that peculiar
twist in the modern mind, which, like a Northern blast, bends
all on its way, and freezes every intuition, allowing it no hand
in the physical speculations of the day. After having seen in
Prometheus no better than <EM>fire by friction, </EM>the learned
author of the <EM>&quot;Mythologie de la Grece</EM> <EM>Antique&quot;
</EM>perceives in this &quot;fruit&quot; a trifle <EM>more than
an allusion to</EM> <EM>terrestrial fire and its discovery. It
is no longer fire, owing to the fall of</EM> <EM>lightning setting
some dry fuel in a blaze, </EM>and thus revealing all its priceless
benefits to Palaeolithic men; -- but something more mysterious
this time, though still as earthly. . . . &quot;A divine bird,
nestled in the boughs of the celestial ash-tree, stole that bough
(or the fruit) and carried it down on the earth in its bill. Now
the Greek word [[<I>Phoroneus</I>]] is the rigid equivalent of
the Sanskrit word <EM>bhuranyu </EM>('the rapid') an epithet of
Agni, considered as the carrier of the divine spark. Phoroneus,
son of <EM>Melia </EM>or of the celestial ash, thus corresponds
to a conception far more ancient, probably, than that one which
transformed the <EM>pramantha </EM>(of the old Aryan Hindus) into
the Greek Prometheus. Phoroneus is the

<P>
* According to the Occult teaching, three yugas passed away during
the time of the Third Root-Race,<EM> i.e</EM>., the Satya, the
Treta, and the Dvapara yuga, answering to the golden age of its
early innocence: to the silver -- when it reached its maturity:
and to the Bronze age, when, separating into sexes, they became
the mighty demi-gods of old.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 521 THE POETRY OF MODERN ORIENTALISTS. </H6>

<P>
(personified) bird, that brings the heavenly lightning to the
Earth. Traditions relating to the birth and origin of the race
of Bronze, and those which made of Phoroneus the father of the
Argians, are an evidence to us that this thunderbolt (or lightning),
as in the legends of Hephaestus or Prometheus, was the origin
of the human race&quot; (266).
<P>
This still affords us no more than the external meaning of the
symbols and the allegory. It is now supposed that the name of
Prometheus has been unriddled, and the modern mythologists and
Orientalists see in it no longer what their fathers saw on the
authority of the whole of classical antiquity. They only find
therein something far more appropriate to the spirit of the age,
namely, a phallic element. But the name of Phoroneus, as well
as that of Prometheus, bears not one, nor even two, but a series
of esoteric meanings. Both relate to the <EM>seven</EM> <EM>celestial
fires; </EM>to Agni Abhimanin, his three sons, and their forty-five
sons,<EM> constituting the forty-nine fires. </EM>Do all these
numbers relate only to the terrestrial mode of fire and to the
flame of sexual passion? Did the Hindu Aryan mind never soar above
such purely sensual conceptions? that mind which is declared by
Prof. Max Muller to be the most spiritual and mystically inclined
on the whole globe? The number of those fires alone ought to have
suggested an inkling of the truth.
<P>
We are told that one is no longer permitted, in this age of rational
thought, to explain the name of Prometheus as the old Greeks did.
The latter, it seems, &quot;basing themselves on the false analogy
of [[<I>prometheus</I>]] with the verb [[<I>Promanthanein</I>]]<EM>,
</EM>saw in him the type of the 'foreseeing' man, to whom, for
the sake of symmetry, a brother was added -- Epimetheus, or 'he
who takes counsel <EM>after </EM>the event.' &quot; But now the
Orientalists have decided otherwise. They know the real meaning
of the two names better than those who invented them.
<P>
The legend is based upon an event of universal importance. It
was built &quot;to commemorate a great event which must have strongly
impressed itself upon the imagination of the first witnesses to
it, and its remembrance has never since faded out from popular
memory.&quot; What is it? Laying aside every poetical <EM>fiction,
</EM>all those dreams of the golden age, let us imagine -- argue
the modern scholars -- in all its gross realism, the first miserable
state of humanity, the striking picture of which was traced for
us after AEschylus by Lucretius, and the exact truth of which
is now confirmed by science; and then one may understand better
that a new life really began for man, on that day when he saw
the first spark produced by the friction of two pieces of wood,
or from the veins of a flint. How could man help feeling gratitude
to that mysterious and marvellous being which they were henceforth
enabled to create at their will, and which was no sooner born,
than it grew and expanded, developing with singular power. &quot;This
terrestrial flame,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 522 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
was it not analogous in nature to that one which they received
from above, or that other which frightened them in the thunderbolt?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Was it not derived from the same source? And if its origin
was in heaven, it must have been brought down some day on earth.
If so, who was the powerful being, the beneficent being, god or
man, who had conquered it? Such are the questions which the curiosity
of the Aryans offered in the early days of their existence, and
which found their answer in the myth of Prometheus&quot;; (<EM>Mythologie
de la Grece</EM> <EM>Antique, </EM>p. 258).
<P>
The philosophy of Occult Science finds two weak points in the
above reflections, and points them out. The miserable state of
Humanity described by AEschylus and Prometheus was no more wretched
then, in the early days of the Aryans, than it is now. That &quot;state&quot;
was limited to the savage tribes; and the now-existing savages
are not a whit more happy or unhappy than their forefathers were
a million years ago.
<P>
It is an accepted fact in Science that &quot;rude implements,
exactly resembling those in use <EM>among existing savages,&quot;
</EM>are found in river-gravels and caves geologically &quot;implying
an enormous antiquity.&quot; So great is that resemblance that,
as the author of &quot;The Modern Zoroastrian&quot; tells us:
&quot;If the collection in the Colonial Exhibition of stone celts
and arrow-heads used now by the Bushmen of South Africa were placed
side by side with one from the British Museum of similar objects
from Kent's Cavern or the Caves of Dordogne, no one but an expert
could distinguish between them&quot; (<EM>p</EM>. 145). And if
there are Bushmen existing now, in our age of the highest civilization,
who are no higher intellectually than the race of men which inhabited
Devonshire and Southern France during the <EM>Palaeolithic </EM>age,
why could not the latter have lived simultaneously with, and have
been the contemporary of, other races as highly civilized for
their day as we are for ours? That the sum of knowledge increases
daily in mankind, &quot;but that intellectual capacity does not
increase with it,&quot; is shown when the intellect, if not the
physical knowledge, of the Euclids, Pythagorases, Paninis, Kapilas,
Platos, and Socrates, is compared with that of the Newtons, Kants,
and the modern Huxleys and Haeckels. On comparing the results
obtained by Dr. J. Barnard Davis, the Craniologist, worked out
in 1868 (<EM>Trans. of the Royal Society</EM> <EM>of London</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>with regard to the internal capacity of the skull -- its
volume being taken as the standard and test for judging of the
intellectual capacities -- Dr. Pfaff finds that this capacity
among the French (certainly in the highest rank of mankind) is
88.4 cubic inches, being thus &quot;perceptibly smaller than that
of the Polynesians generally, which, even among many Papuans and
Alfuras of the lowest grade, amounts to 89 and 89.7 cubic inches&quot;;
which shows that it is the <EM>quality </EM>and not the <EM>quantity
</EM>of the brain that is the cause of intellectual capacity.

average index of skulls among various races having been now recognized
to be &quot;one of the most characteristic marks of difference
between different races,&quot; the following comparison is suggestive:
&quot;The index of breadth among the Scandinavians (is) at 75:
among the English at 76; among Holsteiners at 77; in Bresgau at
80; Schiller's skull shows an index of breadth even of 82 . .
. the Madurese also 82!&quot; Finally, the same comparison between
the oldest skulls known and the European, brings to light the
startling fact <EM>&quot;that most of these old skulls, belonging
to the</EM> <EM>stone period, are above rather than below the
average of the brain of the</EM> <EM>now living man in volume.&quot;
</EM>Calculating the measures for the height, breadth, and length
in inches from the average measurements of several skulls, the
following sums are obtained: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Old Northern skulls of the stone age . . . . 18.877 ins.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Average of 48 skulls of the same period from England . . .

&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The average of the <EM>now living Europeans </EM>is 18.579 inches;
of <EM>Hottentots, </EM>17.795 inches!
<P>
Which figures show plainly &quot;that the size of the brain of
the oldest populations known to us is not such as to place them
on a lower level than that of the now living inhabitants of the
Earth&quot; (&quot;<EM>The Age and</EM> <EM>Origin of Man</EM>&quot;).<EM>
</EM>Besides which, they show the &quot;missing link&quot; vanishing
into thin air. Of these, however, more anon: we must return to
our direct subject.
<P>
The race which Jupiter so ardently desired &quot;to quench, and
plant a new one in its stead&quot; (<EM>AEsch.* </EM>241), suffered
<EM>mental</EM>, not physical misery. The first boon Prometheus
gave to mortals, as he tells the &quot;Chorus,&quot; was to hinder
them &quot;from <EM>foreseeing </EM>death&quot; (256); he &quot;saved
the mortal race from sinking blasted down to Hades' gloom&quot;
(244); and then only, &quot;besides&quot; that, he gave them fire
(260). This shows plainly the dual character, at any rate of the
Promethean myth, if Orientalists will not accept the existence
of the <EM>seven keys </EM>taught in Occultism. This relates to
the first opening of man's spiritual perceptions, not to his first
seeing or<EM> discovering </EM><I>fire</I>. For <EM>fire</EM>
was never &quot;discovered,&quot; but existed on earth since its
beginning. It existed in the seismic activity of the early ages,
volcanic eruptions being as frequent and constant in those periods
as fog is in England now. And if we are told that men appeared
so late on Earth that nearly all the volcanoes, with the exception
of a few, were already extinct, and that geological disturbances
had made room for a more settled state of things, we answer: Let
a new race of men -- whether evolved from angel or gorilla --
appear now on any uninhabited

spot of the globe, with the exception perhaps of the Sahara, and
a thousand to one it would not be a year or two old before discovering
fire, through the fall of lightning setting in flames grass or
something else. This assumption, that primitive man lived ages
on earth before he was made acquainted with fire, is one of the
most painfully illogical of all. But old AEschylus was an initiate,
and knew well what he was giving out.*
<P>
No occultist acquainted with symbology and the fact that Wisdom
came to us from the East, will deny for a moment that the myth
of Prometheus has reached Europe from Aryavarta. Nor is he likely
to deny that in one sense Prometheus represents <EM>fire by friction</EM>.
Therefore, he admires the sagacity of M. F. Baudry, who shows
in his <EM>Les Mythes</EM> <EM>du feu et breuvage celeste </EM>(<EM>Revue
germanique, </EM>1861<EM> p</EM>. 356)** one of the aspects of
Prometheus and his origin from India. He shows the reader the<EM>
supposed </EM>primitive process to obtain fire, still in use to-day
in India to light the sacrificial flame. This is what he says:
--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;This process, such as it is minutely described in the Vedic
Sutras, consists in rapidly turning a stick in a socket made in
the centre of a piece of wood. The friction develops intense heat
and ends by setting on fire the particles of wood in contact.
The motion of the stick is not a continuous rotation, but a series
of motions in contrary senses, by means of a cord fixed to the
stick in its middle: the operator holds one of the ends in each
hand and pulls them alternately. . . . The full process is designated
in Sanskrit by the verb manthami, mathnani; which means 'to rub,
agitate, shake and obtain by rubbing,' and is especially applied
to rotatory friction, as proved by its derivation from <EM>mandala,
</EM>which signifies a circle. . . . The pieces of wood serving
for the production of fire have each their name in Sanskrit. The
stick which turns is called <EM>pramantha; </EM>the discus which
receives it is called <EM>arani </EM><I>and</I><EM> aran&icirc;</EM><I>
</I>two aranis' designating the <EM>ensemble </EM>of the instrument&quot;

It remains to be seen what the Brahmins will say to this. But

* The modern attempt of some Greek scholars (poor and pseudo scholars,
they would have appeared in the day of the old Greek writers!)
to explain the real meaning of the ideas of AEschylus, which,
being an ignorant ancient Greek, he could not express so well
himself, is absurdly ludicrous!

*** There is the <EM>upper</EM> and <EM>nether</EM> piece of timber
used to produce this sacred fire by attrition at sacrifices, and
it is the <EM>aran&icirc; </EM>which contains the socket. This
is proven by an allegory in the <EM>Vayu Purana </EM>and others,
which tell us that Nemi, the son of Ikshwaku, had left no successor,
and that the Rishis, fearing to leave the earth without a ruler,
introduced the king's body into the socket of an <EM>aran&icirc;
</EM>-- like an upper <EM>aran&icirc; </EM>-- and produced from
it a prince named Janaka. &quot;It was by reason of the peculiar
way in which he was engendered that he was called Janaka.&quot;

<P>
myth as the producer of fire by means of <EM>pramantha, </EM>or
as an animate and divine <EM>pramantha, </EM>would this imply
that the symbolism had no other than the phallic meaning attributed
to it by the modern symbologists? Decharme, at any rate, seems
to have a correct glimmering of the truth; for he unconsciously
corroborates by his remarks all that the Occult sciences teach
with regard to the <EM>Manasa </EM>Devas, who have endowed man
with the consciousness of his immortal soul: that consciousness
which hinders man &quot;from foreseeing death,&quot; and makes
him <EM>know </EM>he is immortal.* &quot;How has Prometheus got
into the possession of the (divine) spark?&quot; he asks. &quot;Fire
having its abode in heaven, it is there he must have gone to find
it before he could carry it down to men, and, to approach the
gods, he must have been a god himself.&quot; The Greeks held that
he was of the <EM>divine </EM>race; the Hindus, that he was a
Deva. Hence &quot;with the Greeks he was the son of the Titan
lapetos,&quot; [[<I>Iapetonides</I>]] (<EM>Theog. </EM>528) .
. . . &quot;But celestial fire belonged in the beginning to the
gods alone; it was a treasure they reserved for themselves . .
. over which they jealously watched . . . 'The prudent son of
Iapetus,' says Hesiod, 'deceived Jupiter by stealing and concealing
in the cavity of a narthex, the indefatigable fire of the resplendent
glow' (<EM>Theog. </EM>565)<EM> </EM>. . . Thus the gift made
by Prometheus to men was a conquest made from heaven. . . &quot;
&quot;Now according to Greek ideas,&quot; (identical in this with
those of the Occultists) &quot;this possession forced from Jupiter,
this human trespassing upon the property of the gods, had to be
followed by an expiation. . . . Prometheus, moreover, belongs
to that race of Titans who had rebelled** against the gods, and
whom the master of Olympus had hurled down into Tartarus; like
them, he is the genius of Evil, doomed to cruel suffering, etc.,
etc.&quot;
<P>
That which is revolting in the explanations that follow, is the
one-sided view taken of this grandest of all the myths. The most
intuitional among modern writers cannot or will not rise in their
conceptions above the level of the Earth and Cosmic phenomena.
It is not denied that the moral idea in the myth, as presented
in the Theogony of Hesiod, plays a certain part in the primitive
Greek conception. The Titan is more than a thief of the celestial
fire. He is the representation of humanity -- active, industrious,
intelligent, but at the same time ambitious, which aims at equalling
divine powers. Therefore it is humanity punished in the person
of Prometheus, but it is only so with the Greeks. With the latter,
Prometheus is not a

criminal, save in the eyes of the gods. In his relation with the
Earth, he is, on the contrary, a god himself, a friend of mankind
([[<I>philanthropos</I>]]), which he has raised to civilization
and initiated into the knowledge of all the arts; a conception
which found its most poetical expounder in AEschylus. But with
all other nations Prometheus is -- what? The fallen Angel, Satan,
as the Church would have it? Not at all. <EM>He is</EM> <EM>simply
the image of the pernicious and dreaded effects of lightning.
</EM>He is the &quot;evil fire&quot; (<EM>mal feu</EM>)<EM> and
the symbol of the divine reproductive</EM> <EM>male organ. </EM>&quot;Reduced
to its simple expression, the myth we are trying to explain is
then simply a (Cosmic) genius of fire&quot; (p. 261). It is the
former idea (the phallic) which was <EM>pre-eminently Aryan, </EM>if
we believe Ad. Kuhn (<EM>in his Herabkunft des Feuers und des
Gottertranks</EM>)<EM> </EM>and Baudry. For --
<P>
&quot;The fire used by man being the result of the action of <EM>pramantha</EM>
in the <EM>arani, </EM>the Aryas <EM>must have </EM>ascribed (?)
the same origin to celestial fire, and they <EM>must* have </EM>imagined
(?) that a god armed with pramantha, or a divine pramantha, exercised
in the bosom of the clouds a violent friction, which gave birth
to lightning and thunderbolts. . . . . This idea is supported
by the fact that, according to Plutarch's testimony (<EM>Philosoph.
Plant.,</EM> iii<EM>. </EM>3), the Stoics thought that thunder
was the result of the struggle of storm-clouds and lightning --
a conflagration due to friction; while Aristotle saw in the thunderbolt
only the action of clouds which clashed with each other. What
was this theory, if not the scientific translation of the production
of fire by friction? . . . . . . Everything leads us to think
that, from the highest antiquity, and before the dispersion of
the Aryans, it was believed that the pramantha lighted fire in
the storm cloud as well as in the aranis.&quot; (<EM>Revue Germanique,
p. </EM>368.)
<P>
Thus, suppositions and idle hypotheses are made to stand for discovered
truths. Defenders of the Bible dead-letter could never help the
writers of missionary tracts more effectually, than do materialistic
Symbologists in thus taking for granted that the ancient Aryans
based their religious conceptions on no higher thought than the
physiological.
<P>
But it is not so, and the very spirit of Vedic philosophy is against
such an interpretation. And if, as Decharme himself confesses,
&quot;this idea of the creative power of fire is explained at
once by the ancient assimilation of the human soul to a celestial
spark,&quot; as shown by the imagery often made use of in the
Vedas when speaking of <EM>Arani, </EM>it would mean something
higher than simply a gross sexual conception. A hymn to Agni in
the Veda is cited as example: -- &quot;Here is the pramantha,
the generator is ready. Bring the mistress of the race (the female
<EM>Arani</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Let us produce Agni by attrition, according

<P>
to ancient custom&quot; -- which means no worse than an abstract
idea expressed in the tongue of mortals. The &quot;female Arani,&quot;
the mistress of the race, is Aditi, the mother of the gods, or
Shekinah, eternal light -- in the world of Spirit, the &quot;Great
Deep&quot; and <STRONG>C</STRONG>HAOS; or primordial Substance
in its first remove from the <STRONG>U</STRONG>NKNOWN, in the
manifested Kosmos. If, ages later, the same epithet is applied
to Devaki, the mother of Krishna, or the incarnated <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS;
and if the symbol, owing to the gradual and irrepressible spread
of exoteric religions, may already be regarded as having a sexual
significance, this in no way mars the original purity of the image.
The subjective had been transformed into the objective; Spirit
had fallen into matter. The universal kosmic polarity of Spirit-Substance
had become, in human thought, the mystic, but still sexual union
of Spirit and Matter, and had thus acquired an anthropomorphic
colouring which it had never had in the beginning. Between the
Vedas and the Puranas there is an abyss of which both are the
poles, like the seventh (<EM>atmic</EM>) and the first or lowest
principle (the physical body) in the Septenary constitution of
man. The primitive, purely spiritual language of the Vedas, conceived
many decades of millenniums earlier, had found its purely human
expression for the purpose of describing events taking place 5,000
years ago, the date of Krishna's death (from which day the Kali
Yuga, or Black-Age, began for mankind).
<P>
As Aditi is called <EM>Surarani </EM>(the matrix or &quot;mother&quot;
of the <EM>sura </EM>gods), so Kunti, the mother of the Pandavas,
is called in Mahabharata <EM>Pandavarani</EM> -- which term is
already <EM>physiologized. </EM>But Devaki, the antetype of the
Roman Catholic Madonna, is a later anthropomorphized form of Aditi.
The latter is the goddess mother, the &quot;Deva-matri&quot; of
Seven Sons (the <EM>six </EM>and the <EM>seven</EM> Adityas of
early Vedic times); the mother of Krishna, Devaki, has six embryos
conveyed into her womb by Jagaddhatri (the &quot;nurse of the
world&quot;), the seventh (Krishna, the Logos,) being transferred
to that Rohini. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the mother of seven
children, of five sons and two daughters, (a later transformation
of sex) in Matthew's Gospel (<EM>xiii.</EM> 55-56). No one of
the worshippers of the Roman Catholic Virgin would object to reciting
in her honour the prayer addressed by the gods to Devaki. Let
the reader judge.
<P>
&quot;Thou art that Prakriti (essence), infinite and subtile,
which bore Brahma in its womb. Thou eternal being, comprising
in thy substance the essence of all created things, wast identical
with creation; thou wast the parent of the triform sacrifice,
becoming the germ of all. . . . Thou art sacrifice, whence all
fruit proceeds; thou art the <EM>arani</EM> whose attrition engenders
fire&quot; . . . . (&quot;Womb of Light,&quot; &quot;holy Vessel,&quot;
are the epithets of the Virgin). &quot;As Aditi, thou art the
parent of the gods. . . . Thou art Jyotsna (the morning twilight).&quot;
The Virgin<HR>

<P>
is often addressed as the &quot;morning Star&quot; and the &quot;star
of Salvation&quot; -- the light whence day is begotten. &quot;Thou
art <EM>Samnati </EM>(humility, a daughter of Daksha), the mother
of Wisdom; thou art <EM>Niti, </EM>the parent of harmony (<EM>Naya</EM>)<EM>;
</EM>thou art modesty, the progenitrix of affection (<EM>Prasraya
or vinaya</EM>); thou art desire, of whom love is born. . . .
Thou art the mother of knowledge (<EM>Avabodha</EM>); patience
(<EM>Dhriti</EM>)<EM>, </EM>the parent of fortitude (<EM>Dhairya</EM>)<EM>
</EM>. . . . etc., etc.&quot;
<P>
Thus <EM>arani </EM>is shown here as the Roman Catholic &quot;vase
of election&quot; and no worse. As to its primitive meaning, it
was purely metaphysical. No unclean thought traversed these conceptions
in the ancient mind. Even in the <EM>Zohar -- </EM>far less metaphysical
than any other symbolism -- the idea is an abstraction and nothing
more. Thus, when the <EM>Zohar</EM> (iii., 290) says: &quot;All
that which exists, all that which has been formed by the ancient,
whose name is holy, can only exist through a male and female principle,&quot;
it means no more than this: &quot;The divine Spirit of Life is
ever coalescing with matter.&quot; It is the <STRONG>W</STRONG>ILL
of the Deity that acts; and the idea is purely Schopenhauerian.
&quot;When <EM>Atteekah Kaddosha, </EM>the ancient and the concealed
of the concealed, desired to form all things, it formed all things
like male and female. This wisdom cornprises ALL when it goeth
forth.&quot; Hence Chochmah (male wisdom) and Binah (female consciousness
or Intellect) are said to create all between the two -- the active
and the passive principles. As the eye of the expert jeweller
discerns under the rough and uncouth oyster shell the pure immaculate
pearl, enshrined within its bosom, his hand dealing with the former
but to get at its contents, so the eye of the true philosopher
reads between the lines of the Puranas the sublime Vedic truths,
and corrects the form with the help of the Vedantic wisdom. Our
Orientalists, however, never perceive the pearl under the thick
coating of the shell, and -- act accordingly.
<P>
From all that has been said in this section, one sees clearly
that, between the Serpent of Eden and the Devil of Christianity,
there is an abyss. Alone the sledge hammer of ancient philosophy
can kill this dogma.
