THE MASKS OF SCIENCE.</H4>

<P>
PHYSICS OR METAPHYSICS?
<P>
<STRONG>I</STRONG>F there is anything on earth like progress,
Science will some day have to give up, <EM>nolens volens</EM>,<EM>
</EM>such monstrous ideas as her physical, self-guiding <EM>laws</EM>
--<EM> </EM>void of soul and Spirit, -- and then turn to the occult
teachings.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 507 ACADEMICAL MISNOMERS.</H6>

<P>
It has done so already, however altered are the title-page and
revised editions of the Scientific Catechism. It is now over half
a century since, in comparing modern with ancient thought, it
has been found that, however different our philosophy may appear
from that of our ancestors, it is, nevertheless, composed only
<EM>of additions </EM>and<EM> subtractions </EM>taken from the
old philosophy and <EM>transmitted drop by drop through the filter
of antecedents.</EM> 
<P>
This fact was well known to Faraday, and other eminent men of
Science. Atoms, Ether, evolution itself -- all comes to modern
Science from ancient notions, all is based on the conceptions
of the archaic nations. &quot;Conceptions&quot; for the profane,
under the shape of allegories; plain truths taught during the
Initiations to the elect, which truths have been partially divulged
through Greek writers and have descended to us. This does not
mean that Occultism has ever had the same views on matter, atoms
and ether as found in the exotericism of the classical Greek writers.
Yet, if we believe Mr. Tyndall, even Faraday was an Aristotelean,
and an Agnostic more than a materialist. In his &quot;Faraday,
as a Discoverer&quot; (p. 123) the author shows the great physicist
<EM>using </EM>&quot;old reflections of Aristotle&quot; which
are &quot;concisely found in some of his works.&quot; Faraday,
Boscovitch, and all others, however, who see, in the atoms and
molecules, &quot;centres of force,&quot; and in the corresponding
<EM>element force</EM>,<EM> </EM>an ENTITY BY ITSELF, are far
nearer the truth, perchance, than those, who, denouncing them,
denounce at the same time the &quot;old corpuscular Pythagorean
theory&quot; (one, by the way, which has never passed to posterity
as the great philosopher <I>really </I>taught it), on the ground
of its &quot;delusion that the conceptual elements of matter <EM>can
be grasped </EM>as separate and real entities.&quot;
<P>
The chief and most fatal mistake and fallacy made by Science,
in the view of the Occultists, lies in the idea of the possibility
of such a thing as inorganic, or <EM>dead </EM>matter, in nature.
Is anything <EM>dead</EM> or<EM> inorganic </EM>capable of transformation
or change? Occultism asks. And is there anything under the sun
which remains immutable or changeless?
<P>
This fallacy is nowhere better illustrated than in the scientific
work of a German <EM>savant</EM>,<EM> </EM>Professor Philip Spiller
(<EM>Der Weltaether als Kosmische Kraft</EM>)<EM>. </EM>In this
cosmological treatise, the author attempts to prove that &quot;no
material constituent of a body, no atom, <EM>is in itself originally
endowed with force</EM>,<EM> </EM>but that every such atom <EM>is
absolutely dead</EM>,<EM>* </EM>and without any power to act at
a distance&quot; (p. 4).
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Something <EM>dead</EM> implies that it had been at some time
<I>living. </I>When, at what period of cosmogony? Occultism says
that in all cases when matter <EM>appears </EM>inert, it is the
most active. A wooden or a stone block is motionless and impenetrable
to all intents and purposes. Nevertheless, and <EM>de facto</EM>,<EM>
</EM>its particles are in ceaseless eternal vibration which is
so rapid that to the physical eye the body seems absolutely devoid
of motion; [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 508 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
This statement, however, does not prevent Spiller from enunciating
an occult doctrine and principle. He asserts <EM>the independent
substantiality of force</EM>,<EM> </EM>and shows it as an &quot;incorporeal
stuff&quot; (<EM>unkoerperlicher stoff</EM>) or substance. Now
<EM>substance </EM>is not <EM>matter </EM>in metaphysics, and
for argument's sake it may be granted that it is a wrong expression
to use. But this is due to the poverty of European languages,
and especially to that of scientific terms. Then this &quot;stuff&quot;
is identified and connected by Spiller with the aether. Expressed
in occult language it might be said with more correctness that
this &quot;force-substance&quot; is the ever-active phenomenal
<EM>positive </EM>aether -- <EM>prakriti; </EM>while the omnipresent
all pervading ether is the <EM>noumenon </EM>of the former, the
substratum of all, or <EM>Akasa. </EM>Nevertheless, Stallo falls
foul of Spiller, as he does of the materialists. He is accused
of &quot;utter disregard of the fundamental correlation of force
and matter&quot; (of neither of which Science knows anything certain).
For this &quot;hypostasized half-concept&quot; is, in the view
of all other physicists, not only <EM>imponderable</EM>,<EM> </EM>but
destitute of cohesive, chemical, thermal, electric, and magnetic
forces -- of all of which forces -- according to occultism --
aether is the source and <EM>cause.</EM> 
<P>
Therefore Spiller, with all his mistakes, exhibits more intuition
than any other modern Scientist, with the exception of Dr. Richardson,
perhaps, the theorist on the &quot;nerve force,&quot; or Nervous
Ether, also on &quot;Sun Force and Earth Force.&quot;* For <STRONG>AE</STRONG>THER,
in Esotericism, is the very quintessence of all possible energy,
and it is certainly to this universal agent (composed of many
<EM>agents</EM>)<EM> </EM>that all the manifestations of energy
in the material, psychic and spiritual worlds are due.
<P>
What are Electricity and Light, in fact? How can Science know
that one is a fluid and the other a &quot;mode of motion&quot;?
Why is it not made clear why a difference should be made between
them, since both are considered force-correlations. Electricity
is a fluid, we are told, immaterial and non-molecular (though
Helmholtz thinks otherwise), and the proof of it is that we can
bottle it up, accumulate and store it away. Then, <EM>it must
</EM>be simply matter, and no peculiar &quot;fluid.&quot; Nor
is it only &quot;a mode of motion,&quot; for motion could hardly
be stored in a Leyden jar. As for light, it is a still more extraordinary
&quot;mode of motion;&quot; since, &quot;marvellous as it may
appear, light (also) can <EM>actually be stored up for use</EM>,&quot;
as demonstrated by Professor Grove nearly half a century ago.
<P>
&quot;Take an engraving which has been kept for some days in the
dark, expose it to full sunshine -- that is, insulate it for 15
minutes; lay it on
<P>
[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] and the spacial distance
between those particles in their vibratory motion is -- considered
from another plane of being and perception -- as great as that
which separates snow flakes or drops of rain. But to physical
science this will be an absurdity.

sensitive paper in a dark place, and at the end of 24 hours it
will have left an impression of itself on the sensitive paper,
the whites coming out as blacks. . . . There seems to be no limit
for the reproduction of engravings, etc., etc. . . . .&quot;
<P>
What is it that remains fixed, nailed, so to say, on the paper?
It is a<EM> Force </EM>certainly, that fixed the thing, but what
is <EM>that thing</EM>,<EM> </EM>the residue of which remains
on the paper?
<P>
Our learned men will get out of this through some scientific technicality;
but what is it that is intercepted, so as to imprison a certain
quantity of it on glass, paper, or wood? Is it &quot;Motion&quot;
or is it &quot;Force&quot;? Or shall we be told that what remains
behind is the effect only of the force or Motion? Then what is
this Force? Force or energy is a quality; but every quality must
belong to a something, or a somebody. In Physics, Force is defined
as &quot;that which changes or tends to change any physical relation
between bodies, whether mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical,
magnetic, etc.&quot; But it is not that &quot;Force&quot; or that
&quot;Motion&quot; which remains behind on the paper, when the
Force or Motion has ceased to act; and yet something, which our
physical senses cannot perceive, has been left there to become
a cause in its turn and produce effects. What is it? It is not
matter, as defined by Science -- <EM>i.e.</EM>, matter in any
of its known states. An Alchemist would say it was a spiritual
secretion -- and would be laughed at. But yet, when the physicist
said that Electricity, stored up, was a fluid, or that light fixed
on paper is still Sunlight -- this is Science.* In the opinion
of an experienced Occultist, one who has verified the whole series
of <EM>Nidanas</EM>,<EM> </EM>of causes and effects that finally
project their last effect on to this our plane of manifestations;
one who has traced matter back to its noumenon, the explanation
of the physicist is like calling anger, or its effects -- the
exclamation provoked by it -- a secretion or a fluid, and man,
the cause of it -- its<EM> material </EM>conductor. But, as Grove
prophetically remarked, that day is fast approaching when it will
be confessed that the &quot;forces&quot; <I>we</I> know of are
but the phenomenal manifestations of realities we know nothing
about, -- but which <EM>were known to the ancients and </EM>--<EM>
by them worshipped.</EM> 
<P>
He made one still more suggestive remark, however, which ought
to have become the motto of Science, but has not. Sir W. Grove
said that &quot;<STRONG>S</STRONG>CIENCE SHOULD HAVE NEITHER DESIRES
NOR PREJUDICES. <STRONG>T</STRONG>RUTH SHOULD BE HER SOLE AIM.&quot;
<P>
Meanwhile, in our days, Scientists are more self-opinionated and
bigoted than even the clergy. For they minister to, if they do
not actually worship,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The newest Authorities have rejected these explanations as &quot;exploded
theories,&quot; and have now deified &quot;Motion&quot; as their
sole Idol. But, surely, they and their idol will one day share
the fate of their predecessors.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 510 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
&quot;Force-Matter,&quot; which is their <EM>Unknown God. </EM>And
how unknown it is may be inferred from the many confessions of
the most eminent physicists and biologists, with Faraday at their
head. Not only, he said, could he never presume to pronounce whether
Force was a property or function of Matter, but he actually did
not know what was meant by the word <EM>matter.</EM> 
<P>
There was a time, he added, when he believed he knew something
of matter. But the more he lived, and the more carefully he studied
it, the more he became convinced <EM>of his utter ignorance of
the nature of matter.* </EM>(See Buckwell's &quot;Electric Science.&quot;)
<P>
The Occultists are often misunderstood because, for lack of better
terms, they apply to the essence of Force <EM>under certain aspects
</EM>the descriptive epithet of <EM>substance. </EM>Now the names
for the varieties of &quot;substance&quot; on different planes
of perception and being are <EM>legion. </EM>Eastern Occultism
has a special appellation for each kind; but Science -- like England,
in the recollection of a witty Frenchman, blessed with thirty-six
religions and only one fish-sauce -- has but one name for all,
namely, &quot;Substance.&quot; Moreover, neither the orthodox
physicists nor their critics seem to be very certain of their
premises, and are as apt to confuse the effects as they do the
causes. It is incorrect, for instance, to say, as Stallo does,
that &quot;matter can no more be realized or conceived as mere
spacial presence than as a concretion of forces,&quot; or that
&quot;force is nothing without mass, and mass is nothing without
force&quot; -- for one is the noumenon and the other the phenomenon.
Again; Schelling, when saying that &quot;It is a mere delusion
of the phantasy that something, we know not what, remains after
we have denuded an object of all the predicates belonging to it&quot;**
-- could never have applied the remark to the realm of transcendental
metaphysics. It is true that pure force is <EM>nothing </EM>in
the world of physics; it is ALL in the domain of Spirit. Says
Stallo: &quot;If we reduce the mass upon which a given force,
however small, acts to its limit zero -- or, mathematically expressed,
until it becomes infinitely small -- the consequence is that the
velocity of the resulting motion is infinitely great, and that
the 'thing' . . . is at any given moment neither here nor there,
but everywhere -- that there is no
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* This ominous confession was made, we believe, at a Scientific
Congress at Swansea. Faraday held a similar opinion, however,
as stated by Tyndall: &quot;What do we know of the atom <EM>apart
from its </EM>force? You imagine a nucleus which may be called
<EM>a</EM> and surround it by forces which may be called <EM>m</EM>;
to my mind the <EM>a</EM> or nucleus vanishes and the substance
consists of the powers <EM>m</EM>. And, indeed, what notion can
we form of the nucleus independent of its powers? What thought
remains on which to hang the imagination of an <I>a </I>independent
of the acknowledged forces?&quot;
<P>
** Schelling, &quot;Ideen,&quot; etc., p. 18.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 511 WHAT IS FORCE?</H6>

<P>
real presence; it is impossible, therefore, to construct matter
by a synthesis of forces&quot; (p. 161).
<P>
This may be true in the phenomenal world, inasmuch as the illusive
reflection of the <EM>one reality </EM>of the supersensual world
may appear true to the dwarfed conceptions of a materialist. It
is absolutely incorrect when the argument is applied to things,
in what the Kabalists call the supermundane spheres. Inertia,
so called, &quot;is force&quot; according to Newton (<EM>Princ.
Def. iii.</EM>),<EM> </EM>and for the student of Esoteric Sciences
the greatest of the occult forces. A body may be considered divorced
from its relations with other bodies -- which, according to physical
and mechanical sciences, give rise to its attributes -- only <EM>conceptually</EM>,<EM>
</EM>only on this plane of illusion. In fact, it can never be
so detached: death itself being unable to detach it from its relation
with the Universal forces, of which the one <STRONG>F</STRONG>ORCE
or <STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE is the synthesis: but simply continues
such inter-relation on another plane. But what, if Stallo is right,
can Dr. James Croll mean when, in speaking &quot;On the Transformation
of Gravity&quot; (<EM>Philosophical Magazine</EM>,<EM> </EM>Vol<EM>.
</EM>II., p. 252), he brings forward the views advocated by Faraday,
Waterston, and others? For he says very plainly that gravity --
<P>
&quot;. . . . . is a force pervading Space <EM>external to bodies</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and that, on the mutual approach of the bodies, the force
is not increased, as is generally supposed, but the bodies merely
pass into a place <EM>where the force exists with greater intensity</EM>.
. . . .&quot;
<P>
No one will deny that a force (whether gravity, electricity, or
any other force) which exists <EM>outside </EM>of the bodies and
in open space -- be it ether or vacuum -- must be <EM>something</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and not a pure <EM>nothing</EM>,<EM> </EM>when conceived
apart from a mass? Otherwise it could hardly exist in one place
with a <EM>greater </EM>and in another with reduced &quot;intensity.&quot;
G. A. Hirn declares the same in his <EM>Theorie Mecanique de l</EM>'<EM>Univers.
</EM>He tries to demonstrate that the atom of the chemists is
not an entity of pure convention, or simply an explicative device,
but that it exists really, that its volume is unalterable, and
that consequently it is <EM>not </EM>elastic (!!). &quot;Force,
therefore, <EM>is not in the atom; it is in the space which separates
the atoms from each other.</EM>&quot;
<P>
The above-cited views, expressed by two men of Science of great
eminence in their respective countries, show that it is not in
the least <EM>unscientific </EM>to speak of the substantiality
of the so-called <EM>Forces. </EM>Subject to some future specific
name, this force is <EM>substance </EM>of some kind, and can be
nothing else; and perhaps one day Science will be the first to
re-adopt the derided name of phlogiston. Whatever may be the future
name given to it, to maintain that force does <EM>not </EM>reside
in the atoms, but only in &quot;space between them,&quot; may
be scientific enough; nevertheless it is not true. To the mind
of an Occultist it is like saying<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 512 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
that water does not reside in the drops of which the ocean is
composed, but only in the space between those drops!
<P>
The objection made that there are two distinct schools of physicists,
by one of which &quot;the force is assumed to be an <EM>independent
substantial entity</EM>,<EM> </EM>which is NOT a property of matter
nor is it essentially related to matter,&quot;* is hardly likely
to help the profane to any clearer understanding. It is, on the
contrary, still more calculated to throw the question into greater
confusion than ever. For Force is, then, neither this nor the
other. By viewing it as &quot;an independent substantial entity,&quot;
the theory extends the right hand of fellowship to Occultism,
while the strange contradictory idea that it is not related to
matter &quot;otherwise than by its power to act upon it,&quot;**
leads physical science to the most absurd contradictory hypotheses.
Whether &quot;force&quot; or &quot;motion,&quot; (Occultism, seeing
no difference between the two, never attempts to separate them)
it cannot act for the adherents of the atomo-mechanical theory
one way, and for those of the rival school in another way. Nor
can the atoms be, in one case, <EM>absolutely uniform in size
and weight</EM>,<EM> </EM>and in another, vary in their weight
(Avogadro's law). For, in the words of the same able critic,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . &quot;While the absolute equality of the primordial units
of mass is thus an essential part of the very foundations of the
mechanical theory, the whole modern Science of chemistry is based
<I>upon a principle directly subversive of it </I>-- a principle
of which it has recently been said that 'it holds the same place
in chemistry that the law of gravitation does in astronomy.'***
This principle is known as the law of Avogadro or Ampere.&quot;****
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This shows that either modern chemistry or modern physics is entirely
wrong in its respective fundamental principles. For if the assumption
of atoms of different specific gravities on the basis of the atomic
theory in physics is deemed absurd, and chemistry meets, nevertheless,
on its opposite basis (in the question of the formation and transformation
of chemical compounds) with &quot;<EM>unfailing </EM>experimental
verification,&quot;

**** &quot;It imports that equal volumes of all substances, when
in the gaseous state, and under like conditions of pressure and
temperature, contain the same number of molecules -- whence it
follows that the weights of the molecules are proportional to
the specific gravities of the gases; that therefore, these being
different, the weights of the molecules are different also; and
inasmuch as the molecules of certain elementary substances are
<EM>monatomic </EM>(consist of but one atom each) while the molecules
of various other substances contain the same number of atoms,
that the ultimate atoms of such substances are of different weights&quot;
(<EM>Concepts of Modern Physics</EM>,<EM> </EM>p. 34). As shown
further on in the same volume, this cardinal principle of modern
theoretical chemistry <EM>is in utter and irreconcilable conflict
with the first proposition of the atomo-mechanical theory </EM>--<EM>
</EM>namely, the absolute equality of the primordial units of
mass.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 513 THEY AGREE TO DISAGREE.</H6>

<P>
then it becomes apparent that it is the atomo-mechanical theory
which is untenable. The explanations of the latter, that &quot;the
differences of weight are only differences of density, and differences
of density are differences of distance between the particles contained
in a given space,&quot; are not really valid, because, before
a physicist can argue in his defence that, &quot;as in the atom
there is no multiplicity of particles and no void space: hence
differences of density or weight are impossible in the case of
atoms,&quot; he must first know what an atom is, in reality, and
that he cannot know. He must bring it under the observation <EM>of
at least one of </EM>his physical senses -- and that <EM>he cannot
do: </EM>for the simple reason that no one has ever <EM>seen</EM>,<EM>
smelt</EM>,<EM> heard</EM>,<EM> touched </EM>or<EM> tasted </EM>an
&quot;atom.&quot; The atom belongs wholly to the domain of metaphysics.
It is <EM>an entified abstraction </EM>--<EM> </EM>at any rate
for physical Science -- and has nought to do with physics, strictly
speaking, as it can never be brought to the test of retort or
balance. The mechanical conception, therefore, becomes a jumble
of the most conflicting theories and dilemmas, in the minds of
the many Scientists who disagree on this, as on other subjects;
the evolution of which the Eastern Occultist, who follows this
scientific strife, beholds in the greatest bewilderment.
<P>
To conclude on the question of gravity. How can Science presume
to know anything certain of it? How can it maintain its position
and its hypotheses against those of the Occultists, who see in
gravity only sympathy and antipathy, or attraction and repulsion,
caused by physical polarity on our terrestrial plane, and by spiritual
causes outside of its influence? How can they disagree with the
Occultists before they agree among themselves? Indeed one hears
of the conservation of energy, and in the same breath of the perfect
hardness and inelasticity of the atoms; of the Kinetic theory
of gases being identical with &quot;potential energy,&quot; so
called; and, at the same time, of the elementary units of mass
being <EM>absolutely hard </EM>and<EM> inelastic! </EM>An Occultist
opens a scientific work and reads as follows: --
<P>
&quot;Physical atomism derives all the qualitative properties
of matter from the forms of atomic motion. <EM>The atoms themselves
remain as elements utterly devoid of property.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(Wundt, &quot;<EM>Die Theorie der Materie</EM>,&quot;<EM>
p. </EM>381.)
<P>
And further:
<P>
&quot;Chemistry in its ultimate form <EM>must be atomic mechanics.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(Nazesmann, &quot;<EM>Thermochemie</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>p.
150.)
<P>
And a moment after he is told that:
<P>
&quot;Gases consist of atoms which <EM>behave </EM>like solid,
<EM>perfectly elastic </EM>spheres.&quot; (Kroenig, Clausius,
Maxwell, etc., <EM>Philosophical Magazine</EM>,<EM> </EM>Vol.
<B>XIX</B>., p. 18.)
<P>
Finally, to crown all, Sir W. Thomson is found declaring that:
<P>
&quot;We are forbidden by the modern theory of the conservation
of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 514 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
energy to assume inelasticity, or anything short <EM>of perfect
elasticity </EM>of the ultimate molecules whether of ultra mundane
or mundane matter.&quot; (!!!) (&quot;Philosophical Magazine,&quot;
p. 321, <EM>loc. cit.</EM>)
<P>
But what do the men of <EM>true </EM>Science say to all this?
By the &quot;men of true Science&quot; we mean those who care
too much for truth and too little for their personal vanity to
dogmatise on anything, as the majority do. There are several among
them -- perhaps more than dare publish openly their secret conclusions
for fear of the cry &quot;Stone him to death!&quot; -- men, whose
intuitions have made them span the abyss that lies between the
terrestrial aspect of matter, and the -- to us, on our plane of
illusion -- subjective, <EM>i.e.</EM>, TRANSCENDENTALLY OBJECTIVE
SUBSTANCE, and led them to proclaim the existence of the latter.
Matter, to the Occultist, it must be remembered, is that totality
of <EM>existences </EM>in the Kosmos, which falls within any of
the planes of possible perception. We are but too well aware that
the orthodox theories of sound, heat and light, are against the
occult doctrines. But, it is not enough for the men of Science,
or their defenders, to say that <EM>they do not deny dynamic power
to light and heat; </EM>and urge as a proof the fact that Mr.
Crookes' radiometer has unsettled no views. If they would fathom
the ultimate nature of these Forces, they have first to admit
their <EM>substantial </EM>nature, however <EM>supersensuous.
</EM>Neither do the Occultists deny the correctness of the vibratory
theory.* Only they limit its functions to our Earth -- declaring
its inadequacy on other planes than ours, since &quot;Masters&quot;
in the Occult Sciences perceive the CAUSES that produce ethereal
vibrations. Were all these only the fictions of the alchemists,
or dreams of the Mystics, such men as Paracelsus, Philalethes,
Van Helmont, and so many others, would have to be regarded as
worse than visionaries: they would become impostors and deliberate
mystificators.
<P>
The Occultists are taken to task for calling the <EM>Cause </EM>of
light, heat, sound, cohesion, magnetism, etc., etc., a <EM>substance</EM>.**
Mr. Clerk Maxwell has stated that the pressure of strong sunlight
on a square mile is about 3 1/4 lbs. It is, they are told, &quot;the
energy of the myriad ether waves;&quot; and when they call it
a &quot;substance&quot; impinging on that area, their explanation
is proclaimed <EM>unscientific.</EM> 
<P>
There is no justification for such an accusation. In no way --
as stated
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Referring to the <I>Aura</I>, one of the Masters says in the
&quot;Occult World,&quot; &quot;How could you make yourself understood
by, command in fact, those semi-intelligent <EM>forces</EM>,<EM>
</EM>whose means of communication with us are not through spoken
words but <EM>through sounds and colours </EM>in correlation between
the <EM>vibrations </EM>of the two.&quot; It is this &quot;correlation&quot;
that is unknown to modern Science, yet was many times explained
by the Alchemists.
<P>
** The &quot;substance&quot; of the Occultist, however, is to
the most refined <EM>substance </EM>of the physicist, what <EM>radiant
matter </EM>is to the leather of the Chemist's boots.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 515 THE MYSTIC RAYS.</H6>

<P>
more than once before now -- do the Occultists dispute the explanations
of Science, as affording a solution of the <EM>immediate </EM>objective
agencies at work. Science only errs in believing that, because
it has detected in vibratory waves the <EM>proximate </EM>cause
of these phenomena, it has, therefore, revealed ALL that lies
beyond the threshold of Sense. It merely traces the sequence of
phenomena on a plane of effects, illusory projections from the
region that Occultism has long since penetrated. And the latter
maintains that those etheric tremors, are not, as asserted by
Science, set up by the vibrations of the molecules of <EM>known
</EM>bodies -- the matter of our terrestrial objective consciousness,
-- but that we must seek for the ultimate causes of light, heat,
etc., etc., in <B>MATTER </B>existing in <EM>super</EM>-<EM>sensuous
</EM>states<EM> </EM>--<EM> </EM>states, however, as fully objective
to the spiritual eye of man, as a horse or a tree is to the ordinary
mortal. Light and heat are the ghost or shadow of matter in motion.
Such states can be perceived by the SEER or the Adept during the
hours of trance, under the <EM>Sushumna ray </EM>--<EM> </EM>the
first of the Seven <EM>Mystic </EM>rays of the Sun.*
<P>
Thus, we put forward the Occult teaching which maintains the reality
of a supersubstantial and supersensible essence of that <EM>Akasa
</EM>(not ether, which is only an aspect of the latter), the nature
of which cannot be inferred from its remoter manifestations --
<EM>its merely phenomenal phalanx of effects </EM>--<EM> </EM>on
this terrene plane. Science, on the contrary, informs us that
heat can never be regarded as matter in any conceivable state.**
We are also told that the two great obstacles to the fluid (?)
theory of heat undoubtedly are: --

* The names of the Seven Rays -- which are, Sushumna, Harikesa,
Viswakarman, Viswatryarchas, Sannaddha, Sarvavasu and Swaraj --
are all mystical, and each has its distinct application in a distinct
state of consciousness, for occult purposes. The <EM>Sushumna</EM>,
which, as said in the <EM>Nirukta </EM>(11, 6), is only to light
up the moon, is the ray nevertheless cherished by the initiated
Yogis. The totality of the Seven Rays spread through the Solar
system constitute, so to say, the physical <EM>Upadhi </EM>(basis)
of the <EM>Ether of Science; </EM>in which Upadhi, light, heat,
electricity, etc., etc., -- the forces of orthodox science --
correlate to produce their terrestrial effects. As psychic and
spiritual effects, they emanate from, and have their origin in,
the supra-solar Upadhi, in the ether of the Occultist -- or Akasa.

** To cite a most impartial critic, one whose authority no one
can call in question, as a reminder to Western Dogmatists, that
the question cannot be in any way considered as settled: &quot;There
is no fundamental difference between light and heat . . . each
is merely a metamorphosis of the other. . . . Heat is light in
complete repose. Light is heat in rapid motion. Directly light
is combined with a body, it becomes heat; but when it is thrown
off from that body it again becomes light.&quot; (<EM>Leslie</EM>'<EM>s

this is true or false we cannot tell</EM>,<EM> </EM>and many years,

<P>
(1.) The production of heat by friction -- excitation of molecular
motions.
<P>
(2.) The conversion of heat into mechanical motion.
<P>
The answer given is: There are fluids of various kinds. Electricity
is called a fluid, and so was heat quite recently, but it was
on the supposition that heat was some imponderable substance.
This was during the supreme and autocratic reign of matter. When
the latter was dethroned, and MOTION was proclaimed the sole sovereign
ruler of the Universe, heat became &quot;a mode of motion.&quot;
We need not despair: it may become something else to-morrow. Like
the Universe itself, Science is ever <EM>becoming</EM>,<EM> </EM>and
can never say, &quot;I am that I am.&quot; On the other hand,
Occult Science has its <EM>changeless </EM>traditions from prehistoric
times. It may err in particulars; it can never become guilty of
a mistake in questions of Universal laws, simply because that
Science, justly referred to by philosophy as the &quot;<EM>divine</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>was born on higher planes, and was brought on Earth by beings
who were wiser than man will be, even in the seventh Race of his
Seventh Round. And <EM>that </EM>Science maintains that Forces
are not what modern learning would have them; <EM>e.g.</EM>,<EM>
</EM>Magnetism is <EM>not </EM>a &quot;mode of motion&quot;; and,
in this particular case, at least, <EM>exact </EM>&quot;modern
Science&quot; is sure to come to grief some day. Nothing, at the
first blush, can appear more ridiculous, more outrageously absurd
than to say, for instance: &quot;the Hindu initiated Yogi knows
really <EM>ten times more than the greatest European physicist
of the ultimate nature and constitution of light </EM>--<EM> </EM>both
solar and lunar.&quot; Yet why is the Sushumna ray believed to
be that ray which furnishes the moon with its borrowed light?
Why is it &quot;the ray cherished <EM>by the initiated Yogi?</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>Why is the moon held as the <EM>deity of the mind</EM>,<EM>
</EM>by those Yogis? We say, because light, or rather all its
occult properties, every combination and correlation of it with
other forces, mental, psychic, and spiritual, were perfectly known
to the old adepts.
<P>
Therefore, although, in its knowledge of the ultimate constitution
of matter, or in the so-called ultimate analysis as opposed to
the proximate in chemistry, occult science may be less well-informed
as to the behaviour of compound elements in various cases of physical
correlations: still, it is immeasurably higher in its knowledge
of the ultimate occult states of matter, and of the true nature
of matter, than all the physicists and chemists of our modern
day put together.
<P>
Now, if we state the truth openly and in full sincerity, namely,
that the ancient Initiates had a far wider knowledge of physics
-- as a Science of Nature -- than our Academies of Science, all
taken together, possess, the statement will be characterized as
an impertinence and an absurdity; for physical sciences are considered
to have been carried in our age to the apex of perfection. Hence,
the twitting query -- &quot;Can<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 517 THE CAUSES AND THE EFFECTS.</H6>

<P>
the Occultists meet successfully the two points, namely (<EM>a</EM>)
the production of heat by friction -- excitation of molecular
motions; and (<EM>b</EM>) the conversion of heat into mechanical
force, if they hold to the old &quot;exploded&quot; theory of
heat being a substance or a fluid?&quot;
<P>
To answer the question, it must first be observed that the Occult
Sciences do not regard either electricity or any of the forces
supposed to be generated by it, as matter, <EM>in any of the states
known to physical Science; </EM>to put it more clearly, none of
these &quot;forces,&quot; so-called, are either solids, gases,
or fluids. If it did not look pedantic, an Occultist would even
object to electricity being called a fluid --<EM> as it is an
effect and not a cause. </EM>But its <EM>noumenon</EM>,<EM> </EM>he
would say, <EM>is a conscious cause. </EM>The same in the cases
of &quot;Force&quot; and the &quot;Atom.&quot; Let us see what
an eminent Academician, Butlerof, the chemist, had to say about
these two abstractions.
<P>
--------------
<P>
&quot;What is Force?&quot; argues this great man of Science, &quot;what
is it from a strictly scientific stand-point, and as warranted
by the law of conservation of energy? Conceptions of Force are
resumed by our conceptions of this, that, or another mode of motion.&quot;
Force is thus simply the passage of <EM>one state of motion into
another state of the same: </EM>of electricity, into heat and
light, of heat into sound or some mechanical function, and so
on.* The first time electric fluid was produced by man on earth
it must have been by friction; hence, as well-known, it is heat
that produces it by disturbing its <EM>laya </EM>state,** and
electricity exists no more on earth <EM>per se </EM>than heat
or light, or any other force. They are all correlations, as science
says. &quot;When a given quantity of heat, assisted by a steam
engine, is transformed into mechanical work, we speak of steam
power (or force). When a falling body strikes an obstacle in its
way, thereby generating heat and sound -- we call it the power
of collision. When electricity decomposes water or heats a platinum
wire, we speak of the force of the electric fluid. When the rays
of the sun are intercepted by the thermometer bulb and its quicksilver
expands, we speak of the calorific energy of the sun. In short,
when one state of a determined quantity of motion ceases, another
state of motion equivalent to the preceding takes its place, and
the result of such a transformation or correlation is -- force.
In all cases where such a transformation, or the passage of one
state of motion into another, is entirely absent, there no force
is possible. Let us admit for a moment an absolutely homogeneous
state of the Universe, and our conception of force falls down
to nought.&quot;

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 518 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
&quot;Therefore it becomes evident that the force, which materialism
considers as the cause of the diversity that surrounds us, is
in sober reality only an effect, a result of that diversity. From
such point of view force is not the cause of motion, but a result,
while the cause of that force, or forces, is not the substance
or matter, but motion itself. Matter thus must be laid aside and
with it the basic principle of materialism, which has become unnecessary,
as force brought down to a state of motion can give no idea of
the substance. If force is the result of motion, then it becomes
incomprehensible <EM>why that motion should become witness to
matter </EM>and not to Spirit or a Spiritual essence. True, our
reason cannot conceive of a motion minus something moving (and
our reason is right); but the nature or <EM>esse </EM>of that
something moving remains to Science entirely unknown; and the
Spiritualist, in such case, has as much right to attribute it
to a &quot;Spirit,&quot; as a Materialist to creative and all-potential
matter. A Materialist has no special privileges in this instance,
nor can he claim any. The law of the conservation of energy, as
thus seen, is shown to be illegitimate in its pretensions and
claims in this case. The &quot;great dogma&quot; -- <EM>no force
without matter and no matter without force </EM>--<EM> </EM>falls
to the ground, and loses entirely the solemn significance with
which materialism has tried to invest it. The conception of force
still gives no idea of matter and compels us in no way to see
in it &quot;the origin of all origins.&quot; (&quot;<EM>Scientific
Letters</EM>,&quot;<EM> Professor Butlerof.</EM>)
<P>
We are assured that real science is not materialistic; and our
own conviction tells us that it cannot be so, when its learning
is real. There is a good reason for it, well defined by some physicists
and chemists themselves. Natural sciences <EM>cannot </EM>go hand
in hand with materialism. To be at the height of their calling,
men of science have to reject the very possibility of materialistic
doctrines having aught to do with the <EM>atomic </EM>theory;
and we find that Lange, Butlerof, Du Bois Reymond, -- the latter
probably unconsciously -- and several others, have proved it.
And it is, furthermore, demonstrated by the fact, that Kanada
in India, and Leucippus, Democritus, and after them Epicurus --
the earliest atomists in Europe -- while propagating their doctrine
of definite proportions, believed in <EM>Gods </EM>or supersensuous
entities, at the same time. Their ideas upon matter thus differed
from those now prevalent. We must be allowed to make our statement
clearer in a short synopsis of the ancient and modern views of
philosophy upon atoms, and thus prove that the atomic theory kills
Materialism.
<P>
From the standpoint of Materialism, which reduces the beginnings
of all to <EM>matter</EM>,<EM> </EM>the Universe consists, in
its fullness, of atoms and vacuity. Even leaving aside the axiom
-- now absolutely demonstrated by telescope and microscope --
taught by the ancients, that nature abhors<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 519 THE VICIOUS CIRCLE.</H6>

<P>
vacuum, what is an atom? &quot;It is, we are answered by Science,&quot;
writes Professor Butlerof, &quot;the limited division of substance,
the indivisible particle of matter. To admit the divisibility
of the atom, amounts to an admission of an infinite divisibility
of substance, which is equivalent to reducing substance to <EM>nihil</EM>,<EM>
</EM>a nothingness. Owing to a feeling of self-preservation alone,
materialism cannot admit infinite divisibility; otherwise, it
would have to bid farewell for ever to its basic principle and
thus sign its own death-warrant.&quot; Buchner, for instance,
like a true dogmatist in materialism, declares that &quot;to accept
infinite divisibility is absurd, and amounts to doubting the very
existence of matter.&quot; The Atom is indivisible then, saith
Materialism? Very well.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;See now what a curious contradiction this fundamental principle
of the materialists is leading them into,&quot; writes Butlerof.
&quot;The atom is <I>indivisible</I>,<I> </I>and at the same time
we know it to be <I>elastic. </I>An attempt to deprive it of elasticity
is unthinkable; it would amount to an absurdity. <I>Absolutely
non</I>-<I>elastic atoms could never exhibit a single one of those
numerous phenomena that are attributed to their correlations.
</I>Without any elasticity, the atoms could not manifest their
energy, and the substance of the materialists would remain weeded
of every force. Therefore, if the Universe is composed of atoms,
then those atoms <I>must be elastic. </I>It is here that we meet
with an insuperable obstacle. For, what are the conditions requisite
for the manifestation of elasticity? An elastic ball, when striking
against an obstacle, is flattened and contracts, which it would
be impossible for it to do, were not that ball to consist of particles,
the relative position of which experiences at the time of the
blow a temporary change. This may be said of elasticity in general;
no elasticity is possible without change with respect to the position
of the compound particles of an elastic body. This means that
the elastic body is changeful and consists of particles, or, in
other words, that elasticity can pertain <I>only to those bodies
that are divisible. </I>And the atom <I>is</I> elastic.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is sufficient to show how absurd are the simultaneous admissions
of the non-divisibility and elasticity of the atom. The atom <EM>is
</EM>elastic,<EM> ergo</EM>,<EM> </EM>the atom is divisible, and
must consist of particles, or of <EM>sub</EM>-atoms. And these
<EM>sub</EM>-atoms? They are either non-elastic, and in such case
they represent no dynamic importance, or, they are <EM>elastic
</EM>also; and in that case, they, too, are subject to divisibility.
And thus <EM>ad infinitum. </EM>But infinite divisibility of atoms
resolves matter into simple centres of force, <EM>i.e.</EM>, precludes
the possibility of conceiving matter as an <EM>objective </EM>substance.
<P>
This vicious circle is fatal to materialism. It finds itself caught
in its own nets, and no issue is possible for it out of the dilemma.
If it says that the atom is indivisible, then it will have mechanics
asking it the awkward question: &quot;How does the Universe move
in this case, and how do its forces correlate? A world built on
absolutely <I>non</I>-elastic atoms, is like an engine without
steam, it is doomed to eternal inertia.&quot;*

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 520 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Accept the explanations and teachings of Occultism, and, the blind
inertia of physical Science being replaced by the <EM>intelligent
active </EM>Powers behind the veil of matter, motion and inertia
become subservient to those Powers. It is on the doctrine of the
illusive nature of matter, and the infinite divisibility of the
atom, that the whole science of Occultism is built. It opens limitless
horizons to <EM>substance </EM>informed by the divine breath of
its soul in every possible state of tenuity, states still undreamt
of by the most spiritually disposed chemists and physicists.
<P>
The above views were enunciated by an Academician, the greatest
chemist in Russia, and a recognised authority even in Europe --
the late Professor Butlerof. True, he was defending the phenomena
of the Spiritualists, the materializations, so called, in which
he believed as Professors Zollner, and Hare did, as Mr. A. Russell
Wallace, Mr. W. Crookes, and many another Fellow of the Royal
Society, do still, whether openly or secretly. But his argument
with regard to the nature of the essence that acts behind the
physical phenomena of light, heat, electricity, etc., is no less
scientific and authoritative for all that, and apply admirably
to the case in hand. Science has no right to deny to the Occultists
their claim to a more profound knowledge of the so-called Forces;
which, they say, are only the effects of causes generated by Powers,
substantial, yet supersensuous, and <EM>beyond </EM>any kind of
matter with which they (the Scientists) have hitherto become acquainted.
The most science can do is to assume the attitude of agnosticism
and to maintain it. Then it can say: &quot;Your case is no more
proven than is ours; but we confess to knowing nothing in reality
either about Force or matter, or that which lies at the bottom
of the so-called correlations of Forces. Therefore, time alone
can prove who is right and who is wrong. Let us wait patiently,
and meanwhile show courtesy instead of scoffing at each other.&quot;
<P>
But to do this requires a boundless love of truth and the surrender
of that prestige -- however false -- of <EM>infallibility</EM>,<EM>
</EM>which the men of Science have acquired among the ignorant
and flippant, though cultured, masses of the profane. To blend
the two sciences, the archaic and the modern, requires first of
all the abandonment of the actual materialistic lines. It necessitates
a kind of religious mysticism and even the study of old magic,
which our Academicians will never take up. The necessity is easily
explained. Just as in old alchemical works the real meaning of
the substances and elements meant are concealed under the most
ridiculous metaphors, so are the physical, psychic, and spiritual
natures of the Elements (say of fire) concealed in the Vedas,
and especially in the Puranas, under allegories comprehensible
only to the Initiates. Had they no meaning, then indeed all those
long legends and allegories about the sacredness of the three
types of fire, and the <EM>forty</EM>-<EM>nine original fires</EM>
--<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 521 CHEMICAL GODS.</H6>

<P>
personified by the Sons of Daksha's daughters and the Rishis,
their husbands, &quot;who with the first son of Brahma and his
three descendants constitute the forty-nine fires&quot; -- would
be idiotic verbiage and no more. But it is not so. Every <EM>fire</EM>
has a distinct function and meaning in the worlds of the physical
and the spiritual. It has, moreover, in its <EM>essential </EM>nature
a corresponding relation to one of the human psychic faculties,
besides its well determined chemical and physical potencies when
coming in contact with the <EM>terrestrially </EM>differentiated
matter. Science has no speculations to offer upon fire <EM>per
se; </EM>Occultism and ancient religious science have. This is
shown even in the meagre and purposely veiled phraseology of the
Puranas, where (as in the <EM>Vayu Purana</EM>)<EM> </EM>many
of the qualities of the <EM>personified </EM>fires are explained.
Thus, <EM>Pavaka </EM>is electric, or <EM>Vaidyuta</EM>,<EM> </EM>fire;
Pavamana, <EM>the fire produced by friction</EM>,<EM> </EM>(or<EM>
Nirmathya</EM>)<EM>: </EM>and <EM>Suchi </EM>is solar (or <EM>Saura</EM>)<EM>
</EM>fire<EM>* </EM>-- all these three being the sons of Abhimanin,
the Agni (fire), eldest son of Brahma and of Swaha. Pavaka, moreover,
is made parent to Kavyavahana, <EM>the fire of the Pitris: </EM>Suchi
to Havyavahana -- the fire of the gods; and Pavamana, to Saharaksha,
the fire of the Asuras. Now all this shows that the writers of
the Puranas were perfectly conversant with the &quot;Forces&quot;
of Science and their correlations; moreover, with the various
qualities of the latter in their bearing upon those psychic and
physical phenomena which receive no credit and are unknown to
physical science now. Very naturally, when an Orientalist, --
especially one with materialistic tendencies -- reads that these
are only appellations of fire employed <EM>in the invocations
</EM>and rituals, he calls this &quot;Tantrika superstition and
mystification&quot;; and he becomes more careful to avoid errors
in spelling, than to give attention to the secret meaning attached
to the personifications, or to seek their explanation in the physical
correlations of forces, so far as known. So little credit, indeed,
is given to the ancient Aryans for knowledge, that even such glaring
passages as in <EM>Book I. chap. </EM>ii,<EM> Vishnu Purana</EM>,<EM>
</EM>are left without any notice. Nevertheless, what can this
sentence mean? -- &quot;Then Ether, air, light, water, and earth,
severally united with the properties of sound and other qualities,
existed as distinguishable according to their properties, . .
. . but possessing many and various energies and being unconnected,
they <EM>could not</EM>,<EM> without combination</EM>,<EM> </EM>create
living beings, not having blended with each other. . . . Having
combined . . . they assumed through mutual association, the character
of one mass of entire unity; and directed by Spirit . . .&quot;
etc. This means, of course, that the writers were perfectly acquainted
with correlation and were well posted about the origin of Kosmos
from the &quot;undiscrete Principle&quot; -- <EM>Avyaktanugrahena</EM>,<EM>

to Parabrahmam and Mulaprakriti conjointly, and not to &quot;Avyakta,
<EM>either </EM>First Cause, or matter,&quot; as Wilson gives
it. The old Initiates knew of no &quot;miraculous creation,&quot;
but taught the evolution of atoms (on our physical plane), and
their first differentiation from <EM>laya </EM>into the <EM>protyle</EM>,<EM>
</EM>as Mr. Crookes has suggestively named matter, or primordial
substance <EM>beyond </EM>the zero-line: -- there where we place
<EM>Mulaprakriti</EM>,<EM> </EM>the &quot;<I>root</I>-Principle&quot;
of the world stuff and of all in the world.
<P>
This can be easily demonstrated. Take, for instance, the newly-published
catechism of the <EM>Visishtadwaita Vedantins</EM>,<EM> </EM>an
orthodox and exoteric system, yet fully enunciated and taught
in the XIth century (its founder, Ramanujacharya, being born in
<B>A.D.</B> 1017), at a time when European &quot;Science&quot;
still believed in the squareness and flatness of the Earth, of
Cosmas-Indicopleustes of the VIth century. It teaches that before
evolution began, Prakriti (Nature) was in a condition of <EM>laya
</EM>or absolute homogeneity, as &quot;matter exists in two conditions,
the <EM>sukshma</EM>,<EM> </EM>or latent and undifferentiated,
and the <EM>sthula </EM>or differentiated condition.&quot; Then
it became <EM>anu</EM>, atomic. It teaches of <EM>Sudda</EM>-<EM>satwa
</EM>-- &quot;a substance not subject to the qualities of matter,
from which it is quite different,&quot; and adds that out of that
substance the bodies of the inhabitants of Vaikuntaloka (the heaven
of Vishnu), the gods, are formed. That every particle or atom
of Prakriti contains <EM>Jiva</EM> (divine life), and is the <EM>sarira
</EM>(body) of that Jiva which it contains, while every Jiva is
in its turn the <EM>sarira </EM>of the supreme spirit, as &quot;Parabrahm
pervades every Jiva, as well as every particle of matter.&quot;
Dualistic and anthropomorphic as may be the philosophy of the
Visishtadwaita, when compared with that of the <EM>Adwaita</EM>
-- the non-dualists, -- it is yet supremely higher in logic and
philosophy than the cosmogony accepted by either Christianity,
or its great opponent, modern Science. The followers of one of
the greatest minds that ever appeared on Earth, the <EM>Adwaita
</EM>Vedantins are called <EM>Atheists</EM>,<EM> </EM>because
they regard all save Parabrahm, the <EM>secondless</EM>,<EM> </EM>or
Absolute Reality -- as an illusion. Yet the wisest Initiates came
from their ranks, as also the greatest Yogis. The<EM> Upanishads
</EM>show that they most assuredly knew not only what is the <EM>causal
</EM>substance in the <EM>effects </EM>of<EM> friction</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and that their forefathers were acquainted with the <EM>conversion
of heat into mechanical force</EM>,<EM> </EM>but that they were
acquainted with the <EM>noumena </EM>of every spiritual as well
as of every cosmic phenomenon.

physical Forces, certain passages in his Puranas, if he would
learn how much more his ancestors knew than he will ever know
-- unless he becomes an occultist. Let him turn to the allegory
of Pururavas and the celestial <EM>Gandharva</EM>,<EM>* </EM>who
furnished the former with a vessel full of heavenly fire. The
primeval mode of obtaining fire by friction has its scientific
explanation in the Vedas, and is pregnant with meaning for him
who reads between the lines. The <EM>Tretagni </EM>(sacred triad
of fires) obtained by the attrition of sticks made of the wood
of the <EM>Aswattha </EM>tree (the Bo-tree, of Wisdom and Knowledge)
-- sticks &quot;as many finger-breaths long as there are syllables
in the gayatri&quot; must have a secret meaning, or else the writers
of the Vedas and Puranas were no sacred writers but mystificators.
That it has such a meaning, the Hindu Occultists are a proof,
and they alone are able to enlighten Science, as to why and how,
&quot;the fire, that was primevally <EM>one</EM>,<EM> </EM>was
made threefold (<EM>treta</EM>)<EM> </EM>in our present Manvantara,
by the Son of Ila (Vach), the primeval woman after the Deluge,
the wife and daughter of Vaivasvata Manu. The allegory is suggestive,
in whatever Purana it may be read and studied.
