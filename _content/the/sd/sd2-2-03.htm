<H4>THE &quot;HOLY OF HOLIES.&quot;<BR>
ITS DEGRADATION.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE<EM> Sanctum Sanctorum </EM>of the Ancients,<EM>
i.e</EM>., that recess on the Western side of the Temple which
was enclosed on three sides by blank walls and had its only aperture
or door hung over with a curtain -- also called the <EM>Adytum
</EM>-- was common to all ancient nations.
<P>
Nevertheless, a great difference is found between the secret meanings
of this symbolical place, in the esotericism of the Pagans and
that of later Jews; though the symbology of it was originally
identical throughout the ancient Races and Nations. The <EM>Gentiles,
</EM>by placing in the Adytum a <EM>sarcophagus, </EM>or a tomb
(<EM>taphos</EM>)<EM>, </EM>and the solar-god to whom the temple
was consecrated, held it, as Pantheists, in the greatest veneration.
They regarded it -- in its esoteric meaning -- as the symbol <EM>of
resurrection, </EM>cosmic, solar (or diurnal), and human. It embraced
the wide range of periodical and (in time) punctual, Manvantaras,
or the re-awakenings of Kosmos, Earth, and Man to new existences;
the sun being the most poetical and also the most grandiose symbol
of the same in heaven, and man -- in his re-incarnations -- on
Earth. The Jews -- whose realism, if judged by the dead letter,
was as practical and gross in the days of Moses as it is now*
-- in the course of their estrangement from the gods of their
pagan neighbours, consummated a national and levitical polity,
by the device of setting forth their Holy of Holies as the most
solemn sign of their Monotheism -- exoterically; while seeing
in it but a universal phallic symbol -- esoterically. While the
Kabalists knew but Ain-Soph and the &quot;gods&quot; of the Mysteries,
the Levites had no tomb, no god in their adytum but the &quot;Sacred&quot;
Ark of the Covenant -- their &quot;Holy of Holies.&quot;
<P>
When the esoteric meaning of this recess is made clear, however,
the profane will be better able to understand why David danced
&quot;uncovered&quot; before the <EM>ark </EM>of the Covenant,
and was so anxious to appear <EM>vile</EM> for the sake of his
&quot;Lord,&quot; and <EM>base </EM>in his own sight. (<EM>See</EM>
2<EM> Samuel vi. </EM>16-22.)

* But it was not so, in reality, witness their prophets. It is
the later Rabbis and the Talmudic scheme that killed out all spirituality
from the body of their symbols; leaving only their Scriptures
-- a dead shell, from which the Soul has departed.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 460 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
a long dissertation upon it in his Greek dictionary, and who never
breathes a word about it in the Hebrew lexicon, explains it thus:
-- &quot;[[<EM>Arche</EM>]] in this application answers to the
Hebrew <EM>rasit </EM>or wisdom . . . . a word which had the meaning
of the emblem of the female generative power, the Arg or <EM>Arca,
</EM>in which the germ of all nature was supposed to float or
brood on the great abyss during the interval which took place
after every mundane cycle.&quot; Quite so; and the Jewish <EM>ark
of the</EM> <EM>Covenant had precisely the same significance;
</EM>with the supplementary addition that, instead of a beautiful
and chaste <EM>sarcophagus </EM>(the symbol of the matrix of Nature
and resurrection) as in the <EM>Sanctum sanctorum of</EM> the
pagans, they had the ark made still more <EM>realistic </EM>in
its construction by the two cherubs set up on the coffer or ark
of the covenant, facing each other, with their wings spread in
such a manner as to form a perfect <EM>yoni </EM>(as now seen
in India). Besides which, this generative symbol had its significance
enforced by the four mystic letters of Jehovah's name, namely,
<IMG SRC="sd1-355b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">; or <IMG SRC="sd1-78c.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
meaning <EM>Jod </EM>(<EM>membrum Virile, </EM>see Kabala); <IMG SRC="sd1-78d.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
(the<EM> womb</EM>); <IMG SRC="sd1-90.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (Vau,
a crook or a hook, a nail), and <IMG SRC="sd1-78d.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
again, meaning also &quot;an opening&quot;; the whole forming
the perfect <EM>bisexual</EM> emblem or symbol or Y (e) H (o)
V (a) H, the male and female symbol.
<P>
Perhaps also, when people realise the true meaning of the office
and title of the <EM>Kadesh Kadeshim, </EM>&quot;the holy ones,&quot;
or &quot;the consecrated to <EM>the temple of the Lord,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>-- the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; of the latter may assume
an aspect far from edifying.
<P>
Iacchus again is Iao or Jehovah; and Baal or Adon, like Bacchus,
was a phallic god. &quot;Who shall ascend into the hill (the high
place) of the Lord?&quot; asks the holy king David, &quot;who
shall stand in the place of his <EM>Kadushu <IMG SRC="sd2-460.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">?&quot;
(Psalms xxiv. 3). Kadesh may mean in one sense to devote, hallow,
sanctify, </EM>and even to initiate or to set apart; but it also
means the ministry of lascivious rites (the Venus-worship) and
the true interpretation of the word Kadesh is bluntly rendered
<EM>in Deuteronomy </EM>xxiii. 17; <EM>Hosea </EM>iv. 14; and
<EM>Genesis </EM>xxxvii. from verses 15 to 22. The &quot;holy&quot;
Kadeshuth of the <EM>Bible </EM>were identical, as to the duties
of their office, with the Nautch-girls of the later Hindu pagodas.
The Hebrew <EM>Kadeshim</EM>, or galli, lived &quot;by the house
of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove,&quot;
or the bust of Venus-Astarte, says verse the seventh in the twenty-third
chapter of 2 Kings.
<P>
The dance performed by David round the ark was the &quot;circle-dance.&quot;
said to have been prescribed by the Amazons for the Mysteries.
Such was the dance of the daughters of Shiloh (<EM>Judges </EM>xxi<EM>.
</EM>21, 23 <EM>et passim</EM>)<EM>,</EM> and the leaping of the
prophets of Baal (I<EM> Kings </EM>xviii. 26). It was simply a
characteristic of the Sabean worship, for it denoted the motion
of the planets round the sun. That the dance was a Bacchic frenzy
is<HR>

<P>
apparent. Sistra were used on the occasion, and the taunt of Michal
and the King's reply are very expressive. <EM>Isis Unveiled, Vol.
II., p. </EM>49.
<P>
&quot;The Ark, in which are preserved the germs of all living
things necessary to repeople the earth, represents the survival
of life, and the supremacy of spirit over matter, through the
conflict of the opposing powers of nature. In the Astro-Theosophic
chart of the Western Rite, the Ark corresponds with the navel,
and is placed at the sinister side, the side of the woman (the
moon), one of whose symbols is the left pillar of Solomon's temple
-- <STRONG>B</STRONG>OAZ. The umbilicus is connected through the
placenta with the receptacle in which are fructified the embryos
of the race. . . The Ark is the sacred <EM>Argha </EM>of the Hindus,
and thus the relation in which it stands to Noah's ark may be
easily inferred when we learn that the Argha was an oblong vessel,
used by the high priests as a sacrificial chalice in the worship
of Isis, Astarte, and Venus-Aphrodite, all of whom were goddesses
of the generative powers of nature, or of matter -- hence representing
symbolically the Ark containing the germs of all living things.&quot;
(&quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Vol. <STRONG>II</STRONG>.,
p. 444.) Mistaken is he who accepts the Kabalistic works of to-day,
and the interpretations of the Zohar by the Rabbis, for the genuine
Kabalistic lore of old!* For no more to-day than in the day of
Frederick von Schelling does the Kabala accessible to Europe and
America, contain much more than &quot;ruins and fragments, much
distorted remnants still of that <EM>primitive system which is
the key to all religious systems</EM>&quot; (See Kabbala, by Prof.
Franck, <EM>Preface</EM>)<EM>. </EM>The oldest system and the
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The author of the &quot;Qabbalah&quot; makes several attempts
to prove conclusively the antiquity of the Zohar. Thus he shows
that Moses de Leon could not be the author or the forger of the
Zoharic works in the <STRONG>XIII</STRONG>th century, as he is
accused of being, since Ibn Gebirol gave out the same philosophical
teaching 225 years before the day of Moses de Leon. No true Kabalist
or scholar will ever deny the fact. It is certain that Ibn Gebirol
based his doctrines upon the oldest Kabalistic sources, namely,
the &quot;Chaldean Book of Numbers,&quot; as well as some no longer
extant Midrashim, the same, no doubt, as those used by Moses de
Leon. But it is just the difference between the two ways of treating
the same esoteric subjects, which, while proving the enormous
antiquity of the esoteric system, points to a decided ring of
Talmudistic and even Christian sectarianism in the compilation
and glossaries of the Zoharic system by Rabbi Moses. Ibn Gebirol
<EM>never</EM> <EM>quoted from the Scriptures </EM>to enforce
the teachings (<EM>vide </EM>I. Myer's <EM>Qabbalah, </EM>p. 7).
Moses de Leon has made of the Zohar that which it has remained
to this day, &quot;a running commentary on the . . . Books of
the Pentateuch&quot; (<EM>ibid</EM>.), with a few later additions
made by Christian hands. One follows the archaic esoteric philosophy;
the other, only that portion which was adapted to the <EM>lost
</EM>Books of Moses restored by Ezra. Thus, while the system,
or the trunk on which the primitive original Zohar was engrafted,
is of an immense antiquity many of the (later) Zoharic offshoots
are strongly coloured by the peculiar views held by Christian
Gnostics (Syrian and Chaldean), the friends and co-workers of
Moses de Leon who, as shown by Munk, accepted their interpretations.

<P>
<EM>Chaldean </EM>Kabala were identical. The latest renderings
of the <EM>Zohar </EM>are those of the Synagogue in the early
centuries -- <EM>i.e</EM>., the<EM> Thorah, </EM>dogmatic and
uncompromising.
<P>
The &quot;King's Chamber&quot; in <EM>Cheops</EM>'<EM> Pyramid
</EM>is thus an Egyptian &quot;Holy of Holies.&quot; On the days
of the Mysteries of Initiation, the candidate, representing the
solar god, had to descend into the Sarcophagus, and represent
the energizing ray, entering into the fecund womb of Nature. Emerging
from it on the following morning, he typified the resurrection
of life after the change called Death. In the great <STRONG>M</STRONG>YSTERIES
his figurative death lasted two days, when with the Sun he arose
on third morning, after a last night of the most cruel trials.
While the postulant represented the Sun -- the all-vivifying Orb
that &quot;resurrects&quot; every morning but to impart life to
all -- the Sarcophagus was symbolic of the female principle. This,
in Egypt; its form and shape changed with every country, provided
it remained a vessel, a symbolic <EM>navis </EM>or boat-shaped
vehicle, and a <EM>container,</EM> symbolically, of germs or the
germ of life. In India, it is the &quot;golden&quot; Cow through
which the candidate for Brahminism has to pass if he desires to
be a Brahmin, and to become <STRONG>D</STRONG>WIJA (&quot;reborn
a <EM>second </EM>time&quot;). The crescent-form <EM>Argha</EM>
of the Greeks was the type of the Queen of Heaven -- Diana, or
the Moon. She was the great Mother of all Existences, as the Sun
was the Father. The Jews, previous to, as well as after their
metamorphosis of Jehovah into a <EM>male </EM>god, worshipped
Astoreth, which made Isaiah declare: &quot;<EM>Your new moons
and feasts my</EM><I> </I>soul hateth,&quot; (<EM>i</EM>. 14);
saying which, he was evidently unjust. Astoreth and the New-moon
(the crescent <EM>argha</EM>)<EM> </EM>festivals, had no worse
significance as a form of public worship than had the hidden meaning
of the moon in general, which was Kabalistically connected directly
with, and sacred to, Jehovah, as is well known; with the sole
difference that one was the female and the other the male aspect
of the moon, and of the star Venus.
<P>
The Sun (the Father), the Moon (the Mother), and Mercury-Thoth
(the Son), were the earliest Trinity of the Egyptians, who personified
them in Osiris, Isis, and Thoth (Hermes). In [[<EM>PISTIS SOPHIA</EM>]],
the seven great gods, divided into two triads and the highest
God (the Sun) are: the lower [[<EM>Tridunameis</EM>]], whose powers
reside respectively in Mars, Mercury and Venus; and the higher
Triad (&quot;the three unseen gods&quot;) who dwell in the Moon,
Jupiter and Saturn; (<EM>vide</EM> &#167;&#167; 359 and 361 <EM>et
seq</EM>)<EM>.</EM> 
<P>
This requires no proof. Astoreth was in one sense an impersonal
symbol of nature, the ship of Life carrying throughout the boundless
Sidereal Ocean the germs of all being. And when she was not identified
with Venus, like every other &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot; to whom
cakes and buns were offered in sacrifice, Astoreth became the
reflection of the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 463 CHRISTIAN SYMBOLISM</H6>

<P>
Chaldean &quot;Nuah, the Universal Mother&quot; (female Noah,
considered as one with the ark), and of the female triad, Ana,
Belita and Davikina; called, when blended into one, &quot;Sovereign
goddess, lady of the Nether Abyss, Mother of gods, Queen of the
Earth, and Queen of fecundity.&quot; Later, Belita or <EM>Damti
</EM>(the sea), the Mother of <EM>the City</EM> <EM>of Erech </EM>(the
great Chaldean Necropolis) became Eve; and now she is Mary the
Virgin, in the Latin Church, represented as standing on the crescent-moon,
and, at times on the Globe, to vary the programme. The <EM>navi</EM>,
or ship-like form of the crescent, which blends in itself all
those common symbols of the ship of life, such as Noah's ark,
the Yoni of the Hindus, and the ark of the Covenant, is the female
symbol of the Universal &quot;Mothers of the gods,&quot; and is
now found under its Christian <EM>symbol</EM> in every Church,
as the nave (from<EM> navis, </EM>the ship).* The <EM>navis </EM>--
the Sidereal vessel -- is fructified by the Spirit of Life --
the male God; or, as the learned Kenealy (in his <EM>Apocalypsis</EM>)<EM>
</EM>calls it very appropriately -- the Holy Spirit. In Western
religious symbology the Crescent was the male, the full moon,
the female aspect of that universal Spirit. &quot;The mystic word
<EM>Alm</EM>, which the prophet Mahomet prefixed to many chapters
of the Koran, alludes to <EM>her </EM>as the <EM>Alm, </EM>the
immaculate Virgin of the heavens. And -- the sublime ever falling
into the ridiculous -- it is from this root <EM>Alm</EM> that
we have to derive the word <EM>Almeh </EM>-- the Egyptian dancing-girls.
The latter are &quot;Virgins&quot; of the same type as the <EM>Nautchnis
</EM>in India, and the (female) <EM>Kadeshim, </EM>the Holy Ones
of the Jewish temples (those consecrated to Jehovah, who represented
both sexes), whose holy functions in the Israelite fanes were
<EM>identical </EM>with those of the Nautchnis.
<P>
Now Eustathius declares that ([<EM>IO</EM>]) <STRONG>IO </STRONG>means
the <EM>moon, </EM>in the dialect of the <EM>Argians; </EM>and
it was one of the names of the same in Egypt. Says Jablonski,
&quot;[[<EM>IO</EM>]], Ioh<EM>, AEgyptiis </EM><STRONG>L</STRONG>UNAM<EM>
significat neque</EM> <EM>habent illi in communi sermonis usu,
aliud nomen quo Lunam, designent</EM> <EM>praeter IO.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>The pillar and Circle (<STRONG>IO</STRONG>), now constituting
the first decimal number, and which with Pythagoras was the perfect
number contained in the <EM>Tetractis,** </EM>became later a <EM>pre</EM>-<EM>eminently
phallic Number</EM> -- amongst the Jews, foremost of all, with
whom it is the male and female Jehovah.
<P>
This is how a scholar explains it: --
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Timaeus, the Locrian, speaking of <EM>Arka, </EM>calls her &quot;the
Principle of best things.&quot; The word <EM>arcane</EM>, &quot;hidden,&quot;
or secret, is derived from <EM>Arka</EM>. &quot;To no one is the
<EM>Arcane </EM>shown except to the most High&quot; (<EM>Codex
Nazareus</EM>)<EM>, </EM>alluding to nature the female, and Spirit,
the male Power. All the Sun-Gods were called <EM>Archagetos</EM>
&quot;born from the <EM>Arka,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>the divine Virgin-Mother
of the Heavens.

<P>
&quot;I find, on the Rosetta stone of Uhlemann, the word <EM>mouth,
</EM>also in Seiffarth, viz., the name of <EM>the Moon </EM>used
as a cycle of Time, hence the <EM>lunar month </EM>from the hieroglyph
<IMG SRC="sd2-464a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> with <IMG SRC="sd2-464b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
and <IMG SRC="sd1-4b.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> as determinatives given,
as the Coptic <STRONG>I O H</STRONG>, or <STRONG>I O H</STRONG>.
The Hebrew <IMG SRC="sd2-464c.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> may also be
used as <STRONG>I O H</STRONG>, for the letter <EM>yau, </EM>or
<IMG SRC="sd1-90.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">, was used for <EM>o </EM>and
for <EM>u</EM>, and for<EM> v</EM> or <EM>w</EM>. This, before
the <EM>Massora, </EM>of which the <STRONG>.</STRONG> was used
as <IMG SRC="sd2-464d.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> = o, <IMG SRC="sd2-464e.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
= u, and <IMG SRC="sd1-90.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> = v or w. Now I
had worked it out by original search that the great distinctive
function of the god-name Jehovah was designative of the influence
of the moon as the <EM>causative </EM>of<EM> generation, </EM>and
as of its exact value as a lunar year in the natural <EM>measure
of days, </EM>as you will fully see, . . . . And here comes this
linguistic same word from a source far more ancient; viz., the
Coptic, or rather from the old Egyptian in time of the Coptic.&quot;.
. . . (From a <STRONG>MS</STRONG>.)
<P>
This is the more remarkable when Egyptology compares this with
the little which it knows about the Theban triad -- composed of
<EM>Ammon, Mouth, </EM>(or<EM> Mout</EM>) and their son <EM>Khonsoo.
</EM>This triad was, when united, contained in the moon as their
common symbol; and when separated, it was <EM>Khonsoo </EM>who
was the god, <STRONG>L</STRONG>UNUS, being thus confounded with
Thot and Phtah. His mother Mout(<EM>h</EM>) -- the name signifying
<EM>Mother, </EM>by the bye, not the <EM>moon, </EM>which was
only her Symbol -- is called the &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;;
the &quot;Virgin,&quot; etc., etc., as she is an aspect of Isis,
Hathor, and other mother goddesses. She was less the wife than
the mother of Ammon, whose distinct title is &quot;the husband
of his Mother.&quot; In a <EM>statuette </EM>at Boulaq, Cairo,
this triad is represented (<EM>Number </EM>1981 <EM>Serapeum,
Greek Period</EM>)<EM> </EM>as a mummy-god holding in his hand
three different sceptres, and bearing the lunar disc on his head,
the characteristic tress of hair showing the design of representing
it as that of <EM>an infant </EM>god, or &quot;the Sun,&quot;
in the triad. He was the god of Destinies in Thebes, and appears
under two aspects (1) as &quot;Khonsoo, the Lunar god, and Lord
of Thebes, <EM>Nofir</EM>-<EM>hotpoo </EM>--<EM> </EM><I>'</I><EM>he</EM><I>
</I>who is in absolute repose'; and (2) as Khonsoo <EM>Iri</EM>-<EM>sokhroo,
</EM>or 'Khonsoo, who executes Destiny': the former preparing
the events and conceiving them for those born under his generative
influence; the latter putting them into action.&quot; (<EM>See
Maspero</EM>'<EM>s Definitions</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Under theogonic
permutations Ammon becomes Horus, <STRONG>HOR-AMMON</STRONG>,
and Mout(h)-Isis is seen suckling him in a statuette of the Saitic
period. (<EM>Abydos.</EM>) In his turn, in this transformed triad,
Khonsoo becomes <EM>Thot</EM>-<EM>Lunus,</EM> &quot;he who operates
salvation.&quot; His brow is crowned with the head of an <EM>ibis</EM>
decorated with the<I> lunar </I>disc and the diadem called IO-<I>tef</I>.
<P>
Now all these symbols are certainly found reflected in (some believe
them identical with) the <EM>Yave, </EM>or Jehovah of the Bible.
This will be<HR>

made plain to any one who reads &quot;<EM>The Source of Measures,</EM>&quot;<EM>
or </EM>&quot;<EM>Hebrew</EM> <EM>Egyptian Mystery,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>and understands the undeniable, clear, and mathematical proofs
that the <EM>esoteric foundations, </EM>or the system used in
the building of the Great Pyramid, and the architectural measurements
in the Temple of Solomon (whether the latter be mythical or real),
Noah's ark, and the ark of the Covenant, are the same. If anything
in the world can settle the dispute that the old, as much as the
later, Jews (post-Babylonian), and especially the former, built
their theogony and religion on the very same foundation as all
Pagans did, it is the work in question.
<P>
And now it may be as well to remind the reader of that which was
said of <STRONG>I A O</STRONG>, in our work, &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled.</EM>&quot;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;No other deity affords such a variety of etymologies as
Jaho, nor is there any name which can be so variously pronounced.
It is only by associating it with the Masoretic points that the
later Rabbins succeeded in making Jehovah read 'Adonai' -- or
Lord, as Philo Byblus spells it in Greek letters [[IEUO]] -- <STRONG>IEVO</STRONG>.
Theodoret says that the Samaritans pronounced it Jahe (yahra),
and the Jews Yaho; which would make it as we have shown, I --
Ah -- O. Diodorus states that 'among the Jews they relate that
Moses called the god Iao.' It is on the authority of the <EM>Bible
</EM>itself, therefore, that we maintain that before his initiation
by Jethro, his father-in-law, Moses had never known the word Jaho.&quot;*
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The above receives corroboration in a private letter from a very
learned Kabalist. In <STRONG>S</STRONG>TANZA <STRONG>IV</STRONG>.
and elsewhere it is stated that exoterically Brahma (neuter),
so flippantly and so often confused by the Orientalists with Brahma
-- the male, is sometimes called <EM>Kala</EM>-<EM>hansa </EM>(Swan
in the eternity), and the esoteric meaning of <EM>A</EM>-<EM>ham</EM>-<EM>sa,
</EM>is given. (I -- <EM> am</EM> -- he,<EM> so ham </EM>being
equal to <EM>sah </EM>&quot;he,&quot; and <EM>aham</EM> &quot;I&quot;<EM>
</EM>-- a mystic anagram and permutation). It is also the &quot;four-faced&quot;
Brahma, the <EM>Chatur mukha </EM>(the perfect cube) forming itself
<EM>within,</EM> and<EM> from </EM>the infinite circle; and again
the use of the 1, 3, 5, and <IMG SRC="sd2-465.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
= 14, as the esoteric hierarchy of the Dhyan Chohans is explained.
On this, the said correspondent comments in this way: --

especially 13,514, which on a circle may be read as 31415 (or

* The student must be aware that Jethro is called the &quot;father-in-law&quot;
of Moses; not because Moses was really married to one of his seven
daughters. Moses was an Initiate, if he ever existed, and as such
an ascetic, a nazar, and could never be married. It is an allegory
like everything else. Zipporah (the shining) is one of the personified
Occult Sciences given by Revel-Jethro, the Midian priest Initiator,
to Moses, his Egyptian pupil. The &quot;well&quot; by which Moses
sat down in his flight from the Pharaoh symbolizes the &quot;well
of Knowledge.&quot;

Adam, as the supposed great &quot;Progenitor of the human race,&quot;
is, as Adam Kadmon, made in the <EM>image </EM>of God -- a priapic
image, therefore. The Hebrew words <EM>sacr </EM>and<EM> n</EM>'<EM>cabvah
</EM>are, literally translated, <EM>lingham </EM>(phallus) and
<EM>yoni</EM>, notwithstanding their translation in th<EM>e</EM><I>
</I>Bible (<EM>Genesis i. v</EM>. 27.) &quot;male and female.&quot;
As said there &quot;God creates '<EM>Man in his own image'</EM>.
. . . . in the image of God<EM> </EM>created he him, <EM>male
and female </EM>created he them,&quot; the androgyne Adam-Kadmon.
Now this Kabalistic name is not that of a living man, nor even
of a human or divine Being, but of the two sexes or organs of
procreation, called in Hebrew with that usual sincerity of language
pre-eminently Biblical, <EM>sacr </EM>and<EM> n</EM>'<EM>cabvah</EM>*;
these two being, therefore<EM>,</EM> the <EM>image </EM>under
which the &quot;Lord God&quot; appeared usually to his chosen
people. That this is so, is now undeniably proven by almost all
the symbologists and Hebrew scholars as well as by the Kabala.
Therefore Adam is in one sense Jehovah. This makes plain another
general tradition in the East mentioned in <EM>Gregorie</EM>'<EM>s
</EM>&quot;<EM>Notes and Observations upon several</EM> <EM>passages

prayed in the ark before the BODY OF <STRONG>A</STRONG>DAM,&quot;
or before the Phallus in the <EM>ark, </EM>or Holy of Holies,
again. He who is a Kabalist and accustomed to the incessant permutation
of Biblical names, once they are interpreted numerically and symbolically,
will understand what is meant. Jehovah, from the two words of
which his name is composed, &quot;makes up the original idea of
male-female as birth-originator, for the <IMG SRC="sd1-78c.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
was the <EM>membrum virile </EM>and<EM> Houak </EM>was<EM> Eve</EM>.&quot;
So . . . &quot;the<EM> perfect one, </EM>as originator of measures,
takes also the form of <EM>birth </EM>origin, as <EM>hermaphrodite
one; </EM>hence the phallic use of form.&quot; (&quot;<EM>Source

<P>
The above affords, then, a key to the said traditions. Noah, a
divine permutation, the supposed saviour of Humanity, who carries
in his ark or <EM>argha </EM>(the moon), the germs of all living
things, worships before the &quot;body of Adam,&quot; which body
is the image of, and a<EM> Creator </EM>itself. Hence Adam is
called the &quot;Prophet of the Moon,&quot; the <EM>Argha </EM>or
&quot;Holy of Holies&quot; of the <IMG SRC="sd1-78c.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
(Yodh). This also shows the origin of the Jewish popular belief
that the face of Moses <EM>is in the moon</EM> -- <EM>i.e., </EM>the
spots in the Moon. For Moses and Jehovah are once more permutations,
as has been shown Kabalistically. Says the author of the &quot;Source
of Measures&quot; (<EM>p</EM>. 271): &quot;There is one fact in
regard to Moses and his works too important to be omitted. When
he is instructed by the Lord as to his mission, the <EM>power</EM>

words being: --

Moses to be a form of Jehovah in this combination. 21 &#247;<EM>

<P>
The &quot;Holy of Holies,&quot; both Kabalistic and Rabbinical,
are thus shown as an international symbol, and common property.
Neither has originated with the Hebrews; but owing to the too
realistic handling of the half-initiated Levites, the symbol has
with them acquired a significance which it hardly has with any
other people to this day,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 469 THE OLD AND THE NEW JEHOVAH. </H6>

<P>
and which it was originally never meant to have by the true Kabalist.
The<EM> Lingham </EM>and<EM> Yoni </EM>of the modern average Hindu
is, on the face of it, of course, no better than the Rabbinical
&quot;Holy of Holies,&quot; -- but <EM>it is</EM> <EM>no worse;
</EM>and this is a point gained on the Christian traducers of
the Asiatic religious philosophies. For, in such religious myths,
in the hidden symbolism of a creed and philosophy, the <EM>spirit
</EM>of the tenets propounded ought to decide their relative value.
And who will say, that, examined either way, this so-called &quot;Wisdom,&quot;
applied solely to the uses and benefit of one little nation, has
ever developed in it anything like national ethics. The Prophets
are there, to show the walk in life, before, during, and after
the days of Moses, of the chosen but &quot;stiff-necked&quot;
people. That they have had at one time the Wisdom-Religion and
use of the universal language and its symbols at their disposal
and in their possession, is proved by the same esotericism existing
to this day in India with regard to the &quot;Holy of Holies.&quot;
This, as said, was and still is the passage through the &quot;golden&quot;
cow <EM>in the</EM> <EM>same stooping position </EM>as the one
shown in the gallery of the pyramid, which identified man with
Jehovah in Hebrew esotericism. The whole difference lies in the
Spirit of Interpretation. With the Hindus as with the ancient
Egyptians that spirit was and is entirely metaphysical and psychological;
with the Hebrews it was <EM>realistic</EM> and<EM> physiological.
</EM>It pointed to the first sexual separation of the human race
(Eve giving birth to Cain-Jehovah, as shown in the &quot;Source
of Measures&quot;); to the consummation of terrestrial physiological
union and conception (as in the allegory of Cain shedding Abel's
blood --<EM> Habel, </EM>the feminine principle) and -- child-bearing;
a process shown to have begun in the Third Race, or with Adam's
THIRD <EM>son, </EM>Seth, with whose son Henoch, men began to
call themselves <EM>Jehovah </EM>or<EM> Jah</EM>-<EM>hovah, </EM>the
male Jod and Havah or Eve -- to wit, <EM>male and female beings</EM>.*<EM>
</EM>Thus the difference lies in the religious and ethical feeling,
but the two symbols are identical. There is no doubt that, with
the fully initiated Judaean Tanaim, the inner sense of the symbolism
was as holy in its abstraction as with the ancient Aryan Dwijas.
The worship of the &quot;god in the ark&quot; dates only from
David; and for a thousand years Israel knew of no phallic Jehovah.
And now the old Kabala, edited and re-edited, has become tainted
with it.
<P>
With the ancient Aryans the hidden meaning was grandiose, sublime,
and poetical, however much the external appearance of their symbol
may <EM>now </EM>militate against the claim. The ceremony of passing

<P>
the Holy of Holies (now symbolized by the cow), in the beginning
through the temple <EM>Hiranya gharba </EM>(the radiant Egg) --
in itself a symbol of Universal, abstract nature -- meant spiritual
conception and birth, or rather the <EM>re</EM>-<EM>birth </EM>of
the individual and his regeneration: the <EM>stooping</EM> man
at the entrance of the <EM>Sanctum Sanctorum, </EM>ready to pass
through the matrix of mother nature, or the physical creature
ready to re-become the original spiritual Being, pre-natal <STRONG>M</STRONG>AN.
With the Semite, that <EM>stooping </EM>man meant the <EM>fall
</EM>of Spirit into matter, and that <EM>fall</EM> and <EM>degradation
</EM>were apotheosized by him with the result of dragging Deity
down to the level of man. For the Aryan, the symbol represented
the divorce of Spirit from matter, its merging into and return
to its primal Source; for the Semite, the wedlock of spiritual
man with material female nature, the physiological being taking
pre-eminence over the psychological and the purely immaterial.
The Aryan views of the symbolism were those of the whole Pagan
world; the Semite interpretations emanated from, and were pre-eminently
those of a small tribe, thus marking its national features and
the idiosyncratic defects that characterize many of the Jews to
this day -- gross realism, selfishness, and sensuality. They had
made a bargain, through their father Jacob, with their tribal
deity, self-exalted above all others, and a <EM>covenant </EM>that
his &quot;seed shall be as the dust of the earth&quot;; and that
deity could have no better image henceforth than that of the symbol
of generation, and, as representation, a <EM>number </EM>and numbers.
<P>
Carlyle has wise words for both these nations. With the Hindu
Aryan -- the most metaphysical and spiritual people on earth --
religion has ever been, in his words, &quot;an everlasting lode-star,
that beams the brighter in the heavens the darker here on earth
grows the night around him.&quot; The religion of the Hindu detaches
him from this earth; therefore, even now, the cow-symbol is one
of the grandest and most philosophical among all others in its
inner meaning. To the &quot;<STRONG>M</STRONG>ASTERS&quot; and
&quot;Lords&quot; of European potencies -- the Israelites -- certain
words of Carlyle apply still more admirably; for them &quot;religion
is a wise prudential feeling grounded on <EM>mere calculation</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>-- and it was so from its beginnings. Having burdened themselves
with it, Christian nations feel bound to defend and <EM>poetise
</EM>it, at the expense of all other religions.
<P>
But it was not so with the ancient nations. For them the passage
entrance and the sarcophagus in the King's chamber meant regeneration
-- not generation. It was the most solemn symbol, a <EM>Holy of
Holies, </EM>indeed, wherein were created immortal Hierophants
and &quot;Sons of God&quot; -- never mortal men and Sons of lust
and flesh -- as now in the hidden sense of the Semite Kabalist.
The reason for the difference in the views of the two races is
easy to account for. The Aryan Hindu belongs to the oldest races
now on earth; the Semite Hebrew to the latest. One is nearly one

<P>
million years old; the other is a small sub-race some 8,000 years
old and no more.*
<P>
But Phallic worship has developed only with the gradual loss of
the keys to the inner meaning of religious symbols; and there
was a day when the Israelites had beliefs as pure as the Aryans
have. But now Judaism, built <EM>solely </EM>on Phallic worship,
has become one of the latest creeds in Asia, and theologically
a religion of hate and malice toward everyone and everything outside
themselves. Philo Judaeus shows what was the genuine Hebrew faith.
The sacred Writings, he says, prescribe what we ought to do .
. . <EM>commanding us to hate the heathen and their</EM> <EM>laws
and institutions. </EM>They did hate Baal or Bacchus worship publicly,
but left its worst features to be followed secretly; and it is
with the Talmudic Jews that the grand symbols of nature were the
most profaned. With them, as now shown by the discovery of the
key to the correct Bible reading -- Geometry, the <I>fifth </I>divine
Science (&quot;fifth&quot; -- because it is the <EM>fifth key
</EM>in the series of the Seven Keys to the Universal esoteric
language and symbology) was desecrated, and by them applied to
conceal the most terrestrial and grossly sexual mysteries, wherein
both Deity and religion were degraded.
<P>
We are told that it is just the same with our Brahma-prajapati,
with Osiris and all other <EM>creative </EM>gods. Quite so, when
their rites are judged exoterically and externally; the reverse
when their <EM>inner</EM> meaning is unveiled, as we see. The
Hindu Lingham is identical with &quot;Jacob's <EM>Pillar</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>-- most undeniably. But the difference, as said, seems to
consist in that the esoteric significance of the <EM>Lingham </EM>was
too truly sacred and metaphysical to be revealed to the profane
and the vulgar; hence its superficial appearance was left to the
speculations of the mob. Nor would the Aryan Hierophant and Brahmin,
in their proud exclusiveness and the satisfaction of their knowledge,
go to the trouble of concealing its primeval <EM>nakedness </EM>under
cunningly devised fables; whereas the Rabbi, having interpreted
the symbol to suit his own tendencies, had to veil the crude significance;
and this served a double purpose -- that of keeping his secret
to himself and of exalting himself

* Strictly speaking, the Jews are an artificial Aryan race, born
in India, and belonging to the Caucasian division. No one who
is familiar with the Armenians and the Parsis can fail to recognize
in the three the same Aryan, Caucasian type. From the seven primitive
types of the Fifth Race there now remain on Earth but three. As
Prof. W. H. Flower aptly said in 1885, &quot;I cannot resist the
conclusion so often arrived at by various anthropologists -- that
the primitive man, whatever he may have been, has in the course
of ages diverged into three extreme types, represented by the
Caucasian of Europe, the Mongolian of Asia, and the Ethiopian
of Africa, and that all existing individuals of the species can
be ranged around these types. . . . &quot; (The President's address

<I>Law</I> commanded him to hate.* A commandment now gladly accepted
by the Christian too, in spite of another and later commandment
-- &quot;love each other.&quot; Both India and Egypt had and have
their sacred lotuses, symbolic of the same &quot;Holy of Holies&quot;
-- the Lotus growing in the water, a double feminine symbol --
the <EM>bearer </EM>of its own seed and root of all. Viraj and
Horus are both male symbols, emanating from <EM>androgyne Nature,</EM>
one from Brahma and his female counterpart Vach, the other, from
Osiris and Isis -- never from the One infinite God. In the Judaeo-Christian
systems it is different. Whereas the lotus, containing Brahma,
the Universe, is shown growing out of Vishnu's <I>navel</I>, the<EM>
Central point</EM> in the Waters of Infinite Space, and whereas
Horus springs from the lotus of the <EM>Celestial </EM>Nile<EM>
</EM>-- all these abstract pantheistic ideas are dwarfed and made
terrestrially concrete in the Bible: one is almost inclined to
say that in the <EM>esoteric </EM>they are <EM>grosser and still
more</EM> <EM>anthropomorphic, </EM>than in their <EM>exoteric
</EM>rendering. Take as an example the same symbol, even in its
Christian application; the <EM>lilies </EM>in the hand of the
Archangel Gabriel (<EM>Luke i. </EM>28). In Hinduism -- the &quot;Holy
of Holies&quot; is a universal abstraction, whose <EM>dramatis
personae </EM>are Infinite Spirit and Nature; in Christian Judaism,
it is a <EM>personal </EM>God<EM>, outside</EM> of that Nature,
and the human Womb -- Eve, Sarah, etc., etc.; hence, an anthropomorphic
phallic god, and his image -- man.
<P>
Thus it is maintained, that with regard to the contents of the
Bible, one of two hypotheses has to be admitted. Either behind
the symbolic substitute -- Jehovah -- there was the unknown, incognizable
Diety, the Kabalistic Ain-Soph; or, the Jews have been from the
beginning, no better than the dead-letter <EM>Lingham</EM>-**
worshippers of the India of to-day. We say it was the former;
and that, therefore, the secret or esoteric worship of the Jews
was the same Pantheism that the Vedantin philosophers are reproached
with to-day; Jehovah was a <EM>substitute </EM>for purposes of
an exoteric national faith, and had no importance or reality in
the eyes of the erudite priests and philosophers -- the Sadducees,

a slur on the religion of <EM>the one, true living God. </EM>To
this Faber says very justly &quot;Some have imagined that the

point of similitude was borrowed from the Mosaical Institutes.
But this theory will by no means solve the problem: both because

</EM>worship such a gross symbol, and minister unto it, seeing

reader turn to <EM>Gemara Sanhedrin </EM>and judge. As various
writers have shown, and as brutally stated in Hargrave Jennings'
<EM>Phallicism </EM>(p. 67) &quot;<EM>We know from the Jewish
records </EM>that the Ark contained a <EM>table of stone</EM>.

name <EM>Jehovah </EM>. . . which written in unpointed Hebrew
with four letters, is <STRONG>J-E-V-E</STRONG> or <STRONG>JHVH</STRONG>
(the H being merely an aspirate and the same as E). This process
leaves us the two letters I and V (in another form U); then if
we place the I <I>in </I>the U we have the 'Holy of Holies'; we
also have the Lingha and Yoni and Argha of the Hindus, the Isvara
and 'supreme Lord'; and here we have the whole secret of its mystic
and arc-celestial import, confirmed in itself by being identical
with the Linyoni (?) of the Ark of the Covenant.&quot;

The Biblical Jews of to-day do not date from Moses but from David
-- even admitting the identity of the old genuine with the later
and remodelled Mosaic scrolls. Before that time their nationality
is lost in the mists of prehistoric darkness, the veil from which
is now withdrawn as much as we have space to do so. It is only
to the days of the Babylonian captivity that the Old Testament
may be referred by the most lenient criticism, as the approximately
correct views that were current about the days of Moses. Even
such fanatical Christians and worshippers of Jehovah as the Rev.
Mr. Horne, have to admit the numerous changes and alterations
made by the later compilers of the &quot;Book of God,&quot; since
it was <EM>found </EM>by Hilkiah (<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Introduction

date than the <EM>Elohim </EM>symbols and is borrowed from the
Pagan <EM>exoteric </EM>rites; and Jehovah is thus on a par with
the <EM>Lingham and Yoni </EM>found on every road-side in India.
<P>
Just as the <STRONG>IAO </STRONG>of the mysteries was distinct
from Jehovah, so was the later Iao and Abraxas of some Gnostic
sects identical with the god of the Hebrews, who was the same
with the Egyptian Horus. This is undeniably proven on &quot;heathen&quot;
as on the Gnostic &quot;Christian&quot; gems. In Matter's collection
of such gems there is a &quot;Horus&quot; seated on the lotus,
inscribed [[<EM>ABRASAXIAO</EM>]] (Abraxas Iao) -- an address
exactly parallel to the so frequent [[<EM>EIS ZETS SARAPI</EM>]]
(<EM>Eis zets sarapi</EM>)<EM> </EM>on the contemporary Heathen
gems; and therefore only to be translated by &quot;Abraxas is
the One Jehovah&quot; (King's <EM>Gnostics, </EM>p. 327). But
who was Abraxas? As the same author shows -- &quot;the numerical
or Kabalistic value of the name Abraxas directly refer to the
Persian title of the god 'Mithra,' Ruler of the year, worshipped
from the earliest times under the appellation of Iao.&quot; Thus,
the Sun, in one aspect, the moon or the Lunar genius, in another,
that generative deity whom the Gnostics saluted as &quot;Thou
that presidest over the Mysteries of the Father and the Son, who
shinest in the night-time, holding <EM>the second rank, </EM>the
first Lord of Death.&quot;
<P>
It is only in his capacity of the genius of the moon, the latter
being credited in the old cosmogony with being the parent of our
Earth, that Jehovah could ever be regarded as the <EM>creator
</EM>of our globe and <EM>its </EM>Heaven, namely, the Firmament.
<P>
The knowledge of all this will be no proof, however, to the average
bigot. Missionaries will go on with the most virulent attacks
on the religions of India, and Christians read with the same benighted
smile of satisfaction as ever these preposterously unjust words
of Coleridge, &quot;It is highly worthy of observation that the
inspired writings received by Christians <EM>are distinguishable
from all other books </EM>PRETENDING TO INSPIRATION, from the
Scriptures of the Brahmins, and even from the Koran, in their
strong and frequent <EM>recommendation of </EM>TRUTH (! !). .
