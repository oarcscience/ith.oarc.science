<H4>I.<BR>
REASONS FOR THESE ADDENDA.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>M</STRONG>ANY of the doctrines contained in the foregoing
Seven Stanzas and Commentaries having been studied and critically
examined by some Western Theosophists, certain of the occult teachings
have been found wanting from the ordinary stand-point of modern
scientific knowledge. They seemed to encounter insuperable difficulties
in the way of their acceptance, and to require reconsideration
in view of scientific criticism. Some friends have already been
tempted to regret the necessity of so often calling in question
the assertions of modern Science. It appeared to them -- and I
here repeat only their arguments -- that &quot;to run counter
to the teachings of its most eminent exponents, was to court a
premature discomfiture in the eyes of the Western World.&quot;
<P>
It is, therefore, desirable to define once and for all the position
which the writer, who does not agree in this with her friends,
intends to maintain. So far as Science remains what in the words
of Prof. Huxley it is, viz., &quot;organized common sense&quot;;
so far as its inferences are drawn from accurate premises -- its
generalizations resting on a purely inductive basis -- every Theosophist
and Occultist welcomes respectfully and with due admiration its
contributions to the domain of cosmological law. There can be
no possible conflict between the teachings of occult and so-called
exact Science, where the conclusions of the latter are grounded
on a substratum of unassailable fact. It is only when its more
ardent exponents, over-stepping the limits of observed phenomena
in order to penetrate into the arcana of Being, attempt to wrench
the formation of Kosmos and its <EM>living </EM>Forces from Spirit,
and attribute all to blind matter, that the Occultists claim the
right to dispute and call in question their theories. Science
cannot, owing to the very nature of things, unveil the mystery
of the universe around us. Science can, it is true, collect, classify,
and generalize upon phenomena; but the occultist, arguing from
admitted metaphysical data, declares that the daring explorer,
who would probe the inmost secrets of Nature, must transcend the
narrow limitations of sense, and transfer his consciousness into
the region of noumena and the sphere of primal causes. To effect
this, he must develop faculties which are absolutely<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 478 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
dormant -- save in a few rare and exceptional cases -- in the
constitution of the off-shoots of our present Fifth Root-race
in Europe and America. He can in no other conceivable manner collect
the facts on which to base his speculations. Is this not apparent
on the principles of Inductive Logic and Metaphysics alike?
<P>
On the other hand, whatever the writer may do, she will never
be able to satisfy both Truth and Science. To offer the reader
a systematic and uninterrupted version of the Archaic Stanzas
is impossible. A gap of 43 verses or <EM>Slokas </EM>has to be
left between the 7th (already given) and the 51st, which is the
subject of Book II., though the latter are made to run from 1
<EM>et seq. </EM>for easier reading and reference. The appearance
of man on Earth alone occupies as many stanzas, which describe
minutely his primal evolution from the human Dhyan Chohans; the
state of the globe at that time, etc., etc. A great number of
names referring to chemical substances and other compounds, which
have now ceased to combine together, and are therefore unknown
to the later offshoots of our Fifth Race, occupy a considerable
space. As they are simply untranslateable, and would remain in
every case inexplicable, they are omitted, along with those which
cannot be made public. Nevertheless, even the little that is given
will irritate any follower and defender of dogmatic materialistic
Science who happens to read this.
<P>
Before proceeding to other Stanzas, it is proposed, therefore,
to defend those already given. They are not in perfect accord
or harmony with modern Science -- this we all know. Had they been,
however, as much in agreement with the views of modern knowledge
as a lecture by Sir W. Thomson, they would have been rejected
all the same. For they teach belief in conscious Powers and Spiritual
Entities; in terrestrial, semi-intelligent, and highly intellectual
Forces on other planes*; and in Beings that dwell around us in
spheres imperceptible, whether through telescope or microscope.
Hence the necessity of examining the beliefs of materialistic
Science: of comparing its views about the &quot;Elements&quot;
with the opinions of the ancients, and of analysing the physical
Forces as they exist in modern perception before the Occultists
admit themselves to be in the wrong. We shall touch upon the constitution
of the Sun and planets, and the occult characteristics of what
are called <EM>Devas </EM>and<EM> Genii</EM>, and are now termed
by Science, Force, or &quot;modes of motion,&quot; and see whether
esoteric belief is defensible or not (<EM>Vide infra</EM>, &quot;<EM>Gods</EM>,<EM>
Monads</EM>,<EM> and Atoms</EM>)&quot;.<EM> </EM>Notwithstanding
the efforts made to the contrary, an unprejudiced mind will discover

to any we can conceive of on Earth.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 479 DUAL NATURE OF THE SUN.</H6>

<P>
under Newton's &quot;agent, material or immaterial&quot; (of his
third letter to Bentley), the agent which <EM>causes gravity</EM>,
and, in his personal <EM>working </EM>God, one finds just as much
of the metaphysical <EM>devas </EM>and<EM> genii</EM>, as in Kepler's
<EM>angelus rector </EM>conducting each planet, and the <EM>species
immateriata </EM>by which the celestial bodies were carried along
in their courses, according to that astronomer.
<P>
We shall have, in Book II., to openly approach dangerous subjects.
We must bravely face Science and declare, in the teeth of materialistic
learning, of Idealism, Hylo-Idealism, Positivism and all-denying
modern Psychology, that the true Occultist believes in &quot;Lords
of Light;&quot; that he believes in a Sun, which, far from being
simply &quot;a lamp of day&quot; moving in accordance with physical
law, and far from being merely one of those Suns, which according
to Richter -- &quot;. . . . are Sun-flowers of a higher light&quot;
-- is, like milliards of other Suns, the dwelling or the vehicle
of a god, and a host of gods.
<P>
In this question, of course, it is the Occultists who will be
worsted. They will be considered on the <EM>prima facie </EM>aspect
of the dispute to be ignoramuses, and labelled with more than
one of the usual epithets given to those whom the superficially
judging public, itself ignorant of the great underlying truths
in nature, accuses of believing in mediaeval superstitions. Let
it be so. Submitting beforehand to every criticism in order to
go on with their task, they only claim the privilege of showing
that the physicists are as much at loggerheads among themselves
in their speculations, as the latter are with the teachings of
Occultism.
<P>
The Sun is matter, and the Sun is Spirit. Our ancestors -- the
&quot;heathen,&quot; -- along with their modern successors, the
Parsis -- were, and are, wise enough in their generation to see
in it the symbol of Divinity, and at the same time to sense within,
concealed by the physical Symbol, the bright God of Spiritual
and terrestrial Light. Such belief is now regarded as a superstition
only by rank materialism, which denies Deity, Spirit, Soul, and
admits no intelligence outside the mind of man. But if too much
of wrong superstition bred by &quot;Churchianity&quot; -- as Lawrence
Oliphant calls it -- &quot;renders a man a fool,&quot; too much
scepticism makes him mad. We prefer the charge of folly in believing
too much, to that of a madness which denies everything, as do
Materialism and Idealism. Hence, the Occultists are fully prepared
to receive their dues from Materialism, and to meet the adverse
criticism which will be poured on this work, not for writing it,
but <EM>for believing in that which it contains.</EM> 
<P>
Therefore the discoveries, hypotheses, and unavoidable objections
which will be brought forward by the scientific critics must be
anticipated and disposed of. It has also to be shown how far the
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 480 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
occult teachings depart from real science, and whether the ancient
or the modern theories are the most logically and philosophically
correct. The unity and mutual relations of all parts of Kosmos
were known to the ancients, before they became evident to modern
astronomers and philosophers. And if even the external and visible
portions of the Universe and their mutual relations cannot be
explained in any other terms than those used by the adherents
of the mechanical theory of the Universe in physical science,
it follows that no materialist, who denies that the Soul of Kosmos
(which appertains to metaphysical philosophy) exists, has the
right to trespass upon that metaphysical domain. That physical
science is trying to, and actually does, encroach upon it, is
only one more proof that &quot;might is right,&quot; and no more.
<P>
Another good reason for these Addenda is this. Since only a certain
portion of the Secret teachings can be given out in the present
age, if they were published without any explanations or commentary,
the doctrines would never be understood even by theosophists.
Therefore they must be contrasted with the speculations of modern
science. Archaic axioms must be placed side by side with modern
hypotheses and comparison left to the sagacious reader.
<P>
On the question of the &quot;Seven Governors,&quot; as Hermes
calls the &quot;Seven Builders,&quot; the Spirits which guide
the operations of nature, the animated atoms of which are the
shadows, in their world, of their Primaries in the astral realms
-- this work will, of course, besides the men of Science, have
every materialist against it. But this opposition can, at most,
be only temporary. People have laughed at everything and scouted
every unpopular idea at first, and then ended by accepting it.
Materialism and scepticism are evils that must remain in the world
as long as man has not quitted his present gross form to don the
one he had during the first and second races of this Round. Unless
scepticism and our present natural ignorance are equilibrated
by intuition and a natural spirituality, every being afflicted
with such feelings will see in himself no better than a bundle
of flesh, bones, and muscles, with an empty garret inside him
which serves the purpose of storing his sensations and feelings.
Sir Humphry Davy was a great scientist, as deeply versed in physics
as any theorist of our day, yet he loathed materialism. &quot;I
heard with disgust,&quot; he says, &quot;in the dissecting-rooms,
the plan of the physiologist, of the gradual secretion of matter,
and its becoming endued with irritability, ripening into sensibility,
and acquiring such organs as were necessary, by its own inherent
forces, and at last rising into intellectual existence.&quot;
Nevertheless, physiologists are not the most to be blamed for
speaking of that only which they can see and estimate on the evidence
of their physical senses. Astronomers<HR>

<P>
and physicists are, we consider, far more illogical in their materialistic
views than even physiologists, and this has to be proved. Milton's
--
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
has become with the materialists only --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . . . . Prime cheerer, light,<BR>
Of all material beings, first and best.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For the occultists it is both Spirit and Matter. Behind the &quot;mode
of motion,&quot; now regarded as &quot;the property of matter&quot;
and nothing more, they perceive the radiant noumenon. It is the
&quot;Spirit of Light,&quot; the first born of the Eternal pure
Element, whose energy (or emanation) is stored in the Sun, the
great Life-Giver of the physical world, as the hidden Concealed
Spiritual Sun is the Light- and Life-Giver of the Spiritual and
Psychic Realms. Bacon was one of the first to strike the key-note
of materialism, not only by his inductive method (renovated from
ill-digested Aristotle), but by the general tenor of his writings.
He inverts the order of mental Evolution when saying that &quot;the
first Creation of God was the light of the sense; the last was
the light of the reason; and his Sabbath work ever since is the
illumination of the Spirit.&quot; It is just the reverse. The
light of Spirit is the eternal Sabbath of the mystic or occultist,
and he pays little attention to that of mere sense. That which
is meant by the allegorical sentence, &quot;<EM>Fiat Lux</EM>&quot;
is,-- when esoterically rendered -- &quot;Let there be the 'Sons
of Light,' &quot; or the noumena of all phenomena. Thus the Roman
Catholics rightly interpret the passage as referring to Angels,
and wrongly as meaning Powers created by an anthropomorphic God,
whom they personify in the ever thundering and punishing Jehovah.
<P>
These beings are the &quot;Sons of Light,&quot; because they emanate
from, and are self-generated in, that infinite Ocean of Light,
whose one pole is pure <EM>Spirit </EM>lost in the absoluteness
of Non-Being, and the other, the <EM>matter </EM>in which it condenses,
crystallizing into a more and more gross type as it descends into
manifestation. Therefore matter, though it is, in one sense, but
the illusive dregs of that Light whose limbs are the Creative
Forces, yet has in it the full presence of the Soul thereof, of
that Principle, which none -- not even the &quot;Sons of Light,&quot;
evolved from its ABSOLUTE DARKNESS -- will ever know. The idea
is as beautifully, as it is truthfully, expressed by Milton, who
hails the holy Light, which is the --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;. . . . . Offspring of Heaven, first-born,<BR>
And of th' Eternal co-eternal beam;<BR>
. . . . . Since God is light,<BR>
And never but in unapproached Light<BR>
Dwelt from Eternity,. dwelt then in thee<BR>
Bright effluence, of bright essence increate.&quot;
