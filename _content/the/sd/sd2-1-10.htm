* This verse in the Veda (<EM>X.</EM> 5-6), &quot;The seven wise
ones (rays of wisdom, Dhyanis) fashion seven paths (or lines as
also <EM>Races </EM>in another sense). To one of these may the
distressed mortal come&quot; -- which is interpreted solely from
the astronomical and cosmic aspect -- is one of the most pregnant
in occult meaning. The &quot;paths&quot; may mean lines (<EM>maryadah</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>but they are primarily beams of light falling on the paths
leading to wisdom. (See <EM>Rig Veda </EM><STRONG>IV</STRONG>.
5-13.) It means &quot;ways&quot; or paths. They are, in short,
the seven Rays which fall free from the macrocosmic centre, the
seven principles in the metaphysical, the seven Races in the physical
sense. All depends upon the key used.

<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) The &quot;Fall&quot; occurred, according to the testimony
of ancient Wisdom and the old records, as soon as Daksha (the
reincarnated Creator of men and things in the early Third Race)
disappeared to make room for that portion of mankind which had
&quot;separated.&quot; This is how the Commentary explains the
details that preceded the &quot;Fall&quot;: --
<P>
&quot;<EM>In the initial period of man</EM>'<EM>s Fourth evolution,
the human kingdom branched off in several and various directions.
The outward shape of its first specimens was not uniform, for
the vehicles </EM>(the egg-like, external shells, in which the
future fully physical man gestated) <EM>were often tampered with,
before they hardened, by huge animals, of species now unknown,
and which belonged to the tentative efforts of Nature. The result
was that intermediate races of monsters, half animals, half men,
were produced. But as they were failures, they were not allowed
to breathe long and live, though the intrinsically paramount power
of psychic over physical nature being yet very weak, and hardly
established, the </EM>'<EM>Egg-Born</EM>'<EM> Sons had taken several
of their females unto themselves as mates, and bred other human
monsters. Later, animal species and human races becoming gradually
equilibrized, they separated and mated no longer. Man created
no</EM> <EM>more -- he begot. But he also begot animals, as well
as</EM> <EM>men in</EM> <EM>days of old. Therefore the Sages </EM>(<EM>or
wise men</EM>)<EM>, who speak of males who had no more</EM> <EM>will-begotten
offspring, but begat various animals along with Danavas</EM> (giants)
<EM>on females of other species -- animals being as </EM>(<EM>or
in a manner of</EM>)<EM> Sons putative to them</EM>;<EM> and they
</EM>(the human males) <EM>refusing in time to be regarded as
</EM>(putative) <EM>fathers of dumb creatures </EM>-- <EM>spoke
truthfully and wisely. Upon seeing this </EM>(state of things),
<EM>the kings and Lords of the Last Races </EM>(of the Third and
the Fourth) <EM>placed the seal of prohibition upon the sinful
intercourse. It interfered with Karma</EM>, <EM>it developed new
</EM>(Karma)<EM>.</EM>*<EM> They </EM>(the divine Kings) <EM>struck
the culprits with sterility. They destroyed the Red and Blue Races.</EM>**<EM>
</EM>
<P>
In another we find: --
<P>
&quot;<EM>There were blue and red-faced animal-men even in later
times</EM>;<EM> not from actual intercourse </EM>(between the
human and animal species), <EM>but by descent.</EM>&quot;
<P>
And still another passage mentions: --
<P>
&quot;<EM>Red-haired, swarthy men going on all-fours, who bend
and unbend </EM>(stand erect and fall on their hands again) <EM>who
speak as their forefathers, and run on their hands as their giant
fore-mothers.</EM>&quot;

<P>
<EM>Homo primigenius, </EM>but some of the lower tribes, such
as some tribes of the Australian savages. Nevertheless, even these
are not descended from the anthropoid apes, but from human fathers
and semi-human mothers, or, to speak more correctly, from human
monsters -- those &quot;failures&quot; mentioned in the first
Commentary. The real anthropoids, Haeckel's <EM>Catarrhini </EM>and
<EM>Platyrrhini, </EM>came far later, in the closing times of
Atlantis. The orang-outang, the gorilla, the chimpanzee and cynocephalus
are the latest and purely physical evolutions from lower anthropoid
mammalians. They have a spark of the purely human essence in them;
man on the other hand, has not one drop of pithecoid* blood in
his veins. Thus saith old Wisdom and universal tradition.
<P>
How was the separation of sexes effected? it is asked. Are we
to believe in the old Jewish fable of the rib of Adam yielding
Eve? Even such belief is more logical and reasonable than the
descent of man from the Quadrumana without any reservation; as
the former hides an esoteric truth under a fabulous version, while
the latter conceals no deeper fact than a desire to force upon
mankind a materialistic fiction. The rib is bone, and when we
read in Genesis that Eve was made out of the rib, it only means
that the <EM>Race with bones </EM>was produced out of a previous
Race and Races, which were &quot;boneless.&quot; This is an esoteric
tenet spread far and wide, as it is almost universal under its
various forms. A Tahitian tradition states that man was created
out of <EM>Araea, </EM>&quot;red
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* This, regardless of modern materialistic evolution, which speculates
in this wise: &quot;The primitive human form, whence as we think
all human species sprang, has perished this long time.&quot; (This
we deny; it has only decreased in size and changed in texture.)
&quot;But many facts point to the conclusion that it was hairy
and dolichocephalic.&quot; (African races are even <EM>now</EM>
dolichocephalic in a great measure, but the palaeolithic Neanderthal
skull, the oldest we know of, is of a large size, and no nearer
to the capacity of the gorilla's cranium than that of any other
now-living man). &quot;Let us, for the time being, call this hypothetical
species <EM>Homo primigenius</EM>. . . . This first species, or
the Ape-man, the ancestor of all the others, PROBABLY arose in
the <EM>tropical regions </EM>of the old world from ANTHROPOID
APES.&quot; Asked for proofs, the evolutionist, not the least
daunted, replies: &quot;Of these NO FOSSIL REMAINS ARE AS YET
KNOWN TO US, BUT THEY WERE <EM>probably </EM>AKIN TO THE <STRONG>G</STRONG>ORILLA
AND <STRONG>O</STRONG>RANG OF THE PRESENT DAY.&quot; And then
the Papuan negro is mentioned as the probable descendant in the
first line (<EM>Pedigree of Man, p</EM>. 80).
<P>
Haeckel holds fast to Lemuria, which with East Africa and South
Asia also, he mentions as the possible cradle of the primitive
Ape-men; and so do many geologists. Mr. A. R. Wallace admits its
reality, though in a rather modified sense, in his &quot;<EM>Geographical
Distribution of Animals.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>But let not Evolutionists
speak so lightly of the comparative size of the brains of man
and the ape, for this is very <EM>unscientific, </EM>especially
when they pretend to see no difference between the two, or very
little at any rate. For Vogt himself showed that, while the highest
of the Apes, the gorilla, has a brain of only 30 to 51 cubic inches,
the brain of the lowest of the Australian aborigines amounts to
99.35 cubic inches. The former is thus &quot;not half of the size
of the brain of a new-born babe,&quot; says Pfaff.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 194 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Earth.&quot; Taaroa, the creative power, the chief god, &quot;put
man to sleep for long years, for several lives,&quot; which means
racial periods, and is a reference to his <EM>mental sleep, </EM>as
shown elsewhere. During that time the deity pulled an<EM> Ivi</EM>
(bone) out of man and she became a woman.*
<P>
Nevertheless, whatever the allegory may mean, even its exoteric
meaning necessitates a <EM>divine </EM>Builder of man -- &quot;a
Progenitor.&quot; Do we then believe in such &quot;supernatural&quot;
beings? We say, No. Occultism has never believed in anything,
whether animate or inanimate, <EM>outside </EM>nature. Nor are
we Cosmolators or Polytheists for believing in &quot;Heavenly
Man&quot; and divine men, for we have the accumulated testimony
of the ages, with its unvarying evidence on every essential point,
to support us in this; the Wisdom of the Ancients and UNIVERSAL
tradition. We reject, however, every groundless and baseless tradition,
which, having outgrown strict allegory and symbolism, has found
acceptance in exoteric creeds. But that which is preserved in<EM>
unanimous </EM>traditions, only the wilfully blind could reject.
Hence we believe in races of beings other than our own in far
remote geological periods; in races of ethereal, following <EM>incorporeal,
</EM>&quot;<EM>Arupa,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>men, with form but no
solid substance, giants who preceded us pigmies; in dynasties
of divine beings, those Kings and Instructors of the Third Race
in arts and sciences, compared with which our little modern science
stands less chance than elementary arithmetic with geometry.
<P>
No, certainly not. We do not believe in the <EM>supernatural </EM>but
only in <EM>the superhuman, </EM>or rather <EM>interhuman, </EM>intelligences.
One may easily appreciate the feeling of reluctance that an educated
person would have to being classed with the superstitious and
ignorant; and even realize the great truth uttered by Renan when
he says that: &quot;The supernatural has become like the original
sin, a blemish that every one seems ashamed of -- even those most
religious persons who refuse in our day to accept even a <EM>minimum
</EM>of Bible miracles in all their crudeness, and who, seeking
to reduce them to the <EM>minimum, </EM>hide and conceal it in
the furthermost corners of the past.&quot;**
<P>
But the &quot;supernatural&quot; of Renan belongs to dogma and
its dead letter. It has nought to do with its Spirit nor with
the reality of facts in Nature. If theology asks us to believe
that four or five thousand years ago men lived 900 years and more,
that a portion of mankind, the enemies of the people of Israel
exclusively, was composed of giants

<P>
and monsters, we decline to believe that such a thing existed
in Nature <EM>5,000 years back. </EM>For Nature never proceeds
by jumps and starts, and logic and common sense, besides geology,
anthropology and ethnology, have justly rebelled against such
assertions. But if that same theology, giving up her fantastic
chronology, had claimed that men lived 969 years -- the age of
Methuselah -- five million years ago, we would have nothing to
say against the claim. For in those days the physical frame of
men was, compared to the present human body, as that of a megalosaurus
to a common lizard.
<P>
A naturalist suggests another difficulty. The human is the only
species which, however unequal in its races, can breed together.
&quot;There is no question of selection between <EM>human races,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>say the anti-Darwinists, and no evolutionist can deny the
argument -- one which very triumphantly proves <EM>specific unity.
</EM>How then can Occultism insist that a portion of the Fourth
Race humanity begot young ones from females of another, only <EM>semi-human,
</EM>if not quite an animal, race, the hybrids resulting from
which union not only bred freely but produced the ancestors of
the modern anthropoid apes? Esoteric science replies to this that
it was in the very beginnings of physical man. Since then, Nature
has changed her ways, and sterility is the only result of the
crime of man's bestiality. But we have to this day proofs of this.
The Secret Doctrine teaches that the <EM>specific unity of mankind
</EM>is not without exceptions even now. For there are, or rather
still were a few years ago, descendants of these half-animal tribes
or races, both of remote Lemurian and Lemuro-Atlantean origin.
The world knows them as Tasmanians (now extinct), Australians,
Andaman Islanders, etc. The descent of the Tasmanians can be almost
proved by a fact, which struck Darwin a good deal, without his
being able to make anything of it. This fact deserves notice.
<P>
Now de Quatrefages and other naturalists, who seek to prove Monogenesis
by the very fact of every race of mankind being capable of crossing
with every other, have left out of their calculations <EM>exceptions</EM>,
which do not in this case confirm the rule. Human crossing may
have been a general rule from the time of the separation of sexes,
and yet that other law may assert itself, viz., sterility between
two human races, just as between two animal species of various
kinds, in those rare cases when a European, condescending to see
in a female of a savage tribe a mate, happens to chose a member
of such mixed tribes.* Darwin notes such
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Of such semi-animal creatures, the sole remnants known to Ethnology
were the Tasmanians, a <EM>portion </EM>of the Australians and
a mountain tribe in China, the men and women of which are entirely
covered with hair. They were the last descendants in a <EM>direct
</EM>line of the semi-animal latter-day Lemurians referred to.
There are, however, considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean
peoples produced by various [[Footnote continued on next page]]
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 196 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
a case in a Tasmanian tribe, whose women were suddenly struck
with sterility, <EM>en masse, </EM>some time after the arrival
among them of the European colonists. The great naturalist tried
to explain this fact by change of diet, food, conditions, etc.,
but finally gave up the solution of the mystery. For the Occultist
it is a very evident one. &quot;Crossing,&quot; as it is called,
of Europeans with Tasmanian women -- <EM>i.e</EM>., the representatives
of a race, whose progenitors were a &quot;soulless&quot;* and
mindless monster and a real human, though still as mindless a
man -- brought on sterility. This, not alone as a consequence
of a physiological law, but also as a decree of <EM>Karmic </EM>evolution
in the question of further survival of the abnormal race. In no
one point of the above is Science prepared to believe <EM>as yet
</EM>-- but it will have to in the long run. Esoteric philosophy,
let us remember, only fills the gaps made by science and corrects
her false premises.
<P>
Yet, in this particular, geology and even botany and zoology support
the esoteric teachings. It has been suggested by many geologists
that the Australian native -- co-existing as he does with an <EM>archaic
fauna and flora -</EM>- must date back to an enormous antiquity.
The whole environment of this mysterious race, about whose origin
ethnology is silent, is a testimony to the truth of the esoteric
position.
<H6>&quot;It is a very curious fact,&quot; says Jukes,** &quot;that
not only these marsupial animals (the mammals found in the Oxfordshire
stone-field slates), but several of the shells -- as for instance,
the <EM>Trigonias </EM>and even some of the plants found fossil
in the Oolitic rocks -- much more nearly resemble those now living
in Australia than the living forms of any other part of the globe.
This might be explained on the supposition that, since the 0olitic
(Jurassic) period, <EM>less change has taken place in Australia
than elsewhere, </EM>and that the Australian flora and fauna consequently
retain. Some-</H6>

semi-human stocks -- <EM>e.g.</EM>, the wild men of Borneo, the
Veddhas of Ceylon, classed by Prof. Flower among Aryans (!), most
of the remaining Australians, Bushmen, Negritos, Andaman Islanders,
etc.
<P>
The Australians of the Gulf of St. Vincent and the neighbourhood
of Adelaide are <EM>very hairy, </EM>and the brown down on the
skin of boys of five or six years of age assumes a <EM>furry appearance.
</EM>They are, however, degraded <EM>men</EM> -- not the closest
approximation to the<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>pithecoid </EM>man,&quot;
as Haeckel so sweepingly affirms. Only a portion of these men
are a Lemurian relic. (Cf. &quot;<EM>Esoteric Buddhism,</EM>&quot;

<P>
* In calling the animal &quot;Soulless,&quot; it is not depriving
the beast, from the humblest to the highest species, of a &quot;soul,&quot;
but only of a conscious surviving <EM>Ego-soul, i.e., </EM>that
principle which survives after a man, and reincarnates in a like
man. The animal has an astral body, that survives the physical
form for a short period; but its (animal) Monad does not re-incarnate
in the same, but in a higher species, and has no &quot;Devachan&quot;
of course. It has the <EM>seeds </EM>of all the human principles
in itself, but they are <EM>latent.</EM>

thing of the Oolitic type, <EM>while it had been altogether supplanted
and replaced on the rest of the Globe.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(!
!)
<P>
Now why has less change taken place in Australia than elsewhere?
Where is the <EM>raison d</EM>'<EM>etre </EM>for such a &quot;curse
of retardation&quot;? It is simply because the nature of the environment
develops <EM>pari passu </EM>with the race concerned. Correspondences
rule in every quarter. The survivors of those later Lemurians,
who escaped the destruction of their fellows when the main continent
was submerged, became the ancestors of a portion of the present
native tribes. Being a very low sub-race, begotten originally
of animals, of monsters, whose very fossils are now resting miles
under the sea floors, their stock has since existed in an environment
strongly subjected to the <EM>law of retardation. </EM>Australia
is one of the oldest lands now above the waters, and in the senile
decrepitude of old age, its &quot;<EM>virgin </EM>soil&quot; notwithstanding.
It can produce no new forms, unless helped by new and fresh races,
and artificial cultivation and breeding.
<P>
To return, however, once more to the history of the Third Race,
the &quot;Sweat-Born,&quot; the &quot;Egg-bearing,&quot; and the
&quot;Androgyne.&quot; Almost sexless, in its early beginnings,
it became bisexual or androgynous; very gradually of course. The
passage from the former to the latter transformation required
numberless generations, during which the simple cell that issued
from the earliest parent (the two in one), first developed into
a bisexual being; and then the cell, becoming a regular egg, gave
forth a unisexual creature. The Third-Race-mankind is the most
mysterious of all the hitherto developed five Races. The mystery
of the &quot;How&quot; of the generation of the distinct sexes
must, of course, be very obscure here, as it is the business of
an embryologist and a specialist, the present work giving only
faint outlines of the process. But it is evident that the units
of the Third Race humanity began to separate in their pre-natal
shells, or eggs,* and to issue out of them as distinct male and
female babes, ages after the appearance of its early progenitors.
And, as time rolled on its geological periods, the newly born
sub-races began to lose their natal capacities. Toward the end
of the fourth <EM>sub-race, </EM>the babe lost its faculty of
walking as soon as liberated from its shell, and by the end of
the fifth, mankind was born under the same conditions and by the
same identical process as our historical generations. This required,
of course, millions of years. The

* The &quot;fables&quot; and &quot;myths&quot; about Leda and
Jupiter, and such like, could never have sprung up in people's
fancy, had not the allegory rested on a fact in nature. Evolution,
gradually transforming man into a mammal, did in his case only
what it did in that of other animals. But this does not prevent
man from having always stood at the head of the animal world and
other organic species, and from having preceded the former.<HR>

The Commentaries explain that the first Race -- the ethereal or
astral Sons of Yoga, also called &quot;Self-born&quot; -- was,
in our sense, speechless, as it was devoid of mind on our plane.
The Second Race had a &quot;Sound-language,&quot; to wit, chant-like
sounds composed of vowels alone. The Third Race developed in the
beginning a kind of language which was only a slight improvement
on the various sounds in Nature, on the cry of gigantic insects
and of the first animals, which, however, were hardly nascent
in the day of the &quot;Sweat-born&quot; (the <EM>early </EM>Third
Race). In its second half, when the &quot;Sweat-born&quot; gave
birth to the &quot;Egg-born,&quot; (the <EM>middle </EM>Third
Race); and when these, instead of &quot;hatching out&quot; (may
the reader pardon the rather ridiculous expression when applied
to human beings in our age) as androgynous beings, began to evolve
into separate males and females; and when the same law of evolution
led them to reproduce their kind sexually, an act which forced
the creative gods, compelled by Karmic law, to incarnate in <EM>mindless
</EM>men; then only was speech developed. But even then it was
still no better than a tentative effort. The whole human race
was at that time of &quot;one language and of one lip.&quot; This
did not prevent the last two Sub-Races of the Third Race* from
building cities, and sowing far and wide the first seeds of civilization
under the guidance of their divine instructors,** and their own
already awakened minds. Let the reader also bear in mind that,
as each of the seven races is divided into four ages -- the Golden,
Silver, Bronze, and Iron Age -- so is every smallest division
of such races.*** Speech then developed, according to occult teaching,
in the following order: --
<P>
I. Monosyllabic speech; that of the first approximately fully
developed human beings at the close of the Third Root-race, the
&quot;golden-coloured,&quot; yellow-complexioned men, after their
separation into sexes, and the full

awakening of their minds. Before that, they communicated through
what would now be called &quot;thought-transference,&quot; though,
with the exception of the Race called the &quot;Sons of Will and
Yoga&quot; -- the first in whom the &quot;Sons of Wisdom&quot;
had incarnated -- thought was but very little developed in nascent
physical man, and never soared above a low terrestrial level.
Their physical bodies belonging to the Earth, their Monads remained
on a higher plane altogether. Language could not be well developed
before the full acquisition and development of their reasoning
faculties. This monosyllabic speech was the vowel parent, so to
speak, of the monosyllabic languages mixed with hard consonants,
still in use amongst the yellow races which are known to the anthropologist.*
<P>
<STRONG>II</STRONG>. These linguistic characteristics developed
into the agglutinative languages. The latter were spoken by some
Atlantean races, while other parent stocks of the Fourth Race
preserved the mother-language. And as languages have their cyclic
evolution, their childhood, purity, growth, <EM>fall into matter,
</EM>admixture with other languages, maturity, decay and finally
death,** so the primitive speech of the most civilized Atlantean
races -- that language, which is referred to as &quot;Rakshasi
Bhasa,&quot; in old Sanskrit works -- decayed and almost died
out. While the &quot;cream&quot; of the Fourth Race gravitated
more and more toward the apex of physical and intellectual evolution,
thus leaving as an heirloom to the nascent Fifth (the Aryan) Race
the inflectional, highly developed languages, the agglutinative
decayed and remained as a fragmentary fossil idiom, scattered
now, and nearly limited to the aboriginal tribes of America.

<P>
* The present yellow races are the descendants, however, of the
early branches of the Fourth Race. Of the third, the only <EM>pure
and direct </EM>descendants are, as said above, a portion of the
fallen and degenerated Australians, whose far distant ancestors
belonged to a division of the seventh Sub-race of the Third. The
rest are of mixed Lemuro-Atlantean descent. They have since then
entirely changed in stature and intellectual capacities.
<P>
**<EM> Language </EM>is certainly coeval with reason, and could
never have been developed before men became one with the informing
principles in them -- those who fructified and awoke to life the
manasic element dormant in primitive man. For, as Professor Max
Muller tells us in his &quot;<EM>Science of Thought,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>&quot;Thought and language are identical.&quot; Yet to add
to this the reflection that <EM>thoughts which are</EM> <EM>too
deep for words, do not really exist at all, </EM>is rather risky,
as thought impressed upon the astral tablets exists in eternity
whether expressed or not. Logos is both reason and speech. But
language, proceeding in cycles, is not always adequate to express
<EM>spiritual </EM>thoughts. Moreover, in one sense, the Greek
Logos is the equivalent of the Sanscrit Vach, &quot;the immortal
(intellectual) ray of spirit.&quot; And the fact that Vach (as
Devasena, an <EM>aspect </EM>of Saraswati, the goddess of hidden
Wisdom) is the spouse of the eternal celibate Kumara, unveils
a suggestive, though veiled, reference to the <EM>Kumaras, </EM>those
&quot;who refused to create,&quot; but who were compelled later
on to complete <EM>divine</EM> Man by incarnating in him. All
this will be fully explained in the sections that follow.<HR>

<P>
<STRONG>III</STRONG>. The inflectional speech -- the root of the
Sanskrit, very erroneously called &quot;the elder sister&quot;
of the Greek, instead of its mother -- was the first language
(now the mystery tongue of the Initiates, of the Fifth Race).
At any rate, the &quot;Semitic&quot; languages are the bastard
descendants of the first phonetic corruptions of the eldest children
of the early Sanskrit. The occult doctrine admits of no such divisions
as the Aryan and the Semite, accepting even the Turanian with
ample reservations. The Semites, especially the Arabs, are later
Aryans -- degenerate in spirituality and perfected in materiality.
To these belong all the Jews and the Arabs. The former are a tribe
descended from the Tchandalas of India, the outcasts, many of
them ex-Brahmins, who sought refuge in Chaldea, in Scinde, and
Aria (Iran), and were truly born from their father A-bram (No
Brahmin) some 8,000 years <STRONG>B.C.</STRONG> The latter, the
Arabs, are the descendants of those Aryans who would not go into
India at the time of the dispersion of nations, some of whom remained
on the borderlands thereof, in Afghanistan and Kabul,* and along
the Oxus, while others penetrated into and invaded Arabia.
<P>
But this was when Africa had already been raised as a continent.
We have meanwhile to follow, as closely as limited space will
permit, the gradual evolution of the now truly human species.
It is in the suddenly arrested evolution of certain sub-races,
and their forced and violent diversion into the purely animal
line by artificial cross-breeding, truly analogous to the hybridization,
which we have now learned to utilize in the vegetable and animal
kingdoms, that we have to look for the origin of the anthropoids.

<P>
* Ptolemy, speaking in his ninth table of the <EM>Kabolitae </EM>(Kabul
tribes), calls them [[<EM>Aristophuloi]], </EM>the aristocratic
or <EM>noble tribes. </EM>The Afghans call themselves <EM>Ben-Issrael
</EM>(children of Is(<EM>sa</EM>)rael), from <EM>Issa, </EM>&quot;woman
and also earth,&quot; Sons of Mother Earth. But if you call an
Afghan <EM>Yahoudi</EM> (<EM>Jew</EM>),<EM> </EM>he will kill
you. The subject is fully treated elsewhere. The names of the
supposed twelve tribes and the names of the real tribes, the same
in number, of the Afghans, are the same. The Afghans being far
older (at any rate, their Arabic stock) than the Israelites, no
one need be surprised to find such tribal names among them as
<EM>Youssoufzic, </EM>&quot;Sons of Joseph&quot; in Punjcaure
and Boonere; the <EM>Zablistanee </EM>(Zebulon); Ben-manasseh
(sons of Manasseh) among the Khojar Tartars; Isaguri, or Issachar
(now Ashnagor in Afghanistan), etc., etc. The whole twelve names
of the so-called twelve tribes are names of the signs of the Zodiac,
as is now well proven. At any rate, the names of the oldest Arabic
tribes, re-transliterated, yield the names of the zodiacal signs
and of the mythical sons of Jacob likewise. Where are the traces
of the Jewish twelve tribes? Nowhere. But there is a trace, and
a good one, that the Jews have tried to deceive people with the
help of those names. For, see what happens <EM>ages after the
ten tribes </EM>had wholly disappeared from Babylon. Ptolemy Philadelphus,
desiring to have the Hebrew Law translated for him into Greek
(the famous <EM>Septuagint</EM>),<EM> </EM>wrote to the high priest
of the Jews, Eleazar, to <EM>send him six men from each of the
twelve tribes</EM>;<EM> </EM>and the <EM>seventy-two representatives
</EM>(of whom sixty were ghosts apparently) came to the king in
Egypt and translated the law amid miracles and wonders. See Butler's
&quot;<EM>Horae Biblicae,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Josephus, and Philo
Judaeus. <HR>

<P>
In these red-haired and hair-covered monsters, the fruit of the
unnatural connection between men and animals, the &quot;Lords
of Wisdom&quot; did not incarnate, as we see. Thus by a long series
of transformations due to unnatural cross-breeding (unnatural
&quot;sexual selection&quot;), originated in due course of time
the lowest specimens of humanity; while further bestiality and
the fruit of their first animal efforts of reproduction begat
a species which developed into mammalian apes ages later.*
<P>
As to the separation of sexes, it did not occur suddenly, as one
may think. Nature proceeds slowly in whatever she does.

<P>
This relates evidently to the so-called age of the amphibious
reptiles, during which ages science maintains that <EM>no man
existed! </EM>But what could the ancients know of antediluvian
prehistoric animals and monsters! Nevertheless, in Book <STRONG>VI</STRONG>.
of the Commentaries is found a passage which says, freely translated:
--
<P>
&quot;<EM>When the Third separated and fell into sin by breeding
men-animals, these </EM>(the animals) <EM>became ferocious, and
men and they mutually destructive. Till then, there was no sin,
no life taken. After </EM>(the separation) <EM>the Satya </EM>(Yuga)
<EM>was at an end. The eternal spring became constant change and
seasons succeeded. Cold forced men to build shelters and devise
clothing. Then man appealed to the superior Fathers </EM>(the
higher gods or angels). <EM>The Nirmanakaya of the Nagas, the
wise Serpents and Dragons of Light came, and the precursors of
the Enlightened </EM>(Buddhas). <EM>Divine Kings descended and
taught men sciences and arts, for man could live no longer in
the first land </EM>(Adi-Varsha, the Eden of the first Races),
<EM>which had turned into a white frozen corpse.</EM>&quot;
<P>
The above is suggestive. We will see what can be inferred from
this brief statement. Some may incline to think that there is
more in it than is apparent at first sight.

* The Commentary explains that the apes are the only species,
among the animals, which has gradually and with every generation
and variety tended more and more to return to the original type
of its male forefather -- the dark gigantic Lemurian and Atlantean.
