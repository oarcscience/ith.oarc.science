SCIENTIFIC AND GEOLOGICAL PROOFS OF THE<BR>
EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL SUBMERGED CONTINENTS.</H3>

<P>
<B>I</B>T may not be amiss -- for the benefit of those who resolve
the tradition of a lost Miocene Atlantis into an &quot;antiquated
myth,&quot; to append a few scientific admissions on this point.
Science, it is true, is largely indifferent to such questions.
But there are Scientists ready to admit that, in any case, a cautious
agnosticism as to geological problems concerning the remote past
is far more philosophical than <I>a priori </I>denial, or even
hasty generalizations on insufficient data.
<P>
Meanwhile two very interesting instances, that have been lately
met with, may be pointed out as &quot;confirming&quot; certain
passages in the letter of a Master, published in &quot;Esoteric
Buddhism.&quot; The eminence of the authorities will not be questioned:

&quot;The sinking of the Atlantis (the group of continents and
islands) began during the Eocene period . . . . and it culminated
in the Miocene, first in the <I>final disappearance of the largest,
an event coincident with the elevation of the Alps, </I>and second
in the sinking of the last of the fair islands mentioned by Plato.&quot;

&quot;Was there, as some have believed, an Atlantis -- a continent
or Archipelago of large islands occupying the area of the North
Atlantic? There is, perhaps, nothing unphilosophical in the hypothesis.
For since, as geologists state, '<I>The Alps have acquired 4,000
and even in some places more than 10,000 feet of their present
altitude since the commencement of the Eocene epoch</I>'<I> </I>(Lyell's

* Having already given several instances of the vagaries of Science,
it is delightful to find such <I>agreement </I>in this particular
case. Read in connection with the scientific admission (cited
elsewhere) of the geologists' ignorance of even the approximate
duration of periods, the following passage is highly instructive:
&quot;We are not yet able to assign an <I>approximate </I>date
for the most recent epoch at which our Northern Hemisphere was
covered with glaciers. According to Mr. Wallace, this epoch may
have occurred <I>seventy thousand years </I>ago, while others
would assign to it an antiquity of at least <I>two hundred thousand
</I>years, and there are yet others who urge strong arguments
on behalf of the opinion that a <I>million of years </I>is barely
enough to have produced the changes which have taken place since
that event.&quot; (Fiske, &quot;<I>Cosmic</I> [[Footnote continued

&quot;Lemuria cannot any more be confounded with the Atlantis
continent than Europe with America. Both sank and were drowned
with all their 'gods'; yet, between the two catastrophes a short
period of about some 700,000 years elapsed; Lemuria flourishing
and ending her career just about that trifling lapse of time before
the early <I>Eocene </I>Age, since its Race was the Third. Behold

&quot;It would be premature to say, because no evidence has yet
been adduced, <I>that men may not have existed in the Eocene Age,
</I>especially as it can be shown that <I>a race of men, the lowest
we know of, co-exists with that remnant of the Eocene flora which
still survives on the continent and islands of Australia.</I>&quot;<I>

Haeckel, who fully accepts the reality of a former Lemuria, also
regards the <I>Australians as direct descendants of the Lemurians.
</I>&quot;Persistent forms (of both his Lemurian stems,) are in
all probability still surviving . . . Papuans and Hottentots .

<P>
[[End of Columns]]
<P>
With regard to a former civilization, of which a <I>portion </I>of
these degraded Australians are the last surviving offshoot, the
opinion of Gerland is strongly suggestive. Commenting upon the
religion and mythology of the tribes, he writes, &quot;The statement
that the Australian civilization (?) indicates a <I>higher grade,
</I>is nowhere more clearly proved than here, where <I>everything
resounds like the expiring voices of a previous and richer age.
</I>The idea that the Australians have no religion or mythology
is thoroughly false. But this religion is certainly <I>quite deteriorated.</I>&quot;<I>
</I>(Cited in Schmidt's &quot;<I>Doctrine of Descent of Darwinism,</I>&quot;<I>
</I>pp.<I> </I>301-2.) As to his other statement, namely, that
the Australians are a &quot;division of the Malays&quot; (<I>Vide
</I>his ethnological theories in the &quot;<I>Pedigree of Man</I>&quot;)<I>,
</I>Haeckel is in error, if he classes the Australians with the
rest. The Malays and Papuans are a <I>mixed </I>stock, resulting
from the intermarriages of the low Atlantean sub-races with the
Seventh sub-race of the Third Root-Race. Like the Hottentots,
they are of indirect <I>Lemuro-Atlantean </I>descent. It is a
most suggestive fact -- to those concrete thinkers who demand
a <I>physical </I>proof of Karma -- that the lowest races of men
are now rapidly dying out; a phenomenon largely due to an extraordinary
sterility setting in among the women, from the time that they
were first approached by the Europeans. A process of decimation
is taking

</I>estimate 100,000 years. Clearly, then, if modern Science is
unable to estimate the date of so comparatively recent an era
as the Glacial Epoch, it can hardly impeach the Esoteric Chronology
of Race-Periods and Geological Ages.<HR>

place all over the globe, among those races, whose &quot;time
is up&quot; -- among just those stocks, be it remarked, which
esoteric philosophy regards as the senile representatives of lost
archaic nations. It is inaccurate to maintain that the extinction
of a lower race is <I>invariably </I>due to cruelties or abuses
perpetrated by colonists. Change of diet, drunkenness, etc., etc.,
have done much; but those who rely on such data as offering an
all-sufficient explanation of the crux, cannot meet the phalanx
of facts now so closely arrayed. &quot;Nothing,&quot; says even
the materialist Lefevre, &quot;can save <I>those that have run
their course</I>. . . . It would be necessary to extend their
<I>destined cycle</I>. . . . <I>The peoples that have been most
spared </I>. . . <I>Hawaiians or Maories, have been no less decimated
than the tribes massacred or tainted by European intrusion.</I>&quot;<I>
</I>(&quot;<I>Philosophy,</I>&quot;<I> </I>p. 508.)
<P>
True; but is not the phenomenon here confirmed of the operation
of <B>C</B>YCLIC <B>L</B>AW difficult to account for on materialist
lines? Whence the &quot;destined cycle&quot; and the order here
testified to? Why does this (Karmic) sterility attack and root
out certain races at their &quot;appointed hour&quot;? The answer
that it is due to a &quot;mental disproportion&quot; between the
colonizing and aboriginal races is obviously evasive, since it
does not explain the sudden &quot;<I>checks to fertility</I>&quot;<I>
</I>which so frequently supervene. The dying out of the Hawaiians,
for instance, is one of the most mysterious problems of the day.
Ethnology will sooner or later have to recognize with Occultists
that the true solution has to be sought for in a comprehension
of the workings of Karma. As Lefevre remarks, &quot;the time is
drawing near when there will remain nothing but three great human
types&quot; (before the Sixth Root-Race dawns), the white (Aryan,
Fifth Root-Race), the yellow, and the African negro -- with their
crossings (Atlanto-European divisions). Redskins, Eskimos, Papuans,
Australians, Polynesians, etc., etc. -- all are dying out. Those
who realize that every Root-Race runs through a gamut of seven
sub-races with seven branchlets, etc., will understand the &quot;why.&quot;
The tide-wave of incarnating <B>E</B>GOS has rolled past them
to harvest experience in more developed and less senile stocks;
and their extinction is hence a Karmic necessity. Some extraordinary
and <I>unexplained </I>statistics as to Race extinction are given
in de Quatrefages' &quot;<I>Human Species,</I>&quot; p. 428 <I>et
seq. </I>No solution, except on the occult lines, is able to account
for these.
<P>
But we have digressed from our direct subject. Let us hear now
what Professor Huxley has to say on the subject of former Atlantic
and Pacific Continents.
<P>
He writes in &quot;<B>N</B>ATURE,&quot; Nov. 4th, 1880: &quot;There
is nothing, so far as I am aware, in the biological or geological
evidence at present accessible, to render untenable the hypothesis
that <I>an area of the mid</I>-<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 781 TRADITION AS TRUE AS HISTORY.</H6>

<P>
<I>Atlantic or Pacific sea-bed as big as Europe, </I>should have
been uplifted as high as Mont Blanc, and have subsided again,
any time since the Palaeozoic epoch, if there were any grounds
for entertaining it.&quot;
<P>
That is to say, then, that there is nothing which can militate
against <I>positive </I>evidence to the fact; nothing, therefore,
against the geological postulates of the Esoteric Philosophy.
Dr. Seemann assures us in the &quot;Popular Science Review&quot;
(Vol. V., p. 18), article &quot;<I>Australia and Europe formerly
one Continent,</I>&quot;<I>* </I>that: --
<P>
&quot;The facts which botanists have accumulated for reconstructing
these lost maps of the globe are rather comprehensive; and they
have not been backward in demonstrating the former existence of
large tracts of solid land in parts now occupied by the great
oceans. The many striking points of contact between the present
flora of the United States and Eastern Asia, induced them to assume
that, during the present order of things, there existed a continental
connection between South-Eastern Asia and Western America. The
singular correspondence of the present flora of the Southern United
States with that of the lignite flora of Europe induces them to
believe that, <I>in the Miocene period, Europe and America were
connected by a land passage, of which Iceland, Madeira, and the
other Atlantic islands are remnants</I>;<I> that, in fact, the
story of an Atlantis, which an Egyptian priest told to Solon,
is not purely fictitious, but rests on a solid historical basis</I>.
. . . Europe of the Eocene period received the plants which spread
over mountains and plains, valleys and river-banks (from Asia
generally), neither exclusively from the South nor from the East.
The west also furnished additions, and if at that period these
were rather meagre, they show, at all events, that the bridge
was already building, which, at a late period, was to facilitate
communication between the two continents in such a remarkable
manner. At that time some plants of the Western Continent began
to reach Europe by means of the <I>island of Atlantis, </I>then
probably just rising (?) above the ocean.&quot;
<P>
And in another number of the same review (Vol. I., p. 143) Mr.
Duppa Crotch, <STRONG>M.A</STRONG>., <STRONG>F.L.S</STRONG>.,
in an article entitled &quot;<I>The Norwegian Lemming and its
Migrations,</I>&quot;<I> </I>alludes to the same subject.
<P>
&quot;Is it probable that land could have existed where now the
broad Atlantic rolls? All tradition says so: old Egyptian records
speak of Atlantis, as Strabo and others have told us. The Sahara
itself is the sand of an ancient sea, and the shells which are
found upon its surface
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Undoubtedly a fact and a confirmation of the esoteric conception
of the Lemuria which originally not only embraced great areas
in the Indian and Pacific oceans, but projected round South Africa
into the North Atlantic. Its Atlantic portion subsequently became
the geological basis of the future home of the Fourth Race Atlanteans.

prove that, no longer ago than the Miocene period, a sea rolled
over what is now desert. The voyage of the 'Challenger' has proved
the existence of <I>three long ridges* in the Atlantic Ocean,**
one extending for more than three thousand miles, </I>and lateral
spurs may, by connecting these ridges, account for <I>the marvellous
similarity of the fauna of the Atlantic islands.*** </I>. . .
. The submerged continent of <B>L</B>EMURIA, in what is now the
Indian Ocean, <I>is considered to afford an explanation of many
difficulties in the distribution of organic life, </I>and, I think,
the existence of a <B>M</B>IOCENE <B>A</B>TLANTIS will be found
to have a <I>strong elucidative bearing on subjects of greater
interest </I>[Truly So!] than the migration of the lemming. At
all events, if it can be shown that land existed in former ages
where the North Atlantic now rolls, not only is a motive found
for these apparently suicidal migrations, but also a strong collateral
proof that what we call instincts are but the blind and sometimes
even prejudicial inheritance of previously acquired experiences.&quot;
<P>
(At certain periods, we learn, multitudes of these animals swim
to sea and perish. Coming, as they do, from all parts of Norway,
the powerful instinct which survives throughout ages as an inheritance
from their progenitors impels them to seek a continent, once existing
but now submerged beneath the ocean, and to court a watery grave.)
<P>
In an article containing a criticism of Mr. A. R. Wallace's &quot;Island
Life&quot; -- a work devoted largely to the question of the distribution
of animals, etc. -- Mr. Starkie Gardiner writes (&quot;Subsidence
and Elevation,&quot; Geological Magazine, June, 1881): --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;By a process of reasoning supported by a large array of
facts of different kinds, he arrives at the conclusion that the
distribution of life upon the land as we now see it, has been
accomplished without the aid of important changes in the relative
positions of continents and seas. Yet if we accept his views,
we must believe that Asia and Africa, Madagascar and Africa, New
Zealand and Australia, Europe and America, have been united at
some period not remote geologically, and that seas to the depth
of 1,000 fathoms have been bridged over; but we must treat as
utterly gratuitous and entirely opposed to

all the evidences at our command (!!), the supposition that temperate
Europe and temperate America, Australia, and South America, have
ever been connected except by way of the Arctic or Antarctic circles
and that lands now separated by seas of more than 1,000 fathoms
depth have ever been united. Mr. Wallace, it must be admitted,
has succeeded in explaining the chief features of existing life-distribution,
without bridging the Atlantic or Pacific, except towards the Poles,
yet I cannot help thinking that some of the facts <I>might perhaps
be more easily explained by admitting the former existence of
the connection between the coast of Chile and Polynesia* and Great
Britain and Florida, </I>shadowed by the submarine banks which
stretch between them. Nothing is urged that renders the more direct
connection impossible, and no <I>physical reason is advanced why
the floor of the ocean should not be upheaved from any depth.
</I>The route by which (according to the anti-Atlantean and Lemurian
hypotheses of Wallace) the <I>floras </I>of South America and
Australia are supposed to have mingled, is beset by almost insurmountable
obstacles, and the apparently sudden arrival of a number of sub-tropical
American plants in our Eocene flora, necessitates a connection
more to the south than the present 1,000 fathom line . . . . forces
are unceasingly acting, and there is <I>no reason why an elevating
force once set in action in the centre of an ocean should cease
to act until a continent is formed. </I>They have acted and lifted
out from the sea, in comparatively recent geological times, the
loftiest mountains on earth. Mr. Wallace himself admits repeatedly
that sea-beds have been elevated 1,000 fathoms and islands have
risen up from the depths of 3,000 fathoms; and to suppose that
the upheaving forces are limited in power, is, it seems to me,
'utterly gratuitous and entirely opposed to all the evidences
at our command.' &quot;

<P>
The &quot;Father&quot; of English Geology -- Sir Charles Lyell
-- was an Uniformitarian in his views of continental formation.
On page 492 of his &quot;Antiquity of Man&quot; we find him saying:
--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Professor Unger (Die versunkene Insel Atlantis) and Heer
(Flora Tertiaria Helvetiae) have admitted on botanical grounds
the <I>former existence of an Atlantic Continent during some part
of the Tertiary Period</I>, as affording the only plausible explanation
that can be imagined of the analogy between the Miocene flora
of central Europe, and the existing flora of Eastern America.
Professor Oliver, on the other hand, after showing how many of
the American types found fossil in Europe are common to Japan,
inclines to the theory, first advanced by Dr. Asa Gray, that the
migration of species, to which the community of types in the Eastern
States of North America, and the Miocene flora of Europe is due,
took place when there was an overland communication from America
to central Asia between the fiftieth and sixtieth parallels of
latitude, or south of Behring Straits, following the direction
of the Aleutian islands. By this course they <I>may </I>have made
their way, at any epoch, Miocene, Pliocene, or Pleistocene, antecedently
to the Glacial Epoch, to Amoorland, on the East coast of North
Asia.&quot;

apparent to escape notice. <I>If the botanical evidences stood
alone, </I>scepticism would be half legitimate; but in this case
all branches of science converge to one point. Science has made
blunders, and has exposed itself to greater errors than the admission
of our two now invisible continents, would lay it open to. It
has denied even the undeniable, from the days of the mathematician
Laplace down to our own, and that only a few years ago.* We have
Professor Huxley's authority for saying that there is no <I>a
priori</I> improbability whatever against possible evidences supporting
the belief. (<I>Vide supra.</I>) But now that the POSITIVE EVIDENCE
<I>is brought forward, </I>will that eminent scientist admit the
corollary?
<P>
Touching on the problem in another place (&quot;<I>Principles
of Geology,</I>&quot;<I> </I>pp. 12-13), Sir Charles Lyell tells
us: &quot;Respecting the cosmogony of the Egyptian priests, we
gather much information from writers of the Grecian sects, who
borrowed almost all their tenets from Egypt, and amongst others
that of the former successive destruction and renovation of the
world. (<I>Continental, </I>not cosmic, catastrophes.) We learn
from Plutarch that this was the theme of one of the hymns of Orpheus,
so celebrated in the fabulous ages of Greece. It was brought by
him from the banks of the Nile; and we even find in his verses,
as in the Indian systems, a definite period assigned for the duration
of every successive World. The returns of great catastrophes were
determined by the present period of the Magnus Annus, or great
year -- a cycle composed of the revolutions of the sun, moon,
and planets, and terminating when these return together to the
sign whence they were supposed at some remote epoch to set out.
We learn particularly from the <I>Timaeus </I>of Plato <I>that
the Egyptians believed the world to be subject to occasional conflagrations
and deluges. </I>The sect of the Stoics adopted most fully the
system of catastrophes destined at intervals to destroy the world.
These, they taught, were of two kinds -- the cataclysm, <I>or</I>
<I>destruction by water, </I>and the <I>Ecpyrosis, or destruction
by fire </I>(submarine volcanoes). From the Egyptians they derived
the doctrine of the gradual debasement of man from a state of
innocence&quot; (nascent simplicity of the first sub-races of
each Root-Race). &quot;Towards the

* When Howard read, before the Royal Society of London, a paper
on the first serious researches that were made on the aerolites,
the Geneva naturalist Pictet, who was present, communicated, on
his return to Paris, the facts reported to the French Academy
of Sciences. But he was forthwith interrupted by Laplace, the
great astronomer, who cried: &quot;Stop! we have had enough of
such <I>fables, </I>and know all about them,&quot; thus making
Pictet feel very small. Globular-shaped lightnings or thunderbolts
have been admitted by Science only since Arago demonstrated their
existence, says de Rochat (&quot;<I>Forces non-definies,</I>&quot;<I>

termination of each era the gods could no longer bear with the
wickedness of man, and a shock of the elements, or a deluge, overwhelmed
them; (vide degeneracy into magical practices and gross animality
of the Atlanteans) after which calamity, Astraea again descended
on the earth to renew the golden age.&quot; (Dawn of a new Root-Race.)
<P>
<I>Astraea, </I>the goddess of justice, is the last of the deities
to forsake the earth, when the gods are said to abandon it and
<I>be taken up into heaven by Jupiter again. </I>But, no sooner
does Zeus carry away from earth Ganymedes (the object of <I>lust,
</I>personified) than the father of the gods throws down Astraea
back on the earth again, on which she <I>falls upon her head.
</I>Astraea is <I>Virgo, </I>the constellation of the Zodiac.
Astronomically it has a very plain significance, and one which
gives the Key to the occult meaning. But it is inseparable from
<I>Leo, </I>the sign that precedes it, and from the Pleiades and
their sisters, the Hyades, of which Aldebaran is the brilliant
leader. All of these are connected with the periodical renovations
of the earth, with regard to its continents -- even Ganymedes,
who in astronomy is Aquarius. It was already shown that while
the South Pole is the <I>pit </I>(or the infernal regions figuratively
and cosmologically), the North Pole is geographically the first
continent; while astronomically and metaphorically the celestial
pole, with its pole star in <I>heaven, </I>is Meru, or the seat
of Brahma, the throne of Jupiter, etc. For in the age when the
gods forsook the earth and were said to ascend into heaven, the
ecliptic had become parallel with the meridian, and part of the
Zodiac appeared to descend from the north pole to the north horizon.
Aldebaran was in conjunction then with the Sun, as it was 40,000
years ago, at the great festival in commemoration of that Magnus
Annus, of which Plutarch was speaking. Since that year (40,000
years ago) there has been a retrograde motion of the equator,
and about 31,000 years ago Aldebaran was in conjunction with the
vernal equinoctial point. The part assigned to <I>Taurus, </I>even
in Christian mysticism, is too well known to need repetition.
The famous Orphic hymn on the great periodical cataclysm divulges
the whole esotericism of the event. Pluto (in the pit) carries
off Eurydice, bitten by the (polar) serpent. Then Leo, the <I>lion,
</I>is vanquished. Now, when the Lion is <I>in the pit, </I>or
below the south pole, then Virgo, as the next sign, follows him,
and when her head, down to the waist, is <I>below </I>the South
horizon -- she is <I>inverted. </I>On the other hand, the Hyades
are the rain or <I>Deluge </I>constellations; and <I>Aldebaran
</I>(he who follows, or <I>succeeds </I>the daughters of Atlas,
or the Pleiades) looks down from the eye of Taurus. It is from
this point of the ecliptic that the calculations of the new cycle
were commenced. The student has to remember also, that when Ganymedes

<P>
heaven (or above the horizon of the North Pole) <I>Virgo </I>or
Astraea, who <I>is Venus-Lucifer, </I>descends head downwards
below the horizon of the South Pole, or the pit; which <I>pit</I>,
or the pole, is also the Great Dragon, or the Flood. Let the student
exercise his intuition by placing these facts together; no more
can be said.
<P>
&quot;The connection,&quot; comments Lyell, &quot;between the
doctrine of successive catastrophes and repeated deteriorations
in the moral character of the human race, is more intimate and
natural than might at first be imagined. For, in a rude state
of society, all great calamities are regarded by the people as
judgments of God on the wickedness of man. . . . In like manner
in the account given to Solon by the Egyptian priests of the submersion
of the island of Atlantis under the waters of the ocean, after
repeated shocks of an earthquake, we find that <I>the event happened
when Jupiter had seen the moral depravity of the inhabitants.</I>&quot;
<P>
True; but was it not owing to the fact that all esoteric truths
were given out to the public by the Initiates of the temples <I>under
the guise of allegories? </I>&quot;Jupiter,&quot; is merely the
personification of that immutable Cyclic Law, which arrests the
downward tendency of each Root-Race, after attaining the zenith
of its glory.* Unless we hold with Prof. John Fiske's singularly

* The Cyclic Law of Race-Evolution is most unwelcome to scientists.
It is sufficient to mention the fact of &quot;primeval civilization&quot;
to excite the frenzy of Darwinians; it being obvious that the
further culture and science is pushed back, the more precarious
becomes the basis of the ape-ancestor theory. But as Jacolliot
says: -- &quot;Whatever there may be in these traditions (submerged
continents, etc.), and whatever may have been the place where
a civilization more ancient than that of Rome, of Greece, of Egypt,
and of India, was developed, <I>it is certain that this civilization
did exist, </I>and it is highly important for Science to recover
its traces, however feeble and fugitive they be.&quot; (<I>Histoire

premises, but the Evolutionists will not listen. A <I>Miocene
</I>civilization upsets the &quot;universal stone-age&quot; theory,
and that of a <I>continuous </I>ascent of man from animalism!
And yet Egypt, at least, runs counter to current hypotheses. There
is no stone-age visible there, but a more glorious culture is
apparent, the further back we are enabled to carry our retrospect.

</I>wants of man, than even the terminology and system respectively
elaborated by Mr. Fiske's Master -- Herbert Spencer. What, however,
is Sir Charles Lyell's &quot;explanation&quot; of the &quot;myth&quot;?
Certainly, he in no way countenances the idea of its &quot;astronomical&quot;
origin, as asserted by some writers.
<P>
The two interpreters are entirely at variance with one another.
Lyell's solution is as follows. A disbeliever in cataclysmal changes,
from the absence (?) of any reliable historical data on the point,
as well as from a strong bias to the Uniformitarian conceptions
of geologic changes,* he attempts to trace the Atlantis &quot;tradition&quot;
to the following sources: --
<P>
(1) Barbarous tribes connect catastrophes with an avenging God,
who is assumed in this way to punish immoral races.
<P>
(2)<I> Hence </I>the commencement of a new race is logically a
virtuous one.
<P>
(3) The primary source of the geologic basis of the tradition
was Asia -- a continent subject to violent earthquakes. Exaggerated
accounts would thus be handed down the ages.
<P>
(4) Egypt, being herself free from earthquakes, nevertheless based
her not inconsiderable geologic knowledge on these cataclysmal
traditions.
<P>
An ingenious &quot;explanation,&quot; as all such are. But proving
a negative is proverbially a difficult task. Students of esoteric
science, who know what the resources of the Egyptian priesthood
really were, need no such laboured hypothesis. Moreover, while
an imaginative theorist is always able to furnish a reasonable
solution of problems which, in one branch of science, seem to
necessitate the hypothesis of periodical cataclysmic changes on
the surface of our planet, the impartial critic, who is not a

* Violent minor cataclysms and colossal earthquakes are recorded
in the annals of most nations -- if not of all. Elevation and
subsidence of continents is always in progress. The whole coast
of South America has been raised up 10 to 15 feet and settled
down again in an hour. Huxley has shown that the British islands
have been four times depressed beneath the ocean and subsequently
raised again and peopled. The Alps, Himalayas and Cordilleras
were all the result of depositions drifted on to sea-bottoms and
upheaved by Titanic forces to their present elevation. The Sahara
was the basin of a Miocene sea. Within the last five or six thousand
years the shores of Sweden, Denmark and Norway have risen from
200 to 600 feet; in Scotland there are raised beaches with outlying
stacks and skerries <I>surmounting </I>the shore now eroded by
the hungry wave. The North of Europe is still rising from the
sea and South America presents the phenomenon of raised beaches
of over 1,000 miles in length, now at a height varying from 100
to 1,300 feet above the sea-level. On the other hand, the coast
of Greenland is sinking fast, so much so that the Greenlander
will not build by the shore. All these phenomena are certain.

cataclysm in remote epochs? -- </I>such cataclysms occurring on

away the <I>cumulative</I> evidences, -- namely, the archaeological,
ethnological, geological, traditional, botanical, and even biological
-- in favour of former continents now submerged. When each science
is fighting for its own hand, the cumulative force of the evidence
in its collectivity is almost invariably lost sight of.
<P>
In the &quot;<I>Theosophist</I>&quot;<I> </I>(August, 1880), we
wrote: &quot;We have as evidences the most ancient traditions
of various and wide-separated peoples -- legends in India, in
ancient Greece, Madagascar, Sumatra, Java, and all the principal
isles of Polynesia, as well as the legends of both Americas. Among
savages; and in the traditions of the richest literature in the
world -- the Sanskrit literature of India -- there is an agreement
in saying, that, ages ago, <I>there existed in the Pacific Ocean,
a large Continent, which by a geological cataclysm was engulfed
by the sea,* </I>(Lemuria). And it is our firm belief . . . that
most, if not all, of the islands from the Malayan archipelago
to Polynesia, are fragments of that once immense submerged Continent.
Both Malacca and Polynesia, which lie at the two extremities of
the ocean, and which, since the memory of man never had, and never
could have any intercourse with, or even a knowledge of each other,
have yet a tradition common to all the islands and islets, that
their respective countries extended far, far into the Sea: that
there were in the world but two immense continents, one inhabited
by yellow, the other by dark men; and that the Ocean, by command
of the gods, and to punish them for their incessant quarrelling,
swallowed them up. Notwithstanding the geographical proof that
New Zealand, the Sandwich and Easter Islands, are at a distance
from each other of between 800 and 1,000 leagues, and that, according
to every testimony, neither these nor any other intermediate islands,
for instance, the Marquesan, Society, Fiji, Tahitian, Samoan,
and other islands, could, since they became islands, ignorant
as their people were of the compass, have communicated with each
other before the arrival of Europeans; yet they one and all maintain
that their respective countries extended far toward the West,
on the Asian side. Moreover, with very small differences, they
all speak dialects evidently of the same language; and understand
each other with little difficulty; have the same religious beliefs
and superstitions; and pretty much the same customs. And as few
of the Polynesian islands were discovered earlier than a century
ago, the Pacific Ocean itself being unknown to Europe till the
days of Columbus, and as these islanders have never ceased repeating
the same old traditions since the Europeans first set

&quot;A great series of animal-geographical facts,&quot; declares

Mr. A. R. Wallace, in his &quot;Malay Archipelago,&quot; arrives
at the following conclusion after a review of the mass of evidence
at hand: -- &quot;The inference that we must draw from these facts
is undoubtedly that the whole of the islands eastwards beyond
Borneo and Sumatra do essentially form part of <I>a former Australian
or Pacific Continent </I>. . . This continent must have been broken
up before the extreme south-eastern portion of Asia was raised
above the waters of the ocean, for a great part of the land of
Borneo and Java is known to be geologically of quite recent formation.&quot;
<P>
According to Haeckel: -- &quot;Southern Asia itself was not the
earliest cradle of the human race, but <I>Lemuria, a continent
that lay to the South of Asia, and sank later on beneath the surface
of the Indian Ocean.</I>&quot;<I> </I>(&quot;<I>Pedigree of Man,</I>&quot;<I>
Eng. Trans. p. </I>73.) In one sense Haeckel is right as to Lemuria
-- the &quot;cradle of the Human race.&quot; That continent <I>was</I>
the home of the first <I>physical </I>Human Stock -- the later
Third-Race Men. Previous to that epoch the Races were far less
consolidated and physiologically quite different. (Haeckel makes
Lemuria extend from <I>Sunda Island to Africa and Madagascar </I>and
eastwards <I>to Upper India.</I>)

Professor Rutimeyer, the eminent Palaeontologist, asks: -- &quot;Need
the conjecture that the almost exclusively graminivorous and insectivorous

is so widely accepted, that further pursuit of the subject is
unnecessary. With regard, however, to the former, it is found
that: --
<P>
(1) The Miocene flora of Europe have their most numerous and striking
analogues in the flora of the United States. In the forests of
Virginia and Florida are found the magnolias, tulip-trees, evergreen
oaks, plane trees, etc., etc., etc., which correspond with European
Tertiary flora term for term. How was the migration effected,
if we exclude the theory of an Atlantic Continent bridging the
ocean between America and Europe? The proposed &quot;explanation&quot;
to the effect that the transition was by way of Asia and the Aleutian
islands is a mere uncalled-for theory, obviously upset by the
fact that a large number of these flora <I>only appear </I>EAST<I>
of the Rocky Mountains. </I>This also negatives the idea of a
trans-Pacific migration. They are now superseded by European continents
and islands to the North.
<P>
(2) Skulls exhumed on the banks of the Danube and Rhine bear <I>a</I>
<I>striking similarity to those of the Caribs and Old Peruvians
</I>(Littre). Monuments have been exhumed in Central America,
which bear <I>representations of undoubted negro heads and faces.
</I>How are such facts to be accounted for except on the Atlantean
hypothesis? What is now N. W. Africa was once connected with Atlantis
by a network of islands, few of which now remain.
<P>
(3) According to Farrar (&quot;<I>Families of Speech</I>&quot;)
the<I> </I>&quot;<I>isolated</I> language&quot; of the Basques
has no affinities with the other languages* of Europe, but with
&quot;<I>the aboriginal languages of the vast opposite continent
</I>(America) <I>and those alone.</I>&quot;<I> </I>Professor Broca
is also of the same opinion.
<P>
Palaeolithic European man of the Miocene and Pliocene times was
a pure Atlantean, as we have previously stated. The Basques are,
of course, of a much later date than this, but their affinities,
as here shown, go far to prove the original extraction of their
remote ancestors. The &quot;mysterious&quot; affinity between
their tongue and that of the Dravidian races of India will be
understood by those who have followed our outline of continental
formations and shiftings.

by such evidence to postulate the unity of race of the early men
of Canary Islands and America (Cf. Benjamin, the &quot;<I>Atlantic
Islands,</I>&quot; p<I>. </I>130.)
<P>
The Guanches of the Canary Islands were lineal descendants of
the Atlanteans. This fact will account for the <I>great stature
</I>evidenced by their old skeletons, as well as by those of their
European congeners the Cro-Magnon Palaeolithic men.
<P>
(5) Any experienced mariner has but to navigate the fathomless
ocean along the <I>Canary Islands </I>to ask himself the question
when or how that group of volcanic and rocky little islands has
been formed, surrounded on every side by that vast watery space.
Such frequent questions led finally to the expedition of the famous
Leopold von Buch, which took place in the first quarter of the
present century. Some geologists maintained that the volcanic
islands had been raised right from the bottom of the ocean, the
depth of which in the immediate vicinity of the island varies
from 6,000 to 18,000 feet. Others were inclined to see in these
groups, including Madeira, the Azores, and the islands of Cape
de Verdes -- the remnants of a gigantic but submerged continent
which had once united Africa with America. The latter men of science
supported their hypothesis by a mass of evidence in its favour,
drawn from ancient &quot;myths.&quot; Hoary &quot;superstitions,&quot;
such as the fairy-like Atlantis of Plato, the <I>Garden of Hesperides,
</I>Atlas supporting the world on his shoulders, all of them mythoi
connected with the peak of Teneriffe, did not go far with sceptical
Science. The identity of animal and vegetable species -- showing
either a previous connection between America and the remaining
groups of the islands -- (the hypothesis of their having been
drifted from the New to the Old World by the waves was too absurd
to stand long) -- found more serious consideration. But it is
only quite lately, and after Donnelly's book had been published
several years, that the theory has greater chances than ever of
becoming an accepted fact. <I>Fossils found on the Eastern Coast
of South America have now been proved to belong to the Jurassic
formations, and are nearly identical with the Jurassic fossils
of Western Europe and Northern Africa. The geological structure
of both coasts is also almost identical</I>;<I> </I>the resemblance
between the smaller marine animals dwelling in the more shallow
waters of South America, the Western African, and the South European
coasts, is also very great. All such facts are bound to bring
naturalists to the conclusion that there has been, in distant
pre-historic ages, a continent which extended from the coast of
Venezuela, across the Atlantic Ocean, to the Canarese Islands
and North Africa, and from Newfoundland nearly to the coast of
France.

<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 792 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
America, North Africa, and Western Europe is a striking enough
fact in itself, and admits of no explanation, unless the ocean
is bridged with an Atlantis. But why, also, is there so <I>marked
a similarity between the fauna</I> (animal life) <I>of the --
</I>now -- <I>isolated Atlantic islands? </I>Why did the specimens
of <I>Brazilian fauna </I>dredged up by Sir C. Wyville Thompson
resemble those of <I>Western Europe? </I>Why does a resemblance
exist between many of the <I>West African </I>and<I> West Indian
</I>animal groups? Again:
<P>
&quot;When the animals and plants of the Old and New World are
compared, one <I>cannot but be struck with their identity</I>;<I>
</I>all, nearly all belong to the same genera, while many, even
of the species, are common to both continents . . . indicating
that they radiated <I>from a common centre</I>&quot; (<I>Atlantis</I>)<I>,
</I>(&quot;<I>Westminster Review,</I>&quot;<I> </I>Jan., 1872).
<P>
The horse, according to Science, originated in America. At least,
a large proportion of the once &quot;missing links&quot; connecting
it with inferior forms have been exhumed from American strata.
<I>How did the horse penetrate into Europe and Asia, if no land
communication bridged the oceanic interspaces? </I>Or if it is
asserted that the horse originated in the New World, how did such
forms as the hipparion, etc., get into America in the first instance
on the migration hypothesis?
<P>
Again &quot;Buffon had . . . remarked in the <I>repetition of
the African in the American fauna, </I>how, for example, the <I>lama
</I>is a juvenescent and feeble <I>copy of the camel, </I>and
how the <I>puma </I>of the New <I>represented the lion </I>of
the Old World&quot; (<I>Schmidt, </I>&quot;<I>Doctrine of Descent
and Darwinism,</I>&quot;<I> p. </I>223)<I>.</I> 
<P>
(7) The following quotation runs with No. (2), but its significance
is such and the writer cited so authoritative, that it deserves
a place to itself: --
<P>
&quot;With regard to the <I>primitive dolichocephalae of America,
</I>I entertain a hypothesis still more bold, namely, that they
are <I>nearly related to the Guanches of the Canary Islands, and
to the Atlantic populations of Africa, </I>the Moors, Tuaricks,
Copts, which Latham comprises under the name of Egyptian-Atlantidae.
We find <I>one and the same form of skull in the Canary Islands,
in front of the African coast, and in the Carib islands, on the
opposite coast which faces Africa. </I>The colour of the skin
on both sides of the Atlantic is represented in these populations
as being of a reddish-brown.&quot; (Professor Retzius, &quot;Smithsonian
Report,&quot; 1859, p. 266.)
<P>
If, then, Basques and Cro-Magnon Cave-Men are of the same race
as the Canarese Guanches, it follows that the former are also
allied to the aborigines of America. This is the conclusion which
the independent investigations of Retzius, Virchow, and de Quatrefages
necessitate. The <I>Atlantean affinities </I>of these three types
become patent.
<P>
(8) The sea-soundings undertaken by <STRONG>H.M.S</STRONG>. &quot;Challenger&quot;
and the &quot;Dolphin,&quot; have established the fact that a
huge elevation some 3,000 <I>miles in length, </I>projecting upwards
from the abysmal depths of the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 793 RECENT SUGGESTIVE DISCOVERIES.</H6>

<P>
Atlantic, extends from a point near the British Islands southwards,
curving round near Cape de Verde, and running in a south-easterly
direction along the West African Coast. This elevation averages
some<I> 9,000 feet in height, </I>and rises above the waves at
the Azores, Ascension, and other places. In the ocean depths around
the neighbourhood of the former the ribs of a former massive piece
of land have been discovered (<I>vide</I> investigations of United
States Ship &quot;Dolphin&quot; and others). &quot;The inequalities,
the <I>mountains and valleys </I>of its surface <I>could never
have been produced in accordance with any known laws for the deposition
of sediment, nor by submarine elevation</I>;<I> </I>but, on the
contrary, must have been carved by agencies acting above the water-level.&quot;
<I>-- </I>(<I>Scientific American, </I>July 28th, 1877). It is
most probable that necks of land formerly existed knitting Atlantis
to South America, somewhere above the mouth of the Amazon; to
Africa near Cape de Verde, while a similar point of juncture with
Spain is not unlikely, as contended for by Donnelly. (<I>Vide
</I>his chart, &quot;Atlantis,&quot; p. 47, Eng. Ed., 1884, though
he deals with only a fragment of the <I>real</I> continent.) Whether
the latter existed or not, is of no consequence, as the fact that
(what is now) N. W. Africa was -- before the elevation of the
Sahara and the rupture of the Gibraltar connection -- an extension
of Spain. Consequently no difficulty can be raised as to how the
migration of the European fauna (etc.) took place.
<P>
Enough has now been said from the <I>purely scientific standpoint,
</I>and it is needless, in view of the manner in which the subject
has now been developed on the lines of <I>esoteric knowledge,
</I>to swell the mass of testimony further. In conclusion, the
words of one of the most intuitive writers of the day may be cited
as admirably illustrative of the opinions of the occultist, who
awaits in patience the dawn of the coming day: --
<P>
&quot;We are but beginning to understand the past; one hundred
years ago the world knew nothing of Pompeii or Herculaneum; nothing
of the lingual tie that binds together the Indo-European nations;
nothing of the significance of the vast volume of inscriptions
upon the tombs and temples of Egypt; nothing of the meaning of
the arrow-headed inscriptions of Babylon; nothing of the marvellous
civilizations revealed in the remains of Yucatan, Mexico, and
Peru. We are on the threshold. Scientific investigation is advancing
with giant strides. Who shall say that one hundred years from
now, the great museums of the world may not be adorned with gems,
statues, arms, and implements from Atlantis, while the libraries
of the world shall contain translations of its inscriptions, throwing
new light upon all the past history of the human race, and all
the great problems which now perplex the thinkers of to-day.&quot;*

<P>
And now to conclude.
<P>
-------
<P>
We have concerned ourself with the ancient records of the nations,
with the doctrine of chronological and psychic cycles, of which
these records are the tangible proof; and with many other subjects,
which may, at first sight, seem out of place in this volume.
<P>
But they were necessary in truth. In dealing with the secret annals
and traditions of so many nations, whose very origins have never
been ascertained on more secure grounds than inferential suppositions,
in giving out the beliefs and philosophy of more than <I>prehistoric
</I>races, it is not quite as easy to deal with the subject matter
as it would be if only the philosophy of one special race, and
its evolution, were concerned. The Secret Doctrine is the common
property of the countless millions of men born under various climates,
in times with which History refuses to deal, and to which esoteric
teachings assign dates incompatible with the theories of Geology
and Anthropology. The birth and evolution of the Sacred Science
of the Past are lost in the very night of Time; and that, even,
which is historic -- <I>i.e.,</I> that which is found scattered
hither and thither throughout ancient classical literature --
is, in almost every case, attributed by modern criticism to lack
of observation in the ancient writers, or to superstition born
out of the ignorance of antiquity. It is, therefore, impossible
to treat this subject as one would the ordinary evolution of an
art or science in some well-known historical nation. It is only
by bringing before the reader an abundance of proofs all tending
to show that in every age, under every condition of civilization
and knowledge, the educated classes of every nation made themselves
the more or less faithful echoes of one identical system and its
fundamental traditions -- that he can be made to see that so many
streams of the same water must have had a common source from which
they started. What was this source? If coming events are said
to cast their shadows before, past events cannot fall to leave
their impress behind them. It is, then, by those shadows of the
hoary Past and their fantastic silhouettes on the external screen
of every religion and philosophy, that we can, by checking them
as we go along, and comparing them, trace out finally the body
that produced them. There must be truth and fact in that which
every people of antiquity accepted and made the foundation of
its religions and its faith. Moreover, as Haliburton said, &quot;Hear
one side, and you will be in the dark; hear both sides, and all
will be clear.&quot; The public has hitherto had access to, and
heard but one side -- or rather the two one-sided views of two
diametrically opposed classes of men, whose <I>prima</I> <I>facie
</I>propositions or respective premises differ widely, but whose
final conclusions are the same -- Science and Theology. And now
our<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 795 OLD MASONIC SYMBOLISM.</H6>

<P>
readers have an opportunity to hear the other -- the defendants'
-- justification on and learn the nature of our arguments.
<P>
Were the public to be left to its old opinions: namely, on one
side, that Occultism, Magic, the legends of old, etc., were all
the outcome of ignorance and superstition; and on the other, that
everything outside the orthodox groove was the work of the devil,
what would be the result? In other words, had no theosophical
and mystic literature obtained a hearing for the few last years,
the present work would have had a poor chance of impartial consideration.
It would have been proclaimed -- and by many will still be so
proclaimed -- a fairy tale woven out of abstruse problems, poised
in, and based on the air; built of soap bubbles, bursting at the
slightest touch of serious reflection, with <EM>no</EM> foundation,
as it would be alleged, to stand upon. Even &quot;the ancient
<I>superstitious </I>and<I> credulous </I>classics&quot; have
no word of reference to it in clear and unmistakable terms, and
the symbols themselves fail to yield a hint at the existence of
such a system. Such would be the verdict of all. But when it becomes
undeniably proven that the claim of the modern Asiatic nations
to a Secret Science and an esoteric history of the world, is based
on fact; that, though hitherto unknown to the masses and a veiled
mystery even to the learned, (because they never had the key to
a right understanding of the abundant hints thrown out by the
ancient classics), it is still no fairy tale, but an actuality
-- then the present work will become but the pioneer of many more
such books. The statement that hitherto even the keys discovered
by some great scholars have proved too rusty for use, and that
they were but the silent witnesses that there do exist mysteries
behind the veil which are unreachable without a new key -- is
borne out by too many proofs to be easily dismissed. An instance
may be given as an illustration out of the history of Freemasonry.

to a mistaken notion of the origin of the craft, the name of <I>Free
Masonry </I>and<I> Free Masons. </I>The mistake is due, he says,
to those who connect Masonry <I>with the building</I> of Solomon's
Temple, deriving its origin from it. He derides the idea, and
says: . . &quot;The<I> Franc Mason </I>(which is not <I>macon
libre, </I>or free masonry) knew well when adopting the title,
that it was no question of <I>building a wall,</I> but that of
<I>being initiated into the ancient Mysteries </I>veiled under
the name of<I> Francmaconnerie </I>(Freemasonry); that his work
was only to be the continuation or the renovation of the ancient
mysteries, and that he was to become a <I>mason </I>after the
manner of <I>Apollo </I>or Amphion. And do not we know that the
ancient <I>initiated </I>poets, when speaking <I>of the foundation</I>

<P>
<I>of a city, </I>meant thereby the <I>establishment of a doctrine?
</I>Thus <I>Neptune,</I> the god of reasoning, and <I>Apollo,
</I>the god of the <I>hidden </I>things, presented themselves
as masons before Laomedon, Priam's father, to help him to build
the city of Troy -- that is to say, to establish the Trojan religion.&quot;
(<I>Maconnerie Orthodoxe, </I>p. 44.)
<P>
Such <I>veiled </I>sentences with double meaning abound in ancient
classical writers. Therefore, had an attempt been made to show
that, <I>e.g.,</I> Laomedon was the founder of a branch of archaic
mysteries in which the earth-bound material soul (the fourth principle),
was personified in Menelaus' faithless wife (the fair Helen),
if Ragon had not come to corroborate what we asserted, we might
be told that no classical author speaks of it, and that Homer
shows Laomedon building a<I> city, </I>not an <I>esoteric worship
</I>or <STRONG>M</STRONG>YSTERIES! And who are those left now,
save a few <I>Initiates, </I>who understand the language and correct
meaning of such symbolical terms?
<P>
But after having pointed to many a misconceived symbol bearing
on our thesis, there still remains more than one difficulty to
be overcome. Most important among several such obstacles is that
of chronology. But this could hardly be helped.
<P>
Wedged in between theological chronology and that of the geologists,
backed by all the materialistic Anthropologists who assign dates
to man and nature which fit in with their own theories alone --
what could the writer do except what is being done? Namely, since
theology places the Deluge 2448 <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>., and the
World's Creation only 5890 years ago; and since the accurate researches
by the methods of <I>exact </I>Science, have led the geologists
and physicists to assign to the incrusted age of our Globe between
10 million and 1,000 million of years* (a <I>trifling</I> difference,
verily!): and the Anthropologists to vary their divergence of
opinion as to the appearance of man -- between 25,000 and 500,000
of years -- what can one who studies the Occult doctrine do, but
come out and bravely present the esoteric calculations before
the world?
<P>
But to do this, corroboration by even a few &quot;historical&quot;
proofs was necessary, though all know the real value of the so-called
&quot;historical evidence.&quot; For, whether man had appeared
on earth 18,000 or 18,000,000 years ago, can make no difference
to profane History, since it begins hardly a couple of thousand
years before our era, and since, even then, it grapples hopelessly
with the clash and din of contradictory and mutually-destroying
opinions around it. Nevertheless, in view of the respect the average
reader has been brought up in for exact science, even that short
<I>Past </I>would remain meaningless, unless the esoteric teachings
were corroborated and supported on the spot --

<P>
<I>whenever possible</I> -- by<I> </I>references to historical
names of a so-called <I>historical </I>period. This is the only
guide that can be given to the beginner before he is permitted
to start among the (to him) unfamiliar windings of that dark labyrinth
called the pre-historic ages. This necessity has been complied
with. It is only hoped that the desire to do so, which has led
the writer to be constantly bringing ancient and modern evidence
as a corroboration of the Archaic and quite unhistoric Past, will
not bring on her the accusation of having sorely jumbled up without
order or method the various and widely-separated periods of history
and tradition. But literary form and method had to be sacrificed
to the greater clearness of the general exposition.
<P>
To accomplish the proposed task, the writer had to resort to the
rather unusual means of dividing each volume or Book into three
Parts; the first of which only is the consecutive, though very
fragmentary, history of the Cosmogony and the Evolution of Man
on this globe. But these two volumes had to serve as a <STRONG>P</STRONG>ROLOGUE,
and prepare the reader's mind for those which shall now follow.
In treating of Cosmogony and then of the Anthropogenesis of mankind,
it was necessary to show that no religion, since the very earliest,
has ever been entirely based on fiction, as none was the object
of special revelation; and that it is dogma alone which has ever
been killing primeval truth. Finally, that no human-born doctrine,
no creed, however sanctified by custom and antiquity, can compare
in sacredness with the religion of Nature. The Key of Wisdom that
unlocks the massive gates leading to the arcana of the innermost
sanctuaries can be found hidden in her bosom only: and that bosom
is in the countries pointed to by the great seer of the past century
Emanuel Swedenborg. There lies the heart of nature, that shrine
whence issued the early races of primeval Humanity, and which
is the cradle of <I>physical </I>man.
<P>
Thus far have proceeded the rough outlines of the beliefs and
tenets of the archaic, earliest Races contained in their hitherto
secret Scriptural records. But our explanations are by no means
complete, nor do they pretend to give out the full text, or to
have been read by the help of more than three or four keys out
of the sevenfold bunch of esoteric interpretation, and even this
has only been partially accomplished. The work is too gigantic
for any one person to undertake, far more to accomplish. Our main
concern was simply to prepare the soil. This, we trust we have
done. These two volumes only constitute the work of a pioneer
who has forced his way into the well-nigh impenetrable jungle
of the virgin forests of the Land of the Occult. A commencement
has been made to fell and uproot the deadly upas trees of superstition,
prejudice, and conceited ignorance, so that these two<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 798 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
volumes should form for the student a fitting prelude for Volumes
<STRONG>III</STRONG>. and <STRONG>IV</STRONG>. Until the rubbish
of the ages is cleared away from the minds of the Theosophists
to whom these volumes are dedicated, it is impossible that the
more practical teaching contained in the Third Volume should be
understood. Consequently, it entirely depends upon the reception
with which Volumes <STRONG>I.</STRONG> and <STRONG>II</STRONG>.
will meet at the hands of Theosophists and Mystics, whether these
last two volumes will ever be published, though they are <I>almost
</I>completed.
