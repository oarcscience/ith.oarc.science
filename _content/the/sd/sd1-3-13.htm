<H4>XIII.<BR>
SCIENTIFIC AND ESOTERIC EVIDENCE FOR, AND OBJECTIONS TO, THE MODERN
NEBULAR THEORY.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>O</STRONG>F late Esoteric Cosmogony has been frequently
opposed by the phantom of this theory and its ensuing hypotheses.
&quot;Can this most scientific teaching be denied by your adepts?&quot;
it is asked. &quot;Not entirely,&quot; is the reply, &quot;but
the admissions of the men of Science themselves <EM>kill</EM>
it; and there remains nothing for the adepts to deny.&quot;
<P>
To make of Science an integral <EM>whole </EM>necessitates, indeed,
the study of spiritual and psychic, as well as physical Nature.
Otherwise it will ever be like the anatomy of man, discussed of
old by the profane from the point of view of his shell-side and
in ignorance of the interior work. Even Plato, the greatest philosopher
of his country, became guilty, before his initiation, of such
statements as that liquids pass into the stomach through the lungs.
Without metaphysics, as Mr. H. J. Slack says, <EM>real</EM> science
is inadmissible.
<P>
The nebulae exist; yet the nebular theory is wrong. A nebula exists
in a state of entire elemental dissociation. It<EM> is </EM>gaseous
and -- something else besides, which can hardly be connected with
gases, as known to physical science; and it <EM>is</EM> self-luminous.
But that is all. The sixty-two &quot;coincidences&quot; enumerated
by Professor Stephen Alexander,* confirming the nebular theory,
may all be explained by esoteric science; though, as this is not
an astronomical work, the refutations are not attempted at present.
Laplace and Faye come nearer to the correct theory than any; but
of the speculations of Laplace there remains little in the present
theory except its general features. Nevertheless, &quot;there
is in Laplace's theory,&quot; says John Stuart Mill, &quot;<EM>nothing
hypothetical</EM>; it is an example of legitimate reasoning from
present effect to its past cause; it assumes nothing more than
that objects which really exist, obey the laws which are known
to be obeyed by all terrestrial objects resembling them.&quot;
(<EM>System of Logic</EM>,<EM> </EM>p. 229).
<P>
This from such an eminent logician as Mill was, would be valuable,
if it could only be proved that &quot;terrestrial objects <EM>resembling
. </EM>. .&quot; celestial objects at such a distance as the nebulae
are<EM> </EM>-- <EM>resemble those objects in reality</EM>,<EM>
not alone in appearance.</EM> 
<P>
Another of the fallacies from the Occult stand-point, which are
embodied in the modern theory as it now stands, is the hypothesis
that the planets were all detached from the Sun; that they are
bone of
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

</H6>

<P>
his bone, and flesh of his flesh; whereas, the Sun and planets
are only co-uterine brothers, having had the same nebular origin,
only in a different mode from that postulated by modern astronomy.
<P>
The many objections raised against the homogeneity of original
diffuse matter, on the ground of the uniformity in the composition
of the fixed stars, by some opponents of the modern nebular theory,
do not affect the question of that homogeneity at all, but only
the said theory. Our solar nebula may not be completely homogeneous,
or, rather, it may fail to reveal itself as such to the astronomers,
and yet be <EM>de facto </EM>homogeneous. The stars do differ
in their constituent materials and even exhibit elements quite
unknown on earth; nevertheless, this does not affect the point
that primeval matter -- <EM>i.e.</EM>,<EM> </EM>as it <EM>appeared
even in its first </EM>differentiation from its <EM>laya </EM>condition*
-- is yet to this day homogeneous, at immense distances, in the
depths of infinitude, and likewise at points not far removed from
the outskirts of our solar system.
<P>
Finally, there does not exist one single fact brought forward
by the learned objectors against the &quot;nebular theory,&quot;
(false as it is, and hence, <EM>illogically enough</EM>,<EM> </EM>fatal
to the hypothesis of the homogeneity of matter,) that can withstand
criticism. One error leads into another. A false premise will
naturally lead to a false conclusion, although an inadmissible
inference does not <EM>necessarily </EM>affect the validity of
the major proposition of the syllogism. Thus, one may leave every
side-issue and inference from the evidence of spectra, and lines,
as simply provisional for the present, and abandon all matters
of detail to physical science. The duty of the Occultist lies
with the <EM>Soul and Spirit </EM>of Cosmic Space, not merely
with its illusive appearance and behaviour. That of official physical
science is to analyze and study its <EM>shell</EM> -- the <EM>Ultima
Thule </EM>of<EM> </EM>the Universe and man, in the opinion of
Materialism.
<P>
With the latter, Occultism has nought to do. It is only with the
theories of such men of learning as Kepler, Kant, Oersted, and
Sir W. Herschell, who believed in a Spiritual world, that Occult
Cosmogony might treat, and attempt a satisfactory compromise.
But the views of those physicists differed vastly from the latest
modern speculations. Kant and Herschell had in their mind's eye
speculations upon the origin and <EM>the final destiny</EM>,<EM>
</EM>as well as the present aspect, of the Universe, from a far
more philosophical and psychic standpoint; whereas modern Cosmology
and Astronomy now repudiate anything like research into the mysteries
of being. The result is what might be expected: complete failure
and inextricable contradictions in the thousand and one varieties
of so-called scientific theories, and in this theory as in all
others.
<P>
The nebular hypothesis, involving the theory of the existence
of a

</H6>

<P>
* Beyond the zero-line of action.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 590 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
primeval matter, diffused in a nebulous condition, is of no modern
date in astronomy as everyone knows. Anaximenes, of the Ionian
school, had already taught that the sidereal bodies were formed
through the progressive condensation of a primordial <EM>pregenetic
</EM>matter, which had almost a negative weight, and was spread
out through Space in an extremely sublimated condition.
<P>
Tycho Brahe, who viewed the Milky Way as an ethereal substance,
thought the new star that appeared in Cassiopoeia, in 1572, had
been formed out of that matter. (&quot;<EM>Progymnasmata</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>p. 795.) Kepler believed the star of 1606 had been likewise
formed out of the ethereal substance that fills the universe (&quot;<EM>De
stella nova in pede Serpentarii</EM>,&quot; p<EM>. </EM>115).
He attributed to that same ether the apparition of a luminous
ring around the moon, during the total eclipse of the sun observed
at Naples in 1605<EM>. </EM>(&quot;<EM>Hypotheses Cosmogoniques</EM>,&quot;<EM>
C. Wolf.</EM>)<EM> </EM>Still later, in 1714, -- the existence
of a self-luminous matter was recognised by Halley (&quot;<EM>Philosophical
Transactions</EM>&quot;)<EM>. </EM>Finally, the journal of this
name published in 1811 the famous hypothesis on the transformation
of the nebulae into stars, by the eminent astronomer, Sir W. Herschell
(<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Philosophical Transactions</EM>,&quot;<EM>
of </EM>1811, p. 269, <EM>et seq.</EM>),<EM> </EM>after which
the nebular theory was accepted by the Royal Academies.
<P>
In &quot;Five years of Theosophy,&quot; on p. 245, an article
headed &quot;<EM>Do</EM> <EM>the Adepts deny the Nebular Theory?</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>may be read. The answer there given is &quot;No; they do
not deny <EM>its general propositions</EM>,<EM> nor the approximative
truth of the scientific </EM>hypotheses. They only deny the <EM>completeness
</EM>of the present, as well as the entire error of the many so-called
&quot;exploded&quot; old theories, which, during the last century,
have followed each other in such rapid succession.&quot;
<P>
This was proclaimed at the time &quot;an evasive answer.&quot;
Such disrespect to official science, it was argued, must be justified
by the presentation, to replace the <EM>orthodox </EM>speculation,
of another theory more complete than theirs, and having a firmer
ground to stand upon. To this there is but one reply; it is useless
to give out isolated theories with regard to things embodied in
a whole and consecutive system, which, when separated from the
main body of the teaching, would necessarily lose their vital
coherence and thus do no good when studied independently. To be
able to appreciate and accept the occult views on the nebular
theory, one has to study the whole esoteric cosmogonical system.
And the time has hardly arrived for the astronomers to be asked
to accept <EM>Fohat </EM>and the divine Builders. Even the undeniably
correct surmises of Sir W. Herschell], that had nothing &quot;supernatural&quot;
in them, about the sun being called &quot;<EM>globe of fire</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(perhaps) <EM>metaphorically</EM>,<EM> </EM>and his early
speculations about the nature of that which is now called the
Nasmyth willow-leaf theory -- caused that most eminent of all
astro-<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 591 FORCES ARE EMANATIONS.</H6>

<P>
nomers to be smiled at by other, far less eminent colleagues,
who saw and now see in his ideas only &quot;imaginative and fanciful
theories.&quot; Before the whole esoteric system could be given
out and appreciated by the astronomers, they would have to return
to some of those &quot;antiquated ideas,&quot; not only to those
of Herschell, but to the dreams of the oldest Hindu astronomers,
and to abandon their own theories, none the less &quot;fanciful&quot;
because they have appeared in one case nearly 80 years and in
the other many thousands of years later. Foremost of all they
would have to repudiate the ideas on the Sun's <EM>solidity</EM>
and <EM>incandescence; </EM>the sun &quot;glowing&quot; most undeniably,
but not &quot;burning.&quot; Then it is stated, with regard to
Sir W. Herschell's view that those &quot;objects,&quot; as he
called the &quot;willow leaves,&quot; are the immediate <EM>sources</EM>
<EM>of the solar light and heat. </EM>And though the esoteric
teaching does not regard these as he did -- namely, <EM>organisms
</EM>as partaking of the nature of life,&quot; for the Solar &quot;Beings&quot;
will hardly place themselves within telescopic focus -- yet it
asserts that the whole Universe is full of such &quot;organisms,&quot;
conscious and active according to the proximity or distance of
their planes to, or from, our plane of consciousness; and that
finally the great astronomer was right in saying that &quot;we
do not know that vital action is competent to develop at once
heat, light, and electricity&quot; while speculating on those
supposed &quot;organisms.&quot; For, at the risk of being laughed
at by the whole world of physicists, the Occultists maintain that
all the &quot;Forces&quot; of the Scientists have their origin
in the <EM>Vital Principle</EM>,<EM> </EM>the ONE LIFE collectively
of our Solar system -- that &quot;<EM>life</EM>&quot; being a
portion, or rather one of the <EM>aspects </EM>of the One Universal
LIFE.
<P>
We may, therefore, as in the article under consideration, wherein,
on the authority of the Adepts, it was maintained that it is &quot;sufficient
to make a <EM>resume </EM>of what the solar physicists <EM>do
not know</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>--<EM> </EM>we may, we maintain,
define our position with regard to the modern nebular theory and
its evident incorrectness, by simply pointing out facts diametrically
opposed to it in its present form. And to begin with, what does
it teach?
<P>
Summarizing the aforesaid hypotheses, it becomes plain that Laplace's
theory -- now made quite unrecognisable, moreover -- was an unfortunate
one. He postulates in the first place Cosmic matter, existing
in a state of diffuse nebulosity &quot;so fine that its presence
could hardly have been suspected.&quot; No attempt is made by
him to penetrate into the arcana of being, except as regards the
immediate evolution of our small solar system.
<P>
Consequently, whether one accepts or rejects his theory in its
bearing upon the immediate cosmological problems presented for
solution, he can only be said to have thrown back the mystery
a little further. To the eternal query -- &quot;Whence matter
itself; whence the evolutionary impetus<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 592 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
determining its cyclic aggregations and dissolutions; whence the
exquisite symmetry and order into which the primeval atoms arrange
and group themselves?&quot; -- no answer is attempted by Laplace.
All we are confronted with, is a sketch of the <EM>probable </EM>broad
principles on which the actual process is assumed to be based.
Well, and what is this now celebrated note on the said process?
What has he given so wonderfully new and original, that its ground-work,
at any rate, should have served as a basis for the modern nebular
theory? This is what one gathers from various astronomical works.
<P>
Laplace thought that, consequent on the condensation of the atoms
of the primeval nebula, according to the &quot;Law&quot; of gravity,
the now gaseous, or perhaps, partially liquid mass, acquired a
rotatory motion. As the velocity of this rotation increased, it
assumed the form of a thin disc; finally, the centrifugal force
overpowering that of cohesion, huge rings were detached from the
edge of the whirling incandescent masses, contracting necessarily
by gravitation (as accepted) into spheroidal bodies, which would
necessarily still continue to preserve the same orbit occupied
previously by the outer zone from which they were separated. (&quot;Laplace
conceived that the external and internal zones of the ring would
rotate with the same angular velocity, which would be the case
with a solid ring; but the principle of equal areas requires the
inner zones to rotate more rapidly than the outer.&quot;)* The
velocity of the outer edge of each nascent planet, he said, exceeding
that of the inner, there results a rotation on its axis. The more
dense bodies would be thrown off last; and finally, during the
preliminary state of their formation, the newly-segregated orbs
in their turn throw off one or more satellites . . . In formulating
the history of the rupture and planetation of rings, Laplace says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Almost always each ring of vapours must have broken up into
numerous masses, which, moving with a nearly uniform velocity,
must have continued to circulate at the same distance around the
Sun. These masses must have taken a spheroidal form with a motion
of rotation in the same direction as their revolution, since the
inner molecules (those nearer to the Sun) would have less actual
velocity than the exterior ones. They must then have formed as
many planets in a state of vapour. But, if one of them was sufficiently
powerful to unite successively, by its attraction, all the others
around its centre, the ring of vapours must have been thus transformed
into a single spheroidal mass of vapours circulating around the
Sun with a rotation in the same direction as its revolution. The
latter case has been the more common, but the solar system presents
us the first case, in the four small planets which move between
Jupiter and Mars.&quot;

of this

mistakes of Laplace in his work; but as a <EM>geologist </EM>he

<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 593 UNANSWERABLE QUERIES.</H6>

<P>
hypothesis,&quot; it is impossible not to recognise the insurmountable
difficulties with which it is attended. Why, for instance, do
we find that the satellites of Neptune and Uranus display a retrograde
motion; that, in spite of its closer proximity to the Sun, Venus
is less dense than the Earth? Similarly, the more distant Uranus
is more dense than Saturn? How is it that so many variations in
the inclination of their axes and orbits are present in the supposed
progeny of the central orb; that such startling variations in
the size of the planets is noticeable; that the Satellites of
Jupiter are more dense by .288 than their primary -- that the
phenomena of meteoric and cometic systems still remain unaccounted
for? To quote the words of a Master: &quot;They (the Occultists)
find that the centrifugal theory of Western birth is unable to
cover <EM>all</EM> the ground. That, unaided, it can neither account
for every oblate spheroid, nor explain away such evident difficulties
as are presented by the relative density of some planets. How,
indeed, can any calculation of centrifugal force explain to us,
for instance, why Mercury, whose rotation is, we are told, only
about one-third that of the Earth, and its density only about
one-fourth greater than the Earth, should have a polar compression
<EM>more than ten times as great as the latter? </EM>And again,
why Jupiter, whose equatorial rotation is said to be 'twenty-seven
times greater, and its density only about one-fifth that of the
earth' should have its polar compression seventeen times greater
than that of the earth? Or why Saturn, with an equatorial velocity
fifty-five times greater than Mercury for centripetal force to
contend with, should have its polar compression <EM>only three
times </EM>greater than Mercury's? To crown the above contradictions,
we are asked to believe in the Central Forces, as taught by Modern
Science, even when told that the equatorial matter of the Sun,
with more than four times the centrifugal velocity of the Earth's
equatorial surface, and only about one-fourth part of the gravitation
of the equatorial matter, has not manifested any tendency to bulge
at the Solar equator, nor shown the least flattening of the poles
of the Solar axis. In other and clearer words, the Sun, with only
one fourth of our Earth's density for the centrifugal force to
work upon, has no polar compression at all! We find this objection
made by more than one astronomer, yet never explained away satisfactorily
so far as the 'Adepts' are aware.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Therefore, do they (the Adepts) say, that the great men
of science of the West, knowing . . . . . next to nothing either
about cometary matter, centrifugal and centripetal forces, the
nature of the nebulae, or the physical constitution of the Sun,
the Stars, or even the Moon, are imprudent to speak as confidently
as they do about the 'central mass of the Sun' whirling out into
space planets, comets, and what not . . . .&quot; &quot;We maintain
that it (the Sun) evolves out only the <EM>life</EM>-principle,
the<HR>

<P>
Soul of those bodies, <EM>giving and receiving </EM>it back, in
our solar system, as the 'Universal Life-Giver' . . . . in infinitude
and Eternity; that the solar system is as much the <EM>microcosm
</EM>of the ONE Macrocosm as man is the former when compared with
his own little Solar Cosmos.&quot;*
<P>
The essential faculty possessed by all the cosmic and terrestrial
elements, of generating within themselves a regular and harmonious
series of results, a concatenation of causes and effects, is an
irrefutable proof that they are either animated by an <EM>extra
</EM>or <EM>intra</EM> INTELLIGENCE, or conceal such within or
behind the <EM>manifested veil. </EM>Occultism does not deny the
certainty of the mechanical origin of the Universe; it only claims
the absolute necessity of mechanicians of some sort behind those
Elements (or <EM>within</EM>)<EM> </EM>-- a dogma with us. It
is not the fortuitous assistance of the atoms of Lucretius, who
himself knew better, that built the Kosmos and all in it. Nature
herself contradicts such a theory. Celestial space, containing
matter so attenuated as is Ether, cannot be called on, with or
without attraction, to explain the common motion of the sidereal
hosts. Although the perfect accord of their mutual revolution
indicates clearly the presence of a mechanical cause in Nature,
Newton, who of all men had best right to trust to his deductions
and views, was nevertheless forced to abandon the idea of ever
explaining, by the laws of <EM>known </EM>Nature and its Material
forces, the original impulse given to the millions of orbs. He
recognised fully the limits that separate the action of natural
Forces from that of the <STRONG>I</STRONG>NTELLIGENCES that set
the immutable laws into order and action. And if a <STRONG>N</STRONG>EWTON
had to renounce such hope, which of the modern materialistic pigmies
has the right of saying: &quot;I know better&quot;?
<P>
To become complete and comprehensible, a cosmogonical theory has
to start with a primordial Substance diffused throughout boundless
Space, <EM>of an intellectual and divine Nature. </EM>That substance
must be the Soul and Spirit, the Synthesis and <EM>Seventh Principle
</EM>of the manifested Kosmos, and, to serve as a spiritual <EM>Upadhi
</EM>to this, there must be the sixth, its vehicle<EM> </EM>--<EM>
primordial physical matter</EM>,<EM> </EM>so to speak, though
its nature must escape for ever our limited <EM>normal </EM>senses.
It is easy for an astronomer, if endowed with an imaginative faculty,
to build a theory of the emergence of the universe out of chaos,
by simply applying to it the principles of mechanics. But such
a universe will always prove, with respect to its scientific human
creator, a Frankenstein's monster; it will lead him into endless
perplexities. The application of the mechanical laws only can
never carry the speculator beyond the objective world; nor will
it unveil to men the origin and final destiny of Kosmos. This

<EM>Theory?</EM>&quot; <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 595 WHAT ARE THE NEBULAE?</H6>

<P>
whither the nebular theory has led Science. In sober fact and
truth this theory is twin sister to that of Ether, and both are
the offsprings of necessity; one as indispensable to account for
the transmission of light, as the other to explain the problem
of the origin of the solar systems. The question with them is,
how the same homogeneous matter* could, obeying the laws of Newton,
give birth to bodies -- sun, planets, and their satellites --
subject to conditions of identity of motion and formed of such
heterogeneous elements.
<P>
Has the nebular theory helped to solve the problem, even if applied
solely to bodies considered as inanimate and material? We say
most decidedly not. What progress has it made since 1811, when
Sir W. Herschell's paper, first presenting facts based on observation
and showing the existence of nebular matter, made the &quot;Sons&quot;
of the Royal Society &quot;shout for joy&quot;? Since then a still
greater discovery has permitted, through spectrum analysis, the
verification and corroboration of Sir W. Herschell's conjecture.
Laplace demanded some kind of primitive &quot;world stuff &quot;
to prove the idea of progressive world-evolution and growth. Here
it is, as offered two millenniums ago.
<P>
The &quot;world stuff,&quot; now <EM>nebulae</EM>,<EM> </EM>was
known from the highest antiquity. Anaxagoras taught that, having
differentiated, the subsequent commixture of heterogeneous substances
remained motionless and unorganized, until finally &quot;the Mind&quot;
-- the collective body of Dhyan Chohans, we say -- began to work
upon and communicated to it motion and order (<EM>Aristotle</EM>'<EM>s
</EM>&quot;<EM>Physica</EM>,&quot;<EM> viii</EM>,<EM> </EM>1<EM>.</EM>)
The theory is now taken up in its first portion, that of <EM>any
</EM>&quot;Mind&quot; interfering with it being rejected. Spectrum
analysis reveals the existence of nebulae formed entirely of gases
and luminous vapours. Is this the primitive nebular matter? The
spectra reveal, it is said, the physical conditions of the matter
which emits cosmic light. The spectra of the resolvable and the
irresolvable nebulae are shown to be entirely different, the spectra
of the latter showing their physical state to be that of glowing
gas or vapour. The bright lines of one nebula reveal the existence
of hydrogen in it, and of other material substances known and
unknown. The same in the atmospheres of the Sun and stars. This
leads to the direct inference that a star is formed by the condensation
of a nebula; hence that even the metals themselves on earth are
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Had astronomers held simply, in their present state of knowledge,
to the hypothesis of Laplace, which was simply the formation of
the planetary system, it might in time have resulted in something
like an approximate truth. But the two parts of the general problem,
that of the formation of the universe, or the formation of the
suns and stars from the primitive matter, and then the development
of the planets around their sun, rest on quite different facts
in nature and are even so viewed by Science itself. They are at
the opposite poles of being.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 596 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
formed owing to the condensation of hydrogen or some other primitive
matter, some ancestral cousin to &quot;helium,&quot; perhaps,
or some yet unknown stuff? <EM>This does not clash with the occult
teachings. </EM>And this is the problem that chemistry is trying
to solve; and it must succeed sooner or later in the task, accepting
<EM>nolens volens</EM>,<EM> </EM>when it does, the esoteric teaching.
But when this does happen, it will kill the nebular theory as
it now stands.
<P>
Meanwhile Astronomy cannot accept in any way, if it is to be regarded
as <EM>an exact </EM>science, the present theory of the filiation
of stars -- even if occultism does so in its own way, as it explains
this filiation differently -- because astronomy has <EM>not one
single physical datum </EM>to show for it. Astronomy could anticipate
Chemistry in proving the existence of the fact, if it could show
a planetary nebula exhibiting a spectrum of three or four bright
lines, gradually condensing and transforming into a star, with
a spectrum all covered with a number of dark lines. But &quot;the
question of the variability of the nebula, even as to their form,
is yet one of the mysteries of Astronomy. The data of observation
possessed so far are of too recent an origin, too uncertain to
permit us to affirm anything<EM>.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Cosmogonical
Hypotheses of Wolf.</EM>)
<P>
Since the discovery of the spectroscope, its magic power has revealed
to its adepts only one single transformation of a star of this
kind; and even that one showed directly the reverse of what is
needed as proof in favour of the nebular theory; namely -- <EM>a
star transforming itself into a planetary nebula. </EM>As told
in <EM>The Observatory </EM>(<EM>Vol. I.</EM>,<EM> p. </EM>185),
the temporary star which appeared in the constellation Cygnus,
in November, 1876, discovered by J. F. J. Schmidt, exhibited a
spectrum broken by very brilliant lines. Gradually, the continuous
spectrum and most of the lines disappeared, leaving finally one
single brilliant line, which appeared to coincide with the green
line of the nebula.
<P>
Though this metamorphosis is not irreconcileable with the hypothesis
of the nebular origin of the stars, nevertheless this single solitary
case rests on no observation whatever, least of all on direct
observation. The occurrence may have been due to several other
causes. Since astronomers are inclined to think our planets are
tending toward precipitation on the Sun, why should not that star
have blazed out owing to a collision of such precipitated planets,
or, as many suggest, the appulse of a comet? Anyhow, the only
known instance of a star transformation since 1811 is not favourable
to the nebular theory. Moreover, on the question of this theory,
as in all others, astronomers disagree.
<P>
In our own age, it was Buffon, before Laplace ever thought of
it, who, very much struck by the identity of motion in the planets,
was the first to propose the hypothesis of the planets and their
satellites originating in<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 597 THE META-ELEMENTS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE.
</H6>

<P>
the bosom of the Sun. Forthwith, and for the purpose, he invented
a special comet, supposed to have torn out, by a powerful oblique
blow, the quantity of matter necessary to their formation. Laplace
gave its dues to the &quot;comet&quot; in his &quot;<EM>Exposition
du Systeme du Monde.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(Note VII.) But the idea
was seized and even improved upon by a conception of the alternate
evolution from the Sun's central mass of planets <EM>apparently
</EM>without weight or influence on the motion of the visible
planets -- and as evidently without any more existence than the
likeness of Moses in the moon.
<P>
But the modern theory is also a variation on the systems elaborated
by Kant and Laplace. The idea of both was that, at the origin
of things, all that matter which now enters into the composition
of the planetary bodies was spread over all the space comprised
in the solar system -- and even beyond. It was a nebula of extremely
small density, whose condensation gradually gave birth, by a mechanism
that has hitherto never been explained, to the various bodies
of our systems. This is the original nebular theory, an <EM>incomplete
</EM>yet faithful repetition -- a short chapter out of the large
volume of universal <EM>esoteric </EM>cosmogony -- of the teachings
in the Secret Doctrine. And both systems, Kant's and Laplace's,
differ greatly from the modern theory, redundant with conflicting
<EM>sub</EM>-theories and fanciful hypotheses.

&quot;<EM>The essence of cometary matter and of that which composes
the stars is totally different from any of the chemical or physical
characteristics</EM> <EM>with which Western Science is now acquainted.
</EM>While the spectroscope has shown the probable similarity
(owing <EM>to the chemical action of terrestrial light </EM>upon
the intercepted rays) of earthly and sidereal substance, the chemical
actions, peculiar to the variously progressed orbs of space, have
not been detected, nor proven to be identical with those observed
on our own planet&quot; -- say the Teachers (<EM>op. cit.</EM>)<EM>.

his lecture, &quot;<EM>Elements and Meta-Elements.</EM>&quot;

&quot;At the utmost,&quot; observes C. Wolf,* &quot;could the
nebular hypothesis show in its favour, with W. Herschell, the
existence of planetary nebulae in various degrees of condensation,
and of spiral nebulae, with nuclei of condensation on the branches
and centre.** But, in fact, the knowledge of the bond that unites
the nebulae to the stars is yet denied to us; and lacking as we
do direct observation, we are even debarred from establishing
it even on the analogy of chemical composition.&quot;

difficulty arising for them out of such undeniable variety and
heterogeneity of matter in the constitution of nebulae, did admit,
with the ancients, that the origin of all the visible and invisible
heavenly bodies must be sought for in one primordial homogeneous
world-stuff, in a kind of PRE-<EM>protyle</EM>,* -- it is evident
that this would not put an end to their perplexities. Unless they
admit also that our actual visible Universe is merely the <EM>Sthula</EM>-<EM>Sharira</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the gross body, of the sevenfold Kosmos, they will have to
face another problem; especially if they risk maintaining that
its now visible bodies are the result of the condensation of that
one and single primordial matter. For mere observation shows them
that the actions which produced the actual Universe are far more
complex than could ever be embraced in that theory.
<P>
First of all, there are two distinct classes of <EM>irresolvable</EM>
nebulae, -- as Science itself teaches.
<P>
The telescope is unable to distinguish between the two, but the
spectroscope can, and notices, therefore, an essential difference
between their physical constitutions.**
<P>
&quot;Some of these,&quot; Wolf tells us, &quot;have a spectrum
of three or four bright lines, others a continuous spectrum. The
first are gaseous, the others formed of a pulverulent matter.
The former must constitute a veritable atmosphere: it is among
these that the solar nebula of Laplace has to be placed. The latter
form an <EM>ensemble </EM>of particles that may be considered
as independent, and the rotation of which obeys the laws of

<P>
* Mr. Crookes' &quot;Protyle&quot; must not be regarded as the
<EM>primary</EM> stuff, out of which the Dhyan Chohans, in accordance
with the immutable laws of nature, wove our solar system. This
<EM>protyle</EM> cannot even be the first <EM>prima</EM>-<EM>materia
</EM>of Kant, which that great mind saw used up in the formation
of the worlds, and thus existing no longer in a diffused state.
It is a MEDIATE phase in the progressive differentiation of cosmic
substance from its normal undifferentiated state. <EM>Protyle
</EM>is then the aspect assumed by matter in its middle passage
into full objectivity.
<P>
** &quot;The question of the resolvability of the nebulae has
been often presented in too affirmative a manner and quite contrary
to the ideas expressed by the illustrious experimenter with the
spectra of these constellations -- Mr. Huggins. Every nebula whose
spectrum contains only bright lines is gaseous, it is said, and
hence is irresolvable; every nebula with a continuous spectrum
must end by resolving into stars with an instrument of sufficient
power. This assumption is contrary at once to the results obtained,
and to spectroscopic theory. The <EM>Lyra</EM> nebula, the <EM>Dumb</EM>-<EM>bell</EM>
nebula, the central region of the nebula of Orion, appear resolvable,
and show a spectrum of bright lines; the nebula of <EM>Canis Venatici
</EM>is not resolvable, and gives a continuous spectrum. Because,
indeed, the spectroscope informs us of the physical state of the
constituent matter of the stars, but affords us no notions of
their modes of aggregation. A nebula formed of gaseous globes
(or even of nuclei, faintly luminous, surrounded by a powerful
atmosphere) would give a spectrum of lines and be still resolvable;
such seems to be the state of Huggins' region in the Orion nebula.
A nebula formed of solid or fluidic particles in a state of incandescence,
a true cloud, will give a continuous spectrum but will be <EM>irresolvable.</EM>&quot;<EM>

internal weight: such are the nebulae adopted by Kant and Faye.
Observation allows us to place the one as the other at the very
origin of the planetary world. But when we try to go beyond and
ascend to the primitive chaos which has produced the totality
of the heavenly bodies, we have first to account for the actual
existence of these two classes of nebulae. If the primitive chaos
were <EM>a cold luminous gas</EM>,*<EM> </EM>one could understand
how the contraction resulting from attraction could have heated
it and made it luminous. We have to explain the condensation of
this gas to the state of incandescent particles, the presence
of which is revealed to us in certain nebulae by the spectroscope.
If the original chaos was composed of such particles, how did
certain of their portions pass into the gaseous state, while others
have preserved their primitive condition? . . . .&quot;
<P>
Such is the synopsis of the objections and difficulties to the
acceptance of the nebular theory brought forward by the French
<EM>savant</EM>,<EM> </EM>who concludes his interesting chapter
by declaring that: --
<P>
&quot;The first part of the Cosmogonical problem, -- what is the
primitive matter of chaos; and how did that matter give birth
to the sun and stars? -- thus remains to this day in THE DOMAIN
OF ROMANCE AND OF MERE IMAGINATION.&quot;**
<P>
If this is the last word of Science upon that subject, whither
then should one turn in order to learn what the nebular theory
is supposed to teach? What, in fact, is this theory? What it <EM>is</EM>,<EM>
</EM>no one seems to know for a certainty. What it <EM>is not
</EM>--<EM> </EM>we learn from the erudite author of the &quot;World-Life.&quot;
He tells us that: --
<P>
(I.) It &quot;<EM>is not a theory of the evolution </EM>of the
Universe . . . but only and primarily a genetic explanation of
the phenomena of the solar system, and accessorily a co-ordination
of the principal phenomena in the stellar and nebular firmament,
<EM>as far as human vision has been able to penetrate.</EM>&quot;
<P>
(II.) &quot;That it does not regard the Comets as involved in
that particular evolution which has produced the solar system.&quot;
(<EM>Esoteric doctrine does.</EM>)<EM> </EM>
<P>
(It does, because it, too, recognises the comets as forms of cosmic
existence<EM> co</EM>-<EM>ordinated with earlier stages of nebular
evolution; </EM>and it actually assigns <EM>to them chiefly </EM>the
formation of all worlds.)
<P>
(III.) &quot;<EM>That it does not deny an antecedent history of
the luminous fire mist</EM>&quot; -- (the<EM> secondary </EM>stage
of evolution in the Secret Doctrine) . . . . &quot;and makes no
claim to having reached an absolute beginning.&quot; And even

<P>
(IV.) &quot;And that finally: it does not profess to discover
the ORIGIN of things, <EM>but only a stadium in material history</EM>&quot;
. . . . leaving &quot;the philosopher and theologian as free as
they ever were to seek for the origin of the modes of being.&quot;*
<P>
But this is not all. Even the greatest philosopher of England
-- Mr. Herbert Spencer -- arrayed himself against the fantastic
theory by saying that (<EM>a</EM>) &quot;The problem of existence
is not resolved&quot; by it; (<EM>b</EM>)<EM> </EM>the nebular
hypothesis &quot;throws no light upon the origin of diffused matter,&quot;
and (<EM>c</EM>) that &quot;the nebular hypothesis (as it now
stands) implies a First Cause.&quot;**
<P>
The latter, we are afraid, is more than our modern physicists
have bargained for. Thus, it seems that the poor &quot;hypothesis&quot;
can hardly expect to find help or corroboration even in the world
of the metaphysicians.
<P>
Considering all this, the Occultists believe they have a right
to present <EM>their</EM> philosophy, however misunderstood and
ostracised it may be at present. And they maintain that this failure
of the scientists to discover the truth is entirely due to their
materialism and contempt for transcendental sciences. Yet although
the scientific minds in our century are as far from the true and
correct doctrine of Evolution as ever, there may be still some
hope left for the future, as we find another great scientist giving
us a faint glimmer of it.
<P>
In an article in <EM>Popular Science Review </EM>(Vol. <B>XIV</B>.,
p. 252) on &quot;Recent Researches in Minute Life,&quot; we find
Mr. H. J. Slack, F.C.S., Sec. R.M.S., saying: &quot;There is an
evident convergence of all sciences, from physics to chemistry
and physiology, toward <EM>some </EM>doctrine of evolution and
development, of which the facts of Darwinism <EM>will form part</EM>,<EM>
</EM>but what ultimate aspect this doctrine will take, there is
little, if any, evidence to show, and <EM>perhaps it will not
be shaped by the human mind until metaphysical as well as physical
inquiries are much more advanced.</EM>&quot;
<P>
This is a happy forecast indeed. The day <EM>may </EM>come, then,
when the &quot;Natural Selection,&quot; as taught by Mr. Darwin
and Mr. Herbert Spencer, will form only <EM>a part</EM>,<EM> </EM>in
its ultimate modification, of our Eastern doctrine of Evolution,
which will be Manu and Kapila <EM>esoterically explained.</EM>
