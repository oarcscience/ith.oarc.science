<H4>&#167; XII.<BR>
THE THEOGONY OF THE CREATIVE GODS.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>O thoroughly comprehend the idea underlying
every ancient cosmology necessitates the study, in a comparative
analysis, of all the great religions of antiquity; as it is only
by this method that the root idea will be made plain. Exact science
-- could the latter soar so high, while tracing the operations
of nature to their ultimate and original sources -- would call
this idea the hierarchy of Forces. The original, transcendental
and philosophical conception was one. But as systems began to
reflect with every age more and more the idiosyncracies of nations;
and as the latter, after separating, settled into distinct groups,
each evolving along its own national or tribal groove, the main
idea gradually became veiled with the overgrowth of human fancy.
While in some countries the <STRONG>F</STRONG>ORCES, or rather
the intelligent Powers of nature, received divine honours they
were hardly entitled to, in others -- as now in Europe and the
<EM>civilized </EM>lands -- the very thought of any such Force
being endowed with intelligence seems absurd, and is proclaimed
<EM>unscientific. </EM>Therefore one finds relief in such statements
as are found in the <EM>Introduction </EM>to &quot;Asgard and
the Gods: Tales and Traditions of our Northern Ancestors,&quot;
by W. S. W. Anson. The author remarks, on p. 3: &quot;Although
in Central Asia, or on the banks of the Indus, in the land of
the Pyramids, and in the Greek and Italian peninsulas, and even
in the North, whither Kelts, Teutons and Slavs wandered, the religious
conceptions of the people have taken different forms, <EM>yet
their common origin </EM>is still perceptible. We point out this
connection between the stories of the gods, and the deep thought
contained in them, and their importance, in order that the reader
may see that <EM>it is not a magic world of erratic fancy </EM>which
opens out before him, but that . . . <EM>Life and nature </EM>formed
the basis of the existence and action of these divinities.&quot;
And though it is impossible for any Occultist or student of Eastern
Esotericism to concur in the strange idea that &quot;the religious
con-<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 425 MYTH IS ORAL TRADITION.</H6>

<P>
ceptions of the most famous nations of antiquity are connected
with the beginnings of civilization amongst the Germanic races,&quot;
he is yet glad to find such truths expressed as that: &quot;These
fairy tales are not senseless stories written for the amusement
of the idle; they embody the profound religion of our forefathers
. . . &quot;
<P>
Precisely so. Not only their religion, but likewise their History.
For a myth, in Greek [[<EM>mythos</EM>]], means oral tradition,
passed from mouth to mouth from one generation to the other; and
even in the modern etymology the term stands for a <EM>fabulous
</EM>statement conveying some important truth; a tale of some
extraordinary personage whose biography has become overgrown,
owing to the veneration of successive generations, with rich popular
fancy, but which is no <EM>wholesale </EM>fable. Like our ancestors,
the primitive Aryans, we believe firmly in the personality and
intelligence of more than one phenomenon-producing Force in nature.
<P>
As time rolled on, the archaic teaching grew dimmer; and those
nations more or less lost sight of the highest and One principle
of all things, and began to transfer the abstract attributes of
the &quot;causeless cause&quot; to the caused effects -- become
in their turn causative -- the creative Powers of the Universe:
the great nations, out of the fear of profaning the IDEA, the
smaller, because they either failed to grasp it or lacked the
power of philosophic conception needed to preserve it in all its
immaculate purity. But one and all, with the exception of the
latest Aryans, now become Europeans and Christians, show this
veneration in their Cosmogonies. As Thomas Taylor,* the most intuitional
of all the translators of Greek Fragments, shows, no nation has
ever conceived the One principle as the immediate creator of the
visible Universe, for no sane man would credit a planner and architect
with having built the edifice he admires with his own hands. On
the testimony of Damascius ([[Peri<EM> </EM>archon]]) they referred
to it as &quot;the Unknown <STRONG>D</STRONG>ARKNESS.&quot; The
Babylonians passed over this principle in silence: &quot;To that
god,&quot; says Porphyry, in [[<EM>Peri apoches empsuchon</EM>]],<EM>
</EM>&quot;who is above all things, neither external speech ought
to be addressed, nor yet that which is inward. . . . .&quot; Hesiod
begins his theogony with: &quot;Chaos of all things was the first
produced,&quot;** thus allowing the inference that its cause or
producer must be passed over in reverential silence. Homer in
his poems ascends no higher than <EM>Night</EM>,<EM> </EM>whom
he represents Zeus as reverencing. According to all the ancient
theologists, and to the doctrines of Pythagoras and Plato, Zeus,
or the

<P>
immediate artificer of the universe, <EM>is not the highest god;
</EM>any more than Sir Christopher Wren in his physical, human
aspect is the MIND in him which produced his great works of art.
Homer, therefore, is not only silent with respect to the first
principle, but likewise with respect to those two principles immediately
posterior to the first, the <EM>AEther </EM>and<EM> Chaos </EM>of
Orpheus and Hesiod, and the <EM>bound </EM>and infinity of Pythagoras
and Plato.* . . . . Proclus says of this highest principle that
it is. . . . &quot;the Unity of Unities, and beyond the first
adyte. . . . . more ineffable than all silence, and more occult
than all Essence. . . . . concealed amidst the intelligible gods.&quot;
(<EM>Ibid.</EM>)
<P>
To what was written by Thomas Taylor in 1797 -- namely, that the
&quot;Jews appear to have ascended no higher. . . . than the <EM>immediate
</EM>artificer of the universe&quot;; as &quot;Moses introduces
a darkness on the face of the deep, without even insinuating that
there was any cause of its existence,&quot;** one might add something
more. Never have the Jews in their Bible (a purely esoteric, symbolical
work) degraded so profoundly their metaphorical deity as have
the Christians, by accepting Jehovah as their one living yet <EM>personal
</EM>God<EM>.</EM> 
<P>
This first, or rather ONE, principle was called &quot;the circle
of Heaven,&quot; symbolized by the hierogram of a point within
a circle or equilateral triangle, the point being the LOGOS. Thus,
in the Rig Veda, wherein Brahma is not even named, Cosmogony is
preluded with the <EM>Hiranyagharha</EM>,<EM> </EM>&quot;the Golden
Egg,&quot; and Prajapati (Brahma later on), from whom emanate
all the hierarchies of &quot;Creators.&quot; The Monad, or point,
is the original and is the unit from which follows the entire
numeral system. This Point is the First Cause, but THAT from which
it emanates, or of which, rather, it is the expression, the Logos,
is passed over in silence. In its turn, the universal symbol,
the <EM>point within the circle</EM>,<EM> </EM>was not yet the
Architect, but the cause of that Architect; and the latter stood
to it in precisely the same relation as the point itself stood
to the<EM> circumference </EM>of the Circle, which cannot be defined,
according to Hermes Trismegistus. Porphyry shows that the Monad
and the Duad of Pythagoras are identical with Plato's <EM>infinite
</EM>and<EM> finite </EM>in &quot;Philebus&quot; -- or what Plato
calls the [[<EM>apeiron</EM>]] and [[<EM>peras</EM>]]. It is the
latter only (the mother) which is substantial, the former being
the &quot;<EM>cause of all unity and measure of all things</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Vit. Pyth. p. </EM>47); the Duad (Mulaprakriti, the
<STRONG>V</STRONG>EIL) being thus shown to be the mother of the
Logos and, at the same time, his <EM>daughter</EM> --<EM> i.e.</EM>,
the object of his perception -- the produced

with the Brahman Yogis, who claim in their mystical visions to
see the &quot;Highest One.&quot;

producer and the secondary cause of it. With Pythagoras, the MONAD
returns into silence and Darkness as soon as it has evolved the
<EM>triad</EM>,<EM> </EM>from which emanate the remaining seven
numbers of the 10 (ten) numbers which are at the base of the manifested
universe.
<P>
In the Norse cosmogony it is again the same. &quot;In the beginning
was a great abyss (Chaos), neither day nor night existed; the
abyss was Ginnungagap, the yawning gulf, without beginning, without
end. <STRONG>A</STRONG>LL <STRONG>F</STRONG>ATHER, the Uncreated,
the Unseen, dwelt in the depth of the 'Abyss' (<STRONG>S</STRONG>PACE)
and <EM>willed</EM>,<EM> </EM>and what was willed came into being.&quot;
(See<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Asgard and the Gods.</EM>&quot;)<EM> </EM>As
in the Hindu cosmogony, the evolution of the universe is divided
into two acts: called in India the <EM>Prakriti </EM>and<EM> Padma
</EM>Creations. Before the warm rays pouring from the &quot;Home
of Brightness&quot; awake life in the Great Waters of Space, the
Elements of the first creation come into view, and from them is
formed the Giant Ymir (also Orgelmir) -- primordial matter differentiated
from Chaos (literally <EM>seething clay</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Then comes
the cow Audumla, the nourisher,* from whom is born Buri (the Producer)
who, by Bestla, the daughter of the &quot;Frost-Giants&quot; (the
sons of Ymir) had three sons, <EM>Odin</EM>,<EM> Willi </EM>and<EM>
We</EM>,<EM> </EM>or &quot;Spirit,&quot; &quot;Will,&quot; and
&quot;Holiness.&quot; (<EM>Compare the Genesis of the Primordial
Races</EM>,<EM> in this work.</EM>)<EM> </EM>This was when Darkness
still reigned throughout Space, when the <EM>Ases</EM>,<EM> </EM>the
creative Powers (Dhyan Chohans) were not yet evolved, and the
Yggdrasil, the <EM>tree </EM>of the universe of Time and of Life,
had not yet grown, and there was, as yet, no Walhalla, or Hall
of Heroes. The Scandinavian legends of creation, of our earth
and world, begin with <EM>time </EM>and human life. All that precedes
it is for them &quot;Darkness,&quot; wherein All-Father, the cause
of all, dwells. As observed by the editor of &quot;Asgard and
the Gods,&quot; though these legends have in them the idea of
that <STRONG>A</STRONG>LL-<STRONG>F</STRONG>ATHER, the original
cause of all, &quot;he is scarcely more than mentioned in the
poems,&quot; not because, as he thinks, before the preaching of
the gospel, the idea &quot;could not rise to distinct conceptions
of the Eternal,&quot; but on account of its great esoteric character.
Therefore, all the creative gods, or <EM>personal </EM>Deities,
begin at the secondary stage of Cosmic evolution. Zeus is born
<EM>in</EM>, and<EM> out </EM>of<EM> Kronos</EM> --<EM> </EM>Time.
So is Brahma the production and emanation of <EM>Kala</EM>,<EM>
</EM>&quot;eternity and time,&quot; Kala being one of the names
of Vishnu. Hence we find Odin, the father <EM>of the gods and
of the Ases</EM>,<EM> </EM>as Brahma is the father of <EM>the
gods and of the Asuras</EM>,<EM> </EM>and hence also the androgyne
character of all the chief creative gods, from the second <STRONG>M</STRONG>ONAD
of the Greeks down to the Sephiroth Adam Kadmon, the Brahma or
Prajapati-Vach of the Vedas, and the androgyne of Plato, which
is but another version of the Indian symbol.

<P>
The best metaphysical definition of primeval theogony in the spirit
of the Vedantins may be found in the &quot;Notes on the Bhagavat-Gita,&quot;
by Mr. T. Subba Row. (<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Theosophist</EM>&quot;<EM>
for February</EM>,<EM> </EM>1887.) Parabrahmam, the unknown and
the incognisable, as the lecturer tells his audience:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;. . . . . Is not Ego, it is not non-ego, nor is it consciousness
. . . . . it is not even <I>Atma</I>&quot; . . . . . &quot;but
though not itself an object of knowledge, it is yet capable of
supporting and giving rise to every kind of object and every kind
of existence which becomes an object of knowledge. It is the one
essence from which starts into existence a centre of energy .
. . . .&quot; which he calls <I>Logos.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This Logos is the <EM>Sabda Brahmam </EM>of the Hindus, which
he will not even call <EM>Eswara </EM>(the &quot;lord&quot; God),
lest the term should create confusion in the people's minds. But
it is the <EM>Avalokiteswara </EM>of the Hindus, the <EM>Verbum
</EM>of the Christians in its real <EM>esoteric </EM>meaning,
not in the theological disfigurement.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;It is,&quot; he says, &quot;the <I>Gnatha </I>or the Ego
in the Kosmos, and every other Ego . . . . . . is but its reflection
and manifestation. . . . . . It exists in a latent condition in
the bosom of Parabrahmam at the time of <I>Pralaya. . </I>. .&quot;
(During Manvantara) &quot;it has a consciousness and an individuality
of its own . . . . .&quot; (It is a centre of energy, but) . .
. . . such centres of energy are almost innumerable in the bosom
of Parabrahmam . . . . .&quot; &quot;It must not be supposed,
that even the logos is <I>the</I> Creator, or that it is but a
single centre of energy . . . . . . their number is almost infinite.&quot;
&quot;This Ego,&quot; he adds, &quot;is the first that appears
in Kosmos, and is the end of all evolution. It is the abstract
Ego&quot; . . . . . &quot;this is the <I>first </I>manifestation
(or aspect) of Parabrahmam.&quot; &quot;When once it starts into
conscious being . . . . . . from its objective standpoint, <I>Parabrahmam
</I>appears to it as <I>Mulaprakriti.</I>&quot;<I> </I>&quot;Please
bear this in mind,&quot; observes the lecturer, &quot;for here
is the root of the whole difficulty about <I>Purusha </I>and<I>
Prakriti </I>felt by the various writers on Vedantic philosophy.
This <I>Mulaprakriti </I>is material to it (the Logos), as any
material object is material to us. This <I>Mulaprakriti </I>is
no more <I>Parabrahmam </I>than the bundle of attributes of a
pillar is the pillar itself; Parabrahmam is an unconditioned and
absolute reality, and Mulaprakriti is a sort of veil thrown over
it. Parabrahmam by itself cannot be seen as it is. It is seen
by the <I>Logos </I>with a veil thrown over it, and that veil
is the mighty expanse of Cosmic matter. . . .&quot; &quot;Parabrahmam,
after having appeared on the one hand as the Ego, and on the other
as Mulaprakriti, acts as the one energy through the <I>Logos</I>.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And the lecturer explains what he means by this acting of something
which is <EM>nothing</EM>,<EM> </EM>though it is the ALL, by a
fine simile. He compares the Logos to the sun through which light
and heat radiate, but whose energy, light and heat, exist in some
unknown condition in Space and are diffused in Space only as <EM>visible
</EM>light and heat, the sun being only the agent thereof. This
is the first triadic hypostasis. The quaternary is made up by
the <EM>energizing light </EM>shed by the Logos.
<P>
The Hebrew Kabalists give it in a shape which esoterically is
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 429 THE ONE IS KNOWN BY THE MANY.</H6>

<P>
identical with the Vedantic. <STRONG>A</STRONG>IN-<STRONG>S</STRONG>OPH,
they taught, could not be comprehended, could not be located,
nor named, though the causeless cause of all. Hence its name --
<STRONG>A</STRONG>IN-<STRONG>S</STRONG>OPH -- is a term of negation,
&quot;the inscrutable, the incognizable, and the unnameable.&quot;
They made of it, therefore, a boundless circle, a sphere, of which
human intellect, with the utmost stretch, could only perceive
the vault. In the words of one who has unriddled much in the Kabalistical
system, in one of its meanings thoroughly, in its numerical and
geometrical esotericism: -- &quot;Close your eyes, and from your
own consciousness of perception try and think outward to the extremest
limits in every direction. You will find that equal lines or rays
of perception extend out evenly in all directions, so that the
utmost effort of perception will terminate in the <EM>vault of
a sphere. </EM>The limitation of this sphere will, of necessity,
be a great <EM>Circle</EM>,<EM> </EM>and the direct rays of thought
in any and every direction must be <EM>right line radii </EM>of
the circle. This, then, <EM>must </EM>be, humanly speaking, the
extremest all-embracing conception of the Ain-Soph <EM>manifest</EM>,<EM>
</EM>which formulates itself as a <EM>geometrical figure</EM>,<EM>
</EM>viz., of a circle, with its elements of curved circumference
and right line diameter divided into radii. Hence, a geometrical
shape is the first recognisable means of connection between the
Ain-Soph and the intelligence of man.&quot;*
<P>
This great circle (which Eastern Esotericism reduces to the point
within the Boundless Circle) is the Avalokiteswara, the <EM>Logos
</EM>or<EM> Verbum </EM>of which Mr. Subba Row speaks. But this
circle or manifested God is as unknown to us, except through its
<EM>manifested </EM>universe, as the ONE, though easier, or rather
more possible to our highest conceptions. This Logos which sleeps
in the bosom of Parabrahmam during Pralaya, as our &quot;<EM>Ego
</EM>is latent (in us) at the time <EM>of sushupti</EM>,<EM> </EM>sleep&quot;;
which cannot cognize Parabrahmam otherwise than as <EM>Mulaprakriti</EM>
--<EM> </EM>the latter being a cosmic veil which is &quot;the
mighty expanse of cosmic matter&quot; -- is thus only an organ
in cosmic creation, through which radiate the energy and wisdom
of Parabrahmam, <EM>unknown to the Logos</EM>,<EM> as it is to
ourselves. </EM>Moreover, as the Logos is as unknown to us as
Parabrahmam is unknown in reality to the Logos, both Eastern Esotericism
and the Kabala -- in order to bring the Logos within the range
of our conceptions -- have resolved the abstract synthesis into
concrete images; viz., into the reflections or multiplied aspects
of that Logos or Avalokiteswara, Brahma, Ormazd, Osiris, Adam-Kadmon,
call it by any of these names -- which aspects or Manvantaric
emanations are the Dhyan Chohans, the Elohim, the Devas, the Amshaspends,
&amp;c., &amp;c. Metaphysicians explain the root and germ of the
latter, according to Mr. Subba Row, as the first manifestation
of Parabrahmam, &quot;the highest trinity that we

are capable of understanding,&quot; which is <EM>Mulaprakriti
</EM>(the veil), the <EM>Logos</EM>,<EM> </EM>and the conscious
energy &quot;of the latter,&quot; or its power and light*; or
-- &quot;matter, force and the <EM>Ego</EM>,<EM> </EM>or the one
root of self, of which every other kind of self is but a manifestation
or a reflection.&quot; It is then only in this &quot;light&quot;
(of consciousness) of mental and physical perception, that <EM>practical
</EM>Occultism can throw this into visibility by geometrical figures;
which, when closely studied, will yield not only a scientific
explanation of the real, objective, existence** of the &quot;Seven
sons of the divine Sophia,&quot; which is this light of the Logos,
but show by means of other yet undiscovered keys that, with regard
to Humanity, these &quot;Seven Sons&quot; and their numberless
emanations, centres of energy personified, are an absolute necessity.
Make away with them, and the mystery of Being and Mankind <EM>will
never be unriddled</EM>,<EM> not even closely approached.</EM>

<P>
It is through <EM>this light </EM>that everything is created.
This ROOT of mental SELF is also the root of physical <EM>Self</EM>,
for this light is the permutation, in our manifested world, of
Mulaprakriti, called <EM>Aditi </EM>in the Vedas. In its third
aspect it becomes <EM>Vach</EM>,*** the daughter and the mother
of the Logos, as Isis is the daughter and the mother of Osiris,
who is Horus; and<EM> Mout</EM>,<EM> </EM>the daughter, wife,
and mother of Ammon, in the Egyptian Moon-glyph. In the Kabala,
Sephira is the same as Shekinah, and is, in another synthesis,
the wife, daughter, and mother of the &quot;Heavenly man,&quot;
Adam Kadmon, and is even identical with him, just as Vach is identical
with Brahma, and is called the female Logos. In the Rig-Veda,
Vach is &quot;mystic speech,&quot; by whom Occult Knowledge and
Wisdom are communicated to man, and thus Vach is said to have
&quot;entered the Rishis.&quot; She is &quot;generated by the
gods;&quot; she is the <EM>divine </EM>Vach -- the &quot;Queen
of gods&quot;; and she is associated -- like Sephira with the
Sephiroth -- with the Prajapati in their work of creation. Moreover,
she is called &quot;the mother of the Vedas,&quot; &quot;since
it is through her power (as mystic <EM>speech</EM>)<EM> </EM>that
Brahma revealed them, and also owing to her power that he produced
the universe&quot; -- <EM>i.e.</EM>, through speech, and <EM>words
</EM>(synthesized by the &quot;WORD&quot;) and numbers.****
<P>
But Vach being also spoken of as the daughter of Daksha -- &quot;the
god who lives in all the Kalpas&quot; -- her Mayavic character
is thereby shown:

<P>
during the <EM>pralaya </EM>she disappears, absorbed in the one,
all-devouring Ray.
<P>
But there are two distinct aspects in universal Esotericism, Eastern
and Western, in all those personations of the <EM>female </EM>Power
in nature, or nature -- the<EM> noumenal </EM>and the <EM>phenomenal.
</EM>One is its purely metaphysical aspect, as described by the
learned lecturer in his &quot;Notes on the Bhagavat-Gita;&quot;
the other terrestrial and physical, and at the same time <EM>divine
</EM>from the stand-point of practical human conception and Occultism.
They are all the symbols and personifications of <EM>Chaos</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the &quot;Great Deep&quot; or the Primordial Waters of Space,
the impenetrable VEIL between the INCOGNISABLE and the <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS
of Creation. &quot;Connecting himself through his mind with Vach,
Brahma (the Logos) created the primordial waters.&quot; In the
Kathaka Upanishad it is stated still more clearly: &quot;Prajapati
was this Universe. <EM>Vach was a second to him. </EM>He associated
with her . . . she produced these creatures and again re-entered
Prajapati.&quot;*
<P>
And here we may incidentally point out one of the many unjust
slurs thrown by the pious and <EM>good </EM>missionaries in India
on the religion of the land. This allegory -- in the &quot;Satapatha
Brahmana&quot; -- namely, that Brahma, as the father of men, performed
the work of procreation by incestuous intercourse with his own
daughter Vach, also called Sandhya (twilight), and <EM>Satarupa
</EM>(the hundred formed), is incessantly thrown into the teeth
of the Brahmins, as condemning their &quot;detestable, <EM>false
</EM>religion.&quot; Besides the fact, conveniently forgotten
by the Europeans, that the Patriarch Lot is shown guilty of the
same crime under the <EM>human form</EM>,<EM> </EM>whereas Brahma,
or rather Prajapati, accomplished the incest under the form of
a buck with his daughter, who had that of a hind (<EM>rohit</EM>),<EM>
</EM>the esoteric reading of Genesis (<EM>ch. iii.</EM>)<EM> </EM>shows
the same. Moreover, there is certainly a <EM>cosmic</EM>,<EM>
</EM>not a physiological meaning attached to the Indian allegory,
since Vach is a permutation of Aditi and Mulaprakriti (Chaos),
and Brahma a permutation of Narayana, the Spirit of God entering
into, and fructifying nature; therefore, there is nothing <EM>phallic
</EM>in the conception at all.
<P>
As already stated, Aditi-Vach is the female <EM>Logos</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or the &quot;word,&quot; <EM>Verbum; </EM>and Sephira in
the Kabala is the same. These feminine Logoi are all correlations,
in their <EM>noumenal </EM>aspect, of Light, and Sound, and Ether,
showing how well-informed were the ancients both in

* This connects Vach and Sephira with the goddess Kwan-Yin, the
&quot;merciful mother,&quot; the <EM>divine </EM>VOICE<EM> of
the soul </EM>even in Exoteric Buddhism; and with the female aspect
of <EM>Kwan-Shai-yin</EM>,<EM> </EM>the Logos, the <EM>verbum

&quot;Our old writers said that <I>Vach </I>is of four kinds .
. . . <I>para</I>,<I> pasyanti</I>,<I> madhyama</I>,<I> vaikhari
</I>(a statement found in the Rig-Veda and the Upanishads) . .
. . Vaikhari Vach is what we utter.&quot; It is sound, <I>speech</I>,<I>
</I>that again which becomes comprehensive and objective to one
of our physical senses and may be brought under the laws of perception.
Hence: &quot;Every kind of <I>Vaikhari-Vach </I>exists in its<I>
Madhyama </I>. . . . <I>Pasyanti </I>and ultimately in its <I>Para
</I>form. . . . . The reason why this <I>Pranava* </I>is called
Vach is this, that these four principles of the great Kosmos correspond
to these four forms of Vach. . . . . The whole Kosmos in its objective
form is <I>Vaikhari </I>Vach; the light of the <I>Logos </I>is
the <I>madhyama </I>form; and the <I>Logos </I>itself the <I>pasyanti
</I>form; while Parabrahmam is the <I>para </I>(beyond the <I>noumenon
</I>of all <I>Noumena</I>)<I> </I>aspect of that Vach.&quot; (<I>Notes
on the Bhagavad-Gita</I>)<I>.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Thus Vach, Shekinah, or the &quot;music of the spheres&quot; of
Pythagoras, are one, if we take for our example instances in the
three most (apparently) dissimilar religious philosophies in the
world -- the Hindu, the Greek and the Chaldean Hebrew. These personations
and allegories may be viewed under <EM>four </EM>(chief) and three
(lesser) aspects or <EM>seven </EM>in all, as in Esotericism.
The <EM>para </EM>form is the ever subjective and latent Light
and Sound, which exist eternally in the bosom of the INCOGNISABLE;
when transferred into the ideation of the Logos, or its latent
<EM>light</EM>,<EM> </EM>it is called <EM>pasyanti</EM>,<EM> </EM>and
when it becomes that light <EM>expressed</EM>,<EM> </EM>it is
<EM>madhyama.</EM> 
<P>
Now the Kabala gives the definition thus: &quot;There are three
kinds of light, and that (fourth) which interpenetrates the others;
(1) the clear and the penetrating, the <EM>objective light</EM>,<EM>
</EM>(2)<EM> </EM>the<EM> reflected </EM>light, and (3) the<EM>
abstract </EM>light. The ten Sephiroth, the <EM>three </EM>and
the Seven, are called in the Kabala the 10 words, <B>D-BRIM </B>(Dabarim),
the numbers and the Emanations of the heavenly light, which is
both Adam Kadmon and Sephira, or (Brahma) Prajapati-Vach. Light,
Sound, Number, are the three factors of creation in the Kabala.
Parabrahmam cannot be known except through the luminous Point
(the <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS), which knows not <EM>Parabrahmam
</EM>but only <EM>Mulaprakriti. </EM>Similarly Adam Kadmon knew
only Shekinah, though he was the <EM>vehicle </EM>of Ain-Soph.
And, as Adam Kadmon, he is in the esoteric interpretation the
total of the number ten, the Sephiroth (himself a trinity, or
the three attributes of the

<EM>incognisable </EM><STRONG>D</STRONG>EITY in One).* &quot;When
the Heavenly man (or <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS) first assumed the
form of the Crown** (Kether) and identified himself with Sephira,
he caused seven splendid lights to emanate from it (the Crown),&quot;
which made in their totality ten; so the Brahma-Prajapati, once
he became separated from, yet identical with Vach, caused the
seven Rishis, the seven Manus or Prajapatis to issue from that
crown. In Exotericism one will always find 10 and 7, of either
Sephiroth or Prajapati; in <EM>Esoteric </EM>rendering always
3 and 7, which yield also 10. Only when divided in the manifested
sphere into 3 and 7, they form <IMG SRC="sd1-5f.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">,
the androgyne, and <IMG SRC="sd1-5d.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">, or the

<P>
This will help the student to understand why Pythagoras esteemed
the Deity (the Logos) to be the <EM>centre of unity </EM>and &quot;Source
of Harmony.&quot; We say this Deity was the <EM>Logos</EM>,<EM>
</EM>not the MONAD that dwelleth in Solitude and Silence, because
Pythagoras taught that UNITY being indivisible is <EM>no number.
</EM>And this is also why it was required of the candidate, who
applied for admittance into his school, that he should have already
studied as a preliminary step, the Sciences of Arithmetic, Astronomy,
Geometry and <EM>Music</EM>,<EM> </EM>held as the four divisions
of Mathematics.*** Again, this explains why the Pythagoreans asserted
that the doctrine of Numbers -- the chief of all in Esotericism
-- had been revealed to man by the celestial deities; that the
world had been called forth out of Chaos by Sound or Harmony,
and constructed according to the principles of musical proportion;
that the seven planets which rule the destiny of mortals have
a harmonious motion &quot;and intervals corresponding to musical
diastemes, rendering various sounds, so perfectly consonant, that
they produce the sweetest melody, which is inaudible to us, only
by reason of the greatness of the sound, which our ears are incapable
of receiving.&quot; (<EM>Censorinus.</EM>)
<P>
In the Pythagorean Theogony the hierarchies of the heavenly Host
and Gods were numbered and expressed numerically. Pythagoras had
studied Esoteric Science in India; therefore we find his pupils
saying &quot;The monad (the manifested one) is the principle of
all things. From the Monad and the indeterminate duad (Chaos),
numbers; from

issued Mulaprakriti, Purusha (the Logos), and Prakriti: the four
forms (with itself, the synthesis) of Vach. And in the Kabala
-- Ain-Soph, Shekinah, Adam Kadmon and Sephirah, the four -- or
the three emanations being distinct -- yet ONE.

Vit. Pythag.</EM>)
<P>
And this may also, if it does not unriddle the mystery altogether,
at any rate lift a corner of the veil off those wondrous allegories
that have been thrown upon Vach, the most mysterious of all the
Brahmanical goddesses, she who is termed &quot;the <EM>melodious
</EM>cow who milked forth sustenance and water&quot; (the Earth
with all her mystic powers); and again she &quot;who yields us
nourishment and sustenance&quot; (physical Earth). <EM>Isis </EM>is
also mystic Nature and also Earth; and her cow's horns identify
her with Vach. The latter, after having been recognised in her
highest form as <EM>para</EM>,<EM> </EM>becomes at the lower or
material end of creation -- <EM>Vaikhari. </EM>Hence she is mystic,
though physical, Nature, with all her magic ways and properties.
<P>
Again, as goddess of Speech and of Sound, and a permutation of
Aditi -- she is <EM>Chaos</EM>,<EM> </EM>in one sense. At any
rate, she is the &quot;Mother of the gods,&quot; and it is from
Brahma (Iswara, or the Logos) and Vach, as from Adam Kadmon and
Sephira, that the real <EM>manifested </EM>theogony has to start.
Beyond, all is darkness and abstract speculation. With the Dhyan
Chohans, or the gods, the Seers, the Prophets and the adepts in
general are on firm ground. Whether as Aditi, or the <EM>divine</EM>
Sophia of the Greek Gnostics, she is the mother of the seven sons:
the &quot;Angels of the Face,&quot; of the &quot;Deep,&quot; or
the &quot;Great Green One&quot; of the &quot;Book of the Dead.&quot;

<P>
Commentary.* Thus we are taught that the great Pyramids were built
under their direct supervision, &quot;when <EM>Dhruva </EM>(the
then Pole-star) was at his lowest culmination, and the Krittika
(Pleiades) looked over his head (were on the same meridian but
above) to watch the work of the giants.&quot; Thus, as the first
Pyramids were built at the beginning of a Sidereal year, under
Dhruva (Alpha Polaris), it must have been over 31,000 years (31,105)
ago. Bunsen was right in admitting for Egypt an antiquity of over
21,000 years, but this concession hardly exhausts truth and fact
in this question. &quot;The stories told by Egyptian priests and
others of time-keeping in Egypt, are now beginning to look less
like lies in the sight of all who have escaped from biblical bondage,&quot;
writes the author of &quot;<EM>The Natural Genesis.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>&quot;Inscriptions have lately been found at Sakkarah, making
mention of two Sothiac cycles . . . registered at that time, now
some 6,000 years ago. Thus when Herodotus was in Egypt, the Egyptians
had -- as now known -- observed at least five different Sothiac
cycles of 1,461 years. The priests informed the Greek inquirer
that time had been reckoned by them for so long that the sun had
twice risen where it then set, and twice set where it then arose.
This . . . can only be realized as a fact in nature by means of
two cycles of Precession, or a period of 51,736 years,&quot; (vol.
ii, p. 318. But see in our Book II., &quot;<STRONG>C</STRONG>HRONOLOGY
OF THE <STRONG>B</STRONG>RAHMINS.&quot;)
<P>
Mor Isaac (<EM>See</EM> Kircher's<EM> OEdipus</EM>,<EM> vol. ii.</EM>,<EM>
p. </EM>425) shows the ancient Syrians defining their world of
the &quot;Rulers&quot; and &quot;active gods&quot; in the same
way as the Chaldeans. The lowest world was the <STRONG>S</STRONG>UBLUNARY
-- our own -- watched by the &quot;Angels&quot; of the first or
lower order; the one that came next in rank, was Mercury, ruled
by the &quot;<STRONG>A</STRONG>RCHANGELS&quot;; then came Venus,
whose gods were the <STRONG>P</STRONG>RINCIPALITIES; the fourth
was that of the <STRONG>S</STRONG>UN, the domain and region of
the highest and mightiest gods of our system, the solar gods of
all nations; the fifth was Mars, ruled by the &quot;<STRONG>V</STRONG>IRTUES&quot;;
the sixth -- that of <EM>Bel </EM>or Jupiter -- was governed by
the <STRONG>D</STRONG>OMINIONS; the seventh -- the world of Saturn
-- by the <STRONG>T</STRONG>HRONES. These are the worlds of form.
Above come the four higher ones, making seven again, since the
three <EM>highest </EM>are &quot;unmentionable and unpronounceable.&quot;
The eighth, composed of 1,122 stars, is the domain of the <EM>Cherubs;
</EM>the ninth, belonging to the <EM>walking </EM>and numberless
stars on account of their distance, has the seraphs; as to the
tenth -- Kircher, quoting Mor Isaac, says that it is composed
&quot;of invisible stars that could be taken, they said, for clouds

Milky Way&quot;; and he hastens to explain that &quot;these are
the stars of Lucifer, engulfed with him in his terrible shipwreck.&quot;
That which comes after and beyond the tenth world (our Quaternary,
or the <EM>Arupa </EM>world), the Syrians could not tell. &quot;All
they knew was that it is there that begins the vast and incomprehensible
ocean of the infinite, the abode of the true divinity without
boundary or end.&quot;
<P>
Champollion shows the same belief among the Egyptians. Hermes
having spoken of the Father-Mother and Son, whose spirit (collectively
the DIVINE FIAT) shapes the Universe, says: -- &quot;<EM>Seven
Agents </EM>(mediums) were also formed, to contain the material
(or manifested) worlds, within their respective <EM>circles </EM>and
the action of these agents was named DESTINY.&quot; He further
enumerates seven and ten and twelve orders, which would take too
long to detail here.
<P>
As the &quot;<EM>Rig Vidhana</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>together with
the &quot;<EM>Brahmanda Purana</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>and all such
works, whether describing the magic efficacy of the Rig-Vedic
<EM>Mantras </EM>or the future Kalpas, are declared by Dr. Weber
and others to be<EM> modern compilations </EM>&quot;belonging
probably only to the time of the Puranas,&quot; it is useless
to refer the reader to their mystic explanations; and one may
as well quote simply from the archaic books utterly unknown to
the Orientalists. These works explain that which so puzzles the
scholars, namely that the <EM>Saptarshi</EM>,<EM> </EM>the &quot;mind-born
sons&quot; of Brahma, are referred to in the <EM>Satapatha Brahmana
</EM>under one set of names; in the <EM>Mahabharata </EM>under
another set; and that the Vayu Purana makes even <EM>nine</EM>
instead of <EM>seven </EM>Rishis, by adding the names of Bhrigu
and Daksha to the list. But the same occurs in every exoteric
Scripture. The secret doctrine gives a long genealogy of Rishis,
but separates them into many classes. Like the Gods of the Egyptians,
who were divided into seven, and even twelve, classes, so are
the Indian Rishis in their Hierarchies. The first three groups
are the Divine, the Cosmical and the Sub-lunary. Then come the
Solar Gods of <EM>our </EM>system, the Planetary, the Sub-Mundane,
and the purely human -- the heroes and the<EM> Manoushi.</EM>

<P>
At present, however, we are only concerned with the <EM>pre</EM>-cosmic,
divine gods, the Prajapati or the &quot;Seven Builders.&quot;
This group is found unmistakably in every Cosmogony. Owing to
the loss of Egyptian archaic documents -- since, according to
M. Maspero, &quot;the materials and historical data on hand to
study the history of the religious evolution in Egypt are neither
complete nor very often intelligible&quot; -- in order to have
the statements brought forward from the Secret Doctrine corroborated
partially and indirectly, the ancient hymns and inscriptions on
the tombs must be appealed to. One such, at any rate, shows that
Osiris was, like Brahma-Prajapati, Adam Kadmon, Ormazd, and so
many other Logoi, the chief and synthesis of the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 437 COSMIC GODS.</H6>

<P>
group of &quot;Creators&quot; or Builders. Before Osiris became
the &quot;One&quot; and the <EM>highest </EM>god of Egypt he was
worshipped at Abydos as the head or leader of the Heavenly Host
of the Builders belonging to the higher of the three orders. The
hymn engraved on the votive stela of a tomb from Abydos (3rd register)
addresses Osiris thus: &quot;Salutations to thee, Osiris, elder
son of <EM>Sib</EM>;<EM> </EM>thou the greatest over the six gods
issued from the goddess <EM>Noo </EM>(primordial Water), thou
the great favourite of thy father <EM>Ra</EM>; father of fathers,
King of Duration, master in the eternity . . . who, as soon as
these issued from thy mother's bosom, gathered all the crowns
and attached the <EM>Uraeus </EM>(serpent or naja)* on thy head;
multiform god, <EM>whose name is unknown </EM>and who has many
names in towns and provinces. . .&quot; Coming out from the primordial
water crowned with the <EM>uraeus</EM>,<EM> </EM>which is the
serpent emblem of Cosmic fire, and himself the <EM>seventh </EM>over
the six primary gods issued from Father-Mother, <EM>Nou</EM> and
<EM>Nout </EM>(the sky), who can Osiris be, but the chief Prajapati,
the chief Sephiroth, the chief Amshaspend-Ormazd! That this latter
solar and cosmic god stood, in the beginning of religious evolution,
in the same position as the archangel &quot;whose name was secret,&quot;
is certain. This Archangel was the representative on earth of
the <EM>Hidden </EM>Jewish God, Michael, in short: it is his &quot;Face&quot;
that is said to have gone before the Jews like a &quot;Pillar
of Fire.&quot; Burnouf says, &quot;The seven Amshaspends, who
are most assuredly our archangels, designate also the personifications
of the divine Virtues.&quot; (<EM>Comment on the Yacna</EM>,<EM>
p. </EM>174.) And these archangels, therefore, are as &quot;certainly&quot;
the <EM>Saptarishi </EM>of the Hindus, though it is next to impossible
to class each with its pagan prototype and parallel, since, as
in the case of Osiris, they have all so &quot;many names in towns
and provinces.&quot; Some of the most important, however, will
be shown in their order.
<P>
One thing is thus undeniably proven. The more one studies their
Hierarchies and finds out their identity, the more proofs one
acquires that there is not one of the past and present <EM>personal
</EM>gods, known to us from the earliest days of History, that
does not belong to the third stage of Cosmic manifestation. In
every religion we find the concealed deity forming the ground
work; then the ray therefrom, that falls into primordial Cosmic
matter (first manifestation); then the androgyne result, the dual
Male and Female abstract Force, personified<EM> </EM>(<EM>second
</EM>stage)<EM> </EM>; this separates itself finally, in the <EM>third</EM>,<EM>
</EM>into seven Forces, called the creative Powers by all the
ancient Religions, and the

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 438 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
&quot;Virtues of God&quot; by the Christians. The later explanation
and metaphysical abstract qualifications have never prevented
the Roman and Greek Churches from worshipping these &quot;Virtues&quot;
under the personifications and distinct names of the seven Archangels.
In the Book of <EM>Druschim </EM>(<EM>p. </EM>59,<EM> </EM>1<EM>st
Treatise</EM>)<EM> </EM>in the Talmud, a distinction between these
groups is given which is the correct Kabalistical explanation.
It says:
<P>
&quot;There are three groups (or orders) of <EM>Sephiroth. </EM>1st.
The Sephiroth called &quot;the divine attributes&quot; (abstract).
2nd. The physical or <EM>sidereal </EM>Sephiroth (personal) --
one group of <EM>seven</EM>,<EM> </EM>the other of <EM>ten. </EM>3rd.
The metaphysical Sephiroth, or <EM>periphrasis of Jehovah</EM>,<EM>
</EM>who are the first three Sephiroth (Kether, Chochma and Binah),
the rest of the seven being the (personal) seven spirits of the
Presence&quot; (also of the planets).
<P>
The same division has to be applied to the primary, secondary
and tertiary evolution of gods in every theogony, if one wishes
to translate the meaning esoterically. We must not confuse the
purely metaphysical personifications of the <EM>abstract </EM>attributes
of Deity, with their reflection -- the sidereal gods. This reflection,
however, is in reality the objective expression of the abstraction:
<EM>living</EM> Entities and the models formed on that divine
prototype. Moreover, the three metaphysical Sephiroth or &quot;<EM>the
periphrasis of Jehovah</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>are<EM> not </EM>Jehovah;
it is the latter himself with the additional titles of Adonai,
Elohim, Sabbaoth, and the numerous names lavished on him, who
is the periphrasis of the Shaddai, <IMG SRC="sd1-384a.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">,
the Omnipotent. The name is a circumlocution, indeed, a too abundant
figure of Jewish rhetoric, and has always been denounced by the
Occultists. To the Jewish Kabalists, and even the Christian Alchemists
and Rosicrucians, Jehovah was a convenient <EM>screen</EM>,<EM>
</EM>unified by the folding of its many flaps, and adopted as
a substitute: one name of an individual Sephiroth being as good
as another name, for those who had the secret. The Tetragrammaton,
the Ineffable, the sidereal &quot;<EM>Sum Total</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>was invented for no other purpose than to mislead the profane
and to symbolize life and generation.* The real secret and <EM>unpronounceable</EM>
name --<EM> </EM>&quot;the word that is no word&quot; -- has to
be sought in the seven names of the first seven emanations, or
the &quot;Sons of the Fire,&quot;

We shall have to enter more fully upon this subject, and bring
practical illustrations to prove the statements made in the text.
<P>
For the present it is sufficient to show, by a few instances,
the truth of what was asserted at the beginning of this Monograph,
namely, that no Cosmogony, the world over, with the sole exception
of the Christian, has ever attributed to the One Highest cause,
the UNIVERSAL Deific Principle, the immediate creation of our
Earth, man, or anything connected with these. This statement holds
as good for the Hebrew or Chaldean Kabala as it does for <EM>Genesis</EM>,<EM>

is still more important -- correctly translated.** Everywhere
there is either a LOGOS -- a<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Light </EM>shining

* The statement will, of course, be found preposterous and absurd,
and simply laughed at. But if one believes in the final submersion
of Atlantis 850,000 years ago, as taught in &quot;<EM>Esoteric
Buddhism</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(the gradual first sinking having
begun during the Eocene age), one has to accept the statement
for the so-called Lemuria, the continent of the Third Root Race,
first nearly destroyed by combustion, and then submerged. This
is what the Commentary says: &quot;The first earth having been
purified by the forty-nine fires, her people, born of Fire and
Water, could not die . . . etc.; the Second Earth (with its race)
disappeared as vapour vanishes in the air . . . the Third Earth
had everything consumed on it after the <EM>separation</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and went down into the lower Deep (the Ocean). This was <EM>twice
e</EM>ighty-two cyclic years ago.&quot; Now a <EM>cyclic </EM>year
is what we call a<EM> sidereal </EM>year, and is founded on the
precession of the equinoxes, or 25,868 years each, and this is
equal, therefore, in all to 4,242,352 years. More details will
be found in the text of Book II. Meanwhile, this doctrine is embodied
in the &quot;Kings of Edom.&quot;

Thou art One, and in the secret of Thy unity the wisest of men

art one, but <EM>not as an element of numeration; for Thy Unity
admits not of multiplication</EM>,<EM> change or form. </EM>Thou
art existent; but the understanding and vision of mortals cannot
attain to thy existence, nor determine for thee the Where, the

before all time and without Place. Thou art Existent, and thy
existence is so profound and secret that none can penetrate and
discover thy secrecy. Thou art Living, but within no time that

It was often premised (and as unjustly as usual) that China, nearly
as old a country as India, had no cosmogony. &quot;It was unknown
to Confucius, and the Buddhists extended their Cosmogony without
introducing a personal God,&quot;* it is complained. The <EM>Yi-King</EM>,<EM>
</EM>&quot;the very essence of ancient thought and the combined
work of the most venerated sages, fails to show a distinct cosmogony.&quot;
Nevertheless, there is one, and a very distinct one. Only as Confucius
did not admit of a future life** and the Chinese Buddhists reject
the idea of <EM>One</EM> Creator, accepting one cause and its
numberless effects, they are misunderstood by the believers in
a <EM>personal </EM>God. The &quot;great Extreme&quot; as the
commencement &quot;of changes&quot; (transmigrations) is the shortest
and perhaps the most suggestive of all Cosmogonies, for those
who, like the Confucianists, love virtue for its own sake, and
try to do good unselfishly without perpetually looking to reward
and profit. The &quot;great Extreme&quot; of Confucius produces
&quot;two figures.&quot; These &quot;two&quot; produce in their
turn &quot;the four images&quot;; these again &quot;the eight
symbols.&quot; It is complained that though the Confucianists
see in them &quot;Heaven, Earth and man in miniature,&quot; .
. . we can see in them anything we like. No doubt, and so it is
with regard to many symbols, especially in those of the latest
religions. But they who know something of Occult numerals, see
in these &quot;figures&quot; the symbol, however rude, of a harmonious
progressive Evolution of Kosmos and its beings, both the Heavenly
and the Terrestrial. And any one who has studied the numerical
evolution in the primeval cosmogony of Pythagoras (a contemporary
of Confucius) can never fail to find in his <EM>Triad</EM>,<EM>
Tetractis </EM>and

<P>
<EM>Decade </EM>emerging from the ONE and solitary Monad, the
same idea. Confucius is laughed at by his Christian biographer
for &quot;talking of divination&quot; before and after this passage,
and is represented as saying: &quot;The eight symbols determine
good and ill fortune, and these lead to great deeds. There are
no imitable images greater than heaven and earth. There are no
changes greater than the four seasons (meaning North, South, East
and West, <EM>et seq.</EM>)<EM>. </EM>There are no suspended images
brighter than the sun and moon. In preparing <EM>things for use</EM>,<EM>
there is none greater than the sage. </EM>In determining good
and ill-luck there is nothing greater than <EM>the divining straws
and the tortoise.</EM>&quot;*
<P>
Therefore, the &quot;divining straws&quot; and the &quot;tortoise,&quot;
the &quot;symbolic sets of lines,&quot; and the great sage who
looks at them as they become one and two, and two become four,
and four become eight, and the other sets &quot;three and six,&quot;
are laughed to scorn, only because his wise symbols are misunderstood.
<P>
So the author and his colleagues will scoff no doubt at the <EM>Stanzas
</EM>given in our text, for they represent <EM>precisely the same
idea. </EM>The old archaic map of Cosmogony is full of <EM>lines
</EM>in the Confucian style, of concentric circles and dots. Yet
all these represent the most abstract and philosophical conceptions
of the Cosmogony of our Universe. At all events it may answer,
perhaps, better to the requirements and the scientific purposes
of our age, than the cosmogonical essays of St. Augustine and
the &quot;Venerable Bede,&quot; though these were published over
a millennium later than the Confucian.
<P>
Confucius, one of the greatest sages of the ancient world, believed
in ancient magic, and practised it himself &quot;if we take for
granted the statements of <EM>Kin-yu</EM>&quot; . . . . and &quot;he
praised it to the skies in <EM>Yi-kin</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>we
are told by his reverend critic. Nevertheless, even in his age
-- <EM>i.e.</EM>,<EM> </EM>600 B.C., Confucius and his school
taught the sphericity of the Earth and even the heliocentric system;
while, at about thrice 600 years after the Chinese philosopher,
the Popes of Rome threatened and even burnt &quot;heretics&quot;
for asserting the same. He is laughed at for speaking of the &quot;Sacred
Tortoise.&quot; No unprejudiced person can see any great difference
between a <EM>tortoise </EM>and a <EM>lamb </EM>as candidates
for sacredness, as both are symbols and no more. The Ox, the Eagle,**
the Lion, and occasionally

* He may be laughed at by the Protestants; but the Roman Catholics
have no right to mock him, without becoming guilty of blasphemy

many converts among the ignorant Confucianists.

the Dove, are &quot;the sacred animals&quot; of the Western Bible,
the first three being found grouped round the Evangelists; and
the fourth (the human face) is a Seraph, <EM>i.e.</EM>, a fiery
serpent, the Gnostic Agathodaemon probably.* As explained, the
&quot;sacred animals&quot; and the Flames or &quot;Sparks&quot;
within the &quot;Holy Four&quot; refer to the prototypes of all
that is found in the Universe in the <EM>Divine Thought</EM>,<EM>
</EM>in the <STRONG>R</STRONG>OOT, which is the perfect cube,
or the foundation of the Kosmos collectively and individually.
They have all an occult reference to primordial Cosmic forms and
its first concretions, work, and evolution.
<P>
In the earliest Hindu exoteric cosmogonies, it is not even the
Demiurge who creates. For it is said in one of the Puranas that:
&quot;The great Architect of the World gives the first impulse
to the rotatory motion of our planetary system by stepping in
turn over each planet and body.&quot; It is this action &quot;that
causes each sphere to turn around itself, and all around the Sun.&quot;
After which action, &quot;it is the <EM>Brahmandica</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the Solar and Lunar Pitris (the Dhyani-Chohans)&quot; who
take charge of their respective spheres (earths and planets),
to the end of the Kalpa.&quot; The Creators are the Rishis; most
of whom are credited with the authorship of the mantras or Hymns
of the Rig Veda. They are sometimes seven, sometimes ten, when
they become <EM>prajapati</EM>,<EM> </EM>the<EM> </EM>&quot;Lord
of Beings&quot;; then they rebecome the <EM>seven </EM>and the
<EM>fourteen </EM>Manus, as the representatives of the seven and
fourteen <EM>cycles </EM>of Existence (&quot;Days of Brahma&quot;);
thus answering to the seven <EM>AEons</EM>,<EM> </EM>when at the
end of the first stage of Evolution they are transformed into
the seven stellar Rishis, the Saptarishis; while their <EM>human
</EM>doubles appear as heroes, Kings and Sages on this earth.

So with the mystery of the <EM>tortoise. </EM>Rejoicing over the
poetry of Biblical metaphors, associating with the name of Jehovah,
&quot;incandescent stones,&quot; &quot;sacred animals,&quot; etc.,
and quoting from the <EM>Bible de Vence </EM>(<EM>Vol. XIX. p.
</EM>318) a French pious writer says: &quot;Indeed all of them

of Jehovah each time they represent him.&quot; (<EM>Pneumatologie</EM>,<EM>
Vol. II.</EM>,<EM> p</EM>. 294). No one ever doubted that <EM>the
</EM>NAME must have been <EM>assumed</EM>,<EM> </EM>when under
the guise of the Infinite, One Incognizable, the <EM>Malachim
</EM>(messengers) descended to eat and drink with men. But if
the Elohim (and even lower Beings), <EM>assuming </EM>the god-name,
were and are still worshipped, why should the same Elohim be called
<EM>devils</EM>,<EM> </EM>when appearing under the names of other
Gods?
<P>
* The choice is curious, and shows how paradoxical were the first
Christians in their selections. For why should they have chosen
these symbols of Egyptian paganism, when the eagle is never mentioned
in the New Testament save once, when Jesus refers to it as a <EM>carrion
</EM>eater?<EM> </EM>(<EM>Matt. </EM>xxiv. 28); and in the Old
Testament it is called <EM>unclean</EM>;<EM> </EM>that the Lion
is made a point of comparison with Satan, both roaring for men
to devour; and the oxen are driven out of the Temple. On the other
hand the Serpent, brought as an exemplar of wisdom to follow,
is now regarded as the symbol of the Devil. The esoteric pearl
of Christ's religion degraded into Christian theology, may indeed
be said to have chosen a strange and unfitting <EM>shell </EM>to
be born in and evolved from.<HR>

<P>
The Esoteric doctrine of the East having thus furnished and struck
the key-note -- which is as scientific as it is philosophical
and poetical, as may be seen, under its allegorical garb -- every
nation has followed its lead. It is from the exoteric religions
that we have to dig out the root-idea before we turn to esoteric
truths, lest the latter should be rejected. Furthermore, every
symbol -- in <EM>every</EM> national religion -- may be read esoterically,
and the proof furnished for its being correctly read by transliterating
it into its corresponding numerals and geometrical forms -- by
the extraordinary agreement of all -- however much the glyphs
and symbols may vary among themselves. For in the origin those
symbols were all identical. Take, for instance, the opening sentences
in various cosmogonies: in every case it is either a <EM>circle</EM>,<EM>
</EM>an<EM> egg</EM>, or a <EM>head. </EM><STRONG>D</STRONG>ARKNESS
is always associated with this first symbol and surrounds it,
-- as shown in the Hindu, the Egyptian, the Chaldeo-Hebrew and
even the Scandinavian systems -- hence black ravens, black doves,
black waters and even black flames; the <EM>seventh </EM>tongue
of Agni, the <EM>fire-god </EM>being called &quot;<EM>Kali</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>&quot;the black,&quot; as it was a black flickering flame.
Two <EM>black </EM>doves flew from Egypt and settling on the oaks
of Dodona, gave their names to the Grecian gods. Noah lets out
a <EM>black </EM>raven after the deluge, which is a symbol for
the Cosmic pralaya, after which began the real creation or evolution
of our earth and humanity. Odin's black ravens fluttered around
the Goddess Saga and &quot;whispered to her of the past and of
the future.&quot; What is the real meaning of all those black
birds? They are all connected with the primeval wisdom, which
flows out of the pre-cosmic Source of all, symbolised by the Head,
the Circle, the Egg; and they all have an identical meaning and
relate to the primordial Archetypal man (Adam Kadmon) the creative
origin of all things, which is composed of the Host of Cosmic
Powers -- the Creative Dhyan-Chohans, beyond which all is darkness.
<P>
Let us inquire of the wisdom of the Kabala -- even veiled and
distorted as it now is, -- to explain in its numerical language
an approximate meaning, at least of the word &quot;raven.&quot;
This is its number value as given in the &quot;Source of Measures.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The term <EM>Raven </EM>is used but once, and taken as <EM>eth-h</EM>'<EM>orebv
<IMG SRC="sd1-443a.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">, = 678, or 113 x 6; while
the Dove is mentioned five times. Its value is 71, and 71 x 5
= 355. Six diameters, or the raven</EM>, crossing, would divide
the circumference of a circle of 355 into 12 parts or compartments;
and 355 subdivided for each unit by 6, would equal 213-0, or the<EM>
head </EM>(&quot;beginning&quot;) in the first verse of Genesis.
This divided or subdivided, after the same fashion, by 2, or the
355 by 12, would give 213-2, or the word <EM>B</EM>'<EM>rash</EM>,
<IMG SRC="sd1-443b.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">, or the first word of
Genesis, with its prepositional prefix, signifying the same concreted
general form<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 444 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
astronomically, with the one here intended.&quot; Now the secret
reading of the first verse of Genesis being: &quot;In Rash (B'rash)
or head, developed gods, the Heavens and the Earth&quot; -- it
is easy to comprehend the esoteric meaning of the <EM>raven</EM>,<EM>
</EM>once that the like meaning of the Flood (or Noah's Deluge)
is ascertained. Whatever the many other meanings of this emblematical
allegory may be, its <EM>chief</EM> meaning is that of a new cycle
and a new Round (our <EM>Fourth </EM>Round.)* The &quot;Raven,&quot;
or the <EM>Eth-H</EM>'<EM>Orebv</EM>,<EM> </EM>yields the same
numerical value as the &quot;Head,&quot; and returned not to the
ark, while the dove returned, carrying the olive-branch, when
Noah, the new man of the new Race (whose prototype is Vaivasvata
Manu), prepared to leave the ark, the womb (or <EM>Argha</EM>)<EM>
</EM>of terrestrial nature, is the symbol of the purely spiritual,
sexless and androgyne man of the first three Races, who vanished
from earth for ever. Numerically Jehovah, Adam, Noah, are one
in the Kabala: at best, then, it is Deity descending on to Ararat
(later on Sinai), to incarnate in man his <EM>image</EM>,<EM>
</EM>through the natural process, henceforth: the mother's womb,
whose symbols are the ark, the mount (Sinai), etc., in <EM>Genesis.
</EM>The Jewish allegory is at once astronomical, and purely physiological
rather than anthropomorphic.
<P>
And here lies the abyss between the two systems (Aryan and Semitic),
though built on the same foundation. As shown by an expounder
of the Kabala, &quot;the basic idea underlying the philosophy
of the Hebrews was that God contained all things within himself
and that man was <EM>his image; </EM>man, including woman (as
Androgynes);&quot; and that &quot;geometry and numbers (and measures
applicable to astronomy) are contained in the terms <EM>man </EM>and<EM>
woman; </EM>and the apparent incongruity of such a mode was eliminated
by showing the connection of man and woman with a particular system
of numbers and measures and geometry, by the parturient time-periods,
which furnished the connecting link between the terms and the
facts shown, and perfected the mode used.&quot; It is argued that,
the primal cause being absolutely incognizable, &quot;the symbol
of its first<EM> comprehensible manifestation </EM>was the conception
of a circle with its diameter line, so as at once to carry the
idea of geometry, phallicism, and astronomy;&quot; and this was
finally applied to the &quot;signification of simply human generative
organs.&quot;** Hence the whole cycle of events

* Bryant is right in saying &quot;Druid Bardesin says of Noah
that when he came out of the ark (the birth of a new cycle), after
a stay therein of a year and a day, that 364 + 1 = 365 days, he
was congratulated by Neptune upon his birth from the waters of
the Flood, who wished him a <EM>happy New Year.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>The &quot;Year,&quot; or cycle, esoterically, was the new<EM>
</EM>race of men <EM>born from woman </EM>after the separation
of the sexes, which is <EM>the secondary </EM>meaning of the allegory:
its primary meaning being the beginning of the Fourth Round, or
the <EM>new </EM>Creation.

from Adam and the Patriarchs down to Noah is made to apply to
phallic and astronomical uses, the one regulating the other, as
the lunar periods, for instance. Hence, too, their <EM>genesis
</EM>begins after their coming out of the Ark, and the close of
the flood -- at the Fourth Race. With the Aryan people it is different.
<P>
Eastern Esotericism has never degraded the One Infinite Deity,
the container of all things, to such uses; and this is shown by
the absence of Brahma from the Rig Veda and the modest positions
occupied therein by Rudra and Vishnu, who became the powerful
and great Gods, the &quot;Infinites&quot; of the exoteric creeds,
ages later. But even they, &quot;Creators&quot; as the three may
be, are not the direct creators and &quot;forefathers of men.&quot;
The latter are shown occupying a still lower scale, and are called
Prajapatis, the Pitris (our lunar ancestors), etc., etc. -- never
the &quot;One Infinite God.&quot; Esoteric philosophy shows only
<EM>physical </EM>man as created <EM>in the image </EM>of the
Deity: but the latter is but &quot;the <EM>minor gods.</EM>&quot;<EM>
