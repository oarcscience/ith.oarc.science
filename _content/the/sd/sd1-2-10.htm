&quot;Object of horror or of adoration, men have for the serpent
an implacable hatred, or prostrate themselves before its genius.
Lie calls it, Prudence claims it, Envy carries it in its heart,
and Eloquence on its caduceus. In hell it arms the whip of the
Furies; in heaven Eternity makes of it its symbol.&quot;

<P>
of light that was accorded to each; and they maintained that the
serpent had to be constantly called upon and to be thanked for
the signal service it had rendered humanity. For it taught Adam
that if he ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, he would raise his being immensely by the learning and wisdom
he would thus acquire. Such was the exoteric reason given.
<P>
It is easy to see whence the primal idea of this dual, Janus-like
character of the Serpent: the good and the bad. This symbol is
one of the most ancient, because the reptile preceded the bird,
and the bird the mammal. Thence the belief, or rather the superstition,
of the savage tribes who think that the souls of their ancestors
live under this form, and the general association of the Serpent
with the tree. The legends about the various things it represents
are numberless; but, as most of them are allegorical, they have
now passed into the class of fables based on ignorance and dark
superstition. For instance, when Philostratus narrates that the
natives of India and Arabia fed on the heart and liver of serpents
in order to learn the language of all the animals, the serpent
being credited with that faculty, he certainly never meant his
words to be accepted literally. (See <EM>De Vita Apollonii</EM>,<EM>
</EM>lib.<EM> </EM>1, c. xiv.) As will be found more than once
as we proceed, the &quot;Serpent&quot; and &quot;Dragon&quot;
were the names given to the &quot;Wise Ones,&quot; the initiated
adepts of olden times. It was their wisdom and their learning
that were devoured or assimilated by their followers, whence the
allegory. When the Scandinavian Sigurd is fabled to have roasted
the heart of Fafnir, the Dragon, whom he had slain, becoming thereby
the wisest of men, it meant the same thing. Sigurd had become
learned in the runes and magical charms; he had received the &quot;word&quot;
from an initiate of that name, or from a sorcerer, after which
the latter died, as many do, after &quot;passing the word.&quot;
Epiphanius lets out a secret of the Gnostics while trying to expose
their <EM>heresies. </EM>The Gnostic Ophites, he says, had a reason
for honouring the Serpent: <EM>it was because he taught the primeval
men the Mysteries </EM>(<EM>Adv. Haeres. </EM>37). Verily so;
but they did not have Adam and Eve in the garden in their minds
when teaching this dogma, but simply that which is stated above.
The <EM>Nagas </EM>of the Hindu and Tibetan adepts were human
<EM>Nagas </EM>(Serpents), not reptiles. Moreover, the Serpent
has ever been the type of consecutive or serial rejuvenation,
of <STRONG>I</STRONG>MMORTALITY and <STRONG>T</STRONG>IME.
<P>
The numerous and extremely interesting readings, the interpretations
and facts about Serpent worship, given in &quot;The Natural Genesis,&quot;
are very ingenious and scientifically correct. But they are far
from covering the <EM>whole </EM>of the meanings implied. They
divulge only the astronomical and physiological mysteries, with
the addition of some cosmic phenomena. On the lowest plane of
materiality the Serpent was, no doubt,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 405 THE DEGRADATION OF THE SYMBOL.</H6>

<P>
&quot;the great mystery in the mysteries,&quot; and was, very
likely, &quot;adopted as a type of feminine pubescence, on account
of its sloughing and self-renewal.&quot; It was so, however, only
with regard to mysteries concerning terrestrial <EM>animal </EM>life,
for as symbol of &quot;<EM>reclothing </EM>and rebirth in the
(universal) mysteries&quot; its &quot;<EM>final phase</EM>&quot;<EM>*</EM>
-- or<EM> </EM>shall we rather say its incipient and culminating
phases -- they were not of this plane. They were generated in
the pure realm of ideal light, and having accomplished the round
of the whole cycle of adaptations and symbolism, the &quot;mysteries&quot;
returned from whence they had come -- into the essence of <EM>immaterial
</EM>causality. They belonged to the highest gnosis. And surely
this could have never obtained its name and fame solely on account
of its penetration into physiological and especially feminine
functions!
<P>
As a symbol, the Serpent had as many aspects and occult meanings
as the Tree itself; the &quot;Tree of Life,&quot; with which it
was emblematically and almost indissolubly connected. Whether
viewed as a metaphysical or a physical symbol, the Tree and Serpent,
jointly, or separately, have never been so degraded by antiquity
as they are now, in this our age of the breaking of idols, not
for truth's sake, but to glorify the more gross matter. The revelations
and interpretations in &quot;The Rivers of Life&quot; would have
astounded the worshippers of the Tree and Serpent in the days
of archaic Chaldean and Egyptian wisdom; and even the early Saivas
would have recoiled in horror at the theories and suggestions
of the author of the said work. &quot;The notion of Payne Knight
and Inman that the cross or Tau is simply a copy of the male organs
in a triadic form is radically false,&quot; writes Mr. G. Massey,
who proves what he says. But this is a statement that could be
as justly applied to almost all the modern interpretations of
ancient symbols. &quot;The Natural Genesis,&quot; a monumental
work of research and thought, the most complete on that subject
that has ever been published, covering as it does a wider field,
and explaining much more than all the symbologists who have hitherto
written, does not yet go beyond the &quot;psycho-theistic&quot;
stage of ancient thought. Nor were Payne Knight and Inman altogether
wrong; except in entirely failing to see that their interpretations
of the &quot;Tree of Life,&quot; as the cross and phallus, fitted
the symbol, and approximated it, only on the lowest and last stage
of the evolutionary development of the idea of the GIVER OF LIFE.
It was the last and the grossest physical transformation of nature,
in animal, insect, bird, and even plant; for biune, creative magnetism,
in the form of the attraction of the contraries, or sexual polarization,
acts in the constitution of reptile and bird as it does in that
of man. Moreover, the modern symbologists and Orientalists --
from first to last --

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 406 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
being ignorant of the real mysteries revealed by occultism, can
necessarily see but this last stage. If told that this mode of
procreation, which the whole world of being has now in common
on this earth, is but a passing phase, a physical means of furnishing
the conditions to, and producing the phenomena of life which will
alter with this, and disappear with the next Root-Race -- they
would laugh at such a superstitious and unscientific idea. But
the most learned Occultists assert this because <EM>they know
</EM>it. The universe of living beings, of all those which procreate
their species, is the living witness to the various modes of procreation
in the evolution of animal and human species and races; and the
naturalist ought to sense this truth intuitionally, even though
he is yet unable to demonstrate it. And how could he, indeed,
with the present modes of thought! The landmarks of the archaic
history of the past are few and scarce, and those that men of
science come across are mistaken for finger-posts of our little
era. Even so-called &quot;universal&quot; (?) history embraces
but a tiny field in the almost boundless space of the unexplored
regions of our latest, fifth Root-Race. Hence, every fresh sign-post,
every new glyph of the hoary Past that is discovered, is added
to the old stock of information, to be interpreted on the same
lines of pre-existing conceptions, and without any reference to
the special cycle of thought which that particular glyph may belong
to. How can Truth ever come to light if this method is never changed!
<P>
Thus, in the beginning of their joint existence as a glyph of
Immortal Being, the Tree and Serpent were divine imagery, truly.
The tree <EM>was reversed</EM>,<EM> </EM>and its roots were generated
in Heaven and grew out of the Rootless Root of all-being. Its
trunk grew and developed, crossing the planes of Pleroma, it shot
out crossways its luxuriant branches, first on the plane of hardly
differentiated matter, and then downward till they touched the
terrestrial plane. Thus, the Asvattha, tree of Life and Being,
whose destruction alone leads to immortality, is said in the Bhagavatgita
to grow with its roots above and its branches below (ch. xv.).
The roots represent the Supreme Being, or First Cause, the LOGOS;
but one has to go beyond those roots to <EM>unite oneself with
Krishna</EM>,<EM> </EM>who, says Arjuna (<B>XI</B>.), is &quot;greater
than Brahman, and First Cause . . . the indestructible, that which
is, that which is not, and what is beyond them.&quot; Its boughs
are Hiranyagharba (Brahma or Brahman in his highest manifestations,
say Sridhara and Madhusudana), the highest Dhyan Chohans or Devas.
The Vedas are its leaves. He only who goes <EM>beyond </EM>the
roots shall never return, <EM>i.e.</EM>, shall reincarnate no
more during this &quot;age&quot; of Brahma.
<P>
It is only when its pure boughs had touched the terrestrial mud
of the garden of Eden, of our Adamic race, that this Tree got
soiled by the contact and lost its pristine purity; and that the
Serpent of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 407 THE SEVEN-HEADED DRAGONS.</H6>

<P>
Eternity -- the heaven-born <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS -- was finally
degraded. In days of old -- of the <EM>divine Dynasties </EM>on
Earth -- the now dreaded Reptile was regarded as the first beam
of light that radiated from the abyss of divine Mystery. Various
were the forms which it was made to assume, and numerous the natural
symbols adapted to it, as it crossed aeons of Time: as from Infinite
Time itself -- <EM>Kala</EM> --<EM> </EM>it fell into the space
and time evolved out of human speculation. These forms were Cosmic
and astronomical, theistic and pantheistic, abstract and concrete.
They became in turn the Polar Dragon and the Southern Cross, the
<EM>Alpha Draconis </EM>of the Pyramid, and the Hindu-Buddhist
Dragon, which ever threatens, yet never swallows the Sun during
its eclipses. Till then, the Tree remained ever green, for it
was sprinkled by the waters of life; the great Dragon, ever divine,
so long as it was kept within the precincts of the sidereal fields.
But the tree grew and its lower boughs touched at last the infernal
regions -- our Earth. Then the great serpent Nidhogg -- he who
devours the corpses of the evil-doers in the &quot;Hall of Misery&quot;
(human life), so soon as they are plunged into &quot;Hwergelmir,&quot;
the roaring cauldron (of human passions) -- gnawed the World-tree.
The worms of materiality covered the once healthy and mighty roots,
and are now ascending higher and higher along the trunk; while
the Midgard-snake coiled at the bottom of the Seas, encircles
the Earth, and, through its venomous breath, makes her powerless
to defend herself.
<P>
They are all seven-headed, the dragons and serpents of antiquity
-- &quot;one head for each race, and every head with seven hairs
on it,&quot; as the allegory has it. Aye, from Ananta, the Serpent
of Eternity which carries Vishnu through the Manvantara, from
the original primordial Sesha, whose seven heads become &quot;one
thousand heads&quot; in the Puranic fancy, down to the seven-headed
Akkadian Serpent. This typifies the Seven principles throughout
nature and man; the highest or <EM>middle </EM>head being the
seventh. It is not of the Mosaic, Jewish Sabbath that Philo speaks
in his <EM>Creation of the World</EM>,<EM> </EM>when saying that
the world was completed &quot;according to the perfect nature
of number 6.&quot; For, &quot;<EM>when that reason </EM>(<EM>nous</EM>)<EM>
which is holy in accordance with the number seven</EM>,<EM> has
entered the soul </EM>(rather the living body), the number six
is thus arrested, and all the mortal things which that number
makes.&quot; And again: &quot;Number 7 is the festival day of
all the earth, the <EM>birthday of the world. </EM>I know not
whether any one would be able to celebrate the number 7 in adequate
terms.&quot; . . . (Par. pp. 30 and 419). The author of <EM>The
Natural Genesis </EM>thinks that &quot;the Septenary of Stars
seen in the great bear (the <EM>Septarshis</EM>)<EM> </EM>and
seven-headed Dragon furnished a visible origin for the symbolic
seven of time above. The goddess of the seven stars,&quot; he
adds --<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 408 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Was the mother of time, as Kep; whence Kepti and Sebti for
the two times and number seven. So this is the star of the Seven
by name. Sevekt (Kronos), the Son of the goddess, has the name
of the seven or seventh. So has Sefekh Abu who builds the house
on high, as Wisdom (Sophia) built hers with seven pillars. . .
The primary Kronotypes were seven, and thus the beginning of time
in heaven is based on the number and the name of seven, on account
of the starry demonstrators. The seven stars as they turned round
annually kept pointing, as it were, with the forefinger of the
right hand, and describing a circle in the upper and lower heaven.*
The number seven naturally suggested a measure by seven, that
led to what may be termed <I>Sevening,</I> and to the marking
and mapping out of the circle in seven corresponding divisions
which were assigned to the seven great constellations; and thus
was formed the celestial heptanomis of Egypt in the heavens. .
. . When the stellar heptanomis was broken up and divided into
four quarters, it was multiplied by four, and the twenty-eight
signs took the place of the primary seven constellations, the
lunar zodiac of twenty-eight days being the registered result.**
. . . In the Chinese arrangement the four sevens are given to
four genii that preside over the four cardinal points. . . .&quot;
(In Chinese Buddhism and Esotericism the genii are represented
by four Dragons -- the &quot;Maharajahs&quot; of the Stanzas.)
&quot;The seven Northern constellations make up the Black Warrior;
the seven Eastern (Chinese autumn) constitute the White Tiger;
the seven Southern are the Vermilion Bird; and the seven Western
(called Vernal) are the Azure Dragon. Each of these four Spirits
presides over its heptanomis during one lunar week. The genetive
of the first heptanomis (Typhon of the Seven Stars) now took a
lunar character; . . . in this phase we find the goddess Sefekh,
whose name signifies number 7, is the feminine word, or <I>logos
</I>in place of the mother of Time, who was the earlier <I>Word</I>,<I>
</I>as goddess of the Seven Stars&quot; (&quot;Typology of Time,&quot;
Vol. II. p. 313,<I> Nat. Gen.</I>)<I>.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The author shows that it was the goddess of the Great Bear and
mother of Time who was in Egypt from the earliest times the &quot;<I>Living
Word</I>,&quot;<I> </I>and that &quot;Sevekh-Kronus, whose type
was the Crocodile-Dragon, the pre-planetary form of Saturn, was
called her son and consort; he was her Word-Logos&quot; (p. 321,<I>
</I>Vol. I.).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The above is quite plain, but it was not the knowledge of astronomy
only that led the ancients to the process of <EM>Sevening. </EM>The
primal cause goes far deeper and will be explained in its place.
<P>
The above quotations are no digressions. They are brought forward
as showing (<EM>a</EM>) the reason why a full Initiate was called
a &quot;Dragon,&quot; a &quot;Snake&quot; a &quot;Naga&quot;;
and (<EM>b</EM>) that our septenary division was used by the priests
of the earliest dynasties in Egypt, for the same reason and on
the same basis as by us. This needs further elucidation, however.
As already stated, that which Mr. G. Massey calls the four genii
of the four cardinal points; and the Chinese, the Black Warrior,
White Tiger, Ver-

<P>
* For the same reason the division of the principles in man into
seven are thus reckoned, as they describe the same circle in the
human higher and lower nature.
<P>
** Thus the septenary division is the oldest and preceded the
four-fold division. It is the root of archaic classification.

milion Bird, and Azure Dragon, is called in the Secret Books,
-- the &quot;Four Hidden Dragons of Wisdom&quot; and the &quot;Celestial
Nagas.&quot; Now, as shown, the seven-headed or septenary <STRONG>D</STRONG>RAGON-<STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS
had been in course of time split up, so to speak, into four heptanomic
parts or twenty-eight portions. Each lunar week has a distinct
occult character in the lunar month; each day of the twenty-eight
has its special characteristics; as each of the twelve constellations,
whether separately or in combination with other signs, has an
occult influence either for good or for evil. This represents
the sum of knowledge that men can acquire on this earth; yet few
are those who acquire it, and still fewer are the wise men who
get to the root of knowledge symbolized by the great Root Dragon,
the spiritual LOGOS of these visible signs. But those who do,
receive the name of &quot;Dragons,&quot; and they are the &quot;Arhats
of the Four Truths of the 28 Faculties,&quot; or attributes, and
have always been so called.
<P>
The Alexandrian Neo-Platonists asserted that to become real <EM>Chaldees
</EM>or Magi, one had to master the science or knowledge of the
periods of the Seven Rectors of the world, in whom is all wisdom.
In &quot;Proclus in<EM> Timaeus</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>b.<EM> </EM>1,
Jamblichus is credited with another version, which does not however,
alter, the meaning. He says that &quot;the Assyrians have not
only preserved the records of seven and twenty myriads of years,
as Hipparchus says they have, but likewise of the whole apocatastases
and periods of the Seven Rulers of the World.&quot; The legends
of every nation and tribe, whether civilized or savage, point
to the once universal belief in the great wisdom and cunning of
the Serpents. They are &quot;charmers.&quot; They hypnotise the
bird with their eye, and man himself, very often, does not feel
above their fascinating influence; therefore the symbol is a most
fitting one.
<P>
The crocodile is the Egyptian dragon. It was the dual symbol of
Heaven and Earth, of Sun and Moon, and was made sacred, in consequence
of its amphibious nature, to Osiris and Isis. According to Eusebius,
the Egyptians represented the sun in a ship as its pilot, this
ship being carried along by a crocodile &quot;to show the motion
of the Sun in the moyst (Space)&quot;,<EM> </EM>(<EM>Prepar. Evang.</EM>,
1, 3, c. 3). The crocodile was moreover, the symbol of Egypt herself
-- the <EM>lower</EM>,<EM> </EM>as being the more swampy of the
two countries. The Alchemists claim another interpretation. They
say that the symbol of the sun in the ship on the Ether of Space
meant that the hermetic matter is the principle, or basis, of
gold, or again the <EM>philosophical </EM>sun; the water, within
which the crocodile is swimming, is that water or matter made
liquid; the ship herself, finally, representing the vessel of
nature, in which the sun, or the sulphuric, igneous principle,
acts as a pilot: because it is the sun<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 410 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
which conducts the work by his action upon the <EM>moist </EM>or<EM>
mercury. </EM>The above is only for the Alchemists.
<P>
The Serpent became the type and symbol of evil, and of the Devil,
only during the middle ages. The early Christians -- besides the
Ophite Gnostics -- had their dual Logos: the Good and the Bad
Serpent, the Agathodaemon and the Kakodaemon. This is demonstrated
by the writings of Marcus, Valentinus, and many others, and especially
in <EM>Pistis Sophia</EM> --<EM> </EM>certainly a document of
the earliest centuries of Christianity. On the marble sarcophagus
of a tomb, discovered in 1852 near the Porta Pia, one sees the
scene of the adoration of the Magi, &quot;or else,&quot; remarks
the late C. W. King in &quot;<EM>The Gnostics</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>&quot;the<EM> </EM>prototype of that scene, the 'Birth of
the New Sun.'&quot; The mosaic floor exhibited a curious design
which might have represented either (<EM>a</EM>)<EM> </EM>Isis
suckling the babe Harpocrates, or (<EM>b</EM>)<EM> </EM>the Madonna
nursing the infant Jesus. In the smaller sarcophagi that surrounded
the larger one, eleven leaden plates rolled like scrolls were
found, three of which have been deciphered. The contents of these
ought to be regarded as final proof of a much-vexed question,
for they show that either the early Christians, up to the VIth
Century, were <EM>bond fide </EM>pagans, or that dogmatic Christianity
was borrowed wholesale, and passed in full into the Christian
Church -- Sun, Tree, Serpent, Crocodile and all.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;On the first is seen Anubis . . . holding out a scroll;
at his feet are two female busts; below all are two serpents entwined
. . . a corpse swathed up like a mummy. In the second scroll .
. . is Anubis, holding out a cross, the &quot;Sign of Life.&quot;
Under his feet lies the corpse encircled in the numerous folds
of a huge serpent, the Agathodaemon, guardian of the deceased.
. . . . In the third scroll, Anubis bears on his arm . . . . .
the outline of . . a complete Latin cross . . . At the god's foot
is a rhomboid, the Egyptian 'Egg of the World,' towards which
crawls a serpent coiled into a circle . . . . Under the busts
is the letter [[omega]] repeated <I>seven </I>times in a line,
reminding one of the 'names' . . . Very remarkable also is the
line of characters, apparently Palmyrene, upon the legs of the
first Anubis. As for the figure of the <I>serpent</I>,<I> </I>supposing
these talismans to emanate not from the Isiac but the newer Ophite
creed, it may well stand for that &quot;True and perfect Serpent,&quot;
who leads forth the souls of all that put their trust in him out
of the Egypt of the body, and through the Red Sea of Death into
the Land of Promise, saving them on their way from the Serpents
of the Wilderness, that is, from the Rulers of the Stars.&quot;
(King's &quot;Gnostics,&quot; p. 366.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And this &quot;True and Perfect Serpent&quot; is the seven-lettered
God who is now credited with being Jehovah, and Jesus <EM>One
with him. </EM>To this Seven-vowelled god the candidate for initiation
is sent by Christos, in the<EM> Pistis Sophia</EM>,<EM> </EM>a
work earlier than St. John's <EM>Revelation</EM>,<EM> </EM>and
evidently of the same school. &quot;The (Serpent of the) Seven
Thunders uttered<HR>

these seven vowels,&quot; but &quot;Seal up those things which
the seven thunders uttered, and write them not,&quot; says Revelation.
&quot;Do ye seek after these mysteries?&quot; inquiries Jesus
in <EM>Pistis Sophia. </EM>&quot;No mystery is more excellent
than they (the seven vowels): for they shall bring your souls
unto the Light of Lights&quot; -- <EM>i.e.</EM>, true Wisdom.
&quot;Nothing, therefore, is more excellent than the mysteries
which ye seek after, saving only the <EM>mystery of the Seven
Vowels and their </EM><STRONG>F</STRONG>ORTY AND NINE <EM>Powers</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and the numbers thereof.&quot;
<P>
In India, it was <EM>the mystery of the Seven </EM><STRONG>F</STRONG>IRES
and their forty-nine fires or aspects, or &quot;the members thereof,&quot;
just the same.
<P>
These seven vowels are represented by the Swastika signs on the
crowns of the seven heads of the Serpent of Eternity, in India,
among esoteric Buddhists, in Egypt, in Chaldea, etc. etc., and
among the Initiates of every other country. It is on the Seven
zones of <EM>post mortem </EM>ascent, in the Hermetic writings,
that the &quot;mortal&quot; leaves, on each, one of his &quot;Souls&quot;
(or Principles); until arrived on the plane above all zones he
remains as the great Formless Serpent of absolute wisdom -- or
the Deity itself. The seven-headed serpent has more than one signification
in the Arcane teachings. It is the seven-headed <EM>Draco</EM>,<EM>
</EM>each of whose heads is a star of the Lesser Bear; but it
was also, and pre-eminently, the Serpent of Darkness (<EM>i.e.</EM>,
inconceivable and incomprehensible) whose seven heads were the
seven <EM>Logoi</EM>,<EM> </EM>the reflections of the one and
first manifested Light -- the universal <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS.
