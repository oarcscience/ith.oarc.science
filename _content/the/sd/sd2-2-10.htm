<H3>&#167; XXIII.</H3>

<H4>THE UPANISHADS IN GNOSTIC LITERATURE.</H4>

<P>
We are reminded in King's &quot;Gnostics&quot; that the Greek
language has but one word for <EM>vowel </EM>and voice; and this
has led the uninitiated to many erroneous interpretations. On
the simple knowledge, however, of that well-known fact a comparison
may be attempted, and a flood of light thrown upon several mystic
meanings. Thus the words, so often used in the Upanishads and
the Puranas, &quot;Sound&quot; and &quot;Speech,&quot; may be
collated with the Gnostic &quot;Vowels&quot; and the &quot;Voices&quot;
of the Thunders and Angels in &quot;Revelation.&quot; The same
will be found in <EM>Pistis Sophia, </EM>and other ancient Fragments
and MSS. This was remarked even by the matter-of-fact author of
&quot;The Gnostics and their Remains.&quot;
<P>
Through Hippolytus, an early Church Father, we learn what Marcus
-- a Pythagorean rather than a Christian Gnostic, and a Kabalist
most certainly -- had received in mystic revelation. It is said
that &quot;Marcus had it revealed unto him that 'the <EM>seven
heavens'* </EM>. . . . sounded each one vowel, which, all combined
together, formed a complete doxology&quot;; in clearer words:
&quot;the <EM>Sound </EM>whereof being carried down (from these
seven heavens) to earth, became the creator and parent of all
things that be on earth.&quot; (See &quot;Hippolytus,&quot; vi.,
48, and King's <EM>Gnostics,</EM> p. 200.) Translated from the
Occult phraseology into still plainer language this would read:
&quot;The Sevenfold LOGOS having differentiated into seven <EM>Logoi,
</EM>or creative potencies (vowels) these (the second logos, or
&quot;Sound&quot;) created all on Earth.
<P>
Assuredly one who is acquainted with Gnostic literature can hardly
help seeing in St. John's <EM>Apocalypse, </EM>a work of the same
school of thought. For we find John saying (chap. x. 3, 4), &quot;Seven
thunders uttered their voices . . . and I was about to write .
. . (but) I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, 'Seal up
those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them
not.' &quot; The same injunction is given to Marcus, the same
to all other <EM>semi </EM>and<EM> full</EM> Initiates. Yet the
sameness of equivalent expressions used, and of the underlying
ideas, always betrays a portion of the mysteries. We must always
seek for more than one meaning in every mystery allegorically
revealed, especially in those in which the number seven and its
multiplication seven by seven, or forty-nine, appear. Now when
the Rabbi Jesus is requested (in <EM>Pistis</EM> 
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
*The &quot;Heavens&quot; are identical with &quot;Angels,&quot;
as already stated.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 564 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
<EM>Sophia</EM>)<EM> </EM>by his disciples to reveal to them,
&quot;the mysteries of the Light of thy (<EM>his</EM>)<EM> Father&quot;
</EM>(<EM>i.e.</EM>, of the higher SELF enlightened by Initiation
and Divine knowledge), Jesus answers: &quot;Do ye seek after these
mysteries? No mystery is more excellent than they which shall
bring your souls unto the Light of Lights, unto the place of Truth
and Goodness, unto the place where there is neither male nor female,
neither form in that place but Light, everlasting, not to be uttered.
Nothing therefore is more excellent than the mysteries which ye
seek after, <EM>saving</EM> <EM>only </EM>THE MYSTERY <EM>of the
seven vowels and their </EM>FORTY AND NINE POWERS, and their numbers
thereof; and no name is more excellent <EM>than</EM> <EM>all these
vowels.&quot; </EM>&quot;The Seven Fathers and the Forty-nine
Sons blaze in DARKNESS, but they are the LIFE and LIGHT and the
continuation thereof through the Great Age&quot; -- says the Commentary
speaking of the &quot;Fires.&quot;
<P>
Now it becomes evident that, in every esoteric interpretation
of exoteric beliefs expressed in allegorical forms, there was
the same underlying idea -- the basic number seven, the compound
of <EM>three and</EM> <EM>four, </EM>preceded by the divine THREE
(<IMG SRC="sd1-113.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">) making the perfect number
ten.
<P>
Also, these numbers applied equally to divisions of time, to cosmography
metaphysical and physical, as well as to man and everything else
in visible nature. Thus these <EM>Seven </EM>vowels with their
<EM>forty-nine </EM>powers are identical with the <EM>three </EM>and
the <EM>Seven </EM>Fires of the Hindus and their forty-nine fires;
identical with the numerical mysteries of the Persian Simorgh;
identical with those of the Jewish Kabalists. The latter, dwarfing
the numbers (their mode of <EM>blinds</EM>)<EM>, </EM>made the
duration of each successive <EM>renewal </EM>(what we call in
esoteric parlance <EM>Round</EM>)<EM> </EM>of the seven renewals
of the globe only of 7,000 years, instead of, as is more likely,
7,000,000,000, and assigned to the total duration of the universe
49,000 years only. (Compare &#167; &quot;Chronology of the Brahmins.&quot;)
<P>
Now, the Secret Doctrine furnishes a key which reveals to us on
indisputable grounds of comparative analogy that <EM>Garuda, </EM>the
allegorical and monstrous half-man and half-bird, -- the<EM> Vahan
</EM>or vehicle on which Vishnu (who is Kala, &quot;time&quot;)
is shown to ride -- is the origin of all other such allegories.
He is the Indian <EM>phoenix,</EM> the emblem of cyclic and periodical
time, the &quot;man-lion&quot; <EM>Singha, </EM>of whose representations
the so-called &quot;gnostic gems&quot; are so full.* &quot;Over
the seven rays of the lion's crown, and corresponding to their
points, stand, in many cases, the seven vowels of the Greek alphabet
[Gk char], testifying to the Seven Heavens.&quot; This is the
<EM>Solar </EM>lion and the emblem of the Solar cycle, as
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
*As confessed by King, the great authority on Gnostic antiquities,
these gnostic gems are not the work of the Gnostics, but belong
to <EM>pre-christian </EM>periods, and are the work of <EM>magicians
</EM>(p. 241).<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 565 WHEN TIME BE NO LONGER. </H6>

<P>
Garuda* is that of the great cycle, the <EM>&quot;Maha-Kalpa&quot;
</EM>co-eternal with Vishnu, and also, of course, the emblem of
the Sun, and Solar cycle. This is shown by the details of the
allegory. At his birth, Garuda is mistaken for <EM>Agni, </EM>the
God of Fire, on account of his (Garuda's) <EM>&quot;dazzling splendour,&quot;</EM>
and called thereupon <EM>Gaganeswara, </EM>&quot;lord of the sky.&quot;
Again, his being represented as Osiris, and by many heads of allegorical
monsters on the <EM>Abraxas </EM>(gnostic) gems, with the head
and beak of an eagle or a hawk (solar birds), denotes Garuda's
solar and cyclic character. His Son is <EM>Jatabu, </EM>the cycle
of 60,000 years. As well remarked by C. W. King: -- &quot;Whatever
the primary meaning (of the gem with the solar lion and vowels)
it was probably imported in its present shape from <STRONG>I</STRONG>NDIA,
<EM>that</EM> <EM>true fountain head of gnostic iconography&quot;
</EM>(<EM>Gnostics, </EM>p. 218).
<P>
The mysteries of the seven gnostic vowels, uttered by the thunders
of St. John, can be unriddled only by the primeval and original
Occultism of Aryavarta, brought into India by the primeval Brahmins,
who had been <EM>initiated in Central Asia. </EM>And this is the
Occultism we study and try to explain, as much as is possible
in these pages. Our doctrine of seven Races and Seven Rounds of
life and evolution around our terrestrial chain of spheres, may
be found even in <EM>Revelation.</EM>**<EM> </EM>When the seven
&quot;thunders,&quot; or &quot;sounds,&quot; or &quot;vowels&quot;
-- one meaning out of the seven for each such vowel relating directly
to our own Earth and its seven Root-Races in each Round -- &quot;had
uttered their voices&quot; -- but forbidden the Seer to write
them, and made him &quot;seal up those things&quot; -- what did
the Angel &quot;standing upon the sea and upon the earth&quot;
do? He lifted his hand to heaven &quot;and sware by him that liveth
for ever and ever . . . . that there <EM>should be time no longer.&quot;
</EM>&quot;But in the days of the voice of the <EM>seventh</EM>
<EM>angel </EM>when he shall begin to sound, the Mystery of God
(of the Cycle) should be finished&quot; (x. 7), which means, in
theosophic phraseology, that when the Seventh Round is completed,
then <EM>Time</EM> will cease. &quot;There shall be time no longer&quot;
very naturally, since <EM>pralaya </EM>shall set in and there
will remain no one on earth to keep a division of time, during
that periodical dissolution and arrest of conscious life.
<P>
Dr. Kenealy and others believed this doctrine of the Rabbins (their
calculations of cyclic seven and forty-nine) to have been brought
by
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The lack of intuition in Orientalists and <EM>antiquarians </EM>past
and present, is remarkable. Thus, Wilson, the translator of <EM>Vishnu
Purana,</EM> declares in his <EM>Preface </EM>that in the <EM>Garuda
Purana</EM> he found &quot;no account of the birth of Garuda.&quot;
Considering that an account of &quot;Creation&quot; in general
is given therein, and that Garuda is co-eternal with Vishnu, the
<EM>Maha Kalpa, </EM>or Great Life-CycIe, beginning with and ending
with the <EM>manifesting</EM> Vishnu, what other account of Garuda's
birth could be expected !
<P>
<EM>** Vide Revelation </EM>xvii., verses 2 and 10; and <EM>Leviticus
</EM>xxiii., verses 15 to 18; the first passage speaking of the
&quot;Seven Kings,&quot; of whom <EM>five</EM> have gone; and
the second about the &quot;Seven Sabbaths,&quot; etc.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 566 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
them from Chaldea. This is more than likely. But the Babylonians,
who had all those cycles and taught them only at their great initiatory
mysteries of astrological magic, got their wisdom and learning
from India. It is not difficult, therefore, to recognize in them
our own esoteric doctrine. In their secret computations, the Japanese
have the same figures in their cycles. As to the Brahmins, their
Puranas and Upanishads are a good proof of it. The latter have
passed entirely into Gnostic literature; and a Brahmin needs only
to read <EM>Pistis Sophia* to</EM> recognize his forefathers'
property, even to the phraseology and similes used. Compare: in
<EM>Pistis Sophia </EM>the disciple says to Jesus: &quot;Rabbi,
reveal unto us the Mysteries of the Light (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the<EM>
&quot;Fire </EM>of Knowledge or Enlightenment&quot;) . . . forasmuch
as we have heard thee saying that <EM>there is another baptism
of smoke, </EM>and another baptism of the Spirit of Holy Light,&quot;
<EM>i.e.</EM>, the Spirit of FIRE. &quot;I baptize you with water,
but . . . . he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
fire,&quot; says John of Jesus (Matt. iii. 2); meaning this esoterically.
The real significance of this statement is very profound. It means
that he, John, a non-initiated ascetic, can impart to his disciples
no greater wisdom than the mysteries connected with the plane
of matter (water being a symbol of it). His <EM>gnosis </EM>was
that of exoteric and ritualistic dogma, of dead-letter orthodoxy;
** while the wisdom which Jesus, an Initiate of the higher mysteries,
would reveal to them, was of a higher character, for it was the
&quot;<STRONG>F</STRONG>IRE&quot; Wisdom of the true gnosis or
the <EM>real spiritual </EM>enlightment. One was <STRONG>F</STRONG>IRE,
the other the <STRONG>S</STRONG>MOKE. For Moses, the <EM>fire</EM>
on Mount Sinai, and the spiritual wisdom imparted; for the multitudes
of the &quot;people&quot; below, for the profane, Mount Sinai
in (<EM>through</EM>)<EM> </EM>smoke<EM>, i.e.</EM>, the exoteric
husks of orthodox or <EM>sectarian ritualism.</EM> 
<P>
Now, having the above in view, read the dialogue between the sages
Narada and Davamata in the <EM>Anugita, </EM>the antiquity and
importance of which MS. (an episode from the Mahabharata) one
can learn in the &quot;Sacred Books of the East,&quot; edited
by Prof. Max Muller.** Narada is discussing upon the breaths or
the &quot;life-winds,&quot; as they are called in
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
<EM>*Pistis Sophia </EM>is an extremely important document, a
genuine <EM>Evangel</EM> of the Gnostics, ascribed at random to
Valentinus, but much more probably a pre-Christian work in its
original. It was discovered in a Coptic MS. by Schwartze, in the
British Museum, quite accidentally, and translated by him into
Latin; after which text and (Latin) version were published by
Petermann in the year 1853. In the text itself the authorship
of this Book is ascribed to Philip the Apostle, whom Jesus bids
to sit down and write the revelation. It is genuine and ought
to be as canonical as any other gospel. Unfortunately it remains
to this day untranslated.
<P>
** In the Cycle of Initiation, which was very long, water represented
the first and lower steps toward purification, while trials connected
with <EM>fire</EM> came last. Water could regenerate the body
of matter; FIRE alone, that of the <EM>inner</EM> Spiritual man.

<P>
the clumsy translations of such words as <EM>Prana, Apana, </EM>etc.,
whose full esoteric meaning and application to individual functions
can hardly be rendered in English. He says of this Science that
&quot;it is the teaching of the Veda <EM>that the fire verily
is all the deities, </EM>and knowledge of it arises among Brahmans,
being accompanied by intelligence.&quot; By &quot;fire,&quot;
says the Commentator, he means the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF. By &quot;intelligence,&quot;
the Occultist says, Narada means neither &quot;discussion&quot;
nor &quot;argumentation,&quot; as Aruna Misra believes, but &quot;intelligence&quot;
truly, or <EM>the adaptation</EM> <EM>of the fire of Wisdom to
Exoteric Ritualism for the profane. </EM>This is the chief concern
of the Brahmans (who were the first to set the example to other
nations who thus anthropomorphized and carnalized the grandest
metaphysical truths). Narada makes it plain and is made to say:
&quot;The <EM>smoke </EM>of that fire, which is of excellent glory,
appears in the shape of darkness&quot; (verily so!); &quot;its
ashes (are) passion; and goodness is that in connection with it
in which the offering is thrown&quot;: <EM>i.e.</EM>, that faculty
in the disciple which apprehends the subtle truth (the flame)
which escapes heavenward, while the objective sacrifice remains
as a proof and <EM>evidence of piety </EM>only to the profane.
For what can Narada mean in teaching that &quot;those who understand
the sacrifice understand the Samana and the Vyana as the <EM>principal
</EM>(offering)&quot;; and &quot;the Prana and Apana, but portions
of the offering . . . and between them <EM>is the fire </EM>.
. . . that is the excellent seat of the Udana as understood by
Brahmanas. As to that which is distinct from these pairs, hear
me speak about that. Day and night are a pair, between them is
the fire. . . That <EM>which exists and that which does not exist
</EM>are a pair, between them is the fire, etc.,&quot; and after
every such contrast Narada adds &quot;That is the excellent seat
of the Udana as understood by Brahmanas.&quot;
<P>
Now many people do not know the full meaning of such terms as
Samana and Vyana, Prana and Apana, explained as being &quot;life-winds&quot;
(we say &quot;principles and their respective faculties and senses&quot;),
being offered up to Udana, the <EM>soi-disant </EM>principal &quot;life
wind,&quot; (?) said to act at all the joints. Therefore the reader,
who is ignorant that the word &quot;fire&quot; means in these
allegories both the &quot;Self&quot; and the higher divine knowledge,
will understand nothing in this; and will therefore entirely miss
the point of our argument, as its translators and even its editor
the great Oxford Sanskritist, Max Muller, has missed the true
meaning of Narada's words. Exoterically, all this enumeration
of &quot;life winds&quot; means, of course, <EM>approximately,
</EM>that which is surmised in the foot-notes; namely, &quot;The
sense appears to be this . . . . worldly life is due to the operations
of the life-winds which are attached to the<STRONG> S</STRONG>ELF,
and lead to its manifestations as individual souls (?). Of these
the Samana and Vyana are controlled and held under check by<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 568 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
the Prana and Apana. . . . The latter two are held in check and
controlled by the Udana, which thus controls all. And the control
of this, which is the control of all five . . . . leads to the
Supreme Self&quot; (p. 259, <EM>Anugita, &quot;Sacred Books of
the East,&quot; </EM>Vol. VIII.)
<P>
The above is given as an explanation of the text, which records
the words of the Brahmana, who narrates how he reached the ultimate
Wisdom of Yogism, and had reached all knowledge in this wise.
Saying that he had &quot;perceived by means of the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF
the seat abiding in the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF,&quot; where dwells
the Brahman free from all; and explaining that that indestructible
principle was entirely <EM>beyond the perception of senses</EM>
(<EM>i.e., </EM>of the five &quot;life-winds&quot;), he adds that
&quot;in the midst of an these (life-winds) which move about in
the body and swallow up one another, blazes the Vaisvanara <EM>fire
sevenfold.&quot; </EM>This &quot;Fire,&quot; according to Nilakantha's
Commentary, is identical with the &quot;I,&quot; the SELF, which
is the goal of the ascetic (Vaisvanara being a word often used
for the <EM>Self</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Then the Brahmana goes on to
enumerate that which is meant by the word &quot;Sevenfold,&quot;
and says, &quot;The nose (or smell), the tongue (taste), the eye,
and the skin, and the ear as the fifth, the mind, and the understanding,
these are the seven tongues of the blaze of Vaisvanara,*. . .
. . those are the seven (kinds of) fuel for me,**. . . . . these
are the <EM>seven</EM> <EM>great officiating priests.&quot;</EM>

<P>
These seven priests are accepted by Arjuna Misra in the sense
of meaning &quot;the soul distinguished as so many (souls, or
principles) with reference to these several powers&quot;; and,
finally, the translator seems to accept the explanation, and reluctantly
admits that &quot;they may mean&quot; this; though he himself
takes the sense to mean &quot;the powers of hearing, etc. (the
physical senses, in short) which are presided over by the several
deities.&quot; (<EM>Vide loc. cit., </EM>p. 259, f.n. 6.)
<P>
But whatever it may mean, whether in scientific or orthodox interpretations,
this passage on page 259 explains Narada's statements on page
276, and shows them referring to exoteric and esoteric methods
and contrasting them. Thus the Samana and the Vyana, though subject
to the Prana and the Apana, and all the four to Udana<EM> </EM>in
the matter of acquiring the Pranayama (of the Hatha-Yogi, chiefly,
or the &quot;lower&quot; form of the Yoga) are yet referred to
as the principal offering, for, as rightly argued by the commentator,
their &quot;operations are more practically important for vitality&quot;;
<EM>i.e., </EM>they are the grossest, and are offered in the sacrifice,
to disappear, so to speak, in the quality of darkness of that
fire or its SMOKE (mere exoteric ritualistic form). But
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
*In the astronomical and cosmical key, Vaisvanara is Agni, son
of the Sun, or Viswanaras, but in the psycho-metaphysical symbolism
it is the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF, in the sense of non-separateness,<EM>
i.e.</EM>, both divine and human.
<P>
**Here the speaker personifies the said divine <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF.
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 569 THE DIVINE SELF'S WISDOM. </H6>

<P>
Prana and Apana, though shown as subordinate (because less gross
or more purified), have the FIRE between them: the Self and the
secret knowledge possessed by that Self. So for the good and evil,
and for &quot;that which exists and that which does not exist&quot;;
all these &quot;pairs&quot;* have fire between them, <EM>i.e.</EM>,
esoteric knowledge, the Wisdom of the divine SELF. Let those who
are satisfied with the <EM>Smoke </EM>of the <STRONG>F</STRONG>IRE
remain wherein they are, that is to say within the Egyptian darkness
of theological fictions and dead-letter interpretations.
<P>
The above is written only for the Western students of Occultism
and Theosophy. The writer presumes to explain these things neither
to the Hindus, who have their own Gurus; nor to the Orientalists,
who think they know more than all the Gurus and Rishis, past and
present, put together. These rather lengthy quotations and examples
cited are necessary, if even to point out to the student the works
he has to study so as to derive benefit and learning from comparison.
Let him read <EM>Pistis Sophia </EM>in the light of the Bhagavatgita,
the Anugita and others; and then the statement made by Jesus in
the Gnostic Gospel will become clear, and the dead letter blinds
disappear at once. Read this and compare with the explanation
from the Hindu scriptures just given. . . . &quot;And no name
is more excellent than all these (seven) vowels. A name wherein
be contained all names, all Lights, and all (the fortynine) powers,
knowing it, if a man quits this body of matter** no <EM>Smoke</EM>

Ruler of the Sphere (no <EM>personal </EM>genius or planetary
spirit called God), or of Fate (<EM>karma</EM>)<EM> </EM>shall

</H6>

<P>
* Compare with these &quot;pairs of opposites,&quot; in the <EM>Anugita</EM>,
the &quot;pairs&quot; of AEons, in the elaborate system of Valentinus,
the most learned and profound master of Gnosis. As the &quot;pairs
of opposites,&quot; male and female, are all derived from <EM>Akasa</EM>
(undeveloped and developed, differentiated and undifferentiated,
or <STRONG>S</STRONG>ELF or Prajapati), so are the Valentinian
&quot;pairs&quot; of male and female AEons shown to emanate from
Bythos, the pre-existing <EM>eternal</EM> Depth, and in their
secondary emanation from Ampsiu-Ouraan (or sempiternal Depth and
Silence), the second Logos. In the esoteric emanation there are
seven chief &quot;pairs of opposites&quot;; and so also in the
Valentinian system there were fourteen, or twice seven. Epiphanius,
copying incorrectly, &quot;copied one pair twice over,&quot; Mr.
C. W. King thinks, &quot;and thus adds one pair to the proper
fifteen.&quot; (&quot;The Gnostics,&quot; etc., pp. 263-4.) Here
King falls into the opposite error: the pairs of AEons are not
15 (a blind) but 14, as the <EM>first </EM>AEon is <EM>that</EM>
from which others emanate, Depth and Silence being the first and
only emanation from Bythos. As Hippolytus shows: &quot;The AEons
of Valentinus are confessedly the <EM>Six Radicals </EM>of Simon
(Magus),&quot; with the <EM>seventh</EM>, Fire, at their head.
And these are: Mind, Intelligence, Voice, Name, Reason and Thought
subordinate to FIRE, the higher self, or precisely the &quot;Seven
Winds&quot; or the &quot;Seven Priests&quot; of Anugita.

shall utter that (Name) unto the fire, the darkness shall flee
away. . . And if he shall utter that name unto . . . all their
Powers, nay, even unto Barbelo,* <EM>the Invisible God, </EM>and
the triple-powered Gods, so soon as he shall have uttered that
name in those places, they shall all be shaken and thrown one
upon the other, so that they shall be ready to melt, perish and
disappear, and shall cry aloud, 'O, Light of all Lights that art
in the Boundless Light, remember us also and purify us!' &quot;

It is easy to see who this Light and Name are: the light of Initiation
and the name of the &quot;Fire-Self,&quot; which is no name, no
action, but a Spiritual, ever-living Power, higher even than the
&quot;Invisible God,&quot; as this Power is <STRONG>I</STRONG>TSELF.
<P>
But if the able and learned author of the &quot;Gnostics and their
Remains&quot; has not sufficiently allowed for the Spirit of allegory
and mysticism in the fragments translated and quoted by him, in
the above named work, from <EM>Pistis Sophia -- </EM>other Orientalists
have done far worse. Having neither his intuitional perception
of the Indian origin of the Gnostic Wisdom still more than of
their &quot;gems,&quot; most of them, beginning with Wilson and
ending with the dogmatic Weber, have made most extraordinary blunders
with regard to almost every symbol. Sir M. Monier Williams and
others show a very decided contempt for the &quot;Esoteric Buddhists&quot;
as theosophists are now called; yet no Student of Occult philosophy
has ever mistaken a cycle for a living personage and <EM>vice
versa, </EM>as was very often the case with our learned Orientalists.
An instance or two may illustrate the statement more graphically.
Let us choose the best known.
<P>
In the Ramayana, Garuda is called &quot;the maternal uncle of
Sagara's 60,000 sons&quot;; and Ansumat, Sagara's grandson, &quot;the
nephew of the 60,000 uncles&quot; reduced to ashes by the look
of Kapila, &quot;the Purushottama&quot; (or infinite Spirit),
who caused Sagara's horse for the Aswamedha sacrifice to disappear.
Again, Garuda's son** -- Garuda being himself the<EM> Maha-Kalpa
</EM>or great cycle -- Jatayu, the king of the feathered tribe,
when on the point of being slain by Ravana who carries off Sita
-- says, speaking of himself:
<P>
&quot;It is 60,000 years O King, that I am born,&quot; after which
<EM>turning his</EM> <EM>back on the Sun -- </EM>he dies.
<P>
Jatayu is, of course, the cycle of 60,000 years within the great
cycle of GARUDA; hence he is represented as his son, or nephew,
<EM>ad libitum,</EM>

*Barbelo is one of the three &quot;Invisible Gods,&quot; and,
as C. W. King believes, includes &quot;the Divine Mother of the
Saviour,&quot; or rather Sophia Achamoth (<EM>Vide </EM>cap. 359).

** In other <EM>Puranas</EM> Jatayu is the son of Aruna, Garuda's
brother, both the Sons of Kasyapa. But all this is external allegory.

<P>
since the whole meaning rests in his being placed on the line
of Garuda's descendants. Then, again, there is Diti -- the Mother
of the Maruts -- whose descendants and progeny belonged to the
posterity of Hiranyaksha, &quot;whose number was 77 crores (or
770 millions) of men.&quot; (See <EM>Padma Purana.</EM>)<EM> </EM>All
such narratives are pronounced <EM>meaningless fictions</EM> and
absurdities. But -- Truth is the daughter of Time, verily; and
time will show.
<P>
Meanwhile, what could be easier than an attempt, at least, to
verify Puranic chronology? There are many Kapilas; but the Kapila
who slew King Sagara's progeny -- 60,000 men strong -- was undeniably
Kapila, the founder of the Sankhya philosophy, since it is so
stated in the Puranas; although one of them flatly denies the
imputation without explaining its esoteric meaning. It is the
Bhagavata Purana (IX. viii., 12 and 13), which says that &quot;the
report that the sons of the King were reduced to ashes <EM>by
the mere glance of the sage</EM> is not true.&quot; &quot;For,&quot;
as it argues, &quot;how can the quality of darkness, the product
of anger, exist in a sage whose goodness was the essence that
purified the world -- the earth's dust, as it were, attributed
to Heavens! How should mental perturbation distract that sage,
identified with the Supreme Spirit, and who has steered here (on
earth) that solid vessel of the Sankhya (philosophy), with the
help of which he who desires to obtain liberation crosses the
dreaded ocean of existence, that path to death?&quot;
<P>
The Purana is in duty bound to speak as it does. It has a dogma
to promulgate and a policy to carry out -- that of great secrecy
with regard to mystical <EM>divine</EM> truths divulged for countless
ages only at initiation. It is not in the Puranas, therefore,
that we have to look for an explanation of the mystery connected
with various transcendental states of being. That the story is
an allegory is seen upon its very face: the 60,000<EM> Sons, </EM>brutal,
vicious, and impious, are the personification of the <EM>human
passions </EM>that a &quot;mere glance of the sage&quot; -- the
SELF who represents the highest state of purity that can be reached
on earthreduces to ashes. But it has also other significations
-- cyclic and chronological meanings, -- a method of marking the
periods when certain sages flourished, found also in other Puranas.
<P>
Now it is as well ascertained as any tradition can be, that it
was at Hardwar (or <EM>Gangadwara, </EM>the &quot;door or gate
of the Ganges&quot;) at the foot of the Himalayas, that Kapila
sat in meditation for a number of years. Not far from the Sewalik
range, the &quot;pass of Hardwar&quot; is called to this day &quot;Kapila's
Pass&quot;; and the place, &quot;Kapilasthen,&quot; by the ascetics.
It is there that <EM>Ganga </EM>(Ganges) emerging from its mountainous
gorge, begins its course over the sultry plains of India. And
it is as clearly ascertained by geological survey that the tradition
which claims that the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 572 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
ocean ages ago washed the base of the Himalayas -- is not entirely
without foundation, for there are traces left of this.
<P>
The Sankhya philosophy may have been <EM>brought down </EM>and
taught by the first, and written out by the <EM>last </EM>Kapila.
<P>
Now<EM> Sagara </EM>is the name of the Ocean, and even of the
Bay of Bengal, at the mouth of the Ganges, to this day in India
(<EM>Vide</EM> Wilson's Vishnu Purana, Vol. III. p. 309). Have
geologists ever calculated the number of millenniums it has taken
the sea to recede to where it is now, from Hardwar, 1,024 feet
above the level of the sea at present? If they did, those Orientalists
who show Kapila flourishing from the 1st to the 9th cent. A.D.,
might change their opinions, if only for one of two very good
reasons: the true number of years elapsed since Kapila's day is
in the Puranas unmistakably, though the translators fail to see
it. And secondly -- the Kapila of the Satya, and the Kapila of
the Kali-Yugas <EM>may be one</EM> <EM>and the same </EM>INDIVIDUALITY,<EM>
without being the same </EM>PERSONALITY.
<P>
Kapila, besides being the name of a personage, of the once living
Sage and the author of Sankhya philosophy, is also the generic
name of the Kumaras, the celestial ascetics and virgins; therefore
the very fact of Bhagavata Purana calling <EM>that </EM>Kapila
-- which it showed just before as a<EM> portion of Vishnu -- </EM>the
author of Sankhya philosophy, ought to have warned the reader
of a <EM>blind</EM> containing an esoteric meaning. Whether the
Son of Vitatha, as Harivansa shows him to be, or of anyone else,
the author of Sankhya cannot be the same as the Sage of the SatyaYuga
-- at the very beginning of the Manvantara, when Vishnu is shown
<EM>in the form of Kapila, &quot;imparting to all creatures true
Wisdom&quot;; </EM>for this relates to that primordial period
when &quot;the Sons of God&quot; taught to the just created men
the arts and sciences, which have been cultivated and preserved
since then in the sanctuaries by the Initiates. There are several
well-known Kapilas in the Puranas. First the primeval sage, then
Kapila, one of the three &quot;Secret&quot; Kumaras; and Kapila,
son of Kasyapa and Kadru -- the &quot;many-headed Serpent,&quot;
(See <EM>Vayu Purana</EM> placing him on the list of the forty
renowned sons of Kasyapa), besides Kapila, the great sage and
philosopher of the Kali Yuga. Being an Initiate, &quot;a Serpent
of Wisdom,&quot; a Naga, the latter was purposely blended with
the Kapilas of the former ages. <HR>
