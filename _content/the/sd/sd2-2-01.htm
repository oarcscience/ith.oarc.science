&quot;The narratives of the Doctrine are its cloak. The simple
look only at the garment -- that is, upon the narrative of the
Doctrine; more they know not. The instructed, however, see not
merely the cloak, but what the cloak covers.<BR>

--------
<H4>ESOTERIC TENETS CORROBORATED IN EVERY<BR>
SCRIPTURE.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>I</STRONG>N view of the strangeness of the teachings,
and of many a doctrine which from the modern scientific stand-point
must seem absurd, some necessary and additional explanations have
to be made. The theories contained in the Second Part of the Stanzas
are even more difficult to assimilate than those which are embodied
in Vol. 1, on Cosmogony. Theology, therefore, has to be questioned
here, as Science will be in the <EM>Addenda </EM>(Part <STRONG>III</STRONG>.).
Since our doctrines differ so widely from the current ideas of
both Materialism and Theology, the Occultists must be ever prepared
to repel the attacks of either or of both.
<P>
The reader can never be too often reminded that, as the abundant
quotations from various old Scriptures prove, these teachings
are as old as the world; and that the present work is a simple
attempt to render, in modern language and in a phraseology with
which the scientific and educated student is familiar, archaic
Genesis and History as taught in certain Asiatic centres of esoteric
learning. They must be accepted or rejected on their own merits,
fully or partially; but not before they have been carefully compared
with the corresponding theological dogmas and the modern scientific
theories and speculations.
<P>
One feels a serious doubt whether, with all its intellectual acuteness,
our age is destined to discover in each western nation even one
solitary <EM>uninitiated </EM>scholar or philosopher capable of
fully comprehending the spirit of archaic philosophy. Nor can
one be expected to do so, before the real meaning of these terms,
the Alpha and the <EM>Omega </EM>of Eastern esotericism, the words
<EM>Sat</EM> and <EM>Asat, -- </EM>so<EM> </EM>freely used in
the Rig-Veda, and elsewhere -- is thoroughly assimilated. Without
this key to the Aryan Wisdom, the Cosmogony of the Rishis and
the Arhats is in danger of remaining a dead letter to the average
Orientalist. <EM>Asat is</EM><I> </I>not merely the negation of
<EM>Sat, </EM>nor is it the &quot;not yet existing&quot;; for
<EM>Sat</EM> is in itself neither the &quot;existent,&quot; nor
&quot;being.&quot; <STRONG>S</STRONG>AT is the immutable, the
ever present, changeless and eternal root, from and through which
all proceeds. But it is far more than the potential force in the
seed, which propels onward the process of development, or what
is now called evolution. It is the ever becoming, though the never
manifesting.* <EM>Sat</EM> 
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The Hegelian doctrine, which identifies <EM>Absolute Being </EM>or
&quot;Be-ness&quot; with &quot;non-Being,&quot; and represents
the Universe as an <EM>eternal becoming, </EM>is identical with
the Vedanta philosophy. <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 450 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
is born from <EM>Asat</EM>, and <STRONG>A</STRONG>SAT is begotten
by <EM>Sat: </EM>the perpetual motion in a circle, truly; yet
a circle that can be squared only at the supreme Initiation, at
the threshold of Paranirvana.
<P>
Barth started a reflection on the <EM>Rig-Veda </EM>which was
meant for a stern criticism, an unusual, therefore, as was thought,
an original view of this archaic volume. It so happened, however,
that, while criticising, that scholar revealed a truth, without
being himself aware of its full importance. He premises by saying
that &quot;neither in the language nor in the thought of the Rig-Veda&quot;
has he &quot;been able to discover that quality <EM>of primitive
natural simplicity, </EM>which so many are fain to see in it.&quot;
Barth had Max Muller in his mind's eye when writing this. For
the famous Oxford professor has throughout characterised the hymns
of the Rig Veda, as the unsophisticated expression of the religious
feeling of a pastoral innocent people. &quot;In the Vedic hymns
the ideas and myths appear in their simplest and freshest form;&quot;
-- the Sanskrit scholar thinks. Barth is of a different opinion,
however.
<P>
So divided and personal are the opinions of Sanskritists as to
the importance and intrinsic value of the Rig Veda, that those
opinions become entirely biassed whichever way they incline. Thus
Mr. Max Muller declares that: &quot;Nowhere is the wide distance
which separates the ancient poems of India from the most ancient
literature of Greece more clearly felt, than when we compare the
growing myths of the Veda with the full grown and decayed myths
on which the poetry of Homer is founded. The Veda is the real
Theogony of the <EM>Aryan races,</EM> while that of Hesiod is
a distorted caricature of the original image.&quot; This is a
sweeping assertion, and perhaps rather unjust in its general application.
But why not try to account for it? Orientalists cannot do so,
for they reject the chronology of the Secret Doctrine, and could
hardly admit the fact that between the Rig-Vedic hymns and Hesiod's
Theogony tens of thousands of years have elapsed. So they fail
to see that the Greek myths are no longer the primitive symbolical
language of the Initiates, the disciples of the gods-Hierophants,
the divine ancient &quot;sacrificers,&quot; and that disfigured
by the distance, and encumbered by the exuberant growth of human
<EM>profane</EM> fancy, they now stand like distorted images of
stars in running waves. But if Hesiod's Cosmogony and Theogony
are to be viewed as caricatures of the original images, how much
more so the myths in the Hebrew <EM>Genesis </EM>in the sight
of those, for whom they are no more divine revelation or the word
of God, than Hesiod's Theogony is for Mr. Gladstone.
<P>
&quot;The poetry it (the Rig Veda) contains appears to me, on
the contrary,&quot; says Barth &quot;to be of a singularly <EM>refined</EM>
character and<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 451 THE VEDAS WRITTEN BY INITIATES.</H6>

<P>
artificially elaborated, <EM>full of allusions and reticences,
</EM>of<EM> pretensions</EM> (?) to mysticism and theosophic insight,
and the manner of its expression is such as reminds one more frequently
of the phraseology in use <EM>among</EM> <EM>certain small groups
of initiated, </EM>than the poetic language of a large community.&quot;
(&quot;<EM>The Religions of India,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>p. xiii.)
<P>
We will not stop to enquire of the critic what he can know of
the phraseology in use among the &quot;initiated,&quot; or whether
he belongs himself to such a group; for, in the latter case, he
would hardly have used such language. But the above shows the
remarkable disagreement between scholars even with regard to the
<EM>external</EM> character of the Rig Veda. What, then, can any
of the modern Sanskritists know about its <EM>internal </EM>or
esoteric meaning, beyond the correct inference of Barth, that
<EM>this Scripture has been compiled by </EM><STRONG>I</STRONG>NITIATES?
<P>
The whole of the present work is an endeavour to prove this truth.
The ancient adepts have solved the great problems of science,
however unwilling modern materialism may be to admit the fact.
The mysteries of Life and Death <EM>were</EM> fathomed by the
great master-minds of antiquity; and if they have preserved them
in secresy and silence, it is because these problems formed part
of the sacred mysteries; and, secondly, because they must have
remained incomprehensible to the vast majority of men then, as
they do now. If such teachings are still regarded as chimeras
by our opponents in philosophy, it may be a consolation to the
Theosophists to learn, on good proofs, that the speculations of
modern psychologists -- whether serious Idealists, like Mr. Herbert
Spencer, or wool-gathering pseudo-Idealists -- are far more chimerical.
Indeed, instead of resting on the firm foundation of facts in
Nature, they are the unhealthy will-o'-the-wisps of materialistic
imagination, of the brains that evolved them -- and no more. While
they deny, we affirm; and our affirmation is corroborated by almost
all the sages of antiquity. Believing in Occultism and a host
of invisible Potencies for good reasons, we say: <EM>Certus sum,
scio quod credidi; </EM>to which our critics reply: <EM>Credat
Judaeus Apella. </EM>Neither is converted by the other, nor does
such result affect even our little planet. <EM>E pur se muove!</EM>

<P>
Nor is there any need of proselytizing. As remarked by the wise
Cicero, &quot;Time destroys the speculations of man, but it confirms
the judgment of nature.&quot; Let us bide our time. Meanwhile,
it is not in the human constitution to witness in silence the
destruction of one's gods, whether they be true or false. And
as theology and materialism have combined together to destroy
the old gods of antiquity and seek to disfigure every old philosophical
conception, it is but just that the lovers of old wisdom should
defend their position, by proving that the whole arsenal of the
two is, at best, formed of new weapons made out of very old material.
