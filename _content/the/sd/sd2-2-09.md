### ยง XXII.

#### THE SYMBOLISM OF THE MYSTERY-NAMES IAO AND JEHOVAH, WITH THEIR RELATION TO THE CROSS AND CIRCLE.

**W**HEN the Abbe Louis Constant -- known as Eliphas Levi -- said in his
*Histoire de la Magie* that the *"Sepher Jezirah,* the *Zohar,* and the
Apocalypse (of St. John) are the master-pieces of the Occult Sciences,"
he ought, if he wanted to be correct and clear, to have added, "in
Europe." It is quite true that these works contain "more *significance*
than words"; and that "its expression is poetical, while in numbers it
is exact." Unfortunately, before any one can appreciate the *poetry* of
the expressions, or the *exactness* of the numbers, he will have to
learn the real significance and meaning of the terms and symbols used.
And man will never learn this so long as he remains ignorant of the
fundamental principle of the *Secret* Doctrine, whether in Oriental
Esotericism, or in the Kabalistical symbology: -- the *key, or value, in
all their aspects,* *of the "God"-names, "Angel"-names, and
"Patriarchal" names in the* *Bible* -- their mathematical or geometrical
value, and their relations to manifested nature.

Therefore, if, on the one hand, the *Zohar* "astonishes (the mystic) by
the profundity of its views and the great simplicity of its images," on
the other hand, that work misleads the student by such expressions as
those used with respect to **A**IN-**S**OPH and *Jehovah,*
notwithstanding the assurance that "the book is careful to explain that
the human form with which it clothes God is but *an image of the word,*
and that God should not be expressed by any thought, or any form." It is
well known that Origen, Clemens, and the Rabbis confessed, with regard
to the Kabala and the Bible, to their being *veiled* and *secret Books;*
but few know that the esotericism of the Kabalistic books in their
present *re-edited* form is simply another and still more cunning veil
thrown upon the primitive symbolism of these secret volumes.

The idea of representing the *hidden* deity by the circumference of a
Circle, and the Creative Power (male and female, or the Androgynous
**W**ORD), by the diameter across it, is one of the oldest symbols. It
is upon this conception that every great Cosmogony was built. With the
old Aryans, the Egyptians, and the Chaldeans, it was complete, as it
embraced the idea of the eternal and immovable *Divine Thought* in its
absoluteness, separated entirely from the incipient stage of (the
so-called)

*creation;* and comprised psychological and even Spiritual evolution,
and its mechanical work, or cosmogonical construction. With the Hebrews,
however, though the former conception is to be distinctly found in the
Zohar, and the Sepher Jezirah -- or what remains of the latter -- that
which has been embodied subsequently in the *Pentateuch* proper, and
especially in *Genesis,* is simply this secondary stage, to wit, the
mechanical law of creation, or rather of construction; while theogony is
hardly, if at all, outlined.

It is only in the first six chapters of *Genesis,* in the rejected *Book
of* *Enoch,* and the misunderstood and mistranslated poem of *Job,* that
true echoes of the archaic doctrine may now be found. The key to it is
lost, even among the most learned Rabbis, whose predecessors in the
early period of the middle ages have preferred, in their national
exclusiveness and pride, and especially in their profound hatred of
Christianity, to cast it into the deep sea of oblivion, rather than to
share their knowledge with their relentless and fierce persecutors.
Jehovah was their own tribal property, inseparable from, and unfit to
play a part in, any other but the Mosaic Law. Violently torn out of his
original frame, which he fitted and which fitted him, the "lord god of
Abraham and Jacob" could hardly be crammed without damage and breakage
into the new Christian Canon. Being the weakest, the Judeans could not
help the desecration; but they kept the secret of the origin of their
Adam Kadmon, or male-female Jehovah; and the new tabernacle proved a
complete misfit for the old god: they were, indeed, avenged!

The statement that Jehovah was the tribal god of the Jews and no higher,
will be denied like many other things. Yet the theologians are not in a
position to tell us, in that case, the meaning of verses 8 and 9 in
Deuteronomy, chapter xxxii. These verses say quite plainly: "When the
**M**OST **H**IGH (not the "Lord," or "Jehovah" either) divided to the
nations their inheritance, when he separated the Sons of Adam he set the
bounds . . . according to the number of the children of Israel. . . .
*The Lord's* (Jehovah's) *portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of
his* *inheritance."* This settles the question. So impudent were the
modern translators of Bibles and Scriptures and so damaging are these
verses, that, following in the steps traced for them by their worthy
Church Fathers, each translator rendered these verses in his own way.
While the above-cited quotation is taken *verbatim* from the authorized
English version, in the French Bible (of the *Protestant Biblical
Society* of Paris, according to the version revised in 1824 by J. E.
Ostervald) one finds the "Most High" translated by *Souverain* (a
Sovereign!!), the "sons of Adam" rendered by "the children of men," and
the "Lord" changed into the "Eternal." For impudent sleight-of-hand, the
French Protestant Church seems thus to have surpassed even English
ecclesiasticism.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 538 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

Nevertheless, one thing is patent: the "Lord's ("Jehovah's") portion" is
his "chosen people" and none else, for, *Jacob alone is the lot of his*
*inheritance.* What, then, have other nations, who call themselves
Aryans, to do with this Semitic deity, the tribal god of Israel?
Astronomically, the "Most High" is the Sun, and the "Lord" is one of his
seven planets, whether it be *Iao,* the genius of the moon, or
Ilda-Baoth-Jehovah, that of Saturn, according to Origen and the Egyptian
Gnostics.\* Let the "Angel Gabriel," the "Lord" of Iran, watch over his
people; and Michael-Jehovah, over his Hebrews. These are not the gods of
other nations, nor were they ever those of Jesus. As each Persian *Dev*
is chained to his planet (see Origen's Copy of the Chart), so each Hindu
Deva (a "Lord") has its allotted portion, a world, a planet, a nation or
a race. Plurality of worlds implies plurality of gods. We believe in the
former, and may recognize, but will never worship, the latter. (*Vide*
Part **III**., "On Chains of Worlds and their Plurality.")

It has been repeatedly stated in this work that every religious and
philosophical symbol had seven meanings attached to it, each pertaining
to its legitimate plane of thought, *i.e.*, either purely metaphysical
or astronomical; psychic or physiological, etc., etc. These seven
meanings and their applications are hard enough to learn when taken by
themselves; but the interpretation and the right comprehension of them
become tenfold more puzzling, when, instead of being correlated, or made
to flow consecutively out of and to follow each other, each, or any one
of these meanings is accepted as the one and sole explanation of the
whole symbolical idea. An instance may be given, as it admirably
illustrates the statement. Here are two interpretations given by two
learned Kabalists and scholars, of one and the same verse in *Exodus,*
xxxiii, 18-23. Moses beseeches the Lord to show him his "glory."
Evidently it is not the crude dead letter phraseology as found in the
Bible that is to be accepted. There are *seven* meanings in the Kabala,
of which we may give two as interpreted by the said two scholars. One of
them quotes, while explaining: "Thou canst not see my face . . . I will
put thee in the cleft of the rock . . . cover thee with my hand while I
pass by. And then I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my
*a'hoor,* my back; . . " and tells us in a gloss, "That is, I will show
you 'My back,' *i.e.*, my visible universe, my lower manifestations,
but, as a man still in the flesh, thou canst not

the Seven (*Vide* "Book of the Dead"). Their names are given by Origen,
as *Adonai* (of the Sun) *Iao* (of the Moon), *Eloi* (Jupiter)*, Sabao*
(Mars)*, Orai* (Venus), *Astapkoi* (Mercury), and, finally, *Ildabaoth*
(Saturn).

see my invisible nature. So proceeds the Qabbalah." This is correct, and
is the cosmo-metaphysical explanation. And now speaks the other
Kabalist, giving the numerical meaning. As it involves a good many
suggestive ideas, and is far more fully given, we may allow it more
space. This synopsis is from an unpublished **MS**., and explains more
fully what was given in ยง **XVII**, "The Holy of Holies," page 467.

The numbers of the name Moses are those of "**I** AM THAT **I** AM," so
that the names Moses and Jehovah are at one in numerical harmony.

The word Moses is ![](sd2-539.gif) and the sum of the values of its
letters is 345; Jehovah -- the genius *par excellence* of the lunar year
-- assumes the value of 543, or the reverse of 345. . . . In the third
chapter of Exodus, in the 13th and 14th verses, it is said: And Moses
said . . . Behold when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say
unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall
say, What is his name? What shall I say unto them? and God said unto
Moses -- "I am that I am."

The Hebrew words for this expression are *ahiye asher ahiye,* and in the
value of the sums of their letters stand thus:--

![](sd2-468e.gif)

. . . This being his (God's) name, the sum of the values composing it
are 21, 501, 21 are 543, or simply a use of the simple digit numbers in
the name of Moses . . . but now so ordered that the name of 345 is
reversed, and reads 543. . . . So that when Moses asks "Let me see Thy
face or glory," the other rightly and truly replies "Thou canst not see
my face" . . . but thou *shalt see me behind --* (the true sense, though
not the precise words); because the comer and the *behind* of 543 is the
*face* of 345 -- "for check and to keep a *strict use* of a set of
numbers to develop certain *grand* results, for the object of which they
are specifically employed." "In other uses," adds the learned Kabalist,
"of the number they saw each other face to face. It is strange that if
we add 345 to 543 we have 888, which was the gnostic Kabalistic value of
the name Christ, who was Jehoshua or Joshua. And so also the division of
the 24 hours of the day gives three eights as quotient. . . . The chief
end of all this system of number checks was to preserve in perpetuity
the exact value of the Lunar year in the natural measure of days."

This is the astronomical and numerical meaning in the secret theogony of
sidereo-cosmical gods invented by the Chaldeo-Hebrews,

and two meanings out of seven. The other five would astonish the
Christians still more.

The series of OEdipuses who have endeavoured to interpret the riddle of
the Sphinx, is long indeed. For many ages she has been devouring the
brightest and the noblest intellects of Christendom; but now the Sphinx
is conquered. In the great intellectual struggle which has ended in the
complete victory of the OEdipuses of Symbolism, it is not the Sphinx,
however, who, burning with the shame of defeat, has had to bury herself
in the sea, but verily the many-sided symbol, named Jehovah, whom
Christians -- the *civilized* nations -- have accepted for their God.
The latter has collapsed under the too close analysis, and is --
drowned. Symbologists have discovered with dismay that their adopted
deity was only a mask for many other gods, an *Euhemerized* extinct
planet, at best, the genius of the Moon and Saturn with the Jews, of the
Sun and Jupiter, with early Christians; that the Trinity was, in truth,
only an astronomical triad -- unless they accepted the more abstract and
metaphysical meanings given to it by the Gentiles -- composed of the Sun
(the Father), and the two planets Mercury (the Son) and Venus (the Holy
Ghost*, Sophia,* the Spirit of Wisdom, Love and Truth, and Lucifer, as
Christ, the bright and morning Star; *vide "Revelation," ch.* xxii.,
15). Because, if the Father is the Sun (the elder Brother in the Eastern
*inner* philosophy), the nearest planet to it is Mercury (Hermes, Budha,
Thot), the name of whose mother on Earth was Maia; the planet which
receives seven times more light than any other: which fact led the
Gnostics to call their Christos, and the Kabalists their Hermes (in the
astronomical meaning), the "seven-fold light" (*vide at end of this*
ยง)*.* Finally, *this* God was Bel; the Sun being "Bel," with the Gauls,
"Helios" with the Greeks, "Baal," with the Phoenicians; "El" in
Chaldean, hence "EL-ohim," "Emanu-EL," *El*, "god," in Hebrew. But even
the Kabalistic god has vanished in the rabbinical workmanship, and one
has now to turn to the innermost metaphysical sense of the *Zohar* to
find in it anything like Ain-Soph, the nameless deity and the Absolute,
so authoritatively and loudly claimed by the Christians. But it is
certainly not to be found in the Mosaic books, by those who try to read
without a Key to them. Ever since it was lost Jews and Christians have
tried their best to blend these two conceptions, but in vain. They have
only succeeded in finally robbing even the Universal Deity of **I**TS
majestic character and primitive meaning.

The Cross, say the Kabalists, repeating the lesson of the Occultists, is
one of the most ancient -- nay, perhaps, the *most* ancient of symbols.
This is demonstrated at the very beginning of the *Proem* (Vol. I.). The
Eastern Initiates show it coeval with the circle of Deific infinitude
and the first differentiation of the Essence, the union of spirit and
matter. This was rejected, and the astronomical allegory alone was
accepted and made to fit into cunningly imagined terrestrial events.

Let us demonstrate this statement. In astronomy, as said, Mercury is the
son of Coelus and Lux -- of the sky and light, or the Sun; in mythology
he is the progeny of Jupiter and Maia. He is the "messenger" of his
Father Jupiter, the Messiah of the Sun; in Greek, his name "Hermes,"
means, among other things, the "Interpreter" -- the "Word" by mouth; the
LOGOS, or VERBUM. Now, Mercury, besides being born on Mount Cyllene
among shepherds, is the patron of the

latter. A psychopompic genius, he conducted the souls of the dead to
Hades and brought them back, an office attributed to Jesus, after his
death and resurrection. The symbols of Hermes-Mercury (*Dii* *Termini*)
were placed along and at the turning points of highways (as crosses are
now placed in Italy) and *they were cruciform.\** Every seventh day the
priests anointed these *termini* with oil, and once a year hung them
with garlands, hence they were the *anointed.* Mercury, when speaking
through his oracles said, "I am he whom you call the Son of the Father
(Jupiter) and Maia. Leaving the King of Heaven (the Sun) I come to help
you, mortals." Mercury heals the blind and restores sight, mental and
physical.\*\* He was often represented as three-headed and called
"Tricephalos," "Triplex," as one with the Sun and Venus. Finally,
Mercury, as Cornutus\*\*\* shows, was sometimes figured under a cubic
form, without arms, because "the power of speech and eloquence can
prevail without the assistance of arms or feet." It is this cubic form
which connects the *termini* directly with the cross, and the eloquence
or the power of speech of Mercury, which made the crafty Eusebius say
"Hermes is the emblem of the Word which creates and interprets all," for
it is the *creative* word; and he shows Porphyry teaching that the
speech of Hermes, (now interpreted *"Word of* *God"* (!) in Pymander) a
creative speech (*Verbum*)*,* is the seminal principle scattered
throughout the Universe.\*\*\*\* In Alchemy "Mercury" is the radical
*Moyst,* primitive or elementary water, containing the seed of the
Universe, fecundated by the solar fires. To express this fecundating
principle, a phallus was often added to the cross (the male and female,
or the vertical and the horizontal united) by the Egyptians (*Vide*
Egyptian Museums). The cruciform *termini* also represented this dual
idea, which was found in Egypt in the *cubic* Hermes. The author of
"Source of Measures" tells us why. (But see the last page of ยง **XVI**.,
about the Gnostic Priapus).

As shown by him, the cube unfolded becomes in display a cross of the
*tau,* or the Egyptian, form; or again, "the circle attached to the
*tau* gives the ansated cross" of the old Pharaohs. They had known this
from their priests and their "Kings Initiates" for ages, and also what
was meant by "the attachment of a man to the cross," which idea "was
made to co-ordinate with that of the origin of human life, and hence the
*phallic form."* Only the latter came into action aeons and ages after
the idea of the carpenter and artificer of the Gods,

Visvakarma, crucifying the "Sun-Initiate" on the cruciform lathe. As the
same author writes: *"the attachment of a man to the cross* . . . was
made use of in this very form of display by the Hindus"; but, made "to
co-ordinate" with the idea of the new rebirth of man by *spiritual,* not
physical regeneration. The candidate for initiation was attached to the
*tau* or astronomical cross with a far grander and nobler idea than that
of the origin of mere *terrestrial* life*.*

On the other hand, the Semites seem to have had no other or higher
purpose in life than that of procreating their species. Thus,
geometrically, and according to the reading of the Bible by means of the
numerical method, the author of the "Hebrew-Egyptian Mystery" is quite
correct. *Their* (the Jewish) entire system --

Thus, on the very showing of the defenders of this system the Jewish
Deity is proved to be, at best, only the manifested *duad*, never the
One absolute **A**LL. Geometrically demonstrated, he is a NUMBER;
symbolically, an *euhemerized* Priapus; and this can hardly satisfy a
mankind thirsting after the demonstration of real spiritual truths, and
the possession of a god with a divine, not anthropomorphic, nature. It
is strange that the most learned of modem Kabalists can see in the cross
and circle nothing but a symbol of the manifested *creative* and
*androgyne* deity in its relation to, and interference with, this
phenomenal world.\* One author believes that "man (read the Jew and
Rabbi) obtained knowledge of the practical measure . . . . by which
nature was thought to adjust the planets in size to harmonize with the
notation of their movements" . . . . and adds: "it seems he did obtain
it, and esteemed its possession as the means of his realization of the
Deity -- that is, he approached *so nearly to a conception of a Being
having a mind like his own,* only infinitely more powerful, as to be
able to realize *a law of creation*

established by that Being, which must have existed prior to any creation
(Kabalistically called the *Word*) *"* (*"Source of Measures,"* p*.* 5).

This may have satisfied the practical *Semite* mind, but the Eastern
Occultist has to decline the offer of *such* a God; indeed, a Deity, a
Being, "having a mind like that of man, only infinitely more powerful,"
is *no* God that has any room *beyond* the cycle of creation. He has
nought to do with the *ideal* conception of the eternal universe. He is,
at best, one of the *creative subordinate* powers, the Totality of which
is called the "Sephiroth," the "Heavenly Man," and Adam Kadmon, the
*second* *logos* of the Platonists.

This very same idea is clearly found at the bottom of the ablest
definitions of the Kabala and its mysteries, *e.g*., by John A. Parker,
as quoted in the same work: --

> "The key of the Kabala is *thought to be the geometrical relation of
> the area of* *the circle inscribed in the square,* or, of the cube to
> the sphere, giving rise to the relation of diameter to circumference
> of a circle with the numerical value of this relation expressed in

> of a diameter value in terms, or in the denomination of the
> circumference value of the perfect circle, or a unit straight line
> having a perfect circular value, or a factor of circular value" (p.
> 22).

Such calculations can lead one no further than to unriddle the mysteries
of the *third* stage of Evolution, or the "third creation of Brahma."
The initiated Hindus know how to "square the circle" far better than any
European. But of this more anon. The fact is that the Western Mystics
commence their speculation only at that stage when the universe "falls
into matter," as the occultists say. Throughout the whole series of
Kabalistic books we have not met with one sentence that would hint in
the remotest way at the psychological and spiritual, as well as at the
mechanical and *physiological* secrets of "creation." Shall we, then,
regard the evolution of the Universe as simply a prototype, on a
gigantic scale, of the act of procreation? as "divine" *Phallicism,* and
rhapsodize on it as the evilly-inspired author of a late work of this
name has done? The writer does not think so. And she feels justified in
saying so, since the most careful reading of the Old Testament --
esoterically, as well as exoterically -- seems to have carried the most
enthusiastic enquirers no further than a certainty on mathematical
grounds that from the first to the last chapter of the *Pentateuch*
every scene, every character or event are shown connected, directly or
indirectly, with the *origin of birth* in its crudest and most

brutal form. Thus, however interesting and ingenious the rabbinical
methods, the writer, in common with other Eastern Occultists, must
prefer those of the Pagans.

It is not, then, in the Bible that we have to search for the origin of
the Cross and Circle, but beyond the Flood. Therefore, returning to
Eliphas Levi and the Zohar, we answer for the Eastern Occultists and say
that, applying practice to principle, they agree entirely with Pascal,
who says that "God is a circle, the centre of which is everywhere and
the circumference nowhere," whereas the Kabalists say the reverse, and
maintain it solely out of their desire to veil their doctrine. By the
way, the definition of Deity by the Circle is not Pascal's at all, as E.
Levi thought. It was *borrowed* by the French philosopher from either
Mercury Trismegistus or Cardinal Cusa's Latin work, *De Docta*
*Ignorantia,* in which he makes use of it. It is, moreover, disfigured
by Pascal, who replaces the words "Cosmic Circle," which stand
symbolically in the original inscription, by the word *Theos.* With the
ancients both words were synonymous.

###### **C**ROSS AND **C**IRCLE.

Something of the divine and the mysterious has ever been ascribed, in
the minds of the ancient philosophers, to the shape of the circle. The
old world, consistent in its symbolism with its pantheistic intuitions,
uniting the visible and the invisible Infinitudes into one, represented
Deity and its outward VEIL alike -- by a circle. This merging of the two
into a unity, and the name *theos* given indifferently to both, is
explained, and becomes thereby still more *scientific* and
philosophical. Plato's etymological definition of the word *theos* has
been shown elsewhere. He derives it from the verb \[\[*theein*\]\] (see
*Cratylus*)*,* "to move," as suggested by the motion of the heavenly
bodies which he connects with deity. According to the Esoteric
philosophy, this Deity is during its "nights" and its "days" (*i.e.*,
cycles of rest or activity) "the *eternal* *perpetual motion,"* "the
EVER-BECOMING, as well as the ever universally present, and the ever
Existing." The latter is the root-abstraction, the former -- the only
possible conception in human mind, if it disconnects this deity from any
shape or form. It is a perpetual, never-ceasing evolution, circling back
in its incessant progress through aeons of duration into its original

(*See "Book of the Dead," Ritual* **XVII**, 45-47), was often
represented in the Egyptian monuments seated, and holding a cross,
symbol of the four quarters, or the Elements, attached to a Circle.

In that very learned work, "The Natural Genesis," by Mr. Gerald Massey,
on pp. 408-455 (Vol. I.), under the heading, "Typology of the Cross,"
there is more information to be had on the cross and circle than in any
other work we know of. He who would fain have proofs of the antiquity of
the Cross is referred to these two volumes. The author shows that "the
circle and the cross are inseparable. . . . The crux ansata unites the
circle and cross of the four corners. From this origin they came to be
interchangeable at times. For example, the Chakra, or Disk of Vishnu, is
a circle. The names denote the circling, wheeling round, periodicity,
the wheel of time. This the god uses as a weapon to hurl at the enemy.
In like manner, Thor throws his weapon, the Fylfot, a form of the
four-footed cross (Swastica) and a type of the four quarters. Thus the
cross is equivalent to the circle of the year. . . . The wheel emblem
unites the cross and circle in one, as does the hieroglyphic cake and
the Ankh-te ![](sd2-547b.gif)."

Nor was the double glyph sacred with the profane, but only with the
Initiates. For Raoul-Rochette shows (*ibid*) "the sign ![](sd2-29b.gif),
occurring as the *reverse* of a Phoenician coin, with a Ram as the
obverse. . . . .The same sign, sometimes called Venus' Looking-Glass,
because it typified reproduction, was employed to mark the hind-quarters
of valuable brood mares of Corinthian and other beautiful breeds of
horses" (Raoul-Rochette, loc. cit. *De La Croix Ansee, Mem. de
l'Academie des* *Sciences,* pl. 2, Nos. 8, 9, also 16, 2, p. 320, quoted
in *"Nat. Gen."*)*,* which proves that so far back as those early days
the cross had already become the symbol of human procreation, and that
oblivion of the *divine* origin of Cross and Circle had been forgotten.

Another form of the cross is given from the *Journal of the Royal*
*Asiatic Society* (vol. xviii., p. 393, pl. 4): --

This is the astronomical aspect of the double glyph. There are six more
aspects, however, and an attempt may be made to interpret a few of
these. The subject is so vast that it would require in itself alone many
volumes.

But the most curious of these Egyptian symbols of Cross and Circle,
spoken of in the above cited work, is one which receives its full
explanation and final colour from Aryan symbols of the same nature. Says
the author: --

Now this, again, is entirely astronomical and phallic. The Puranic
version in India gives the whole another colour; and without, however,

destroying the above interpretation it is made to reveal a portion of
its mysteries with the help of the astronomical key, and thus offers a
more metaphysical rendering. The "Ankh-tie" ![](sd2-547b.gif) does not
belong to Egypt alone. It exists under the name of pasa, a cord which
Siva holds in the hand of his right back arm\* (Siva having four arms).
The Mahadeva is represented in the posture of an ascetic, as Maha-Yogi,
with his third eye ![](sd2-548a.gif), which is "the Ru,
![](sd2-548c.gif),set upright on the Tau-Cross" in another form. The
pasa is held in the hand in such a way that it is the first finger and
hand near the thumb which make the cross, or loop and crossing.
![](sd2-548b.gif) Our Orientalists would have it to represent a cord to
bind refractory offenders with, because, forsooth, Kali, Siva's consort,
has the same as an attribute!

The *pasa* has here a double significance, as also has Siva's *trisula*
and every other divine attribute. This significance lies in Siva, as
Rudra has certainly the same meaning as the Egyptian ansated cross in
its cosmic and mystic meaning. In the hand of Siva it becomes *linga*
and *yonic.* That which is meant is this: Siva, as said before, is
unknown by that name in the Vedas; and it is in the white *Yajur* Veda
that he appears for the first time as the great god -- **M**AHADEVA --
whose symbol is the lingham. In Rig Veda he is called Rudra, the
"howler," the beneficent and the maleficent Deity at the same time, the
Healer and the Destroyer. In the Vishnu Purana, he is the god who
springs from the forehead of Brahma, who separates into male and female,
and he is the parent of the Rudras or Maruts, half of whom are brilliant
and gentle, others, black and ferocious. In the Vedas, he is the divine
Ego aspiring to return to its pure, deific state, and at the same time
that divine ego imprisoned in earthly form, whose fierce passions make
of him the "roarer," the "terrible." This is well shown in the
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, wherein the Rudras, the progeny of Rudra, god
of fire, are called the "ten vital breaths" (*prana,* life) with
*manas,* as eleventh, whereas as Siva, he is the *Destroyer* of that
life. Brahma calls him Rudra, and gives him, besides, seven other names,
which names are his seven forms of manifestation, also the seven powers
of nature which destroy but to recreate or regenerate.

Hence the cruciform noose (*pasa*) in his hand, when he is represented
as an ascetic, the *Mahayogin,* has no phallic signification, and it,
indeed, requires a strong imagination bent in this direction to find
such even in

an astronomical symbol. As an emblem of "door, gate, mouth, the place of
outlet" it signifies the "strait gate" that leads to the kingdom of
heaven, far more than the "birth-place" in a physiological sense.

It is a *Cross in a Circle* and *Crux Ansata,* truly; but it is a Cross
on which all the human passions have to be crucified before the Yogi
passes through the "strait gate," the narrow circle that widens into an
infinite one, as soon as the *inner* man has passed the threshold.

As to the mysterious constellation of the Seven Rishis in the great
Bear, if Egypt made them sacred to "the oldest genitrix, Typhon" --
India has connected all these symbols ages ago with time or *Yuga*
revolutions, and the Saptarishis are intimately connected with our
present age -- the Dark *Kali Yug.\** The great Circle of Time, on the
face of which fancy in India has represented the Tortoise (Kurma, or
Sisumara, one of the Avatars of Vishnu), has the Cross placed on it by
nature in its division and localisation of stars, planets and
constellations. Thus in *Bhagavata Purana V., xxx.,* it is said that "at
the *extremity of the tail of that animal, whose head is directed toward
the* *South* and whose body is *in the shape of a ring* (Circle), Dhruva
(the ex-pole star) is placed; and *along that tail* are the Prajapati,
Agni, Indra, Dharma, etc.; and *across its loins* the Seven Rishis."
This is then the first and earliest Cross and Circle, into the formation
of which enters the Deity (symbolized by Vishnu), the Eternal Circle of
Boundless Time, *Kala,* on whose plane lie crossways all the gods,
creatures, and creations born in Space and Time; -- who, as the
philosophy has it, all die at the Mahapralaya.

Meanwhile it is they, the Seven Rishis, who mark the time and the
duration of events in our septenary life cycle. They are as mysterious
as their supposed wives, the Pleiades, of whom only one -- she who hides
-- has proven virtuous. The Pleiades (Krittika) are the nurses of
Karttikeya, the God of War (Mars of the Western Pagans), who is called
the Commander of the celestial armies -- or rather of the Siddhas
(translated Yogis in heaven, and holy sages on the earth) --
"Siddha-sena," which would make Karttikeya identical with Michael, the
"leader of the celestial hosts" and, like himself, a virgin
*Kumara.\*\** Verily he is the "Guha," the *mysterious one,* as much so
as are the Saptarshis and the Krittika (seven Rishis and the Pleiades),
for the interpretation of all these combined, reveal to the adept the
greatest mysteries of occult nature. One point is worth mention in this
question of cross and

circle, as it bears strongly upon the elements of fire and water, which
play such an important part in the circle and cross Symbolics. Like
Mars, who is alleged by Ovid to have been born of a mother alone (Juno),
without the participation of a father, or like the Avatars (Krishna, for
instance), in the West as in the East -- Karttikeya is born, but in a
still more miraculous manner -- begotten by neither father nor mother,
but out of a seed of Rudra Siva, *via* *Agni,* who dropped it into the
Ganges. Thus he is born from *fire and water* -- a "boy bright as the
Sun and beautiful as the moon." Hence he is called *Agnibhuva* (Agni's
son) and *Ganga-putra* (Son of Ganges). Add to this the fact that the
Krittika, his nurses, as Matsya Purana shows, are presided over by Agni,
or, in the authentic words -- "The seven Rishis are on a line with the
brilliant Agni," and hence are called Agneya -- and the connection is
easy to follow.

It is, then, the Rishis who mark the time and the periods of Kali-yuga,
the age of sin and sorrow. See in the Bhagavata Purana **XII**., II,
*2,* 6, 32, and Vishnu Purana. Says the latter: "When the splendour of
Vishnu (Krishna) departed for heaven, then did the Kali Yug, during
which men delight in sin, invade the world. . . . . When the Seven
Rishis were in Magha, the Kali Yug, comprising 1,200 (divine) years
(432,000 years of mortals), began; and when from Magha, they shall reach
Purvashadha, then will this Kali age attain its growth, under Nanda and
his successors."\* This is the revolution of the Rishis "when the two
first stars of the Seven Rishis (of the Great Bear) rise in the heavens,
and some lunar asterism is seen at night, at an equal distance between
them, then the Seven Rishis continue stationary in that conjunction for
a hundred years," a hater of Nanda makes Parasara say. According to
Bentley, it is in order to show the quantity of the precession of the
equinoxes that this notion originated among the astronomers. It was done
"by assuming an imaginary line, or great circle, passing through the
poles of the ecliptic and the beginning of the fixed Magha, which circle
was supposed to cut some of the stars in the Great Bear. . . . The seven
stars being called the Rishis, the Circle so assumed was called the line
of the Rishis . . . . and being invariably fixed to the beginning of the
lunar asterism Magha, the precession would be noted by stating the
degree . . . of any moveable lunar mansion cut by that line or circle as
an index" ("Historical View of the Hindu Astronomy," p. 65).

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Nanda is the first Buddhist Sovereign, Chandragupta, against whom all
the Brahmins were so arrayed; he of the Morya Dynasty, and the
grandfather of Asoka. This is one of those passages that do not exist in
the earlier Puranic **MSS**. They were added by the Vaishnavas, who
interpolated almost as much, out of Sectarian spite, as the Christian
Fathers did.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 551 THE RISHIS AND THE PLEIADES.

There was, and still exists, a seemingly endless controversy about the
chronology of the Hindus. Here is a point that could help to determine
-- approximately at least -- the age when the symbolism of the Seven
Rishis and their connection with the Pleiades began. When Karttikeya was
delivered to them by the gods to be nursed, the Krittika were only six
-- whence Karttikeya is represented with *six heads;* but when the
poetical fancy of the early Aryan symbologists made of them the consorts
of the Seven Rishis, they *were seven.* Their names are given, and these
are Amba, Dula, Nitatui, Abrayanti, Maghayanti, Varshayanti, and
Chupunika. There are other sets of names which differ, however. Anyhow,
the Seven Rishis were made to marry the Seven Krittika before the
disappearance of the seventh Pleiad. Otherwise, how could the Hindu
astronomers speak of that which, without the help of the strongest
telescopes, no one can see? This is why, perhaps, in every such case the
majority of the events described in the Hindu allegories is fixed upon
as "a very recent invention, certainly *within* the Christian era"?

The oldest **MSS**. in Sanskrit on astronomy, begin their series of
*Nakshatras* (the 27 lunar asterisms) with the sign of *Krittika,* and
this can hardly make them earlier than 2780 **B.C**., (see the "Vedic
Calendar," accepted even by the Orientalists); though they get out of
the difficulty by saying that the said Calendar does not *prove* that
the Hindus knew anything of astronomy at that date, and assure their
readers that, Calendars notwithstanding, the Indian *pundits* may have
acquired their knowledge of the lunar mansions headed by Krittika from
the Phoenicians, etc. However that may be, the Pleiades are the central
group of the system of sidereal symbology. They are situated in the neck
of the constellation of *Taurus,* regarded by Madler and others, in
astronomy, *as* *the central group* of the system of The Milky Way, and
in the Kabala and Eastern Esotericism, as the *sidereal septenate* born
from the first manifested side of the upper triangle, the concealed
![](sd1-113.jpg). This manifested side is *Taurus,* the Symbol of
**O**NE (the figure 1), or of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet,
*Aleph* ![](sd1-78b.gif) (bull or ox) whose synthesis is ten (10), or
![](sd1-78c.gif) *Yodh,* the perfect letter and number. The Pleiades
(Alcyone, especially), are thus considered, even in astronomy, as the
central point around which *our Universe of fixed stars revolves,* the
focus from which, and into which the *divine breath,* **M**OTION, works
incessantly during the Manvantara. Hence -- in the Occult philosophy and
its sidereal symbols -- it is this Circle and the starry cross on its
face, which play the most prominent part.

The Secret Doctrine teaches us that everything in the universe, as well
as the universe itself, is formed (created) during its periodical
manifestations -- by accelerated **M**OTION set into activity by the
**B**REATH of

the ever-to-be-unknown power (unknown to present mankind, at any rate)
within the phenomenal world. The Spirit of Life and Immortality was
everywhere symbolized by a circle: hence the serpent biting his tail,
represents the circle of Wisdom in infinity; as does the astronomical
cross -- the cross within a circle, and the globe, with two wings added
to it, which then became the sacred *Scarabaeus* of the Egyptians, its
very name being suggestive of the secret idea attached to it. For the
Scarabaeus is called in Egypt (in the *papyri*) *Khopirron* and *Khopri*
from the verb *Khopron* "to become," and has thus been made a symbol and
an emblem of human life and of the successive *becomings* of man,
through the various peregrinations and metempsychoses (reincarnations)
of the liberated Soul. This mystical symbol shows plainly that the
Egyptians believed in reincarnation and the successive lives and
existences of the Immortal entity. Being, however, an esoteric doctrine,
revealed only during the mysteries by the priest-hierophants and the
Kings-Initiates to the candidates, it was kept secret. The incorporeal
intelligences (the Planetary Spirits, or Creative Powers) were always
represented under the form of circles. In the primitive philosophy of
the Hierophants these *invisible* circles were the prototypic causes and
builders of all the heavenly orbs, which were their *visible* bodies or
coverings, and of which they were the souls. It was certainly a
universal teaching in antiquity. (See *Ezekiel,* ch. 1.)

"Before the mathematical numbers," says Proclus (*in Quinto Libro,*
**E**UCLID), "there are the *Self-moving* numbers; before the figures
apparent -- the vital figures, and before producing the material worlds
*which move* *in a Circle,* the Creative Power produced the *invisible*
Circles."

*Deus enim et circulus est,* says Pherecydes, in his hymn to Jupiter. It
was a Hermetic axiom, and Pythagoras prescribed such a circular
prostration and posture during the hours of contemplation. "The devotee
must approach as much as possible the form of a perfect circle,"
prescribes the Secret Book. Numa tried to spread among the people the
same custom, Pierius\* tells his readers; and Pliny says: "During our
worship, we roll up, so to say, our body in a ring, *totum* *corpus
circumagimur."\*\** The vision of the prophet Ezekiel reminds one

cat. This animal was sacred in Egypt for several reasons: as a symbol of
the Moon "the eye of Osiris" or the "Sun," during night. The cat was
also sacred to Sokhit. One of the mystic reasons was because of its body
being rolled up in a *circle* when asleep. The posture is prescribed for
occult and magnetic purposes, in order to regulate in a certain way the
circulation of the vital fluid, with which the cat is pre-eminently
endowed. "The nine lives of a cat" is a popular saying based on good
physiological and occult reasons. Mr. G. Massey gives also an
astronomical reason for it which may be found in ยง I. "**S**YMBOLISM."

from which came out "one *wheel* upon the earth" whose work *"was* as it
were a wheel in the middle of a wheel*"* (ch. i. vv. 4-16). . . . "for
the Spirit of the living creature *was* in the wheels" (v. 20).

*"Spirit* whirleth about continually and returneth again according to
his circuits" -- says Solomon (*Eccles.* i. 6), who is made in the
English *translation* to speak of the "Wind," and in the *original text*
to refer both to the *Spirit* and the *Sun.* But the *Zohar,* the only
true glossary of the Kabalistic *Preacher,* in explanation of this
verse, which is, perhaps, rather hazy and difficult to comprehend, says
that "it seems to say that the sun moves in circuits, whereas it refers
to the Spirit *under the* *Sun,* called the holy Spirit, that moves
circularly, toward both sides, that they (It and the Sun) *should be
united in the same Essence."* . . . (*Zohar,* fol. 87, col. 346.)

The Brahmanical "Golden Egg," from within which emerges Brahma, the
creative deity, is the "circle with the Central Point" of Pythagoras,
and its fitting symbol. In the Secret Doctrine the concealed **U**NITY
-- whether representing **P**ARABRAHMAM, or the "**G**REAT **E**XTREME"
of Confucius, or the Deity concealed by **P**HTA, the Eternal Light, or
again the Jewish **E**N-**S**OPH, is always found to be symbolized by a
circle or the "nought" (absolute *No-Thing* and Nothing, because it is
*infinite* and the **A**LL); while the god-manifested (by its works) is
referred to as the *diameter of that circle.* The symbolism of the
underlying idea is thus made evident: the right line passing through the
centre of a circle has, in the geometrical sense, length, but neither
breadth or thickness: it is an imaginary and feminine symbol, crossing
eternity and made to rest on the plane of existence *of the phenomenal*
*world.* It is *dimensional,* whereas its circle is dimensionless, or,
to use an algebraical term, it is the dimension of an equation. Another
way of symbolizing the idea is found in the Pythagorean sacred *Decade*
which synthesizes, in the dual numeral Ten (the 1 and a circle or
cipher), the absolute **A**LL manifesting itself in the **W**ORD or
generative Power of Creation.

Plato and his school never understood the Deity otherwise, many epithets
of his applied to the "God over all" (\[\[*ho epi pasi theos*\]\])
notwithstanding. Plato having been initiated, could not believe in a
personal God -- a gigantic Shadow of Man. His epithets of "monarch" and
"Law-giver of the Universe" bear an abstract meaning well understood by
every Occultist, who, no less than any Christian, believes in the One
Law that governs the Universe, recognizing it at the same time as
immutable. "Beyond all *finite* existences," he says, "and *secondary*
causes, all laws, ideas and principles, there is an **I**NTELLIGENCE or
**M**IND (\[\[*nous*\]\]), the first principle of all principles, the
Supreme Idea on which all other ideas are grounded . . . *the ultimate*
substance *from which all things derive their being and essence,* the
first and efficient cause of all the order, and harmony, and beauty and
excellency, and goodness, which pervades the Universe" -- who is called,
by way of preeminence and excellence, the Supreme\*\* good "the god"
(\[\[*Theos*\]\]), and "the god over all." These words apply, as Plato
himself shows, neither to the "Creator" nor to the "Father" of our
modern Monotheist, but to the *ideal* and abstract cause. For, as he
says, "this \[gk char\], the god over all, *is not the truth or the
intelligence,* but the **F**ATHER of it," and its Primal cause. Is it
Plato, the greatest pupil of the archaic Sages, a sage himself, for whom

psychological, and even physiological mysteries; and this symbol is
precisely one of this kind, and is based upon the oldest esoteric
cosmogony.

It is no explanation to say, as Eliphas Levi does, that God, the
universal Love, having caused the male *unit* to dig an abyss in the
female *Binary,* or chaos, produced thereby the world. Besides being as
gross a conception as any, it does not remove the difficulty of
conceiving it without losing one's veneration for the rather too
human-like ways of the Deity. It is to avoid such anthropomorphic
conceptions that the Initiates never use the epithet "God" to designate
the One and Secondless Principle in the Universe; and that -- faithful
in this to the oldest traditions of the Secret Doctrine the world over
-- they deny that such imperfect and often not very clean work could
ever be produced by Absolute Perfection. There is no need to mention
here other still greater metaphysical difficulties. Between speculative
Atheism and idiotic anthropomorphism there must be a philosophical mean,
and a reconciliation. The Presence of the Unseen Principle throughout
all nature, and the highest manifestation of it on Earth -- MAN, can
alone help to solve the Problem, which is that of the mathematician
whose *x* must ever elude the grasp of our terrestrial algebra. The
Hindus have tried to solve it by their *avatars,* the Christians *think*

they did it -- by their one divine Incarnation. Exoterically -- both are
wrong*; esoterically* both of them are very near the truth. Alone, among
the Apostles of the Western religion, Paul seems to have fathomed -- if
not actually revealed -- the archaic mystery of the Cross. As for the
rest of those who, by unifying and individualizing the Universal
Presence, have thus synthesized it into one symbol -- the central Point
in the Crucifix -- they have shown thereby that they have never seized
the true Spirit of the teaching of Christ, and by their interpretations
they have degraded it in more than one way. They have forgotten the
Spirit of that universal symbol and have selfishly monopolized it -- as
though the Boundless and the Infinite can ever be limited and
conditioned to one manifestation individualized in one man, or even in a
nation!

The four arms of the "![](sd2-556.gif)," the decussated cross, and of
the "Hermetic," pointing to the four cardinal points -- were well
understood by the mystical minds of the Hindus, Brahmins and Buddhists,
thousands of years before it was heard of in Europe; and that symbol was
and is found all over the world. They bent the ends of that cross and
made of it their *Swastica* ![](sd2-101a.gif) now the *Wan* of the
Buddhist Mongolian.\* It implies that the "Central point" is not limited
to one individual, however perfect. That *the* Principle (God) is in
Humanity, and Humanity, as all the rest, is in it, like drops of water
are in the Ocean, the four ends being toward the four cardinal points,
hence losing themselves in infinity.

Isarim, an Initiate, is said to have found at Hebron, *on the dead*

contained the essence of Hermetic wisdom . . . . "Separate the earth
from the fire, the subtile from the gross . . . . Ascend from the earth

*riddle* of the cross is contained in these words, and its double
mystery is solved -- to the Occultist.

Again: -- The ![](sd1-5e.jpg) (Tau), and the astronomical cross of Egypt
![](sd2-557a.jpg) are conspicuous in several apertures of the remains of
Palenque. In one of the *basso-relievos* of the Palace of Palenque, on
the west side, sculptured as a hieroglyphic right under the seated
figure, is a *Tau.* The standing figure, which leans over the first one,
is in the act of covering its head with the left hand with the veil of
initiation; while it extends its right with the index and middle finger
pointing to heaven. The position is precisely that of a Christian bishop
giving his blessing, or the one in which Jesus is often represented
while at the Last Supper. . . . The Egyptian Hierophant had a square
head-dress which he had to wear always during his functions. . . . The
perfect *Tau*, formed of the perpendicular (descending male ray), and a
horizontal line (matter, female principle), and the mundane circle was
an attribute of Isis, and it is but at death that the Egyptian cross was
laid on the breast of the mummy." These square hats are worn unto this
day by the Armenian priests. The claim that the cross is purely a
Christian symbol introduced after our era, is strange indeed, when we
find Ezekiel stamping the foreheads of the men of Judah, who feared the
Lord (*Ezekiel* ix. 4), with the *signum* *Thau,* as it is translated in
the Vulgate. In the ancient Hebrew this sign was formed thus
![](sd2-557b.gif), but in the original Egyptian hieroglyphics as a
perfect Christian cross ![](sd2-557c.gif) (*Tat,* the emblem of
stability). In the *Revelation,* also, the "Alpha and Omega" (spirit and
matter), the first and the last, stamps the name of his Father in the
foreheads of the *elect,* (p*.* 323, Vol. **II.**) Moses, in *Exodus*
xii*.* 22, orders his people to mark their *door-posts and lintels* with
blood, lest the "Lord God" should make a mistake and smite some of his
chosen people, instead of the doomed Egyptians. And this mark is a tau!
The identical Egyptian handled *cross,* with the half of which talisman
Horus raised the dead, as is shown on a sculptured ruin at Philoe.

Enough was said in the text about the *Swastica* and the *Tau.* Verily
may the Cross be traced back into the very depths of the unfathomable
Archaic Ages! Its Mystery deepens rather than clears, as we find it on
the statues of Easter Island -- in old Egypt, in Central Asia, engraved
on rocks as Tau and Swastica, in pre-Christian Scandinavia,

everywhere! The author of the "Hebrew Egyptian Mystery" stands perplexed
before the endless shadow it throws back into antiquity, and is unable
to trace it to any particular nation or man. He shows the *Targums*
handed down by the Hebrews, obscured by translation. In Joshua (viii.
29) read in *Arabic,* and in the *Targum* of *Jonathan,* it is said:
*"The king of Ai he crucified upon a tree."* The *Septuagint* rendering
is of suspension from a *double word* (Wordsworth on Joshua.) . . . The
strangest expression of this kind is in Numbers xxv. 4, where, by
Onkalos (?) it is read: "Crucify them before the Lord (Jehovah) *against
the Sun."* "The word here ![](sd2-558.gif), *to nail to,* is rendered
properly (Fuerst) by the Vulgate *to crucify.* The very construction of
this sentence is mystic."

So it is, but the spirit of it has been ever misunderstood. "To crucify
before (not against) the sun" is a phrase used of initiation. It comes
from Egypt, and primarily from India. The enigma can be unriddled only
by searching for its key in the Mysteries of Initiation. The initiated
adept, who had successfully passed through all the trials, *was
attached,* not *nailed,* but simply tied on a couch in the form of a
*tau* ![](sd1-5e.jpg) (in Egypt) of a *Svastika* without the four
additional prolongations (thus: ![](sd1-5b.jpg), not ![](sd2-29a.gif))
plunged in a deep sleep (the "Sleep of Siloam" it is called to this day
among the Initiates in Asia Minor, in Syria, and even higher Egypt). He
was allowed to remain in this state for three days and three nights,
during which time his Spiritual Ego was said to confabulate with the
"gods," descend into Hades, Amenti, or Patala, (according to the
country), and do works of charity to the invisible beings, whether souls
of men or Elemental Spirits; his body remaining all the time in a temple
crypt or subterranean cave. In Egypt it was placed in the Sarcophagus in
the King's Chamber of the Pyramid of Cheops, and carried during the
night of the approaching third day to the entrance of a gallery, where
at a certain hour the beams of the rising Sun struck full on the face of
the entranced candidate, who awoke to be initiated by Osiris, and Thoth
the God of Wisdom.

Let the reader who doubts the statement consult the Hebrew originals
before he denies. Let him turn to some most suggestive Egyptian *bas*
*reliefs.* One especially from the temple of Philoe, represents a *scene
of* *initiation.* Two Gods-Hierophants, one with the head of a hawk (the
Sun), the other *ibis*-headed (Mercury, Thoth, the god of Wisdom and
secret learning, the assessor of Osiris-Sun), are standing over the body
of a candidate just initiated. They are in the act of pouring on his
head a double stream of water (the water of life and new *birth*)*,*
which stream is interlaced in the shape of a cross and full of small
ansated crosses. This is allegorical of the awakening of the candidate

(now an Initiate), when the beams of the morning sun (Osiris) strike the
crown of his head (*his entranced body being placed* on its wooden *tau
so as to receive the rays*)*.* Then appeared the Hierophants-Initiators,
and the sacramental words were pronounced, ostensibly, to the
Sun-Osiris, addressed in reality to the Spirit Sun within, enlightening
the newly-born man. Let the reader meditate on the connection of the Sun
with the Cross in both its generative and spiritually regenerative
capacities -- from the highest antiquity. Let him examine the tomb of
Bait-Oxly, in the reign of Ramses **II**., where he will find the
crosses in every shape and position. So again, on the throne of that
sovereign, and finally on a fragment from the Hall of the ancestors of
Totmes **III**., preserved in the National Library of Paris, which
represents the adoration of Bakhan-Aleare.

In this extraordinary sculpture and painting one sees the disc of the
Sun beaming upon an ansated cross placed upon a cross of which those of
the Calvary were perfect copies. The ancient **MSS**. mention these as
the "hard couches of those who were in (spiritual) travail, the *act*
*of giving birth to themselves.*" A quantity of such cruciform
"couches," on which the candidate, thrown into a dead trance at the end
of his supreme initiation, was placed and secured, were found in the
underground halls of the Egyptian temples after their destruction. The
worthy and holy Fathers of the Cyril and Theophilus types used them
freely, believing they had been brought and concealed there by some new
converts. Alone Origen, and after him Clemens Alexandrinus and other
ex-initiates, knew better. But they preferred to keep silent.

Again, let the reader read the Hindu "fables," as the Orientalists call
them, and remember the allegory of Visvakarma, the creative power, the
great architect of the world, called in the Veda "the all-seeing god,"
who "sacrifices himself to himself" (the Spiritual Egos of mortals are
his own essence, *one with him,* therefore). Remember that he is called
*Deva Vardhika* "the builder of the gods" and that it is he who ties
(the Sun) Surya, his son-in-law, on his lathe, in the exoteric allegory;
on the Swastika, in esoteric tradition, as on earth he is the Hierophant
Initiator, and cuts away a portion of his brightness. Visvakarma,
remember again, is the Son of Yoga-Siddha, *i.e*., the holy power of
Yoga, and the fabricator of the "fiery weapon," the magic Agneyastra.
The narrative is given more fully elsewhere. The author of the
Kabalistic work so often quoted from, asks: --

"The theoretical use of crucifixion must have been somehow connected
with the personification of this symbol (the structure of the garden of
Paradise symbolized by a crucified man). But how? And as showing what?
The symbol was of the origin of measures, shadowing forth *creative law*
or *design.* What practically, as regards humanity,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 560 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

could actual crucifixion betoken? Yet, that it was held as the effigy of
some mysterious working of the same system, is shown from the very fact
of the use. There seems to be deep below deep as to the mysterious
workings of these number values -- (the symbolization of the connection
of 113 : 355, with 20612 : 6561, *by a crucified man*)*.* Not only are
they shown to work in the Kosmos . . . . but by sympathy, they seem to
work out conditions relating to an unseen and spiritual world, and the
prophets seem to have held knowledge of the connecting link. . . .
Reflection becomes more involved when it is considered that the power of
expression of the law, *exactly,* by *numbers,* clearly defining a
system, was not the *accident* of the language, but was its very
*essence,* and of its *primary organic construction;* therefore, neither
the language, nor the mathematical system attaching to it, *could be of
man's invention,* unless both were *founded upon a prior language, which
afterwards became* *obsolete .* . . " (p. 205).

The author proves these points by further elucidation, and reveals the
secret meaning of more than one *dead-letter* narrative, by showing that
probably ![](sd2-560.gif) *man* was the *primordial* word -- "the very
first word possessed by the Hebrews, whoever they were, to carry the
idea by sound of a *man.* The essential of this word was 113 (the
numerical value of that word) from the beginning, and carried with it
the elements of the cosmical system displayed."

This is demonstrated by the Hindu Wittoba -- a form of Vishnu -- as said
already. The figure of Wittoba, even to the nail-marks on the feet,\*
*is that of Jesus crucified, in all its details* save the Cross; and
that MAN was meant is proved to us further by the fact of the *Initiate
being* *reborn after his crucifixion on the* TREE OF LIFE. This "tree"
has now become exoterically, through its use by the Romans as an
instrument of torture, and the ignorance of the early Christian
schemers, the *tree of* *death!*

Thus, one of the *seven esoteric meanings* implied in this mystery of
Crucifixion by the mystic inventors of the system -- the original
elaboration and adoption of which dates back to the very establishment
of the MYSTERIES -- is discovered in the geometrical symbols containing
the history of the evolution of man. The Hebrews, whose prophet Moses
was so learned in the esoteric Wisdom of Egypt, and who adopted their
numerical system from the Phoenicians, and later from the Gentiles, from
whom they borrowed most of their Kabalistic Mysticism, adapted, most
ingeniously, the Cosmic and anthropological symbols of the "heathen"
nations to their peculiar *secret* records. If Christian

sacerdotalism has lost the key of it to-day, the early compilers of the
Christian Mysteries were well versed in Esoteric philosophy and the
Hebrew occult metrology, and used it dexterously. Thus they took the
word *aish* (one of the Hebrew word forms for MAN) and used it in
conjunction with that of *Shanah* "lunar year," so mystically connected
with the name of Jehovah, the supposed "father" of Jesus, and embosomed
the mystic idea in an astronomical value and formula.

The original idea of "Man Crucified" in Space belongs certainly to the
ancient Hindus, and Muir shows it in his "Hindu Pantheon" in the
engraving that represents Wittoba. Plato adopted it in his decussated
Cross in Space, the ![](sd2-556.gif) , "the Second God who impressed
himself on the Universe in the form of the Cross"; Krishna is likewise
shown "crucified." (See Dr. Lundy's *Monumental Christianity,* fig. 72.)
Again it is repeated in the Old Testament in the queer injunction *to
crucify men* before the Lord, *the Sun --* which is no prophecy at all,
but has a direct phallic significance. In ยง **II**. of that same most
suggestive work on the Kabalistic meanings -- "The Hebrew-Egyptian
Mystery," we read again: --

> "In symbol, the nails of the cross have for the shape of the heads
> thereof a solid pyramid, and a tapering square obeliscal shaft, or
> phallic emblem, for the nail. Taking the position of the *three* nails
> in the Man's extremities and on the cross, they form or mark a
> *triangle* in shape, one nail being at each corner of the triangle.
> The wounds or *stigmata* in the extremities are necessarily *four*
> designative of the *square*. . . . The *three* nails with the *three*
> wounds are in number 6, which denotes the 6 faces of the cube
> *unfolded* (which make the cross or man-form, or 7, counting three
> horizontal and four vertical bars) on which the man is placed; and
> this in turn points to the circular measure transferred on to the
> edges of the cube. The *one* wound of the feet separates into *two*
> when the feet are separated, making *three* together *for all,* and
> *four when* *separated,* or 7 in all -- another *most holy* (and *with
> the Jews*) feminine base number."

Thus, while the phallic or sexual meaning of the "Crucifixion Nails" is
proven by the geometrical and numerical reading, its mystical meaning is
indicated by the short remarks upon it, as given above, in its
connection with, and bearing upon, Prometheus. He is another victim, for
he is crucified on the Cross of Love, on the rock of human passions, a
sacrifice to his devotion to the cause of the spiritual element in
Humanity.

Now, the primordial system, the double glyph that underlies the idea of
the Cross, is not "of human invention," for Cosmic ideation and the
Spiritual representation of the divine Ego-man are at its basis. Later,
it expanded in the beautiful idea adopted by and represented in the
Mysteries, that of regenerated man, the mortal, who, by crucifying the
man of flesh and his passions on the

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 562 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

Procrustean bed of torture, became reborn as an Immortal. Leaving the
body, the animal-man, behind him, tied on the Cross of Initiation like
an empty chrysalis, the Ego Soul became as free as a butterfly. Still
later, owing to the gradual loss of spirituality, the cross became in
Cosmogony and Anthropology no *higher than a phallic symbol.*

With the Esotericists, from the remotest times the Universal Soul or
*anima mundi,* the material reflection of the Immaterial Ideal, was the
Source of Life of all beings and of the life principle of the three
kingdoms; and it was *Septenary* with the Hermetic philosophers, as with
all ancients. For it is represented as a Sevenfold cross, whose branches
are respectively, *light, heat, electricity, terrestrial magnetism,
astral* *radiation, motion,* and *Intelligence,* or what some call
self-consciousness.

We have said it elsewhere. Long before the cross or its sign were
adopted as symbols of Christianity, the sign of the cross was used as a
sign of recognition among adepts and neophytes, the latter being called
*Chrests* (from Chrestos, man of tribulation and sorrow). Says E. Levi:
"The sign of the cross adopted by the Christians does not belong
exclusively to them. It is Kabalistic, and represents the opposition and
quaternary equilibrium of the elements. We see by the Occult verse of
the *Paternoster* that there were originally two ways of making it, or,
at least *two* very different formulas to express its meaning -- one
reserved for *priests-initiates,* the other given to neophites and the
profane. Thus, for example, the *initiate,* carrying his hand to his
forehead, said: *To thee;* then he added, *belong:* and continued, while
carrying his hand to the breast -- *the kingdom;* then, to the left
shoulder -- *justice:* to the right shoulder -- *and mercy.* Then he
joined the two hands, adding: *throughout the generating cycles: 'Tibi
sunt Malchut et* *Geburah et Chassed per Aeonas' --* a sign of the
Cross, *absolutely* and magnificently kabalistic, which the profanations
of Gnosticism made the militant and official Church completely *lose."*
(*Dogma et Ritual,* etc., Vol. II., p. 88.)

The "militant and official Church" did more: having helped herself to
what had never belonged to her, she took only that which the "profane"
had, the Kabalistic meaning of the *male* and *female* Sephiroth. She
never lost the *inner* and higher meaning since she never had it -- E.
Levi's pandering to Rome, notwithstanding. The sign of the cross adopted
by the Latin Church was *phallic* from the beginning, while that of the
Greeks was the cross of the *neophytes,* the **C**HREST.
