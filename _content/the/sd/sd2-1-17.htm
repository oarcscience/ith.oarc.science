<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>R</STRONG>ACES WITH THE &quot;<STRONG>T</STRONG>HIRD
<STRONG>E</STRONG>YE.&quot;
<P>
The subject is so unusual, the paths pursued so intricate, so
full of dangerous pitfalls prepared by adverse theories and criticism,
that good reasons have to be given for every step taken. While
turning the light of the bull's eye called esotericism on almost
every inch of the occult grounds travelled over, we have also
to use its lens to throw into stronger objectivity the regions
explored by exact science; this, not only in order to contrast
the two, but to defend our position.*
<P>
It may be complained by some that too little is said of the physical,
<EM>human </EM>side of the extinct races, in this history of their
growth and evolution. Much more might be said assuredly, if simple
prudence did not make us hesitate at the threshold of every new
revelation. That, which finds its possibility and landmarks in
the discoveries of modern science, is given; all that of which
exact knowledge knows nothing and upon which it is unable to speculate
-- and therefore denies as facts in nature -- is withheld.
<P>
But even such statements as these -- <EM>e.g</EM>., that of all
the mammalians, man was the earliest; that it is man who is the
indirect ancestor of the Ape; and that he was a kind of a Cyclops
in days of old -- will all be contested, yet, scientists will
never be able to prove -- except to their own satisfaction --
that <EM>it was not so. </EM>Nor can they admit that the first
two races of men were too ethereal and phantom-like in their constitution,
organism, and <EM>shape, </EM>even to be called physical men.
For, if they do, it will be found that this is one of the reasons
why their relics can never be expected to be exhumed among other
fossils. Nevertheless all this is maintained. Man was the store-house,
so to speak, of <EM>all the seeds of life</EM> 
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* For suggestiveness, we would recommend a short article in the
<EM>Theosophist of </EM>August, 1887, &quot;Esoteric Studies.&quot;
Its author expounds therein quite an occult theory, though to
the world a new idea: &quot;the <EM>progress of the Monad </EM>concurring
with the <EM>retrogression </EM>of Form&quot; (666), <EM>i.e</EM>.,
&quot;with decrease of the <EM>vis formativa.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>He
says, &quot;Who knows what shape vehicled the Ego in remote <EM>rings</EM>
(Rounds, or races?) . . . ? May not man's type have been that
of the <EM>Simiadae </EM>in its variety? Might not the monkey-kingdom
of Ramayana fame rest on some far-off tradition relating to a
period when that was the common lot, or rather aspect, of man?&quot;
. . . and winds up a very clever, though too short, exposition
of his theory by saying that which every true occultist will endorse:
&quot;With physico-ethereal man there must be <EM>involution </EM>of
sex. As physico-astral man depended on entities of the sub-human
class (evolved from animal prototypes) for rebirth, so will physico-ethereal
man find among the graceful, shapely orders issuing from the <EM>air</EM>-plane,
one or more which will be developed for his successive embodiments
<EM>when procreated forms are given </EM>-- a process which will
include all mankind only very gradually. The (<EM>pre</EM>?) Adamic
and post-Adamic races were giants; their ethereal counterparts
may possibly be liliputians -- beauteous, luminous, diaphanous
-- but will assuredly be giants in mind&quot; (p. 671, art. by
Visconde de Figaniere, <STRONG>F.T.S.</STRONG>).<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 290 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
for this Round, vegetable and animal alike.* As En-Soph is &quot;One,
<EM>notwithstanding the innumerable forms which are in him</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Zohar,</EM>&quot; i. 2l<EM>a</EM>)<EM>, </EM>so is man,
on Earth the microcosm of the macrocosm. &quot;As soon as man
appeared, everything was complete. . . . for everything is comprised
in man. He <EM>unites in himself all forms</EM> (<EM>Ibid., iii.
</EM>48<EM>a</EM>).&quot; &quot;The mystery of the <EM>earthly
</EM>man is after the mystery of the Heavenly Man&quot; (<EM>ii.
</EM>76<EM>a</EM>). The human form -- so called, because it is
the vehicle (under whatever shape) of the <EM>divine </EM>man
-- is, as so intuitionally remarked by the author of &quot;Esoteric
Studies,&quot;** the <EM>new type, </EM>at the beginning of every
Round, &quot;as man never can be, so he never has been, manifested
in a shape belonging to the animal kingdom <EM>in esse.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>The author proceeds, &quot;he never formed part of that kingdom.
Derived, only derived, from the most finished class of the latter,
a new human form must always have been the <EM>new </EM>type of
the cycle. The human shape, in one ring (?), as I imagine, becomes
cast-off clothes in the next; it is then appropriated by the highest
order in the servant-kingdom below.&quot;
<P>
If the idea is what we understand it to mean -- for the &quot;rings&quot;
spoken of throw some confusion upon it -- then it is the correct
esoteric teaching. Having appeared at the very beginning, and
at the head of sentient and conscious life, man (the astral, or
the &quot;Soul,&quot; for the Zohar, repeating the archaic teaching,
distinctly says that &quot;the <EM>real </EM>man is the Soul,
and his material frame no part of him&quot;) -- man became the
living and animal <STRONG>U</STRONG>NIT, from which the &quot;cast-off
clothes&quot; determined the shape of every life and animal in
this Round.***
<P>
Thus, he &quot;created&quot; for ages the insects, reptiles, birds,
and animals, unconsciously to himself, from his remains and relics
from the Third and the Fourth Rounds. The same idea and teaching
are as distinctly given in the <EM>Vendidad </EM>of the Mazdeans,
as they are in the Chaldean and the Mosaic allegory of the Ark,
all of which are the many national versions of the original legend
given in the Hindu Scriptures. It is found in the allegory of
Vaivasvata Manu and <EM>his </EM>Ark with the Seven Rishis, as
in that of the Rishis, each of whom is shown the father and
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* It may be objected that this is a contradiction. That, as the
first Root-Race appeared 300,000,000 years after the vegetation
had evolved, the seed of vegetable life could not be in the First
Race. We say it could; for up to man's appearance in this Round,
the vegetation was of quite another kind than it is now, and quite
ethereal, this for the simple reason that no grass or plants could
have been physical, before there were animal or other organisms
to breathe out the carbonic acid which vegetation has to imbibe
for its development, its nutrition and growth. They are inter-dependent
in their <EM>physical </EM>and achieved forms.

<P>
progenitor of specified animals, reptiles, and even monsters (<EM>See
Vishnu</EM> and other <EM>Puranas</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Open the Mazdean
<EM>Vendidad, </EM>at Fargard ii., at verse 27 (73) and read the
command of Ormazd to Yima, a Spirit of the Earth, who symbolizes
the three races, after telling him to build a <EM>vara </EM>(&quot;an
enclosure,&quot; an <EM>argua </EM>or vehicle) . . . .
<P>
&quot;Thither (into the <EM>vara</EM>) thou shalt bring <EM>the
seeds of men and</EM> <EM>women, </EM>of the greatest, best, and
finest kinds on this earth; thither thou shalt bring the seeds
of every kind of cattle,&quot; etc., etc.; and v. 28 (74) . .
. .&quot;all those seeds shalt thou bring, two of every kind,
<EM>to be kept inexhaustible there, </EM>so long <EM>as those
men shall stay in the vara.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Those &quot;men&quot;
in the &quot;Vara&quot; are the &quot;Progenitors,&quot; the heavenly
men or Dhyani, the future <EM>Egos </EM>who are commissioned to
inform mankind. For &quot;Vara,&quot; or the &quot;Ark&quot; (or
again the Vehicle) simply means MAN.* Verse 30 says: . . . . &quot;thou
shalt seal up the vara (after filling it up with the seeds), and
thou shalt make a door and a <EM>window self-shining within,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>which is the Soul. And when Yima inquires of Ahura Mazda
how he shall manage to make that <EM>vara</EM>, he is answered:
&quot;Crush the earth . . . and knead it with thy hands, as the
potter does when kneading the potter's clay&quot; (31).
<P>
The Egyptian ram-headed god makes man of clay on a potter's wheel,
and so in Genesis do the Elohim fashion him out of the same material.
<P>
When the &quot;Maker of the material world&quot; (Ahura Mazda)
is asked, furthermore, what is to give light &quot;to the <EM>Vara
</EM>which Yima made,&quot; he is told that &quot;There are <EM>uncreated
</EM>lights and <EM>created </EM>lights&quot; and that &quot;there&quot;
(in Airyana Vaego, where <EM>Vara </EM>is built), &quot;the stars,
the moon, and the Sun are only once (a year) seen to rise and
set&quot; and a year seems only as a day (and night) a clear reference
to the &quot;land of the Gods&quot; or the (now) polar regions.
Moreover another hint is contained in this verse: a distinct allusion
to the &quot;uncreated lights&quot; which enlighten man within
-- his principles. Otherwise, no sense or reason could be found
in Ahura Mazda's answer (<EM>V.</EM> 40), which is forthwith followed
by Verse 41 saying that &quot;Every fortieth year, to every couple
(hermaphrodite) <EM>two are born, a male and female,&quot;** </EM>the
latter being a distinct echo of the Secret Doctrine, of a Stanza
which says --
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* This is the meaning when the allegory and symbol are opened
and read by means of the <EM>human </EM>key, or the key to terrestrial
anthroposophy. This interpretation of the &quot;ark&quot; symbolism
does not in the least interfere with its astronomical, or even
theogonic keys; nor with any of the other six meanings. Nor does
it seem less scientific than the modern theories about the origin
of man. As said, it has seven keys to it, like the rest.

Darmesteter's translation of the <EM>Vendidad. </EM>&quot;Sacred
Books of the East.&quot; <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 292 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
&quot;<EM>At the expiration of every forty </EM>(<EM>annual</EM>)<EM>
Suns, at the end of every</EM> <EM>fortieth Day, the double one
becomes four</EM>;<EM> male and female in one, in the</EM> <EM>first
and second and the third</EM>. . . . . .&quot;
<P>
Which is clear, since &quot;every sun&quot; meant a whole year,
the latter being composed of one day then, as in the arctic circle
it is now composed of six months. According to the old teaching,
the axis of the earth gradually changes its inclination to the
ecliptic, and at the period referred to, this inclination was
such that a polar day lasted during the whole period of the earth's
revolution about the sun, when a kind of twilight of very short
duration intervened; after which the polar land resumed its position
directly under the solar rays. This may be contrary to astronomy
as now taught and understood: but who can say that changes in
the motion of the earth, which do not take place now, did not
occur millions of years back?
<P>
Returning once more to the statement that <EM>Vara </EM>meant
the MAN of the Fourth Round, as much as the Earth of those days,
the moon, and even Noah's ark, if one will so have it -- this
is again shown in the dialogue between Ahura Mazda and Zarathustra.
Thus when the latter asks --
<P>
<EM>V. </EM>42. &quot;O Maker of the Material World, thou Holy
One! Who is he who brought the law of Mazda into the <EM>Vara
</EM>which Yima made?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Ahura Mazda answered: 'It was the bird Karshipta, O holy
Zarathustra.' . . . .&quot;
<P>
&quot;The bird Karshipta dwells in the heavens: were he living
on the earth he would be king of birds. He brought into the var
of Yima, and recites the Avesta <EM>in the language of birds.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Bund. xix and xxiv.</EM>)
<P>
This again is an allegory and a symbol misunderstood by the Orientalists
only, who see in this bird &quot;an incarnation of lightning,&quot;
and say its song was &quot;often thought to be the utterance of
a god and a revelation,&quot; and what not. Karshipta is the human
mind-soul, and the deity thereof, symbolized in ancient Magianism
by a bird, as the Greeks symbolized it by a butterfly. No sooner
had Karshipta entered the <EM>Vara </EM>or man, than he understood
the law of Mazda, or Divine Wisdom. In the &quot;Book of Concealed
Mystery&quot; it is said of the tree, which is the tree of knowledge
of good and evil: &quot;In its branches (of the tree) the birds
lodge and build their nests,&quot; or <EM>the Souls </EM>and the
Angels have their place!.* Therefore, with the Kabalists it was
a like symbol. &quot;Bird&quot; was a Chaldean, and has become
a Hebrew synonym and symbol for Angel, a Soul, a Spirit, or Deva;
and the &quot;Bird's Nest&quot; was with both Heaven, and is God's
bosom in the <EM>Zohar. </EM>The perfect Messiah enters Eden &quot;into
that place which is called the Bird's Nest&quot; (Zohar, ii.,
8<EM>b</EM>).

<P>
&quot;Like a bird that is flying from its nest, and that is the
Soul from which the Shekeenah (divine wisdom or grace) does not
move away&quot; (Zohar, iii., 278<EM>a</EM>; Myer's Qabbalah,
217). &quot;The Nest of the eternal Bird, the flutter of whose
wings produces life, is boundless space,&quot; says the Commentary,
meaning Hansa, the bird of Wisdom.
<P>
It is Adam Kadmon who is the (Sephirothal) tree, and it is he
who becomes the &quot;Tree of knowledge of good and evil&quot;
esoterically. And that &quot;tree hath around it seven columns
(seven pillars) of the world, or <EM>Rectores</EM>&quot;;<EM>
</EM>the same &quot;<EM>Progenitors</EM>&quot; or<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Sephiroth</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>again &quot;operating through the respective orders of Angels
in the spheres of the seven planets,&quot; etc., one of which
orders begets giants (<EM>Nephilim</EM>) on Earth.
<P>
It was the belief of entire antiquity, Pagan and Christian, that
the earliest mankind was a race of giants. Certain excavations
in America in mounds and in caves, have already yielded in isolated
cases groups of skeletons of nine and twelve feet high.* These
belong to tribes of the early Fifth Race, now degenerated to an
average size of between five and six feet. But we can easily believe
that the Titans and Cyclopes of old really belonged to the Fourth
(Atlantean) Race, and that all the subsequent legends and allegories
found in the Hindu Puranas and the Greek Hesiod and Homer, were
based on the hazy reminiscences of real Titans -- men of a superhuman
tremendous physical power, which enabled them to defend themselves,
and hold at bay the gigantic monsters of the Mesozoic and early
Cenozoic times -- and of actual Cyclopes -- three-eyed mortals.
<P>
It has been often remarked by observant writers, that the &quot;origin
of nearly every popular myth and legend could be traced invariably
to a fact in Nature.&quot;
<P>
In these fantastic creations of an exuberant subjectivism, there
is always an element of the objective and real. The imagination
of the masses, disorderly and ill-regulated as it may be, could
never have conceived and fabricated <EM>ex nihilo </EM>so many
monstrous figures, such a wealth of extraordinary tales, had it
not had, to serve it as a central nucleus, those floating reminiscences,
obscure and vague, which unite the broken links of the chain of
time to form with them the mysterious, dream foundation of our
collective consciousness.**

<P>
* Darwinian Evolutionists who are so wont to refer to the evidence
of <EM>reversion to</EM> <EM>type </EM>-- the full meaning of
which, in the case of human monsters, is embraced in the esoteric
solution of the embryological problem -- as proof of their arguments,
would do well to inquire into those instances of <EM>modern giants
</EM>who are often 8, 9, and even 11 feet high. Such <EM>reversions
</EM>are imperfect, yet undeniable reproductions of the original
towering man of primeval times.

Gould, from whose interesting and scientific volume a few passages
are quoted further on. See in Mr. Sinnett's &quot;<EM>Occult World,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>the description of a cavern in the Himalayas filled with
relics of human and animal giant bones.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 294 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
The evidence for the Cyclopes -- a race of giants -- will be pointed
out in forthcoming Sections, in the Cyclopean remnants, so called
to this day. An indication that, during its evolution and before
the final adjustment of the human organism -- which became perfect
and symmetrical only in the Fifth Race -- the early Fourth Race
may have been three-eyed, without having necessarily a third eye
in the middle of the brow, like the legendary Cyclops, is also
furnished by Science.
<P>
To the Occultists who believe that spiritual and psychic <EM>involution</EM>
proceeds on parallel lines with physical <EM>evolution</EM>;<EM>
</EM>that the <EM>inner</EM> senses -- innate in the first human
races -- atrophied during racial growth and the material development
of the outer senses; to the student of Esoteric symbology, finally,
this statement is no conjecture or possibility, but simply <EM>a
phase of the law of growth, a proven fact, </EM>in short. They
understand the meaning of this passage in the <EM>Commentaries
</EM>which says: --
<P>
&quot;<EM>There were four-armed human creatures in those early
days of the</EM> <EM>male-females </EM>(hermaphrodites); <EM>with
one head, yet three eyes. They</EM> <EM>could see before them
and behind them.* A </EM><STRONG>K</STRONG>ALPA<EM> later </EM>(after
the separation of the sexes) <EM>men having fallen into matter,
their spiritual vision</EM> <EM>became dim</EM>;<EM> and coordinately
the third eye commenced to lose its power.</EM> . . . <EM>When
the Fourth </EM>(<EM>Race</EM>)<EM> arrived at its middle age,
the inner vision</EM> <EM>had to be awakened, and </EM>acquired
by artificial stimuli, <EM>the process of</EM> <EM>which was known
to the old sages.** </EM>. . . <EM>The third eye, likewise, getting</EM>
<EM>gradually </EM>PETRIFIED<EM>,*** soon disappeared. The double-faced
became the</EM> <EM>one-faced, and the eye was drawn deep into
the head and is now buried</EM> <EM>under the hair. During the
activity of the inner man </EM>(during trances and spiritual visions)
<EM>the eye swells and expands. The Arhat sees and feels</EM>
<EM>it, and regulates his action accordingly</EM>. . . . . . .
. . . . . . .
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Viz., the third eye was at the back of the head. The statement
that the latest hermaphrodite humanity was &quot;four-armed,&quot;
unriddles probably the mystery of all the representations and
idols of the exoteric gods of India. On the Acropolis of Argos,
there was a [[<EM>Zoanon</EM>]],<EM> </EM>a rudely carved wooden
statue (attributed to Daedalus), representing a three-eyed colossus,
which was consecrated to Zeus <EM>Triopas </EM>(three-eyed). The
head of the &quot;god&quot; has two eyes in its face and one above
on the top of the forehead. It is considered the most archaic
of all the ancient statues (<EM>Schol. Vatic. ad Eurip. Troad.</EM>
14).
<P>
** The <EM>Inner</EM> <EM>sight </EM>could henceforth be acquired
only through training and initiation, save in the cases of &quot;natural
and born magicians,&quot; sensitives and mediums, as they are
called now.
<P>
*** This expression &quot;petrified&quot; instead of &quot;ossified&quot;
is curious. The &quot;back eye,&quot; which is of course the <EM>pineal
gland, </EM>now so-called, the small pea-like mass of grey nervous
matter attached to the back of the third ventricle of the brain,
is said to almost invariably contain <EM>mineral concretions </EM>and
<EM>sand</EM>, and &quot;nothing more.&quot; (<EM>Vide Infra.</EM>)
<HR>

<P>
<EM>The undefiled </EM>Lanoo (disciple, chela) <EM>need fear no
danger</EM>;<EM> he who keeps</EM> <EM>himself not in purity </EM>(who
is not chaste) <EM>will receive no help from the</EM> '<EM>deva
eye.</EM>'<EM> </EM>&quot;
<P>
Unfortunately not. The &quot;deva-eye&quot; exists no more for
the majority of mankind. The <EM>third eye is dead, </EM>and acts
no longer; but it has left behind a witness to its existence.
This witness is now the PINEAL GLAND. As for the &quot;four-armed&quot;
men, it is they who become the prototypes of the four-armed Hindu
gods, as shown in a preceding footnote.
<P>
Such is the mystery of the human eye that, in their vain endeavours
to explain and account for all the difficulties surrounding its
action, some scientists have been forced to resort to occult explanations.
The development of the <EM>Human eye </EM>gives more support to
the occult anthropology than to that of the materialistic physiologists.
&quot;The eyes in the human embryo <EM>grow from within without</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>out of the brain, instead of being part of the skin, as in
the insects and cuttlefish. Professor Lankester, thinking the
brain a queer place for the eye, and attempting to explain the
phenomenon on <EM>Darwinian lines, </EM>suggests the curious view
that &quot;our&quot; earliest vertebrate ancestor was a <EM>transparent
</EM>creature and hence did not mind where the eye was! And so
was man &quot;a transparent creature&quot; once upon a time, we
are taught, hence our theory holds good. But how does the Lankester
hypothesis square with the Haeckelian view that the vertebrate
eye originated by changes <EM>in the epidermis? </EM>If it started
<EM>inside, </EM>the theory goes into the waste-basket. This seems
to be proved by embryology. Moreover, Professor Lankester's extraordinary
suggestion -- or shall we say admission? -- is rendered perhaps
necessary by evolutionist necessities. Occultism with its teaching
as to the gradual development of senses &quot;FROM WITHIN WITHOUT,&quot;
from astral prototypes, is far more satisfactory: The <EM>third
eye retreated</EM> <EM>inwards </EM>when its course was run --
another point in favour of Occultism.
<P>
The allegorical expression of the Hindu mystics when speaking
of the &quot;eye of Siva,&quot; the <EM>Tri-bochana </EM>(&quot;three-eyed&quot;),
thus receives its justification and <EM>raison d</EM>'<EM>etre
-- the </EM>transference of the pineal gland (once that &quot;third
eye&quot;) to the forehead, being an exoteric licence. This throws
also a light on the mystery -- incomprehensible to some -- of
the connection between <EM>abnormal, </EM>or Spiritual Seership,
and the physiological purity of the Seer. The question is often
asked, &quot;Why should celibacy and chastity be a <EM>sine qua
non </EM>rule and condition of regular <EM>chelaship, or </EM>the
development of psychic and occult powers&quot; The answer is contained
in the Commentary. When we learn that the &quot;third eye&quot;
was once a physiological organ, and that later on, owing to the
gradual<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 296 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
disappearance of spirituality and increase of materiality (Spiritual
nature being extinguished by the physical), it became an atrophied
organ, as little understood now by physiologists as the spleen
is -- when we learn this, the connection will become clear. During
human life the greatest impediment in the way of spiritual development,
and especially to the acquirement of <EM>Yoga </EM>powers, is
the activity of our physiological senses. Sexual action being
closely connected, by interaction, with the spinal cord and the
grey matter of the brain, it is useless to give any longer explanation.
Of course, the normal and abnormal state of the brain, and the
degree of active work in the <EM>medulla oblongata, </EM>reacts
powerfully on the pineal gland, for, owing to the number of &quot;centres&quot;
in that region, which controls by far the greater majority of
the physiological actions of the animal economy, and also owing
to the close and intimate neighbourhood of the two, there must
be exerted a very powerful &quot;inductive&quot; action by the
<EM>medulla </EM>on the pineal gland.
<P>
All this is quite plain to the Occultist, but is very vague in
the sight of the general reader. The latter must then be shown
the possibility of a three-eyed man in nature, in those periods
when his formation was yet in a comparatively chaotic state. Such
a possibility may be inferred from anatomical and zoological knowledge,
first of all; then it may rest on the assumptions of materialistic
science itself.
<P>
It is asserted upon the authority of Science, and upon evidence,
which is not merely a fiction of theoretical speculation this
time, that many of the animals -- especially among the lower orders
of the vertebrata -- have a <EM>third </EM>eye, now atrophied,
but necessarily active in its origin.* The Hatteria species, a
lizard of the order <EM>Lacertilia, </EM>recently discovered in
New Zealand (<EM>a part of ancient Lemuria so called, mark</EM>
<EM>well</EM>)<EM>,</EM> presents this peculiarity in a most extraordinary
manner; and not only the <EM>Hatteria punctata, </EM>but the chameleon,
certain reptiles, and even fishes. It was thought, at first, that
it was no more than the prolongation of the brain ending with
a small protuberance, called epiphysis, a little bone separated
from the main bone by a cartilage, and found in every animal.
But it was soon found to be more than this. It offered -- as its
development and anatomical structure showed -- such an analogy
with that of the eye, that it was found impossible to see in it
any-

* &quot;Deeply placed within the head, covered by thick skin and
muscles, true eyes that cannot see are found in certain animals,&quot;

mice, blind snakes and lizards. . . . They shun daylight . . .
dwelling under the ground. <EM>They were not originally blind
</EM>but have evolved from ancestors that lived in the light and
had well-developed eyes. The atrophied eye beneath the opaque
skin may be found in these blind beings in every stage of reversion.&quot;
(&quot;<EM>Sense Organs,</EM>&quot;<EM> Haeckel</EM>.)<EM> </EM>And
if <EM>two </EM>eyes could become so atrophied in lower animals,
why not one eye -- the pineal gland -- in man, who is but a higher
animal in his physical aspect?<HR>

thing else. There were and are paleontologists who feel convinced
to this day that this &quot;third eye&quot; has functioned in
its origin, and they are certainly right. For this is what is
said of the pineal gland in Quain's Anatomy (<EM>Vol. II. ninth

&quot;It is from this part, constituting at first the whole and
subsequently the hinder part of the anterior primary encephalic
vesicle, that the optic vesicles are developed in the earliest
period, and the fore part is that in connection with which the
cerebral hemispheres and accompanying parts are formed. The <I>thalamus
opticus </I>of each side is formed by a lateral thickening of
the medullary wall, while the interval between, descending towards
the base, constitutes the cavity of the third ventricle with its
prolongation in the infundibulum. The grey commissure afterwards
stretches across the ventricular cavity. . . . . The hinder part
of the roof is developed by a peculiar process, to be noticed
later, into the pineal gland, which remains united on each side
by its pedicles to the <I>thalamus, </I>and behind these a transverse
band is formed as posterior commissure.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The lamina <I>terminalis </I>(<I>lamina cinerea</I>) continues
to close the third ventricle in front, below it the optic commissure
forms the floor of the ventricle, and further back the infundibulum
descends to be united in the <I>sella turcica </I>with the tissue
adjoining the posterior lobe of the pituitary body.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The two <I>optic thalami </I>formed from the posterior and
outer part of the anterior vesicle, consist at first of a single
hollow sac of nervous matter, the cavity of which communicates
on each side in front with that of the commencing cerebral hemispheres,
and behind with that of the middle cephalic vesicle<I> (corpora</I>
<I>quadrigemina</I>).<I> </I>Soon, however, by increased deposit
taking place in their interior, behind, below, and at the sides,
the<I> thalami</I> become solid, and at the same time a cleft
or fissure appears between them above, and penetrates down to
the internal cavity, which continues open at the back part opposite
the entrance of the Sylvian aqueduct. This cleft or fissure is
the <I>third ventricle. </I>Behind, the two thalami continue united
by the <I>posterior commissure, </I>which is distinguishable about
the end of the third month, and also by the peduncles of the pineal
gland. . . . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;At an early period the <I>optic tracts </I>may be recognised
as hollow prolongations from the outer part of the wall of the
<I>thalami </I>while they are still vesicular. At the fourth month
these tracts are distinctly formed. They subsequently are prolonged
backwards into connection with the <I>corpora quadrigemina.</I>

<P>
The above is specially interesting when it is remembered that,
were it not for the development of the hinder part of the cerebral
hemispheres backwards, the pineal gland would be perfectly visible
on the removal of the parietal bones. It is very interesting also
to note the obvious connection to be traced between the (originally)
hollow optic tracts and the eyes anteriorly, the pineal gland
and its peduncles behind, and all<HR>

<P>
of these with the optic thalami. So that the recent discoveries
in connection with the third eye of <EM>Hatteria punctata </EM>have
a very important bearing on the developmental history of the human
senses, and on the occult assertions in the text.
<P>
It is well known, (and also regarded as a fiction now, by those
who have ceased to believe in the existence of an immortal principle
in man,) that Descartes saw in the pineal gland the <EM>Seat of
the Soul. </EM>Although it is joined to every part of the body,
he said, there is one special portion of it in which the Soul
exercises its functions more specially than in any other. And,
as neither the heart, nor yet the brain could be that &quot;special&quot;
locality, he concluded that it was that little gland tied to the
brain, yet having an action independent of it, as it could easily
be put into a kind of swinging motion &quot;<EM>by the animal</EM>
<EM>Spirits* which cross </EM>the cavities of the skull in every
sense.&quot;
<P>
Unscientific as this may appear in our day of exact learning,
Descartes was yet far nearer the occult truth than is any Haeckel.
For the pineal gland, as shown, is far more connected with Soul
and Spirit than with the physiological senses of man. Had the
leading Scientists a glimmer of the <EM>real </EM>processes employed
by the Evolutionary Impulse, and the winding <EM>cyclic </EM>course
of this great law, they would <EM>know </EM>instead of conjecturing;
and feel as certain of the future physical transformations of
the human kind by the knowledge of its past forms. Then, would
they see the fallacy and all the absurdity of their modern &quot;blind-force&quot;
and mechanical processes of nature; realizing, in consequence
of such knowledge, that the said pineal gland, for instance, could
not but be disabled for <EM>physical </EM>use at this stage of
our cycle. If the odd &quot;eye&quot; in man is now atrophied,
it is a proof that, as in the lower animal, it has once been active;
for nature never creates the smallest, the most insignificant
form without some definite purpose and use. It was an <EM>active
</EM>organ, we say, at that stage of evolution when the spiritual
element in man reigned supreme over the hardly nascent intellectual
and psychic elements. And, as the cycle ran down toward that point
when the physiological senses were developed by, and went <EM>pari
passu </EM>with, the growth and consolidation of the physical
man, the interminable and complex vicissitudes and tribulations
of zoological development, that median &quot;eye&quot; ended by
atrophying along with the early spiritual and purely psychic characteristics
in man. The eye is the mirror and also the window of the soul,
says popular wisdom,** and <EM>Vox populi Vox Dei.</EM>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 299 THE EVOLUTION OF THE EYE.</H6>

<P>
In the beginning, every class and family of living species was
hermaphrodite and objectively one-eyed. In the animal, whose form
was as ethereal (astrally) as that of man, before the bodies of
both began to evolve their coats of skin, viz., to evolve from
<EM>within without </EM>the thick coating of physical substance
or matter with its internal physiological mechanism -- the third
eye was primarily, as in man, the only seeing organ. The two physical
front eyes developed* later on in both brute and man, whose organ
of physical sight was, at the commencement of the Third Race,
in the same position as that of some of the blind vertebrata,
in our day, <EM>i.e</EM>., beneath an opaque skin.** Only the
stages of the <EM>odd, </EM>or primeval eye, in man and brute,
are now inverted, as the former has already passed that animal
<EM>non-rational </EM>stage in the Third Round, and is ahead of
mere brute creation by a whole plane of consciousness. Therefore,
while the &quot;Cyclopean&quot; eye was, and still <EM>is, </EM>in
man the organ of <EM>spiritual </EM>sight, in the animal it was
that of objective vision. And this eye, having performed its function,
was replaced, in the course of physical evolution from the simple
to the complex, by two eyes, and thus was stored and laid aside
by nature for further use in AEons to come.
<P>
This explains why the pineal gland reached its highest development
proportionately with the lowest physical development. It is the
vertebrata in which it is the most prominent and objective, and
in man it is
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] and ethereal without;
the <EM>second, </EM>psycho-spiritual mentally, and ethero-physical
bodily; the <EM>third, </EM>still bereft of intellect in its beginning,
is astro-physical in its body, and lives an inner life, in which
the psycho-spiritual element is in no way interfered with as yet
by the hardly nascent physiological senses. Its two front eyes
look before them without seeing either past or future. But the
&quot;third eye&quot; &quot;<EM>embraces ETERNITY.</EM>&quot;
<P>
* But in a very different manner to that pictured by Haeckel as
an &quot;<EM>evolution by</EM> <EM>natural selection in the struggle
for existence</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(&quot;<EM>Pedigree of Man.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>&quot;<EM>Sense Organs,</EM>&quot; p. 335). The mere &quot;thermal
sensibility of the skin,&quot; to hypothetical light-waves, is
absurdly incompetent to account for the beautiful combination
of adaptations present in the eye. It has, moreover, been previously
shown that &quot;natural Selection&quot; is a pure myth when credited
with the <EM>origination </EM>of variations (<EM>vide infra, Part
III., on Darwinian mechanical causation</EM>);<EM> </EM>as the
&quot;survival of the fittest&quot; can only take place after
useful variations have sprung up, together with improved organisms.
Whence came the &quot;useful variations,&quot; which developed
the eye? Only from &quot;blind forces . . . without aim, without
design?&quot; The argument is puerile. The true solution of the
mystery is to be found in the impersonal Divine Wisdom, in its
<STRONG>I</STRONG>DEATION -- reflected through matter.
<P>
** Palaeontology has ascertained that in the animals of the Cenozoic
age -- the Saurians especially, such as the antediluvian <EM>Labyrinthodon,
</EM>whose fossil skull exhibits a perforation otherwise inexplicable
-- the third, or odd eye must have been much developed. Several
naturalists, among others E. Korscheldt, feel convinced that whereas,
notwithstanding the opaque skin covering it, such an eye in the
reptiles of the present period can only distinguish light from
darkness (as the human eyes do when bound with a handkerchief,
or even tightly closed), in the now extinct animals that eye functioned
and was a real organ of vision.<HR>

most carefully hidden and inaccessible, except to the anatomist.
No less light is thrown thereby on the future physical, spiritual,
and intellectual state of mankind, in periods corresponding on
parallel lines with other past periods, and always on the lines
of ascending and descending cyclic evolution and development.
Thus, a few centuries before the <EM>Kali yuga -- </EM>the black
age which began nearly 5,000 years ago -- it was said (paraphrased
into comprehensible sentences):
<P>
&quot;<EM>We </EM>(the Fifth Root-Race) <EM>in our first half
</EM>(of duration) <EM>onward</EM> (on the now ASCENDING arc of
the cycle) <EM>are on the mid point of </EM>(or between) <EM>the
First and the Second Races -- falling downward </EM>(<EM>i.e.,
</EM>the races were then on the descending arc of the cycle).
. . . . <EM>Calculate for thyself,</EM> Lanoo, <EM>and see.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(Commentary xx.).
<P>
Calculating as advised, we find that during that transitional
period -- namely, in the second half of the First Spiritual ethero-astral
race -- nascent mankind was devoid of the intellectual brain element.
As it was on its <EM>descending </EM>line, and as we are parallel
to it, on the <EM>ascending, </EM>we are,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
EVOLUTION OF ROOT RACES IN THE FOURTH ROUND
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<IMG SRC="sd2-300.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
therefore devoid of the Spiritual element, which is now replaced
by the intellectual. For, remember well, as we are in the <EM>manasa
</EM>period of our cycle of races, or in the Fifth, we have, therefore,
crossed the meridian point of the perfect adjustment of Spirit
and Matter -- or that equilibrium between brain intellect and
Spiritual perception. One important point has, however, to be
borne in mind. <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 301 THE ODD EYE IS NOW A GLAND.</H6>

<P>
We are only in the Fourth Round, and it is in the Fifth that the
full development of <EM>Manas, </EM>as a direct ray from the Universal
MAHAT -- a ray unimpeded by matter -- will be finally reached.
Nevertheless, as every sub-race and nation have their cycles and
stages of developmental evolution repeated on a smaller scale,
it must be the more so in the case of a Root-Race. Our race then
has, as a Root-race, crossed the equatorial line and is cycling
onward on the Spiritual side; but some of our sub-races still
find themselves on the shadowy descending arc of their respective
national cycles; while others again -- the oldest -- having crossed
their crucial point, which alone decides whether a race, a nation,
or a tribe will live or perish, are at the apex of spiritual development
as sub-races.
<P>
It becomes comprehensible now why the &quot;odd eye&quot; has
been gradually transformed into a simple gland, after the physical
Fall of those we have agreed to call the &quot;Lemurians.&quot;
<P>
It is a curious fact that it is especially in human beings that
the cerebral hemispheres and the lateral ventricles have been
developed, and that the <EM>optic thalami, corpora quadrigemina,
</EM>and <EM>corpora striata</EM> are the principal parts which
are developed in the mammalian brain. Moreover it is asserted
that the intellect of any man may to some extent be gauged by
the development of the central convolutions and the fore part
of the cerebral hemispheres. It would seem a natural corollary
that if the development and increased size of the pineal gland
may be considered to be an index of the astral capacities and
spiritual proclivities of any man, there will be a corresponding
development of that part of the cranium, or an increase in the
size of the pineal gland at the expense of the hinder part of
the cerebral hemispheres. It is a curious speculation which would
receive a confirmation in this case. We should see, below and
behind, the cerebellum which has been held to be the seat of all
the animal proclivities of a human being, and which is allowed
by science to be the great centre for all the physiologically
co-ordinated movements of the body, such as walking, eating, etc.,
etc.; in front, the fore-part of the brain -- the cerebral hemispheres
-- the part especially connected with the development of the intellectual
powers in man; and in the middle, dominating them both, and especially
the animal functions, the developed pineal gland, in connection
with the more highly evolved, or spiritual man.
<P>
It must be remembered that these are only physical correspondences;
just as the ordinary human brain is the registering organ of memory,
but not memory itself.
<P>
This is, then, the organ which gave rise to so many legends and
traditions, among others to that of man with one head but two
faces. These may be found in several Chinese works, besides being
referred to in the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 302 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Chaldean fragments. Apart from the work already cited -- the Shan
Hai King, compiled by King Chia from engravings on nine urns made
2,255 <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>., by the Emperor Yu, they may be found
in another work, called the &quot;Bamboo Books,&quot; and in a
third one, the &quot;Rh Ya&quot; -- &quot;initiated according
to tradition by Chow Kung, uncle of Wu Wang, the first Emperor
of the Chow Dynasty, <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>., 1,122&quot;: -- says
Mr. Ch. Gould in his &quot;<EM>Mythical Monsters.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>The Bamboo Books contain the ancient annals of China, found
<STRONG>A.D</STRONG>. 279 at the opening of the grave of King
Seang of Wai, who died <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>. 295. Both these works
mention men with two faces on one head -- one in front and one
behind (<EM>p</EM>. 27).
<P>
Now that which the students of Occultism ought to know is that
THE &quot;THIRD EYE&quot; IS INDISSOLUBLY CONNECTED WITH <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA.
The tenet is so mysterious that very few have heard of it.
<P>
The &quot;eye of Siva&quot; did not become entirely atrophied
before the close of the Fourth Race. When spirituality and all
the divine powers and attributes of the deva-man of the Third
had been made the hand-maidens of the newly-awakened physiological
and psychic passions of the physical man, instead of the reverse,
the eye lost its powers. But such was the law of Evolution, and
it was, in strict accuracy, no FALL. The sin was not in using
those newly-developed powers, but in <EM>misusing </EM>them; in
making of the tabernacle, designed to contain a god, the fane
of every <EM>spiritual </EM>iniquity. And if we say &quot;sin&quot;
it is merely that everyone should understand our meaning; as the
term <EM>Karma* </EM>would be the right one to use in this case;
while the reader who would feel perplexed at the use of the term
&quot;spiritual&quot; instead of &quot;physical&quot; iniquity,
is reminded of the fact that there can be no physical iniquity.
The body is simply the irresponsible organ, the tool of the <EM>psychic,
</EM>if not of the &quot;Spiritual man.&quot; While in the case
of the Atlanteans, it was precisely the Spiritual being which
sinned, the Spirit element being still the &quot;Master&quot;
principle in man, in those days. Thus it is in those days that
the heaviest Karma of the Fifth Race was generated by our Monads.
<P>
As this sentence may again be found puzzling, it is better that
it should be explained for the benefit of those who are ignorant
of the theosophical teachings.
<P>
Questions with regard to <EM>Karma </EM>and <EM>re-births </EM>are
constantly offered, and a great confusion seems to exist upon
this subject. Those who are born and bred in the Christian faith,
and have been trained in the idea
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Karma is a word of many meanings, and has a special term for
almost every one of its aspects. It means, as a synonym of sin,
the performance of some action for the attainment of an object
of <EM>worldly</EM>, hence<EM> selfish, </EM>desire, which cannot
fail to be hurtful to somebody else. Karman is action, the Cause;
and Karma again is &quot;the law of ethical causation&quot;; the
<EM>effect </EM>of an act produced egotistically, when the great
law of harmony depends on altruism.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 303 THE NUMBER OF MONADS IS LIMITED.</H6>

<P>
that a new soul is created by God for every newly-born infant,
are among the most perplexed. They ask whether in such case the
number of incarnating Monads on earth is limited; to which they
are answered in the affirmative. For, however countless, in our
conceptions, the number of the incarnating monads -- even if we
take into account the fact that ever since the Second Race, when
their respective seven groups were furnished with bodies, several
births and deaths may be allowed for every second of time in the
aeons already passed -- still, there must be a limit. It was stated
that Karma-Nemesis, whose bond-maid is Nature, adjusted everything
in the most harmonious manner; and that, therefore, the fresh
pouring-in, or arrival of new Monads, had ceased as soon as Humanity
had reached its full physical development. No fresh Monads have
incarnated since the middle-point of the Atlanteans. Hence, remembering
that, save in the case of young children, and of individuals whose
lives were violently cut off by some accident, no Spiritual Entity
can re-incarnate before a period of many centuries has elapsed,
such gaps alone must show that the number of Monads is necessarily
finite and limited. Moreover, a reasonable time must be given
to other animals for their evolutionary progress.
<P>
Hence the assertion that many of us are now working off the effects
of the evil Karmic causes produced by us in Atlantean bodies.
The Law of <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA is inextricably interwoven with
that of Re-incarnation.
<P>
It is only the knowledge of the constant re-births of one and
the same individuality throughout the life-cycle; the assurance
that the same <STRONG>M</STRONG>ONADS -- among whom are many Dhyan-Chohans,
or the &quot;Gods&quot; themselves -- have to pass through the
&quot;Circle of Necessity,&quot; rewarded or punished by such
rebirth for the suffering endured or crimes committed in the former
life; that those very Monads, which entered the empty, senseless
shells, or astral figures of the First Race emanated by the Pitris,
are the same who are now amongst us -- nay, ourselves, perchance;
it is only this doctrine, we say, that can explain to us the mysterious
problem of Good and Evil, and reconcile man to the terrible and
<EM>apparent</EM> injustice of life. Nothing but such certainty
can quiet our revolted sense of justice. For, when one unacquainted
with the noble doctrine looks around him, and observes the inequalities
of birth and fortune, of intellect and capacities; when one sees
honour paid fools and profligates, on whom fortune has heaped
her favours by mere privilege of birth, and their nearest neighbour,
with all his intellect and noble virtues ---far more deserving
in every way --perishing of want and for lack of sympathy; when
one sees all this and has to turn away, helpless to relieve the
undeserved suffering, one's ears ringing and heart aching with
the cries of<HR>

pain around him -- that blessed knowledge of Karma alone prevents
him from cursing life and men, as well as their supposed Creator.*
<P>
Of all the terrible blasphemies and accusations virtually thrown
on their God by the Monotheists, none is greater or more unpardonable
than that (almost always) false humility which makes the presumably
&quot;pious&quot; Christian assert, in connection with every evil
and undeserved blow, that &quot;such <EM>is the will </EM>of God.&quot;

Dolts and hypocrites! Blasphemers and impious Pharisees, who speak
in the same breath of the endless merciful love and care of their
God and creator for helpless man, and of that God <EM>scourging
the good, the</EM> <EM>very best of his creatures, bleeding them
to death like an insatiable</EM> <EM>Moloch! </EM>Shall we be
answered to this, in Congreve's words: --
<P>
&quot;But who shall dare to tax Eternal Justice?&quot; <EM>Logic
and simple</EM> <EM>common sense, </EM>we answer: if we are made
to believe in the &quot;original Sin,&quot; in <EM>one </EM>life,
on this Earth only, for every Soul, and in an anthropomorphic
Deity, who seems to have created some men only for the pleasure
of condemning them to eternal hell-fire (and this whether they
are good or bad, says the Predestinarian),** why should not every
man endowed with reasoning powers condemn in his turn such a villainous
Deity? Life would become unbearable, if one had to believe in
the God created by man's unclean fancy. Luckily he exists only
in human dogmas, and in the unhealthy imagination of some poets,
who believe they have solved the problem by addressing him as
--

Of thy <I>presuming</I> creatures! . . . .&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Truly a robust &quot;faith&quot; is required to believe that it
is &quot;presumption&quot; to question the justice of one, who
creates helpless little man but to &quot;perplex&quot; him, and
to test a &quot;faith&quot; with which that &quot;Power,&quot;
moreover, may have forgotten, if not neglected, to endow him,
as happens sometimes.
<P>
Compare this blind faith with the philosophical belief, based
on every reasonable evidence and life-experience, in Karma-Nemesis,
or the Law of Retribution. This Law -- whether Conscious or Uncon-

it is absolutely <EM>out of the question </EM>to attempt a reply

A noble and encouraging Doctrine this!<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 305 THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION.</H6>

<P>
scious -- predestines nothing and no one. It exists from and in
Eternity, truly, for it is <STRONG>E</STRONG>TERNITY itself; and
as such, since no act can be co-equal with eternity, it cannot
be said to act, for it is ACTION itself. It is not the Wave which
drowns a man, but the <EM>personal </EM>action of the wretch,
who goes deliberately and places himself under the <EM>impersonal
</EM>action of the laws that govern the Ocean's motion. Karma
creates nothing, nor does it design. It is man who plans and creates
causes, and Karmic law adjusts the effects; which adjustment is
not an act, but universal harmony, tending ever to resume its
original position, like a bough, which, bent down too forcibly,
rebounds with corresponding vigour. If it happen to dislocate
the arm that tried to bend it out of its natural position, shall
we say that it is the bough which broke our arm, or that our own
folly has brought us to grief? Karma has never sought to destroy
intellectual and individual liberty, like the God invented by
the Monotheists. It has not involved its decrees in darkness purposely
to perplex man; nor shall it punish him who dares to scrutinise
its mysteries. On the contrary, he who unveils through study and
meditation its intricate paths, and throws light on those dark
ways, in the windings of which so many men perish owing to their
ignorance of the labyrinth of life, is working for the good of
his fellow-men. <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA is an Absolute and Eternal
law in the World of manifestation; and as there can only be one
Absolute, as One eternal ever present Cause, believers in Karma
cannot be regarded as Atheists or materialists -- still less as
fatalists:&quot;
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Some theosophists, in order to make Karma more comprehensible
to the Western mind, as being better acquainted with the Greek
than with Aryan philosophy, have made an attempt to translate
it by <EM>Nemesis. </EM>Had the latter been known to the profane
in antiquity, as it was understood by the Initiate, this translation
of the term would be unobjectionable. As it is, it has been too
much anthropomorphised by Greek fancy to permit our using it without
an elaborate explanation. With the early Greeks, &quot;from Homer
to Herodotus, she was no goddess, but a <EM>moral feeling </EM>rather,&quot;
says Decharme; the barrier to evil and immorality. He who transgresses
it, commits a sacrilege in the eyes of the gods, and is pursued
by Nemesis. But, with time, that &quot;feeling&quot; was deified,
and its personification became an ever-fatal and punishing goddess.
Therefore, if we would connect Karma with Nemesis, it has to be
done in the triple character of the latter, viz., as Nemesis,
Adrasteia and Themis. For, while the latter is the goddess of
Universal Order and Harmony, who, like Nemesis, is commissioned
to repress every excess, and keep man within the limits of Nature
and righteousness under severe penalty, <EM>Adrasteia -- </EM>&quot;the
inevitable&quot; -- represents Nemesis as the immutable effect
of causes created by man himself. Nemesis, as the daughter of
<EM>Dike, </EM>is the equitable goddess reserving her wrath for
those alone who are maddened with pride, egoism, and impiety.
(<EM>See Mesomed. Hymn. Nemes., V. 2. Brunck, Analecta II.</EM>
<EM>p</EM>. 292;<EM> Mythol. de la Grece Antique, p. </EM>304.)
In short, while Nemesis is a mythological, exoteric goddess, or
Power, personified and anthropomorphised in its various aspects,
<EM>Karma </EM>is a highly philosophical truth, a most divine
noble expression of the primitive intuition of man concerning
Deity. It is a doctrine which explains the origin of Evil, and

<P>
for Karma is one with the Unknowable, of which it is an aspect
in its effects in the phenomenal world.
<P>
Intimately, or rather indissolubly, connected with Karma, then,
is the law of re-birth, or of the re-incarnation of the same spiritual
individuality in a long, almost interminable, series of personalities.
The latter are like the various costumes and characters played
by the same actor, with each of which that actor identifies himself
and is identified by the public, for the space of a few hours.
The <EM>inner, </EM>or real man, who personates those characters,
knows the whole time that he is Hamlet for the brief space of
a few acts, which represent, however, on the plane of human illusion
the whole life of Hamlet. And he knows that he was, the night
before, King Lear, the transformation in his turn of the Othello
of a still earlier preceding night; but the outer, visible character
is supposed to be ignorant of the fact. In actual life that ignorance
is, unfortunately, but too real. Nevertheless, the <EM>permanent
</EM>individuality is fully aware of the fact, though, through
the atrophy of the &quot;spiritual&quot; eye in the physical body,
that knowledge is unable to impress itself on the consciousness
of the false personality.
<P>
The possession of a physical <EM>third </EM>eye, we are told,
was enjoyed by the men of the Third Root-Race down to nearly the
middle period of Third <STRONG>S</STRONG>UB-race of the Fourth
Root-Race, when the consolidation and perfection of the human
frame made it disappear from the outward anatomy of man. Psychically
and spiritually, however, its mental and visual perceptions lasted
till nearly the end of the Fourth Race, when its functions, owing
to the materiality and depraved condition of mankind, died out
altogether before the submersion of the bulk of the Atlantean
continent. And now we may return to the Deluges and their many
&quot;Noahs.&quot;
<P>
The student has to bear in mind that there were many such deluges
as that mentioned in Genesis, and three far more important ones,
which will be mentioned and described in the Section devoted to
the subject of pre-historic continents. To avoid erroneous conjectures,
however, with regard to the claim that the esoteric doctrine has
much in it of the legends contained in the Hindu Scriptures; that,
again, the chronology of the latter is almost that of the former
-- only explained and made clear; and that finally the belief
that &quot;Vaivasvata Manu&quot; -- a generic name indeed! --
was the Noah of the Aryans and his prototype, all this, which
is also the belief of the Occultists, necessitates at this juncture
a new explanation. (<EM>Vide</EM> Part III. <EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Submerged
Continents.</EM>&quot;)
