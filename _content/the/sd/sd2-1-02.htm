<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) Lha is the ancient word in trans-Himalayan regions
for &quot;Spirit,&quot; any celestial or <EM>superhuman </EM>Being,
and it covers the whole series of heavenly hierarchies, from Archangel,
or Dhyani, down to an angel of darkness, or terrestrial Spirit.
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>) This expression shows in plain language that the
Spirit-Guardian of our globe, which is the fourth in the chain,
is subordinate to the chief Spirit (or God) of the Seven Planetary
Genii or Spirits. As already explained, the ancients had, in their
Kyriel of gods, seven chief Mystery-gods, whose chief was, <EM>exoterically,
</EM>the visible Sun, or the eighth, and,<EM> esoterically, </EM>the<EM>
second Logos, </EM>the Demiurge. The seven (who have now become
the &quot;Seven Eyes of the Lord&quot; in the Christian religion)
were the regents of the seven <EM>chief </EM>planets; but these
were not

* All the words and sentences placed in brackets in the Stanzas
and Commentaries are the writer's. In some places they may be
incomplete and even inadequate from the Hindu standpoint; but
in the meaning attached to them in Trans-Himalayan Esotericism
they are correct. In every case the writer takes any blame upon
herself. Having never claimed personal infallibility, that which
is given on her own authority may leave much to be desired, in
the very abstruse cases where too deep metaphysics is involved.
The teaching is offered as it is understood; and as there are
seven keys of interpretation to every symbol and allegory, that
which may not fit a meaning, say from the psychological or astronomical
aspect, will be found quite correct from the physical or metaphysical.

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 23 THE ACTION OF THE GREAT BREATH.</H6>

<P>
reckoned according to the enumeration devised later by people
who had forgotten, or who had an inadequate notion of, the real
<EM>Mysteries, </EM>and included neither the sun, the moon, nor
the earth. The sun was the chief, exoterically, of the twelve
great gods, or zodiacal constellations; and, esoterically, the
Messiah, the Christos (the subject <EM>anointed </EM>by the <STRONG>G</STRONG>reat
<STRONG>B</STRONG>REATH, or the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE) surrounded
by his twelve subordinate powers, also subordinate, in turn, to
each of the seven &quot;Mystery-gods&quot; of the planets.
<P>
&quot;The seven higher make the Seven Lhas create the world,&quot;
states a Commentary; which means that our Earth, leaving aside
the rest, was <EM>created </EM>or fashioned by terrestrial spirits,
the &quot;Regents&quot; being simply the supervisors. This is
the first germ, the seed of that which grew later into the Tree
of Astrology and Astrolatry. The Higher ones were the <EM>Kosmocratores,
</EM>the fabricators of our solar system. This is borne out by
all the ancient Cosmogonies: that of Hermes, of the Chaldees,
of the Aryans, of the Egyptians, and even of the Jews. Heaven's
belt, the signs of the Zodiac (the <EM>Sacred animals</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>are as much the Bne' Alhim (Sons of the Gods or the Elohim)
as the Spirits of the Earth; but they are prior to them. Soma
and Sin, Isis and Diana, are all lunar gods or goddesses, called
the fathers and mothers of our Earth, which is subordinate to
them. But these, in their turn, are subordinate to their &quot;Fathers&quot;
and &quot;Mothers&quot; -- the latter interchangeable and varying
with each nation -- the gods and their planets, such as Jupiter,
Saturn Bel, Brihaspati, etc.
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>) &quot;His breath gave life to the seven,&quot; refers
as much to the sun, who gives life to the Planets, as to the &quot;High
One,&quot; the <EM>Spiritual Sun, </EM>who gives life to the whole
Kosmos. The astronomical and astrological keys opening the gate
leading to the mysteries of Theogony can be found only in the
later glossaries, which accompany the Stanzas.
<P>
In the apocalyptic Slokas of the Archaic Records, the language
is as symbolical, if less mythical, than in the Puranas. Without
the help of the later <EM>commentaries,</EM>compiled by generations
of adepts, it would be impossible to understand the meaning correctly.
In the ancient Cosmogonies, the visible and the invisible worlds
are the double links of one and the same chain. As the invisible
<EM>Logos, </EM>with its seven hierarchies (represented or personified
each by its chief angel or rector), form one POWER, the inner
and the invisible; so, in the world of Forms, the Sun and the
seven chief Planets constitute the visible and active potency;
the latter &quot;Hierarchy&quot; being, so to speak, the visible
and objective <EM>Logos </EM>of the invisible and (except in the
lowest grades) ever-subjective angels.
<P>
Thus -- to anticipate a little by way of illustration -- every
Race in its<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 24 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
evolution is said to be born under the direct influence of one
of the Planets: Race the first receiving its breath of life from
the Sun, as will be seen later on; while the third humanity --
those who fell into generation, or from androgynes became separate
entities, one male and the other female -- are said to be under
the direct influence of Venus, &quot;<EM>the little sun </EM>in
which the solar orb stores his light.&quot;
<P>
The summation of the Stanzas in Book I. showed the genesis* of
Gods and men taking rise in, and from, one and the same Point,
which is the One Universal, Immutable, Eternal, and absolute <STRONG>U</STRONG>NITY.
In its primary manifested aspect we have seen it become: (1) in
the sphere of objectivity and Physics, Primordial Substance and
Force (centripetal and centrifugal, positive and negative, male
and female, etc., etc.); (2) in the world of Metaphysics, the
<STRONG>S</STRONG>PIRIT OF THE <STRONG>U</STRONG>NIVERSE, or Cosmic
Ideation, called by some the <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS.
<P>
This <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS is the apex of the Pythagorean triangle.
When the triangle is complete it becomes the Tetraktis, or the
Triangle in the Square, and is the dual symbol of the four-lettered
<EM>Tetragrammaton</EM> in the manifested Kosmos, and of its radical
triple RAY in the unmanifested, or its <EM>noumenon.</EM> 
<P>
Put more metaphysically, the classification given here of Cosmic
Ultimates, is more one of convenience than of absolute philosophical
accuracy. At the commencement of a great Manvantara, Parabrahm
manifests as Mulaprakriti and then as the Logos. This Logos is
equivalent to the &quot;Unconscious Universal Mind,&quot; etc.,
of Western Pantheists. It constitutes the Basis of the SUBJECT-side
of manifested Being, and is the source of all manifestations of
individual consciousness. Mulaprakriti or Primordial Cosmic Substance,
is the foundation of the OBJECT-side of things -- the basis of
all objective evolution and Cosmogenesis. Force, then, does not
emerge with Primordial Substance from Parabrahmic Latency. It
is <EM>the transformation into energy of the supra-conscious thought
of the Logos, </EM>infused, so to speak, into the objectivation
of the latter out of potential latency in the One Reality. Hence
spring the wondrous laws of matter: hence the &quot;primal impress&quot;
so vainly discussed by Bishop Temple. Force thus is <EM>not synchronous
with the first objectivation of Mulaprakriti. </EM>But as, apart
from it, the latter is absolutely and necessarily inert -- <EM>a
mere abstraction</EM> -- it is unnecessary to weave too fine a
cobweb of subtleties as to the order of succession of

* According to Dr. A. Wilder's learned definition, Genesis, [[<EM>genesis</EM>]],
is not generation, but &quot;<EM>a coming out of the eternal </EM>into
the Kosmos and Time&quot;: &quot;a coming from <EM>esse </EM>into
<EM>exsistere,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>or &quot;from <STRONG>B</STRONG>E-NESS
into 'being' &quot; -- as a Theosophist would say.<HR>

<P>
the Cosmic Ultimates. Force <EM>succeeds </EM>Mulaprakriti; but,
<EM>minus </EM>Force, Mulaprakriti is for all practical intents
and purposes non-existent.*
<P>
The &quot;Heavenly Man&quot; (Tetragrammaton) who is the Protogonos,
Tikkoun, the firstborn from the passive deity and the first manifestation
of that deity's shadow, is the universal form and idea, which
engenders the manifested Logos, Adam Kadmon, or the four-lettered
symbol, in the Kabala, of the <EM>Universe itself, </EM>also called
the <EM>second Logos</EM>. The<EM> </EM>second springs from the
first and develops the third triangle (see the Sephirothal Tree);
from the last of which (the lower host of Angels) MEN are generated.
It is with this third aspect that we shall deal at present.
<P>
The reader must bear in mind that there is a great difference
between the <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS and the <EM>Demiurgos, </EM>for
one is <EM>Spirit </EM>and the other is <EM>Soul; </EM>or as Dr.
Wilder has it: &quot;<EM>Dianoia</EM> and<EM> Logos </EM>are synonymous,
<EM>Nous </EM>being superior and closely in affinity with [[<EM>T</EM>o<EM>
agathon</EM>]], one being the superior apprehending, the other
the comprehending -- one noetic and the other phrenic.&quot;
<P>
Moreover, Man was regarded in several systems as the <EM>third
Logos. </EM>The esoteric meaning of the word <EM>Logos </EM>(speech
or word, <EM>Verbum</EM>)<EM> </EM>is the rendering in objective
expression, as in a photograph, of the concealed thought. The
<EM>Logos </EM>is the mirror reflecting DIVINE MIND, and the Universe
is the mirror of the Logos, though the latter is the <EM>esse
</EM>of that Universe. As the <EM>Logos</EM> reflects <EM>all</EM>
in the Universe of Pleroma, so man reflects in himself all that
he sees and finds in <EM>his </EM>Universe, the Earth. It is the
three Heads of the Kabala: &quot;<EM>Unum intra alterum, et alterum
super alterum</EM>&quot; (<EM>Zohar, Idra Suta, </EM>sec. <STRONG>VII</STRONG>).
&quot;Every Universe (world or planet) has its own Logos,&quot;
says the doctrine. The Sun was always called by the Egyptians
&quot;the eye of Osiris,&quot; and was himself the <EM>Logos,
</EM>the first-begotten, or light made manifest to the world,
&quot;which is the Mind and divine intellect of the Concealed.&quot;
It is only by the sevenfold Ray of this light that we can become
cognizant of the Logos through the Demi-urge, regarding the latter
as the <EM>creator </EM>of our planet and everything pertaining
to it, and the former as the guiding Force of that &quot;Creator&quot;
-- good and bad at the same time, the origin of good and the origin
of evil. This &quot;Creator&quot; is neither good nor bad <EM>per
se, </EM>but its differentiated aspects in nature make it assume
one or the other character. With the invisible and the unknown
Universes disseminated through space, none of the sun-gods had
anything to do. The idea is expressed very clearly in the &quot;Books
of Hermes,&quot; and in every ancient folk lore. It is symbolised
generally by the Dragon and the Serpent -- the Dragon of Good
and the Serpent of Evil, represented on Earth by

the right and the left-hand Magic. In the epic poem of Finland,
the Kalewala,* the origin of the Serpent of Evil is given: it
is born from the &quot;spittle of Suoyatar . . . . and endowed
with a living Soul by the Principle of Evil,&quot; Hisi. A strife
is described between the two, the &quot;thing of Evil&quot; (the
Serpent or Sorcerer), and Ahti, the Dragon; &quot;Magic Lemminkainen.&quot;
The latter is one of the seven sons of Ilmatar, the virgin &quot;daughter
of the air,&quot; she &quot;who fell from heaven into the sea,&quot;
before Creation, <EM>i.e</EM>., Spirit transformed into the matter
of sensuous life. There is a world of meaning and Occult thought
in these few lines, admirably rendered by Dr. J. M. Crawford,
of Cincinnati. The hero Lemminkainen, the good magician,

** It has been repeatedly stated that the Serpent is the symbol
of wisdom and of Occult knowledge. &quot;The Serpent has been
connected with the god of wisdom from the earliest times of which
we have any historical notice,&quot; writes Staniland Wake. &quot;This
animal was the especial symbol of Thot or Taut . . . and of all
those <EM>gods, </EM>such as Hermes (?) and Seth who can be connected
with him. This is also the primitive Chaldean triad Hea or Hoa.&quot;
According to Sir Henry Rawlinson, the most important titles of
this deity refer to &quot;his functions as the source of all knowledge
and science.&quot; Not only is he &quot;the intelligent fish,&quot;
but his name may be read as signifying both &quot;life&quot; and
a serpent (an initiated adept), and he may be considered as &quot;figured
by the great serpent which occupies so conspicuous a place among
the symbols of the gods on the black stones recording Babylonian
benefactions.&quot; Esculapius, Serapis, Pluto, Knoum and Kneph,
are all deities with the attributes of the serpent. Says Dupuis,
&quot;They are all<EM> healers, </EM>givers of health, spiritual
and physical, and of <EM>enlightenment.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>The
crown formed of an asp, the <EM>Thermuthis, </EM>belongs to Isis,
goddess of Life and Healing. The Upanishads have a treatise on
the <EM>Science of Serpents</EM> -- in other words, the Science
of Occult knowledge; and the <EM>Nagas </EM>of the exoteric Buddhist
are not &quot;the fabulous <EM>creatures </EM>of the nature of
serpents . . . beings superior to men and the protectors of the

seven figures of clay -- earth and water -- made in the shape
of those <EM>Tien-hoang,</EM>a third allegory; (compare the &quot;<EM>Symbols
of the Bonzes</EM>&quot;)<EM>. </EM>The twelve <STRONG>AE</STRONG>SERS
of the Scandinavian Eddas do the same. In the Secret Catechism
of the Druses of Syria -- a legend which is repeated word for
word by the oldest tribes about and around the Euphrates -- men
were created by the &quot;Sons of God&quot; descending on Earth,
where, after culling seven <EM>Mandragoras, </EM>they animated
these roots, which became forthwith men.*
<P>
All these allegories point to one and the same origin -- to the
dual and the triple nature of man; dual, as male and female; triple
-- as being of spiritual and psychic essence <EM>within, </EM>and
of a material fabric without.

in fable and play from the most archaic ages. From Rachel and

These roots, without any stalk, and with large leaves growing
out of the head of the root, like a gigantic crop of hair, present
little similitude to man when found in Spain, Italy, Asia Minor,
or Syria. But on the Isle of Candia, and in Karamania near the
city of Adan, they have a wonderfully human form; being very highly
prized as amulets. They are also worn by women as a charm against
sterility, and for other purposes. They are especially effective
in <EM>Black Magic.</EM><HR>

light and heat from the Sun than Earth, or even the beautiful
Venus, which receives but twice that amount more than our insignificant
Globe.&quot; Whether the fact was known in antiquity may be inferred
from the prayer of the &quot;Earth Spirit&quot; to the Sun as
given in the text.* The Sun however, refuses to people the globe,
as it is not ready to receive life as yet.
<P>
Mercury is, as an astrological planet, still more occult and mysterious
than Venus. It is identical with the Mazdean Mithra, the genius,
or god, &quot;established between the Sun and the Moon, the perpetual
companion of 'Sun' of Wisdom.&quot; Pausanias shows him as having
an altar in common with Jupiter (Book V). He had wings to express
his attendance upon the Sun in its course; and he was called the
<EM>Nuntis, </EM>or Sun-wolf, &quot;<EM>solaris luminis particeps.</EM>&quot;
He was the leader of and the evocator of Souls, the &quot;great
Magician&quot; and the Hierophant. Virgil depicts him as taking
&quot;his wand to evoke from Orcus the souls plunged therein&quot;
-- <EM>tum virgam capit, hac animas ille evocat Orco. </EM>(See
also the 21st Fargard of the <EM>Vendidad </EM>on the celestial
militia.) He is the golden-coloured Mercury, the [[<EM>chrusophaes</EM>
<EM>Hermes</EM>]] whom the Hierophants forbade to name. He is
symbolised in Grecian mythology by one of the <EM>dogs </EM>(vigilance),
which watch over the celestial flock (occult wisdom), or Hermes
Anubis, or again Agathodaemon. He is the Argus watching over the
Earth, and which the latter mistakes for the Sun itself. It is
through the intercession of Mercury that the Emperor Julian prayed
to the Occult Sun every night; for, as says Vossius: &quot;All
the theologians agree to say that <EM>Mercury and the Sun are
one</EM>. . . . He was the most eloquent and the most wise of
all the gods, which is not to be wondered at, since <EM>Mercury
is in such close proximity to the Wisdom and the Word of God </EM>(the
Sun) that he was confused with both.&quot; (<EM>Idolatry,</EM>
Vol. II., p. 373.) Vossius utters here a greater occult truth
than he suspected. The <EM>Hermes-Sarameyas </EM>of the Greeks
is closely related to the Hindu <EM>Saram and Sarameya, the </EM>divine
watchman, &quot;who watches over the golden flock of stars and
solar rays.&quot;

* Copernicus wrote his theories on the &quot;Revolution of the
Heavenly Bodies&quot; in the <STRONG>XVI</STRONG>th century, and
the Zohar, even if compiled by Moses de Leon in the <STRONG>XIII</STRONG>th
century, states that: &quot;In the book of Hammannunah, the Old,
we learn . . . that the earth turns upon itself in the form of
a circle; that some are on top, the others below, . . . . that
there are some countries which are lightened, whilst others are
in darkness; these have the day, when for the former it is night;
and there are countries in which it is constantly day, or in which
at least the night continues only some instants.&quot; (<EM>Zohar

<EM>gets all its vital forces, life, and powers through the medium
of the seven planetary Dhyanis from the Spirit of the Sun. They
are his messengers of Light and Life.</EM>&quot;
<P>
&quot;<EM>Like each of the seven regions of the Earth, each of
the seven* Firstborn </EM>(the primordial human groups) <EM>receives
its light and life from its own especial Dhyani -- spiritually,
and from the palace </EM>(house, the planet)<EM> of that Dhyani
physically; so with the seven great Races to be born on it. The
first is born under the Sun; the second under Brihaspati </EM>(Jupiter);
<EM>the third under Lohitanga </EM>(the &quot;fiery-bodied,&quot;
Venus, or Sukra); <EM>the fourth, under Soma </EM>(the Moon, our
Globe also, the Fourth Sphere being born under and from the Moon)
<EM>and Sani, Saturn** the Krura-lochana </EM>(evil-eyed) <EM>and
the Asita </EM>(the dark); <EM>the fifth, under Budha </EM>(Mercury).&quot;
<P>
&quot;<EM>So also with man and every </EM>'<EM>man</EM>'<EM> in
man </EM>(every principle).<EM> Each gets its specific quality
from its primary </EM>(the planetary spirit), <EM>therefore every
man is a septenate </EM>(or a combination of principles, each
having its origin in a quality of that special Dhyani). <EM>Every
active power or force of the earth comes to her from one of the
seven Lords. Light comes through Sukra </EM>(Venus)<EM>, who receives
a triple supply, and gives one-third of it to the Earth. Therefore
the two are called</EM> '<EM>Twin-sisters,</EM>'<EM> but the Spirit
of the Earth is subservient to the </EM>'<EM>Lord</EM>'<EM> of
Sukra. Our wise men represent the two Globes, one over, the other
under the double Sign </EM>(the primeval Svastica bereft of its
four arms, or the cross <IMG SRC="sd1-5b.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">).&quot;***
<P>
The &quot;double sign&quot; is, as every student of Occultism
knows, the symbol of the male and the female principles in Nature,

light and heat as the earth. Thus the planet, precursor of the
dawn and the twilight, the most radiant of all the planets, said
to give the earth one-third of the supply she receives, has two
parts left for herself. This has an occult as well as an astronomical
meaning.
<P>
** &quot;As it is above so it is below&quot; is the fundamental
axiom of occult philosophy. As the logos is seven-fold, <EM>i.e</EM>.,
throughout Kosmos it appears as seven logoi under seven different
forms, or, as taught by learned Brahmins, &quot;each of these
is the central figure of one of the seven main branches of the
ancient wisdom religion;&quot; and, as the seven principles which
correspond to the seven distinct states of <EM>Pragna</EM>, or
consciousness, are allied to seven states of matter and the seven
forms of force, the division must be the same in all that concerns
the earth.

under a Cross</EM>. The esoteric meaning of this is: &quot;Earth
fallen into generation, or into the production of its species
through sexual union.&quot; But the later Western nations did
not fail to give quite a different interpretation. They explained
this sign through their mystics -- guided by the light of the
Latin Church -- as meaning that our Earth and all on it were redeemed<EM>
by the Cross, </EM>while Venus (otherwise <EM>Lucifer </EM>or
Satan) was trampling upon it. Venus is the most occult, powerful,
and mysterious of all the planets; the one whose influence upon,
and relation to the Earth is most prominent. In exoteric Brahmanism,
Venus or <EM>Sukra -- </EM>a male deity* -- is the son of Bhrigu,
one of the Prajapati and a Vedic sage, and is Daitya-Guru, or
the priest-instructor of the primeval giants. The whole history
of &quot;Sukra&quot; in the Puranas, refers to the Third and to
the Fourth Races.
<P>
&quot;<EM>It is through Sukra that the </EM>'<EM>double ones</EM>'<EM>
</EM>(<EM>the Hermaphrodites</EM>)<EM> of the Third </EM>(Root-Race)<EM>
descended from the first </EM>'<EM>Sweat-born,</EM>'&quot;<EM>
says the Commentary. Therefore it is represented under the symbol
of <IMG SRC="sd1-4c.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (the circle and diameter)
during the Third </EM>(<EM>Race</EM>)<EM> and of</EM> <IMG SRC="sd1-5c.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<EM>during the Fourth.</EM> 
<P>
This needs explanation. The <EM>diameter, </EM>when found isolated
in a circle, stands for female nature, for the first <EM>ideal
</EM>World,<EM> self-generated and self-impregnated </EM>by the
universally diffused Spirit of Life -- referring thus to the primitive
Root-Race also. It becomes androgynous as the Races and all on
Earth develop into their physical forms, and the symbol is transformed
into a circle with a diameter from which runs a vertical line:
expressive of male and female, not separated as yet -- the first
and earliest Egyptian <EM>Tau</EM> <IMG SRC="sd1-5e.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">;
after which it becomes <IMG SRC="sd1-5b.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> or
male-female separated** (See first pp. of Book I) and fallen into
generation. Venus (the planet) is symbolised by the sign of a
globe over the cross, which shows it as presiding over the natural
generation of man. The Egyptians symbolised <EM>Ank</EM>, &quot;life,&quot;
by the ansated cross, or <IMG SRC="sd1-5g.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,
which is only another form of Venus (Isis) <IMG SRC="sd1-5h.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,
and meant, esoterically, that mankind and all animal life bad
stepped out of the divine spiritual circle and fallen into physical
male and female generation. This sign, from the end of the Third
Race, has the same phallic significance as the &quot;<EM>tree</EM>

goddess of life; and <EM>Ank </EM>was taken by the Hebrews from
the Egyptians and introduced by Moses, one learned in the Wisdom
of the priests of Egypt, with many other mystical words. The word
<EM>Ank </EM>in Hebrew, with the personal suffix, means &quot;my

from the name of the Egyptian goddess <EM>Anouki.*</EM>

In one of the most ancient Catechisms of Southern India, Madras

the &quot;male and female sign,&quot; right in the central part,
to denote the pre-sexual state of the Third Race. Vishnu, who
is now represented with a lotus growing out of his navel -- or
the Universe of Brahma evolving out of the central point <EM>Nara
-- </EM>is shown in one of the oldest carvings as double-sexed
(Vishnu and Lakshmi) standing on a lotus-leaf floating on the
water; which water rises in a semicircle and pours through the
Svastica, &quot;the source of generation&quot; or of the descent
of man.

Pythagoras calls Sukra-Venus the <EM>Sol alter, </EM>&quot;the
other Sun.&quot; Of the &quot;seven palaces of the Sun,&quot;
that of Lucifer Venus is the <EM>third </EM>one in Christian and
Jewish Kabala, the Zohar making of it the abode of <EM>Samael.
</EM>According to the Occult Doctrine, this planet is our Earth's
<EM>primary, </EM>and its spiritual prototype. Hence, Sukra's
car (Venus-Lucifer's) is said to be drawn by an <EM>ogdoad of
</EM>&quot;<EM>earth-born horses,</EM>&quot; while the steeds
of the chariots of the other planets are different.
<P>
&quot;<EM>Every sin committed on Earth is felt by Usanas-Sukra.
The Guru of the Daityas is the Guardian Spirit of the Earth and
Men. Every change on Sukra is felt on, and reflected by, the Earth.</EM>&quot;
<P>
Sukra, or Venus, is thus represented as the preceptor of the Daityas,
the giants of the Fourth Race, who, in the Hindu allegory, obtained
at one time the sovereignty of all the Earth, and defeated the
minor gods. The <EM>Titans </EM>of the Western allegory are as
closely connected with Venus-Lucifer, identified by later Christians
with Satan. Therefore, as Venus, equally with Isis, was represented
with Cow's horns on her head, the symbol of mystic Nature, and
one that is convertible with, and significant of, the moon, since
all these were lunar goddesses, the configuration of this planet
is now placed by theologians between the horns of the mystic Lucifer.**
It is owing to the fanciful interpretation of the

archaic tradition, which states that Venus changes simultaneously
(geologically) with the Earth; that whatever takes place on the
one takes place on the other; and that many and great were their
common changes -- it is for these reasons that St. Augustine repeats
it, applying the several changes of configuration, colour, and
even of the orbital paths, to that theologically-woven character
of Venus-Lucifer. He even goes so far in his pious fancy as to
connect the last changes of the planet with the Noachian and mythical
Deluge alleged to have taken place 1796 years B.C. (See &quot;<EM>City
of God</EM>&quot; lxxi., ch. viii.).
<P>
As Venus has no satellites, it is stated allegorically, that &quot;Asphujit&quot;
(this &quot;planet&quot;) adopted the Earth, the progeny of the
Moon, &quot;who overgrew its parent and gave much trouble,&quot;
a reference to the occult connection between the two. The Regent
(of the planet) Sukra* loved his adopted child so well that he
incarnated as Usanas and gave it perfect laws, which were disregarded
and rejected in later ages. Another allegory, in Harivansa, is
that Sukra went to Siva asking him to protect his pupils, the
Daityas and Asuras, from the fighting gods; and that to further
his object he performed a Yoga rite &quot;imbibing the <EM>smoke
</EM>of chaff with his <EM>head downwards</EM> for 1,000 years.&quot;
This refers to the great inclination of the axis of Venus (amounting
to 50 degrees), and to its being enveloped in eternal clouds.
But it relates only to the physical constitution of the planet.

[[Footnote continued from previous page]] have chosen the Crescent
for their national arms. Venus has always been identified, since
the establishment of Roman Catholic dogmatism, with Satan and
Lucifer, or the great Dragon, contrary to all reason and logic.
As shown by the symbologists and astronomers, the association
between the serpent and the idea of darkness had an astronomical
foundation. The position which the constellation of Draco at one
time occupied showed that the great serpent was the ruler of the
night. This constellation was formerly at the very centre of the
heavens, and is so extensive that it was called the Great Dragon.
Its body spreads over seven signs of the Zodiac; and Dupuis, &quot;who,&quot;
says Staniland Wake, &quot;sees in the Dragon of the Apocalypse
a reference to the celestial serpent,&quot; remarks that &quot;it
is not astonishing that a constellation so extended should be
represented by the author of that book as a Great Dragon with
seven heads, who drew the third part of the stars from heaven
and cast them to Earth&quot;; (Dupuis, tome <STRONG>III</STRONG>.,
p. 255). Only Dupuis never knew <EM>why </EM>Draco, once the <EM>pole-star
</EM>-- the symbol of &quot;Guide,&quot; Guru and director --
had been thus degraded by posterity. &quot;The gods of our fathers
are our devils,&quot; says an Asiatic proverb. When Draco ceased
to be the <EM>lode-star, </EM>the guiding sidereal divinity, it
shared the fate of all the fallen gods. Seth and Typhon was at
one time, Bunsen tells us, &quot;a great god universally adored
throughout Egypt, who conferred on the sovereigns of the 18th
and 19th Dynasties the symbols of life and power. But subsequently,
in the course of the 20th Dynasty, he is suddenly treated as an
evil Demon, insomuch that his effigies and name are obliterated
on all the monuments and inscriptions that could be reached.&quot;
The real occult reason will be given in these pages.

that Occult mysticism has to deal. The allegory which states that
for killing Sukra's mother, Vishnu was cursed by him to be <EM>reborn
seven times </EM>on the Earth, is full of occult philosophical
meaning. It does not refer to Vishnu's Avatars, since these number
nine, the tenth being still to come, but to the Races on Earth.
Venus, or Lucifer (also Sukra and Usanas) the planet, is the light-bearer
of our Earth, in both its physical and mystic sense. The Christians
knew it well in early times, since one of the earliest popes of
Rome is known by his Pontiff name as Lucifer.

&quot;Seven seems to have been the sacred number <EM>par excellence
</EM>among all civilised nations of antiquity. Why? Each separate
people has given a different explanation, according to the peculiar
tenets of their (<EM>exoteric</EM>)<EM> </EM>religion. That it
was the <EM>number of numbers for those initiated into the sacred
mysteries, there can be no doubt. </EM>Pythagoras . . . calls
it the 'Vehicle of Life' containing body and soul, since it is
formed of a Quaternary, that is Wisdom and intellect, and of a
<EM>Trinity</EM> or <EM>action and matter. </EM>The Emperor Julian,
'<EM>In matrem, etc.,' </EM>expresses himself thus: 'Were I to
touch upon the initiation into our Sacred Mysteries, which the
Chaldees Bacchized, respecting the <EM>seven-rayed </EM>god, lighting
up the soul through him, I should say things unknown to the rabble,
very unknown, but well known to the blessed Theurgists.' &quot;
(p. 141).
<P>
And who, acquainted with the Puranas, the Book of the Dead, the
Zendavesta, the Assyrian tiles, and finally the Bible, and who
has observed the constant occurrence of the number seven, in these
records of people living from the remotest times unconnected and
so far apart, can regard as a coincidence the following fact,
given by the same explorer of ancient Mysteries? Speaking of the
prevalence of seven as a mystic number, among the inhabitants
of the &quot;Western continent&quot; (of America), he adds that
it is not less remarkable. For: --
<P>
&quot;It frequently occurs in the <EM>Popul-vuh </EM>. . . we
find it besides in the <EM>seven families </EM>said by Sahagun
and Clavigero to have accompanied the mystical personage named
<EM>Votan, </EM>the reputed founder of the great city of Nachan,
identified by some with Palenque. In the <EM>seven caves* </EM>from
which the ancestors of the Nahuatl are reported to have emerged.
In the <EM>seven cities </EM>of Cibola, described by Coronado
and Niza. . . . In the <EM>seven Antilles; </EM>in the <EM>seven
heroes </EM>who, we are told, escaped the Deluge . . . .&quot;
<P>
&quot;Heroes,&quot; moreover, whose number is found the same in
every &quot;Deluge&quot; story -- from the seven Rishis who were
saved with Vaivasvata Manu, down to Noah's ark, into which beasts,
fowls, and living creatures were taken by &quot;Sevens.&quot;
Thus we see the figures 1, 3, 5, 7, as perfect, because thoroughly
mystic, numbers playing a prominent part in every Cosmogony and
evolution of living Beings. In China, 1, <EM>3, 5, 7,</EM> are
called &quot;celestial numbers&quot; in the canonical &quot;<EM>Book
of Changes.</EM>&quot; (<EM>Yi King</EM>, or <EM>transformation,

<P>
Jezirah, the Greek and Latin hymns, in the Book of Hermes, in
the Chaldean Book of Numbers, in the esotericism of Lao-tse, everywhere.
In the Kabala, which explains the secret meaning of Genesis, this
light is the DUAL-MAN, or the Androgyne (rather the sexless) angels,
whose generic name is <STRONG>A</STRONG>DAM <STRONG>K</STRONG>ADMON.
It is they who complete man, whose ethereal form is emanated by
other divine, but far lower beings, who solidify the body with
clay, or the &quot;dust of the ground&quot; -- an allegory indeed,
but as scientific as any Darwinian evolution and more <EM>true</EM>.
<P>
The author of the &quot;<EM>Source of Measures</EM>&quot; says
that the foundation of the Kabala and all its mystic books is
made to rest upon the <EM>ten Sephiroth; </EM>which is a fundamental
truth.* He shows these ten Sephiroth or the ten numbers in the
following diagram: --
<P>
<IMG SRC="sd2-37.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
wherein the circle is the <EM>naught, </EM>its vertical diameter
line is the first or primal ONE (the <EM>Word</EM> or<EM> Logos</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>from which springs the series of the other numbers up to
9, the limit of the digits. The 10 is the first Divine Manifestation**
containing &quot;every possible power of exact expression of proportion.&quot;
By this Kabalistic speculation we are taught that the Sephiroth
&quot;were the numbers or emanations of the Heavenly Light (figures
20612 to 6561), they were the 10 'Words,' DBRIM, 41224, the light,
of which they were the flux, was the Heavenly Man, the Adam KDM
(the 144- 144); and the Light, by the New Testament or Covenant
(or 41224) created God; just as, by the Old Testament God (Alhim,
31415) creates light (20612 to 6561).&quot;
<P>
Now there are three kinds of light in Occultism, as in the Kabala.
(1) The Abstract and Absolute Light, which is Darkness; (2) The
Light of the Manifested-Unmanifested, called by some the Logos;
and (3) The latter light reflected in the Dhyan Chohans, the minor
<EM>logoi </EM>(the Elohim, collectively), who, in their turn,
shed it on the objective Universe. But in the Kabala -- re-edited
and carefully adjusted to fit the Christian tenets by the Kabalists
of the <STRONG>XIII</STRONG>. century -- the three lights are
described as: -- (1) The clear and penetrating, that of Jehovah;
(2) reflected light; and (3) light in the <EM>abstract.</EM>&quot;
This light abstractly taken (in a metaphysical or symbolical sense)
is Alhim (Elohim God),

in Ancient Names,</EM>&quot; vol. ii., p. 648. There, an engraving
of &quot;the <EM>vesica piscis, </EM>Mary and the female emblem,
copied from a rosary of the blessed Virgin . . . . printed at
Venice, 1542,&quot; and therefore, as Inman remarks, &quot;with
a license from the Inquisition, consequently orthodox,&quot; will
show the reader what the Latin Church understood by this &quot;<EM>penetrating
power of light and its effects </EM>&quot; How sadly disfigured
-- applied as they were to the grossest anthropomorphic conceptions
-- have become, under Christian interpretation, the noblest and
grandest, as the most exalted, ideas of deity of the Eastern philosophy!
<P>
The Occultists call this light <EM>Daiviprakriti </EM>in the East,
and light of <EM>Christos </EM>in the West. It is the light of
the LOGOS, the direct reflection of the ever Unknowable on the
plane of Universal manifestation. But here is the interpretation
thereof given by the modern Christians from the Kabala. As declared
by the author just cited: --
<P>
&quot;To the fulness of the world in general with its chiefest
content, man, the term Elohim-Jehovah applies. In extracts from
the <EM>Zohar, </EM>the Rev. Dr. Cassell (a Kabalist), to prove
that the Cabbalah sets forth the doctrine of the Trinity, among
other things says: 'Jehovah is Elohim (Alhim) . . . by three steps
God (Alhim), and Jehovah become the same, and though separated
each and together, they are of the same one.'&quot; Similarly,
Vishnu becomes the Sun, the visible symbol of the impersonal deity.
Vishnu is described as &quot;striding through the seven regions
of the Universe in <EM>three steps.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>But with
the Hindus this is an <EM>exoteric </EM>account, a surface tenet
and an allegory, while the Kabalists give it out as the esoteric
and final meaning. But to proceed: --
<P>
&quot;Now light,&quot; explains the author, &quot;as shown, is
20612 to 6561, as the proper enunciation of the integral and numerical
relation of diameter to circumference of a circle. God (Alhim,<EM>
i.e</EM>., 3.1415 to one, a modified form of the above) is the
reduction of this, so as to obtain a standard unit<EM>one,</EM>as
the basis, in general, of all calculation and all mensuration.
But, for the production of animal life, and for especial <EM>time
measure </EM>or the lunar year, that influence which causes conception
and embryotic development, the numbers of the Jehovah measure
('<EM>man even Jehovah</EM>' measure), viz. 113 to 355, have to
be specialised.* But this last ratio is but a modified form of
light or 20612 to 6561, as a '[[<EM>pi</EM>]]' <EM>value, </EM>being
only a variation of the same (that is 20612 to 6561 is 31415 to
one, or Alhim or God) -- and in such a manner that one can be
made

to flow into and be derived from the other, and these are the
three steps by which the <EM>Unity </EM>and sameness can be shown
of the divine names. That is, the two are but variations of the
same ratio, viz., that of '[[pi]].' The object of this comment
is to show the same measuring use for the Cabbalah as was employed
in the three Covenants of the Bible, and in the symbols of Masonry,
as just noticed.&quot;
<P>
&quot;First then, the Sephiroth are described as <EM>Light, </EM>that
is, they themselves are a function of, indeed, the same as, the
manifestation of Ain Soph; and they are so from the fact that
<EM>Light </EM>represents the ratio of 20612 to 6561, as part
of the 'Words,' DBRIM, 41224, or as to the Word, Debar, 206 (=
10 cubits). <EM>Light </EM>is so much the burden of the Kabbalah,
in explaining the Sephiroth, that the most famous book on the
Kabbalah is called <EM>Zohar</EM> or <EM>Light. </EM>In this we
find expressions of this kind: -- 'The Infinite was entirely unknown
and diffused no light before the luminous point violently broke
through into vision . . . .' 'When he first assumed the form (of
the Crown, or the first Sephira), he caused 9 splendid lights
to emanate from it, which, shining through it, diffused a bright
light in all directions': that is, these 9 with his one (which
was the origin, as above, of the nine), together made the 10,
that is <IMG SRC="sd1-5f.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> or <IMG SRC="sd2-39.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,
or <EM>the sacred Ten</EM> (<EM>numbers or Sephiroth</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>or<EM> Jod -</EM>- and these numbers were '<EM>the Light.</EM>'
Just as in the Gospel of St. John, God (Alhim, 31415 to one) was
that light (20612 to 6561) by which (Light) all things were made.&quot;
<P>
In <EM>Sepher Jezirah, </EM>or Numbers of Creation, the whole
process of evolution is given out in Numbers. In its &quot;32
paths of Wisdom&quot; the number 3 is repeated four times, and
the number 4 five times. Therefore, the Wisdom of God is contained
in numbers (Sephrim or Sephiroth), for Sepher (or S-ph-ra when
unvowelled) means &quot;to cipher.&quot; And therefore, also,
we find Plato stating that the deity <EM>geometrizes </EM>in fabricating
the Universe.
<P>
The Kabalistic book, the Sepher Jezirah, opens with a statement
of the hidden wisdom of <EM>Alhi </EM>in<EM> Sephrim, i.e , </EM>the
Elohim in the Sephiroth.
<P>
&quot;In thirty and two paths, hidden wisdom, established Jah,
JHVH, Tzabaoth, Elohi of Israel, Alhim of Life, El of Grace and
Mercy -- exalted, uplifted Dweller on high, and King of Everlasting,
and his name -- Holy! in three Sephrim: viz: -- B-S'ph-r, V-S'ph-r,
V-Siph-o-r.&quot;
<P>
&quot;This Comment sets forth 'the <EM>Hidden Wisdom</EM>' of
the original text by hidden Wisdom, that is, by the use of words
carrying a special set of Numbers and a special phraseology, which
will set forth the very explanatory system which we find to fit
so accurately in the Hebrew Bible. . . . . In setting forth his
scheme, to enforce it, and to finish out his detailed exposition

<P>
<EM>Sephrim </EM>(<EM>Sephiroth</EM>) of the Number Jezirah, the
author explains the separation of this word in the three subordinate
ones, a play upon a common word <EM>s-ph-r, </EM>or number.&quot;
<P>
The prince Al-Chazari says to the Rabbi*: -- &quot;I wish now
that thou wouldest impart to me some of the chiefest or leading
principles of Natural Philosophy, which as thou sayest were in
former times worked out by them (the Ancient Wise Ones)&quot;;
to which the Rabbi makes answer: -- &quot;To such principles appertains
the Number of Creation of our Race-father Abraham&quot; (that
is Abram and Abraham, or numbers 41224 and 41252). He then says
that this book of Number treats of teaching the <EM>Alhim-ness
</EM>and<EM> One-ness </EM>through, &quot;DBRIM,&quot; viz., the
numbers of the Word &quot;<EM>Words.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>That
is, it teaches the use of the ratio 31415 to one, through 41224,
which last, in the description of the Ark of the Covenant, was
divided into two parts by two tables of stone, on which these,
DBRIM or 41224, were written or engraved -- or 20612 by 2. He
then comments on these three subordinately used words, and takes
care as to one of them to make the comment: -- &quot;And <EM>Alhim
</EM>(31415 to 1) said: Let there be Light (20612 to 6561).&quot;
<P>
The three words as given in the text are: <IMG SRC="sd2-40a.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">.
And the Rabbi in commenting upon them says: &quot;It teaches the
<EM>Alhim-ness </EM>(31415)<EM> </EM>and One-ness (the diameter
to Alhim) through Words (<STRONG>DBRIM,</STRONG> 41224), by which
on the one side there is infinite expression in heterogeneous
creations, and on the other a final harmonic tendency to <EM>One-ness</EM>&quot;
(which as everyone knows is the mathematical function of &quot;[[<EM>pi</EM>]]&quot;
of the schools, which measures, and weighs and numbers the stars
of heaven, and yet resolves them back into the final Oneness of
the Universe through Words). &quot;Their final accord perfects
itself in that Oneness that ordains them and which consists in
<IMG SRC="sd2-40b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (Book of Al-Chazari), that
is the Rabbi, in his first comment, leaves the jod, or <EM>i</EM>,
out of one of the words, whereas afterwards he restores it again.
If we take the values of those subordinate words, we find them
to be 340, 340, 346; together these are 1026, and the division
of the general word into these has been to produce these numbers,
which by Temurah may be changed in various ways for various purposes.&quot;
(Kabala.)
<P>
The reader is asked to turn to Stanza <STRONG>IV</STRONG>. of
Book I. and its fourth commentary to find that the 3, 4 -- (7),
and the thrice seven, or 1065, the number of Jehovah, is the number
of the 21 Prajapati mentioned in the Mahabharata, or the three
<EM>Sephrim </EM>(words in cipher or figures). And this comparison
between the Creative Powers of Archaic philosophy and the anthropomorphic
Creator of <EM>exoteric </EM>Judaism (since their esotericism
shows its identity with the Secret Doctrine) will lead the student
to perceive and discover that, in truth, Jehovah is but a <EM>lunar

<P>
&quot;generation&quot; god. (See Book I, Part 2<EM>, </EM>&quot;<EM>Deus
Lunus.</EM>&quot;) It is a fact well known to every conscientious
student of the Kabala, that the deeper he dives into it, the more
he feels convinced that unless the Kabala -- or what is left of
it -- is read by the light of the Eastern esoteric philosophy,
its study leads only to the discovery that, on the lines traced
by exoteric Judaism and Christianity, the monotheism of both is
nothing more exalted than ancient Astrolatry, now vindicated by
modern Astronomy. The Kabalists never cease to repeat that <EM>primal
intelligence </EM>can never be understood. It cannot be comprehended,
nor can it be located, therefore it has to remain nameless and
negative. Hence the Ain-Soph -- the &quot;UNKNOWABLE&quot; and
the &quot;UNNAMEABLE&quot; -- which, as <EM>it</EM> could not
be made manifest, was conceived to emanate manifesting Powers.
It is then with its <EM>emanations alone that human intellect
has to, and can deal. </EM>Christian theology, having rejected
the doctrine of emanations and replaced them with direct, conscious
creations of angels and the rest out of <EM>nothing, </EM>now
finds itself hopelessly stranded between Supernaturalism, or miracle,
and materialism. An <EM>extra</EM>-cosmic god is fatal to philosophy,
an <EM>intra</EM>-cosmic Deity -- <EM>i.e.</EM> Spirit and matter
inseparable from each other -- is a philosophical necessity. Separate
them and that which is left is a gross superstition under a mask
of emotionalism. But why &quot;geometrize,&quot; as Plato has
it, why represent these emanations under the form of an immense
arithmetical table? The question is well answered by the author
just cited. His remarks are quoted in Part II., &#167; &quot;<EM>The
Theogony of the Creative Gods.</EM>&quot;
<P>
&quot;Mental perception,&quot; he says, &quot;to become physical
perception, must have the Cosmic principle of <EM>light</EM>:
and by this, our mental circle must become visible through light;
or, for its complete manifestation, the Circle must be that of
physical visibility, or Light itself. Such conceptions, thus formulated,
became the groundwork of the philosophy of the divine manifesting
in the Universe.&quot;
<P>
This is philosophy. It is otherwise when we find the Rabbi in
<EM>Al-Chazari </EM>saying that &quot;under s'ph-r is to be understood
<EM>calculation </EM>and <EM>weighing </EM>of created bodies.
For the <EM>calculation, </EM>by means of which a body must be
constructed in harmony or symmetry, by which it must be in construction
rightly arranged and made to correspond to the object in design,
consists at last in <EM>number, extension, mass, weight; </EM>co-ordinate
relation of movements, then harmony of music, must consist altogether
by number, that is (S'ph-r). . . By Sippor (s'phor) is to be understood
the words of Alhim whereunto joins or adapts itself the design
of the frame or form of construction; for example, it was said
'Let Light be.' The <EM>work became as the </EM>WORDS <EM>were
spoken, </EM>that is, as the numbers of the work came forth. .
. . .&quot;
<P>
This is <EM>materialising the Spiritual </EM>without scruple.
But the Kabala<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 42 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
was not always so well adapted to anthropo-monotheistic conceptions.
Compare this with any of the six schools of India. For instance,
in Kapila's &quot;Sankhya&quot; Philosophy, unless, allegorically
speaking, Purusha mounts on the shoulders of Prakriti, the latter
remains irrational, while the former remains inactive without
her. Therefore Nature (in man) must become a compound of Spirit
and Matter before he becomes what he is; and the Spirit latent
in Matter must be awakened to life and consciousness gradually.
The Monad has to pass through its mineral, vegetable and animal
forms, before the Light of the Logos is awakened in the animal
man. Therefore, till then, the latter cannot be referred to as
&quot;MAN,&quot; but has to be regarded as a Monad imprisoned
in ever changing forms. <EM>Evolution, </EM>not<EM> creation,
</EM>by means of WORDS is recognized in the philosophies of the
East, even in their exoteric records. <EM>Ex oriente lux</EM>.
Even the name of the first man in the Mosaic Bible had its origin
in India, Professor Max Muller's negation notwithstanding. The
Jews got their Adam from Chaldea; and Adam-Adami is a compound
word and therefore a manifold symbol, and proves the occult dogmas.
<P>
This is no place for philological disquisitions. But the reader
may be reminded that the words <EM>Ad</EM> and<EM> Adi</EM> mean
in Sanskrit &quot;the first&quot;; in Aramaean, &quot;One&quot;
(<EM>Ad-ad, </EM>&quot;the only one&quot;); in Assyrian, &quot;father&quot;
whence <EM>Ak-Ad </EM>or &quot;father-creator.&quot;* And once
the statement is found correct it becomes rather difficult to
confine Adam to the Mosaic Bible alone, and to see therein simply
a Jewish name. <EM>Vide</EM> Part II. of this Volume, &#167; &quot;Adam-Adami.&quot;
<P>
There is frequent confusion in the attributes and genealogies
of the gods in their theogonies, as given to the world by the
half-initiated writers, Brahmanical and Biblical, the Alpha and
the Omega of the records of that symbolical science. Yet there
could be no such confusion made by the earliest nations, the descendants
and pupils of the divine instructors: for both the attributes
and the genealogies were inseparably linked with cosmogonical
symbols, the &quot;gods&quot; being the life and animating &quot;soul-principle&quot;
of the various regions of the Universe. Nowhere and by no people
was speculation allowed to range <EM>beyond </EM>those<EM> manifested
</EM>gods. The boundless and infinite UNITY remained with every
nation a virgin forbidden soil, untrodden by man's thought,
<P>
[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
<P>
* The appellation <EM>Ak-ad</EM> (or Akkadians) is of the same
class as <EM>Ad-m, Ha-va </EM>(Eve), <EM>AEd-en</EM> (Eden); Ak-Ad
meaning &quot;Son of <EM>Ad</EM>&quot; (like the sons of Ad in
Ancient Arabia). <EM>Ad-ad, </EM>the &quot;Only One&quot; and
the First, was the <EM>Ad-on </EM>or &quot;Lord&quot; of Syria
and consort of <EM>Ad-ar-gat </EM>or Aster't, the Syrian goddess.
And Gan-AEden (Eden) or Gandunia was Babylonia and Mesopotamia.
In Assyrian <EM>Ak</EM> meant Creator, the letter K pronounced
Kh (Ah) gutturally. According to Swedenborg's mysticism Adam was
not a man but a church (?) of primitive light. In the Vedas <EM>Ad</EM>-iti
is the primitive light, the Akasa of the phenomenal world.<HR>

untouched by fruitless speculation. The only reference made to
it was the brief conception of its diastolic and systolic property,
of its periodical expansion or dilatation, and contraction. In
the Universe with all its incalculable myriads of systems and
worlds disappearing and re-appearing in eternity, the anthropomorphised
powers, or gods, their Souls, had to disappear from view with
their bodies: -- &quot;The breath returning to the eternal bosom
which exhales and inhales them,&quot; says our Catechism.
<P>
&quot;<EM>Ideal nature,</EM>&quot; the abstract Space in which
everything in the Universe is mysteriously and invisibly generated,
is the same female side of procreative power in Nature in the
Vedic as in every other Cosmogony. Aditi is Sephira, and the Sophia-Achamoth
of the Gnostics, and Isis, the virgin Mother of Horus. In every
Cosmogony, behind and higher than the <EM>creative </EM>deity,
there is a superior deity, a planner, an Architect, <EM>of whom
</EM>the Creator is but the executive agent. And still higher,
<EM>over</EM> and<EM> around, within</EM> and<EM> without, </EM>there
is the UNKNOWABLE and the <EM>unknown, </EM>the Source and Cause
of all these Emanations. . . . .
<P>
It thus becomes easy to account for the reason why &quot;<EM>Adam-Adami</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>is found in the Chaldean scripture, certainly earlier than
the Mosaic Books. In Assyrian <EM>Ad </EM>is the father, and in
Aramaean <EM>Ad </EM>is<EM> </EM>&quot;One,&quot; and <EM>Ad-ad
</EM>the &quot;only one,&quot; while <EM>Ak </EM>is in Assyrian
&quot;creator.&quot; Thus <EM>Ad-am-ak-ad-mon </EM>became Adam
Kadmon in the Kabala (<EM>Zohar</EM>)<EM>, </EM>meaning as it
did, the &quot;One (Son) of the divine Father, or the creator,&quot;
for the words &quot;<EM>am</EM>&quot; and &quot;<EM>om</EM>&quot;
meant at one time in nearly every language the <EM>divine, </EM>or
the <EM>deity. </EM>Thus Adam Kadmon and Adam-Adami came to mean:
-- &quot;The first emanation of the Father-Mother or divine nature,&quot;
and literally &quot;the first divine one.&quot; And it is easy
to see that <EM>Ad</EM>-Argat (or<EM> Aster</EM>'<EM>t, </EM>the
Syrian goddess, the consort of <EM>Ad-on, </EM>the lord god of
Syria or the Jewish Adonai), and Venus, Isis, Ishtar, Mylitta,
Eve, etc., etc., are identical with the <EM>Aditi </EM>and Vach
of the Hindus. They are all the &quot;Mothers of all living&quot;
and &quot;of the gods.&quot; On the other hand -- cosmically and
astronomically -- all the male gods became at first &quot;Sun-gods,&quot;
then, theologically, the &quot;Suns of Righteousness&quot; and
the Logoi, all symbolised by the Sun.* They are all <EM>Protogonoi
</EM>(the first-born) and
<P>
[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
<P>
* Adam-Jehovah, Brahma and Mars are, in one sense, identical;
they are all symbols for primitive or initial <EM>generative powers
</EM>for the purposes of human procreation. Adam is red, and so
also are Brahma-Viraj and Mars -- god and planet. Water is the
blood of the Earth; therefore, all these names are connected with
Earth and Water. &quot;It takes <EM>earth and water </EM>to create
a <EM>human</EM> soul,&quot; says Moses. Mars is identical with
<EM>Kartikeya </EM>God of War (in one sense) -- which god is born
of the Sweat of Siva, <EM>Siva Gharmaja </EM>and the Earth. In
the Mahabharata he is shown as born without the intervention of
a woman. And he is also called &quot;Lohita,&quot; the <EM>red</EM>,
like Adam, and the other &quot;first men.&quot; Hence, the author
of &quot;<EM>The Source of Measures</EM>&quot; is quite right
in thinking that Mars (and all the other gods of like attributes),
&quot;being the <EM>god of war </EM>and of [[Footnote continued

as Athamaz, Tamaz, or the Adonis of the Greeks -- &quot;the One
<EM>with, </EM>and<EM> of </EM>his father&quot; -- the &quot;Father&quot;
becoming during the later Races <EM>Helios, </EM>the Sun, as Apollo
<EM>Karneios,* </EM>for instance, who was the &quot;Sun born&quot;;
Osiris, Ormazd, and so on, were all followed by, and found themselves
transformed later on into still more earthly types: such as Prometheus,
the crucified of Mount Kajbee, Hercules, and so many others, sun-gods
and heroes, until all of them came to have no better significance
than phallic symbols.
<P>
In the <EM>Zohar</EM> is <EM>i</EM>t said &quot;Man was created
by the Sephiroth (Elohim-Javeh, also) and they engendered by common
power the <EM>earthly </EM>Adam.&quot; Therefore in <EM>Genesis
</EM>the Elohim say: -- &quot;Behold Man is become <EM>as one
of us.</EM>&quot; But in Hindu Cosmogony or &quot;Creation,&quot;
Brahma-Prajapati <EM>creates </EM>Viraj and the Rishis, spiritually;
therefore the latter are distinctly called &quot;the Mind-born
Sons of Brahma&quot;; and this specified mode of <EM>engendering
</EM>precluded every idea of <EM>Phallicism, </EM>at any rate
in the earlier human nations. This instance well illustrates the
respective <EM>spirituality </EM>of the two nations.

metaphorically <EM>immortal </EM>through their Wisdom. Such is
the common belief of those who credit every star or planet with
being inhabited. (And there are men of science -- M. Flammarion
among others -- who believe in this fervently, on logical as well
as on astronomical data). The Moon being an inferior body to the
Earth even, to say nothing of other planets, the terrestrial men
produced by her sons -- the lunar men or &quot;ancestors&quot;
-- from her shell or body, cannot be immortal. They cannot hope
to become real, self-conscious and intelligent men, unless they
are <EM>finished, </EM>so to say, by other creators. Thus in the
Puranic legend, the son of the Moon (<EM>Soma</EM>)<EM> </EM>is<EM>
Budha </EM>(Mercury), &quot;the intelligent&quot; and the Wise,
because he is the offspring of Soma, the &quot;regent&quot; of
the visible Moon, not of Indu, the physical Moon. Thus Mercury
is the elder brother of the Earth, metaphorically -- his step-brother,
so to say, the offspring of <EM>Spirit </EM>-- while she (the
Earth) is the progeny of the <EM>body. </EM>These allegories have
a deeper and more scientific meaning (astronomically and geologically)

<P>
n our modern physicists are willing to admit. The whole cycle
of the &quot;first War in Heaven,&quot; the Taraka-maya, is as
full of philosophical as of Cosmogonical and astronomical truths.
One can trace therein the biographies of all the planets by the
history of their gods and rulers. Usanas (Sukra, or Venus), the
bosom-friend of Soma and the foe of Brihaspati (Jupiter) the instructor
of the gods, whose wife Tara (or Taraka) had been carried away
by the Moon, <EM>Soma -- </EM>&quot;of whom he begat Budha&quot;

* Usanas-Sukra or Venus is our &quot;Lucifer,&quot; the morning
star, of course. The ingenuity of this allegory in its manifold
meanings is great indeed. Thus <EM>Brihaspati </EM>(the planet
Jupiter) or Brahmanaspati is, in the Rig Veda, a deity who is
the symbol and the prototype of the <EM>exoteric </EM>or ritualistic
worship. He is priest sacrificer, suppliant, and the medium through
which the prayers of mortals reach the gods. He is the <EM>Purohita
</EM>(family priest, or Court Chaplain) of the Hindu Olympus and
the spiritual <EM>Guru </EM>of the Gods. Soma is the mystery god
and presides over the mystic and occult nature in man and the
Universe. Tara, the priest's wife, who symbolizes the worshipper,
prefers esoteric truths to their mere shell, exotericism; hence
she is shown as carried off by Soma. Now Soma is the sacred juice
of that name, giving mystic visions and trance revelations, the
<EM>result of which union is Budha</EM> (Wisdom), Mercury, Hermes,
etc., etc.; that science in short which to this day is proclaimed
by the Brihaspatis of Theology as devilish and <EM>Satanic. </EM>What
wonder that by expanding the cycle of this allegory we find Christian
theology espousing the quarrel of the Hindu gods, and regarding
<EM>Usanas</EM> (Lucifer), who helped Soma against that ancient
personification of ritualistic worship (Brahmanaspati, the lord
of the Brahmans, now become &quot;Jupiter-Jehovah&quot;) as <STRONG>S</STRONG>ATAN,
the &quot;enemy of God&quot;!<HR>

<P>
does not remove the seeming difficulty, in view of modern hypotheses,
of the teaching, which shows these progenitors or ancestors creating
the first human Adams out of their sides: as astral shadows. And
though it is an improvement on Adam's rib, still geological and
climatic difficulties will be brought forward. Such, however,
is the teaching of Occultism.
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>) Man's organism was adapted in every race to its surroundings.
The first Root-Race was as ethereal as ours is material. The progeny
of the seven Creators, who evolved the seven primordial Adams,*
surely required no purified gases to breathe and live upon (see
Part <STRONG>III</STRONG>. of this Volume). Therefore, however
strongly the impossibility of this teaching may be urged by the
devotees of modern science, the Occultist maintains that the case
was as stated <EM>aeons of years </EM>before even the evolution
of the Lemurian, the first physical man, which itself took place
18,000,000 years ago.**
<P>
Preliminary evolution is described in one of the <STRONG>B</STRONG>OOKS
OF <STRONG>D</STRONG>ZYAN and the Commentaries thereon in this
wise: --
<P>
Archaic Scripture teaches that at the commencement of every local
Kalpa, or Round, the earth is reborn; &quot;as the human <EM>Jiva</EM>
(monad), when passing into a new womb, gets re-covered with a
new body, so does the Jiva of the Earth; it gets a more perfect
and solid covering with each Round after re-emerging once more
from the matrix of space into objectivity&quot; (Comment). This
process is attended, of course, by the throes of the new birth
or geological convulsions.
<P>
Thus the only reference to it is contained in one verse of the
volume of the <EM>Book of Dzyan </EM>before us, where it says:

The Earth is said to cast off her old <EM>three </EM>skins, because
this refers to the three preceding Rounds she has already passed
through; the present being the <EM>fourth </EM>Round out of the
seven. At the beginning of every new <STRONG>R</STRONG>OUND, after
a period of &quot;obscuration,&quot; the earth (as do also the
other six &quot;earths&quot;) casts off, or is supposed to cast
off, her old skins as the Serpent does: therefore she is called
in the <EM>Aitareya-Brahmana </EM>the<EM> Sarpa Rajni, </EM>&quot;the
Queen of the Serpents,&quot; and &quot;the mother of all that
moves.&quot; The &quot;Seven Skins,&quot; in the first of which
she now stands, refer to the seven geological changes which accompany
and correspond to the evolution of the Seven Root-Races of Humanity.

Stanza <STRONG>II</STRONG>., which speaks of this Round, begins
with a few words of information concerning the age of our Earth.
The chronology will be given in its place. In the Commentary appended
to the Stanza, two personages are mentioned: Narada and Asura
Maya, especially the latter. All the calculations are attributed
to this archaic celebrity; and what follows will make the reader
superficially acquainted with some of these figures.

To the mind of the Eastern student of Occultism, two figures are
indissolubly connected with mystic astronomy, chronology, and
their cycles. Two grand and mysterious figures, towering like
two giants in the Archaic Past, emerge before him, whenever he
has to refer to Yugas and Kalpas. When, at what period of pre-history
they lived, none save a few men in the world know, or ever can
know with that certainty which is required by exact chronology.
It may have been 100,000 years ago, it may have been 1,000,000,
for all that the outside world will ever know. The mystic West
and Freemasonry talk loudly of Enoch and Hermes. The mystic East
speaks of <STRONG>N</STRONG>ARADA, the old Vedic Rishi, and of<STRONG>
ASU</STRONG>RAMAYA, the Atlantean.

It has already been hinted that of all the incomprehensible characters

<P>
in the Vishnu Purana, is the most mysterious. He is referred to
by the honourable title of Deva Rishi (divine Rishi, more than
a demi-god) by Parasara, and yet he is cursed by Daksha and even
by Brahma. He informs Kansa that Bhagavat (or Vishnu in exotericism)
would incarnate in the eighth child of Devaki, and thus brings
the wrath of the Indian <EM>Herod </EM>upon Krishna's mother;
and then, from the cloud on which he is seated -- invisible as
a true <EM>Manasaputra -- he </EM>lauds Krishna, in delight at
the Avatar's feat of killing the monster Kesim. Narada is here,
there, and everywhere; and yet, none of the Puranas gives the
true characteristics of this great enemy of physical procreation.
Whatever those characteristics may be in Hindu Esotericism, Narada
-- who is called in Cis-Himalayan Occultism <EM>Pesh-Hun, </EM>the
&quot;Messenger,&quot; or the Greek <EM>Angelos -- </EM>is the
sole confidant and the executor of the universal decrees of Karma
and <EM>Adi-Budh: </EM>a kind of active and ever incarnating logos,
who leads and guides human affairs from the beginning to the end
of the Kalpa.
<P>
&quot;Pesh-Hun&quot; is a general not a special Hindu possession.
He is the mysterious guiding intelligent power, which gives the
impulse to, and regulates the impetus of cycles, Kalpas and universal
events.* He is Karma's visible adjuster on a general scale; the
<EM>inspirer </EM>and the leader of the greatest heroes of this
Manvantara. In the exoteric works he is referred to by some very
uncomplimentary names; such as &quot;Kali-Karaka,&quot; <EM>strife-maker,
</EM>&quot;Kapi-vaktra,&quot; <EM>monkey-faced, </EM>and even
&quot;Pisuna,&quot; the spy, though elsewhere he is called Deva-Brahma.
Even Sir W. Jones was strongly impressed with this mysterious
character from what he gathered in his Sanskrit Studies. He compares
him to Hermes and Mercury, and calls him &quot;the eloquent messenger
of the gods&quot; (see <EM>Asiat. Res. </EM>I. p. 264). All this
led the late Dr. Kenealy (&quot;<EM>Book of God</EM>&quot;)<EM>,
</EM>on the ground that the Hindus believe him to be a great Rishi,
&quot;who is for ever wandering about the earth, giving good counsel,&quot;
to see in him one of his twelve <EM>Messiahs. </EM>He was, perhaps,
not so far off the real track as some imagine.
<P>
What Narada <EM>really is, </EM>cannot be explained in print;
nor would the modern generations of the profane gather much from
the information. But it may be remarked, that if there is in the
Hindu Pantheon a deity which resembles Jehovah, in, tempting by
&quot;suggestion&quot; of thoughts and &quot;hardening&quot; of
the hearts of those whom he would make his tools and victims,
it is Narada. Only with the latter it is no desire to obtain a
pretext for &quot;plaguing,&quot; and thus showing that &quot;<EM>I
am </EM>the Lord God.&quot;
<P>
[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
<P>
* This is perhaps the reason why, in the Bhagavad Gita, we are
told that Brahma had communicated to Narada in the beginning that
all men whatsoever, even <EM>Mlechchhas, </EM>outcasts and barbarians,
might know the true nature of Vasudeva and learn to have faith
in that deity.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 49 THE MIRROR OF FUTURITY.</H6>

<P>
Nor is it through any ambitious or selfish motive; but, verily,
to serve and guide universal progress and evolution.
<P>
Narada is one of the few prominent characters, save some gods,
in the Puranas, who visits the so-called nether or infernal regions,
Patala. Whether or not it was from his intercourse with the thousand-headed
Sesha, the serpent who bears the seven Patalas and the entire
world like a diadem upon his heads, and who is the great teacher
of astronomy,* that Narada learned all that he knew, certain it
is that he surpasses Garga's Guru in his knowledge of cyclic intricacies.
It is he who has charge of our progress and national weal or woe.
It is he who brings on wars and puts an end to them. In the old
Stanzas Pesh-Hun is credited with having calculated and recorded
all the astronomical and cosmic cycles to come, and with having
taught the Science to the first gazers at the starry vault. And
it is Asuramaya, who is said to have based all his astronomical
works upon those records, to have determined the duration of all
the past geological and cosmical periods, and the length of the
all the cycles to come, till the end of this life-cycle, or the
end of the seventh Race.
<P>
There is a work among the Secret Books, called the &quot;Mirror
of Futurity,&quot; wherein all the Kalpas within Kalpas and cycles
within the bosom of Sesha, or infinite Time, are recorded. This
work is ascribed to <EM>Pesh-Hun </EM>Narada. There is another
old work which is attributed to various Atlanteans. It is these
two Records which furnish us with the figures of our cycles, and
the possibility of calculating the date of cycles to come. The
chronological calculations which will presently be given are,
however, those of the Brahmins as explained further on; but most
of them are also those of the Secret Doctrine.
<P>
The chronology and computations of the Brahmin Initiates are based
upon the Zodiacal records of India, and the works of the above-mentioned
astronomer and magician -- Asuramaya. The Atlantean zodiacal records
cannot err, as they were compiled under the guidance of those
who first taught astronomy, among other things, to mankind.
<P>
But here again we are deliberately and recklessly facing a new
difficulty. We shall be told that our statement is contradicted
by <EM>science, </EM>in the person of a man regarded as a great
authority (in the West) upon all subjects of Sanskrit literature
-- Professor Albrecht Weber, of Berlin. This, to our great regret,
cannot be helped; and we are ready to maintain what is now stated.
Asuramaya, to whom the epic tradition points as the earliest astronomer
in Aryavarta, one to whom &quot;the

* Sesha, who is also Ananta, the infinite, and the &quot;Cycle
of Eternity&quot; in esotericism, is credited with having given
his astronomical knowledge to Garga, the oldest astronomer of
India, who propitiated him, and forthwith knew all about the planets
and how to read omens.<HR>

<P>
Sun-god imparted the knowledge of the stars,&quot; <EM>in propria
persona, </EM>as Dr. Weber himself states, is identified by him,
in some very mysterious way, with the &quot;Ptolemaios&quot; of
the Greeks. No more valid reason is given for this identification
than that &quot;this latter name (Ptolemaios), as we see from
the inscription of Piyadasi, became the Indian 'Turamaya,' out
of which the name 'Asuramaya' <EM>might </EM>very easily grow.&quot;
No doubt it &quot;<EM>might,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>but the vital
question is -- Are there any good proofs that it <EM>has </EM>thus<EM>
grown? </EM>The only evidence that is given for it is, that it
<EM>must </EM>be so: &quot;since this Maya is distinctly assigned
to Romaka-pura in the West.&quot;* The Maya is evident, since
no Sanskritist among Europeans can tell where that locality of
&quot;Romaka-pura&quot; was, except, indeed, that it was somewhere
&quot;in the West.&quot; Anyhow, as no member of the Asiatic Society,
or Western Orientalist, will ever listen to a Brahmanical teaching,
it is useless to take the objections of European Orientalists
into consideration. &quot;Romakapura&quot; was in &quot;the West,&quot;
certainly, since it was part and parcel of the last continent
of <STRONG>A</STRONG>TLANTIS. And it is equally certain that it
is Atlantis, which is assigned in the Hindu Puranas as the birth-place
of Asuramaya, &quot;as great a magician as he was an Astrologer
and an Astronomer.&quot; Moreover, Prof. Weber refuses to assign
any great antiquity to the Indian Zodiac, and feels inclined to
think that the Hindus never knew of a Zodiac at all till &quot;they
had borrowed one from the Greeks.&quot;** This statement clashes
with the most ancient traditions of India, and must therefore
be ignored. (Vide &quot;<EM>The Zodiac and its Antiquity</EM>&quot;)<EM>.
</EM>We are the more justified in ignoring it, as the learned
German Professor himself tells us in the introduction to his work
(<EM>History of Sanskrit Literature</EM>)<EM> </EM>that &quot;in
addition to the natural obstacles which impede investigation (in
India), there still prevails a dense mist of prejudices and preconceived
opinions hovering over the land, and enfolding it as with a veil.&quot;
Caught in that veil, it is no wonder that Dr. Weber should himself
have been led into involuntary errors. Let us hope that he knows
better now.
<P>
Now whether Asuramaya is to be considered a modern myth, a personage
who flourished in the day of the Macedonian Greeks, or as that
which he is claimed to be by the Occultists, in any case his calculations
agree entirely with those of the Secret Records.

astronomer, and found in Southern India, the calendar elsewhere

tioned was compiled by two very learned Brahmins* in 1884 and
1885. The work is proclaimed by the best Pundits as faultless
-- from the Brahmanical standpoint -- and thus far relates to
the chronology of the orthodox teachings. If we compare its statements
with those made several years earlier in &quot;Isis Unveiled,&quot;
with the fragmentary teachings published by some Theosophists,
and with the present data derived from the Secret Books of Occultism,
the whole will be found to agree perfectly, save in some details
which may not be explained; for secrets of higher Initiation --
as unknown to the writer as they are to the reader -- would have
to be revealed, and that <EM>cannot be done.</EM> (But see &quot;<EM>Chronology
