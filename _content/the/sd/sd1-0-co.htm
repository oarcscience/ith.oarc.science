<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE Author -- the writer, rather -- feels it
necessary to apologise for the long delay which has occurred in
the appearance of this work. It has been occasioned by ill-health
and the magnitude of the undertaking. Even the two volumes now
issued do not complete the scheme, and these do not treat exhaustively
of the subjects dealt with in them. A large quantity of material
has already been prepared, dealing with the history of occultism
as contained in the lives of the great Adepts of the Aryan Race,
and showing the bearing of occult philosophy upon the conduct
of life, as it is and as it ought to be. Should the present volumes
meet with a favourable reception, no effort will be spared to
carry out the scheme of the work in its entirety. The third volume
is entirely ready; the fourth almost so.
<P>
This scheme, it must be added, was not in contemplation when the
preparation of the work was first announced. As originally announced,
it was intended that the &quot;Secret Doctrine&quot; should be
an amended and enlarged version of &quot;Isis Unveiled.&quot;
It was, however, soon found that the explanations which could
be added to those already put before the world in the last-named
and other works dealing with esoteric science, were such as to
require a different method of treatment: and consequently the
present volumes do not contain, in all, twenty pages extracted
from &quot;Isis Unveiled.&quot;
<P>
The author does not feel it necessary to ask the indulgence of
her readers and critics for the many defects of literary style,
and the imperfect English which may be found in these pages. She
is a foreigner, and her knowledge of the language was acquired
late in life. The English tongue is employed because it offers
the most widely-diffused medium for conveying the truths which
it had become her duty to place before the world.
<P>
These truths are in no sense put forward as a <I>revelation</I>;
nor does the author claim the position of a revealer of mystic
lore, now made public for the first time in the world's history.
For what is contained in this work is to be found scattered throughout
thousands of volumes embodying the scriptures of the great Asiatic
and early European religions, hidden under glyph and symbol, and
hitherto left unnoticed because of this veil. What is now attempted
is to gather the oldest tenets together and to make of them one
harmonious and unbroken whole. The sole advantage which the writer
has over her predecessors, is that she need not resort to personal
speculations and theories. For this work is a partial statement
of what she herself has been taught by more advanced students,
supplemented, in a few details only, by the results of her<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] viii</H6>

<P>
own study and observation. The publication of many of the facts
herein stated has been rendered necessary by the wild and fanciful
speculations in which many Theosophists and students of mysticism
have indulged, during the last few years, in their endeavour to,
as they imagined, work out a complete system of thought from the
few facts previously communicated to them.
<P>
It is needless to explain that this book is not the Secret Doctrine
in its entirety, but a select number of fragments of its fundamental
tenets, special attention being paid to some facts which have
been seized upon by various writers, and distorted out of all
resemblance to the truth.
<P>
But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings,
however fragmentary and incomplete, contained in these volumes,
belong neither to the Hindu, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldean, nor
the Egyptian religion,.neither to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism nor
Christianity exclusively. The Secret Doctrine is the essence of
all these. Sprung from it in their origins, the various religious
schemes are now made to merge back into their original element,
out of which every mystery and dogma has grown, developed, and
become materialised.
<P>
It is more than probable that the book will be regarded by a large
section of the public as a romance of the wildest kind; for who
has ever even heard of the book of Dzyan?
<P>
The writer, therefore, is fully prepared to take all the responsibility
for what is contained in this work, and even to face the charge
of having invented the whole of it. That it has many shortcomings
she is fully aware; all that she claims for it is that, romantic
as it may seem to many, its logical coherence and consistency
entitle this new Genesis to rank, at any rate, on a level with
the &quot;working hypotheses&quot; so freely accepted by modern
science. Further, it claims consideration, not by reason of any
appeal to dogmatic authority, but because it closely adheres to
Nature, and follows the laws of uniformity and analogy.
<P>
The aim of this work may be thus stated: to show that Nature is
not &quot;a fortuitous concurrence of atoms,&quot; and to assign
to man his rightful place in the scheme of the Universe; to rescue
from degradation the archaic truths which are the basis of all
religions; and to uncover, to some extent, the fundamental unity
from which they all spring; finally, to show that the occult side
of Nature has never been approached by the Science of modern civilization.
<P>
If this is in any degree accomplished, the writer is content.
It is written in the service of humanity, and by humanity and
the future generations it must be judged. Its author recognises
no inferior court of appeal. Abuse she is accustomed to; calumny
she is daily acquainted with; at slander she smiles in silent
contempt.
