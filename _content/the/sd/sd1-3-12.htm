ANCIENT THOUGHT IN MODERN DRESS.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>M</STRONG>ODERN <STRONG>S</STRONG>CIENCE IS ANCIENT THOUGHT
DISTORTED, and no more. We have seen, however, WHAT INTUITIONAL
SCIENTISTS THINK, and are busy about; and now the reader may be
given a few more proofs of the fact that more than one F.R.S.
is unconsciously approaching the derided Secret Sciences.
<P>
With regard to cosmogony and primeval matter, modern speculations
are undeniably ancient thought, <EM>improved </EM>by contradictory
theories of recent origin. But the whole foundation belongs to
Grecian and Indian Archaic astronomy and physics, in those days
always called philosophy. In all the Aryan and Greek speculations,
one meets with the conception of an all-pervading, unorganized,
and homogeneous matter, or <EM>Chaos</EM>,<EM> </EM>re-named by
modern scientists &quot;Nebular condition of the world-stuff.&quot;
What Anaxagoras called &quot;Chaos&quot; in his <EM>Homoiomeria
</EM>is now called &quot;primitive fluid&quot; by Sir W. Thomson.
The Hindu and Greek Atomists -- Kanada, Leucippus, Democritus,
Epicurus, Lucretius, etc., etc., are now reflected as in a clear
mirror, in the supporters of the atomic theory of our modern days,
beginning with Leibnitz's <EM>Monads</EM>,<EM> </EM>and ending
with the &quot;Vortical Atoms&quot; of Sir W. Thomson.* True,
the corpuscular theory of old is rejected, and the undulatory
theory has taken its place. But the question is, <EM>whether the
latter is so firmly established as not to be liable to be dethroned
as was its predecessor? </EM>Light from its metaphysical aspect
was fully treated of in &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>&quot;:<EM>
</EM>--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Light is the first begotten, and the first emanation of
the Supreme, and Light is Life, says the Evangelist and the Kabalist.
Both are electricity -- the life principle, the <I>anima mundi</I>,<I>
</I>pervading the universe, the electric vivifier of all things.
Light is the great Protean magician, and under the divine will
of the architect,** or rather the <I>architects</I>,<I> </I>the
&quot;Builders&quot; (called <I>One</I> collectively), its multifarious,
omnipotent waves gave birth to every form as well as to every
living being. From its swelling electric bosom, spring <I>matter
</I>and <I>spirit. </I>Within its beams lie the beginnings of
all physical and chemical action, and of all cosmic and spiritual
phenomena; it vitalizes and disorganizes; it gives life and produces
death, and from its primordial point gradually emerged into existence
the myriads of worlds, visible and invisible celestial bodies.
It was at the ray of this <I>First </I>mother, one in three, that

Plato, lighted a fire which we now call the sun,&quot;* and which
is <I>not </I>the cause of either light or heat, but merely the
focus, or, as we might say, the lens, by which the rays of the
primordial light become materialised, are concentrate upon our
Solar System, and produce all the correlations of forces.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is the <EM>Ether</EM>,<EM> </EM>as just explained in the
views of Metcalfe, repeated by Dr. Richardson, save the submission
of the former to some details of the modern undulatory theory.
We do not say that we deny the theory, but assert only that it
needs completion and re-arrangement. But the Occultists are by
no means the only <EM>heretics </EM>in this respect; for Mr. Robert
Hunt, F.R.S., remarks, in his <EM>Researches on Light in its Chemical
Relations</EM>,<EM> </EM>that: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . . &quot;the undulatory theory does not account for the results
of his experiments. Sir David Brewster, in his <I>Treatise on
Optics</I>,<I> </I>showing 'that the colours of vegetable life
arise . . . . from a specific attraction which the particles of
these bodies exercise over the differently-coloured rays of light,'
and that 'it is by the light of the sun that the coloured juices
of plants are elaborated, that the colours of bodies are changed,
etc. . . . .' remarks that it is not easy to allow 'that such
effects can be produced by the mere vibration of an ethereal medium.'
And he is <I>forced</I>,<I> </I>he says, 'by this class of facts,
to reason as if light was <I>material </I>(?).' Professor Josiah
P. Cooke, of Harvard University, says that he 'cannot agree .
. . . with those who regard the wave-theory of light as an established
principle of science.'** Herschell's doctrine, that the intensity
of light, in effect of each undulation, 'is inversely as the square
of the distance from the luminous body,' if correct, damages a
good deal, if it does not kill the undulatory theory. That he
is right, was proved repeatedly by experiments with photometers;
and though it begins to be much doubted, the undulatory theory
is still alive.&quot; (&quot;<I>Isis Unveiled</I>.&quot;)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
To this remark of Sir W. Brewster -- &quot;forced to reason as
if light was material&quot; -- there is a good deal to reply.
Light, in one sense, is certainly as material as electricity itself
is. And if electricity is <EM>not </EM>material, if it is only
&quot;a mode of motion,&quot; how is it that it can be <EM>stored
up </EM>in Faure's accumulators? Helmholtz says that electricity
must be as atomic as matter; and Mr. W. Crookes, F.R.S., supported
the view in his address to the Chemical Section of the British
Association, of which he was President (at Birmingham, 1886).
This is what Helmholtz says (<EM>in his Faraday Lectures</EM>,<EM>
</EM>1881):<EM> </EM>--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;If we accept the hypothesis that the elementary substances
are composed of atoms, we cannot avoid concluding that electricity
also, positive as well as negative, is divided into definite elementary
portions, which behave like atoms of electricity.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Here we have to repeat that which was already said in Section
IX: there is but one science that can henceforth direct modern
research into the one path which will lead to the discovery of
the whole, hitherto

<P>
occult, truth, and it is the youngest of all -- <EM>chemistry</EM>,<EM>
</EM>as it now stands reformed. There is no other, not excluding
astronomy, that can so unerringly guide scientific intuition,
as chemistry can. Two proofs of it are to be found in the world
of Science -- two great chemists, each among the greatest in his
own country, and these are Mr. Crookes and the late Professor
Butlerof: one, a thorough believer in abnormal phenomena; the
other, as fervid a Spiritualist as he was great in natural Sciences.
It becomes evident that while pondering over the ultimate divisibility
of matter, and in the hitherto <EM>fruitless </EM>chase after
the element of negative atomic weight, the scientifically trained
mind of the chemist must feel irresistibly drawn towards those
ever-shrouded worlds, to the mysterious beyond, whose measureless
depths seem to close against the approach of the too materialistic
hand that would fain draw aside its veil. &quot;It is the unknown
and the <EM>ever unknowable</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>warns the Monist-Agnostic.
Not so; answers the persevering chemist: -- &quot;We are on the
track and are not daunted, and fain would we enter the mysterious
region which <EM>ignorance tickets unknown.</EM>&quot;*
<P>
A few lines at the very close of his lecture on the <EM>Genesis
of the Elements </EM>--<EM> </EM>two or three sentences -- showed
the eminent Scientist to be on the royal road to the greatest
discoveries. He has been overshadowing for some time &quot;the
original <EM>protyle</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>and came to the conclusion
that &quot;he who grasps the Key will be permitted to unlock some
of the deepest mysteries of creation.&quot; The <EM>protyle</EM>,<EM>
</EM>as that great chemist explains: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;. . . is a word analogous to protoplasm, to express the
idea of the original primal matter existing before the evolution
of the chemical elements. The word I have ventured to use for
this purpose is compounded of [[<I>pro</I>]]<I> </I>(earlier than)
and [[<I>hyle</I>]] (the stuff of which things are made). The
word is scarcely a new coinage, for 600 years ago Roger Bacon
wrote in his <I>Arte Chymiae</I>,<I> </I>&quot;The<I> </I>elements
are made out of [[<I>hyle</I>]] and every element is converted
into the nature of another element.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The<EM> Knowledge </EM>of Roger Bacon did not come to this wonderful
old magician** by inspiration, but because he studied ancient
works on
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* Mr. Crookes' &quot;Presidential Address&quot; at Birmingham.
&quot;There is but one unknown -- <EM>the ultimate substratum
of Spirit </EM>(Space). That which is not the <EM>Absolute </EM>and
the One is, in virtue of that very differentiation, however far
removed from the physical senses, always accessible to the spiritual
human mind, which is a coruscation of the undifferentiable Integral.&quot;
-- (<EM>Practical Lessons on the Occult.</EM>)
<P>
** Thus, what the writer of the present work said ten years ago
in &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Vol. I.</EM>)<EM>
</EM>was prophetic, it seems. These are the words: &quot;Many
of these mystics, by following what they were taught by some treatises,
secretly preserved from one generation to another, <EM>achieved
discoveries which would</EM> <EM>not be despised even in our modern
days of exact sciences. </EM>Roger Bacon, the friar, was laughed
at as a quack, and is now generally numbered among 'pretenders'
to magic art; but his discoveries were nevertheless accepted,
and are now used by those who ridicule him the most. Roger Bacon
belonged by right, if not by fact, to that Brotherhood which includes
all those who [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

magic and alchemy, having a key to the real meaning of words.
But see what Mr. Crookes says of <EM>protyle</EM>,<EM> </EM>next
neighbour to the unconscious <EM>Mulaprakriti </EM>of the Occultists:
--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . . . &quot;Let us start at the moment when the first element
came into existence. Before this time, matter, as we know it,
was not. It is equally impossible to conceive of matter without
energy, as of energy without matter; from one point of view both
are convertible terms. Before the birth of atoms, all those forms
of energy, which become evident when matter acts upon matter,
could not have existed* -- they were locked up in the <I>protyle
</I>as latent potentialities only. Coincident with the creation
of atoms, all those attributes and properties, which form the
means of discriminating one chemical element from another, start
into existence fully endowed with energy.&quot; (<I>Presidential
Address</I>,<I> </I>p. 16.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
With every respect due to the great knowledge of the lecturer,
the Occultist would put it otherwise. They would say that no atom
is ever &quot;created,&quot; for the atoms are eternal within
the bosom of the <EM>One</EM> <EM>Atom</EM>,<EM> </EM>--<EM> </EM>&quot;the
atom of atoms&quot; -- viewed during Manvantara as the <EM>Jagad-Yoni
</EM>the<EM> material </EM>causative womb of the world. <EM>Pradhana
</EM>(unmodified matter), that which is the first form of <EM>Prakriti</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or material visible, as <EM>well as invisible </EM>nature,
and <EM>Purusha</EM>,<EM> </EM>spirit, are eternally one; and
they are <EM>Nirupadhi</EM>,<EM> </EM>(without adventitious qualities
or attributes) only during <EM>Pralaya</EM>,<EM> </EM>and when
<EM>beyond </EM>any of the planes of consciousness of existence.
The atom, as known to modern science, is inseparable from <EM>Purusha</EM>,<EM>
</EM>which is spirit, but is now called &quot;Energy&quot; in
Science. The <EM>protyle </EM>atom has not been comminuted or
subtilized: it has simply passed into that plane, which is no
plane, but the eternal state of everything beyond the planes of
illusion. Both <EM>Purusha </EM>and<EM> Pradhana </EM>are immutable
and unconsumable, or <EM>Aparinamin </EM>and <EM>Avyaya</EM>,<EM>
</EM>in eternity; and both during the Mayavic periods may be referred
to as <EM>Vyaya </EM>and<EM> Parinamin</EM>,<EM> </EM>or that
which can expand, pass away and disappear, and is &quot;modifiable.&quot;
In this sense <EM>Purusha</EM>,<EM> </EM>must of course, be held
distinct in our conceptions from <EM>Parabrahmam</EM>. Nevertheless
that, which is called &quot;energy&quot; or &quot;force&quot;
in Science and has been explained as a <EM>dual </EM>Force by
Metcalfe, is never, in fact, and cannot be <EM>energy </EM>alone;
for it is the substance of the world, its soul, the <EM>all</EM>-<EM>permeant
</EM>&quot;Sarvaga,&quot; in conjunction with <EM>Kala </EM>&quot;time.&quot;
The three are the trinity in one, during Manvantara, the all-potential
Unity, which acts on the plane of illusion (Maya) as three distinct
things. In Orphic

of that period.
<P>
But see how closely Mr. Crookes brushes by the &quot;Unknowable,&quot;
and what &quot;potentialities&quot; there are for the acceptance
of Occult truths in his discoveries. He continues, speaking of
the evolution of atoms: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;. . . . Let us pause at the end of the first complete vibration
and examine the result. We have already found the elements of
water, ammonia, carbonic acid, the atmosphere, plant and animal
life, phosphorus for the brain, salt for the seas, clay for the
solid earth . . . phosphates and silicates sufficient for a world
and inhabitants not so very different from what we enjoy at the
present day. True the human inhabitants would have to live in
a state of more than Arcadian simplicity, and the absence of calcic
phosphate would be awkward as far as the bone is concerned* .
. . At the lower end of our curve . . . we see a great hiatus
. . . This oasis, and the blanks which precede and follow it,
may be referred with much probability to the particular way in
which our Earth developed into a member of our solar system. If
this be so, it may be that on our Earth only these blanks occur,
and not generally throughout the universe.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This justifies several assertions in the Occult works.
<P>
<EM>Firstly</EM>,<EM> </EM>&quot;that neither stars nor the sun
can be said to be constituted of those terrestrial elements with
which the chemist is familiar, though they are all present in
the sun's outward robes -- and a host more of elements so far
unknown to science.&quot;
<P>
<EM>Secondly</EM>,<EM> </EM>that our globe has its own special
laboratory on the far-away outskirts of its atmosphere, crossing
which, every atom and molecule change and differentiate from their
primordial nature.
<P>
And <EM>Thirdly</EM>,<EM> </EM>that though no element present
on our earth could ever be possibly found wanting in the sun,
there are many others which have either not reached, or not as
yet been discovered on, our globe. &quot;Some may be missing in
certain stars and heavenly bodies in the process of formation;
or, though present in them, these elements, on account of their
present state, may not respond as yet to the usual scientific
tests.&quot;** Mr. Crookes speaks of an element of still lower
atomic weight than hydrogen, an <EM>element purely hypothetical
</EM>as far as our earth is concerned . . . though existing in
abundance in the chromosphere of the Sun -- the<EM> helium. </EM>Occult
Science adds that not one of the <EM>elements </EM>regarded by
chemistry as such really deserves the name.
<P>
Again we find Mr. Crookes speaking with approbation of &quot;Dr.
Carnelly's weighty argument in favour of <EM>the compound nature
of the so-called elements</EM>,<EM> </EM>from their analogy to
the compound radicles! &quot; Hitherto,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* It is just the existence of such worlds in other planes of consciousness
that is claimed by the Occultist. The secret science teaches that
the primitive race was <EM>boneless. </EM>(See Book II.); and
that there are (to us) invisible worlds, peopled as our own, besides
the <EM>populations </EM>of Dhyan Chohans.

alchemy alone succeeded within the historical periods, and in
the so-called civilized countries, in obtaining a real <EM>element</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or a particle of homogeneous matter, the <EM>Mysterium Magnum
</EM>of Paracelsus. But then it was before Lord Bacon's day.*
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;. . . Let us now turn to the upper portion of the scheme.
With hydrogen of atomic weight = 1, there is little room for other
elements, save, perhaps, for hypothetical <I>Helium</I>. But what
if we get 'through the looking-glass,' and cross the zero line
in search of new principles -- what shall we find on the other
side of zero? Dr. Carnelly asks for an element of negative atomic
weight; here is ample room and verge enough for a shadow series
of such unsubstantialities. Helmholtz says that electricity is
probably as atomic as matter; is electricity one of the negative
elements, and the luminiferous ether another? Matter, as we now
know it, does not here exist; the forms of energy which are apparent
in the motions of matter are as yet only latent possibilities.
<I>A substance of negative weight is not inconceivable.</I>**<I>
</I>But can we form a clear conception of a body which combines
with other bodies in proportions expressible by negative qualities?&quot;***
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;A genesis of the elements such as is here sketched out would
not be confined to our little solar system, but would probably
follow the same general sequence of events in every centre of
energy now visible as a star.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Before the birth of atoms to gravitate towards one another,
no pressure could be exercised; but at the outskirts of the fire-mist
sphere, within which all is protyle -- at the shell on which the
tremendous forces involved in the birth of a chemical element
exert full sway -- the fierce heat would be accompanied by gravitation
sufficient to keep the newly-born elements from flying off into
space. As temperature increases, expansion and molecular motion
increase, molecules tend to fly asunder, and their chemical affinities
become deadened; but the enormous pressure of the gravitation
of the mass of atomic matter, outside what I may for brevity call
the birth-shell, would counteract the action of heat.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Beyond the birth-shell would be a space in which no chemical
action could take place, owing to the temperature there being
above what is called the dissociation-point for compounds. In
this space the lion and the lamb would lie down together; phosphorus
and oxygen would mix without union; hydrogen and chlorine would
show no tendency to closer bonds; and even fluorine, that

[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
<P>
* Says Mr. Crookes in the same address: &quot;The first riddle
which we encounter in chemistry is: 'What are the elements?' Of
the attempts hitherto made to define or explain an element, none
satisfy the demands of the human intellect. The text books tell
us that an element is 'a body which has not been decomposed ''that
it is 'a something to which we can add, but from which we can
take nothing,' or 'a body which increases in weight with every
chemical change.' Such definitions are doubly unsatisfactory:
they are provisional, and may cease to-morrow to be applicable
in any given case. They take their stand, not on any attribute
of the things to be defined, but on the limitations of human power:
they are confessions of intellectual impotence.&quot;
<P>
** And the lecturer quotes Sir George Airy, who says (<EM>in Faraday</EM>'<EM>s
Life and Letters Vol. II.</EM>,<EM> p.</EM> 354), &quot;I can
easily conceive that there are plenty of bodies about us not subject
to this intermutual action, and <EM>therefore not subject to the
law of gravitation.</EM>&quot;

not physics, but metaphysics, called by Mr. Tyndall &quot;poetry&quot;

energetic gas which chemists have only isolated within the last
month or two, would float about free and uncombined.&quot;

&quot;Outside this space of free atomic matter would be another
shell, in which the formed chemical elements would have cooled
down to the combination point, and the sequence of events so graphically
described by Mr. Mattieu Williams in &quot;<I>The Fuel of the
Sun</I>&quot;<I> </I>would now take place, culminating in the
solid earth and the commencement of geological time&quot; (p.

<P>
This is, <EM>in a strictly scientific</EM>,<EM> </EM>but beautiful
language, the description of the evolution of the differentiated
Universe in the secret teachings. The learned gentleman closes
his address in words, every sentence of which is like a flash
of light from beyond the dark veil of materiality, hitherto thrown
upon the exact sciences, and a step forward towards the <EM>Sanctum
Sanctorum </EM>of the Occult. (<EM>Vide </EM>&#167; <EM>XV.</EM>,<EM>

</EM>Thus he says: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;We have glanced at the difficulty of defining an element;
we have noticed, too, the revolt of many leading physicists and
chemists against the ordinary acceptation of the term element;
we have weighed the improbability of their eternal existence,*
or <I>their origination by chance. </I>As a remaining alternative,
we have suggested their origin by a process of evolution like
that of the heavenly bodies according to Laplace, and the plants
and animals of our globe according to Lamarck, Darwin, and Wallace.**
In the general array of the elements, as known to us, we have
seen a striking approximation to that of the organic world.***
In lack of direct evidence of the decomposition of any element,
we have sought and found indirect evidence . . . . We have next
glanced at the view of the genesis of the elements; and lastly
we have reviewed a scheme of their origin suggested by Professor
Reynold's method of illustrating the periodic classification****
. . . Summing up all the above considerations we cannot,

* In the form they are now, we conceive?

** And to Kapila and Manu -- especially and originally.
<P>
*** Here is a scientific corroboration of the eternal law of correspondences
and analogy.
<P>
**** This method of illustrating the periodic law in the classification
of elements is, in the words of Mr. Crookes, proposed by Professor
Emerson Reynolds, of Dublin University, who . . . . &quot;points
out that in each period, the general properties of the elements
vary from one to another, with approximate regularity until we
reach the <EM>seventh member</EM>,<EM> </EM>which is in more or
less striking contrast with the first element of the same period,
as well as with the first of the next. Thus chlorine, the seventh
member of Mendeleef's third period, contrasts sharply with both
sodium, the first member of the same series, and with potassium,
the first member of the next series; whilst on the other hand,
sodium and potassium are closely analogous. The six elements,
whose atomic weights intervene between sodium and potassium, vary
in properties, step by step, until chlorine, the contrast to sodium,
is reached. But from chlorine to potassium, the analogue of sodium,
there is a change in properties <EM>per saltum</EM>. . . . . If
we thus recognise a contrast in properties -- more or less decided
-- between the first and the last members of each series, we can
scarcely help admitting the existence of a point of mean variation
within each system. In general the <EM>fourth </EM>element of
each series possesses the property we might expect a transition-element
to exhibit. . . . . Thus for the purpose of graphic translation,
Professor Reynolds considers that the fourth member of a period
-- silicon, for example -- may be placed at the apex of a symmetrical

<BLOCKQUOTE>
indeed, venture to assert positively <I>that our so-called elements
have been evolved from one primordial matter; but we may contend
that the balance of evidence, I think, fairly weighs in favour
of this speculation</I>.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Thus inductive Science, in its Branches of Astronomy, Physics,
and Chemistry, while advancing timidly towards the conquest of
Nature's secrets in her final effects on our terrestrial plane,
recedes to the days of Anaxagoras and the Chaldees in its discoveries
of (a) the origin of our phenomenal world, and (b) the modes of
formation of the bodies that compose the universe. And having
to turn back for their cosmogonical hypotheses to the beliefs
of the earliest philosophers, and the systems of the latter --
systems that were all based on the teachings of a universal secret
doctrine with regard to the primeval matter with its properties,
functions, and laws, -- have we not the right to hope that the
day is not far off when Science will show a better appreciation
of the wisdom of the ancients than it has hitherto done?
<P>
No doubt Occult philosophy could learn a good deal from exact
modern science; but the latter, on the other hand, might profit
by ancient learning in more than one way, and chiefly in Cosmogony.

for that particular period, the direction in which the properties
of the series of elements vary with rising atomic weights.

Now, the writer humbly confesses complete ignorance of modern
chemistry and its mysteries. But she is pretty well acquainted
with the Occult doctrine with regard to <EM>correspondences of
types and antitypes </EM>in nature, and perfect analogy as a fundamental
law in Occultism. Hence she ventures a remark which will strike
every Occultist, however it may be derided by orthodox Science.
This method of illustrating the periodic law in the behaviour
of elements, whether or not still a hypothesis in chemistry, <EM>is
a law</EM> <EM>in Occult Sciences. </EM>Every well-read Occultist
knows that the <EM>seventh </EM>and<EM> fourth </EM>members --
whether in a septenary chain of worlds, the septenary hierarchy
of angels, or in the constitution of man, animal, plant, or mineral
atom -- that the <EM>seventh </EM>and<EM> fourth </EM>members,
we say, in the geometrically and mathematically uniform workings
of the immutable laws of Nature, always play a distinct and specific
part in the septenary system. From the stars twinkling high in
heaven, to the sparks flying asunder from the rude fire built
by the savage in his forest; from the hierarchies and the essential
constitution of the Dhyan Chohans -- organized for diviner apprehensions
and a loftier range of perception than the greatest Western psychologist
ever dreamed of, down to Nature's <EM>classification </EM>of species
among the humblest insects; finally from worlds to atoms, everything
in the universe, from great to small, proceeds in its spiritual
and physical evolution, cyclically and septennially, showing its
seventh and fourth number (the latter the turning point) behaving
in the same way as shown in that periodic law of atoms. Nature
never proceeds <EM>per saltum. </EM>Therefore, when Mr. Crookes
remarks to this that he does not &quot;wish to infer that the
gaps in Mendeleef's table, and in this graphic representation
of it (the diagram showing the evolution of atoms) necessarily
mean that there are elements actually existing to fill up the
gaps; these gaps may only mean that at the birth of the elements
there was an easy potentiality of the formation of an element
which would fit into the place&quot; -- an Occultist would respectfully
remark to him that the latter hypothesis can only hold good, if
the septenary arrangement of atoms is not interfered with. This
is <EM>the one law</EM>,<EM> </EM>and an infallible method that
must always lead to success, one who follows it.<HR>

<P>
instance, the mystical signification, alchemical and transcendental,
of the many<EM> imponderable </EM>substances that fill interplanetary
space, and which, interpenetrating each, are the direct cause,
at the lower end, of the production of natural phenomena manifesting
through <EM>vibration </EM>(so-called). The knowledge of the <EM>real
</EM>(not the hypothetical) nature of Ether, or rather of the
<EM>Akasa</EM>,<EM> </EM>and other mysteries, in short, can alone
lead to the knowledge of Forces. It is that substance against
which the materialistic school of the physicists rebels with such
fury, especially in France,* and which exact Science has to advocate
notwithstanding. They cannot make away with it without incurring
the risk, like a modern Samson, of pulling down the pillars of
the Temple of Science, and getting buried under its roof.
<P>
The theories built upon the rejection of Force <EM>outside </EM>and
independent of<EM> Matter pure and simple</EM>,<EM> </EM>have
been all shown fallacious. They do not, and cannot, cover the
ground, and many of the scientific data are thus proved <EM>unscientific.
</EM>&quot;Ether produced Sound&quot; is said in the Puranas,
and the statement is laughed at. It is the vibrations in <EM>the
air</EM>,<EM> </EM>we are corrected. And what is air? Could it
exist if there were no etheric medium in Space to buoy up its
molecules? The case stands simply thus. Materialism cannot admit
the existence of anything <EM>outside </EM>matter, because with
the acceptance of an imponderable <EM>Force</EM> -- the source
and head of all the physical Forces -- other <EM>intelligent </EM>Forces
would have to be admitted virtually, and that would lead Science
very far. For it would have to accept as a sequel the presence
in Man of a still more spiritual power -- entirely independent,
for once, of any kind of matter physicists know anything about.
Hence, apart from an hypothetical ether of Space and gross physical
bodies, the whole Sidereal and unseen Space is, in the sight of
the materialists, one boundless <EM>void</EM> in nature -- blind,
unintelligent, useless.
<P>
And now the next question is: What is that Cosmic Substance, and
how far can one go to suspect its nature or to wrench from it
its secrets, and thus feel justified in giving it a NAME? How
far, especially, has modern Science gone in the direction of those
secrets, and what it is doing to solve them. The latest hobby
of Science, the &quot;Nebular Theory,&quot; may afford us some
answer to this question. Let us then examine the credentials of
the <STRONG>N</STRONG>EBULAR <STRONG>T</STRONG>HEORY.
