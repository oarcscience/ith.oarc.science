<H4>GIANTS, CIVILIZATIONS, AND SUBMERGED<BR>
CONTINENTS TRACED IN HISTORY.</H4>

<P>
<B>W</B>HEN statements such as are comprised in the above heading
are brought forward, the writer is, of course, expected to furnish
<I>historical </I>instead of <I>legendary </I>evidence in support
of such claims. Is this possible? Yes; for evidence of this nature
is plentiful, and has simply to be collected and brought together
to become overwhelming in the eyes of the unprejudiced.
<P>
Once the sagacious student gets hold of the guiding thread he
may find it out for himself. We give <I>facts </I>and show land-marks:
let the wayfarer follow them. <I>What is given here is amply sufficient
for </I>THIS<I> Century.</I> 
<P>
In a letter to Voltaire, Bailly finds it quite natural that the
sympathies of the &quot;grand old invalid of Ferney&quot; should
be attracted to the &quot;representatives of knowledge and wisdom,
the Brahmans of India.&quot; He then adds a curious statement.
&quot;But,&quot; he says, &quot;your Brahmans are very young in
comparison with their ancient instructors.&quot;*
<P>
Bailly, who knew nought of the esoteric teachings, nor of Lemuria,
believed, nevertheless, unreservedly in the lost Atlantis, and
also in several pre-historic and civilized nations which had disappeared
without leaving any undeniable trace. He had studied the ancient
classics and <I>traditions </I>extensively, and he saw that the
arts and sciences known to those we now call the &quot;ancients,&quot;
were &quot;not the achievements of any of<I> the now or even then
existing </I>nations, nor of any of the historical peoples of
Asia.&quot; And that, notwithstanding the learning of the Hindoos,
their undeniable priority in the antiquity of their race had to
be referred to a people or a race still more ancient and more
learned than were even the Brahmans themselves.**
<P>
Voltaire, the greatest sceptic of his day, the materialist <I>par
excellence, </I>shared Bailly's belief. He thought it quite <I>likely
</I>&quot;<I>that long before the empires of China and India,
there had been nations cultured, learned, and powerful, which
a deluge of barbarians overpowered and thus replunged into their
primitive state of ignorance and savagery, or what they call the
state of pure nature.</I>&quot;<I> </I>(&quot;<I>Lettres sur l</I>'<I>Atlantide,</I>&quot;<I>

*** This conjecture is but a half-guess. There were such &quot;deluges
of barbarians&quot; in the Fifth Race. With regard to the Fourth,
it was a <I>bond fide </I>deluge of water which swept it away.
Neither Voltaire nor Bailly, however, knew anything of the Secret
Doctrine of the East.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 743 A MYSTERIOUS NATION.</H6>

<P>
That which with Voltaire was the shrewd conjecture of a great
intellect, was with Bailly &quot;a question of historical facts.&quot;
For &quot;I make <I>great case of ancient traditions </I>preserved
through a long series of generations,&quot; he wrote. (<I>Ibid.</I>)
It<I> was </I>possible, he thought, that a<I> foreign </I>nation
should, after instructing another nation, so disappear that it
should leave no traces behind. When asked how it could have happened
that this ancient, or rather archaic, nation should not have left
at least some recollection in the human mind, he answered that
Time was a pitiless devourer of facts and events. But, the history
of the Past was never entirely lost, for the Sages of old Egypt
had preserved it, and &quot;it is so preserved to this day elsewhere.&quot;
&quot;You do not know which was the best and most handsome generation
of men which has ever lived on this earth,&quot; said the priests
of Sais to Solon, according to Plato. &quot;Only a weak seed of
it, of which you (Greeks) are the descendants,* is all that remains.&quot;
&quot;Their books,&quot; they added, &quot;preserved the records
of a great nation, which emerging from the Atlantic sea had invaded
Europe and Asia (<I>Timaeus</I>)<I>. </I>The Greeks were but the
dwarfed and weak remnant of that once glorious nation. . . .&quot;**
<P>
What was this nation? The secret doctrine teaches that it was
the latest, seventh sub-race of the Atlanteans, already swallowed
up in one of the early sub-races of the Aryan stock, one that
had been gradually spreading over the continent and islands of
Europe, as soon as they had begun to emerge from the seas. Descending
from the high plateaux of Asia, where the two Races had sought
refuge in the days of the agony of Atlantis, it had been slowly
settling and colonizing the freshly emerged lands. The emigrant
sub-race had rapidly increased and multiplied on that virgin soil;
had divided into many families, which in their turn divided into
nations. Egypt and Greece, the Phoenicians, and the Northern stocks,
had thus proceeded from that one sub-race. Thousands of years
later, other races -- the remnants of the Atlanteans -- &quot;yellow
and red, brown and black,&quot; began to invade the new continent.
There were wars in which the new comers were defeated; and they
fled, some to Africa, others to remote countries. Some of these
lands became in course of time -- owing to new geological convulsions
-- islands. Being thus forcibly

Greeks and Romans, and the Atlantean colonists, cf. &quot;Five
Years of Theosophy.&quot;
<P>
** The story about Atlantis and all the traditions thereon were
told, as all know, by Plato in his &quot;<I>Timaeus and Critias.</I>&quot;<I>
</I>Plato, when a child, had it from his grand-sire Critias, aged
ninety, who in his youth had been told of it by Solon, his father
Dropidas' friend -- Solon, one of the <I>Grecian Seven Sages.
</I>No more reliable source could be found, we believe.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 744 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
separated from the continents, the result was that the undeveloped
tribes and families of the Atlantean stock fell gradually into
a still more abject and savage condition.
<P>
Did not the Spaniards in the Cibola expeditions <I>meet with </I>WHITE
savage chiefs; and has not the presence of African negro types
in Europe in the pre-historic ages been now ascertained? It is
this presence of a type associated with that of the negro, and
also with that of the Mongolian, which is the stumbling-block
of anthropology. The individual who lived at an incalculably distant
period at La Naulette, in Belgium (<I>Vide</I> Dr. Carter Blake's
paper &quot;<I>On the Naudette Jaw,</I>&quot;<I> Anthrop. Review,
</I>Sept., 1867), is an example. &quot;The caves on the banks
of the Lesse, in South-Eastern Belgium,&quot; says this Anthropologist,
&quot;afford evidence of what is, perhaps, the lowest man, as
shown by the Naulette jaw. Such man, however, had amulets of stone,
perforated for the purpose of ornament; these are made of a psammite
now found in the basin of the Gironde.&quot;
<P>
Thus Belgian man was extremely ancient. That man who was antecedent
to the great flood of waters -- which covered the highlands of
Belgium with a deposit of <I>lehm </I>or upland gravel 30 metres
above the level of the present rivers -- must have combined the
characters of the Turanian and the negro. The Canstadt, or La
Naulette, man, may have been black, and had nothing to do with
the Aryan type whose remains are contemporary with those of the
cave bear at Engis. The denizens of the Aquitaine bone-caves belong
to a far later period of history, and may not be as ancient as
the former.
<P>
If the statement is objected to on the ground that Science does
not deny the presence of man on earth from an enormous antiquity,
though that antiquity cannot be determined, since that presence
is conditioned by the duration of geological periods, the age
of which is not ascertained; if it is argued that the Scientists
object most decidedly to the claim that man preceded the animals,
for instance; or that civilization dates from the earliest Eocene
period, or, again, that there have ever existed giants, three-eyed
and four-armed and four-legged men, androgynes, etc., then the
objectors are asked in their turn, &quot;How do you know? What
proof have you besides your personal hypotheses, each of which
may be upset any day by new discoveries?&quot; And these future
discoveries are sure to prove that, whatever this earlier type
of man known to Anthropologists was in complexion, he was in no
respect <I>apish. </I>The Canstadt man, the Engis man alike possessed
essentially human attributes. (<I>Vide</I> de Quatrefages and
Hamy. &quot;<I>Cranes des Races Humaines.</I>&quot;)<I> </I>People<I>
</I>have looked for the missing link at the wrong end of the chain;
and the Neander valley man has long since been dismissed to the
&quot;limbo of all hasty blunders&quot; (<I>Ibid.</I>). Disraeli
divided man into the associates of the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 745 REMARKABLE &quot;COINCIDENCES.&quot;
</H6>

<P>
apes and the angels. Reasons are given in the text in favour of
an &quot;angelic theory,&quot; -- as Christians would say -- at
least as applicable to some of the races of men. At all events,
if man exists only since the Miocene period, even then, humanity
as a whole could not be composed of the abject savages of the
Palaeolithic age, as they are now represented by the Scientists.
All they say is mere arbitrary speculative guess-work, invented
by them to answer to and fit in with their own fanciful theories.
<P>
We speak of events hundreds of thousands years old, nay, even
millions -- if man dates from the geological periods* -- not of
any of those events which happened during the few thousand years
of the pre-historic margin allowed by timid and ever-cautious
history. Yet there are men of science who are almost of our way
of thinking. From the brave confession of the Abbe Brasseur de
Bourbourg, who says that: -- &quot;Traditions, whose traces recur
in Mexico, in Central America, in Peru, and in Bolivia, suggest
the idea that man existed in these different countries at the
time of the gigantic upheaval of the Andes, and that he has retained
the memory of it&quot; -- down to the latest palaeontologists
and anthropologists, the majority of scientific men is in favour
of just such an antiquity. <I>Apropos </I>of Peru, has any satisfactory
attempt been made to determine the ethnological affinities and
characteristics of the race which reared those <I>Cyclopean </I>erections,
the ruins of which display the relics of a great civilization?
At Cuelap, for instance, such are found, consisting &quot;of a
wall of wrought stones, 3,600 feet long, 560 broad, and 150 feet
high, constituting a solid mass with a level summit. On this mass
was another, 600 feet long, 500 broad, and 150 feet high, making
an aggregate height of 300 feet. In it were rooms and cells.&quot;
(<I>Cf., </I>the mass of evidence collected by Donnelly to prove
the <I>Peruvian colony </I>an offshoot of the Atlanteans.) A most
suggestive fact is the <I>startling resemblance between the architecture
of these colossal buildings and that of the archaic European nations.
</I>Mr. Fergusson regards the analogies between the ruins of &quot;Inca&quot;
civilization and the Cyclopean remains of the Pelasgians in Italy
and Greece as a coincidence &quot;the most remarkable in the history
of architecture.&quot; &quot;It is difficult to resist the conclusion
that there may be some relation between them.&quot; The &quot;relation&quot;
is simply explained by the derivation of the stocks,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Haeckel's &quot;Man-ape&quot; of the <I>Miocene </I>period is
the dream of a monomaniac, which de Quatrefages (see his &quot;<I>Human
Species,</I>&quot;<I> pp. </I>105-113) has cleverly disposed of.
It is not clear why the world should accept the lucubrations of
a psychophobic materialist, (to accept whose theory necessitates
the acceptance <I>on faith </I>of various animals unknown to Science
or Nature -- like the Sozura, for instance, that amphibian which
has never existed anywhere outside Haeckel's imagination), rather
than the traditions of antiquity.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 746 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
who devised these erections, from a common centre in an Atlantic
continent. The acceptance of the latter can alone assist us to
approach a solution of this and similar problems in almost every
branch of modern science.
<P>
Dr. Lartet, treating upon the subject, settles the question by
declaring that: -- &quot;The truth, so long contested, of the
co-existence of man with the great extinct species (<I>Elephas
primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorrhinus, Hyaena spelaea, Ursus spelaeus,
etc., etc.</I>)<I>, </I>appears to me to be henceforth unassailable
and definitely conquered by science.&quot; (&quot;<I>Cavernes
de Perigord,</I>&quot;<I> p. </I>35.)
<P>
It is shown elsewhere that such is also de Quatrefages' opinion.
&quot;Man has in all probability seen Miocene times* and consequently
the entire Pliocene epoch,&quot; he says, and there are reasons
for believing that &quot;his traces will be found further back
still, . . . .&quot; he adds (&quot;<I>The</I> <I>Human Species,</I>&quot;
p<I>. </I>152.)
<P>
Egypt is far older than Europe as now traced on the map. Atlanto-Aryan
tribes began to settle on it, when the British Islands** and France
were not even in existence. It is well known that &quot;the tongue
of the AEgyptian Sea,&quot; or the Delta of lower Egypt, became
firm land very gradually, and followed the highlands of Abyssinia;
unlike the latter, which arose suddenly, comparatively speaking,
it was very slowly formed, through long ages, from successive
layers of sea slime and mud, deposited annually by the soil brought
down by a large river, the present Nile. Yet even the Delta as
a firm and fertile land, has been inhabited for more than 100,000
years. Later tribes, with still more Aryan blood in them than
their predecessors, arrived from the East, and <I>conquered</I>
it<I> </I>from a people whose very name is lost to posterity,
except in Secret works. It is this natural barrier of slime, which
sucked in slowly and surely every boat that approached these inhospitable
shores, that was, till within a few thousand of years <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>.,
the best safeguard of the later Egyptians, who had managed to
reach it through Arabia, Abyssinia, and Nubia, led on by Manu
Vina in the day of Visvamitra. (<I>See in </I>&quot;<I>Isis Unveiled,</I>&quot;<I>
</I>vol. 1, p. 627, what Kulluka Bhatta says.)
<P>
So evident does the antiquity of man become with every day that
even the Church is preparing an <I>honourable </I>surrender and
retreat. The learned Abbe Fabre, professor at the Sorbonne, has
categorically declared
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The ingenious author of &quot;Atlantis, the Ante-diluvian World,&quot;
in discussing the origin of various Grecian and Roman institutions,
expresses his conviction that &quot;the <I>roots of the institutions
of to-day reach back to the Miocene Age.</I>&quot;<I> </I>Ay,
and further yet, as already stated.
<P>
** As we know them, however. For not only does Geology prove that
the British islands have been <I>four times submerged and re-elevated,
</I>but that the straits between them and Europe were dry land
at a remote former epoch.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 747 THE SEVEN SABBATHS.</H6>

<P>
that pre-historic palaeontology and archaeology may, without any
harm to the Scriptures, discover in the tertiary beds . . . .
. the traces of <I>pre-adamite </I>man as much as they like. &quot;Since
it disregards all creations <I>anterior to the last deluge </I>but
one, (that which produced the diluvium, according to the Abbe),
Bible revelation leaves us free to admit the existence of man
in the grey diluvium, in Pliocene, and even Eocene strata. On
the other hand, however, geologists <I>are not all agreed in regarding
the men who inhabited the globe in these primitive ages as our
ancestors</I>.*
<P>
The day when the Church will find that its only salvation lies
in the <I>occult</I> interpretation of the Bible, may not be so
far off as some imagine. Already many an abbe and ecclesiastic
has become an ardent Kabalist, and as many appear publicly in
the arena, breaking a lance with Theosophists and Occultists in
support of the metaphysical interpretation of the Bible. But they
commence, unfortunately for them, from the wrong end. They are
advised, before they begin to speculate upon the <I>metaphysical
</I>in their Scriptures, to study and master that which relates
to the purely <I>physical -- e.g., </I>its geological and ethnological
hints. For such allusions to the Septenary constitution of the
Earth and Man, to the seven Rounds and Races, abound in the New
as in the Old Testaments, and are as visible as the sun in the
heavens to him who reads both symbolically. What do the laws in
chapter xxiii., v. 15, of <I>Leviticus </I>apply to? What is the
philosophy of reason for all such <I>hebdomadic </I>offerings
and symbolical calculations as: &quot;ye shall count . . . . from
the morrow after the Sabbath . . . . that ye brought the sheaf
of the wave offering; <I>seven Sabbaths shall be completed</I>&quot;<I>
</I>(15), &quot;And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs
without blemish&quot; (18), etc. etc. We shall be contradicted,
no doubt, when we say that all these &quot;wave&quot; and &quot;peace&quot;
offerings were in commemoration of the <I>Seven</I> &quot;Sabbaths&quot;
of the mysteries, which Sabbaths are seven pralayas, between seven
manvantaras, or what we call <I>Rounds -- </I>for &quot;Sabbath&quot;
<I>is</I> an elastic word, meaning a period of Rest of whatever
nature, as explained elsewhere (Part <STRONG>II</STRONG>, &quot;<I>Sections
on the Septenary.</I>&quot;) And if this is not sufficiently conclusive,
then we may turn to the verse which follows (16), and which adds,
&quot;even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye
number fifty days&quot; (forty-nine, 7 x 7, stages of activity,
and forty-nine stages <I>of rest, </I>on the seven globes of the
chain, and then

<I>* </I>&quot;<I>Les origines de la terre et de l</I>'<I>homme,</I>&quot;<I>
p. </I>454. To this, Professor N. Joly, of Toulouse, who quotes
the Abbe in his &quot;<I>Man before Metals,</I>&quot;<I> </I>expresses
the hope that M. Fabre will permit him &quot;to differ from him
on this last point,&quot; p. 186. So do the Occultists; for though
they claim a vast difference in the physiology and outward appearance
of the five races so far evolved, still they maintain that the
present human species has descended from one and the same primitive
stock, evolved from the &quot;divine men&quot; -- our common ancestors
and progenitors.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 748 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
comes the <I>rest </I>of Sabbath, the <I>fiftieth</I>);<I> </I>after
which &quot;ye shall offer <I>a new meat offering </I>unto the
Lord,&quot; <I>i.e.</I>, ye shall make an offering of your flesh
or &quot;coats of skin,&quot; and, divesting yourselves of your
bodies, ye shall remain pure spirits. This law of offering, degraded
and materialized with ages, was an institution that dated from
the earliest Atlanteans; it came to the Hebrews <I>via</I> the
&quot;Chaldees,&quot; who were the &quot;wise men&quot; of a <I>caste,
</I>not of a nation, a community of great adepts come from their
&quot;Serpent-holes,&quot; and who had settled in Babylonia ages
before. And if this interpretation from <I>Leviticus </I>(full
of the disfigured laws of Manu) is found too far-fetched, then
turn to <I>Revelation. </I>Whatever interpretation profane mystics
may give to the famous Chapter xvii., with its riddle of the woman
in purple and scarlet; whether Protestants nod at the Roman Catholics,
when reading &quot;<B>M</B>YSTERY, <B>B</B>ABYLON THE <B>G</B>REAT,
THE <B>M</B>OTHER OF <B>H</B>ARLOTS AND <B>A</B>BOMINATIONS OF
THE <B>E</B>ARTH,&quot; or Roman Catholics glare at the Protestants,
the Occultists pronounce, in their impartiality, that these words
have applied from the first <I>to all and every exoteric </I>Churchianity,
that which was the &quot;ceremonial magic&quot; of old, with its
terrible effects, and is now the harmless (because distorted)
farce of ritualistic worship. The &quot;mystery&quot; of the woman
and of the beast, are the symbols of soul-killing Churchianity
and of <B>S</B>UPERSTITION. &quot;The beast that was, and is not,
and yet is.&quot; &quot;And here is the Mind which hath wisdom.
The seven heads are seven mountains (seven continents and seven
races) on which the woman sitteth,&quot; the symbol of all the
exoteric, barbarous, idolatrous faiths which have covered that
symbol &quot;with the blood of the saints and the blood of the
martyrs&quot; who protested and do protest. &quot;And there are
<I>seven Kings </I>(seven races); five are fallen (our fifth race
included), and one is (the fifth continues), and the other (the
<I>sixth </I>and the <I>seventh </I>races) is not yet come. .
. . And when he (the race &quot;King&quot;) cometh, he must continue
a short space&quot; (v. 10). There are many such Apocalyptic allusions,
but the student has to find them out for himself. These five Kings
were mentioned before.
<P>
If the Bible combines with archaeology and geology to show that
human civilization has passed through three more or less distinct
stages, in Europe at least; and if man, both in America and Europe,
as much as in Asia, dates from geological epochs -- why should
not the statements of the Secret Doctrine be taken into consideration?
Is it more philosophical or logical and scientific too, to <I>disbelieve,
</I>with Mr. Albert Gaudry, in Miocene man, while believing that
the famous Thenay flints* &quot;were carved by the <I>Dryopithecus
monkey</I>&quot;;<I> </I>or, with the Occultist, that the anthro-
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* &quot;The flints of Thenay bear unmistakable trace of the work
of human hands.&quot; (<I>G.</I> <I>de Mortillet, </I>&quot;<I>Promenades
au Musee de St. Germain,</I>&quot;<I> p. </I>76.)<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 749 THE APE LATER THAN MAN.</H6>

<P>
pomorphous monkey came ages after man? For if it is once conceded,
and even scientifically demonstrated, that &quot;there was not
in the middle of the Miocene epoch a single species of mammal
identical with species now extant&quot; (Albert Gaudry &quot;<I>Les
Enchainements du monde animal dans les temps geologiques</I>&quot;<I>
p. </I>240); and that man was then just as he is now; only taller,
and more athletic than we are,* -- then where is the difficulty?
That they could hardly be the descendants of monkeys, which are
themselves not traced before the Miocene epoch,** is, on the other
hand, testified to by several eminent naturalists.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Thus, in the savage of quaternary ages who had to fight
against the mammoth with stone weapons, we find all those craniological
characters generally considered as the sign of great intellectual
development&quot; (<I>de Quatrefages, </I>&quot;<I>The Human Species,
</I>p. 312.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Unless man emerged spontaneously, endowed with all his intellect
and wisdom, from his brainless catarrhine ancestor, he could not
have acquired such brain within the limits of the Miocene period,
if we are to believe the learned Abbe Bourgeois (<I>Vide infra,
</I>footnote**).
<P>
As to the matter of giants, though the tallest man hitherto found
in Europe among fossils is the &quot;Mentone man&quot; (6 ft.
8 in.), others may yet be excavated. Nilsson, quoted by Lubbock,
states that &quot;in a tomb of the neolithic age . . . . a skeleton
of extraordinary size was found in 1807,&quot; and that it was
attributed to a king of Scotland, Albus McGaldus.
<P>
And if in our own day we occasionally find men and women from
7 ft. to even 9 ft. and 11 ft. high, this only proves -- on the
law of atavism, or the reappearance of ancestral features of character
-- that there was a time when 9 ft. and 10 ft. was the average
height of humanity, even in our latest Indo-European race.
<P>
But as the subject was sufficiently treated elsewhere, we may
pass on to the Lemurians and the Atlanteans, and see what the
old Greeks knew of these early races and what the moderns know
now.
<P>
The great nation mentioned by the Egyptian priests, from which
descended the forefathers of the Greeks of the age of Troy, and
which, as averred, had been destroyed by the Atlantic race, was
then, as we see, assuredly no race of Palaeolithic <I>savages.
</I>Nevertheless, already in the days of Plato, with the exception
of priests and Initiates, no one seems
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Speaking of the reindeer hunters of Perigord, Joly says of them
that &quot;they were of <I>great height, </I>athletic, with a
strongly built skeleton . . .&quot; etc. (&quot;<I>Man before
Metals,</I>&quot;<I> p. </I>353)<I>.</I> 
<P>
** &quot;On the shores of the lake of Beauce,&quot; says the Abbe
Bourgeois, &quot;man lived in the midst of a fauna which completely
disappeared (<I>Aceratherium, Tapir, Mastodon</I>)<I>. With the
fluviatile sands of Orleanais came the anthropomorphous monkey
</I>(pliopithecus antiquus); therefore, later than man.&quot;
(<I>See Comptes Rendus of the </I>&quot;<I>Prehistoric Congress</I>&quot;<I>
of </I>1867<I> at Paris.</I>)<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 750 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
to have preserved any distinct recollection of the preceding races.
The earliest Egyptians had been separated from the latest Atlanteans
for ages upon ages; they were themselves descended from an <I>alien</I>
race, and had settled in Egypt some 400,000 years before,* but
their Initiates had preserved <I>all the records. </I>Even so
late as the time of Herodotus, they had still in their possession
the statues of 341 kings who had reigned over their little Atlanto-Aryan
Sub-race (<I>Vide</I> about the latter &quot;<I>Esoteric Buddhism,</I>&quot;<I>
p. </I>66, Fifth Edition.) If one allows only twenty years as
an average figure for the reign of each King, the duration of
the Egyptian Empire has to be pushed back, from the day of Herodotus,
about 17,000 years.
<P>
Bunsen allowed the great Pyramid an antiquity of 20,000 years.
More modern archaeologists will not give it more than 5,000, or
at the utmost 6,000 years; and generously concede to Thebes with
its hundred gates, 7,000 years from the date of its foundation.
And yet there are records which show Egyptian priests -- Initiates
-- journeying in a North-Westerly direction, <I>by land, via</I>
what became later the Straits of Gibraltar; turning North and
travelling through the future Phoenician settlements of Southern
Gaul; then still further North, until reaching Carnac (Morbihan)
they turned to the West again and arrived, <I>still travelling
by land, </I>on the North-Western promontory of the New Continent.**
<P>
What was the object of their long journey? And how far back must
we place the date of such visits? The archaic records show the
Initiates of the Second Sub-race of the Aryan family moving from
one land to the other for the purpose of supervising the building
of <I>menhirs </I>and dolmens, of colossal Zodiacs in stone, and
places of sepulchre to serve as receptables for the ashes of generations
to come. When was it? The fact of their crossing from France to
Great Britain <I>by land </I>may give an idea of the date when
such a journey could have been performed on <I>terra firma.</I>

two baked bricks were discovered, one at the depth of 20, the
other at 25 yards. If we estimate the thickness of the annual
deposit formed by the river at 8 inches per century (more careful
calculations have shown no more than from three to five per century),
we must assign to the first of these bricks 12,000 years, and
to the second 14,000 years. By means of analogous calculations,
Burmeister supposes 72,000 years to have elapsed since the first
appearance of man on the soil of Egypt, and Draper attributes

If &quot;there is nothing impossible&quot; scientifically in the
idea, and it may be admitted that man lived already as early as
the Tertiary period, then it is just as well to remind the reader
that Mr. Croll places the beginning of that period 2,500,000 years
back (See Croll's &quot;<I>Climate and Time</I>&quot;);<I> </I>but
there was a time when he assigned to it 15,000,000 years.

The modern archeologist, though speculating <I>ad infinitum </I>upon
the dolmens and their builders, knows, in fact, nothing of them
or their origin. Yet, these weird, and often colossal monuments
of unhewn stones -- which consist generally of four or seven gigantic
blocks placed together -- are strewn over Asia, Europe, America,
and Africa, in groups or rows. Stones of enormous size are found
placed horizontally and variously upon two, three, four, and as
in Poitou, upon six and seven blocks. People name them &quot;devil's
altars,&quot; druidic stones, and giant tombs. The stones of Carnac
in the Morbihan, Brittany -- nearly a mile in length and numbering
11,000 ranged in eleven rows -- are twin sisters of those at Stonehenge.
The Conical <I>menhir </I>of Loch-Maria-ker in Morbihan, measures
twenty yards in length and nearly two yards across. The Menhir
of Champ Dolent (near St. Malo) rises thirty feet above the ground,
and is fifteen feet in depth below. Such dolmens and prehistoric
monuments are met with in almost every latitude. They are found
in the Mediterranean basin; in Denmark (among the local <I>tumuli
</I>from twenty-seven to thirty-five feet in height); in Shetland,
and in Sweden, where they are called <I>ganggriften </I>(or tombs
with corridors); in Germany, where they are known as the giant
tombs (Hunengraben); in Spain (see the dolmen of <I>Antiguera
</I>near Malaga), and Africa; in Palestine and Algeria; in Sardinia
(see the <I>Nuraghi </I>and <I>Sepolture dei giganti, </I>or tombs
of giants); in Malabar, in India, where they are called the tombs
of the <I>Daityas </I>(giants) and of the <I>Rakshasas, </I>the
men-demons of <I>Lanka</I>;<I> </I>in Russia and Siberia, where
they are known as the <I>Koorgan</I>;<I> </I>in Peru and Bolivia,

There is no country from which they are absent. Who built them?
Why are they all connected with Serpents and Dragons, with Alligators
and Crocodiles? Because remains of &quot;palaeolithic man&quot;
were, it is thought, found in some of them, and because in the
funeral mounds of America bodies of later races were discovered
with the usual paraphernalia of bone necklaces, weapons, stone
and copper urns, etc., hence they are declared ancient <I>tombs.

</I>Yet one is told authoritatively that the Mounds, and the Mound
or Dolmen Builders, are all &quot;Pelasgic&quot; in Europe, antecedent
to the Incas, in America, yet of &quot;not extremely distant times.&quot;
They are built by &quot;<I>no </I>race of Dolmen Builders,&quot;
which <I>never existed </I>(opinion of De Mortillet, Bastian,
and Westropp) save in the earlier archeological fancy. Finally
Virchow's opinion of the giant tombs of Germany is now accepted
as an axiom: -- &quot;The tombs alone are gigantic, and not the
bones they contain&quot; -- says that German biologist; and archaeology
has but to bow and submit to the decision.**
<P>
That no gigantic skeletons have been hitherto found in the &quot;tombs&quot;
is yet no reason to say there never were the remains of giants
in them. <I>Cremation was universal </I>till a comparatively recent
period -- some 80, or 100,000 years ago. The real giants, moreover,
were nearly all drowned with Atlantis. Nevertheless, the classics,
as shown elsewhere, often speak of giant skeletons still excavated
in their day. Besides this, human fossils may be counted on the
fingers, as yet. No skeleton ever yet found is older than between
50, or 60,000 years,*** and man's size was reduced from 15 to
10 or 12 feet, ever since the third sub-race of the Aryan stock,
which sub-race -- born and developed in Europe and Asia Minor
under new climates and conditions -- had become European. Since
then, as said, it has steadily been decreasing. It is truer therefore
to say, that the tombs alone are archaic, and not necessarily
the bodies of men occasionally found in them; and that those tombs,
since they are gigantic, must have contained giants,**** or rather
the ashes of generations of giants.

of a heap of stones, over which the form has been moulded in fine

in the act of swallowing an egg of which the diameter is 100 ft.
in the thickest part; the body of the animal is wound in graceful
curves and the tail is rolled into a spiral. The entire length
of the animal is 1,100 ft. This work is unique . . . . and there

Nor were all such cyclopean structures intended for sepulchres.
It is with the so-called Druidical remains, such as Carnac in
Brittany and Stonehenge in Great Britain, that the travelling
Initiates above alluded to had to do. And these gigantic monuments
are all symbolic records of the World's history. They are <I>not</I>
Druidical, but <I>universal. </I>Nor did the Druids build them,
for they were only the heirs to the cyclopean lore left to them
by generations of mighty builders and -- &quot;magicians,&quot;
both good and bad.
<P>
It will always be a subject of regret that history, rejecting
<I>a priori </I>the actual existence of giants, has preserved
us so little of the records of antiquity concerning them. Yet
in nearly every mythology -- which after all<I> is </I>ancient
history -- the giants play an important part. In the old Norse
mythology, the giants, Skrymir and his brethren, against whom
the sons of the gods fought, were potent factors in the histories
of deities and men. The modern exegesis, that makes these giants
to be the brethren of the dwarfs, and reduces the combats of the
gods to the history of the development of the Aryan race, will
only receive credence amongst the believers in the Aryan theory,
as expounded by Max Muller. Granting that the Turanian races were
typified by the dwarfs (Dwergar), and that a dark, round-headed,
and dwarfish race was driven northward by the fair-faced Scandinavians,
or AEsir, the gods being like unto men, there still exists neither
in history nor any other scientific work any anthropological proof
whatever of the existence in time or space of a race of giants.
Yet that such exist, relatively and <I>de facto </I>side by side
with dwarfs, Schweinfurth can testify. The <I>Nyam-Nyam </I>of
Africa are regular dwarfs, while their next neighbours (several
tribes of comparatively fair-complexioned Africans) are giants
when confronted with the Nyam-Nyams, and very tall even among
Europeans, for their women are all above 6 1/2 feet high. (<I>Vide</I>
Schweinfurth's latest works.)
<P>
In Cornwall and in ancient Britain the traditions of these giants
are, on the other hand, excessively common; they are said to live
even down to the time of King Arthur. All this shows that giants
lived to a later date amongst the Celtic than among the Teutonic
peoples.
<P>
If we turn to the New World, we have traditions of a race of giants
at Tarija on the eastern slopes of the Andes and in Ecuador, who
combated gods and men. These old beliefs, which term certain localities
&quot;<I>Los campos de los gigantes</I>&quot;<I> -- </I>&quot;the
fields of giants,&quot; are always concomitant with the existence
of pliocene mammalia and the occurrence of pliocene raised beaches.
&quot;All the giants are not under Mount Ossa,&quot; and it would
be poor anthropology indeed that would restrict the traditions
of giants to Greek and Bible mythologies. Slavonian countries,
Russia especially, teem with legends about the <I>bogaterey </I>(mighty
giants)<HR>

<P>
of old; and their folklore, most of which has served for the foundation
of national histories, their oldest songs, and their most archaic
traditions, speak of the giants of old. Thus we may safely reject
the modern theory that would make of the Titans mere symbols standing
for cosmic forces. They were real living men, whether twenty or
only twelve feet high. Even the Homeric heroes, who, of course,
belonged to a far more recent period in the history of the races,
appear to have wielded weapons of a size and weight beyond the
strength of the strongest men of modern times.

&quot;Not twice ten men the mighty bulk could raise,<BR>
Such men as live in these degenerate days.&quot;

<P>
If the fossil footprints from Carson, Indiana, <STRONG>U.S.A.</STRONG>,
are human, they indicate gigantic men. Of their genuineness there
can remain no doubt. It is to be deplored that the modem and <I>scientific
</I>evidence for gigantic men should rest on footprints alone.
Over and over again, the skeletons of hypothetical giants have
been identified with those of elephants and mastodons. But all
such blunders before the days of geology, and even the traveller's
tales of Sir John Mandeville, who says that <I>he saw giants 56
feet high, </I>in India, only show that belief in the existence
of giants has never, at any time, died out of the thoughts of
men.
<P>
That which is known and accepted is, that several races of gigantic
men have existed and left distinct traces. In the journal of the
Anthropological Institute (Vol. 1871, art. by Dr. C. Carter Blake)
such a race is shown as having existed at Palmyra and possibly
in Midian, exhibiting cranial forms quite different from those
of the Jews. It is not improbable that another such race existed
in Samaria, and that the mysterious people who built the stone
circles in Galilee, hewed neolithic flints in the Jordan valley
and preserved an ancient Semitic language quite distinct from
the square Hebrew character -- was of a very large stature. The
English translations of the Bible can never be relied upon, even
in their modern <I>revised </I>forms. They tell us of the<I> Nephilim
</I>translating the word by &quot;giants,&quot; and further adding
that they were &quot;hairy&quot; men, probably the large and powerful
prototypes of the later satyrs so eloquently described by the
patristic fancy; some of the Church Fathers assuring their admirers
and followers that they had themselves seen these &quot;Satyrs&quot;
-- some alive, others pickled and preserved. The word &quot;giants&quot;
being once adopted as a synonym of <I>Nephilim, </I>the commentators
have since identified them with the sons of Anak. The filibusters
who seized on the Promised Land, found a pre-existing population
far exceeding their own in stature, and called it a race of giants.
But the races of really gigantic men had disappeared ages before
the birth of Moses. This tall people existed in Canaan, and<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 756 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
even in Bashan, and may have had representatives in the Nabatheans
of Midian. They were of far greater stature than the undersized
Jews. Four thousand years ago their cranial conformation and large
stature separated them from the children of Heber. Forty thousand
years ago their ancestors may have been of still more gigantic
size, and four hundred thousand years earlier <I>they must have
been </I>in proportion to men in our days as the Brobdingnagians
were to the Lilliputians. The Atlanteans of the middle period
were called the Great Dragons, and the first symbol of their tribal
deities, when the &quot;gods&quot; and the Divine Dynasties had
forsaken them, was that of a giant Serpent.
<P>
The mystery veiling the origin and the religion of the Druids,
is as great as that of their supposed fanes is to the modern Symbologist,
but not to the initiated Occultists. Their priests were the descendants
of the last Atlanteans, and what is known of them is sufficient
to allow the inference that they were eastern priests akin to
the Chaldeans and Indians, though little more. It may be inferred
that they symbolized their deity as the Hindus do their Vishnu,
as the Egyptians did their <I>Mystery God, </I>and as the builders
of the Ohio Great-Serpent mound worshipped theirs -- namely under
the form of the &quot;mighty Serpent,&quot; the emblem of the
eternal deity <B>T</B>IME (the Hindu Kala). Pliny called them
the &quot;Magi of the Gauls and Britons.&quot; But they were more
than that. The author of &quot;<I>Indian Antiquities</I>&quot;<I>
</I>finds much affinity between the Druids and the Brahmins of
India. Dr. Borlase points to a close analogy between them and
the Magi of Persia*; others will see an identity between them
and the Orphic priesthood of Thrace: simply because they were
connected, in their esoteric teachings, with the universal Wisdom
Religion, and thus presented affinities with the exoteric worship
of all.
<P>
Like the Hindus, the Greeks and Romans (we speak of the Initiates),
the Chaldees and the Egyptians, the Druids believed in the doctrine
of a succession of worlds, as also in that of seven &quot;creations&quot;
(of new continents) and transformations of the face of the earth,
and in a seven-fold night and day for each earth or globe (<I>See
</I>&quot;<I>Esoteric Buddhism</I>&quot;)<I>. </I>Wherever the
Serpent with the egg is found, there this tenet was surely present.
Their <I>Dracontia </I>are a proof of it. This belief was so universal
that, if we seek for it in the esotericism of various religions,
we shall discover it in all. We shall find it among the Aryan
Hindus and Mazdeans, the Greeks, the Latins, and even among the
old Jews and early Christians, whose modern stocks

hardly comprehend now that which they read in their Scriptures.
See what Seneca says in <I>Epistle </I>9, and Quaest. Nat. <STRONG>III</STRONG>.,
c., ult.: &quot;The world being melted and having re-entered the
bosom of Jupiter, this god continues for some time to remain absorbed
in himself and <I>concealed, </I>wholly immersed in contemplation.
After which a new world springs from him. . . . An innocent race
of men and animals are produced anew . . . etc.&quot; Then again
when speaking of periodical mundane dissolution involving universal
death, he (Seneca) says that &quot;when the laws of nature shall
be buried in ruin, and the last day of the world shall come, <I>the
southern pole shall crush, </I>as it falls, all the regions of
Africa, and the North pole shall overwhelm all the countries beneath
its axis. <I>The affrighted sun shall be deprived of its light</I>;<I>
</I>the palace of heaven falling to decay <I>shall produce at
once both </I>life and death, and some kind of dissolution shall
equally seize upon all deities, who thus shall return into their
original chaos&quot; (<I>Quoted in </I>&quot;<I>Book of God,</I>&quot;<I>
p. </I>160.)
<P>
One might imagine oneself reading the Puranic account by Parasara
of the great Pralaya. It is nearly the same thing, idea for idea.
Has Christianity nothing of the kind? It has, we say. Let the
reader open any English Bible and read chapter iii. of the <I>Second
</I>Epistle of Peter, from verse iii. till the xivth, and he will
find there the same ideas. . . . &quot;There shall come in the
last days scoffers . . . saying, 'where is the promise of his
coming? . . . . Since the fathers fell asleep all things continue
as they were from the beginning of creation.' For, they are ignorant
. . . . that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and <I>the
earth standing out of the water and in the water</I>:<I> whereby
the world that then was, being overflowed with water, </I>perished.
But the heavens and the earth <I>that are now, </I>are reserved
unto the fire . . . . wherein the heavens . . . . shall be dissolved,
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat . . . . we nevertheless
look for <I>new</I> <I>heavens and new earth, etc., etc.</I>&quot;<I>
</I>If the interpreters chose to see in this a reference to creation,
the deluge, and the promised coming of Christ, when they will
live in a new Jerusalem in heaven, this is no fault of &quot;Peter.&quot;
What the writer of the Epistles meant was the destruction of this
Fifth Race of ours by subterranean fires and inundations, and
the appearance of new continents for the Sixth Root-Race. For
the writers of these Epistles were all learned in symbology if
not in the sciences.
<P>
It was mentioned elsewhere that the belief in the septenary constitution
of our &quot;chain&quot; was the oldest tenet of the early Iranians,
who got it from the first Zarathustra. It is time to prove it
to those Parsis who have lost the key to the meaning of their
Scriptures. In the Avesta the earth is considered septempartite
and tripartite at one and the same time. This is regarded by Dr.
Geiger, as an <I>incongruity, </I>for<I> </I>the following reasons,
which he calls discrepancies: the Avesta speaks<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 758 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
of the three-thirds of the earth because the Rig-Veda mentions
&quot;three earths.&quot; . . . . &quot;Three strata or layers,
one lying above the other, are said to be meant by this.&quot;*
But he is quite mistaken, as are all exoteric profane translators.
The Avesta has not borrowed the idea from the <I>Rig-Veda, </I>but
simply repeats the esoteric teaching. The &quot;three strata or
layers&quot; do not refer to our globe alone, but to three layers
of the globes of our terrestrial chain -- two by two, on each
plane, one on the descending, the other on the ascending arc.
Thus, with reference to the six spheres or globes above our earth,
the seventh and the fourth, it is <I>septempartite, </I>while
with regard to the planes over our plane -- it is <I>tripartite.
</I>This meaning is carried out and corroborated by the text in
the Avesta and Vendidad, and even by the speculations -- a most
laborious and unsatisfactory guess-work -- of the translators
and commentators. It thus follows that the division of the &quot;earth,&quot;
or rather the earth's chain, into seven <I>Karshvars </I>is not
in contradiction with the three &quot;zones,&quot; if this word
is read &quot;planes.&quot; As Geiger remarks, this septenary
division is very old -- the oldest of all -- since the Gathas
already speak of the &quot;septempartite earth.&quot; (<I>Bumi
haptaiti, Yasna, </I>xxxii., 3.) For, &quot;according to the Parsee
Scriptures, the <I>seven Karshvars are to be considered as completely
disconnected parts of the earth,</I>&quot;<I> </I>which they surely
are. For, &quot;between them <I>there flows the Ocean, </I>so
that it is impossible, as stated in several passages, to pass
from one Karshvar to another.&quot;** The &quot;Ocean&quot; is
<I>space, </I>of course, for the latter was called &quot;Waters
of Space&quot; before it was known as Ether. Moreover, the word
<I>Karshvar </I>is consistently rendered by <I>Dwipa, </I>and
especially <I>Qaniratha </I>by Jambudwipa (&quot;Neriosengh, the
translator of the Yasna.&quot;)*** But this fact is not taken
into account by the Orientalists, and therefore we find even such
a learned Zoroastrian and Parsi by birth as the translator of
Dr. Geiger's work passing unnoticed and without a word of comment
sundry remarks of the former on the &quot;incongruities&quot;
of this kind abounding in the Mazdean Scriptures. One of such
&quot;incongruities&quot; and &quot;coincidences&quot; concerns
the similarity of the Zoroastrian with the Indian tenet with regard
to the seven <I>Dwipas </I>(islands, or continents, rather) as
met with in the <I>Puranas, </I>namely: &quot;The Dwipas form
concentric rings, which, separated by the ocean, surround Jambu
Dvipa, which is situated in the centre&quot; (p. 130, vol. I.),
and, &quot;according to the Iranian view, the <I>Karshvar Qaniratha
</I>is likewise situated in the centre of the rest . . . . each
of them (the other six <I>Karshvars</I>)<I> </I>is a

other names do not mean &quot;the adjacent territories of foreign
nations in the North, South, West, and East&quot; (p. 132), but
our globe or Earth. For that which is meant by the sentence which
follows the last quoted, namely, that &quot;two <I>Vorubarshti
</I>and<I> Voru-Zarshti </I>lie in the North; two, <I>Vidadhafshu</I>
and<I> Tradadhafshu, </I>in the South; <I>Savahi</I> and<I> Arzahi
</I>in the East and West,&quot; is simply the very graphic and
accurate description of the &quot;chain&quot; of our planet, the
Earth, represented in the book of Dzyan (11) thus:

The Mazdean names given above have only to be replaced by those
used in the Secret Doctrine to become an orthodox tenet. The &quot;Earth&quot;
(our World), therefore, <I>is</I> &quot;tripartite,&quot; because
the chain of the worlds is situated on three different <I>planes
</I>above our globe; and it is <I>septempartite </I>because of
the seven globes or spheres which compose the chain. Hence the
further meaning given in Vendidad <STRONG>XIX</STRONG>. 39, showing
that &quot;<I>Qaniratha </I>alone is combined with <I>imat, </I>'this'
(earth), while all other <I>Karshvares </I>are combined with the
word '<I>avat</I>,' 'that' or<I> those -- </I>upper earths.&quot;
Nothing could be plainer.
<P>
The same may be said of the modern comprehension of all other
ancient beliefs.

The Druids understood the meaning of the Sun in Taurus, therefore,
when, while all the fires were extinguished on the 1st of November,
their sacred and inextinguishable fires alone remained to illumine
the horizon, like those of the Magi and the modern Zoroastrians.
And like the early Fifth Race and later Chaldees, the Greeks,
and again like the Christians, who do the same to this day, without
suspecting the real meaning, they greeted the Morning Star --
the beautiful Venus-Lucifer.*

* Dr. Kenealy quotes, in his &quot;Book of God,&quot; Vallancey,
who says &quot;I had not been a week landed in Ireland from Gibraltar,
where I had studied Hebrew and Chaldaic under Jews of various
countries, when I heard a peasant girl say to boor standing by
her<I> </I>&quot;<I>Teach an Maddin Nag</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Behold
the morning star), pointing to the planet Venus, the <I>Maddena
Nag of </I>the Chaldeans.&quot;<HR>

Strabo speaks of an island near to Britannia, &quot;where Ceres
and Persephone were worshipped with the same rites as in Samothrace
(lib. iv.) and this island was Sacred Ierna,&quot; where a perpetual
fire was lit. The Druids believed in the rebirth of man, not as
Lucian explains: &quot;that the same <I>spirit </I>shall animate
a new body, not here, but in a different world,&quot; but in a
series of re-incarnations in this same world; for as Diodorus
says, they declared that the souls of men, after determinate periods,
would pass into other bodies.*
<P>
These tenets came to the Fifth Race Aryans from their predecessors
of the Fourth Race, the Atlanteans. They had piously preserved
the teachings, which told them how their parent Root-Race, becoming
with every generation more arrogant, owing to the acquisition
of superhuman powers, had been gradually gliding toward its end.
Those records reminded them of the giant intellect of the preceding
races as well as of their giant size. One finds the repetition
of those records in every age of history, in almost every old
fragment which has descended to us from antiquity.
<P>
AElian preserved an extract from Theophrastus written during the
days of Alexander the Great. It is a dialogue between Midas, the
Phrygian, and Silenus. The former is told of a continent that
had existed in times of old, so immense, that Asia, Europe and
Africa seemed like poor islands compared with it. <I>It was the
last to produce </I>animals and plants of gigantic magnitudes.
There, said Silenus, men grew to double the size of the tallest
man in his (the narrator's) time, and they lived to twice as old
an age. They had wealthy cities with temples, and one of such
(cities) held more than a million of inhabitants in it, gold and
silver being found there in great abundance. . . .
<P>
Grote's suggestion that Atlantis was but a myth arisen from a
mirage -- clouds on a dazzling sky taking the appearance of islands
on a golden sea -- is too disingenuous to be even noticed.

* There was a time when the whole world, the totality of mankind,
had one religion, and when they were of &quot;one lip.&quot; &quot;All
the religions of the Earth were at first One and emanated from
<I>one</I> centre,&quot; says Faber very truly.
