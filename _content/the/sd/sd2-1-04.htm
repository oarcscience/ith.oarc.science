<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) Here tradition falls again into the Universal. As
in the earliest version, repeated in the Puranas, so in the latest,
the Mosaic account. In the first it is said: &quot;He the Lord&quot;
(the god who has the form of Brahma) &quot;when the world had
become one ocean (<EM>Harivamsa I. </EM>36) concluding that within
the waters lay the earth, and desirous to raise it up,&quot; to
separate it, &quot;created himself in another form. As in the
preceding Kalpa (Manvantara) he had assumed the shape of a tortoise,
so in this one he took the shape of a boar, etc. etc.&quot; In
the Elohistic &quot;creation&quot; (<EM>Genesis, </EM>verses 6,
7, 8, and 9) &quot;God&quot; creates a firmament in the midst
of the waters . . . . . and says &quot;let <EM>dry land </EM>appear.&quot;
And now comes the traditional peg whereunto is hung the esoteric
portion of the Kabalistic interpretation.
<P>
11.. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE GREAT CHOHANS (<EM>Lords</EM>)<EM>,

<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) Who are the Lords of the Moon? In India they are
called <EM>Pitris </EM>or &quot;lunar ancestors,&quot; but in
the Hebrew scrolls it is Jehovah himself who is the &quot;Lord
of the Moon,&quot; collectively as the Host, and also as one of
the Elohim. The astronomy of the Hebrews and their observance
of<EM> times </EM>was regulated by the moon. A Kabalist, having
shown that &quot;Daniel . . . told off God's providence by <EM>set
times,&quot; </EM>and that the &quot;Revelation&quot; of John
&quot;speaks of a carefully measured <EM>cubical </EM>city descending
out of the heavens,&quot; etc., adds --<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 76 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
&quot;But the vitalizing power of heaven lay chiefly <EM>with
the moon</EM>. . . . It was the Hebrew <IMG SRC="sd1-355b.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
(Jehovah), and St. Paul enjoins: 'Let no man judge you for your
observance of the seventh day, and the <EM>day of the new moon,
which are a shadow of things to come; </EM>but the body (or substance)
is of Christ&quot; or Jehovah, that function of this power that
&quot;made the barren woman . . . a mother . . . for they are
the gift of Jehovah&quot; . . . which is a key to the objection
which her husband made to the Shunamite, as to her going to the
man of God -- &quot;for it is neither the seventh day nor the
<EM>day of the new moon. .</EM> . . (2<EM> Kings</EM>, iv., 23.)
The living spiritual powers of the constellations had mighty wars,
marked by the movements and positions of the stars and planets,
and especially as the result of the conjunction of the moon, earth,
and sun. Bentley comments on the Hindu &quot;War between the gods
and the giants,&quot; as marked by the eclipse of the Sun at the
ascending node of the Moon, 945 <B>B.C</B>. (! !), at which time
was born* or produced from the sea, <STRONG>S</STRONG>RI (Sarai,
S-r-i, the wife of the Hebrew A-bram**). Sri is also Venus-Aphrodite
the Western emblem &quot;of the luni-solar year or the moon (as
Sri is the wife of the moon; <EM>vide</EM> foot-note), the goddess
of increase*** . . . &quot; Therefore . . . &quot;the grand monument
and landmark of the exact period of the lunar year and month,
by which this cycle (of 19 tropical years and 235 revolutions
of the moon) could be calculated, was Mount Sinai -- the Lord
Jehovah coming down thereon. . . . Paul speaks (then) as a mystagogue,
when he says concerning the freed woman and bond woman of Abraham:
'For this Hagar (the bond-woman) is Mount Sinai in Arabia.' How
could a woman be a mountain? and such a mountain! Yet . . . she
was. . . . Her name was Hagar, Hebrew <IMG SRC="sd2-76.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,
whose numbers re-read 235, or in exact measure, the very number
of lunar months to equal nineteen tropical years to complete this
cycle. . . . Mount Sinai being, in the esoteric language of the
wisdom, the monument of the exact time of the lunar

* According to the wonderful chronology of Bentley, who wrote
in days when Biblical chronology was still undisputed; and also
according to that of those modern Orientalists who dwarf the Hindu
dates as far as they can.
<P>
** Now <EM>Sri </EM>is the daughter of Bhrigu, one of the Prajapatis
and Rishis, the chief of the Bhrigus, &quot;the Consumers,&quot;
the aerial class of gods. She is Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu,
and she is &quot;the bride of Siva&quot; (Gauri), and she is Sarasvati,
&quot;the watery,&quot; the wife of Brahma, because the three
gods and goddesses are one, under three aspects. Read the explanation
by Parasara, in <EM>Vishnu Purana</EM> in Bk. I., ch. viii. (Vol.
I., Wilson's trans., p. 119), and you will understand. &quot;The
Lord of Sri&quot; is the moon, he says, and &quot;Sri is the wife
of Narayana, the God of Gods&quot;; Sri or Lakshmi (Venus) is
Indrani, as she is Sarasvati, for in the words of Parasara: &quot;Hari
(or Iswara, &quot;the Lord&quot;) is all that is called male in
the Universe; Lakshmi is all that is termed female. There is nothing
else than they.&quot; Hence she is &quot;female,&quot; and &quot;God&quot;
is male Nature.
<P>
*** Sri is goddess of, and herself &quot;Fortune and Prosperity.&quot;

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 77 THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF CREATORS.</H6>

<P>
years and months, by which this spiritual vitalizing cycle could
be computed -- and which mountain, indeed, was called (see Fuerst),
&quot;the Mountain of the Moon (Sin). So also Sarai (<STRONG>SRI</STRONG>),
the wife of Abram, could have no child until her name was changed
to Sarah, <IMG SRC="sd2-77.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">, giving to her
the property of this lunar influence.&quot;*
<P>
This may be regarded as a digression from the main subject; but
it is a very necessary one with a view to Christian readers. For
who, after studying dispassionately the respective legends of
Abram or Abraham, Sarai or Sarah, who was &quot;fair to look upon,&quot;
and those of Brahma and Sarasvati, or Sri, Lakshmi-Venus, with
the relations of all these to the Moon and Water; -- and especially
one who understands the real Kabalistic meaning of the name Jehovah
and its relation to, and connection with, the moon -- who can
doubt that the story of Abram is based upon that of Brahma, or
that Genesis was written upon the old lines used by every ancient
nation? All in the ancient Scriptures is allegorical -- all based
upon and inseparably connected with Astronomy and Cosmolatry.

13. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HEY (<EM>the Moon-gods</EM>)<EM> </EM>WENT,
EACH ON HIS ALLOTTED LAND: SEVEN OF THEM, EACH ON HIS LOT. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE
<STRONG>L</STRONG>ORDS OF THE <STRONG>F</STRONG>LAME REMAINED
BEHIND. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HEY WOULD NOT GO, THEY WOULD NOT CREATE
(<EM>a</EM>).
<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) The Secret teachings show the divine Progenitors
creating men on seven portions of the globe &quot;each on his
lot&quot; -- <EM>i.e.</EM>, each a different race of men externally
and internally, and on different zones. This polygenistic claim
is considered elsewhere (<EM>vide</EM> Stanza <STRONG>VII.</STRONG>).
But who are &quot;They&quot; who create, and the &quot;Lords of
the Flame,&quot; &quot;who do not&quot;? Occultism divides the
&quot;Creators&quot; into twelve classes; of which four have reached
<EM>liberation </EM>to the end of the &quot;Great Age,&quot; the
fifth is ready to reach it, but still remains active on the intellectual
planes, while seven are still under direct Karmic law. These last
act on the man-bearing globes of our chain.
<P>
Exoteric Hindu books mention seven classes of Pitris, and among
them two distinct kinds of Progenitors or Ancestors: the <EM>Barhishad</EM>
and the<EM> Agnishwatta; </EM>or those possessed of the &quot;sacred
fire&quot; and those devoid of it. Hindu ritualism seems to connect
them with sacrificial fires, and with <EM>Grihasta </EM>Brahmins
in earlier incarnations: those who have, and those who have <B>not
</B>attended as they should to their household sacred fires in
their previous births. The distinction, as said, is derived from
the<EM> Vedas. </EM>The first and highest class (esoterically)
the <EM>Agnishwatta,</EM>

<P>
are represented in the exoteric allegory as <EM>Grihasta </EM>(Brahman-householders)
who, in their past births in other Manvantaras having failed to
maintain their domestic fires and to offer burnt sacrifices, have
lost every right to have oblations with fire presented to them.
Whereas the Barhishad, being Brahmins who have kept up their household
sacred fires, are thus honoured to this day. Thence the <EM>Agnishwatta
</EM>are represented as devoid of, and the <EM>Barhishad </EM>as
possessed of, fires.
<P>
But esoteric philosophy explains the original qualifications as
being due to the difference between the natures of the two classes:
the <EM>Agnishwatta </EM>Pitris are devoid of fire (<EM>i.e.</EM>,
of creative passion), because too divine and pure (<EM>vide supra,
</EM>Sloka 11th); whereas the Barhishad, being the lunar spirits
more closely connected with Earth, became the creative Elohim
of form, or the Adam of dust.
<P>
The allegory says that Sanandana and other <EM>Vedhas, </EM>the
Sons of Brahma, <EM>his first progeny, </EM>&quot;were without
desire or passion, inspired with the holy wisdom, estranged from
the Universe and <EM>undesirous of progeny&quot; </EM>(<EM>Vishnu
Purana, </EM>Book I. vii.). This also is what is meant in Sloka
11 by the words: &quot;They would not create,&quot; and is explained
as follows: -- &quot;The primordial Emanations from the creative
Power are too near the absolute Cause. They are transitional and
latent forces, which will develop only in the next and subsequent
removes.&quot; This makes it plain. Hence Brahma is said to have
felt wrathful when he saw that those &quot;embodied spirits, produced
from his limbs (<EM>gatra</EM>), would not multiply themselves.&quot;
After which, in the allegory, he creates other seven <EM>mind-born
</EM>Sons (see <EM>&quot;Moksha-Darma&quot; </EM>and<EM> &quot;Mahabharata&quot;</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>namely<EM>, Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu</EM>
and<EM> Vasishta, </EM>the latter being often replaced by <EM>Daksha,
</EM>the most prolific of the creators. In most of the texts these
Seven Sons of <EM>Vasishta-Daksha </EM>are called the seven Rishis
of the <EM>Third</EM> Manvantara; the latter referring both to
the Third Round and also to the third Root-Race and its branch-Races
in the Fourth Round. These are all the creators of the various
beings on this Earth, the Prajapati, and at the same time they
appear as divers reincarnations in the early Manvantaras or races.
<P>
It thus becomes clear why the <EM>Agnishwatta, </EM>devoid of
the grosser <EM>creative fire, </EM>hence unable to create physical
man, having no <EM>double, </EM>or astral body, to project, since
they were without any <EM>form</EM>, are shown in exoteric allegories
as Yogis, Kumaras (chaste youths), who became &quot;rebels,&quot;
<EM>Asuras, </EM>fighting and opposing gods,* etc., etc. Yet it
is they
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Because, as the allegory shows, the Gods who had no personal
merit of their own, dreading the sanctity of those self-striving
incarnated Beings who had become <EM>ascetics </EM>and Yogis,
and thus threatened to upset the power of the former by their
<EM>self-acquired </EM>powers -- renounced them. All this has
a deep philosophical meaning and refers to the evolution and acquirement
of divine powers through <EM>self-exertion. </EM>Some Rishi- [[Footnote
continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 79 THE LIVING SPIRITUAL FIRE.</H6>

<P>
alone who could complete man, <EM>i.e.</EM>, make of him a self-conscious,
almost a divine being -- god on Earth. The <EM>Barhishad, </EM>though
possessed of creative fire, were devoid of the higher <STRONG>M</STRONG>AHAT-mic
element. Being on a level with the lower principles -- those which
precede gross objective matter -- they could only give birth to
the outer man, or rather to the model of the physical, the astral
man. Thus, though we see them intrusted with the task by Brahma
(the collective <EM>Mahat </EM>or Universal Divine Mind), the
&quot;Mystery of Creation&quot; is repeated on Earth, only in
an inverted sense, as in a <EM>mirror. </EM>It is those who are
unable to create the spiritual immortal man, who project the senseless
model (the <EM>Astral</EM>)<EM> </EM>of the physical Being; and,
as will be seen, it was those who would not multiply, who sacrificed
themselves to the good and salvation of <EM>Spiritual Humanity.
</EM>For, to complete the <EM>septenary man, </EM>to add to his
three lower principles and cement them with the spiritual Monad
-- which could never dwell in such a form otherwise than in an
<EM>absolutely latent state</EM> -- two<EM> </EM>connecting principles
are needed: <EM>Manas </EM>and<EM> Kama. </EM>This requires a
living <EM>Spiritual Fire </EM>of the middle principle from the
<EM>fifth</EM> and<EM> third states </EM>of Pleroma. But this
fire is the possession of the <EM>Triangles, </EM>not of the (perfect)
<EM>Cubes, </EM>which symbolize the Angelic Beings:* the former
having from the first creation got hold of it and being said to
have appropriated it for themselves, as in the allegory of Prometheus.
These are the active, and therefore -- in Heaven -- no longer
&quot;pure&quot; Beings. They have become the independent and
free Intelligences, shown in every Theogony as fighting for that
independence and freedom, and hence -- in the ordinary sense --
&quot;rebellious to the divine passive law.&quot; These are then
those &quot;Flames&quot; (the <EM>Agnishwatta</EM>)<EM> </EM>who,
as shown in Sloka 13, &quot;remain behind&quot; instead of going
along with the others to create men on Earth. But the true esoteric
meaning is that most of them were destined to incarnate as the
<EM>Egos </EM>of the forthcoming crop of Mankind. The human <EM>Ego
</EM>is neither Atman nor Buddhi, but the higher <EM>Manas: </EM>the
intellectual fruition and the efflorescence of the intellectual
self-conscious <EM>Egotism</EM> -- in<EM> </EM>the higher spiritual
sense. The ancient works refer to it as <EM>Karana Sarira </EM>on
the plane of <EM>Sutratma, </EM>which is the golden thread on
which, like beads, the various personalities of this higher <EM>Ego</EM>
are strung. If the reader were told, as in the<EM> semi-esoteric
</EM>allegories, that these Beings were returning <EM>Nirvanees,
</EM>from preceding <EM>Maha-Manvantaras --</EM> ages<EM> </EM>of
incalculable dura-

</H6>

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Yogis are shown in the
Puranas to be far more powerful than the gods. Secondary gods
or temporary powers in Nature (the Forces) are doomed to disappear;
it is only the spiritual potentiality in man which can lead him
to become one with the INFINITE and the ABSOLUTE.
<P>

<P>
tion which have rolled away in the Eternity, a still more incalculable
time ago -- he would hardly understand the text correctly; while
some Vedantins might say: &quot;This is not so; the Nirvanee can
never return&quot;; which is true during the Manvantara he belongs
to, and erroneous where Eternity is concerned. For it is said
in the Sacred Slokas:
<P>
<EM>&quot;The thread of radiance which is imperishable and dissolves
only in Nirvana, re-emerges from it in its integrity on the day
when the Great Law calls all things back into action</EM>. . .
.&quot;
<P>
Hence, as the higher &quot;Pitris or Dhyanis&quot; had no hand
in his physical creation, we find primeval man, issued from the
bodies of his <EM>spiritually fireless </EM>progenitors, described
as aeriform, devoid of compactness, and <STRONG>M</STRONG>INDLESS.
He had no middle principle to serve him as a medium between the
<EM>highest </EM>and the <EM>lowest, </EM>the spiritual man and
the physical brain, for he lacked <EM>Manas. </EM>The Monads which
incarnated in those empty <STRONG>S</STRONG>HELLS, remained as
unconscious as when separated from their previous incomplete forms
and vehicles. There is no potentiality for creation, or self-Consciousness,
in a <EM>pure</EM> Spirit on this our plane, unless its too homogeneous,
perfect, because divine, nature is, so to say, mixed with, and
strengthened by, an essence already differentiated. It is only
the lower line of the Triangle -- representing the first triad
that emanates from the Universal <STRONG>M</STRONG>ONAD -- that
can furnish this needed consciousness on the plane of differentiated
Nature. But how could these pure Emanations, which, on this principle,
must have originally been themselves<EM> unconscious </EM>(in
our sense), be of any use in supplying the required principle,
as they could hardly have possessed it themselves? The answer
is difficult to comprehend, unless one is well acquainted with
the philosophical metaphysics of a beginningless and endless series
of Cosmic Re-births; and becomes well impressed and familiarised
with that immutable law of Nature which is <STRONG>E</STRONG>TERNAL
<STRONG>M</STRONG>OTION, cyclic and spiral, therefore progressive
even in its seeming retrogression. The one divine Principle, the
nameless <STRONG>T</STRONG>HAT of the Vedas, is the universal
Total, which, neither in its spiritual aspects and emanations,
nor in its physical atoms, can ever be at <EM>&quot;absolute rest&quot;
</EM>except during the &quot;Nights&quot; of Brahma. Hence, also,
the &quot;first-born&quot; are those who are first set in motion
at the beginning of a Manvantara, and thus the first to fall into
the lower spheres of materiality. They who are called in Theology
&quot;the Thrones,&quot; and are the &quot;Seat of God,&quot;
must be the first incarnated men on Earth; and it becomes comprehensible,
if we think of the endless series of past Manvantaras, to find
that the last had to come first, and the first last. We find,
in short, that the higher Angels had broken, countless aeons before,
through the &quot;Seven Circles,&quot; and thus <EM>robbed </EM>them
of the Sacred fire;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 81 MAN, A GOD IN ANIMAL FORM.</H6>

<P>
which means in plain words, that they had assimilated during their
past incarnations, in lower as well as in higher worlds, all the
wisdom therefrom -- the reflection of <STRONG>M</STRONG>AHAT in
its various degrees of intensity. No Entity, whether angelic or
human, can reach the state of Nirvana, or of absolute purity,
except through aeons of suffering and the <EM>knowledge </EM>of<EM>
</EM>EVIL as well as of good, as otherwise the latter remains
incomprehensible.
<P>
Between man and the animal -- whose Monads (or Jivas) are fundamentally
identical -- there is the impassable abyss of Mentality and Self-consciousness.
What is human mind in its higher aspect, whence comes it, if it
is not a portion of the essence -- and, in some rare cases of
incarnation, the <EM>very essence </EM>-<EM>- </EM>of a higher
Being: one from a higher and divine plane? Can man -- a god in
the animal form -- be the product of Material Nature by evolution
alone, even as is the animal, which differs from man in external
shape, but by no means in the materials of its physical fabric,
and is informed by the same, though undeveloped, Monad -- seeing
that the intellectual potentialities of the two differ as the
Sun does from the Glow-worm? And what is it that creates such
difference, unless man is an animal <EM>plus</EM> <EM>a living
god </EM>within his physical shell? Let us pause and ask ourselves
seriously the question, regardless of the vagaries and sophisms
of both the materialistic and the psychological modern sciences.
<P>
To some extent, it is admitted that even the esoteric teaching
is allegorical. To make the latter comprehensible to the average
intelligence, requires the use of symbols cast in an intelligible
form. Hence the allegorical and semi-mythical narratives in the
exoteric, and the (only) <EM>semi</EM>-metaphysical and objective
representations in the esoteric teachings. For the purely and
transcendentally spiritual conceptions are adapted only to the
perceptions of those who &quot;see without eyes, hear without
ears, and sense without organs,&quot; according to the graphic
expression of the Commentary. The too puritan idealist is at liberty
to spiritualise the tenet, whereas the modern psychologist would
simply try to spirit away our &quot;fallen,&quot; yet still divine,
human Soul in its connection with <EM>Buddhi.</EM> 
<P>
The mystery attached to the highly spiritual ancestors of the
<EM>divine </EM>man within the earthly man is very great. His
dual creation is hinted at in the Puranas, though its esoteric
meaning can be approached only by collating together the many
varying accounts, and reading them in their symbolical and allegorical
character. So it is in the Bible, both in <EM>Genesis </EM>and
even in the <EM>Epistles </EM>of Paul. For that <EM>creator, </EM>who
is called in the second chapter of Genesis the &quot;Lord God,&quot;
is in the original the <EM>Elohim, </EM>or<EM> Gods </EM>(the
Lords), in the plural; and while one of them makes the earthly
Adam of dust, the other breathes into him the breath of life,
and the third makes of him a <EM>living soul </EM>(ii. 7), all
of which readings <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 82 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
are implied in the plural number of the Elohim.* &quot;The first
man is of the Earth, the second (the last, or rather highest)
is from heaven,&quot; says Paul in I. <EM>Corinthians </EM>xv.
47.
<P>
In the Aryan allegory the rebellious Sons of Brahma are all represented
as holy ascetics and Yogis. Re-born in every Kalpa, they generally
try to impede the work of human procreation. When Daksha, the
chief of the <EM>Prajapati </EM>(creators), brings forth 10,000
sons for the purpose of peopling the world, Narada -- a son of
Brahma, the great Rishi, and <EM>virtually </EM>a &quot;Kumara,&quot;
if not so in name -- interferes with, and twice frustrates Daksha's
aim, by persuading those Sons to remain holy ascetics and eschew
marriage. For this, Daksha curses Narada to be <EM>re-born as
a man, </EM>as Brahma had cursed him before for refusing to marry,
and obtain progeny, saying: -- &quot;Perish in thy present (<EM>Deva</EM>
or angelic) form and take up thy abode in the womb,&quot; <EM>i.e.</EM>,
become a man (<EM>Vayu Purana; Harivamsa, </EM>170). Notwithstanding
several conflicting versions of the same story, it is easy to
see that Narada belongs to that class of Brahma's, &quot;first-born,&quot;
who have all proven rebellious to the law of animal procreation,
for which they had to incarnate as <EM>men. </EM>Of all the Vedic
Rishis, Narada, as already shown, is the most incomprehensible,
because the most closely connected with the occult doctrines --
especially with the secret cycles and Kalpas (<EM>vide supra</EM>)<EM>.</EM>

<P>
Certain contradictory statements about this Sage have much distracted
the Orientalists. Thus he is shown as refusing positively to <EM>create
</EM>(have progeny), and even as calling his father Brahma &quot;a
false teacher&quot; for advising him to get married (<EM>&quot;Narada-Pancha-Ratra</EM>&quot;);
nevertheless, he is referred to as one of the Prajapati, &quot;progenitors&quot;!
In <EM>Naradiya Purana, </EM>he describes the laws and the duties
of the celibate adepts; and as these occult duties do not happen
to be found in the fragment of about 3,000 Stanzas in the possession
of European museums, the Brahmins are proclaimed liars;
<P>
the Orientalists forgetting that the <EM>Naradiya </EM>is credited
with containing 25,000 Stanzas, and that it is not very likely
that such <B>MSS.</B> should be found in the hands of the Hindu
profane, those who are ready to sell any precious olla for a red
pottage. Suffice it to say, that Narada is

* Seth, as Bunsen and others have shown, is not only the <EM>primitive
god </EM>of the Semites -- early Jews included -- but also their
&quot;semi-divine ancestor.&quot; For, says Bunsen (<EM>&quot;God
in History,&quot; </EM>vol. i, pp. 233, 234), &quot;the Seth of
Genesis, the father of Enoch (<EM>the</EM> man) must be considered
as originally running parallel with that derived from the Elohim,
Adam's father.&quot; &quot;According to Bunsen, the Deity (the
god Seth) was the <EM>primitive god </EM>of Northern Egypt and
Palestine&quot; (Staniland Wake, &quot;The Great Pyramid&quot;).
And Seth became considered in the later Theology of the Egyptians
as &quot;AN EVIL DAEMON,&quot; says the same Bunsen, for he is
one with Typhon and one with the Hindu demons as a logical sequel.

final stage. He is an actor who appears in each of the successive
acts (Root-Races) of the present Manvantaric drama, in the world
allegories which strike the key-note of esotericism, and are now
becoming more familiar to the reader. But shall we turn to other
ancient Scriptures and documents for the corroboration of the
&quot;Fires,&quot; &quot;Sparks,&quot; and &quot;Flames?&quot;
They are plentiful, if one only seeks for them in the right places.
In the <EM>&quot;Book of the Concealed Mystery,&quot; </EM>they
are clearly enunciated, as also in the <EM>&quot;Ha Idra Zuta
Qadisha,&quot; </EM>or the lesser holy Assembly. The language
is very mystical and veiled, yet still comprehensible. Therein,
among the sparks of Prior Worlds, &quot;vibrating Flames and Sparks,&quot;
from the divine flint, the <EM>workmen </EM>proceed to create
man, &quot;male and female&quot; (427); which &quot;Flames and
Sparks&quot; (Angels and their Worlds, Stars and Planets) are
said, figuratively, to &quot;become extinct and die,&quot; that
is to say, remain <EM>unmanifested </EM>until a certain process
of nature is accomplished. To show how thickly veiled from public
view are the most important facts of anthropogenesis, two passages
are now quoted from two Kabalistic books. The first is from the
<EM>Book of the Concealed Mystery: </EM>--
<P>
(429.) From a Light-Bearer (one of the seven sacred planets) of
insupportable brightness proceeded a radiating Flame, dashing
off, like a vast and mighty hammer, those sparks which were the
prior worlds.
<P>
(430.) And with most subtle ether were these intermingled and
bound mutually together, but <EM>only when they were conjoined
together, </EM>even the great Father and great Mother.
<P>
(431.) From <EM>Hoa</EM>, himself, is AB, the Father; and from
Hoa, himself, is RUACH, the Spirit; who are hidden in the Ancient
of Days, and therein is that Ether concealed.
<P>
(432.) And it was connected with a Light-Bearer (a planet and
its angel or regent), which went forth from that Light-Bearer
of insupportable brightness, which is hidden in the bosom of <EM>Aima,
</EM>the Great Mother.*
<P>
Now the following extract from the Zohar** also deals with the
same mystery: -- &quot;The Pre-Adamite Kings. 'We have learned
in the Siphrah D'Tzniootha: That the <EM>At-tee'kah DAt-tee'keen,
</EM>Ancient of Ancients, before He prepared his Form, built Kings,
and engraved

Kings, and sketched out Kings (men, the Kings of the animals),
and they could not exist: till he overthrew them <EM>and hid them
until after a time, </EM>therefore it is written: 'And these are
the Kings which reigned in the land of Edom' . . . . And they
could not exist till <EM>Resha'Hiv'rah, </EM>the White Head, the
<EM>At'-tee-'kah D'At-tee'keen, </EM>Ancient of Ancients, arranged
Himself . . . . and formed all forms above and below. . . . Before
He arranged himself in his Form had not been formed all those
whom he desired to form, and all worlds have been destroyed .
. . . they did not remain in their places, because the form of
the Kings had not been formed as it ought to be, and <EM>the Holy
City had not been prepared.&quot; </EM>(<EM>Zohar </EM>iii., 135<EM>a;
292a Idra Zootah. </EM>Brody, etc.)
<P>
Now the plain meaning of these two allegorical and metaphysical
disquisitions is simply this: Worlds and men were in turn formed
and destroyed, <EM>under the law of evolution </EM>and<EM> from
pre-existing material, </EM>until both the planets and their men,
in our case our Earth and its animal and human races, became what
they are now in the present cycle: opposite polar forces, an equilibrized
compound of Spirit and Matter, of the positive and the negative,
of the male and the female. Before man could become male and female
<EM>physically, </EM>his prototype, the creating Elohim, had to
arrange his Form on this sexual plane <EM>astrally. </EM>That
is to say, the atoms and the organic forces, descending into the
plane of the given differentiation, had to be marshalled in the
order intended by Nature, so as to be ever carrying out, in an
immaculate way, that law which the Kabala calls the <EM>Balance,
</EM>through which everything that exists does so as male and
female in its final perfection, in this present stage of materiality.
<EM>Chochmah, </EM>Wisdom, the Male Sephiroth, had to diffuse
itself <EM>in</EM>, and<EM> through, Binah, </EM>intelligent Nature,
or Understanding. Therefore the First Root-race of men, sexless
and mindless, had to be overthrown and &quot;hidden until after
a time&quot;; <EM>i.e.</EM>, the first race, instead of dying,
disappeared <EM>in the second race, </EM>as certain lower lives
and plants do in their progeny. It was a wholesale transformation.
The First became the Second Root-race, without either begetting
it, procreating it, or dying. <EM>&quot;They passed by </EM>together,&quot;
as it is written: &quot;And he died and another reigned in his
stead&quot; (<EM>Genesis</EM> xxvi. 31<EM> et seq. Zohar </EM>iii.,
292<EM>a</EM>). Why? Because &quot;the <EM>Holy City </EM>had
not been prepared.&quot; And what is the &quot;Holy City&quot;?
The <EM>Maquom </EM>(the Secret <EM>Place </EM>or the Shrine)
on Earth: in other words, the human womb, the microcosmic copy
and reflection of the <EM>Heavenly Matrix, </EM>the female space
or primeval Chaos, in which the male Spirit fecundates the germ
of the Son, or the visible Universe.* So much so, that in the
paragraph on &quot;the Emanation of the Male and Female Principles&quot;
in the Zohar

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 85 THE SON OF YAH.</H6>

<P>
(<EM>ibid.</EM>)<EM>, </EM>it is said that, on this earth, the
<STRONG>W</STRONG>ISDOM from the &quot;Holy Ancient&quot; &quot;does
not shine except in male and female.&quot; &quot;<EM>Hohmah, </EM>Wisdom,
is the Father, and <STRONG>B</STRONG>INAH, understanding, is the
Mother . . . . and when they connect one with the other they bring
forth and diffuse and emanate truth. In the sayings of Rabbi Je-yeva
Sabah, <EM>i.e.</EM>, the Old, we learned this: What is Binah
Understanding? But when they connect in one another, the [[diagram]]
(Yod) in the [[diagram]] (Heh), they become impregnated and produce
a Son. And, therefore, it is called <EM>Binah, </EM>Understanding.
It means BeN YaH, <EM>i.e.</EM>, Son of YaH. This is the completeness
of the whole.&quot;*
<P>
This is also the &quot;completeness&quot; of phallicism by the
Rabbis, its perfect apotheosis, the divine being dragged into
the animal, the sublime into the grossness of the terrestrial.
Nothing so graphically gross exists in Eastern Occultism, nor
in the primitive Kabala -- the &quot;Chaldean Book of Numbers.&quot;
We have said so in &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;: --
<P>
&quot;We find it rather unwise on the part of Catholic writers
to pour out their vials of wrath in such sentences as these: 'In
a multitude of pagodas, the phallic stone, ever and always assuming,
like the Grecian <EM>batylos, </EM>the brutally indecent form
of the <EM>lingham </EM>. . . the Maha Deva.' Before casting slurs
on a symbol whose profound metaphysical meaning is too much for
the modern champions of that religion of sensualism <EM>par excellence,
</EM>Roman Catholicism, to grasp, they are in duty bound to destroy
their oldest churches, and change the form of the cupolas of their
own temples. The Mahody of Elephanta, the Round Tower of Bhangulpore,
the minarets of Islam -- either rounded or pointed -- are the
originals of the <EM>Campanile </EM>column of San Marco, at Venice,
of the Rochester Cathedral, and of the modern Duomo of Milan.
All of these steeples, turrets, domes, and Christian temples,
are the reproductions of the primitive idea of the <EM>lithos,
</EM>the upright phallus.&quot; (Vol. II., p. 5.)
<P>
Nevertheless, and however it may be, the fact that all these Hebrew
Elohim, Sparks, and Cherubs are identical with the Devas, Rishis
and the Fires and Flames, the Rudras and the forty-nine Agnis
of the ancient Aryas, is sufficiently proven by and in the Kabala.
