PAGES FROM A PRE-HISTORIC PERIOD.
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>N Archaic Manuscript -- a collection of palm
leaves made impermeable to water, fire, and air, by some specific
unknown process -- is before the writer's eye. On the first page
is an immaculate white disk within a dull black ground. On the
following page, the same disk, but with a central point. The first,
the student knows to represent Kosmos in Eternity, before the
re-awakening of still slumbering Energy, the emanation of the
Word in later systems. The point in the hitherto immaculate Disk,
Space and Eternity in Pralaya, denotes the dawn of differentiation.
It is the Point in the Mundane Egg (see Part II., &quot;The Mundane
Egg&quot;), the germ within the latter which will become the Universe,
the ALL, the boundless, periodical Kosmos, this germ being latent
and active, periodically and by turns. The one circle is divine
Unity, from which all proceeds, whither all returns. Its circumference
-- a forcibly limited symbol, in view of the limitation of the
human mind -- indicates the abstract, ever incognisable PRESENCE,
and its plane, the Universal Soul, although the two are one. Only
the face of the Disk being white and the ground all around black,
shows clearly that its plane is the only knowledge, dim and hazy
though it still is, that is attainable by man. It is on this plane
that the Manvantaric manifestations begin; for it is in this SOUL
that slumbers, during the Pralaya, the Divine Thought,* wherein
lies concealed the plan of every future Cosmogony and Theogony.

* It is hardly necessary to remind the reader once more that the
term &quot;Divine Thought,&quot; like that of &quot;Universal
Mind,&quot; must not be regarded as even vaguely shadowing forth
an intellectual process akin to that exhibited by man. The &quot;Unconscious,&quot;
according to von Hartmann, arrived at the vast creative, or rather
Evolutionary Plan, &quot;by a clairvoyant wisdom superior to all
consciousness,&quot; which in the Vedantic language would mean
absolute Wisdom. Only those who realise how far Intuition soars
above the tardy processes of ratiocinative thought can form the
faintest conception of [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 2 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
It is the ONE LIFE, eternal, invisible, yet Omnipresent, without
beginning or end, yet periodical in its regular manifestations,
between which periods reigns the dark mystery of non-Being; unconscious,
yet absolute Consciousness; unrealisable, yet the one self-existing
reality; truly, &quot;a chaos to the sense, a Kosmos to the reason.&quot;
Its one absolute attribute, which is ITSELF, eternal, ceaseless
Motion, is called in esoteric parlance the &quot;Great Breath,&quot;*
which is the perpetual motion of the universe, in the sense of
limitless, ever-present SPACE. That which is motionless cannot
be Divine. But then there is nothing in fact and reality absolutely
motionless within the universal soul.
<P>
Almost five centuries B.C. Leucippus, the instructor of Democritus,
maintained that Space was filled eternally with atoms actuated
by a ceaseless motion, the latter generating in due course of
time, when those atoms aggregated, rotatory motion, through mutual
collisions producing lateral movements. Epicurus and Lucretius
taught the same, only adding to the lateral motion of the atoms
the idea of affinity -- an occult teaching.
<P>
From the beginning of man's inheritance, from the first appearance
of the architects of the globe he lives in, the unrevealed Deity
was recognised and considered under its only philosophical aspect
-- universal motion, the thrill of the creative Breath in Nature.
Occultism sums up the &quot;One Existence&quot; thus: &quot;Deity
is an arcane, living (or moving) FIRE, and the eternal witnesses
to this unseen Presence are Light, Heat, Moisture,&quot; -- this
trinity including, and being the cause of, every
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] that absolute Wisdom
which transcends the ideas of Time and Space. Mind, as we know
it, is resolvable into states of consciousness, of varying duration,
intensity, complexity, etc. -- all, in the ultimate, resting on
sensation, which is again Maya. Sensation, again, necessarily
postulates limitation. The personal God of orthodox Theism perceives,
thinks, and is affected by emotion; he repents and feels &quot;fierce
anger.&quot; But the notion of such mental states clearly involves
the unthinkable postulate of the externality of the exciting stimuli,
to say nothing of the impossibility of ascribing changelessness
to a Being whose emotions fluctuate with events in the worlds
he presides over. The conceptions of a Personal God as changeless
and infinite are thus unpsychological and, what is worse, unphilosophical.

* Plato proves himself an Initiate, when saying in Cratylus that
[[<EM>theos</EM>]] is derived from the verb [[<EM>theein</EM>]],
&quot;to move,&quot; &quot;to run,&quot; as the first astronomers
who observed the motions of the heavenly bodies called the planets
[[<EM>theoi</EM>]], the gods. (See Book II., &quot;Symbolism of
the Cross and Circle.&quot;) Later, the word produced another
term, [[<EM>aletheia</EM>]] -- &quot;the breath of God.&quot;

phenomenon in Nature.* Intra-Cosmic motion is eternal and ceaseless;
cosmic motion (the visible, or that which is subject to perception)
is finite and periodical. As an eternal abstraction it is the
EVER-PRESENT; as a manifestation, it is finite both in the coming
direction and the opposite, the two being the alpha and omega
of successive reconstructions. Kosmos -- the NOUMENON -- has nought
to do with the causal relations of the phenomenal World. It is
only with reference to the intra-cosmic soul, the ideal Kosmos
in the immutable Divine Thought, that we may say: &quot;It never
had a beginning nor will it have an end.&quot; With regard to
its body or Cosmic organization, though it cannot be said that
it had a first, or will ever have a last construction, yet at
each new Manvantara, its organization may be regarded as the first
and the last of its kind, as it evolutes every time on a higher
plane . . . .
<P>
A few years ago only, it was stated that: --
<P>
&quot;The esoteric doctrine teaches, like Buddhism and Brahminism,
and even the Kabala, that the one infinite and unknown Essence
exists from all eternity, and in regular and harmonious successions
is either passive or active. In the poetical phraseology of Manu
these conditions are called the &quot;Days&quot; and the &quot;Nights&quot;
of Brahma. The latter is either &quot;awake&quot; or &quot;asleep.&quot;
The Svabhavikas, or philosophers of the oldest school of Buddhism
(which still exists in Nepaul), speculate only upon the active
condition of this &quot;Essence,&quot; which they call Svabhavat,
and deem it foolish to theorise upon the abstract and &quot;unknowable&quot;
power in its passive condition. Hence they are called atheists
by both Christian theologians and modern scientists, for neither
of the

* Nominalists, arguing with Berkeley that &quot;it is impossible
. . . to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body
moving&quot; (&quot;<EM>Prin. of Human Knowledge,</EM>&quot;<EM>
Introd</EM>.,<EM> par. </EM>10), may put the question, &quot;What
is that body, the producer of that motion? Is it a substance?
Then you are believers in a Personal God?&quot; etc., etc. This
will be answered farther on, in the Addendum to this Book; meanwhile,
we claim our rights of Conceptionalists as against Roscelini's
materialistic views of Realism and Nominalism. &quot;Has science,&quot;
says one of its ablest advocates, Edward Clodd, &quot;revealed
anything that weakens or opposes itself to the ancient words in
which the Essence of all religion, past, present, and to come,
is given; to do justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly before thy
God?&quot; Provided we connote by the word God, <EM>not the crude
anthropomorphism which is still the backbone of our current theology,
but the symbolic conception of that which is Life and Motion of
the Universe</EM>, to know which in physical order is to know
time past, present, and to come, in the existence of successions
of phenomena; to know which, in the moral, is to know what has
been, is, and will be, within human consciousness. (<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Science

two are able to understand the profound logic of their philosophy.
The former will allow of no other God than the personified secondary
powers which have worked out the visible universe, and which became
with them the anthropomorphic God of the Christians -- the male
Jehovah, roaring amid thunder and lightning. In its turn, rationalistic
science greets the Buddhists and the Svabhavikas as the &quot;positivists&quot;
of the archaic ages. If we take a one-sided view of the philosophy
of the latter, our materialists may be right in their own way.
The Buddhists maintained that there is no Creator, but an infinitude
of creative powers, which collectively form the one eternal substance,
the essence of which is inscrutable -- hence not a subject for
speculation for any true philosopher. Socrates invariably refused
to argue upon the mystery of universal being, yet no one would
ever have thought of charging him with atheism, except those who
were bent upon his destruction. Upon inaugurating an active period,
says the Secret Doctrine, an expansion of this Divine essence
from without inwardly and from within outwardly, occurs in obedience
to eternal and immutable law, and the phenomenal or visible universe
is the ultimate result of the long chain of cosmical forces thus
progressively set in motion. In like manner, when the passive
condition is resumed, a contraction of the Divine essence takes
place, and the previous work of creation is gradually and progressively
undone. The visible universe becomes disintegrated, its material
dispersed; and 'darkness' solitary and alone, broods once more
over the face of the 'deep.' To use a Metaphor from the Secret
Books, which will convey the idea still more clearly, an out-breathing
of the 'unknown essence' produces the world; and an inhalation
causes it to disappear. This process has been going on from all
eternity, and our present universe is but one of an infinite series,
which had no beginning and will have no end.&quot; -- (<EM>See
</EM>&quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>&quot;<EM>; also </EM>&quot;<EM>The
Days and Nights of Brahma</EM>&quot;<EM> in Part II.</EM>)
<P>
This passage will be explained, as far as it is possible, in the
present work. Though, as it now stands, it contains nothing new
to the Orientalist, its esoteric interpretation may contain a
good deal which has hitherto remained entirely unknown to the
Western student.
<P>
The first illustration being a plain disc <IMG SRC="sd1-4a.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
the second one in the Archaic symbol shows <IMG SRC="sd1-4b.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">,
a disc with a point in it -- the first differentiation in the
periodical manifestations of the ever-eternal nature, sexless
and infinite &quot;Aditi in THAT&quot; (Rig Veda), the point in
the disc, or potential Space within abstract Space. In its third
stage the point is transformed into a diameter, thus <IMG SRC="sd1-4c.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
It now symbolises a divine immaculate Mother-Nature within the
all-embracing absolute Infinitude.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 5 PROEM.</H6>

<P>
When the diameter line is crossed by a vertical one <IMG SRC="sd1-5a.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,
it becomes the mundane cross. Humanity has reached its third root-race;
it is the sign for the origin of human life to begin. When the
circumference disappears and leaves only the <IMG SRC="sd1-5b.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
it is a sign that the fall of man into matter is accomplished,
and the FOURTH race begins. The Cross within a circle symbolises
pure Pantheism; when the Cross was left uninscribed, it became
phallic. It had the same and yet other meanings as a TAU inscribed
within a circle <IMG SRC="sd1-5c.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE"> or as a
&quot;Thor's hammer,&quot; the Jaina cross, so-called, or simply
Svastica within a circle <IMG SRC="sd1-5d.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">

<P>
By the third symbol -- the circle divided in two by the horizontal
line of the diameter -- the first manifestation of creative (still
passive, because feminine) Nature was meant. The first shadowy
perception of man connected with procreation is feminine, because
man knows his mother more than his father. Hence female deities
were more sacred than the male. Nature is therefore feminine,
and, to a degree, objective and tangible, and the spirit Principle
which fructifies it is concealed. By adding to the circle with
the horizontal line in it, a perpendicular line, the tau was formed
-- -- <IMG SRC="sd1-5e.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> -- the oldest form
of the letter. It was the glyph of the third root-race to the
day of its symbolical Fall -- <EM>i.e.</EM>, when the separation
of sexes by natural evolution took place -- when the figure became
<IMG SRC="sd1-5f.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">, the circle, or sexless
life modified or separated -- a double glyph or symbol. With the
races of our Fifth Race it became in symbology the sacr', and
in Hebrew n'cabvah, of the first-formed races;* then it changed
into the Egyptian <IMG SRC="sd1-5g.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE"> (emblem
of life), and still later into the sign of Venus, <IMG SRC="sd1-5h.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
Then comes the Svastica (Thor's hammer, or the &quot;Hermetic
Cross&quot; now), entirely separated from its Circle, thus becoming
purely phallic. The esoteric symbol of Kali Yuga is the five-pointed
star reversed, thus <IMG SRC="sd1-5i.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE"> -- the
sign of human sorcery, with its two points (horns) turned heavenward,
a position every

Occultist will recognise as one of the &quot;left-hand,&quot;
and used in ceremonial magic.*
<P>
It is hoped that during the perusal of this work the erroneous
ideas of the public in general with regard to Pantheism will be
modified. It is wrong and unjust to regard the Buddhists and Advaitee
Occultists as atheists. If not all of them philosophers, they
are, at any rate, all logicians, their objections and arguments
being based on strict reasoning. Indeed, if the Parabrahmam of
the Hindus may be taken as a representative of the hidden and
nameless deities of other nations, this absolute Principle will
be found to be the prototype from which all the others were copied.
Parabrahm is not &quot;God,&quot; because It is not a God. &quot;It
is that which is supreme, and not supreme (paravara),&quot; explains
Mandukya Upanishad (2.28). IT is &quot;Supreme&quot; as CAUSE,
not supreme as effect. Parabrahm is simply, as a &quot;Secondless
Reality,&quot; the all-inclusive Kosmos -- or, rather, the infinite
Cosmic Space -- in the highest spiritual sense, of course. Brahma
(neuter) being the unchanging, pure, free, undecaying supreme
Root, &quot;the ONE true Existence, Paramarthika,&quot; and the
absolute Chit and Chaitanya (intelligence, consciousness) cannot
be a cogniser, &quot;for THAT can have no subject of cognition.&quot;
Can the flame be called the essence of Fire? This Essence is &quot;the
LIFE and LIGHT of the Universe, the visible fire and flame are
destruction, death, and evil.&quot; &quot;Fire and Flame destroy
the body of an Arhat, their essence makes him immortal.&quot;
(<EM>Bodhi-mur, Book II.</EM>)<EM> </EM>&quot;The knowledge of
the absolute Spirit, like the effulgence of the sun, or like heat
in fire, is naught else than the absolute Essence itself,&quot;
says Sankaracharya.<STRONG> IT</STRONG> -- is &quot;the Spirit
of the Fire,&quot; not fire itself; therefore, &quot;the attributes
of the latter, heat or flame, are not the attributes of the Spirit,
but of that of which that Spirit is the unconscious cause.&quot;
Is not the above sentence the true key-note of later Rosicrucian
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* We are told by the Western mathematicians and some American
Kabalists, that in the Kabala also &quot;the value of the Jehovah
name is that of the diameter of a circle.&quot; Add to this the
fact that Jehovah is the third Sephiroth, <EM>Binah, </EM>a feminine
word, and you have the key to the mystery. By certain Kabalistic
transformations this name, <EM>androgynous </EM>in the first chapters
of Genesis, becomes in its transformations entirely masculine,
Cainite and phallic. The fact of choosing a deity among the pagan
gods and making of it a special national God, to call upon it
as the &quot;One living God,&quot; the &quot;God of Gods,&quot;
and then proclaim this worship Monotheistic, does not change it
into the ONE Principle whose &quot;Unity admits not of multiplication,
change, or form,&quot; especially in the case of a priapic deity,
as Jehovah now demonstrated to be.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 7 PROEM.</H6>

<P>
philosophy? Parabrahm is, in short, the collective aggregate of
Kosmos in its infinity and eternity, the &quot;THAT&quot; and
&quot;THIS&quot; to which distributive aggregates can not be applied.*
&quot;In the beginning THIS was the Self, one only&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Aitareya
Upanishad</EM><I>)</I><EM>; </EM>the great Sankaracharya, explains
that &quot;THIS&quot; referred to the Universe (Jagat); the sense
of the words, &quot;In the beginning,&quot; meaning before the
reproduction of the phenomenal Universe.
<P>
Therefore, when the Pantheists echo the Upanishads, which state,
as in the Secret Doctrine, that &quot;this&quot; cannot create,
they do not deny a Creator, or rather a <EM>collective aggregate
</EM>of creators, but only refuse, very logically, to attribute
&quot;creation&quot; and especially formation, something finite
to an Infinite Principle. With them, Parabrahmam is a passive
because an Absolute Cause, the unconditioned <EM>Mukta. </EM>It
is only limited Omniscience and Omnipotence that are refused to
the latter, because these are still attributes (as reflected in
man's perceptions); and because Parabrahm, being the &quot;Supreme
ALL,&quot; the ever invisible spirit and Soul of Nature, changeless
and eternal, can have no attributes; absoluteness very naturally
precluding any idea of the finite or conditioned from being connected
with it. And if the Vedantin postulates attributes as belonging
simply to its emanation, calling it &quot;Iswara <EM>plus </EM>Maya,&quot;
and Avidya (Agnosticism and Nescience rather than ignorance),
it is difficult to find any Atheism in this conception.** Since
there can be neither two INFINITES nor two ABSOLUTES in a Universe
supposed to be Boundless, this Self-Existence can hardly be conceived
of as creating personally. In the sense and perceptions of finite
&quot;Beings,&quot; THAT is Non-&quot;being,&quot; in the sense
that it is the one BE-NESS; for, in this ALL lies concealed its
coeternal and coeval emanation or inherent radiation, which, upon
becoming periodically Brahma (the male-female Potency) becomes
or expands itself into the manifested Universe. Narayana moving
on the (abstract) waters of Space, is transformed into the Waters
of concrete substance moved by him, who now becomes the manifested
WORD or Logos.

would like to prove this pure Atheism. For proof of this, see
about Major Jacob's &quot;Vedanta Sara.&quot; Yet, the whole Antiquity
echoes this Vedantic thought: --

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 8 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
The orthodox Brahmins, those who rise the most against the Pantheists
and Adwaitees, calling them Atheists, are forced, if Manu has
any authority in this matter, to accept the death of Brahma, the
creator, at the expiration of every &quot;Age&quot; of this (creative)
deity (100 Divine years -- a period which in our years requires
fifteen figures to express it). Yet, no philosopher among them
will view this &quot;death&quot; in any other sense than as a
temporary disappearance from the manifested plane of existence,
or as a periodical rest.
<P>
The Occultists are, therefore, at one with the Adwaita Vedantin
philosophers as to the above tenet. They show the impossibility
of accepting on philosophical grounds the idea of the absolute
ALL creating or even evolving the &quot;Golden Egg,&quot; into
which it is said to enter in order to transform itself into Brahma
-- the Creator, who expands himself later into gods and all the
visible Universe. They say that Absolute Unity cannot pass to
infinity; for infinity presupposes the limitless extension of
<EM>something, </EM>and the duration of that &quot;something&quot;;
and the One All is like Space -- which is its only mental and
physical representation on this Earth, or our plane of existence
-- neither an object of, nor a subject to, perception. If one
could suppose the Eternal Infinite All, the Omnipresent Unity,
instead of being in Eternity, becoming through periodical manifestation
a manifold Universe or a multiple personality, that Unity would
cease to be one. Locke's idea that &quot;pure Space is capable
of neither resistance nor Motion&quot; -- is incorrect. Space
is neither a &quot;limitless void,&quot; nor a &quot;conditioned
fulness,&quot; but both: being, on the plane of absolute abstraction,
the ever-incognisable Deity, which is void only to finite minds,*
and on that of <EM>mayavic </EM>perception, the Plenum, the absolute
Container of all that is, whether manifested or unmanifested:
it is, therefore, that ABSOLUTE ALL. There is no difference between
the Christian Apostle's &quot;In Him we live and move and have
our being,&quot; and the Hindu Rishi's &quot;The Universe lives
in, proceeds from, and will

* The very names of the two chief deities, Brahma and Vishnu,
ought to have long ago suggested their esoteric meanings. For
the root of one, Brahmam, or Brahm, is derived by some from the
word Brih, &quot;to grow&quot; or &quot;to expand&quot; (see <EM>Calcutta
Review, </EM>vol. lxvi., p. 14); and of the other, Vishnu, from
the root Vis, &quot;to pervade,&quot; to enter in the nature of
the essence; Brahma-Vishnu being this infinite SPACE, of which

simply the potencies, Vibhutayah.<HR>

return to, Brahma (Brahma)&quot;: for Brahma (neuter), the unmanifested,
is that Universe <EM>in abscondito, </EM>and Brahma, the manifested,
is the Logos, made male-female* in the symbolical orthodox dogmas.
The God of the Apostle-Initiate and of the Rishi being both the
Unseen and the Visible SPACE. Space is called in the esoteric
symbolism &quot;the Seven-Skinned Eternal Mother-Father.&quot;
It is composed from its undifferentiated to its differentiated
surface of seven layers.

&quot;What is that which was, is, and will be, whether there is
a Universe or not; whether there be gods or none?&quot; asks the
esoteric Senzar Catechism. And the answer made is -- SPACE.

It is not the One Unknown ever-present God in Nature, or Nature

dogma and his <EM>humanized </EM>&quot;Word.&quot; In his infinite
conceit and inherent pride and vanity, man shaped it himself with
his sacrilegious hand out of the material he found in his own
small brain-fabric, and forced it upon mankind as a direct revelation
from the one unrevealed SPACE.** The Occultist

<P>
** Occultism is indeed in the air at the close of this our century.
Among many other works recently published, we would recommend
one especially to students of theoretical Occultism who would
not venture beyond the realm of our special human plane. It is
called &quot;New Aspects of Life and Religion,&quot; by Henry
Pratt, M.D. It is full of esoteric dogmas and philosophy, the
latter rather limited, in the concluding chapters, by what seems
to be a spirit of conditioned positivism. Nevertheless, what is
said of Space as &quot;the Unknown First Cause,&quot; merits quotation.
&quot;This unknown something, thus recognised as, and identified
with, the primary embodiment of Simple Unity, is invisible and
impalpable&quot; -- (<EM>abstract </EM>space, granted); &quot;and
because invisible and impalpable, therefore incognisable. And
this incognisability has led to the error of supposing it to be
a simple void, a mere receptive capacity. But, even viewed as
an absolute void, space must be admitted to be either Self-existent,
infinite, and eternal, or to have had a first cause outside, behind,
and beyond itself.
<P>
&quot;And yet could such a cause be found and defined, this would
only lead to the transferring thereto of the attributes otherwise
accruing to space, and thus merely throw the difficulty of origination
a step farther back, without gaining additional light as to primary
causation.&quot; (p. 5.)
<P>
This is precisely what has been done by the believers in an anthropomorphic
Creator, an extracosmic, instead of an intracosmic God. Many --
most of Mr. Pratt's subjects, we may say -- are old Kabalistic
ideas and theories which he presents in quite a new garb: &quot;New
Aspects&quot; of the Occult in Nature, indeed. Space, however,
viewed as a &quot;Substantial Unity&quot; -- the &quot;living
Source of Life&quot; -- is as the &quot;Un- [[Footnote continued

accepts revelation as coming from divine yet still finite Beings,
the manifested lives, never from the Unmanifestable ONE LIFE;
from those entities, called Primordial Man, Dhyani-Buddhas, or
Dhyan-Chohans, the &quot;Rishi-Prajapati&quot; of the Hindus,
the Elohim or &quot;Sons of God,&quot; the Planetary Spirits of
all nations, who have become Gods for men. He also regards the
Adi-Sakti -- the direct emanation of Mulaprakriti, the eternal
Root of THAT, and the female aspect of the Creative Cause Brahma,
in her A'kasic form of the Universal Soul -- as philosophically
a Maya, and cause of human Maya. But this view does not prevent
him from believing in its existence so long as it lasts, to wit,
for one Mahamanvantara; nor from applying Akasa, the radiation
of Mulaprakriti,* to practical purposes, connected as the World-Soul
is with all natural phenomena, known or unknown to science.
<P>
The oldest religions of the world -- exoterically, for the esoteric
root or foundation is one -- are the Indian, the Mazdean, and
the Egyptian. Then comes the Chaldean, the outcome of these --
entirely lost to the world now, except in its disfigured Sabeanism
as at present rendered by the archaeologists; then, passing over
a number of religions that will be mentioned later, comes the
Jewish, esoterically, as in the Kabala, following in the line
of Babylonian Magism; exoterically, as in Genesis and the Pentateuch,
a collection of allegorical legends. Read by the light of the
Zohar, the initial four chapters of Genesis are the fragment

and Matter, as Potencies of Space, inseparable, and the Unknown
revealers of the Unknown.&quot; They are all found in Aryan philosophy
personified by Visvakarman, Indra, Vishnu, etc., etc. Still they
are expressed very philosophically, and under many unusual aspects,

For clearer understanding on the part of the general reader, it
must be stated that Occult Science recognises <I>Seven </I>Cosmical
Elements -- four entirely physical, and the fifth (Ether) semi-material,
as it will become visible in the air towards the end of our Fourth
Round, to reign supreme over the others during the whole of the
Fifth. The remaining two are as yet absolutely beyond the range
of human perception. These latter will, however, appear as presentments
during the 6th and 7th Races of this Round, and will become known
in the 6th and 7th Rounds respectively.* These seven elements

when the pre-existing material consists but of ONE Element, and

inwardly: after a minor pralaya, everything having remained in

the moon -- at the first flutter of manvantara, the planet or

<P>
* It is curious to notice how, in the evolutionary cycles of ideas,
ancient thought seems to be reflected in modern speculation. Had
Mr. Herbert Spencer read and studied ancient Hindu philosophers
when he wrote a certain passage in his &quot;First Principles&quot;
(p. 482), or is it an independent flash of inner perception that
made him say half correctly, half incorrectly, &quot;motion as
well as matter, being fixed in quantity (?), it would seem that
the change in the distribution of Matter which Motion effects,
coming to a limit in whichever direction it is carried (?), the
indestructible Motion thereupon necessitates a reverse distribution.
Apparently, the universally co-existent forces of attraction and
repulsion which, as we have seen, necessitate rhythm in all minor
changes throughout the Universe, also necessitate rhythm in the
totality of its changes -- produce now an immeasurable period
during which the attracting forces predominating, cause universal
concentration, and then an immeasurable period, during which the
repulsive forces predominating, cause universal diffusion -- alternate
eras of Evolution and dissolution.&quot;<HR>

</EM>modifications and aspects of the ONE and only Element. This
latter is not <EM>Ether,* </EM>not even <EM>A'kasa </EM>but the
<EM>Source </EM>of these. The Fifth Element, now advocated quite
freely by Science, is not the Ether hypothesised by Sir Isaac
Newton -- although he calls it by that name, having associated
it in his mind probably with the AEther, &quot;Father-Mother&quot;
of Antiquity. As Newton intuitionally says, &quot;Nature is a
perpetual circulatory worker, generating fluids out of solids,
fixed things out of volatile, and volatile out of fixed, subtile
out of gross, and gross out of subtile. . . . . Thus, perhaps,
may all things be originated from Ether,&quot; (Hypoth, 1675).
<P>
The reader has to bear in mind that the Stanzas given treat only
of the Cosmogony of our own planetary System and what is visible
around it, after a Solar Pralaya. The secret teachings with regard
to the Evolution of the Universal Kosmos cannot be given, since
they could not be understood by the highest minds in this age,
and there seem to be very few Initiates, even among the greatest,
who are allowed to speculate upon this subject. Moreover the Teachers
say openly that not even the highest Dhyani-Chohans have ever
penetrated the mysteries beyond those boundaries that separate
the milliards of Solar systems from the &quot;Central Sun,&quot;
as it is called. Therefore, that which is given, relates only
to our visible Kosmos, after a &quot;Night of Brahma.&quot;
<P>
Before the reader proceeds to the consideration of the Stanzas
from the Book of Dzyan which form the basis of the present work,
it is absolutely necessary that he should be made acquainted with
the few fundamental conceptions which underlie and pervade the
entire system of thought to which his attention is invited. These
basic ideas are few in number, and on their clear apprehension
depends the understanding of all that follows; therefore no apology
is required for asking the reader to make himself familiar with
them first, before entering on the perusal of the work itself.
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Whatever the views of physical Science upon the subject, Occult
Science has been teaching for ages that A'kasa -- of which Ether
is the grossest form -- the fifth universal Cosmic Principle (to
which corresponds and from which proceeds human Manas) is, cosmically,
a radiant, cool, diathermanous plastic matter, creative in its
physical nature, correlative in its grossest aspects and portions,
immutable in its higher principles. In the former condition it
is called the Sub-Root; and in conjunction with radiant heat,
it recalls &quot;dead worlds to life.&quot; In its higher aspect
it is the Soul of the World; in its lower -- the DESTROYER.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 14 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
The Secret Doctrine establishes three fundamental propositions:
--
<P>
<I>(</I><EM>a</EM><I>)</I> An Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless,
and Immutable <STRONG>P</STRONG>RINCIPLE on which all speculation
is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception
and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude.
It is beyond the range and reach of thought -- in the words of
Mandukya, &quot;unthinkable and unspeakable.&quot;
<P>
To render these ideas clearer to the general reader, let him set
out with the postulate that there is one absolute Reality which
antecedes all manifested, conditioned, being. This Infinite and
Eternal Cause -- dimly formulated in the &quot;Unconscious&quot;
and &quot;Unknowable&quot; of current European philosophy -- is
the rootless root of &quot;all that was, is, or ever shall be.&quot;
It is of course devoid of all attributes and is essentially without
any relation to manifested, finite Being. It is &quot;Be-ness&quot;
rather than Being (in Sanskrit, <EM>Sat</EM>), and is beyond all
thought or speculation.
<P>
This &quot;Be-ness&quot; is symbolised in the Secret Doctrine
under two aspects. On the one hand, absolute abstract Space, representing
bare subjectivity, the one thing which no human mind can either
exclude from any conception, or conceive of by itself. On the
other, absolute Abstract Motion representing Unconditioned Consciousness.
Even our Western thinkers have shown that Consciousness is inconceivable
to us apart from change, and motion best symbolises change, its
essential characteristic. This latter aspect of the one Reality,
is also symbolised by the term &quot;The Great Breath,&quot; a
symbol sufficiently graphic to need no further elucidation. Thus,
then, the first fundamental axiom of the Secret Doctrine is this
metaphysical <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE <STRONG>A</STRONG>BSOLUTE --
<STRONG>B</STRONG>E-NESS -- symbolised by finite intelligence
as the theological Trinity.
<P>
It may, however, assist the student if a few further explanations
are given here.
<P>
Herbert Spencer has of late so far modified his Agnosticism, as
to assert that the nature of the &quot;First Cause,&quot;* which
the Occultist more logically derives from the &quot;Causeless
Cause,&quot; the &quot;Eternal,&quot; and the &quot;Unknowable,&quot;
may be essentially the same as that of the Consciousness which
wells up within us: in short, that the impersonal reality pervading
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

is the &quot;first brought forth, the first in time, space, and
rank&quot; -- and therefore finite and conditioned. The &quot;first&quot;

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 15 PROEM.</H6>

<P>
the Kosmos is the pure noumenon of thought. This advance on his
part brings him very near to the esoteric and Vedantin tenet.*
<P>
Parabrahm (the One Reality, the Absolute) is the field of Absolute
Consciousness, <EM>i.e.,</EM> that Essence which is out of all
relation to conditioned existence, and of which conscious existence
is a conditioned symbol. But once that we pass in thought from
this (to us) Absolute Negation, duality supervenes in the contrast
of Spirit (or consciousness) and Matter, Subject and Object.
<P>
Spirit (or Consciousness) and Matter are, however, to be regarded,
not as independent realities, but as the two facets or aspects
of the Absolute (Parabrahm), which constitute the basis of conditioned
Being whether subjective or objective.
<P>
Considering this metaphysical triad as the Root from which proceeds
all manifestation, the great Breath assumes the character of precosmic
Ideation. It is the<EM> fons et origo </EM>of force and of all
individual consciousness, and supplies the guiding intelligence
in the vast scheme of cosmic Evolution. On the other hand, precosmic
root-substance (<EM>Mulaprakriti</EM>) is that aspect of the Absolute
which underlies all the objective planes of Nature.
<P>
Just as pre-Cosmic Ideation is the root of all individual consciousness,
so pre-Cosmic Substance is the substratum of matter in the various
grades of its differentiation.
<P>
Hence it will be apparent that the contrast of these two aspects
of the Absolute is essential to the existence of the &quot;Manifested
Universe.&quot; Apart from Cosmic Substance, Cosmic Ideation could
not manifest as individual consciousness, since it is only through
a vehicle<A NAME="t3">**</A> of matter that consciousness wells
up as &quot;I am I,&quot; a physical basis being necessary to
focus a ray of the Universal Mind at a certain stage of complexity.
Again, apart from Cosmic Ideation, Cosmic Substance would remain
an empty abstraction, and no emergence of consciousness could
ensue.
<P>
The &quot;Manifested Universe,&quot; therefore, is pervaded by
duality, which is, as it were, the very essence of its EX-istence
as &quot;manifestation.&quot;
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] <EM>cannot be the absolute</EM>,
for it is a manifestation. Therefore, Eastern Occultism calls
the Abstract All the &quot;Causeless One Cause,&quot; the &quot;Rootless
Root,&quot; and limits the &quot;First Cause&quot; to the <EM>Logos,
</EM>in the sense that Plato gives to this term.

<P>
But just as the opposite poles of subject and object, spirit and
matter, are but aspects of the One Unity in which they are synthesized,
so, in the manifested Universe, there is &quot;that&quot; which
links spirit to matter, subject to object.
<P>
This something, at present unknown to Western speculation, is
called by the occultists Fohat. It is the &quot;bridge&quot; by
which the &quot;Ideas&quot; existing in the &quot;Divine Thought&quot;
are impressed on Cosmic substance as the &quot;laws of Nature.&quot;
Fohat is thus the dynamic energy of Cosmic Ideation; or, regarded
from the other side, it is the intelligent medium, the guiding
power of all manifestation, the &quot;Thought Divine&quot; transmitted
and made manifest through the Dhyan Chohans,* the Architects of
the visible World. Thus from Spirit, or Cosmic Ideation, comes
our consciousness; from Cosmic Substance the several vehicles
in which that consciousness is individualised and attains to self
-- or reflective -- consciousness; while Fohat, in its various
manifestations, is the mysterious link between Mind and Matter,
the animating principle electrifying every atom into life.
<P>
The following summary will afford a clearer idea to the reader.
<P>
(1.) The <STRONG>A</STRONG>BSOLUTE; the <EM>Parabrahm </EM>of
the Vedantins or the one Reality, <STRONG>S</STRONG>AT, which
is, as Hegel says, both Absolute Being and Non-Being.
<P>
(2.) The first manifestation, the impersonal, and, in philosophy,
<EM>unmanifested</EM> Logos, the precursor of the &quot;manifested.&quot;
This is the &quot;First Cause,&quot; the &quot;Unconscious&quot;
of European Pantheists.
<P>
(3.) Spirit-matter, <STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE; the &quot;Spirit of
the Universe,&quot; the Purusha and Prakriti, or the <EM>second
</EM>Logos.
<P>
(4.) Cosmic Ideation, <STRONG>M</STRONG>AHAT or Intelligence,
the Universal World-Soul; the Cosmic Noumenon of Matter, the basis
of the intelligent operations in and of Nature, also called <STRONG>M</STRONG>AHA-<STRONG>B</STRONG>UDDHI.
<P>
The <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE <STRONG>R</STRONG>EALITY; its <EM>dual</EM>
aspects in the conditioned Universe.
<P>
Further, the Secret Doctrine affirms: --
<P>
<I>(</I><EM>b.</EM><I>)</I> The Eternity of the Universe <EM>in
toto </EM>as a boundless plane; periodically &quot;the playground
of numberless Universes incessantly manifesting and disappearing,&quot;
called &quot;the manifesting stars,&quot; and the &quot;sparks
of Eternity.&quot; &quot;The Eternity of the Pilgrim&quot;*<A NAME="t5">*</A>
is like a wink

</H6>

<P>
* Called by Christian theology: Archangels, Seraphs, etc., etc.
<P>
<A NAME="n5">**</A> &quot;Pilgrim&quot; is the appellation given
to our <EM>Monad </EM>(the two in one) during its cycle of incarnations.
It is the only immortal and eternal principle in us, being an
indivisible part of the integral whole -- the Universal Spirit,
from which it emanates, and into which it is absorbed at the end
of the cycle. When it is said to emanate from the one [[Footnote
continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 17 PROEM.</H6>

<P>
of the Eye of Self-Existence (Book of Dzyan.) &quot;The appearance
and disappearance of Worlds is like a regular tidal ebb of flux
and reflux.&quot; (See Part II., &quot;Days and Nights of Brahma.&quot;)
<P>
This second assertion of the Secret Doctrine is the absolute universality
of that law of periodicity, of flux and reflux, ebb and flow,
which physical science has observed and recorded in all departments
of nature. An alternation such as that of Day and Night, Life
and Death, Sleeping and Waking, is a fact so common, so perfectly
universal and without exception, that it is easy to comprehend
that in it we see one of the absolutely fundamental laws of the
universe.
<P>
Moreover, the Secret Doctrine teaches: --
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>)<EM> </EM>The fundamental identity of all Souls with
the Universal Over-Soul, the latter being itself an aspect of
the Unknown Root; and the obligatory pilgrimage for every Soul
-- a spark of the former -- through the Cycle of Incarnation (or
&quot;Necessity&quot;) in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic law,
during the whole term. In other words, no purely spiritual Buddhi
(divine Soul) can have an independent (conscious) existence before
the spark which issued from the pure Essence of the Universal
Sixth principle, -- or the OVER-SOUL, -- has (a) passed through
every elemental form of the phenomenal world of that Manvantara,
and (b) acquired individuality, first by natural impulse, and
then by self-induced and self-devised efforts (checked by its
Karma), thus ascending through all the degrees of intelligence,
from the lowest to the highest Manas, from mineral and plant,
up to the holiest archangel (Dhyani-Buddha). The pivotal doctrine
of the Esoteric philosophy admits no privileges or special gifts
in man, save those won by his own Ego through personal effort
and merit throughout a long series of metempsychoses and reincarnations.
This is why the Hindus say that the Universe is Brahma and Brahm&acirc;,
for Brahma is in every atom of the universe, the six principles
in Nature being all the outcome -- the variously differentiated
aspects -- of the SEVENTH and ONE, the only reality in the Universe
whether Cosmical or micro-cosmical; and also why the permutations
(psychic, spiritual and physical), on the plane of manifestation
and form, of the sixth (Brahm&acirc; the vehicle of Brahma) are
viewed by metaphysical

[[Footnote continued from previous page]] spirit, an awkward and
incorrect expression has to be used, for lack of appropriate words
in English. The Vedantins call it Sutratma (Thread-Soul), but
their explanation, too, differs somewhat from that of the occultists;
to explain which difference, however, is left to the Vedantins
themselves.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 18 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
antiphrasis as illusive and Mayavic. For although the root of
every atom individually and of every form collectively, is that
seventh principle or the one Reality, still, in its manifested
phenomenal and temporary appearance, it is no better than an evanescent
illusion of our senses. (See, for clearer definition, Addendum
&quot;Gods, Monads and Atoms,&quot; and also &quot;Theophania,&quot;
&quot;Bodhisatvas and Reincarnation,&quot; etc., etc.)
<P>
In its absoluteness, the One Principle under its two aspects (of
Parabrahmam and Mulaprakriti) is sexless, unconditioned and eternal.
Its periodical (manvantaric) emanation -- or primal radiation
-- is also One, androgynous and phenomenally finite. When the
radiation radiates in its turn, all its radiations are also androgynous,
to become male and female principles in their lower aspects. After
Pralaya, whether the great or the minor Pralaya (the latter leaving
the worlds in <EM>statu quo*</EM>)<EM>, </EM>the first that re-awakes
to active life is the plastic A'kasa, Father-Mother, the Spirit
and Soul of Ether, or the plane on the surface of the Circle.
Space is called the &quot;Mother&quot; before its Cosmic activity,
and Father-Mother at the first stage of re-awakening. (See Comments,
Stanza II.) In the Kabala it is also Father-Mother-Son. But whereas
in the Eastern doctrine, these are the Seventh Principle of the
manifested Universe, or its &quot;Atma-Buddhi-Manas&quot; (Spirit,
Soul, Intelligence), the triad branching off and dividing into
the seven cosmical and seven human principles, in the Western
Kabala of the Christian mystics it is the Triad or Trinity, and
with their occultists, the male-female Jehovah, Jah-Havah. In
this lies the whole difference between the esoteric and the Christian
trinities. The Mystics and the Philosophers, the Eastern and Western
Pantheists, synthesize their pregenetic triad in the pure divine
abstraction. The orthodox, anthropomorphize it. <EM>Hiranyagarbha,
Hari, </EM>and<EM> Sankara</EM> -- the<EM> </EM>three hypostases
of the manifesting &quot;Spirit of the Supreme Spirit&quot; (by
which title Prithivi -- the Earth -- greets Vishnu in his first
Avatar) -- are the purely metaphysical abstract qualities of formation,
preservation, and destruction, and are the three divine Avasthas
(lit. hypostases) of that which &quot;does

* It is not the physical organisms that remain in <EM>statu quo,

Cosmic or even Solar pralayas, but only their Akasic or astral
&quot;photographs.&quot; But during the minor pralayas, once over-taken
by the &quot;Night,&quot; the planets remain intact, though dead,
as a huge animal, caught and embedded in the polar ice, remains
the same for ages.<HR>

<P>
not perish with created things&quot; (or Achyuta, a name of Vishnu);
whereas the orthodox Christian separates his personal creative
Deity into the three personages of the Trinity, and admits of
no higher Deity. The latter, in Occultism, is the abstract Triangle;
with the orthodox, the perfect Cube. The creative god or the aggregate
gods are regarded by the Eastern philosopher as <EM>Bhrantidarsanatah</EM>
--<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>false </EM>apprehension,&quot; something
&quot;conceived of, by reason of erroneous appearances, as a material
form,&quot; and explained as arising from the illusive conception
of the Egotistic personal and human Soul (lower fifth principle).
It is beautifully expressed in a new translation of Vishnu Purana.
&quot;That Brahma in its totality has essentially the aspect of
Prakriti, both evolved and unevolved (Mulaprakriti), and also
the aspect of Spirit and the aspect of Time. Spirit, O twice born,
is the leading aspect of the Supreme Brahma.* The next is a twofold
aspect, -- Prakriti, both evolved and unevolved, and is the time
last.&quot; Kronos is shown in the Orphic theogony as being also
a generated god or agent.
<P>
At this stage of the re-awakening of the Universe, the sacred
symbolism represents it as a perfect Circle with the (root) point
in the Centre. This sign was universal, therefore we find it in
the Kabala also. The Western Kabala, however, now in the hands
of Christian mystics, ignores it altogether, though it is plainly
shown in the Zohar. These sectarians begin at the end, and show
as the symbol of pregenetic Kosmos this sign <IMG SRC="sd1-5a.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">,
calling it &quot;the Union of the Rose and Cross,&quot; the great
mystery of occult generation, from whence the name -- Rosicrucians
(Rose Cross)!
<P>
As may be judged, however, from the most important, as the best
known of the Rosicrucians' symbols, there is one which has never
been hitherto understood even by modern mystics. It is that of
the &quot;Pelican&quot; tearing open its breast to feed its seven
little ones -- the real creed of the Brothers of the Rosie-Cross
and a direct outcome from the Eastern

* Thus Spencer, who, nevertheless, like Schopenhauer and von Hartmann,
only reflects an aspect of the old esoteric philosophers, and
hence lands his readers on the bleak shore of Agnostic despair
-- reverently formulates the grand mystery; &quot;that which persists
unchanging in quantity, but ever changing in form, under these
sensible appearances which the Universe presents to us, is an
unknown and unknowable power, which we are obliged to recognise
as without limit in Space and without beginning or end in time.&quot;
It is only daring Theology -- never Science or philosophy -- which
seeks to gauge the Infinite and unveil the Fathomless and Unknowable.

<P>
Secret Doctrine. Brahma (neuter) is called Kalahansa, meaning,
as explained by Western Orientalists, the Eternal Swan or goose
(see Stanza III., Comment. 8), and so is Brahma, the Creator.
A great mistake is thus brought under notice; it is Brahma (neuter)
who ought to be referred to as Hansa-vahana (He who uses the swan
as his Vehicle) and not Brahma the Creator, who is the real Kalahansa,
while Brahma (neuter) is hamsa, and &quot;A-hamsa,&quot; as will
be explained in the Commentary. Let it be understood that the
terms Brahma and Parabrahmam are not used here because they belong
to our Esoteric nomenclature, but simply because they are more
familiar to the students in the West. Both are the perfect equivalents
of our one, three, and seven vowelled terms, which stand for the
<STRONG>O</STRONG>NE <STRONG>A</STRONG>LL, and the One &quot;All
in all.&quot;

Such are the basic conceptions on which the Secret Doctrine rests.

It would not be in place here to enter upon any defence or proof
of their inherent reasonableness; nor can I pause to show how
they are, in fact, contained -- though too often under a misleading
guise -- in every system of thought or philosophy worthy of the
name.
<P>
Once that the reader has gained a clear comprehension of them
and realised the light which they throw on every problem of life,
they will need no further justification in his eyes, because their
truth will be to him as evident as the sun in heaven. I pass on,
therefore, to the subject matter of the Stanzas as given in this
volume, adding a skeleton outline of them, in the hope of thereby
rendering the task of the student more easy, by placing before
him in a few words the general conception therein explained.
<P>
Stanza I. The history of cosmic evolution, as traced in the Stanzas,
is, so to say, the abstract algebraical formula of that Evolution.
Hence the student must not expect to find there an account of
all the stages and transformations which intervene between the
first beginnings of &quot;Universal&quot; evolution and our present
state. To give such an account would be as impossible as it would
be incomprehensible to men who cannot even grasp the nature of
the plane of existence next to that to which, for the moment,
their consciousness is limited.
<P>
The Stanzas, therefore, give an abstract formula which can be
applied, <EM>mutatis mutandis, </EM>to all evolution: to that
of our tiny earth, to<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 21 PROEM.</H6>

<P>
that of the chain of planets of which that earth forms one, to
the solar Universe to which that chain belongs, and so on, in
an ascending scale, till the mind reels and is exhausted in the
effort.
<P>
The seven Stanzas given in this volume represent the seven terms
of this abstract formula. They refer to, and describe the seven
great stages of the evolutionary process, which are spoken of
in the Puranas as the &quot;Seven Creations,&quot; and in the
Bible as the &quot;Days&quot; of Creation.
<P>
---------------------
<P>
The First Stanza describes the state of the ONE ALL during Pralaya,
before the first flutter of re-awakening manifestation.
<P>
A moment's thought shows that such a state can only be symbolised;
to describe it is impossible. Nor can it be symbolised except
in negatives; for, since it is the state of Absoluteness <EM>per
se, </EM>it can possess none of those specific attributes which
serve us to describe objects in positive terms. Hence that state
can only be suggested by the negatives of all those most abstract
attributes which men feel rather than conceive, as the remotest
limits attainable by their power of conception.
<P>
The stage described in Stanza II. is, to a western mind , so nearly
identical with that mentioned in the first Stanza, that to express
the idea of its difference would require a treatise in itself.
Hence it must be left to the intuition and the higher faculties
of the reader to grasp, as far as he can, the meaning of the allegorical
phrases used. Indeed it must be remembered that all these Stanzas
appeal to the inner faculties rather than to the ordinary comprehension
of the physical brain.
<P>
Stanza III. describes the Re-awakening of the Universe to life
after Pralaya. It depicts the emergence of the &quot;Monads&quot;
from thei[[r]] state of absorption within the ONE; the earliest
and highest stage in the formation of &quot;Worlds,&quot; the
term Monad being one which may apply equally to the vastest Solar
System or the tiniest atom.
<P>
Stanza IV. shows the differentiation of the &quot;Germ&quot; of
the Universe<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 22 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
into the septenary hierarchy of conscious Divine Powers, who are
the active manifestations of the One Supreme Energy. They are
the framers, shapers, and ultimately the creators of all the manifested
Universe, in the only sense in which the name &quot;Creator&quot;
is intelligible; they inform and guide it; they are the intelligent
Beings who adjust and control evolution, embodying in themselves
those manifestations of the ONE LAW, which we know as &quot;The
Laws of Nature.&quot;
<P>
Generically, they are known as the Dhyan Chohans, though each
of the various groups has its own designation in the Secret Doctrine.
<P>
This stage of evolution is spoken of in Hindu mythology as the
&quot;Creation&quot; of the Gods.
<P>
In Stanza V. the process of world-formation is described: ---
First, diffused Cosmic Matter, then the fiery &quot;whirlwind,&quot;
the first stage in the formation of a nebula. That nebula condenses,
and after passing through various transformations, forms a Solar
Universe, a planetary chain, or a single planet, as the case may
be.
<P>
The subsequent stages in the formation of a &quot;World&quot;
are indicated in Stanza VI., which brings the evolution of such
a world down to its fourth great period, corresponding to the
period in which we are now living.
<P>
Stanza VII. continues the history, tracing the descent of life
down to the appearance of Man; and thus closes the first Book
of the Secret Doctrine.
<P>
The development of &quot;Man&quot; from his first appearance on
this earth in this Round to the state in which we now find him
will form the subject of Book II.
<P>

<H4>NOTE.</H4>

<H6>The Stanzas which form the thesis of every section are given
throughout in their modern translated version, as it would be
worse</H6>
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 23 PROEM.</H6>

<P>
than useless to make the subject still more difficult by introducing
the archaic phraseology of the original, with its puzzling style
and words. Extracts are given from the Chinese Thibetan and Sanskrit
translations of the original Senzar Commentaries and Glosses on
the Book of <STRONG>D</STRONG>ZYAN -- these being now rendered
for the first time into a European language. It is almost unnecessary
to state that only portions of the seven Stanzas are here given.
Were they published complete they would remain incomprehensible
to all save the few higher occultists. Nor is there any need to
assure the reader that, no more than most of the profane, does
the writer, or rather the humble recorder, understand those forbidden
passages. To facilitate the reading, and to avoid the too frequent
reference to foot-notes, it was thought best to blend together
texts and glosses, using the Sanskrit and Tibetan proper names
whenever those cannot be avoided, in preference to giving the
originals. The more so as the said terms are all accepted synonyms,
the former only being used between a Master and his chelas (or
disciples).
<P>
Thus, were one to translate into English, using only the substantives
and technical terms as employed in one of the Tibetan and Senzar
versions, Verse I would read as follows: --- &quot;Tho-ag in Zhi-gyu
slept seven Khorlo. Zodmanas zhiba. All Nyug bosom. Konch-hog
not; Thyan-Kam not; Lha-Chohan not; Tenbrel Chugnyi not; Dharmakaya
ceased; Tgenchang not become; Barnang and Ssa in Ngovonyidj; alone
Tho-og Yinsin in night of Sun-chan and Yong-grub (Parinishpanna),
&amp;c., &amp;c.,&quot; which would sound like pure <EM>Abracadabra.</EM>

<P>
As this work is written for the instruction of students of Occultism,
and not for the benefit of philologists, we may well avoid such
foreign terms wherever it is possible to do so. The untranslateable
terms alone, incomprehensible unless explained in their meanings,
are left, but all such terms are rendered in their Sanskrit form.
Needless to remind the reader that these are, in almost every
case, the late developments of the later language, and pertain
to the Fifth Root-Race. Sanskrit, as now known, was not spoken
by the Atlanteans, and most of the philosophical terms used in
the systems of the India of the post-Mahabharatan period are not
found in the Vedas, nor are they to be met with in the original
Stanzas, but only their equivalents. The reader who is not a Theosophist,
is once more invited to regard all that which follows as a fairy
tale, if he likes; at best as one of the yet unproven speculations
of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 24 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
<EM>dreamers; </EM>and, at the worst, as an additional hypothesis
to the many Scientific hypotheses past, present and future, some
exploded, others still lingering. It is not in any sense worse
than are many of the so called Scientific theories; and it is
in every case more philosophical and probable.
<P>
In view of the abundant comments and explanations required, the
references to the footnotes are given in the usual way, while
the sentences to be commented upon are marked with figures. Additional
matter will be found in the Chapters on Symbolism forming Part
II., as well as in Part III., these being often more full of information
than the text.
