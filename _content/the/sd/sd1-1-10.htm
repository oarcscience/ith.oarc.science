The full meaning of this sloka can be fully comprehended only
after reading the detailed additional explanations in the &quot;Anthropogenesis&quot;
and its commentaries, in Book II. Between this Sloka and the last,
Sloka 4 in this same Stanza, extend long ages; and there now gleams
the dawn and sunrise of another aeon. The drama enacted on our
planet is at the beginning of its fourth act, but for a clearer
comprehension of the whole play the reader will have to turn back
before he can proceed onward. For this verse belongs to the general
Cosmogony given in the archaic volumes, whereas Book II. will
give a detailed account of the &quot;Creation&quot; or rather
the formation, of the first human beings, followed by the second
humanity, and then by the third; or, as they are called, &quot;the
first, second, and the third Root-Races.&quot; As the solid Earth
began by being a ball of liquid fire, of fiery dust and its protoplasmic
phantom, so did man.<HR>

<P>
(<EM>a</EM>) That which is meant by the qualification the &quot;Fourth&quot;
is explained as the &quot;fourth Round&quot; only on the authority
of the Commentaries. It can equally mean fourth &quot;Eternity&quot;
as &quot;Fourth Round,&quot; or even the fourth (our) Globe. For,
as will repeatedly be shown, it is the fourth Sphere on the fourth
or lowest plane of material life. And it so happens that we are
in the Fourth Round, at the middle point of which the perfect
equilibrium between Spirit and Matter had to take place.* Says
the Commentary explaining the verse: --
<P>
&quot;<EM>The holy youths </EM>(<EM>the gods</EM>)<EM> refused
to multiply and create species after their likeness</EM>,<EM>
after their kind. They are not fit forms </EM>(<EM>rupas</EM>)<EM>
for us. They have to grow. They refuse to enter the chhayas </EM>(<EM>shadows
or images</EM>)<EM> of their inferiors. Thus had selfish feeling
prevailed from the beginning</EM>,<EM> even among the gods</EM>,<EM>
and they fell under the eye of the Karmic Lipikas.</EM>&quot;
<P>
They had to suffer for it in later births. How the punishment
reached the gods will be seen in the second volume.

<P>
(<EM>a</EM>)<EM> </EM>It is a universal tradition that, before
the physiological &quot;Fall,&quot; propagation of one's kind,
whether human or animal, took place through the WILL of the Creators,
or of their progeny. It was the Fall of Spirit into generation,
not the Fall of mortal man. It has already been stated that, to
become a Self-Conscious Spirit, the latter must pass through every
cycle of being, culminating in its highest point on earth in Man.
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* It was, as we shall see, at this period -- during the highest
point of civilization and knowledge, as also of human intellectuality,
of the fourth, Atlantean Race -- that, owing to the final crisis
of physiologico-spiritual adjustment of the races, humanity branched
off into its two diametrically opposite paths: the RIGHT- and
the LEFT-hand paths of knowledge or of Vidya. &quot;<EM>Thus were
the germs of the White and the Black Magic sown in those days.
The seeds lay latent for some time</EM>,<EM> to sprout only during
the early period of the Fifth </EM>(<EM>our Race</EM>)<EM>.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Commentary.</EM>) <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 193 THE FIRST CAUSE OF SIN.</H6>

<P>
Spirit <EM>per se </EM>is an unconscious negative ABSTRACTION.
Its purity is inherent, not acquired by merit; hence, as already
shown, to become the highest Dhyan Chohan it is necessary for
each Ego to attain to full self-consciousness as a human, <EM>i.e.</EM>,
conscious Being, which is synthesized for us in Man. The Jewish
Kabalists arguing that no Spirit could belong to the divine hierarchy
unless Ruach (Spirit) was united to Nephesh (living Soul), only
repeat the Eastern Esoteric teaching. &quot;A Dhyani has to be
an Atma-Buddhi; once the Buddhi-Manas breaks loose from its immortal
Atma of which it (Buddhi) is the vehicle, Atman passes into NON-BEING,
which is absolute Being.&quot; This means that the purely Nirvanic
state is a passage of Spirit back to the ideal abstraction of
Be-ness which has no relation to the plane on which our Universe
is accomplishing its cycle.
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>)<EM> </EM>&quot;The curse is pronounced&quot; does
not mean, in this instance, that any personal Being, god, or superior
Spirit, pronounced it, but simply that the cause which could but
create bad results had been generated, and that the effects of
a Karmic cause could lead the &quot;Beings&quot; that counteracted
the laws of Nature, and thus impeded her legitimate progress,
only to bad incarnations, hence to suffering.
<P>
(<EM>c</EM>) &quot;There were many wars&quot; refers to several
struggles of adjustment, spiritual, cosmical, and astronomical,
but chiefly to the mystery of the evolution of man as he is now.
Powers -- pure Essences -- &quot;that were told to create&quot;
is a sentence that relates to a mystery explained, as already
said, elsewhere. It is not only one of the most hidden secrets
of Nature -- that of generation, over whose solution the Embryologists
have vainly put their heads together -- but likewise a divine
function that involves that other religious, or rather dogmatic,
mystery, the &quot;Fall&quot; of the Angels, as it is called.
Satan and his rebellious host would thus prove, when the meaning
of the allegory is explained, to have refused to create physical
man, only to become the direct Saviours and the Creators of &quot;<EM>divine
</EM>Man.&quot; The symbolical teaching is more than mystical
and religious, it is purely scientific, as will be seen later
on. For, instead of remaining a mere blind, functioning medium,
impelled and guided by fathomless LAW, the &quot;rebellious&quot;
Angel claimed and enforced his right of independent judgment and
will, his<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 194 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
right of free-agency and responsibility, since man and angel are
alike under Karmic Law.*
<P>
&quot;And there was war in Heaven. . . . Michael and his angels
fought against the Dragon; and the Dragon fought and his angels,
and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in Heaven.
And the Dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil
and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.&quot;
<P>
The Kabalistic version of the same story is given in the Codex
Nazareus, the scripture of the Nazarenes, the real mystic Christians
of John the Baptist and the Initiates of Christos. Bahak-Zivo,
the &quot;Father of the Genii,&quot; is ordered to construct creatures
(to create). But, as he is &quot;ignorant of Orcus,&quot; he fails
to do so, and calls in Fetahil, a still purer spirit, to his aid,
who fails still worse. This is a repetition of the failure of
the &quot;Fathers,&quot; the lords of light who fail one after
the other. (Book II, Sloka 17.)
<P>
We will now quote from our earlier Volumes: --
<P>
&quot;Then steps on the stage of creation the spirit** (of the
Earth so-called, or the Soul, Psyche, which St. James calls 'devilish')
the lower portion the <EM>Anima Mundi </EM>or Astral Light. (See
the close of this Sloka). With the Nazarenes and the Gnostics
this Spirit was
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Explaining Kabalistic views, the author of the &quot;<EM>New
Aspects of Life</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>says of the Fallen Angels
that, &quot;According to the symbolical teaching, Spirit, from
being simply a functionary agent of God, became volitional in
its developed and developing action; and, substituting its own
will for the Divine desire in its regard, so fell. Hence the Kingdom
and reign of Spirits and spiritual action, which flow from and
are the product of Spirit-volition, are outside, and contrasted
with, and in contradiction to the Kingdom of Souls and Divine
action.&quot; So far, so good; but what does the Author mean by
saying, &quot;When man was created, he was human in constitution,
with human affections, human hopes and aspirations. From this
state he fell -- into the brute and savage&quot;? This is diametrically
opposite to our Eastern teaching, and even to the Kabalistic notion
so far as we understand it, and to the Bible itself. This looks
like Corporealism and Substantialism colouring positive philosophy,
though it is rather hard to feel quite sure of the Author's meaning
(see p. 235). A FALL, however, &quot;from the natural into the
supernatural and the animal&quot; -- supernatural meaning the
purely spiritual in this case -- means what we suggest.
<P>
** On the authority of Irenaeus, of Justin Martyr and the &quot;Codex&quot;
itself, Dunlap shows that the Nazarenes regarded &quot;Spirit&quot;
as a female and <EM>Evil Power </EM>in its connection with our
Earth. (Dunlap: &quot;Sod,&quot; the Son of the Man, p. 52).<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 195 THE CODEX REPEATS THE ALLEGORY.</H6>

<P>
<EM>feminine. </EM>Thus the spirit of the Earth perceiving that
for Fetahil,* the <EM>newest man </EM>(the latest), the splendour
was 'changed,' and that for splendour existed 'decrease and damage,'
she awakes Karabtanos,** 'who was frantic and <EM>without sense
and judgment</EM>,'<EM> </EM>and says to him: -- 'Arise, see,
the splendour (light) of the <EM>newest </EM>man (Fetahil) has
failed (to produce or create men), the decrease of this splendour
is visible. Rise up, come with thy MOTHER (the Spiritus) and free
thee from limits by which thou art held, and those more ample
than the whole world.' After which follows the union of the frantic
and blind matter, guided by the insinuations of the spirit (not
the <EM>Divine </EM>breath but the <EM>Astral </EM>spirit, which
by its double essence is already tainted with matter); and the
offer of the MOTHER being accepted, the Spiritus conceives &quot;Seven
Figures,&quot; and the seven <EM>stellars </EM>(planets) which
represent also the <EM>seven capital sins</EM>,<EM> </EM>the<EM>
</EM>progeny of an astral soul separated from its divine source
(spirit) and <EM>matter</EM>,<EM> </EM>the blind demon of concupiscence.
Seeing this, Fetahil extends his hand towards the abyss of matter,
and says: -- 'Let the Earth exist, just as the abode of the powers
has existed.' Dipping his hand in the chaos, which he condenses,
he creates our planet.***&quot;
<P>
&quot;Then the Codex proceeds to tell how Bahak-Zivo was separated
from the Spiritus, and the Genii or angels from the rebels.****
Then Mano***** (the greatest), who dwells with the greatest FERHO,
call Kebar-Zivo (known also by the name of Nebat-Iavar bar Iufin
Ifafin), Helm and <EM>Vine </EM>of the food of life,****** he
being the third life, and commiserating the rebellious and foolish
Genii, on account of the magnitude of their ambition, says: 'Lord
of the Genii******* (AEons), see what the Genii, the

<P>
* Fetahil is identical with the host of the Pitris who &quot;created
Man&quot; as only a &quot;shell.&quot; He was, with the Nazarenes,
the king of light, and the creator; but in this instance he is
the unlucky Prometheus, who fails to get hold of the Living Fire
necessary for the formation of the divine Soul, as he is ignorant
of the secret name, the ineffable or incommunicable name of the
Kabalists.

say, 'Let us call for the world, and let us call the 'powers'
into existence.&quot; The Genii are the <EM>Principes</EM>,<EM>

<P>
And in order to counteract the influence of the seven &quot;badly
disposed&quot; principles, the progeny of <EM>Spiritus</EM>,<EM>
</EM>CABAR-ZIO, the mighty Lord of Splendor, produces <EM>seven
other lives </EM>(the cardinal virtues) who shine in their own
form and light &quot;from on high&quot;*** and thus re-establish
the balance between good and evil, light and darkness.
<P>
Here one finds a repetition of the early <EM>allegorical</EM>,<EM>
</EM>dual systems, as the Zoroastrian, and detects a germ of the
dogmatic and dualistic religions of the future, a germ which has
grown into such a luxuriant tree in ecclesiastical Christianity.
It is already the outline of the two &quot;Supremes&quot; -- God
and Satan. But in the Stanzas no such idea exists.
<P>
Most of the Western Christian Kabalists -- pre-eminently Eliphas
Levi -- in their desire to reconcile the Occult Sciences with
Church dogmas, did their best to make of the &quot;Astral Light&quot;
only and preeminently the <EM>Pleroma </EM>of early Church Fathers,
the abode of the Hosts of the Fallen Angels, of the &quot;Archons&quot;
and &quot;Powers.&quot; But the Astral Light, while only the lower
aspect of the Absolute, is yet dual. It is the <EM>Anima Mundi</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and ought never to be viewed otherwise, except for Kabalistic
purposes. The difference which exists between its &quot;light&quot;
and its &quot;Living Fire&quot; ought to be ever present in the
mind of the Seer and the &quot;Psychic.&quot; The higher aspect,
without which only creatures of matter from that Astral Light
can be produced, is this Living Fire, and it is the Seventh Principle.
It is said in &quot;Isis Unveiled,&quot; in a complete description
of it: --
<P>
&quot;The Astral Light or <EM>Anima Mundi </EM>is dual and bisexual.
The (ideal) male part of it is purely divine and spiritual, it
is the <EM>Wisdom</EM>,<EM> </EM>it is Spirit or Purusha; while
the female portion (the Spiritus of the Nazarenes) is tainted,
in one sense, with matter, <EM>is </EM>indeed matter, and therefore
is evil already. It is the life-principle of every living creature,
and furnishes the astral soul, the fluidic <EM>perisprit</EM>,<EM>
</EM>to men, animals, fowls of the air, and everything living.
Animals have only the latent germ of the highest immortal soul
in them. . . . . This latter will develop

evolution is contained in the Kabalistic axiom: 'A stone becomes
a plant; a plant, a beast; a beast, a man; a man, a spirit; and
the spirit, a god.'&quot; (Vol. I., p. 301, note.)
<P>
The seven principles of the Eastern Initiates had not been explained
when &quot;Isis&quot; was written, but only the three <EM>Kabalistic
Faces </EM>of the semi-exoteric Kabala.* But these contain the
description of the mystic natures of the first group of Dhyan
Chohans in the <EM>regimen ignis</EM>,<EM> </EM>the region and
&quot;rule (or government) of fire,&quot; which group is divided
into three classes, synthesized by the first, which makes <EM>four

he will find the same progression in the angelic natures, viz.,
from the <EM>passive </EM>down to the <EM>active</EM>,<EM> </EM>the

(the region or plane wherein <EM>Egoship </EM>or<EM> </EM>the
feeling of <EM>I-am-ness </EM>is beginning to be defined) as the
first ones are near to the undifferentiated essence. The former
are Arupa, incorporeal; the latter, Rupa, corporeal.

</EM>the philosophical systems of the Gnostics and the primitive
Jewish Christians, the Nazarenes and the Ebionites, are fully
considered. They show the views held in those days -- outside
the circle of Mosaic Jews -- about Jehovah. He was identified
by all the Gnostics with the evil, rather than with the good principle.
For them, he was <EM>Ilda-Baoth</EM>,<EM> </EM>&quot;the son of
Darkness,&quot; whose mother, Sophia Achamoth, was the daughter
of Sophia, the Divine Wisdom (the female Holy Ghost of the early
Christians) -- Akasa;** while Sophia Achamoth personified the
lower Astral Light or <EM>Ether. </EM>Ilda-Baoth,*** or Jehovah,

and the psychic -- the super-ethereal or connecting link between
matter and pure spirit, and the physical. See for the difference

creative Spirits, and one of the lower Sephiroth. He produces
from himself seven other Gods, &quot;Stellar Spirits&quot; (or
the lunar ancestors*), for they are all the same.** They are all
<EM>in his own image </EM>(the &quot;Spirits of the Face&quot;),
and the reflections one of the other, and have become darker and
more material as they successively receded from their originator.
They also inhabit seven regions disposed like a ladder, as its
rungs slope up and down the scale of spirit and matter.*** With
Pagans and Christians, with Hindus and Chaldeans, with the Greek
as with the Roman Catholics -- with a slight variation of the
texts in their interpretations -- they all were the Genii of the
seven planets, as of the seven planetary spheres of our septenary
chain, of which Earth is the lowest. (See<EM> Isis</EM>,<EM> Vol.
II. p. </EM>186.) This connects the &quot;Stellar&quot; and &quot;Lunar&quot;
Spirits with the higher planetary Angels and the <EM>Saptarishis
</EM>(the seven Rishis of the Stars) of the Hindus -- as subordinate
Angels (Messengers) to these &quot;Rishis,&quot; the emanations,
on the descending scale, of the former. Such, in the opinion of
the philosophical Gnostics, were the God and the Archangels now
worshipped by the Christians! The &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; and
the legend of the &quot;War in Heaven&quot; is thus purely pagan
in its origin and comes from India <EM>via</EM> Persia and Chaldea.
The only reference to it in the Christian canon is found in Revelations
xii., as quoted a few pages back.
<P>
Thus &quot;<STRONG>S</STRONG>ATAN,&quot; once he ceases to be
viewed in the superstitious, dogmatic, unphilosophical spirit
of the Churches, grows into the grandiose image of one who made
of <EM>terrestrial a divine </EM>MAN; who gave him, throughout
the long cycle of Maha-kalpa the law of the Spirit of Life, and
made him free from the Sin of Ignorance, hence of death. (See
the Section <EM>On Satan </EM>in Part II. Vol. II.)

(<EM>a</EM>) Here, having finished for the time being with our
side-issues -- which, however they may break the flow of the narrative,
are necessary for the elucidation of the whole scheme -- the reader
must return once more to Cosmogony. The phrase &quot;Older wheels&quot;
refers to the worlds or Globes of our chain as they were during
the &quot;previous Rounds.&quot; The present Stanza, when explained
esoterically, is found embodied entirely in the Kabalistic works.
Therein will be found the very history of the evolution of those
countless Globes which evolve after a periodical Pralaya, rebuilt
from old material into new forms. The previous Globes disintegrate
and reappear transformed and perfected for a new phase of life.
In the Kabala, worlds are compared to sparks which fly from under
the hammer of the great Architect -- LAW, the law which rules
all the smaller Creators.
<P>
The following comparative diagram shows the identity between the
two systems, the Kabalistic and the Eastern. The three upper are
the three higher planes of consciousness, revealed and explained
in both schools only to the Initiates, the lower ones represent
the four lower planes -- the lowest being our plane, or the visible
Universe.
<P>
These seven <EM>planes </EM>correspond to the seven <EM>states
</EM>of consciousness in man. It remains with him to attune the
three higher states in himself to the three higher planes in Kosmos.
But before he can attempt to attune, he must awaken the three
&quot;seats&quot; to life and activity. And how many are capable
of bringing themselves to even a superficial comprehension of

allegorized -- if one likes -- in the shape of the Spirit of Creative
Fire or Heat. If, rejecting the poetical form and allegory, science
chooses to see in this the primordial Fire-Mist, it is welcome
to do so. Whether one way or the other, whether Fohat or the famous
FORCE of Science, nameless, and as difficult of definition as
our Fohat himself, that Something &quot;caused the Universe to
move with circular motion,&quot; as Plato has it; or, as the Occult
teaching expresses it:
<P>
&quot;<EM>The Central Sun causes Fohat to collect primordial dust
in the form of balls</EM>,<EM> to impel them to move in converging
lines and finally to approach each other and aggregate.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Book of Dzyan</EM>) . . . . . &quot;<EM>Being scattered
in Space</EM>,<EM> without order or system</EM>,<EM> the world-germs
come into frequent collision until their final aggregation</EM>,<EM>
after which they become wanderers </EM>(<EM>Comets</EM>)<EM>.
Then the battles and struggles begin. The older </EM>(<EM>bodies</EM>)<EM>
attract the younger</EM>,<EM> while others repel them. Many perish</EM>,<EM>
devoured by their stronger companions. Those that escape become
worlds.</EM>&quot;<EM>**</EM>

* To see and appreciate the difference -- the immense gulf that
separates terrestrial matter from the finer grades of supersensuous
matter -- every astronomer, every chemist and <EM>physicist </EM>ought
to be a <EM>psychometer</EM>,<EM> </EM>to say the least; he ought
to be able to sense for himself that difference in which he now
refuses to believe. Mrs. Elizabeth Denton, one of the most learned,
and also one of the most materialistic and sceptical women of
her age -- the wife of Professor Denton, the well-known American
geologist and the author of &quot;The Soul of Things&quot; --
was, nevertheless, one of the most wonderful psychometers some
years ago. This is what she described in one of her experiments;
with a particle of a meteorite placed on her forehead, in an envelope,
the lady, not being aware of what it contained, said:
<P>
&quot;What a difference between that which we recognise as matter
here and that which seems like matter there! In the one, the <EM>elements
are so coarse and so angular</EM>,<EM> </EM>I wonder that we can
endure it all, much more that we can desire to continue our present
relations to it; in the other, all the elements are so refined,
they are so free from those great, rough angularities, which characterize
the elements here, that I can but regard that as by so much the
more than this, the real existence.&quot; (<EM>Vol. III. p.</EM>

as scientific as Science could make it, even at our late period.

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 202 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
We have been assured that there exist several modern works of
speculative fancy upon such struggles for life in sidereal heaven,
especially in the German language. We rejoice to hear it, for
ours is an Occult teaching lost in the darkness of archaic ages.
We have treated of it fully in &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>and the idea of Darwinian-like evolution, of struggle for
life and supremacy, and of the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;
among the Hosts above as the Hosts below, runs throughout both
the volumes of our earlier work, written in 1876 (<EM>See Index
in </EM>&quot;<EM>Isis</EM> <EM>Unveiled</EM>&quot;<EM> at the
words </EM>&quot;<EM>Evolution</EM>&quot; --<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Darwin</EM>&quot;
--<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Kapila</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>--<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Battle
of</EM> <EM>Life</EM>,&quot;<EM> etc. etc.</EM>) But the idea
was not ours, it is that of antiquity.
<P>
Even the Puranic writers have ingeniously interwoven allegory
with Cosmic facts and human events. Any symbologist may discern
the astro-cosmical allusion even though he be unable to grasp
the whole meaning. The great &quot;Wars in Heaven,&quot; in the
Puranas; the wars of the Titans, in Hesiod and other classical
writers; the &quot;struggles,&quot; also in the Egyptian legend
between Osiris and Typhon, and even those in the Scandinavian
legends, all refer to the same subject. Northern Mythology refers
to it as the battle of the Flames, the sons of Muspel who fought
on the field of Wigred. All these relate to Heaven and Earth,
and have a double and often even a triple meaning, and esoteric
application to things above as to things below. They relate severally
to astronomical, theogonical and human struggles; to the adjustment
of orbs, and the supremacy among nations and tribes. The &quot;Struggle
for Existence&quot; and the &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;
reigned supreme from the moment that Kosmos manifested into being,
and could hardly escape the observant eye of the ancient Sages.
Hence the incessant fights of Indra, the god of the Firmament,
with the Asuras -- degraded from high gods into Cosmic demons;
and with Vritri or Ah-hi; the battles fought between stars and
constellations, between Moon and planets -- later on incarnated
as kings and mortals. Hence also the War in Heaven of Michael
and his Host against the Dragon (Jupiter and Lucifer-Venus), when
a third of the stars of the rebellious host was hurled down into
Space, and &quot;its place was found no more in Heaven.&quot;
As said long ago -- &quot;This is the basic and fundamental stone
of the secret cycles. It shows that the Brahmins and Tanaim .
. . speculated on the creation and development of the world quite
in a Darwinian way, both anticipating him and his school in the
natural selection of species, the survival of the fittest,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 203 THE BIRTH OF THE WORLDS.</H6>

<P>
and transformation. . . . There were old worlds that perished
conquered by the new,&quot; etc., etc. (&quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>,&quot;<EM>
Vol. II.</EM>,<EM> p. </EM>260.) The assertion that all the worlds
(Stars, planets, etc.) -- as soon as a nucleus of primordial substance
in the <EM>laya</EM> (undifferentiated) state is informed by the
freed principles, of a just <EM>deceased </EM>sidereal body --
become first comets, and then Suns to cool down to inhabitable
worlds, is a teaching as old as the Rishis.
<P>
Thus the Secret Books distinctly teach, as we see, an astronomy
that would not be rejected even by modern speculation could the
latter thoroughly understand its teachings.
<P>
For, archaic astronomy, and the ancient, physical and mathematical
sciences, expressed views identical with those of modern science,
and many of far more momentous import. A &quot;struggle for life&quot;
as a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; in the worlds above,
as on our planet here below, are distinctly taught. This teaching,
however, although it would not be &quot;entirely rejected&quot;
by Science, is sure to be repudiated as an integral whole. For
it avers that there are only seven Self-born primordial &quot;gods&quot;
emanated from the trinitarian ONE. In other words, it means that
all the worlds or sidereal bodies (always on strict analogy) are
formed one from the other, after the primordial manifestation
at the beginning of the &quot;Great Age&quot; is accomplished.
The birth of the celestial bodies in Space is compared to a crowd
or multitude of &quot;pilgrims&quot; at the festival of the &quot;Fires.&quot;
Seven ascetics appear on the threshold of the temple with seven
lighted sticks of incense. At the light of these the first row
of pilgrims light their incense sticks. After which every ascetic
begins whirling his stick around his head in space, and furnishes
the rest with fire. Thus with the heavenly bodies. A laya-centre
is lighted and awakened into life by the fires of another &quot;pilgrim,&quot;
after which the new &quot;centre&quot; rushes into space and becomes
a comet. It is only after losing its velocity, and hence its fiery
tail, that the &quot;Fiery Dragon&quot; settles down into quiet
and steady life as a regular respectable citizen of the sidereal
family. Therefore it is said: --
<P>
Born in the unfathomable depths of Space, out of the homogeneous
Element called the World-Soul, every nucleus of Cosmic matter,
suddenly launched into being, begins life under the most hostile
circumstances. Through a series of countless ages, it has to conquer
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 204 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
for itself a place in the infinitudes. It circles round and round
between denser and already fixed bodies, moving by jerks, and
pulling towards some given point or centre that attracts it, trying
to avoid, like a ship drawn into a channel dotted with reefs and
sunken rocks, other bodies that draw and repel it in turn; many
perish, their mass disintegrating through stronger masses, and,
when born within a system, chiefly within the insatiable stomachs
of various Suns. (<EM>See Comm. to Stanza IV</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Those
which move slower and are propelled into an elliptic course are
doomed to annihilation sooner or later. Others moving in parabolic
curves generally escape destruction, owing to their velocity.
<P>
Some very critical readers will perhaps imagine that this teaching,
as to the cometary stage passed through by all heavenly bodies,
is in contradiction with the statements just made as to the moon
being the mother of the earth. They will perhaps fancy that intuition
is needed to harmonize the two. But no intuition is in truth required.
What does Science know of Comets, their genesis, growth, and ultimate
behaviour? Nothing -- absolutely nothing! And what is there so
impossible that a laya centre -- a lump of cosmic protoplasm,
homogeneous and latent, when suddenly animated or fired up --
should rush from its bed in Space and whirl throughout the abysmal
depths in order to strengthen its homogeneous organism by an accumulation
and addition of differentiated elements? And why should not such
a comet settle in life, live, and become an inhabited globe!
<P>
&quot;The abodes of Fohat are many,&quot; it is said. &quot;He
places his four fiery (electro-positive) Sons in the &quot;Four
circles&quot;; these <EM>Circles </EM>are the Equator, the Ecliptic,
and the two parallels of declination, or the tropics -- to preside
over the <EM>climates </EM>of which are placed the Four mystical
Entities. Then again: &quot;Other seven (sons) are commissioned
to preside over the seven hot, and seven cold <EM>lokas </EM>(the
hells of the orthodox Brahmins) at the two ends of the Egg of
Matter (our Earth and its poles). The seven <EM>lokas </EM>are
also called the &quot;Rings,&quot; elsewhere, and the &quot;Circles.&quot;
The ancients made the polar circles <EM>seven </EM>instead of
two, as Europeans do; for Mount Meru, which is the North Pole,
is said to have seven gold and seven silver steps leading to it.
<P>
The strange statement made in one of the Stanzas: &quot;The Songs
of Fohat and his Sons were <EM>radiant </EM>as the noon-tide Sun
and the Moon combined;&quot; and that the four Sons on the <EM>middle
</EM>four-fold<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 205 SEEING SOUND, HEARING COLOURS.</H6>

<P>
Circle &quot;<EM>saw </EM>their father's songs and <EM>heard </EM>his
Solar-selenic radiance;&quot; is explained in the Commentary in
these words: &quot;The agitation of <EM>the Fohatic </EM>Forces
at the two cold ends (North and South Poles) of the Earth which
resulted in a multicoloured radiance at night, have in them several
of the properties of Akasa (Ether) <EM>colour </EM>and sound as
well.&quot; . . . . . . &quot;Sound is the characteristic of Akasa
(Ether): it generates air, the property of which is Touch; which
(by friction) becomes productive of Colour and Light.&quot; .
. . . . . (Vishnu Purana.)
<P>
Perhaps the above will be regarded as archaic nonsense, but it
will be better comprehended, if the reader remembers the Aurora
Borealis and Australis, both of which take place at the very centres
of terrestrial electric and magnetic forces. The two poles are
said to be the store-houses, the receptacles and liberators, at
the same time, of Cosmic and terrestrial Vitality (Electricity);
from the surplus of which the Earth, had it not been for these
two natural &quot;safety-valves,&quot; would have been rent to
pieces long ago. At the same time it is now a theory that has
lately become an axiom, that the phenomenon of polar lights is
accompanied by, and productive of, strong sounds, like whistling,
hissing, and cracking. (But see Professor Trumholdt's works on
the Aurora Borealis, and his correspondence regarding this moot
question.)

To calculate its age, however, as the pupil is asked to do in
the Stanza, is rather difficult, since we are not given the figures
of the Great Kalpa, and are not allowed to publish those of our
small Yugas, except as to the approximate duration of these. &quot;The
older wheels rotated for one Eternity and one half of an Eternity,&quot;
it says. We know that by &quot;Eternity&quot; the seventh part
of 311,040,000,000,000 years, or an age of Brahma is meant. But
what of that? We also know that, to begin with, if we take for
our basis the above figures, we have first of all to eliminate
from the 100 years of Brahma (or 311,040,000,000,000 years) two
<EM>years </EM>taken up by the Sandhyas (twilights), which leaves
98, as we have to bring it to the mystical combination 14 x 7.
But <I>we </I>have no knowledge at what time precisely the evolution
and formation of our little earth began. Therefore it is impossible
to calculate its age, unless the time of its birth is given --
which the TEACHERS refuse to do, so far. At the close of this
Book and in Book II., however, some chronological hints will be
given. We must remember, moreover, that the law of Analogy holds
good for the worlds, as it does for man; and that as &quot;The
ONE (Deity) becomes Two (Deva or Angel) and <EM>Two</EM> becomes<EM>
Three </EM>(or man),&quot; etc., etc., so we are taught that the
<EM>Curds </EM>(world-stuff) become wanderers, (Comets), these
become stars, and the stars (the centres of vortices) <EM>our
sun and planets</EM> -- to put it briefly.*
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>) There are four grades of initiation mentioned in
exoteric works, which are known respectively in Sanskrit as &quot;Srotapanna,&quot;
&quot;Sagardagan,&quot; &quot;Anagamin,&quot; and &quot;Arhan&quot;
-- the four paths to Nirvana, in this, our fourth Round, bearing
the same appellations. The Arhan, though he can see the Past,
the Present, and the Future, is not yet the highest Initiate;
for the Adept himself, the <EM>initiated </EM>candidate, becomes
chela (pupil) to a higher Initiate. Three further higher grades
have to be conquered by the Arhan who would reach the apex of
the ladder of Arhatship. There are those who have reached it even
in this fifth race of ours, but the faculties necessary for the
attainment of these higher

grades will be fully developed in the average ascetic only at
the end of this Root-Race, and in the Sixth and Seventh. Thus
there will always be Initiates and the Profane till the end of
this minor Manvantara, the present <EM>life-cycle. </EM>The<EM>
Arhats </EM>of the &quot;fire-mist&quot; of the 7th rung are but
one remove from the Root-Base of their Hierarchy -- the highest
on Earth, and our Terrestrial chain. This &quot;Root-Base&quot;
has a name which can only be translated by several compound words
into English&quot; -- &quot;the ever-living-human-Banyan.&quot;
This &quot;Wondrous Being&quot; descended from a &quot;high region,&quot;
they say, in the early part of the Third Age, before the separation
of the sexes of the Third Race.
<P>
This Third Race is sometimes called collectively &quot;the Sons
of <EM>Passive Yoga</EM>,&quot;<EM> i.e.</EM>, it was produced
unconsciously by the second Race, which, as it was intellectually
inactive, is supposed to have been constantly plunged in a kind
of blank or abstract contemplation, as required by the conditions
of the Yoga state. In the first or earlier portion of the existence
of this third race, while it was yet in its state of purity, the
&quot;Sons of Wisdom,&quot; who, as will be seen, incarnated in
this Third Race, produced by <EM>Kriyasakti </EM>a progeny called
the &quot;Sons of Ad&quot; or &quot;of the Fire-Mist,&quot; the
&quot;Sons of Will and Yoga,&quot; etc. They were a conscious
production, as a portion of the race was already animated with
the divine spark of spiritual, superior intelligence. It was not
a Race, this progeny. It was at first a wondrous Being, called
the &quot;Initiator,&quot; and after him a group of semi-divine
and semi-human beings. &quot;<EM>Set apart</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>in
Archaic <EM>genesis </EM>for certain purposes, they are those
in whom are said to have incarnated the highest Dhyanis, &quot;Munis
and Rishis from previous Manvantaras&quot; -- <EM>to</EM> <EM>form
the nursery for future human adepts</EM>,<EM> </EM>on this earth
and during the present cycle. These &quot;Sons of Will and Yoga&quot;
born, so to speak, in an immaculate way, remained, it is explained,
entirely apart from the rest of mankind.
<P>
The &quot;<STRONG>B</STRONG>EING&quot; just referred to, which
has to remain nameless, is the <EM>Tree </EM>from which, in subsequent
ages, all the great <EM>historically </EM>known Sages and Hierophants,
such as the Rishi Kapila, Hermes, Enoch, Orpheus, etc., etc.,
have branched off. As objective <EM>man</EM>,<EM> </EM>he is the
mysterious (to the profane -- the ever invisible) yet ever present
Personage about whom legends are rife in the East, especially
among the Occultists and the students of the Sacred Science. It
is he who changes form, yet remains ever the same. And it is he
again who holds spiritual sway over the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 208 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
<EM>initiated </EM>Adepts throughout the whole world. He is, as
said, the &quot;Nameless One&quot; who has so many names, and
yet whose names and whose very nature are unknown. He is <I>the
</I>&quot;Initiator,&quot; called the &quot;GREAT SACRIFICE.&quot;
For, sitting at the threshold of LIGHT, he looks into it from
within the circle of Darkness, which he will not cross; nor will
he quit his post till the last day of this life-cycle. Why does
the solitary Watcher remain at his self-chosen post? Why does
he sit by the fountain of primeval Wisdom, of which he drinks
no longer, as he has naught to learn which he does not know --
aye, neither on this Earth, nor in its heaven? Because the lonely,
sore-footed pilgrims on their way back to their <EM>home </EM>are
never sure to the last moment of not losing their way in this
limitless desert of illusion and matter called Earth-Life. Because
he would fain show the way to that region of freedom and light,
from which he is a voluntary exile himself, to every prisoner
who has succeeded in liberating himself from the bonds of flesh
and illusion. Because, in short, he has sacrificed himself for
the sake of mankind, though but a few Elect may profit by the
GREAT SACRIFICE.
<P>
It is under the direct, silent guidance of this <STRONG>M</STRONG>AHA
-- (great) -- <STRONG>G</STRONG>URU that all the other less divine
Teachers and instructors of mankind became, from the first awakening
of human consciousness, the guides of early Humanity. It is through
these &quot;Sons of God&quot; that infant humanity got its first
notions of all the arts and sciences, as well as of spiritual
knowledge; and it is they who have laid the first foundation-stone
of those ancient civilizations that puzzle so sorely our modern
generation of students and scholars.*
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* Let those who doubt this statement explain the mystery of the
extraordinary knowledge possessed by the ancients -- alleged to
have developed from lower and animal-like savages, the <EM>cave-men
</EM>of the Palaeolithic age -- on any other equally reasonable
grounds. Let them turn to such works as those of Vitruvius Pollio
of the Augustan age, on architecture, for instance, in which all
the rules of proportion are those <EM>taught anciently at initiations</EM>,<EM>
</EM>if he would acquaint himself with the truly divine art, and
understand the <EM>deep esoteric significance hidden in every
rule and law of proportion. </EM>No man descended from a Palaeolithic
cave-dweller could ever evolve such a science unaided, even in
millenniums of thought and intellectual evolution. It is the pupils
of those incarnated Rishis and Devas of the third Root Race, who
handed their knowledge from one generation to another, to Egypt
and Greece with its now lost <EM>canon of proportion; </EM>as
it is the Disciples of the Initiates of the 4th, the Atlanteans,
who handed it over to their <EM>Cyclopes</EM>,<EM> </EM>the &quot;Sons
of Cycles&quot; or of the &quot;Infinite,&quot; from whom the
name passed to the still later generations of Gnostic priests.
&quot;It is owing to the divine perfection [[Footnote continued

<P>
Although these matters were barely hinted at in &quot;<EM>Isis
Unveiled</EM>,&quot; it<EM> </EM>will be well to remind the reader
of what was said in Vol. I., pp. 587 to 593, concerning a certain
Sacred Island in Central Asia, and to refer him for further details
to the chapter in Book II. on &quot;The Sons of God and the Sacred
Island.&quot; A few more explanations, however, though thrown
out in a fragmentary form, may help the student to obtain a glimpse
into the present mystery.
<P>
To state at least one detail concerning these mysterious &quot;Sons
of God&quot; in plain words. It is from them, these Brahmaputras,
that the high Dwijas, the initiated Brahmins of old justly claimed
descent, while the modern Brahmin would have the lowest castes
believe literally that they issued direct from the mouth of Brahma.
This is the esoteric teaching, which adds moreover that, although
these descendants (spiritually of course) from the &quot;sons
of Will and Yoga,&quot; became in time divided into opposite sexes,
as their &quot;<EM>Kriyasakti</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>progenitors
did themselves, later on; yet even their degenerate descendants
have down to the present day retained a veneration and respect
for the creative

[[Footnote continued from previous page]] of those architectural
proportions that the Ancients could build those wonders of all
the subsequent ages, their Fanes, Pyramids, Cave-Temples, Cromlechs,
Cairns, Altars, proving they had the powers of machinery and a
knowledge of mechanics to which modern skill is like a child's
play, and which that <EM>skill </EM>refers to itself as the 'works
of hundred-handed giants.'&quot; (<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Book
of God</EM>,&quot;<EM> Kenealy.</EM>)<EM> </EM>Modern architects
may not altogether have neglected those rules, but they have superadded
enough empirical innovations to destroy those just proportions.
It is Vitruvius who gave to posterity the rules of construction
of the Grecian temples erected to the immortal gods; and the ten
books of Marcus Vitruvius Pollio on Architecture, of one, in short,
<EM>who was an initiate</EM>,<EM> </EM>can only be studied esoterically.
The Druidical circles, the Dolmen, the Temples of India, Egypt
and Greece, the Towers and the 127 towns in Europe which were
found &quot;Cyclopean in origin&quot; by the French Institute,
are all the work of initiated Priest-Architects, the descendants
of those primarily taught by the &quot;Sons of God,&quot; justly
called &quot;The Builders.&quot; This is what appreciative posterity
says of those descendants. &quot;They used neither mortar nor
cement, nor steel nor iron to cut the stones with; and yet they
were so artfully wrought that in many places the joints are not
seen, though many of the stones, as in Peru, are 18 ft. thick,
and in the walls of the fortress of Cuzco there are stones of
a still greater size.&quot; (<EM>Acosta</EM>,<EM> </EM>vi., 14.)
&quot;Again, the walls of Syene, built 5,400 years ago, when that
spot was exactly under the tropic, which it has now ceased to
be, were so constructed that at noon, at the precise moment of
the solar solstice, the entire disc of the Sun was seen reflected
on their surface -- a work which the united skill of all the astronomers
of Europe would not now be able to effect.&quot; -- (Kenealy,

function, and still regard it in the light of a religious ceremony,
whereas the more civilized nations consider it as a mere animal
function. Compare the western views and practice in these matters
with the Institutions of Manu in regard to the laws of Grihasta
and married life. The true Brahmin is thus indeed &quot;he whose
seven forefathers have drunk the juice of the moon-plant (Soma),&quot;
and who is a &quot;Trisuparna,&quot; for he has understood the
secret of the Vedas.
<P>
And, to this day, such Brahmins know that, during its early beginnings,
psychic and physical intellect being dormant and consciousness
still undeveloped, the spiritual conceptions of that race were
quite unconnected with its physical surroundings. That <EM>divine
</EM>man dwelt in his animal -- though externally human -- form;
and, if there was instinct in him, no self-consciousness came
to enlighten the darkness of the latent fifth principle. When,
moved by the law of Evolution, the Lords of Wisdom infused into
him the spark of consciousness, the first feeling it awoke to
life and activity was a sense of solidarity, of one-ness with
his spiritual creators. As the child's first feeling is for its
mother and nurse, so the first aspirations of the awakening consciousness
in primitive man were for those whose element he felt within himself,
and who yet were outside, and independent of him. <STRONG>D</STRONG>EVOTION
arose out of that feeling, and became the first and foremost motor
in his nature; for it is the only one which is natural in our
heart, which is innate in us, and which we find alike in human
babe and the young of the animal. This feeling of irrepressible,
instinctive aspiration in primitive man is beautifully, and one
may say intuitionally, described by Carlyle. &quot;The great antique
heart,&quot; he exclaims, &quot;how like a child's in its simplicity,
like a man's in its earnest solemnity and depth! heaven lies over
him wheresoever he goes or stands on the earth; making all the
earth a mystic temple to him, the earth's business all a kind
of worship. Glimpses of bright creatures flash in the common sunlight;
angels yet hover, doing God's messages among men . . . . . Wonder,
miracle, encompass the man; he lives in an element of miracle*
. . . . A great law of duty, high as these two infinitudes (heaven
and hell), dwarfing all else, annihilating all else -- it was
a reality, and it is one: the garment

<P>
* That which was <EM>natural </EM>in the sight of primitive man
has become only now <EM>miracle</EM> to us; and that which was
to him a miracle could never be expressed in our language.<HR>

only of it is dead; the essence of it lives through all times

<P>
It lives undeniably, and has settled in all its ineradicable strength
and power in the Asiatic Aryan heart from the Third Race direct
through its first &quot;mind-born&quot; sons, -- the fruits of
<EM>Kriyasakti. </EM>As time rolled on the holy caste of Initiates
produced but rarely, and from age to age, such perfect creatures:
beings apart, inwardly, though the same as those who produced
them, outwardly.
<P>
While in the infancy of the third primitive race: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;A creature of a more exalted kind<BR>
Was wanting yet, and therefore was designed;<BR>
Conscious of thought, of more capacious breast<BR>
For empire formed and fit to rule the rest. . . . .&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It was called into being, a ready and perfect vehicle for the
incarnating denizens of higher spheres, who took forthwith their
abodes in these forms born of <EM>Spiritual </EM>WILL and the
natural divine power in man. It was a child of pure Spirit, mentally
unalloyed with any tincture of earthly element. Its physical frame
alone was of time and of life, as it drew its intelligence direct
from above. It was the living tree of divine wisdom; and may therefore
be likened to the Mundane Tree of the Norse Legend, which cannot
wither and die until the last battle of life shall be fought,
while its roots are gnawed all the time by the dragon Nidhogg;
for even so, the first and holy Son of Kriyasakti had his body
gnawed by the tooth of time, but the roots of his inner being
remained for ever undecaying and strong, because they grew and
expanded in heaven not on earth. He was the first of the <STRONG>F</STRONG>IRST,
and he was the seed of all the others. There were other &quot;Sons
of Kriyasakti&quot; produced by a second Spiritual effort, but
the first one has remained to this day the Seed of divine Knowledge,
the One and the Supreme among the terrestrial &quot;Sons of Wisdom.&quot;
Of this subject we can say no more, except to add that in every
age -- aye, even in our own -- there have been great intellects
who have understood the problem correctly.
<P>
How comes our physical body to the state of perfection it is found
in now? Through millions of years of evolution, of course, yet
never through, or from, animals, as taught by materialism. For,
as Carlyle says: -- &quot;. . . The essence of our being, the
mystery in us that calls itself 'I,' -- what words have we for
such things? -- it is a breath of Heaven,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 212 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
the highest Being reveals himself in man. This body, these faculties,
this life of ours, is it not all as a vesture for the UNNAMED?&quot;
<P>
The<EM> breath </EM>of heaven, or rather the breath of life, called
in the Bible <EM>Nephesh</EM>,<EM> </EM>is in every animal, in
every animate speck as in every mineral atom. But none of these
has, like man, the consciousness of the nature of that highest
Being,* as none has that divine harmony in its form which man
possesses. It is, as Novalis said, and no one since has said it
better, as repeated by Carlyle: --
<P>
&quot;There is but one temple in the universe, and that is the
body of man. Nothing is holier than that high form . . . . We
touch heaven when we lay our hand on a human body!&quot; &quot;This
sounds like a mere flourish of rhetoric,&quot; adds Carlyle, &quot;but
it is not so. If well meditated it will turn out to be a scientific
fact; the expression . . . of the actual truth of the thing. We
are the miracle of miracles, -- the great inscrutable Mystery.&quot;

* There is no nation in the world in which the feeling of devotion
or of religious mysticism is more developed and prominent than
in the Hindu people. See what Max Muller says of this idiosyncracy
and national feature in his works. This is direct inheritance
from the primitive <EM>conscious </EM>men of the Third Race.
