<H4>ADAM-ADAMI.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>N</STRONG>AMES such as Adam-Adami, used by Mr. Chwolsohn
in his &quot;Nabathean Agriculture&quot;* and derided by M. Renan,
may prove little to the profane. To the Occultist, however, once
that the term is found in a work of such immense antiquity as
the above cited, it proves a good deal: for instance that <EM>Adami
</EM>was a manifold symbol, originating with the Aryan people,
as the root word shows, and having been taken from them by the
Semites and the Turanians -- as many other things were.
<P>
&quot;Adam-Adami&quot; is a generic compound name as old as languages
are. The Secret Doctrine teaches that <EM>Ad</EM>-i was the name
given to the first <EM>speaking </EM>race of mankind -- in this
Round -- by the Aryans. Hence the <EM>Adonim </EM>and <EM>Adonai
</EM>(the ancient plural form of the word <EM>Adon</EM>)<EM>,
</EM>which the Jews applied to their Jehovah and angels, who were
simply the first spiritual and ethereal sons of the earth; and
the god Adonis, who in his many variations stood for the &quot;First
Lord.&quot; Adam is the Sanskrit <EM>Ada-Nath, </EM>also meaning
first Lord, as <EM>Ad</EM>-Iswara, or any <EM>Ad </EM>(the first)
followed by any adjective or substantive. The reason for this
is that such truths were a common inheritance. It was a revelation
received by the <EM>first</EM> mankind before that time which,
in Biblical phraseology, is called &quot;the period of one <I>lip
</I>and word,&quot; or speech; knowledge expanded by man's own
intuition later on, but still later hidden from profanation under
an adequate symbology. The author of the &quot;Qabbalah, (according
to), the philosophical writings of Ibn Gebirol,&quot; shows the
Israelite using &quot;<EM>Ad</EM>onai,&quot; (Lord) instead of
<EM>Eh</EM>'<EM>yeh </EM>(<EM>I am</EM>)<EM> </EM>and <I>YHVH</I>,
and adds that, while <EM>Ad</EM>onai is rendered &quot;Lord&quot;
in the Bible, &quot;the lowest designation, or the Deity in Nature,
the more general term Elohim, is translated God.&quot; (p. 175.)
<P>
A curious work was translated in 1860 or thereabout, by the Orientalist
Chwolsohn, and presented to ever-incredulous and flippant Europe
under the innocent title of <EM>Nabathean Agriculture. </EM>In
the opinion of the translator that archaic volume <EM>is </EM>&quot;<EM>a
complete initiation </EM>into the mysteries of the pre-Adamite
nations, on the authority of <EM>undeniably authentic</EM> <EM>documents.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>It is &quot;an invaluable compendium, the full epitome of
the Doctrines held, of the arts and sciences, not only of the
Chaldeans, but also of the Assyrians and Canaanites of the prehistoric
ages.&quot; These

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 453 &quot;NABATHEAN AGRICULTURE.&quot;</H6>

<P>
&quot;<EM>Nabatheans</EM>&quot;<EM> -- </EM>as some critics thought
-- were simply the Sabeans, or Chaldean star-worshippers. The
work is a retranslation from the Arabic, into which language it
was at first translated from the Chaldean.
<P>
Masoudi, the Arabic Historian, speaks of those <EM>Nabatheans,
</EM>and explains their origin in this wise: &quot;After the Deluge
(?) the nations established themselves in various countries. Among
these were the Nabatheans, who founded the city of Babylon, and
were those descendants of Ham who settled in the same province
under the leadership of Nimrod, the son of Cush, who was the son
of Ham, and great-grandson of Noah. . . . . This took place at
the time when Nimrod received the governorship of Babylonia as
the delegate of Dzahhak named Biurasp.&quot;
<P>
The translator, Chwolsohn, finds that the assertions of this historian
are in perfect accord with those of Moses in <EM>Genesis; </EM>while
more irreverent critics might express the opinion that for this
very reason their truth should be suspected. It is useless to
argue this point, which is of no value in the present question.
The weather-beaten, long-since-buried problem, and the difficulty
of accounting, on any logical ground, for the phenomenal derivation
of millions of people of various races, of many civilized nations
and tribes, from <EM>three </EM>couples (Noah's sons) in 346 years*
after the Deluge, may be left to the Karma of the author of <EM>Genesis,
</EM>whether he is called Moses or Ezra. That which is interesting
in the work noticed is its contents, the doctrines enunciated
in it, which are again, if read esoterically, almost all of them
identical with the Secret Teachings.
<P>
Quatremere suggested that this book might have been simply a copy
made under Nebuchadnezzar <STRONG>II</STRONG>., from some Hamitic
treatise, &quot;infinitely more ancient,&quot; while the author
maintains, on &quot;internal and external evidence,&quot; that
its Chaldean original was written out from the oral discourses
and teachings of a wealthy Babylonian landowner, named Qu-tamy,
who had used for those lectures still more ancient materials.
The first Arabic translation is placed by Chwolsohn so far back
as the <STRONG>XIII</STRONG>. cent. <STRONG>B</STRONG>.<STRONG>C</STRONG>.
On the first page of this &quot;revelation,&quot; the author,
or <EM>amanuensis, </EM>Qu-tamy, declares that &quot;the doctrines
propounded therein, were originally told by <EM>Saturn to the
Moon, who</EM> <EM>communicated them to her idol, which idol revealed
them to her devotee,</EM> <EM>the writer </EM>-- the adept Scribe
of that work -- Qu-tamy.
<P>
The details given by the God for the benefit and instruction of
mortals, show periods of incalculable duration and a series of
numberless kingdoms and <EM>Dynasties </EM>that preceded the appearance
on Earth of

<P>
<EM>Adami </EM>(the &quot;red-earth&quot;). These periods have
aroused, as might have been expected, the defenders of the chronology
of the Biblical dead-letter meaning almost to fury. De Rougemont
was the first to make a <EM>levee</EM>-in-arms against the translator.
He reproaches him* with &quot;<EM>sacrificing </EM>Moses to an
anonymous author.&quot; Berosus, he urges, &quot;however great
were <EM>his chronological errors, </EM>was at least in perfect
accord with the prophet with regard to the first men, since he
speaks of <EM>Alorus-Adam, </EM>of <EM>Xisuthrus-Noah, </EM>and
of <EM>Belus-Nimrod,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>etc. &quot;Therefore,&quot;
he adds, &quot;the work <EM>must be </EM>an <STRONG>A</STRONG>POCRYPHA
to be ranged with its contemporaries -- <EM>the</EM> <EM>fourth
book of Esdras, that of Enoch, </EM>the <EM>Sibylline Oracles,
</EM>and the <EM>Book of Hermes -- every one of these dating</EM>
<EM>no further back than two or three centuries </EM><STRONG>B</STRONG><EM>.</EM><STRONG>C</STRONG><EM>.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>Ewald came down still harder on Chwolsohn, and finally M.
Renan. In the &quot;<EM>Revue</EM> <EM>Germanique,</EM>&quot;<EM>**
</EM>the ex-pupil pulls down the authority of his master, by asking
him to show a reason why his <EM>Nabathean Agriculture </EM>should
not be the fraudulent work of some Jew of the third or fourth
century of our era? It can hardly be otherwise -- argues the romancer
of the &quot;Life of Jesus.&quot; Since, in this <EM>in-folio
</EM>on astrology and Sorcery we recognise in the personages introduced
by Qu-tamy, all the patriarchs of the Biblical legends, such as
<EM>Adam-Adami, Anouka-Noah,</EM> and his <EM>Ibrahim-Abraham
</EM>etc., etc.&quot;
<P>
This is no reason, since Adam and others are generic names. Meanwhile
it is humbly submitted that, all things considered, an <EM>apocrypha
-- </EM>if even of the third century <STRONG>A</STRONG>.<STRONG>D</STRONG>.,
instead of the thirteenth century <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>., as suggested
by Quatremere -- is old enough to appear <EM>genuine </EM>as a
document, and so satisfy the demands of the most exacting archaeologist
and critic. For, even admitting, for argument's sake, that this
literary relic has been compiled by &quot;some Jew of the third
century of our era&quot; -- what of that? Leaving the credibility
of its doctrines for a moment aside, why should it be less entitled
to a hearing, or less instructive as reflecting older opinions,
than any other religious work, also a &quot;compilation from old
texts&quot; or oral tradition -- of the same or even a later age?
In such case we should have to reject and call &quot;apocryphal&quot;
the Quran -- two centuries older, though we know it to have sprung,
Minerva-like, direct from the brain of the Arabian prophet; and
we should have to pooh-pooh all the information we can get from
the <EM>Talmud, </EM>which, in its present form, was also compiled
from older materials, and is not earlier than the <STRONG>IX</STRONG>.
century of our era.
<P>
The curious &quot;Bible&quot; of the Chaldean adept, and the various
criticisms upon it (as in the Chwolsohn's translation), are noticed,
because it has an important bearing upon a great portion of the
present work.

<P>
With the exception of M. Renan, an iconoclast by principle --
so pointedly called by Jules Lemaitre &quot;<EM>le Paganini du
Neant</EM>&quot;<EM> -- </EM>the worst fault found with the work
is, it would seem, that the &quot;apocrypha&quot; pretends to
have been communicated <EM>as a revelation </EM>to an adept by,
and from, the &quot;idol of the moon,&quot; who received it from
&quot;Saturn.&quot; Hence, very naturally, it is &quot;a fairy
tale all round.&quot; To this there is but one answer: it is no
more a fairy tale than the Bible, and if one falls, the other
must follow it. Even the mode of divination through &quot;the
idol of the moon&quot; is the same as practised by David, Saul,
and the High Priests of the Jewish Tabernacle by means of the
Teraphim. In Volume <STRONG>III</STRONG>., Part <STRONG>II</STRONG>.
of this present work, the practical methods of such ancient divination
will be found.
<P>
The &quot;Nabathean Agriculture&quot; is a compilation indeed;
it is no apocrypha, but the repetition of the tenets of the Secret
Doctrine under the exoteric Chaldean form of national symbols,
for the purpose of &quot;cloaking&quot; the tenets, just as the
Books of Hermes and the Puranas are Egyptian and Hindu attempts
at the same. The work was as well known in antiquity as it was
during the Middle Ages. Maimonides speaks of it, and refers more
than once to this Chaldeo-Arabic <STRONG>MS</STRONG>., calling
the Nabatheans by their co-religionary name, <EM>i.e</EM>., &quot;star-worshippers,&quot;
or Sabeans, but yet failing to see in this disfigured word &quot;Nabatheans&quot;
the mystic name of the caste devoted to <EM>Nebo </EM>(god of
<EM>secret </EM>wisdom), which shows on its face that the <EM>Nabatheans
</EM>were an occult Brotherhood.* The Nabatheans who, according
to the Persian Yezidi, originally came to Syria from Busrah, were
the degenerate members of that fraternity; still their religion,
even at that late day, was purely Kabalistic.** Nebo is the deity
of the planet Mercury, and Mercury is the god of Wisdom or Hermes,
and <EM>Budha,</EM> which the Jews called <IMG SRC="sd2-455.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
&quot;the Lord on high, the aspiring,&quot; . . . and the Greeks
Nabo, [[<EM>Nabo</EM>]], hence Nabatheans. Notwithstanding that
Maimonides calls their doctrines &quot;heathenish foolishness&quot;
and their archaic literature &quot;<EM>Sabaeorum foetum,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>he places their &quot;agriculture,&quot; the Bible of Qu-tamy,
in the first rank of Archaic literature; and Abarbinel
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* &quot;I will mention to thee the writings . . . respecting <EM>the
belief of the Sabeans,</EM>&quot; he says. &quot;The most famous
is the Book 'The <EM>Agriculture of the Nabatheans,</EM>'<EM>
which</EM><I> </I>has been translated by <EM>Ibn Wahohijah. </EM>This
book is full of heathenish foolishness. . . . It speaks of preparations
of <STRONG>T</STRONG>ALISMANS, the drawing down of the powers
of the <STRONG>S</STRONG>PIRITS, <STRONG>M</STRONG>AGIC, <STRONG>D</STRONG>EMONS,
and ghouls, which make their abode in the desert.&quot; (Maimonides,
quoted by Dr. D. Chwolsohn, &quot;Die Ssabier und der Ssabismus,&quot;
<STRONG>II</STRONG>., p. 458.) The Nabatheans of Mount Lebanon
believed in the Seven Archangels, as their forefathers had believed
in the Seven Great Stars, the abodes and bodies of these Archangels,
believed in to this day by the Roman Catholics, as is shown elsewhere.

<P>
praises it in unmeasured terms. Spencer, quoting the latter, speaks
of it as that &quot;most excellent Oriental work,&quot; adding
(vol. 1., p. 354) that by Nabatheans, the Sabeans, the Chaldeans,
and the Egyptians, in short all those nations <EM>against whom
the laws of Moses were most</EM> <EM>severely enacted, </EM>have
to be understood.
<P>
Nebo, the oldest God of Wisdom of Babylonia and Mesopotamia, was
identical with the Hindu Budha and Hermes-Mercury of the Greeks.
A slight change in the sexes of the parents is the only alteration.
As Budha was the Son of Soma (the Moon) in India, and of the wife
of Brihaspati (Jupiter), so Nebo was the son of Zarpa-nitu (the
Moon deity) and of Merodach, who had become Jupiter, after having
been a Sun God. As Mercury the planet, Nebo was the &quot;overseer&quot;
among the seven gods of the planets; and as the personification
of the Secret Wisdom he was <EM>Nabin, </EM>a seer and a prophet.
The fact that Moses is made to die and disappear on the mount
sacred to Nebo, shows him an initiate and a priest of that god
under another name; for this God of Wisdom was the great creative
deity, and was worshipped as such, not alone at Borsippa in his
gorgeous Temple, or planet-tower. He was likewise adored by the
Moabites, the Canaanites, the Assyrians, and throughout the whole
of Palestine: then why not by the Israelites? &quot;The planetary
temple of Babylon&quot; had &quot;its holy of holies&quot; within
the shrine of Nebo, the prophet god of Wisdom. We are told in
the Hibbert Lectures, &quot;The ancient Babylonians had an intercessor
between men and the gods . . . and Nebo, was the 'proclaimer'
or 'prophet,' as he made known the desire of his father Merodach.&quot;
<P>
Nebo is a creator, like Budha, of the Fourth and also of the Fifth
Race. For the former starts a new race of Adepts, and the latter,
the <EM>Solar-Lunar </EM>Dynasty, or the men of these Races and
Round. Both are the Adams of their respective creatures. Adam-Adami
is a personation of the <EM>dual </EM>Adam: of the paradigmic
Adam-Kadmon, the creator, and of the lower Adam, the terrestrial,
who, as the Syrian Kabalists have it, had only <EM>nephesh, </EM>&quot;the
breath of life,&quot; but <EM>no living</EM> <EM>soul, </EM>until
after his Fall.
<P>
If, therefore, Renan persists in regarding the Chaldean Scriptures
-- or what remains of them -- as apocryphal, it is quite immaterial
to truth and fact. There are other Orientalists who may be of
a different opinion; and even were they not, it would still really
matter very little. These doctrines contain the teachings of Esoteric
philosophy, and this must suffice. To those who understand nothing
of symbology it may appear astrolatry, pure and simple, or to
him who would conceal the esoteric truth, even &quot;heathenish
foolishness.&quot; Maimonides, however, while expressing scorn
for the esotericism in the religion of other nations, confessed
esotericism and symbology in his own, preached<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 457 THE KABALISTIC FOUR ADAMS.</H6>

<P>
silence and secresy upon the true meaning of Mosaic sayings, and
thus came to grief. The Doctrines of Qu-tamy, the Chaldean, are,
in short, the allegorical rendering of the religion of the earliest
nations of the Fifth Race.
<P>
Why then should M. Renan treat the name &quot;Adam-Adami&quot;
with such academical contempt? The author of the &quot;Origins
of Christianity&quot; evidently knows nothing of the &quot;<EM>origins
of pagan </EM>symbolism&quot; or of Esotericism either, otherwise
he would have known that the name was a form of universal symbol,
referring, <EM>even with the Jews, </EM>not to one man, but to
four distinct humanities or mankinds. This is very easily proven.
<P>
The Kabalists teach the existence of four distinct Adams, or the
transformation of four consecutive Adams, the emanations from
the <EM>Dyooknah </EM>(divine phantom) of the Heavenly Man, an
ethereal combination of Neschamah, the highest Soul or Spirit:
this Adam having, of course, neither a gross human body, nor a
<EM>body of desire. </EM>This &quot;Adam&quot; is the prototype
(<EM>tzure</EM>) of the second Adam. That they represent our Five
Races is certain, as everyone can see by their description in
the Kabala: the first being the &quot;perfect, Holy Adam&quot;;
. . . &quot;a shadow that disappeared&quot; (the Kings of Edom)
produced from the divine <EM>Tzelem </EM>(Image); the second is
called the protoplastic androgyne Adam of the future terrestrial
and separated Adam; the third Adam is the man made of &quot;dust&quot;
(the first, innocent Adam); and the fourth, is the supposed forefather
of our own race -- the Fallen Adam. See, however, the admirably
clear description of these in Mr. Isaac Myer's &quot;Qabbalah,&quot;
p. 418, <EM>et seq. </EM>He gives only four Adams, because of
the Kings of Edom, no doubt. &quot;The fourth Adam,&quot; he writes,
&quot; . . . . was clothed with skin, flesh, nerves, etc. This
answers to the Lower <EM>Nephesch</EM> and <EM>Guff, i.e., </EM>body,
united. He has the animal power of reproduction and continuance
of species,&quot; and this is the <EM>human</EM> Root-Race.
<P>
It is just at this point that the modern Kabalists -- led into
error by the long generations of Christian mystics who have tampered
with the Kabalistic records wherever they could -- diverge from
the Occultists in their interpretations, and take the later thought
for the earlier idea. The original Kabala was entirely metaphysical,
and had no concern with animal, or terrestrial sexes; the later
Kabala has suffocated the divine ideal under the heavy phallic
element. The Kabalists say: -- &quot;God made man male and female.&quot;
&quot;Among the Qabbalists, the necessity to continued creation
and existence is called the Balance,&quot; says the author of
<EM>Qabbalah; </EM>and being without this &quot;Balance,&quot;
connected with <EM>Ma-qom </EM>(mysterious place),* even the First
Race is not,

<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 458 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
as we have seen, recognized by the Sons of the Fifth Adam. From
the highest Heavenly Man, the upper Adam who is &quot;male female&quot;
or Androgyne, down to the Adam of dust, these personified symbols
are all connected with sex and procreation. With the Eastern Occultists
it is entirely the reverse. The sexual relation they consider
as a &quot;Karma&quot; pertaining only to the mundane relation
of man, who is dominated by Illusion, a thing to be put aside,
the moment that the person becomes &quot;wise.&quot; They considered
it a most fortunate circumstance if the Guru (teacher) found in
his pupil an aptitude for the pure life of Brahmacharya. Their
dual symbols were to them but the poetical imagery of the sublime
correlation of creative Cosmic forces. And this ideal conception
is found beaming like a golden ray upon each idol, however coarse
and grotesque, in the crowded galleries of the sombre fanes of
India and other Mother lands of cults.
<P>
This will be demonstrated in the following Section.
<P>
Meanwhile, it may be added that, with the Gnostics, the second
Adam also emanates from the Primeval Man, the Ophite <EM>Adamas,
</EM>in &quot;whose image he is made&quot;; the third, from this
second -- an Androgyne. The latter is symbolized in the 6th and
7th pairs of the male-female AEons, --Amphian-Essumene, and Vannanin-Lamer
(Father and Mother; <EM>vide</EM> Valentinian Table, in Epiphanius)
-- while the fourth Adam, or Race, is represented by a Priapean
monster. The latter -- a post-Christian fancy -- is the degraded
copy of the ante-Christian Gnostic symbol of the &quot;Good One,&quot;
or &quot;He, <EM>who created before anything existed</EM>,&quot;
the Celestial Priapus -- truly born from Venus and Bacchus <EM>when</EM>
<EM>that</EM> <EM>God returned from his expedition into India,
</EM>for Venus and Bacchus are the post-types of Aditi and the
Spirit. The later Priapus, one, however, with Agathodaemon, the
Gnostic Saviour, and even with Abraxas, is no longer the glyph
for <EM>abstract creative </EM>Power, but symbolizes the four
Adams, or Races, the fifth being represented by the <EM>five</EM>
branches cut off from the Tree of Life on which the old man stands
in the Gnostic gems. The number of the Root-Races was recorded
in the ancient Greek temples by the seven vowels, of which <EM>five</EM>
were framed in a panel in the Initiation halls of the Adyta. The
Egyptian glyph for it was a hand with five fingers spread, the
fifth or little finger being only half-grown, and also <EM>five</EM>
&quot;<STRONG>N</STRONG>'s&quot; -- hieroglyphs standing for that
letter. The Romans used the five vowels <STRONG>A E I O V</STRONG>
in their fanes; and this archaic symbol was adopted during the
middle ages as a motto by the House of the Hapsburgs. <EM>Sic
transit gloria!</EM>
