28. <STRONG>F</STRONG>ROM THE DROPS OF SWEAT (a); FROM THE RESIDUE
OF THE SUBSTANCE; MATTER FROM DEAD BODIES AND ANIMALS OF THE WHEEL
BEFORE (<EM>previous, Third Round</EM>);<EM> </EM>AND FROM CAST-OFF
DUST; THE FIRST ANIMALS (<EM>of this Round</EM>)<EM> </EM>WERE
PRODUCED.
<P>
(<EM>a</EM>)<EM> </EM>The Occult doctrine maintains that, in this
Round, the mammalians were a later work of evolution than man.
Evolution proceeds in cycles. The great Manvantaric cycle of Seven
Rounds, beginning in the First Round with mineral, vegetable,
and animal, brings its evolutionary work on the descending arc
to a dead stop in the middle of the Fourth <EM>Race, </EM>at the
close of the first half of the Fourth <EM>Round. </EM>It is on
our Earth, then, (the Fourth sphere and the lowest) and in the
present <EM>Round, </EM>that this middle point has been reached.
And since the Monad has passed, after its &quot;first inmetallization&quot;
on Globe A, through the mineral, vegetable, and animal worlds
in every degree of the three states of matter, except the last
degree of the third or solid state, which it reached only at the
&quot;<EM>mid-point of evolution</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>it is but
logical and natural that at the beginning of the Fourth Round
on Globe D, Man should be the first to appear; and also that his
frame should be of the most tenuous matter that is compatible
with objectivity. To make it still clearer: if the Monad begins
its cycle of incarnations through the three objective kingdoms
on the descending curved line, it has necessarily to enter on
the re-ascending curved line of the sphere as a man also. On the
descending arc it is the spiritual which is gradually transformed
into the material. On the middle line of the base, Spirit and
Matter are equilibrized in Man. On the ascending arc, Spirit is
slowly re-asserting itself at the expense of the physical, or
matter, so that, at the close of the seventh Race of the Seventh
Round, the Monad will find itself as<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 181 MEN, THE PROGENITORS OF ANIMALS.</H6>

<P>
free from matter and all its qualities as it was in the beginning;
having gained in addition the experience and wisdom, the fruition
of all its personal lives, without their evil and temptations.
<P>
This order of evolution is found also in <EM>Genesis</EM> (<EM>ch.
</EM>1 <EM>and </EM>2) if one reads it in its true esoteric sense,
for chapter i. contains the history of the first Three Rounds,
as well as that of the first Three Races of the Fourth, up to
that moment when Man is called to conscious life by the Elohim
of Wisdom. In the first chapter, animals, whales and fowls of
the air, are created before the androgyne Adam.* In the second,
Adam (the sexless) comes first, and the animals only appear after
him. Even the state of mental torpor and unconsciousness of the
first two races, and of the first half of the Third Race, is symbolized,
in the second chapter of <EM>Genesis, </EM>by the <EM>deep sleep
of Adam. </EM>It was the dreamless sleep of mental inaction, the
slumber of the Soul and Mind, which was meant by that &quot;sleep,&quot;
and not at all the physiological process of differentiation of
sexes, as a learned French theorist (M. Naudin) imagined.
<P>
The Puranas, the Chaldean and Egyptian fragments, and also the
Chinese traditions, all show an agreement with the Secret Doctrine
as to the process and order of evolution. We find in them the
corroboration of almost all our teaching. For instance: the statement
concerning the oviparous mode of procreation of the Third Race,
and even a hint at a less innocent mode of the procreation of
the first mammal forms, &quot;gigantic, transparent, dumb and
monstrous they were,&quot; says the Commentary. Study the stories
of the several Rishis and their multifarious progeny; <EM>e.g</EM>.,
Pulastya is the father of <EM>all the Serpents and Nagas -- </EM>the
oviparous brood; Kasyapa was grandsire, through his wife Tamra,
of the birds and of Garuda, king of the feathered tribe; while
by his wife Surabhi, he was the parent of cows and buffaloes,
etc., etc.
<P>
In the Secret Doctrine, the first <EM>Nagas -- </EM>beings wiser
than Serpents -- are the &quot;Sons of Will and Yoga,&quot; born
before the complete separation of the sexes, &quot;matured in
the man-bearing eggs** produced by the power (Kriyasakti) of the
holy sages&quot; of the early Third Race.***

Some of the descendants of the primitive Nagas, the Serpents of
Wisdom, peopled America, when its continent arose during the palmy
days of the great Atlantis, (America being the <EM>Patala </EM>or
Antipodes of Jambu-Dwipa, not of Bharata-Varsha). Otherwise, whence
the traditions and legends -- the latter <EM>always more true
than history, </EM>as says Augustin Thierry -- and even the identity
in the names of certain &quot;medicine men&quot; and priests,
who exist to this day in Mexico? We shall have to say something
of the <EM>Nargals </EM>and the <EM>Nagals </EM>and also of <EM>Nagalism,
</EM>called &quot;devil-worship&quot; by the Missionaries.
<P>
In almost all the Puranas, the story of the &quot;Sacrifice of
Daksha&quot; is given, the oldest account of which is to be found
in <EM>Vayu Purana. </EM>Allegorical as it is, there is more meaning
and biological revelation in it to a Naturalist, than in all the
<EM>pseudo-scientific </EM>vagaries, which are regarded as learned
theories and hypotheses.
<P>
Daksha, who is regarded as the Chief Progenitor, is, moreover,
pointed out as the creator of <EM>physical man </EM>in the &quot;fable,&quot;
which makes him lose his head from his body in the general strife
between the gods and the <EM>Raumas. </EM>This head, being burnt
in the fire, is replaced by the <EM>head of a ram </EM>(Kasi-Khanda).
Now the ram's head and horns are ever the symbol of generating
power and of reproductive force, and are <EM>phallic. </EM>As
we have shown, it is Daksha who establishes the era of men engendered
by sexual intercourse. But this mode of procreation did not occur
suddenly, as one may think, and required long ages before it became
the one &quot;natural&quot; way. Therefore, his sacrifice to the
gods is shown as interfered with by Siva, the <EM>destroying </EM>deity<EM>,
evolution and </EM>PROG<EM>RESS  personified, </EM>who is the
<EM>regenerator </EM>at the same time; who destroys things under
one form but to recall them to life under another more perfect
type. Siva-Rudra creates the terrible Virabhadra (born of his
breath) the &quot;thousand-headed, thousand-armed&quot; (etc.)
monster, and commissions him to destroy the sacrifice prepared
by Daksha. Then Virabhadra, &quot;abiding in the region of the
ghosts (ethereal men) . . . .

hair, which, owing to his fright at beholding the Yakshas, whom
he had created horrible to behold, fell off from the head, each
hair becoming a serpent. They are called Sarpa from their creeping

</EM>powerful Raumas,* (or Raumyas).&quot; Now, however mythical
the allegory, the Mahabharata, which is history as much as is
the Iliad, shows** the Raumyas and other races, as springing in
the same manner from the <EM>Romakupas,</EM> hair<EM> </EM>or
skin pores. This allegorical description of the &quot;sacrifice&quot;
is full of significance to the students of the Secret Doctrine
who know of the &quot;Sweat-born.&quot;
<P>
In the Vayu Purana's account of Daksha's sacrifice, moreover,
it is said to have taken place in the presence of creatures <EM>born
from the egg, </EM>from the vapour, vegetation, pores of the skin,
and, finally only, from the womb.
<P>
Daksha typifies the early Third Race, holy and pure, still devoid
of an individual <EM>Ego,</EM> and having merely the passive capacities.
Brahma, therefore, commands him to create (in the exoteric texts);
when, obeying the command, he made &quot;inferior and superior&quot;
(<EM>avara and vara</EM>)<EM> </EM>progeny (<EM>putra</EM>),<EM>
bipeds </EM>and <EM>quadrupeds</EM>;<EM> </EM>and by his <EM>will,</EM>
gave birth to females . . . . to the gods, the <EM>Daityas </EM>(giants
of the Fourth Race), the snake-gods, animals, cattle and the <EM>Danavas
</EM>(Titans and demon Magicians) and other beings.&quot;
<P>
. . . . &quot;From that period forward, <EM>living creatures were
engendered</EM> <EM>by sexual intercourse. Before the time of
Daksha, they were variously</EM> <EM>propagated -- </EM>by the
<EM>will</EM>, by sight, by touch, and by <EM>Yoga-power.</EM>&quot;***<EM>
</EM>And now comes the simply zoological teaching.

subsequent separation of sexes is now indisputable, even from
the stand-point of Biology. As Prof. Oscar Schmidt, an avowed
Darwinist, shows: &quot;Use and disuse combined with selection
elucidate (?) <EM>the separation of the sexes, </EM>and the existence,
totally incomprehensible, of rudimentary sexual organs. In the
Vertebrata especially, <EM>each sex possesses such distinct traces
of the reproductive apparatus characteristic of the other, </EM>that
even antiquity assumed hermaphroditism as a natural primeval form
of mankind. . . . The tenacity with which the rudiments of sexual
organs are inherited is remarkable. In the class of mammals, actual
hermaphroditism is unheard of, although through the whole period
of their development they drag along with them these residues
born by <EM>their unknown ancestry, </EM>no one can say how long

We are not told what the &quot;huge she-animals&quot; were; but
they certainly were as different from any we know now, as were
the men.
<P>
This was the first physical &quot;fall into matter&quot; of some
of the then existing and lower races. Bear in mind Stanza 24.
The &quot;Sons of Wisdom&quot; had spurned the early <EM>Third
</EM>Race, <EM>i.e</EM>., the non-developed, and are shown incarnating
in, and thereby endowing with intellect, the <EM>later </EM>Third
Race. Thus the sin of the brainless or &quot;mindless&quot; Races,
who had no &quot;spark&quot; and were irresponsible, fell upon
those who failed to do by them their Karmic duty.

<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="what">W</A></STRONG>HAT MAY BE THE <STRONG>O</STRONG>BJECTIONS
TO THE <STRONG>F</STRONG>OREGOING.
<P>
Thus Occultism rejects the idea that Nature developed man from
the ape, or even from an ancestor common to both, but traces,
on the contrary, some of the most anthropoid species to the Third
Race man of the early Atlantean period. As this proposition will
be maintained and defended elsewhere, a few words more are all
that are needed at present. For greater clearness, however, we
shall repeat in brief what was said previously in Book I., Stanza
<STRONG>VI.</STRONG> 
<P>
Our teachings show that, while it is quite correct to say that
nature had built, at one time, around the human astral form an
<EM>ape-like external </EM>shape, yet it is as correct that this
shape was no more that of the &quot;missing link,&quot; than were
the coverings of that astral form, during the course of its natural
evolution through all the kingdoms of nature. Nor was it, as shown
in the proper place, on this Fourth Round planet that such evolution
took place, but only during the First, Second, and Third Rounds,
when MAN was, in turn, &quot;a stone, a plant, and an animal&quot;
until he became what he was in the First Root-Race of present
humanity. The real line of evolution differs from the Darwinian,
and the two systems are irreconcilable, except when the latter
is divorced from the dogma of &quot;Natural Selection&quot; and
the like. Indeed, between the <EM>Monera </EM>of Haeckel and the
<EM>Sarisripa </EM>of Manu, there lies an impassable chasm in
the shape of the <EM>Jiva</EM>;<EM> </EM>for the &quot;human&quot;
Monad, whether<EM> immetallized </EM>in the stone-atom, or <EM>invegetallized
</EM>in the plant, or <EM>inanimalized </EM>in the animal, is
still and ever a divine, hence also a HUMAN Monad. It ceases to
be human only when it becomes <EM>absolutely divine. </EM>The
terms &quot;mineral,&quot; &quot;vegetable&quot; and &quot;animal&quot;
<EM>monad </EM>are meant to create a superficial distinction:
there is no such thing as a Monad (jiva)<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 186 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
other than divine, and consequently having been, or having to
become, human. And the latter term has to remain meaningless unless
the difference is well understood. The Monad is a drop out of
the shoreless Ocean beyond, or, to be correct, <EM>within</EM>
the plane of primeval differentiation. It is divine in its higher
and <EM>human </EM>in its lower condition -- the adjectives &quot;higher&quot;
and &quot;lower&quot; being used for lack of better words -- and
a monad it remains at all times, save in the Nirvanic state, under
whatever conditions, or whatever external forms. As the Logos
reflects the Universe in the Divine Mind, and the manifested Universe
reflects itself in each of its Monads, as Leibnitz put it, repeating
an Eastern teaching, so the <STRONG>M</STRONG>ONAD has, during
the cycle of its incarnations, to reflect in itself every <EM>root-form
</EM>of each kingdom. Therefore, the Kabalists say correctly that
&quot;<STRONG>M</STRONG>AN becomes a stone, a plant, an animal,
a man, a Spirit, and finally God. Thus accomplishing his cycle
or circuit and returning to the point from which he had started
as the <EM>heavenly </EM><STRONG>M</STRONG>AN.&quot; But by &quot;Man&quot;
the divine Monad is meant, and not the thinking Entity, much less
his physical body. While rejecting the immortal Soul, the men
of Science now try to trace the latter through a series of animal
forms from the lowest to the highest; whereas, in truth, all the
present fauna are the descendants of those primordial monsters
of which the Stanzas speak. The animals -- the creeping beasts
and those in the waters that preceded man in this Fourth Round,
as well as those contemporary with the Third Race, and again the
mammalia that are posterior to the Third and Fourth Races -- all
are either directly or indirectly the mutual and correlative product
(physically) of man. It is correct to say that the man of this
Manvantara, <EM>i.e</EM>., during the three preceding Rounds,
has passed through all the kingdoms of nature. That he was &quot;a
stone, a plant, an animal.&quot; But (<EM>a</EM>) these stones,
plants, and animals were the prototypes, the filmy presentments
of those of the Fourth Round; and (<EM>b</EM>) even those at the
beginning of the Fourth Round were the astral shadows of the present,
as the Occultists express it. And finally the forms and <EM>genera
</EM>of neither man, animal, nor plant were what they became later.
Thus the astral prototypes of the lower beings of the animal kingdom
of the Fourth Round, which <EM>preceded </EM>(the chhayas of)
<EM>Men, </EM>were the consolidated, though still very ethereal
<EM>sheaths </EM>of the still more ethereal forms or models produced
at the close of the Third Round on Globe D.* &quot;Produced from
the residue of the substance matter; from dead bodies of men and
(other <EM>extinct</EM>)<EM> </EM>animals of the wheel before,&quot;
or the previous <EM>Third </EM>Round -- as Stanza 24 tells us.
Hence, while the nondescript &quot;animals&quot;

<P>
that preceded the astral man at the beginning of this life-cycle
on our Earth were still, so to speak, the progeny of the man of
the Third Round, the mammalians of this Round owe their existence,
in a great measure, to man again. Moreover, the &quot;ancestor&quot;
of the present anthropoid animal, the ape, is the direct production
of the yet mindless <EM>Man,</EM> who desecrated his human dignity
by putting himself physically on the level of an animal.
<P>
The above accounts for some of the alleged physiological proofs,
brought forward by the anthropologists as a demonstration of the
descent of man from the animals.
<P>
The point most insisted upon by the Evolutionists is that, &quot;The
history of the embryo is an epitome of that of the race.&quot;
That &quot;every organism, in its development from the egg, runs
through a series of forms, through which, in like succession,
its ancestors have passed in the long course of Earth's history.*
The history of the embryo . . . . is a picture in little, and
outline of that of the race. <EM>This conception forms the gist
of our fundamental biogenetic law, which we are obliged to place
at the head of the study of the fundamental law of organic development.</EM>&quot;**
<P>
This modern theory was known as a fact to, and far more philosophically
expressed by, the Sages and Occultists from the remotest ages.
A passage from &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>may
here be cited to furnish a few points of comparison. In Vol. I.,
pp. 388-9, it was asked why, with all their great learning, physiologists
were unable to explain teratological phenomena? Any anatomist
who has made the development and growth of the embryo &quot;a
subject of special study,&quot; can tell, without much brain-work,
what daily experience and the evidence of his own eyes show him,
viz., that up to a certain period, the human embryo is facsimile
of a young batrachian in its first remove from the spawn -- tadpole.
But no physiologist or anatomist seems to have had the idea of
applying to the development of the human being -- from the first
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* &quot;A very strong argument in favour of variability is supplied
by the science of Embryology. Is not a man in the uterus . . .
. . a simple cell, a vegetable with three or four leaflets, a
tadpole with branchiae, a mammal with a tail, lastly a primate
(?) and a biped? It is scarcely possible not to recognise in the
embryonic evolution a rapid sketch, a faithful summary, of the
entire organic series.&quot; (<EM>Lefevre, Philosophy, p. </EM>484).
<P>
The summary alluded to is, however, only that of the <EM>store
of types </EM>hoarded up in man, the microcosm. This simple explanation
meets all such objections, as the presence of the rudimentary
tail in the foetus -- a fact triumphantly paraded by Haeckel and
Darwin as conclusively in favour of the Ape-Ancestor theory. <EM>It
may also be pointed out that the presence of a vegetable with
leaflets </EM>in the embryonic stages is <EM>not explained </EM>on
ordinary evolutionist principles. Darwinists have not traced man
through the vegetable, but Occultists have. <EM>Why then this
feature in the embryo, </EM>and how do the former explain it?

instant of its physical appearance as a germ to its ultimate formation
and birth -- the Pythagorean esoteric doctrine of metempsychosis,
so erroneously interpreted by critics. The meaning of the axiom:
&quot;A stone becomes a plant; a plant, a beast; a beast, a man,
etc.&quot; was mentioned in another place in relation to the spiritual
and physical evolution of men on this Earth. We will now add a
few more words to make the matter clearer.
<P>
What is the primitive shape of the future man? A grain, a corpuscle,
say some physiologists; a molecule, an ovum of the ovum, say others.
If it could be analysed -- by the microscope or otherwise -- of
what ought we to expect to find it composed? Analogically, we
should say, of a nucleus of inorganic matter, deposited from the
circulation at the germinating point, and united with a deposit
of organic matter. In other words, this infinitesimal nucleus
of the future man is composed of the same elements as a stone
-- of the same elements as the Earth, which the man is destined
to inhabit. Moses is cited by the Kabalists as authority for the
remark that it required earth and water to make a living being,
and thus it may be said that man first appears as a stone.
<P>
At the end of three or four weeks the ovum has assumed a plant-like
appearance, one extremity having become spheroidal and the other
tapering like a carrot. Upon dissection it is found to be composed,
like an onion, of very delicate laminae or coats, enclosing a
liquid. The laminae approach each other at the lower end, and
the embryo hangs from the root of the umbilicus almost like the
fruit from the bough. The stone has now become changed, by &quot;metempsychosis,&quot;
into a plant. Then the embryonic creature begins to shoot out,
from the inside outward, its limbs, and develops its features.
The eyes are visible as two black dots; the ears, nose, and mouth
form depressions, like the points of a pineapple, before they
begin to project. The embryo develops into an animal-like foetus
-- the shape of a tadpole -- and, like an amphibious reptile,
lives in water and develops from it. Its Monad has not yet become
either human or immortal, for the Kabalists tell us that this
only occurs at the &quot;fourth hour.&quot; One by one the foetus
assumes the characteristics of the human being, the first flutter
of the immortal breath passes through its being; it moves; and
the divine essence settles in the infant frame, which it will
inhabit until the moment of physical death, when man becomes a
spirit.
<P>
This mysterious process of a nine-months' formation, the Kabalists
call the completion of the &quot;individual cycle of evolution.&quot;
As the foetus develops amidst the <EM>liquor amnii </EM>in the
womb, so the Earths germinate in the universal ether, or astral
fluid, in the womb of the Universe. These cosmic children, like
their pigmy inhabitants, are at first nuclei; then ovules; then
gradually mature; and becoming<HR>

<P>
mothers, in their turn, develop mineral, vegetable, animal, and
human forms. From centre to circumference, from the imperceptible
vesicle to the uttermost conceivable bounds of the Kosmos, those
glorious thinkers, the Occultists, trace cycle merging into cycle,
containing and contained in an endless series. The embryo evolving
in its pre-natal sphere, the individual in his family, the family
in the state, the state in mankind, the Earth in our system, that
system in its central universe, the universe in the Kosmos, and
the Kosmos in the ONE CAUSE . . . thus runs <EM>their </EM>philosophy
of evolution, differing as we see, from that of Haeckel: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;All are but parts of one stupendous whole,<BR>
Whose body Nature is, and (Parabrahm) the soul . . .&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
These are the proofs of Occultism, and they are rejected by Science.
But how is the chasm between the mind of man and animal to be
bridged in this case? How, if the anthropoid and <EM>Homo primigenius
</EM>had, <EM>argumenti gratia, </EM>a common ancestor (in the
way modern speculation puts it), did the two groups diverge so
widely from one another as regards mental capacity? True, the
Occultist may be told that in every case Occultism does what Science
repeats; it gives a <EM>common </EM>ancestor to ape and man, since
it makes the former issue from primeval man. Ay, but that &quot;primeval
man&quot; was <EM>man</EM> only in external form. He was <EM>mindless
</EM>and <EM>soulless </EM>at the time he begot, with a female
animal monster, the forefather of a series of apes. This speculation
-- if speculation it be -- is at least logical, and fills the
chasm between the mind of man and animal. Thus it accounts for
and explains the hitherto unaccountable and inexplicable. The
fact that, in the present stage of evolution, Science is almost
certain that no issue can follow from the union of man and animal,
is considered and explained elsewhere.
<P>
Now what is the fundamental difference between the accepted (or
nearly so) conclusions, as enunciated in &quot;<EM>The Pedigree
of Man,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>viz., that man and ape have a common
ancestor; and the teachings of Occultism, which deny this conclusion
and accept the fact that all things and all living beings have
originated from one common source? Materialistic science makes
man evolve gradually to what <EM>he is now, </EM>and, starting
from the first protoplasmic speck called <EM>Moneron </EM>(which
we are told has, like the rest, &quot;originated in the course
of immeasurable ages from a few, or from one simple, <EM>spontaneously
arising </EM>original form, that has obeyed one law of evolution&quot;),
pass through &quot;unknown and unknowable&quot; types up to the
ape, and thence to the human being. Where the transitional shapes
are discoverable we are not told; for the simple reason that no
&quot;missing links&quot; between man and the apes have ever yet
been found, though this fact in no way prevents men like Haeckel
from inventing them <EM>ad libitum.</EM> <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 190 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Nor will they ever be met with; simply, again, because that link
which unites man with his real ancestry is searched for on the
objective plane and in the material world of forms, whereas it
is safely hidden from the microscope and dissecting knife <EM>within
</EM>the animal tabernacle of man himself. We repeat what we have
said in Isis Unveiled: --
<P>
&quot;. . . . . . . All things had their origin in spirit -- evolution
having originally begun from above and proceeded downward, instead
of the reverse, as taught in the Darwinian theory. In other words,
there has been a gradual materialization of forms until a fixed
ultimate of debasement is reached. This point is that at which
the doctrine of modern evolution enters into the arena of speculative
hypothesis. Arrived at this period we will find it easier to understand
Haeckel's <EM>Anthropogeny, </EM>which traces the pedigree of
man 'from its protoplasmic root, sodden in the mud of seas which
existed before the oldest of the fossiliferous rocks were deposited,'
according to Professor Huxley's exposition. We may believe the
man (of the Third Round) evolved 'by gradual modification of an
(astral) mammal of ape-like organization' still easier when we
remember that (though in a more condensed and less elegant, but
still as comprehensible, phraseology) the same theory was said
by Berosus to have been taught many thousands of years before
his time by the man-fish Oannes or Dagon, the semi-demon of Babylonia*
(though on somewhat modified lines).
<P>
&quot;But what lies back of the Darwinian line of descent? So
far as he is concerned nothing but 'unverifiable hypotheses.'
For, as he puts it, he views all beings 'as the lineal descendants
of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the
Silurian system was deposited.'** He does not attempt to show
us who these 'few beings' were. But it answers our purpose quite
as well, for, in the admission of their existence at all, resort
to the ancients for corroboration and elaboration of the idea
receives the stamp of scientific approbation. . . . &quot;
<P>
Truly, as also said in our first work: &quot;If we accept Darwin's
theory of the development of species, we find that his starting-point
is placed in front of an open door. We are at liberty with him,
to either remain within, or cross the threshold, beyond which
lies the limitless and the incomprehensible, or rather the <EM>Unutterable.
</EM>If our mortal language is inadequate to express what our
spirit dimly foresees in the great '<EM>Beyond</EM>'<EM> -- </EM>while
on this earth -- it<EM> must </EM>realize it at some point in
the timeless Eternity.&quot; But what lies &quot;beyond&quot;
Haeckel's theory? Why <EM>Bathybius Haeckelii, </EM>and no more!
<P>
A further answer is given in Part <STRONG>III</STRONG>. <EM>Addenda.</EM>
