OF CONFESSION.&quot;</H6>

<H4>ADDITIONAL FRAGMENTS FROM A COMMENTARY <BR>
ON THE VERSES OF STANZA XII.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>MS.</STRONG> from which these additional
explanations are taken belongs to the group called <EM>&quot;Tongshaktchi
Sangye Songa,&quot; </EM>or the Records of the &quot;Thirty-five
Buddhas of Confession,&quot; as they are <EM>exoterically </EM>called.
These personages, however, though called in the Northern Buddhist
religion &quot;Buddhas,&quot; may just as well be called Rishis,
or Avatars, etc., as they are &quot;Buddhas who have preceded
Sakyamuni&quot; only for the Northern followers of the ethics
preached by Gautama. These great Mahatmas, or Buddhas, are a universal
and common property: they are <EM>historical </EM>sages <EM>-</EM>-
at any rate, for all the Occultists who believe in such a hierarchy
of Sages, the existence of which has been proved to them by the
learned ones of the Fraternity. They are chosen from among some
ninety-seven Buddhas in one group, and fifty-three in another,*
mostly imaginary personages, who are really the personifications
of the powers of the first-named.** These &quot;baskets&quot;
of the oldest writings on &quot;palm leaves&quot; are kept very
secret. Each <STRONG>MS</STRONG>. has appended to it a short synopsis
of the history of that sub-race to which the particular &quot;Buddha-Lha&quot;
belonged. The one special <STRONG>MS</STRONG>. from which the
fragments which follow are extracted, and then rendered into a
more comprehensible language, is said to have been copied from
stone tablets which belonged to a Buddha of the earliest day of
the Fifth Race, who had witnessed the Deluge and the submersion
of the chief continents of the Atlantean race. The day when much,
if not all, of that which is given here from the archaic records,
will be found correct, is not far distant. Then the modern symbologists
will acquire the certitude that even Odin, or the god Woden, the
highest god in the German and Scandinavian mythology, is one of
these thirty-five Buddhas; one of the earliest, indeed, for the
continent to which he and his race belonged, is also one of the
earliest. So early, in truth, that in the days when tropical nature
was to be found, where now lie eternal unthawing snows, one could
cross almost by dry land from Norway <EM>via </EM>Iceland and
Greenland, to the lands that at present surround Hudson's
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Gautama Buddha, named Shakya Thub-pa, is the <EM>twenty-seventh
</EM>of the last group, as most of these Buddhas belong to the
<EM>divine dynasties </EM>which instructed mankind.
<P>
** Of these &quot;Buddhas,&quot; or the &quot;Enlightened,&quot;
the far distant predecessors of Gautama the Buddha, and who represent,
we are taught, once living men, great adepts and Saints, in whom
the &quot;Sons of Wisdom&quot; had incarnated, and who were, therefore,
so to speak, minor Avatars of the Celestial Beings -- eleven only
belong to the Atlantean race, and 24 to the Fifth race, from its
beginnings. They are identical with the Tirtankaras of the Jainas.

Bay.* Just, as in the palmy days of the Atlantean giants, the
sons of the &quot;giants from the East,&quot; a pilgrim could
perform a journey from what in our days is termed the Sahara desert,
to the lands which now rest in dreamless sleep at the bottom of
the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Events
which were never written outside the human memory, but which were
religiously transmitted from one generation to another, and from
race to race, may have been preserved by constant transmission
&quot;within the book volume of the brain,&quot; and through countless
aeons, with more truth and accuracy than inside any written document
or record. &quot;That which is part of our souls is eternal,&quot;
says Thackeray; and what can be nearer to our souls than that
which happens at the dawns of our lives? Those lives are countless,
but the soul or spirit that animates us throughout these myriads
of existences is the same; and though &quot;the book and volume&quot;
of the <EM>physical</EM> brain may forget events within the scope
of one terrestrial life, the bulk of collective recollections
can never desert the divine soul within us. Its whispers may be
too soft, the sound of its words too far off the plane perceived
by our physical senses; yet the shadow of events <EM>that were,</EM>
just as much as the shadow of the events <EM>that are to come,
</EM>is within its perceptive powers, and is ever present before
its mind's eye.
<P>
It is this soul-voice, perhaps, which tells those who believe
in tradition more than in written History, that what is said below
is all true, and relates to pre-historic facts.
<P>
This is what is written in one passage: --
<P>
&quot;<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>K</STRONG>INGS OF <STRONG>L</STRONG>IGHT
HAVE DEPARTED IN WRATH. <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE SINS OF MEN HAVE
BECOME SO BLACK THAT <STRONG>E</STRONG>ARTH QUIVERS IN HER GREAT
AGONY. . . . <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE AZURE SEATS REMAIN EMPTY. <STRONG>W</STRONG>HO
OF THE <STRONG>B</STRONG>ROWN, WHO OF THE <STRONG>R</STRONG>ED,
OR YET AMONG THE <STRONG>B</STRONG>LACK (<EM>races</EM>),<EM>
</EM>CAN SIT IN THE SEATS OF THE<STRONG> B</STRONG>LESSED, THE
<STRONG>S</STRONG>EATS OF KNOWLEDGE AND MERCY! <STRONG>W</STRONG>HO
CAN ASSUME THE FLOWER OF POWER, THE PLANT OF THE GOLDEN STEM AND
THE AZURE BLOSSOM?&quot;

<P>
* This may account for the similarity of the artificial mounds
in the U. S. of America, and the tumuli in Norway. It is this
identity that led some American archaeologists to suggest that
Norwegian mariners had <EM>discovered </EM>America some one thousand
years ago. (<EM>Vide</EM> Holmboe's <EM>Traces de Bouddhisme en
Norvege, </EM>p. 23). There is no doubt that America is that &quot;far
distant land into which pious men and heavy storms had transferred
the sacred doctrine,&quot; as a Chinese writer suggested by his
description to Neumann. But neither Professor Holmboe, of Stockholm,
nor the American archaeologists, have guessed the right age of
the mounds, or the tumuli. The fact that Norwegians may have re-discovered
the land that their long-forgotten forefathers believed to have
perished in the general submersion, does not conflict with that
other fact that the <EM>Secret Doctrine </EM>of the land which
was the cradle of physical man, and of the Fifth Race, had found
its way into the so-called <EM>New World </EM>ages and ages before
the &quot;Sacred Doctrine&quot; of Buddhism.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 425 THE OLDEST RECORDS ABOUT ATLANTIS.</H6>

<P>
The &quot;Kings of Light&quot; is the name given in all old records
to the Sovereigns of the divine Dynasties. The &quot;azure seats&quot;
are translated &quot;celestial thrones&quot; in certain documents.
The &quot;flower of power&quot; is now the Lotus; what it may
have been at that period, who can tell.
<P>
The writer proceeds, like the later Jeremiah, to bewail the fate
of his people. They had become bereft of their &quot;azure&quot;
(celestial) kings, and &quot;they of the <EM>Deva </EM>hue,&quot;
the moon-like complexion, and &quot;they of the refulgent (golden)
face&quot; have gone &quot;to the land of bliss, the land of metal
and fire&quot;; or -- agreeably with the rules of symbolism --
to the lands lying North and East, from whence &quot;the great
waters have been swept away, sucked in by the earth and dissipated
in the air.&quot; The wise races had perceived &quot;the black
storm-dragons, called down by the dragons of wisdom&quot; -- and
&quot;had fled, led on by the shining Protectors of the most Excellent
Land&quot; -- the great ancient adepts, presumably; those the
Hindus refer to as their Manus and Rishis. One of them was Vaivasvata
Manu.
<P>
They &quot;of the yellow hue&quot; are the forefathers of those
whom Ethnology now classes as the Turanians, the Mongols, Chinese
and other ancient nations; and the land they fled to was no other
than Central Asia. There entire new races were born; there they
lived and died until the separation of the nations. But this &quot;separation&quot;
did not take place either in the localities assigned for it by
modern science, nor in the way the Aryans are shown to have divided
and separated by Mr. Max Muller and other <EM>Aryanists. </EM>Nearly
two-thirds of one million years have elapsed since that period.
The yellow-faced giants of the post-Atlantean day, had ample time,
throughout this forced confinement to one part of the world, and
with the same racial blood and without any fresh infusion or admixture
in it, to branch off during a period of nearly 700,000 years into
the most heterogeneous and diversified types. The same is shown
in Africa; nowhere does a more extraordinary variability of types
exist, from black to almost white, from gigantic men to dwarfish
races; and this only because of their forced isolation. The Africans
have never left their continent for several hundred thousands
of years. If to-morrow the continent of Europe were to disappear
and other lands to re-emerge instead; and if the African tribes
were to separate and scatter on the face of the earth, it is they
who, in about a hundred thousand years hence, would form the bulk
of the civilized nations. And it is the descendants of those of
our highly cultured nations, who might have survived on some one
island, without any means of crossing the new seas, that would
fall back into a state of relative savagery. Thus the reason given
for dividing humanity into <EM>superior </EM>and <EM>inferior
</EM>races falls to the ground and becomes a fallacy.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 426 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Such are the statements made and facts given in the archaic records.
Collating and comparing them with some modern theories of Evolution,
<EM>minus natural selection</EM> (<EM>Vide </EM>&quot;Physiological
Selection&quot; by G. J. Romanes, <STRONG>F.R.S.</STRONG>), these
statements appear quite reasonable and logical.* Thus, while the
Aryans are the descendants of the <EM>yellow </EM>Adams, the gigantic
and highly civilized tlanto-Aryan race, the Semites -- and the
Jews along with them -- are those of the red Adam; and both de
Quatrefages and the writers of the Mosaic <EM>Genesis </EM>are
right. For, could chapter v. of the First Book of Moses be compared
with the genealogies found in our Archaic Bible, the period from
Adam unto Noah would be found noticed therein, of course under
different names, the respective years of the Patriarchs being
turned into periods, the whole being shown symbolical and allegorical.
In the <STRONG>MS</STRONG>. under consideration many and frequent
are the references to the great knowledge and civilization of
the Atlantean nations, showing the polity of several of them and
the nature of their arts and sciences. If the Third Root-Race,
the Lemuro-Atlanteans, are already spoken of as having been drowned
&quot;with their high civilizations and gods&quot; (<EM>&quot;Esoteric
Buddhism,&quot; </EM>p. 65), how much more may the same be said
of the Atlanteans!
<P>
It is from the Fourth Race that the early Aryans got their knowledge
of &quot;the bundle of wonderful things,&quot; the <EM>Sabha </EM>and<EM>
Mayasabha, </EM>mentioned in the Mahabharata, the gift of Mayasur
to the Pandavas. It is from them that they learnt aeronautics,
<EM>Viwan Vidya </EM>(the &quot;knowledge of flying in air-vehicles&quot;),
and, therefore, their great arts of meteorography and meteorology.
It is from them, again, that the Aryans inherited their most valuable
science of the hidden virtues of precious and other stones, of
chemistry, or rather alchemy, of mineralogy, geology, physics
and astronomy.
<P>
Several times the writer has put to herself the question: &quot;Is
the story of Exodus -- in its details at least -- as narrated
in the Old Testament, original? Or is it, like the story of Moses
himself and many others, simply another version of the legends
told of the Atlanteans?&quot; For who, upon hearing the story
told of the latter, will fail to perceive the great similarity
of the fundamental features? The anger of &quot;God&quot; at the
obduracy of Pharaoh, his command to the &quot;chosen&quot; ones,
to spoil the Egyptians, before departing, of their &quot;jewels
of silver and jewels of gold&quot; (Exod. xi.); and finally the
Egyptians and their Pharaoh drowned in the Red Sea (xiv.). For
here is a fragment of the earlier story from the Commentary: --

<P>
<EM>&quot;He sent his air-vehicles</EM> (Viwan)<EM> to all his

<EM>&quot;The great King fell upon his dazzling Face and wept</EM>.
. . .
<P>
<EM>&quot;When the Kings assembled the waters had already moved</EM>.
. . .
<P>
&quot;(But) <EM>the nations had now crossed the dry lands. They
were beyond</EM> <EM>the water mark. Their Kings reached them
in their Viwans, and led them</EM> <EM>on to the lands of Fire
and Metal </EM>(East and North).&quot;
<P>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
<P>
Still, in another passage, it is said: --
<P>
&quot; . . . <EM>. Stars </EM>(meteors)<EM> showered on the lands
of the</EM> <EM>black</EM> <EM>Faces;</EM> <EM>but they slept.</EM>

<P>
<EM>&quot;The speaking beasts </EM>(the magic watchers) <EM>kept
quiet.</EM> 
<P>
<EM>&quot;The nether lords waited for orders, but they came not,
for their</EM> <EM>masters slept.</EM> 
<P>
<EM>&quot;The waters arose, and covered the valleys from one end
of the Earth</EM> <EM>to the other. High lands remained, the bottom
of the Earth </EM>(the lands of the antipodes) <EM>remained dry.
There dwelt those who escaped; the men of</EM> <EM>the yellow-faces
and of the straight eye </EM>(the frank and sincere people).
<P>
<EM>&quot;When the Lords of the Dark Faces awoke and bethought
themselves</EM> <EM>of their Viwans in order to escape from the
rising waters, they found</EM> <EM>them gone.&quot;</EM> 
<P>
Then a passage shows some of the more powerful magicians of the
&quot;Dark Face&quot; -- who awoke earlier than the others --
pursuing those who had &quot;spoilt them&quot; and who were in
the rear-guard, for -- <EM>&quot;the nations</EM> <EM>that were
led away, were as thick as the stars of the milky way,&quot; </EM>says
a more modern Commentary, written in Sanskrit only.
<P>
<EM>&quot;Like as a dragon-snake uncoils slowly its body, so the
Sons of men,</EM> <EM>led on by the Sons of Wisdom, opened their
folds, and spreading out,</EM> <EM>expanded like a running stream
of sweet waters</EM>. . . . . . <EM>many of the faint-hearted
among them perished on their way. But most were saved.&quot;</EM>

<P>
Yet the pursuers, &quot;whose heads and chests soared high above
the water,&quot; chased them &quot;for three lunar terms&quot;
until finally reached by the rising waves, they perished to the
last man, the soil sinking under their feet and the earth engulfing
those who had desecrated her.
<P>
This sounds a good deal like the original material upon which
the similar story in <EM>Exodus </EM>was built many hundred thousands
of years later. The biography of Moses, the story of his birth,
childhood and rescue from the Nile by Pharaoh's daughter, is now
shown to have been adapted from the Chaldean narrative about Sargon.
And if so, the Assyrian tile in the British Museum being a good
proof of it, why not that of the Jews robbing the Egyptians of
their jewels, the death of Pharaoh and his army, and so on? The
gigantic magicians of Ruta and Daitya, the &quot;lords of the
Dark Face,&quot; may have become in the later narrative the Egyptian
Magi, and the yellow-faced nations of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 429 SHADOWY MEMENTOS OF THE PAST.</H6>

<P>
the Fifth Race, the virtuous sons of Jacob, the &quot;chosen people.&quot;
. . . One more statement has to be made: There have been several
Divine Dynasties -- a series for every Root Race beginning with
the Third, each series according and adapted to its Humanity.
The last Seven Dynasties referred to in the Egyptian and Chaldean
records belong to the Fifth Race, which, though generally called
Aryan, was not entirely so, as it was ever largely mixed up with
races to which Ethnology gives other names. It would be impossible,
in view of the limited space at our disposal, to go any further
into the description of the Atlanteans, in whom the whole East
believes as much as we believe in the ancient Egyptians, but whose
existence the majority of the Western Scientists deny, as they
have denied, before this, many a truth, from the existence of
Homer down to that of the carrier pigeon. The civilization of
the Atlanteans was greater even than that of the Egyptians. It
is their degenerate descendants, the nation of Plato's Atlantis,
which built the first Pyramids in the country, and that certainly
before the advent of the &quot;Eastern AEthiopians,&quot; as Herodotus
calls the Egyptians. This may be well inferred from the statement
made by Ammianus Marcellinus, who says of the Pyramids that &quot;there
are also subterranean passages and winding retreats, which, it
is said, men skilful in the ancient mysteries, by means of which
they divined the coming of a flood, constructed in different places
lest the memory of all their sacred ceremonies should be lost.&quot;
<P>
These men who &quot;divined the coming of floods&quot; were not
Egyptians, who never had any, except the periodical rising of
the Nile. Who were they? The last remnants of the Atlanteans,
we maintain. Those races which are dimly suspected by Science,
and thinking of which Mr. Ch. Gould, the well-known geologist,
says: &quot;Can we suppose that we have at all exhausted the great
museum of nature? Have we, in fact, penetrated yet beyond its
antechambers? Does the written history of man, comprising a few
thousand years, embrace the whole course of his intelligent existence?
Or have we in the long mythical eras, extending over hundreds
of thousands of years, and recorded in the chronologies of Chaldea
and of China, shadowy mementos of pre-historic man, handed down
by tradition, and perhaps transported by a few survivors to existing
lands from others, which, like the fabled (?) Atlantis of Plato,
may have been submerged, or the scene of some great catastrophe
which destroyed them with all their civilization&quot; (<EM>&quot;Mythical
Monsters,&quot;</EM> <EM>p</EM>. 19).
<P>
After this one can turn with more confidence to the words of a
Master who wrote, several years before these words were penned
by Mr. Gould: -- &quot;The Fourth Race had its periods of the
highest civilization. Greek and Roman and even Egyptian civilizations
are nothing com-<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 430 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
pared to the civilizations that began with the Third Race&quot;
-- after its separation.
<P>
But if this civilization and the mastery of arts and sciences
are denied to the Third and Fourth Races, no one will deny that
between the great civilizations of antiquity, such as those of
Egypt and India, there stretched the dark ages of crass ignorance
and barbarism ever since the beginning of the Christian era up
to our modern civilization; during which period all recollection
of these traditions was lost. As said in <EM>Isis Unveiled: </EM>&quot;Why
should we forget that, ages before the prow of the adventurous
Genoese clove the Western waters, the Phoenician vessels had circumnavigated
the globe, and spread civilization in regions now silent and deserted?
What archaeologist will dare assert that the same hand which planned
the Pyramids of Egypt, Karnak, and the thousand ruins now crumbling
to oblivion on the sandy banks of the Nile, did <EM>not</EM> erect
the monumental Nagkon-Wat of Cambodia? or trace the hieroglyphics
on the obelisks and doors of the deserted Indian village, newly
discovered in British Columbia by Lord Dufferin? or those on the
ruins of Palenque and Uxmal, of Central America? Do not the relics
we treasure in our museums -- last mementos of the long 'lost
arts' -- speak loudly in favour of ancient civilization? And do
they not prove, over and over again, that nations and continents
that have passed away have buried along with them arts and sciences,
which neither the first crucible ever heated in a mediaeval cloister,
nor the last cracked by a modern chemist, have revived, nor will
-- at least, in the present century.&quot;
<P>
And the same question may be put now that was put then; it may
be once more asked: &quot;How does it happen that the most advanced
standpoint that has been reached in our times, only enables us
to see in the dim distance up the Alpine path of knowledge the
monumental proofs that earlier explorers have left to mark the
plateaux they had reached and occupied?
<P>
&quot;If modern masters are so much in advance of the old ones,
why do they not restore to us the lost arts of our postdiluvian
forefathers? Why do they not give us the unfading colours of Luxor
-- the Tyrian purple; the bright vermilion and dazzling blue which
decorate the walls of this place, and are as bright as on the
first day of their application? The indestructible cement of the
pyramids and of ancient aqueducts; the Damascus blade, which can
be turned like a corkscrew in its scabbard without breaking; the
gorgeous, unparalleled tints of the stained glass that is found
amid the dust of old ruins and beams in the windows of ancient
cathedrals; and the secret of the true malleable glass? And if
chemistry is so little able to rival even the early mediaeval
ages in some arts, why boast of achievements which, accord-<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 431 MISTAKES OF THE EGYPTOLOGISTS.</H6>

<P>
ing to strong probability, were perfectly known thousands of years
ago? The more archeology and philology advance, the more humiliating
to our pride are the discoveries which are daily made, the more
glorious testimony do they bear in behalf of those who, perhaps
on account of the distance of their remote antiquity, have been
until now considered ignorant flounderers in the deepest mire
of superstition.&quot;
<P>
Among other arts and sciences, the ancients -- ay, as a heirloom
from the Atlanteans -- had those of astronomy and symbolism, which
included the knowledge of the Zodiac.
<P>
As already explained, the whole of antiquity believed, with good
reason, that humanity and its races are all intimately connected
with the planets, and these with Zodiacal signs. The whole world's
History is recorded in the latter. In the ancient temples of Egypt
this was proved by the Dendera Zodiac; but except in an Arabic
work, the property of a <EM>Sufi, </EM>the writer has never met
with a correct copy of these marvellous records of the past, as
also of the <EM>future, </EM>history of our globe. Yet the original
records exist, most undeniably.
<P>
As Europeans are unacquainted with the real Zodiacs of India,
nor do they understand those they happen to know (witness Bentley),
the reader is advised, in order to verify the statement, to turn
to the work of Denon (<EM>Travels in Egypt, Vol. II.</EM>)<EM>
</EM>in which, <EM>if understood, </EM>the two famous Egyptian
Zodiacs, can be found and examined. Having seen them personally,
the writer has no longer need to trust to what other students
-- who have examined and studied both very carefully - have to
say of them. As asserted by the Egyptian Priests to Herodotus,
who was informed that the terrestrial Pole and the Pole of the
Ecliptic had formerly coincided, thus was it found and corroborated
by Mackey.* For he states that the Poles are represented on the
Zodiacs in both positions, &quot;And in that which shows the Poles
(polar axes) at right angles, there are marks which prove that
'it was not the last time they were in that position; <EM>but
the first</EM>' -- after the Zodiacs had been traced.&quot; &quot;Capricorn,&quot;
he adds, &quot;is represented at the North Pole, and Cancer is
divided, near its middle, at the South Pole; which is a confirmation
that originally they had their winter when the Sun was in Cancer;
but the chief characteristics of its being a monument commemorating
the <EM>first</EM> <EM>time </EM>that the Pole had been in that

Broadly calculated, it is believed by the Egyptologists that the
great Pyramid was built 3,350 <B>B.C.</B> (<EM>See Proctor, Knowledge,
Vol. I. pp</EM>. 242, 400); and that Menes and his Dynasty existed
7 50 years before the Fourth

<P>
Dynasty (supposed to have built the Pyramids) had appeared (&quot;<EM>The
Great Pyramid,&quot; Staniland Wake</EM>). Thus 4,100 years <STRONG>B.C.
</STRONG>is the age assigned to Menes. Now Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson's
declaration that <EM>&quot;all the facts lead to the conclusion
</EM>that the Egyptians had already made very great progress in
the arts of civilization <EM>before the age of Menes,</EM> <EM>and
perhaps before they immigrated into the valley of the Nile&quot;
</EM>(<EM>Rawlinson's &quot;Herodotus,&quot; vol. ii. p. </EM>345)
is very suggestive, as destroying this hypothesis. It points to
great civilization in <EM>prehistoric </EM>times, and a still
greater antiquity. The <EM>Schesoo-Hor </EM>(&quot;the servants
of Horus&quot;) were the people who had settled in Egypt; and,
as M. G. Maspero affirms, it is to this <EM>prehistoric </EM>race
that &quot;belongs the honour . . . of having founded the principal
cities of Egypt, and established the most important sanctuaries.&quot;
This was <EM>before </EM>the great Pyramid epoch, and when Egypt
had hardly arisen from the waters. Yet &quot;they possessed the
hieroglyphic form of writing special to the Egyptians, and must
have been already considerably advanced in civilization.&quot;
It was, says Lenormant, &quot;the country of the great prehistoric
sanctuaries, seats of the sacerdotal dominion, which played the
most important part in the origin of civilization.&quot; What
is the date assigned to this people? We hear of 4,000, at the
utmost of 5,000 years <STRONG>B.C.</STRONG> (Maspero). Now it
is claimed that it is by means of the cycle of 25,868 years (the
Sidereal year) that the approximate year of the erection of the
Great Pyramid can be ascertained. &quot;Assuming that the long
narrow downward passage was directed towards the pole star of
the pyramid builders, astronomers have shown that . . . . Alpha
Draconis, the then pole-star, was in the required position about
3,350<STRONG> B.C.</STRONG>, as well as in 2,170 <STRONG>B.C.</STRONG>
(Proctor, quoted by Staniland Wake.) But we are also told that
&quot;this relative position of Alpha Draconis and Alcyone being
an extraordinary one . . it could not occur again for a whole
sidereal year&quot; (<EM>ibid</EM>)<EM>. </EM>This demonstrates
that, since the Dendera Zodiac shows the passage of three sidereal
years, the great Pyramid must have been built 78,000 years ago,
or in any case that this possibility deserves to be accepted at
least as readily as the later date of 3,350 <STRONG>B.C.</STRONG>

<P>
Now on the Zodiac of a certain temple in far Northern India, as
on the Dendera Zodiac, the same characteristics of the signs are
found. Those who know well the Hindu symbols and constellations,
will be able to find out by the description of the Egyptian, whether
the indications of the chronological time are correct or not.
On the Dendera Zodiac as preserved by the modern Egyptian Coptic
and Greek adepts, and explained a little differently by Mackey,
the Lion stands upon the <EM>Hydra</EM> and his tail is almost
straight, pointing downwards at an angle of forty or fifty degrees,
this position agreeing with the<EM> original </EM>conformation
of these constellations. &quot;But in many places we see the Lion
(<EM>Simha</EM>),&quot; <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 433 THEORIES OF A SELF-MADE ADEPT. </H6>

<P>
Mackey adds, &quot;with his tail turned up over his back, and
ending with a Serpent's head; thereby showing that the Lion had
been <EM>'inverted';</EM> which, indeed, must have been the case
with the whole Zodiac and every other Constellation, when the
Pole had been inverted.&quot;
<P>
Speaking of the <EM>Circular </EM>Zodiac, given also by Denon,
he says: -- There, &quot;the Lion is standing <EM>on </EM>the
Serpent, and his tail forming a curve downward, from which it
is found that <EM>though six or seven hundred</EM> <EM>thousand
years </EM>must have passed between the two positions, yet they
had made but little difference between in the constellations of
Leo and the Hydra; while <EM>Virgo </EM>is represented very differently
in the two. In the <EM>circular </EM>Zodiac, the <EM>Virgin is
nursing her child; </EM>but it seems that they had not had that
idea when the pole was first within the plane of the Ecliptic;
for in <EM>this </EM>Zodiac, as given by Denon, we see <EM>three
Virgins</EM> between the Lion and the Scales, <EM>the last of
which holds in her hand </EM>an ear of wheat. It is much to be
lamented that there is in this Zodiac a breach of the figure in
the latter part of Leo and the <EM>beginning of Virgo</EM> which
has taken away one <EM>Decan </EM>out of each sign.&quot;
<P>
Nevertheless, the meaning is plain, as the three Zodiacs belong
to three different epochs: namely, to the last three family races
of the fourth Sub-race of the Fifth Root-race, each of which must
have lived approximately from 25 to 30,000 years. The first of
these (the &quot;Aryan-Asiatics&quot;) witnessed the doom of the
last of the populations of the &quot;giant Atlanteans&quot;* who
perished some 850,000 years ago (the Ruta and Daitya Island-Continents)
toward the close of the Miocene Age.** The fourth sub-race witnessed
the destruction of the last remnant of the Atlanteans -- the Aryo-Atlanteans
in the last island of Atlantis, namely, some 11,000 years ago.
In order to understand this the reader
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The term &quot;Atlantean&quot; must not mislead the reader to
regard these as one race only, or even a nation. It is as though
one said &quot;Asiatics.&quot; Many, multityped, and various were
the Atlanteans, who represented several <EM>humanities, </EM>and
almost a countless number of races and nations, more varied indeed
than would be the &quot;Europeans&quot; were this name to be given
indiscriminately to the five existing parts of the world; which,
at the rate colonization is proceeding, will be the case, perhaps,
in less than two or three hundred years. There were brown, red,
yellow, white and black Atlanteans; giants and dwarfs (as some
African tribes comparatively are, even now).
<P>
** Says a teacher in &quot;Esoteric Buddhism,&quot; on p. 64:
&quot;In the Eocene age, even in its very first part, the great
cycle of the fourth race men the (Lemuro) Atlanteans had already
reached its highest point (of civilization), and the great continent,
the father of nearly all the present continents, showed the first
symptoms of sinking. . . .&quot; And on page 70, it is shown that
Atlantis as a whole perished during the Miocene period. To show
how the continents, races, nations and cycles overlap each other,
one has but to think of Lemuria, the last of whose lands perished
about 700,000 years before the beginning of the Tertiary period
(see p. 65 of the same work), and the last of &quot;Atlantis&quot;
only 11,000 years ago; thus both overlapping -- one the Atlantean
period, and the other the Aryan.<HR>

<P>
is asked to glance at the diagram of the genealogical tree of
the Fifth Root-Race -- generally, though hardly correctly, called
the Aryan race, and the explanations appended to it.
<P>
Let the reader remember well that which is said of the divisions
of Root Races and the evolution of Humanity in this work, and
stated clearly and concisely in Mr. Sinnett's &quot;Esoteric Buddhism.&quot;
<P>
1. There are seven <STRONG>R</STRONG>OUNDS in every manvantara;
this one is the Fourth, and we are in the Fifth Root-Race, at
present.
<P>
2. Each Root-Race has seven sub-races.
<P>
3. Each sub-race has, in its turn, seven ramifications, which
may be called Branch or &quot;Family&quot; races.
<P>
4. The little tribes, shoots, and offshoots of the last-named
are countless and depend on Karmic action. Examine the &quot;genealogical
tree&quot; hereto appended, and you will understand. The illustration
is purely diagrammatic, and is only intended to assist the reader
in obtaining a slight grasp of the subject, amidst the confusion
which exists between the terms which have been used at different
times for the divisions of Humanity. It is also here attempted
to express in figures -- but only within approximate limits, for
the sake of comparison -- the duration of time through which it
is possible to definitely distinguish one division from another.
It would only lead to hopeless confusion if any attempt were made
to give accurate dates to a few; for the Races, Sub-Races, etc.,
etc., down to their smallest ramifications, overlap and are entangled
with each other until it is nearly impossible to separate them.
<P>
The human Race has been compared to a tree, and this serves admirably
as an illustration.
<P>
<IMG SRC="sd2-434.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
The main stem of a tree may be compared to the ROOT-RACE (A).
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 435 ILLUSTRATION OF THE RACES.</H6>

<P>
Its larger limbs to the various SUB-RACES; seven in number (B1,
B2).
<P>
On each of these limbs are seven BRANCHES, OR FAMILY-RACES. (C).
<P>
After this the cactus-plant is a better illustration, for its
fleshy &quot;leaves&quot; are covered with sharp spines, each
of which may be compared to a nation or tribe of human beings.
<P>
Now our Fifth Root-Race has already been in existence -- as a
race <EM>sui generis </EM>and quite free from its parent stem
-- about 1,000,000 years; therefore it must be inferred that each
of the four preceding Sub-Races has lived approximately 210,000
years; thus each Family-Race has an average existence of about
30,000 years. Thus the European &quot;Family Race&quot; has still
a good many thousand years to run, although the nations or the
innumerable spines upon it, vary with each succeeding &quot;season&quot;
of three or four thousand years. It is somewhat curious to mark
the comparative approximation of duration between the lives of
a &quot;Family-Race&quot; and a &quot;Sidereal year.&quot;
<P>
The knowledge of the foregoing, and the accurately correct division,
formed part and parcel of the Mysteries, where these Sciences
were taught to the disciples, and where they were transmitted
by one hierophant to another. Everyone is aware that the European
astronomers assign (arbitrarily enough) the date of the invention
of the Egyptian Zodiac to the years 2000 or 2400 <STRONG>B.C.
</STRONG>(<EM>Proctor</EM>);<EM> </EM>and insist that this invention
coincides in its date with that of the erection of the Great Pyramid.
This, to an Occultist and Eastern astronomer, must appear quite
absurd. The year of the <EM>Kaliyuga </EM>is said to have begun
between the 17th and 18th of February in the year 3102 <STRONG>B.C.</STRONG>
Now the Hindus claim that in the year 20400 before Kaliyugam,
the origin of their Zodiac coincided with the spring equinox --
there being at the time a conjunction of the Sun and Moon -- and
Bailly proved by a lengthy and careful computation of that date,
that, even if fictitious, the epoch from which they had started
to establish the beginning of their Kaliyug was <EM>very real.
</EM>That &quot;epoch is the year 3102 before our era,&quot; he
writes. (<EM>See Part III., Book I. </EM>&quot;<EM>Hindu Astronomy
defended by an Academician&quot;.</EM>)<EM> </EM>The lunar eclipse
arriving just a fortnight after the beginning of the black Age
-- it took place in a point situated between the Wheat Ear of
Virgo and the star [[<EM>theta</EM>]] of the same constellation.
One of their most esoteric Cycles is based upon certain conjunctions
and respective positions of Virgo and the Pleiades <EM>-- </EM>(<EM>Krittika</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>Hence, as the Egyptians brought their Zodiac from Southern
India and Lanka,* the esoteric meaning was evidently identical.
The three &quot;Virgins,&quot; or Virgo in three different positions,
meant, with both, the record of the first three &quot;divine or
astronomical Dynasties,&quot; who taught the Third

<P>
Root-Race; and after having abandoned the Atlanteans to their
doom, returned (or redescended, rather) during the third Sub-Race
of the Fifth, in order to reveal to saved humanity the mysteries
of their birth-place -- the sidereal Heavens. The same symbolical
record of the human races and the three Dynasties (Gods, Manes
-- semi-divine astrals of the Third and Fourth, and the &quot;Heroes&quot;
of the Fifth Race), which preceded the purely human kings, was
found in the distribution of the tiers and passages of the Egyptian
Labyrinth. As the three inversions of the Poles of course changed
the face of the Zodiac, a new one had to be constructed each time.
In Mackey's &quot;Sphinxiad&quot; the speculations of the bold
author must have horrified the orthodox portion of the population
of Norwich, as he says, fantastically enough: --
<P>
&quot;But, after all, the greatest length of time recorded by
those monuments (the Labyrinth, the Pyramids and the Zodiacs)
<EM>does not exceed</EM> <EM>five millions of years </EM>(which
is not so)*; which falls short of the records given us both by
the (esoteric) Chinese and Hindus; which latter nation has registered
a knowledge of time for seven or eight millions of years**; which
I have seen upon a talisman of porcelain. . . . &quot;
<P>
The Egyptian priests had the Zodiacs of the Atlantean Asura-Maya,
as the modern Hindus still have. As stated in &quot;<EM>Esoteric
Buddhism,</EM>&quot; the Egyptians, as well as the Greeks and
&quot;Romans&quot; some thousand years ago, were &quot;remnants
of the Atlanto-Aryans,&quot; <EM>i.e.</EM>, the former, of the
older, or the Ruta Atlanteans; the last-named, the descendants
of the last race of that island, whose sudden disappearance was
narrated to Solon by the Egyptian Initiates. The <EM>human </EM>Dynasty
of the older Egyptians, beginning with Menes, had all the <EM>knowledge
</EM>of the Atlanteans, though there was no more Atlantean blood
in their veins. Nevertheless, they had preserved all their Archaic
records. All this has been shown long ago.*** And it is just because
the Egyptian Zodiac is between 75 and 80,000 years old that the
Zodiac of the Greeks is far later. Volney has correctly pointed
out in his &quot;Ruins of Empires&quot; (p. 360) that it is only
16,984 years old, or up to the present date 17,082.****
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* The forefathers of the Aryan Brahmins had their Zodiacal calculations
and Zodiac from those born by Kriyasakti power, the &quot;Sons
of Yoga&quot;; the Egyptians from the Atlanteans of Ruta.
<P>
** The former, therefore, may have registered time for seven or
eight millions of years, but the Egyptians <EM>could not.</EM>

<P>
*** This question was amply challenged, and as amply discussed
and answered. See <EM>Five Years of Theosophy.</EM> (<EM>Art.

<P>
**** Volney says that, as <EM>Aries </EM>was in its 15th degree
1447 <STRONG>B.C</STRONG>., it follows that the first degree of
&quot;Libra&quot; could not have coincided with the vernal equinox
more lately than 15,194 years <STRONG>B.C.</STRONG>, to which
if you add 1790 since Christ, when Volney wrote this, it appears
that 16,984 years have elapsed since the (Greek or rather Hellenic)
origin of the Zodiac.<HR>
