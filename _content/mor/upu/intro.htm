<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p ALIGN="left">This is the story of what has been called &quot;the great American 
despotism.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">It is the story of the establishment of an absolute throne and 
dynasty by one American citizen over a half-million others.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">And it is the story of the amazing reign of this one man, Joseph 
F. Smith, the Mormon Prophet, a religious fanatic of bitter mind, who claims that 
he has been divinely ordained to exercise the awful authority of God on earth over 
all the affairs of all mankind, and who plays the anointed despot in Utah and the 
surrounding states as cruelly as a Sultan and more securely than any Czar.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">To him the Mormon people pay a yearly tribute of more than two 
million dollars in tithes; and he uses that income, to his own ends, without an 
accounting. He is president of the Utah branch of the sugar trust, and of the local 
incorporations of the salt trust; and he supports the exactions of monopoly by his 
financial absolutism, while he defends them from competition by his religious power 
of interdict and excommunication. He is president of a system of &quot;company stores,&quot; 
from which the faithful buy their merchandise; of a wagon and machine company from 
which the Mormon farmers purchase their vehicles and implements; of life-insurance 
and fire-insurance companies, of banking institutions, of a railroad, of a knitting 
company, of newspapers, which the Mormon people are required by their Church to 
patronize, and through which they are exploited, commercially and financially, for 
the sole profit of the sovereign of Utah and his religious court.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He is the political Boss of the state, delivering the votes of 
his people by revelation of the Will of God, practically appointing the United States 
Senators from Utah-as he practically appoints the marshals, district attorneys, 
judges, legislators, officers and administrators of law throughout his &quot;Kingdom 
of God on Earth&quot;-and ruling the non-Mormons of Utah, as he rules his own people, 
by virtue of his political and financial partnership with the great &quot;business interests&quot; 
that govern and exploit this nation, and his Kingdom, for their own gain, and his.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He lives, like the Grand Turk, openly with five wives, against 
the temporal law of the state, against the spiritual law of his Kingdom, and in 
violation of his own solemn covenant to the country-which he gave in 1890, in order 
to obtain amnesty for himself from criminal prosecution and to help Utah obtain 
the powers of statehood which he has since usurped. He secretly preaches a proscribed 
doctrine of polygamy as necessary to salvation; he publicly denies his own teaching, 
so that he may escape responsibility for the sufferings of the &quot;plural wives&quot; and 
their unfortunate children, who have been betrayed by the authority of his dogma. 
And these women, by the hundreds, seduced into clandestine marriage relations with 
polygamous elders of the Church, unable to claim their husbands-even in some cases 
disowning their children and teaching these children to deny their parents-are suffering 
a pitiful self-immolation as martyrs to the religious barbarism of his rule.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Demanding unquestioning obedience in all things, as the &quot;mouthpiece 
of the Lord,&quot; and &quot;sole vicegerent of God on Earth,&quot; he enforces his demands by 
his religious, political and financial control of the faith, the votes and the property 
of his fellow-citizens. He is at once-as the details of this story show-&quot;the modern 
&#39;money king,&#39; the absolute political Czar, the social despot and the infallible 
Pope of his Kingdom.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Ex-Senator Cannon not only exposes but accounts for and explains 
the conditions that have made the Church-controlled government of Utah less free, 
less of a democracy, a greater tyranny and more of a disgrace to the nation than 
ever the corporation rule of Colorado was in the darkest period of the Cripple Creek 
labor war. He shows the enemies of the republic encouraging and profiting by the 
shame of Utah as they supported and made gain of Colorado&#39;s past disgrace. He shows 
the piratical &quot;Interests,&quot; at Washington, sustaining, and sustained by, the mis-government 
of Utah, in their campaign of national pillage. He shows that the condition of Utah 
today is not merely a local problem; that it affects and concerns the people of 
the whole country; that it can only be cured with their aid.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The outside world has waited many years to hear the truth about 
the Mormons; here it is-told with sympathy, with affection, by a man who steadfastly 
defended and fought for the Mormon people when their present leaders were keeping 
themselves carefully inconspicuous. The Mormon system of religious communism has 
long been known as one of the most interesting social experiments of modern civilization; 
here is an intimate study of it, not only in its success but in the failure that 
has come upon it from the selfish ambitions of its leaders. The power of the Mormon 
hierarchy has been the theme of much imaginative fiction; but here is a story of 
church tyranny and misgovernment in the name of God, that outrages the credibilities 
of art. That such a story could come out of modern America-that such conditions 
could be possible in the democracy today-is an amazement that staggers belief.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">II</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Hon. Frank J. Cannon is the son of George Q. Cannon of Utah, 
who was First Councillor of the Mormon Church from 1880 to 1901. After the death 
of Brigham Young, George Q. Cannon&#39;s diplomacy saved the Mormon communism from destruction 
by the United States government. It was his influence that lifted the curse of polygamy 
from the Mormon faith. Under his leadership Utah obtained the right of statehood; 
and his financial policies were establishing the Mormon people in industrial prosperity 
when he died.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In all these achievements the son shared with his father, and 
in some of them-notably in the obtaining of Utah&#39;s statehood-he had even a larger 
part than George Q. Cannon himself. When the Mormon communities, in 1888, were being 
crushed by proscription and confiscation and the righteous bigotries of Federal 
officials, Frank J. Cannon went to Washington, alone-almost from the doors of a 
Federal prison-and, by the eloquence of his plea for his people, obtained from President 
Cleveland a mercy for the Mormons that all the diplomacies of the Church&#39;s politicians 
had been unable to procure. Again, in 1890, when the Mormons were threatened with 
a general disfranchisement by means of a test oath, he returned to Washington and 
saved them, with the aid of James G. Blaine, on the promise that the doctrine and 
practice of polygamy were to be abandoned by the Mormon Church; and he assisted 
in the promulgation and acceptance of the famous &quot;manifesto&quot; of 1890, by which the 
Mormon Prophet, as the result of a &quot;divine revelation,&quot; withdrew the doctrine of 
polygamy from the practice of the faith.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He organized the Republican party in Utah, and led it in the 
first campaigns that divided the people of the territory on the lines of national 
issues and freed them from the factions of a religious dispute. He delivered to 
Washington the pledges of the Mormon leaders, by which the emancipation of their 
people from hierarchical domination was promised and the right of statehood finally 
obtained. He was elected the first United States Senator from Utah, against the 
unwilling candidacy of his own father, when the intrigues of the Mormon priests 
pitted the father against the son and violated the Church&#39;s promise of non-interference 
in politics almost as soon as it had been given.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">It was his voice, in the Senate, that helped to reawaken the 
national conscience to the crimes of Spanish rule in Cuba, when the &quot;financial interests&quot; 
of this country were holding the government back from any interference in Cuban 
affairs. He was one of the leaders in Washington of the first ill-fated &quot;Insurgent 
Republican&quot; movement against the control of the Republican party by these same piratical 
&quot;interests;&quot; and he was the only Republican Senator who stood to oppose them by 
voting against the iniquitous Dingley tariff bill of 1897. He delivered the speech 
of defiance at the Republican national convention of 1896, when four &quot;Silver Republican&quot; 
Senators led their delegations out of that convention in revolt. And by all these 
acts of independence he put himself in opposition to the politicians of the Mormon 
Church, who were allying themselves with Hanna and Aldrich, the sugar trust, the 
railroad lobby, and the whole financial and commercial Plunderbund in politics that 
has since come to be called &quot;The System.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He returned to Utah to prevent the sale of a United States Senatorship 
by the Mormon Church; and, though he was himself defeated for re-election, he helped 
to hold the Utah legislature in a deadlock that prevented the selection of a successor 
to his seat. He fought to compel the leaders of the Church to fulfil the pledges 
which they had authorized him to give in Washington when statehood was being obtained. 
After his father&#39;s death, when these pledges began to be openly violated, he directed 
his attack particularly against Joseph F. Smith, the new President of the Church, 
who was principally responsible for the Church&#39;s breach of public faith. Through 
the columns of the <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i> he exposed the treasonable return to 
the practice of polygamy which Joseph F. Smith had secretly authorized and encouraged. 
He opposed the election of Apostle Reed Smoot to the United States Senate, as a 
violation of the statehood pledges. He criticized the financial absolutism of the 
Mormon Prophet, which Smith was establishing in partnership with &quot;the Plunderbund.&quot; 
He was finally excommunicated and ostracized, by his father&#39;s successors in power, 
for championing the political and social liberties of the Mormon people whom he 
had helped to save from destruction and whose statehood sovereignty he had so largely 
obtained.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">When the partnership of the Church and &quot;the Interests&quot; prevented 
the expulsion of Apostle Smoot from the Senate, Senator Cannon withdrew from Utah, 
convinced that nothing could be done for the Mormons so long as the national administration 
sustained the sovereignty of the Mormon kingdom as a co-ordinate power in this Republic. 
For the last few years he has been a newspaper editor in Denver, Colorado-on the
<i>Denver Times</i> and the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>-helping the reform movement 
in Colorado against the corporation control of that state, and waiting for the opportunity 
to renew his long fight for the Mormon people.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In the following narrative he returns to that fight. In fulfilment 
of a promise made before he left Utah-and seeing now, in the new &quot;insurgency,&quot; the 
hope of freeing Utah from slavery to &quot;the System&quot;-he here addresses himself to the 
task of exposing the treasons and tyrannies of the Mormon Prophet and the consequent 
miseries among his people.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In the course of his exposition, he gives a most remarkable picture 
of the Mormon people, patient, meek, and virtuous, &quot;as gentle as the Quakers, as 
staunch as the Jews.&quot; He introduces the world for the first time to the conclaves 
of the Mormon eccle-siasts, explains the simplicity of some of them, the bitterness 
of others, the sincerity of almost all-illuminating the dark places of Church control 
with the understanding of a sympathetic experience, and bringing out the virtues 
of the Mormon system as impartially as he exposes its faults. He traces the degradation 
of its communism, step by step and incident by incident, from its success as a sort 
of religious socialism administered for the common good to its present failure as 
a hierarchical capitalism governed for the benefit of its modern &quot;Prophet of Mammon&quot; 
at the expense of the liberty, the happiness, and even the prosperity, of its victims.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">For the first time in the history of the Mormon Church, there 
has arrived a man who has the knowledge and the inclination to explain it.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He does this fearlessly, as a duty, and without any apologies, 
as a public right. &quot;He is not, and never has been an official member of the Church, 
in any sense or form,&quot; Joseph F. Smith, as President of the Church, testified concerning 
him, at Washington in 1904; and though this statement is one of the inspired Prophet&#39;s 
characteristic perversions of the truth, it covers the fact that Senator Cannon 
has always opposed the official tyrannies of the hierarchs. The present Mormon leaders 
accepted his aid in freeing Utah, well aware of his independence. They profited 
by his success with a more or less doubtful gratitude. They betrayed him promptly-as 
they betrayed the nation and their own followers-as soon as they found themselves 
in a position safely to betray. In this book he merely continues an independence 
which he has always maintained, and replies to secret and personal treason with 
a public criticism, to which he has never hesitated to resort.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He begins his story with the year 1888, and devotes the first 
chapters to a depiction of the miseries of the Mormon people in the unhappy days 
of persecution. He continues with the private details of the confidential negotiations 
in Washington and the secret conferences in Salt Lake City by which the Mormons 
were saved. He gives the truth about the political intrigues that accompanied the 
grant of Utah&#39;s statehood, and he relates, pledge by pledge, the covenants then 
given by the Mormon leaders to the nation and since treasonably violated and repudiated 
by them. He explains the progress of this repudiation with an intimate &quot;inside&quot; 
knowledge of facts which the Mormon leaders now deny. And he exposes the horror 
of conditions in Utah today as no other man in America could expose them-for his 
life has been spent in combating the influences of which these conditions are the 
result; and he understands the present situation as a doctor understands the last 
stages of a disease which he has been for years vainly endeavoring to check.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">But aside from all this-aside from his exposure of the Mormon 
despotism, his study of the degradation of a modern community, or his secret history 
of the Church&#39;s dark policies in &quot;sacred places&quot;-he relates a story that is full 
of the most astonishing curiosities of human character and of dramatic situations 
that are almost mediaeval in their religious aspects. He goes from interviews with 
Cleveland or Blaine to discuss American politics with men who believe themselves 
in direct communication with God-who talk and act like the patriarchs of the Old 
Testament-who accept their own thoughts as the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and 
deliver their personal decisions reverently, as the Will of the Lord. He shows men 
and women ready to suffer any martyrdom in defence of a doctrine of polygamy that 
is a continual unhappiness and cross upon them. He depicts the social life of the 
most peculiar sect that has ever lived in a Western civilization. He writes-unconsciously, 
and for the first time that it has ever been written-the naive, colossal drama of 
modern Mormonism.</p>
