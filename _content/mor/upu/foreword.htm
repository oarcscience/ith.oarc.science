<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">FOREWORD</h1>
<p ALIGN="left">On the fourth day of January, 1896, the territory of Utah was 
admitted to statehood, and the proscribed among its people were freed to the liberties 
of American citizenship, upon the solemn covenant of the leaders of the Mormon Church 
that they and their followers would live, thereafter, according to the laws and 
institutions of the nation of which they were allowed to become a part. And that 
gracious settlement of upwards of forty years of conflict was negotiated through 
responsible mediators, was endorsed by the good faith of the non-Mormons of Utah, 
and was sealed by a treaty convention in which the high contracting parties were 
the American Republic and the &quot;Kingdom of God on Earth.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I propose, in this narrative, to show that the leaders of the 
Mormon Church have broken their covenant to the nation; that they have abused the 
confidence of the Gentiles of Utah and betrayed the trust of the people under their 
power, by using that power to prevent the state of Utah from becoming what it had 
engaged to become. I propose to show that the people of Utah, upraised to freedom 
by the magnanimity of the nation, are being made to appear traitorous to the generosity 
that saved them; that the Mormons of Utah are being falsely misled into the peculiar 
dangers from which they thought they had forever escaped; that the unity, the solidarity, 
the loyalty of these fervent people is being turned as a weapon of offence against 
the whole country, for the greater profit of the leaders and the aggrandizement 
of their power. I undertake, in fact, in this narrative, to expose and to demonstrate 
what I do believe to be one of the most direful conspiracies of treachery in the 
history of the United States.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Not that I have anything in my heart against the Mormon people! 
Heaven forbid! I know them to be great in their virtues, wholesome in their relations, 
capable of an heroic fortitude, living by the tenderest sentiments of fraternity, 
as gentle as the Quakers, as staunch as the Jews. I think of them as a man among 
strangers thinks of the dearness of his home. I am bound to them in affection by 
all the ties of life. The smiles of neighborliness, the greetings of friends, all 
the familiar devotion of brothers and sisters, the love of the parents who held 
me in their arms-by these I know them as my own people, and by these I love them 
as a good people, as a strong people, as a people worthy to be strong and fit to 
be loved.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">But it is even through their virtue and by their very strength 
that they are being betrayed. A human devotion-the like of which has rarely lived 
among the citizens of any modern state-is being directed as an instrument of subjugation 
against others and held as a means of oppression upon the Mormons themselves. Noble 
when they were weak, they are being led to ignoble purpose now that they have become 
strong. Praying for justice when they had no power, now that they have gained power 
it is being abused to ends of injustice. Their leaders, reaching for the fleshpots 
for which these simple-hearted devotees have never sighed, have allied themselves 
with all the predaceous &quot;interests&quot; of the country and now use the superhuman power 
of a religious tyranny to increase the dividends of a national plunder. In the long 
years of misery when the Mormons of Utah were proscribed and hunted, because they 
refused to abandon what was to them, at that time, a divine revelation and a confirmed 
article of faith, I sat many times in the gallery of the Senate in Washington, and 
heard discussed new measures of destruction against these victims of their own fidelity, 
and felt the dome above me impending like a brazen weight of national resentment 
upon all our heads. When, a few years later, I stood before the President&#39;s desk 
in the Senate chamber, to take my oath of office as the representative of the freed 
people of Utah in the councils of the nation, I raised my eyes to my old seat of 
terror in the gallery, and pledged myself, in that remembrance, never to vote nor 
speak for anything but the largest measure of justice that my soul was big enough 
to comprehend. By such engagement I write now, bound in a double debt of obligation 
to the nation whose magnanimity then saved us and to the people whom I humbly helped 
to save.</p>
