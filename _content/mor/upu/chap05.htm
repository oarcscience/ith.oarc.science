<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER V</h1>
<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">ON THE ROAD TO FREEDOM</h1>
<p ALIGN="left">In any discussion of the public affairs that make the subject 
matter of this narrative, a line of discrimination must be drawn at the year 1890. 
In that year the Church began a progressive course of submission to the civil law, 
and the nation received each act of surrender with forgiveness. The previous defiances 
of the Mormon people ceased to give grounds for a complaint against them. The old 
harshnesses of the Federal government were cancelled by the new generosity of a 
placated nation. And neither party to the present strife in Utah should go back, 
beyond the period of this composition, to dig up, from the past, its buried wrongs.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In relating, here, some of the events of 1888 and 1889, I have 
tried neither to justify the Mormons nor to defend their prosecutors. I have wished 
merely to make clear the situation in Utah, and to introduce to you, in advance, 
some of the leaders of the distracted community, so that you might understand the 
conditions from which the Mormons escaped by giving their covenant to the nation 
and be able to judge of the obligations and responsibilities of the men who gave 
it.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I have described the promulgation and acceptance of &quot;the manifesto&quot; 
with such circumstance and detail, because of what has since occurred in Utah. Let 
me add that some two weeks later the General Conference of the Church endorsed the 
President&#39;s pronouncement as &quot;authoritative and binding.&quot; And let me point out that 
it was the first and only law of the Mormon Church ever so sustained by triple sanctities-&quot;revealed&quot; 
as a command from God, accepted by the prophets in solemn fraternity assembled, 
and ratified by the vote of the entire &quot;congregation of Israel&quot; before it was declared 
to be binding upon men.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">At first, because of the somewhat indefinite promise of the message 
itself, many of the non-Mormons of Utah remained suspicious and in doubt of it. 
But it was recognized by Judge Zane, in court-on the day following the close of 
the Conference-as an official declaration, &quot;honest and sincere.&#39;&#39; The newspapers 
throughout the whole country so received it. The Church authorities sent assurances 
to Washington that convinced the statesmen, there, of the completeness and finality 
of the submission. And the good faith of the covenant was at last admitted by the 
non-Mormons of Utah and endorsed by their trust. I do not know of any change in 
human affairs-dependent on human will-more speedy, effective and comprehensive than 
this recession. Within the space of a few days a revolution was completed that had 
been sought by the power of our nation and of the civilized world, for a generation, 
with stripes and imprisonment, death, confiscation and the ostracism of the country&#39;s 
public contempt. It had been obtained, I knew, chiefly by the sagacity of the First 
Councillor using the pressure of circumstances to enforce the persuasions of diplomacy. 
I felt that a miracle of change had been brought to pass. He had placed us on the 
road to freedom; and I trusted his guidance to lead us to our goal.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">That goal, to me personally, was the honor of American citizenship-an 
ambition that had been an obsession with me from my earliest youth. I had never 
heard a man on a railroad train talk of how he was going to vote in a national election, 
without feeling a pang of shamed envy; for my lack of citizenship seemed a mark 
of inferiority. The patriotic reading of my boyhood had made the American republic, 
to me, the noblest administration of freemen in the history of government and the 
exercise of its franchise literally the highest dignity of human privilege. I would 
have been as proud-I was as proud when the day came-to vote for the President of 
the United States as he could have been to take his oath of office. I do not believe 
that any poor serf, escaped from the tyranny of Russia, ever saw the American shore 
with a more grateful eye than I looked to the prospect of being admitted, with the 
citizens of Utah, into the enfranchisement of the Republic.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">But it was evident that the Church&#39;s recession from polygamy 
would not be enough to free us, so long as its control of politics remained. Its 
other practices had flourished and been sheltered under its political power; and 
now that the Church had ceased to be a lawbreaker, our friends in Washington were 
properly expecting that it would cease to interfere with its members in the exercise 
of their citizenship. For this reason, when I was notified that I had been selected 
as a member of the advisory committee of the People&#39;s Party (the Church party), 
I went at once to my father and told him that I would not take the place; that I 
intended to work, personally, and through my newspaper, for the political division 
of Utah on the lines of the national parties. He held that until Gentile solidarity 
was dissolved, it would be dangerous to divide the allegiance of the Mormons; but 
he did not stand against my protest; he contented himself-diplomatically-with sending 
me to consult with President Woodruff and Joseph F. Smith. To them, I argued that 
the political emancipation of the Mormon people from ecclesiastical direction was 
as necessary as the recession from polygamy had been. We must be set free to perform 
our duty to the country solely as citizens of the country, before we could expect 
to be given the right to perform it at all. And, for my part, the only faction I 
would consent to take as a member of the advisory committee of the People&#39;s Party 
would be to vote for the dissolution of the party.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">President Woodruff referred me to my father, and advised me to 
be guided by him. Joseph F. Smith urged that a division of the Mormon people on 
national party lines would enable the Liberal (the Gentile) party to march in between. 
I argued in reply that we must divide at some time, and the sooner the better, since 
every year was increasing the Gentile population. They would never split as long 
as we remained solid. And if we were ever to be permitted to nationalize ourselves, 
it would not be until we had dissolved the party organizations whose very names 
were a proof of the continued rule of the Church in politics.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">When he had no more arguments to advance, he gave a reluctant 
assent to mine. I reported back to my father and he approved of my plans. He asked 
me humorously with whom I expected to affiliate, since he knew of no one who was 
likely to go with me; but I could see that he was pleased with my independence and 
hoped I might succeed in doing something to break the deadlock-grapple of Mormon 
and Gentile that held Utah apart from the rest of the country in politics.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">His humorous idea of my undertaking gave its color to my beginnings. 
It was rather a spirited adventure, as I look back upon it now. When we organized 
a Republican Club at Ogden, my intimate friend, Ben E. Rich, and another friend 
named Joseph Belnap, were the only Mormons, so far as I know, who joined me in becoming 
members. Outside of us three, I did not know of another Mormon Republican in the 
whole territory.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Indeed, the status of the Mormon people, in their fancied relation 
to the two great parties of the country, was almost identical with that of the people 
of the South after the Civil War. Practically every Mormon believed himself to be 
a Democrat. Among the young men of the Church there had been occasional attempts 
to form Democratic Clubs. Mr. John T. Caine, delegate in Congress from the territory, 
was a Democrat. My father had sat on the Democratic side of the House. Almost all 
the men who had braved the sentiments of their own states, to speak for us in Congress, 
had been Democrats. And, of course, the administration of the laws that had been 
so cruel to the feelings of the Mormons had been in Republican hands.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Two years earlier, in Ogden, I had spoken in a meeting of Republicans 
that had been called to rejoice over the election of Benjamin Harrison to the Presidency; 
and I was still being taunted by my Mormon friends with having clasped hands with 
&quot;the persecutors of the Prophets.&quot; When I came out, now, as an advocate of Republicanism, 
I was met everywhere with this charge-that I had joined the enemies of the Church, 
that I was assisting the persecutors of my father. The fact that my father approved 
of what I was doing, relieved the seriousness of the situation for me; and the humorous 
assistance of Ben Rich in our political evangelism gave a secret chuckle to many 
of the incidents of our campaign.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">We went from town to town, from district to district, up the 
mountain valleys, across the plains, into mining camps and farming communities-using 
the meeting-houses, the school-rooms, the town halls-taking the afternoon to coax 
the tired workers of the fields or of the mines to come and hear us in the evening, 
and watching them fall asleep in the light of our borrowed kerosene lamps while 
we talked. They came eagerly. Indeed, my own ambition for citizenship-for a right 
to participate in the affairs of the nation-was probably no keener than theirs; 
and they had an innocent curiosity about the questions of national politics, of 
which they had never before been invited to know anything. They listened almost 
devoutly.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;Brethren and sisters,&quot; a bishop exhorted them at a meeting in 
which one of our party was to speak, &quot;we have come to listen to this man, and I 
hope we will be guided in all our reflections by the Spirit of God and that we will 
do nothing to offend that Spirit. Let there be no commotion, no whispering, and, 
above all, no hand clapping.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In a life that had as few diversions as theirs, a political meeting 
was an exciting event. The whole family came, and the mothers brought their babies. 
Surely in no other American community did politics ever have such a homely and serious 
consideration. Certainly no other community would have so quickly understood the 
theories of the two parties or accepted them so implicitly.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">But it was all theory! I recognize, now, that I preached a Republicanism 
that was an ideal of what it should be, rather than any modern faith of the &quot;practical 
politician.&quot; I had gathered it from my reading, from hearing the speeches in Congress, 
from sympathetic conferences with the great men who were responsible for the dogmas 
of the party; and every assurance of grace that their ability could give and my 
credulity accept, I proclaimed religiously as a political salvation to our people. 
I built up an ideal, and then judged the party thereafter according to the measure 
of that ideal. When I found that some of the charges against the Republican party 
were true-charges which I had indignantly repelled-I was as shocked as any pious 
worshipper who ever found that his idol had feet of clay. Our people, having accepted 
the faith with as simple a hope as it was offered, were as easily turned from it 
when they found that it was false. The political moods of Utah, for its first few 
years of statehood, were a <i>puzzle</i> to the &quot;practical&quot; leaders of the parties; 
but to us who understood the impulses of honesty that moved the changes, things 
were as clear as they were encouraging.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">During the previous summer in Washington, I had met General James 
S. Clarkson, then president of the National League of Republican Clubs; and now, 
on his invitation, in the Spring of 1891, Rich and I went to Louisville to speak 
before the national convention of the league. Through the kindness of General Clarkson, 
I was given the official recognition of a perfunctory place on the executive committee 
of the league&#39;s national committee, and came into touch with many of the party leaders. 
It was about this time, I imagine, that they conceived the idea of using the gratitude 
of the Mormons in order to carry Utah and the surrounding states in which the Mormon 
vote might constitute a balance of political power. I know that the idea was old 
and established when I came upon it, in 1894, during the campaign for statehood. 
As I also found, still later, the Republican leaders and the business interests 
with which they were in relation, had their eyes on a distant prospect of fabulous 
financial schemes in which the secret funds of the Church were to help in the building 
of railroads and the promoting of other enterprises of associated capital. But at 
the time of which I am writing, I had not had sufficient experience to suspect the 
motives of the men who encouraged our work in Utah; and I accepted in good faith 
their public declarations that the sole aim of the party was to serve the needs 
of the people of the United States-and therefore of the people of Utah!</p>
<p ALIGN="left">It seemed to me that such a noble principle should win the support 
of Mormon and Gentile alike, and it was on this principle that I appealed for the 
support of both. I was so sure of winning with it that I resented and fought against 
the aid of the Church that came to us as our campaign succeeded.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The People&#39;s Party (the Church Party) had been dissolved (June, 
1891) by the formal action of the executive committee, under the direct instruction 
of the leaders of the Church. The tendency was for its members to organize themselves 
immediately as a Democratic party. They were led by such brilliant and trusted defenders 
of the Church as Franklin S. Richards, Chas. C. Richards, Wm. H. King, James H. 
Moyle, Brigham H. Roberts and Apostle Moses Thatcher; and a group of abler advocates 
could not have been found in any state in the Union. It was against the sentiment 
of the Mormon people, vivified by such inspiring Democracy as these men taught, 
that our little organization of Republicans had to make headway; and an anxiety 
began to show itself among the Church authorities for a less unequal division, and 
consequently a greater appearance of political independence, among the faithful.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Apostle John Henry Smith came out as a Republican stump speaker 
in rivalry with Moses Thatcher, the Democratic Prophet. Joseph F. Smith announced 
himself a Republican descendant of Whigs. Apostle Francis Marion Lyman, in his religious 
ministrations, counselled leading brethren to withhold themselves from the Democratic 
party unless they had gone too far to retreat. Men of ecclesiastical office in various 
parts of the territory-who were regarded as being safe in their wisdom and fidelity-were 
urged to hold themselves and their influence in reserve for such use on <i>either</i> 
side of politics as the future might demand.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Against this ecclesiastical direction of the people&#39;s choice, 
I objected again and again to the Presidency, and my objections seemed to meet with 
acquiescence. It required no prescience on my part to foresee that the growing dislike 
and distrust of Moses Thatcher at Church headquarters would lead to a strife in 
the Church that might be carried into our politics; and I knew how small would be 
the hope of preserving any political independence, if once it were involved in the 
intrigues of priests and their rivalries for a supremacy of influence among the 
people. I was resolved that not even a Church, ruling by &quot;divine right,&quot; should 
interpose between my country and my franchise; and an encroachment that I would 
not permit upon my own freedom, I would not help to inflict upon others.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The men with whom I had been working proposed me as the candidate 
for Congress of the new Utah Republicans; and I was supported by a strong delegation 
from my own country and from other parts of the territory; but I found that I was 
not &quot;satisfactory&quot; to some of the Mormon leaders, and in the convention (1892) Apostle 
John Henry Smith and my cousin George M. Cannon led in an attempt to nominate Judge 
Chas. Bennett, a Gentile lawyer. After a bitter fight of two days and nights, we 
carried the convention against them, and I was nominated.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The Democrats selected, as their candidate, one of the strongest 
characters in the territory, Joseph L. Rawlins. He was the son of a Mormon bishop, 
but he had left the Church immediately upon reaching manhood. He was a great lawyer, 
a staunch Democrat, and wonderfully popular. There followed one of the swiftest 
and most exciting campaigns ever seen in Utah. The whole people rose to it with 
enthusiasm. Our party chairman, Chas. Crane, had a genius for organization; our 
speakers drew crowded meetings; and though charges of Church influence were made 
by both sides, the question of religion was no longer the one that divided Utah.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">We were getting on famously, when an incident occurred that was 
at once disastrous and salutary. While I was away from headquarters, stumping the 
districts, Chairman Crane (who was a Gentile), Ben Rich and Joseph F. Smith, issued 
a pamphlet in Republican behalf called &quot;Nuggets of Truth.&quot; It gave a picture of 
Joseph Smith, the original Prophet, on the first page and a picture of me on the 
last one. (They issued also a certificate, obtained by Joseph F. Smith and given 
out by him, that I was a Mormon &quot;in good standing.&quot;) As soon as I heard of the matter, 
I wired Chairman Crane that unless the pamphlet were immediately withdrawn, I should 
return to Salt Lake City and publicly denounce such methods. It was withdrawn, but 
the damage was done, I was defeated, as I deserved to be-though I was the innocent 
victim of the atrocity-and Mr. Rawlins was elected.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The campaign proved, however, that if the Church leaders would 
only keep their hands off, there was ample strength in either party to make a presentation 
of national issues of sufficient appeal to divide the people on party lines; and 
it was evident that the people would choose the party that made the best showing 
of principles and candidates. &quot;Nuggets of Truth&quot; left us with a nasty sense that 
at no hour were we assured of safety from ecclesiastical interference-or the nefarious 
attempt to make an appearance of such interference-in our political affairs. But 
the disaster that followed, in this instance, was so prompt that we could hope it 
would prove a lesson.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Most important of all, the campaign had made it evident that 
there was now no political mission in Utah for the Liberal (the Gentile) party-assuming 
that the retirement of the Mormon priests from politics was sincere and permanent. 
Accordingly, the organization formally met some months later, and formally dissolved; 
and, by that act, the last great obstacle to united progress was removed from our 
road to statehood, and the men who removed it acted with a generosity that makes 
one of the noblest records of self-sacrifice in the history of the state.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">They could foresee that their dissolution as a separate force 
meant statehood for Utah-a sovereignty in itself that would leave the Gentiles in 
the minority and without any appeal to the nation. Under territorial conditions, 
although the non-Mormons were less than one-third of the population, they had two-thirds 
of the political power. They held all the Federal offices, including executive and 
judicial positions. They had the Governor, with an absolute veto over the acts of 
the Mormon legislature. They had the President and Congress who could annul any 
statute of the territory; and they had with them almost the entire sentiment of 
the nation. It was in their power to have protracted the Mormon controversy, and 
to have withstood the appeal for statehood, to this day.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">They yielded everything; they accepted, in return, only the good 
faith of the Mormons. Was it within the capacity of any human mind to foresee that 
in return for such generosity the Church would ever give over its tabernacles to 
teaching its people to hold in detestation the very names of these men who saved 
us? Was it to be suspected that the political power surrendered by them would ever 
be used as a persecution upon them?-that the liberty, given by them <i>to</i> us, 
would ever afterward be denied them <i>by</i> us ? It was inconceivable. Neither 
in the magnanimity of their minds nor in the gratitude of ours was there a suspicion 
of such a catastrophe.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">During 1891, President Woodruff&#39;s manifesto had been ratified 
in local Church conferences in every &quot;stake of Zion;&quot; and a second General Conference 
had endorsed it in October of that year. President Woodruff, Councillor Joseph F. 
Smith and Apostle Lorenzo Snow went before the Federal Master in Chancery-in a proceeding 
to regain possession of escheated Church property-and swore that the manifesto had 
prohibited plural marriages, that it required a cessation of all plural marriage 
living, and that it was being obeyed by the Mormon people. These facts were recited 
in a petition for amnesty forwarded to President Harrison in December, 1891, accompanied 
by signed statements from Chief Justice Zane, Governor Thomas and other non-Mormons 
who pledged themselves that the petitioners were sincere and that if amnesty were 
granted good faith would be kept. &quot;Our people are scattered,&quot; President Woodruff 
and his apostles declared in their petition. &quot;Homes are made desolate. Many are 
still imprisoned; others are banished and in hiding. Our hearts bleed for these. 
In the past they followed our counsels, and while they are still afflicted our souls 
are in sackcloth and ashes.... As shepherds of a patient and suffering people we 
ask amnesty for them and pledge our faith and honor for their future.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">At Washington, the Church&#39;s attorney, Mr. Franklin S. Richards, 
and delegate John T. Caine supported the petition with their avowals of the sincerity 
of the Church leaders, the genuineness of our political division, and the sanctity 
with which we regarded the promise to obey the laws. The Utah Commission, a non-Mormon 
body, favored amnesty in an official report of September, 1892. And when I went 
to Washington, in the winter of 1892-3, the changed attitude of the Federal authorities 
toward us was strikingly evident.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">President Harrison issued his amnesty proclamation, early in 
January, 1893, to all persons liable to the penalties of the Edmunds-Tucker Act, 
but &quot;on the express condition that they shall in the future faithfully obey the 
laws of the United States . . . and not otherwise.&quot; The proclamation concluded: 
&quot;Those who fail to avail themselves of the clemency hereby offered will be vigorously 
prosecuted.&quot; Not a polygamist in Utah, to my knowledge, declined to take advantage 
of the mercy, by refusing the expressly implied pledge.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Meanwhile the campaign had been continued for the return of the 
escheated Church property and for the passage of an Enabling Act that should permit 
the territory to organize for statehood.[<u><a name="text1" href="#foot1" style="text-decoration: none">1</a></u>] 
Joseph L. Rawlins, Democratic delegate from Utah, worked valiantly among the Democrats, 
and he was assisted by the influence of Mr. Franklin S. Richards and John T. Caine 
and others among their old associates in that party. But, in the very midst of the 
fight, we were advised that, unless the Republican leaders would let the Enabling 
Act go through, the Democratic leaders would falter in our advocacy. I had been 
urged to go to Washington by the Presidency to do what I might to allay Republican 
antagonism, and I found that a number of self-appointed lobbyists (who expected 
&quot;political preferments and other rewards from the Church in the event of statehood) 
had been using the most amazing arguments in our behalf. For example, they told 
some of the &quot;financial Senators&quot; that the Church had fourteen million dollars in 
secret funds with which to help build a railroad to the coast as soon as statehood 
should be granted. They cited the number of the Church&#39;s adherents in all the states 
and territories of the Pacific Coast and as far east as Iowa and Missouri, and predicted 
that the gratitude of these people to the Republicans who were helping to free Utah 
would enable the Republican party to control a balance of political power in the 
several states. They declared positively that plural marriages and plural marriage 
living had utterly ceased among the Mormons for all time. And they made such statements 
with great particularity to Senator Orville H. Platt, of Connecticut, who was too 
wise a man to credit them.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">As soon as I returned to Washington, he summoned me to a private 
meeting, in his parlor in the Arlington Hotel, and confronted me with one of the 
Republican lobbyists who had been soliciting his personal favor and his almost controlling 
influence. &quot;Now, Mr. Cannon,&quot; he said, in his dry way, &quot;have the Mormons stopped 
living with their plural wives? And will there never be another case of plural marriage 
among them?&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I remembered the lesson of my interview with him at the time 
of the campaign against the disfranchisement bill, and I answered: &quot;No. Not all 
the men of the Church have complied fully with the law. So far as I know, all the 
general authorities of the Church-with two or three exceptions-are fulfilling the 
covenant they gave; and so far as I can judge there will never be another plural 
marriage ceremony with the consent or connivance of the leaders of the Church. But 
human nature is very much the same in Utah as it is in Connecticut. Here and there, 
no doubt, a man feels that he&#39;s under an obligation to keep his covenant with his 
plural wives in preference to the covenant of his accepted amnesty; and there and 
here, possibly, in the future, some man will break the law and defy the orders of 
the Church and take a plural wife. But the leaders of the Church do not countenance 
either proceeding, and any man who violates the law, in either respect, offends 
against the revelations of the Church and, I believe, will be dealt with as an apostate. 
I come direct from the Presidency of the Church, and I am authorized to pledge their 
word of honor that they will themselves obey the law and do all in their power as 
men and leaders to bring their people into harmony with the institutions of this 
country as rapidly as possible.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Senator Platt had slowly unwrapped him, self, rising from his 
chair to his full height of more than six feet, in a lank and alarming indignation. 
&quot;There,&quot; he said, striding up and down the room. &quot;That&#39;s it! That&#39;s <i>just</i> 
it. These people have been telling us that you were obeying the law-all of you-in 
every instance-and would always obey it. And now you come here and admit, openly, 
that some of you, to whom we have granted amnesty, are breaking your word-and that
<i>&#39;possibly&#39;</i> others, in the future, will do the same thing!&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;Senator,&quot; I pleaded, &quot;what confidence could you have in me if 
I were to tell you the Mormons were so superhuman that in a single day they could 
eliminate all their human characteristics? I&#39;m asking you to recognize that the 
tendency imparted to a whole community is more important than any one man&#39;s breach 
of the law. Believe me, if you grant us our statehood, there will never be any lawbreaking
<i>sanctioned</i> or protected by the Church leaders, and just as speedily as possible 
the entire system will be brought into harmony with the institutions of the nation. 
I&#39;m telling you the truth.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He turned on me to ask, abruptly, how the polygamists had adjusted 
their family affairs.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I answered that in nearly all cases within my personal knowledge, 
the polygamist had relinquished conjugal relations with his plural wives with the 
full acquiescence of them and their children. He supported them, cared for the children, 
and in all other ways acted as the guardian and protector of the household. In a 
few cases men had gone to an extreme. For instance, my uncle, Angus M. Cannon-president 
of the Salt Lake &quot;stake of Zion,&quot; a man of most decided character-had declared that 
he had entered into his marriage relations with his wives under a covenant that 
gave them equality in his regards; and in order that he might not wound the sensibilities 
of any, he had separated himself from all.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I reminded Senator Platt that with such examples on the part 
of the leaders, there could be no general law-breaking among the Mormons, and that 
gradually the polygamous element would accommodate itself to the demands of law 
and the commands of God.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He waved us away with a curt announcement that he would have 
to think the matter over. If I had not known the essential justice and common sense 
under his dry and irascible exterior, I might have been alarmed. The lobbyist&#39;s 
concern was almost comic. As soon as we were out of hearing of the Senator&#39;s apartment, 
shaking both fists frantically at me, he cried: &quot;You&#39;ve ruined everything! We had 
him. We had him-all right-until you came down here and let the cat out of the bag! 
You <i>knew</i> what we&#39;d been telling him. <i>Why</i> didn&#39;t you stick to it?&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I replied with equal warmth: &quot;<i>You</i> may lie all you please; 
but if we have to win Utah&#39;s statehood with lies I don&#39;t want it. Senator Platt 
has been generous to us in our time of need, and I don&#39;t intend to deceive him-or 
any other man.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">As a matter of fact, this was not only common honesty; it was 
also the best policy. Senator Platt was, from that time to the day of his death, 
a good friend and wise counsellor of the people of Utah. And I wish to lay particular 
stress upon this conversation with him, because it was a type of many had with such 
men as he. Fred T. Dubois, delegate in Congress from the territory of Idaho and 
subsequently Senator from that state, had been perhaps the strongest single opponent, 
in Washington, of the Mormon Church; he took our promises of honor, as Senator Platt 
did, and he pacified Senator Cullom, Senator Pettigrew and many others among our 
antagonists, who afterwards told me that they had accepted the pledges given by 
Senator Dubois in our behalf.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">They recognized that the Church and the community ought not to 
be held responsible for a few possible cases of individual resistance or offence, 
so long as there should be a strict adherence by the Church and its leaders to their 
personal and community covenant. I emphasize the nature of this generous appreciation 
of our difficulties, because the present-day polygamists in Utah claim that there 
was a &quot;tacit understanding,&quot; between the statesmen in Washington and the agents 
of the Church, to the effect that the polygamists of that time might continue to 
live with their plural wives. This is not true. There never was any such understanding, 
to my knowledge. And there could not have been one, in the circumstances, <i>without</i> 
my knowledge.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">For though I did not know what delegate Rawlins, and former delegate 
Caine, and our attorney, Mr. Richards, were saying in their private interviews with 
senators and congressmen, I know that in all the frequent conversations I had with 
them I never heard an intimation of any &quot;tacit understanding&quot; beyond the one which 
I have defined.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">For my part I was more than eager to have all our political disabilities 
removed, the Church property restored, and the right of statehood accorded-believing 
implicitly in the sincerity of the Mormon leaders. I knew President Woodruff too 
well to doubt the pellucid character of his mind and purpose. I knew from my father&#39;s 
personal assurance-and from his constant practice from that time to the day of his 
death-that he was acting in good faith. I knew that the community was gladly following 
where these men led. I saw no slightest indication that any reactionary policy was 
likely to be entered upon in Utah, or that our people would accept it if it <i>were.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="left">The Church&#39;s personal property was restored by an Act of Congress 
approved October 25, 1893, but it was stipulated in the Act that the money was not 
to be used for the support of any church buildings in which &quot;the rightfulness of 
the practice of polygamy&quot; should be taught. Similarly, when the Enabling Act was 
approved, in July 16, 1894, it, too, provided that &quot;polygamous or plural marriage&quot; 
was forever prohibited. A constitutional convention was held at Salt Lake City under 
the provisions of that act, and a constitution was adopted in which it was provided 
that &quot;polygamous or plural marriages&quot; were forever prohibited, that the territorial 
laws against polygamy were to be continued in force, that there should be &quot;no union 
of church and state,&quot; and that no church should &quot;dominate the state or interfere 
with its functions.&quot; Upon no other basis would the nation have granted us our statehood; 
and we accepted the grant, knowing the expressed condition involved in that acceptance.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">But there was one other gift that came to us from the nation-by 
Congressional enactment and later by Utah statute as a consequence of statehood; 
and that gift was the legitimizing of every child born of plural marriage before 
January, 1896. The solemn benignity of the concession touched me, as it must have 
touched many, to the very heart of gratitude. By it, ten thousand children were 
taken from the outer darkness of this world&#39;s conventional exclusion and placed 
within the honored relations of mankind. It was a tribute to the purity and sincerity 
of the Mormon women who had borne the cross of plural marriage, believing that God 
had commanded their suffering. It recognized the holy nature and honorable intent 
of the marriages of these women, by according their children every right of legal 
inheritance from their fathers. If all other covenants could be forgotten and their 
proof obliterated, <i>this</i> should remain as Utah&#39;s pledge of honor-sacred for 
the sake of the Mormon mothers, holy in the name of the uplifted child.</p>
<p ALIGN="left"><a name="foot1" href="#text1">1</a> Statehood seemed still very 
far away. There was a Trans-Mississippi Congress held at Ogden in 1892, and though 
the delegates-coming from all the states and territories &quot;west of the river,&quot;-were 
the guests of the people of Utah, so hopeless was our status in the consideration 
of mankind that the delegates from the territories of New Mexico and <i>Arizona</i> 
would not let our names be joined to theirs in a resolution for statehood which 
we wished the committee on resolutions to propose to the Congress. Governor Prince 
of New Mexico replied, to our plea for a share in the resolution, that he did not 
intend to damn New Mexico by having her mixed up with Utah. We appealed to the Congress, 
and we were saved by a speech made by Thos. M. Patterson of Colorado, subsequently 
senator from Colorado, who carried the day for us. At a recent Trans-Mississippi 
Congress held in Denver, I sat with ex-Senator Patterson to hear Mr. Prince still 
proposing resolutions in support of statehood for New Mexico. Twenty years later!</p>
