<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER X</h1>
<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">ON THE DOWNWARD PATH</h1>
<p ALIGN="left">During the last years of President Woodruff&#39;s life there had 
been a slow decline of the feeling that it was necessary for self-protection that 
the hierarchy should preserve a political control over the people. I cannot say 
that the feeling had wholly passed. It had continued to show itself, here and there, 
whenever a candidate was so pertinacious in his independence that words of disfavor 
were sent out from Church headquarters in one of those whispers that carry to the 
confines of the kingdom of the priests. But the progress was apparent. The tendency 
was clear. And in 1898 there was neither internal revolt nor external threat to 
provoke a renewal of the exercise of that force which is necessarily despotic if 
it be used at all.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Yet, in September, 1898, President Snow, if he did not instigate, 
at least authorized the candidacy of Brigham H. Roberts for Congress-a polygamist 
who had been threatened with excommunication for his opposition to the &quot;political 
manifesto&quot; of 1896 and who had recanted and made his peace with the hierarchy. His 
election, now, would be a proof that the Church could punish a brilliant orator 
and courageous citizen in the time of his independence and then reward him in the 
day of his submission; and the authorities would thus demonstrate to all the people 
that the one way to political preferment lay through the annihilation of self-will 
and the submergence of national loyalty in priestly devotion. Such a candidacy was 
a sufficient shame to the state; but there was also a United States Senatorship 
to be bestowed; and it was deliberately bargained for, between the Church authorities 
and a man who deserved better than the alliance into which he entered.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Alfred W. McCune was a citizen of Utah who had gone out from 
the territory in the days of its poverty (and his own), had made a fortune in British 
Columbia and Montana, and had returned to his home state to enrich it with his generosities. 
He was not a Mormon, but he had wide Mormon connections. He spent his millions in 
public enterprises and benefactions; and the Church had benefited in the sum of 
many thousands by his subscriptions to its funds and institutions.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Apostle Heber J. Grant, a Republican by sentiment but a Democrat 
by pretension, was selected by President Snow to baiter the Senatorship to McCune. 
There can be no doubt of it. Everyone immediately suspected it. Letters from Grant, 
published in the newspapers of January, 1899, subsequently confirmed it. And President 
Snow&#39;s actions, toward the end of the campaign, proved it.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The other candidates were Judge O. W. Powers, a prominent Democrat; 
William H. King, also a Democrat, a former member of Congress and at one time a 
Federal Judge; and myself as an independent Silver Republican. I had not allied 
myself with the Democrats after withdrawing from the Republican convention of 1896, 
and the Republican machine in Utah (thanks to the power of the &quot;interests&quot;) had 
repudiated me, in September, 1898, by adopting a platform that refused to support 
as Senator any man who had opposed the Dingley Tariff Bill. But I had the votes 
of my own county of Weber, and some other votes that had been pledged to me before 
the election of members of the legislature; and though my return to the Senate seemed 
plainly impossible, I went into the fight in fulfilment of understandings which 
I had with progressive elements in Utah and with the &quot;insurgents,&quot; of that day, 
in Washington.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">During the campaign to elect members of the Legislature, I supported 
the Democratic State and Congressional ticket. Brigham H. Roberts had been nominated 
for Congress on this ticket-despite the protests of my father and many others who 
foresaw the evil results of electing a polygamist. I accepted Roberts&#39; nomination 
as proof that this question must be settled anew at Washington; and I contented 
myself with predicting, throughout the campaign, that the House of Representatives 
would determine whether it would admit a polygamist and a member of the hierarchy 
as a lawmaker, and would so forever dispose of these ecclesiastical candidacies 
of which Utah refused to dispose for itself. (And it is a fact that since the prompt 
exclusion of Roberts from the House of Representatives no known polygamist has been 
elected to either House of Congress.) A Democratic legislature was elected, and 
A. W. McCune was put forward prominently as a candidate for the United States senator-ship. 
He was assisted by his own newspaper, the <i>Salt Lake Herald,</i> by numberless 
business interests, cleverly by the <i>Deseret News</i> (the organ of the hierarchy) 
flagrantly and for financial reasons by Apostle Heber J. Grant, and incidentally 
by the Smiths on behalf of the Church. Also a Republican assistance was given him 
by my former colleague in the Senate, Arthur Brown, who specialized as an opponent 
to my candidacy.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">My old campaign manager, Ben Rich, had been withdrawn from me 
by a Church order appointing him in control of the Eastern missions. I was without 
the support of either the Democratic or Republican organizations: my following was 
a personal one; and consequently the attack upon me chiefly took the form of stories 
of personal immorality, privately circulated. These stories culminated in a motion 
before the Woman&#39;s Republican Club, demanding my withdrawal from the Senatorial 
contest on the ground of &quot;gross misconduct&quot;-a motion introduced by a Mrs. Anna M. 
Bradley, a woman politician (who was a stranger to me), with the assistance of Mrs. 
Arthur Brown, wife of the former Senator.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">If I ever had any resentment against these unfortunate women 
for allowing themselves to be used as the agents of slander, it passed in the miseries 
that overtook them later; for Mrs. Brown died of the scandal of her husband&#39;s intimacy 
with Mrs. Bradley, and Mrs. Bradley shot and killed ex-Senator Brown, in a Washington 
hotel, because he refused to marry her and recognize her child after her divorce 
from her husband.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">My anger then, and since, was not against the women, but against 
the men who hid behind them-against Apostle Heber J. Grant and Apostle John Henry 
Smith and their tool, ex-Senator Brown. In my anger I decided to take an action 
that looked as desperate as it proved successful, I hired the Salt Lake Theatre 
for a night (February 9, 1899), and announced that I would speak on &quot;Senatorial 
Candidates and Pharisees&quot;-intending to use the opportunity of self-defence in order 
to attack the &quot;financial apostles&quot; who were selling Church influence.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In taking that step I understood, of course, that it meant the 
death for me of any political ambition in Utah. It meant offending my father, who 
besought me not to raise my hand against &quot;the Lord&#39;s annointed,&quot; but to leave my 
enemies &quot;to God&#39;s justice&quot;-as <i>he</i> had always done with <i>his.</i> It meant 
a breach with many of my friends in the Church who would blindly resent my criticism 
of the political apostles as an encouragement to the enemies of the faith. But the 
part that I had taken in helping Utah to gain its statehood made it impossible for 
me to stand aside, now, and see all our pledges broken, all our promises betrayed. 
I had to offer myself as a sacrifice to hierarchical resentment in the hope that 
my destruction might give at least a momentary pause to the reactionaries in their 
career.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">It is needless that I should relate all the incidents of that 
wild night. The theatre was packed with people who joined me for the moment in a 
sympathetic protest against the disgrace of Utah. President Lorenzo Snow, his two 
councillors and several apostles were present, and I spoke without any reservations 
on account of personal relationship, nay own candidacy or the possible effect upon 
my own affairs. I appealed to the people to prevent the sale of Utah&#39;s senatorship 
to McCune by Apostle Grant and the Church reactionaries; and by turning the light 
of publicity upon the methods that were being employed in the legislature, I made 
it impossible for the hierarchy to sway enough votes to elect McCune. The men who 
had pledged themselves to the other candidates could not be shaken from their support 
without a national scandal. The election settled for the time into a deadlock, in 
which no candidate could obtain enough votes to elect him.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Apostle Heber J. Grant started to write letters that should counteract 
the effect of my speech, but President Snow forbade him to continue the controversy 
and sent word to me that he had forbidden Grant to continue it. I did not know why 
President Snow wished me to feel that he was friendly to me, but I was soon to learn.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The deadlock in the legislature continued, in spite of all the 
efforts of the Church authorities to break it. Our political workers, summoned one 
by one by messengers from Church headquarters, had gone to interviews from which 
they did not return to us-until I had left only Judge Ed. F. Colborn (a famous character 
in Kansas, Colorado and Utah), and an old friend, Jesse W. Fox. One night, about 
a week after the meeting in the theatre, we three were sitting alone in my rooms, 
when the door opened and someone beckoned to Fox. He went out. Judge Colborn opened 
a window to see Fox getting into a carriage with a man from Church headquarters-and 
we knew that our last worker was gone.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He returned only to tell me that President Snow wished to see 
me-that if I were willing, the President would like to have me call upon him, at 
half past nine the following evening, in his residence. And I understood the significance 
of such an invitation for such an hour. I had been too often in contact with the 
power of the Prophets to doubt what was required of me. I was curious merely to 
know what form the ultimatum would take.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">President Snow was then living with his youngest wife in a house 
a few blocks from the offices of the Presidency. I drove there in a carriage and 
ordered the driver to wait for me. President Snow opened the door to me himself, 
received me with his usual engaging smile, and ushered me into a reception room 
that was shut off, by portieres, from a larger parlor. There, when he had invited 
me to be seated, he said, winningly: &quot;I was not sure you would come in answer to 
my message.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I assured him that I had not so far lost my regard for the men 
with whom my father was associated. &quot;And besides,&quot; I said, &quot;if there were no other 
reason, it is my place, as the younger of the two, to attend on your convenience.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;I did not know,&quot; he replied, &quot;but that you thought me one of 
the &#39;Pharisees&#39; of whom you spoke.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I did not accept this invitation to reply that I did <i>not</i> 
consider him one of the Pharisees. I explained merely that I had identified the 
Pharisees in my speech by name and deed and accusation. &quot;Unless something there 
said is applicable to you, I have no charge to make against you.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He excused himself a moment to go to an infant whom we could 
hear crying in an inner room; and, when he returned, he had the child in his arms-a 
little girl, in a night gown. He sat down, petting her, stroking her hair with his 
supple lean hand, affectionately, and smiling with a sort of absent-minded tenderness 
as he took up the conversation again.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">This memory of him sticks in my mind as one of the most extraordinary 
pictures of my experience. I knew that I had come there to hear my own or some other 
person&#39;s political death sentence. I knew that he would not have invited me at such 
an hour, with such secrecy, unless the issue of our conference was to be something 
dark and fatal. And in the soft radiance of the lamp he sat smiling-fragile of build, 
almost spirituelle, white-haired, delicately cultured-soothing the child who played 
with his long silvery beard and blinked sleepily. He inquired whether my carriage 
was waiting for me, and I replied that it was. He asked me to dismiss it. When I 
returned to the room, the little girl was resting quiet, and he excused himself 
to take her to her cot. I heard him closing the doors behind him as he came back. 
&quot;We may now talk with perfect freedom,&quot; he announced. &quot;There&#39;s no one else in this 
part of the house.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He sat down in his chair, composing himself with an air that 
might have distinguished one of the ancient kings. &quot;I have sent for you to talk 
about the Senatorial situation. May I speak plainly to you?&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I replied that he might. He was watching me, under his gray eyebrows, 
with his soft eyes, in which there was a glitter of blackness but none of the rheum 
of old age.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;It would be most unfortunate,&quot; he said, &quot;for us, as a people, 
if we failed to elect a Senator. I&#39;ve had many business and other anxieties for 
the Church, and I want this question settled. If we act wisely-with the power and 
influence at our command-aid will come to me. I think you would not willingly permit 
our situation to become more difficult.&quot; He must have seen a change in my expression-a 
change that indicated how well I understood the significance of this guarded introduction. 
Suddenly, his manner broke into animation, and holding out both hands to me, palms 
up, he said, smiling: &quot;You must know, Brother Frank, that I had nothing to do with 
Mr. McCune&#39;s candidacy for the Senate, do you not? I was not responsible for what 
Brother Grant did. Before we go on, I want you to acquit me of responsibility for 
that project.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;President Snow,&quot; I replied, &quot;I can&#39;t admit so much. I, too, 
wish to talk plainly-with your permission. Your responsibility is evident even to 
the casual observer-to say nothing of one reared as I&#39;ve been. Every man in this 
community knows that when you point your finger your apostles go, and when you crook 
your finger your apostles return-and Heber J. Grant has only done what you permitted 
him to do with your full knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He drew himself up, coldly. &quot;What I have done,&quot; he retorted, 
&quot;has been done with the knowledge of my Councillors.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The thrust was obvious. I replied: &quot;If my father desires to discuss 
with me his responsibility for this indignity to the state, he knows I&#39;m at his 
command. And if I have any charge to make, involving his good faith toward the country, 
I&#39;ll seek him alone.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;Very well,&quot; he said, with a frigid suavity. &quot;We will leave that 
part of the question.&quot; He paused. &quot;Last night,&quot; he continued, &quot;lying on my bed, 
I had a vision. I saw this work of God injured by the political strife of the brethren. 
And the voice of the Lord came to me, directing me to see that your father was elected 
to the Senate.&#39;&#39; He studied me a moment before he added: &quot;What have you to say?&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I answered: &quot;It seems to me impossible. This legislature is strongly 
Democratic. My father&#39;s a Republican. It seems to me not only impracticable but 
very unwise-if it could be done.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;Never mind that,&quot; he said. &quot;The Lord will take care of the event. 
I want you to withdraw from the race and throw your strength to your father. It 
is the will of the Lord that you do so.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;Have you a revelation to that effect also?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He answered, pontifically, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll publish it to the world, 
then, the same as other revelations?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he replied. &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Then I&#39;ll not obey 
it,&quot; I said, &quot;because if God is ashamed of it, <i>I</i> am.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">His air of prophetic authority changed to one of combative resolution. 
He explained that one of the other candidates, a strong Democrat, had agreed to 
accept the revelation if I would; that the two of us could give our strength to 
the church candidate; that the Church would turn to my father the votes that it 
had already in command for McCune, and my father&#39;s election would be carried.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I felt that the thumb-screws were being put on me again. For 
the second time I was being forced to the point of denying the Sena-torship to my 
father by refusing him my support. And there could not have been, for me, a more 
vivid and instantaneous illumination of the hidden depths in this Church system-or 
in the individual Prophet of the cult-than was made by Snow&#39;s determined insistence 
that I should break my word of honor to the people of the state and of the nation, 
pledge that broken faith to him, induce all my supporters in the legislature to 
violate their covenants-Mormon and Gentile alike!-and upon his mere assumption of 
divine authority, direct Mormon and Gentile to stultify and disgrace themselves 
forever as men and public officials. There was something appalling in the calculating 
cruelty with which he proposed to devote us all to destruction and dishonor. There 
was something inhumanly malignant in the plan to use my known affection for my father 
in order to make me guilty of the very betrayal of the people which I had publicly 
denounced. I looked at him-and heard him, now, placidly, confidently, with a renewed 
suavity, urging me to <i>do</i> the thing.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;President Snow,&quot; I interrupted, &quot;does my father know of this?&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He answered: &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;I&#39;m glad of it,&quot; I said. (And I was!) &quot;This is not the way to 
work out either the destiny of &#39;God&#39;s people&#39; or the destiny of this state. It would 
place my father in a most humiliating position to be elected-at the orders of the 
Church-under the assumption that God Almighty had directed men to break their solemn 
promises to their constituents. I have as high an admiration for my father&#39;s wisdom 
and ability as you or the Democratic candidate who has offered to withdraw at the 
will of the Church, but I should be paying no honor to my father by dishonoring 
my pledge to my constituents and asking other men to dishonor theirs.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He dismissed me with an air of benignant sorrow!</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The deadlock in the legislature continued unbroken. Among my 
supporters was Lewis W. Shurtliff, the President of the &quot;Stake of Zion&quot; in which 
I lived; he was one of the highest Church dignitaries in the legislature and was 
regarded as my foremost champion in the Senatorial contest. On the last day of the 
legislative session, at President Snow&#39;s instruction, my father, known as a Republican, 
was offered as a senatorial candidate to this Democratic legislature, and all the 
power of the Church influence was thrown to him. President Shurtliff&#39;s wife came 
to our headquarters, that night, and knelt, with a number of other ladies, to pray 
that her husband might be spared the humiliation of breaking his repeated promise 
not to desert me! We all knew that if he broke his promise, it would cause <i>him</i> 
more mental anguish than anyone else; but we knew, too, that if the command came 
from Church headquarters, he would have to obey it. Men broke their political pledges 
to their people and outraged their own feelings of personal independence or partisan 
loyalty, rather than offend against &quot;the will of the Lord.&quot; The forces of the other 
candidates went to pieces, and on the last night of the session my father&#39;s vote 
reached twenty-three. (It required thirty-two votes to elect.)</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The situation was saved by the action of a number of Democrats 
who got together and obtained a recess; when the recess was ended, a final ballot 
was taken, and, since no candidate had enough votes to elect him, the presiding 
officer, by preconcertment, declared the joint assembly adjourned <i>sine die,</i> 
by operation of law. No Senator was elected.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">But it was the last time that the Church authorities were to 
be balked. Since that day, they have dictated the nominations and carried the elections 
of the United States Senators from Utah as if these were candidates for a church 
office. The present Senator, Reed Smoot, is an apostle of the Church; he obtained 
the Mormon President&#39;s &quot;permission&quot; to become a candidate, as he admitted to an 
investigating committee of the Senate; and when the recent tariff bill was being 
attacked by insurgent Republicans and carried by Senator Aldrich, Senator Smoot 
acted as Aldrich&#39;s lieutenant in debate, and remained to watch the defence of the 
&quot;interests&quot; when his chief was absent from the Senate chamber. (Not because Smoot 
was such an able defender of those &quot;interests&quot;! Not because his constituents would 
uphold his course! But because he <i>has</i> no constituents, and is responsible 
to no one but the hierarchical partners of those &quot;interests.&quot;)</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Every pledge of the Mormon leaders that the Church would not 
interfere in politics has been broken at every election in Utah since President 
Snow that night pleaded to me that he had had many business anxieties for the Church 
and that if we elected the Church candidate &quot;aid&quot; would come to him. The covenants 
by which Utah obtained its statehood have been violated again and again. The provisions 
of the state constitution have been nullified. The trust of the Mormon people has 
been abused; their political liberties have been denied them; their Gentile brethren 
have been betrayed. And all this has been done <i>not</i> for the protection of 
the people, who were threatened with no proscription-and <i>not</i> for the advancement 
of the faith, which has been free to work out its own future. It has been done as 
a part of the alliance between the &quot;financial&quot; prophets of the Church and the financial 
&quot;interests&quot; of the country-which have been exploiting the people of Utah as they 
have exploited the whole nation with the aid of the ecclesiastical authorities in 
Utah.</p>
