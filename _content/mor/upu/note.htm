<p ALIGN="left">When Harvey J. O&#39;Higgins was in Denver, in the spring of 1910, 
working with Judge Ben B. Lindsey on the manuscript of &quot;The Beast and the Jungle,&quot; 
for <i>Everybody&#39;s Magazine,</i> he met the Hon. Frank J. Cannon, formerly United 
States Senator from Utah, and heard from him the story of the betrayal of Utah by 
the present leaders of the Mormon Church. This story the editor of <i>Everybody&#39;s 
Magazine</i> commissioned Messrs. Cannon and O&#39;Higgins to write. They worked on 
it for a year, verifying every detail of it from government reports, controversial 
pamphlets, Mormon books of propaganda, and the newspaper files of current record. 
It ran through nine numbers of the magazine, and not so much as a successful contradiction 
was ever made of one of the innumerable incidents or accusations that it contains. 
It is here published in book form at somewhat greater length than the magazine could 
print it. It is a joint work, but the autobiographic &quot;I&quot; has been used throughout, 
because it is Mr. Cannon&#39;s personal narrative of his personal experience.</p>
