# Pearl of Great Price: Abraham: Chapter 5

<span id="v1">  1 And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth, and
all the hosts of them.</span>  
<span id="v2">  2 And the Gods said among themselves: On the seventh
time we will end our work, which we have counseled; and we will rest on
the seventh time from all our work which we have counseled.</span>  
<span id="v3">  3 And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time, because
that on the seventh time they would rest from all their works which they
(the Gods) counseled among themselves to form; and sanctified it. And
thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among
themselves to form the heavens and the earth.</span>  
<span id="v4">  4 And the Gods came down and formed these the
generations of the heavens and of the earth, when they were formed in
the day that the Gods formed the earth and the heavens,</span>  
<span id="v5">  5 According to all that which they had said concerning
every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of
the field before it grew; for the Gods had not caused it to rain upon
the earth when they counseled to do them, and had not formed a man to
till the ground.</span>  
<span id="v6">  6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered
the whole face of the ground.</span>  
<span id="v7">  7 And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground,
and took his spirit (that is, the man's spirit), and put it into him;
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a
living soul.</span>  
<span id="v8">  8 And the Gods planted a garden, eastward in Eden, and
there they put the man, whose spirit they had put into the body which
they had formed.</span>  
<span id="v9">  9 And out of the ground made the Gods to grow every tree
that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; the tree of life, also,
in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and
evil.</span>  
<span id="v10">  10 There was a river running out of Eden, to water the
garden, and from thence it was parted and became into four
heads.</span>  
<span id="v11">  11 And the Gods took the man and put him in the Garden
of Eden, to dress it and to keep it.</span>  
<span id="v12">  12 And the Gods commanded the man, saying: Of every
tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,</span>  
<span id="v13">  13 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou
shalt not eat of it; for in the time that thou eatest thereof, thou
shalt surely die. Now I, Abraham, saw that it was after the Lord's time,
which was after the time of Kolob; for as yet the Gods had not appointed
unto Adam his reckoning.</span>  
<span id="v14">  14 And the Gods said: Let us make an help meet for the
man, for it is not good that the man should be alone, therefore we will
form an help meet for him.</span>  
<span id="v15">  15 And the Gods caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam;
and he slept, and they took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in
the stead thereof;</span>  
<span id="v16">  16 And of the rib which the Gods had taken from man,
formed they a woman, and brought her unto the man.</span>  
<span id="v17">  17 And Adam said: This was bone of my bones, and flesh
of my flesh; now she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
man;</span>  
<span id="v18">  18 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one
flesh.</span>  
<span id="v19">  19 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and
were not ashamed.</span>  
<span id="v20">  20 And out of the ground the Gods formed every beast of
the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to see
what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living
creature, that should be the name thereof.</span>  
<span id="v21">  21 And Adam gave names to all cattle, to the fowl of
the air, to every beast of the field; and for Adam, there was found an
help meet for him.</span>
