<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> the autumn of 1847 one Thomas Grover arrived with his family on the bank of a stream twelve miles north of Salt Lake City, and now called Centreville Creek. His intention was to pasture stock for the winter; and for this purpose a spot was chosen where the stream spreading over the surface forms plats of meadow-land, the soil being a black, gravelly loam. Here Grover, joined by others in the spring, resolved to remain, though in the neighborhood were encamped several bands of Indians, and this notwithstanding that as yet there was no white settlement north of Salt Lake City. Land was ploughed and sown in wheat and vegetables, the crops being more promising than those to the south. But in May of the following year the settlers were startled, not by the war-whoop of the Utahs, but by hordes of black monster crickets, swarming down from the bench-lands, as at Salt Lake City, and bringing destruction on field and garden. They turned out to do battle with the foe; ditches were dug around the grain-fields, and the</p>

<p>water of the stream diverted into them, while men, women, and children, armed with clubs, checked the advance of the devouring host. Enough of the crop was saved to supply the wants of the settlers, and their energy, on this occasion, coupled with a supposed</p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="green">p. 307</font></A></p>  
<p>surveyed in the autumn of 1849, and the place was named Centreville.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near Centreville, in what was afterward Davis county, a settlement was begun in the spring of 1848 by Peregrine Sessions, the place being called Bountiful.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_465"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1841 the country round where the city of Ogden was laid out was held as a Spanish grant by Miles M. Goodyear, who built a fort, consisting of a stockade and a few log houses, near the confluence of the Weber and Ogden rivers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_466"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> On the 6th of June, 1848, James Brown, of the battalion, coming from California with $5,000, mostly in gold-dust, purchased the tract from Goodyear.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_467"></A><A HREF="#fn_467"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> As it was one of the most fertile spots in all that region, grain and vegetables being raised in abundance, not only numbers of the brethren from Salt Lake City, but after a while gentiles from the western states, settled there. In August 1850 Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, and others laid out the city of Ogden, so called from the name of the river.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_468"></A><A HREF="#fn_468"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> The</p>

<p>president urged the people to move at once to their city lots, and to build for themselves substantial dwellings, a meeting-house, and a school-house, to fence their gardens and plant fruit-trees, so that the place might become a permanent settlement, and the headquarters of the northern portion of the territory. Before the end of the year a log structure was finished, which served for school and meeting house, and soon afterward the settlers commenced to build a wall for protection against the Indians, completing it about three years later at a cost of some $40,000.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="#fn_469"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> So rapid was the growth of the town, that in 1851 it was made a stake of Zion,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_470"></A><A HREF="#fn_470"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> divided into wards, and incorporated by act of legislature.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_471"></A><A HREF="#fn_471"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1848 Isaac Morley and two hundred others settled in the southern part of the valley of the San Pete&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_472"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>&#8212;particulars to be mentioned hereafter.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring of 1849 a stockade was built and log houses erected by the pioneer settlers of Utah county, numbering about thirty families,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_473"></A><A HREF="#fn_473"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> near the Timpanogos or Provo River, and below the point where a small creek issuing from it discharges into Lake Utah.

<p>this settlement was given the name of Fort Utah. Within the space enclosed by the stockade was a mound, the top of which was levelled, and on a platform bulk thereon were mounted several twelve-pounders for the purpose of intimidating the Indians. But the Indians were not to be thus intimidated. In the autumn they began to steal the grain and cattle of the white men, and one of their number being killed while in the act of pilfering, hostilities broke out and the fort was soon in a state of siege.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, ill feeling on the part of the Indians had begun to show itself the previous year. Vasquez and Bridger wrote to Brigham on the 17th of April, 1849, that the Utes were badly disposed toward Americans, and that chiefs Elk and Walker were urging the Utes to attack the settlements in Utah Valley. The brethren were advised to protect themselves, but if the Indians were friendly, to teach them to raise grain, and "order them to quit stealing." Brigham was persuaded that Bridger was his enemy, and expressed the conviction that he and the other mountaineers were responsible for all the Indian trouble, and that he was watching every movement of the Mormons and reporting to Thomas H. Benton at Washington.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_474"></A><A HREF="#fn_474"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> Alexander Williams and D. B. Huntington were empowered by the council to trade exclusively with the Indians on behalf of the community.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 31st of January, 1850, Isaac Higbee, of Fort Utah, reported at Salt Lake that the Indians of Utah Valley had stolen fifty or sixty head of cattle or horses, threatening further depredations, and asked permission to chastise them, which was granted. General Daniel H. Wells then called for volunteers from the militia, and on the 4th of February Captain George D. Grant started with a company for Utah Fort, followed soon after by Major Andrew Lytle.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The Indians were attacked on the 8th, and took refuge in a log house, whence they were dislodged next day, and driven into the thicket along the Provo River. In this encounter Joseph Higbee was killed, and Alexander Williams, Samuel Kearns, Albert Miles, Jabez Nowland, and two men named Orr and Stevens were wounded.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 11th the Indians fled from the thicket to Rock Ca&ntilde;on, whither the volunteers pursued them; but failing to find them, the white men proceeded to the west and south sides of Utah Lake, and shot all they could find there.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the expedition twenty-seven warriors were killed. The women and children threw themselves upon the settlers for protection and support, and were fed and cared for in Salt Lake City until spring. Thus Utah Valley was entirely rid of hostile Indians. Until 1852 there was no further trouble with them of a serious nature;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_475"></A><A HREF="#fn_475"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> and thus ended the first Indian war of Utah, which like all the others was rather a tame affair. It was the mission of the Mormons to convert the Indians, who were their brethren, and not to kill them.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in the year was founded the city of Provo,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> somewhat to the eastward of Fort Utah, near the western base of the Wasatch Mountains, on a site where timber and pasture were abundant,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> and where the gradual fall of the Timpanogos affords excellent water-power. In March 1851 it was organized as a stake of Zion. The settlement was pushed forward with the energy characteristic of the settlers. Before the close of 1850 more than twenty dwellings</p>

<p>had been completed;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> and before the end of 1851 the place began to wear the appearance of a town, among the buildings in course of erection being a touring-mill and two hotels; manufactures were started; all were busy the livelong day at farm or workshop, and in the evening, writes Elder Isaac Higbee, in February 1852, "We have on Monday singing-school, on Tuesday lyceum, on Wednesday seventies' meeting, on Thursday prayer-meeting, on Friday spelling-school, and on Saturday the meeting of the lesser priesthood."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dry Creek, near the head of Lake Utah and about sixteen miles northwest of Provo, a settlement was formed in 1851, named Evansville.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> The neighboring lands were surveyed in lots of forty acres, and to each new settler as he arrived was given a plat of this size until the tract was exhausted. The soil was rich; but here, as elsewhere in the northern part of Utah county, water was scarce. A supply was obtained by diverting a portion of the waters of American Fork creek,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> and thereafter the affairs of the settlement prospered so rapidly that, in February 1852, the place was incorporated under the name of Lehi, or as it is sometimes written, Lehigh.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South-east of Lehi, on a plain about three miles east of Lake Utah, was founded, in 1850, a settlement</p>

<p>first known as Battle Creek, and afterward called Pleasant Grove. It was here that the first engagement with the natives occurred. Captain Scott with a band of thirty or forty men started south in pursuit of Indians who had stolen fourteen horses from Orr's herd, on Wilson Creek, in Utah Valley, and several cattle from Tooele Valley. The band was found encamped on a creek in the midst of willows and dense brushwood in a deep ravine. After a desultory fight of three or four hours, four Indians were killed, but none of the settlers. As was their custom, the women and children of the slain followed the victorious party to their camp.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the neighborhood of Pleasant Grove were good farming land, good range for stock, and water-power, inducements which quickly attracted emigrants, and caused the place to thrive rapidly. In 1853 the present site was laid out,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> and to this spot were transferred, on July 24th of that year, the effects of the community, then numbering seventy-five families.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Lehi and Pleasant Grove the village of American Fork was founded in 1850, on a site where were farming and grazing land of fair quality, a little timber, springs of fresh water, and a stream that could be easily diverted for purposes of irrigatiom.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_484"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About twenty miles south of Provo the settlement of Payson was laid out on the banks of the Peteetneet Creek;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_485"></A><A HREF="#fn_485"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A> a few miles to the north-east of Payson was founded a village named Palmyra, containing, at the close of 1852, fifty families; and in 1851, on Salt Creek,</p>

<p>twenty-five miles to the south, the site of Nephi, in Juab county, was first occupied by Joseph L. Heywood. Nephi was surveyed in the autumn of 1852, the spot being selected on account of its beauty and convenience. A fort was afterward built, surrounded by a wall twelve feet in height and six feet at the base.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> Through this town passed the old California or southern road made by the pioneers in 1849; and here, in cabins built of mud and willows, lived, at the close of 1852, more than forty families.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned that Isaac Morley with two hundred settlers went into the San Pete country in 1848. On the 14th of June, 1849, a council was held at Salt Lake City, at which were present a Ute chief named Walker,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A> and twelve of his tribe. After the pipe of peace had been passed around, Walker declared himself a friend of the settlers, and asked their sachem to send a party southward to the valley of San Pete, where they might teach his people how to build and farm. "Within six moons," answered Brigham, "I will send you a company." In the spring of this year the party sent to explore this valley had already selected the site of the present town of Manti, on a branch of the San Pete Creek, though there was little in the neighborhood to invite the settler, sage brush and rabbit brush, the red man and the coyote, being</p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></A></p>  
<p>the principal features. In November the town was laid out.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A> The name of Manti was suggested by Brigham, who declared that on this spot should be raised one of the cities spoken of in the book of Mormon, and here he built with his own hands an adobe house, which in 1883 was still pointed out to visitors as one of the curiosities of the place.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Chalk Creek, in Pahvan Valley, south-west of Manti and about a hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake City, a site was chosen by Brigham, in October 1851, for the capital of the territory, and named Fillmore, in honor of the president.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A> During 1852 the foundations of the state-house were laid, and many private buildings erected, the settlement numbering about seventy families at the close of the year.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the autumn of 1849, John Rowberry, Cyrus Tolman, and others set forth from Salt Lake City to explore the country west of the Jordan Valley, in search of grazing lands whereon to pasture their stock. Crossing the mountain range which forms the western boundary of Cedar and Jordan valleys,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> they discovered a spot where grass, timber, and water were abundant, and encamped for the winter on the banks of a stream now called Emigrant Ca&ntilde;on creek. Returning in the spring, they made their report to Brigham, who recommended them to form a settlement in that neighborhood. To this the men consented. "By what name will you call it?" asked the</p>

<p>president. Tolman suggested Cedar Valley, a large belt of cedar having been found there; but Brigham recommended Tule, as reeds were plentiful in that neighborhood. And so it was ordered; and this word, spelled Tooele by Thomas Bullock, the president's private secretary, is still applied to the town, the site of which was discovered by Rowberry and his comrades.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the winter of 1849-50, Edward Phillips and John H. Green proceeded northward from Salt Lake City, intending to settle in the neighborhood of Ogden. When within twelve miles of that place, the snow-drifts prevented further progress, and turning aside to Sandy Creek, or as it was later termed, Kay Creek, where the land was covered with bunch-grass, they resolved to take up their abode in that neighborhood. After passing the winter in Salt Lake City, the two men set forth in the spring of 1850, accompanied by William Kay and others, and founded the settlement of Kaysville.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> In September it was organized as a ward, Kay being appointed bishop, with Green and Phillips as councillors.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the winter of 1849-50, it was ordered by the first presidency that Parley P. Pratt, with a company of fifty men, should explore the southern part of the territory in the neighborhood of Little Salt Lake. They found the brethren at Manti well pleased with their location, there being a good stone quarry and an abundance</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></A></p>  
<p>of cedar at hand. At the Sevier River they met Charles Shumway, James Allred, and Elijah Ward; also Walker, the Utah war chief, and his people, many of whom were sick with the measles. They proceeded to explore the country for some distance round. On the 1st of January, 1850, they were on Virgen River, whence they passed up the Santa Clara, and came to "the valley subsequently named Mountain Meadows." One division of the party explored Little Salt Lake. Beaver Creek was pronounced an excellent place for a settlement. In a half-frozen condition they reached Provo the 30th, and next day some of them were in Salt Lake.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of Parley being favorable, a party of about one hundred and seventy persons, well supplied with wagons, implements, live-stock, seeds, and provisions,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A> set forth, in charge of George A. Smith, on the 7th of December, 1850, toward the south; and on Centre Creek, in a valley of the Wasatch Range, about two hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake City, built a fort near the site of the present town of Parowan.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A> Pasture and timber were plentiful, the soil was of good quality, and in the season of 1851 a bountiful harvest was gathered from about one thousand acres of land.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A> The main attraction, however, was the immense deposits of magnetic iron ore found in the neighboring mountains. In May, Brigham and others visited Parowan and addressed the people in the fort. The Indian name Parowan was then recommended and adopted. Brigham</p>

<p>urged the people to buy up the Lamanite children as rapidly as possible, and educate them in the gospel, for though they would fade away, yet a remnant of the seed of Joseph would be saved.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Cedar City&#8212;or, as it was then called, Cedar Fort&#8212;seventeen miles to the south-west of Parowan, a furnace was built in 1852, but at the close of the year stood idle for lack of hands.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> Here, in May 1851, coal had been discovered near what was then known as the Little Muddy, now Coal Creek. In November of that year the site was occupied&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A> by a company from Parowan. The winter was passed amid some privation, mainly from lack of warm clothing; but on the 30th of January a dry-goods pedler making his appearance&#8212;probably the first who had ventured so far south into the land of the Utahs&#8212;the settlers were soon clad in comfort.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A> In October it was resolved to move the settlement to a point farther to the west and south, and before the end of the year a number of iron-workers and farmers arrived from Salt Lake City.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1851 a party under Simeon A. Carter, sent to explore the country north of Ogden, founded a small settlement at Box Elder Creek.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A> The soil was of the</p>

<p>poorest, but near by were a few spots of meadow and farm land, on which, with irrigation, a fair crop could be raised. A number of emigrants, principally Welsh and Scandinavian, joined the party, and two years later a new site was surveyed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> under the direction of Lorenzo Snow. To the town then laid out was afterward given the name of Brigham City.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks later a small settlement was formed about five miles south of this point, and in 1853 was removed to the present site of Willard City.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Red Creek, about twenty miles north of Cedar City, a small settlement was formed in the autumn of 1852, named Paragoonah, the Pi-Ede name for Little Salt Lake.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A> Six miles south of Cedar City, Fort Walker was built, containing at the close of 1851 only nine men capable of bearing arms; and on Ash Creek, nineteen miles farther south, was Fort Harmony, the southernmost point in the valley occupied by white men,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A> and where John D. Lee located a rancho in 1852.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we see that within less than two years after the founding of Salt Lake City, the population there had become larger than could be supported in comfort on the city lots and the lands in their vicinity, and it had been found necessary to form new settlements toward the north and south, the latter part of the territory being preferred, as water, pasture, and land fit for tillage were more abundant. Instead of merely adding suburb to suburb, all clustering around the parent centre, as might have been done by other communities, the church dignitaries, while yet Salt Lake City was but a village, ordered parties of the brethren, some of them still barely rested from their toilsome journey across the plains, to start afresh for remote and unprotected portions of a then unknown country. As new locations were needed, exploring parties were sent forth, and when a site was selected, a small company, usually of volunteers, was placed in charge of an elder and ordered to make ready the proposed settlement. Care was taken that the various crafts should be represented in due proportion, and that the expedition should be well supplied with provisions, implements, and live-stock.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, for instance, at the close of 1850, it had been resolved to form a settlement in the neighborhood of Little Salt Lake, a notice appeared in the <i>Deseret News</i> of November 16th, giving the names of those who had joined the party, and calling for a hundred additional volunteers. They must take with them 30,000 pounds of breadstuffs, 500 bushels of seed wheat, 34 ploughs, 50 horses, 50 beef-cattle, 50 cows, and 25 pairs of holster pistols; each man must be supplied with an axe, spade, shovel, and hoe,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A> a gun and 200 rounds</p>

<p>of ammunition. Among them there should be five carpenters and joiners, a millwright, a surveyor, and two blacksmiths, shoemakers, and masons. Thus equipped and selected, the settlers, with their marvellous energy and thrift, made more progress and suffered less privation in reclaiming the waste lands of their wilderness than did the Spaniards in the garden spots of Mexico and Central America, or the English in the most favored regions near the Atlantic seaboard.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company was organized in March 1851, at the suggestion of Brigham, to go to California and form the nucleus of a settlement in the Cajon Pass, where they should cultivate the olive, grape, sugar-cane, and cotton, gather around them the saints, and select locations on the line of a proposed mail route.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A> The original intention was to have twenty in this company, with Amasa M. Lyman and C. C. Rich in charge. The number, however, reached over five hundred, and Brigham's heart failed him as he met them at starting. "I was sick at the sight of so many of the saints running to California, chiefly after the god of this world, and was unable to address them:"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A></p>

In addition to those mentioned in the text, a number of small settlements had been made in various parts of the territory. Farmington, now the county seat of Davis co., and on the line of the Utah Central railroad, was first settled in 1848 by D. A. Miller and four others. In 1849 it was organized as a ward. Mill Creek, in S. Lake co., was settled in 1848-9 by John Neff and nine others; Alpine City and Springville, in Utah co., in 1850, the former by Isaac Houston with ten others, the latter by A.

The site of Harrisville, a few miles north of Ogden, was occupied in the spring of 1850 by Ivin Stewart, abandoned the same autumn on account of an Indian outbreak, and resettled in 1851 by P. G. Taylor and others&middot; In 1883 Taylor was bishop of this ward. Slaterville, in Weber county, was first settled in the fall of 1850 by Alex. Kelley, who was soon afterward joined by several families; in 1853&#8212;the year of the Walker war&#8212;it was abandoned, the inhabitants taking refuge in Bingham Fort, but was again occupied in 1854. South Weber, in the same county, <a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="green">p. 319</font></A> was located in 1851 by Robt Watts and nine others. Uintah, at the mouth of Weber Ca&ntilde;on, was settled in 1850 by Dan. Smith and a few others. It was first called East Weber, and received its present name on the 4th of March, 1867, at which date the Union Pacific railroad was finished to this point. <i>Sloan's Utah Gazetteer</i>, 1884, passim.

At this date there was, as we shall see later, a monthly mail between S. L. City and Independence, Mo. There was also a mail to Sacramento, leaving that and S. L. City on the 1st of each month, a bi-monthly mail to The Dalles, Or., a weekly mail to the San Pete valley, and a semi-weekly mail to Brownsville.</P>

The object of the establishment of this colony was that the people gathering to Utah from the Islands, and even Europe, might have an outfitting post. In 1853, Keokuk, Iowa, on the Mississippi River, was selected by the western-bound emigrants as a rendezvous and place of outfitting.</P>
