<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_83:2">83:2</A></FONT></span> Women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken; and if they are not found transgressors they shall have fellowship in the church.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_83:3">83:3</A></FONT></span> And if they are not faithful they shall not have fellowship in the church; yet they may remain upon their inheritances according to the laws of the land.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_83:4">83:4</A></FONT></span> All children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_83:6">83:6</A></FONT></span> And the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church; and widows and orphans shall be provided for, as also the poor. Amen. </p>
