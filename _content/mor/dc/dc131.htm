<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_131:2">131:2</A></FONT></span> And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_131:3">131:3</A></FONT></span> And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_131:5">131:5</A></FONT></span> (May 17th, 1843.) The more sure word of prophecy means a man's knowing that he is sealed up unto eternal life, by revelation and the spirit of prophecy, through the power of the Holy Priesthood.</p>
