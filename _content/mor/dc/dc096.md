### 96. Revelation to Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, June 4, 1833. * History of the Church* 1:352-53.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96:1">96:1</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you, here is wisdom, whereby ye may know how to act concerning
this matter, for it is expedient in me that this stake that I have set
for the strength of Zion should be made strong.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96:2">96:2</span></span> Therefore,
let my servant Newel K. Whitney take charge of the place which is named
among you, upon which I design to build mine holy house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96:3">96:3</span></span> And again,
let it be divided into lots, according to wisdom, for the benefit of
those who seek inheritances, as it shall be determined in council among
you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96:4">96:4</span></span> Therefore,
take heed that ye see to this matter, and that portion that is necessary
to benefit mine order, for the purpose of bringing forth my word to the
children of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96:5">96:5</span></span> For behold,
verily I say unto you, this is the most expedient in me, that my word
should go forth unto the children of men, for the purpose of subduing
the hearts of the children of men for your good. Even so. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96:6">96:6</span></span> And again,
verily I say unto you, it is wisdom and expedient in me, that my servant
John Johnson whose offering I have accepted, and whose prayers I have
heard, unto whom I give a promise of eternal life inasmuch as he keepeth
my commandments from henceforth—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96:7">96:7</span></span> For he is a
descendant of Joseph and a partaker of the blessings of the promise made
unto his fathers—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96:8">96:8</span></span> Verily I
say unto you, it is expedient in me that he should become a member of
the order, that he may assist in bringing forth my word unto the
children of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96:9">96:9</span></span> Therefore
ye shall ordain him unto this blessing, and he shall seek diligently to
take away incumbrances that are upon the house named among you, that he
may dwell therein. Even so. Amen.
