### 4. Revelation through Joseph Smith to his father, Joseph Smith, Sr., Harmony, Pennsylvania, February 1829. * History of the Church* 1:28.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4:1">4:1</span></span> Now behold, a
marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4:2">4:2</span></span> Therefore, O
ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all
your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before
God at the last day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4:3">4:3</span></span> Therefore, if
ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4:4">4:4</span></span> For behold
the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in his
sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth
not, but bringeth salvation to his soul;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4:5">4:5</span></span> And faith,
hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify
him for the work.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4:6">4:6</span></span> Remember
faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness,
godliness, charity, humility, diligence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4:7">4:7</span></span> Ask, and ye
shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Amen.
