### 137. A vision given to Joseph Smith in the temple at Kirtland, Ohio, January 21, 1836. * History of the Church* 2:380-81.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137:1">137:1</span></span> The
heavens were opened upon us, and I beheld the celestial kingdom of God,
and the glory thereof, whether in the body or out I cannot tell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137:2">137:2</span></span> I saw the
transcendent beauty of the gate through which the heirs of that kingdom
will enter, which was like unto circling flames of fire;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137:3">137:3</span></span> Also the
blazing throne of God, whereon was seated the Father and the Son.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137:4">137:4</span></span> I saw the
beautiful streets of that kingdom, which had the appearance of being
paved with gold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137:5">137:5</span></span> I saw
Father Adam and Abraham; and my father and my mother; my brother Alvin,
that has long since slept;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137:6">137:6</span></span> And
marveled how it was that he had obtained an inheritance in that kingdom,
seeing that he had departed this life before the Lord had set his hand
to gather Israel the second time, and had not been baptized for the
remission of sins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137:7">137:7</span></span> Thus came
the voice of the Lord unto me, saying: All who have died without a
knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it if they had been
permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137:8">137:8</span></span> Also all
that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who would have
received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137:9">137:9</span></span> For I,
the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the
desire of their hearts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137:10">137:10</span></span> And I
also beheld that all children who die before they arrive at the years of
accountability are saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven.
