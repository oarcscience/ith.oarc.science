### 70. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, November 12, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:235-37.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:1">70:1</span></span> Behold, and
hearken, O ye inhabitants of Zion, and all ye people of my church who
are afar off, and hear the word of the Lord which I give unto my servant
Joseph Smith, Jun., and also unto my servant Martin Harris, and also
unto my servant Oliver Cowdery, and also unto my servant John Whitmer,
and also unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, and also unto my servant William
W. Phelps, by the way of commandment unto them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:2">70:2</span></span> For I give
unto them a commandment; wherefore hearken and hear, for thus saith the
Lord unto them—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:3">70:3</span></span> I, the
Lord, have appointed them, and ordained them to be stewards over the
revelations and commandments which I have given unto them, and which I
shall hereafter give unto them;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:4">70:4</span></span> And an
account of this stewardship will I require of them in the day of
judgment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:5">70:5</span></span> Wherefore,
I have appointed unto them, and this is their business in the church of
God, to manage them and the concerns thereof, yea, the benefits thereof.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:6">70:6</span></span> Wherefore,
a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not give these things
unto the church, neither unto the world;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:7">70:7</span></span>
Nevertheless, inasmuch as they receive more than is needful for their
necessities and their wants, it shall be given into my storehouse;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:8">70:8</span></span> And the
benefits shall be consecrated unto the inhabitants of Zion, and unto
their generations, inasmuch as they become heirs according to the laws
of the kingdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:9">70:9</span></span> Behold,
this is what the Lord requires of every man in his stewardship, even as
I, the Lord, have appointed or shall hereafter appoint unto any man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:10">70:10</span></span> And
behold, none are exempt from this law who belong to the church of the
living God;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:11">70:11</span></span> Yea,
neither the bishop, neither the agent who keepeth the Lord's storehouse,
neither he who is appointed in a stewardship over temporal things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:12">70:12</span></span> He who is
appointed to administer spiritual things, the same is worthy of his
hire, even as those who are appointed to a stewardship to administer in
temporal things;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:13">70:13</span></span> Yea, even
more abundantly, which abundance is multiplied unto them through the
manifestations of the Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:14">70:14</span></span>
Nevertheless, in your temporal things you shall be equal, and this not
grudgingly, otherwise the abundance of the manifestations of the Spirit
shall be withheld.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:15">70:15</span></span> Now, this
commandment I give unto my servants for their benefit while they remain,
for a manifestation of my blessings upon their heads, and for a reward
of their diligence and for their security;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:16">70:16</span></span> For food
and for raiment; for an inheritance; for houses and for lands, in
whatsoever circumstances I, the Lord, shall place them, and
whithersoever I, the Lord, shall send them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:17">70:17</span></span> For they
have been faithful over many things, and have done well inasmuch as they
have not sinned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70:18">70:18</span></span> Behold,
I, the Lord, am merciful and will bless them, and they shall enter into
the joy of these things. Even so. Amen.
