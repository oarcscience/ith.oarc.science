### 59. Revelation through Joseph Smith, in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri, August 7, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:196-201.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:1">59:1</span></span> Behold,
blessed, saith the Lord, are they who have come up unto this land with
an eye single to my glory, according to my commandments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:2">59:2</span></span> For those
that live shall inherit the earth, and those that die shall rest from
all their labors, and their works shall follow them; and they shall
receive a crown in the mansions of my Father, which I have prepared for
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:3">59:3</span></span> Yea,
blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have obeyed
my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of
the earth, and it shall bring forth in its strength.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:4">59:4</span></span> And they
shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and with
commandments not a few, and with revelations in their time—they that are
faithful and diligent before me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:5">59:5</span></span> Wherefore,
I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and
in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:6">59:6</span></span> Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself. Thou shalt not steal; neither commit
adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:7">59:7</span></span> Thou shalt
thank the Lord thy God in all things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:8">59:8</span></span> Thou shalt
offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even that of a
broken heart and a contrite spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:9">59:9</span></span> And that
thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt
go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:10">59:10</span></span> For
verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to
pay thy devotions unto the Most High;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:11">59:11</span></span>
Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days
and at all times;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:12">59:12</span></span> But
remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations
and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy
brethren, and before the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:13">59:13</span></span> And on
this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared
with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other
words, that thy joy may be full.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:14">59:14</span></span> Verily,
this is fasting and prayer, or in other words, rejoicing and prayer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:15">59:15</span></span> And
inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts
and countenances, not with much laughter, for this is sin, but with a
glad heart and a cheerful countenance—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:16">59:16</span></span> Verily I
say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours, the
beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which climbeth
upon the trees and walketh upon the earth;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:17">59:17</span></span> Yea, and
the herb, and the good things which come of the earth, whether for food
or for raiment, or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or for
gardens, or for vineyards;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:18">59:18</span></span> Yea, all
things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the
benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the
heart;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:19">59:19</span></span> Yea, for
food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body
and to enliven the soul.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:20">59:20</span></span> And it
pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this
end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by
extortion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:21">59:21</span></span> And in
nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save
those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his
commandments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:22">59:22</span></span> Behold,
this is according to the law and the prophets; wherefore, trouble me no
more concerning this matter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:23">59:23</span></span> But learn
that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward,
even peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_59:24">59:24</span></span> I, the
Lord, have spoken it, and the Spirit beareth record. Amen.
