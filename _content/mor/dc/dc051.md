### 51. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Thompson, Ohio, May 1831. * History of the Church* 1:173-74.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:1">51:1</span></span> Hearken
unto me, saith the Lord your God, and I will speak unto my servant
Edward Partridge, and give unto him directions; for it must needs be
that he receive directions how to organize this people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:2">51:2</span></span> For it must
needs be that they be organized according to my laws; if otherwise, they
will be cut off.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:3">51:3</span></span> Wherefore,
let my servant Edward Partridge, and those whom he has chosen, in whom I
am well pleased, appoint unto this people their portions, every man
equal according to his family, according to his circumstances and his
wants and needs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:4">51:4</span></span> And let my
servant Edward Partridge, when he shall appoint a man his portion, give
unto him a writing that shall secure unto him his portion, that he shall
hold it, even this right and this inheritance in the church, until he
transgresses and is not accounted worthy by the voice of the church,
according to the laws and covenants of the church, to belong to the
church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:5">51:5</span></span> And if he
shall transgress and is not accounted worthy to belong to the church, he
shall not have power to claim that portion which he has consecrated unto
the bishop for the poor and needy of my church; therefore, he shall not
retain the gift, but shall only have claim on that portion that is
deeded unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:6">51:6</span></span> And thus
all things shall be made sure, according to the laws of the land.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:7">51:7</span></span> And let
that which belongs to this people be appointed unto this people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:8">51:8</span></span> And the
money which is left unto this people—let there be an agent appointed
unto this people, to take the money to provide food and raiment,
according to the wants of this people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:9">51:9</span></span> And let
every man deal honestly, and be alike among this people, and receive
alike, that ye may be one, even as I have commanded you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:10">51:10</span></span> And let
that which belongeth to this people not be taken and given unto that of
another church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:11">51:11</span></span>
Wherefore, if another church would receive money of this church, let
them pay unto this church again according as they shall agree;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:12">51:12</span></span> And this
shall be done through the bishop or the agent, which shall be appointed
by the voice of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:13">51:13</span></span> And
again, let the bishop appoint a storehouse unto this church; and let all
things both in money and in meat, which are more than is needful for the
wants of this people, be kept in the hands of the bishop.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:14">51:14</span></span> And let
him also reserve unto himself for his own wants, and for the wants of
his family, as he shall be employed in doing this business.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:15">51:15</span></span> And thus
I grant unto this people a privilege of organizing themselves according
to my laws.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:16">51:16</span></span> And I
consecrate unto them this land for a little season, until I, the Lord,
shall provide for them otherwise, and command them to go hence;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:17">51:17</span></span> And the
hour and the day is not given unto them, wherefore let them act upon
this land as for years, and this shall turn unto them for their good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:18">51:18</span></span> Behold,
this shall be an example unto my servant Edward Partridge, in other
places, in all churches.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:19">51:19</span></span> And whoso
is found a faithful, a just, and a wise steward shall enter into the joy
of his Lord, and shall inherit eternal life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_51:20">51:20</span></span> Verily, I
say unto you, I am Jesus Christ, who cometh quickly, in an hour you
think not. Even so. Amen.
