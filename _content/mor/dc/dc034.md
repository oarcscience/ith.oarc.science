### 34. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Orson Pratt, Fayette, New York, November 4, 1830. * History of the Church* 1:127-28.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:1">34:1</span></span> My son
Orson, hearken and hear and behold what I, the Lord God, shall say unto
you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:2">34:2</span></span> The light
and the life of the world, a light which shineth in darkness and the
darkness comprehendeth it not;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:3">34:3</span></span> Who so
loved the world that he gave his own life, that as many as would believe
might become the sons of God. Wherefore you are my son;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:4">34:4</span></span> And blessed
are you because you have believed;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:5">34:5</span></span> And more
blessed are you because you are called of me to preach my gospel—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:6">34:6</span></span> To lift up
your voice as with the sound of a trump, both long and loud, and cry
repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way of
the Lord for his second coming.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:7">34:7</span></span> For behold,
verily, verily, I say unto you, the time is soon at hand that I shall
come in a cloud with power and great glory.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:8">34:8</span></span> And it
shall be a great day at the time of my coming, for all nations shall
tremble.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:9">34:9</span></span> But before
that great day shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be
turned into blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some
shall fall, and great destructions await the wicked.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:10">34:10</span></span>
Wherefore, lift up your voice and spare not, for the Lord God hath
spoken; therefore prophesy, and it shall be given by the power of the
Holy Ghost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:11">34:11</span></span> And if
you are faithful, behold, I am with you until I come—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34:12">34:12</span></span> And
verily, verily, I say unto you, I come quickly. I am your Lord and your
Redeemer. Even so. Amen.
