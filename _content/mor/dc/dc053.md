### 53. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Algernon Sidney Gilbert, Kirtland, Ohio, June 1831. * History of the Church* 1:179-80.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_53:1">53:1</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you, my servant Sidney Gilbert, that I have heard your prayers;
and you have called upon me that it should be made known unto you, of
the Lord your God, concerning your calling and election in the church,
which I, the Lord, have raised up in these last days.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_53:2">53:2</span></span> Behold, I,
the Lord, who was crucified for the sins of the world, give unto you a
commandment that you shall forsake the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_53:3">53:3</span></span> Take upon
you mine ordination, even that of an elder, to preach faith and
repentance and remission of sins, according to my word, and the
reception of the Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_53:4">53:4</span></span> And also to
be an agent unto this church in the place which shall be appointed by
the bishop, according to commandments which shall be given hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_53:5">53:5</span></span> And again,
verily I say unto you, you shall take your journey with my servants
Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_53:6">53:6</span></span> Behold,
these are the first ordinances which you shall receive; and the residue
shall be made known in a time to come, according to your labor in my
vineyard.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_53:7">53:7</span></span> And again,
I would that ye should learn that he only is saved who endureth unto the
end. Even so. Amen.
