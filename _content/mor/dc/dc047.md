### 47. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, March 8, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:166.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_47:1">47:1</span></span> Behold, it
is expedient in me that my servant John should write and keep a regular
history, and assist you, my servant Joseph, in transcribing all things
which shall be given you, until he is called to further duties.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_47:2">47:2</span></span> Again,
verily I say unto you that he can also lift up his voice in meetings,
whenever it shall be expedient.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_47:3">47:3</span></span> And again,
I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the church
record and history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to
another office.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_47:4">47:4</span></span> Wherefore,
it shall be given him, inasmuch as he is faithful, by the Comforter, to
write these things. Even so. Amen.
