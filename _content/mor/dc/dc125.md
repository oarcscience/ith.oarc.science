### 125. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Nauvoo, Illinois, March 1841. * History of the Church* 4:311-12.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_125:1">125:1</span></span> What is
the will of the Lord concerning the saints in the Territory of Iowa?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_125:2">125:2</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord, I say unto you, if those who call themselves by my
name and are essaying to be my saints, if they will do my will and keep
my commandments concerning them, let them gather themselves together
unto the places which I shall appoint unto them by my servant Joseph,
and build up cities unto my name, that they may be prepared for that
which is in store for a time to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_125:3">125:3</span></span> Let them
build up a city unto my name upon the land opposite the city of Nauvoo,
and let the name of Zarahemla be named upon it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_125:4">125:4</span></span> And let
all those who come from the east, and the west, and the north, and the
south, that have desires to dwell therein, take up their inheritance in
the same, as well as in the city of Nashville, or in the city of Nauvoo,
and in all the stakes which I have appointed, saith the Lord.
