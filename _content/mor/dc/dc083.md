### 83. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Independence, Missouri, April 30, 1832. * History of the Church* 1:269-70.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_83:1">83:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord, in addition to the laws of the church concerning
women and children, those who belong to the church, who have lost their
husbands or fathers:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_83:2">83:2</span></span> Women have
claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are
taken; and if they are not found transgressors they shall have
fellowship in the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_83:3">83:3</span></span> And if they
are not faithful they shall not have fellowship in the church; yet they
may remain upon their inheritances according to the laws of the land.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_83:4">83:4</span></span> All
children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they
are of age.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_83:5">83:5</span></span> And after
that, they have claim upon the church, or in other words upon the Lord's
storehouse, if their parents have not wherewith to give them
inheritances.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_83:6">83:6</span></span> And the
storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church; and widows
and orphans shall be provided for, as also the poor. Amen.
