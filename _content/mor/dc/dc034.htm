<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:1">34:1</A></FONT></span> My son Orson, hearken and hear and behold what I, the Lord God, shall say unto you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:2">34:2</A></FONT></span> The light and the life of the world, a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:3">34:3</A></FONT></span> Who so loved the world that he gave his own life, that as many as would believe might become the sons of God. Wherefore you are my son;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:4">34:4</A></FONT></span> And blessed are you because you have believed;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:5">34:5</A></FONT></span> And more blessed are you because you are called of me to preach my gospel&#8212;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:6">34:6</A></FONT></span> To lift up your voice as with the sound of a trump, both long and loud, and cry repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way of the Lord for his second coming.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:7">34:7</A></FONT></span> For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, the time is soon at hand that I shall come in a cloud with power and great glory.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:8">34:8</A></FONT></span> And it shall be a great day at the time of my coming, for all nations shall tremble.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:9">34:9</A></FONT></span> But before that great day shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and great destructions await the wicked.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:10">34:10</A></FONT></span> Wherefore, lift up your voice and spare not, for the Lord God hath spoken; therefore prophesy, and it shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A></FONT></span> And if you are faithful, behold, I am with you until I come&#8212;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A></FONT></span> And verily, verily, I say unto you, I come quickly. I am your Lord and your Redeemer. Even so. Amen. </p>
