### 30. Revelation through Joseph Smith to David Whitmer, Peter Whitmer, Jr., and John Whitmer, Fayette, New York, September 1830. * History of the Church* 1:115-16.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:1">30:1</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you, David, that you have feared man and have not relied on me
for strength as you ought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:2">30:2</span></span> But your
mind has been on the things of the earth more than on the things of me,
your Maker, and the ministry whereunto you have been called; and you
have not given heed unto my Spirit, and to those who were set over you,
but have been persuaded by those whom I have not commanded.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:3">30:3</span></span> Wherefore,
you are left to inquire for yourself at my hand, and ponder upon the
things which you have received.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:4">30:4</span></span> And your
home shall be at your father's house, until I give unto you further
commandments. And you shall attend to the ministry in the church, and
before the world, and in the regions round about. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:5">30:5</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you, Peter, that you shall take your journey with your brother
Oliver; for the time has come that it is expedient in me that you shall
open your mouth to declare my gospel; therefore, fear not, but give heed
unto the words and advice of your brother, which he shall give you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:6">30:6</span></span> And be you
afflicted in all his afflictions, ever lifting up your heart unto me in
prayer and faith, for his and your deliverance; for I have given unto
him power to build up my church among the Lamanites;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:7">30:7</span></span> And none
have I appointed to be his counselor over him in the church, concerning
church matters, except it is his brother, Joseph Smith, Jun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:8">30:8</span></span> Wherefore,
give heed unto these things and be diligent in keeping my commandments,
and you shall be blessed unto eternal life. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:9">30:9</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you, my servant John, that thou shalt commence from this time
forth to proclaim my gospel, as with the voice of a trump.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:10">30:10</span></span> And your
labor shall be at your brother Philip Burroughs', and in that region
round about, yea, wherever you can be heard, until I command you to go
from hence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30:11">30:11</span></span> And your
whole labor shall be in Zion, with all your soul, from henceforth; yea,
you shall ever open your mouth in my cause, not fearing what man can do,
for I am with you. Amen.
