### 7. Revelation to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. * History of the Church* 1:35-36.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7:1">7:1</span></span> And the Lord
said unto me: John, my beloved, what desirest thou? For if you shall ask
what you will, it shall be granted unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7:2">7:2</span></span> And I said
unto him: Lord, give unto me power over death, that I may live and bring
souls unto thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7:3">7:3</span></span> And the Lord
said unto me: Verily, verily, I say unto thee, because thou desirest
this thou shalt tarry until I come in my glory, and shalt prophesy
before nations, kindreds, tongues and people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7:4">7:4</span></span> And for this
cause the Lord said unto Peter: If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee? For he desired of me that he might bring souls
unto me, but thou desiredst that thou mightest speedily come unto me in
my kingdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7:5">7:5</span></span> I say unto
thee, Peter, this was a good desire; but my beloved has desired that he
might do more, or a greater work yet among men than what he has before
done.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7:6">7:6</span></span> Yea, he has
undertaken a greater work; therefore I will make him as flaming fire and
a ministering angel; he shall minister for those who shall be heirs of
salvation who dwell on the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7:7">7:7</span></span> And I will
make thee to minister for him and for thy brother James; and unto you
three I will give this power and the keys of this ministry until I come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7:8">7:8</span></span> Verily I say
unto you, ye shall both have according to your desires, for ye both joy
in that which ye have desired.
