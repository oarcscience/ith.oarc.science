<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:1">75:1</A></FONT></span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, I who speak even by the voice of my Spirit, even Alpha and Omega, your Lord and your God&#8212;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:2">75:2</A></FONT></span> Hearken, O ye who have given your names to go forth to proclaim my gospel, and to prune my vineyard.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:3">75:3</A></FONT></span> Behold, I say unto you that it is my will that you should go forth and not tarry, neither be idle but labor with your might&#8212;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:4">75:4</A></FONT></span> Lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, proclaiming the truth according to the revelations and commandments which I have given you.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:5">75:5</A></FONT></span> And thus, if ye are faithful ye shall be laden with many sheaves, and crowned with honor, and glory, and immortality, and eternal life.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:6">75:6</A></FONT></span> Therefore, verily I say unto my servant William E. McLellin, I revoke the commission which I gave unto him to go unto the eastern countries;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:7">75:7</A></FONT></span> And I give unto him a new commission and a new commandment, in the which I, the Lord, chasten him for the murmurings of his heart;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:8">75:8</A></FONT></span> And he sinned; nevertheless, I forgive him and say unto him again, Go ye into the south countries.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:9">75:9</A></FONT></span> And let my servant Luke Johnson go with him, and proclaim the things which I have commanded them&#8212;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:10">75:10</A></FONT></span> Calling on the name of the Lord for the Comforter, which shall teach them all things that are expedient for them&#8212;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:11">75:11</A></FONT></span> Praying always that they faint not; and inasmuch as they do this, I will be with them even unto the end.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:12">75:12</A></FONT></span> Behold, this is the will of the Lord your God concerning you. Even so. Amen.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:13">75:13</A></FONT></span> And again, verily thus saith the Lord, let my servant Orson Hyde and my servant Samuel H. Smith take their journey into the eastern countries, and proclaim the things which I have commanded them; and inasmuch as they are faithful, lo, I will be with them even unto the end.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:14">75:14</A></FONT></span> And again, verily I say unto my servant Lyman Johnson, and unto my servant Orson Pratt, they shall also take their journey into the eastern countries; and behold, and lo, I am with them also, even unto the end.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:15">75:15</A></FONT></span> And again, I say unto my servant Asa Dodds, and unto my servant Calves Wilson, that they also shall take their journey unto the western countries, and proclaim my gospel, even as I have commanded them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:16">75:16</A></FONT></span> And he who is faithful shall overcome all things, and shall be lifted up at the last day.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:17">75:17</A></FONT></span> And again, I say unto my servant Major N. Ashley, and my servant Burr Riggs, let them take their journey also into the south country.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:18">75:18</A></FONT></span> Yea, let all those take their journey, as I have commanded them, going from house to house, and from village to village, and from city to city.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:19">75:19</A></FONT></span> And in whatsoever house ye enter, and they receive you, leave your blessing upon that house.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:20">75:20</A></FONT></span> And in whatsoever house ye enter, and they receive you not, ye shall depart speedily from that house, and shake off the dust of your feet as a testimony against them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:21">75:21</A></FONT></span> And you shall be filled with joy and gladness; and know this, that in the day of judgment you shall be judges of that house, and condemn them;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:22">75:22</A></FONT></span> And it shall be more tolerable for the heathen in the day of judgment, than for that house; therefore, gird up your loins and be faithful, and ye shall overcome all things, and be lifted up at the last day. Even so. Amen.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:23">75:23</A></FONT></span> And again, thus saith the Lord unto you, O ye elders of my church, who have given your names that you might know his will concerning you&#8212;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:24">75:24</A></FONT></span> Behold, I say unto you, that it is the duty of the church to assist in supporting the families of those, and also to support the families of those who are called and must needs be sent unto the world to proclaim the gospel unto the world.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:25">75:25</A></FONT></span> Wherefore, I, the Lord, give unto you this commandment, that ye obtain places for your families, inasmuch as your brethren are willing to open their hearts.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:26">75:26</A></FONT></span> And let all such as can obtain places for their families, and support of the church for them, not fail to go into the world, whether to the east or to the west, or to the north, or to the south.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:27">75:27</A></FONT></span> Let them ask and they shall receive, knock and it shall be opened unto them, and be made known from on high, even by the Comforter, whither they shall go.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:28">75:28</A></FONT></span> And again, verily I say unto you, that every man who is obliged to provide for his own family, let him provide, and he shall in nowise lose his crown; and let him labor in the church.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:29">75:29</A></FONT></span> Let every man be diligent in all things. And the idler shall not have place in the church, except he repent and mend his ways.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:30">75:30</A></FONT></span> Wherefore, let my servant Simeon Carter and my servant Emer Harris be united in the ministry;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:31">75:31</A></FONT></span> And also my servant Ezra Thayre and my servant Thomas B. Marsh;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:32">75:32</A></FONT></span> Also my servant Hyrum Smith and my servant Reynolds Cahoon;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:33">75:33</A></FONT></span> And also my servant Daniel Stanton and my servant Seymour Brunson;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:34">75:34</A></FONT></span> And also my servant Sylvester Smith and my servant Gideon Carter;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:35">75:35</A></FONT></span> And also my servant Ruggles Eames and my servant Stephen Burnett;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75:36">75:36</A></FONT></span> And also my servant Micah B. Welton and also my servant Eden Smith. Even so. Amen. </p>
