### 117. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Far West, Missouri, July 8, 1838. * History of the Church* 3:45-46.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:1">117:1</span></span> Verily
thus saith the Lord unto my servant William Marks, and also unto my
servant Newel K. Whitney, let them settle up their business speedily and
journey from the land of Kirtland, before I, the Lord, send again the
snows upon the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:2">117:2</span></span> Let them
awake, and arise, and come forth, and not tarry, for I, the Lord,
command it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:3">117:3</span></span>
Therefore, if they tarry it shall not be well with them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:4">117:4</span></span> Let them
repent of all their sins, and of all their covetous desires, before me,
saith the Lord; for what is property unto me? saith the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:5">117:5</span></span> Let the
properties of Kirtland be turned out for debts, saith the Lord. Let them
go, saith the Lord, and whatsoever remaineth, let it remain in your
hands, saith the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:6">117:6</span></span> For have
I not the fowls of heaven, and also the fish of the sea, and the beasts
of the mountains? Have I not made the earth? Do I not hold the destinies
of all the armies of the nations of the earth?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:7">117:7</span></span>
Therefore, will I not make solitary places to bud and to blossom, and to
bring forth in abundance? saith the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:8">117:8</span></span> Is there
not room enough on the mountains of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and on the plains
of Olaha Shinehah, or the land where Adam dwelt, that you should covet
that which is but the drop, and neglect the more weighty matters?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:9">117:9</span></span>
Therefore, come up hither unto the land of my people, even Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:10">117:10</span></span> Let my
servant William Marks be faithful over a few things, and he shall be a
ruler over many. Let him preside in the midst of my people in the city
of Far West, and let him be blessed with the blessings of my people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:11">117:11</span></span> Let my
servant Newel K. Whitney be ashamed of the Nicolaitane band and of all
their secret abominations, and of all his littleness of soul before me,
saith the Lord, and come up to the land of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and be a
bishop unto my people, saith the Lord, not in name but in deed, saith
the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:12">117:12</span></span> And
again, I say unto you, I remember my servant Oliver Granger; behold,
verily I say unto him that his name shall be had in sacred remembrance
from generation to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:13">117:13</span></span>
Therefore, let him contend earnestly for the redemption of the First
Presidency of my Church, saith the Lord; and when he falls he shall rise
again, for his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase,
saith the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:14">117:14</span></span>
Therefore, let him come up hither speedily, unto the land of Zion; and
in the due time he shall be made a merchant unto my name, saith the
Lord, for the benefit of my people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:15">117:15</span></span>
Therefore let no man despise my servant Oliver Granger, but let the
blessings of my people be on him forever and ever.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117:16">117:16</span></span> And
again, verily I say unto you, let all my servants in the land of
Kirtland remember the Lord their God, and mine house also, to keep and
preserve it holy, and to overthrow the moneychangers in mine own due
time, saith the Lord. Even so. Amen.
