### 131. Instructions given by Joseph Smith, Ramus, Illinois, May 16 and 17, 1843. * History of the Church* 5:392-93.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131:1">131:1</span></span> In the
celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131:2">131:2</span></span> And in
order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the
priesthood \[meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage\];

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131:3">131:3</span></span> And if he
does not, he cannot obtain it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131:4">131:4</span></span> He may
enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have
an increase.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131:5">131:5</span></span> (May
17th, 1843.) The more sure word of prophecy means a man's knowing that
he is sealed up unto eternal life, by revelation and the spirit of
prophecy, through the power of the Holy Priesthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131:6">131:6</span></span> It is
impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131:7">131:7</span></span> There is
no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more
fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131:8">131:8</span></span> We cannot
see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all
matter.
