<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:1">100:1</A></FONT></span> Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my friends Sidney and Joseph, your families are well; they are in mine hands, and I will do with them as seemeth me good; for in me there is all power.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:2">100:2</A></FONT></span> Therefore, follow me, and listen to the counsel which I shall give unto you.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:3">100:3</A></FONT></span> Behold, and lo, I have much people in this place, in the regions round about; and an effectual door shall be opened in the regions round about in this eastern land.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:4">100:4</A></FONT></span> Therefore, I, the Lord, have suffered you to come unto this place; for thus it was expedient in me for the salvation of souls.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:5">100:5</A></FONT></span> Therefore, verily I say unto you, lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not be confounded before men;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:6">100:6</A></FONT></span> For it shall be given you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:7">100:7</A></FONT></span> But a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall declare whatsoever thing ye declare in my name, in solemnity of heart, in the spirit of meekness, in all things.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:8">100:8</A></FONT></span> And I give unto you this promise, that inasmuch as ye do this the Holy Ghost shall be shed forth in bearing record unto all things whatsoever ye shall say.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:9">100:9</A></FONT></span> And it is expedient in me that you, my servant Sidney, should be a spokesman unto this people; yea, verily, I will ordain you unto this calling, even to be a spokesman unto my servant Joseph.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:10">100:10</A></FONT></span> And I will give unto him power to be mighty in testimony.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:11">100:11</A></FONT></span> And I will give unto thee power to be mighty in expounding all scriptures, that thou mayest be a spokesman unto him, and he shall be a revelator unto thee, that thou mayest know the certainty of all things pertaining to the things of my kingdom on the earth.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:12">100:12</A></FONT></span> Therefore, continue your journey and let your hearts rejoice; for behold, and lo, I am with you even unto the end.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:13">100:13</A></FONT></span> And now I give unto you a word concerning Zion. Zion shall be redeemed, although she is chastened for a little season.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:14">100:14</A></FONT></span> Thy brethren, my servants Orson Hyde and John Gould, are in my hands; and inasmuch as they keep my commandments they shall be saved.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:15">100:15</A></FONT></span> Therefore, let your hearts be comforted; for all things shall work together for good to them that walk uprightly, and to the sanctification of the church.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:16">100:16</A></FONT></span> For I will raise up unto myself a pure people, that will serve me in righteousness;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100:17">100:17</A></FONT></span> And all that call upon the name of the Lord, and keep his commandments, shall be saved. Even so. Amen. </p>
