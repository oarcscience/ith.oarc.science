<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A></FONT></span> And that which I have appointed unto him is that he shall go with my servants, Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun., into the wilderness among the Lamanites.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A></FONT></span> And Ziba Peterson also shall go with them; and I myself will go with them and be in their midst; and I am their advocate with the Father, and nothing shall prevail against them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A></FONT></span> And they shall give heed to that which is written, and pretend to no other revelation; and they shall pray always that I may unfold the same to their understanding.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A></FONT></span> And they shall give heed unto these words and trifle not, and I will bless them. Amen. </p>
