### 86. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, December 6, 1832. * History of the Church* 1:300.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:1">86:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord unto you my servants, concerning the parable of the
wheat and of the tares:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:2">86:2</span></span> Behold,
verily I say, the field was the world, and the apostles were the sowers
of the seed;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:3">86:3</span></span> And after
they have fallen asleep the great persecutor of the church, the
apostate, the whore, even Babylon, that maketh all nations to drink of
her cup, in whose hearts the enemy, even Satan, sitteth to reign—behold
he soweth the tares; wherefore, the tares choke the wheat and drive the
church into the wilderness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:4">86:4</span></span> But behold,
in the last days, even now while the Lord is beginning to bring forth
the word, and the blade is springing up and is yet tender—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:5">86:5</span></span> Behold,
verily I say unto you, the angels are crying unto the Lord day and
night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the
fields;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:6">86:6</span></span> But the
Lord saith unto them, pluck not up the tares while the blade is yet
tender (for verily your faith is weak), lest you destroy the wheat also.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:7">86:7</span></span> Therefore,
let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest is fully
ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and
after the gathering of the wheat, behold and lo, the tares are bound in
bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:8">86:8</span></span> Therefore,
thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued
through the lineage of your fathers—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:9">86:9</span></span> For ye are
lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world
with Christ in God—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:10">86:10</span></span> Therefore
your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain
through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things spoken
by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86:11">86:11</span></span>
Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light unto
the Gentiles, and through this priesthood, a savior unto my people
Israel. The Lord hath said it. Amen.
