<h1 align="center">FOREWORD</h1>
<p align="left">This book is neither a History nor a Topography of the Territory 
of Utah in the early seventies of the last century. The volume is due to the experiences 
of an outsider who tried to be impartial in his views and sympathies. The personal 
note, of course, rings in this record of those past days. No onslaught is made on 
the &quot;wild and woolly&quot; west, nor on the eccentric religion of the majority of the 
people.<br />
<br />
Through much peril and privation, the wild wastes of the Territory had been occupied 
by a people whose hard toil had redeemed the desert. The picture of life presented 
in these pages is in accord with the facts, the only changes made are in the names 
of some of the characters.</p>
