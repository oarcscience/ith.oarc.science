# FOREWORD

This book is neither a History nor a Topography of the Territory of Utah
in the early seventies of the last century. The volume is due to the
experiences of an outsider who tried to be impartial in his views and
sympathies. The personal note, of course, rings in this record of those
past days. No onslaught is made on the "wild and woolly" west, nor on
the eccentric religion of the majority of the people.  
  
Through much peril and privation, the wild wastes of the Territory had
been occupied by a people whose hard toil had redeemed the desert. The
picture of life presented in these pages is in accord with the facts,
the only changes made are in the names of some of the characters.
