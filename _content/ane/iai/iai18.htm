<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">FESTIVAL IN HONOR OF HEABANI, WHO ARRIVES AT ERECH--INTERPRETATION OF THE DREAM</H3>
<P>The sounds of wild rejoicing now arise;<BR>
"Heabani comes!" resound the joyful cries,<BR>
And through the gates of Erech Suburi<BR>
Now file the chieftains, Su-khu-li rubi.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
A festival in honor of their guest<BR>
The Sar proclaims, and Erech gaily drest,<BR>
Her welcome warm extends to the famed seer.<BR>
The maidens, Erech's daughters, now appear,<BR>
With richest kirtles gaily decked with flowers,<BR>
And on his head they rain their rosy showers.<BR>
Rejoicing sing, while harps and cymbals play,<BR>
And laud him to the skies in their sweet way;<BR>
And mingling with their joy, their monarch rode<BR>
Before the seer, who stately after strode<BR>
Beside his beast, and next the men of fame.<BR>
The maids thus chant high honors to his name:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"A prince we make thee, mighty seer!<BR>
Be filled with joy and royal cheer!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All hail to Erech's seer!</P>
<P>Whom day and night our Sar hath sought,<BR>
O banish fear! for Hea taught<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seer, his glory wrought.</P>
<P>He comes! whom Samas loves as gold,<BR>
To Erech grace, our city old;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All wisdom he doth hold.</P>
<P>Great Hea doth to him unfold<BR>
All that remains to man untold;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give him the chain of gold!</P>
<P>He cometh from the Za-Gab-ri<BR>
To our dear Erech Su-bu-ri.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heabani glorify!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<P>Thy dream he will reveal, O Sar!<BR>
Its meaning show to Izdubar,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victorious king of war."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Within the council halls now lead the seers<BR>
With trepidation and with many fears,<BR>
To hear the seer explain their monarch's dream.<BR>
Beside the royal throne he sits supreme<BR>
Among the seers, the Sar, his scribe commands<BR>
To read his dream recorded as it stands<BR>
In Erech's Gi;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who reads it to the seer,<BR>
Who answers thus:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this there doth appear<BR>
A god, whose ardent love will lead to deeds<BR>
Of hate against thee, Sar; thy present needs<BR>
Are great, O king! as fire this love will burn<BR>
Until the wicked seven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> on thee turn;<BR>
And blood, alone, will not their fury sate:<BR>
The gods will hurl upon thee some dread fate."<BR>
In silence, Izdubar the warning heard;<BR>
His blood with terror froze, and then was stirred<BR>
By passions wild, when he recalled the scene<BR>
Of Ishtar's love for him by man unseen;<BR>
When she so wildly then proclaimed her love;<BR>
And now with hate his utmost soul doth move,<BR>
And her bright form to a black dal-khu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> turned<BR>
And furious passions on his features burned.<BR>
And then of the first dream he thought, and light<BR>
Across his vision broke:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis true! aright<BR>
Thy seer hath read! for Ishtar came to me<BR>
In the first dream, her face e'en yet I see!<BR>
Aye, more! her lips to mine again then fell!<BR>
Her arms I felt around me,--breath too well<BR>
I know! of fragrance, while perfume arose<BR>
Around my dream and fled not at the close;<BR>
As frankincense and myrrh it lingered, when<BR>
I woke. Ah yes! the queen will come again!"</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>

<P><A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A></P>
<P>Then to his counsellor who wondering stood,<BR>
Nor heard his murmuring, but saw subdued<BR>
His features were, at first, and then, they grand<BR>
Became with settled hate; he raised his hand;<BR>
"'Tis true!" he said, "Reward oil him bestow!<BR>
Then to the waiting feast we all shall go."</P>
