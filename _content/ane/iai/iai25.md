### HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT OF THE RIVAL GIANTS--DEATH OF KHUMBABA

Now the black forest through, the Sar and seer  
Sought for their foe, Khumbaba, far and near;  
But he had fled when he beheld the gods  
In fury rushing from their bright abodes.  
Now from the battle-field the King and seer  
The farthest limit of the forest near,  
And passing on, the Sar thus to his seer:  
"The gods have filled our foeman's heart with fear:  
He comes not forth to meet us 'neath his walls."  
But lo! within their sight, far from his halls,  
Khumbaba stands beside his steed of snow  
Held by his queen, and eyes his coming foe.  
Heabani cries: "Behold the enemy!  
And with his queen from us disdains to fly!"

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

And Izdubar turned to Heabani, said:  
"My seer, methought this King from us had fled;  
His army slain or scattered from us fly;  
But by our hands this monarch here must die."  
Heabani eyed Khumbaba, nor replied  
Before the Queen, who wrung her hands and cried;  
And Izdubar continued:  
                            "He, of war,  
It seems, doth lack in skill, and from afar  
He scents the battle, while his fighting men  
Their raids oft make, and here return again;  
His castle we may enter without fear,  
And thou his queen mayst have who standeth here,  
And now we end the reign of Elam's throne;  
So lend thy hand to strike this monarch prone.  
My friend, if I mistake thee not, for war  
Thou art prepared, since thou upon the car  
Wast wont to ride in former years now gone;  
And if he falls, a feast day of the Sun  
 <span id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_205)We will appoint, and may the birds
of prey  
Surround his carcass on this glorious day:  
But stay! this giant I will slay alone,  
Although his weight is many *gur-ri* <span
id="fr_208"></span>[2](#fn_206) stone;  
This giant's form the gods have surely made  
An enemy well worthy of my blade."

And Izdubar upon his foe advanced,  
Who waiting stood, and at him fiercely glanced,  
And naught replied; but raised his glory blade.  
Their furious glance, the giant's queen dismayed.  
She wildly eyed the rivals towering high,  
And breathless stood, then quickly turned to fly,  
As Izdubar upon his heavy shield  
Received Khumbaba's stroke, and then doth wield  
His massive blade as lightning o'er his head,  
He strikes the giant's helmet on the mead.  
Khumbaba, furious, strikes a mighty blow,  
Which staggers Izdubar, who on his foe

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

Now springs and rains upon him faster blows,  
Until his blade with fire continuous glows.  
Khumbaba caught his blows on sword and shield  
With parries; thrusts returned, and naught would yield;  
And thus they fought, the peerless kings of war.  
Now Ishtar downward drove his raging car,  
And in Khumbaba's eyes her rays she cast,  
The giant turned his glance--it was his last;  
Unwary caught, his foe has swung his sword,  
Khumbaba's gory head rolls o'er the sward.
