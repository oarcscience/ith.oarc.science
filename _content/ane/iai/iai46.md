### KHASISADRA ON THE SHORE SEES THE VESSEL COMING, AND RETURNING TO HIS PALACE, SENDS HIS DAUGHTER MUA TO WELCOME IZDUBAR--MEETING OF THE KING AND SAGE

Beneath a ku-tree Khasisadra eyes  
The spreading sea beneath the azure skies,  
An agèd youth with features grave, serene,  
Matured with godly wisdom; ne'er was seen  
Such majesty, nor young, nor old,--a seer  
In purpose high. The countenance no fear  
Of death has marred, but on his face sublime  
The perfect soul has left its seal through time.

"Ah, yes! the dream was clear, the vision true,  
I saw him on the ship! Is it in view?  
A speck! Ah, yes! He comes! he comes to me  
My son from Erech comes across the sea!"  
Back to his palace goes the holy seer,  
And Mua <span id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_277) sends, who now the shore
doth near;  
As beautiful as Waters of the Dawn,  
Comes Mua here, as graceful as a fawn.

The King now standing on the glistening sand,  
Beholds the beauteous Mua where she stands,  
With hands outstretched in welcome to the King,  
"O thou sweet spirit, with thy snowy wing,  
Oh, where is Khasisadra in this land?  
I seek the aid of his immortal hand."  
"Great Sar," said Mua, "hadst thou not a seer,  
That thou shouldst come to seek my father here?"

"'Tis true, my daughter dear, a seer had I,  
Whom I have lost,--a dire calamity;  
By his advice and love I undertake  
This journey. But alas! for mine own sake  
He fell by perils on this lengthened way;  
He was not strong, and feared that he should lay\[paragraph continues\]

Himself to rest amid the mountains wild.  
He was a warrior, with him I killed  
Khumbaba, Elam's king who safely dwelt  
Within a forest vast of pines, and dealt  
Destruction o'er the plains. We razed his walls--  
My friend at last before me dying falls.

Alas! why did my seer attempt to slay  
The dragons that we met upon the way,  
He slew his foe, and like a lion died.  
Ah, me! the cause, when I the gods defied,  
And brought upon us all this awful woe;  
In sorrow o'er his death, my life must flow!  
For this I came to find the ancient seer,  
Lead me to him, I pray, if he lives here."

Then Mua leads him through the glorious land  
Of matchless splendor, on the border grand  
Of those wide Happy Fields that spread afar  
O'er beaming hills and vales, where ambient air  
With sweetest zephyrs sweeps a grand estrade,  
Where softest odors from each flowering glade  
Lull every sense aswoon that breathes not bliss  
And harmony with World of Blessedness.  
'Neath trees of luring fruits she leads the way,  
Through paths of flowers where night hath fled away,  
A wilderness of varied crystal flowers,  
Where fragrance rests o'er clustering, shining bowers.  
Each gleaming cup its nectared wine distils,  
For spirit lips each chalice ever fills.

Beyond the groves a lucent palace shone  
In grandest splendor near an inner zone;  
In amethyst and gold divinely rose,  
With glories scintillant the palace glows.  
A dazzling halo crowns its lofty domes,  
And spreading from its summit softly comes  
With grateful rays, and floods the balustrades  
And golden statues 'neath the high arcades;  
A holy palace built by magic hand  
With wondrous architecture, portals grand,\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

And aurine turrets piled to dizzy heights,  
Oh, how its glory Izdubar delights!

Beneath majestic arcades carved, they pass,  
Up golden steps that shine like polished glass,  
Through noble corridors with sculptured walls,  
By lofty columns, archways to the halls  
Of glories, the bright harbinger of fanes  
Of greater splendor of the Heavenly plains.  
Beneath an arch of gems the King espies  
A form immortal, he who death defies.  
Advancing forth the sage his welcome gives,  
"'Tis Izdubar who comes to me and lives!"  
Embracing him he leads him in a room,  
Where many a curious graven tablet, tome,  
And scrolls of quaint and old forgotten lore  
Have slept within for centuries of yore.  
The tablets high are heaped, the alcoves full,  
Where truth at last has found a welcome goal.  
In wisdom's room, the sage his guest has led,  
And seats him till the banquet high is spread;  
Of Izdubar he learns his journeys great,  
How he for aid has left his throne of state.

The maid now comes, him welcomes to the hall  
Of banquets, where are viands liberal,  
And fruits, immortal bread, celestial wines  
Of vintage old; and when the hero dines,  
They lead him to his private chamber room  
That overlooks the wondrous garden's bloom  
Across the plain and jasper sea divine,  
To Heaven's mountains rising sapphirine.  
Four beauteous streams of liquid silver lead  
Across the plain; the shining sea they feed;  
The King reclines upon his couch at rest,  
With dreams of happiness alone is blest.
