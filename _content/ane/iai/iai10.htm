<P>The counsellors assembled round the throne<BR>
Within the council halls of <I>zam-at</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> stone,<BR>
Now greet their monarch, and behold his face<BR>
With trouble written on his brow, and trace<BR>
Uneasiness within that eagle eye,<BR>
While be with stately tread, yet wearily<BR>
Ills throne approached; he turned to the <I>mu-di</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
And swept a glance upon his khas-iz-i.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
Uneasy they all eyed his troubled face,<BR>
For he had ridden at a furious pace.<BR>
The <I>abuli</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> had told them on that morn,<BR>
How he across the plains had wildly torn</P>

<P>To drive away some vision of the night.<BR>
One asked, "Hath our Sardan-nu's dreams been light?<BR>
Or hath dread phantoms o'er thy pillow hung?<BR>
For trouble on thy countenance hath clung."<BR>
The monarch startled at the question eyes<BR>
The councillor, and to him thus replies:<BR>
"'Tis true, my counsellors and wisest men,<BR>
I dreamed a fearful dream Sat mu-si;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> when<BR>
I have disclosed it, if one clear reveals<BR>
Its meaning all and naught from me conceals,<BR>
On him will I the greatest wealth bestow:<BR>
I will ennoble him, and the <I>sib-zu</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A><BR>
A <I>ku-bar-ra</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> for him shall rich prepare;<BR>
As my <I>tur-tan-it</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> he shall be, and seer,<BR>
Decked with a golden chain shall next preside<BR>
At every feast, and break his bread beside<BR>
The King, and highest rank he shall attain<BR>
'Mong counsellors, and mine own favor gain;<BR>
And seven wives to him I will allow,<BR>
And a grand palace. This as King I vow,<BR>
The scribe it shall enroll above my seal<BR>
As Erech's Sar's decree beyond repeal.</P>
<P>I dreamed upon my <I>dum-khi</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> fast asleep,<BR>
The stars from heaven fell from yonder deep<BR>
To earth; and one, with fierceful heat my back<BR>
Did pierce as molten fire, and left its track<BR>
Of flames like some huge ball along my spine;<BR>
And then transformed, it turned its face to mine;<BR>
As some fierce god it glowed before my sight<BR>
Till agony was lost in dread affright.<BR>
I rooted stood, in terror, for its face<BR>
Was horrible; I saw in its feet's place<BR>
A lion's claws. It sprang, my strength it broke,<BR>
And slew me, gloating over me! Awoke,<BR>
I sprang, methought I was a corpse <I>ka-ra</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></P>

<I><P>Va tat-ka mat sar, talka bit-la sha<BR>
Ra-pas-ti sat-ti, ar-id-da! ka-ra,<BR>
Va hal-li-ka! lik-ru-bu ki-mi-ta</I>!<BR>
The seers in silence stand, perplexed and think;<BR>
But from the task at once the wisest shrink.<BR>
The King each face soon read:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye tell me no?"<BR>
And nodding all, concealed from him their woe,<BR>
For they beheld within the dream some fate<BR>
Impending o'er him born of godly hate,<BR>
And durst not to their monarch prate their fears,<BR>
For flatterers of kings are all his seers.<BR>
The King impatient eyed them all with scorn,<BR>
And hid his thoughts by wildest passions born;<BR>
And then at last contemptuous to them said,<BR>
"So all my seers of trouble are afraid?<BR>
Or else in ignorance you turn away;<BR>
'Tis well! I sorely need a seer this day."<BR>
And they now prostrate fall before his throne,<BR>
"Forgive thy seers!" one cries, "O mighty One!<BR>
For we this dreadful dream do fear portends<BR>
Thy harm! a god some message to thee sends!<BR>
We know not what, but fear for thee, our Sar,<BR>
And none but one can augur it; afar<BR>
He lives, Heabani should before the King<BR>
Be brought from <I>Za-Ga-bri</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the <I>na-bu</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> bring!"<BR>
"'Tis well! Prince Zaidu for the hermit send,<BR>
And soon this mystery your Sar will end."<BR>
The King distressed now to the temple goes<BR>
To lay before the mighty gods his woes;<BR>
This prayer recites to drive away bad dreams,<BR>
While Samas' holy altar brightly gleams:<BR>
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>"O Samas! may my prayer bring me sweet rest,<BR>
And may my Lord his favor grant to me:<BR>
Annihilate the things that me invest!</P>

<P>This day, O God! distressed, I cry to thee!<BR>
O goddess! be thou gracious unto me,<BR>
Receive my prayer, my sins forgive I pray:<BR>
My wickedness and will arrayed 'gainst thee.<BR>
Oh, pardon me! O God, be kind this day,<BR>
My groaning may the seven winds destroy,<BR>
Clothe me with deep humility! receive<BR>
My prayers, as wing&egrave;d birds, oh, may they fly<BR>
And fishes carry them, and rivers weave<BR>
Them in the waters on to thee, O God!<BR>
As creeping things of the vast desert, cry<BR>
I unto thee outstretched on Erech's sod;<BR>
And from the river's lowest depths I pray;<BR>
My heart cause thou to shine like polished gold,<BR>
Though food and drink of Nin-a-zu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> this day<BR>
Be mine, while worms and death thy servant fold.<BR>
Oh, from thine altar me support, protect,<BR>
In low humility I pray, forgive!<BR>
Feed me with joy, my dreams with grace direct;<BR>
The dream I dreamed, oh favorable give<BR>
To me its omen filled with happiness!<BR>
May Mak-hir&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, god of dreams, my couch invest!<BR>
With visions of Bit-sag-gal my heart bless,<BR>
The temple of the gods, of Nin, with rest<BR>
Unbroken, and to Merodach I pray!<BR>
The favoring one, to prosper me and mine:<BR>
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>Oh, may thy entering exalted be!<BR>
And thy divinity with glory shine,<BR>
And may our city shine with glowing meads,<BR>
And all my people praise thy glorious deeds."<BR>
Now to Euphrates' banks the Sar and seers<BR>
Their footsteps turn to pray into the ears<BR>
Of Hea,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> where, in white, a hand of priests<BR>
Drawn in a crescent, Izdubar invests.<BR>

The sparkling drops, while all a hymn descant<BR>
To Hea, thus the incantation chant:</P><DIR>

<P>"O chant our incantation to the waters pure,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Euphrates' waters flowing to the sea!<BR>
