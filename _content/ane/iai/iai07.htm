<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">IZDUBAR FALLS IN LOVE WITH ISHTAR, THE QUEEN OF LOVE</H3>
<P>The hour has come when Izdubar will seek<BR>
The cool enchantment of the cove, and slake<BR>
His thirst with its sweet waters bubbling pure,<BR>
Where Love has spread for him her sweetest lure,<BR>
The maids expectant listening, watch and wait<BR>
His coming; oft in ecstacies they prate<BR>
O'er his surprise, and softly sport and splash<BR>
The limpid waves around, that glowing flash<BR>
Like heaps of snowy pearls flung to the light<BR>
By Hea's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> hands, his Zir-ri&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to delight.<BR>
And now upon the rock each maid reclines,<BR>
While Ishtar's form beneath them brightly shines;<BR>
Beside the fountain stands the lovely god,<BR>
The graceful sovereign of Love's sweet abode.</P>
<P>"He comes; the shrubs of yonder jasmine near<BR>
Are rustling, oh, he comes! my Izdubar!"<BR>
And thus her love she greets: "Why art thou here?<BR>
Thou lovely mortal! king art thou, or seer?<BR>
We reck not which, and welcome give to thee;<BR>
Wouldst thou here sport with us within the sea?"<BR>
And then, as if her loveliness forgot,<BR>
She quickly grasped her golden locks and wrought<BR>
Them round her form of symmetry with grace<BR>
That well became a god, while o'er her face<BR>
Of sweetest beauty blushes were o'erspread;<BR>
"Thou see-est only Nature's robe," she said.<BR>
"'Tis all I wish while sporting with my maids,<BR>
And all alone no care have we for jades;<BR>
And if with thee we can in truth confide,<BR>
We here from all the world may cosey hide."<BR>
She hurls a glance toward him, smiling na&iuml;ve,<BR>
Then bounding from the rock, peeps from a wave;<BR>
The waters fondling her surround, embrace<BR>
Her charms; and now emerging with rare grace,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A></P>
<P>She turning says:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Make haste, my hearts!<BR>
Come forth! attend your queen!" and then she parts<BR>
The azure waves, to where, in dumb surprise,<BR>
The King enchanted stands, and fondly eyes<BR>
The Queen divine, while fascinating thrills<BR>
Sweep wildly through his breast; as fragrance fills<BR>
The rose-tree groves, or gardens of the gods,<BR>
Or breezes odorous from the Blest Abodes.<BR>
A longing, rising, fills his inmost soul<BR>
For this sweet queen who offers him a goal<BR>
His stormy life has never known, since he,<BR>
His loved one lost beneath the raging sea;<BR>
And all his calm resolves to seek no more<BR>
A joy which passed and left his heart forlore,<BR>
Are breaking, vanishing beneath her charms,<BR>
Dissolving as the mists, when sunlight warms<BR>
The earth, then scorching drinks the rising dews;<BR>
Till he at last no longer can refuse,<BR>
And love directs while he the goddess greets:<BR>
"Such wondrous beauty here no mortal meets;<BR>
But come, thou Zir-ru,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with me sweetly rest;<BR>
Primroses, gentians, with their charms invest<BR>
My mossy couch, with odorous citron-trees<BR>
And feathery palms above; and I will please<BR>
Thee with a mortal's love thou hast not known;<BR>
In pure love mingling let our spirits run,<BR>
For earthly joys are sweeter than above,<BR>
That rarest gift, the honeyed kiss of love<BR>
On earth, is sweeter bliss than gods enjoy;<BR>
Their shadowy forms with love cannot employ<BR>
Such pleasure as a mortal's sweet caress.<BR>
Come, Zi-ru, and thy spirit I will bless;<BR>
The Mandrake&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> ripened golden, glows around;<BR>
The fruit of Love is fragrant on the ground."</P>
<P>Amid the Dud'im&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> plants he now reclines,<BR>
And to his welcome fate himself resigns;</P>
<P>

<P><A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A></P>
<P>The lovely queen beside him now doth lay,<BR>
And leads his soul along the blissful way<BR>
That comes to every heart that longs for love,<BR>
When purest joy doth bless us from above;<BR>
From her soft liquid eyes the love-light speaks,<BR>
And her warm hands she lays in his, and wakes<BR>
Beneath her touch a thrill of wild desire,<BR>
Until his blood now seems like molten fire.<BR>
Her eyes half closed begat a passion wild,<BR>
With her warm breast, her loves hath beguiled;<BR>
She nearer creeps with hot and balmy breath,<BR>
And trembling form aglow, and to him saith:<BR>
"My lips are burning for a kiss, my love!"<BR>
A prize like this, a heart of stone would move,<BR>
And he his arms around her fondly placed<BR>
Till she reclined upon his breast, embraced,<BR>
Their lips in one long thrilling rapture meet.<BR>
But hark! what are these strains above so sweet<BR>
That float around, above, their love surround?<BR>
An-nu-na-ci&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> from forests, mounts around,<BR>
And from the streams and lakes, and ocean, trees,<BR>
And all that haunt the godly place, to please<BR>
The lovers, softly chant and dance around<BR>
To cymbals, lyres until the rocks resound,<BR>
Of goddess Ishtar chant, and Izdubar,<BR>
The Queen of Love wed to the King of War.<BR>
And he alarmed starts up and springs away,<BR>
And furious cries, to Ishtar's wild dismay:</P>
<P>"What meanest thou, thou wanton brazen thing?<BR>
Wouldst thou on me the direst curses bring?"<BR>
And lo! the goddess is transformed! the crown<BR>
Of her own silver skies shines like the sun,<BR>
And o'er her dazzling robes a halo falls;<BR>
Her stately form with glory him appals,<BR>
For Heaven's dazzling splendor o'er her flows,<BR>
With rays celestial; o'er her brow there glows<BR>
A single star.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have I embraced a god?"<BR>
He horrified now cries; and she doth nod<BR>
Assent.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, oh I wilt thou thy queen forgive?<BR>
I love thee! stay! oh, stay! my heart you grieve!<BR>
He springs beyond the mystic circling ring,<BR>
And from their sight thus glides the angry King.<BR>
Beneath the wood himself he doth disguise<BR>
In tattered garments, on his steed he flies;<BR>
And when he comes in sight of Erech's gate,<BR>
His beggar's mantle throws aside; in state<BR>
Again enrobed, composed his anxious face,<BR>
Through Erech's gates he rides with kingly grace;<BR>
O'er his adventure thus the King reflects:<BR>
"Alas my folly leads, my life directs!<BR>
'Tis true, the goddess hath seductive charms,<BR>
E'en yet I feel her warm embracing arms.<BR>
Enough! her love from me I'll drive away;<BR>
Alas! for me, is this unfruitful day!"</P>
