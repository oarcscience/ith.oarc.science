<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ZAIDU'S RETURN, AND HIS INSTRUCTION TO TAKE TWO MAIDS WITH HIM TO ENTICE THE SEER FROM HIS CAVE</H3>
<P>Prince Zaidu prostrate bows before the Sar,<BR>
Arises, thus narrates to Izdubar:<BR>
"Thy sovereign, Zaidu hath his king obeyed,<BR>
The royal mission I have thus essayed<BR>
As Anu's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> soldier; I undaunted tried<BR>
To urge my mission which the seer denied.<BR>
I firmly met the beast that with him came:<BR>
Unmanly fear, confess I to my shame,<BR>
Came o'er me when I first beheld the beast,<BR>
In vain I plead, and in despair I ceased<BR>
When he refused, and angry from me passed<BR>
Within his cave, where cliffs and rocks are massed;<BR>
I climbed, but the wild entrance did not gain,<BR>
And for advice have I returned again."</P>
<P>"'Tis well, my son," the Sar to Zaidu said,<BR>
"Thy wisdom I commend for thy young head,<BR>
Again upon thy mission thou must go.<BR>
His might, and strength of purpose, thou dost know,<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P><A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></P>
<P>Before a maiden's charms will flee away;<BR>
For he doth love the Zi-Ga-bri&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that play<BR>
Within the mountain gorges. Turn thy face<BR>
Again with manly portance; for I'll grace<BR>
Thine embassy with two of our sweet maids,<BR>
Who oft shall cheer thee through the mountain glades,<BR>
Whom thou shalt lead before Heabani's den<BR>
With their bright charms exposed within the glen.<BR>
Take Sam-kha-tu and sweet Khar-imatu:<BR>
They will entice the seer when he shall view<BR>
Their charms displayed before his wondering eyes.<BR>
With Sam-kha, Joy, the seer you will surprise;<BR>
Khar-im-tu will thy plans successful end,<BR>
To her seductive glance his pride will bend.<BR>
Sweet Sam-kha's charms are known, she is our Joy,<BR>
As Ishtar's aid her charms ne'er cloy;<BR>
Kharun-tu with her perfect face and form,<BR>
The hearts of all our court doth take by storm:<BR>
When joys by our sweet Sam-kha are distilled,<BR>
Kharun-tu's love o'ercomes us till we yield.<BR>
Thus, armed with Love's Seduction and her Joy,<BR>
The greatest powers of earth thou dost employ;<BR>
No flesh can face them but a heart of stone,<BR>
And all the world doth lie before them prone."</P>
<P>Three days Prince Zaidu sat with Kharun-tu<BR>
Before the cave within Heabani's view;<BR>
Beside the pool they waited for the seer:<BR>
From Erech three days' journey brought them here,<BR>
But where hath joy, sweet Sam-kha, roving gone?<BR>
When they arrived at setting of the sun<BR>
She disappeared within with waving arms<BR>
With bright locks flowing she displayed her charms.<BR>
As some sweet <I>zir-ru</I> did young Sam-kha seem,<BR>
A thing of beauty of some mystic dream.</P>
