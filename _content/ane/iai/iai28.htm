<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ISHTAR COMPLAINS TO ANU, KING OF HEAVEN, WHO CREATES A WINGED BULL TO DESTROY ISHTAR</H3>
<P>Before the throne of Arm, Ishtar cries,<BR>
And Anatu, the sovereigns of the skies:<BR>
"O Sar, this king my beauty doth despise,<BR>
My sweetest charms beholds not with his eyes."<BR>
And Anu to his daughter thus replied:<BR>
"My daughter, thou must crush his vaunting pride,<BR>
And he will claim thy beauty and thy charms,<BR>
And gladly lie within thy glorious arms."<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P>"I hate him now, O Sar, as I did love!<BR>
Against the strength of Anu let him prove<BR>
His right divine to rule without our aid,<BR>
Before the strength of Ann let him bleed.<BR>
Upon this giant Sar so filled with pride,<BR>
Let Anu's winged bull&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in fury ride,<BR>
And I will aid the beast to strike him prone,<BR>
Till he in death shall breathe his dying groan."<BR>
And Ann said: "If thou to it shall join<BR>
Thy strength, which all thy noble names define<BR>
Thy glories&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and thy power thus magnified,<BR>
Will humble him, who has thy power defied."<BR>
And Ishtar thus: "By all my might as queen<BR>
Of war and battles, where I proudly reign,<BR>
This Sar my hands shall strike upon the plain,<BR>
And end his strength and all his boastings vain.<BR>
By all the noble names with gods I hold<BR>
As queen of war, this giant monarch bold,<BR>
Who o'er mine ancient city thinks to reign,<BR>
Shall lie for birds of prey upon the plain.<BR>
For answering my love for thee with scorn,<BR>
Proud monarch! from thy throne thou shalt be torn!"</P>
<P>For Ishtar, Anu from the clouds creates<BR>
A shining monster with thick brazen plates<BR>
And horns of adamant;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and now it flies<BR>
Toward the palace, roaring from the skies.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_219"></A><A HREF="iai28.htm#fr_221">84:2</A> "Glories" ("maskhi"). This word is not translated by Mr. Sayce.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_220"></A><A HREF="iai28.htm#fr_222">84:3</A> "Horns of adamant." Sayce translates in l. 22, Col. v., horns of crystal--"thirty manehs of crystal," etc. The caning probably of "zamat stone," as given by Smith, was a hard substance, such as the diamond or adamant. By some translators it has been rendered onyx, and others lazuli.</P>
