<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">COLUMN II</H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">COUNCIL IN THE PALACE</H3>
<P>The seers on silver couches round the throne;<BR>
The hangings of the carv&egrave;d lintel thrown<BR>
Aside; the heralds cried: "The Sar! The Sar!<BR>
The council opens our King Izdubar!"<BR>
The Sar walked o'er the velvets to his throne<BR>
Of gold inlaid with gems. A vassal prone<BR>
Before the Sar now placed the stool of gold,<BR>
Arranged his royal robes with glittering fold<BR>
Of laces, fringes rich inwove with pearls,<BR>
Embroidered with quaint figures, curious twirls.<BR>
Behind the throne a prince of royal blood<BR>
Arrayed in courtly splendor, waiting stood,<BR>
And gently waved a jewelled fan aloft<BR>
Above the Sar's tiara; carpets soft<BR>
From Accad's looms the varied tilings bright,<BR>
In tasteful order, part conceal from sight.</P>
<P>The glittering pillars stand with gold o'erlaid<BR>
In rows throughout the room to the arcade,<BR>
Within the entrance from a columned hall.<BR>
The ivory-graven panels on the wall<BR>
On every side are set in solid gold.<BR>
The canopy chased golden pillars hold<BR>
Above the throne, and emeralds and gems<BR>
Flash from the counsellor's rich diadems.<BR>
In silence all await the monarch's sign:<BR>
"This council hath been called, the hour is thine<BR>
To counsel with thy King upon a plan<BR>
Of conquest of our foes, who ride this plain,<BR>
Unchecked around; these Suti should be driven<BR>
From Sumir's plain. Have ye our wrongs forgiven?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></P>
<P>Khumbaba hath enjoyed great Accad's spoils<BR>
Too long; with him we end these long turmoils.<BR>
What sayest thou, Heabani?--all my seers?<BR>
Hath Accad not her chariots and spears?"</P>
<P>Then one among the wisest seers arose<BR>
"To save our precious tune which hourly flows,<BR>
He should our seer, Rab-sak-i&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> first invite<BR>
To lay his plans before the Sar, and light<BR>
May break across our vision. I confess<BR>
Great obstacles I see, but acquiesce<BR>
In any plan you deem may bring success.<BR>
The gods, I feel our cause will gladly bless."<BR>
Another spoke, and all agree at last<BR>
To hear the seer whose wisdom all surpassed.</P>
<P>Heabani modestly arose and said,<BR>
And gracefully to all inclined his head:<BR>
"O Sar! thy seer will gladly counsel give<BR>
To thee, and all our seers; my thanks receive<BR>
For thy great confidence in my poor skill<BR>
To crush our foes who every country fill.<BR>
I with the Sar agree that we should strike<BR>
A blow against the rival king, who like<BR>
Our Sar, is a great giant king, and lives<BR>
Within a mountain castle, whence he grieves<BR>
All nations by his tyranny, and reigns<BR>
With haughty power from Kharsak to these plains.<BR>
I'll lead the way, my Sar, to his wild home;<BR>
'Tis twenty <I>kas-pu</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> hence, if you will come.<BR>
A wall surrounds his castle in a wood,<BR>
With brazen gates strong fastened. I have stood<BR>
Beneath the lofty pines which dwindle these<BR>
To shrubs that grow in parks as ornate trees.<BR>
The mighty walls will reach six <I>gars</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in height,<BR>
And two in breadth, like Nipur's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to the sight.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></P>
<P>And when you go, take with you many mules;<BR>
With men to bring the spoils, and needed tools<BR>
To break the gates, his castle overthrow:<BR>
To lose no time, to-morrow we should go.<BR>
To Erech, pines and cedars we can bring<BR>
With all the wealth of Elam's giant king,<BR>
And Erech fill with glorious parks and halls,<BR>
Remove these <I>man-u-bani</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> ruined walls.<BR>
Take to your hearts, ye seers, poor Erech's wrongs!<BR>
Her fall, the bards of Elam sing in songs.<BR>
I love dear Erech, may her towers shine!<BR>
He seized his harp, thus sung the seer divine:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"O Erech! thy bright plains I love;<BR>
Although from thee thy seer did rove,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart remained with thee!<BR>
The foe destroyed thy beauteous towers,<BR>
Sa-mu forgot to rain her showers,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And could I happy be?</P>
<P>Mine eyes beheld thy fallen gates,<BR>
Thy blood warm flowing in thy streets,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart was broken then.<BR>
I raised mine eyes and saw thy Sar<BR>
In glory on his steed of war,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And joy returned again!</P>
<P>I saw the foe in wild dismay<BR>
Before him flee that glorious day.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With joy I heard the cry<BR>
Of victory resound afar,<BR>
Saw Elam crushed 'neath Accad's car:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shouted, Victory!</P>
<P>Away! till birds of prey shall rend<BR>
His flesh and haughty Elam bend<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before our mighty Sar!<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P></DIR>

<P><A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A></P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Beneath his forest of pine-trees<BR>
The battle-cry then loudly raise,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We follow Izdubar!</P>
<P>And may the birds of prey surround<BR>
Khumbaba stretched upon the ground,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroy his body there!<BR>
And Izdubar alone be king,<BR>
And all his people joyful sing,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With glory crown him here!</P>
<P>All hail! All hail! our giant King,<BR>
The <I>amaranti</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> for him bring,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To crown him, crown him here,<BR>
As King of Accad and Sutu,<BR>
And all the land of Subar-tu!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sayeth Hea's seer!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The cuunsellors and chieftains wildly cry<BR>
Around the throne, "All hail <I>izzu sar-ri</I><BR>
Of Su-bar-tu!" and shouting leave the halls<BR>
To summon Accad's soldiers from the walls<BR>
To hear the war proclaimed against their foes,<BR>
And Accad's war-cry from them loud arose.<BR>
King Izdubar Heabani warmly prest<BR>
Within his arms upon his throbbing breast,<BR>
And said, "Let us to the war temple go,<BR>
That all the gods their favor may bestow."<BR>
The seer replied, "'Tis well! then let us wend<BR>
Our way, and at the altar we will bend,--<BR>
To Ishtar's temple, where our goddess queen<BR>
Doth reign, seek her propitious favor, then<BR>
In Samas' holy temple pray for aid<BR>
To crush our foe;--with glory on each blade,<BR>
Our hands will carry victory in war."<BR>
The chiefs, without the temple, join their Sar.</P>
