<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">PAPSUKUL, THE GOD OF HOPE, AND HERALD OF THE GODS, FLIES FROM THE EARTH AND INTERCEDES FOR THE RELEASE OF ISHTAR, AND HEA GRANTS HIS PRAYER</H3>
<P>O Hope! thou fleeting pleasure of the mind,<BR>
Forever with us stay, our hearts to bind!<BR>
We cling to thee till life has fled away;<BR>
Our dearest phantom, ever with us stay!<BR>
Without thee, we have naught but dread despair,<BR>
The worst of all our torments with us here;<BR>
Oh, come with thy soft pinions, o'er us shine!<BR>
And we will worship thee, a god divine:<BR>
The <I>ignis fatuus</I> of all our skies<BR>
That grandly leads us, vanishes and dies,<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A></P>
<P>And we are left to grope in darkness here,<BR>
Without a ray of light our lives to cheer.<BR>
Oh, stay! sweet Love's companion, ever stay!<BR>
And let us hope with love upon our way!<BR>
We reck not if a phantom thou hast been,<BR>
And we repent that we have ever seen<BR>
Thy light on earth to lead us far astray;<BR>
Forever stay! or ever keep away!</P>
<P>When Papsukul beheld in man's abodes<BR>
The change that spread o'er blasted, lifeless clods,<BR>
And heard earth's wailing through the waning light,<BR>
With vegetation passing out of sight,<BR>
From the doomed world to Heaven he quickly flies,<BR>
While from the earth are rising fearful cries.<BR>
To Samas' throne he speeds with flowing tears,<BR>
And of the future dark he pours his fears.<BR>
To Sin, the moon-god, Pap-su-kul now cries<BR>
O'er Ishtar's fate, who in black Hades lies;<BR>
O'er Earth's dire end, which with Queen Ishtar dies;<BR>
To Hea he appeals with mournful cries:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"O Hea, our Creator, God and King!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Ishtar now is lying prone.<BR>
To Earth, our godly queen again, oh, bring!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust thy love, O Holy One!<BR>
To all the gods who reign o'er us on high<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray! thus Hope thine aid implores,<BR>
Release our queen! To Hades quickly fly!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy Pap-su-kul with faith adores.</P>
<P>"The bull hath left the lowing kine bereaved,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sulking dies in solitude;<BR>
The ass hath fled away, his mates bath grieved,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And women are no more imbued<BR>
With love, and drive their husbands far away,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wives enjoy not their caress;<BR>
All peace and love have gone from earth this day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And love on earth knows not its bliss.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P><A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A></P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The females die through all the living world,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among all beasts, and men, and plants;<BR>
All love from them on earth have madly hurled,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For blissful love no more each pants;<BR>
And Samas' light is turned away from Earth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And left alone volcanoes' fire;<BR>
The land is filled with pestilence and dearth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All life on earth will soon expire."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>When Hea heard the solemn chant of Hope,<BR>
From his high throne he let his sceptre drop,<BR>
And cried: "And thus, I rule o'er all mankind!<BR>
For this, I gave them life, immortal mind;<BR>
To earth's relief, my herald shall quick go,<BR>
I hear thy prayer, and song of Ishtar's woe."</P>
<P>"Go! At-su-su-namir, with thy bright head!<BR>
With all thy light spring forth! and quickly speed;<BR>
Towards the gates of Hades, turn thy face!<BR>
And quickly fly for me through yonder space.<BR>
Before thy presence may the seven gates<BR>
Of Hades open with their gloomy grates;<BR>
May Allat's face rejoice before thy sight,<BR>
Her rage be soothed, her heart filled with delight;<BR>
But conjure her by all the godly names,<BR>
And fearless be,--towards the roaring streams<BR>
Incline thine ear, and seek the path there spread.<BR>
Release Queen Ishtar! raise her godly head!<BR>
And sprinkle her with water from the stream;<BR>
Her purify! a cup filled to the brim<BR>
Place to her lips that she may drink it all.<BR>
The herald as a meteor doth fall,<BR>
With blazing fire disparts the hanging gloom<BR>
Around the gates of that dark world of doom."</P>
