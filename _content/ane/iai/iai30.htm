<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE CURSE OF ISHTAR, AND REJOICING OF ERECH OVER THE VICTORY</H3>
<P>The monarch and his seer have cleft the head<BR>
From Anu's bull prone lying on the mead.<BR>
They now command to bring it from the plain<BR>
Within the city where they view the slain.<BR>
The heart they brought to Samas' holy shrine,<BR>
Before him laid the offering divine.<BR>
Without the temple's doors the monster lays,<BR>
And Ishtar o'er the towers the bulk surveys;<BR>
She spurns the carcass, cursing thus, she cries:<BR>
"Woe! woe to Izdubar, who me defies!<BR>
My power has overthrown, my champion slain;<BR>
Accurs&egrave;d Sar! most impious of men!"</P>
<P><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></P>
<P>Heabani heard the cursing of the Queen,<BR>
And from the carcass cleft the tail in twain,<BR>
Before her laid it; to the goddess said:<BR>
"And wherefore comest thou with naught to dread?<BR>
Since I with Izdubar have conquered thee,<BR>
Thou hearest me! Before thee also see<BR>
Thine armored champion's scales! thy beast is dead,"<BR>
And Ishtar from his presence furious fled,<BR>
And to her maids the goddess loudly calls<BR>
Joy and Seduction from the palace halls;<BR>
And o'er her champion's death she mourning cries,<BR>
And flying with her maids, sped to the skies.</P>
<P>King Izdubar his summons sends afar<BR>
To view the monster slain by Erech's Sar.<BR>
The young and old the carcass far surround,<BR>
And view its mighty bulk upon the ground.<BR>
The young men eye its horns with wild delight,<BR>
And weigh -them on the public scales in sight<BR>
Of Erech. "Thirty <I>manehs</I> weighs!" they cry;<BR>
"Of purest <I>zamat</I> stone, seems to the eye<BR>
In substance, with extremities defaced."<BR>
Six <I>gurri</I> weighed the monster's bulk undressed.<BR>
As food for Lugul-turda, their Sar's god,<BR>
The beast is severed, placed upon the wood.<BR>
Piled high upon the altar o'er the fires.<BR>
Then to Euphrates' waters each retires<BR>
To cleanse themselves for Erech's grand parade,<BR>
As Izdubar by proclamation bade.<BR>
Upon their steeds of war with Izdubar<BR>
The chiefs and warriors extend afar<BR>
With chariots, and waving banners, spears,<BR>
And Erech rings with their triumphant cheers.<BR>
Before the chariot of their great ar,<BR>
Who with his seer rides in his brazen car,<BR>
The seers a proclamation loud proclaim<BR>
And cheer their Sar and seer; and laud the name<BR>
Of their great monarch, chanting thus his praise,<BR>
While Erech's band their liveliest marches play:</P>
<P><A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A></P>
<P>"If anyone to glory can lay claim<BR>
Among all chiefs and warriors of fame,<BR>
We Izdubar above them all proclaim<BR>
Our Izzu-Ul-bar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of undying fame.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Sar gabri la isu</I>,<BR>

<P>He wears the diadem of Subartu,<BR>
From Bar-ili&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> he came to Eridu;<BR>
Our giant monarch, who of all <I>barri</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><BR>
Can rival him, our Nin-arad <I>rabi</I>?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><BR>

<P>Through the grand halls of Erech far resounds<BR>
The feast their Sar proclaimed through all the grounds<BR>
Of Erech's palaces; where he now meets<BR>
His heroes, seers and counsellors, and greets<BR>
Them in his crowded festal halls.<BR>
Grand banquets far are spread within the walls,<BR>
And sparkling rarest wines each freely drank,<BR>
And revels ruled the hour till Samas sank,<BR>
And shadows sweep across the joyous plain,<BR>
And Samas sleeps with Hea 'neath the main.<BR>
The jewelled lamps are lit within the halls,<BR>
And dazzling glory on the feasters falls.<BR>
The rays o'er gems and richest garments shone<BR>
Upon the lords and ladies round the throne;<BR>
While troops of dancing girls around them move<BR>
With <A HREF="errata.htm#0">cymbals</A>, harps and lutes, with songs of love.<BR>
Again the board glows with rich food and wines,<BR>
Now spread before them till each man reclines<BR>
Upon his couch at rest in the far night,<BR>
And swimming halls and wines pass from their sight.</P>
