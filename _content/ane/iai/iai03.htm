<P>O Moon-god,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> hear my cry! With thy pure light<BR>
Oh, take my spirit through that awful night<BR>
That hovers o'er the long-forgotten years,<BR>
To sing Accadia's songs and weep her tears!<BR>
'Twas thus I prayed, when lo! my spirit rose<BR>
On fleecy clouds, enwrapt in soft repose;<BR>
And I beheld beneath me nations glide<BR>
In swift succession by, in all their pride:<BR>
The earth was filled with cities of mankind,<BR>
And empires fell beneath a summer wind.<BR>
The soil and clay walked forth upon the plains<BR>
In forms of life, and every atom gains<BR>
A place in man or breathes in animals;<BR>
And flesh and blood and bones become the walls</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A></P>
<P>Of palaces and cities, which soon fall<BR>
To unknown dust beneath some ancient wall.<BR>
All this I saw while guided by the stroke<BR>
Of unseen pinions:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then amid the smoke<BR>
That rose o'er burning cities, I beheld<BR>
White Khar-sak-kur-ra's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> brow arise that held<BR>
The secrets of the gods--that felt the prore<BR>
Of Khasisadra's ark; I heard the roar<BR>
Of battling elements, and saw the waves<BR>
That tossed above mankind's commingled graves.<BR>
The mighty mountain as some sentinel<BR>
Stood on the plains alone; and o'er it fell<BR>
A halo, bright, divine; its summit crowned<BR>
With sunbeams, shining on the earth around<BR>
And o'er the wide expanse of plains;--below<BR>
Lay Khar-sak-kal-ama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with light aglow,<BR>
And nestling far away within my view<BR>
Stood Erech, Nipur, Marad, Eridu,<BR>
And Babylon, the tower-city old,<BR>
In her own splendor shone like burnished gold.<BR>
And lo! grand Erech in her glorious days<BR>
Lies at my feet. I see a wondrous maze<BR>
Of vistas, groups, and clustering columns round,<BR>
Within, without the palace;--from the ground<BR>
Of outer staircases, massive, grand,<BR>
Stretch to the portals where the pillars stand.<BR>
A thousand carv&egrave;d columns reaching high<BR>
To silver rafters in an azure sky,<BR>
And palaces and temples round it rise<BR>
With lofty turrets glowing to the skies,<BR>
And massive walls far spreading o'er the plains,<BR>
Here live and move Accadia's courtly trains,<BR>
And see! the <I>pit-u-dal-ti</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> at the gates,<BR>
And <I>masari</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> patrol and guard the streets!</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A></P>
<P>And yonder comes a <I>kis-ib</I>, nobleman,<BR>
With a young prince; and see! a caravan<BR>
Winds through the gates! With men the streets are filled!<BR>
And chariots, a people wise and skilled<BR>
In things terrestrial, what science, art,<BR>
Here reign! With laden ships from every mart<BR>
The docks are filled, and foreign fabrics bring<BR>
From peoples, lands, where many an empire, king,<BR>
Have lived and passed away, and naught have left<BR>
In. history or song. Dread Time hath cleft<BR>
Us far apart; their kings and kingdoms, priests<BR>
And bards are gone, and o'er them sweep the mists<BR>
Of darkness backward spreading through all time,<BR>
Their records swept away in every clime.<BR>
Those alabaster stairs let us ascend,<BR>
And through this lofty portal we will wend.<BR>
See! richest Sumir rugs amassed, subdue<BR>
The til&egrave;d pavement with its varied hue,<BR>
Upon the turquoise ceiling sprinkled stars<BR>
Of gold and silver crescents in bright pairs!<BR>
And gold-fringed scarlet curtains grace each door,<BR>
And from the inlaid columns reach the floor:<BR>
From golden rods extending round the halls,<BR>
Bright silken hangings drape the sculptured walls.</P>
<P>But part those scarlet hangings at the door<BR>
Of yon grand chamber! tread the antique floor!<BR>
Behold the sovereign on her throne of bronze,<BR>
While crouching at her feet a lion fawns;<BR>
The glittering court with gold and gems ablaze<BR>
With ancient splendor of the glorious days<BR>
Of Accad's sovereignty. Behold the ring<BR>
Of dancing beauties circling while they sing<BR>
With amorous forms in moving melody,<BR>
The measure keep to music's harmony.<BR>
Hear! how the music swells from silver lute<BR>
And golden-string&egrave;d lyres and softest flute<BR>
And harps and tinkling cymbals, measured drums,<BR>
While a soft echo from the chamber comes.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A></P>
<P>But see! the sovereign lifts her jewelled hand,<BR>
The music ceases at the Queen's command;<BR>
And lo! two chiefs in warrior's array,<BR>
With golden helmets plumed with colors gay,<BR>
And golden shields, and silver coats of mail,<BR>
Obeisance make to her with faces pale,<BR>
Prostrate themselves before their sovereign's throne;<BR>
In silence brief remain with faces prone,<BR>
Till Ellat-gula&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> speaks: "My chiefs, arise!<BR>
What word have ye for me? what new surprise?<BR>
Tur-tau-u,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> rising, says, "O Dannat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> Queen!<BR>
Thine enemy, Khum-baba&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> with Rim-siu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A><BR>
With clanging shields, appears upon the hills,<BR>
And Elam's host the land of Sumir fills."<BR>
"Away, ye chiefs! sound loud the <I>nappa-khu</I>!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Send to their post each warrior bar-ru!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The gray embattlements rose in the light<BR>
That lingered yet from Samas'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> rays, ere Night<BR>
Her sable folds had spread across the sky.<BR>
Thus Erech stood, where in her infancy<BR>
The huts of wandering Accads had been built<BR>
Of soil, and rudely roofed by woolly pelt<BR>
O'erlaid upon the shepherd's worn-out staves,<BR>
And yonder lay their fathers' unmarked graves.<BR>
Their chieftains in those early days oft meet<BR>
Upon the mountains where they Samas greet,<BR>
With their rude sacrifice upon a tree<BR>
High-raised that their sun-god may shilling see<BR>
Their offering divine; invoking pray<BR>
For aid, protection, blessing through the day.</P>

<P>Beneath these walls and palaces abode<BR>
The spirit of their country--each man trod<BR>
As if his soul to Erech's weal belonged,<BR>
And heeded not the enemy which thronged<BR>
Before the gates, that now were closed with bars<BR>
Of bronze thrice fastened.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the thousand cars<BR>
And chariots arrayed across the plains!<BR>
The marching hosts of Elam's arm&egrave;d trains,<BR>
The archers, slingers in advance amassed,<BR>
With black battalions in the centre placed,<BR>
With chariots before them drawn in line,<BR>
Bedecked with brightest trappings iridine.,<BR>
While gorgeous plumes of Elam's horses nod<BR>
Beneath the awful sign of Elam's god.<BR>
On either side the mounted spearsmen far<BR>
Extend; and all the enginery of war<BR>
Are brought around the walls with fiercest shouts,<BR>
And from behind their shields each archer shoots.</P>
<P>Thus Erech is besieged by her dread foes,<BR>
And she at last must feel Accadia's woes,<BR>
And feed the vanity of conquerors,<BR>
Who boast o'er victories in all their wars.<BR>
Great Subartu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> has fallen by Sutu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><BR>

Thus Khar-sak-kal-a-ma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> all Eridu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A><BR>
O'erran with Larsa's allies; Subartu<BR>
With Duran&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> thus was conquered by these sons<BR>
Of mighty Shem and strewn was Accad's bones<BR>
Throughout her plains, and mountains, valleys fair,<BR>
Unburied lay in many a wolf's lair.<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P>Oh, where is Accad's chieftain Izdubar,<BR>
Her mightiest unrivalled prince of war?</P>
<P>The turrets on the battlemented walls<BR>
Swarm with skilled bowmen, archers--from them falls<BR>
A cloud of wing&egrave;d missiles on their foes,<BR>
Who swift reply with shouts and twanging bows;<BR>
And now amidst the raining death appears<BR>
The scaling ladder, lined with glistening spears,<BR>
But see! the ponderous catapults now crush<BR>
The ladder, spearsmen, with their mighty rush<BR>
Of rocks and beams, nor in their fury slacked<BR>
As if a toppling wall came down intact<BR>
Upon the maddened mass of men below.<BR>
But other ladders rise, and up them flow<BR>
The tides of arm&egrave;d spearsmen with their shields;<BR>
From others bowmen shoot, and each man wields,<BR>
A weapon, never yielding to his foe,<BR>
For death alone he aims with furious blow.<BR>
At last upon the wall two soldiers spring,<BR>
A score of spears their corses backward fling.<BR>
But others take their place, and man to man,<BR>
And spear to spear, and sword to sword, till ran<BR>
The walls with slippery gore; but Erech's men<BR>
Are brave and hurl them from their walls again.<BR>
And now the battering-rams with swinging power<BR>
Commence their thunders, shaking every tower;<BR>
And miners work beneath the crumbling walls,<BR>
Alas! before her foemen Erech falls.<BR>
Vain are suspended chains against the blows<BR>
Of dire assaulting engines.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho! there goes<BR>
The eastern wall with Erech's strongest tower!<BR>
And through the breach her furious foemen pour:<BR>
A wall of steel withstands the onset fierce,<BR>
But thronging Elam's spears the lines soon pierce,<BR>
A band of chosen men there fight to die,<BR>
Before their enemies disdain to fly;<BR>
The masari&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> within the breach thus died,<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A></P>
<P>And with their dying shout the foe defied.<BR>
The foes swarm through the breach and o'er the walls,<BR>
And Erech in extremity loud calls<BR>
Upon the gods for aid, but prays for naught,<BR>
While Elam's soldiers, to a frenzy wrought,<BR>
Pursue and slay, and sack the city old<BR>
With fiendish shouts for blood and yellow gold.<BR>
Each man that falls the foe decapitates,<BR>
And bears the reeking death to Erech's gates.<BR>
The gates are hidden 'neath the pile of heads<BR>
That climbs above the walls, and outward spreads<BR>
A heap of ghastly plunder bathed in blood.<BR>
Beside them calm scribes of the victors stood,<BR>
And careful note the butcher's name, and check<BR>
The list; and for each head a price they make.<BR>
Thus pitiless the sword of Elam gleams<BR>
And the best blood of Erech flows in streams.<BR>
From Erech's walls some fugitives escape,<BR>
And others in Euphrates wildly leap,<BR>
And hide beneath its rushes on the bank<BR>
And many 'neath the yellow waters sank.</P>
<P>The harper of the Queen, an ag&egrave;d man,<BR>
Stands lone upon the bank, while he doth scan<BR>
The horizon with anxious, careworn face,<BR>
Lest ears profane of Elam's hated race<BR>
Should hear his strains of mournful melody:<BR>
Now leaning on his harp in memory<BR>
Enwrapt, while fitful breezes lift his locks<BR>
Of snow, he sadly kneels upon the rocks<BR>
And sighing deeply clasps his hands in woe,<BR>
While the dread past before his mind doth flow.<BR>
A score and eight of years have slowly passed<BR>
Since Rim-a-gu, with Elam's host amassed,<BR>
Kardunia's ancient capital had stormed.<BR>
The glorious walls and turrets are transformed<BR>
To a vast heap of ruins, weird, forlorn,<BR>
And Elam's spears gleam through the coming morn.<BR>
From the sad sight his eyes he turns away,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A></P>
<P>His soul breathes through his harp while he doth play<BR>
With bended head his ag&egrave;d hands thus woke<BR>
The woes of Erech with a measured stroke:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>O Erech! dear Erech, my beautiful home,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Accadia's pride, O bright land of the bard,<BR>
Come back to my vision, dear Erech, oh, come!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair land of my birth, how thy beauty is marred!<BR>
The horsemen of Elam, her spearsmen and bows,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy treasures have ravished, thy towers thrown down,<BR>
And Accad is fallen, trod down by her foes.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, where are thy temples of ancient renown?</P>
<P>Gone are her brave heroes beneath the red tide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone are her white vessels that rode o'er the main,<BR>
No more on the river her pennon shall ride,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gargan-na is fallen, her people are slain.<BR>
Wild asses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> shall gallop across thy grand floors,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wild bulls shall paw them and hurl the dust high<BR>
Upon the wild cattle that flee through her doors,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And doves shall continue her mournful slave's cry.</P>
<P>Oh, where are the gods of our Erech so proud,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As flies they are swarming away from her halls,<BR>
The Sedu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of Erech are gone as a cloud,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As wild fowl are flying away from her walls.<BR>
Three years did she suffer, besieged by her foes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gates were thrown down and defiled by the feet<BR>
Who brought to poor Erech her tears and her woes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain to our Ishtar with prayers we entreat.</P>
<P>To Ishtar bowed down doth our Bel thus reply,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, Ishtar, my queenly one, hide all thy tears,<BR>
Our hero, Tar-u-man-i izzu Sar-ri,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><BR>

Deliverer of peoples, whose heart is aright,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Protector of temples, shall lead his brave bands.</P>
<P>Awake then, brave Accad, to welcome the day!<BR>
