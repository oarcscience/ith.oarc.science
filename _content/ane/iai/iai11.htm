<P>Before a cave within the Gab-ri&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> wild,<BR>
A seer is resting on a rock; exiled<BR>
By his own will from all the haunts of men,<BR>
Beside a pool, within a rocky glen<BR>
He sits; a turban rests upon his brow,<BR>
And meets the lengthened beard of whitest snow.<BR>
This morn an omen comes before his eyes,<BR>
And him disturbs with a wild eagle's cries<BR>
That fierce attacks a fox before his cave;<BR>
For he of beasts is the most cunning knave;</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A></P>
<P>In wait upon the ground the fox hath lain<BR>
To lure the bird, which flying deems him slain.<BR>
He fiercely seizes it, as swooping down,<BR>
The bird with its sly quarry would have flown;<BR>
But the <I>a-si</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> quick seized it by the throat,<BR>
While the wide wings with frantic fury smote<BR>
The beast, and the sharp talons deeply tore<BR>
Its foe--both greedy for the other's gore.</P>
<P>And lo! a voice from yonder sky resounds;<BR>
Heabani to his feet now quickly bounds,<BR>
And bowing, listens to the voice that comes<BR>
In gentleness; upon the winds it roams<BR>
From yon blue heights like sighing of the trees;<BR>
The seer in reverence upon his knees<BR>
Now holy bares his head in Samas' rays,<BR>
While the soft voice to him thus gently says:<BR>
"A messenger, Heabani, soon shall come<BR>
With offers rich, to leave thy lonely home.<BR>
This eagle sought its food and found a snare,<BR>
The messenger will come from Izdubar,<BR>
To learn from thee the meaning of his dream<BR>
Which goddess Ishtar sent,--a snare for him.<BR>
Then to the messenger prove not a snare,<BR>
As yonder <I>a-si</I> doth the eagle tear."</P>
<P>The seer in fury tore his beard of snow<BR>
And cried--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas! my days shall end in woe<BR>
Within these wilds my happiness is mine,<BR>
No other joys I seek, my god divine;<BR>
I would upon these rocks lie down to die,<BR>
Upon my back here sleep eternally."<BR>
And Samas urging, to him thus replied:<BR>
"Heabani, hast thou not some manly pride?<BR>
And thinkest thou no joy thou here wilt lose?<BR>
The lovely Sam-kha-tu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the seer may choose.<BR>
Arrayed in trappings of divinity<BR>
And the insignia of royalty,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A></P>
<P>Heabani then in Erech shall be great,<BR>
And live in happiness and royal state;<BR>
And Izdubar shall hearken, and incline<BR>
His heart in warmest friendship, and recline<BR>
With thee upon a couch of luxury,<BR>
And seat thee on a throne of royalty,<BR>
On his left hand, a crown shall grace thy brow.<BR>
Kings of the earth shall to thee subject bow<BR>
And kiss thy feet, and Izdubar shall give<BR>
Thee wealth, and thou in luxury shalt live.<BR>
In silence Erech's men shall bow to thee,<BR>
In royal raiment thou shalt happy be."<BR>
Heabani listened to the words that came<BR>
From Samas, and his brow was lit with shame<BR>
To hear the god of war urge him to go<BR>
To earthly happiness--mayhap to woe;<BR>
But he within his cave now listless turns<BR>
When Samas ceased; then to his rock returns,<BR>
And seats himself with calmness on his brow;<BR>
His thoughts in happy memories now flow,<BR>
And he recalls the blissful days of yore<BR>
When he as seer lived on Euphrates' shore,<BR>
As the queen's bard oft tuned a festive lay,<BR>
While soft-eyed maidens dance and cymbals play.</P>
