<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE GRIEF OF THE KING OVER THE LOSS OF HIS SEER, AND HIS PRAYER TO THE MOON-GOD, WHO ANSWERS HIS PRAYER WITH A VISION</H3>
<P>The King weeps bitterly with flowing tears<BR>
Above his seer when from him disappears<BR>
The last faint breath; and then in deepest woe<BR>
He cries: "And through that desert must I go?<BR>
Heabani, thou to me wast like the gods;<BR>
Oh, how I loved thee! must thou turn to clods?<BR>
Through that dread desert must I ride alone;<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A></P>
<P>And leave thee here, Heabani, lying prone?<BR>
Alas, I leave thee in this awful place,<BR>
To find our Khasisadra, seek his face,<BR>
The son of Ubara-tutu, the seer;<BR>
Oh, how can I, my friend, thus leave thee here?<BR>
This night through those dark mountains I must go,<BR>
I can no longer bear this awful woe:<BR>
If I shall tarry here, I cannot sleep.<BR>
O Sin, bright moon-god, of yon awful deep!<BR>
I pray to thee upon my face, oh, hear<BR>
My prayer! my supplications bring thou near<BR>
To all the gods! grant thou to me,--e'en me,<BR>
A heart of strength and will to worship thee.</P>
<P>Oh, is this death like that the seer hath dreamed?<BR>
Perhaps the truth then on his spirit gleamed!<BR>
If Land of Silver Sky is but a myth,<BR>
The other dream is true! e'en all he saith!<BR>
Oh, tell me, all ye sparkling stars,<BR>
That wing above thy glorious flight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel not Nature's jars;<BR>
But grandly, sweetly fling thy light<BR>
To our bright world beneath serene,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath mortals on thee known<BR>
Or viewed beyond,--that great Unseen,<BR>
Their future fate by gods been shown?</P>
<P>Oh, hear me, all ye gods on high!<BR>
To gods who love mankind I pray,<BR>
Despairing, oh, I cry!<BR>
Oh, drive these doubts and fears away!<BR>
And yet--and yet, what truths have we?<BR>
O wondrous mortal, must thou die?<BR>
Beyond this end thou canst not see,<BR>
O Life! O Death! O mystery!</P>
<P>The body still is here, with feeling dead!<BR>
And sight is gone!--and hearing from his dead,<BR>
Nor taste, nor smell, nor warmth, nor breath of life!<BR>
Where is my seer? Perhaps, his spirit rife</P>
<P><A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A></P>
<P>E'en now in nothingness doth wander lone!<BR>
In agony his thoughts! with spirit prone!<BR>
In dread despair!--If conscious then, O gods!<BR>
He spake the truth!--His body to the clods<BR>
Hath turned! By this we feel, or hear, or see,<BR>
And when 'tis gone,--exist?--in agony!<BR>
To Hades hath he gone? as he hath thought!<BR>
Alas, the thought is torture, where have wrought<BR>
The gods their fearful curse! Ah, let me think!<BR>
The Silver Sky? Alas, its shining brink<BR>
He hath not crossed. The wrathful gods deny<BR>
Him entrance! Where, oh, where do spirits fly<BR>
Whom gods have cursed? Alas, he is condemned<BR>
To wander lone in that dark world, contemned<BR>
And from the Light of Happy Fields is barred!<BR>
Oh, why do gods thus send a fate so hard,<BR>
And cruel? O dear moon-god, moon-god Sin!<BR>
My seer hath erred. Receive his soul within<BR>
To joys prepared for gods and men! Though seer<BR>
He was, he immortality did fear,<BR>
As some unknown awakening in space.<BR>
Oh, turn upon him thy bright bless&egrave;d face!<BR>
He was my friend! O moon-god, hear my prayer!<BR>
Imploring thee, doth pray thine Izdubar!"</P>
<P>And lo! a vision breaks before his eyes!<BR>
The moon-god hides the shadows of the skies,<BR>
And sweeps above with his soft, soothing light<BR>
That streams around his face; he drives the night<BR>
Before his rays, and with his hands sweet peace<BR>
He spreads through all the skies; and Strife doth cease!<BR>
A girdle spans the Heavens with pure light<BR>
That shines around the River of the Night,<BR>
Within the circling rays a host appears!<BR>
The singers of the skies, as blazing spheres!<BR>
Hark! Hear their harps and lyres that sweetly sound!<BR>
They sing! Oh, how the glowing skies resound!</P><DIR>

<P>Oh, can our songs of bliss here cease?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our souls for joy cannot restrain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweep! Sweep thy lyres again!</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where bliss doth ever flow."</P>
