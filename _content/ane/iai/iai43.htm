<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">IZDUBAR ENTERS HADES--THE SONG OF THE DALKHI IN THE CAVERN OF HORRORS--THE KING PASSES THROUGH HADES TO THE GARDEN OF THE GODS, AND SEES THE WONDERFUL FOUNTAIN OF LIFE'S WATERS</H3>
<P>In a weird passage to the Under-World,<BR>
Where demon shades sit with their pinions furled<BR>
Along the cavern's walls with poisonous breath,<BR>
In rows here mark the labyrinths of Death.<BR>
The King with torch upraised, the pathway finds,<BR>
Along the way of mortal souls he winds,<BR>
Where shades sepulchral, soundless rise amid<BR>
Dark gulfs that yawn, and in the blackness hide<BR>
Their depths beneath the waves of gloomy lakes<BR>
And streams that sleep beneath the sulphurous flakes<BR>
That drift o'er waters bottomless, and chasms;<BR>
Where moveless depths receive Life's dying spasms.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A></P>
<P>Here Silence sits supreme on a drear throne<BR>
Of ebon hue, and joyless reigns alone<BR>
O'er a wide waste of blackness,--solitude<BR>
Black, at her feet, there sleeps the awful flood<BR>
Of mystery which grasps all mortal souls,<BR>
Where grisly horrors sit with crests of ghouls,<BR>
And hateless welcome with their eyes of fire<BR>
Each soul;--remorseless lead to terrors dire;<BR>
And ever, ever crown the god of Fate;<BR>
And there, upon her ebon throne she sate<BR>
The awful fiend, dark goddess Mam-mitu,<BR>
Who reigns through all these realms of La-Atzu.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_254"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>But hark! what are these sounds within the gloom?<BR>
And see! long lines of torches nearer come!<BR>
And now within a recess they have gone;<BR>
The King must pass their door! perhaps some one<BR>
Of them may see him! turn the hags of gloom<BR>
Upon him, as he goes by yonder room!<BR>
He nearer comes, and peers within; and see!<BR>
A greenish glare fills all the cave! and he<BR>
Beholds a blaze beneath a cauldron there;<BR>
Coiled, yonder lie the Dragons of Despair;<BR>
And lo! from every recess springs a form<BR>
Of shapeless horror! now with dread alarm<BR>
He sees the flitting forms wild whirling there,<BR>
And awful wailings come of wild despair:<BR>
But hark! the <I>dal-khis'</I> song rings on the air!<BR>
With groans and cries they shriek their mad despair.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oh, fling on earth, ye demons dark,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your madness, hate, and fell despair,<BR>
And fling your darts at each we mark,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That we may welcome victims here.</P>
<P>Then sing your song of hate, ye fiends,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurl your pestilential breath,<BR>
Till every soul before us bends,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And worship here the god of Death.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In error still for e'er and aye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They see not, hear not many things;<BR>
The unseen forces do not weigh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And each an unknown mystery brings.</P>
<P>In error still for e'er and aye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They delve for phantom shapes that ride<BR>
Across their minds alone,--and they<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But mock the folly of man's pride.</P>
<P>In error still for e'er and aye!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They learn but little all their lives,<BR>
And Wisdom ever wings her way,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Evading ever,--while man strives!</P>
<P>But hark! another song rings through the gloom,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, oh, how sweet the music far doth come!<BR>
Oh, hear it, all ye souls in your despair,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For joy it brings to sorrowing ones e'en here!</P>
<P>"There is a Deep Unknown beyond,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all things hidden well doth weigh!<BR>
On man's blind vision rests the bond<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of error still for e'er and aye!</P>
<P>But to the mighty gods, oh, turn<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For truth to lead you on your way,<BR>
And wisdom from their tablets learn,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever hope for e'er and aye!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And see! the hags disperse within the gloom,<BR>
As those sweet sounds resound within the room;<BR>
And now a glorious light doth shine around,<BR>
Their rays of peace glide o'er the gloomy ground.<BR>
And lo! 'tis Papsukul, our god of Hope,--<BR>
With cheerful face comes down the fearful slope<BR>
Of rugged crags, and blithely strides to where<BR>
Our hero stands, amid the poisonous air,<BR>
And says:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behold, my King, that glorious Light<BR>
That shines beyond! and eye no more this sight<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></P>
<P>Of dreariness, that only brings despair,<BR>
For phantasy of madness reigneth here!"<BR>
The King in wonder carefully now eyes<BR>
The messenger divine with great surprise,<BR>
And says:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But why, thou god of Hope, do I<BR>
Thus find thee in these realms of agony?<BR>
This World around me banishes thy feet<BR>
From paths that welcome here the god of Fate<BR>
And blank despair, and loss irreparable.<BR>
Why comest thou to woe immeasurable?"</P>
<P>"You err, my King, for hope oft rules despair;<BR>
I ofttimes come to reign with darkness here;<BR>
When I am gone, the god of Fate doth reign;<BR>
When I return, I soothe these souls again."<BR>
"So thus you visit all these realms of woe,<BR>
To torture them with hopes they ne'er can know?<BR>
Avaunt! If this thy mission is on Earth<BR>
Or Hell, thou leavest after thee but dearth!"<BR>
"Not so, my King! behold yon glorious sphere,<BR>
Where gods at last take all these souls from here!<BR>
Adieu! thou soon shalt see the World of Light,<BR>
Where joy alone these souls will e'er delight."</P>
<P>The god now vanishes away from sight,<BR>
The hero turns his face toward the light;<BR>
Nine <I>kaspu</I> walks, till weird the rays now gleam,<BR>
As <I>zi-mu-ri</I> behind the shadows stream.<BR>
He sees beyond, umbrageous grots and caves,<BR>
Where odorous plants entwine their glistening leaves.<BR>
And lo! the trees bright flashing gems here bear!<BR>
And trailing vines and flowers do now appear,<BR>
That spread before his eyes a welcome sight,<BR>
Like a sweet dream of some mild summer night.<BR>
But, oh! his path leads o'er that awful stream,<BR>
Across a dizzy arch 'mid sulphurous steam<BR>
That covers all the grimy bridge with slime.<BR>
He stands perplexed beside the waters grime,<BR>
Which sluggish move adown the limbo black,<BR>
With murky waves that writhe demoniac,--<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A></P>
<P>As ebon serpents curling through the gloom<BR>
And burl their inky crests, that silent come<BR>
Toward the yawning gulf, a tide of hate;<BR>
And sweep their dingy waters to Realms of Fate.</P>
<P>He cautious climbs the slippery walls of gloom,<BR>
And dares not look beneath, lest Fate should come;<BR>
He enters now the stifling clouds that creep<BR>
Around the causeway, while its shadows sleep<BR>
Upon the stream that sullen moves below,--</P>
<P>He slips!--and drops his torch! it far doth glow<BR>
Beneath him on the rocks! Alas, in vain<BR>
He seeks a path to bring it back again.<BR>
It moves! snatched by a <I>dal-khu's</I> hand it flies<BR>
Away within the gloom, then falling dies<BR>
Within those waters black with a loud hiss<BR>
That breaks the silence of that dread abyss.</P>
<P>He turns again, amid the darkness gropes,<BR>
And careful climbs the cragged, slimy slopes,<BR>
And now he sees, oh, joy! the light beyond!<BR>
He springs! he flies along the glowing ground,<BR>
And joyous dashes through the waving green<BR>
That lustrous meets his sight with rays serene,<BR>
Where trees pure amber from their trunks distil,<BR>
Where sweet perfumes the groves and arbors fill,<BR>
Where zephyrs murmur odors from the trees,<BR>
And sweep across the flowers, carrying bees<BR>
With honey laden for their nectar store;<BR>
Where humming sun-birds upward flitting soar<BR>
O'er groves that bear rich jewels as their fruit,<BR>
That sparkling tingle from each youngling shoot,<BR>
And fill the garden with a glorious blaze<BR>
Of chastened light and tender thrilling rays.<BR>
He glides through that enchanted mystic world,<BR>
O'er streams with beds of gold that sweetly twirled<BR>
With woven splendor 'neath the blaze of gems<BR>
That crown each tree with glistening diadems.<BR>
The sounds of streams are weft with breezes, chant<BR>
Their arias with trembling leaves,--the haunt<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A></P>
<P>Of gods! O how the tinkling chorus rings!<BR>
With rhythms of the unseen rustling wings<BR>
Of souls that hover here where joy redeems<BR>
Them with a happiness that ever gleams.</P>
<P>The hero stands upon a damasked bed<BR>
Of flowers that glow beneath his welcome tread,<BR>
And softly sink with 'luring odors round,<BR>
And beckon him to them upon the ground.<BR>
Amid rare pinks and violets he lies,<BR>
And one sweet pink low bending near, he eyes.<BR>
With tender petals thrilling on its stem,<BR>
It lifts its fragrant face and says to him,<BR>
"Dear King, wilt thou love me as I do thee?<BR>
We love mankind, and when a mortal see<BR>
We give our fragrance to them with our love,<BR>
Their love for us our inmost heart doth move."<BR>
The King leans down his head, it kissing, says,<BR>
"Sweet beauty, I love thee? with thy sweet face?<BR>
My heart is filled with love for all thy kind.<BR>
I would that every heart thy love should find."<BR>
The fragrant floweret thrills with tenderness,<BR>
With richer fragrance answers his caress.<BR>
He kisses it again and lifts his eyes,<BR>
And rises from the ground with glad surprise.</P>
<P>And see! the glorious spirits clustering round!<BR>
They welcome him with sweet melodious sound.<BR>
We hear their golden instruments of praise,<BR>
As they around him whirl a threading maze;<BR>
In great delight he views their beckoning arms,<BR>
And lustrous eyes, and perfect, moving forms.<BR>
And see! he seizes one bright, charming girl,<BR>
As the enchanting ring doth nearer whirl;<BR>
He grasps her in his arms, and she doth yield<BR>
The treasure of her lips, where sweets distilled<BR>
Give him a joy without a taint of guilt.<BR>
It thrills his heart-strings till his soul doth melt,<BR>
A kiss of chastity, and love, and fire,<BR>
A joy that few can dare to here aspire.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A></P>
<P>The beauteous spirit has her joy, and flees<BR>
With all her sister spirits 'neath the trees.<BR>
And lo! the <I>gesdin</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> shining stands,<BR>
With crystal branches in the golden sands,<BR>
In this immortal garden stands the tree,<BR>
With trunk of gold, and beautiful to see.<BR>
Beside a sacred fount the tree is placed,<BR>
With emeralds and unknown gems is graced,<BR>
Thus stands, the prince of emeralds,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Elam's tree,<BR>
As once it stood, gave Immortality<BR>
To man, and bearing fruit, there sacred grew,<BR>
Till Heaven claimed again Fair Eridu.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></P>
<P>The hero now the wondrous fountain eyes;<BR>
Its beryl base to ruby stem doth rise,<BR>
To emerald and sapphire bands that glow,<BR>
Where the bright curvings graceful outward flow;<BR>
Around the fountain to its widest part,<BR>
The wondrous lazite bands now curling start<BR>
And mingle with bright amethyst that glows,<BR>
To a broad diamond band,--contracting grows<BR>
To <I>uk-ni</I> stone, turquoise, and clustering pearls,<BR>
Inlaid with gold in many curious curls<BR>
Of twining vines and tendrils bearing birds,<BR>
Among the leaves and blooming flowers, that words<BR>
May not reveal, such loveliness in art,<BR>
With fancies spirit hands can only start<BR>
From plastic elements before the eye,<BR>
And mingle there the charms of empery.<BR>
Beneath two diamond doves that shining glow<BR>
Upon the summit, the bright waters flow,<BR>
With aromatic splendors to the skies,<BR>
While glistening colors of the rainbow rise.</P>
<P>Here ends the tablet,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> "When the hero viewed<BR>
The fountain which within the garden stood."</P>
