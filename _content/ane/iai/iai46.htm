<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">KHASISADRA ON THE SHORE SEES THE VESSEL COMING, AND RETURNING TO HIS PALACE, SENDS HIS DAUGHTER MUA TO WELCOME IZDUBAR--MEETING OF THE KING AND SAGE</H3>
<P>Beneath a ku-tree Khasisadra eyes<BR>
The spreading sea beneath the azure skies,<BR>
An ag&egrave;d youth with features grave, serene,<BR>
Matured with godly wisdom; ne'er was seen<BR>
Such majesty, nor young, nor old,--a seer<BR>
In purpose high. The countenance no fear<BR>
Of death has marred, but on his face sublime<BR>
The perfect soul has left its seal through time.</P>
<P>"Ah, yes! the dream was clear, the vision true,<BR>
I saw him on the ship! Is it in view?<BR>
A speck! Ah, yes! He comes! he comes to me<BR>
My son from Erech comes across the sea!"<BR>
Back to his palace goes the holy seer,<BR>
And Mua&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> sends, who now the shore doth near;<BR>
As beautiful as Waters of the Dawn,<BR>
Comes Mua here, as graceful as a fawn.</P>
<P>The King now standing on the glistening sand,<BR>
Beholds the beauteous Mua where she stands,<BR>
With hands outstretched in welcome to the King,<BR>
"O thou sweet spirit, with thy snowy wing,<BR>
Oh, where is Khasisadra in this land?<BR>
I seek the aid of his immortal hand."<BR>
"Great Sar," said Mua, "hadst thou not a seer,<BR>
That thou shouldst come to seek my father here?"</P>
<P>"'Tis true, my daughter dear, a seer had I,<BR>
Whom I have lost,--a dire calamity;<BR>
By his advice and love I undertake<BR>
This journey. But alas! for mine own sake<BR>
He fell by perils on this lengthened way;<BR>
He was not strong, and feared that he should lay<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_147"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147</FONT></A></P>
<P>Himself to rest amid the mountains wild.<BR>
He was a warrior, with him I killed<BR>
Khumbaba, Elam's king who safely dwelt<BR>
Within a forest vast of pines, and dealt<BR>
Destruction o'er the plains. We razed his walls--<BR>
My friend at last before me dying falls.</P>
<P>Alas! why did my seer attempt to slay<BR>
The dragons that we met upon the way,<BR>
He slew his foe, and like a lion died.<BR>
Ah, me! the cause, when I the gods defied,<BR>
And brought upon us all this awful woe;<BR>
In sorrow o'er his death, my life must flow!<BR>
For this I came to find the ancient seer,<BR>
Lead me to him, I pray, if he lives here."</P>
<P>Then Mua leads him through the glorious land<BR>
Of matchless splendor, on the border grand<BR>
Of those wide Happy Fields that spread afar<BR>
O'er beaming hills and vales, where ambient air<BR>
With sweetest zephyrs sweeps a grand estrade,<BR>
Where softest odors from each flowering glade<BR>
Lull every sense aswoon that breathes not bliss<BR>
And harmony with World of Blessedness.<BR>
'Neath trees of luring fruits she leads the way,<BR>
Through paths of flowers where night hath fled away,<BR>
A wilderness of varied crystal flowers,<BR>
Where fragrance rests o'er clustering, shining bowers.<BR>
Each gleaming cup its nectared wine distils,<BR>
For spirit lips each chalice ever fills.</P>
<P>Beyond the groves a lucent palace shone<BR>
In grandest splendor near an inner zone;<BR>
In amethyst and gold divinely rose,<BR>
With glories scintillant the palace glows.<BR>
A dazzling halo crowns its lofty domes,<BR>
And spreading from its summit softly comes<BR>
With grateful rays, and floods the balustrades<BR>
And golden statues 'neath the high arcades;<BR>
A holy palace built by magic hand<BR>
With wondrous architecture, portals grand,<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_148"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 148</FONT></A></P>
<P>And aurine turrets piled to dizzy heights,<BR>
Oh, how its glory Izdubar delights!</P>
<P>Beneath majestic arcades carved, they pass,<BR>
Up golden steps that shine like polished glass,<BR>
Through noble corridors with sculptured walls,<BR>
By lofty columns, archways to the halls<BR>
Of glories, the bright harbinger of fanes<BR>
Of greater splendor of the Heavenly plains.<BR>
Beneath an arch of gems the King espies<BR>
A form immortal, he who death defies.<BR>
Advancing forth the sage his welcome gives,<BR>
"'Tis Izdubar who comes to me and lives!"<BR>
Embracing him he leads him in a room,<BR>
Where many a curious graven tablet, tome,<BR>
And scrolls of quaint and old forgotten lore<BR>
Have slept within for centuries of yore.<BR>
The tablets high are heaped, the alcoves full,<BR>
Where truth at last has found a welcome goal.<BR>
In wisdom's room, the sage his guest has led,<BR>
And seats him till the banquet high is spread;<BR>
Of Izdubar he learns his journeys great,<BR>
How he for aid has left his throne of state.</P>
<P>The maid now comes, him welcomes to the hall<BR>
Of banquets, where are viands liberal,<BR>
And fruits, immortal bread, celestial wines<BR>
Of vintage old; and when the hero dines,<BR>
They lead him to his private chamber room<BR>
That overlooks the wondrous garden's bloom<BR>
Across the plain and jasper sea divine,<BR>
To Heaven's mountains rising sapphirine.<BR>
Four beauteous streams of liquid silver lead<BR>
Across the plain; the shining sea they feed;<BR>
The King reclines upon his couch at rest,<BR>
With dreams of happiness alone is blest.</P>
