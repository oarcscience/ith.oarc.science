<P>The nectared cup the queen placed to his lips,<BR>
And o'er his heaving breast the nectar drips,<BR>
And now his arms are folded round his queen,<BR>
And her fond kisses he returns again;<BR>
And see! they bring to him his harp of gold,<BR>
And from its strings, sweet music as of old<BR>
His skilful hands wake through the sounding domes;<BR>
Oh, how his Song of Love wakes those dark rooms!</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"My Queen of Love comes to my arms!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her faithful eyes have sought for me,<BR>
My Love comes to me with her charms;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all the world now happy be!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My queen has come again!</P>
<P>Forever, dearest, let me rest<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the bosom of my queen!<BR>
Thy lips of love are honeyed best;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come! let us fly to bowering green!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To our sweet bower again.</P></DIR>

<P>O Love on Earth! O Love in Heaven!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That dearest gift which gods have given,<BR>
Through all my soul let it be driven,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And make my heart its dearest haven,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Love returns the kiss!</P>
<P>Oh! let me pillow there within<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy breast, and, oh, so sweetly rest,<BR>
My life anew shall there begin;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On thy sweet charms, oh, let me feast!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life knows no sweeter bliss.</P>
<P>Oh, let me feast upon thy lips,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As honey-bird the nectar sips,<BR>
And drink new rapture through my lips,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As honey-bee its head thus drips<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In nectarine abyss!</P>
<P>O Love, sweet queen I my heart is thine!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My Life I clasp within mine arms!<BR>
My fondest charmer, queen divine!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul surrenders to thy charms,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bliss would fly away.</P>
<P>No dearer joy than this I want;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If love is banished from that life<BR>
There bodyless, my soul would pant,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pine away in hopeless grief,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If love be fled away.</P>
<P>If Love should bide and fold her wings<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In bowers of yonder gleaming skies,<BR>
Unmeaning then each bard oft sings<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of bliss that lives on earth and dies,--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want such love as this.</P>
<P>I want thy form, thy loving breast,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine arms of love surrounding thee,<BR>
And on thy bosom sweetly rest,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else that world were dead to me.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other life is bliss.</P></DIR>

<P>If it is thus, my queen, I go<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With joy to yonder blissful clime;<BR>
But if not so, then let me flow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To soil and streams through changing time,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me would be more bliss.</P>
<P>For then, in blooming flowerets, I<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could earth adorn, my soul delight,<BR>
And never thus on earth could die;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For though I should be hid from sight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would spring again with joy!</P>
<P>And sing as some sweet warbling bird,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in the breezes wave as grain,<BR>
As yellow sun-birds there have whirred<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On earth, could I thus live again,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That beauteous world enjoy!</P>
<P>'Mid safflower-fields or waving cane,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in the honeysuckles lie,<BR>
In forms of life would breathe again,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy Earth's sweetest revelry,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever spring again!</P>
<P>Each life to me new joys would bring,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In breast of beast or bird or flower,<BR>
In each new form new joys would spring,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And happy, ever, Love would soar!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triumphant filled with joy!</P>
<P>In jujube or tamarisk<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps would come to life again,<BR>
Or in the form of fawns would frisk<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid violets upon the plain;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I should live again!</P>
<P>And throb beneath the glistening dew,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In bamboo tufts, or mango-trees,<BR>
In lotus bloom, and spring anew,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In rose-tree bud, or such as these<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Earth return again!</P></DIR>

<P>And I should learn to love my mate,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In beast or singing bird or flower,<BR>
For kiss of love in hope could wait;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I then would come that hour,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In form I have again!</P>
<P>And love you say, my queen, is there-,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I can breathe with life anew?<BR>
But is it so? My Love, beware!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For some things oft are false, some true,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I thee trust again!</P>
<P>We fly away! from gates away!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, life of bliss! Oh, breath of balm!<BR>
With wings we tread the Silver Way,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To trailing vines and feathery palm,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bower of love again."</P>
