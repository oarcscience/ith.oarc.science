<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT OF THE RIVAL GIANTS--DEATH OF KHUMBABA</H3>
<P>Now the black forest through, the Sar and seer<BR>
Sought for their foe, Khumbaba, far and near;<BR>
But he had fled when he beheld the gods<BR>
In fury rushing from their bright abodes.<BR>
Now from the battle-field the King and seer<BR>
The farthest limit of the forest near,<BR>
And passing on, the Sar thus to his seer:<BR>
"The gods have filled our foeman's heart with fear:<BR>
He comes not forth to meet us 'neath his walls."<BR>
But lo! within their sight, far from his halls,<BR>
Khumbaba stands beside his steed of snow<BR>
Held by his queen, and eyes his coming foe.<BR>
Heabani cries: "Behold the enemy!<BR>
And with his queen from us disdains to fly!"</P>
<P><A NAME="page_76"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 76</FONT></A></P>
<P>And Izdubar turned to Heabani, said:<BR>
"My seer, methought this King from us had fled;<BR>
His army slain or scattered from us fly;<BR>
But by our hands this monarch here must die."<BR>
Heabani eyed Khumbaba, nor replied<BR>
Before the Queen, who wrung her hands and cried;<BR>
And Izdubar continued:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, of war,<BR>
It seems, doth lack in skill, and from afar<BR>
He scents the battle, while his fighting men<BR>
Their raids oft make, and here return again;<BR>
His castle we may enter without fear,<BR>
And thou his queen mayst have who standeth here,<BR>
And now we end the reign of Elam's throne;<BR>
So lend thy hand to strike this monarch prone.<BR>
My friend, if I mistake thee not, for war<BR>
Thou art prepared, since thou upon the car<BR>
Wast wont to ride in former years now gone;<BR>
And if he falls, a feast day of the Sun<BR>
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>We will appoint, and may the birds of prey<BR>
Surround his carcass on this glorious day:<BR>
But stay! this giant I will slay alone,<BR>
Although his weight is many <I>gur-ri</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> stone;<BR>
This giant's form the gods have surely made<BR>
An enemy well worthy of my blade."</P>
<P>And Izdubar upon his foe advanced,<BR>
Who waiting stood, and at him fiercely glanced,<BR>
And naught replied; but raised his glory blade.<BR>
Their furious glance, the giant's queen dismayed.<BR>
She wildly eyed the rivals towering high,<BR>
And breathless stood, then quickly turned to fly,<BR>
As Izdubar upon his heavy shield<BR>
Received Khumbaba's stroke, and then doth wield<BR>
His massive blade as lightning o'er his head,<BR>
He strikes the giant's helmet on the mead.<BR>
Khumbaba, furious, strikes a mighty blow,<BR>
Which staggers Izdubar, who on his foe</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></P>
<P>Now springs and rains upon him faster blows,<BR>
Until his blade with fire continuous glows.<BR>
Khumbaba caught his blows on sword and shield<BR>
With parries; thrusts returned, and naught would yield;<BR>
And thus they fought, the peerless kings of war.<BR>
Now Ishtar downward drove his raging car,<BR>
And in Khumbaba's eyes her rays she cast,<BR>
The giant turned his glance--it was his last;<BR>
Unwary caught, his foe has swung his sword,<BR>
Khumbaba's gory head rolls o'er the sward.</P>
