<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">IZDUBAR SLAYS THE MIDANNU IN THE FESTIVE HALL, AND HEABANI DECLARES HIM TO BE A GOD</H3>
<P>The guests are seated round the festal board;<BR>
Heabani takes his seat beside his lord.<BR>
The choicest viands of the wealthy plain<BR>
Before them placed and fishes of the main,<BR>
With wines and cordials, juices rich and rare<BR>
The chieftains all enjoy--the royal fare.<BR>
This day, with Izdubar they laugh and joke<BR>
'Mid courtesies and mirth, and oft provoke<BR>
The ringing merry laughter through the halls.<BR>
When all are satisfied within the walls,<BR>
Their fill have eaten of the royal fare,<BR>
With wine they banish from them every care.</P>
<P>The Su-khu-li&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with tinkling bells proclaim,<BR>
"Our Sar would speak! Our king of mighty fame."<BR>
Who says: "My chieftains, lords, our seer requests<BR>
A test of strength before assembled guests;<BR>
Unarmed requires your Sar-dan-nu to slay<BR>
The Mid-an-nu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> which he hath brought to-day.<BR>
So stand aside, my friends, behold the test!<BR>
Your Sar will satisfy his seer and guest."<BR>
The monster now is brought before the king,<BR>
Heabani him unchains to let him spring<BR>
Upon the giant king. His chieftains stand<BR>
In terror looking at their monarch grand,<BR>
Who smiling stands, his eyes on the beast fixed;<BR>
While they in wildest terror are transfixed.</P>

<P>Heabani claps his hands towards the king,<BR>
And the wild beast upon his form doth spring.<BR>
The giant grasps its throat in high mid-air,<BR>
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> And holds it 'neath his arm without a fear.<BR>
With sullen choking roars it struggling dies,<BR>
While shouts of joy from all the guests arise.<BR>
The mighty deed of strength the seer appals,<BR>
And at the feet of Izdubar he falls:<BR>
"Immortal king! illustrious of men!<BR>
Thy glorious strength reveals the gods again<BR>
On earth. To thee I bow in reverent fear,<BR>
A god returned thou art! O Erech, hear!<BR>
Of kingdoms thou art blessed with grandest fame,<BR>
That thou among thy kings a god can name."<BR>
Again they gathered round the festal board,<BR>
And joy and revelry they soon restored.<BR>
The revels high are raised o'er sparkling wine;<BR>
Through all the night they praise their king divine.</P>
