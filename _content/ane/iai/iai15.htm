<P>Our Izdubar dear Erech raised<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From her distress, when she did mourn;<BR>
With joy his glorious name be praised!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a great warrior's daughter born,<BR>
And Bel in his own might, him arms,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Erech's sons and daughters save;<BR>
What other Sar hath glorious charms<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like his, who saved proud Elam's slave?</P></DIR>

<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">Chorus</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</I><P>No rival hath our mighty Sar,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy cymbals strike and raise the cry!<BR>
All hail! All hail! great Izdubar!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His deeds immortal glorify!</P>
<P>Our Izdubar our sons preserves<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To all our fathers day and night,<BR>
And Erech's ruler well deserves<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our highest praise, whose matchless might<BR>
Delights the gods! All hail our Sar!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose firmness, wisdom need no praise!<BR>
Queen Daunat's son, our Izdubar,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His glory to the Sami&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> raise!</P></DIR>

<P>And thus of Seer Heabani they now chant<BR>
His birth and history and hyemal haunt.</P><DIR>

<P>Who can compare with thee, O Nin!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of Bel; thy hands didst lay<BR>
Upon Ar-ur-u, thine own queen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With glory crowned her on that day.</P>
<P>To her thy strength did give, and blessed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her with thy love and a dear son;<BR>
With Anu's strength within his breast,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ninip sped then to his throne.</P>
<P>When Queen Ar-u-ru hears her lord<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From Erech's city far has gone,<BR>
She bows her head upon the sward,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With pleading hands in woe doth moan.</P>
<P>And to Heabani she gave birth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior, great Ninip's son,<BR>
Whose fame is spread through all the earth.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen with her own maids alone<BR>
Retired within her palace walls<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For purity in Erech's halls.</P>
<P>Like the corn-god his face concealed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of men and countries he possessed,<BR>
Great wisdom by the gods revealed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ner&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the god, his limbs were dressed.<BR>
With wild gazelles he ate his food<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While roaming with them in the night;<BR>
For days he wandered in the wood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bu-hir-tser-i&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> him delight.</P>
<P>The Zi-ar-ri&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Heabani loves,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That play within the running streams;<BR>
With Zi-ti-am-a-ti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> he roves<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the sands in warm sunbeams.</P>

<P>"The prince returns, O Sar!" the herald said,<BR>
And low before the throne he bowed his head;<BR>
"Our Zaidu, the bewitcher of all men,<BR>
Doth unsuccessful to us come again.<BR>
Before the cave the seer confronted him<BR>
Three days where Khar-sak's snowy brow doth gleam.<BR>
Heabani with his beast in his cave went,<BR>
And Zaidu waited, but his courage spent<BR>
When he beheld the seer and beast remain<BR>
Within the cave, and all his words were vain.<BR>
The prince remains without with downcast face<BR>
And beg of thee, his Sar, thy sovereign grace."<BR>
The king to all the maidens waves his hand,<BR>
Then vanishes from sight the choral band.</P>
