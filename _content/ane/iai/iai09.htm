<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE KING'S SECOND DREAM AND EARLY RIDE UPON SUMIR'S PLAIN, AND HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT ON THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES</H3>
<P>The night is fleeing from the light of dawn,<BR>
Which dimly falls upon the palace lawn;<BR>
The King upon his royal <I>dum-khi</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> sleeps,<BR>
And to his couch again Queen Ishtar creeps.<BR>
In spite his dream to dismal thoughts she turns,<BR>
Her victim tosses, now with fever burns:<BR>
He wildly starts, and from his <I>dum-khi</I> springs,<BR>
While loud his voice throughout the palace rings:<BR>
"Ho! vassals! haste to me! your King!" he cries,<BR>
And stamping fiercely while, his passions rise.<BR>
The <I>sukh-li</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and <I>masari</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> rush in:<BR>
"What trouble, Sar? have foes here come within?<BR>
Then searching around they in his chamber rush,<BR>
And eagerly aside the curtains push.<BR>
The King yet paces on the floor with strides<BR>
That show the trouble of his mind, and chides<BR>
Them all as laggards; "Soon the sun will rise:<BR>
My steed prepared bring hence!" he turning cries.<BR>
He mounts and gallops through the swinging gates,<BR>
Nor for attendance of his vassals waits.<BR>
Nor turns his face toward the <I>nam-za-khi</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><BR>
Who quickly opened for the King to fly<BR>
Without the gates; across the plains he rides<BR>
Away unmindful where his steed he guides.<BR>
The horse's hoofs resound upon the plain<BR>
As the lone horseman with bewildered brain,<BR>
To leave behind the phantoms of the night,<BR>
Rides fiercely through the early morning light,<BR>
Beyond the orange orchards, citron groves,<BR>
'Mid feathery date-palms he reckless roves.</P>

<P>The fields of yellow grain mid fig-trees flash<BR>
Unseen, and prickly pears, pomegranates, dash<BR>
In quick succession by, till the white foam<BR>
From his steed's mouth and quiv'ring flanks doth come;<BR>
Nor heeds the whitened flowing mane, but flies,<BR>
While clouds of dust him follow, and arise<BR>
Behind him o'er the road like black storm clouds,<BR>
While Zu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> the storm-bird onward fiercely goads<BR>
The seven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> raven spirits of the air,<BR>
And Nus-ku&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> opens wide the fiery glare<BR>
Of pent-up lightnings for fierce Gibil's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> hand,<BR>
Who hurls them forth at Nergal's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> stern command,<BR>
And Rimmon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> rides triumphant on the air,<BR>
And Ninazu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> for victims doth prepare,<BR>
The King rides from the road into the wild,<BR>
Nor thought of danger, his stern features smiled<BR>
As the worn steed from a huge lion shied,<BR>
Which turning glanced at them and sprang aside;<BR>
Now Zi-pis-au-ni&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> fly before the King.<BR>
And yellow leopards through the rushes spring.<BR>
Upon Euphrates' banks his steed he reins,<BR>
And views the rosy wilds of Sumir's plains.</P>
<P>He looked toward the east across the plain<BR>
That stretched afar o'er brake and marshy fen,<BR>
And clustering trees that marked the Tigris' course;<BR>
And now beyond the plain o'er fields and moors,<BR>
The mountain range of Zu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> o'er Susa's land<BR>
Is glowing 'neath the touch of Samas' hand;<BR>
For his bright face is rising in the east,<BR>
And shifting clouds from sea and rising mist,<BR>
The robes of purple, violet and gold,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A></P>
<P>With rosy tints the form of Samas fold.<BR>
The tamarisk and scarlet mistletoe,<BR>
With green acacias' golden summits glow,<BR>
And citron, olives, myrtle, climbing vine,<BR>
Arbutus, cypress, plane-tree rise divine;<BR>
The emerald verdure, clad with brilliant lines,<BR>
With rose-tree forests quaffs the morning dews..<BR>
The King delighted bares his troubled brow,<BR>
In Samas' golden rays doth holy bow.<BR>
But see! a shadow steals along the ground!<BR>
And trampling footsteps through the copses sound,<BR>
And Izdubar, his hand placed on his sword,<BR>
Loud cries:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who cometh o'er mine Erech's sward?"<BR>
An arm&egrave;d warrior before him springs;<BR>
The King, dismounted, his bright weapon swings.<BR>
"'Tis I, Prince Dib-bara,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Lord Izdubar,<BR>
And now at last alone we meet in war;<BR>
My soldiers you o'erthrew upon the field,<BR>
But here to Nuk-khu's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> son thine arm shall yield!<BR>
The monarch eyes the warrior evil-born,<BR>
And thus replies to him with bitter scorn:<BR>
"And dost thou think that Samas' son shall die<BR>
By a vile foe who from my host did fly?<BR>
Or canst thou hope that sons of darkness may<BR>
The Heaven-born of Light and glory slay?<BR>
As well mayst hope to quench the god of fire,<BR>
But thou shalt die if death from me desire."<BR>
The giant forms a moment fiercely glared,<BR>
And carefully advanced with weapons bared,<BR>
Which flash in the bright rays like blades of fire,<BR>
And now in parry meet with blazing ire.<BR>
Each firmly stood and rained their ringing blows,<BR>
And caught each stroke upon their blades, till glows<BR>
The forest round with sparks of fire that flew<BR>
Like blazing meteors from their weapons true;</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A></P>
<P>And towering In their rage they cautious sprung<BR>
Upon each, foiled, while the deep Suk-ha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> rung.<BR>
At last the monarch struck a mighty blow,<BR>
His foeman's shield of gold, his blade cleft through;<BR>
And as the lightning swung again his sword,<BR>
And struck the chieftain's blade upon the sward,<BR>
A Sedu springs from out the tangled copse,<BR>
And at his feet the sword still ringing drops.<BR>
The King his sword placed at his foeman's throat<BR>
And shouted:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hal-ca&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> to yon waiting boat!<BR>
Or I will send thy body down this stream!<BR>
<I>Ca is-kab-bu! va kal-bu!</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> whence you came!<BR>
The chief disarmed now slunk away surprised,<BR>
And o'er the strength of Sar-dan-nu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="iai10.htm#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> surmised.<BR>
The King returns, and rides within the gate<BR>
Of Erech, and the council entered late.</P>
