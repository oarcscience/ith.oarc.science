<P>Thus in Heabani's cave the maiden went,<BR>
And o'er the sleeping seer her form she bent;<BR>
O'er him who with gazelles oft eats his food;<BR>
O'er him who drinks with <I>bhu-ri</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the wood;<BR>
O'er him who loves the <I>zir-ri</I>,--of them dreams,<BR>
And sports with them within the mountain streams.<BR>
And when the gay enticer saw the seer<BR>
Unconscious sleeping with sweet joy so near,<BR>
She clasped him to her breast and kissed his brow.<BR>
The seer awakes, with wonder eyes her now:<BR>
"Thy glory thou hast brought to me!" he saith,<BR>
"Sweet Zir-ru comes to me with fragrant breath!"<BR>
And with delight he eyes her beauteous form,<BR>
His breast warm moved by the enticer's charm.<BR>
He springs upon his feet and her pursues:<BR>
She laughing flees; to sport with him doth choose.</P>
<P>And now he eyes his hairy body, arms<BR>
Compared to Sam-kha's snowy god-like charms,<BR>
She give to him her freshness, blooming youth?<BR>
She laughing comes again to him,--Forsooth!<BR>
Her glorious arms she opens, flees away,<BR>
While he doth follow the enticer gay.<BR>
He seizes, kisses, takes away her breath,<BR>
And she falls to the ground--perhaps in death<BR>
He thinks, and o'er her leans where she now lay;<BR>
At last she breathes, and springs, and flees away.<BR>
But he the sport enjoys, and her pursues;<BR>
But glancing back his arms she doth refuse.<BR>
And thus three days and four of nights she played;<BR>
For of Heabani's love she was afraid.<BR>
Her joyous company doth him inspire<BR>
For Sam-kha, joy, and love, and wild desire.<BR>
He was not satisfied unless her form<BR>
Remained before him with her endless charm.<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P>But when his <I>bhu-ri</I> of the field the sight<BR>
Beheld, the wild gazelles fled in affright.<BR>
And now without the cave they came in view<BR>
Of Zaidu waiting with sweet Kharim-tu,</P>
<P>And when Heabani saw the rounded form<BR>
Of bright Kharim-tu, her voluptuous charm<BR>
Drew him to her, and at her feet he sate<BR>
With wistful face, resigned to any fate.<BR>
Kharim-tu, smiling sweetly, bent her head,<BR>
Enticing him the tempter coyly said,<BR>
"Heabani, like a famous god thou art,<BR>
Why with these creeping things doth sleep thy heart?<BR>
Come thou with me to Erech Su-bu-ri&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
To Anu's temple Elli-tar-du-si,<BR>
And Ishtar's city where great Izdubar<BR>
Doth reign, the glorious giant king of war;<BR>
Whose mighty strength above his chiefs doth tower,<BR>
Come see our giant king of matchless power."<BR>
Her flashing eyes half languid pierce the seer,<BR>
Until his first resolves all disappear.<BR>
And rising to his feet his eyes he turned<BR>
Toward sweet Joy,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> whose love for him yet burned;<BR>
And eyeing both with beaming face he saith,<BR>
"With Sam-kha's love the seer hath pledged his faith;<BR>
And I will go to Elli-tar-du-si,<BR>
Great Anu's seat and Ishtar's where with thee,<BR>
I will behold the giant Izdubar,<BR>
Whose fame is known to me as king of war;<BR>
And I will meet him there, and test the power<BR>
Of him whose fame above all men doth tower.<BR>
A <I>mid-dan-nu</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to Erech I will take,<BR>
To see if he its mighty strength can break.<BR>
In these wild caves its strength has mighty grown;<BR>
If he the beast destroys, I will make known<BR>
His dream to him--e'en all the seer doth know;<BR>
And now with thee to Erech I will go.</P>
