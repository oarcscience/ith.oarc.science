This is a Victorian poetic translation of the saga of Izdubar. Who is
Izdubar? Izdubar is a literal translation of the ideograph for
'Gilgamesh', and was how the hero of the Gilgamesh saga was known when
this book was written in the 1880s. A lexicographic tablet was finally
discovered several decades later in which Izdubar was equated with
Gilgamesh.

When this was written, only fragments of the epic had been found, and
Hamilton had to supply continuity and motivation in several cases. The
attentive reader will notice some differences here between the Gilgamesh
epic as known today and Hamiltons' poem. In *Gilgamesh* the King's
companion, Enkidu is originally a wild man, created to distract
Gilgamesh. In *Izdubar* the equivalent character is a sage who is lured
from the wilderness to interpret the King's dreams. Humbaba is a ogre in
*Gilgamesh*, a supernatural being, who Gilgamesh and Enkidu battle using
supernatural means. Here (called Khumbaba) he is a human being, a King
whom Izdubar defeats in combat. Hamilton also embellished his version
using extraneous material such as religious hymns and magical
incantations (which, to be fair, he carefully cited sources for in the
footnotes). Strangely enough, Hamilton left out one of the most
interesting parts of the Gilgamesh saga and the first to be discovered:
the story of the Deluge.

Nevertheless, this constitutes one of the earliest translations of the
Gilgamesh saga and is the only complete one (such as it is) known to be
in the public domain. Thanks to John Mark Ockerbloom of [Online
