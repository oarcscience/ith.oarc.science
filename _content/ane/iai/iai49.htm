<P>Sweet Mua lifts her eyes toward the heights<BR>
That glow afar beneath the softened lights<BR>
That rest upon the mountain's crystalline.<BR>
And see! they change their hues incarnadine<BR>
To gold, and emerald, and opaline;<BR>
Swift changing to a softened festucine<BR>
Before the eye. And thus they change their hues<BR>
To please the sight of every soul that views<BR>
Them in that Land; but she heeds not the skies,<BR>
Or glorious splendor of her home; her eves<BR>
Have that far look of spirits viewing men<BR>
On earth, from the invisible mane,<BR>
That erstwhile rests upon the mortal eye,--<BR>
A longing for that home beyond the sky;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A></P>
<P>A yearning for that bliss that love imparts,<BR>
Where pain and sorrow reach no mortal hearts.</P>
<P>A light now breaks across her beauteous face;<BR>
She, turning, says to him with Heavenly grace:</P>
<P>"Dear Izdubar, thou knowest how I love<BR>
Thee, how my heart my love doth daily prove;<BR>
And, oh, I cannot let thee go alone.<BR>
I know not what awaits each soul there gone.<BR>
Our spirits often leave this glorious land,<BR>
Invisible return on earth, and stand<BR>
Amidst its flowerets, 'neath its glorious skies.<BR>
Thou knowest every spirit here oft flies<BR>
From earth, but none its secrets to us tell,<BR>
Lest some dark sorrow might here work its spell.<BR>
And, oh, I could not see dark suffering, woe<BR>
There spread, with power none to stop its flow!</P>
<P>I saw thee coming to us struck with fire,<BR>
Oh, how to aid thee did my heart desire!<BR>
Our tablets tell us how dread sorrow spreads<BR>
Upon that world and mars its glowing meads.<BR>
But, oh, so happy am I, here to know<BR>
That they with us here end all sorrow, woe.<BR>
O precious Izdubar! its sights would strike<BR>
Me there with sadness, and my heart would break!<BR>
And yet I learn that it is glorious, sweet!<BR>
To there enjoy its happiness,--so fleet<BR>
It speeds to sorrowing hearts to turn their tears<BR>
To joy! How sweet to them when it appears,<BR>
And sends a gleam of Heaven through their lives!</P>
<P>No! no! dear heart! I cannot go! It grieves<BR>
Thee! come, my dear one! quick to us return;<BR>
We here again will pair our love, and learn<BR>
How sweet it is to meet with joy again;<BR>
How happy will sweet love come to us then!"</P>
<P>She rests her head upon his breast, and lifts<BR>
Her face for Love's sweet kiss, and from them drifts<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A></P>
<P>A halo o'er the shining gesdin-trees<BR>
And spreads around them Heaven's holy rays.<BR>
He <A HREF="errata.htm#1">kisses</A> her sweet lips, and brow, and eyes,<BR>
Then turns his gaze toward the glowing skies:</P>
<P>"I bless thee, for thy sweetest spirit here!<BR>
I bless this glorious land, that brings me near<BR>
To one that wafts sweet Heaven in my heart;<BR>
From thy dear plains how can my soul depart?<BR>
O Mua, Mua! how my heart now sings!<BR>
Thy love is sweeter than all earthly things!<BR>
I would I were not crowned a king!--away<BR>
From this bright land--here would I ever stay!<BR>
As thou hast said, I soon will here return;<BR>
The earth cannot withhold me from this bourne,<BR>
And soon my time allotted there will end,<BR>
And hitherward how happy I will wend!"</P>
<P>"And when thou goest, how my love shall there<BR>
Guard thee, and keep thy heart with Mua here.<BR>
Another kiss!"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her form doth disappear<BR>
Within the garden, gliding through the air.<BR>
He seats himself upon a couch and rests<BR>
His head upon his hand, and thought invests<BR>
Him round. His memory returns again<BR>
To Erech's throne, and all the haunts of men.<BR>
He rises, turns his footsteps to the halls,<BR>
And thoughtful disappears within its walls.</P>
