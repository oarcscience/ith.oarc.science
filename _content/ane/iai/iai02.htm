<P>O LOVE, my queen and goddess, come to me;<BR>
My soul shall never cease to worship thee;<BR>
Come pillow here thy head upon my breast,<BR>
And whisper in my lyre thy softest, best,<BR>
And sweetest melodies of bright <I>Sami</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Our Happy Fields&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> above dear <I>Subartu</I>;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
Come nestle closely with those lips of love<BR>
And balmy breath, and I with thee shall rove<BR>
Through <I>Sari</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> past ere life on earth was known,<BR>
And Time unconscious sped not, nor had flown.<BR>
Thou art our all in this impassioned life:<BR>
How sweetly comes thy presence ending strife,<BR>
Thou god of peace and Heaven's undying joy,<BR>
Oh, hast thou ever left one pain or cloy<BR>
Upon this beauteous world to us so dear?<BR>
To all mankind thou art their goddess here.<BR>
To thee we sing, our holiest, fairest god,<BR>
The One who in that awful chaos trod<BR>
And woke the Elements by Law of Love<BR>
To teeming worlds in harmony to move.<BR>
From chaos thou hast led us by thy hand,<BR>
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Thus spoke to man upon that budding land:<BR>
"The Queen of Heaven, of the dawn am I,<BR>
The goddess of all wide immensity,</P>

<P>For thee I open wide the golden gate<BR>
Of happiness, and for thee love create<BR>
To glorify the heavens and fill with joy<BR>
The earth, its children with sweet love employ."<BR>
Thou gavest then the noblest melody<BR>
And highest bliss--grand nature's harmony.<BR>
With love the finest particle is rife,<BR>
And deftly woven in the woof of life,<BR>
In throbbing dust or clasping grains of sand,<BR>
In globes of glistening dew that shining stand<BR>
On each pure petal, Love's own legacies<BR>
Of flowering verdure, Earth's sweet panoplies;<BR>
By love those atoms sip their sweets and pass<BR>
To other atoms, join and keep the mass<BR>
With mighty forces moving through all space,<BR>
'Tis thus on earth all life has found its place.<BR>
Through Kisar,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> Love came formless through the air<BR>
In countless forms behold her everywhere!<BR>
Oh, could we hear those whispering roses sweet,<BR>
Three beauties bending till their petals meet,<BR>
And blushing, mingling their sweet fragrance there<BR>
In language yet unknown to mortal ear.<BR>
Their whisperings of love from morn till night<BR>
Would teach us tenderly to love the right.<BR>
O Love, here stay! Let chaos not return!<BR>
With hate each atom would its lover spurn<BR>
In air above, on land, or in the sea,<BR>
O World, undone and lost that loseth thee!<BR>
For love we briefly come, and pass away<BR>
For other men and maids; thus bring the day<BR>
Of love continuous through this glorious life.<BR>
Oh, hurl away those weapons fierce of strife!<BR>
We here a moment, point of time but live,<BR>
Too short is life for throbbing hearts to grieve.<BR>
Thrice holy is that form that love hath kissed,<BR>
And happy is that man with heart thus blessed.<BR>
Oh, let not curses fall upon that head<BR>
Whom love hath cradled on the welcome bed<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

</P>
<P><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></P>
<P>Of bliss, the bosom of our fairest god,<BR>
Or hand of love e'er grasp the venging rod.</P>
<P>Oh, come, dear Zir-ri,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> tune your lyres and lutes,<BR>
And sing of love with chastest, sweetest notes,<BR>
Of Accad's goddess Ishtar, Queen of Love,<BR>
And Izdubar, with softest measure move;<BR>
Great Samas'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> son, of him dear Zir-ri sing!<BR>
Of him whom goddess Ishtar warmly wooed,<BR>
Of him whose breast with virtue was imbued.<BR>
He as a giant towered, lofty grown,<BR>
As Babil's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> great <I>pa-te-si</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> was he known,<BR>
His arm&egrave;d fleet commanded on the seas<BR>
And erstwhile travelled on the foreign leas;<BR>
His mother Ellat-gula&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">1a</FONT></A> on the throne<BR>
From Erech all Kardunia&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> ruled alone.</P>
