<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">EXPEDITION AGAINST KHUMBABA, AND BATTLE IN THE BLACK FOREST</H3>
<P>At early dawn the shining ranks are massed,<BR>
And Erech echoes with the trumpet's blast;<BR>
The chosen men of Erech are in line,<BR>
And Ishtar in her car above doth shine.<BR>
The blazing standards high with shouts are raised,<BR>
As Samas' car above grand Sumir blazed.<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></P>
<P>The march they sound at Izdubar's command,<BR>
And thus they start for King Khumbaba's land;<BR>
The gods in bright array above them shine,<BR>
By Ishtar led, with Samas, moon-god Sin,<BR>
On either sidle with Merodac and Bel,<BR>
And Ninip, Nergal, Nusku with his spell,<BR>
The sixty gods on chargers of the skies,<BR>
And Ishtar's chariot before them flies.</P>
<P>Across Cazina's desert far have come,<BR>
The armies now have neared Khumbaba's home;<BR>
Beneath grand forests of tall cedar, pine,<BR>
And the dark shades near Khar-sak's brow divine.<BR>
A brazen gate before them high appeared,<BR>
And massive walls which their great foe had reared;<BR>
The mighty gates on heavy pivots hung,<BR>
They broke, and on their brazen hinges swung<BR>
With clanging roars against the solid wall,<BR>
And sent through all the wilds a clarion call.<BR>
Within his halls Khumbaba is enthroned,<BR>
In grand Tul-Khumba's walls by forests zoned<BR>
With her bright palaces and templed shrines,<BR>
The sanctuaries of the gods, where pines<BR>
Sigh on the wafting winds their rich perfumes;<BR>
Where Elam's god with sullen thunder dooms<BR>
From Kharsak's brow the wailing nation's round,<BR>
And Elam's; hosts obey the awful sound.<BR>
The giant here his castled city old<BR>
Had strengthened, wrung his tributes, silver, gold;<BR>
His palace ceiling with pure silver shines,<BR>
And on his throne of gold from Magan's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> mines<BR>
In all his pride the conqueror exults,<BR>
With wealth has filled his massive iron vaults.<BR>
Oft from his marble towers the plains surveys,<BR>
And sees his foes' most ancient cities blaze;<BR>
While his <I>pa-te-si</I> lead his allied hosts,<BR>
And o'er his famous victories he boasts.</P>
<P>With Rimsin he allied when Erech fell,<BR>
The King of Sarsa, whose great citadel<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></P>
<P>Was stormed by Nammurabi the great Sar,<BR>
Ninrad of Erech, our King Izdubar.<BR>
Khumbaba's ally was by him o'erthrown,<BR>
And thus appeared to take Khumbaba's throne.<BR>
And now within his palace came a sound<BR>
That roared through all the forest, shook the ground:<BR>
"Our foes! our foes! the gate! hear how it rings!"<BR>
And from his throne the giant furious springs:<BR>
"Ho! vassals! sound the trump! 'tis Izdubar,<BR>
To arms! our foes are on us from afar!"<BR>
His weapons seizes, drives his men in fear<BR>
Before him with his massive sword and spear,<BR>
And as a tempest from his lips he pours<BR>
His orders, while his warrior steed he spurs<BR>
Along his serried lines of bristling spears;<BR>
Among the pines the army disappears.</P>
<P>The men of Accad now in squadrons form,<BR>
Arrayed to take Khumbaba's towers by storm;<BR>
While Izdubar the forest black surveyed<BR>
Of pines and cedars thickly grown, and made<BR>
A reconnoitre of his hidden foe.<BR>
The road was straight; afar the turrets glow<BR>
With Samas' light, and all the gods arrayed,<BR>
Ride o'er the pines and flash through their dark shade.<BR>
The glorious blaze of Accad's glistening spears<BR>
One <I>kaspu</I> pass, and now the foe appears;<BR>
Beneath the deepest shadows of the pines<BR>
Khumbaba stands with solid battle lines<BR>
Before the marching host of Izdubar.<BR>
The forest echoes with the shouts of war,<BR>
As they sweep on with ringing battle cries,<BR>
Now loudly echoed from the woods and skies:<BR>
"<I>Kar-ro</I>! <I>kar-ra</I>!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> we follow Izdubar!"<BR>
And through the forests fly the bolts of war.</P>
<P>The foe beheld the gods in wrath above<BR>
And Accad's charging lines toward them move,<BR>
But bravely stand to meet the onset fierce,<BR>
Their mailed armor, shields, no arrows pierce.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A></P>
<P>And now in direst conflict meet the mass,<BR>
And furious still meets ringing bronze and brass,<BR>
Khumbaba on his mighty steed of war,<BR>
Above the ranks towers high a giant Sar,<BR>
And sweeps the men of Accad with his blade,<BR>
Till to his breast a heap of corpses made,<BR>
And fiercely urged his men to fight, to die;<BR>
And Izdubar, with helmet towering high,<BR>
His men has led with fury on the foe,<BR>
And massacres each man with one fell blow,<BR>
Who dares to stand in front with sword or spear,<BR>
And fighting by him stands his valiant seer.<BR>
The gods now rushing from the gleaming sky,<BR>
With blazing weapons carry victory;<BR>
The foe no longer stand before the sight,<BR>
And shouting fly away in wild affright.<BR>
Their monarch turned and slowly rode away;<BR>
And Accad's hosts his men pursue and slay,<BR>
Until the forest deep resounds with cries.<BR>
To save himself each man in terror flies.</P>
