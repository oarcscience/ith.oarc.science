<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">EXPEDITION OF ZAIDU IN SEARCH OF THE SEER</H3>
<P>Prince Zaidu on his steed now hastes away,<BR>
Upon the plains he travelled all that day;<BR>
Next morn the Za-Gabri he slow ascends,<BR>
Along the mountain sides the horseman wends<BR>
Beneath the Eri-ni,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and cliffs, and sees<BR>
The plains and mountains o'er the misty trees<BR>
From the wild summit, and old Khar-sak glow<BR>
Above them all with its twin crests of snow.<BR>
He plunges in the wild to seek the cave;<BR>
Three days unceasing sought young Zaidu brave,<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P><A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A></P>
<P>And now at last within the glen he rode,<BR>
And near approached Heabani's wild abode.<BR>
At last he sees the seer before his home,<BR>
And with his monster&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> now toward him come,<BR>
That walked subdued beside the hermit seer,<BR>
Thus they upon the rocks above appear.</P>
<P>"Why art thou here in warrior's array?<BR>
The hermit cries. "I know thee not! away!"</P>
<P>"O holy seer, 'tis Zaidu, from our Sar!<BR>
The king of Erech, chieftain Izdubar."</P>
<P>"What seekest thou within my mountain lair?"<BR>
Heabani angry cried. "What brings thee here?"</P>
<P>"For thee! if true Heabani is thy name;<BR>
I seek the hermit seer of wondrous fame.<BR>
My king doth offer thee rich gifts of state,<BR>
And sent me to thee here to make thee great.<BR>
No empty honors do I seek, which void<BR>
Of all true happiness, all men have cloyed.<BR>
Return then to thy haunts of pleasure, pain,<BR>
For thy king's embassy is all in vain."<BR>
The seer returns within his lonely cave<BR>
And leaves the prince alone the beast to brave.<BR>
At last it slinks away within the gloom;<BR>
No more from their wild home doth either come,<BR>
Three days Prince Zaidu watches the dark lair,<BR>
But now his courage turns to blank despair:<BR>
The seer hath changed his mind since Samas sought<BR>
To urge him forth to leave his lonely lot.<BR>
The prince the mountain precipice now climbs,<BR>
And peers within while clinging to the limbs<BR>
Of stunted oaks, and views the mountain lair;<BR>
But all in vain his calls ring on the air.<BR>
Then mounting wearily his steed he turns<BR>
Away, and unsuccessful thus returns.</P>
