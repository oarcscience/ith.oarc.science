<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE KING GOES FROM ISHTAR'S TEMPLE TO THE TEMPLE OF SAMAS</H3>
<P>He rose and raised the pendant mystic charms<BR>
And kissed them, and the jewels of her arms<BR>
And ornaments upon her breast divine,<BR>
And then her crown with jewels iridine<BR>
He placed upon his brow, and it returned;<BR>
And from the shrine in reverence he turned;<BR>
To Samas' temple all the chiefs of war<BR>
And seers, <I>pa-te-si</I>, go with Izdubar.</P>
<P>Before the fire he stands where holy burns<BR>
The flames of Samas. In a vase he turns<BR>
The crimson wine, to Samas, God, he pours<BR>
Libation, and his favor thus implores:</P>
<P>O Samas, why hast thou established, raised<BR>
Me in thy heart?--protected? Men have praised<BR>
Thee, Holy One! my expedition bless<BR>
In thine own will, O God, I acquiesce.<BR>
I go, O Samas, on a path afar,<BR>
Against Khumbaba I declare this war;<BR>
The battle's issue thou alone dost know,<BR>
Or if success attends me where I go.<BR>
The way is long, O may thy son return<BR>
From the vast pine-tree forest, I would earn<BR>
For Erech glory and renown! Destroy<BR>
Khumbaba and his towers! he doth annoy<BR>
All nations, and is evil to thy sight.<BR>
To-morrow I will go, O send thy Light<BR>
Upon my standards, and dark Nina-zu<BR>
Keep thou away, that I may wary view<BR>
Mine enemies, and fix for me the hour<BR>
When I shall strike and crush Khumbaba's power.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>To all the gods I humbly pray<BR>
To Izdubar propitious be!</P></DIR>

Ana Sar bel-ni-ya lik-ru-bu</I>!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And thus the Oracle with sweetest voice<BR>
To him replied, and made his heart rejoice:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fear not, O Izdubar,<BR>
For I am Bel, thy strength in war.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
A heart of strength give I to thee!<BR>
To trust, we can but faithful be!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As thou hast shown to me.<BR>
The sixty gods, our strongest ones,<BR>
Will guide thy path where'er it runs;<BR>
The moon-god on thy right shall ride,<BR>
And Samas on thy left shall guide.<BR>
The sixty gods thy will commands<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To crush Khumbaba's bands.<BR>
In man alone, do not confide,<BR>
Thine eyes turn to the gods,<BR>
Who rule from their abodes,<BR>
And trust in Heaven where powers abide!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>With joyous heart the Sar comes from the shrine<BR>
To bathe his brow in Samas' rays divine;<BR>
Upon the pyramid he stands and views<BR>
The scene below with its bright varied hues.<BR>
A peerless pile the temple grandly shone<BR>
With marble, gold, and silver in the sun;<BR>
In seven stages rose above the walls,<BR>
With archways vast and polished pillared halls.<BR>
A marble portico surrounds the mass<BR>
With sculptured columns, banisters of brass,<BR>
And winding stairways round the stages' side,<BR>
Grand temples piled on temples upward glide,<BR>
A mass of colors like the rainbow hues,<BR>
Thus proudly rise from breezy avenues.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A></P>
<P>The brazen gates lead to the temple's side,<BR>
The stairs ascend and up the stages glide.<BR>
The basement painted of the darkest blue<BR>
Is passed by steps ascending till we view<BR>
From them the second stage of orange hue<BR>
And crimson third! from thence a glorious view--<BR>
A thousand turrets far beneath, is spread<BR>
O'er lofty walls, and fields, and grassy mead;<BR>
The golden harvests sweep away in sight<BR>
And orchards, vineyards, on the left and right;<BR>
Euphrates' stream as a broad silver band<BR>
Sweeps grandly through the glowing golden land,<BR>
Till like a thread of silver still in sight<BR>
It meets the Tigris gleaming in the light<BR>
That spreads along the glorious bending skies,<BR>
The brightest vault of all the emperies.</P>
<P>Now rested from the cushioned seats we rise<BR>
And to the stairway turn again our eyes;<BR>
The fourth stage plated o'er with beaten gold<BR>
We pass, and topaz fifth till we behold<BR>
The sixth of azure blue; to seventh glide,<BR>
That glows with silvery summit where reside<BR>
The gods, within a shrine of silvery sheen<BR>
Which brightly glows, and from afar is seen.<BR>
Without the temple, burnished silver shines;<BR>
Within, pure gold and gems in rare designs.</P>
