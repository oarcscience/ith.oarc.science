<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>"O Mam-mitu, thou god of fate and death!<BR>
Thou spirit of fierce hate and parting breath,<BR>
Thou banisher of joy! O ghastly Law,<BR>
That gathers countless forces in thy maw!<BR>
A phantom! curse! and oft a blessing, joy!<BR>
All Heaven and earth thy hands shall e'er employ.<BR>
With blessings come, or curses to us bring,<BR>
The god who fails not with her hovering wing;<BR>
Nor god, nor man thy coming e'er may ken,<BR>
O mystery! thy ways none can explain."</P>
<P>If thou must come in earthquakes, fire, and flood,<BR>
Or pestilence and eftsoons cry for blood,<BR>
Thou comest oft with voice of sweetest love,<BR>
Our dearest, fondest passions, hopes, to move;<BR>
And men have worshipped thee in every form,<BR>
In fear have praised thee, sought thy feet to charm.<BR>
We reek not if you blessings, curses bring,<BR>
For men oft change thy noiseless, ghoulish wing.<BR>
And yet, thou comest, goddess Mam-mitu,<BR>
To bring with thee the feet of Nin-a-zu,<BR>
Two sister ghouls, remorseless, tearless, wan,<BR>
We fear ye not; ye <I>bu'i-du</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> begone!</P>
<P>Sweet life renews itself in holy love,<BR>
Your victory is naught! Ye vainly rove<BR>
Across our pathway with yours forms inane,<BR>
For somewhere, though we die, we live again.<BR>
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> The soul departed shall in glory shine,<BR>
As burnished gold its form shall glow divine,<BR>
And Samas there shall grant to us new life;<BR>
And Merodac, the eldest son, all strife<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A></P>
<P>Shall end in peace in yonder Blest Abode,<BR>
Where happiness doth crown our glorious God.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> The sacred waters there shall ever flow,<BR>
To Anat's arms shall all the righteous go;<BR>
The queen of Anu, Heaven's king, our hands<BR>
Outstretched will clasp, and through the glorious lands<BR>
Will lead us to the place of sweet delights;<BR>
The land that glows on yonder bless&egrave;d heights<BR>
Where milk and honey from bright fountains flow.<BR>
And nectar to our lips, all sorrows, woe,<BR>
Shall end in happiness beside the Stream<BR>
Of Life, and joy for us shall ever gleam;<BR>
Our hearts with thankfulness shall sweetly sing<BR>
And grander blissfulness each day will bring.</P>
<P>And if we do not reach that spirit realm,<BR>
Where bodyless each soul may ages whelm<BR>
With joy unutterable; still we live,<BR>
With bodies knew upon dear Earth, and give<BR>
Our newer life to children with our blood.<BR>
Or if these blessings we should miss; in wood,<BR>
Or glen, or garden, field, or emerald seas,<BR>
Our forms shall spring again; in such as these<BR>
We see around us throbbing with sweet life,<BR>
In trees or flowerets.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This needs no belief<BR>
On which to base the fabric of a dream,<BR>
For Earth her children from death doth redeem,<BR>
And each contributes to continuous bloom;<BR>
So go your way! ye sisters, to your gloom!</P>
<P>Far on their road have come the king of fame<BR>
And seer, within the land of Mas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> they came,<BR>
Nor knew that Fate was hovering o'er their way,<BR>
In gentle converse they have passed the day.<BR>
Some twenty <I>kaspu</I> o'er the hills and plain,<BR>
They a wild forest in the mountain gain,<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A></P>
<P>In a deep gorge they rode through thickets wild,<BR>
Beneath the pines; now to a pass they filed,<BR>
And lo! two dragons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> near a cave contend<BR>
Their path! with backs upreared their coils unbend,<BR>
Extend their ravenous jaws with a loud roar<BR>
That harshly comes from mouths of clotted gore.</P>
<P>The sky o'erhead with lowering clouds is cast,<BR>
Which Anu in his rage above them massed.<BR>
Dark tempests fly above from Rimmon's breath,<BR>
Who hovers o'er them with the gods of death;<BR>
The wicked seven winds howl wildly round,<BR>
And crashing cedars falling shake the ground.<BR>
Now Tsil-lattu her black wings spreads o'er all,<BR>
Dark shrouding all the forest with her pall,<BR>
And from his steed for safety each dismounts,<BR>
And o'er their heads now break the ebon founts.<BR>
But hark! what is that dreadful roaring noise?<BR>
The dragons come! Their flaming crests they poise<BR>
Above, and nearer blaze their eyes of fire,<BR>
And see! upon them rush the monsters dire.</P>
<P>The largest springs upon the giant Sar,<BR>
Who parrying with the sword he used in war,<BR>
With many wounds it pierces, drives it back;<BR>
Again it comes, renews its fierce attack,<BR>
With fangs outspread its victims to devour,<BR>
High o'er the monarch's head its crest doth tower,<BR>
Its fiery breath upon his helm doth glow.</P>
<P>Exposed its breast! he strikes! his blade drives through<BR>
Its vitals! Dying now it shakes the ground,<BR>
And furious lashes all the forest round.<BR>
But hark! what is that awful lingering shriek<BR>
And cries of woe, that on his ears wild break?<BR>
A blinding flash, see! all the land reveals,<BR>
With dreadful roars, and darkness quick conceals<BR>
The fearful sight, to ever after come<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A></P>
<P>Before his eyes, wherever he may roam.<BR>
The King, alas! too late Heabani drags<BR>
From the beast's fangs, that dies beneath the crags<BR>
O'erhanging near the cave. And now a din<BR>
Loud comes from <I>dalkhi</I> that around them spin<BR>
In fierce delight, while hellish voices rise<BR>
In harsh and awful mockery; the cries<BR>
Of agony return with taunting groans,<BR>
And mock with their fell hate those piteous moans.</P>
<P>Amazed stands Izdubar above his seer,<BR>
Nor hears the screams, nor the fierce <I>dalkhi's</I> jeer;<BR>
Beneath the flashing lightnings he soon found<BR>
The cave, and lays the seer upon the ground.<BR>
His breaking heart now cries in agony,<BR>
"Heabani! O my seer, thou must not die!<BR>
Alas! dread Mam-mitu hath led us here,<BR>
Awake for me! arouse! my noble seer!<BR>
I would to gods of Erech I had died<BR>
For thee! my seer! my strength! my kingdom's pride!"</P>
<P>The seer at last revives and turns his face<BR>
With love that death touched not, his hand doth place<BR>
With friendly clasp in that of his dear king,<BR>
And says:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grieve not, belov&egrave;d friend, this thing<BR>
Called death at last must come, why should we fear?<BR>
'Tis Hades' mist that opens for thy seer!<BR>
The gods us brought, nor asked consent, and life<BR>
They give and take away from all this strife<BR>
That must be here, my life I end on earth;<BR>
Both joy and sorrow I have seen from birth;<BR>
To Hades' awful land, whence none return,<BR>
Heabani's face in sorrow now must turn.<BR>
My love for thee, mine only pang reveals,<BR>
For this alone I grieve."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teardrop steals<BR>
Across his features, shining 'neath the light<BR>
The King has lit to make the cavern bright.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A></P>
<P>"But oh, friend Izdubar, my King, when I<BR>
From this dear earth to waiting Hades fly,<BR>
Grieve not; and when to Erech you return,<BR>
Thou shalt in glory reign, and Zaidu learn<BR>
As thy companion all that thine own heart<BR>
Desires, thy throne thou wilt to him impart.<BR>
The female, Samkha, whom he brought to me<BR>
Is false, in league with thine own enemy.<BR>
And she will cause thee mischief, seek to drive<BR>
Thee from thy throne; but do not let her live<BR>
Within the walls of Erech, for the gods<BR>
Have not been worshipped in their high abodes.<BR>
When thou returnest, to the temple go,<BR>
And pray the gods to turn from thee the blow<BR>
Of Anu's fury, the strong god, who reigns<BR>
Above, and sent these woes upon the plains.<BR>
His anger raised against thee, even thee,<BR>
Must be allayed, or thy goods thou shalt see,<BR>
And kingdom, all destroyed by his dread power.<BR>
But Khasisadra will to thee give more<BR>
Advice when thou shalt meet the ancient seer,<BR>
For from thy side must I soon disappear."<BR>
The seer now ceased, and on his couch asleep<BR>
Spoke not, and Izdubar alone doth weep.</P>
<P>And thus twelve days were past, and now the seer<BR>
Of the great change he saw was drawing near<BR>
Informed his King, who read to him the prayers,<BR>
And for the end each friendly act prepares,<BR>
Then said: "O my Heabani, dearest friend,<BR>
I would that I thy body could defend<BR>
From thy fierce foe that brings the end to thee.<BR>
My friend in battle I may never see<BR>
Again, when thou didst nobly stand beside<BR>
Me; with my seer and friend I then defied<BR>
All foes; and must thou leave thy friend, my seer?<BR>
"Alas! my King, I soon shall leave thee here."</P>
