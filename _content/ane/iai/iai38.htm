<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE KING AND SEER CONVERSING ON THEIR WAY TO KHASISADRA--INTERPRETATION OF THE KING'S DREAM IN THE PALACE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FESTIVAL</H3>
<P>"The dream, my seer, which I beheld last night<BR>
Within our tent, may bring to us delight.<BR>
I saw a mountain summit flash with fire,<BR>
That like a royal robe or god's attire<BR>
Illumined all its sides. The omen might<BR>
Some joy us bring, for it was shining bright."<BR>
And thus the Sar revealed to him his dream.</P>
<P>Heabani said, "My friend, though it did seem<BR>
Propitious, yet, deceptive was it all,<BR>
And came in memory of Elam's fall.<BR>
The mountain burning was Khumbaba's halls<BR>
We fired, when all his soldiers from the walls<BR>
Had fled;--the <I>ni-takh-garri</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--on that morn,<BR>
Of such deceptive dreams, I would thee warn!"</P>
<P>Some twenty <I>kaspu</I> they have passed this day,<BR>
At thirty <I>kaspu</I> they dismount to pray<BR>
And raise an altar, Samas to beseech<BR>
That they their journey's end may safely reach.<BR>
The tent now raised, their evening meal prepare<BR>
Beneath the forest in the open air;<BR>
And Izdubar brought from the tent the dream<BR>
He dreamed the festal night when Ishtar came<BR>
To him;--he reads it from a written scroll:<BR>
"Upon my sight a vision thus did fall:<BR>
I saw two men that night beside a god;<BR>
One man a turban wore, and fearless trod.<BR>
The god reached forth his hand and struck him down<BR>
Like mountains hurled on fields of corn, thus prone</P>

<P><A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A></P>
<P>He lay; and Izdubar then saw the god<BR>
Was Anatu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who struck him to the sod.<BR>
The troubler of all men, Samu's fierce queen,<BR>
Thus struck the turbaned man upon the plain.<BR>
He ceased his struggling, to his friend thus said:<BR>
'My friend, thou askest not why I am laid<BR>
Here naked, nor my low condition heed.<BR>
Accurs&egrave;d thus I lie upon the mead;<BR>
The god has crushed me, burned my limbs with fire.'</P>
<P>The vision from mine eyes did then expire.<BR>
A third dream came to me, which I yet fear,<BR>
The first beyond my sight doth disappear.<BR>
A fire-god thundering o'er the earth doth ride;<BR>
The door of darkness burning flew aside;<BR>
Like a fierce stream of lightning, blazing fire,<BR>
Beside me roared the god with fury dire,<BR>
And hurled wide death on earth on every side;<BR>
And quickly from my sight it thus did glide,<BR>
And in its track I saw a palm-tree green<BR>
Upon a waste, naught else by me was seen."</P>
<P>Heabani pondering, thus explained the dream:<BR>
"My friend, the god was Samas, who doth gleam<BR>
With his bright glory, power, our God and Lord,<BR>
Our great Creator King, whose thunders roared<BR>
By thee, as through yon sky he takes his way;<BR>
For his great favor we should ever pray.<BR>
The man thou sawest lying on the plain<BR>
Was thee, O King,--to fight such power is vain.<BR>
Thus Anatu will strike thee with disease,<BR>
Unless thou soon her anger shalt appease;<BR>
And if thou warrest with such foes divine,<BR>
The fires of death shall o'er thy kingdom shine.<BR>
The palm-tree green upon the desert left<BR>
Doth show that we of hope are not bereft;<BR>
The gods for us their shares have surely weft,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
One shall be taken, and the other left."</P>
