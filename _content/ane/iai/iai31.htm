<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ISHTAR WEAVES A MYSTIC SPELL OVER THE KING AND SEER, AND VANISHES--THE SEER ADVISES THE KING TO SEEK THE AID OF THE IMMORTAL SEER WHO ESCAPES FROM THE FLOOD.</H3>
<P>The goddess Ishtar wrapped in darkness waits<BR>
Until the goddess Tsil-at-tu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the gates<BR>
Of sleep has closed upon the darkened plain;<BR>
Then lightly to the palace flies the Queen.<BR>
O'er the King's couch she weaves an awful dream,<BR>
While her bright eyes upon him furious gleam.<BR>
Then o'er Heabani's couch a moment stands,<BR>
And Heaven's curtains pulls aside with hands<BR>
Of mystic power, and he a vision sees--<BR>
The gods in council;--vanishing, she flees<BR>
Without the palace like a gleam of light,<BR>
And wakes the guard around in wild affright.</P>
<P>Next day the seer reveals to Izdubar<BR>
How all the gods a council held of war,<BR>
And gave to Anu power to punish them<BR>
For thus defying Ishtar's godly claim;<BR>
And thus the seer gave him his counsel, well<BR>
Considered, how to meet their plottings fell:</P>
<P>"To Khasisadra go, who from the flood<BR>
Escaped when o'er the earth the waters stood<BR>
Above mankind, and covered all the ground;<BR>
He at the river's mouth may yet be found.<BR>
For his great aid, we now the seer must seek,<BR>
For Anu's fury will upon us break.<BR>
Immortal lives the seer beside the sea;<BR>
Through Hades pass, and soon the seer mayst see."</P>
<P>Thus Izdubar replied, and him embraced:<BR>
With thee, Heabani, I my throne have graced;</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A></P>
<P>With thee I go, mine own companion dear,<BR>
And on the road each other we may cheer."<BR>
"The way is long, my King, and if I live,<BR>
With thee I go, but oh, thou must not grieve,<BR>
For perils great attend the way, and old<BR>
Am I: the suppleness of youth to hold<BR>
My strength I need, but it alas! is gone.<BR>
My heart is ready, but I fear, my son,<BR>
These crippled limbs which Anu's bull hath left<BR>
Of my strong vigor have thy seer bereft.<BR>
Too weak am I, for that long journey hard<BR>
To undertake; my Presence would retard<BR>
Thee,--with these wounds; nor strength have I to last<BR>
To guard my body in the mountain fast.<BR>
But if thou wilt, my strength is thine, my King!<BR>
To do thy will my ag&egrave;d form shall spring<BR>
With gladness, and all perils I'll defy;<BR>
If need be, for thee will thy servant die."</P>
<P>"Heabani, noble one! my chosen seer!<BR>
I love thee, bid thy loyal heart good cheer.<BR>
He steeds may take to ride through all the way,<BR>
With easy journeys on the road each day;<BR>
From perils I will guard thee, and defend;<BR>
To-morrow then we on our way will wend."</P>
<P>Equipped for the long journey they appear<BR>
Next morn and leave, while Erech's people cheer<BR>
Them on their way across the glowing plain,<BR>
To perils dire they go--distress and pain.</P>
