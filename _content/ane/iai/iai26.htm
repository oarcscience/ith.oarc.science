<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CORONATION OF IZDUBAR AS KING OF THE FOUR RACES, AND APPEARANCE OF ISHTAR IN HIS ROYAL PRESENCE, WHO SUES FOR HIS HAND</H3>
<P>To Erech's palaces returns the Sar,<BR>
Rich laden with Khumbaba's spoils of war.<BR>
The land of Ur with grandest glories shines--<BR>
And gleams with palaces and towers and shrines.<BR>
The plain with temples, cities, walls is filled,<BR>
And wide canals, and yellow harvests tilled.<BR>
Grand Erech to the sight presents no walls<BR>
In ruins laid, but glows with turrets, halls;<BR>
With splendor proudly shines across the plain.<BR>
And now with joy he meets his courtly train;<BR>
Their shouts of welcome rend the gleaming skies,<BR>
And happiness beams from his people's eyes.<BR>
Within the walls he rides with kingly pride,<BR>
And all his chiefs and seers beside him ride;<BR>
To his grand palace they now lead the way,<BR>
To crown him king of Subartu this day.</P>
<P>Arrayed in splendor on his throne, the Sar<BR>
Before him eyes the Kassite spoils of war,<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A></P>
<P>Khumbaba's crown of gold, and blazing gems,<BR>
The richest of the Kassite diadems,<BR>
The royal sceptre of all Subartu,<BR>
Of Larsa, Ur, Kardunia and Sutu<BR>
The Sar upon his brow the crown now bound,<BR>
Receives the sceptre while his courts resound<BR>
With shouts for Sar-dan-nu of Subartu,<BR>
The Sar of Kip-rat arba&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and Sutu,<BR>
Of Sumir, Accad, Nipur, Bar-ili,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
And Erech, Larsa, Mairu, and Kus-si,<BR>
Of Mal-al-nak, Kitu;--the sky resounds--<BR>
For Iz-zu-bar-ili,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> from earth rebounds;<BR>
For Nam-mu-rabi, Bar-bels king of fire.<BR>
What king to his great glory can aspire?</P>
<P>The Zig-gur-at-u to the skies<BR>
His hands have built, where holy fires<BR>
To Samas burn; its flame ne'er dies,<BR>
To holiness lead man's desires.<BR>
He opens wide the fiery gates<BR>
Of all the gods at Dintir old,<BR>
Ka-ding-ir-a.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> This day completes<BR>
His grandeur--may it far be told<BR>
Of our great Sar whose godly gate<BR>
Wide opens Heaven's joy for man,<BR>
Of Iz-zu-bar-ili the great,<BR>
Who rules from Khar-sak to the main.<BR>
Within the entrance to the royal rooms,<BR>
Queen Ishtar with her train in splendor comes,<BR>
Her radiant form with glistening gems ablaze,<BR>
And shining crescent with its glorious rays,<BR>
Glow with bright Heaven's unremitting flame;<BR>
Thus came the Queen of Love of godly fame.<BR>
The richest robe of gods her form enshrines,<BR>
With every charm of Heaven and earth she shines;<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P>of their wide splendors robs the farthest skies,<BR>
That she with love her hero may surprise.<BR>
Her train she robes with liveries of Heaven,<BR>
To her are all the dazzling splendors given.</P>
<P>The glittering court is filled with chiefs and seers,<BR>
When Ishtar at the entrance now appears,<BR>
The Ner-kalli,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> her heralds at the door,<BR>
As some grand sovereign from a foreign shore,<BR>
The goddess proudly enters with her train,<BR>
The spirits of the earth, and tossing main,<BR>
From mountains, rivers, woods, and running streams;<BR>
And every spirit where the sunlight gleams,<BR>
Now fill the courts and palaces and halls,<BR>
And thousands glowing bright surround the walls;<BR>
Each wafting wind brings I-gi-gi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> that soar<BR>
Above An-un-na-ci from every shore,<BR>
And herald Ishtar's presence, Queen of Love,<BR>
With music through the halls, around, above.<BR>
From lyres and lutes their softest wooings bring,<BR>
As Ishtar bows before her lover king.<BR>
A halo from the goddess fills the halls,<BR>
And shines upon the dazzling jewelled walls.<BR>
The Sar and seers in wonder were amazed<BR>
At the sweet strains, and glorious light that blazed;<BR>
Transfixed in silence stood, as she now spoke,<BR>
And sweeter music through the palace woke.<BR>
Like fragrant zephyrs, warbling from retreats<BR>
Of gardens of the gods, she thus entreats<BR>
From Izdubar her welcome, or a glance<BR>
Of love; and she the Sar would thus entrance:</P>
<P>"Thy wisdom, Sar, surpasses all mankind,<BR>
In thee, O king! no blemish do I find.<BR>
The Queen of Heaven favor seeks from thee,<BR>
I come with love, and prostrate bend the knee.<BR>
My follies past, I hope thou wilt forgive,<BR>
Alone I love thee, with thee move and live;<BR>
My heart's affections to thee, me have led,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A></P>
<P>To woo thee to thine Ishtar's marriage bed.<BR>
O kiss me, my beloved! I adore<BR>
Thee! Hear me! I renounce the godly shore<BR>
With all its hollow splendor where as queen<BR>
I o'er the heavenly hosts, unrivaled reign<BR>
In grandest glory on my shining throne;<BR>
And yet for thee my heart here pines alone,<BR>
I cannot live without my Izdubar!<BR>
My husband's love and simple word shall far<BR>
Surpass the godly bond. O let me, king,<BR>
Rest on thy breast, and happiness will cling<BR>
To all the blissful days which shall be thine.<BR>
With glory of the skies, my love shall shine.<BR>
O Izdubar, my king! this love below<BR>
Is grander here than mortals e'er can know,<BR>
For this I leave my throne in yonder skies,<BR>
And at the feet of love thy queen now lies.<BR>
Oh, let me taste with thee the sweets of love,<BR>
And I my love for thee will grandly prove,<BR>
And thou shalt ride upon a diamond car,<BR>
Lined with pure gold; and jeweled horns of war<BR>
Shall stud it round like rays of Samas' fire.<BR>
Rich gifts whate'er my lover shall desire,<BR>
Thy word shall bring to thee, my Sar-dan-nu!<BR>
Lo! all the wealth that gods above can view,<BR>
I bring to thee with its exhaustless store.<BR>
Oh, come my love! within the halls, where more<BR>
Than I have named is found, all, all is thine;<BR>
Oh, come with me within our halls divine!<BR>
Amid the fragrant odors of the pines,<BR>
And all shrubs and flowers, vines,<BR>
Euphrates' <I>zir-ri</I> there shall sing for thee,<BR>
And dance around thy feet with <I>zi-mu-ri</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A><BR>
And kings and lords and princes I will bring<BR>
To bow to thee, beloved, glorious king!<BR>
With tribute from the mountains and the plains,<BR>
As offerings to thee. Thy flocks shall twins<BR>
Bring forth; and herds of fattened, lowing kine<BR>
Shall fast increase upon the plains divine.<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></P>
<P>Thy warrior steeds shall prance with flowing manes,<BR>
Resistless with thy chariot on the plain.<BR>
Vast spoils, thy beasts of burden far shall bear,<BR>
Unrivaled then shall be my king of war;<BR>
And victory o'er all, thine eyes shall view,<BR>
And loud acclaims shall rend the bright Samu."</P>
