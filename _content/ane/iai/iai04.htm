<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE RESCUE OF ERECH BY IZDUBAR</H3>
<P>Heabani, weary, eyes his native land,<BR>
And on his harp now lays his trembling hand;<BR>
The song has ended in a joyous lay,<BR>
And yet, alas! his hands but sadly play:<BR>
Unused to hope, the strings refuse their aid<BR>
To tune in sympathy, and heartless played.<BR>
Again the minstrel bows his head in woe,<BR>
And the hot tear-drops from his eyelids flow,<BR>
And chanting now a mournful melody,<BR>
O'er Erech's fall, thus sang an elegy:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>"How long, O Ishtar, will thy face be turned,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While Erech desolate doth cry to thee?<BR>
Thy towers magnificent, oh, hast thou spurned?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her blood like water in Ul-bar,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> oh, see!<BR>
The seat of thine own oracle behold!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire hath ravaged all thy cities grand,<BR>
And like the showers of Heaven them all doth fold.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O Ishtar! broken-hearted do I stand!<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P></DIR>

<DIR>

<P>Oh, crush our enemies as yonder reed!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For hopeless, lifeless, kneels thy bard to thee,<BR>
And, oh! I would exalt thee in my need,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From thy resentment, anger, oh, us free!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>With eyes bedimmed with tears, he careful scans<BR>
The plain, "Perhaps the dust of caravans<BR>
It is! But no!! I see long lines of spears!<BR>
A warrior from the lifting cloud appears,<BR>
And chariots arrayed upon the plain!<BR>
And is the glorious omen not in vain?<BR>
What! no?" He rubs his eyes in wild surprise,<BR>
And drinks the vision while he loudly cries:<BR>
"Oh, joy! our standards flashing from afar!<BR>
He comes! he comes! our hero Izdubar!"<BR>
He grasps his harp inspired, again to wake<BR>
In song-the cry of battle now doth break.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Nin-a-rad,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> servant of our great Nin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall lead our hosts to victory!<BR>
God of the chase and war, o'er him, oh, shine!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Let Elam fall! the cause of Accad's woes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenge of Erech, be the cry!<BR>
This land our father's blessed, our king they chose,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!<BR>
Our holy fathers sleep upon this plain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We conquer, or we here will die;<BR>
For victory, then raise the cry, ye men!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The minstrel ceases, lifts his hands on high,<BR>
And still we hear his joyful waning cry:<BR>
Now echoed by yon hosts along the sky,<BR>
"He comes! Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!<BR>
Great Accad's hosts arrayed with spears and shields<BR>
Are coming! see them flashing o'er the fields!<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P>And he! bright flashing as the god's attire,<BR>
Doth lead in burnished gold, our king of fire.<BR>
His armor shines through yonder wood and fen,<BR>
That tremble 'neath the tread of arm&egrave;d men.<BR>
See! from his jewelled breastplate, helmet, fly<BR>
The rays like Samas from the cloudless sky!<BR>
How martially he rides his sable steed,<BR>
That proudly treads and lifts his noble head,<BR>
While eagerly he gallops down the line,<BR>
And bears his princely load with porte divine;<BR>
And now, along the plains there sounds afar<BR>
The piercing bugle-note of Izdubar;<BR>
For Erech's walls and turrets are in view,<BR>
And high the standards rise of varied hue.<BR>
The army halts; the twanging bows are strung;<BR>
And from their chariots the chieftains sprung.<BR>
The wheeling lines move at each chief's command,<BR>
With chariots in front;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On either hand<BR>
Extend the lines of spears and cavalry,<BR>
A wing&egrave;d storm-cloud waiting for its prey:<BR>
And see! while Accad's army ready waits,<BR>
The enemy are swarming from the gates.<BR>
The charge, from either host, the trumpets sound,<BR>
And bristling chariots from each army bound:<BR>
A cloud of arrows flies from Accad's bows<BR>
That hides the sun, and falls among their foes.<BR>
Now roars the thunder of great Accad's cars,<BR>
Their brazen chariots as blazing stars<BR>
Through Nuk-khu's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> depths with streams of blazing fire,<BR>
Thus fall upon the foe with vengeful ire.<BR>
The smoking earth shakes underneath their wheels,<BR>
And from each cloud their thunder loudly peals.<BR>
Thus Accad on their foes have fiercely hurled<BR>
Their solid ranks with Nin-rad's flag unfurled,<BR>
The charging lines meet with a fearful sound,<BR>
As tempests' waves from rocks in rage rebound;<BR>
The foe thus meet the men of Izdubar,<BR>
While o'er the field fly the fierce gods of war.<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P>Dark Nin-a-zu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> her torch holds in her hand.<BR>
With her fierce screams directs the gory brand;<BR>
And Mam-mit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> urges her with furious hand,<BR>
And coiling dragons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> poison all the land<BR>
With their black folds and pestilential breath,<BR>
In fierce delight thus ride the gods of death.</P>
<P>The shouts of Accad mingle with the cries<BR>
Of wounded men and fiery steeds, which rise<BR>
From all the fields with shrieks of carnage, war,<BR>
Till victory crowns the host of Izdubar.<BR>
The chariots are covered with the slain,<BR>
And crushed beneath lie dead and dying men,<BR>
And horses in their harness wounded fall,<BR>
With dreadful screams, and wildly view the wall<BR>
Of dying warriors piling o'er their heads,<BR>
And wonder why each man some fury leads;<BR>
And others break across the gory plain<BR>
In mad career till they the mountain gain;<BR>
And snorting on the hills in wild dismay,<BR>
One moment glance below, then fly away;<BR>
Away from sounds that prove their masters, fiends,<BR>
Away to freedom snuffing purer winds,<BR>
Within some cool retreat by mountain streams,<BR>
Where peacefully for them, the sun-light gleams.<BR>
At last the foe is scattered o'er the plain,<BR>
And Accad fiercely slays the flying men;<BR>
When Izdubar beholds the victory won<BR>
By Accad's grand battalions of the sun,<BR>
His bugle-call the awful carnage stays,<BR>
Then loud the cry of victory they raise.</P>
