<P>Amazed the sovereign sat upon his throne;<BR>
And while she wooed, his heart was turned to stone;<BR>
In scorn replied:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rise Ishtar, Heaven's high queen,<BR>
Though all thy wealth, possessions I had seen<BR>
Now piled before me, all in gems and gold,<BR>
Of all the wealth of Heaven there heaped of old,<BR>
I nakedness and famine would prefer<BR>
To all the wealth divine thou canst confer.<BR>
What carest thou for earthly royalty?<BR>
The cup of poison shall thy lovers see.<BR>
Thou sawest me within a haunt away<BR>
From men. I lingered on that direful day,<BR>
And took thee for a beauteous <I>zi-re-mu</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Or <I>zi-ar-i-a</I> or a <I>zi-lit-tu</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
And thou didst cause to enter love divine.<BR>
As <I>zi-cur-un-i</I>, spirit of the wine,<BR>
Thou didst deceive me with thine arts refined,<BR>
And love escaped upon the passing wind.<BR>
Then to my palace come, and me there seek;<BR>
Didst place thy mouth upon my lips, and wake<BR>
Within my breast a dream of love and fire,<BR>
Till I awoke and checked thy wild desire;<BR>
Thou earnest with the form of spirits fair,<BR>
Didst hover o'er me in my chamber there.<BR>
Thy godly fragrance from the skies above,<BR>
A sign did carry of the Queen of Love:<BR>
I woke, and thou didst vanish, then didst stand</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A></P>
<P>As mine own servant in my palace grand.<BR>
Then as a skulking foe, a mystic spell<BR>
Didst weave, and scorch me with the fires of hell<BR>
While I was wrapped in sleep. Again I woke,<BR>
I saw around me <I>dal-khi</I>, sulphurous smoke,<BR>
Which thou didst send around my royal bed;<BR>
And I believed that I was with the dead,<BR>
With <I>dal-khi</I> gloating over me in hell.<BR>
My <I>su-khu-li</I> then sought thy presence fell.<BR>
Forever may thy wooing cease! for love<BR>
Hath fled, may godly praises never move<BR>
Upon the lips of holy gods, or men,--<BR>
Of thee, the god of Love ne'er speak again!<BR>
I loved thee once; with love my heart inflamed<BR>
Once sought thee, but my troubles I have blamed<BR>
Upon thee, for the dreams which thou didst send.<BR>
Go! rest thy heart; and to thy pleasures wend!</P>
<P>For Tammuz of thy youth thy heart once wailed,<BR>
For years his weary form thy love assailed;<BR>
Allala next, the eagle, lovest, tore<BR>
His wings. No longer could he joyful soar<BR>
And float above the forest to the sky.<BR>
Thou leavest him with fluttering wings to die.<BR>
A lusty lion thou didst love, his might<BR>
Destroyed, and plucked his claws in fierce delight,<BR>
By sevens plucked, nor heard his piteous cry.<BR>
A glorious war-steed next thy love didst try,<BR>
Who yielded to thee, till his strength was gone:<BR>
For seven <I>kaspu</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> thou didst ride upon<BR>
Him without ceasing, gave no food nor drink,<BR>
Till he beneath thee to the earth did sink,<BR>
And to his mistress, Sil-i-li, the steed<BR>
Returned with broken spirit, drooping head.<BR>
Thou lovest Tabulu, the shepherd king,<BR>
And from his love continuous didst wring<BR>
<I>Sem-uk-ki</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> till he to appease thy love,<BR>
The mighty gods of heaven then sought to move<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P>To pity with his daily offerings.<BR>
Beneath thy wand upon the ground he springs,<BR>
Transformed to a hyena; then was driven<BR>
From his own city--by his dogs was riven.<BR>
Next Is-ul-lan-u lov'st, uncouth, and rude,<BR>
Thy father's laborer, who subject stood<BR>
To thee, and daily scoured thy vessels bright:<BR>
His eyes from him were torn, before thy sight.<BR>
And chained before thee, there thy lover stood,<BR>
With deadly poison placed within his food.<BR>
Thou sayst:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Isullanu, stretch thy hand!<BR>
The food partake, that doth before thee stand!<BR>
Then with thy hand didst offer him the food.<BR>
He said: 'What askest thou? It is not good!<BR>
I will not eat the poison thus prepared.'<BR>
Thy godly wand him from thy presence cleared,<BR>
Transformed him to a pillar far away.<BR>
And for my love Queen Ishtar comes this day?<BR>
As thou hast done with others, would thy love<BR>
Return to me, thine actions all doth prove."</P>
<P>The queen in fury from his presence turned,<BR>
In speechless rage the palace halls she spurned;<BR>
And proudly from the earth swept to the skies;<BR>
Her godly train in terror quickly flies.</P>
