<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE KING'S ADVENTURE AT THE GATE OF THE GARDEN OF THE GODS WITH THE TWO MAIDENS--ONE OF THEM LEADS HIM INTO THE HAPPY HALLS--SONGS OF THE SABITU AND ZI-SI.</H3>
<P>A gate half opened shows the silvery sea<BR>
Yet distant shining lambent on his way.<BR>
And now he sees young Siduri,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> whose breast<BR>
Infuses life; all nature she hath blest,<BR>
Whose lips are flames, her arms are walls of fire,<BR>
Whose love yields pleasures that can never tire,<BR>
She to the souls who joy on earth here miss,<BR>
Grants them above a holier, purer bliss.<BR>
The maiden sits within a holy shrine<BR>
Beside the gate with lustrous eyes divine,<BR>
And beckons to the King, who nearer comes,<BR>
And near her glows the Happy Palace domes.</P>
<P>And lo! 'tis she his lips have fondly kissed<BR>
Within the garden, when like fleeing mist<BR>
She disappeared with the bright spirit Seven,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The Sabit, who oft glide from earth to Heaven.<BR>
And lo I one of the Seven, Sabitu,<BR>
Emerging from the gate doth jealous view<BR>
The coming hero who hath kissed her mate,<BR>
She angry springs within to close the gate,<BR>
And bars it, enters then the inner halls,<BR>
And Izdubar to her now loudly calls,<BR>
"O Sabitu! what see-est thou, my maid?<BR>
Of Izdubar is Sabitu afraid?<BR>
Thy gate thou barrest thus before my face.<BR>
Quick, open for me! or I'll force the brass!"<BR>
The maid now frightened opens wide the door.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A></P>
<P>The Sar and Siduri now tread the floor<BR>
Of the bright palace where sweet joy doth reign.<BR>
Through crystal halls 'neath golden roofs the twain<BR>
Next go within a lofty ceilinged hall,<BR>
With shining pearl&egrave;d columns, golden wall,<BR>
And purple silken hangings at each door,<BR>
With precious gems inlaid upon the floor;<BR>
Where couches grand are spread for one to rest<BR>
Beneath the softened rays that sweet invest<BR>
The senses with a thrill of happiness;<BR>
Where Siduri with joy all souls doth bless.<BR>
The maid sits on a couch and turns her face<BR>
Toward the King with that immortal grace<BR>
That love to gods and men will e'er bestow.<BR>
Their eyes now mingling with a happy glow,<BR>
The maiden sweetly says: "Where wouldst thou go?<BR>
Within these Happy Halls we joy but know,<BR>
And if thou wilt, my King, my heart is thine!<BR>
Our love will ever bring us bliss divine."</P>
<P>"Alas, my maid, thy love to me is dear,<BR>
And sad am I that I must go from here.<BR>
I came from Erech by advice from one<BR>
I loved more than thou canst e'er know, but gone<BR>
From me is my Heabani, faithful seer.<BR>
Across a desert waste have I come here,<BR>
And he has there to dust returned,--to dust--<BR>
O how the love of my friend I did trust!<BR>
I would that we had never started here,<BR>
I now must find the great immortal seer."</P>
<P>The maiden turns her glowing eyes on him,<BR>
Replies: "My King, thou knowest joy may gleam,<BR>
Take courage, weary heart, and sing a song!<BR>
The hour of sorrow can never be long;<BR>
The day will break, and flood thy soul with joy,<BR>
And happiness thy heart will then employ!<BR>
Each day must end with all its sorrow, woe,<BR>
Oh, sing with me, dear heart! I love thee so!"<BR>
And lo! the curtains flung aside, now comes</P>
<P><A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A></P>
<P>The joyous Sabitu from yonder rooms,<BR>
And gathering round, a song they gayly sing,<BR>
Oh, how with music the bright walls now ring!<BR>
If evil thou hast done, my King,</P><DIR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, pray! oh, pray!<BR>
And to the gods thy offerings bring,<BR>

The sea is roaring at thy feet,<BR>
The storms are coming, rain and sleet;<BR>

And with the Zisi crowned she now appeared;<BR>
The corn-gods in a crescent round their queen,<BR>
She waves before the king her Nusku&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> green,<BR>
And sings with her sweet voice a joyful lay,<BR>

<P>The singing spirits from them fled, and he<BR>
Alone stood thinking by young Siduri.</P>
<P>The King leaned on his bow, and eyed the maid,<BR>
A happy look came in his eyes,--and fled,<BR>
For lo! the curtain quick aside is pushed,<BR>
And Sabitu within upon them rushed.<BR>
She stately glides across the shining floor,<BR>
And eyes them both, then turns toward the door.<BR>
But Izdubar is equal to the task,<BR>
With grace now smiling, of the maid doth ask:<BR>
"O Sabitu! wouldst thou tell me the way<BR>
To Khasisadra? for I go this day.<BR>
If I the sea may cross, how shall I go?<BR>
Or through the desert? thou the path mayst know."<BR>
The maiden startled looks upon his face,<BR>
And thus she answers him with queenly grace:<BR>
"So soon must go? Thou canst not cross the sea,<BR>
For thou wilt perish in the waves that way.<BR>
Great Samas once the way of me did ask,<BR>
And I forbade him, but the mighty task<BR>
He undertook, and crossed the mighty deep,<BR>
Where Death's dark waters lie in wait asleep:<BR>
His mighty car of gold swept through the skies,<BR>
With fiery chargers now he daily flies.<BR>
When I approach thee, thou from me wouldst flee?<BR>
But if thou must so soon thus go, the sea<BR>
Perhaps thou too canst cross, if thou wilt 'void<BR>
Death's waters, which relentless ever glide.<BR>
But Izdubar, Ur-Hea, here hath come!<BR>
The boatman of the seer, who to his home<BR>
Returns. He with an axe in yonder woods<BR>
A vessel builds to cross the raging floods.<BR>
If thou desirest not to cross with him,<BR>
We here will welcome thee through endless time;<BR>
But if thou goest, may they see thy face<BR>
Thou seekest,--welcome thee, and thy heart bless."</P>
