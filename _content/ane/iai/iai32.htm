<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ISHTAR'S DESCENT TO HADES--HER FEARFUL RECEPTION</H3>
<P>To Hades' darkened land, whence none return,<BR>
Queen Ishtar, Sin's great daughter, now doth turn;<BR>
Inclined her ear and listened through the void<BR>
That lay beneath of every path devoid,<BR>
The home of darkness, of the Under-World,<BR>
Where god Ir-kal-la&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> from the heights was hurled.<BR>
The land and road from whence is no return,<BR>
Where light no entrance hath to that dark bourne;<BR>
Where dust to dust returns, devouring clods;<BR>
Where light dwells not in Tsil-lat-tus abodes;<BR>
Where sable ravens hovering rule the air;<BR>
O'er doors and bolts dust reigneth with despair.<BR>
Before the gates of gloom the Queen now stands,<BR>
And to the keeper Ishtar thus commands:<BR>
"O keeper of the waters! open wide<BR>
Thy gate, that I through these dark walls may glide;<BR>
But if thou open'st not the gate for me,<BR>
That I may enter, shattered thou shalt see<BR>
The doors and bolts before thee lying prone,<BR>
And from the dust shall rise each skeleton,<BR>
With fleshless jaws devour all men with thee,<BR>
Till death shall triumph o'er mortality."<BR>
The keeper to the Princess Ishtar said:<BR>
"Withhold thy speech! or Allat's fury dread!<BR>
To her I go to bid thee welcome here."<BR>
To Allat then the keeper doth appear:<BR>
"Thy sister Ishtar the dark waters seeks--<BR>
The Queen of Heaven," thus Allat's fury breaks.<BR>
"So like an herb uprooted comes this Queen,<BR>
To sting me as an asp doth Ishtar mean?<BR>
What can her presence bring to me but hate?<BR>
Doth Heaven's Queen thus come infuriate?"<BR>
And Ishtar thus replies: "The fount I seek,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A></P>
<P>Where I with Tammuz, my first love, may speak;<BR>
And drink its waters, as sweet nectar-wines,<BR>
Weep o'er my husband, who in death reclines;<BR>
My loss as wife with handmaids I deplore,<BR>
O'er my dear Tammuz let my teardrops pour."<BR>
And Allat said, "Go! keeper, open wide<BR>
The gates to her! she hath me once defied;<BR>
Bewitch her as commanded by our laws."<BR>
To her thus Hades opened wide its jaws.</P>
<P>"Within, O goddess! Cutha thee receives!<BR>
Thus Hades' palace its first greeting gives."<BR>
He seized her, and her crown aside was thrown.<BR>
"O why, thou keeper, dost thou seize my crown?<BR>
"Within, O goddess! Allat thee receives!<BR>
'Tis thus to thee our Queen her welcome gives."<BR>
Within the next gate he her earrings takes,<BR>
And goddess Ishtar now with fury shakes,<BR>
"Then why, thou slave, mine earrings take away?"<BR>
"Thus entrance, goddess, Allat bids this day."<BR>
At the third gate her necklace next he takes,<BR>
And now in fear before him Ishtar quakes.<BR>
"And wilt thou take from me my gems away?"<BR>
"Thus entrance, goddess, Allat bids this day."<BR>
And thus he strips the goddess at each gate,<BR>
Of ornaments upon her breast and feet<BR>
And arms; her bracelets, girdle from her waist,<BR>
Her robe next took, and flung the Queen undrest<BR>
Within a cell of that dark solitude.<BR>
At last, before Queen Ishtar Allat stood,<BR>
When she had long remained within the walls<BR>
And Allat mocked her till Queen Ishtar falls<BR>
Humiliated on the floor in woe;<BR>
Then turning wildly, cursed her ancient foe.<BR>
Queen Allat furious to her servant cries:<BR>
"Go! Naintar! with disease strike blind her eyes!<BR>
And strike her side! her breast and head and feet;<BR>
With foul disease her strike, within the gate!"</P>
