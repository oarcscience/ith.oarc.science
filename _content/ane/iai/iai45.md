## COLUMN II

### THE KING ON LEAVING THE HAPPY HALLS MEETS UR-HEA, THE BOATMAN OF THE SEER KHASISADRA--THEY BUILD A SHIP AND EMBARK ON AN UNKNOWN SEA, AND ON THEIR VOYAGE PASS THROUGH THE WATERS OF DEATH

And Izdubar turned from the Halls and goes  
Toward a fountain in the park, whence flows  
A merry stream toward the wood. He finds  
An axe beside the fount, and thoughtful winds,  
Through groves of sandal-wood and mastic-trees  
And algum, umritgana. Now he sees  
The sig-a-ri and ummakana, pines,  
With babuaku; and ri-wood brightly shines  
Among the azuhu; all precious woods  
That man esteems are grown around, each buds  
Continuous in the softened, balmy air.  
He stops beneath a musrilkanna where  
The pine-trees spread toward the glowing sea,  
Wild mingled with the surman, sa-u-ri.

The King, now seated, with himself communes,  
Heeds not the warbling of the birds, and tunes  
Of gorgeous songsters in the trees around,  
But sadly sighing gazes on the ground:  
"And I a ship must build; alas! I know  
Not how I shall return, if I thus go.  
The awful Flood of Death awaits me there,  
Wide-stretching from this shore--I know not where."  
He rests his chin upon his hand in thought,  
Full weary of a life that woe had brought;  
He says: "When I remember Siduri,  
Whose heart with fondest love would comfort me  
Within these Happy Halls, why should I go  
To pain and anguish, death, mayhap, and woe?  
But will I thus desert my kingdom, throne?  
For one I know not! What! my fame alone!  
Mine honor should preserve! and royal state!  
Alas! this Fame is but a dream of--Fate!\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

A longing after that which does not cheer  
The heart. Applause of men, or thoughtless sneer,  
Is naught to me, I am alone! alone!  
This Immortality cannot atone  
For my hard fate that wrings mine aching heart.  
I long for peace and rest, and I must start  
And find it, leave these luring bright abodes,--  
I seek the immortality of gods.  
This Fame of man is not what it doth seem,  
It sleeps with all the past, a vanished dream.  
My duty calls me to my kingdom, throne!  
To Khasisadra go, whose aid alone  
Can save my people from an awful fate  
That hangs above them, born of Fiends of hate.  
And I shall there return without my seer!  
I live; and he is dead. Why did I hear  
His words advising me to come? Alas!  
I sadly all my weary days shall pass;  
No one shall love me as my seer, my friend.

But what said Siduri?--There comes an end  
At last to sorrow, joy will hopeful spring  
On wings of Light! Oh, how my heart will sing!  
I bless ye all, ye holy spirits here!  
Your songs will linger with me, my heart cheer;  
Upon my way I turn with joy again!  
How true your joyful song! your memory then  
Will keep me hopeful through yon darkened way;  
How bright this land doth look beside the sea!"

He looks across the fields; the river glows  
And winds beside taprani-trees, and flows  
By teberinth and groves of tarpikhi  
And ku-trees; curving round green mez-kha-i,  
Through beds of flowers, that kiss its waves and spring  
Luxuriant,--with songs the groves far ring.  
Now thinking of the ship, he turns his eyes,  
Toward the fountain,--springs up with surprise!  
"'Tis he! the boatman comes! Ur-Hea comes!  
And, oh! at last, I'll reach the glistening domes\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

Of Khasisadra's palaces,--at last  
My feet shall rest,--upon that land be placed."

And now Ur-Hea nearer makes his way,  
And Izdubar addressing him, doth say:  
"Ur-Hea is thy name? from yonder sea  
Thou comest, from the seer across the way?"

"Thou speakest truth, great Sar, what wouldst thou have?"  
"How shall I Khasisadra reach? The grave  
He hath escaped, Immortal lives beyond,  
For I to him upon my way am bound;  
Shall I the waters cross or take my way  
Through yon wide desert, for I start this day?"

"Across the sea we go, for I with thee  
Return to him,--I know the winding way.  
Thine axe of bronze with precious stones inlaid  
With mine, we'll use beneath the pine-trees' shade."

And now, within the grove a ship they made,  
Complete and strong as wise Ur-Hea bade.  
They fell the pines five *gar* in length, and hew  
The timbers square, and soon construct a new  
And buoyant vessel, firmly fixed the mast,  
And tackling, sails, and oars make taut and fast.  
Thus built, toward the sea they push its prow,  
Equipped complete, provisioned, launch it now.  
An altar next they raise and thus invoke  
The gods, their evil-workings to revoke:

 <span id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_266) O Lord of Charms, Illustrious!
who gives  
Life to the Dead, the Merciful who lives,  
And grants to hostile gods of Heaven return,  
To homage render, worship thee, and learn\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

Obedience! Thou who didst create mankind  
In tenderness, thy love round us, oh, wind!  
The Merciful, the God with whom is Life,  
Establish us, O Lord, in darkest strife.  
O never may thy truth forgotten be,  
May Accad's race forever worship thee."

One month and fifteen days upon the sea,  
Thus far the voyagers are on their way;  
Now black before them lies a barren shore,  
O'ertopped with frowning cliffs, whence comes a roar  
Of some dread fury of the elements  
That shakes the air and sweeping wrath foments  
O'er winds and seas.  
                        And see! a yawning cave,  
There opens vast into a void dislave,  
Where fremèd shadows ride the hueless waves.  
Dread Ninazu whose deathless fury craves  
For hapless victims lashes with a roar  
The mighty seas upon that awful shore.  
The Fiends of Darkness gathered lie in wait,  
With Mammitu, the goddess of fierce hate,  
And Gibil <span id="fr_270"></span>[2](#fn_267) with his spells, and
Nibiru <span id="fr_271"></span>[3](#fn_268)  
The twin-god of black Fate, and grim Nusku <span
id="fr_272"></span>[4](#fn_269)  
The keeper of red thunders, and Urbat <span
id="fr_273"></span>[5](#fn_270)  
The dog of Death, and fiend of Queen Belat; <span
id="fr_274"></span>[6](#fn_271)  
And Nuk-khu, and the black-browed Ed-hutu <span
id="fr_275"></span>[7](#fn_272)  
The gods of darkness here with Tsi-lat-tu. <span
id="fr_276"></span>[8](#fn_273)

And see! Dark Rimmon <span id="fr_277"></span>[9](#fn_274) o'er a crag
alone!  
And Gibil with his blasting malisoun,  
Above with his dark face maleficent,  
Who wields a power o'er men omnipotent  
Forlore! forlore! the souls who feel that blast  
Which sweeps around that black forbidding coast!  
Fierce whirling storms and hurricanes here leap,  
With blasting lightnings maltalent and sweep

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

The furious waves that lash around that shore,  
As the fierce whirl of some dread maëlstrom's power!  
Above the cavern's arch! see! Ninip <span
id="fr_278"></span>[10](#fn_275) stands!  
He points within the cave with beckoning hands!  
Ur-Hea cries: "My lord! the tablets <span
id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_276) say,  
That we should not attempt that furious way!  
Those waters of black death will smite us down!  
Within that cavern's depths we will but drown."  
"We cannot go but once, my friend, that road,"  
The hero said, "'Tis only ghosts' abode!"  
"We go, then, Izdubar, its depths will sound,  
But we within that gloom will whirl around,  
Around, within that awful whirlpool black,--  
And once within, we dare not then turn back,--  
How many times, my friend, I dare not say,  
'Tis written, we within shall make our way."

The foaming tide now grasped them with its power,  
And billowed round them with continuous roar;  
Away! they whirl! with growing speed, till now  
They fly on lightnings' wings and ride the brow  
Of maddened tempests o'er the dizzy deep.  
So swift they move,--the waves in seeming sleep  
Beneath them, whirling there with force unseen.

But see! Updarting with a sulphurous gleen,  
The hag of Death leaps on the trembling prow!  
Her eyes, of fire and hate, turns on them now!  
With famine gaunt, and haggard face of doom,  
She sits there soundless in the awful gloom.

"O gods!" shrieked Izdubar in his despair,  
Have I the god of Fate at last met here?  
Avaunt, thou Fiend! hence to thy pit of Hell!  
Hence! hence! and rid me of thy presence fell!"

And see! she nearer comes with deathless ire,  
With those fierce, moveless, glaring eyes of fire!  
Her wand is raised! she strikes!\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

                                "O gods!" he screams;  
He falls beneath that bolt that on them gleams,  
And she is gone within the awful gloom.  
Hark! hear those screams!  
                   "Accurst! Accurst thy doom!"  
And lo! he springs upon his feet in pain,  
And cries:  
              "Thy curses, fiend! I hurl again!"  
And now a blinding flash disparts the black  
And heavy air, a moment light doth break;  
And see! the King leans fainting 'gainst the mast,  
With glaring eyeballs, clenched hands,--aghast!  
Behold! that pallid face and scaly hands!  
A leper white, accurst of gods, he stands!  
A living death, a life of awful woe,  
Incurable by man, his way shall go.  
But oh! the seer in all enchantments wise  
Will cure him on that shore, or else he dies.

And see! the vessel's prow with shivering turns,  
Adown the roaring flood that gapes and churns  
Beneath like some huge boiling cauldron black,  
Thus whirl they in the slimy cavern's track.  
And spirit ravens round them fill the air,  
And see! they fly! the cavern sweeps behind!  
Away the ship doth ride before the wind!  
The darkness deep from them has fled away,  
The fiends are gone!--the vessel in the spray  
With spreading sails has caught the glorious breeze,  
And dances in the light o'er shining seas;  
The blissful haven shines upon their way,  
The waters of the Dawn sweep o'er the sea!  
They proudly ride tip to the glowing sand,  
And joyfully the King springs to the land.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_266"></span>[142:1](iai45.htm#fr_269) This remarkable
prayer is to be found among a collection of prayers which are numbered
and addressed to separate deities.. It seems that the prayers were
originally Accadian, and were afterward adopted by the Assyrians, and
made to apply to one god (Hea). Professor Oppert and Professor Sayce
think, however, that they are connected in one hymn to Hea. This may
have been so after the Assyrians adopted them, but they are distinct,
and addressed to separate gods. The one we have selected is addressed to
Hea, the Creator of Mankind, Sayce edition Smith's "C. A. G.," pp. 75 to
80. The one we have selected is found at the top of page 77, idem.
