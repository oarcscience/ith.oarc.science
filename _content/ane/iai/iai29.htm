<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE FIGHT WITH THE WINGED BULL OF ANU</H3>
<P>The gods appear above to watch the fight,<BR>
And Erech's <I>masari</I> rush in affright<BR>
To Izdubar, who sits upon his throne,<BR>
Before him fall in speechless terror prone.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A></P>
<P>A louder roar now echoes from the skies,<BR>
And Erech's Sar without the palace flies.<BR>
He sees the monster light upon the plain,<BR>
And calls Heabani with the choicest men<BR>
Of Erech's spearsmen armed, who fall in line<BR>
Without the gates, led by their Sar divine.</P>
<P>And now the monster rushed on Izdubar,<BR>
Who meets it as the god of chase and war.<BR>
With whirling sword before the monster's face,<BR>
He rains his blows upon its front of brass<BR>
And horns, and drives it from him o'er the plain,<BR>
And now with spreading wings it comes again,<BR>
With maddened fury; fierce its eyeballs glare.<BR>
It rides upon the monarch's pointed spear;<BR>
The scales the point have turned, and broke the haft.<BR>
Then as a pouncing hawk when sailing daft,<BR>
In swiftest flight o'er him drops from the skies,<BR>
But from the gleaming sword it quickly flies.<BR>
Three hundred warriors now nearer drew<BR>
To the fierce monster, which toward them flew;<BR>
Into their midst the monster furious rushed,<BR>
And through their solid ranks resistless pushed<BR>
To stay Heabani, onward fought and broke<BR>
Two lines and through the third, which met the shock<BR>
With ringing swords upon his horns and scales.<BR>
At last the seer it reaches, him impales<BR>
With its sharp horns: but valiant is the seer--<BR>
He grasps its crest and fights without a fear.<BR>
The monster from his sword now turns to fly;<BR>
Heabani grasps its tail, and turns his eye<BR>
Towards his king, while scudding o'er the plain.<BR>
So quickly has it rushed and fled amain,<BR>
That Izdubar its fury could not meet,<BR>
But after it be sprang with nimble feet.</P>
<P>Heabani loosed his grasp and stumbling falls,<BR>
And to his king approaching, thus he calls:<BR>
"My friend, our strongest men are overthrown:<BR>
But see! he comes! such strength was never known.<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A></P>
<P>With all my might I held him, but he fled!<BR>
We both it can destroy! Strike at its head!<BR>
Like Rimmon now he flies upon the air,<BR>
As sceptred Nebo,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he his horns doth bear,<BR>
That flash with fire along the roaring skies,<BR>
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Around the Sar and seer he furious flies.<BR>
Heabani grasps the plunging horns, nor breaks<BR>
His grasp; in vain the monster plunging shakes<BR>
His head, and roaring, upward furious rears.<BR>
Heabani's strength the mighty monster fears;<BR>
He holds it in his iron grasp, and cries:<BR>
"Quick! strike!" Beneath the blows the monster dies;<BR>
And Izdubar now turned his furious face<BR>
Toward the gods, and on the beast doth place<BR>
His foot; he raised his gory sword on high,<BR>
And sent his shout defiant to the sky:<BR>
"'Tis thus, ye foes divine! the Sar proclaims<BR>
His war against your power, and highest names!<BR>
Hurl! hurl! your darts of fire, ye vile <I>kal-bi</I>!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
My challenge hear! ye cravens of the sky!</P>
