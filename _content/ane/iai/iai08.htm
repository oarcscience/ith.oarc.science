<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ISHTAR'S MIDNIGHT COURTSHIP IN THE PALACE OF IZDUBAR.</H3>
<P>As Samas' car sank in the glowing west,<BR>
And Sin the moon-god forth had come full drest<BR>
For starry dance across the glistening skies,<BR>
The sound of work for man on earth now dies,<BR>
And all betake themselves to sweet repose.<BR>
The silver light of Sin above bright flows,<BR>
And floods the figures on the painted walls,<BR>
O'er sculptured lions, softly, lightly falls;<BR>
Like grim and silent watch-dogs at the door<BR>
They stand; in marble check their leaping roar.<BR>
The King within his chamber went his way,<BR>
Upon his golden jewelled couch he lay.<BR>
The silken scarlet canopy was hung<BR>
In graceful drapery and loosely clung</P>
<P><A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A></P>
<P>Around his couch, and purple damask cloths<BR>
Embroidered with rare skill, preserved from moths<BR>
By rich perfumes, to the carved lintel clung<BR>
In graceful folds; thus o'er the entrance hung.</P>
<P>Queen Ishtar softly comes, and o'er his dreams<BR>
A mystic spell she draws, until it seems<BR>
While half awake he lies, that she is yet<BR>
Close nestling in his arms, as he had met<BR>
Her in the wood, and with her there reclined,<BR>
While her soft arms around him were entwined.<BR>
Thus while he sleeps she hovers o'er his bed<BR>
With throbbing heart, and close inclines her head<BR>
Until her lips near touch the sleeping King's,<BR>
But daring not to kiss.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She love thus brings,<BR>
All through his dreams; until one misty night,<BR>
While be yet restless tossed, the lovely sprite<BR>
Sunk him to deeper sleep with her soft lyre<BR>
While hanging o'er his couch consumed with fire<BR>
That nestling around her heart-strings fiercely burned<BR>
Until at last lulled by the strain he turned<BR>
Upon his couch at rest, and she now lay<BR>
Beside him closely, when she heard him say:<BR>
"My love thou art, but canst not be!" No more<BR>
He murmurs, then inflamed she sought the door.<BR>
"Perchance the <I>su-khu-li</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> sleep not!" she said;<BR>
And satisfied, turned where her lover laid;<BR>
And to his royal couch she crept again;<BR>
Her bliss will have despite of gods and men.<BR>
Her hot and burning lips cannot resist<BR>
The tempting treasure lying there, nor missed<BR>
Shall be the dearest joys of love from her<BR>
Who rules all hearts in Heaven, earth, and air.<BR>
Her right divine that blessing sweet to take,<BR>
She will assert, her burning thirst to slake.</P>
<P>His couch the Heavenly Queen of Love now graces,<BR>
And on his breast her glorious head she places;<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P><A NAME="page_28"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 28</FONT></A></P>
<P>Embracing him, she softly through her lips<BR>
And his, the sweetest earthly nectar sips,<BR>
While he in sleep lies murmuring of love,<BR>
And she in blissful ecstasy doth move.<BR>
Her lips to his, she wildly places there,<BR>
Until to him it seems a fond nightmare.</P>
<P>And thus, against his will, she fondly takes<BR>
What he her shall deny when he awakes,<BR>
The stolen kisses both the lovers thrill:<BR>
Unquenched her warm desire would kiss him still,<BR>
But his hot blood now warms him in his dream<BR>
Which is much more to him than it doth seem;<BR>
And clasping her within convulsing arms,<BR>
Receives a thrill that all his nerves alarms,<BR>
And wakes him from the dreams she had instilled.<BR>
"What means this fantasy that hath me filled,<BR>
And spirit form that o'er my pillow leans;<BR>
I wonder what this fragrant incense means?<BR>
Oh, tush! 'tis but an idle, wildering dream,<BR>
But how delightful, joyous it did seem!<BR>
Her beauteous form it had, its breath perfume;<BR>
Do spirit forms such loveliness assume?"</P>
<P>The goddess yet dares not her form reveal,<BR>
And quickly she herself doth now conceal<BR>
Behind the damask curtains at the door.<BR>
When he awoke, sprang to the chamber floor,<BR>
As his own maid the queen herself transforms,<BR>
Says entering in haste:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What wild alarms<BR>
Thee, Sar?" and then demure awaits reply,<BR>
In doubt to hear or to his bosom fly.<BR>
"My maid art thou? 'Tis well, for I have dreamed<BR>
Of spirits, as a Zi-ru fair it seemed."</P>
