<TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/20701.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"></TD></TR></TABLE> I HAVE had considerable difficulty in writing this chapter; in fact I have arranged the matter now three times, and such is the wretched broken condition of the fragments that I am even now quite uncertain if I have the correct order. The various detached fragments belong to the fourth and fifth tablets in the series, and relate the contest between Izdubar and Humbaba.</p>  
<p>I have already stated my opinion that Humbaba was an Elamite, and that he was the last of the dynasty which, according to Berosus, conquered and held Babylonia for about two centuries, between B.C. 2450 and 2250. Humbaba held his court in the midst of a region of <i>erini</i> trees, where there were also trees of the specie called <i>Survan;</i> these two words are very vaguely used in the inscriptions, and</p>  
<p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="green">p. 208</font></A></p>  
<p>appear to refer rather to the quality and appearance of the trees than to the exact species. <i>Erini</i> is used for a tall fine tree: it is used for the pine, cedar, and ash. I have here translated the word "pine," and <i>survan</i> I have translated "cedar." In one inscription Lebanon is said to be the country of <i>survan</i>, in allusion to its cedar trees.</p>  
<p>This section of the Izdubar legends was undoubtedly of great importance, for, although it was disfigured by the poetical adornments deemed necessary to give interest to the narrative, yet of itself, as it described the overthrow of a dynasty and the accession of Izdubar to the throne, it has interest for us in spite of its mutilated condition. When I published my "Assyrian Discoveries" none of these fragments were in condition for publication, but I have since joined and restored some of them, and the new fragments have given sufficient aid to enable me now to present them in some sort, but it is quite possible that any further accession of new fragments would alter the arrangement I have here given.</p>  
<p>I at first placed in this division a fragment of the story made up from three parts of a tablet, and containing a discourse of Heabani to some trees, but subsequent investigation has caused me to withdraw this fragment and place it in the space of the eighth tablet.</p>  
<p>In the case of the fourth tablet I think I have fragments of all six columns, but some of these fragments are useless until we have further fragments to complete them.</p>

<p>12. [Izdubar] opened his mouth and spake,</p>  
<p>13. and said to Heabani:</p>

<p>20. . . . . . . . . . .the great queen</p>  
<p align="center">(Probably over twenty lines lost here.)</p>  
<p>It was this fragment, which gives part of the conversation between Heabani and Izdubar previous to the attack on Humbaba, which led me to the opinion that Izdubar was not yet king of Babylonia, for</p>  
<p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Heabani promises (lines 10 and 11) that they will make Izdubar king when they have slain Humbaba and given his corpse to the vultures (lines 4, 8, and 9).</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Column</span> II.</p>

<p>7. he . . . he ascended to the city</p>  
<p>8. he went up to the presence of Shamas he made a sacrifice?</p>  
<p>9. he built an altar. In the presence of Shamas he lifted his hands:</p>  
<p>10. Why hast thou established Izdubar, in thy heart thou hast given him protection,</p>  
<p>11. when the son . . . . and he goes</p>  
<p>12. on the remote path to Humbaba,</p>  
<p>13. A battle he knows not he will confront,</p>  
<p>14. an expedition he knows not he will ride to,</p>  
<p>15. for long he will go and will return,</p>  
<p>16. to take the course to the forest of pine trees,</p>  
<p>17. to Humbaba of [whom his city may] he destroy,</p>  
<p>18. and every one who is evil whom thou hatest . . .</p>

<p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></A></p>  
<p align="center">(About ten lines lost here.)</p>  
<p>Here we see that Izdubar, impressed with the magnitude of the task he had undertaken, makes a prayer and sacrifice to Shamas to aid him in his task. The next fragment appears also to belong to this column, and may refer to preliminaries for sacrificing to Ishtar, with a view also to gain her aid in the enterprise.</p>  
<p>This fragment of Column II. reads</p>  
<p>1. . . . . neighbourhood of Erech . . . .</p>

<p>Five more mutilated lines, the rest of the column being lost.</p>  
<p>This fragment shows Izdubar still invoking the gods for his coming expedition. Under the next column I have placed a fragment, the position and meaning of which are quite unknown.</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Column</span> IV.&#8212;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Uncertain Fragment</span>.</p>

<p>Somewhere here should be the story, now lost, of the starting of Izdubar on his expedition accompanied by his friend Heabani. The sequel shows they arrive at the palace or residence of Heabani, which is surrounded by a forest of pine and cedar, the whole</p>  
<p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="green">p. 213</font></A></p>  
<p>being enclosed by some barrier or wall, with a gate for entrance. Heabani and Izdubar open this gate where the story reopens on the fifth column.</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Column</span> V.</p>

<p>6. and in the path of his forest he stood and [waited]</p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>7. Izdubar to him also [said to Heabani]</p>  
<p>Here we see Humbaba waiting for the intruders, but the rest of the column is lost; it appears to have principally consisted of speeches by Izdubar and Heabani on the magnificent trees they saw, and the work before them. A single fragment of Column VI., containing fragments of six lines, shows them still at the gate, and when the next tablet, No. V., opens, they had not yet entered.</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tablet</span> V.</p>  
<p>The fifth tablet is more certain than the last; it appears to refer to the conquest of Humbaba or Hubaba. I have only discovered fragments of this tablet, which opens with a description of the retreat of Humbaba.</p>

<p>It appears from the various mutilated fragments of this tablet that Izdubar and Heabani conquer and slay Humbaba and take his goods, but much is wanted to connect the fragments.</p>  
<p>The conclusion of this stage of the story and triumph of Izdubar are given at the commencement of the sixth tablet. It appears, when the matter is stripped of the marvellous incidents with which the poets have surrounded it, that Izdubar and his friend went privately to the palace of Humbaba, killed the monarch and carried off his regalia, the death of the oppressor being the signal for the proclamation of Babylonian freedom and the reign of Izdubar.</p>
