<TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/10101.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"></TD></TR></TABLE> IN the last chapter I have given the fragments of the principal story of the Creation and Fall from the cuneiform inscriptions, but it appears from the tablets that all these legends were "traditions" or "stories" repeated by word of mouth, and afterwards committed to writing. When such traditions are not reduced to writing, and depend on being handed down from generation to generation by word of mouth, they are liable to vary, sometimes very widely, according to the period and condition of the country. Thus many different versions of a story arise, and there can be no doubt that this was actually the case with the Creation legends. There must</p>  
<p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></A></p>  
<p>have been a belief in the Creation and some of the leading features of this story long before these Creation legends were committed to writing, and there is evidence of other stories, related to those already given, which were at about the same time committed to writing. The story of the Creation transmitted through Berosus (see chapter iii. pp. 37&#8211;50) supplies us with a totally different story, differing entirely from the cuneiform account in the last chapter and from the Genesis account, and some fragments of tablets from Kouyunjik belonging to the library of Assurbanipal give a copy, mutilated as usual, of another version having many points of agreement with the account of Berosus. This legend, of which the following is a translation, is stated to be copied from a tablet at Cutha.</p>

<p>This is a very obscure inscription, the first column, however, forms part of a relation similar to that of Berosus in his history of the Creation; the beings who were killed by the light, and those with men's heads and bird's bodies, and bird's heads and men's bodies,</p>  
<p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></A></p>  
<p>agree with the composite monsters of Berosus, while the goddess of chaos, Tiamat, who is over them, is the same again as the Tiamat of the Creation legends and the Thalatth of Berosus.</p>  
<p>The relation in the second and third columns of the inscription is difficult, and does not correspond with any known incident. The fourth column contains an address to any future king who should read the inscription which was deposited in the temple of Nergal at Cutha.</p>  
<p>It is probable that this legend was supposed to be the work of one of the mythical kings of Chaldea, who describes the condition and history of the world before his time.</p>  
<p>There is another legend which appears to be connected with these, the legend of the seven evil spirits, which I have given in my former work, "Assyrian Discoveries," p. 398.</p>

<p>10. the third was a leopard . . . .</p>

<p>13. the sixth was a striker which to god and king did not submit,</p>  
<p>14. the seventh was the messenger of the evil wind which . . . . made.</p>  
<p>15. The seven of them messengers of the god Anu their king</p>  
<p>16. from city to city went round</p>  
<p>17. the tempest of heaven was strongly bound to them,</p>  
<p>18. the flying clouds of heaven surrounded them,</p>  
<p>19. the downpour of the skies which in the bright day</p>  
<p>20. makes darkness, was attached to them</p>  
<p>21. with a violent wind, an evil wind, they began,</p>  
<p>22. the tempest of Vul was their might,</p>  
<p>23. at the right hand of Vul they came,</p>  
<p>24. from the surface of heaven like lightning they darted,</p>  
<p>25. descending to the abyss of waters, at first they came.</p>  
<p>26. In the wide heavens of the god Anu the king</p>  
<p>27. evil they set up, and an opponent they had not.</p>  
<p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></A></p>  
<p>28. At this time Bel of this matter heard and</p>  
<p>29. the account sank into his heart.</p>  
<p>30. With Hea the noble sage of the gods he took counsel, and</p>  
<p>31. Sin (the moon), Shamas (the sun), and Ishtar (Venus) in the lower part of heaven to control it he appointed.</p>  
<p>32. With Anu to the government of the whole of heaven he set them up.</p>  
<p>33. To the three of them the gods his children,</p>  
<p>34. day and night to be united and not to break apart,</p>

<p>37. in the lower part of heaven commencing,</p>  
<p>38. before the light of Sin fiercely they came,</p>

<p>10. . . . . . of the earth</p>  
<p>11. . . . . . troubled and on high he sat,</p>  
<p>12. night and day fearing, in the seat of his dominion he did not sit.</p>  
<p>13. Those evil gods the messengers of Anu their king</p>  
<p>14. devised with wicked heads to assist one another, and</p>  
<p>15. evil they spake together, and</p>  
<p>16. from the midst of heaven like a wind to the earth they carne down.</p>  
<p>17. The god Bel of the noble Sin, his trouble</p>  
<p>18. in heaven, he saw and</p>  
<p>19. Bel to his attendant the god Nusku said:</p>  
<p>20. "Attendant Nusku this account to the ocean carry, and</p>  
<p>21. the news of my child Sin who in heaven is greatly troubled;</p>  
<p>22. to the god Hea in the ocean repeat."</p>  
<p>23. Nusku the will of his lord obeyed, and</p>  
<p>24. to Hea in the ocean descended and went.</p>  
<p>25. To the prince, the noble sage, the lord, the god unfailing,</p>  
<p>26. Nusku the message of his lord at once repeated.</p>  
<p>27. Hea in the ocean that message heard, and</p>  
<p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></A></p>  
<p>28. his lips spake, and with wisdom his mouth was filled.</p>  
<p>29. Hea his son the god Merodach called, and this word he spake</p>  
<p>30. "Go my son Merodach</p>  
<p>31. enter into the shining Sin who in heaven is greatly troubled;</p>  
<p>32. his trouble from heaven expel.</p>  
<p>33. Seven of them the evil gods, spirits of death, having no fear,</p>  
<p>34. seven of them the evil gods, who like a flood</p>  
<p>35. descend and sweep over the earth.</p>  
<p>36. To the earth like a storm they come down.</p>  
<p>37. Before the light of Sin fiercely they came</p>  
<p>38. the noble Shamas and Vul the warrior, to their side they turned and . . . .</p>  
<p>The end of this legend is lost; it probably recorded the interference of Merodach in favour of Sin, the moon god.</p>  
<p>In this story, which differs again from all the others, Bel is supposed to place in the heaven the Moon, Sun, and Venus, the representative of the stars. The details have no analogy with the other stories, and this can only be considered a poetical myth of the Creation.</p>  
<p>This legend is part of the sixteenth tablet of the series on evil spirits; but the tablet contains other matters as well, the legend apparently being only quoted in it. There is another remarkable legend of the same sort on another tablet of this series</p>  
<p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></A></p>  
<p>published in "Cuneiform Inscriptions," vol. iv. p. 15. The whole of this series concerns the wanderings of the god Merodach, who goes about the world seeking to remove curses and spells, and in every difficulty applying to his father Hea to learn how to combat the influence of the evil spirits, to whom all misfortunes were attributed.</p>
