<TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/12301.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"></TD></TR></TABLE> THE tablets recording this story (which I formerly called the "war of the gods") are five in number, but I have only discovered a few fragments of them. From the indications presented by these fragments I believe the first four tablets had each four columns of writing, and the fifth tablet was a smaller one of two columns to contain the remainder of the story.</p>  
<p>The god whose exploits are principally recorded bears a name which I read with much hesitation as Lubara or Dabara and whom I conjecture on some doubtful grounds to be a form of the god Ninip.</p>  
<p><a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></A></p>  
<p>The passages I have given in my "History of Assurbanipal" and in "Assyrian Discoveries," pp. 339, 340, 343, serve to show that this deity was the god of pestilence, or the personification of the plague, and the passage in the Deluge table ("Assyrian Discoveries," p. 192, l. 20), shows this name with the same meaning.</p>  
<p>My reading Lubara is taken from the passage, "Cuneiform Inscriptions," vol. ii. p. 25, l. 13.</p>  
<p>Lubara has a companion deity named Itak who marches before him, and seven gods who follow him in his destructive course.</p>  
<p>The point of the story in these tablets appears to be, that the people of the world had offended Anu god of heaven, and that deity ordered Lubara to go forth and strike the people with the pest. It is evident here that exactly the same views prevailed in Babylonia as those among the Jews, visitations from pestilence or famine being always supposed to be sent by the deity in punishment for some sin.</p>  
<p>The whole of this series of tablets may be described as a poetical picture of the destruction caused by a plague, sweeping over district after district, and destroying everything before it.</p>  
<p>The fragment which appears to me to come first in the series is a very mutilated portion of a tablet, containing parts of three columns of writing. Only a fragment of the first column is perfect enough to translate, and the characters on this are so worn that the translation cannot be other than doubtful. It appears to read</p>  
<p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></A></p>  
<p>1. to capture he was turned . . . .</p>  
<p>2. the fifth time . . . . above and below seeking</p>  
<p>3. seven I? say? strengthened . . . .</p>  
<p>4. the words of the account of the seven gods all of them Anu heard and</p>  
<p>5. he said? to them also to Lubara the warrior of the gods may thy hand move</p>  
<p>6. like of the people of the nations their pit . . . . he will strike</p>  
<p>7. set thy heart also to make a destruction</p>  
<p>8. the people of the dark races to ruin thou shalt strike with the desolation of the god Ner</p>  
<p>9. and thy weapon against their swords may thy hand move</p>  
<p>10. slay them and cast down their weapons.</p>  
<p>11. He said to Lubara do thou go and</p>  
<p>12. thy . . . . like an old man, thy son name? afterwards?</p>  
<p>13. like a slaughter in the house, name in the house,</p>  
<p>14. against the seat devised . . . .</p>  
<p>15. like in war not . . . .</p>  
<p>This passage appears to describe the forthcoming</p>  
<p>destruction, the god Anu commanding the slaughter. The next fragment is of a different character, but</p>  
<p>appears from its style to belong to this series.</p>  
<p>1. . . . . he. . . .</p>  
<p>2. . . spake to him and he . . . .</p>  
<p>3. . . spake to him and he learned? . . .</p>  
<p>4. Anu at the doing of Hea . .</p>  
<p><a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></A></p>  
<p>5. the gods of heaven and earth all there were who thus answered</p>  
<p>6. his will which was like the will of Anu who . . .</p>  
<p>7. . . . . extending from the horizon of heaven to the top of heaven</p>  
<p>8. . . . . looked and his fear he saw</p>  
<p>9. . . . . Anu who hand? over him . . . . made</p>  
<p>10. . . . of Hea his calamity made</p>  
<p>11. . . . . strong to later days to . . . .</p>  
<p>12. . . . . sin of mankind</p>  
<p>13. . . . . triumphantly the net . . he broke</p>  
<p>14. . . . . to heaven he ascended, she thus</p>  
<p>15. . . . . 4,021 people he placed</p>  
<p>16. . . . . the illness which was on the body of the people he placed</p>  
<p>17. . . . . the illness the goddess of Karrak made to cease</p>  
<p>The next portion of the legend is a considerable part of one of the tablets, probably the fourth, all four columns of writing being represented. There are many curious points in this tablet, beside the special purpose of the legend, such as the peoples enumerated in the fourth column, the action of the gods of the various cities, &amp;c.</p>

<p>32. To that city I send thee, thou man</p>

<p>34. Small and great at once cast down and</p>

<p>41. their corpses like the pouring down of rain thou dost cast down in the vicinity of the city,</p>  
<p>42. and their treasures thou openest, thou dost sweep into the river.</p>  
<p>43. The great lord Merodach saw and angrily spoke,</p>

<p>17. and afterwards may the people of Akkad increase, and</p>  
<p>18. the whole of them may they destroy, and fight against them.</p>  
<p>19. The warrior Lubara to Itak who goes before him a word spake:</p>  
<p>20. Go also Itak, in the word thou hast spoken do according to all thy heart.</p>  
<p>21. Itak to the land of Syria set his face,</p>  
<p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></A></p>  
<p>22. and the seven warrior gods unequalled</p>

<p>Fifth tablet of the exploits of . . . .</p>  
<p>Here we see a picture of Oriental feeling with reference to natural phenomenon or disaster to mankind.</p>  
<p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> It is supposed that some deity or angel stands with a sword over the devoted people and sweeps them into eternity.</p>  
<p>What these Babylonians had been guilty of the record is not perfect enough to show. The first fragment shows the anger of Anu at their sin or supposed sin and his command to Lubara to take his weapon, slay the people, and desolate the land like the God Ner. This god Ner was a legendary being believed in at the time of Izdubar, who is mentioned as having a terrible name and being with Etana a dweller in Hades.</p>  
<p>The next fragment exhibits the goddess of Karrak as healing the illness of some of the people, 4102 being mentioned as struck with disease.</p>  
<p>In the next and largest fragment the story becomes a little more connected, it commences with a description of preparation for battle, and goes on through speeches and actions to describe the course of Lubara and his plague over Babylon, where he spares neither chief nor slave, and enters even the palace. It is supposed in lines 29&#8211;31 that the sin of the Babylonians arose from the chief priest or governor of the city arming the troops and sending them out to plunder the people. For this the plague is sent, and its progress is graphically described. The next city visited belongs to Shamas, being either Larsa, or Sippara, and then the plague reaches Erech. The character of this city is described, the Venus worship, the women of pleasure Samhati and Harimati, the</p>  
<p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></A></p>  
<p>priests and ceremonies, and the progress of the plague over the place. Then the great god the deity of Duran comes forward and pleads for his city, calling to mind its uprightness and justice, and praying its exemption from the plague.</p>  
<p>Cutha is next mentioned in the obscure third column, and then the fourth column describes a prophecy of Lubara that there should be internal war among the Mesopotamian peoples of the sea-coast, Subarti, Assyrians, Elamites, Cosseans, Guti, Goim, and Lulubu, from all which troubles benefit should come to the Akkadians or upper Babylonians.</p>  
<p>Then according to his wish Lubara sends Itak his servant, with the seven warrior gods to destroy Syria, and Itak sweeps over the country and destroys it.</p>  
<p>The last tablet deals in generalities pointing out the action of Lubara when his praise was neglected, and telling all the glories and good that should come to those who should spread a song in honour of this deity. On the spread of a plague it is evident that the Babylonians had no better means of arresting it than to pray and praise the supposed terrible deity of the scourge, that he might sheathe his sword of anger.</p>
