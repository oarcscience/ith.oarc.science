## The Object of the Babylonian Legend of the Creation.

A perusal of the texts of the Seven Tablets of Creation, which King was
enabled, through the information contained in them, to arrange for the
first time in their proper sequence, shows that the main object of the
Legend was the glorification of the god Marduk, the son of Ea (Enki), as
the conqueror of the dragon Tiâmat, and not the narration of the story
of the creation of the heavens, and earth and man. The Creation properly
speaking, is only mentioned as an exploit of Marduk in the Sixth Tablet,
and the Seventh Tablet is devoted wholly to the enumeration of the
honorific titles of Marduk. It is probable that every great city in
Babylonia, whilst accepting the general form of the Creation Legend,
made the greatest of its local gods the hero of it. It has long been
surmised that the prominence of Marduk in the Legend was due to the
political importance of the city of Babylon. And we now know from the
fragments of tablets which have been excavated in recent years by German
Assyriologists at Ḳal'at Sharḳât (or Shargat, or Shar'at), that in the
city of Ashur, the god Ashur, the national god of Assyria, actually
occupied in texts <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](blc17.htm#fn_1) of the
Legend in use there the position which Marduk held in four of the
Legends current in Babylonia. There is reason for thinking that the
original hero of the Legend was Enlil (Bel), the great god of Nippur
(the Nafar, or Nufar of the Arab writers), and that when Babylon rose
into power under the First Dynasty (about B.C. 2300), his position in
the Legend was usurped at Babylon by Marduk.
