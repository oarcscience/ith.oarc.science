<p>1. Ti&acirc;mat made solid that which she had moulded.</p>  
<p>2. She bound the gods her children with [evil bonds].</p>  
<p>3. Ti&acirc;mat wrought wickedness to avenge Apsu.</p>  
<p>4. When ... had harnessed his chariot he went to meet Ea,</p>  
<p>5. Ea hearkened to his story,</p>  
<p>6. He was sorely afflicted and abode in sorrow,</p>  
<p>7. The days were long, his wrath died down.</p>  
<p>8. He went his way to the dwelling of Anshar, his father,</p>  
<p>9. He went into the presence of Anshar, the father who begat him,</p>

<p>10. Whatsoever Ti&acirc;mat had devised he repeated unto him,</p>  
<p>11. Mother Ti&acirc;mat who gave us birth hath sown these things.</p>  
<p>12. She hath set in order her assembly, she rageth furiously,</p>  
<p>13. All the gods have joined themselves to her.</p>  
<p>14. They march by her side together with those whom ye have created.</p>  
<p>15. They formed a band and went forth to battle to help Ti&acirc;mat,</p>  
<p>16. They were exceedingly wroth, they made plots by day and by night without ceasing,</p>  
<p>17. They offered battle, fuming and raging,</p>  
<p>18. They set the battle in array, they uttered cries of defiance.</p>  
<p>19. Ummu-Khubur,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> who fashioned all things,</p>  
<p>20. Set up the unrivalled weapon, she spawned huge serpents</p>  
<p>21. Sharp of tooth, pitiless in attack (?)</p>  
<p>22. She filled their bodies with venom instead of blood,</p>  
<p>23. Grim, monstrous serpents arrayed in terror.</p>  
<p>24. She decked them with brightness, she fashioned them in exalted forms,</p>  
<p>25. So that fright and horror might overcome him that looked upon them,</p>  
<p>26. So that their bodies might rear up, and no man resist their attack.</p>  
<p>27. She set up the Viper, and the Snake, and the god Lakhamu,</p>  
<p>28. The Whirlwind, the ravening Dog, the Scorpion-man,</p>  
<p>29. The Storm-wind, the Fish-man, the Horned Beast.</p>  
<p>30. They carried the Weapon which spared not, nor flinched from the battle.</p>  
<p>31. Most mighty were Ti&acirc;mat's allies, they could not be resisted.</p>  
<p>32. Thus she caused eleven [monsters] of this kind to come into being.</p>  
<p>33. Among the gods, her first-born son who had collected her company,</p>  
<p>34. That is to say, Kingu, she set on high, she made him the great one amongst them.</p>  
<p>35. Leader of the hosts in battle, disposer of the troops,</p>  
<p>36. Bearer of the firmly-grasped weapon, attacker in the fight,</p>  
<p>37. He who in the battle is the master of the weapon,</p>  
<p>38. She appointed, she made him to sit down in [goodly apparel]</p>  
<p>39. [Saying], "I have recited the incantation for thee, I have magnified thee in the assembly of the gods,</p>  
<p>40. "I have filled his [<i>sic</i>, read 'thy'] hand with the sovereignty of the whole company of the gods.</p>  
<p>41. "Mayest thou be magnified, thou who art my only spouse,</p>  
<p>42. "May the Anunnaki make great thy renown over all of them."</p>  
<p>43. She gave him the TABLET OF DESTINIES, she fastened it on his breast, [saying]--</p>  
<p>44. "As for thee, thy command shall not fall empty, what goeth forth from thy mouth shall be established."</p>  
<p>45. When Kingu was raised on high and had taken the heavens (literally, "the god Anutum")   46. He fixed the destinies for the gods his sons, [saying],</p>  
<p>47. "Open your mouths, let the Fire-god be quenched,</p>  
<p>48. "He who is glorious in battle and is most mighty shall do great deeds."</p>  
<p>49. When Anshar heard that Ti&acirc;mat was stirred mightily,</p>  
<p>50. ... he bit his lips</p>  
<p>51. ... his mind was not at peace</p>  
<p>[Lines 52-54 too fragmentary for translation.]</p>  
<p>An'shar then addresses Ea and says:--</p>  
<p>55. "Thou hast slain Mummu and Apsu</p>  
<p>56. "But Ti&acirc;mat hath exalted Kingu--where is the one who can meet her?</p>  
<p>[Lines 57 and 58 imperfect; lines 59-71 wanting.]</p>  
<p>72. Anshar spake a word unto his son [Anu]:--</p>  
<p>73. "... this is a difficulty, my warrior</p>  
<p>74. "Whose power is exalted, whose attack cannot be stayed,</p>  
<p>75. "Go and stand thou in the presence of Ti&acirc;mat,</p>  
<p>76. "That her spirit [be quieted], her heart softened.</p>  
<p>77. "But should she not hearken unto thy word,</p>  
<p>78. "Speak thou our word unto her so that she may be abated."</p>  
<p>79. [Anu] heard the order of his father Anshar.</p>  
<p>80. He took the straight road to her, and hastened on the way to her.</p>  
<p>81. Anu drew nigh, he searched out the plan of Ti&acirc;mat,</p>  
<p>82. He could not prevail against her, he turned back.</p>  
<p>Lines 83 and 84 contain Anu's report to Anshar, but they are too fragmentary to translate; line 85 reads:--</p>  
<p>83. He (Anu) went to his father Anshar who begat him,</p>  
<p>84. He spake unto him a word [concerning Ti&acirc;mat]</p>  
<p>85. [She laid] hands upon me that withered me up."</p>  
<p>86. Anshar was distressed, he looked down upon the ground,</p>  
<p>87. He turned pale; towards Ea he lifted up his head.</p>  
<p>88. All the Anunnaki assembled at their posts.</p>  
<p>89. They shut their mouths, they sat in lamentation.</p>  
<p>90. [They said], "Nowhere is there a god who can attack Ti&acirc;mat.</p>  
<p>91. "He would not escape from Ti&acirc;mat's presence with his life."</p>  
<p>92. The Lord Anshar, the Father of the gods, [spake] majestically,</p>  
<p>93. He lifted up his heart, he addressed the Anunnaki, [saying]</p>  
<p>94. "He whose [strength] is mighty [shall be] an avenger for [us]</p>  
<p>95. "The ... in the strife, Marduk the Hero."</p>  
<p>96. Ea called Marduk to the place where he gave oracles,</p>  
<p>97. Marduk came and according to his heart he addressed him,</p>  
<p>98. [Saying], "O Marduk, hear the counsel and advice of thy father,</p>  
<p>99. "Thou art the son who refresheth his heart,</p>  
<p>100. "Draw nigh and enter the presence of An-shar,</p>  
<p>101. "Stand there [with joy], when he looketh upon thee he will be at rest."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>113. The Lord [Marduk] rejoiced at the word of his father,</p>  
<p>114. He approached and took up his place before Anshar.</p>  
<p>115. Anshar looked upon him and his heart was filled with gladness.</p>  
<p>116. He (<i>i.e.</i>, Anshar) kissed his (Marduk's) lips, and his (Anshar's) fear was removed. [Then Marduk said]</p>  
<p>117. "My father, let not the opening of thy mouth be closed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A></p>  
<p>118. "I will go, I will make to take place all that is in thy heart.</p>  
<p>119. "Anshar, let not the opening of thy mouth be closed,</p>  
<p>120. "I will go, I will make to take place all that is in thy heart." [Anshar says to Marduk]</p>  
<p>121. "What man is the cause of the battle which made thee go forth</p>  
<p>122. "... Ti&acirc;mat, who is a woman, pursueth thee with weapons.</p>  
<p>123. "Rejoice our [hearts] and make us glad.</p>  
<p>124. "Thou thyself shalt soon trample upon the neck of Ti&acirc;mat,</p>  
<p>125. "Rejoice our [hearts] and make us glad.</p>  
<p>126. "Thou thyself shalt soon trample upon the neck of Ti&acirc;mat.</p>  
<p>127. "My son, who dost comprehend everything,</p>  
<p>128. "Cast deep sleep upon Ti&acirc;mat with thy holy spell.</p>  
<p>129. "Betake thyself to thy march with all speed.</p>  
<p>130. "..."</p>  
<p>131. The Lord [Marduk] rejoiced at the word of his father,</p>  
<p>132. His heart leaped with joy, to his father he spake, [saying],</p>  
<p>133. "O Lord of the gods, Overlord of the Great Gods,</p>  
<p>134. "Should I as your avenger</p>  
<p>135. "Slay Ti&acirc;mat and bestow life upon you,</p>  
<p>136. "Summon a meeting, proclaim and magnify my position,</p>  
<p>137. "Sit ye down together in friendly fashion in Upshukkinaku.</p>  
<p>138. "Let me issue decrees by the opening of my mouth even as ye do.</p>  
<p>139. "Whatsoever I bring to pass let it remain unaltered,</p>  
<p>140. "That which my mouth uttereth shall never fail or be brought to nought."</p>
