### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[1](blc01.htm#fr_0) See the *Transactions*, Vol.
IV, Plates I-VI, London, 1876.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[2](blc03.htm#fr_1) See the duplicate fragments
described in the Index to Ebeling, *Keilschrifttexte aus Assur*,
Leipzig, 1919 fol.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[3](blc04.htm#fr_2) The text is found on a tablet
from Abû Habbah, Brit. Mus., No. 93,014 (82-5-22, 1048).

<span id="fn_3"></span>[4](blc05.htm#fr_3) APSÛ. It is doubtful if APSÛ
here really means the great abyss of waters from out of which the world
was called. It was, more probably, a ceremonial object used in the cult
of the god, something like the great basin, or "sea," in the court of
the temple of King Solomon, mentioned in I Kings, vii, 23; 2 Kings, xxv,
13, etc.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[5](blc05.htm#fr_4) This is a name under which
Marduk was worshipped at Eridu.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[6](blc06.htm#fr_5) The god whose head was taken
off was not Belus, as is commonly thought, but the god who the cuneiform
texts tell us was called "Kingu."

<span id="fn_6"></span>[7](blc06.htm#fr_6) The god whose head was taken
off was not Belus, as is commonly thought, but the god who the cuneiform
texts tell us was called "Kingu."

<span id="fn_7"></span>[8](blc07.htm#fr_7) *Muallidat gimrishun* <span
id="img_c017"></span> ![](img/c017.png).

<span id="fn_8"></span>[9](blc07.htm#fr_8) It is probable that the idea
of this Tablet is perpetuated in the "Preserved Tablet" of the Ḳur'ân
(Surah x, 62), on which the destiny of every man was written at or
before the creation of the world. Nothing that is written (*maktûb*)
there can be erased, or altered, or fail to take effect.

Or perhaps the "belly of Tiâmat." The Egyptians distinguished a portion
of the heavens by the name of "Khat Nut," "the belly of Nut," <span
id="img_h002"></span> ![](img/h002.png) and two drawings of it are
extant. The first shows an oval object rimmed with stars and the other a
pear-shaped object, with a god inside it. (See Brugsch, *Inschriften
(Astronomische)* Leipzig, 1883, p, 146.)

<span id="fn_11"></span>[12](blc07.htm#fr_11) This is the original of
the Syriac word for the Signs of the Zodiac *malwâshê* (plural of
*malwâshâ)*. The Syrians added to it an *m*, thus giving it a
participial form.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[13](blc07.htm#fr_12) Δεκανοί also called
πρόσωπα, ὡροσκόποι, φύλακες and ἐπίσκοποι. They were well known to the
Egyptians, who, as early as the fourteenth century B.C., possessed a
full list of them. See Lepsius, *Chronologie*, Berlin, 1848, and
Brugsch, *Thesaurus (Astronomische und Astrologische Inschriften)*,
Leipzig, 1883.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[14](blc07.htm#fr_13) Formerly known as Ninip.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[15](blc07.htm#fr_14) See Naville, *La Litanie
du Soleil*, Paris, 1875, Plate ii ff.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[16](blc07.htm#fr_15) See *Kur'ân*, Surah vii,
v. 179. That there were ninety-nine Beautiful Names of God rests on the
authority of Abû Hurairah, who repeats the statement as made by Muhammad
the Prophet.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[17](blc07.htm#fr_16) Published by King,
*Cuneiform Texts*, Part XXV, Plate 50.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[18](blc07.htm#fr_17) Thus he is equated with
En-Urta, Nergal, En-lil, Nabû, Sin, Shamash, Adad, etc.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[19](blc07.htm#fr_18) See Poebel, *Historical
Texts*, No. 1.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[20](blc07.htm#fr_19) See King, *Cuneiform
Texts*, Part XIII, Plate 33; and Ebellog, *Assurtexte*, I, No. 6.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[21](blc07.htm#fr_20) The *biru* was the
distance which a man would travel in two hours.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[22](blc08.htm#fr_21) This translation is made
from transcripts of the British Museum fragments (*Cuneiform Texts*,
Part XIII), and transcripts of the Berlin fragments (Ebeling,
*Keilschrifttexte aus Assur*, Nos. 117, 118).

<span id="fn_22"></span>[23](blc08.htm#fr_22) The name of an object was
the object itself, and it was believed that nothing could exist apart
from its name.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[24](blc08.htm#fr_23) Tiâmat's wrath was roused
by Apsu, who had proposed to slay the gods, her children. She took no
part in the first struggle of Apsu and Mummu against the gods, and only
engaged in active hostilities to avenge Apsu.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[25](blc08.htm#fr_24) Literally, "they excited
themselves to hostility."

<span id="fn_25"></span>[26](blc08.htm#fr_25) A title of Tiâmat.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[27](blc08.htm#fr_26) These nine monsters with
the Weapon (Thunderbolt?) and Kingu form the Eleven Allies of Tiâmat,
and it is clear that she and her Allies represent the Twelve Signs of
the Zodiac. When Marduk destroyed Tiâmat and her associates, he found it
necessary to fix the stars, the images of the great gods, in their
places, as the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. (See the Fifth Tablet of
Creation, p. 55.)

<span id="fn_27"></span>[28](blc08.htm#fr_27) The god here alluded to is
Mardak, who, in one aspect, is a fire-god; see Tablet IV, II. 39, 40.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[29](blc09.htm#fr_28) See above.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[30](blc09.htm#fr_29) Lines 83, 84, 88-101 are
translated from the British Museum fragments and the Berlin fragments;
lines 88-101 contain the equivalent to the whole gap in the British
Museum tablet.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[31](blc09.htm#fr_30) *i.e.*, "let what thou
sayest prevail."

<span id="fn_31"></span>[32](blc11.htm#fr_31) *I.e.*, the destruction of
Tiâmat.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[33](blc11.htm#fr_32) *I.e.*, the establishing
of a new creation to take the place of the old.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[34](blc11.htm#fr_33) The meaning of <span
id="img_c033"></span> ![](img/c033.png) *pal-a* is unknown.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[35](blc11.htm#fr_34) This equipment of the
charioteer is shown on the bas-reliefs.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[36](blc11.htm#fr_35) Compare Psalms xviii,
7-15; civ, i ff.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[37](blc11.htm#fr_36) *I.e.*, the gods were
impatient to begin the fight.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[38](blc11.htm#fr_37) By impressing his seal on
the Tablet Marduk proved his ownership of the Tablet, and made his claim
to it legal.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[39](blc11.htm#fr_38) This is an oblique way of
saying that Marduk succeeded where Ea failed.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[40](blc11.htm#fr_39) The word is *kupu*,
*i.e.*, "reed" or "sedge." It is possible that Marduk skinned Tiâmat.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[41](blc13.htm#fr_40) Reading, *ishtenish lu
kuppudu-ma ana shina lu uzizu*.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[42](blc13.htm#fr_41) *I.e.*, "to cause the gods
to be content,"

<span id="fn_42"></span>[43](blc13.htm#fr_42) Literally "they
(indefinite) opposed me."

<span id="fn_43"></span>[44](blc13.htm#fr_43) See *Cuneiform Texts*,
Part XXIV, Plate 50, where it is said that the god Sin is "Marduk, who
maketh bright the night."

<span id="fn_44"></span>[45](blc13.htm#fr_44) Lines 44 and 45 announce
Marduk's determination to build Babylon.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[46](blc13.htm#fr_45) This is the word commonly
used for "temple-tower." The famous ziggurat of E-Sagila here mentioned
was built in Seven Stages or Steps, each probably having its own
distinctive colour. It was destroyed probably soon after the capture of
Babylon by Cyrus (539 B.C.) and when Alexander the Great reached Babylon
he found it ruins.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[47](blc13.htm#fr_46) This is the first known
mention of the "horns" of a ziggurat, and the exact meaning of the word
is doubtful.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[48](blc13.htm#fr_47) From this text it seems
clear that Up-shukkinaku was the name of a chamber in the temple of
E-Sagila. This name probably means the "chamber of the shakkanaku,"
*i.e.*, the chamber in which the governor of the city (*shakkanaku*)
went annually to embrace the hands of the god Bel-Marduk, from whom he
thereby received the right of sovereignty over the country.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[49](blc14.htm#fr_48) This line seems to imply
that Marduk was regarded as the instructor of the "old" gods; the
allusion is, probably, to the "ways" of Anu, Bel and Ea, which are
treated as technical terms in astrology.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[50](blc14.htm#fr_49) Here the title
"Black-headed" refers to all mankind, but it is sometimes used by the
scribes to distinguish the population of the Euphrates Valley from
foreign peoples of light complexions.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[51](blc14.htm#fr_50) Compare the language of
the Kur'ân (Surah II, v. 256), "He (Allah) knoweth what is before them
and what is behind them."

<span id="fn_51"></span>[52](blc14.htm#fr_51) These lines suggest that
the fight between Marduk and Tiâmat was recurrent; it is incorrect to
translate the verbal forms as preterites.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[53](blc15.htm#fr_52) "To open the ears" -- to
give understanding.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[54](blc16.htm#fr_53) The Egyptian Sheta <span
id="img_h004"></span> ![](img/h004.png)
