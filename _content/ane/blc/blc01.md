## Discovery of the Tablets.

The baked clay tablets and portions of tablets which describe the views
and beliefs of the Babylonians and Assyrians about the Creation were
discovered by Mr. (later Sir) A.H. Layard, Mormuzd Rassam and George
Smith, Assistant in the Department of Oriental Antiquities in the
British Museum. They were found among the ruins of the Palace and
Library of Ashur-bani-pal (B.C. 668-626) at Ḳuyûnjiḳ (Nineveh), between
the years 1848 and 1876. Between 1866 and 1870, the great "find" of
tablets and fragments, some 20,000 in number, which Rassam made in 1852,
was worked through by George Smith, who identified many of the
historical inscriptions of Shalmaneser II, Tiglath-Pileser III, Sargon
II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and other kings mentioned in the Bible, and
several literary compositions of a legendary character, fables, etc. In
the course of this work he discovered fragments of various versions of
the Babylonian Legend of the Deluge, and portions of several texts
belonging to a work which treated of the beginning of things, and of the
Creation. In 1870, Rawlinson and Smith noted allusions to the Creation
in the important tablet K.63, but the texts of portions of tablets of
the Creation Series at that time available for study were so fragmentary
that it was impossible for these scholars to find their correct
sequence. During the excavations which Smith carried out at Ḳuyûnjiḳ in
1873 and 1874 for the proprietors of the *Daily Telegraph* and the
Trustees of the British Museum, he was, he tells us, fortunate enough to
discover "several fragments of the Genesis Legends." In January, 1875,
he made an exhaustive search among the tablets in the British Museum,
and in the following March he published, in the *Daily Telegraph* (March
4th), a summary of the contents of about twenty fragments of the series
of tablets describing the creation of the heavens and the earth. In
November of the same year he communicated to the Society of Biblical
Archaeology <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](blc17.htm#fn_0) copies of:--(1)
the texts on fragments of the First and Fifth Tablets of Creation; (2) a
text describing the fight between the "Gods and Chaos"; and (3) a
fragmentary text which, he believed, described the Fall of Man. In the
following year he published translations of all the known fragments of
the Babylonian Creation Legends in his "Chaldean Account of Genesis"
(London, 1876, 8vo, with photographs). In this volume were included
translations of the Exploits of Gizdubar (Gilgamish), and some early
Babylonian fables and legends of the gods.
