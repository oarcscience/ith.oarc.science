#### No. IV <span id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_180)

1\. To Dûdu <span id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_181) my lord, my father,  
2. I speak, even Aziru <span id="fr_182"></span>[3](#fn_182) thy son,
thy servant;  
3. at the feet of my father I prostrate myself;  
4. unto the feet of my father may there be peace!  
5. O Dûdu, now \[the daughter (?)\]  
6. \[of the king (?)\] my lord, Gama …  
7. …… the foundation  
8. of the palace of my lord the king has been laid  
9. and for a temple I have founded (it).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

10\. This I have done: as for thee there is none (else)  
11. my father; and now the plantations,  
12. O Dûdu, my father, set in the ground,  
13. and I will look after the girl.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

14\. \[And\] thou (art) my father and my lord.  
15. \[Verily\] I will look after the girl; the kings of the <span
class="smallcaps">Amorites</span> (?) <span
id="fr_183"></span>[4](#fn_183)  
16. \[are\] thy … and my house (is) from  

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

17\. … and the planting  
18. I have directed and …  
19. the planting I have accomplished.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

20\. \[And\] thou to the presence  
21. of my \[lord\], in the companionship  
22 the foundation-stones of the palace I laid.

*The next nine lines are too mutilated for translation*.

32\. \[And\] I (am) the servant of the king my lord,  
33. \[who comes\] from (fulfilling) the orders of the king my lord  
34. \[and\] from (fulfilling) the orders of Dûdu my father.  
35. I observe \[all of them\] until his return.  
36 he sends \[a messenger\],

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_180"></span>[66:1](rp20216.htm#fr_180) No. IX in my
forthcoming Paper.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[66:2](rp20216.htm#fr_181) The Biblical Dodo
(Judg. x. 1, 2 Sam. xxiii. 24, 1 Chr. xi. 12, 26) or Dod. The name
punctuated David is also written Dod. Hitherto the name has not been
found outside the Bible and the Moabite Stone (where king Mesha states
that he carried away the *arels* or "heroes" of Yahveh and Dodah),
though the name of the Carthaginian goddess Dido shows that it also
existed in Phœnician. According to an Assyrian list of deities Dadu was
the name given to Hadad or Rimmon in Phœnicia and Palestine, thus
explaining the name of Bedad or Ben-Dad, "the son of Dad," the name of
an Edomite king (Gen. xxxvi. 35). In Assyrian Dadu, "the beloved one,"
was an epithet applied to Tammuz the Sun-god.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[66:3](rp20216.htm#fr_182) The Biblical Ezer.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[66:4](rp20216.htm#fr_183) The word is *Amuri*,
which denotes the Amorites of northern Syria in other tablets of the
collection, where, however, it is preceded by the determinative of
country or people. It is therefore possible that here it is the first
person of an Assyrian verb "I have seen."
