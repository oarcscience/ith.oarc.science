2. speak thus:  
3. Thy servant \[says\], even Arudi: <span
id="fr_175"></span>[3](#fn_175)  
4. \[at the feet of the king\] seven times seven do I prostrate
myself.  
5. \[Thy\] servant (?) … (when) a raid was made

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_174"></span>[65:2](rp20215.htm#fr_174) No. III in my Paper
on "Babylonian Tablets from Tel el-Amarna" published in the *Proceedings
of the Society of Biblical Archæology*, June 1888.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[65:3](rp20215.htm#fr_175) The name may also be
read Aruki.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[65:4](rp20215.htm#fr_176) Marratim means the
"sea-marshes" in Assyrian, and was specially applied to the marsh-lands
in the south of Babylonia (whence the Merathaim of Jer. l. 21). The
scribe has transformed the title of the prince "the king (*melech* or
*milki*) the son of the salt-marshes" into two proper names, Milki and
Marratim.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[65:5](rp20215.htm#fr_177) *Gaturri*-ki. Gedor
(Josh. xv. 58, 1 Chr. xii. 7, 2) is the modern Gedûr north of Hebron.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[65:6](rp20215.htm#fr_178) "Of the princes."
The scribe, however, seems to have meant Rabbah, "the capital,"
mentioned in Josh. xv. 60.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[65:7](rp20215.htm#fr_179) The Aramaic *marê*,
"lord." We learn from coins that Marnas was the title of the supreme god
of Gaza.
