<p>[<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Royal</span> offering to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Osiris</span> the lord of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Busiris</span>] in order that there may be given to him a revenue in bread and liquors, at every festival and each day, with an abundance [of everything, a thousand loaves], a thousand cups of beer, a thousand oxen, a thousand geese, a thousand ducks, a thousand fowls, a thousand birds, a thousand cloths, a thousand [pieces of linen, for] the prefect of the country of the south, the guardian of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nekhni</span>, the dictator of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nekhabit</span>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> sole friend, feudal vassal of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Osiris Khontamentit</span>, [Uni;]</p>  
<p>[He says:]</p>  
<p>[I was born under the Majesty of Unas. I was still a youth] wearing the fillet under the Majesty of Teti,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and employed as superintendent of the treasury, when I was promoted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to the inspectorship of the irrigated lands of Pharaoh. When I was chief of the secret chamber under the Majesty of Pepi, his Majesty confers on me the dignity of Friend (and) controlling prophet of his pyramid; then when [I held this office] his Majesty made me S&acirc;bu, guardian of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nekhni</span>, [for his heart] was satisfied with me above any other of his servants. I heard then all that happened, I alone with a <i>S&acirc;bu</i>, clerk to the Porte, in every secret affair, [and I executed all the writings]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> which had</p>

<p>to be executed in the name of the king whether for the harem of the king or for the residence of the Six, so that I satisfied the heart of the king more than any other of his peers, (or) of his mamelouk nobles, more than any other of his servants. [An order was also issued] by the Majesty of my lord that a sarcophagus of white stone should be brought to me from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ro&iuml;u</span>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> His Majesty sent a temple-slave in a boat with the soldiers [the hewers of the stone and the artisans] with orders to convey this sarcophagus to me from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ro&iuml;u</span>; and this sarcophagus comes with a temple-slave in a large pontoon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> from the royal administration, as well as its lid, a stele in the form of a gate, (to wit) the frame, the two middle blocks, and the threshold;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> never had anything like it been made for any other servant whatever; but it happened that my wisdom pleased his Majesty and that also my zeal pleased his Majesty and that also the heart of his Majesty was satisfied with me. Also from my being <i>S&acirc;bu</i>, guardian of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nekhni</span>, his Majesty made me sole Friend, superintendent of the irrigated lands of the Pharaoh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> over the superintendents of the cultivated lands who are there, and I acted to the satisfaction of his Majesty, both when I had to keep guard behind the Pharaoh and (when I had) to settle the royal itinerary, or to arrange the peers, and I acted in all this to the satisfaction of his Majesty above everything. When moreover one went to the royal harem to inform against the great royal wife Amitsi, secretly, his Majesty made me alone descend into it in order to listen to business, no <i>S&acirc;bu</i> clerk of the Porte being there, nor any peer except myself alone, because of (my) wisdom</p>

<p>and my zeal which pleased his Majesty, because the heart of his Majesty was satisfied with me; it was I who wrote everything down, I alone with a <i>S&acirc;bu</i> guardian of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nekhni</span>. Now my employment was that of superintendent of the irrigated lands of the Pharaoh, and there never had been any of this rank who had heard the secrets of the royal harem, in former days, excepting me, when his Majesty made me hear (them), because my wisdom pleased his Majesty more than any other of his peers, more than any other of his mamelouks, more than any other of his servants.</p>  
<p>When his Majesty carried war to the district of the nomad <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hirush&acirc;u</span>, and when his Majesty formed an army of several myriads, levied throughout the entire South, southward starting from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Elephantin&ecirc;</span>, northward starting from the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Letopolitan</span> nome,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the country of the north, in the two confines in their entirety, in each station between the fortified stations of the desert, in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arotit</span> a country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Negroes</span>, in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zamu</span> a country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Negroes</span>, In <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amamu</span> a country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Negroes</span>, in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Uaua&iuml;t</span> a country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Negroes</span>, In <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Qaau</span> a country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Negroes</span>, in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Totam</span> a country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Negroes</span>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; his Majesty sent me at the head of this army. There were generals in it, there were mamelouks of the king of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lower Egypt</span> in it, there were sole Friends of the Pharaoh in it, there were in it dictators and princes of the south and of the land of the north,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> <i>Golden</i> Friends and superintendents of the prophets of the south and of the land of the north, prefects of the confines at the head of the militia of the south and of the land of the north, cities and boroughs</p>

<p>which they governed, as well as negroes from the regions mentioned (above), and nevertheless it was I who laid down the law for them&#8212;although my employment was that of superintendent of the irrigated lands of the Pharaoh with the title belonging to my office&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#8212;so that each of them obeyed like all the rest,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and each of them took with him what he needed as regards bread and sandals for the journey, and each of them took beer from every town, and each of them took every kind of small cattle from every individual.</p>  
<p>I led them to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amihit</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sibrin&icirc;hotpu</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">U&acirc;rit</span> of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Horu Nibm&acirc;&iuml;t</span>;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> then being in this locality [I marshalled them, I regulated] everything and I counted the number of this army which no servant had ever counted (before). This army marched prosperously&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; it shattered &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> the country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hirush&acirc;u</span>. This army marched prosperously; it destroyed the country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hirush&acirc;u</span>. This army marched prosperously; it conquered their fortresses.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> This army marched prosperously; it cut down their fig-trees and their vines. This army marched prosperously; it set fire to the [houses of] the inhabitants.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> This army marched prosperously; it slew their soldiers by myriads. This army marched in peace; it led away captive&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> a very great number of the inhabitants of the country, and his Majesty</p>

<p>praised me because of this above everything. His Majesty sent me to lead this army five times, in order to penetrate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> into the country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hiru-sh&acirc;u</span>, as often as they revolted against this army, and I acted to the satisfaction of his Majesty in this above everything. Then as it was said that there were rebels among those barbarians who extended as far as towards <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tiba</span>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I sailed in ships with this army, I attacked the coasts of this country to the north of the country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hiru-sh&acirc;u</span>; then this army being on the march, I went and overthrew them all, and I slew all the rebels among them.</p>  
<p>When I was at the great House with the right of carrying the wand and the sandals, the Pharaoh Mirinr&icirc; made me governor-general of the South, southward starting from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Elephantin&ecirc;</span> (and) northward as far as the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Letopolitan</span> nome, because my wisdom pleased his Majesty, because my zeal pleased his Majesty, because the heart of his Majesty was satisfied with me: when then I was invested with the right of carrying the wand and the sandals, his Majesty favoured me therefore (giving me part of) the cattle intended for the palace; when I was in my place I was above all his peers, and all his mamelouks and all his servants, and this dignity had never been conferred on any servant whatever before. I filled to the satisfaction of the king my part of superintendent of the South, so as to be allowed to stand at his side second (in rank) to him, accomplishing all the duties of an engineer, judging all causes that there were to judge</p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></A></p>  
<p>for the royal administration in this south of Egypt, as second judge, at every hour appointed for judgment for the royal administration in this south of Egypt as second judge; regulating as governor all there was to do in this south of Egypt, and never had anything like (this) taken place in this south of Egypt before; and I did all this to the satisfaction of his Majesty accordingly. His Majesty sent me to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abha&iuml;t</span>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to bring back the sarcophagus (called) the Coffer of the Living, with its lid, as well as the true and precious pyramidion of the pyramid (called) "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kh&acirc;nofir</span> mistress of Mirinr&icirc;." His Majesty sent me to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Elephantin&ecirc;</span> to bring a stele in the form of a false door, together with its base of granite, as well as the portcullis and the framework of granite [for the passage of the pyramid], (and) to bring back the gates and the thresholds of the exterior chapel of the pyramid "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kh&acirc;nofir</span> mistress of Mirin-r&icirc;." I returned with them to the pyramid <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kh&acirc;nofir</span> of Mirin-r&icirc; in six galliots, three pontoons, three barges, (and) a man of war,&#8212;never had there been a man of war at <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abha&iuml;t</span> or at <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Elephantin&ecirc;</span>; so all things that his Majesty had ordered me (to do) were accomplished fully as his Majesty had ordered them. His Majesty sent me to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hatnubu</span>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to transport a large table of offerings of alabaster. I brought this table of offerings down [from the mountain]: as it was impossible in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hatnubu</span> to despatch (it) along the course of the current in this galliot, I cut a galliot out of the wood of the acacia-sont, 60 cubits long and 30 cubits broad; I embarked the 17th day of the third month of Shomu, and although there was no water over the sand-banks of the river I reached the pyramid <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kh&acirc;nofir</span> of Mirin-r&icirc; prosperously; I was there with [the table of offerings] without fail according to the order which the majesty of my lord had deigned to command me. His Majesty sent me to excavate five docks (?) in the South and to construct three galliots and four pontoons of acacia-sont of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Uauit</span>; now the negro princes of the</p>

<p>countries of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arotit</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Uauait</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aamu</span>, (and) <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Maza</span> felled the wood for that purpose, and I accomplished it all in only one year, the transportation to the water and the loading of large quantities of granite for the pyramid <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kh&acirc;nofir</span> of Mirin-r&icirc;;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and moreover I caused a palace to be constructed for each of these five docks (?), because I venerate, because I exalt, because I adore above all the gods, the souls of the king Mirin-r&icirc;, living for ever, because I have been (raised) above everything according to the order of which his double has given unto me, even to me who am the beloved of his father, the lauded of his mother, the magnate in his city, the delighter of his brethren, the governor in actual command of the South, the vassal of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Osiris</span>, Uni.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_3"></A><A HREF="rp20205.htm#fr_3">4:4</A> I complete the passage thus: <i>nuki iri m &acirc;n nib am sit</i>, "I execute <a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></A> every writing among them &#8230; for the royal dwelling and the dwelling of the Six," the pronoun <i>sit</i> referring to the feminine words Suten-apit and <i>Ha&iuml;t-sas</i> which are found at the end of the sentence.</P>

It is a pontoon without a mast, whose bridge is so strengthened as not to yield under the weight of the blocks of stone with which it is loaded.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_7"></A><A HREF="rp20205.htm#fr_7">5:4</A> [<i>Pirui-&acirc;a</i>, literally "the two great houses" or "palaces." Compare the designation of the Sublime-Porte.&#8212;Ed.]</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_10"></A><A HREF="rp20205.htm#fr_10">6:3</A> The term <i>hi-top</i> which I render by "dictator" or "podest&agrave;" is peculiar to the governors and feudal lords of the nomes of Upper Egypt, that of <i>Hiqa-h&acirc;it</i> or "prince" being reserved for the governors and feudal lords of Lower Egypt. The titles which follow&#8212;"Friends," "superintendents of the prophets"&#8212;are usually attached to the preceding, and confer on those who bear them religious authority over the priests of the nome which they govern.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_11"></A><A HREF="rp20205.htm#fr_11">7:1</A> Literally "by the right (<i>ni muti</i>) of my place." The phrase following is not yet so clear as one could wish. It seems to enumerate what Uni did to "make the law" (<i>iri sokheru</i>) for those who were above himself in rank and whom nevertheless he commanded.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_12"></A><A HREF="rp20205.htm#fr_12">7:2</A> Literally "to put the one of them like all his seconds."</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_15"></A><A HREF="rp20205.htm#fr_15">7:5</A> <i>Bi</i> literally signifies "to break up with the pick."</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_17"></A><A HREF="rp20205.htm#fr_17">7:7</A> I have restored the text from a passage in an inscription of Usir-tasen III, where analogous raids are described (Lepsius: <i>Denkm&auml;ler</i>, H. pl. 136, lines 14&#8211;16).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_18"></A><A HREF="rp20205.htm#fr_18">7:8</A> The expression is <i>m-sokit-onkhu</i>, literally "among those who had been struck alive," It refers us to a barbarous mode of warfare in which no prisoners were taken except those who had been struck by the stone mace,&#8212;a weapon which serves as a determinative of the verb <i>soku</i>,&#8212;and whom their wound must have left half dead on the field of battle.

Perhaps we may identify it, as Krall does (<i>Studien sur Geschichte des Alten &AElig;gyptens</i>, iii. p. 22), with the name of Tebui met with in a text at Edfu (D&uuml;michen: <i>Tempelinschriften</i>, i. pl. lxxiii. l. 2, and <i>Die Oasen der libyschen W&uuml;ste</i>, pl. xvi. <i>e</i>), which Brugsch (<i>Reise nach der Grossen Oase</i>, p. 92) does not know where to locate. If the identification is correct, we can conclude that Tebui, associated as it is with Amit and the north-east of Egypt, was a canton situated beyond Lake Menzaleh; the expedition of Uni would have been made on the lake, not on the sea. Possibly there may also be a reference to the arm of the sea which extended to the Bitter Lakes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_21"></A><A HREF="rp20205.htm#fr_21">9:1</A> A locality in the vicinity of Assu&acirc;n, where there were quarries of gray granite.</P>
