#### THE MOABITE STONE

1\. I, Mesha son of Chemosh-melech <span id="fr_554"></span>[1](#fn_551)
King of <span class="smallcaps">Moab</span> the <span
class="smallcaps">Di</span>-

2\. <span class="smallcaps">Bonite</span>. <span
id="fr_555"></span>[2](#fn_552) My father reigned over <span
class="smallcaps">Moab</span> thirty years <span
id="fr_556"></span>[3](#fn_553) and I reig-

3\. ned after my father. I made this monument to <span
class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span> at <span
class="smallcaps">Korkhah</span>. <span id="fr_557"></span>[4](#fn_554)
A monument of Sal-

4\. vation, for he saved me from all invaders, <span
id="fr_558"></span>[5](#fn_555) and let me see my desire upon all my
enemies. Omr-

5\. i \[was\] King of <span class="smallcaps">Israel</span>, and he
oppressed <span class="smallcaps">Moab</span> many days, for <span
class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span> was angry with his

6\. land. His son followed him, and he also said: I shall oppress <span
class="smallcaps">Moab</span>. In my days <span
class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span> <span id="fr_559"></span>[6](#fn_556)
said,

7\. I will see my desire on him and his house. And <span
class="smallcaps">Israel</span> surely perished for ever. Omri took the
land <span id="fr_560"></span>[7](#fn_557) of

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

8\. <span class="smallcaps">Medeba</span>, <span
id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_558) and \[<span
class="smallcaps">Israel</span>\] dwelt in it during his days and half
of the days of his son, altogether forty years. <span
id="fr_562"></span>[2](#fn_559) But there dwelt in it <span
id="fr_563"></span>[3](#fn_560)

9\. <span class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span> in my days. I built <span
class="smallcaps">Baal-meon</span> <span id="fr_564"></span>[4](#fn_561)
and made therein the ditches: <span id="fr_565"></span>[5](#fn_562) I
built

10\. <span class="smallcaps">Kirjathain</span>: <span
id="fr_566"></span>[6](#fn_563) the men of <span
class="smallcaps">Gad</span> dwelled in the land of <span
class="smallcaps">Ataroth</span> <span id="fr_567"></span>[7](#fn_564)
from of old, and built there the King of

11\. <span class="smallcaps">Israel</span> <span
class="smallcaps">Ataroth</span>; and I made war against the town and
seized it. And I slew all the \[people of\]

12\. the town, for the pleasure of <span
class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Moab</span>: I captured from there the *Arel* <span
id="fr_568"></span>[8](#fn_565) of <span
class="smallcaps">Doda</span> <span id="fr_569"></span>[9](#fn_566) and
tore

13\. him before <span class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span> in <span
class="smallcaps">Kerioth</span>: <span id="fr_570"></span>[10](#fn_567)
And I placed therein the men of <span class="smallcaps">Srn</span> <span
id="fr_571"></span>[11](#fn_568) and the men

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

14\. of <span class="smallcaps">Mkhrth</span>. <span
id="fr_572"></span>[1](#fn_569) And <span
class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span> said to me, Go seize <span
class="smallcaps">Nebo</span> <span id="fr_573"></span>[2](#fn_570) upon
Israel: and

15\. I went in the night and fought against it from the break of dawn
till noon: and I took

16\. it, and slew all, 7000 men, \[boys?\], <span
id="fr_574"></span>[3](#fn_571) women, \[girls\], <span
id="fr_575"></span>[3](#fn_571)

17\. and female slaves, for to <span
class="smallcaps">Ashtar-Chemosh</span> <span
id="fr_576"></span>[4](#fn_572) I devoted them. And I took from it the
*Arels* <span id="fr_577"></span>[5](#fn_573) of <span
class="smallcaps">Jahveh</span> and tore them before <span
class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span>. And the King of <span
class="smallcaps">Israel</span> built

18\. <span class="smallcaps">Jahaz</span>, <span
id="fr_578"></span>[6](#fn_574) and dwelt in it, whilst he waged war
against me; <span class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span> drove him out before
me. And

19\. I took from <span class="smallcaps">Moab</span> 200 men, all
chiefs, and transported them to <span class="smallcaps">Jahaz</span>,
which I took

20\. to add to it <span class="smallcaps">Dibon</span>. I built <span
class="smallcaps">Korkhah</span>, the wall of the forests and the wall

21\. of the citadel: I built its gates and I built its towers. And

22\. I built the house of <span class="smallcaps">Moloch</span>, and I
made sluices of the water ditches <span id="fr_579"></span>[7](#fn_575)
in the middle

23\. of the town. And there was no cistern in the middle of the town of
<span class="smallcaps">Korkhah</span>, and I said to all the people,
Make for

24\. yourselves every man a cistern in his house. And I dug the
canals <span id="fr_580"></span>[8](#fn_576) for <span
class="smallcaps">Korkhah</span> by means of the prisoners

25\. of <span class="smallcaps">Israel</span>. I built <span
class="smallcaps">Aroer</span> <span id="fr_581"></span>[9](#fn_577) and
I made the road in \[the province of\] the <span
class="smallcaps">Arnon</span>. <span id="fr_582"></span>[10](#fn_578)
\[And\]

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

26\. I built <span class="smallcaps">Beth-Bamoth</span>, <span
id="fr_583"></span>[1](#fn_579) for it was destroyed. I built <span
class="smallcaps">Bezer</span>, <span id="fr_584"></span>[2](#fn_580)
for in ruins

27\. \[it was. And all the chiefs\] <span
id="fr_585"></span>[3](#fn_581) of <span class="smallcaps">Dibon</span>
were 50, for all <span class="smallcaps">Dibon</span> is subject; and I
placed <span id="fr_586"></span>[4](#fn_582)

28\. one hundred \[chiefs\] <span id="fr_587"></span>[5](#fn_583) in the
towns which I added to the land: I built

29\. <span class="smallcaps">Beth-Medeba</span> <span
id="fr_588"></span>[6](#fn_584) and <span
class="smallcaps">Beth-Diblathain</span> <span
id="fr_589"></span>[7](#fn_585) and <span
class="smallcaps">Beth-baal-meon</span> <span
id="fr_590"></span>[8](#fn_586) and transported thereto the \[shepherds
(?) …

30\. and the pastors\] <span id="fr_591"></span>[9](#fn_587) of the
flocks of the land. And at <span class="smallcaps">Horonaim</span> <span
id="fr_592"></span>[10](#fn_588) dwelt there <span
id="fr_593"></span>[11](#fn_589)

31\. … And <span class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span> said to me, Go down,
make war upon <span class="smallcaps">Horonaim</span>. I went down \[and
made war\]

32\. … And <span class="smallcaps">Chemosh</span> dwelt <span
id="fr_594"></span>[12](#fn_590) in it during my days. I went up from
thence …

33\. … And I …

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_551"></span>[200:1](rp20238.htm#fr_554) The letter *m* is
doubtful according to M. Clermont-Ganneau, but no other is possible.
Chemosh-melech is a compound analogous to Elimelech.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[200:2](rp20238.htm#fr_555) Dibon is said to
have been built by Gad (Numb. xxxii. 34).

<span id="fn_553"></span>[200:3](rp20238.htm#fr_556) Probably a round
number like 40 in l. 8.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[200:4](rp20238.htm#fr_557) Most likely a
district of Dibon, perhaps alluded to in Isaiah xv. 2.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[200:5](rp20238.htm#fr_558) Smend-Socin read
‏המלכן‎ "the Kings," which would presuppose an allied force, of which
there is no further question in the inscription, nor does the Bible
mention that Mesha was assisted in his revolt by allies. The ‏מ‎ is
according to M. Clermont-Ganneau doubtful. The following restorations
are possible: 1st, ‏השלכן‎ "freebooters." Comp. ‏שלך‎, Lev. xi. 18, A.V.
"pelican," or identical with ‏השלחן‎, "swordsmen." 2d, ‏החלכן‎ "the
misfortunes" or "misery," Comp. Ps. x. 8.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[200:6](rp20238.htm#fr_559) The reading ‏כדבר‎
by S.S. is not idiomatic; ‏כזה‎ would do better. According to M. C.-G.
there seems to be the trace of a ‏מ‎ following the ‏כ‎. I propose
therefore the word \[‏מש‎\]‏כ‎.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[200:7](rp20238.htm#fr_560) According to M.
C.-G.: S. S. read "all the land;" of the word *all* there is no trace in
the inscription.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[201:1](rp20238.htm#fr_561) A city in Reuben
(Numbers xxi. 30); later belonging to Moab (Isaiah xv. 2).

<span id="fn_559"></span>[201:2](rp20238.htm#fr_562) A round number,
nearer to 40 than to 30.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[201:3](rp20238.htm#fr_563) S. S. translate:
"and Chemosh gave it back;" ‏בה‎\[‏שב‎\]‏וי‎ gives a better sense. Comp.
line 33.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[201:4](rp20238.htm#fr_564) Also
Beth-baal-meon, a city in Reuben, Josh. xiii. 17.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[201:5](rp20238.htm#fr_565) ‏אשוח‎ is perhaps
an Arabic plural form of ‏שוהח‎.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[201:6](rp20238.htm#fr_566) Kirjathaim, a city
in Reuben (Numb. xxxii. 37).

<span id="fn_564"></span>[201:7](rp20238.htm#fr_567) A city in Gad
(Numb. xxxii. 3).

<span id="fn_565"></span>[201:8](rp20238.htm#fr_568) Arel or Ariel in 2
Sam. xxiii. 20 means no doubt heroes where the A.V. has "he slew two
lionlike men of Moab;" and the R.V., "he slew the two *sons of* Ariel of
Moab." Perhaps it was a dialectic word peculiar to the trans-Jordanic
country; we find a son of Gad with the name of *Areli* (Gen. xlvi. x6;
Numb. xxvi. 57). It is used also in Isaiah xxxiii. 7, A.V. and R.V.,
"their valiant ones" (the Hebrew being *Erelam*, perhaps better
*Erelim*, "valiant ones," parallel to the following expression, "the
messengers of peace," or "messengers of Shalem," *i.e.* Jerusalem).
Possibly the word ‏אריה‎ (Isaiah xv. 9; LXX., καὶ Ἀριὴλ; A.V. "lions
upon him;" R.V. "a lion upon him"—Isaiah xxi. 8; LXX. Οὐρίαν; A.V. "And
he cried, A lion;" R.V. "and he cried as a lion;" better "the hero" or
"watchman called out") should be read *Aryah*, a compound of *Ar* and
*yah*, analogous to *Ar-el*. And so perhaps in 2 Sam. xxiii. 20. Ariel
is also the name of the stronghold (Zion) of David (Isaiah xxix. 1, 2),
and later of a part (? the Holy of Holies) of the Temple (Ezekiel xliii.
15, 16; LXX. ἀριὴλ; A.V. and R.V. altar).

<span id="fn_566"></span>[201:9](rp20238.htm#fr_569) Or Dodo, perhaps
connected with the Carthaginian Dido. The persons named Dodo in the
Bible are usually heroes (2 Sam. xxiii. 9, 24); thus we have Dodavahu (2
Chr. xx. 37) and Dodai (1 Chr. xxvii. 4), where Dodo is compounded with
Yahu. In our inscription Dodo is parallel with Yahveh (line 17).

<span id="fn_567"></span>[201:10](rp20238.htm#fr_570) A city in Moab
(Jer. xlviii. 24; Amos ii. 2).

<span id="fn_568"></span>[201:11](rp20238.htm#fr_571) Perhaps to be
pronounced Sharon.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[202:1](rp20238.htm#fr_572) Perhaps Me-Hereth;
comp. in 1 Sam. xxii. 5, the name of a forest in Moab and the prefix Me
in Me-deba (Numb. xxi. 30).

<span id="fn_570"></span>[202:2](rp20238.htm#fr_573) Most probably a
city near Mount Nebo in Moab.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[202:3](rp20238.htm#fr_575) M. Clermont-Ganneau
contests the reading of Smend and Socin. In his restoration only ‏מרן‎
and ‏מרת‎ could give a sense, viz. "Men and masters, women, mistresses"
(where ‏מרת‎ would have to be derived from the form ‏מרה‎).

<span id="fn_572"></span>[202:4](rp20238.htm#fr_576) The male divinity
of Ashtoreth, which is to be found in Himyaritic inscriptions,
compounded with Chemosh.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[202:5](rp20238.htm#fr_577) The parallelism of
line 12 requires ‏אראלי‎ here. M. Clermont-Ganneau makes too many
objections to this reading here and elsewhere.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[202:6](rp20238.htm#fr_578) City in Moab
(Isaiah xv. 4).

<span id="fn_575"></span>[202:7](rp20238.htm#fr_579) See above, line 9.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[202:8](rp20238.htm#fr_580) Literally "the
cuttings."

<span id="fn_577"></span>[202:9](rp20238.htm#fr_581) City in Moab (Deut.
ii. 36).

<span id="fn_578"></span>[202:10](rp20238.htm#fr_582) A torrent in Moab
(Numb. xxi. 13 *sqq*.)

<span id="fn_579"></span>[203:1](rp20238.htm#fr_583) Most likely Bamoth
(Numb. xxi. 19 and Isaiah xv. 2, where the right reading is perhaps ‏עלה
בית הבמות ודיבן למכי‎) Perhaps identical with Bamoth Baal (Joshua xiii.
17).

<span id="fn_580"></span>[203:2](rp20238.htm#fr_584) City in Reuben
(Deut. iv. 43).

<span id="fn_581"></span>[203:3](rp20238.htm#fr_585) I supply ‏ש‎\[‏הא
וכל ר‎\].

<span id="fn_582"></span>[203:4](rp20238.htm#fr_586) ‏מלאתי‎.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[203:5](rp20238.htm#fr_587) ‏מאת‎ \[‏רש‎\].

<span id="fn_584"></span>[203:6](rp20238.htm#fr_588) City in Reuben
(Numb. xxi. 30), afterwards belonging to Moab (Isaiah xv. 2). I read ‏בת
מידבא‎ for ‏מד מדהבא‎ of Smend and Socin.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[203:7](rp20238.htm#fr_589) Beth-Diblathaim, a
city in Moab (Jer. xlviii. 22).

<span id="fn_586"></span>[203:8](rp20238.htm#fr_590) A town of Reuben,
later belonging to Moab (Josh. xiii. 17; Jer. xlviii. 23).

<span id="fn_587"></span>[203:9](rp20238.htm#fr_591) ‏רעי‎…

<span id="fn_588"></span>[203:10](rp20238.htm#fr_592) A city in Moab
(Isaiah xv. 5; Jer. xlviii. 3, 5, 34).

<span id="fn_589"></span>[203:11](rp20238.htm#fr_593) The reading of
Smend and Socin is here too doubtful.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[203:12](rp20238.htm#fr_594) See the same
expression in line 8.
