### Footnotes

<span id="fn_203"></span>[75:1](rp20221.htm#fr_203) *Découvertes*, pl.
20. The inscription has been translated by M. Ledrain: *Communications à
l’Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres*, Sept. 14th, 1883.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[75:2](rp20221.htm#fr_204) The Sinaitic
Peninsula.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[76:1](rp20221.htm#fr_205) The first column has
been translated by Dr. Oppert: *Communications à l’Académie des
Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres*, March 1882.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[78:1](rp20221.htm#fr_206) I give the
translation of the lines which follow, as far as col. v. 1. 4,
inclusively, only with the greatest reserve.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[78:2](rp20221.htm#fr_207) The *kalû* were a
class of priests.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[79:1](rp20221.htm#fr_208) That is, a court of
justice.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[79:2](rp20221.htm#fr_209) That is, the Persian
gulf.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[79:3](rp20221.htm#fr_210) Evidently Amanus in
northern Syria.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[79:4](rp20221.htm#fr_211) The Assyrian
*urkarinnu*. For its explanation see an article by the Rev. C. J. Ball,
*Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archæology*, xi. p. 143.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[80:1](rp20221.htm#fr_212) Dr. Hommel has
proposed to read this name Dalla. I should prefer to read Tilla,
explained by Urdhu in W. A. I., ii. 48, 13.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[80:2](rp20221.htm#fr_213) It is the tree
called *ashûhu* by the Assyrians.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[80:3](rp20221.htm#fr_214) The reading is
uncertain. Dr. Hommel reads Kasalla, comparing the Kazalla of W. A. I.,
iv. 34. 31, 33.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[80:4](rp20221.htm#fr_215) Phœnicia.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[81:1](rp20221.htm#fr_216) Identified by Dr.
Hommel, with much probability, with Tidnu or "the West" (Syria and
Canaan); W. A. I., ii. 48, 12, etc.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[81:2](rp20221.htm#fr_217) Or a "city of
Abullât," or perhaps the city "Abullu-abishu," W. A. I., ii. 52. 55.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[81:3](rp20221.htm#fr_218) Perhaps "the land of
Mash" or Arabia Petræa, the Mash of Gen. x. 23. From Ki-mas was derived
the Assyrian *kêmassi*, "copper" (W. A. I., ii. 18, 54; iv. 28, 13).

<span id="fn_219"></span>[81:4](rp20221.htm#fr_219) In the vicinity of
the Sinaitic Peninsula.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[81:5](rp20221.htm#fr_220) The tree called
*ushu* by the Assyrians.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[81:6](rp20221.htm#fr_221) If this line is not
due to an error, the engraver must have omitted something between lines
27 and 28.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[81:7](rp20221.htm#fr_222) Perhaps Kilzanim is
the name of a country. In this case, the engraver must have made some
omission here.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[82:1](rp20221.htm#fr_223) \["Temple of the
West."—*Ed*.\].

<span id="fn_224"></span>[82:2](rp20221.htm#fr_224) The tree called
*huluppu* in Assyrian. \[The Sumerian name may be read *ghalup*, of
which *huluppu* would be an Assyrian modification.—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_225"></span>[83:1](rp20221.htm#fr_225) \[The Sinaitic
Peninsula and Midian.\]

<span id="fn_226"></span>[87:1](rp20221.htm#fr_226) Partially translated
by Dr. Hommel: *Die Vorsemitischen Kulturen*, p. 460.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[89:1](rp20221.htm#fr_227) Literally "his head
in his foundations."

<span id="fn_228"></span>[89:2](rp20221.htm#fr_228) *Découvertes*, pl.
9. Translated by Dr. Oppert in a *Communication à l’Académie des
Inscriptions*, June 23d 1882.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[90:1](rp20221.htm#fr_229) \[Perhaps related to
*gâgunû*, "a field."—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_230"></span>[90:2](rp20221.htm#fr_230) \[I should render:
"the quay which comes forth from the lord."—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_231"></span>[90:3](rp20221.htm#fr_231) Perhaps the name of
a canal. \[I should translate it: "the quay which runs from the white
stone of the gate."—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_232"></span>[91:1](rp20221.htm#fr_232) \[The Sinaitic
Peninsula.\]

<span id="fn_233"></span>[91:2](rp20221.htm#fr_233) Perhaps Coptos in
Egypt.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[91:3](rp20221.htm#fr_234) The Tilmun of the
Assyrians, in the Persian Gulf.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[93:1](rp20221.htm#fr_235) Perhaps the
foundation-cylinders and clay cones with dedicatory inscriptions.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[94:1](rp20221.htm#fr_236) \["The lady of the
place of the maternal deity."—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_237"></span>[94:2](rp20221.htm#fr_237) \["Young?"—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_238"></span>[94:3](rp20221.htm#fr_238) \["Fat?"—*Ed*.\]

14.

iii. 9.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[101:2](rp20221.htm#fr_243) \["Fat"?—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_246"></span>[105:1](rp20221.htm#fr_246) *Découvertes*, pl.
37, No. 3. See the inscription on a cone supposed to come from Zerghul
(W. A. I. i. 5, No. xxiii. 2). The attributes in lines 2 and 3 of the
cone oblige us to restore *dingir Ninâ*, "the goddess Ninâ," in the
first line.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[105:2](rp20221.htm#fr_247) \["The house of
light which illuminates the ship of <span
