<span class="smallcaps">Number 2</span>

This is a letter containing a complaint to the king concerning some gold
which seems to have been missing. The text is numbered K 538 in the
National Collection.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

To the king my lord, thy servant Arad-Nabû. May there be peace to the
king my lord; may the gods <span class="smallcaps">Assur</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Samas</span>, <span id="fr_523"></span>[1](#fn_520)
<span class="smallcaps">Bel</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Zirpanitum</span>, <span
id="fr_524"></span>[2](#fn_521) <span
class="smallcaps">Nabû</span>, <span id="fr_525"></span>[3](#fn_522)
<span class="smallcaps">Tasmetum</span>, <span
id="fr_526"></span>[4](#fn_523) <span class="smallcaps">Istar</span> of
<span class="smallcaps">Nineveh</span> <span
id="fr_527"></span>[5](#fn_524) (and) <span
class="smallcaps">Istar</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Arbela</span>, <span id="fr_528"></span>[6](#fn_525)
these great gods, lovers of thy rule, let the king my lord live for a
hundred years. May they satisfy the king my lord with old age and
offspring.

The gold which, in the month Tisri, the *ittu*, the prefect of the
palace, and I with them, missed—2 talents of standard gold (and) 6
talents of gold not standard—(this gold) the hands of the
*rab-danibe* <span id="fr_529"></span>[7](#fn_526) placed in the house,
he sealed it up, (and) the gold for the image of the kings <span
id="fr_530"></span>[8](#fn_527) and for the image of the king's mother
he gave not. Let the king my lord give command to the *ittu* (and) the
prefect of the palace, that they may discover the gold. The beginning of
the month is good. <span id="fr_531"></span>[9](#fn_528) Let them give
it to the men. Let them do the work. <span
id="fr_532"></span>[10](#fn_529)

 

A translation of this interesting text was contributed by me to the
first series of the *Records of the Past*, <span
id="fr_533"></span>[11](#fn_530) eleven years ago. Since that time the
text itself, with a translation, has been published by the Rev. S. A.
Smith in his *Keilschrifttexte Asurbanipals* (Heft II, plate 7, and pp.
30–33); and I also contributed

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

to the same work (p. 86), a "free" translation in English, which does
not essentially differ from that given above. These translations are
much better than that which I gave at first, the improvements being due
to the advances which have been made in the science of Assyriology since
that was published.

The principal difference in the translation occurs in the second part,
this difference being caused by translating the word *nikhidhuni* by "we
missed," instead of "sinned" or "transgressed." It is unlikely that a
man would voluntarily accuse himself of being a thief, hence this
rendering. The meaning of "to miss," however, attached to this root,
occurs in Hebrew, Job v. 24, "thou shalt visit thy fold and *shalt miss*
nothing," <span id="fr_534"></span>[1](#fn_531) so that the meaning here
proposed for the word may be regarded as quite certain.

Another text referring to the making of images will be found in S. A.
Smith's *Keilschrifttexte Asurbanipals*, Heft III, plates 12–13, and pp.
39–43.
