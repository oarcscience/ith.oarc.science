### Footnotes

<span id="fn_224"></span>[107:1](rp20126.htm#fr_225) Literally "the bann
(*mamit*) of my great gods."

<span id="fn_225"></span>[108:1](rp20126.htm#fr_226) The classical
Melitênê, now Malatiyeh, on the Euphrates.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[108:2](rp20126.htm#fr_227) This district of
Kappadokia is called "Khani the Great," to distinguish it from another
Khani near Babylon, whose king Tukulti-mer, son of Ilu-saba, dedicated a
bronze ram's head, now in the British Museum, to the temple of the
Sun-god at Sippara.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[109:1](rp20126.htm#fr_228) The Arameans.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[109:2](rp20126.htm#fr_229) The Shuhites of the
Old Testament, who extended along the western banks of the Euphrates
from the mouth of the Khabour to above that of the Belikh. "Bildad the
Shuhite" (Job ii. II) would be Bel-Dadda, Dadda, as we learn from the
cuneiform inscriptions, being a form of Hadad, the Syrian name of the
god of heaven.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[109:3](rp20126.htm#fr_230) Carchemish, the
Hittite capital on the Euphrates, between the mouth of the Sajur and
Birejik, now represented by the mounds of Jerablûs.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[109:4](rp20126.htm#fr_231) *Sugase*, borrowed
from the Accadian *’su*, "skin," and *gavsia* (whence the Semitic
*gubsu*).

<span id="fn_231"></span>[109:5](rp20126.htm#fr_232) Now Tel-Basher.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[109:6](rp20126.htm#fr_233) *Musarbibu*,
"subduer," according to M. Amiaud, who regards the word as an example of
a *parel* conjugation (*Revue d’Assyriologie*, ii. 1, p. 12).

<span id="fn_233"></span>[109:7](rp20126.htm#fr_234) Mu’sri or Muzri lay
to the north-east of Khorsabad, in the mountainous district now
inhabited by the Missouri Kurds. The tribute of a <span id="page_110">p.
110</span> rhinoceros, yak, elephant, and apes, brought by its
inhabitants to Shalmaneser II, must be explained on the supposition that
the caravan road from the east passed through it.
