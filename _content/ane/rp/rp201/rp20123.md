63\. Through the violence of my powerful weapons, which <span

fight,  
68. I took; against the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Mildis</span>, the powerful,  
69. the disobedient, I marched. Mighty mountains,  
70. an inaccessible district,  
71. (where it was) good in my chariots (where it was) bad on my feet,  
72. I crossed. At the mountain of <span
class="smallcaps">Aruma</span>,

76. Like a lion (?) the obstacles (?) in the ravines of the inaccessible
mountains  
77. victoriously I crossed.  
78. The land of <span class="smallcaps">Mildis</span> like the
flood <span id="fr_201"></span>[3](#fn_200) of the deluge I
overwhelmed.  
79. Their fighting men in the midst of battle  
80. like a moon-stone I laid low. Their spoil

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

82\. All their cities I burned with fire.  
83. Hostages, tribute and offering

85\. Tiglath-pileser, the hero, the warrior,

89\. The land of <span class="smallcaps">Subari</span>, <span
id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_201) the powerful, the disobedient,

91. and <span class="smallcaps">Purukuzzi</span>, which had withheld  
92. their tribute and their offering,  
93. the heavy yoke of my lordship upon them  
94. I laid; (saying), each year tribute and offering  
95. to my city of <span class="smallcaps">Asur</span>, to my presence,  
96. let them bring. In accordance with my valour,  
97. since <span class="smallcaps">Asur</span> the lord has caused my
hand to hold  
98. the mighty weapon which subdues the disobedient, and  
99. to enlarge the frontier of his country  
100. has commanded (me), 4000 men of the <span

102. disobedient ones, who in their strength

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_193"></span>[96:1](rp20123.htm#fr_194) This must have been
in the neighbourhood of Amid or Diarbekir. The Vannic king Menuas
mentions a Hittite city, Surisidas, in the vicinity of Alzi. Delitzsch
compares the Sareisa of Strabo.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[96:2](rp20123.htm#fr_195) *Sutmasi*. In R.
204. i. 22 *sa sammasi* is interpreted "a slinger," and in W.A.I., iv.
13, 5, *samsû* is "a sling-stone."

<span id="fn_195"></span>[96:3](rp20123.htm#fr_196) The land of Qurkhi
extended eastward of Diarbekir, along the northern bank of the Tigris.
The name is preserved in that of Kurkh, 20 miles S. E. of Diarbekir,
where there are ruins, and where a stêlê of Shalmaneser II has been
discovered.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[97:1](rp20123.htm#fr_197) Sarpina was the name
of one of the Hittite cities, whose god was invoked in the treaty
between Ramses II and the Hittite king. With the termination we may
compare that of Abar-’siuni in iv. 82.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[97:2](rp20123.htm#fr_198) The first part of
the name Sadi-anteru, which reminds us of the Lydian Sady-attês, may
contain the name of the god Sanda or Sandon. A Hittite prince mentioned
by the Vannic king Menuas was called Sada-hadas. Khattu-khi means "the
Hittite," the suffix -*khi*, as in Vannic, denoting a patronymic or
gentilic adjective. Urra-khi-nas is similarly derived from Urra, the
termination -*khi-nas*, in Vannic, denoting "the place of the people
of."

<span id="fn_198"></span>[98:1](rp20123.htm#fr_199) Literally " complete
horses."

<span id="fn_199"></span>[98:2](rp20123.htm#fr_200) *Liê*.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[98:3](rp20123.htm#fr_201) Literally "mound" or
"tel."

<span id="fn_201"></span>[99:1](rp20123.htm#fr_202) Subari, called
Subarti a few lines farther on, had been overrun by Rimmon-nirari I.
(B.C. 1330), and was afterwards conquered by Assur-natsir-pal, who
describes it as situated between Qurkhi and Nirib, or the plain of
Diarbekir. As Qurkhi lay "opposite the land of the Hittites," Subari
would have adjoined the territory of the latter people, in the immediate
vicinity of Alzi and Purukuzzi.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[99:2](rp20123.htm#fr_203) This seems to be the
same word as the Kolkhians of classical geography, though the seat of
the Kolkhians was far to the north of that of the Kaskâ. In the
classical period, however, we find that the Moschi and Tibareni (Meshech
and Tubal) had also shifted far to the north of their habitat in
Assyrian times, and like the Kolkhians had settled on the shores of the
Black Sea. A town of Kolkhis, now represented by the name of Lake
Goldshik, lay to the S. W. of Palu.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[99:3](rp20123.htm#fr_204) Uruma may be the
Urima of classical geography, the modern Urum. It is called Urume of
Bitanu by Assur-natsir-pal, Bitanu being the district south of Lake Van.
