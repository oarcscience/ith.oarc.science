### Footnotes

<span id="fn_242"></span>[116:1](rp20128.htm#fr_243) Sir H. Rawlinson
has suggested that Asur-ris-ilim is the Chushan-rish-athaim of Judges
iii. 8, a name which certainly seems to be corrupt. Chushan-rish-athaim
is called king of Aram Naharaim or "Aram of the two rivers," which
represents Mesopotamia in the Old Testament, though the Naharaina of the
Egyptian monuments was the region about the Orontes, while the Assyrian
Nahri or Nairi was primarily the district to the northwest of Lake Van,
and afterwards the country to the south of it. Assur-ris-ilim claims to
have "subdued Lullumi and all Quti (or Kurdistan) with the entrance to
its mountain-ranges" (W.A.I., iii. 3, 18); but these districts lay to
the east of Assyria, and no allusion is made to any campaign in the
west.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[116:2](rp20128.htm#fr_244) That is, the
Babylonians.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[116:3](rp20128.htm#fr_245) Literally "fulness"
(*nubalu*, akin to *nabli*, in the Cuthean Legend of the Creation, iv.
20).

<span id="fn_245"></span>[117:1](rp20128.htm#fr_246) *Pate’si*.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[117:2](rp20128.htm#fr_247) Literally "I took
its strength" (read *dannat-su*, not *libnat-su*).

<span id="fn_247"></span>[117:3](rp20128.htm#fr_248) The *tibku* was a
measure of length which is explained in the Talmud as the longer cubit
of 7 palms mentioned in 2 Chr. iii. 3.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[117:4](rp20128.htm#fr_249) Prof. D. H. Müller
believes the *pulu*-stone to have been brought from Armenia, and to have
derived its name from the Vannic *pulu-’si*, "engraved." It is also
called *pili*-stone. It was a species of white marble.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[118:1](rp20128.htm#fr_250) *Qusuda*. In
W.A.I., V. 28, 4, *gasdu* is the synonym of *allum*, the Aramaic *êlâ*.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[118:2](rp20128.htm#fr_251) *Elallâ*. It seems
to have been a stem of papyrus covered with writing.
