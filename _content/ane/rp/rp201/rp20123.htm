<P><A NAME="fn_195"></A><A HREF="rp20123.htm#fr_196">96:3</A> The land of Qurkhi extended eastward of Diarbekir, along the northern bank of the Tigris. The name is preserved in that of Kurkh, 20 miles S. E. of Diarbekir, where there are ruins, and where a st&ecirc;l&ecirc; of Shalmaneser II has been discovered.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_196"></A><A HREF="rp20123.htm#fr_197">97:1</A> Sarpina was the name of one of the Hittite cities, whose god was invoked in the treaty between Ramses II and the Hittite king. With the termination we may compare that of Abar-&#8217;siuni in iv. 82.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_197"></A><A HREF="rp20123.htm#fr_198">97:2</A> The first part of the name Sadi-anteru, which reminds us of the Lydian Sady-att&ecirc;s, may contain the name of the god Sanda or Sandon. A Hittite prince mentioned by the Vannic king Menuas was called Sada-hadas. Khattu-khi means "the Hittite," the suffix -<i>khi</i>, as in Vannic, denoting a patronymic or gentilic adjective. Urra-khi-nas is similarly derived from Urra, the termination -<i>khi-nas</i>, in Vannic, denoting "the place of the people of."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_198"></A><A HREF="rp20123.htm#fr_199">98:1</A> Literally " complete horses."</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_201"></A><A HREF="rp20123.htm#fr_202">99:1</A> Subari, called Subarti a few lines farther on, had been overrun by Rimmon-nirari I. (B.C. 1330), and was afterwards conquered by Assur-natsir-pal, who describes it as situated between Qurkhi and Nirib, or the plain of Diarbekir. As Qurkhi lay "opposite the land of the Hittites," Subari would have adjoined the territory of the latter people, in the immediate vicinity of Alzi and Purukuzzi.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_202"></A><A HREF="rp20123.htm#fr_203">99:2</A> This seems to be the same word as the Kolkhians of classical geography, though the seat of the Kolkhians was far to the north of that of the Kask&acirc;. In the classical period, however, we find that the Moschi and Tibareni (Meshech and Tubal) had also shifted far to the north of their habitat in Assyrian times, and like the Kolkhians had settled on the shores of the Black Sea. A town of Kolkhis, now represented by the name of Lake Goldshik, lay to the S. W. of Palu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_203"></A><A HREF="rp20123.htm#fr_204">99:3</A> Uruma may be the Urima of classical geography, the modern Urum. It is called Urume of Bitanu by Assur-natsir-pal, Bitanu being the district south of Lake Van.</P>
