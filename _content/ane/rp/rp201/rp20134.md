### Footnotes

<span id="fn_286"></span>[143:1](rp20134.htm#fr_288) *Lu-masi*,
literally "the twin oxen," of which seven were reckoned.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[143:2](rp20134.htm#fr_289) *Mizrâta*, which is
the same word as the *mazzarôth* of Job xxxviii. 32.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[144:1](rp20134.htm#fr_290) The mutilated
condition of the tablet makes the translation of this line extremely
doubtful. There may be a reference in it to the star Al-tar or Dapinu.
