<P><A NAME="fn_183"></A><A HREF="rp20122.htm#fr_184">93:1</A> "The Temple of the Mountain of the World," the name of an old temple in the city of Assur, which had been restored by Shalmaneser I (B.C. 1300). In early Babylonian mythology "the Mountain of the World" was the Olympos on which the gods dwelt, and which was identified with Mount Rowandiz. It is referred to in Isaiah xiv. 13, where the Babylonian king is made to say: "I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of Elohim: I will sit also on the mount of the assembly (of the gods) in the extremities of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_184"></A><A HREF="rp20122.htm#fr_185">93:2</A> <i>Isippu</i>, related to <i>asipu</i>, "a diviner," which was borrowed by the Book of Daniel under the form <i>ashshaph</i>, and may have the same origin as the name of Joseph.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_186"></A><A HREF="rp20122.htm#fr_187">94:1</A> <i>Naplu</i>, probably the same word as the Nephilim or "giants" of Gen. vi. 4 and Numb. xiii. 33. Sennacherib, in describing the construction of his palace, says: "A railing of three bronze cords and the divine Napallu I erected above it," where "the divine Napallu" probably refers to the image of a protecting deity.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_187"></A><A HREF="rp20122.htm#fr_188">94:2</A> Literally, "in drunken fashion" (<i>sutkuris</i>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_188"></A><A HREF="rp20122.htm#fr_189">94:3</A> The Meshech of the Old Testament, the Moschi of the classical writers, who in Assyrian times occupied the country to the north of Malatiyeh. In the later Assyrian inscriptions they are associated with the Tubal or Tibareni, as in the Old Testament.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_189"></A><A HREF="rp20122.htm#fr_190">94:4</A> Alzi lay on the southern bank of the Euphrates, between Palu and Khini, and included Enzite, the Anzit&ecirc;n&ecirc; of classical geography (at the <a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="green">p. 95</font></A> sources of the Sebbeneh Su). Alzi was invaded by the Vannic king Menuas, who says that it formed part of the territory of the Khate or Hittites.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_190"></A><A HREF="rp20122.htm#fr_191">95:1</A> Kummukh, the classical Komag&ecirc;ne, extended in the Assyrian age on either side of the Euphrates, from Malatiyeh in the north to Birejik in the south, Merash probably being one of its cities.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_191"></A><A HREF="rp20122.htm#fr_192">95:2</A> Literally, "I awaited not the future."</P>
