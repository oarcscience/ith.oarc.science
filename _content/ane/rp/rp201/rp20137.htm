<p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE BABYLONIAN STORY OF THE CREATION ACCORDING TO THE TRADITION OF CUTHA</h3>  <h4 align="center">TRANSLATED BY THE EDITOR</h4>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Besides</span> the story of the Creation in a series of successive acts, Mr. George Smith brought to light the fragments of two tablets containing another legend of the Creation which varied very considerably from it. The tablets belonged to the library of Assur-bani-pal at Nineveh, but the colophon informs us that they had been copied from older documents which came from the library of Cutha, now Tel Ibrahim, in Babylonia. The text has never been published, but a translation was given of it by Mr. Smith in his <i>Chaldean Genesis</i>, and a revised version by myself in the <i>Records of the Past</i>, vol. xi. As much progress has been made in cuneiform studies during the ten years which have elapsed since the latter was published, I now give another translation of the inscription, embodying the improvements which our increased knowledge of the Assyrian language has enabled me to make.</p>  
<p>The Cuth&aelig;an legend, it will be observed, knows</p>  
<p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></A></p>  
<p>nothing of a creation in successive acts. Chaos is a period when as yet writing was unknown. But the earth already existed, and was inhabited by the chaotic brood of Tiamat, imperfect first attempts, as it were, of nature, who lived in a city underground. They were destroyed, not by Merodach, the god of Babylon, but by Nergal, the patron-deity of Cutha, who is identified with Nerra, the god of pestilence, and Ner, the mythical monarch of Babylonia who reigned before the Deluge. The words of the poem are put into the mouth of Nergal, and the poem itself was written for his great temple at Cutha.</p>  
<p>The legend of Cutha agrees better with that reported by B&ecirc;r&ocirc;ssos than does the legend of the Epic. In both alike we have a first creation of living beings, and these beings are of a composite nature, the offspring of Tiamat or Chaos. In both alike the whole brood is exterminated by the gods of light.</p>  
<p>The date to which the legend in its present form may be assigned is difficult to determine. The inscription is written in Semitic only, like the other creation-tablets, and consequently cannot belong to the pre-Semitic age. It belongs, moreover, to an epoch when the unification of the deities of Babylonia had already taken place, and the circle of the great gods was complete. Ea, Istar, Zamama, Anunit, even Nebo and Samas, are all referred to in it. Possibly it may be dated in the age of Khammuragas (cir. B.C. 2350).</p>
