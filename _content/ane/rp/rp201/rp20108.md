### Footnotes

<span id="fn_39"></span>[20:1](rp20108.htm#fr_39) This was the Semitic
reading; the Accadian seems to have been Pallil.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[21:1](rp20108.htm#fr_40) May also be read
Kutmar. The word meant "a hawk" in the Kassite language.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[21:2](rp20108.htm#fr_41) "The Sappite."
