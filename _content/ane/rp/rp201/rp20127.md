<span id="fn_235"></span>[113:1](rp20127.htm#fr_236) Arazig is the
Eragiza of Ptolemy, on the Euphrates, to the north of Balis and the
south of Carchemish. Mitâni seems to be the Matenau of the Egyptians
mentioned by Ramses III immediately before Carchemish.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[113:2](rp20127.htm#fr_237) I follow Lotz in
this rendering.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[113:3](rp20127.htm#fr_238) *Ni’siggi*,
borrowed from the Sumerian *nin-’sig*, "secret."

<span id="fn_238"></span>[114:1](rp20127.htm#fr_239) Here called Mâtu,
"the god of the tempest."

<span id="fn_239"></span>[114:2](rp20127.htm#fr_240) Bel of Nipur,
called Mul-lil, "the lord of the ghost-world," by the Accadians, and
distinguished from Bel Merodach, the younger Bel of Babylon.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[114:3](rp20127.htm#fr_241) This apparently
means that the images of several deities were collected together in the
temple of the Older Bel.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[114:4](rp20127.htm#fr_242) Literally "sewers."
