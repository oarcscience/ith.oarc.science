### Footnotes

<span id="fn_369"></span>[83:1](rp20417.htm#fr_372) The translator in
the *Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archæology*, p. 71, reads
*ina sar sa kiprat arbata*, having evidently mistaken the wedges of the
plural-sign for the character for "king."

<span id="fn_370"></span>[83:2](rp20417.htm#fr_373) The Shuhites of the
Old Testament (Job ii. 11), on the west bank of the Euphrates between
the Balikh and the Khabour.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[83:3](rp20417.htm#fr_374) *Ris ini*, the
source: not *riseni*, as one word, which would be, if anything, an
anomalous plural from *risu*.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[83:4](rp20417.htm#fr_375) The Sebbeneh Su,
which forms one of the sources of the Tigris north of Diarbekir.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[83:5](rp20417.htm#fr_376) \[Or Guzan
(Gozan).\]

<span id="fn_374"></span>[84:1](rp20417.htm#fr_377) Babylonia.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[84:2](rp20417.htm#fr_378) In *W. A. I.*, ii.
58, 12, Makhir is called "the *daughter* of Samas"; but the same deity
is invoked as a male in one of the penitential psalms (*W. A. I.*, iv.
66, 2) translated by Zimmern (*Busspsalmen*, p. 100), and Sayce
(*Hibbert Lectures*, p. 355), "May Makhir, god of dreams, rest upon my
head!"

<span id="fn_376"></span>[84:3](rp20417.htm#fr_379) There is no need
here for an amendment of the text, which is plainly as follows: *sumi-ka
itti sumi-ya sudhur*.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[84:4](rp20417.htm#fr_380) The phrase *nisi
ini*, literally "the raising of the eyes," means "grace" or "favour,"
hence the object of such grace or favour, a favourite or darling
(*Liebling*, Delitzsch).

<span id="fn_378"></span>[85:1](rp20417.htm#fr_381) By separating *lu*
from the verb and giving it a temporal meaning the translator in *T. S.
B. A.* (p. 78) has missed the force of this passage, which is clearly
precative. See Delitzsch, *Assyrian Grammar*, p. 260.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[85:2](rp20417.htm#fr_382) *Ammar libbi* =
*mâla libbi*, literally "the fulness of the heart;" cp. Esarhaddon,
Hexagonal Prism, Col. iv. 41, *amtsu mâla libbi*, "I attained my heart's
desire."
