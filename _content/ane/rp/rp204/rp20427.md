### Footnotes

<span id="fn_423"></span>[117:1](rp20427.htm#fr_426) No. XXXVII of my
Memoir.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[117:2](rp20427.htm#fr_427) Khaldis was the
supreme god of Van. Each Vannic state had, moreover, its own local
Khaldis, and these local deities were collectively known as "the
Khaldises." The other divinities were regarded as the "children of
Khaldis."

<span id="fn_425"></span>[117:3](rp20427.htm#fr_428) The Air-god,
identified with the Assyrian Rimmon.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[117:4](rp20427.htm#fr_429) The Sun-god.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[117:5](rp20427.htm#fr_430) Or. perhaps
"baggage."

<span id="fn_428"></span>[117:6](rp20427.htm#fr_431) This was in the
country which adjoined the western frontier of Biainas or Van, near the
modern Melasgerd. It is called Dayaeni, or "belonging to Diaves," in the
Assyrian inscriptions. The name of Diaves is also written Diaus. In the
time of Menuas "the son of Diaus" was called Udhupursis (Sayce, xxx.
12), and it is probable that it was the same prince who opposed
Argistis.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[117:7](rp20427.htm#fr_432) Tarius, which means
"powerful," may not be a proper name. In this case we should translate:
"the powerful country."

<span id="fn_430"></span>[118:1](rp20427.htm#fr_433) Literally "5
myriads, 2695 of the men of the year."

<span id="fn_431"></span>[118:2](rp20427.htm#fr_434) Or, "for the city."

<span id="fn_432"></span>[118:3](rp20427.htm#fr_435) The inhabitants of
the Vannic kingdom.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[118:4](rp20427.htm#fr_436) If the name belongs
to the Vannic language it would signify "one who belongs to the place of
fire."

<span id="fn_434"></span>[118:5](rp20427.htm#fr_437) The name is written
Katarzas by Menuas (Sayce, xxxi. II) and also by Argistis further on
(No. VII. 48) His kingdom had the name of Lusas, and was comprised in
the country of Etius. Etius seems to have lain to the north-east of
Dayaeni, and to have represented the modern Georgia.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[118:6](rp20427.htm#fr_438) Called Udharus by
Menuas (Sayce, xxxi. 2) and also by Argistis further on (No. VII. 52).

<span id="fn_436"></span>[119:1](rp20427.htm#fr_439) We must read
*sa-a-li-e*, "year."

<span id="fn_437"></span>[119:2](rp20427.htm#fr_440) This seems to be
the meaning of the phrase *gari-ni gar-bi*. That *garbê* (with the
plural affix *bê*) signified "stones" we know from the determinative
prefixed to it.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[119:3](rp20427.htm#fr_441) *’Su*-\[*bi*\].

<span id="fn_439"></span>[119:4](rp20427.htm#fr_442) No. XXXVIII of my
Memoir.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[119:5](rp20427.htm#fr_443) Or "for the city."

<span id="fn_441"></span>[120:1](rp20427.htm#fr_444) *Khâte*.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[120:2](rp20427.htm#fr_445) Biainas, also
written Bianas, was the native name of the district in which the capital
of the Vannic kingdom stood. Through the Byana of Ptolemy the name has
passed into the modern Van. Van is now the name of the city which in
Vannic times was called Dhuspas, while Tosp, the modern representative
of Dhuspas, is now the name of the district.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[120:3](rp20427.htm#fr_446) *Khasi-al-me*, a
compound of *khasu*, "conquer," and *al*, "increase," and so meaning "to
increase conquest."

<span id="fn_444"></span>[120:4](rp20427.htm#fr_447) The Nirbi or
"lowlands" of the Assyrian inscriptions in the neighbourhood of
Diarbekir; see *Records of the Past*, new series, ii. p. 146, note 1.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[120:5](rp20427.htm#fr_448) Melidha is the
Melidi of the Assyrian inscriptions, the modern Malatiyeh.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[122:1](rp20427.htm#fr_449) This seems an
attempt to represent the name of the Assyrian king Assurdân.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[122:2](rp20427.htm#fr_450) Sayce, xxxix.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[122:3](rp20427.htm#fr_451) Dadis seems to have
derived his name from the god Dadi. As Dadi was the king of Khubuskia in
the time of Samas-Rimmon (B.C. 820), it is probable that it is his
descendants who are here referred to by Argistis.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[123:1](rp20427.htm#fr_453) We learn from the
Assyrian monuments that Bustus lay to the west or south-west of Lake
Urumiyeh. Satiraras is the Sitivarya of the Black Obelisk inscription of
Shalmaneser (line 384).

<span id="fn_450"></span>[123:2](rp20427.htm#fr_454) The Par´suas of the
Assyrian texts which was situated on the southwestern shores of Lake
Urumiyeh. The Parthians may have derived their name from it. We learn
from an inscription of Sarduris II, the son and successor of Argistis,
that Baruatais adjoined the country of Babilus.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[123:3](rp20427.htm#fr_455) Or the country of
Tarius, a proper name as in i. 8.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[123:4](rp20427.htm#fr_456) Surisilis was the
name of a Hittite city according to Menuas; see *Records of the Past*,
new series, p. 166, line 5.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[124:1](rp20427.htm#fr_457) The word perhaps
means "those who dwell by the water."

<span id="fn_454"></span>[124:2](rp20427.htm#fr_458) This must refer to
the Assyrian colonies settled in the north.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[124:3](rp20427.htm#fr_459) Not to be
identified with the Dadis of line 5.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[124:4](rp20427.htm#fr_460) *Amû-bi* connected
with *ama-ni* "half" or "share," *amas-tu-bi* "I partitioned."

<span id="fn_457"></span>[124:5](rp20427.htm#fr_461) The Mannâ of the
Assyrian inscriptions, the Minni of the Old Testament (Jer. li. 27.)
They adjoined the eastern frontier of the kingdom of Van.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[124:6](rp20427.htm#fr_462) Or Manâ, also
written Manai(s).

<span id="fn_459"></span>[125:1](rp20427.htm#fr_463) Or "war-material."

<span id="fn_460"></span>[125:2](rp20427.htm#fr_464) Usually written
Manâ.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[125:3](rp20427.htm#fr_465) Sayce, XL.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[127:1](rp20427.htm#fr_466) It appears from an
inscription of Argistis found at Armavir on the Araxes (Sayce, lxviii)
that the district which formed the satrapy of the son of Argistis was
"cut off" from the land of Lulus. It was included in the territory of
the Mana or Minni, which may, therefore, as Prof. Schrader believes,
have extended northwards as far as the Araxes and the neighbourhood of
Armavir.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[128:1](rp20427.htm#fr_467) Hazais is elsewhere
called Hazas (Sayce, lxviii. r). A later Aza, according to the Assyrian
monuments, was the son of Iranzu, king of the Minni in the early part of
the reign of Sargon.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[128:2](rp20427.htm#fr_468) *Khailâ-ni*,
probably connected with *khai-di-a-ni* and *khai-ti-ni*, "fruit," from
*khai*, "to gather in."

<span id="fn_465"></span>[128:3](rp20427.htm#fr_469) Sayce, XLI.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[128:4](rp20427.htm#fr_470) We gather from an
inscription of Sarduris II (Sayce, xlix) that Urmes lay to the
north-east, beyond Babilus and Baruatais.

<span id="fn_467"></span>[128:5](rp20427.htm#fr_471) One or more wedges
are lost at the beginning of the line, so that ten or twenty must be
added to the thousands (24,813 or 34,813).

<span id="fn_468"></span>[129:1](rp20427.htm#fr_472) That is to say, "I
took tithe of the city" for the service of Khaldis.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[129:2](rp20427.htm#fr_473) Sayce, XLIII.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[130:1](rp20427.htm#fr_474) Suras, literally
"the world," which replaces the compound ideograph "countries" in the
title "king of countries," or "provinces."

<span id="fn_471"></span>[131:1](rp20427.htm#fr_475) As Ardinis was a
Vannic word signifying "the Sun" and "the day," it is probable that the
language of Van was spoken in Etius, a country now represented by
Georgia.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[131:2](rp20427.htm#fr_476) Or "war material."

<span id="fn_473"></span>[131:3](rp20427.htm#fr_477) Called Qudhurzas
above (No. I. 18).

<span id="fn_474"></span>[131:4](rp20427.htm#fr_478) Isqigulus is shown
by another inscription of Argistis (Sayce, xlvii) to have been the
district in which Kalinsha is situated, a little to the east of Kars.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[131:5](rp20427.htm#fr_479) Called Uduris above
(No. I, 22).

<span id="fn_476"></span>[132:1](rp20427.htm#fr_480) Or "a powerful
country."

<span id="fn_477"></span>[132:2](rp20427.htm#fr_481) What is left in the
text seems to be part of the ideograph of "tablet."

<span id="fn_478"></span>[132:3](rp20427.htm#fr_482) Sayce, XLIV.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[132:4](rp20427.htm#fr_483) Literally "wall."
