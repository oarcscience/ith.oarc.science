<p>1. Shalmaneser, the great king, the powerful king, the king of hosts, [the king of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assyria</span>] &#8230;</p>  
<p>2. the pitiless one, who subjugates the rebellious &#8230; [who a rival]</p>  
<p>3. has not. The great, the incomparable, the heroic one, &#8230; [clothed]</p>  
<p>4. with splendour, who fears not opposition; [who from the rising of the sun]</p>  
<p>5. to the setting of the sun commands &#8230;</p>  
<p>6. is powerful. In those days, through the great lord, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merodach</span> &#8230;</p>  <h4 align="center">COLUMN II</h4>  
<p>1. &#8230; [After that the gods] had placed in my hands the insignia of mankind, with the help of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assur</span>, the great lord, my lord, and of the god who loves my priesthood, [I trod] the summits of all mountain-ranges</p>  
<p>2. to the extremities of them all, [as far as] the sea of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nairi</span> and the sea of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zamua-sa-Bittani</span>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the great sea of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Syria</span>. The country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hittites</span>, to its very extremities, like a mound</p>  
<p>3. swept by the wind, I ravaged &#8230; I spread over the country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hittites</span> the [terror] of the glory of my sovereignty. In my passage from the sea&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I</p>

<p>4. &#8230; I marched [to] the great [sea]; I purified my weapons in the waters; I offered sacrifices to my gods; I received the tribute of all the kings of the shores of the sea.</p>  
<p>5. &#8230; I erected [an image of my majesty beside] the sea; I wrote upon it; I set it up overlooking the sea. From the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Enzite</span> to the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dayaeni</span>, from the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dayaeni</span> to</p>

<p>1. trusted and gathered all his troops; to give combat and battle he came against me. I utterly defeated him; I cut his fighting-men to pieces. I slew with weapons 3000 of his soldiers. With the bodies of his warriors</p>  
<p>2. I filled the broad plain; I took from him his engines of war, his royal treasures (and) numerous war-material. To save his life he ascended an inaccessible mountain. Like <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hadad</span>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I overthrew the widespread land of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Qute</span>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> From the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arzashkun</span> to the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Guzan</span>,</p>  
<p>3. from the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Guzan</span> to the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khupushkia</span>, like the stormy Air-god I roared upon them.

My soldiers swooped upon them like birds of prey.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_351"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I captured 17,500 of his troops. Akhuni with his troops, his gods, his chariots</p>  
<p>6. (and) his horses, I caused to be brought before me; I carried (them) to my city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assur</span> [and settled them among the people of my own land.]</p>  <h4 align="center">COLUMN IV</h4>

They divided the country into (two) factions. Merodach-sum-iddin to ask help to Shalmaneser sent</p>  
<p>2. his ambassador. Shalmaneser, the impetuous chief, whose trust is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Adar</span>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> took the road; he gave the order to march against <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Akkad</span>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> I approached the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zaban</span>;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> victims before <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hadad</span>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> my lord</p>

<p>4. I approached. Merodach-bel-us&acirc;te, the lame king, ignorant how to conduct himself, came forth against me to offer combat and battle. I utterly defeated him; his fighting-men I slew; in his city I shut him up. His crops</p>  
<p>5. I gathered in; his plantations I cut; his river I dammed up. In a second expedition, in the eponymy of Bel-bun&acirc;ya,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on the 10th day of the month Nisan, I departed from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nineveh</span>. The Upper <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zab</span></p>

<p>1. I departed. To the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gan[na]nate</span> I approached. Merodach-bel-us&acirc;te came forth like a fox from his hole; towards the mountains of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Yasubi</span> he set his face. The city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arman</span></p>  
<p>2. he took for his stronghold. The city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gannanate</span> I captured; its fighting-men I slew, its spoil I carried away.

<p>3. I slew, his spoil I carried away. I put Merodach-bel-us&acirc;te to death with weapons. Of the miserable soldiers who (were) with him not one did I leave. When Merodach-sum-iddin had conquered his enemies, [and] Shalmaneser</p>  
<p>4. the powerful king had fulfilled the desire of his heart, he exalted thee, O great lord <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merodach</span>! Shalmaneser the king of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assyria</span> ordered the march to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Babylon</span>; he arrived at <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kutha</span>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the city of the warrior of the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p>3. the gods his lords he directed reverently his path. Strong oxen (and) fat sheep he gave in abundance. He visited all the shrines&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Borsippa</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Ecirc;-Zida</span>; each time</p>  
<p>4. he offered <i>libations</i> (?). For the men of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Babylon</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Borsippa</span>, the vassals of the great gods, he made a feast, and gave them food (and) wine; with embroidered robes he clothed (them); with presents</p>  
<p>5. he endowed them. After that the great gods had favourably regarded Shalmaneser, the powerful king,</p>
