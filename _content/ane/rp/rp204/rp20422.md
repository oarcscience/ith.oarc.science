### BABYLONIAN CONTRACT-TABLETS WITH HISTORICAL REFERENCES

#### <span class="smallcaps">By Theo. G. Pinches</span>

<span class="smallcaps">As</span> it is naturally rare to find
contract-tablets with historical references, and as, when such are
found, they possess contemporaneous authority on account of their
referring to events acknowledged to have taken place, or conditions
known to exist, either at or shortly before the date of the document
recording them, it is manifest that such documents must be of special
interest and unimpeachable trustworthiness. For this reason it has been
thought well to collect here a few of the more noteworthy of these
important texts—texts which have an additional value in that they do not
refer to events touched upon in any known history, though it is possible
that references to some of them may be found hereafter.
