### Footnotes

<span id="fn_138"></span>[27:1](rp20409.htm#fr_138) The word has nothing
to do with the pronoun *annu* as is supposed in Schrader's
*Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek*.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[27:2](rp20409.htm#fr_139) The Kassi or
Kossæans were mountaineers who lived in Elam on the eastern side of
Babylonia. They conquered Babylonia and there founded a dynasty to which
Kara-Murudas belonged.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[28:1](rp20409.htm#fr_140) The text has
-*indas*, but this is evidently an error of the scribe. Bel-nirari was
the son of Assur-yuballidh and the great-grandfather of Shalmaneser I.,
who, we learn from an inscription of Sennacherib, was reigning about
1300 B.C.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[28:2](rp20409.htm#fr_141) Or perhaps "the
child." There seem to have been three kings of the name of Kuri-galzu.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[28:3](rp20409.htm#fr_142) This can hardly be
the Subari or Subarti of the historical texts, which lay in the far
north in the neighbourhood of Diarbekir. See vol. i. p. 99, note 1.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[28:4](rp20409.htm#fr_143) Literally "caused to
be alike" to both.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[28:5](rp20409.htm#fr_144) Rimmon-nirari I. was
the grandson of Bel-nirari and the father of Shalmaneser I. We possess
an inscription of his, of which a translation has been given in the
first series of the *Records of the Past*, vol. xi. pp. 1–6.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[28:6](rp20409.htm#fr_145) Agar’sallu is a
man's name. The name of the city signifies "Fort of Istar of Agar’sal."

<span id="fn_146"></span>[28:7](rp20409.htm#fr_146) *Silim* not
*abikta*.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[28:8](rp20409.htm#fr_147) Literally "divine
elder brothers." The "reed of the divine elder brothers" is mentioned in
1266, 5.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[29:1](rp20409.htm#fr_148) *Annime*.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[29:2](rp20409.htm#fr_149) The scribe has
written *ammamate* in mistake for *ammate*.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[29:3](rp20409.htm#fr_150) It is to
Uras-pileser that Tiglath-pileser I. traces his genealogy. He was
probably the founder of a dynasty, and his date may perhaps be placed
about 1180 B.C.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[29:4](rp20409.htm#fr_151) For
Rimmon-suma-natsir see *Records of the Past*, new series, p. 16, No. 24.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[29:5](rp20409.htm#fr_152) Or
Zamama-nadin-sumi, see vol. i. p. 16, note 5.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[29:6](rp20409.htm#fr_153) We should probably
read Assur-da’an, since the chronological position occupied by the king
shows that he must be Assur-da’an the son of Uras-pileser and
great-grandfather of Tiglath-pileser I.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[30:1](rp20409.htm#fr_154) These twelve lines
come from a fragment belonging to a duplicate copy of the text.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[30:2](rp20409.htm#fr_155) The father of
Tiglath-pileser I.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[30:3](rp20409.htm#fr_156) Or "ringed
encampment."

<span id="fn_157"></span>[30:4](rp20409.htm#fr_157) Literally "aid."

<span id="fn_158"></span>[30:5](rp20409.htm#fr_158) Not a proper name
Karastu.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[30:6](rp20409.htm#fr_159) Tiglath-pileser I.
According to Sennacherib Merodach-nadin-akhi invaded Assyria in the
reign of Tiglath-pileser, 418 years before his own capture of Babylon,
and consequently 1106 B.C. If the war between Assyria and Babylonia had
been provoked by this invasion the accession of Tiglath-pileser would
fall 1107 B.C.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[31:1](rp20409.htm#fr_160) Now Akerkuf near
Bagdad.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[31:2](rp20409.htm#fr_161) Sippara was divided
into two quarters, one dedicated to the goddess Anunit, the other (now
represented by the mounds of Abu-Habba) to Samas the Sun-god. The double
nature of the city has caused it to be called in scripture Sepharvaim
"the two Sipparas" (2 Kings xvii. 35).

<span id="fn_162"></span>[31:3](rp20409.htm#fr_162) Upe was at the
junction of the Tigris and the Adhem, and was known to classical
geographers as Opis.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[31:4](rp20409.htm#fr_163) *Ikh*\[*lig*\].

<span id="fn_164"></span>[31:5](rp20409.htm#fr_164) The Shuhite tribes
to which Bildad the friend of Job belonged extended along the western
side of the Euphrates northward to the mouth of the Khabour.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[31:6](rp20409.htm#fr_165) Assur-bil-kala was
the son of Tiglath-pileser I.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[31:7](rp20409.htm#fr_166) Literally
"goodness."

<span id="fn_167"></span>[31:8](rp20409.htm#fr_167) The word *abil* is
not omitted in the original as is stated by Prof. Tiele.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[32:1](rp20409.htm#fr_168) Rimmon-nirari II,
who reigned 911–889 B.C.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[32:2](rp20409.htm#fr_169) *Silim* not
*abiktu*.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[32:3](rp20409.htm#fr_170) Or Bagdadu.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[32:4](rp20409.htm#fr_171) Northern Babylonia.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[32:5](rp20409.htm#fr_172) *Ibba*\[*nû*\].

<span id="fn_173"></span>[32:6](rp20409.htm#fr_173) Or "mound."

<span id="fn_174"></span>[32:7](rp20409.htm#fr_174) The name of a man.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[33:1](rp20409.htm#fr_175) Shalmaneser II, who
reigned 858–823 B.C.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[33:2](rp20409.htm#fr_176) Or "the king
self-appointed along with the rebel soldiers," if we read <span
class="smallcaps">im-\[gi-da\]</span> with Drs. Peiser and Winckler.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[33:3](rp20409.htm#fr_177) Now Tel Ibrahim a
little to the east of Babylon. It is called Cuth in the Old Testament (2
Kings xvii. 30).

<span id="fn_178"></span>[33:4](rp20409.htm#fr_178) Borsippa was the
suburb of Babylon which contained the great temple whose ruins are now
known as the Birs-i-Nimrud.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[33:5](rp20409.htm#fr_179) This is supplied
from an inscription of Shalmaneser.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[33:6](rp20409.htm#fr_180) Bahu-akha-iddin must
have been the name of a Babylonian king.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[33:7](rp20409.htm#fr_181) Dur-ili ("the
fortress of the god") was in southern Babylonia, near the Elamite
frontier.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[33:8](rp20409.htm#fr_182) Or Lakhiru.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[34:1](rp20409.htm#fr_183) Or Dur-Papsukal,
"the fortress of the god Papsukal." The city stood on an island in the
Tigris, and was probably not far from Gananate on the southern side of
the Dhurnat or Diyaleh (the Tornadotos of classical antiquity).

<span id="fn_184"></span>[34:2](rp20409.htm#fr_184) The Kaldi inhabited
the marshes at the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris. Under
Merodach-baladan they established themselves in Babylonia and became so
important a part of the population as to give their name to the whole of
it in classical times. Hence the Kasdim of the Old Testament are
represented by "Chaldæans" in the Authorised Version.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[34:3](rp20409.htm#fr_185) This is evidently a
quotation from the royal annals.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[34:4](rp20409.htm#fr_186) Rimmon-nirari III,
who reigned 850–781 B.C.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[34:5](rp20409.htm#fr_187) *Ik-nu-us*.
