### Footnotes

<span id="fn_480"></span>[135:1](rp20429.htm#fr_484) This had already
been done by his father Menuas, whose inscription has been copied by
Schulz and translated by myself (Sayce, xxx).

<span id="fn_481"></span>[135:2](rp20429.htm#fr_485) Sasilus is
described by Menuas as "a royal city" of the son of Diaus or Diaves, in
the country called Dayaeni by the Assyrians.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[135:3](rp20429.htm#fr_486) Literally "I
brought to my side" (*va-dia-du-bi*).

<span id="fn_483"></span>[135:4](rp20429.htm#fr_487) He is stated by
Menuas to be "a native of the city of Khaldiris," a word which signifies
"the Khaldirian" in Vannic, and shows that the Vannic language was
spoken in the place.
