<span id="fn_380"></span>[88:1](rp20419.htm#fr_383) Literally "king of
totality."

<span id="fn_381"></span>[88:2](rp20419.htm#fr_384) Igigi, perhaps
literally "the strong ones," from *agâgu*.

Air-god.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[89:1](rp20419.htm#fr_389) E-kharsak-Kurkurra
is here the name of a temple, but it had also, and originally, a
cosmical meaning as applied to the world-mountain—that is, to the world
conceived as a mountain. And the idea of a world-mountain seems to have
passed into that of a mountain in the world, or on the earth, which, as
the abode of the gods, recalls the Indian Meru. See Jensen, *Kosmologie
der Babylonier*, pp. 201–205.
