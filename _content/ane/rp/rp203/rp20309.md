### HYMN TO THE NILE

<span class="smallcaps">Translated by Paul Guieysse</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Hymn to the Nile is, properly
speaking, not a religious document like those, for example, of the
Funerary Ritual, whose history can be followed from century to century,
but a religious poem in the same sense as that in which the Poem of
Pentaur is a historical poem. It is the work of the scribe Ennana, the
author of the Story of the Two Brothers and of several other fragments
contained in the papyri of the British Museum. We possess two copies of
it in the papyri Sallier II and Anastasi VII; both texts, however, are
extremely poor. Prof. Maspero was the first to translate them in
1868, <span id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_213) and to show from an
examination of the variant readings that they must have been transcribed
from dictation by pupils in the schools of the scribes, though not from
the same original text. The translation of Prof. Maspero has often been
reproduced in works on Egypt, and Canon Cook has given a translation
which differs from it but little. <span id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_214)
In the present

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

translation notice has been taken, as far as possible, of the recent
progress of Egyptological knowledge; it will appear with a complete
transcription of the two texts in the *Recueil des Travaux relatifs à
l’Egyptologie*. <span id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_215)

The text of the Hymn is divided into fourteen verses, introduced by red
letters, and each, with two exceptions, containing the same number of
complete phrases, separated from one another by red points.
Unfortunately we are still ignorant of the rules of Egyptian poetry; but
as the variant readings show that the number of syllables in one and the
same sentence is not the same in the different texts, it is probable
that the tonic accent played a chief part in it. We find, however that
the order of the words is clearly not the same as in ordinary
prose. <span id="fr_216"></span>[2](#fn_216)

The author has developed the idea, well-known even to classical
antiquity, that the Nile is the source of all life in Egypt, that it is
the supreme god, mysterious, uncreated, the father of the gods and all
things else, into whose secrets none can penetrate. He describes in a
lofty style the benefits conferred by the Nile when it spreads its
waters over the country at its annual return, and the miseries of the
land when the inundation has not exercised its fertilising influence, as
well as the joy of the inhabitants of Egypt and their gratitude when the
Nile has answered their prayers.
