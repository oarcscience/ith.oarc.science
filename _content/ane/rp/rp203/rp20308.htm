The prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> sent his tributes and set his eldest daughter at the head of the procession, to salute his Majesty and to ask life from him. She was a very beautiful woman, who pleased his Majesty more than anything else; taking her as his chief royal wife he inscribed her with the name of Nofiru-r&icirc;, and when he had returned to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt</span> he assured to her the treatment of a royal wife.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>And it came to pass in the fifteenth year, the 22d day of the month Payni, when his Majesty was at <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span> in the temple <i>Nakhthonit-ropeu</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> chaunting the praises of his father <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amon-R&acirc;</span> the master of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Karnak</span>, during his excellent festival in southern <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the favourite residence of the god since the creation, behold a message is brought to his Majesty: "There is there a messenger of the prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> who is come with numerous presents for the royal wife." Conducted before his Majesty with his presents, he says, invoking his Majesty: "Glory to thee, O Sun of foreign peoples, to thee by whom we live," and when he had uttered his adoration before his Majesty, he proceeds to speak to his Majesty: "I come to thee, sire, my master, concerning Bint-Rashit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> the younger sister of thyself and the royal wife Nofiru-r&icirc;, for a malady penetrates her limbs. Let thy Majesty order a sage to set forth to see her." Then the king said: "Bring me the scribes of the double house of life who are attached to the palace."</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></A></p>  
<p>When they were come, his Majesty said: "Behold I have summoned you in order that you may hear these words: 'Bring me one of yourselves who is expert in his heart, a scribe skilful with his fingers.'" When the royal scribe Thothimhabi had entered the presence of his Majesty, his Majesty commanded him to betake himself to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> with this messenger. As soon as the sage had arrived in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> he found Bint-Rashit possessed of a demon, and he found the demon who possessed her difficult to combat. The prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> thereupon sent a second message to his Majesty, saying: "Sire, my master, let thy Majesty order a god to be sent to combat the demon."</p>  
<p>When the messenger reached his Majesty in the 23d year, the 1st day of the month Pakhons, the day of the festival of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amon</span>, while his Majesty was at <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>, behold his Majesty spoke again in the presence of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>, the god of good counsel, saying: "Excellent lord, behold me again before thee, concerning the daughter of the prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Then <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> In <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>, the god of good counsel, was transported towards <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs destiny, the great god who drives away strangers, and his Majesty said before the face of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>, the god of good counsel: "Excellent lord, if it pleases thee to turn thy face to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></A></p>  
<p>destiny, the great god who drives away strangers, he will be sent to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span>." And the god twice decidedly nodded assent with the head.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Then his Majesty said: "Grant unto him thy virtue so that I may send the Majesty of this god to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> in order to deliver the daughter of the prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span>." And <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>, the god of good counsel, violently nodded assent twice and transmitted his magical virtue to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs destiny in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>, four times.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> His Majesty ordered <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs destiny in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span> to be despatched on a great bark, escorted by five boats, by chariots and by numerous horses which walked on the right and on the left. When the god had arrived in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span>, after an interval of a year and five months, behold the prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> came with his soldiers and his generals before <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs destiny, and flung himself on his face, saying:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></A></p>  
<p>"Thou comest to us, thou rejoinest us according to the orders of the king of the two <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypts</span>, Usir-ma-r&icirc; Sotpu-ni-r&icirc;." Behold as soon as the god was gone to the place where Bint-Rashit was and had made magical passes over the daughter of the prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span>, she found herself well at once, and the demon which was with her said in the presence of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs destiny in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>: "Come in peace, great god who drivest away the foreigner; <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> is thy city, its people are thy slaves, and I myself am thy slave. I shall depart therefore to the place from whence I am come, in order to satisfy thy heart concerning the matter which brings thee, but let thy Majesty order a day of festival to be celebrated for me and for the prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span>." The god made his prophet a sign of approval with the head, meaning to say: "Let the prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> present a great offering to this demon." Now while this was taking place between <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs destiny in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span> and the demon, the prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> was there with his army stricken with terror. And when a great offering had been presented to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs destiny in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span> and to the demon of the prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span>, and a day of festival had been celebrated in their honour, the demon departed in peace to the place which pleased him, according to the order of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs destiny in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>.</p>  
<p>The prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> rejoiced greatly as well as the people of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span>, and he discoursed with his heart saying: "Since this god has been given to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> I shall not send him back to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt</span>." Now after the god had remained three years and nine months in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span>, as the prince of Bakhtan was lying on his bed, he saw in a dream the god leaving his shrine in the form of a golden hawk which flew on high towards <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt</span>; when he awoke he was in a shiver. Then he said to the prophet of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs destiny in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>: "This god who dwelt with us, he returns to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt</span>; let his chariot go to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt</span>!" The prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> allowed the god to start for <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt</span>, and he gave him numerous presents of all good things as well as a strong escort of soldiers and</p>  
<p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></A></p>  
<p>horses. When they reached <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> who governs destiny in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span> entered the temple of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span> the good counsellor; he set the presents which the prince of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bakhtan</span> had given him before <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span> in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>, the good counsellor, he kept nothing for his own temple. Now <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khonsu</span>, the good counsellor in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebes</span>, re-entered his temple in peace the 19th day of the month Mekhir, the 33d year of the king Usir-ma-r&icirc; Sotpu-ni-r&icirc;, living for ever like the Sun.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_205"></A><A HREF="rp20308.htm#fr_205">41:1</A> The word <i>mafkait</i> expresses emerald, green jasper, green feldspar, various oxides of copper, malachite; in short, every kind of precious stone which is naturally coloured green.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_206"></A><A HREF="rp20308.htm#fr_206">41:2</A> The daughter of the prince of the Hittites, Khiti-saru, similarly received from Ramses II on her arrival in Egypt the title of "chief royal wife" and the Egyptian name of Ma-ur-nofiru-r&icirc;, of which the name of the princess in the text is probably only an abridged form.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_207"></A><A HREF="rp20308.htm#fr_207">41:3</A> These words, which literally signify "the strong one, the lady of the temples," probably denote one of the chapels in the temple of Karnak.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_208"></A><A HREF="rp20308.htm#fr_208">41:4</A> Southern Thebes was the modern Luxor; the festival, consequently, must have been the festival of the patron deity in the temple of Luxor.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_209"></A><A HREF="rp20308.htm#fr_209">41:5</A> The name of this princess appears to be formed from the Semitic <i>bint</i>, "daughter," and the Egyptian <i>rashit</i>, "joy," the signification being "Daughter of joy."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_210"></A><A HREF="rp20308.htm#fr_210">42:1</A> In order to understand this passage, we must remember that according to Egyptian belief every statue of a god in a temple had in it a <i>ka</i> or "double," detached from the actual person of the god and so an incarnation of the god different from his other incarnations. The god Khonsu had in his temple at Karnak two statues at least, each of which was animated by an independent "double," whom the rites of consecration had detached from the god. One of them represented Khonsu, immutable in his perfection, tranquil in his greatness, and not directly interfering with the affairs of men; this was Khonsu Nofir-hotpu, whose name I have paraphrastically translated "the god of good counsel." The other statue represented a more active Khonsu who governed the affairs of mankind and drove away foreigners (that is to say enemies) from Egypt (<i>Khonsu p. iri sokhru m uisit, nutir &acirc;a, sahru shemau</i>). The first Khonsu, being considered the more powerful, we know not why, does not condescend to go himself to Syria, but sends the second Khonsu after having transferred to the latter his own powers (E. de Rouge: <i>Etude sur une st&eacute;le</i>, pp. 15&#8211;19).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_211"></A><A HREF="rp20308.htm#fr_211">43:1</A> The statues, being animated by a "double," declared their will either by the voice or by rhythmical movements. We know that queen Hatshopsitu "heard" the god Amon commanding her to send an expedition to the "Coasts of Incense," in order to fetch the perfumes necessary for religious worship. The kings of the twentieth and twenty-first dynasties, less fortunate than she, were gratified only with gestures, which were always the same; when they put a question to a god the statue remained motionless if the answer were negative, but twice shook the head violently if it were favourable. The inquiries were made in accordance with a fixed ritual, the chief points in which have been preserved in contemporaneous texts.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_212"></A><A HREF="rp20308.htm#fr_212">43:2</A> The innate virtue of the gods (<i>sa</i>) seems to have been regarded by the Egyptians as a sort of fluid analogous to that called by us "the electric fluid" or the like. It was transmitted by the imposition of hands and mesmeric "passes" over the neck or spine of the patient; this was called <i>sotpu sa</i>, which we may render "to make passes." The ceremony whereby the first Khonsu transferred his virtue to the second is frequently represented on the monuments in the scenes where a statue of a god is making passes over a king. The statue, which was usually of wood, had movable limbs; it embraced the king and passed its hand four times over the nape of his neck while he knelt before it with his back turned towards it. Every statue received at its consecration not only a "double" but also a portion of the magical virtue of the deity whom it represented; the "<i>sa</i> of life" was "behind it," which animated and penetrated within it so far as the statue did not lessen the amount of the magical virtue by transmission. The god himself, whom this perpetual flow of the <i>sa</i> would have ended by exhausting, replenished himself with a supply of it from a mysterious source in the other world: we are not told how it happened that the source could not be exhausted (Maspero: <i>Bulletin critique de la religion &eacute;gyptienne</i>. <i>Le Rituel du Sacrifice fun&eacute;raire</i>, pp. 17&#8211;18, 28&#8211;29).</P>
