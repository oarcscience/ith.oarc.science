#### <span class="smallcaps">II.—LETTER OF BURNA-BURYAS, KING OF BABYLONIA, TO AMENOPHIS IV OF EGYPT</span> <span id="fr_255"></span>[6](#fn_255)

<span class="small">OBVERSE</span>

1\. To Nipkhurri-riya king of the country of \[<span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>\]  
2. by letter  
3. I speak (even I) Burra-buriyas king of the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Kara-duniyas</span> <span
id="fr_256"></span>[7](#fn_256)

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

4\. thy brother: unto myself (is) peace;  
5. to thyself, thy house, thy wives, thy children, thy country,  
6. thy officers, thy horses (and) thy chariots, may there ever be
peace!  
7. Ever since my father and thy father with one another

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

8\. conferred in amity,  
9. they sent beautiful present\[s\] to one another,  
10. but they did not address one another in fair (and) beautiful
letter\[s\].  
11. Again, O my brother, 2 manehs of gold I have sent as my present.  
12. In return send (me) abundance of gold as much as thy father
(sent),  
13. or if that is displeasing send half of what thy father (sent).  
14. Wherefore shouldst thou send two manehs of gold (only)?  
15. For the sake of <span id="fr_257"></span>[1](#fn_257) the folding
doors in the temple <span id="fr_258"></span>[2](#fn_258) of <span
class="smallcaps">Mât</span> and the palace  
16. (which) I have undertaken <span id="fr_259"></span>[3](#fn_259) to
build send much gold,  
17. and whatsoever thou desirest in my country  
18. write for and let them take it to thee.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

19\. In the time of Kuri-galzu my father the <span
class="smallcaps">Kuna(?)khians</span>, all of them,  
20. sent unto him saying: Against the *government of the country*
(?) <span id="fr_260"></span>[4](#fn_260)  
21. let us sin and rebel.  
22. \[With\] thee will we make (a league). My father

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

23\. sent this (answer) to them  
24. saying:

<span class="small">REVERSE</span>

1\. Cease (to ask) to ally thyself with me:  
2. if thou art estranged from the king of <span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span> my brother, and  
3. alliest thyself with another,  
4. I will not go and assist <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261) you.  
5. Thus my father was like-minded with me,  
6. because of thy father he did not listen to them:  
7. Again, by an <span class="smallcaps">Assyrian</span> who regards \[my
face <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_262)\]  
8. have I not sent to thee after the news (I have) of them, asking  
9. why they have gone to thy country.  
10. If thou lovest me, no success  
11. will they obtain; dismiss them to their distant land.  
12. For a present to thee 3 manehs of alabaster,  
13. (and) 14 spans of horses with 5 chariots of wood  
14. I have despatched to thee.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_255"></span>[63:6](rp20313.htm#fr_255) Budge, *Proceedings
of the Society of Biblical Archæology*, June 1888, Pl. v, vi.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[63:7](rp20313.htm#fr_256) Babylonia.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[64:1](rp20313.htm#fr_257) Literally, "in
favour of."

<span id="fn_258"></span>[64:2](rp20313.htm#fr_258) Literally, "house of
God," *bit-ili*, the Heb. *beth-el*. The following word *mât* seems to
be a proper name, though whether it denotes the name of a deity or of a
place I cannot say. We may, however, read *mâd*, "many a temple."

<span id="fn_259"></span>[64:3](rp20313.htm#fr_259) Read *tsabtakû*.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[64:4](rp20313.htm#fr_260) Perhaps the country
of "Qannisat." The Kunakhians are probably to be identified with the
Kinakhkhians of the next letter. Winckler compares the name of the
Canaanites.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[65:1](rp20313.htm#fr_261) *Akhamat* like
*khamat*, *W. A. I.*, v. i. 75.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[65:2](rp20313.htm#fr_262) That is, "is
tributary to me."
