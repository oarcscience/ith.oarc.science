<p>2. &#8230; my [ambassador] has collected everything, O [my] brother.<br> 3. &#8230; before all of them, and we &#8230;<br> 4. &#8230; among them, and these seals and the gold &#8230;<br> 5. &#8230; and they regarded (them) very intently;<br> 6. they [considered] these treasures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as water, all of them, treasures of gold without [number];<br> 7. [and] they said: "in the land of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt</span> (are) treasures of gold, more than the dust in abundance."<br> 8. [My heart], O my brother, now loves thee in rivalry; the men &#8230;<br> 9. &#8230; whom they love, and yet nothing is given to their backs.<br> 10. [There are] quantities of what is needed, quantities more than the dust in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt</span> in plenty.<br> 11. As myself (are) these men; to whom is the gift made? &#8230;<br> 12. &#8230; and it has no gate; and truly when I [heard of] the treasures<br> 13.

<p align="center">_______________</p>  
<p>15. And my brother lifts me up in his heart when my heart was vexed at aught;<br> 16. and he does not <i>fail</i> (?) at any time, and the great god my lord does not forsake me;<br> 17.

<p>21. exceedingly; now Man&ecirc; has departed, and my brother<br> 22. has exalted him even as I honoured him very greatly.<br> 23. To my brother also I spoke, and my brother heard from them how<br> 24. I had done unto them: when Man&ecirc; lacked (aught which) is not supplied<br> 25. to him, he indeed is not vexed.</p>

As my brother before my country, as before my <i>numerous</i> (?) brethren,<br> 29. my brother has caused me greatly to flourish, so may the god <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amanu</span>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_322"></A><A HREF="#fn_321"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <i>sustain</i> (?)
