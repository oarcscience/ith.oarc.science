[the ambassadors] of thy father whom he sent [to] me; and Teie the chief wife of thy father,<br> 9. thy mother, [knew?] them all; he <i>showed</i> (?) them to Teie and <i>favoured</i> (?) all of them, and <i>after</i> (?) them<br> 10. thy father [repeated?] the words which he had spoken with me.</p>

<p>16. [Now Manakhbia&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>] the father of [N]immuriya sent to Artat&acirc;ma the father of my father, and the daughter [of]<br> 17.

[When] Nimm&ucirc;riya [thy father] sent to me and when he asked for my daughter, I did not [refuse],<br> 22. [but] I spoke favourably; to his messenger I speak as follows: "I am ready to give her; thy messenger among [my] children<br> 23. has come, and [my] eyes [have seen] the <i>aqq&acirc;ti</i> which he has given, and her dowry is worthy of yourself,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and I will bestow [on her]<br> 24. the dowry due to Nimm&ucirc;riya thy [father] which [contains] <i>jewels</i> (?)

[he honoured?] like men &#8230; when he had seen [him], and he honoured him, and ever did Nimm&ucirc;riya<br> 32. [place him] in the front rank; and since he honoured the embassy, so among the houses which [he gave] to Tadukhepa<br> 33. [my daughter, he placed] my [servants] all of them, and he made (them) dwell round about&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and in the midst of my ambassadors, who entered<br> 34. [his country]. There was nothing which Giliya [my ambassador did not obtain?]: gold which he gave a thousandfold in weight<br> 35. &#8230; Nimm&ucirc;riya gave to [Tadu]kh&ecirc;pa and Tadukh&ecirc;pa<br> 36. [gave to Giliya?] whatsoever he desired, and [Giliya] my ambassador did Nimm&ucirc;riya in friendship<br> 37. [exalt and] honour: then [Nimm]&ucirc;riya sent Nisag his ambassador<br> 38. [on account of Tadukh&ecirc;pa] my darling sister, and along with [Nisag] he sent slaves to my presence [and] objects of gold<br> 39. &#8230;&#8230; of gold &#8230; of Giliya; and ever<br> 40. &#8230;&#8230; [Nimm&ucirc;riya] returned my friendship, [and] my ambassadors<br> 41. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; I (?) did not send to the slaves</p>

<p>42. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; among the slaves when he sent<br> 43. &#8230;&#8230; he did not despatch to me, and &#8230; I despatched; an <i>object</i> (?) it had not; and so<br> 44. [Nimm&ucirc;]riya, thy father, in all the words [he had], one subject for vexation did not leave.<br> 45. [The words] which I speak, all of them, &#8230; and a wish I do not utter. Teie<br> 46. [knows the truth of] what I speak, and ask Teie thy [mother] if among the words which I speak<br> 47. (there is) one word of falsehood &#8230; him did Nimm&ucirc;riya thy father [honour?], and<br> 48. Nimm&ucirc;riya thy father made brotherhood [and league?] with me, and Nimm&ucirc;riya thy father<br> 49. did [not] say: At last the gold which [thou desirest] I have forwarded&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to the land of Khani-rabbat; and when I went down and<br> 50. he did not send the [gold which] I asked for, [to] future [days] it was left in the keeping of Nimm&ucirc;riya<br> 51. thy [father]; and Nimm&ucirc;riya said to [my] envoy: Furniture (and) objects of gold, a profusion of everything<br> 52. [which] my brother has asked for, which was left [here], which [I have agreed to give] and which my father agreed to give, I [now] send to you.<br> 53 [And] so Nimm&ucirc;riya thy father never changed his word to a non-word;<br> 54. [through what] he said in words never did he cause vexation.</p>  
<p align="center">_______________</p>  
<p>55. [Now] they say that Nimm&ucirc;riya has died,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and what they have said<br> 56. has distracted my heart,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and I wept on that day,<br> 57. [on my throne] I did [not] sit.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Bread and water on that day I did not [take], and I was sad,<br> 58.

[his son will succeed him?], and he loves me; or if he is alive with the god&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and &#8230;, we love<br> 60. [one another, and on] that account in our hearts we are [not] distant (from each other).</p>  
<p align="center">_______________</p>  
<p>61. [And now to] me the eldest son of Nimm&ucirc;riya by Teie his wife<br> 62. has made [offers of alliance and brotherhood] and has spoken thus: Nimm&ucirc;riya is not dead<br> 63. [since Napkhururi]ya [his] eldest son by Teie his chief wife (sits) in his place and<br> 64. will never at all alter [his] words from their place (but they shall remain) as before.</p>  
<p align="center">_______________</p>  
<p>65. [Now to] my [brother] I say as follows: [Artat?]ama my brother whom we love in our hearts<br> 66. [I have sent to? Napkh&ucirc;riya] the son of Nimm&ucirc;riya his father [whom I] honour on account of Teie his mother, who [was chief] wife<br> 67. [of Nimm&ucirc;riya] (and) loved (him) during the reign of (his) father, in order that she may <i>repeat</i> (?) the words before Napkh&ucirc;riya,<br> 68. [even the words of Nimm&ucirc;]riya her husband, very earnestly, whom we love.</p>  
<p align="center">_______________</p>  
<p>69. Since [Nimm&ucirc;riya] formerly sent an embassy to [me] when he dismissed Giliya, and<br> 70. [further] sent Man&ecirc; [as ambassador], and my brother despatched objects of wood, and also gold<br> 71. &#8230;&#8230; [saying] that it (is) not gold and that I have not brought (it)<br> 72. &#8230;&#8230; immediately from before the king</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></A></p>  
<p>73. Nimm&ucirc;[riya] my brother forthwith [despatched the object]s which my brother gave to me,<br> 74. [saying, Take it?] since I dig [the mines] very laboriously,<br> 75 and I [answer] thus: Nimm&ucirc;riya my brother the presents<br> 76. despatched [to me], which Napkh&ucirc;riya my brother, whom [I love], has not increased above him<br> 77. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; and what he despatched; and since &#8230;&#8230;<br> 78. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; and before Man&ecirc; &#8230;&#8230; I was vexed<br> 79. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>  
<p align="center">_______________</p>  
<p>80. &#8230;&#8230; [the presents] which my brother forwarded and<br> 81. &#8230;&#8230; [I convened] my nobles, saying: With my brother in [friendship]<br> 82. [I am united, as his fathers with] my fathers in sooth and with his fathers<br> 83. [my fathers; I have received] the gifts which my brother has sent and<br> 84. &#8230;&#8230; we have rejoiced exceedingly and kept a day of festival.<br> 85. &#8230;&#8230; he fixed ourselves, and in the [time] of night thou thyself<br> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
