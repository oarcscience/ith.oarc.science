1\. \[To\] the king my lord,  
2. my Sun-god I speak, (even I) Rib-Addu <span
id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_287)

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

3\. thy servant: at the feet of my lord  
4. my Sun-god seven times seven  
5. do I prostrate myself. The king my lord  
6. has heard the words of the servant  
7. of his justice. <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_288) (I am) very
sick. <span id="fr_290"></span>[2](#fn_289)  
8. Unto me has hostility approached.  
9. The sons of Ebed-Asirta <span id="fr_291"></span>[3](#fn_290)
descended  
10. into <span class="smallcaps">Phœnicia</span> <span

13. against the governor; and now in  
14. the city of <span class="smallcaps">Tsumura</span> (is their)
station.  
15. Behold, the governor is sick.  
16. On account of the attack he has left <span

19. Yapa-Addu along with me.  
20. Now \[accordingly\] has the governor  
21. sent to them, and  
22. \[they have sent\] 30 manehs to him.  
23. \[Now\] has the king my lord heard  
24. the report of the servant of his justice,  
25. and has despatched reinforcements  
26. in haste to

31. with the soldiers of the kingdom <span

32. the midst of his own country. A second time  
33. has the king, my lord, heard the report of his servant  
34. and has despatched <span id="fr_301"></span>[3](#fn_300) the
garrison <span id="fr_302"></span>[4](#fn_301)  
35. to the city of <span class="smallcaps">Tsumura</span> and  
36. to the city of <span class="smallcaps">Irqata</span>. Since  
37. there have fled all  
38. the garrison from  
39. the city of <span class="smallcaps">Tsumura</span>, and  
40. there has applied (his) ear the king,  
41. the lord, the Sun-god of the world, and  
42. has given me 20 convoys  
43. of horses for myself,  
44. and has despatched reinforcements  
45. in haste  
46. to the city of <span class="smallcaps">Tsumura</span> to  
47. defend it, even all  
48. the garrison  
49. who had armed themselves with difficulty,  
50. and the men had …  
51. in the midst of the city, since  
52. the soldiers of the palace had not  
53. …, and  
54. the said city had not armed itself,  
55. on the capture and *slaughter* (?) of the soldiers of the palace  
56. it is intent. All the world  
57. have gone <span id="fr_303"></span>[5](#fn_302) to the king.

once preceded by the determinative of divinity, showing that Ashêrah,
mistranslated "grove" in the authorised version of the Old Testament,
was a goddess. She was, in fact, the goddess of fertility, who was
symbolised by a cone or branchless trunk, and must be carefully
distinguished from Ashtoreth or Astartê.
