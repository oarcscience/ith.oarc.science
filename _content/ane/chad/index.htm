This paper, which was read before the Society of Biblical Archaeology in London
on Decmber 3rd, 1872, caused a sensation.
George Smith (1840-76), an engraver by trade, was self-educated in Biblical and
Near Eastern archeaology, mostly by studying the exhibits at the
British Museum.
He joined the museum as a 'repairer', piecing together fragments of
tablets from Ninevah, a job which he excelled at.
In 1886 he was appointed Assistant, and in 1871 he published <I>The
Phonetic Values of the Cuneiform Characters</I>, a key
reference work for reading Assyrian.</P>

Smith started to find bits and pieces which suggested
an account of a flood.
In 1872, Smith found a large fragment covered with a thick deposit which,
when removed, revealed a large part of the flood narrative.
Reportedly, he exclaimed, "I am the first man to read that after more
than two thousand years of oblivion," put the tablet on a table,
and ran around the room manaically, taking off his clothes!

The tablet had the story of a deluge, which
resembled the account in Genesis, but which was obviously older than
the Bible.
Today, we know this as the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh epic.
As a result of this discovery, Smith got funding to go into the field in 1873,
funded by a London newspaper, the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>.
Smith uncovered more tablets with fragments of the Deluge story.
In 1874 and 1876 he returned to the Middle East, under the Aegis
of the British Museum.
He tragically died at the age of 36 of dysentery
in Aleppo, Syria, on August 19, 1876.
