### THE EIGHTH TABLET.

#### OF THE MOURNING OF GILGAMISH, AND WHAT CAME OF IT.

 <span id="fr_105"></span>[6](#fn_97)(*The first Column is badly
mutilated, and all we can glean from it is that "as soon as something of
morning has dawned," Gilgamish addressing Enkidu, compares him to a
gazelle, and promises to glorify him. Then follows apparently a recital
by Gilgamish of their exploits together, "mountains* \[*we ascended*,

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

*we reach’d*\] *the Forest of Cedars,* \[*travelling*\] *night and day .
. .* \[*with wild beasts* (*?*)\] *drawing nigh after us." Enkidu is
lying dying or dead, and Column II begins with Gilgamish keening over
his dead friend before the Elders of Erech*):

"Unto me hearken, O Elders, to me, aye, me \[shall ye listen\],  
’Tis that I weep for my \[comrade\] Enkidu, bitterly crying  
Like to a wailing woman: my grip is \[slack’d\] on the curtleaxe  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>(Slung at) my thigh, (and) the brand at
my belt from my sight \[is removed\].  
(Aye, and) my festal attire \[lends nought of its aid for\] my
pleasure,  
Me, me hath \[sorrow\] assailed, and \[cast\] me \[down in affliction\].

Comrade (and) henchman, who chased the wild ass <span
id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_98), the pard of the desert,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Enkidu—we who all \[haps\] overcame,
ascending \[the mountains\].  
Captured the Heavenly Bull, and \[destroy’d (him)\]: we o’erthrew
Humbaba,  
He who \[abode\] in the Forest \[of Cedars —O, what is this slumber  
Now hath o’ercome \[thee\], (for now) art thou dark, nor art able to
hear \[me\]?"  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>      Natheless he raised not \[his
eyes, and\] his heart, (when Gilgamish) felt (it),  
Made no beat.  
                                 Then he veil’d (his) friend like a
bride ..  
Lifted his voice like a lion . . . . . . . .  
\[Roar’d\] like a lioness robb’d of \[her\] whelps. In front of his
\[comrade\]

tearing and casting his ringlets(?),  
Plucking and casting away (all) the grace of his . . . .

Then when something of morning had dawn’d, did Gilgamish . . . .

(*Column II here breaks off. Column III begins with Gilgamish still
mourning, telling his dead friend all he will do for him in the words of
Shamash in the preceding tablet, so that we may supply the last two*
(*?*) *lines of Column II as follow*):

*Column II*.

(*The Lament of Gilgamish*).

<span class="margnote">49-50.</span>"\[O, on a couch of great size will
I, thy friend and thy brother,

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

*Column III*.

\[Gilgamish, grant thee to lie\], on \[a handsome\] couch \[will I grant
thee  
Rest, and\] to sit on \[a throne of great size, a throne at (my) left
hand\],  
So that the princes of Hades \[may kiss thy feet (in their homage)\];  
I, too, will make (all) \[the people of Erech\] lament in thy
(honour),  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>\[Making them mourn thee\], (and)
damsels(and)heroes\[constrain to thy service\],  
While I myself for thy sake \[will cause my body to carry\]  
\[Stains\], (and) will put on the skin of a \[lion <span
id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_99), and range o’er the desert\]."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Then when something of morning had dawn’d did \[Gilgamish\] . . . .  
Loosing his girdle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(*Column IV has only five fragmentary lines at the end, mentioning "to
my friend," "thy sword," "likeness," and "to the god Bibbu," i.e., a
planet or Mercury. Column V has only a bare dozen fragmentary lines at
the end*):

*Column V*.

<span class="margnote">43.</span>" . . . Judge of the Anunnaki <span
id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_100) . . ."

(Then), when Gilgamish heard this, he form’d of the slaying a
concept <span id="fr_110"></span>[3](#fn_101).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span class="margnote">45.</span>(Then), with the dawn of the morning
did Gilgamish fashion a . . .  
Brought out also a mighty platter of wood from the highlands <span
id="fr_111"></span>[4](#fn_102).  
Fill’d he with honey a bowl of (bright) ruby <span

Fill’d he with cream; (and) adorn’d he the . . ., and Shamash instructed

improbable. It may be that he is imagining a design for a sculpture of
the slaying of the Bull. The remainder of the text perhaps describes the
funerary rites.
