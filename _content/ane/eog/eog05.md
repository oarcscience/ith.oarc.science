Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THE THIRD TABLET.

#### THE EXPEDITION TO THE FOREST OF CEDARS AGAINST HUMBABA.

(*About a column and a half of the beginning of the Old Babylonian
version on the Yale tablet are so broken that almost all the text is
lost. Gilgamish and Enkidu have now become devoted friends, thus
strangely stultifying the purpose for which Enkidu was created, and now
is set afoot the great expedition against the famous Cedar Forest
guarded by the Ogre Humbaba. The courtesan has now for a brief space
left the scene, having deserted Enkidu, much to his sorrow. The
mutilated Assyrian Version gives a hint that the mother of Gilgamish is
now describing the fight to one of her ladies(?) Rishat-Nin . . . and
where her recital becomes connected the story runs thus*).

*Column II*.

(*The Tale of the Fight*).

"He lifted up \[his foot, to the door . . . . . . . .  
<span class="margnote">21.</span>(?) They raged furiously . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .  
Enkidu hath not \[his equal\] . . . unkempt is the hair . . .  
(Aye) he was born in the desert, and \[no\] one \[his presence can
equal\]."

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

(*Enkidu's sorrow at the loss of his Love*).

Enkidu (there) as he stood gave ear \[to his utterance (?)\], grieving  
<span class="margnote">26.</span>Sitting \[in sorrow\]: his eyes fill’d
\[with tears\], and his arms lost their power,  
\[Slack’d was his bodily vigour\]. Each clasp\]d \[the hand of\] the
other.  
<span class="margnote">37.</span>\[Holding\] like \[brothers\] their
grip . . . \[(and) to Gilgamish\] Enkidu answer’d: <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_46)  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>"Friend, ’tis my darling hath circled
(her arms) round my neck (to farewell me) <span
id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_47),  
(Wherefore) my arms lose their power, my bodily vigour is slacken 'd."

(*The Ambition of Gilgamish*).

<span class="margnote">45.</span>Gilgamish open’d his mouth, and to
Enkidu spake he (in this wise):

*Column III*.

(*Gap of about two lines*)

"\[I, O my friend, am determined to go to the Forest of Cedars\],  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>\[(Aye) and\] Humbaba the Fierce
\[will\] o’ercome and destroy \[what is evil\]  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>\[(Then) will I cut down\] the Cedar .
. . . ." <span id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_48)  
Enkidu open’d his mouth, and to Gilgamish spake he (in this wise),  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>"Know, then, my friend, what time I was
roaming with kine in the mountains  
I for a distance of two hours' march from the skirts of the Forest  
Into its depths would go down. Humbaba—his roar was a whirlwind,  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>Flame (in) his jaws, and his very
breath Death! O, why hast desired  
This to accomplish? To meet(?) with Humbaba were conflict unequall’d."  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>Gilgamish open’d his mouth and to
Enkidu spake he (in this wise):  
"\[Tis that I need\] the rich yield of its mountains \[I go to the
Forest\]" . . . .

(*Seven mutilated lines continuing the speech of Gilgamish, and
mentioning "the dwelling* \[*of the gods?*\]*" (of the beginning of the
Fifth Tablet), and "the axe," for cutting down the Cedars*).

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

<span class="margnote">36.</span>Enkidu open’d his mouth \[and\] to
Gilgamish spake he (in this wise):  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>"(But) when we go to the Forest \[of
Cedars\] . . . its guard is a \[Fighter\],  
Strong, never \[sleeping\], O Gilgamish . . . . . .

(*Three mutilated lines, apparently explaining the powers which Shamash
(?), the Sun-god, and Adad, the Storm-god, have bestow’d on Humbaba*).

*Column IV*.

<span class="margnote">1.</span> <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_49)So
that he safeguard the Forest of Cedars a terror to mortals  
Him hath Enlil appointed—Humbaba, his roar is a whirlwind,  
Flame (in) his jaws, and his very breath Death! (Aye), if he in the
Forest.  
Hear (but) a tread(?) <span id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_50) on the
road—'Who is this come down to his Forest?'  
So that he safeguard the Forest of Cedars, a terror to mortals,  
Him hath Enlil appointed, and fell hap will seize him who cometh  
Down to his Forest."

<span class="margnote">3.</span> <span
id="fr_55"></span>[3](#fn_51)Gilgamish open’d his mouth and to Enkidu
spake he (in this wise):  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>"Who, O my friend, is unconquer’d by
\[death\]? A divinity, certes,  
Liveth for aye in the daylight, but mortals—their days are (all)
number’d,  
All that they do is (but) wind—But to thee, now death thou art
dreading,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Proffereth nothing of substance thy
courage—I, I'll be thy va ward!  
’Tis thine own mouth shall tell thou didst fear the onslaught (of
battle),  
(I, forsooth), if I should fall, my name will have stablish’d (for
ever).  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Gilgamish ’twas, who fought with
Humbaba, the Fierce!  
                                                       (In the
future),  
After my children are born to my house, and climb up thee, (saying):  
'Tell to us all that thou knowest' . . . . . .

(*Four lines mutilated*).

\[(Yea), when thou\] speakest \[in this wise\], thou grievest my heart
(for) the Cedar  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>\[I am\] determined \[to fell\], that I
may gain \[fame\] everlasting.

(*The Weapons are cast for the Expedition*).

(Now), O my friend, \[my charge\] to the craftsmen I fain would
deliver,  
So that they cast in our presence \[our weapons\]."  
                                         \[The charge\] they deliver’d

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

<span class="margnote">30.</span>Unto the craftsmen: the mould (?) did
the workmen prepare, and the axes  
Monstrous they cast: (yea), the celts did they cast, each (weighing)
three talents;  
Glaives, (too,) monstrous they cast, with hilts each (weighing) two
talents,  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>Blades, thirty manas to each,
corresponding to fit them: \[the inlay(?)\],  
Gold thirty manas (each) sword: (so) were Gilgamish <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_52), Enkidu laden  
Each with ten talents.

(*Gilgamish takes counsel with the Elders*).

       (And now) \[in\] the Seven Bolt \[Portal of Erech\]  
Hearing \[the bruit(?)\] did the artisans gather, \[assembled the
people(?)\] <span id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_53),  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>(There) in the streets of
broad-marketed Erech, \[in\] Gilgamish’ honour(?)\] <span
id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_53),  
\[So did the Elders of Erech\] broad-marketed take seat before him.  
\[Gilgamish\] spake \[thus: "O Elders of Erech\] broad-marketed, \[hear
me!\]  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>\[I go against Humbaba, the Fierce, who
shall say, when he heareth\] <span id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_53),

*Column V*.

'(Ah), let me look on (this) Gilgamish, he of whom (people) are
speaking,  
He with whose fame the countries are fill’d'—’Tis I will o’erwhelm
him,  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>(There) in the Forest of Cedars—I'll
make the land hear (it)  
(How) like a giant the Scion of Erech is—(yea, for) the Cedars  
I am determined to fell, that I may gain fame everlasting."  
Gilgamish (thus) did the Elders of Erech broad-marketed answer:  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>"Gilgamish, ’tis thou art young, that
thy valour (o’ermuch) doth uplift thee,  
Nor dost thou know to the full what thou dost seek to accomplish.  
Unto our ears hath it come of Humbaba, his likeness is twofold. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[3](#fn_54)  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Who (of free will) then would \[seek
to\] oppose \[in encounter\] his weapons?  
Who for a distance of two hours’ march from the skirts of the Forest  
Unto its depths would \[go\] down? Humbaba, his roar is a whirlwind,  
Flame (in) his jaws, and his very breath Death! (O), why hast desired.  
This to accomplish? To meet(?) with Humbaba were conflict unequall’d."  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>Gilgamish unto the rede of his
counsellors hearken’d and ponder’d,  
Cried to \[his\] friend: "Now, indeed, O \[my\] fried, \[will I\] thus
\[voice opinion\].  
I (forsooth) dread him, and (yet) to \[(the depths of the) Forest\] I'll
take \[me\] . ."

(*About seven lines mutilated or missing in which the Elders bless
Gilgamish in farewell*).

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

" . . . . . . . . may thy god (so) \[protect\] thee,  
Bringing thee back \[(safe and)\] sound to the walls of
\[broad-marketed\] Erech."  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>Gilgamish knelt \[before Shamash\] a
word \[in his presence\] to utter:  
"Here I present myself, Shamash, \[to lift up\] my hands (in
entreaty),  
O that hereafter my life may be spared, to the ramparts of \[Erech\]  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>Bring me again: spread thine aegis
\[upon me\] ."  
                                         And Shamash made answer,  
\[Speaking\] his oracle . . . . . . .

(*About six lines mutilated or missing*).

*Column VI*.

Tears adown Gilgamish’ \[cheeks were (now)\] streaming: "A road I have
never  
Traversed \[I go, on a passage(?)\] I know not, (but if) I be spared  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>(So) in content \[will I\] come \[and
will pay thee(?)\] due meed (?) of thy homage."

(*Two mutilated lines with the words "on seats" and "his equipment."*)

<span class="margnote">10.</span>Monstrous \[the axes they brought(?)\],
they deliver’d \[the bow\] and the quiver  
\[Into\] (his) hand; (so) taking a celt, \[he slung on (?)\] his
quiver,  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>\[Grasping\] another \[celt(?) he
fasten’d his glaive\] to his baldrick.  
\[But, or ever the twain\] had set forth on their journey, they
offer’d  
\[Gifts\] to the Sun-god, that home he might bring them to Erech (in
safety).

(*The Departure of the two Heroes*).

<span class="margnote">20.</span>(Now) do the \[Elders\] farewell him
with blessings, to Gilgamish giving  
Counsel \[concerning\] the road: "O Gilgamish, to thine own power  
Trust not (alone); (but at least) let thy \[road\] be traversed
\[before\] thee,  
Guard thou thy person; let Enkidu go before thee (as vaward).  
(Aye, for) ’twas he hath discover’d the \[way\], the road he hath
travell’d.  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>(Sooth), of the Forest the passes are
all under sway (?) \[of\] Humbaba,  
\[(Yea), he who goeth\] as vaward is (able) to safeguard a comrade,  
O that the Sun-god \[may grant\] thee \[success to attain\] thine
\[ambition\],  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>0 that he grant that thine eyes see
(consummate) the words of thy utt’rance  
O that he level the path that is block’d, cleave a road for thy
treading,  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>Cleave, too, the berg for thy foot! May
the god Lugal-banda <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_55)  
Bring in thy night-time a message to thee, with which shalt be
gladden’d,  
So that it help thine ambition <span id="fr_62"></span>[2](#fn_56),
(for), like a boy thine ambition  
On the o’erthrow of Humbaba thou fixest, as thou hast settled.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="margnote">40.</span>Wash, (then), thy feet <span
id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_57): when thou haltest <span
id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_58), shalt hollow a pool, so that ever  
Pure be the water within thy skin-bottle, (aye), cool be the water  
Unto the Sun-god thou pourest, (and thus) shalt remind Lugal-banda."  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>Enkidu open’d his mouth, and spake unto
Gilgamish, (saying):  
"\[Gilgamish\], art (?) thou (in truth) full equal to making (this)
foray?  
Let \[not\] thy heart be afraid; trust me."  
                                     On (his) shoulder his mantle  
<span class="margnote">50.</span>\[Drew\] he, (and now) \[on the road\]
to Humbaba they set forth (together).

(*Five lines mutilated; the two heroes meet a man who sets them on their
way*).

<span class="margnote">56.</span>" . . . they went with me . . .
\[tell\] you . . in joy of heart."  
<span class="margnote">60.</span>\[So when he heard this his word, the
man on his way did \[direct him\]:  
"Gilgamish, go, . . . let thy brother (?) precede \[thee\] . . . \[(and)
in thine ambition\].  
\[O that the Sun-god (?)\] may shew \[thee\] success!"

(*The Old Babylonian Version breaks off after three more fragmentary
lines. The following is the Assyrian Version of Column VI*, *l*. 21,
*and onwards of the preceding text. It marks the beginning of the Third
Tablet in the Assyrian Version, opening with the episode of the conclave
of the Elders*).

"Gilgamish, put not thy faith in the strength of thine own person
(solely),  
Quench’d be thy wishes to trusting(? (o’ermuch) in thy (shrewdness in)
smiting.  
(Sooth), he who goeth as vaward is able to safeguard a comrade,  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>He who doth know how to guide hath
guarded his friend; (so) before thee,  
Do thou let Enkidu go, (for ’tis) he to the Forest of Cedars  
Knoweth the road: ’tis he lusteth for battle, and threateneth combat.  
Enkidu—he would watch over a friend, would safeguard a comrade,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>(Aye, such an one) would deliver his
person from out of the pitfalls.  
We, O King, in our conclave have paid deep heed to thy welfare,  
Thou, O King, in return with an (equal) heed shalt requite us."  
Gilgamish open’d his mouth, and spake unto Enkidu, saying:  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>"Unto the Palace of Splendour, O
friend, come, let us betake us,  
Unto the presence of Nin-sun, the glorious Queen, (aye) to Nin-sun,  
Wisest of (all) clever women, all-knowing; a well-devised pathway  
She will prescribe for our feet."

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

<span class="margnote">20.</span>Clasp’d they their hands, each to each,
and went to the Palace of Splendour,  
Gilgamish <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_59), Enkidu. Unto the glorious
Queen, (aye) to Nin-sun  
Gilgamish came, and he enter’d in unto \[the presence of Nin-sun\]:  
"Nin-sun, O fain would I tell thee \[how\] I a far journey \[am
going\],  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>(Unto) the home \[of Humbaba to counter
a\] warfare I know not,  
\[Follow a road\] which I \[know\] not, \[(aye) from the time of my
starting\],  
\[Till my return, until I arrive at the Forest of Cedars,\]  
\[Till I o’erthrow Humbaba, the Fierce, and destroy from the
country.\]  
\[All that the Sun-god abhorreth of evil\]" . . . .

(*The rest of the speech of Gilgamish is lost until the end of the
Column, where we find him still addressing his mother, and apparently
asking that she shall garb herself in festal attire to beg a favour of
the Sun-god*).

" . . . garb thyself; . . . in thy presence.  
(So) to her offspring, to Gilgamish \[Nin-sun\] gave ear . . . -ly,

*Column II*.

Enter’d \[her chamber\] . . . \[and deck’d herself\] with the flowers of
*Tulal*(?),  
\[Put on\] the festal garb of her body . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>\[Put on\] the festal garb of her bosom
. . ., her head \[with a circlet\]  
Crown’d, and . . . the ground *ipirani* <span
id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_60).  
Climb’d \[she the stairway\], ascended the roof, and \[the parapet(?)\]
mounted,  
Offer’d her incense to Shamash, (her) sacrifice offer’d \[to
Shamash\],  
(Then) towards Shamash her hands she uplifted (in orison saying):  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>"Why didst thou give (this)
restlessness of spirit  
With which didst dower Gilgamish, \[my\] son?  
That now thou touchest him, and (straight) he starteth  
A journey far to where Humbaba (dwelleth),  
To counter warfare which he knoweth not,  
Follow a pathway which he knoweth not,  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>(Aye), from the very day on which he
starteth,  
Till he return, till to the Cedar Forest  
He reach; till he o’erthrow the fierce Humbaba,  
And from the land destroy all evil things  
Which thou abhor’st; the day which \[thou hast set\]  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>As term, of (that) strong man (who)
feareth thee,  
May Aa <span id="fr_67"></span>[3](#fn_61), (thy) bride, be \[thy\]
remembrancer.  
He the night-watches . . . . ."

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

(*Columns III, IV, and V are much mutilated. There is the remnant of a
passage in Assyrian, corresponding to the Third Tablet of the Old
Babylonian Version, Column III,* 15*, which gives Enkidu's speech about
"the mountains," "the cattle of the field," and how "he waited": then
follows another fragment with a mention of the "corpse"* \[*of
Humbaba*\] *and of the Anunnaki (the Spirits of Heaven), and a
repetition of the line "that strong man (who) feareth* \[*thee*\] *."
Then a reference to "the journey" until* \[*Gilgamish shall have
overthrown the fierce Humbaba*\]*, be it after an interval of days,
months, or years; and another fragment probably part of the previous
text, where someone "heaps up incense"* \[*to a god*\]*, and Enkidu
again speaks with someone, but the mutilated text does not allow us much
light on its connection, and although there is another fragment, the
connection again is not obvious. The last column is a repetition of what
the Elders said to Gilgamish*):

"(Aye, such an one) \[would deliver his person\] from out of the
pitfalls.  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>\[We, O King\], in our conclave \[have
paid deep heed to thy welfare\],  
(Now), O King, in thy turn with an (equal) heed\] shalt requite us."  
Enkidu \[open'd\] his mouth \[and spake unto Gilgamish, saying\]:  
"Turn, O my friend . . . . a road not . . . ."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_46"></span>[20:1](eog05.htm#fr_50) Down to this point the:
Assyrian Version has been used, restored in part from the Old
Babylonian. The Old Babylonian Version runs (Column II. 26 "The eyes
\[of Enkidu fill'd\] with tears, his heart was \[heavy\] and . . . he
mourned, his heart \[was heavy\], and . . . he mourn 'd. \[Gilgamish\]
lifted up his face, \[spake\] to Enkidu: ' \[Why\] are thine eyes \[full
of tears\] (and) thy \[heart heavy\]? \[Why dost thou\] mourn?' \[Enkidu
answer'd\] and spake to Gilgamish:" and then it continues as above in
the text.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[20:2](eog05.htm#fr_51) A difficult phrase. It
may be that this represents the words for saying farewell, without any
further explanation, just as our "God be with you" has become,
"Good-bye." The same convention is apparent in Ruth 1, 14, at the
parting of the two daughters of Naomi: "And Orpah kissed her
mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her."

<span id="fn_48"></span>[20:3](eog05.htm#fr_52) Ends of three short
lines here. . . . "the wood," " . . ," "I will open it."

<span id="fn_49"></span>[21:1](eog05.htm#fr_53) From here to "down to
his Forest" from the Assyrian Version, Second Tablet, Column v.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[21:2](eog05.htm#fr_54) A word or two mutilated
at this point.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[21:3](eog05.htm#fr_55) Old Babylonian Version.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[22:1](eog05.htm#fr_56) Text has "and,"

<span id="fn_53"></span>[22:2](eog05.htm#fr_59) Conjecture.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[22:3](eog05.htm#fr_60) A difficult phrase.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[23:1](eog05.htm#fr_61) Lugal-banda appears to
be the tutelary god of Gilgamish, and possibly his father: he and Tammuz
are the two kings of Erech preceding Gilgamish in the Kings lists.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[23:2](eog05.htm#fr_62) Lit. "stand to thee in
thine ambition."

<span id="fn_57"></span>[24:1](eog05.htm#fr_63) Doubtful: the meaning of
this brief but difficult line is not obvious. *Mizi* might be from
another verb "find," rather than "wash."

<span id="fn_58"></span>[24:2](eog05.htm#fr_64) Lit. "at thy halting."

<span id="fn_59"></span>[25:1](eog05.htm#fr_65) Lit. "and."

<span id="fn_60"></span>[25:2](eog05.htm#fr_66) Uncertain.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[25:3](eog05.htm#fr_67) The wife of the Sun-god.
