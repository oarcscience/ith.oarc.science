This is one of the first essentially complete academic translations of the
epic of Gilgamesh.
It includes all of the principal episodes of the epic: the wild man Enkidu;
the battle with Humbaba, the cedar forest demon; the death of Enkidu, the
journey of Gilgamesh to find the secret of eternal life, in the course
of which he encounters the Babylonian Noah, Uta-Napishtim, and hears the
story of the great flood.

While often cited, this book is almost never seen.
This work is long out of print (in fact it has never been reprinted)
and extremely rare, even in libraries.
However, it has a huge significance because it is one of the baseline
translations of Gilgamesh.
Because of its date of publication, under US copyright law it is formally still
under copyright. Since there was no copyright notice in the original,
the US copyright lasts for 70 years following the death of the author
(i.e., 2011).
We have attempted to locate the current copyright holder with no success.
If one comes forward and requests that this electronic text be removed,
it will be taken down without notice.
