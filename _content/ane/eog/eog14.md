### THE TWELFTH TABLET.

#### GILGAMISH, IN DESPAIR, ENQUIRES OF THE DEAD.

*Column I*.

(*How the dead haunt the living*).

 <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_144)(Then), what time that the seine
had pass’d through the Architect 's dwelling,  
(Aye, and) the net \[had taken its toll\] . . . . \[said he\]:  
"Lord, what \[is’t I may do\] . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
(Now, what time that) the seine hath \[pass’d through the
Architect's <span id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_145) dwelling\],  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>(Aye and) the net \[hath taken its
toll\] . . . . . . . . . . . ."  
Gilgamish \[unto him spake\] . . . . . . . . . . . .  
"If unto . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(*About two lines wanting, in which Gilgamish presumably asks how the
dead may be made to haunt the mourner*).

"Gilgamish, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."

(*The Mourner's Duty*).

"If to the . . . \[thou drawest\], unto the temple <span

<span class="margnote">15.</span>Raiment clean \[shalt not don\], (but)
like to a townsman shalt . . . .  
Nor with sweet oil from the cruse be anointed, (lest) at its fragrance  
Round thee they gather: nor mayst thou set bow to the earth, (lest)
around thee  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>Circle those shot by the bow; nor a
stick in thy hand mayst thou carry,  
(Lest) (stricken) ghosts should gibber against thee: nor shoe to thy
footsole  
Put on, nor make on the ground a (loud) echo: thy wife, whom thou
lovest,  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>Kiss (her) thou mayst not, thy wife
whom thou hatest—thou mayst not chastise (her),  
(Aye, and) thy child whom thou lovest not kiss, nor thy child whom thou
hatest  
Mayst not chastise, (for) the mourning of earth doth hold thee
enthralléd.

    She who dead lieth,  
    Mother of Ninazu,  
    She who dead lieth,  
    <span class="margnote">30.</span>No more with mantle are  
    Veil’d her fair shoulders,  
    No more her bosom  
    Drawn <span id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_147), like the lard cruse!"

(*Gilgamish by contravening these customs attempts to raise Enkidu*).

(So) did he draw \[the . . . to . . ., and came to the temples,  
\[Put on clean raiment\] . . . (and) like to a townsman . . .  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>(Aye), with \[sweet\] oil from the
cruse \[was\] anointed: (then) at \[its\] fragrance  
Round him they gather 'd: <span id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_148) the bow
did he set (?) \[to the earth\], and around him  
Circled the spirits, (yea,) those who were \[shot\] by the bow at him
gibber’d,  
\[Carried\] a stick in his hand \[and the (stricken) ghosts at him
gibber’d(?)\].  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>\[Put on\] a shoe to \[his foot-sole,
and made on the ground a (loud)\] echo.  
\[Kiss’d he\] his wife \[whom he lovéd, chastiséd his\] wife whom he
hated,  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>\[Kiss’d he his child\] whom he lovéd,
chastiséd \[his\] child whom he hated.  
(Aye, in good sooth, ’twas) the mourning of earth which did hold him
enthralléd:  
    "She who (dead) lieth,  
    \[She who\] (dead) lieth,  
    Mother of Ninazu,  
    She who (dead) lieth,  
    No (more) with mantle are  
    Veil’d \[her\] fair shoulders,  
    No (more) her bosom  
    Drawn, like the lard cruse."  
<span class="margnote">50.</span>Cried(?) \[he\] (for) Enkidu out of the
earth to ascend: "\[Not\] (the Plague-god),  
Namtar, hath \[seized\] him, nor fever, (but only) the earth: <span
id="fr_162"></span>[3](#fn_149) nor the Croucher,  
\[Nergal\], the ruthless, hath seized him, (but only) the earth: neither
fell he  
There where was \[battle\] of mortals; ’twas only the earth \[which hath
seized him.\] "3  
(So) <span id="fr_163"></span>[4](#fn_150) . . . for his servitor Enkidu
sorrow’d the offspring of Nin-sun,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

<span class="margnote">55.</span>(Aye), as he went all alone unto
\[Ekur\], the temple of Enlil:  
"\[Enlil\], (my) Father, (’tis now) that the seine hath stricken me
also,  
Down to the earth—the net to the earth hath stricken me also.  
Enkidu ’tis—whom \[I pray thee\] to raise \[from the earth\]—not (the
Plague-god),  
<span class="margnote">60.</span>Namtar, hath seized him, nor fever,
\[but only the earth\]: nor the Croucher,  
Nergal, the ruthless, hath seized shim, but only the earth\]: \[neither
fell he\]  
There where was battle of mortals: \[’twas only the earth which hath
seized him\]."  
(But) no answer did Enlil, the father vouchsafe.  
                                  \[To the Moon-god he hied him (?)\]:  
"Moon-god, (my) Father, (’tis now) that the seine \[hath stricken me
also,  
Down to the earth\]—the net \[to the earth hath stricken me also\].  
<span class="margnote">65.</span>Enkidu ’tis—whom \[I pray thee\] to
raise \[from the earths—not (the Plague-god),  
Namtar, hath seized him, \[nor\] fever, \[but only the earth: nor\] the
Croucher,  
Nergal, \[the ruthless, hath seized him, but only the earth\]: \[neither
fell he\]  
There where \[was battle of mortals: ’twas only the earth which hath
seized him."  
<span class="margnote">70.</span>\[(But) no answer the Moon-god
vouchsafed:  
                                            (Then) to Ea he hied
him:\]  
\["Ea, (my) Father, ’tis now that the seine hath stricken me also,\]  
\[Down to the earth—the net to the earth hath stricken me also.\]  
\[Enkidu ’tis,—whom I pray thee to raise from the earth—not (the
Plague-god),\]  
<span class="margnote">75.</span>Nam\[tar, hath seized him, nor fever,
but only the earth: nor\] the Croucher,  
Nergal, the ruthless, \[hath seized him, but only the earth: neither
fell he\]  
There where was battle of mortals: \[’twas only the earth which hath
seized him\]."  
Ea, the father, \[gave ear (and) to Nergal\], the warrior-hero,  
\[Spake he\]: "O Nergal, O warrior-hero, \[give ear to my
speaking(?)\]!  
<span class="margnote">80.</span>\[Ope now,\] a hole \[in the earth\],
that the spirit of \[Enkidu, (rising)\],  
\[May from the earth issue forth, and so have speech\] with \[his\]
brother."  
Nergal, the warrior-hero, \[gave ear to the speaking of Ea\],  
<span class="margnote">85.</span>Oped, then, a hole in the earth, and
the spirit of Enkidu issued  
Forth from the earth like a wind. They embraced and . . . . .  
Communed together, mourning.  
"Tell, O my friend, O tell, O my friend, (O) tell (me, I pr’y thee),  
What thou hast seen of the laws of the Underworld?" "(Nay, then,) O
comrade;

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span class="margnote">90.</span>I will not tell thee, (yea,) I will not
tell thee—(for), were I to tell thee,  
What I have seen of the laws of the Underworld,—sit thee down
weeping!"  
"(Then) let me sit me down weeping."

(*The wretched lot of all who must die*).

                                  "(So be it): \[the friend(?)\] thou
didst fondle  
(Thereby) rejoicing thee—\[into his body(?), as though ’twere a\]
mantle  
<span class="margnote">95.</span>Old, hath the worm made its entry: (in
sooth, then) \[the bride(?)\] thou didst fondle,  
(Thereby) rejoicing thee—fill’d with the dust \[is her body\] . . . .  
. . . . he hath spoken and \[into the"' ground (?) is he sunken,  
. . . he hath spoken and \[into the ground (?) is he sunken."  
"\[He who fell in . . . .\]  
<span class="margnote">100.</span>\[Didst thou see him?\]." "(Aye), I
saw . . . ."

(*About seventeen lines missing*).

<span class="margnote">118.</span>"As a pillar beautiful  
\[Props?\] an inner por\[tico (?)\] . . .

(*About twenty-five lines missing*).

<span class="margnote">145.</span>"He who falleth from a pole  
Didst thou see him? "(Aye), I saw\]:  
Straightway for . . . .  
By removal of a plug . . . . . ."  
"He whom death . . . . . . . . .  
"Didst thou see him?" "\[(Aye) I saw\]:  
He's at rest upon a couch,  
Limpid water doth he drink."  
"(Then, the hero) slain in fight,  
Didst thou see him?" "(Aye) I saw:  
<span class="margnote">150.</span>Father, mother <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_151) raise his head,  
O’er him wife <span id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_152) \[in bitter
woe\]."  
"He whose corpse in desert lieth,  
Hast thou seen him?" "(Aye), I saw;  
Not in earth doth rest his spirit."  
"He whose ghost hath none to tend,  
Didst thou see him?" "(Aye), I saw,  
Lees of cup, and broken bread  
Thrown into the street he eateth."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_144"></span>[57:1](eog14.htm#fr_157) Assyrian Version.
Apparently the previous tablet has ended with the short description of
Erech and its architecture by Gilgamish, as a cue for the opening lines
of the Twelfth Tablet. The "Architect" must be Gilgamish: and the
description of seine and net [passing](errata.htm#3) through his house,
parallel to the phrase in the First Tablet, Column II, must a be a
euphemism for the death of Enkidu. Gilgamish, having failed to learn the
secret of eternal life is now reduced to calling up his dead friend to
know the worst which he may expect. He asks what must the mourner do to
avoid being haunted by the ghost: and then proceeds to do exactly the
contrary in order that. Enkidu may return to haunt him.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[57:2](eog14.htm#fr_158) Or, if it is the
Architect speaking, "my dwelling."

<span id="fn_146"></span>[57:3](eog14.htm#fr_159) These lines are
capable of two restorations: either "If thou \[drawest\] . . . unto . .
., then the ghosts will accompany thee to thy Temple," or "If thou
\[drawest\] . . . unto . ., or go to the Temple." Some slight
restoration can be made from I. 31.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[58:1](eog14.htm#fr_160) *Shaddata*, *shadadu*
being used in medicine for sucking or drawing vapour through a tube.
This short poem may be the regular lament of the professional mourner.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[58:2](eog14.htm#fr_161) There is a little
confusion in the next three or four lines, in comparison with the
previous parallel text, and it may be that we should boldly emend or
correct them accordingly.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[58:3](eog14.htm#fr_162) *Lit*. "’twas the
earth \[seized h\]im," or "’twas the earth \[ditto\]."

<span id="fn_150"></span>[58:4](eog14.htm#fr_163) It is uncertain what
is to be restored for the two mutilated words at the beginning.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[60:1](eog14.htm#fr_164) Lit. "his father and
his mother."

<span id="fn_152"></span>[60:2](eog14.htm#fr_165) Lit. "and o’er him his
wife ...."
