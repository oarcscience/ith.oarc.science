<p>1. They prepared for him a lordly chamber,</p>  
<p>2 . Before his fathers as prince he took his place.</p>  
<p>3. "Thou art chiefest among the great gods,</p>  
<p>4. "Thy fate is unequalled, thy word is Anu!</p>  
<p>5. "O Marduk, thou art chiefest among the great gods,</p>  
<p>6. "Thy fate is unequalled, thy word is Anu!</p>  
<p>7. "Henceforth not without avail shall be thy command,</p>  
<p>8. "In thy power shall it be to exalt and to abase.</p>  
<p>9. "Established shall be the word of thy mouth, irresistible shall be thy command;</p>  
<p>10. "None among the gods shall transgress thy boundary.</p>  
<p>11. "Abundance, the desire of the shrines of the gods,</p>  
<p>12. "Shall be established in thy sanctuary, even though they lack (offerings).</p>  
<p>13. "O Marduk, thou art our avenger!</p>  
<p>14. "We give thee sovereignty over the whole world.</p>  
<p>15. "Sit thou down in night, be exalted in thy command.</p>  
<p>16. "Thy weapon shall never lose its power, it shall crush thy foe.</p>

<p>17. "O lord, spare the life of him that putteth his trust in thee,</p>  
<p>18. "But as for the god who began the rebellion, pour out his life."</p>  
<p>19. Then set they in their midst a garment,</p>  
<p>20. And unto Marduk their first-born they spake:</p>  
<p>21. "May thy fate, O lord, be supreme among the gods,</p>  
<p>22. "To destroy and to create; speak thou the word, and (thy command) shall be fulfilled.</p>  
<p>23. "Command now and let the garment vanish;</p>  
<p>24. "And speak the word again and let the garment reappear!"</p>  
<p>25. Then he spake with his mouth, and the garment vanished;</p>  
<p>26. Again he commanded it, and the garment reappeared.</p>  
<p>27. When the gods, his fathers, beheld (the fulfilment of) his word,</p>  
<p>28. They rejoiced, and they did homage (unto him, saying), " Marduk is king! "</p>  
<p>29. They bestowed upon him the sceptre, and the throne, and the ring,</p>  
<p>30. They give him an invincible weapon, which overwhelmeth the foe.</p>  
<p>31. "Go, and cut off the life of Tiamat,</p>  
<p>32. "And let the wind carry her blood into secret places."</p>

<p>33. After the gods his fathers had decreed for the lord his fate,</p>  
<p>34. They caused him to set out on a path of prosperity and success.</p>  
<p>35 . He made ready the bow, he chose his weapon,</p>  
<p>36. He slung a spear upon him and fastened it . . .</p>  
<p>37. He raised the club, in his right hand he grasped (it),</p>  
<p>38. The bow and the quiver he hung at his side.</p>  
<p>39. He set the lightning in front of him,</p>  
<p>40. With burning flame he filled his body.</p>  
<p>41. He made a net to enclose the inward parts of Tiamat,</p>  
<p>42. The four winds he stationed so that nothing of her might escape;</p>  
<p>43. The South wind and the North wind and the East wind and the West wind</p>  
<p>44. He brought near to the net, the gift of his father Anu.</p>  
<p>45. He created the evil wind, and the tempest, and the hurricane,</p>  
<p>46. And the fourfold wind, and the sevenfold wind, and the whirlwind, and the wind which had no equal;</p>  
<p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></A> <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></A></p>  
<p>47. He sent forth the winds which he had created, the seven of them;</p>  
<p>48. T o disturb the inward parts of Tiamat, they followed after him.</p>  
<p>49. Then the lord raised the thunderbolt, his mighty weapon,</p>  
<p>50. He mounted the chariot, the storm unequalled for terror,</p>  
<p>51. He harnessed and yoked unto it four horses,</p>  
<p>52. Destructive, ferocious, overwhelming, and swift of pace;</p>  
<p>53. [...] were their teeth, they were flecked with foam;</p>  
<p>54. They were skilled in [...], they had been trained to trample underfoot.</p>  
<p>55. [...], mighty in battle, </p>  
<p>56. Left and [right ...</p>  
<p>57. His garment was [...], he was clothed with terror,</p>  
<p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></A> <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></A></p>  
<p>58. With overpowering brightness his head was crowned.</p>  
<p>59. Then he set out, he took his way,</p>  
<p>60. And towards the [rag]ing Tiamat he set his face.</p>  
<p>61. On his lips he held [...],</p>  
<p>62. ... [...] he grasped in his hand.</p>  
<p>63. Then they beheld him, the gods beheld him,</p>  
<p>64. The gods his fathers beheld him, the gods beheld him.</p>  
<p>65. And the lord drew nigh, he gazed upon the inward parts of Tiamat,</p>  
<p>66. He perceived the muttering of Kingu, her spouse.</p>  
<p>67. As (Marduk) gazed, (Kingu) was troubled in his gait,</p>  
<p>68. His will was destroyed and his motions ceased.</p>  
<p>69. And the gods, his helpers, who marched by his side,</p>  
<p>70. Beheld their leader's [...], and their sight was troubled.</p>  
<p>71. But Tiamat [...], she turned not her neck,</p>  
<p>72. With lips that failed not she uttered rebellious words:</p>  
<p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></A> <a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="green">p. 69</font></A></p>  
<p>73. "[...] thy coming as lord of the gods,</p>  
<p>74. "From their places have they gathered, in thy place are they!"</p>  
<p>75. Then the lord [raised] the thunderbolt, his mighty weapon,</p>  
<p>76. [And against] Tiamat, who was raging, thus he sent (the word):</p>  
<p>77. "[Thou] art become great, thou hast exalted thyself on high,</p>  
<p>78. "And thy [heart hath prompted] thee to call to battle.</p>  
<p>79. "[...] their fathers [...],</p>  
<p>80. "[...] their [...] thou hatest [...].</p>  
<p>81. "[Thou hast exalted King]u to be [thy] spouse,</p>  
<p>82. "[Thou hast . . . ] him, that, even as Anu, he should issue decrees.</p>  
<p>83. "[...] thou hast followed after evil,</p>  
<p>84. "And [against] the .gods my fathers thou hast contrived thy wicked plan.</p>  
<p>85. "Let then thy host be equipped, let thy weapons be girded on!</p>  
<p>86. "Stand! I and thou, let us join battle!"</p>  
<p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></A> <a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></A></p>  
<p>87. When Tiamat heard these words,</p>  
<p>88. She was like one possessed, she lost her reason.</p>  
<p>89. Tiamat uttered wild, piercing cries,</p>  
<p>90. She trembled and shook to her very foundations.</p>  
<p>91. She recited an incantation, she pronounced her spell,</p>  
<p>92. And the gods of the battle cried out for their weapons.</p>  
<p>93. Then advanced Tiamat and Marduk, the counsellor of the gods;</p>  
<p>94. To the fight they came on, to the battle they drew nigh.</p>  
<p>95. The lord spread out his net and caught her,</p>  
<p>96. And the evil wind that was behind (him) he let loose in her face.</p>  
<p>97. As Tiamat opened her mouth to its full extent,</p>  
<p>98. He drove in the evil wind, while as yet she had not shut her lips.</p>  
<p>99. The terrible winds filled her belly,</p>  
<p>100. And her courage was taken from her, and her mouth she opened wide.</p>  
<p>101. He seized the spear and burst her belly,</p>  
<p>102. He severed her inward parts, he pierced (her) heart.</p>  
<p>103. He overcame her and cut off her life;</p>  
<p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></A> <a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="green">p. 73</font></A></p>  
<p>104. He cast down her body and stood upon it.</p>  
<p>105. When he had slain Tiamat, the leader,</p>  
<p>106. Her might was broken, her host was scattered.</p>  
<p>107. And the gods her helpers, who marched by her side,</p>  
<p>108. Trembled, and were afraid, and turned back.</p>  
<p>109. They took to flight to save their lives;</p>  
<p>110. But they were surrounded, so that they could not escape.</p>  
<p>111. He took them captive, he broke their weapons;</p>  
<p>112. In the net they were caught and in the snare they sat down.</p>  
<p>113. The [...] ... of the world they filled with cries of grief.</p>  
<p>114. They received punishment from him, they were held in bondage.</p>  
<p>115. And on the eleven creatures which she had filled with the power of striking terror,</p>  
<p>116. Upon the troop of devils, who marched at her [...],</p>  
<p>117. He brought affliction, their strength [he ...];</p>  
<p>118. Them and their opposition he trampled under his feet.</p>  
<p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></A> <a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></A></p>  
<p>119. Moreover, Kingu, who had been exalted over them,</p>  
<p>120. He conquered, and with the god Dug-ga he counted him.</p>  
<p>121. He took from him the Tablets of Destiny that were not rightly his,</p>  
<p>122. He sealed them with a seal and in his own breast he laid them.</p>  
<p>123. Now after the hero Marduk had conquered and cast down his enemies,</p>  
<p>124. And had made the arrogant foe even like ...,</p>  
<p>125. And had fully established An<u>sh</u>ar's triumph over the enemy,</p>  
<p>126. And had attained the purpose of Nudimmud,</p>  
<p>127. Over the captive gods he strengthened his durance,</p>  
<p>128. And unto Tiamat, whom he had conquered, he returned.</p>  
<p>129. And the lord stood upon Tiamat's hinder parts,</p>  
<p>130. And with his merciless club he smashed her skull.</p>  
<p>131. He cut through the channels of her blood,</p>  
<p>132. And he made the North wind bear it away into secret places.</p>  
<p>133. His fathers beheld, and they rejoiced and were glad;</p>  
<p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></A> <a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></A></p>  
<p>134. Presents and gifts they brought unto him.</p>  
<p>135. Then the lord rested, gazing upon her dead body,</p>  
<p>136. While he divided the flesh of the ..., and devised a cunning plan.</p>  
<p>137. He split her up like a flat fish into two halves;</p>  
<p>138. One half of her he stablished as a covering for heaven.</p>  
<p>139. He fixed a bolt, he stationed a watchman,</p>  
<p>140. And bade them not to let her waters come forth.</p>  
<p>141. He passed through the heavens, he surveyed the regions (thereof),</p>  
<p>142. And over against the Deep he set the dwelling of Nudimmud.</p>  
<p>143. And the lord measured the structure of the Deep,</p>  
<p>144. And he founded E-<u>sh</u>ara, a mansion like unto it.</p>  
<p>145. The mansion E-<u>sh</u>ara which he created as heaven,</p>  
<p>146. He caused Anu, B&ecirc;l, and Ea in their districts to inhabit.</p>
