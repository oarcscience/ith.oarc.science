spring up\]!"

3\. O Asaru-alim, "who is revered in the house of counsel," "\[who
aboundeth in counsel\],"

them anew;"

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

10\. Should their wants be pure, then are they \[satisfied\];

11\. Should he make an incantation, then are the gods \[appeased\];

12 . Should they attack him in anger, he withstandeth \[their
onslaught\]!

13\. Let him therefore be exalted, and in the assembly of the gods \[let
him ...\];

14\. None among the gods can \[rival him\]!

15\. Tutu is Zi-ukkina, "the Life of the host \[of the gods\],"

16\. Who established for the gods the bright heavens.

17\. He set them on their way, and ordained \[their path (?)\]

18\. Never shall his \[...\] deeds be forgotten among men.

19\. Tutu as Zi-azag thirdly they named, "the Bringer <span

20\. "The God of the Favouring Breeze," "the Lord of Hearing and Mercy,"

21\. "The Creator of Fulness and Abundance," "the Founder of
Plenteousness,"

22\. "Who increaseth all that is small."

23\. "In sore distress we felt his favouring breeze,"

24\. Let them say, let them pay reverence, let them bow in humility
before him!

25\. Tutu as Aga-azag may mankind fourthly magnify!

26\. "The Lord of the Pure Incantation," "the Quickener of the Dead,"

27\. "Who had mercy upon the captive gods,"

28\. "Who removed the yoke from upon the gods his enemies,"

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

29\. "For their forgiveness did he create mankind,"

30\. "The Merciful One, with whom it is to bestow life!"

31\. May his deeds endure, may they never be forgotten

32\. In the mouth of mankind <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_159) whom
his hands have made!

33\. Tutu as Mu-azag, fifthly, his "Pure Incantation" may their mouth
proclaim,

34\. "Who through his Pure Incantation hath destroyed all the evil
ones!"

35\. <u>Sh</u>ag-zu, "who knoweth the heart of the gods," "who seeth

\[Lugal-durma<u>h</u>, "the King\] <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161)
of the band of the gods," "the Lord of rulers,"

"Who is exalted in a royal habitation,"

"\[Who\] among the gods is gloriously supreme!"

\[Adu-nuna\], "the Counsellor of Ea," who created the gods his fathers,

Unto the path of whose majesty

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

\[No\] god can ever attain!

\[... in\] Dul-azag he made it known,

105\. \[...\] ... \[...\] him,

106\. \[...\] ... the star, which \[shineth in the heavens\].

107\. May he hold the Beginning and the Future <span
id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_162), may they <span
id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_163) pay homage unto him,

108\. Saying, "He who forced his way through the midst of Tiamat
\[without resting\],

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

109\. "Let his name be Nibiru, 'the Seizer of the Midst'!

112\. "He conquered Tiamat, he troubled and ended her life,"

113\. In the future of mankind, when the days grow old,

114\. May this be heard without ceasing, may it hold sway for ever!

115\. Since he created the realm (of heaven) and fashioned the firm
earth,

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

116\. "The Lord of the World," the father Bêl hath called his name.

117\. (This) title, which all the Spirits of Heaven proclaimed,

118\. Did Ea hear, and his spirit was rejoiced, (and he said):

119\. "He whose name his fathers have made glorious,

120\. "Shall be even as I, his name shall be Ea!

121\. "The binding of all my decrees shall he control,

122\. "All my commands shall he make known! "

123\. By the name of "Fifty" did the great gods

124\. Proclaim his fifty names, they made his path pre-eminent." <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_164)

### Epilogue

125\. Let them <span id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_165) be held in
remembrance, and let the first man proclaim them;

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

126\. Let the wise and the understanding consider them together!

127\. Let the father repeat them and teach them to his son;

128\. Let them be in the ears of the pastor and the shepherd!

129\. Let a man rejoice in Marduk, the Lord of the gods,

130\. That he may cause his land to be fruitful, and that he himself may
have prosperity!

131\. His word standeth fast, his command is unaltered;

132\. The utterance of his mouth hath no god ever annulled.

133\. He gazed in his anger, he turned not his neck;

134\. When he is wroth, no god can withstand his indignation.

135\. Wide is his heart, broad is his compassion;

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

136\. The sinner and evil-doer in his presence \[...\].

137\. They received instruction, they spake before him,

138\. \[...\] unto \[...\].

139\. \[...\] of Marduk may the gods \[...\].

140\. \[May\] they \[... his \] name \[...\]!

141\. \[...\] they took and \[...\];

142\. \[...\]! <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_157"></span>[93:1](stc10.htm#fr_157) The title Tutu is
there explained as *ba-a-nu*, " creator," while its two component parts
(TU + TU) occur in the Sumerian version of the line as the equivalents
of *la-nu-u* and *e-di-<u>sh</u>u*.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[97:1](stc10.htm#fr_158) The text of the
commentary read *mu-kin*, i.e. "the Founder of Purification"; for other
variant readings in the line, see Appendix I.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[99:1](stc10.htm#fr_159) Literally, "the
black-headed ones."

<span id="fn_160"></span>[103:1](stc10.htm#fr_160) In the margin of the
fragment K. 13,761 every tenth line is indicated by the figure "10."

<span id="fn_161"></span>[105:1](stc10.htm#fr_161) The word
*durma<u>h</u>u* was employed as a Babylonian priestly title. It may
here be rendered by some such general phrase as "ruler," unless it is to
be taken as a proper name.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[107:1](stc10.htm#fr_162) ... The expression
*rê<u>sh</u>u-arkât*, literally "the beginning—the future," may be taken
as implying Marduk's complete control over the world, both at its
creation and during its subsequent existence. It is possible that
*s'u-nu* is the pronominal suffix and should be attached to the
preceding word, i.e. rê<u>sh</u>-arkâtu-<u>sh</u>u-nu, "their beginning
and future," that is, "the beginning and future of mankind."

<span id="fn_163"></span>[107:2](stc10.htm#fr_163) I.e., mankind.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[111:1](stc10.htm#fr_164) From the commentary
R. 366, etc., and the explanatory text S. 747, it may be concluded that
the Seventh Tablet, in its original form, ended at 1. 124. It is
probable that ll. 125-142 were added as an epilogue at the time when the
composition was incorporated in the Creation Series (see Appendix I).

<span id="fn_165"></span>[111:2](stc10.htm#fr_165) I.e., the names of
Marduk.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[115:1](stc10.htm#fr_166) This is probably the
last line of the tablet. It may here be noted that, for the text of the
Seventh Tablet given in the preceding pages, only those fragments have
been used which are proved by the commentaries to contain missing
portions of the text. Several other fragments, which from their contents
and style of writing may possibly belong to copies of the text, have not
been. included. The text of one such fragment (S. 2,013) is of peculiar
interest and is given in Appendix II; in l. 10 f. it refers to *Ti-amat
e-li-ti* and *Ti-amat <u>sh</u>ap-li-ti*, "The Ocean (Tiamat) which is
above" and "The Ocean (Tiamat) which is beneath," a close parallel to
"the waters which were above the firmament" and "the waters which were
under the firmament" of Gen. i, 7; see the Introduction.
