<p>1. When in the height heaven was not named,</p>  
<p>2. And the earth beneath did not yet bear a name,</p>  
<p>3. And the primeval Aps&ucirc;, who begat them,</p>  
<p>4. And chaos, Tiamat, the mother of them both,&#8212;</p>  
<p>5. Their waters were mingled together,</p>  
<p>6. And no field was formed, no marsh was to be seen;</p>  
<p>7. When of the gods none had been called into being,</p>  
<p>8. And none bore a name, and no destinies [were ordained];</p>  
<p>9. Then were created the gods in the midst of [heaven],</p>  
<p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="green">p. 4</font></A> <a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></A></p>  
<p>10. La<u>h</u>mu and La<u>h</u>amu were called into being [...].</p>  
<p>11. Ages increased, [...],</p>  
<p>12. Then An<u>sh</u>ar and Ki<u>sh</u>ar were created, and over them [...].</p>  
<p>13. Long were the days, then there came forth [...]</p>  
<p>14. Anu, their son, [...]</p>  
<p>15. An<u>sh</u>ar and Anu [...]</p>  
<p>16. And the god Anu [...]</p>  
<p>17. Nudimmud, whom his fathers [his] begetters [...]</p>  
<p>18. Abounding in all wisdom, [...]</p>  
<p>19. He was exceeding strong [...]</p>  
<p>20. He had no rival [...]</p>  
<p>21. (Thus) were established and [were ... the great gods (?)].</p>  
<p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A> <a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></A></p>  
<p>22 . But T[iamat and &Acirc;ps&ucirc;] were (still) in confusion [...],</p>  
<p>23. They were troubled and [...]</p>  
<p>24. In disorder(?) ... [...]</p>  
<p>26. And Tiamat roared [...]</p>  
<p>25. Aps&ucirc; was not diminished in might [...]</p>  
<p>27. She smote, and their deeds [...]</p>  
<p>28. Their way was evil ... [...] ...</p>  
<p>29. Then Aps&ucirc;, the begetter of the great gods,</p>  
<p>30. Cried unto Mummu, his minister, and said unto him:</p>  
<p>31. "O Mummu, thou minister that rejoicest my spirit,</p>  
<p>32. "Come, unto Tiamat let us [go]!"</p>  
<p>33. So they went and before Tiamat they lay down,</p>  
<p>34. They consulted on a plan with regard to the gods [their sons].</p>  
<p>35. Aps&ucirc; opened his mouth [and spake],</p>  
<p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></A> <a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></A></p>  
<p>36. And unto Tiamat, the glistening one, he addressed [the word]:</p>  
<p>37. "[...] their way [...],</p>  
<p>38. "By day I cannot rest, by night [I cannot lie down (in peace)].</p>  
<p>39. "But I will destroy their way, I will [...],</p>  
<p>40. "Let there be lamentation, and let us lie down (again in peace)."</p>  
<p>41. When Tiamat [heard] these words,</p>  
<p>42. She raged and cried aloud [...].</p>  
<p>43. [She ...] grievously [...],</p>  
<p>44. She uttered a curse, and unto [Aps&ucirc; she spake]:</p>  
<p>45. "What then shall we [do]?</p>  
<p>46. "Let their way be made difficult, and let us [lie down (again) in peace]."</p>  
<p>47. Mummu answered, and gave counsel unto Aps&ucirc;,</p>  
<p>48. [...] and hostile (to the gods) was the counsel Mu[mmu gave]:</p>  
<p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></A> <a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></A></p>  
<p>49. "Come, their way is strong, but thou shalt destroy [it];</p>  
<p>50. "Then by day shalt thou have rest, by night shalt thou lie down (in peace)."</p>  
<p>51. Aps&ucirc; [hearkened unto] him and his countenance grew bright,</p>  
<p>52. [Since] he (i.e. Mummu) planned evil against the gods his sons.</p>  
<p>53. [...] he was afraid [...],</p>  
<p>54. His knees [became weak(?)], they gave way beneath him,</p>  
<p>55. [Because of the evil] which their first-born had planned.</p>  
<p>56. [...] their [...] they altered(?).</p>  
<p>58. Lamentation [...] they sat in [sorrow] '</p>  
<p>57. [...] they [...],</p>  
<p>59. [...]</p>  
<p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></A> <a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></A></p>  
<p>60. Then Ea, who knoweth all that [is], went up and he beheld their muttering.</p>  
<p>61. [...]</p>  
<p>62. [...] ... his pure incantation</p>  
<p>63. [...] ... [...]</p>  
<p>64. [...]</p>  
<p>65. [...] misery</p>  
<p>66. [...]</p>  
<p>67. [...]</p>  
<p>[Lines 68-82 are wanting.]</p>  
<p>83. [...]</p>  
<p>84 [...] ...</p>  
<p>85. [...] the god Anu,</p>  
<p>86. [... an aven]ger.</p>  
<p>87. [...]</p>  
<p>88. [...] and he shall confound Tiamat.</p>  
<p>89. [...] he ...</p>  
<p>90. [...] for ever.</p>  
<p>91. [...] the evil,</p>  
<p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></A> <a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></A></p>  
<p>92. [...] ... he spake:</p>  
<p>93. "[...] thy [...] he hath conquered and</p>  
<p>94. " [...] he [weepeth] and sitteth in tribulation(?).</p>  
<p>95. "[...] of fear,</p>  
<p>96. "[...] we shall not lie down (in peace).</p>  
<p>97. "[...] Aps&ucirc; is laid waste(?),</p>  
<p>98. "[...] and Mummu, who were taken captive, in [...]</p>  
<p>99. "[...] thou didst, ...</p>  
<p>100. "[...] let us lie down (in peace).</p>  
<p>101. "[...] ... they will smite (?) [...].</p>  
<p>102. " [...] let us lie down (in peace).</p>  
<p>103. "[...] thou shalt take vengeance for them,</p>  
<p>104. "[...]unto the tempest shalt thou [...]!"</p>  
<p>105. [And Tiamat hearkened unto] the word of the bright god, (and said):</p>  
<p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></A> <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></A></p>  
<p>106. "[...] shalt thou entrust! let us wage [war]!"</p>  
<p>107. [...] the gods in the midst of [...]</p>  
<p>108. [...] for the gods did she create.'</p>  
<p>109. [They banded themselves together and] at the side of Tiamat [they] advanced;</p>  
<p>110. [They were furious, they devised mischief without resting] night and [day].</p>  
<p>111. [They prepared for battle], fuming and raging;</p>  
<p>112. [They joined their forces] and made war.</p>  
<p>113. [Ummu-<u>H</u>ubu]r, who formed all things,</p>  
<p>114. [Made in addition] weapons invincible, she spawned monster-serpents,</p>  
<p>115. [Sharp of] tooth, and merciless of fang;</p>  
<p>116. [With poison instead of] blood she filled [their] bodies.</p>  
<p>117. Fierce [monster-vipers] she clothed with terror,</p>  
<p>118. [With splendour] she decked them, [she made them] of lofty stature.</p>  
<p>119. [Whoever beheld] them, terror overcame him,</p>  
<p>120. Their bodies reared up and none could withstand [their attack].</p>  
<p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></A> <a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></A></p>  
<p>121. [She set] up vipers, and dragons, and the (monster) [La<u>h</u>amu],</p>  
<p>122. [And hurricanes], and raging hounds, and scorpion-men,</p>  
<p>123. And mighty [tempests], and fish-men, and[rams];</p>  
<p>124. [They bore] cruel weapons, without fear of [the fight].</p>  
<p>125. Her commands [were mighty], [none] could resist them;</p>  
<p>126. After this fashion, huge of stature, [she made] eleven (monsters).</p>  
<p>127. Among the gods who were her sons, inasmuch as he had given [her support],</p>  
<p>128. She exalted Kingu; in their midst [she raised] him [to power].</p>  
<p>129. To march before the forces, to lead [the host],</p>  
<p>130. To give the battle-signal, to advance to the attack,</p>  
<p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></A> <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></A></p>  
<p>131. To direct the battle, to control the fight,</p>  
<p>132. Unto him she entrusted; in [costly raiment] she made him sit, (saying):</p>  
<p>133. "I have uttered thy spell, in the assembly of the gods I have raised thee to power.</p>  
<p>134. "The dominion over all the gods [have I entrusted unto him].</p>  
<p>135. "Be thou exalted, thou my chosen spouse,</p>  
<p>136. "May they magnify thy name over all [of them ... the Anunnaki]."</p>  
<p>137. She gave him the Tablets of Destiny, on [his] breast she laid them, (saying):</p>  
<p>138. "Thy command shall not be without avail, and[the word of thy mouth shall be established]."</p>  
<p>139. Now Kingu, (thus) exalted, having received [the power of Anu],</p>  
<p>140. [Decreed] the fate among the gods his sons, (saying):</p>  
<p>141. "Let the opening of your mouth [quench] the Fire-god;</p>  
<p>142. "Whoso is exalted in the battle, let him [display (his) might]!"</p>
