# The Fifth Tablet

1\. He.(i.e. Marduk) made the stations for the great gods;

2\. The stars, their images, as the stars of the Zodiac, he fixed.

3\. He ordained the year and into sections he divided it;

4\. For the twelve months he fixed three stars.

5\. After he had \[...\] the days of the year \[...\] images,

6\. He founded the station of Nibir <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151)to determine their bounds;

7\. That none might err or go astray,

8\. He set the station of Bêl and Ea along with him.

9\. He opened great gates on both sides,

10\. He made strong the bolt on the left and on the right.

11\. In the midst thereof he fixed the zenith;

12\. The Moon-god he caused to shine forth, the night he entrusted to
him.

13\. He appointed him, a being of the night, to determine the days;

14\. Every month without ceasing with the crown he covered(?) him,
(saying):

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

15\. "At the beginning of the month, when thou shinest upon the land,

16\. "Thou commandest the horns to determine six days,

17\. "And on the seventh day to \[divide\] the crown.

18\. "On the fourteenth day thou shalt stand opposite, the half \[...\].

19\. "When the Sun-god on the foundation of heaven \[...\] thee,

20\. "The \[...\] thou shalt cause to ..., and thou shalt make his
\[...\].

21\. "\[...\] ... unto the path of the Sun-god shalt thou cause to draw
nigh,

22\. "\[And on the ... day\] thou shalt stand opposite, and the Sun-god
shall ... \[...\]

23\. "\[...\] to traverse her way.

24\. "\[...\] thou shalt cause to draw nigh, and thou shalt judge the
right.

25\. "\[...\] to destroy

26\. "\[...\] me.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[85:1](stc08.htm#fr_152) In the speech that
follows it may be conjectured that the gods complained that, although
Marduk had endowed the heavens with splendour and had caused plants to
live upon the earth, yet there were no shrines built in honour of the
gods, and there were no worshippers devoted to their service; see below,
p. 88, note 1
