DESCENT OF THE GODDESS ISHTAR INTO THE LOWER WORLD<BR>
[From The Civilization of Babylonia and Assyria, M. Jastrow, 1915]<BR>
</CENTER></H3>
<BR>
To the land of no return, the land of darkness,<BR>
Ishtar, the daughter of Sin directed her thought,<BR>
Directed her thought, Ishtar, the daughter of Sin,<BR>
To the house of shadows, the dwelling, of Irkalla,<BR>
To the house without exit for him who enters therein,<BR>
To the road, whence there is no turning,<BR>
To the house without light for him who enters therein,<BR>
The place where dust is their nourishment, clay their food.'<BR>
They have no light, in darkness they dwell.<BR>
Clothed like birds, with wings as garments,<BR>
Over door and bolt, dust has gathered.<BR>
Ishtar on arriving at the gate of the land of no return,<BR>
To the gatekeeper thus addressed herself:<BR>
<BR>
"Gatekeeper, ho, open thy gate!<BR>
Open thy gate that I may enter!<BR>
If thou openest not the gate to let me enter,<BR>
I will break the door, I will wrench the lock,<BR>
I will smash the door-posts, I will force the doors.<BR>
I will bring up the dead to eat the living.<BR>
And the dead will outnumber the living."<BR>
The gatekeeper opened his mouth and spoke,<BR>
Spoke to the lady Ishtar:<BR>
"Desist, O lady, do not destroy it.<BR>
I will go and announce thy name to my queen Ereshkigal."<BR>
The gatekeeper entered and spoke to Ereshkigal:<BR>
"Ho! here is thy sister, Ishtar ...<BR>
Hostility of the great powers ...<BR>
When Ereshkigal heard this,<BR>
As when one hews down a tamarisk she trembled,<BR>
As when one cuts a reed, she shook:<BR>
"What has moved her heart [seat of the intellect] what has stirred her liver [seat of the emotions]?<BR>
Ho there, does this one wish to dwell with me?<BR>
To eat clay as food, to drink dust as wine?<BR>
I weep for the men who have left their wives.<BR>
I weep for the wives torn from the embrace of their husbands;<BR>
For the little ones cut off before their time.<BR>
Go, gatekeeper, open thy gate for her,<BR>
Deal with her according to the ancient decree."<BR>
The gatekeeper went and opened his gate to her:<BR>
Enter, O lady, let Cuthah greet thee.<BR>
<BR>
Let the palace of the land of no return rejoice at thy presence!<BR>
<BR>
He bade her enter the first gate, which he opened wide, and took the large crown off her head:<BR>
"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the large crown off my head?"<BR>
"Enter, O lady, such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<BR>
The second gate he bade her enter, opening it wide, and removed her earrings:<BR>
"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove my earrings?"<BR>
"Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<BR>
The third gate he bade her enter, opened it wide, and removed her necklace:<BR>
"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove my necklace? "<BR>
"Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<BR>
The fourth gate he bade her enter, opened it wide, and removed the ornaments of her breast:<BR>
"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the ornaments of my breast?  "<BR>
"Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<BR>
The fifth gate he bade her enter, opened it wide, and removed the girdle of her body studded with birthstones.<BR>
"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the girdle of my body, studded with birth-stones?"<BR>
"Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<BR>
The sixth gate, he bade her enter, opened it wide, and removed the spangles off her hands and feet.<BR>
"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the spangles off my hands and feet?"<BR>
"Enter, O lady, for thus are the decrees of Ereiihkigal."<BR>
The seventh gate he bade her enter, opened it wide, and removed her loin-cloth.<BR>
"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove my loin-cloth ?"<BR>
"Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<BR>
Now when Ishtar had gone down into the land of no return,<BR>
Ereshkigal saw her and was angered at her presence.<BR>
Ishtar, without reflection, threw herself at her [in a rage].<BR>
Ereshkigal opened her mouth and spoke,<BR>
To Namtar, her messenger, she addressed herself:<BR>
"Go Namtar, imprison her in my palace.<BR>
Send against her sixty disease, to punish Ishtar.<BR>
Eye-disease against her eyes,<BR>
Disease of the side against her side,<BR>
Foot-disease against her foot,<BR>
Heart-disease against her heart,<BR>
Head-disease against her head,<BR>
Against her whole being, against her entire body."<BR>
After the lady Ishtar had gone down into the land of no return,<BR>
The bull did not mount the cow, the ass approached not the she-ass,<BR>
To the maid in the street, no man drew near<BR>
The man slept in his apartment,<BR>
The maid slept by herself.<BR>
<BR>
[The second half of the poem, the reverse of the tablet, continues is follows:]<BR>
<BR>
The countenance of Papsukal, the messenger of the great gods, fell, his face was troubled.<BR>
In mourning garb he was clothed, in soiled garments clad.<BR>
Shamash [the sun-god] went to Sin [the moon-god], his father, weeping,<BR>
In the presence of Ea, the King, he went with flowing tears.<BR>
"Ishtar has descended into the earth and has not come up.  The bull does not mount the cow, the ass does not approach the she-ass.<BR>
The man does not approach the maid in the street,<BR>
The man sleeps in his apartment,<BR>
The maid sleeps by herself."<BR>
Ea, in the wisdom of his heart, formed a being,<BR>
He formed Asu-shu-namir the eunuch.<BR>
Go, Asu-shu-namir, to the land of no return direct thy face!<BR>
The seven gates of the land without return be opened before thee,<BR>
May Eresbkigal at sight of thee rejoice!<BR>
After her heart has been assuaged, her liver quieted,<BR>
Invoke against her the name of the great gods,<BR>
Raise thy head    direct thy attention to the khalziku skin.<BR>
"Come, lady, let them give me the khalziku skin, that I may drink water out of it."<BR>
When Ereshkigal heard this, she struck her side, bit her finger,<BR>
Thou hast expressed a wish that can not be granted.<BR>
Go, Asu-sbu-iaamir, I curse thee with a great curse,<BR>
The sweepings of the gutters of the city be thy food,<BR>
The drains of the city be thy drink,<BR>
The shadow of the wall be thy abode,<BR>
The thresholds be thy dwelling-place;<BR>
Drunkard and sot strike thy cheek!"<BR>
Ereshkigal opened her mouth and spoke,<BR>
To Namtar, her messenger, she addressed herself.<BR>
"Go, Namtar, knock at the strong palace,<BR>
Strike the threshold of precious stones,<BR>
Bring out the Anunnaki, seat them on golden thrones.<BR>
Sprinkle Ishtar with the waters of life and take her out of my presence.<BR>
Namtar went, knocked at the strong palace,<BR>
Tapped on the threshold of precious stones.<BR>
He brought out the Anunnaki and placed them on golden thrones,<BR>
He sprinkled Ishtar with the waters of life and took hold of her.<BR>
Through the first gate he led her out and returned to her her loin-cloth.<BR>
Through the second gate he led her out and returned to her the spangles of her hands and feet<BR>
Through the third gate he led her out and returned to her the girdle of her body, studded with birth-stones.<BR>
Through the fourth gate he led her out and returned to her the ornaments of her breast.<BR>
Through the fifth gate he led her out and returned to her her necklace.<BR>
Through the sixth gate he led her out and returned her earrings.<BR>
Through the seventh gate he led her out and returned to her the large crown for her head.<BR>
<BR>
[The following lines are in the form of an address -apparently to some one who has sought release for a dear one from the portals of the lower world.]<BR>
<BR>
"If she (Ishtar) will not grant thee her release,<BR>
To Tammuz, the lover of her youth,<BR>
Pour out pure waters, pour out fine oil;<BR>
With a festival garment deck him that he may play on the flute of lapis lazuli,<BR>
That the votaries may cheer his liver. [his spirit]<BR>
Belili [sister of Tammuz] had gathered the treasure,<BR>
With precious stones filled her bosom.<BR>
When Belili heard the lament of her brother, she dropped her treasure,<BR>
She scattered the precious stones before her,<BR>
"Oh, my only brother, do not let me perish!<BR>
On the day when Tammuz plays for me on the flute of lapis lazuli, playing it for me with the porphyry ring.<BR>
Together with him, play ye for me, ye weepers and lamenting women!<BR>
That the dead may rise up and inhale the incense."<BR>
