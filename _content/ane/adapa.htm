ADAPA AND THE FOOD OF LIFE<BR>
[from "Cuneiform Parallels to the Old Testament " by R.W. Rogers, 1912].<BR>

<BR>
[Summary: Adapa, or perhaps Adamu, son of Ea, had recieved from his father, the god Ea, wisdom, but not eternal life.
He was a semi-divine being and was the wise man and priest of the temple of Ea at Eridu, which he provided with the ritual bread and water.  
In the exercise of this duty he carried on fishing upon the Persian Gulf.  
When Adapa was fishing one day on a smooth sea, the south wind rose suddenly and overturned his boat, so that the was thrown into the sea.  
Angered by the mishap, he broke the wings of the south wind so that for seven days it could not blow the sea's coolness over the hot land.  
Anu calls Adapa to account for this misdeed, and his father Ea warns him as to what should befall him.  
He tells him how to fool Tammuz and Gishzida, who will meet him at the gate of heaven.  
Ea cautions him not to eat or drink anything in heaven, as Ea fears that the food and drink of death will be set before Adapa.  
However, the food and drink of eternal life are set before him instead, and Adapa's over-caution deprives him of immortality.  
He has to return to Earth instead.]<BR>

O South wind, on the way I shall to thee  ... everything that,<BR>
Thy wing, will I break." As be spoke with his mouth,<BR>
The wing of the South wind was broken, seven davs<BR>
The South wind blew not upon the land.  Anu<BR>
Called to his messenger Ilabrat:<BR>
Why has the South wind not blown upon the land for seven davs?<BR>

Adapa, the son of Ea, the wing of the South wind<BR>
Has broken."<BR>

He cried, Help!" He ascended his throne,<BR>
"Let some one bring him,"<BR>
Likewise Ea, who knows the heaven.  He roused him<BR>
... he caused him to wear.  With a mourning garment<BR>
He garbed him, and gave him counsel<BR>
Saying: " Adapa, before the face of Anu the King thou art to go<BR>
... to heaven<BR>
When thou comest up, and when thou approachest the door of Anu,<BR>
At the door of Anu, Tammuz and Gishzida are standing,<BR>
"they will see thee, they will ask thee; 'Sir,'<BR>
For whose sake dost thou so appear, Adapa?  For whom<BR>
Art thou clad in a mourning garment?' 'In our country two gods have vanished, therefore<BR>
Am I so.' 'Who are the two gods, who in the land<BR>
Have vanished?' 'Tammuz and Gishzida.' They will look at one another and<BR>
Be astonished.  Good words<BR>
They will speak to Anu.  A good countenance of Anu<BR>
They will show thee.  When thou standest before Anu<BR>
Food of death they will set before thee,<BR>
Eat not.  Water of death they will set before thee,<BR>
Drink not. Garments they will set before thee,<BR>
Put them on.  Oil they will set before thee, anoint thyself.<BR>
The counsel that I have given thee, forget not.  The words<BR>
Which I have spoken, hold fast." The messenger<BR>
Of Anu came: "Adapa has broken<BR>
The wing of the South wind.  Bring him before me."<BR>
The road to Heaven he made him take, and to Heaven he ascended.<BR>
When he came to Heaven, when he approached the door of Anu,<BR>
At the door of Ann, Tammuz and Gisbzida are standing.<BR>
When they saw him, Adapa, they cried: " Help,<BR>
Sir, for whom dost thou so appear?  Adapa,<BR>
For whom art thou clad in a mourning garment?"<BR>

In mourning garments." "Who are the two gods, who<BR>
have vanished from the land?"<BR>
"Tammuz and Gishzida." They looked at one another and<BR>
Were astonished.  When Adapa before Anu, the King,<BR>
Drew near, and Anu saw him, he cried:<BR>
" Come hither, Adapa.  Why hast thou broken the wings<BR>
Of the South wind?  " Adapa answered Ann: " My lord,<BR>
For the house of my lord in the midst of the sea,<BR>
I was catching fish.  The sea was like a mirror,<BR>
The South wind blew, and capsized me.<BR>
To the house of my lord was I driven.  In the anger of my heart,<BR>
I took heed." Tammuz and Gishzida<BR>
Answered ... "art thou." To Anu<BR>
