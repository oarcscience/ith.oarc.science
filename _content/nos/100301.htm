<P>Here is Mr. Fortin's analysis of the Nostradamus quatrain XII 52.
It represents his opinions only, however he has a much better
understanding of the cultural and linguistic background of Nostradamus
than I do.<I>--jbh</I></P>

In the English version there is mention of Aiguesmorte, the fortified city in 
the Camargues, region of Provence, south of France. But the original French version 
mention Tour D'Aigues which is a different place. The Ch&acirc;teau de la Tour 
D'Aigues is up north near Pertuis also in Provence. 
<p>1.Deux corps, vn chef. champs diui&#131;ez en deux<br>
  2.Et puis re&#131;pondre &agrave; quatre non ouys. <br>
  3.Petis pour Grands. &agrave; Pertuis mal pour eux. <br>
  4.Tour D'Aigues foudre. pire pour En&#131;&#131;ouis. </p>
<p>1. "Deux corps" is two armies as in "corps d'arm&eacute;e" (army corp). "vn chef" 
  (one chief, leader). "champs diui&#131;ez en deux", fields divided in two. In 
  the medieval period, some fields were divided by stone walls to delimitate kingdoms. 
  It could be a vision of these two armies advancing on fields seperated by such 
  wall or a natural element (river, cliff etc..). </p>
<p>2. "Et puis re&#131;pondre &agrave; quatre non ouys" (And then respond to four non 
  heard). Four "non ouys" could be four semaphores or flag signs. Messages seen 
  from a distance but unheard. Interpretation : "Then responding to four signals" 
</p>
<p>3. "Petis pour Grands, &agrave; Pertuis mal pour eux". Petis pour Grands (Smalls for 
  Talls) could be as simple as Children and Adults ("Les petits et les grands" 
  is a common expression in french). Pertuis* is an old town 6 km south of Tour 
  D'Aigues. "Mal" is used as misfortune, grief, pain (not evil). Interpretation 
  : Children and Adults , in Pertuis grief for them. </p>
<p>4. "Tour D'Aigues foudre". Tour D'Aigues is the 16th century castle as mentioned 
  ealier."Foudre" (thunder) in french can be used in a figurative sens (in english 
  as well) for retaliation or being attacked. As in "S'attirer les foudres de 
  l'ennemis" (to provoque the ennemy's thunder). En&#131;&#131;ouis in "Pire pour 
  En&#131;&#131;ouis" would be Ansouis* (pronounced the same), another medieval 
  castle 7 km east of Tour D'Aigues. Interpretation : Tour D'Aigues attacked, 
  worst for Ansouis.</p>

<p>Review :<br>
  Two armies, one leader, advancing on divided fields<br>
  Then responding to four signals <br>
  Children and Adults , in Pertuis grief for them <br>
  Tour D'Aigues attacked, worst for Ansouis </p>
<p>My conclusion: This quatrain is about an invasion by an unidentified party 
  in a specific area in Provence, France. It doesn't seem that this prophecy occured 
  and it haven't been retained by Nostradamus exegetists in previous studies. Needless to say, nothing sounds familiar with 09/11/01.
