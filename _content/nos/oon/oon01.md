TO MY MOTHER

Οὐδὲν ἐν ἀνθρώποισι πατρὸς καὶ μετρὸς ἄμενον  
Ἔπλετο, τοῖσ ὁσίη, Κύρνε, μέμηλε δίκη.

THEOGNIS, p. 16, ed. 1766.

"But higher far my proud pretensions rise,--  
The son of parents passed into the skies."

COWPER, On My Mother's Picture, line 110.

IF THERE CAN BE ANYTHING IN A BOOK LIKE THIS WORTHY OF DEDICATION TO A
BEING SO NOBLE AS THOU IN LIFE WERT EVER, A BEING NOW MORE ENNOBLED
STILL BY THE HEAVEN-BLEACHED RAIMENT OF IMMORTALITY PUT ON; TO THEE,
PURE SOUL SERENE! TO THEE DOES THY STILL LOVING SON, EARTH-HAMPERED,
DEDICATE THIS THE BEST LABOUR OF HIS HEART AND HEAD AND YEARS. THE BEST
OF IT IS THINE INDEED ALREADY; AND WERE THE REST WORSE HARVESTED THAN
PERHAPS IT IS,--MORTALITY BEING ALLOWED FOR DULY,--THY SOUL RECEIVING
MUST BE MUCH CHANGED BY EXALTATION, IF QUEEN-LIKE, IT CANNOT MAKE A
SORRY LOVE-GIFT RICH BY GOLDEN WELCOME GIVEN IT.

IF THINGS OF KITH BE KIN, GOD WILLING, WE SHALL MEET AGAIN ERE LONG.
TILL WHEN, FROM THIS BARE HEATH TERRENE AND HOMELESS, I SPEED THE WORD
ADIEU. DEAR ONE! FOR A LITTLE WHILE ADIEU.

THY SON,            
Mr. C. A. W.
