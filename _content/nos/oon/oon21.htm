<p>By the overthrow of Louis Philippe and the Republic two bastard governments, Louis Napoleon will now succeed to the throne, a nephew by blood of Napoleon Bonaparte; and, what is not generally known, he was the only one of the Bonaparte family born in the Palace of the Tuileries. In battle afterwards at Lectoyre (<i>coups de dards</i> must be taken simply as battle) the nephew will furl his standard through fear.</p> 
<p>Writing in 1866, M. le Pelletier particularly remarks that the epoch is left undetermined, and, as to the enigma of <i>Lectoyre</i>, nothing can be known till the event has transpired.</p> 
<p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> It may then be interpreted, he thinks, in some of the idioms known to Nostradamus--Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Celtic, Languedoc, etc. He considers the standard to present a further enigma, and asks "What standard?" This difficulty I do not quite recognize. The imperial standard that is adopted by him, whatever it may be. To furl a standard is to close and shut it up, so that no one will rally to it any more. It symbolizes that the cause it represents is brought to the ground finally, and that it is no longer flying.</p> 
<p>As to the word <i>Lectoyre</i>, we now know that, if it is to be interpreted at all, it will have to be found in connection with Sedan,--the noblest reminiscence connected with which is that it was the birthplace of that great soldier and greater man, Marshal Turenne. He may well be called <i>La gloire de Sedan</i>, whilst as appropriately may Napoleon the Little be designated as <i>C&eacute;dant de la gloire</i>, with that furled ensign, <i>qu'il par peur pliera</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p> 
<p>After much difficulty and searching I have at last come upon two old maps, printed at Amsterdam by Blaeuw; the one dated 1620 and the other 1650, styled "Les Soverainetez de Sedan." In both of these the embattled town of Sedan is given, as seated on the right bank of the river Meuse, whilst on the left bank is shown an extensive territory named <i>Grand Torcy</i> and <i>Petit Torcy</i>. In another map it is given as <i>Torsy</i>. These maps give no indication of the points of the compass. But from another map, indicating them, the river-bend on which the town is seated appears to run from east to west; and, if so, Torcy lies south or south-west of Sedan. In a more modern map it appears as <i>Le Grand Torcy</i> and is described as lying "sur la route imp&eacute;riale de</p> 
<p>

<p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="green">p. 297</font></A></p> 
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Mezieres a Sedan." Evidently therefore we are entitled to place <i>Le Torcy</i> at Sedan. The French must determine for themselves, by their military bureau, whether the French camp was pitched in the meadows of <i>Le Torcy</i>; but nothing can alter the great fact, as now for the first time made plain, that the <i>Nepveu du sang</i> furled his standard for ever at Sedan or <i>Lectoyre</i>, as the oracle gives it. Now <i>Lectoyre</i> is the precise anagram, letter for letter, of <i>Le Torcey</i>, though the commoner spelling is without the second <i>e</i>, <i>Le Torcy</i>. If we are to reckon this as being a chance coincidence, my only further comment will be, that such chance as this is quite as miraculous as any miracle in the world could be.</p> 
<p>As regards the words "<i>nepveu du sang</i>," there was a caricature very popular in France at the time of the candidature for the French presidency, consisting of two pictures. In one the Prince de Joinville was commending himself to the French people for election, having the young Comte de Paris by the hand, and saying, "I am the uncle of my nephew." On the other side Louis Napoleon presses his suit by pointing to a statuette of Napoleon Bonaparte and uttering the words, "I am the nephew of my uncle;" showing how characteristically <i>nepveu du sang</i> designates Prince Louis Napoleon. He may almost be said to have chosen it himself as a cognomen.</p> <i>

<p>I propose here to make the meaning as clear as I can without a translation.</p> 
<p>Napoleon III. (<i>le procr&eacute;e</i>), the natural offspring of the French Republic (<i>Ogmion</i>), will turn from the right road for seven or nine years before his fall. Le Pelletier interprets otherwise. He says that the war in Italy began in the seventh year of the Empire, 1869, and from that date throughout the nine following years he changed his policy. I think the line means that from seven to nine years before the end of his reign he changed his policy. That is to say, from seven years previous to the close of his reign, when Charles August Louis, Duc de Morny, died, <i>i.e.</i> in 1865; and even for two years previously to that, things took a different turn. De Morny no longer exercised active control, and his was the head that had guided I all along. When he died, all ran to destruction. The <i>roi de longue</i> and his friend <i>my hom</i>, Le Pelletier states to be Victor Emmanuel and Garibaldi; one of long race and one of low birth, the tallow-smelter. I think it is Frederic William, <i>de longue vie</i>, and Bismarck, the <i>bi-valve</i> man, which it becomes, if we read it as <i>my-homme</i>. I have a great idea that <i>&agrave; Navarre</i> is a misprint for <i>le nepveu</i>. Whether <i>fort de Pau</i> may mean with his health re-established by staying at Pau or not, I cannot say. But, anyhow, I think that the two last lines are to be read together, and that he is to prostrate himself to the King and his friend. Louis Napoleon's whole reign must be represented as a failure, if you read it with Le Pelletier; mine makes it a failure during the last seven to nine years. My King and friend bring about the catastrophe far below the date that his will do. My emendation to <i>le nepveu</i> certainly clarifies the meaning. The explanation of Pau is not quite so comprehensible as I could wish; had <i>Ham</i> been a variant it would have spoken for itself.</p>

<p>The Quatrain 53 of Century VIII., which I have already explained as the flotilla of Napoleon Bonaparte, M. le Pelletier fixes as the ludicrous Boulogne expedition of Louis Napoleon, and the Italian campaign after he became Emperor; but I think he entirely fails in reading the symbols.</p> <i>

<p>Fulminating mercury (<i>feu vif</i>) in bombs in terrible explosion contains death hidden. The city, Paris, will be startled with powder liberated (<i>lasch&eacute;</i>, loosed) by assassins by night. The city will seem on fire. But the enemy (in spite of himself) will prove favourable to Napoleon. This, of course, is Orsini's attempt of January 14, 1858.</p>

<p>The peristyle (<i>la grand arq'</i>) of the opera shall be completely shattered.

The plot was conceived in the secret lodges of the Demagoguy [<i>de Dame</i>], whose members wear the beard and hair long. Orsini, the leader of the whole, will be surprised astutely by the confessions of Gomez at the restaurant Broggi, whither he had fled, and, being taken, will be sentenced to death.</p>

<p>The second of the Napoleonic race in power will cause England and Hanover to expend 100,000 marks in fortifications and war material. Fearing invasion after the Orsini effort, he will then exploit the Italian campaign, though vainly, as he will not reap the results he looks for.</p> 
<p>This corresponds so clearly with what happened that probably most will agree that it is a very remarkable forecast.</p> <i>

<p>We have to note here that Nostradamus, whenever he emerges from the impassibility of the <i>secret estude</i>, it is to exhibit a profound hostility to the genius of Democracy and Revolution.

<p>able to lay before the world with its meaning rendered transparent by the correspondence of interpretation with an event in history. The number of such correlations of occurrence with forecast falls immensely short of the number of the quatrains themselves. In fact, only about one hundred and fifty-one, out of a thousand. The rest give no scintillation as yet, but lie without sign of existence traceable, dead as a flint, till the iron stroke of Time's heel shall develop the spark. <i>Lateat scintillula forsan.</i> One or two Presages and two or three Sixains have been also resolved, Enough, we trust, has been opened up to show what a treasure-house it is that we have entered into, how rich in curiosity, if in nothing more. What may still lie perdu in the bulky remainder of eight hundred and fifty it is impossible to say; whether, though unidentified, they have been realized already, or are yet to bud in the future. If nothing more be ever done with Nostradamus than this book gives, still the work must for one reason or other hereafter stand out as the most wonderful book of its kind that was ever written or printed in this world. It has now to go forth and take its chance, good or evil, of notice or of neglect amongst the mass of printed matter, largely rubbish, that deluges our life. It is certainly calculated, so far as it can secure any attention whatever, to severely shock the prejudices now prevalent amongst mankind. The half-educated will find it troublesome to read, and disturbing, perhaps, to think about; whilst the scientific may even denounce it as a locust-cloud of darkness medi&aelig;val in its tendency. Undoubtedly it must have the effect that Nostradamus in his preface to his son (see <A HREF="oon06.htm#page_45">p. 45</A>) says very graphically it will have, "que possible fera retirer le front &agrave; quelques uns." Although, as he says again, the forecasts may be</p> 
<p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="green">p. 304</font></A></p> 
<p>clouded, they will be understood by men of sense, and they will grow clearer as ignorance dies out (see <A HREF="oon06.htm#page_49">p. 49</A>); which should be our care now.</p> 
<p>To all objectors I rejoin, gentlemen, investigate, please, all the points in question as searchingly as you can; find every fault in my work, and in that of the other Nostradamic commentators, that you can; expose all that is weak or illusive, wherever you find it to be so. Let us see, then, how far all the learning and acuteness you can bring to bear, coupled with whatever established prejudice, and its rancour at being disturbed in comfortable somnolency, can suggest, to overthrow what other men heretofore, and I now, have taken so much pains to bring together and give shape to. Consciously I have not set down a single word with any other desire than that the truth should prevail; and if your criticism can establish the opposite, I shall still repeat, "Let truth prevail." But I do not think you can do this: and if not, there is only one other thing, open to the learned and the wise that can be done,--that is, to rewrite their philosophies, so as to make room for the reception of this rather awkward piece of truth that has here got in the way of our old theories, and cannot be got out of the way again. To the really competent and candid reader I have nothing whatever to add beyond begging him to refer back to the closing words of my preface, as to him they will he found to contain my whole and entire message.</p>
