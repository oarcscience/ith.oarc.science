<p>THE Revolution (<i>la dechass&eacute;e</i>), repressed in 1816, shall again obtain the government. Its enemies will be treated as conspirators, and it will be stronger than ever. Seventy-three years are assured to its death-like rule. I give this as M. le Pelletier does, but I see no reason whatever to think that it is correct. Garenci&egrave;res makes it apply to Charles II. of England, and the seventy-three put to death are those who abetted the murder of his father. This is very vague. Garenci&egrave;res reads <i>Le dechass&eacute;</i>. Here we may remark that Napoleon himself [p. 280] dates his nobility from the battle of Montenotte, 1797, Seventy-three years added to this yields us the remarkable date of the fall of his dynasty at Sedan, 1870,</p>

<p>The meaning is, Napoleon shall arise, who will reawaken the solemn curse on Rome uttered by Hannibal, when he called the infernal gods to witness his hatred to her, to the terror of all mortals. Not Babel at the dispersion brought on the world more horror, nor days of more evil-ploughing for the present or seed-sowing for the future than shall fall upon the Roman world by him. This is much better than to limit it to an ecclesiastical area merely. We shall see that Charles V. is a sort of prototype of Napoleon, and Garenci&egrave;res adduces Charles V. as fulfilling this prophecy. Hannibal is also a prototype of Napoleon in attacking Italy by crossing the Alps.</p> <i>

<p>chose Barabbas for Pontifex or Generalissimo. A cruelly entreated people; whose burdens are aggravated by wickedness in high places needlessly, above and beyond the grief, which every man is born to by the act of birth into a world of sickness, sorrow, and injustice; sighs heavily at this unduly heaped-up burden, and that sigh, that <i>vox populi</i>, runs upward like a lightning conductor to elicit fire from the clouds, coming back charged with electricity and thunder,--a <i>vox Dei</i> of terrible divinity. But when scum rises to the direction, as with the Revolutionists, and is followed by some brutalized <i>sabreur</i> aggrandizing himself as king of chaos and disorder, with shouts of subservient applause from the smutty mob, saying, "Herod, thou art a god," the <i>vox populi</i> that split the welkin once, is now the <i>vox infernorum demonum</i>, the whole upspring and outcome of which is bestiality and lawlessness enthroned in defiance of the decalogue and heaven. Thenceforth the appeal of all good men and sane is, "Ye who worship God, good and alone from eternity, down with them." The men must work and serve. This fiat is in the air, is in the sea, is on the earth. It is the <i>vox natur&aelig;</i>, in comparison with which the people's voice, <i>vox populi</i>, is nothing, beyond a momentary troubling of the silences.</p> 
<p>The following quatrain I give for what it may be thought worth. M. le Pelletier thinks it to relate to the creation of assignats, December 19, 1789. It would be a pity to lose sight of his identification, if even some should presume it to be incorrect.</p> <i>

<p>Las! qu'on verra grand peuple tourment&eacute;,<br> Et la loi saincte en totale ruine;<br> Par autres loix route la Chrestient&eacute;;<br> Quand d'or d'argent trouv&eacute; nouvelle mine.</p></dir> </dir>

<p>Alas! how great a people shall tormented be,<br> And holy law in utter ruin laid:<br> By newer laws all Christendom is vexed,<br> With a new mine of gold and silver found.</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>We shall see, alas! the French people (<i>grand peuple</i>) agitated, the Catholic religion (<i>la loy saincte</i>) totally ruined, all Christendom put under new laws, when the National Assembly decrees that four hundred million assignats shall .be issued (<i>nouvelle mine d'or</i>, etc.), secured on the property of the clergy, in the interests of the Revolution.</p> 
<p>Older commentators applied this to the paper-money schemes of Law 1716; and Garenci&egrave;res finds the fulfilment in the discovery of the Spanish-American gold and silver mines.</p> 
<p>A properly regulated paper-money issue, based on the taxation of a State, having absolutely no intrinsic value whatever in itself, could undoubtedly be converted into a circulating medium that would work more smoothly than any metallic one can, because the market value of the ore, employed as now in coinage, is perpetually introducing a fluctuation of values that conflicts with the nominal standard of the coin, so that the standard is never uniform. The currency required would never amount to a tenth part of the taxation leviable. Paper could therefore be destroyed at the Bank of England, or issued exactly according to the needs of trade and commerce. Fluctuation in the market value of metals would no longer affect the circulating medium in the least. Thus might one cause of recurrent panics be removed for ever. But can bank directors or ministers be trusted with such a responsibility? This hinges on honesty, and there is none to spare.</p>

<p>The curse be on them for changing old landmarks. The provinces turned into departments (by decree of the Assembly, December 22, 1789). The sepulture of Kings violated at St. Denis.

<p>This, I think, refers to the sentimental advocacy of the Rights of man, as substitutionary of religion and faith in the literary movement of the eighteenth century. It would comprise Rousseau's gospel of dirt and sentimentality, Voltaire's substitution of wit for wisdom, and the science of the encyclop&aelig;dists floating disoriented upon the waters of un,, certainty, in lieu of the deep thought of the solitary thinkers that preceded them. These last were men who, heretofore walking humbly and without association in conspiracy, interrogated the universe, divinely sown with riddles in great abundance by a hand invisible, until they fell asleep into that hand, and awoke to the illuminated answers.</p> 
<p>The blood of sisters was the wholesale slaughter of women that distinguished the Revolution, whilst church altars were desecrated by naked women, set there to personate the goddess of impure reason, feigning <i>la sante dame</i>.</p> 
<p>The quatrain 25 that follows this in the text of Nostradamus I now give; but this verse 24, so far as I have seen, has never been commented upon nor has the connection been pointed out. Yet this stanza furnishes the reasons why the stars became overclouded to a people that were benighted, <i>par ces raisons</i>, as the reader will perceive by the second line that succeeds this.</p> <i>

<p>The infinite stars are links that light to doubt,<br> And drop the pall of night upon the soul:<br> The eye and front of man,--and soul,--grown cerebral,<br> God and His host withdraw; and with them prayer!</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>M. le Pelletier considers that Nostradamus attributes these effects to the reasonings hostile to the faith that improved optical instruments will introduce, as they suggest a plurality of worlds. I quite admit that in many minds this has been the tendency. Almost any discovery, giving a new hint as to infinitude, launches a number of inferior but vigorous brains into new lines of reasoning. We then get great multiplication of secondary volumes, which supply minced Aristotle or chaff to represent any amount of sausage-meat required by the reading public. Of course the further you can see by the telescope the further you put heaven away from the earth-dweller, and he loves it the less; for it is the near things we love, and not the remote. The heart is not universal, and cannot be stretched to it. I look upon the telescope, to an ordinary man, as a drain-pipe, through which he can run off and lose the moisture of his soul and live the worse for it afterwards; to the multitude of men, useless; to the scientific man, a means of inflation and puffing up; and to the really serious and isolated thinker, as the threshold of infinitude that may, though it has hardly yet done so, answer a few out of the ten million astral riddles sown in space. The last-named individual alone may benefit a little by it. But I question if anything at all of this was present to Nostradamus.</p> 
<p>He seems to me, in these two closely interlinked quatrains, to enlarge much upon the theme of St. Paul (Rom. i. 28) that, as at the French Revolution, "they did not like</p> 
<p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="green">p. 206</font></A></p> 
<p>to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind;" or one void of judgment, "to do things which are not convenient." So that the earth gave out deceptive voices to them, and false lights for Divine light, to slay women and desecrate the temples; and then that the very stars visible to the eye, which should teach faith to all, will for these reasons veil themselves and leave nothing to mankind but the darkness of night. Pure materialism follows, God and His host withdraw, and prayer is no more heard upon the earth.</p> <i>

<p>It is natural that Bouys, who has hunted Nostradamus for quatrains that will serve for adulation of Napoleon, has passed this over, <i>sub silentio</i>, entirely.

<p>The great Empire will soon be translated into a little place that quickly, will expand. An unworthy spot, a mere county, from the midst of which he will come to lay aside his sceptre.</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>Garenci&egrave;res interprets this of Charles V., who, three years before his death, resigned Spain and the Low Countries to Philip II., his son, and the empire to his brother Ferdinand. He then shut himself up in the Escurial, in Castile, a monastery; which the son afterwards enlarged into a grand palace. accounted by Spaniards as the eighth wonder of the world. But I am not aware that any one has yet pointed out that it fits Napoleon as patly just as it can Charles. His empire was cramped into Elba--&AElig;thalia, the soot island (<i>lieu bien infime</i>); a mere countship was his monarchy there. It soon</p> 
<p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></A></p> 
<p>grew again into an empire, but he only came out of its midst to resign his sceptre a second time and for ever.</p> 
<p>After these prelusory flourishes relating to the Vulgar Advent and French Revolution, we are now to enter upon a more special theme; the murder of the King, and the ragged beggars' festival and brawl, called the First Republic of the Sans Culottes.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_226"></A><A HREF="oon15.htm#fr_227">203:2</A> Sainte Dame I take to be equivalent to our English <i>Halidom</i>, consisting of Holy and Dome--a terminative seen in kingdom and Christendom, and signifying rule or lordship. It has also been written as <i>Holidame</i>, as if referring to the Virgin Mary. Of course, if that were the correct etymology, it would furnish the exact rendering of <i>Sainte Dame</i>: but, as it is, it is equivalent. A voice feigning that of the Blessed Virgin may well be represented by a voice feigning that of religion and faith. I take this from Garenci&egrave;res, and not the <i>texte-type</i>.</P>

Outre ce Saint, dont la vie est compl&egrave;tement inconnue, les bollandistes font mention d'un Napol&eacute;on, brilliant cavalier, neveu dc Cardinal Fossa-Nuova, qui se tua en tombant de cheval &agrave; Rome en 1218. Saint Dominique, temoin de la douleur du pauvre cardinal, ressuscita le jeune homme. Napol&eacute;on reconnut ce bienfait en menant une vie fort chretienne et, quand il fut mort pour tout de bon, l'&Eacute;glise le b&eacute;atifia. Toutefois, il n'avait pas sa place fixe dans le calendrier. Ce fut Pie VII. qui lui assigna pour sa f&ecirc;te la date du 15 ao&ucirc;t, dans le but sans doute de plaire &agrave; Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte."--"Grand Dictionnaire Universel du dixneuvi&egrave;me Si&egrave;cle," par M.
