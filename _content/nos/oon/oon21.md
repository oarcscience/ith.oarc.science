# Republic, 1848, and Napoleon III

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 5. \[I. 261.\]

Tiers <span id="fr_421"></span>[1](#fn_420) doigt du pied au premier

A un nouveau monarque de bas haut: <span

Translation.

The third <span id="fr_424"></span>[4](#fn_423) shall be a
stepping-stone to the throne,  
To a new monarch from low position to the top;  
He will as tyrant have taken a military post in Tuscany, <span
id="fr_425"></span>[5](#fn_424)  
And will seek to correct the defects of his predecessor.

THE National Assembly of 1848 shall serve as a foot to Louis Napoleon to
step from private life into a conspicuous position. He had in his youth
been concerned in the Revolution of Tuscany, and purposed correcting the
defect of his predecessor.

This might mean that he purposed to guide France better than Louis
Philippe had done, or than in four years the Republic had done, or,
which is most probable from his Idées Napoléoniennes, to carry to
completion the policy of

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

his uncle Napoleon I. I cannot think it refers to Napoleon II., Duc de
Reichstadt. The entire application of the quatrain is neither very clear
nor very important.

The quatrain on Cavaignac, I think, is hardly made out satisfactorily,
so I omit it.

Century VIII.--*Quatrain* 43. \[I. 265.\]

Par le decide <span id="fr_426"></span>[1](#fn_425) dc deux choses
bastards,  
Nepveu du sang <span id="fr_427"></span>[2](#fn_426) occupera le
regne: <span id="fr_428"></span>[3](#fn_427)  
Dedans Lectoyre <span id="fr_429"></span>[4](#fn_428) seront les coups
de dards,  
Nepveu par peur pliera l'enseigne.

Translation.

By the fall or ruin of two bastard things  
The nephew by blood will occupy the empire;  
In Lectoyre there will be deaths by arrow,  
The nephew will fold up his standard for very fear.

By the overthrow of Louis Philippe and the Republic two bastard
governments, Louis Napoleon will now succeed to the throne, a nephew by
blood of Napoleon Bonaparte; and, what is not generally known, he was
the only one of the Bonaparte family born in the Palace of the
Tuileries. In battle afterwards at Lectoyre (*coups de dards* must be
taken simply as battle) the nephew will furl his standard through fear.

Writing in 1866, M. le Pelletier particularly remarks that the epoch is
left undetermined, and, as to the enigma of *Lectoyre*, nothing can be
known till the event has transpired.

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It may then be
interpreted, he thinks, in some of the idioms known to
Nostradamus--Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Celtic, Languedoc, etc. He considers
the standard to present a further enigma, and asks "What standard?" This
difficulty I do not quite recognize. The imperial standard that is
adopted by him, whatever it may be. To furl a standard is to close and
shut it up, so that no one will rally to it any more. It symbolizes that
the cause it represents is brought to the ground finally, and that it is
no longer flying.

As to the word *Lectoyre*, we now know that, if it is to be interpreted
at all, it will have to be found in connection with Sedan,--the noblest
reminiscence connected with which is that it was the birthplace of that
great soldier and greater man, Marshal Turenne. He may well be called
*La gloire de Sedan*, whilst as appropriately may Napoleon the Little be
designated as *Cédant de la gloire*, with that furled ensign, *qu'il par
peur pliera*. <span id="fr_430"></span>[1](#fn_429)

After much difficulty and searching I have at last come upon two old
maps, printed at Amsterdam by Blaeuw; the one dated 1620 and the other
1650, styled "Les Soverainetez de Sedan." In both of these the embattled
town of Sedan is given, as seated on the right bank of the river Meuse,
whilst on the left bank is shown an extensive territory named *Grand
Torcy* and *Petit Torcy*. In another map it is given as *Torsy*. These
maps give no indication of the points of the compass. But from another
map, indicating them, the river-bend on which the town is seated appears
to run from east to west; and, if so, Torcy lies south or south-west of
Sedan. In a more modern map it appears as *Le Grand Torcy* and is
described as lying "sur la route impériale de

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mezieres a Sedan."
Evidently therefore we are entitled to place *Le Torcy* at Sedan. The
French must determine for themselves, by their military bureau, whether
the French camp was pitched in the meadows of *Le Torcy*; but nothing
can alter the great fact, as now for the first time made plain, that the
*Nepveu du sang* furled his standard for ever at Sedan or *Lectoyre*, as
the oracle gives it. Now *Lectoyre* is the precise anagram, letter for
letter, of *Le Torcey*, though the commoner spelling is without the
second *e*, *Le Torcy*. If we are to reckon this as being a chance
coincidence, my only further comment will be, that such chance as this
is quite as miraculous as any miracle in the world could be.

As regards the words "*nepveu du sang*," there was a caricature very
popular in France at the time of the candidature for the French
presidency, consisting of two pictures. In one the Prince de Joinville
was commending himself to the French people for election, having the
young Comte de Paris by the hand, and saying, "I am the uncle of my
nephew." On the other side Louis Napoleon presses his suit by pointing
to a statuette of Napoleon Bonaparte and uttering the words, "I am the
nephew of my uncle;" showing how characteristically *nepveu du sang*
designates Prince Louis Napoleon. He may almost be said to have chosen
it himself as a cognomen.

Century VIII.--*Quatrain* 44. \[I. 267.\]

Le procrée naturel d'Ogmion <span id="fr_431"></span>[1](#fn_430)  
De sept à neuf du chemin destorner:  
A roy de longue amy et <span id="fr_432"></span>[2](#fn_431) au my
hom <span id="fr_433"></span>[3](#fn_432)  
Doit à Navarre fort de Pau prosterner.

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

I propose here to make the meaning as clear as I can without a
translation.

Napoleon III. (*le procrée*), the natural offspring of the French
Republic (*Ogmion*), will turn from the right road for seven or nine
years before his fall. Le Pelletier interprets otherwise. He says that
the war in Italy began in the seventh year of the Empire, 1869, and from
that date throughout the nine following years he changed his policy. I
think the line means that from seven to nine years before the end of his
reign he changed his policy. That is to say, from seven years previous
to the close of his reign, when Charles August Louis, Duc de Morny,
died, *i.e.* in 1865; and even for two years previously to that, things
took a different turn. De Morny no longer exercised active control, and
his was the head that had guided I all along. When he died, all ran to
destruction. The *roi de longue* and his friend *my hom*, Le Pelletier
states to be Victor Emmanuel and Garibaldi; one of long race and one of
low birth, the tallow-smelter. I think it is Frederic William, *de
longue vie*, and Bismarck, the *bi-valve* man, which it becomes, if we
read it as *my-homme*. I have a great idea that *à Navarre* is a
misprint for *le nepveu*. Whether *fort de Pau* may mean with his health
re-established by staying at Pau or not, I cannot say. But, anyhow, I
think that the two last lines are to be read together, and that he is to
prostrate himself to the King and his friend. Louis Napoleon's whole
reign must be represented as a failure, if you read it with Le
Pelletier; mine makes it a failure during the last seven to nine years.
My King and friend bring about the catastrophe far below the date that
his will do. My emendation to *le nepveu* certainly clarifies the
meaning. The explanation of Pau is not quite so comprehensible as I
could wish; had *Ham* been a variant it would have spoken for itself.

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

The Quatrain 53 of Century VIII., which I have already explained as the
flotilla of Napoleon Bonaparte, M. le Pelletier fixes as the ludicrous
Boulogne expedition of Louis Napoleon, and the Italian campaign after he
became Emperor; but I think he entirely fails in reading the symbols.

Century V.--*Quatrain* 8. \[I. 270.\]

Sera laissé feu vif, mort caché,  
Dedans les globes, horrible espouvantable,  
De nuict a classe <span id="fr_434"></span>[1](#fn_433) cité en poudre
lasché,  
La cité à feu, l'ennemy favourable.

Translation.

Live fire, hidden death, shall be left  
In bombs, a horrible and frightful thing:  
By a band at night the city shall be fired with powder;  
The city seems on fire, it helps though intended to destroy.

Fulminating mercury (*feu vif*) in bombs in terrible explosion contains
death hidden. The city, Paris, will be startled with powder liberated
(*lasché*, loosed) by assassins by night. The city will seem on fire.
But the enemy (in spite of himself) will prove favourable to Napoleon.
This, of course, is Orsini's attempt of January 14, 1858.

The next verse follows up the thread.

Century V.--*Quatrain* 9. \[I. 271.\]

Jusques au fond la grand arq <span id="fr_435"></span>[2](#fn_434)
demolue <span id="fr_436"></span>[3](#fn_435)  
Par chef captif l'amy anticipé, <span id="fr_437"></span>[4](#fn_436)  
Naistra de dame front, face chevelue,  
Lors par astuce duc <span id="fr_438"></span>[5](#fn_437) mort atrapé.

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

Translation.

When the peristyle is thoroughly demolished  
By the chief prisoner, the friend being taken before,  
A plot born of the woman, long beard and hairy face;  
Then by cunning the leader caught will be executed.

The peristyle (*la grand arq'*) of the opera shall be completely
shattered. Pieri, the friend of Orsini, the chief captive, is seized
beforehand by Hébert, head of the detective service, who recognized him
in the crowd. The plot was conceived in the secret lodges of the
Demagoguy \[*de Dame*\], whose members wear the beard and hair long.
Orsini, the leader of the whole, will be surprised astutely by the
confessions of Gomez at the restaurant Broggi, whither he had fled, and,
being taken, will be sentenced to death.

I do not feel very confident as to this interpretation, but give it much
as I find it in M. le Pelletier.

Century V.--Quatrain 10. \[I. 272.\]

Un <span id="fr_439"></span>[1](#fn_438) chef Celtique dans le conflict
blessé,  
Auprès de cave <span id="fr_440"></span>[2](#fn_439) voyant siens mort
abbatre,  
De sang et playes et d'ennemis pressé,  
Et secours par incogneus <span id="fr_441"></span>[3](#fn_440) de
quatre.

Translation.

The Celtic chief is wounded in the strife,  
Seeing death strike down his friends near the theatre,  
Surrounded with blood and wounds and pressed by enemies,  
He escapes the four <span id="fr_442"></span>[4](#fn_441) assassins, by
unknown aid.

The Emperor, slightly struck in the eye by a fragment of glass, shall
see his people strewn in death about the entrance of the Grand Opera.
Pressed by the conspirators, four in number, he will receive unknown
help; whether of

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

angels or pure spirits, M. le Pelletier cannot quite say. We now know
that he had still to see Sedan; but it would be curious if pure spirits
had interested themselves greatly to protect the cold-blooded murderer
of the Champs de Mars. and Coup d'État.

Century VI.--*Quatrain* 4. \[I. 273.\]

Le second chef du regne D'annemarc, <span
id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_442)  
Par ceux de Frize <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_443) et l'Isle
Britannique,  
Fera despendre <span id="fr_445"></span>[3](#fn_444) plus de cent mille
marc, <span id="fr_446"></span>[4](#fn_445)  
Vain exploicter voyage en Italique.

The second of the Napoleonic race in power will cause England and
Hanover to expend 100,000 marks in fortifications and war material.
Fearing invasion after the Orsini effort, he will then exploit the
Italian campaign, though vainly, as he will not reap the results he
looks for.

This corresponds so clearly with what happened that probably most will
agree that it is a very remarkable forecast.

Century III.--*Quatrain* 37. \[I. 274.\]

Avant l'assaut l'oraison <span id="fr_447"></span>[5](#fn_446)
prononcée,  
Milan prins <span id="fr_448"></span>[6](#fn_447) d'Aigle par embusches
deceus, <span id="fr_449"></span>[7](#fn_448)  
Muraille antique par canons enfoncée,  
Par feu et sang à mercy pen receus.

Translation.

Before assault a harangue is pronounced;  
Lombardy is taken by the eagle, being cut off by ambuscade.  
An ancient wall driven in by cannon,  
Fire and blood, but little mercy shown.

 

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

Before the declaration of war, the Emperor will pronounce (January 1,
1859), in the presence of the diplomatic corps, a threatening discourse
against Austria. Lombardy (Milan, part for the whole) will be ceded by
Austria at the Treaty of Zurich (October 17, 1859); Austria, an old
wall, will yield to cannon, fire, and blood.

Century V.--*Quatrain* 20. \[I. 275.\]

De là <span id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_449) les Alpes grande armée
passera  
Un peu devant naistra monstre vapin, <span
id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_450)

id="fr_453"></span>[4](#fn_452)  
Le grand Tosquan à son lieu plus propin. <span
id="fr_454"></span>[5](#fn_453)

Translation.

A great army will pass beyond the Alps,  
A little before a prodigious scamp will come to power;  
He will drive the grand Duke of Tuscany  
To his nearer home with astounding suddenness.

In 1859 Napoleon III.'s army will pass the Alps. A little before a
prominent scamp will have come to the front, who will suddenly and in a
most startling fashion drive the Grand Duke of Tuscany to seek refuge in
Austria (*son lieu le plus propin*).

We have to note here that Nostradamus, whenever he emerges from the
impassibility of the *secret estude*, it is to exhibit a profound
hostility to the genius of Democracy and Revolution. There is therefore
little doubt but that the powerful epithet here employed of the *monstre
vapin* relates to the red-shirted Garibaldi.

We have now reached the point which covers the last of the Oracles of
Nostradamus that commentary has yet been

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

able to lay before the world with its meaning rendered transparent by
the correspondence of interpretation with an event in history. The
number of such correlations of occurrence with forecast falls immensely
short of the number of the quatrains themselves. In fact, only about one
hundred and fifty-one, out of a thousand. The rest give no scintillation
as yet, but lie without sign of existence traceable, dead as a flint,
till the iron stroke of Time's heel shall develop the spark. *Lateat
scintillula forsan.* One or two Presages and two or three Sixains have
been also resolved, Enough, we trust, has been opened up to show what a
treasure-house it is that we have entered into, how rich in curiosity,
if in nothing more. What may still lie perdu in the bulky remainder of
eight hundred and fifty it is impossible to say; whether, though
unidentified, they have been realized already, or are yet to bud in the
future. If nothing more be ever done with Nostradamus than this book
gives, still the work must for one reason or other hereafter stand out
as the most wonderful book of its kind that was ever written or printed
in this world. It has now to go forth and take its chance, good or evil,
of notice or of neglect amongst the mass of printed matter, largely
rubbish, that deluges our life. It is certainly calculated, so far as it
can secure any attention whatever, to severely shock the prejudices now
prevalent amongst mankind. The half-educated will find it troublesome to
read, and disturbing, perhaps, to think about; whilst the scientific may
even denounce it as a locust-cloud of darkness mediæval in its tendency.
Undoubtedly it must have the effect that Nostradamus in his preface to
his son (see [p. 45](oon06.htm#page_45)) says very graphically it will
have, "que possible fera retirer le front à quelques uns." Although, as
he says again, the forecasts may be

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

clouded, they will be understood by men of sense, and they will grow
clearer as ignorance dies out (see [p. 49](oon06.htm#page_49)); which
should be our care now.

To all objectors I rejoin, gentlemen, investigate, please, all the
points in question as searchingly as you can; find every fault in my
work, and in that of the other Nostradamic commentators, that you can;
expose all that is weak or illusive, wherever you find it to be so. Let
us see, then, how far all the learning and acuteness you can bring to
bear, coupled with whatever established prejudice, and its rancour at
being disturbed in comfortable somnolency, can suggest, to overthrow
what other men heretofore, and I now, have taken so much pains to bring
together and give shape to. Consciously I have not set down a single
word with any other desire than that the truth should prevail; and if
your criticism can establish the opposite, I shall still repeat, "Let
truth prevail." But I do not think you can do this: and if not, there is
only one other thing, open to the learned and the wise that can be
done,--that is, to rewrite their philosophies, so as to make room for
the reception of this rather awkward piece of truth that has here got in
the way of our old theories, and cannot be got out of the way again. To
the really competent and candid reader I have nothing whatever to add
beyond begging him to refer back to the closing words of my preface, as
to him they will he found to contain my whole and entire message.

his elder brother, had, with one cannon served by himself and a few
Italian partisans, possessed himself of *Civita-Castellana*, in the
Pontifical States.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[295:1](oon21.htm#fr_426) Latin, *decidium*, a

<span id="fn_428"></span>[295:4](oon21.htm#fr_429) *Lectoyre*, a town in
France, in the department of Gers. Garencières adopts the variant
Lectoure, which he says is a town in Gascony. The word occurs again,
Century VII. 12, and there he says it is a city of Guyenne. *Lectora*
was the Latin name. It was a place of great strength, and picturesque;
but, unless we can find it to be an anagram, there is nothing to connect
the town in any way with the fortunes of Louis Napoleon.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[296:1](oon21.htm#fr_430) The word *pliera*, is
of course, only an archaic transposition of *pleira*. The line here can
in no way be made to scan, being two syllables or one whole foot short.
I would suggest it be read Nepveu (du sang) par peur pleira l'enseigne.

the King of Prussia; and *my-hom* I take to be the bivalve-man, or
Bismarck.

night.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[299:2](oon21.htm#fr_435) Latin, *arca*, chest,

<span id="fn_445"></span>[301:4](oon21.htm#fr_446) M. le Pelletier
calculates that the golden mark was equal to 250 grammes, or 100,000
