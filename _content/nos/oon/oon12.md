# Louis XIV

(1643-1715.)

COMMENCEMENT OF HIS PERSONAL REIGN (MARCH 10, 1661). \[I. 118.\]

Quatrain added to the Xth Century. <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151)

Quand le fourchu sera soustenu de deux paux, <span
id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152)  
Avec six demy-corps <span id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153) et six sizeaux
ouverts,  
Le très puissant Seigneur, heritier des crapaux,  
Alors subjugera sous soy tout l'univers.

Translation.

When a fork sustained by two stakes (*i.e.* V, *fourchu*, sustained by
two stakes upright, II. = M, a thousand,) and six half horns and six
scissors open (CCCCCC, XXXXXX). (Half horn is the *cor de chasse*, or
French horn cut in half, like a C, making altogether 1600).

The very mighty King, inheritor of the toads, shall subjugate to his
power the whole universe.

THESE TWO first lines are clumsily employed in giving the date, but
still were in print fifty-five years before the date named.

Mazarin died on March 9, 1661. The following day Louis XIV. became full
inheritor of the lilies, took the reins of government, and subjected
everything to his will.

Upon this Le Pelletier remarks that the toads, as emblematic of France,
were standards borne under the early kings of the Merovingian race. The
*fleurs-de-lys* were of later introduction, under Clovis, son of
Childeric I., the founder of the Christian monarchy of the Franks.

TREATY OF WESTPHALIA, ETC. (1648-1661). \[I. 119.\]

Century X.--*Quatrain* 7.

Le grand conflit qu'on appreste à Nancy;  
L'Æmathien <span id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154) dira, tout je
soubmets;  
L'isle Britanne par <span id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_155) vin sel en
soucy;  
Hem-mi <span id="fr_156"></span>[3](#fn_156) deux Phi <span
id="fr_157"></span>[4](#fn_157) longtemps ne tiendra Metz.

Translation.

A great conflict will approach Nancy;  
The Æmathion will say, I submit all to me;  
The isle of Britain will be agitated for lack of force and wisdom;  
Metz will not hold out long against the two Philips.

Nancy was taken in 1660 by the French, when they razed the
fortifications and united it with France. It appears to me that the
first two lines of this quatrain should have formed the last two, but
how any such error as that could have crept in is quite inexplicable.
The reader will discern that a difference of about twelve years exists
between the dates involved in the two distichs, that, as they are given,
they are contrary to chronology, and that for such disarrangement

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

no reason is assignable. If this is the way in which visions presented
themselves to our seer, there is no reason to suppose, as I do, that he
shook up the separate quatrains purposely to destroy a sequence that
would have rendered them too easy of interpretation. It might have been
a printer's error.

We have already seen what is the classical meaning to be attributed to
Æmathion--that it relates to the sun and to Alexander the Great. In
Nostradamus it refers to Louis XIV. (*Louis le Grand*). Of him it is to
be remembered that he assumed as his emblem and that of France, the sun,
with the motto *Nec pluribus impar*. Now, the sun, in the language of
alchemists, stands for gold, and, in the metaphorical language of the
Church, for Christianity. Gold is all the Christianity that many
Christians possess. *Les Solaires*, in Nostradamus, is used for
Christians. It is especially connected with France, inasmuch as her King
is held at Rome, that centre of titles and of prelatical humility, to be
*Christianissimus*. But this stout Capetian glorious King meant it of
sovereignty. It was to signify, as Nostradamus has it, *tout le
soubmets*. What is this man's own choice of a posy, to be cut around his
signet? *Nec pluribus impar*. What is the axiom his blind self-pride
invents when the death of Mazarin emancipates him from tutelage, and he
grips the reins of France in his sole left hand (in 1661)? *L'État,
c'est Moi*. Can insolence rise higher? Wait an odd century or so and see
a scaffold spring before your Tuilleries windows, see an Æmathion, but
twice removed in blood, roll his head, red, gushing, spurting, and
bounding on the sawdust-sprinkled planks there; its motto, could it
speak, would be your axiom recast fatally, *L'État du Capet*! (*Caput*!)

We have not quite concluded yet. When the treaty of Westphalia shall be
agreed to between France and Philip

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> IV. of Spain in
1648, and before the war of Succession to, seat Philip V., grandson of
Louis XIV., on the throne, Metz shall be ceded to France, and lose for
ever its title of Imperial City, between the two Philips--Philip IV.
and, Philip V., *protégé* of France.

England about the same time, in revolution kindled by that imp of
malevolence, Richelieu, shall behead its king, 1649, and be in anxiety
because of the want of force and wisdom (*vin et sel*). This symbol Le
Pelletier interprets thus: Wine is the symbol of force, because of its
*heat*; and salt, because of its incorruptibility, is the symbol of
wisdom.. I think it clear that this is not to be the interpretation
here. He does not allude to *want* of force and wisdom; but anxiety
(*soucy*) is caused by force and wisdom (*à l'envers*, as he puts again
in reference to England, Century IX. 49; vol. i. 140 applied in the
wrong direction.

This, though a highly unsatisfactory quatrain, as I have: shown above,
is, nevertheless, one of the most remarkable of the whole series. The
time of the Westphalian treaty synchronises with the revolt in
England--a revolt which we have seen to be fostered out of mere pique by
the vulpine Richelieu; a Churchman plotting royal murder, taught by
Rome's consent that regicide was God's service, when a king (Henri III.)
stood in her way; and when the Church once corrupted herself, baptizing
her St. Bartholomew whose emblem was a knife, in blood, she absolved
Paris, \[*cité au glaive*, i. 182\] who in midsummer madness stained her
kennels red. The example of Whitehall--in re-enactment before the
Tuilleries (*vin et sel a l'envers*), with force and wisdom converted
into violence and democratic sensibility,--next turned Paris rouge, and
the blood carnation burst into bloom at every street corner.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

"When nations are to perish in their sins,  
'Tis in the Church the leprosy begins;"

says the wise, mild, thoughtful, but much underrated bard, Cowper, who
has done Gilpin inimitably, and Homer better than anybody else, by a
long way.

LOSS OF DE LA FERRIÈRE'S SQUADRON (1655). \[I. 121.\]

Century III.--*Quatrain* 87.

Classe <span id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_158) Gauloise n'approche de
Corsegue, <span id="fr_159"></span>[2](#fn_159)  
Moins de Sardaigne, tu t'en repentiras;  
Trestous mourrez frustrès de l'aide grogne;  
Sang nagera, captif ne me croiras.

Translation.

Approach not Corsica, thou fleet of France,  
Nor yet Sardinia, lest thou rue the chance:  
For ye no headland aids, ye all shall die,  
The captive drown, for unbelieved am I.

M. le Pelletier tells us of a French squadron, commanded by the
Chevalier de la Ferrière in 1655, that foundered in the Gulf of Lyons in
coasting Corsica and Sardinia. All hands perished: they did not, he
says, pass Cape Pourceau. He points out that *Grogne* is the synonym of
Pourceau, which is a cape with a little port in the Mediterranean. This
may have more to support it than appears at first sight, but I think it
much simpler to take it for what it says. *Grogne* is the same as
*Groin*, cape, or headland which runs out into the sea. In other words:
nothing will put off to you from the headland where you founder; there
will you all be drowned; for what the better will your master pilot be
for this advertisement of mine? Jean de Rian was this master pilot, and
*Le Captif* was his nickname, as he had been a slave.

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

Though perfectly useless for interpretation, Garencières makes
annotations on this quatrain, that have an interest of their own. He
takes the fulfilment to have been in 1555, just about the time when the
quatrains were copied out for presentation to Henri II. But he remarks
that *Greigne*, which is the word in his reading, signifies *galley* in
the Provençal language, which was that of Nostradamus by his mother's
side; and this makes very good sense: "they shall all founder without a
galley putting out to them from the shore."

Of course Garencières knows nothing about Jean de Rian, or the curious
precision with which Nostradamus gives us his nickname *Captif*; but he
appends to his "Poor prisoner, thou shalt not believe me" the following
comment that is worth recording, as it may furnish a link to some
inquiry in the future:

"We find in this work many examples of those who went to consult with
the author concerning the success of their undertakings, as did the Earl
of *Sommerive*, before the besieging of Bagnole; to whom he answered,
that he should leave the trees loaded with a new kind of fruit, that is
to say, the rebels, whom he caused to be hanged on the trees."

FORTIFICATIONS OF VAUBAN AND THE CANAL OF LANGUENDOC  
(1659-1666). \[I. 122.\]

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 93.

Les ennemies du fort bien esloignés,  
Par chariots conduict le bastion,  
Par sur les murs de Bourges esgrongnés, <span
id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160)  
Quand Hercules bastira l'Hæmathion. <span
id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_161)

Translation.

When the enemy are driven from French soil,  
And earthworks or bastions are brought by carts;  
When the walls of Bourges have crumbled by time,  
Then will Æmathion undertake a work of Hercules.

 

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

When the peace of the Pyrenees, concluded with Spain in 1659, had
removed the enemy from the French frontiers, and Vauban had invented
earthworks: at least so says Le Pelletier; Nostradamus only says he used
them. Moreri tells us that the castle of Grosse Tour at Bourges was not
repaired by Louis XIV., and was already partly ruined in 1651. This line
seems to be a whimsical, but special announcement of the fact. Then
Æmathion, or Louis XIV., will undertake the Herculean labour of
constructing the Canal of Languedoc, which opened the Mediterranean to
the ocean. It was begun by Paul Riquet in 1666, and terminated in 1681.
It cost thirty-four million francs. It is said that when Vauban visited
it he gave some useful hints that were acted upon with advantage.
Vauban, like Turenne, was a glory, not to France, but to mankind. He was
truly great, for he despised riches, and loved truth to indiscretion;
yet his life shows that in judgment he much excelled those who loved
truth less.

PEACE OF THE PYRENEES (NOVEMBER 7, 1659). \[I. 123.\]

Century X.--*Quatrain* 58.

An temps du dueil clue le felin <span id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_162)
monarque,  
Guerroyera le jeune Æmathien:  
Gaule bransler, perecliter la barque, <span
id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_163)  
Tenter <span id="fr_164"></span>[3](#fn_164) Phossen, <span
id="fr_165"></span>[4](#fn_165) an Ponant <span
id="fr_166"></span>[5](#fn_166) entretien.

Translation.

When the court of France shall be in mourning, the cat-like monarch
shall make war against the young Æmathien. France will stagger; the bark
of St. Peter be in danger. Marseilles will be taken. Two great
personages will meet in the West of France.

 

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

More at large this may be read, that at the death of Louis XIII., when
the French Court is in mourning, shrewd Philip IV. of Spain will make
war on the boy King. France will be greatly shaken (1648-1653) by the
civil war of the Fronde, whilst Rome will be endangered by the growth of
Jansenism. This is Le Pelletier's version. Garencières says that Paris
is signified, as she carries a ship represented in her arms. The 2nd of
March, 1660, Louis XIV. enters Phocea or Marseilles by a breach, after
which it submits to him. He then hurries to the west of the Isle of
Conference on the Bidassoa, and there concludes the peace of the
Pyrenees with Philip IV., and marries his daughter, the infanta Maria
Theresa, of Austria.

THE EXPEDITION TO IRELAND IN SUPPORT OF JAMES II. (1689-1691). \[I.
125.\]

Century II.--*Quatrain* 68.

De l'Aquilon les efforts seront grands,  
Sur l'Ocean sera la porte ouverte,  
Le regne en l'Isle sera reintegrand,  
Tremblera Londres par <span id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_167)
voilles <span id="fr_168"></span>[2](#fn_168) descouverte.

Translation.

Ireland, on the north of England, shall make great efforts. The door of
the ocean shall be opened to the fleets of France; the kingdom in the
island of Ireland shall be set up again; London shall tremble at the
discovery of sails.

When William III., in 1688, shall have established himself on the
throne, when James II. absconded; Ireland will still be a stronghold,
and the French fleets, commanded by Chateau Renaud and Tourville, will
convoy the King to Ireland, in spite of the combined fleets of England
and Holland, in 1689-1690. They will become masters of the sea, and
London will for a moment tremble before the

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

fleets of Louis XIV. This is Le Pelletier's statement. After the fight
off Beachy Head on June 30, 1690, it seems to have been pretty much as
he relates; for Smollett's account (ed. 1822, i. 93) is that;

"Torrington retreated without further interruption into the mouth of the
Thames; and, having taken precautions against any attempts of the enemy
in that quarter, returned to London, the inhabitants of which were
overwhelmed with consternation."

There is a most remarkable passage in the work of M. Bouys on this
quatrain. He professes to apply it to the coming victory that was to
confer on Napoleon the coveted command of the seas, saying that you need
not always wait until after the event to interpret Nostradamus. His own
conduct, however, in this very instance does but enforce the rule. He
pretends not to know anything of the fulfilment in 1689-1690. In
furtherance of the same view he cites Century VIII., Quatrain 37:

La forteresse auprès de la Thamise  
Cherra pour lors le roi dedans serré,  
Auprès du pont sera vu en chemise,  
Un devant mort, puis dans le fort barré.

The word *cherra* presents the only difficulty here as to the mere
words. It is the future of the verb *choir*, tomber, to fall. Of the
prophecy I know of no interpretation. Garencières significantly quotes
Dan. iv. 10: "The dream be to them that hate thee, and the
interpretation thereof to thine enemies."

WAR OF THE CAMISARDS (1702-1704). \[I. 126.\]

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 38.

L'entrée de Blaye par Rochelle et l'Anglois,  
Passera outre le grand Æmathien:  
Non loin d'Agen attendra le Gaulois,  
Secours Narbonne deceu par entretien.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

Translation.

The great Æmathion shall pass out of the Garonne at Blaye, the seaport
of Bordeaux, no longer impeded by Rochelle and the English; the
Camisards shall look for aid from their co-religionists on the side of
Agen and Narbonne, but will be disappointed by an arrangement.

Louis XIV. shall pass out by the *Pâté* de Blaye, a fort of that name,
built by him in 1689 to command the entrance of the Gironde against the
English and the Protestants of Rochelle. The Camisards in revolt in the
Cévennes (*les Gaulois*) will wait at Agens and Narbonne for promised
help, but quite in vain, after the submission of Jean Cavalier (1704) to
Marshal Villars, at a Conference held at Nîmes. Louis XIV. was so beset
by the enemies of France that he sent the Marshal into Languedoc to
pacify the districts he despaired of subduing by force.

In this quatrain, Garencières shows that there is some analogy between
*Æmathien*, which we are quite sure is Louis XIV. from the frequency of
the application to him. and the country of Macedon, so-called, where
Cæsar and Pompey fought their last battle in the field of Pharsalia; and
he quotes Lucan's line--

Bella per Æmathios plus quam civilia campos.

It is very probable that line was in the mind of Nostradamus at the
moment.

WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION (1701-1713). \[I. 127.\]

Century IV.--*Quatrain* 2.

Par mort la France prendra voyage à faire,  
Classe <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169) par mer, marcher Incurs
Pyrenées,  
Espaigne en trouble, marcher gent militaire;  
Des plus grands Dames en France emmenées.

Translation.

By reason of a death, France shall, undertake a foreign expedition. The
<span id="page_142">p. 142</span> fleet will go by sea, the troops will
cross the Pyrenees. Spain in trouble will march her military forces,
because great ladies have migrated to France.

Philip V., grandson of Louis le Grand, by will of Charles II., will
ascend the Spanish throne. But Austria, England, Holland, Prussia,
Portugal, and Savoy will coalesce to support the pretensions of the
Archduke Charles. The fleets of France will put to sea, her armies will
cross the Pyrenees. Spain, in two camps, will be trampled by troops in
every direction: all springing out of Bourbon marriages with the two
Infantas; one, daughter of Philip III. married to Louis XIII., the
other, a daughter of Philip IV., married to Louis XIV. This war lasted
twelve years, and was disastrous to France. Philip V. found himself
chased from Spain by the Austrians. By the Peace of Utrecht, 1713, the
Spanish monarchy was dismembered, and some of his earlier conquests were
snatched from Louis XIV.

OVERTHROW OF PHILIP V., *grandson of Louis XIV*. (1706). \[I. 129.\]

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 64.

L'Æmathion passer monts Pyrenées,  
En Mars Narbon <span id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170) ne fera
resistance,  
Par mer terre fera si <span id="fr_171"></span>[2](#fn_171) grand
menée,  
Cap <span id="fr_172"></span>[3](#fn_172) n'ayant terre seure pour
demeurance.

Translation.

The Æmathion is to pass the Pyrenean Mount;  
In Narbo Martius no resistance shows;  
By sea and land are greatest efforts made;  
The Capet holds no foot of land is safe.

Louis XIV. will leap the Pyrenees, and will treat (as we have before
seen) with the Camisards of Narbonne. He

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

will make desperate efforts by sea and land. But the Capetian, his
grandson, Philip V., will be driven out of Spain by the Imperial forces,
and not retain a foot of soil on which to live.

In all these passages of history, quite detached as they seem to be, we
find analogies springing up at all points: Æmathion the Macedonian, and
Louis le Grand; the Spanish succession which came up again in Louis
Philippe's time, even to uniting the very two names of Louis XIV. and
his grandson Philip V. in his own baptismal one. Louis wished to expel a
Charles, and Louis Philippe actually expelled Charles X. Leibnitz made
an express journey to Paris to persuade Louis XIV. to undertake a grand
expedition against Egypt. Napoleon, the next Æmathion or Apollon leading
France to mischief, was thrust into an Egyptian expedition, and entered
into a desperate Spanish war to follow, that crippled France again.
History repeats itself, they say. It seems at every turn to be
perpetually engaged in a process of replaiting its old lines and
once-discarded threads.

Emathion, Le Pelletier says, son of Cephalus and Aurora, who opened the
gates of the morning to the sun. I do not find this account of him
anywhere. Cephalus is the chaste Joseph of mythology, tempted by Aurora.
But Hesiod makes him father of Phaeton by her. Possibly M. le Pelletier
has mistaken Emathion for Phaeton. Generally. Emathion is reckoned as
son of Titan and Aurora, and a King of Macedonia. His connection in some
way however with the sun is certain, and this suffices for the use made
of his name by Nostradamus. Ἠμαθιων is given by Suidas as a proper name.
Now, Ἠμάθιος is *daily*, with but the change of one letter. Further than
this Ἠμάθιος is Macedonian, and Alexander is called *Emathius dux*, as
in Milton, "the Emathian conqueror bid spare;" implying that Louis le
Grand should be a counterpart to Alexander the Great, an impostor who
also pretended birth from Apollo. By which flight of ambition he
bastardized himself by choice, dishonoured his mother, and put his
father outside the door. Shakespeare says, "By this sin fell the
angels;" but a too prosperous fool seems equally ready to annihilate
himself by it, and all belonging to him, of his own act.
