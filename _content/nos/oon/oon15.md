# French Revolution

THE VULGAR ADVENT. \[I. 160.\]

Century VI.--*Quatrain* 74.

La. dechassée <span id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_216) an regne tournera,  
Ses ennemies trouvés des conjurés:  
Plus que jamais son temps triomphera,  
Trois et septante à mort trop asseurés.

Translation.

She who was proscribed will return to the kingdom,  
Her enemies will be treated as conspirators;  
More than ever her time (or empire) will triumph;  
Seventy-three years its deathly domination is assured.

THE Revolution (*la dechassée*), repressed in 1816, shall again obtain
the government. Its enemies will be treated as conspirators, and it will
be stronger than ever. Seventy-three years are assured to its death-like
rule. I give this as M. le Pelletier does, but I see no reason whatever
to think that it is correct. Garencières makes it apply to Charles II.
of England, and the seventy-three put to death are those who abetted the
murder of his father. This is very vague. Garencières reads *Le
dechassé*. Here we may remark that Napoleon himself \[p. 280\] dates his
nobility from the battle of Montenotte, 1797, Seventy-three years added
to this yields us the remarkable date of the fall of his dynasty at
Sedan, 1870,

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

Century I.--*Quatrain* 3. (*September* 22, 1792.) \[I. 162.\]

Quand la lictiere du tourbillion versée, <span
id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_217)  
Et seront faces de leurs manteaux <span id="fr_219"></span>[2](#fn_218)
couvers,  
La republique par gens nouveaux vexée, <span
id="fr_220"></span>[3](#fn_219)  
Lors blancs et rouges jugeront à l'envers.

Translation.

When the litter is turned topsy-turvey by the typhoon,  
Men will mask their faces with the cloak of hypocrisy.  
The republic will be troubled by new-risen men;  
The white and red will judge by contraries.

This means that the royalists (*les blancs*) and the republicans (*les
rouges*) will judge of everything from utterly opposed points of view.
What was top will become bottom, when the blast blows the litter over;
and, new men rising to power, the rest will cover their faces with
hypocrisy, as men do with their cloaks in a storm. Compare the phrase *à
l'envers* with [p. 154](oon14.htm#page_154).

Century II.--Quatrain 30. \[I. 163.\]

Un qui les dieux d'Annibal infernaux  
Fera renaistre, effrayeur des humains.  
Oncq' <span id="fr_221"></span>[4](#fn_220) plus d'horreur ne <span
id="fr_222"></span>[5](#fn_221) plus pire journaux  
Qu'avint viendra par Babel aux Romains. <span
id="fr_223"></span>[6](#fn_222)

 

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

Translation.

There will be one who will revive the infernal gods  
Of Hannibal, a terror to mankind.  
Never arrived by Babel note horror  
Nor worse day's work than will fall upon Roman Catholics.

The meaning is, Napoleon shall arise, who will reawaken the solemn curse
on Rome uttered by Hannibal, when he called the infernal gods to witness
his hatred to her, to the terror of all mortals. Not Babel at the
dispersion brought on the world more horror, nor days of more
evil-ploughing for the present or seed-sowing for the future than shall
fall upon the Roman world by him. This is much better than to limit it
to an ecclesiastical area merely. We shall see that Charles V. is a sort
of prototype of Napoleon, and Garencières adduces Charles V. as
fulfilling this prophecy. Hannibal is also a prototype of Napoleon in
attacking Italy by crossing the Alps.

Century I.--*Quatrain* 14. (1789-1793.) \[I. 164.\]

De gent esclave chansons, chants et requestes  
Captifs par <span id="fr_224"></span>[1](#fn_223) Princes et Seigneur
aux prisons,  
A l'advenir par idiots sans testes  
Seront receus par <span id="fr_225"></span>[2](#fn_224) divines
oraisons.

Translation.

Songs, chants, and refrains of the slavish mob,  
Whilst the Princes and King are captive in prison,  
Shall be received in the future as oracles divine  
By headless idiots deprived of judgment.

Songs--such as the Marseillaise while the King and Princes are
imprisoned in the Temple,--songs of the mob (*gent esclave*) are
received by brainless fools for divine utterances, even prayers
(*divines oraisons*). *Vox populi, vox Dei*, is always the fools'
blasphemous formula, when swine

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

chose Barabbas for Pontifex or Generalissimo. A cruelly entreated
people; whose burdens are aggravated by wickedness in high places
needlessly, above and beyond the grief, which every man is born to by
the act of birth into a world of sickness, sorrow, and injustice; sighs
heavily at this unduly heaped-up burden, and that sigh, that *vox
populi*, runs upward like a lightning conductor to elicit fire from the
clouds, coming back charged with electricity and thunder,--a *vox Dei*
of terrible divinity. But when scum rises to the direction, as with the
Revolutionists, and is followed by some brutalized *sabreur*
aggrandizing himself as king of chaos and disorder, with shouts of
subservient applause from the smutty mob, saying, "Herod, thou art a
god," the *vox populi* that split the welkin once, is now the *vox
infernorum demonum*, the whole upspring and outcome of which is
bestiality and lawlessness enthroned in defiance of the decalogue and
heaven. Thenceforth the appeal of all good men and sane is, "Ye who
worship God, good and alone from eternity, down with them." The men must
work and serve. This fiat is in the air, is in the sea, is on the earth.
It is the *vox naturæ*, in comparison with which the people's voice,
*vox populi*, is nothing, beyond a momentary troubling of the silences.

The following quatrain I give for what it may be thought worth. M. le
Pelletier thinks it to relate to the creation of assignats, December 19,
1789. It would be a pity to lose sight of his identification, if even
some should presume it to be incorrect.

Century I.--*Quatrain* 53. (December 19, 1789.) \[I. 165.\]

Las! qu'on verra grand peuple tourmenté,  
Et la loi saincte en totale ruine;  
Par autres loix route la Chrestienté;  
Quand d'or d'argent trouvé nouvelle mine.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

Translation.

Alas! how great a people shall tormented be,  
And holy law in utter ruin laid:  
By newer laws all Christendom is vexed,  
With a new mine of gold and silver found.

We shall see, alas! the French people (*grand peuple*) agitated, the
Catholic religion (*la loy saincte*) totally ruined, all Christendom put
under new laws, when the National Assembly decrees that four hundred
million assignats shall .be issued (*nouvelle mine d'or*, etc.), secured
on the property of the clergy, in the interests of the Revolution.

Older commentators applied this to the paper-money schemes of Law 1716;
and Garencières finds the fulfilment in the discovery of the
Spanish-American gold and silver mines.

A properly regulated paper-money issue, based on the taxation of a
State, having absolutely no intrinsic value whatever in itself, could
undoubtedly be converted into a circulating medium that would work more
smoothly than any metallic one can, because the market value of the ore,
employed as now in coinage, is perpetually introducing a fluctuation of
values that conflicts with the nominal standard of the coin, so that the
standard is never uniform. The currency required would never amount to a
tenth part of the taxation leviable. Paper could therefore be destroyed
at the Bank of England, or issued exactly according to the needs of
trade and commerce. Fluctuation in the market value of metals would no
longer affect the circulating medium in the least. Thus might one cause
of recurrent panics be removed for ever. But can bank directors or
ministers be trusted with such a responsibility? This hinges on honesty,
and there is none to spare.

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

Century VII.--*Quatrain* 14. (1789-1793.) \[I. 166.\]

Faux exposer viendra topographie,  
Seront les cruches <span id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_225) des monumens
ouvertes,  
Pulluler secte, sancte philosophie,  
Pour blanches noires, et pour antiques vertes.

Translation.

Topography will soon be falsified,  
The urns and sepulchres stand violate,  
Sects swarm, and babbling sentiment  
Black put for white, and green fruit for the ripe.

The curse be on them for changing old landmarks. The provinces turned
into departments (by decree of the Assembly, December 22, 1789). The
sepulture of Kings violated at St. Denis. Unholy sects will swarm, and a
sentimental philosophy, of Rousseau and other maddened sophists,
usurping the office of religion, black will stand for white, and green,
crude fruit be substituted for the ripe.

Century IV.--*Quatrain* 24.

Ouy soubs Terre Sainte Dame <span id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_226) voix
feinte,  
Humaine flamme pour Divine voit luire:  
Fera des sœurs de leur sang terre tainte,  
Et les saints temples par les impures destruire.

Translation.

Hear from the ground a voice of Halidom,  
A human flame pretending light divine.  
The blood of sisters stains the earth to red,  
And holy temples the impure destroy.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

This, I think, refers to the sentimental advocacy of the Rights of man,
as substitutionary of religion and faith in the literary movement of the
eighteenth century. It would comprise Rousseau's gospel of dirt and
sentimentality, Voltaire's substitution of wit for wisdom, and the
science of the encyclopædists floating disoriented upon the waters of
un,, certainty, in lieu of the deep thought of the solitary thinkers
that preceded them. These last were men who, heretofore walking humbly
and without association in conspiracy, interrogated the universe,
divinely sown with riddles in great abundance by a hand invisible, until
they fell asleep into that hand, and awoke to the illuminated answers.

The blood of sisters was the wholesale slaughter of women that
distinguished the Revolution, whilst church altars were desecrated by
naked women, set there to personate the goddess of impure reason,
feigning *la sante dame*.

The quatrain 25 that follows this in the text of Nostradamus I now give;
but this verse 24, so far as I have seen, has never been commented upon
nor has the connection been pointed out. Yet this stanza furnishes the
reasons why the stars became overclouded to a people that were
benighted, *par ces raisons*, as the reader will perceive by the second
line that succeeds this.

Century IV.--*Quatrain* 25. \[I. 167.\]

Corps sublimes <span id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_227) sans fin à l'œil
visibles,  
Obnubiler <span id="fr_229"></span>[2](#fn_228) viendront par ces
raisons.

id="fr_231"></span>[4](#fn_230) chief <span
id="fr_232"></span>[5](#fn_231) et invisibles.  
Diminuant les sacrées oraisons.

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

Translation.

The infinite stars are links that light to doubt,  
And drop the pall of night upon the soul:  
The eye and front of man,--and soul,--grown cerebral,  
God and His host withdraw; and with them prayer!

M. le Pelletier considers that Nostradamus attributes these effects to
the reasonings hostile to the faith that improved optical instruments
will introduce, as they suggest a plurality of worlds. I quite admit
that in many minds this has been the tendency. Almost any discovery,
giving a new hint as to infinitude, launches a number of inferior but
vigorous brains into new lines of reasoning. We then get great
multiplication of secondary volumes, which supply minced Aristotle or
chaff to represent any amount of sausage-meat required by the reading
public. Of course the further you can see by the telescope the further
you put heaven away from the earth-dweller, and he loves it the less;
for it is the near things we love, and not the remote. The heart is not
universal, and cannot be stretched to it. I look upon the telescope, to
an ordinary man, as a drain-pipe, through which he can run off and lose
the moisture of his soul and live the worse for it afterwards; to the
multitude of men, useless; to the scientific man, a means of inflation
and puffing up; and to the really serious and isolated thinker, as the
threshold of infinitude that may, though it has hardly yet done so,
answer a few out of the ten million astral riddles sown in space. The
last-named individual alone may benefit a little by it. But I question
if anything at all of this was present to Nostradamus.

He seems to me, in these two closely interlinked quatrains, to enlarge
much upon the theme of St. Paul (Rom. i. 28) that, as at the French
Revolution, "they did not like

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate
mind;" or one void of judgment, "to do things which are not convenient."
So that the earth gave out deceptive voices to them, and false lights
for Divine light, to slay women and desecrate the temples; and then that
the very stars visible to the eye, which should teach faith to all, will
for these reasons veil themselves and leave nothing to mankind but the
darkness of night. Pure materialism follows, God and His host withdraw,
and prayer is no more heard upon the earth.

Century I.--*Quatrain* 60. \[I. 168.\]

Un empereur naistra près d'Italie,  
Qui à l'Empire sera vendu bien cher:  
Diront avec quels gens il se ralie,  
Qu'on trouvera moins prince que boucher.

Translation.

An emperor shall be born near Italy,  
Bought by the Empire at a bankrupt rate:  
You'd say the herd, he gathers to himself,  
Denote him butcher rather than a prince.

An emperor shall be born in Corsica--Napoléon Bonaparte. His advent to
the throne of France will prove prodigiously costly to her. It is enough
to make one say, from the tribe he surrounds himself with, that he is
more like a butcher far, with the steel dangling at his side, and
slaughter-man apprentices, than a prince.

It is natural that Bouys, who has hunted Nostradamus for quatrains that
will serve for adulation of Napoleon, has passed this over, *sub
silentio*, entirely. Garencières, speaking of this, says it is a
prophecy for the future, for that until now (1672) no such emperor has
been heard of, born near Italy, that cost so much and proved a butcher.

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

Century VI.--*Quatrain* 23. \[I. 169.\]

D'esprit de regne munismes <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_232)

Et seront peuples esmeus contre leur Roy:  
Paix, sainct nouveau, sainctes loix empirées,

id="fr_235"></span>[3](#fn_234) fut en si trèsdur arroy. <span
id="fr_236"></span>[4](#fn_235)

Translation.

The rampart of tradition battered down,  
The people rise against their King anoint':  
Peace, a new Saint, and sacred laws made worse,  
Paris was never in such disarray.

The traditions of the French monarchy are thrown to the ground and the
people rise against the King, Louis XVI. Peace will succeed the anarchy
when Napoleon comes to power. Pius VII., to flatter the Emperor, will
interpolate the ritual on the 15th of August with a new saint, the fête
of St. Napoleon, <span id="fr_237"></span>[5](#fn_236) who was martyred
under Diocletian. The Emperor's interference will hurt the Church
greatly, and foreign armies (1814-1815) will reduce Paris to extremities
she has never before undergone.

As to the fête of St. Napoleon, the story runs that when it was first
instituted its impropriety, if not blasphemy, was

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

much discussed in Catholic circles. An Irish priest from Rome was one
day communicating the strange fact at a dinner-table in Dublin, when an
Irish gentleman exclaimed with vehemence, "What d----d impudence!" "No,
no!" said the priest, "what you mean to call it is the Blessed
Assumption," for that day falls on the 15th of August.

Century I.--*Quatrain* 31. \[I. 170.\]

Tant <span id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_237) d'ans en Gaule les guerres

Outre <span id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_238) la course du Castulon <span

Victoire incerte <span id="fr_241"></span>[4](#fn_240) trois grands
couronneront,  
Aigle, Coq-lune, Lyon-soleil en marque.

Translation.

War draws her length in Gaul for many a day,  
Beyond the course of Castula the Queen;  
Uncertain victory will crown three thrones,  
The Eagle, Cock-moon, Lion-sun, on coin.

Civil war and foreign will last in France long after the ephemeral
Republic has perished. Victory, always uncertain, will crown three
houses in succession. They will coin money with the Imperial eagle of
Napoleon; the revolutionary Gallic cock appearing with the house of
Orleans, instituted by revolution, and adding the crescent of Mahomet
for successes in Algeria; whilst the Lion represents Louis XVIII. and
Charles X. of the Capetian Monarchy, with the sun representing
Catholicism. Le Pelletier says the *Sun* symbolises Christianity, and
the moon Mahomet or Antichrist. Myself I think it would be best to
consider the sun

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

as the symbol of Christ; the *moon* as the symbol of atheistic democracy
or Antichrist.

This Garencières thought to be interpretable in his time He reads the
second line,

"Outre la course du Castulon monarque,"

as, after the death of the King of Spain a Castilian monarch. The eagle
as Charles V. \[a further analogy with Napoleon\]. Henry II.,
contemporary with Nostradamus, and Soliman, which three crowns met under
Leo with uncertain odds in war.

The quatrain that follows this is:

Century I.--*Quatrain* 32.

Le grand Empire sera tost translaté,  
En lieu petit qui bientost viendra croistre,  
Lieu bien infime d'exigue comté,  
Où au milieu viendra poser son sceptre.

Translation.

The great Empire will soon be translated into a little place that
quickly, will expand. An unworthy spot, a mere county, from the midst of
which he will come to lay aside his sceptre.

Garencières interprets this of Charles V., who, three years before his
death, resigned Spain and the Low Countries to Philip II., his son, and
the empire to his brother Ferdinand. He then shut himself up in the
Escurial, in Castile, a monastery; which the son afterwards enlarged
into a grand palace. accounted by Spaniards as the eighth wonder of the
world. But I am not aware that any one has yet pointed out that it fits
Napoleon as patly just as it can Charles. His empire was cramped into
Elba--Æthalia, the soot island (*lieu bien infime*); a mere countship
was his monarchy there. It soon

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

grew again into an empire, but he only came out of its midst to resign
his sceptre a second time and for ever.

After these prelusory flourishes relating to the Vulgar Advent and
French Revolution, we are now to enter upon a more special theme; the
murder of the King, and the ragged beggars' festival and brawl, called
the First Republic of the Sans Culottes.

he interprets it of Voltaire, the encyclopedists and journalists of the
seventeenth century, who assailed the faith and the Church of Rome. But
surely the one like Hannibal was Napoléon, and the *journaux* in this
old speech does not stand for *journals* and newspapers that had no
existence, and therefore no name in the time of Nostradamus *Journal*

Virgin Mary. Of course, if that were the correct etymology, it would
furnish the exact rendering of *Sainte Dame*: but, as it is, it is
equivalent. A voice feigning that of the Blessed Virgin may well be
represented by a voice feigning that of religion and faith. I take this
