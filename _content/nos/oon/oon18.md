### Pius VI

THE next four quatrains refer to Rome and Pope Pius VI.

Century V.--*Quatrain* 57. \[I. 199.\]

Istra <span id="fr_285"></span>[1](#fn_284) de mont Gaulfier <span
id="fr_286"></span>[2](#fn_285) et Aventin,  
Qui <span id="fr_287"></span>[3](#fn_286) par le trou advertira
l'armée.  
Entre deux rocs sera prins <span id="fr_288"></span>[4](#fn_287) le
butin,  
De SEXT <span id="fr_289"></span>[5](#fn_288) mansol <span
id="fr_290"></span>[6](#fn_289) faillir la renommée.

Translation.

When a \[French\] army shall go from Mont Gaulfier to the Aventine,  
There will be a man advising them from under the hole.  
The booty shall be seized between the two rocks,  
And the glory of the sixth celibate shall wither.

This is a very curious stanza. The name of Montgolfier, the aeronaut, is
visible enough in the two separate words, *mont Gaulfier*. M. le
Pelletier calls it the grammatical figure of metaplasm; but it is not
strictly so. Metaplasm is the forming of cases from a non-existent
nominative. This is making two words for things non-existent to
represent a proper name. But there is a still greater singularity in the
employment of it here. For Nostradamus, as I understand him, makes this
fictitious mountain contrast with the real Mount Aventine. He makes it
stand, as I think, for one of the two rocks between which the booty is
secured. The brothers

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Montgolfier were
paper-makers at Annonay Ardèche, and they gave their own name to their
discovery, which dates June 5, 1783. Their balloons opened at the bottom
to be filled, so that a man placed in them was under the hole, *par le
trou*. I do not know at what point the Montgolfier was floated to
furnish military information to the French, but I suppose on the Italian
side of the Alps, so that from that rock or mountain to the Aventine
rock would be the points between which the booty was seized. But the
former of these Nostradamus seems to me to designate by the man's name,
which lends itself to a play upon the word, rather than by a peak of the
Alps. M. le Pelletier says that the two rocks refer to Peter, *pierre*
being *rock*. One is Avignon, in France, and the other Rome, in Italy,
and the booty was obtained by the treaty of Tolentino, under date of
February 19, 1797. By this the Pope lost Avignon and Venaissin in
France, Bolognia, Ferrara, and the Romagnia in Italy, and this he calls
the two rocks. The balloon was first used to reconnoitre the position of
the Austrians at the battle of Fleurus, June 16, 1794. Almost
immediately after the treaty, the Pontiff was dragged from Italy to die
at Valence: thus was fulfilled the prophecy of *faillir la renommée*.
Interpret how you may, the mention of the name of Montgolfier so
appropriately in this connection, must always stand as proof of the most
solid kind that Nostradamus's foresight was miraculous.

Century V.--*Quatrain* 30. \[I. 201.\]

Tout à l'entour de la grande cité  
Seront soldats logés par champs et villes:  
Donner Passaut Paris Rome incité, <span
id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_290)  
Sur le pont <span id="fr_292"></span>[2](#fn_291) lors sera faicte grand
pille.

 

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

Translation.

Compassing all round the great city  
There shall be soldiers camping in the fields and towns:  
A Frenchman \[Paris will take\] Rome excited;  
There will then be perpetrated on the Pope a great pillage.

The Executive Directory, in defiance of the Constitution which formally
forbade it, encamped troops around Paris, *la grande cité*, on September
4, 1797. This was to quell, or keep in awe, the counter revolution. A
Frenchman \[*Paris*\], General Berthier, took Rome by assault, February
10, 1798. the pretext being that General Duphot had lost his life in an
*émeute* \[*dans Rome incité*\]. Pope Pius VI. was dispossessed of his
states, arrested in his palace, and subjected to general pillage.

Century VIII.--*Quatrain* 46. \[I. 202.\]

Translation.

The grand Celibate shall die three leagues from the Rhone;  
The two dejected brothers shall fly tumult:  
For war shall make a most horrible throne  
For the three brothers of France by the Cock and Eagle.

The Pope, that is, shall die at Valence, a few leagues from the Rhone.
The two brothers \[afterwards Louis XVIII. and Charles X.\], alarmed at
the movement of the populace, take flight. War inflicts sad havoc on the
throne of the three

brothers \[Louis XVI., Louis XVIII., Charles X.\] by the Orleans Cock,
and Napoleonic Eagle.

Century II.--*Quatrain* 99. \[I. 203.\]

Translation.

The Roman territory that the Pope governed  
The French will cruelly vex:  
But that Celtic nation should fear the hour  
When it has advanced its army too far to the north.

I render this in the main in accordance with M. le Pelletier; but
perhaps some may think that the Pope cannot be called an augur without
great violence. *Interprétoit* can hardly stand for spiritual
government. It is also difficult to make *classis* into army. *Classis*
represented the orders of the people of Rome; that divided them into
bands and companies for governmental and electoral purposes, not for
war. The only *classis* of war was the *fleet*, and Garencières renders
it by *navy*, although he is entirely abroad in every other respect ill
his interpretation of the quatrain. Though he forces a fulfilment upon
it in the time of Henry II. of France, still, evidently Rome is meant,
whatever the Augur may interpret. The Roman territory was twice trampled
on by the French: first by General Berthier against Plus VI, and again
by General Miollis, who in 1809 removed Pope Pius VII. The closing
couplet is clearly a forecast of Napoleon's defeat in Russia. That will
not be affected by the manner in which we interpret classe; but I cannot
imagine

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

for a moment that Nostradamus would employ the Latin *classis* so
erroneously for an army, which no Roman would ever use it for. *Certamen
classicum* is a sea-fight, but never employed for engagements on land.
The result of this minute verbal inquiry will, I think, end by
establishing the more remarkably the prescience and forecast of this
consummate seer. He uses the word *classe* in one of its late
eighteenth, or early nineteenth century acceptions, for that body of
young men, which is called out every year in France by, lot to serve in
the army; or all those called to the colours, who are drawn for service
in the same year. It is an administrative word, that sprang into use out
of the conscription, and which will die out again when that fraud,
passed upon the nations of Europe, has been detected and abolished; that
institution which fosters war and makes its otherwise intermittent evils
permanent and perpetual upon humanity. To enlarge the area of this view
is to doom conscription to death and sure oblivion. Conscription is an
invention of Beelzebub, when seeking his bath of blood, under the
euphonic guise of a patriotic defence of the mother soil. *Mourir pour
la patrie* is the glozing lie of Roget de l'Isle, that supplements, or
drowns, the true cry of "Blood for Moloch." So we will read, for the
first time now, the passage thus: But let the Celtic nation beware the
hour when her *conscript columns* are pushed too far to the Boreal
northeast. In brief, beware of Moscow. If this sixteenth century
anticipation of a nineteenth century idiom be nothing, then let the Alps
be called a molehill, and the hollow sea a cup. Here we close the
prefiguration of the Papal torment appropriately enough; it closes with
a terrible hint to its tormentor.
