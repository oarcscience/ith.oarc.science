# The National Convention

WE now reach a fresh division, and shall treat of the National
Convention,--a period of about three years.

Century VIII.--*Quatrain* 17. \[I. 189.\]

Les bien aisés subit <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_265) seront
desmis;  
Par les trois freres le monde mis en trouble.  
Cité marine saisiront ennemies;  
Faim, feu, sang, peste, et de tous maux le double.

Translation.

The well-to-do \[members\] shall be suddenly dismissed,  
On account of three brothers the world shall suffer trouble.  
Enemies shall take possession of the marine city;  
Hunger, fire, slaughter, plague, of evils all the double.

Privilege is to be abolished suddenly. The three brothers who trouble
the world are the Royal trio, Louis XVI., Louis XVIII., and Charles X.
Toulon is the maritime city. We shall come upon it again, further on, in
Century VII. 13, where it is treated of more fully. M. le Pelletier
interprets *feu* as being war, and *peste* as standing for irreligion.
As goods were all doubled to Job, so here all evils are to be doubled.
On the night of August 4, 1789, feudal privilege was abolished suddenly
(*subit*). The clergy and nobility were dispossessed of property and
title. Toulon, taken by the English, is the *Cité marine*. It was
retaken, in the name of Louis XVII., on August 23, 1793, by the French;
on the

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 19th of December,
Marie-Antoinette and Égalité, Duc d'Orleans, being both executed during
the British tenure.

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 17. \[I. 191.\]

Le tiers <span id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_266) premier pis que ne fit
Neron,  
Vuidez <span id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_267) vaillant que <span
id="fr_269"></span>[3](#fn_268) sang humain respandre!  
Rédifier fera le forneron, <span id="fr_270"></span>[4](#fn_269)  
Siecle d'or mort, nouveau Roy, grand esclandre!

Translation.

The third become first does worse than Nero,  
See how much valiant human blood it squanders!  
It will rebuild the old tile kilns,  
The age of gold is dead, a new dynasty, and great scandal.

This interprets itself. M. le Pelletier explains the rebuilding of the
kilns as setting up the scaffolds to consume the clergy and nobility. I
do not myself see the force or necessity of this. The age of gold yields
to that of iron or the sword; the new dynasty (the Napoleonic) is a vast
scandal, and reintroduces pomp and ceremonial at the Tuileries.

Century VIII.--*Quatrain* 19. \[I. 192.\]

A <span id="fr_271"></span>[5](#fn_270) soustenir la grand' cappe <span
id="fr_272"></span>[6](#fn_271) troublée,  
Pour l'esclaircir les rouges marcheront:  
De mort famille sera presque accablée,  
Les rouges rouges la rouge assommeront.

Translation.

They will *not* sustain the great but troubled Capets,  
The reds will take steps to purge their number,  
They will almost exterminate the family with death,  
The red of reds will overwhelm the red.

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

This very forcibly announces the Reign of Terror to have set in. The
reds will do what in them lies to crush the Capets, till they have
almost annihilated the family in death; and, then the reddest reds will
guillotine the reds,--the Montagnards the Girondists. Bouys does not
allude to this, though one would have thought it must strike every
reader as far as what is said relating to the conduct of the double-dyed
reds against the moderate reds. Garencières' mistakes serve to show how
impossible it was to guess at the meaning of a quatrain in the
seventeenth century. He fancies this to refer to some conspiracy of red
Cardinals against a Pope, to be designated the Red one.

Century VI.--*Quatrain* 69. \[I. 193.\]

La pitié grand' sera sans loing tarder,  
Ceux qui dônoyent seront contraints de prendre:  
Nuds, affamés, de froid, soif, soy bander,  
Les monts passer commettant grand esclandre.

Translation.

A sight of pity will not long delay,  
The almoners will soon be forced to beg:  
Hungered, athirst, naked, proscribed, and cold.  
In bands they cross the Alps, a scandal to be seen.

This conveys a forcible picture of the calamitous emigration the clergy
of France would undergo between 1792 and 1801. Once the clue is
supplied, it leads So naturally, that one almost finds insight from it
into the manner in which these representations presented themselves to
Nostradamus. One feels, that he must have seen the events passing before
the field of sight as visions, sometimes accompanied with uttered words;
otherwise how could he get intimation of names? But, if it was thus that
intuition came to him, the quatrains, that he now scattered up and down
throughout the Centuries in utter disorder and disconnection, must hare

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

come to him in a sequence, rendering them comprehensible; more or less,
indeed, in the very order probably into which the chronology of
historical record enables the careful student to replace them now, as
soon as they are understood by him. If this be so, a rather curious fact
presents itself, in a form approaching to something like a certainty,
which is this: disorder must have been the method of the book. We know
that generally his practice was to write down the matter in prose, and
at leisure convert this into separate quatrains rhymed; these he must
afterwards have taken up in a bag or hat, and when inextricably mixed
have counted them out into hundreds. I think it quite possible that he
found his forecasts became too intelligible when put together in their
natural order, and in the sequence of events. No doubt, with regard to
those events of his own time and to be soon fulfilled, he first began to
perceive the necessity for inverting or displacing the order.
Consecutive and interlinking stanzas would form a kind of commentary,
and throw mutual light one upon the other; so that the adoption of
disorder would follow as a measure of personal security. He thought that
his sayings should be dark, as becometh the words of the wise; and that
it would be quite time enough, should they grow clear when fulfilled to
a reader, who would take sufficient trouble to elucidate them and bring
out their meaning.

Century I.--*Quatrain* 44. \[I. 194.\]

En bref <span id="fr_273"></span>[1](#fn_272) seront de retour
sacrifices,  
Contrevenans seront mis à martyre;  
Plus ne seront moines, abbés, ne <span id="fr_274"></span>[2](#fn_273)
novices,  
Le miel sera beaucoup plus cher que cire.

This quatrain exhibits the suppression of the Catholic

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

worship in France, which took place November 10, 1793. What they called
the worship of the goddess of Reason was set up; and a return to
Paganism is what the first line means.

Translation.

For a short time there will be a return to \[Ethnic\] sacrifices,  
And those who oppose will suffer martyrdom:  
There will be no more monks, clergy, nor novices;  
Honey will fetch more than wax.

The last line means that wax will be cheapened, as none will be consumed
in the churches. The rest explains itself. Garencières can see the
meaning of the last two lines; but the first two he considers to have
been fulfilled in the time of Henry V. of France and Henry VIII. of
England.

Century II.--*Quatrain* 8. \[I. 195.\]

Temples sacrés <span id="fr_275"></span>[1](#fn_274) prime <span
id="fr_276"></span>[2](#fn_275) façon Romaine,  
Rejetterons les gofres <span id="fr_277"></span>[3](#fn_276)
fondements,  
Prennant leurs loix premieres et humaines,  
Chassant non tons des saincts les cultements. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[4](#fn_277)

Translation.

The temples consecrated in the fashion of early Rome,  
They will reject the deep foundations \[of Christianity\].  
Returning to their first and human laws,  
They will not entirely abolish all saint-worship.

This A le Pelletier explains to be a forecast of the *Fête de l'Étre
Suprème*, which was appointed by decree of the Convention May 7, 1794,
and celebrated on the 8th of June of the same year with great pomp.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

Century V.--*Quatrain* 33. \[I. 196.\]

Des principaux de cité rebellée.  
Qui tiendront <span id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_278) fort pour liberté
r'avoir,  
Detranchés <span id="fr_280"></span>[2](#fn_279) masles, infelice <span
id="fr_281"></span>[3](#fn_280), meslée,  
Cris, hurlements, à Nantes piteux voir!

Translation.

The chief citizens of the revolted city,  
Who will struggle hard to recover liberty.  
The men beheaded, an unhappy mixture,  
Cries, howlings, at Nantes piteous to see.

This was realized at Nantes, in Britany, under the Proconsulate of De
Carrier. The town had, in 1793, become the focus of the Vendean reaction
against the National Convention. The men were beheaded generally, but
many men and women were stripped naked. They were then tied together, a
man to a woman, in couples, or pairs, which their fiendish tormentors
styled "republican marriages." In this diabolic connection (*infelice
meslée*) they were precipitated helplessly into the Loire, amidst
heartrending cries and howlings. No viler crime was ever committed on
this earth, nor can ever be; the infamy of man and the revengeful filth
of lust can no further go. From that extraordinary coinage and coupling
of words, *infelice meslée*, you know, or seem to know, that Nostradamus
beheld the horrid spectacle in vision--

Estant assis de nuict secret estude (Century *I*. 1).

Those who believe this to be a recital at haphazard are of a
brain-formation singularly constituted.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

Century VIII.--*Quatrain* 88.

Dans la Sardeigne un noble Roy viendra,  
Qui ne tiendra que trois ans le royaume.  
Plusieurs couleurs avec soy conjoindra, <span
id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_281)  
Luy mesme après soin sommeil marrit <span
id="fr_283"></span>[2](#fn_282) scome. <span
id="fr_284"></span>[3](#fn_283)

Translation.

In Sardinia a noble King shall come,  
Who will only hold the kingdom during three years.  
The tricolour will annex him \[the King\] to itself;  
He after much pains will sleep afflicted and ridiculed.

This is Charles Emmanuel IV. The Republic of the tricolour, "le drapeau
tricolor," will despoil him of his continental estate; and he will
withdraw to his island, ruling for three years, 1798-1802. He then
abdicates to his brother, Victor Emmanuel I., and, *après soin* much
care, will sleep \[as regards governing\], and, residing at Rome. sad
and humiliated, will assume the Jesuit robe, and die in 1819.
