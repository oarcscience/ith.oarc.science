From good to the evil times will change,<BR>
The peace in the South, the expectation of the Greatest Ones:<BR>
The Great Ones grieving Louis too much more will stumble,<BR>
Well-known Shaven Ones have neither power not understanding.<BR>
<P>
This is the month for evils so many as to be doubled,<BR>
Deaths, plague to drain all, famine, to quarrel:<BR>

Jovial Ones put on the road, every sect to become angry.<BR>
