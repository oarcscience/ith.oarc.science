### NOTES TO CHAPTER XXI.

(*a*) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Evil
Spirits.

(*b*) MAGOT performs the Operations hereof

(*c*) The Familiar Spirits cannot well execute the Operations of this
Chapter.

(*d*) This is rather a fascination than anything else. Take the Symbol
desired in your left hand and stroke the face therewith. Abraham further
observes that such an Operation performed by an ordinary Magician would
be easily seen through by the possessor of the Sacred Magic; while on
the contrary this latter would be safe from detection by ordinary
Sorcerers.

(*e*) The Student will note in these Squares the marked position of the
Letter Q, as in many other cases where the effect aimed at seems to be
rather a deception of the senses of others.

No. 1 consists of 16 Squares from a Square of 25. ZAKEN means "old".

No. 2 is a Gnomon of 16 Squares with the Letter Q added; from a Square
of 72 Squares.--DISKENAH = "in the likeness of an old woman". It is to
be remarked that this Square is rather oblong, 8 Squares long by 9 deep.

No. 3 consists of 20 Squares from a Square of 49.--DISAKAN means "to
cover up or hide," but were it DISAKAR it would mean "as one young".

No. 4 consists of 10 Squares from a Square of 25 Squares.--IONEK means
"thy dove".

No. 5 consists of 16 Squares from a Square of 25.--BACUR = "a
firstborn".
