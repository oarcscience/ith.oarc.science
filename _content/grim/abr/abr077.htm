</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">NOTES TO CHAPTER XVI.</h3>  
<p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Angels or by the Guardian Angel.</p>  
<p>(<i>b</i>) ASTAROT and ARITON both execute the Operations hereof by their Ministers, yet not together, but each separately.</p>  
<p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits cannot well execute the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
<p>(<i>d</i>) Select the Symbol of the Treasure desired, and the Spirit will then shew it to you. Then place the Symbol at once upon the Treasure, and it will no longer be possible for it to disappear into the ground, nor for it to be carried away. Furthermore any Spirits which may be guarding it will thus be put to flight, and you can then dispose of the Treasure as you wish.</p>  
<p>(<i>e</i>) No. 1 is a species of border of 28 Squares of which 18 are occupied by letters, taken from a Square of 64 Squares.--TIPHARAH means "Glory, beauty, a shining thing". ITI is the Chaldaic for "is, are".</p>

<p>No. 2 is a Gnomon of 9 Squares taken from a Square of 25 Squares. CESEP means "Silver". This Square should therefore probably be numbered 1, or 8, or 18.</p>

<p>No. 7 is a Gnomon of 9 Squares taken from a Square of 25 Squares. COSEN perhaps means "a golden cup".</p>  
<p>No. 8 is a Gnomon also of 9 Squares taken from a Square of 25 Squares.--OTSAR means "restraint".</p>  
<p>No. 9 is a Square of 36 Squares. BELIAL is the name of one of the four great chiefs of the Evil Spirits.</p>  
<p>No. 10 is a Square of 25 Squares.--ORION, the celebrated mythological name of the Greek hunter, and of the constellation, is perhaps used here as the name of a Spirit.</p>  
<p>No. 11 is a border of 10 Squares taken from a Square of 25 Squares.--KERMA means either "a cutting off" or else "a super-inducing".</p>  
<p>No. 12 is a Square of 16 Squares.</p>
