<p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter arc manifested only by the Angels or by the Guardian Angel.</p>  
<p>(<i>b</i>) ORIENS, PAIMON, ARITON, and AMAYMON execute the Operations hereof by means of their Common Ministers.</p>  
<p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits can hardly be said so much of themselves to be able to execute the Operations of this Chapter, as under the rule of the aforementioned Spirits.</p>  
<p>(<i>d</i>) Each person can have four Familiar Spirits and no more: the first working from Sunrise to Midday; the second from Midday till Sunset; the third from Sunset to Midnight; and the fourth from Midnight till Sunrise. Such Spirits may also be loaned to friends, in which case you can avail yourself of another ordinary Spirit in place.</p>  
<p>(<i>e</i>) The Square numbered 1 is not however placed first in Order in the MS., but fifth. It is a Gnomon of 11 Squares taken from a Square of 36 Squares. ANAKIM = Hebrew ONQIM = Giants; the root ONQ also = a necklace or torque. This word "Anakim" hardly appears to have any reference to the form of a lion.--No. 2 is a Gnomon of 11 Squares again, taken from a Square of 36 Squares, and is in the MS. placed sixth in order.--CEPHIR in Hebrew means KPIR a young Lion; and this Square should probably therefore be numbered 1.--No. 3 is a Gnomon of 13 Squares taken from a Square of 49 Squares; and in the MS. occupies the first place in order. OIKETIS, Greek, means a maid-servant or feminine page. This Square therefore should probably be numbered 2.--NO. 4 is a Gnomon of 9 Squares taken from a Square of 25 Squares, PARAS = Hebrew PRSh, a horse, or horseman, while PRS = an ossifrage, a bird of the hawk or eagle kind. This Square is apparently correctly numbered, though in the MS. it is in the second place.--No. 5 is a Gnomon of 9 Squares taken from a Square of 25 Squares. RACAH is apparently from the Hebrew RQH meaning vain, empty; and does not seem to have any particular reference to any of the forms mentioned for the Symbols.--No. 6 is again a Gnomon of 9 Squares, taken from a Square of 25 Squares. It is placed fourth in order in the MS.--CUSIS may be from the dative plural of the Greek word KUON = a dog, but in Hebrew it would mean numbering, computing.--No. 7 is a border of 24 Squares taken from a Square of 49 Squares. PERACHI, perhaps from PRK, Savagery. DB is a Bear in Hebrew.--No. 8 is a Square of 25 Squares. RISIR, <i>perhaps</i> from Latin "RISOR," a mocker or jester. ISERI, perhaps from Hebrew or Chaldaic Root, ISR, to punish or whip. SEKES, perhaps from SChSh = reborn by hope.--No. 9 is again a Square of 25 Squares. NESER = Hebrew, NShR, an Eagle; which seems to shew that this Square should be numbered 5. ELEHE is probably ALHI, Hebrew = My God. SEPES? ShPS = the hair on the lip, the moustache.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> RESEN = RSN Heb., = a bridle, or bit.--No. 10 is a Gnomon of 11 Squares taken from a Square of 36 Squares. PETHEN = Hebrew, PThN, an Asp or venomous Serpent, whence this Square should probably be numbered 11.--No. 11 is a Square of 25 Squares. KALEF, = KLP, Hebrew, a hammer. ARARE from Hebrew ARR to curse, cursed. LAMAL perhaps means "in speaking" from MLL, Hebrew, to speak.--No. 12 is a Gnomon of 9 Squares taken from a Square of 25 Squares. KOBHA = perhaps Hebrew KBH = to extinguish.</p>
