<p>PAIMON (alone) performeth:--</p>

<p>Chapter XXX. (To cause Comedies, Operas, and every kind of Music and Dances to appear.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>ASMODEE (performeth):--</p>  
<p>Chapter XII. (To know the Secrets of any person.)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A></p>

<p>Chapter XXII. (This Chapter is only for Evil, for with the Symbols herein we can cast Spells, and work every kind of Evil; we should not avail ourselves hereof.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The Operations of the following Chapters can also (to a great extent) be administered by the Familiar Spirits, namely:--</p>  
<p>Chapter II. (Scientific Information.)</p>

<p>Chapter XII. (Secrets of other persons.)</p>

<p>Chapter XXVII. (Causing Visions to appear.)</p>  
<p>Chapter XXVIII. (Obtaining Money.)</p>  
<p>Chapter XXX. (Visions of Operas, Comedies, etc.)</p>  
<p>If at the beginning they excuse themselves from the performance, there is probably some hindering cause, and in this case you should make use of other Spirits; but otherwise they must obey you in and throughout everything that you shall command them.</p>
