<P>I, N.N., a servant of God, desire, call upon and conjure thee, Spirit Phuel, by the Holy Messengers and all the Disciples of the Lord, by the four Holy Evangelists and the three Holy Men of God and by the most terrible and most holy words Abriel, Fibriel, Zada, Zaday, Zarabo, Laragola, Lavaterium, Laroyol, Zay, Zagin, Labir, Lya, Adeo, Deus, Alon, Abay, Alos, Pieus, Ehos, Mihi, Uini, Mora, Zorad, and by those holy words, that thou come and appear before me, N.N., in a beautiful human form, and bring me what I desire. (This the conjuror must name.)</P>

<P>This Seal from the Choir of the Dominationen, or Hosts, the following are the most useful: Aha, Rosh, Habu, Aromicha, Lemar, Patteny, Hamya, Azoth, Hayozer, Karohel, Wezynna, Patecha, Tehom.
