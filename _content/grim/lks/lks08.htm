<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE MAGICAL CIRCLE.</H3>
<P>This is the Form of the Magical Circle of King Solomon, the which he made that he might preserve himself therein from the malice of these Evil Spirits. (See <I>Frontispiece, Figure</I> 153 <A NAME="img_fig153-4"></A>
<A HREF="img/fig153-4.jpg"><IMG SRC="tn/generic.jpg"></A>) This Magical Circle is to be made 9 feet across, and the Divine Names are to be written around it, beginning at EHYEH, and ending at LEVANAH, Luna.</P>
<P>(Colours.--The space between the outer and inner circles, where the serpent is coiled, with the Hebrew names written along his body, is bright deep yellow. The square in the centre of the circle, where the word "Master" is written, is filled in with red. All names and letters are in black. In the Hexagrams the outer triangles where the letters A, D, O, N, A, I, appear are filled in with bright yellow, the centres, where the T-shaped crosses are, blue or green. In the Pentagrams outside the circle, the outer triangles where "Te, tra, gram, ma, ton," is written, are filled in bright yellow, and the centres with the T crosses written therein are red.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>)</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_30"></A><A HREF="lks08.htm#fr_30">49:1</A> The coiled serpent is only shown in one private codex, the Hebrew names being in most cases simply written round in a somewhat spiral arrangement within the double circle. It is to be remembered that Hebrew is always written from right to left, <A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A> instead of from left to right like ordinary European languages. The small Maltese crosses are placed to mark the conclusion of each separate set of Hebrew names. These names are those of Deity Angels and Archangels allotted by the Qabalists to each of the 9 first Sephiroth or Divine Emanations. In English letters they run thus, beginning from the head of the serpent: &#10016 Ehyeh Kether Metatron Chaioth Ha-Qadehs Rashith Ha-Galgalim S.P.M. (for "Sphere of the Primum Mobile") &#10016 Iah Chokmah Ratziel Auphanim Masloth S.S.F (for "Sphere of the Fixed Stars," or S.Z. for "Sphere of the Zodiac") &#10016 Iehovah Eolhim, Binah Tzadquiel Aralim Shabbathai S. (for "Sphere") of Saturn &#10016 El Chesed Tzadquiel Chaschmalim Tzedeq S. of Jupiter &#10016 Elohim Gibor Geburah Kamael Seraphim Madim S. of Mars &#10016 Iehovah Eloah Va-Da&auml;th Tiphereth Rapha&ecirc;l Malakim Shemesh S. of the Sun &#10016 Iehovah Tzabaoth Netzach Haniel Elohim Nogah S. of Venus. &#10016 Elohim Tzabaoth Hod Micha&ecirc;l Beni Elohim Kokav S. of Mercury &#10016 Shadda&iuml; El Chai Iesod Gabriel Cherubim Levanah S. of the Moon &#10016.</P>
