<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PRELIMINARY DEFINITION OF MAGIC.</H1>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">LEMEGETON VEL CLAVICULA SALOMONIS REGIS</B></FONT>.</P>
<P>MAGIC is the Highest, most Absolute, and most Divine Knowledge of Natural Philosophy,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> advanced in its works and wonderful operations by a right understanding of the inward and occult virtue of things; so that true Agents&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> being applied to proper Patients,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> strange and admirable effects will thereby be produced. Whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into Nature; they, because of their skill, know how to anticipate an effort,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the which to the vulgar shall seem to be a miracle.</P>
<P>Origen saith that the Magical Art doth not contain anything subsisting, but although it should, yet that it must not be Evil, or subject to contempt or scorn; and doth distinguish the <I>Natural Magic</I> from that which is <I>Diabolical</I>.</P>
<P>Apollonius Tyannaeus only exercised the <I>Natural Magic</I>, by the which he did perform wonderful things.</P>
<P>Philo Hebraeus saith that true Magic, by which we do arrive at the understanding of the Secret Works of Nature, is so far from being contemptible that the greatest Monarchs and Kings have studied it. Nay! among the Persians none might reign unless he was skilful in this GREAT ART.</P>

<P>This Noble Science often degenerateth, from <I>Natural</I> becometh <I>Diabolical</I>, and from <I>True Philosophy</I> turneth unto <I>Nigromancy</I>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The which is wholly to be charged upon its followers, who, abusing or not being capable of that High and Mystical Knowledge do immediately hearken unto the temptations of <I>Sathan</I>, and are misled by him into the Study of the <I>Black Art</I>. Hence it is that Magic lieth under disgrace, and they who seek after it are vulgarly esteemed <I>Sorcerers</I>.</P>
<P>The Fraternity of the Rosie Crusians thought it not fit to style themselves Magicians, but rather Philosophers. And they be not ignorant Empiricks,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> but learned and experienced Physicians, whose remedies be not only Lawful but Divine.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION.</H3>
<P>(N.B. This is taken from several MS. Codices, of which the four principal variations are here composed together in parallel columns as an example of the close agreement of the various texts of the Lemegeton.</P>
<P>For in the whole work the differences in the wording of the various Codices are not sufficient to require the constant giving of parallel readings; but except in the more ancient examples there is much deterioration in the Seals and Sigils, so that in this latter respect the more recent exemplars are not entirely reliable.)</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Seals and Characters to each Spirit and the manner of calling them forth to visible appearance:</P>
<P>In 5 parts, viz.:</P>
<P>(1) THE FIRST PART is a Book of Evil Spirits, called GOETIA, showing how he bound up those Spirits, and used them in general things, whereby he obtained great fame.</P>

<P>(3) THE THIRD PART is of Spirits governing the Planetary Hours, and what Spirits belong to every degree, of the Signs, and Planets in the Signs. Called the PAULINE ART, etc.</P>
<P>(4) THE FOURTH PART of this Book is called ALMADEL or SOLOMON, which containeth those Spirits which govern the Four Altitudes, or the 360 Degrees of the Zodiac.</P>
<P>These two last Orders of Spirits are Good, and to be sought for by Divine seeking, etc., and are called THEURGIA.</P>
<P>(5) THE FIFTH PART is a Book of Orations and Prayers that Wise Solomon used upon the Altar in the Temple. The which is called ARS NOVA, which was revealed unto Solomon by that Holy Angel of God called MICHAEL; and he also received many brief Notes written with the Finger of God, which were declared to him by the said Angel with Claps of Thunder; without which Notes King Solomon had never obtained his great knowledge, for by them in a short time he knew all Arts and Sciences both Good and Bad; from these Notes it is called the NOTARY ART, etc.</P>

And although there be many other Books that are said to be his, yet none is to be compared hereunto, for this containeth them all. Though there be titles with several other Names of the Book, as THE BOOK HELISOL, which is the very same with this last Book of Lemegeton called ARS NOVA or ARS NOTARIA, etc.</P>
<P>These Books were first found in the Chaldee and Hebrew Tongues at Jerusalem by a Jewish Rabbi; and by him put into the Greek language and thence into the Latin, as it is said.</P>
