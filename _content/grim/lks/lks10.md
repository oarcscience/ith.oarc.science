### THE HEXAGRAM OF SOLOMON.

<span id="img_fig155"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)](img/fig155.jpg)

THIS is the Form of the Hexagram of Solomon, the figure whereof is to be
made on parchment of a calf's skin, and worn at the skirt of thy white
vestment, and covered with a cloth of fine linen white and pure, the
which is to be shown unto the Spirits when they do appear, so that they
be compelled to take human shape upon them and be obedient.

(Colours.--Circle, Hexagon, and T cross in centre outlined in black,
Maltese crosses black; the five exterior

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

triangles of the Hexagram where Te, tra, gram, ma, ton, is written, are
filled in with bright yellow; the T cross in centre is red, with the
three little squares therein in black. The lower exterior triangle,
where the Sigil is drawn in black, is left white. The words
"Tetragrammaton" and "Tau" are in black letters; and AGLA with Alpha and
Omega in red letters.)
