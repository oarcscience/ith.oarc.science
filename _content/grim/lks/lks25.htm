<P>WELCOME Spirit N., O most noble king&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (or kings)! I say thou art welcome unto me, because I have called thee through Him who has created Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, and all that is in them contained, and because also thou hast obeyed. By that same power by the which I have called thee forth, I bind thee, that thou remain affably and visibly here before this Circle (or before this Circle and in this triangle) so constant and so long as I shall have occasion for thy presence; and not to depart without my license until thou hast duly and faithfully performed my will without any falsity.</P>
<P>THEN standing in the midst of the Circle, thou shall stretch forth thine hand in a gesture of command and say:</P>
<P>"BY TIME PENTACLE OF SOLOMON HAVE I CALLED THEE! GIVE UNTO ME A TRUE ANSWER."</P>
<P>Then let the exorcist state his desires and requests.</P>
<P>And when the evocation is finished thou shalt license the Spirit to depart thus:</P>
