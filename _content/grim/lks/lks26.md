### THE LICENSE TO DEPART.

O THOU Spirit N., because thou hast-diligently answered unto my,
demands, and hast been very ready and willing to come at my call, I do
here license thee to depart unto thy proper place; without causing harm
or danger unto man or beast. Depart, then, I say, and be thou very ready
to come at my call, being duly exorcised and conjured by the sacred
rites of magic. I charge thee to withdraw peaceably and quietly, and the
peace of GOD be ever continued between thee and me I AMEN!

AFTER thou hast given the Spirit license to depart, thou art not to go
out of the circle until he or they be gone, and until thou shalt have
made prayers and rendered thanks unto God for the great blessings He
hath bestowed upon thee in granting thy desires, and delivering thee
from all the malice of the enemy the devil.

Also note! Thou mayest command these spirits into the Vessel of Brass in
the same manner as thou dost into the triangle, by saying: "that thou
dost forthwith appear before this Circle, in this Vessel of Brass, in a
fair and comely shape," etc., as hath been shown in the foregoing
conjurations.
