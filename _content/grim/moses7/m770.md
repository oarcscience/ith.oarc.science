### CHAPTER XI. BREASTPLATE OF MOSES

![](img/09300.jpg)

Conjuration

SCHEDUSI, WEDUSE, TIWISI.--I have sinned, I shall sin.

Prayer

Eternal God of our All! Our god! Hear our voice, spare and have mercy
upon us. Accept our prayer in mercy and with pleasure. I have sinned. I
have committed transgressions. I have sinned before Thee. I have done
that which is displeasing unto Thee here in the earth. For the sake of
Thy great name pardon me all the sins and iniquities and transgressions
which I have committed against Thee from my youth. Perfect again all the
holy names which I have blemished, Great Champion, terrible, highest
God, eternal Lord, God Sabaoth.
