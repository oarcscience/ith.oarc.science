<P>If you want to compel spirits to appear visibly before you and render you obedience, observe the following instructions:</P>
<P>1. Keep God's commandments as much as possible.</P>
<P>2. Build and trust solely upon the might and power of God: believe firmly in his omnipotent help in your work, and the spirits will become your servants and will obey you.</P>
<P>3. Continue your citations and do not cease, even if the spirits do not appear at once. Be steadfast in your work and have faith, for the doubter will obtain nothing.</P>
<P>4. Take special note of the times for the invocation:</P>

<P>5. The time must be the new moon, that is, the moon must be waxing.</P>
<P>6. Trace the circle {below} on parchment with the blood of Young white doves. The size of the circle is optional.</P>
<P>7. The circle must be consecrated before the ceremony, with the following words:</P>
<P>Ego (name of the conjuror), consecro et benedico istum circulum per Nomina Dei Attisimi in ec Scripta, ut sit mihi et omnibus Scutum et Protectio dei Fortissimi Elohim Invincibilie contra omnes malignos Spiritus, gerurmque Potestates. In Nomine Dei Patris Dei Filii Dei Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</P>
<P>Upon your entrance into this circle, speak as follows: Tetragrammaton, Theos, Ischiros, Athanatos, Messias, Imas, Kyrie Eleison. Amen.</P>
<P>After you have entered the circle, begin your operation with the following prayer from the Ninety-first psalm:</P>
<P>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in Him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver me from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust. His truth shall be thy shield and thy buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night nor of the arrow that flieth by day. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation. There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. Because he has set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him. I will set him on high because he has known my name. He will call upon me and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him and honor him. With long life will I satisfy him and show him My salvation. Even so help me and all them that seek thy holy God the Father <IMG SRC="img/cross.jpg"> God the Son <IMG SRC="img/cross.jpg"> God the Holy Ghost <IMG SRC="img/cross.jpg">, Amen.</P>
