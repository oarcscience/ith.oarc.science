CHAP. II.

WHAT DIGNITY AND PREPARATION IS ESSENTIALLY NECESSARY TO HIM WHO WOULD
BECOME A TRUE MAGICIAN.

IT is fit that we who endeavour to attain so great a height should first
study two things: *viz.* First, how we should leave vain and carnal
affections, frail sense and material passions; Secondly, by what ways
and means we may ascend to an intellect pure, and joined with the powers
of the celestials, without which we shall never happily ascend to the
scrutiny of secret things, and to the power of working wonderful
effects, &c. Now, if thou art a man perfect in thy understanding, and
constantly meditating upon what we have in this book written, and
without doubting, believeth, thou shalt be able, by praying,
consecrating, deprecating, invocating, &c. to attract spiritual and
celestial gifts, and to imprint them on whatever things thou shalt
please; and by it to vivify every magical work.
