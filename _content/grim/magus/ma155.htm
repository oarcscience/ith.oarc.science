<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE TWENTY-EIGHT MANSIONS OF THE MOON, AND THEIR VIRTUES</FONT>.</P>
<P>AND seeing the Moon measures the whole space of the Zodiac in the time of twenty-eight days, hence it is that the wise men of the <I>Indians</I>, and most of the antient astrologers have granted twenty-eight mansions to the Moon, which, being fixed in the eighth sphere, do enjoy (as <I>Alpharus</I> says) divers names and properties, from the various signs and stars which are contained in them; through which, while the Moon wanders, it obtains many other powers and virtues; but every one of these mansions, according to the opinion of <I>Abraham</I>, contained twelve degrees, and fifty-one minutes, and almost twenty</P>
<P><A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A></P>
<P>six seconds, whose names, and also their beginnings in the Zodiac, of the eighth sphere, are these:--The first is called <I>Alnath</I>; that is, the horns of Aries: his beginning is from the head of Aries, of the eighth sphere: it causes discords and journies. The second is called <I>Allothaim</I>, or <I>Albochan</I>; that is, the belly of Aries; and his beginning is from the twelfth degree of the same sign, fifty-one minutes, twenty-two seconds complete: it conduces to the finding of treasures, and to the retaining captives. The third is called, <I>Achaomazon</I>, or <I>Athoray</I>; that is, showering, or Pleiades: his beginning is from the twenty-fifth degree of Aries complete, forty-two minutes, and fifty-one seconds; it is profitable to sailors, huntsmen, and alchymists. The fourth mansion is called <I>Aldebaram</I>, or <I>Aldelamen</I>; that is, the eye or head of Taurus: his beginning is from the eighth degree of Taurus, thirty-four minutes and seventeen seconds of the same, Taurus being excluded: it causes the destruction and hindrances of buildings, fountains, wells, gold mines, the flight of creeping things, and begets discord. The fifth is called <I>Alchatay</I>, or <I>Albachay</I>; the beginning of it is after the twenty-first degree of Taurus, twenty-five minutes, forty seconds: it helps to the return from a journey, to the instruction of scholars; it confirms edifices, it gives health and good-will. The sixth is called <I>Athanna</I>, or <I>Alchaya</I>; that is, the little star of great light: his beginning is after the fourth degree of Gemini, seventeen minutes, and nine seconds; it conduces to hunting and besieging towns, and revenge of princes: it destroys harvest and fruits, and hinders the operation of the physician. The seventh is called <I>Aldimiach</I>, or <I>Alarzach</I>; that is, the arm of Gemini, and begins from the seventeenth degree of Gemini, eight minutes, and thirty-four seconds, and lasts even to the end of the sign; it confirms gain and friendship; it is profitable to lovers, and destroys magistracies: and so is one quarter of the heaven completed in these seven mansions, and in the like order and number of degrees, minutes, and seconds the remaining mansions, in every quarter, have their several beginnings namely, so that in the first sign of this quarter three mansions take their beginnings; in the other two signs, two mansions in each; therefore the seven following mansions begin with Cancer, whose names are <I>Alnaza Anatrachya</I>; that is, misty or cloudy, <I>viz.</I> the eighth</P>
<P><A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A></P>
<P>mansion; it causes love, friendship, and society of fellow travellers: it drives away mice, and afflicts captives, confirming their imprisonment. After this is the ninth, called <I>Archaam</I>, or <I>Arcaph</I>; that is, the eye of the Lion: it hinders harvest and travellers, and puts discord between men. The tenth is called <I>Algelioche</I>, or Albgebh; that is, the neck or forehead of Leo: it strengthens buildings, promotes love, benevolence, and help against enemies. The eleventh is called <I>Azobra</I>, or <I>Ardaf</I>; that is, the hair of the lion's head: it is good for voyages, and gain by merchandise, and for redemption of captives. The twelfth is called <I>Alzarpha</I>, or <I>Azarpha</I>; that is the tail of Leo: it gives prosperity to harvest and plantations, but hinders seamen; and is good for the bettering of servants, captives, and companions. The thirteenth is named <I>Alhaire</I>; that is, Dog stars, or the wings of Virgo: it is prevalent for benevolence, gain, voyages, harvests, and freedom of captives. The fourteenth is called <I>Achureth</I>, or <I>Arimet</I>; by others, <I>Azimeth</I>, or <I>Athumech</I>, or <I>Alcheymech</I>; that is, the spike of Virgo, or flying spike: it causes the love of married folks; it cures the sick, is profitable to sailors, but hinders journies by land; and in these the second quarter of the heaven is completed. The other seven follow: the first of which begins in the head of Libra, <I>viz.</I> the fifteenth mansion, and its name is <I>Agrapha</I>, or <I>Algrapha</I>; that is, covered, or covered flying: it is profitable for extracting treasures, for digging of pits, it assists divorce, discord, and destruction of houses and enemies, and hinders travellers. The sixteenth is called <I>Azubene</I>, or <I>Ahubene</I>; that is, the horns of Scorpio: it hinders journies and wedlock, harvest and merchandise; it prevails for redemption of captives. The <A HREF="errata.htm#3">seventeenth</A> is called <I>Alchil</I>; that is, the crown of Scorpio: it betters a bad fortune, makes love durable, strengthens buildings, and helps seamen. The eighteenth is called <I>Alchas</I>, or <I>Altob</I>; that is, the heart of Scorpio: it causes, discord, sedition, conspiracy against princes and mighty ones, and revenge from enemies; but it frees captives, and helps edifices. The nineteenth is called <I>Allatha</I>, or <I>Achala</I>; by others, <I>Hycula</I>, or <I>Axala</I>, that is, the tail of Scorpio: it helps in besieging of cities, and taking of towns, and in the driving of men from their places, and for the destruction of seamen and perdition of captives. The twentieth is called <I>Abnahaya</I>; that is, a beam:</P>
<P><A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A></P>
<P>it helps for the taming of wild beasts, for strengthening of prisons; it destroys the wealth of societies; it compels a man to come to a certain place. The twenty-first is called <I>Abeda</I>, or <I>Albeldach</I>, which is a desert: it is good for harvest, gain, buildings, and travellers, and causes divorce; and in this is the third quarter of heaven completed. There remains the seven last mansions completing the last quarter of Heaven: the first of which, being in order to the twenty-second, beginning from the head of Capricorn, called <I>Sadahacha</I>, or <I>Zodeboluch</I>, or <I>Zandeldena</I>; that is, a pastor: it promotes the flight of servants and captives, that they may escape; and helps the curing of diseases. The twenty-third is called <I>Zabadola</I>, or <I>Zobrach</I>; that is, swallowing: it is for divorce, liberty of captives and health to the sick. The twenty-fourth is called <I>Sadabath</I>, or <I>Chadezoad</I>; that is, the star of fortune: it is prevalent for the benevolence of married people, for the victory of soldiers; it hurts the execution of government, and prevents its being exercised. The twenty-fifth is called <I>Sadalabra</I>, or <I>Sadalachia</I>; that is, a butterfly, or a spreading forth: it favours besieging and revenge; it destroys enemies, and causes divorce; confirms prisons and buildings, hastens messengers; it conduces to spells against copulation, and so binds every member of man that it cannot perform its duty. The twenty-sixth is called <I>Alpharg</I>, or <I>Phragal Mocaden</I>; that is, the first drawing: it causes union, health of captives, destroys building and prisons. The twenty-seventh is called <I>Alchara Alyhalgalmoad</I>, or the second drawing: it increases harvests, revenues, gain, and heals infirmities, but hinders buildings, prolongs prisons, causes danger to seamen, and helps to infer mischiefs on whom you shall please. The twenty-eighth and last is called <I>Albotham</I>, or <I>Atchalcy</I>; that is, Pisces: it increases harvest and merchandise; it secures travellers through dangerous places; it makes for the joy of married people; but it strengthens prisons, and causes loss of treasures. And in these twenty-eight mansions lie hid many secrets of the wisdom of the antients, by which they wrought wonders on all things which are under the circle of the Moon; and they attributed to every mansion his resemblances, images, and seals, and his president intelligences, and worked by the virtue of them after different manners.</P>
