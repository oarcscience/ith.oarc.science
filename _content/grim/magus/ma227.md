CHAP. XV.

OF THE CHARACTERS AND SEALS OF SPIRITS.

WE must now speak of the characters and seals of spirits. Characters are
nothing else than certain unknown letters and writings, preserving the
secrets of spirits and their names from the use and reading of prophane
men, which the ancient called hieroglyphical, or sacred letters, because
devoted to the secrets of God only. They accounted it unlawful to write
the mysteries of God with those characters which prophane and vulgar
things were wrote. Whence Porphyry says, "that the ancients were willing
to conceal God and divine virtues, by sensible figures and by those
things which are visible, yet signifying invisible things;" as being
willing to deliver great mysteries in sacred letters, and explain them
in certain symbolical figures; as when they dedicated all round things
to the world, the sun and the moon, hope and fortune; a circle to the
heavens, and parts of a circle to the moon; pyramids and obelisks to the
fire, a cylinder to the sun and earth.--See the plate.
