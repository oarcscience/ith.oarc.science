<P>AS an Introduction to the Study of Natural Magic, we have thought fit to premise a short discourse on the Influence of the Stars, and on Natural Magic in general, showing how far the influences of the heavenly bodies are useful to our purposes, and likewise to what extent we may admit those influences; rejecting some speculations concerning the planetary inclinations, as far as they appertain to questionary abuses, that seem to us idle, and of no validity, or yet founded on any principles of sound philosophy, or corresponding to the word of God in the Scriptures. In which discourse we have fully set down our reasons for rejecting some parts of astrology, and admitting others which are founded on good principles, and coinciding with the Scriptures and Natural Philosophy: our purpose being to clear the understanding of errors, and not to enforce any thing but what appears to be substantiated by nature, truth, and experiment.</P>
