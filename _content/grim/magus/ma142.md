CHAP. XX.

OF THE NUMBER FIVE, AND ITS SCALE.

THE number Five is of no small force; for it consists of the first even
and the first odd; as of a female and male: for an odd number is the
male, and the even the female; whence arithmeticians call that the
father, and this the mother. Therefore the number five is of no small
perfection or virtue, which proceeds from the mixtion of these numbers;
it is, also, the just middle of the universal number, *viz.* ten: for if
you divide the number ten, there will be nine and one, or eight and two,
and seven and three, or six and four, and every collection makes the
number ten, and the exact middle is always the number five, and its
equa-distant; and therefore it is called, by the Pythagorians, the
number of wedlock, as also of justice, because it divides the number ten
in an even scale. There are five senses in man--sight, hearing,
smelling, tasting, and feeling; five powers in the soul--vegetative,
sensitive, concupiscible, irascible, and rational; five fingers on the
hand; five wandering planets in the heavens, according to which there
are fivefold terms in every sign. In elements there are five kinds of
mixed bodies, *viz.* stones, metals, plants, plant-animals, animals; and
so many kinds of animals--as men, four-footed beasts, creeping,
swimming, and flying. And there are five kinds by which all things are
made of God, *viz.* essence, the same, another, sense, and motion. The
swallow brings forth but five young, which she feeds with equity,
beginning with the eldest, and so the rest according to their age. For
in this number the father Noah found favour with God, and was preserved
in the flood of waters. In the virtue of this number, Abraham, being an
hundred years old, begat a son of Sarah (Sarah being ninety years old,
and a barren woman, and past childbearing), and grew up to be a great
people. Hence, in time of grace, the name of Divine Omnipotency is
called upon in five letters; in time of nature, the name of God was
called upon with three letters שדי, Sadai; in time of the law, the
ineffable name of God was expressed with four letters יהוה instead of
which the Hebrews express אדני Adonai; in time of grace, the ineffable

name of God was written with five letters יהשוה, Jhesu, which is called
upon with no less mystery than that of three letters ישך.
