CHAP. XXI.

OF THE NUMBER SIX, AND THE SCALE.

SIX is a number of perfection, because it is the most perfect in nature,
in the whole course of numbers, from one to ten; and it alone is so
perfect that in the collection of its parts, it results the same,
neither wanting nor abounding;

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

for if the parts thereof, *viz.* the middle, third, and sixth part,
which are three, two, one, be gathered together, they perfectly fill up
the whole body of six, which perfection all the other numbers want.
Hence, by the Pythagorians, it is said to be altogether to be applied to
generation and marriage, and is called the scale of the world; for the
world is made of the number six--neither doth it abound, nor is
defective: hence that is, because the world was finished by God the
sixth day; for the sixth day God saw all things which he had made, and
they were <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9) *very good*; therefore the
heaven, and the earth, and all the host thereof, were finished. It is
also called the number of man, because the sixth day <span
id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10) man was created. And it is also the number
of our redemption; for on the sixth day Christ suffered for our
redemption; whence there is a great affinity between the number six and
the cross, labour, and servitude. Hence it is commanded in the law, that
in six days the manna is to be gathered, and work to be done. Six years
the ground was to be sown; and that the Hebrew servant was to serve his
master six years. Six days the glory of the Lord appeared upon Mount
Sinai, covering it with a cloud. The Cherubims had six wings. Six
circles in the firmament: Artic, Antartic, two Tropics, Equinoctial and
Ecliptical. Six wandering planets: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus,
Mercury, the Moon, running through the latitude of the Zodiac on both
sides the Ecliptic. There are six substantial qualities in the elements,
*viz.* sharpness, thinness, motion; and the contrary to these--dulness,
thickness, and rest. There are six differences of position: upwards,
downwards, before, behind, on the right side, and on the left side.
There are six natural offices, without which nothing can be, *viz.*
magnitude, colour, figure, interval, standing, motion. Also, a solid
figure of any four-square thing hath six superfices. There are six tones
of all harmony, *viz.* five tones, and two half tones which make one
tone, which is the sixth.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[116:1](ma143.htm#fr_9) The sixth day, the
Eternal Wisdom pronounced all things created by his divine hand to be
"*very good*."

<span id="fn_10"></span>[116:2](ma143.htm#fr_10) Hence arose the mystery
of the number of the beast, six hundred three score and six, being the
number of a man--DCLXVI.
