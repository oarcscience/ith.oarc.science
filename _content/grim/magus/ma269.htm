<P>R. GLAUBER, a celebrated chymist of <I>Amsterdam</I>, accounted the <I>Paracelsus</I> of his time: he had travelled much and by that means attained to a great many secrets. He wrote above thirty tracts, in some of which he acted the physician; in others, the adept; and in others, the metallist. He principally excelled in the last capacity, and alchymy.</P>
<P>He was a person of easy and genteel address, and, beyond dispute, well versed in chymistry: being author of the salt, still used in the shops, called <I>Sal Glauberi</I>; as also of all the salts, by oil of vitriol., &amp;c. He is noted for extolling his arcan&aelig; and preparations, and is reported to have traded unfairly with his secrets: the best of them he would sell, at excessive rates, to chymists and others, and would afterwards re-sell them, or make them public, to increase his fame; whence he was continually at variance with them.</P>
<P>The principal of his writings are <I>De Furnis</I>, and <I>De Metallis</I>, which, though wrote in <I>Dutch</I>, have been translated into <I>Latin</I> and <I>English</I>. It was <I>Glauber</I> who shewed, before the States of <I>Holland</I>, that there is gold contained in sand; and made an experiment thereof to their entire satisfaction: but so</P>

<P>much lead, fire, and labour, being employed in procuring it, that the art would not pay charges&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. However he plainly demonstrated, that there is no earth, sand, sulphur, or salt, or other matter, but what contains gold in a greater or less quantity. In short, he possessed a great many secrets, which are at this time in the hands of some of our modern chymists.</P>
