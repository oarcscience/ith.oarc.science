AS an Introduction to the Study of Natural Magic, we have thought fit to
premise a short discourse on the Influence of the Stars, and on Natural
Magic in general, showing how far the influences of the heavenly bodies
are useful to our purposes, and likewise to what extent we may admit
those influences; rejecting some speculations concerning the planetary
inclinations, as far as they appertain to questionary abuses, that seem
to us idle, and of no validity, or yet founded on any principles of
sound philosophy, or corresponding to the word of God in the Scriptures.
In which discourse we have fully set down our reasons for rejecting some
parts of astrology, and admitting others which are founded on good
principles, and coinciding with the Scriptures and Natural Philosophy:
our purpose being to clear the understanding of errors, and not to
enforce any thing but what appears to be substantiated by nature, truth,
and experiment.
