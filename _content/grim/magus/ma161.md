CHAP. XXXIX.

OF THE IMAGES OF THE SUN.

FROM the operations of the Sun they made an image at the hour of the
Sun, the first face of Leo ascending with the Sun; the form of which was
a king crowned, sitting in a chair, having a raven in his bosom, and
under his feet a globe: he is clothed in saffron coloured clothes. They
say that this image renders men invincible and honourable, and helps to
bring their business to a good end, and to drive away vain dreams; also
to be prevalent against fevers, and the plague; and they made it in a
balanite stone, or a ruby, at the hour of the Sun, when he, in his
exaltation, fortunately ascends. They made another image of the Sun in a
diamond, at the hour of the Sun ascending in his exaltation; the figure
of which was a woman crowned, with the gesture of one, dancing and
laughing, standing in a chariot drawn by four horses, having in her
right hand a looking-glass or buckler, in the left a staff, leaning on
her breast, carrying a flame of fire on her head. They say that this
image renders a man fortunate, and rich, and beloved of all; and they
made this image on a cornelian stone, at the hour of the Sun ascending
in the first face of Leo, against lunatic passions, which proceed from
the combustion of the Moon.
