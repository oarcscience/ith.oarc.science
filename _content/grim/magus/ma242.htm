<P>IN the name of the blessed and Holy Trinity, I do desire thee, strong, and mighty angels (<I>here name the spirits you would have appear</I>) that if it be the divine will of him who is called Tetragrammaton, &amp;c. the holy God, the Father, that thou take upon thee some shape as best becometh thy celestial nature, and appear to us visibly here in this place, and answer our demands, in as far as we shall not transgress the bounds of the divine mercy and goodness,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A></P>
<P>by requesting unlawful knowledge; but that thou wilt graciously shew us what things are most profitable for us to know and do to the glory and honour of his divine Majesty who liveth and reigneth, world without end. Amen.</P>
<P>Lord thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven--make clean our hearts within us, and take not thy holy spirit from us. O Lord, by thy name we have called them, suffer them to administer unto us.</P>
<P>And that all things may work together for thy honour and glory, to whom with thee, the Son and blessed Spirit, be ascribed all might, majesty, and dominion world without end. <I>Amen</I>.</P>
