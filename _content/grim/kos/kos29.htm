<P>Figure 26.--The Second Pentacle of Mars.--This Pentacle serveth with great success against all kinds of diseases, if it be applied unto the afflicted part.</P>
<I><P>Editor's Note</I>.--The letter H&eacute;, in the angles of the Hexagram. Within the same the Names IHVH, IHSHVH Yeheshuah (the mystic Hebrew Name for Joshua or Jesus, formed of the ordinary IHVH with the letter SH placed therein as emblematical of the Spirit), and Elohim. Around it is the sentence, John i. 4:--'In Him was life, and the life was the light of man.' This may be adduced as an argument of the greater antiquity of the first few mystical verses of the Gospel of St. John.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">______________________</P>
<P>Figure 27.--The Third Pentacle of Mars.--It is of great value for exciting war, wrath, discord, and hostility; also for resisting enemies, and striking terror into rebellious Spirits; the Names of God the All Powerful are therein expressly marked.</P>
<I><P>Editor's Note</I>.--The Letters of the Names Eloah and Shaddai. In the Centre is the great letter Vau, the signature of the Qabalistic Microprosopus. Around is the versicle from Psalm lxxvii. 13:--'Who is so great a God as our Elohim?'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">______________________</P>
<P>Figure 28.--The Fourth Pentacle of Mars.--It is of great virtue and power in war, wherefore without doubt it will give thee victory.</P>
<I><P>Editor's Note</I>.--In the Centre is the great Name Agla; right and left, the letters of the Name IHVH; above and below, El. Round it is the versicle from Psalm cx. 5:--'The Lord at thy right hand shall wound even Kings in the day of His Wrath.'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">______________________</P>
<P>Figure 29.--The Fifth Pentacle of Mars.--Write thou this Pentacle upon virgin parchment or paper, because it is terrible unto the Demons,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A></P>
<P>and at its sight and aspect they will obey thee, for they cannot resist its presence.</P>
<I><P>Editor's Note</I>.--Around the figure of the Scorpion is the word HVL. The versicle is from Psalm xci. 13:--'Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder, the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.'</P>
