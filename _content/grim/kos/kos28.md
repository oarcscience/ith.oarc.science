# PLATE V.

<span id="img_kos05"></span> ![](img/kos05.jpg)  
PLATE V.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Figure 22.--The Fifth Pentacle of Jupiter.--This hath great power. It
serveth for assured visions. Jacob being armed with this Pentacle beheld
the ladder which reached unto heaven.

Editor's Note.--The Hebrew letters within the Pentacle are taken from
the five last words of the versicle which surrounds it, each of which
contains five letters. These are, then, recombined so as to form certain
Mystical Names. The versicle is taken from Ezekiel i. 1:--' As I was
among the captives by the river of Chebar, the heavens were opened, and
I saw visions of Elohim.' In my opinion the versicle should only consist
of the five last words thereof, when the anachronism of Jacob using a
Pentacle with a sentence from Ezekiel will no longer exist.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Figure 23.--The Sixth Pentacle of Jupiter.--It serveth for protection
against all earthly dangers, by regarding it each day devoutedly, and
repeating the versicle which surroundeth it. Thus shalt thou never
perish.

Editor's Note.--The four Names in the Arms of the Cross are Seraph,
Kerub, Ariel, and Tharsis; the four Rulers of the Elements. The versicle
is from Psalm xxii. 16, 17:-' They pierced my hands and my feet, I may
tell all my bones.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Figure 24.--The Seventh and last Pentacle of Jupiter.--It hath great
power against poverty, if thou considerest it with devotion, repeating
the versicle. It serveth furthermore to drive away those Spirits who
guard treasures, and to discover the same.

Editor's Note.--Mystical Characters of Jupiter with the verse:--'Lifting
up the poor out of the mire, and raising the needy from the dunghill,
that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
people.'--Psalm cxiii, 7.

### MARS.

Figure 25.--The first Pentacle of Mars.--It is proper for invoking
Spirits of the Nature of Mars, especially those which are written in the
Pentacle.

Editor's Note.--Mystical Characters of Mars, and the Names of the four
Angels:--Madimiel, Bartzachiah, Eschiel, and Ithuriel written in Hebrew
around the Pentacle.
