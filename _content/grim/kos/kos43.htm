<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF PLACES WHEREIN WE MAY CONVENIENTLY EXECUTE THE EXPERIMENTS AND OPERATIONS OF THE ART</H3>
<P>THE places best fitted for exercising and accomplishing Magical Arts and Operations are those which are concealed, removed, and separated from the habitations of men. Wherefore desolate and uninhabited regions are most appropriate, such as the borders of lakes, forests, dark and obscure places, old and deserted houses, whither rarely and scarce ever men do come, mountains, caves, caverns, grottos, gardens, orchards; but best. of all are cross-roads, and where four roads meet, during the depth and silence of night. But if thou canst not conveniently go unto any of these places, thy house, and even thine own chamber, or, indeed, any place, provided it hath been purified and consecrated with the necessary ceremonies, will be found fit and convenient for the convocation and assembling of the Spirits.</P>
<P>These Arts or Operations should be carried out at the prescribed time, but if there be no time specially appointed it will be always better to perform them at night, which is the most fit and proper time for the Operations of Necromancy; this is also a symbol that it is just and right to hide them from the sight of the foolish, the ignorant, and the profane.</P>
<P>But when thou shalt have selected a place fitting, thou mayest perform thine experiments by day or by night. It should be spacious, clear, and bounded on all sides by hedges, shrubs, trees, or walls. Thou shalt thyself cleanse it thoroughly and render it neat and pure, and while doing this thou shalt recite Psalms ii.; lxvii.; and liv.</P>
<P>After this thou shalt perfume it with the odours and suffumigations of the Art, and shalt sprinkle it with the water and the hyssop; and after this thou mayest in this place make all the necessary preparations for an operation.</P>
<P>But when, later on, thou shalt go unto th4 place, to complete and accomplish the operation, thou shalt repeat on the way thither the following Prayer in a low and distinct voice:--</P>
<P><A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE PRAYER.</H3>
<P>ZAZAII, ZAMAII, PUIDAMON Most Powerful, SEDON Most Strong, EL, YOD HE VAU HE, IAH, AGLA, assist me an unworthy sinner who have had the boldness to pronounce these Holy Names which no man should name and invoke save in very great danger. Therefore have I recourse unto these Most Holy Names, being in great peril both of soul and of body. Pardon me if I have sinned in any manner, for I trust in Thy protection alone, especially on this journey.</P>
<P>Let the Master as he goeth sprinkle the path with the water and hyssop of the Art, while each of his Disciples shall repeat in a low voice the Prayer which we have enjoined for the days of fasting and preparation.</P>
<P>Furthermore, let the Master appoint his Disciples to carry the things necessary for the Art.</P>
<P>The first shall bear the Censer, the Fire, and the Incense.</P>
<P>The Second; the Book, the Paper, the Pens, the Ink, and the various Perfumes.</P>
<P>The Third; the Knife, and the Sickle.</P>
<P>The Master; the Staff, and the Wand.</P>
<P>But if there be more Disciples present, the Master shall distribute the things for each to carry, according to their number.</P>
<P>When they shall have arrived at the place, and all things being disposed in their proper order, the Master shall take the Knife or other convenient consecrated Magical implement of Steel, wherewith to form the Circle of Art which he intends to construct. This being done, he must perfume it, and sprinkle it with water; and having warned and exhorted his Disciples, he shall work thus:--</P>
<P>First let him have a trumpet made of new wood, on the one side of which shall be written in Hebrew with the pen and ink of the Art these Names of God, ELOHIM GIBOR, ELOHIM TZABAOTH (<I>see <A HREF="kos44.htm#img_kos13">Figure 59</A></I>); and on the other side these characters (<I>see <A HREF="kos44.htm#img_kos13">Figure 60</A></I>).</P>
<P>Having entered into the Circle to perform the Experiment, he should sound this Trumpet towards the four quarters of the Universe, first towards the East, then towards the South, then towards the West, and lastly towards the North. Then let him say:--</P>
<P>Hear ye, and be ye ready, in whatever part of the Universe ye may be, to obey the Voice of God the Mighty One, and the Names of the Creator. We let you know by this signal and sound that ye will be convoked hither, wherefore hold ye yourselves in readiness to obey our commands.</P>
<P>This being done let the Master complete his work, renew the Circle, and make the incensements and fumigations.</P>
