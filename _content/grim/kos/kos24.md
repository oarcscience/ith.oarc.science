Editor's Note on [Figure 1](kos00.htm#img_kos01).--The Mystical Figure
of Solomon.--This is only given in the two MSS., Lansdowne 1202and 1203.
It was given by Lévi in his 'Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie,' and by
Tycho Brahé in his 'Calendarium Naturale Magicum,' but in each instance
without the Hebrew words and letters, probably berause these were so
mangled by illiterate transcribers as to be unrecognisable. After much
labour and study of the figure, I believe the words in the body of the
symbol to be intended for the Ten Sephiroth arranged in the form of the
Tree of Life, with the Name of Solomon to the right and to the left;
while the surrounding characters are intended for the twenty-two letters
of the Hebrew Alphabet. I have, therefore, thus restored them. This
Figure forms in each instance the frontispiece of the MS. referred to.
