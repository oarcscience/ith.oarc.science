<I><P>Editor's Note on <A HREF="kos00.htm#img_kos01">Figure 1</A></I>.--The Mystical Figure of Solomon.--This is only given in the two MSS., Lansdowne 1202and 1203. It was given by L&eacute;vi in his 'Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie,' and by Tycho Brah&eacute; in his 'Calendarium Naturale Magicum,' but in each instance without the Hebrew words and letters, probably berause these were so mangled by illiterate transcribers as to be unrecognisable. After much labour and study of the figure, I believe the words in the body of the symbol to be intended for the Ten Sephiroth arranged in the form of the Tree of Life, with the Name of Solomon to the right and to the left; while the surrounding characters are intended for the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew Alphabet. I have, therefore, thus restored them. This Figure forms in each instance the frontispiece of the MS. referred to.</P>
