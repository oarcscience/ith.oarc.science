<P ALIGN="CENTER">______________________</P>
<P>Figure 34.--The Third Pentacle of the Sun.--This serveth in addition (to the effects of the two preceding) to acquire Kingdom and Empire, to inflict loss, and to acquire renown and glory, especially through the Name of God, Tetragrammaton, which therein is twelve times contained.</P>
<I><P>Editor's Note</I>.--The Name IHVH, twelve times repeated; and a versicle somewhat similar to Daniel iv. 34:--'My Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and my dominion endureth from age unto age.'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">______________________</P>
<P>Figure 35.--The Fourth Pentacle of the Sun.--This serveth to enable thee to see the Spirits when they appear invisible unto those who invoke them; because, when thou hast uncovered it, they will immediately appear visible.</P>
<I><P>Editor's Note</I>.--The Names IHVH, Adonai, are written in the centre in Hebrew; and round the radii in the mystical characters of the 'Passing of the River.' The versicle is from Psalm xiii. 3, 4:--'Lighten mine eyes that I sleep not in death, lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him.'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">______________________</P>
<P>Figure 36.--The Fifth Pentacle of the Sun.--It serveth to invoke those Spirits who can transport thee from one place unto another, over a long distance and in short time.</P>
<I><P>Editor's Note</I>.--Characters in the 'Passing of the River' Alphabet, forming Spirits' Names. The versicle is from Psalm xci. 11, 12:--'He shall give His Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands.'</P>
<P><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></P>
<P>Figure 37.--The Sixth Pentacle of the Sun.--It serveth excellently for the operation of invisibility, when correctly made.</P>
<I><P>Editor's Note</I>.--In the centre is the Mystical letter Yod, in the Celestial Alphabet. The three letters in the 'Passing of the River' writing, in the Angles of the triangle, form the great Name Shadda&iuml;. The words in the same characters round its three sides are, in my opinion, from Genesis 1. 1:--'In the beginning the Elohim created,' etc.; but the characters are sadly mangled in the MSS. The versicle is from Psalms lxix. 23, and cxxxv. 16:--'Let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake. They have eyes and see not.'</P>
