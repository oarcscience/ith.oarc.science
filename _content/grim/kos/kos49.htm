<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CONCERNING&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> THE PRECEPTS OF THE ART</H3>
<P>HE who hath attained the rank or degree of Exorcist, which we are usually accustomed to call Magus or Master according to grade, whensoever he desireth to undertake any operation, for the nine days immediately preceding the commencement of the work, should put aside from him all uncleanness, and prepare himself in secret during these days, and prepare all the things necessary, and in the space of these days all these should be made, consecrated, and exorcised.</P>
<P>The which being duly completed, let him go on the day and hour of the commencement of the work, unto the place set apart for the same, as hath been said, in the place concerning the formation of the Circle. Let him instruct his Disciples on no cause whatsoever to move from their assigned places. And the Magus should exhort them with a bold and confident voice as follows:--</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE EXHORTATION OF THE COMPANIONS.</H3>
<P>Fear ye not, my beloved Companions, seeing that we draw near unto the desired end; therefore, all things being rightly done and the Conjurations and Exorcisms diligently performed, ye shall behold Kings of Kings, and Emperors of Emperors, and other Kings, Princes, and Majesties with them, and a great crowd of followers, together with all sorts of musical instruments, yet nothing should either the Magus or his Disciples fear.</P>
<P>And then let the Magus say:--</P>
<P>I exhort you by these Holy Names of God, ELOHIM, ADONAI, AGLA, that none of you now presume to move or cross over from your appointed stations.</P>
<P>This being said, let the Magus and his Disciples uncover the Holy Pentacles and show them towards each quarter, and they being shown in each place, there shall be noises and rushings.</P>
<P>Then shall the Emperor of (the Spirits) say unto you:--From the</P>

<P>time of the Great Addus until now, there hath not been an Exorciser who could behold my person, and unless those things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> which ye have showed unto us had been made, ye would not now have seen me. But seeing that ye have powerfully called us, as I believe, by the rites derived from Solomon, and which but few of your comrades, or Exorcisers, possess, also they compel us against our will, and I therefore say unto thee that we wish to be obedient in all matters.</P>
<P>Then shall the Magus place the petitions of himself and his companions, which should be written down clearly on virgin card, or paper, beyond the Circle towards the King or Prince of the Spirits, and he will receive it and take counsel with his Chiefs. After this he will return the Card, saying:--That which thou desirest is accomplished, be thy will performed, and all thy demands fulfilled.</P>
