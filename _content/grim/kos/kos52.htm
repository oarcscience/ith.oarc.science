<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE BLOOD OF THE BAT, PIGEON, AND OTHER ANIMALS</H3>
<P>TAKE a living Bat and exorcise it thus:--</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE EXORCISM OF THE BAT.</H3>
<P>CAMIACH, EOMIAHE, EMIAL, MACBAL, EMOII, ZAZEAN, MAIPHIAT, ZACRATH,TENDAC, VULAMAHI; by these Most Holy Names, and the other Names of Angels which are written in the Book ASSAMAIAN,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I conjure thee O Bat (or whatever animal it may be) that thou assist me in this operation, by God the True, God the Holy, the God Who hath created thee, and by Adam, Who hath imposed thy true name upon thee and upon all other animated beings.</P>
<P>After this, take the Needle or other convenient Instrument of Art, as will be said later on, and pierce the bat in the vein which is in the right wing; and collect the blood in a small vessel over the which thou shalt say:--</P>
<P>Almighty ADONAI, ARATHRON, ASHAI, ELOHIM, ELOHI, ELION, ASHER EHEIEH, SHADDAI, O God the Lord, immaculate, immutable, EMANUEL, MESSIACH, YOD, HE, VAU, HE, be my aid, so that this blood may have power and efficacy in all wherein I shall wish, and in all that I shall demand.</P>
<P>Perfume it and keep it for use.</P>
<P>The blood of other winged animals may be taken in the same manner, with the proper solemnities.</P>
<I><P>Note by Editor</I>.--I cannot too strongly impress on the readers of this volume that the use of blood is more or less connected with Black Magic and that it should be avoided as much as possible.</P>
