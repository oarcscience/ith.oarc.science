## CHAPTER XV

### OF THE PEN OF THE SWALLOW AND OF THE CROW

TAKE the feather of a Swallow or of a Crow, and before plucking it thou
shalt say:--

May Holy MICHAEL the Archangel of God, and MIDAEL and MIRAEL, the Chiefs
and Captains of the Celestial Army, be my aid in the operation I am
about to perform, so that I may write herewith all things which are
necessary, and that all the experiments which I commence herewith may
through you and through your Names be perfected by the power of the Most
High Creator. Amen.

After this thou shalt point and complete the pen with the Knife of the
Art, and with the pen and ink of the Art thou shalt write upon its side
the Name, ANAIRETON (*see [Figure 86](kos44.htm#img_kos14)*), and thou
shalt say over it the following Psalms: cxxxiii.; cxvii.
