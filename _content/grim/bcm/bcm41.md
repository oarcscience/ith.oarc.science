### § 5. Concerning the External Preparation of the Operator, and secondly Concerning the Vestments

The use of special garments in the ceremonies of Magic follows
reasonably enough from the religious character ascribed to these
operations. Peter de Abano recommends a priest's garment if possible, by
which an alb may be understood. <span id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_84)

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *The Book of Black Magic*, following the *Key of
Solomon*, and representing the Jewish rite, prescribes an outer vestment
like that of the Levites, with the following characters embroidered in
red silk upon the breast:--

All garments, even to the shirt, must be of linen cloth, <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85) and when assuming them these words should
be recited: ANTON, AMATOR, EMITES, THEODONIEL, PONCOR, PAGOR,
ANITOR; <span id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_86) *by the virtue of these most
holy Angelic Names do I clothe myself, O Lord, in my Sabbath garments,
that so I may fulfil, even unto their term, all things which I desire to
effect through Thee, Most Holy ADONAY, Whose kingdom and rule endure for
ever and ever. Amen*.

The shoes and hat should be of white leather, bearing the same
characters <span id="fr_87"></span>[3](#fn_87) written in cinnabar
diluted with gum-water, the pen of the Art being used. The following
names must be written about the hat: <span id="fr_88"></span>[4](#fn_88)
JEHOVA, behind; ADONAY, on the right hand; ELOY, on the left; and
GIBOR, <span id="fr_89"></span>[5](#fn_89) at the front.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_84"></span>[148:2](bcm41.htm#fr_84) A long garment of white
linen, close before and behind, covering the whole body even to the
feet, and cinctured by a girdle--such is the ordinance of
pseudo-Agrippa.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[149:1](bcm41.htm#fr_85) According to the *Key
of Solomon* the thread of which they are made should be spun by a young
maiden.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[149:2](bcm41.htm#fr_86) The Key of Solomon
renders these names differently, namely: *Amor, Amator, Amides,
Ideodaniach, Pamor, Plaior, Anitor*; for Sabbath garments it substitutes
Vestments of Power.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[149:3](bcm41.htm#fr_87) Special characters are
given for the garment and the shoes by the *Clavicle*. They bear no
analogy to anything in the Grimoire.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[149:4](bcm41.htm#fr_88) For the hat or bonnet a
crown is prescribed in the *Clavicle*, and it should be made of virgin
paper.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[149:5](bcm41.htm#fr_89) In place of these words
the *Key of Solomon* substitutes *El* and *Elohim*.
