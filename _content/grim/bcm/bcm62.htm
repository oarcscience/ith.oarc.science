<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Concerning the Mystery of the Sanctum Regnum, or the Government of Evil Spirits; being the Rite of Conjuration according to the Grimorium Verum</H3>
<P>TH E preparations of the operator prescribed by the Grimorium Verum are fully represented in the earlier chapters, but they may be summed here as follows: 1. An austere fast of three days; 2. Retreat or isolation from human society; 3. Abstinence from sexual intercourse; 4. The recitation of certain prayers and the performance of certain ablutions; 5. The composition of the required instruments. He must further devote himself to the invocations, lest memory fail him at the moment set apart for the work, and to insure mastery of the practice. He should also recite the following prayer daily&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--at Prime once, at Tierce twice, at Sext three times, at Nones four times, at Vespers five times, and six times before going to rest. It is explained that these hours are planetary and unequal.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Prime is reckoned at the rising of the sun, Tierce at three hours after, Sext at mid-day, Nones at three in the afternoon and Vespers at sunset.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">PRAYER</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>ASTRACHIOS, ASACH, ASARCA, ABEDUMABAL, SILAT, ANABOTAS, JESUBILIN, SCIGIN, GENEON, DOMOL, Lord God, <I>Who dwellest above the heavens, Whose glance searchest the abyss,. grant me, I pray Thee, the power to conceive in my mind and to execute that which I desire to do, the end of which I would attain by Thy help, O God Almighty, Who livest and reignest for ever and ever. Amen</I>.</P>
<P>These things being done, says the Grimoire, it remains only to follow the invocations and to compose the characters, to which end the operator shall proceed as follows:--On the day and in the hour of Mars, the Moon waxing, and at the first hour of the day, which begins automatically fifteen minutes before the rising of the Sun, a piece of virgin parchment must be prepared, containing all the characters and invocations of the spirits on whom it is desired to call. On the day and in the hour aforesaid let the operator bind the little finger of the (left) hand, which is the finger of Mercury, with a thread woven by a virgin girl; let him pierce that finger with the lancet of the Art, so as to draw blood, and form therewith the character of <I>Scirlin</I>, from whom all other spirits depend, since he is their messenger and can compel them to appear despite themselves, because he has the power of the Emperor to him deputed. His invocation, which must be written, is as follows:--</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE INVOCATION OF SCIRLIN</P>
<P>HELON &#10016, TAUL &#10016, VARF &#10016, PAN &#10016, HEON &#10016, HOMONOREUM &#10016, CLEMIALH &#10016, SERUGEATH &#10016, AGLA &#10016, TETRAGRAMMATON &#10016, CASOLY &#10016.</P>
<P>With the confusion so common in the Grimoires, the character of <I>Scirlin</I> is not given, whence the operator who followed the instructions of this Ritual must have had recourse to one of the superior spirits. The instructions, however, are not described <I>ad clerum</I>, and it is scarcely possible to extract from them an intelligible method of procedure. The name and surname of the operator must apparently be written below the character of the spirit, following a prescribed manner, which is also omitted; the conjuration of the spirit must be added and incense burnt in his honour.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CONJURATION TO LUCIFER</P>
<P>LUCIFER &#10016, OUYAR &#10016, CHAMERON &#10016, ALISEON &#10016, MANDOUSIN &#10016, PREMY &#10016, ORIET &#10016, NAYDRUS &#10016, ESMONY &#10016, EPARINESONT &#10016, ESTIOT &#10016, DUMOSSON &#10016, DANOCHAR &#10016, CASMIEL &#10016, HAYRAS &#10016, FABELLERONTHON &#10016, SODIRNO &#10016, PEATHAM &#10016, <I>Come</I> &#10016, LUCIFER &#10016.

AMEN.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_239"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 239</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CONJURATION FOR ASTAROTH</P>

AMEN.</P>
<P>Having repeated seven times the conjuration addressed to one of these superior spirits, the same will forthwith manifest to perform whatsoever shall be desired. NOTE.--Such conjuration must have been written on virgin paper or parchment before invoking the spirits. These, having been satisfied, may be dismissed by using the following</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DISCHARGE</P>
<P>Go in peace unto your places; may peace be with you, and be ye ready to come whensoever I shall call upon you, In the Name of the Father &#10016 and of the Son &#10016 and of the Holy Ghost &#10016. Amen.</P>

<P>The name of the required spirit must here be added on the parchment, when he will duly appear-the ordinary accidents excepted--and will grant what is desired of him--that is to say, if it so happen--after which he may be dismissed by the previous Discharge.</P>
<P>The characters should be burnt in each case, as they avail once only.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">ANOTHER CONJURATION</P>
<P>I conjure thee, N., by the great living God, the Sovereign Creator of all things, to appear under a comely human form, without noise and without terror, to answer truly unto all questions that I shall ask thee. Hereunto I conjure thee by the virtue of these Holy and Sacred Names</I>.</P>
