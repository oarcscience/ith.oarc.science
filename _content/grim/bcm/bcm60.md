THE SEAL OF VAPULA

LX\. VAPULA, a strong duke, comes in the form of a lion with griffin's
wings. He gives skill not only in manual professions but also in
philosophy and the sciences contained in books--I suppose, as
distinguished from the secret sciences.

THE SEAL OF ZAGAN

LXI\. ZAGAN, a great king and president, appears at first in the form of
a bull, with the wings of a griffin, but after in human shape. He makes
men witty, turns water into wine, blood into oil and oil into
water; <span id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_239) he can change any metal
into coin of the realm and can make fools wise.

THE SEAL OF VALAC

LXII\. VALAC, a great president, comes as a little boy with the wings of
an angel and riding on a two-headed dragon. He gives true answers
concerning hidden treasures, tells where serpents may be seen and will
deliver them helpless to the exorcist.

LXIII\. ANDRAS, a great marquis, comes in the form of an angel, with the
head of a black night-raven, riding upon a strong black wolf and having
a sharp bright sword gleaming in his hands. He sows discord and will
kill the unwary. <span id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_240)

LXIV\. FLAUROS, a great duke, appears at first like a terrible leopard,
but at the command of the exorcist he puts on the shape of a man, with
fiery eyes and terrible countenance. He gives true answers of things
past, present and future, but unless commanded into the triangle he will
deceive the exorcist. He converses gladly of divinity and the creation
of the world, as also of the fall of spirits, his own included. If
desired, he will destroy and burn the enemies of the operator, nor will
he suffer him to be tempted, by spirits or otherwise.

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

LXV\. ANDREALPHUS, a mighty marquis, appears at first in the form of a
peacock, with a great noise, but after puts on human shape. He teaches
geometry perfectly and all that belongs to measurements, astronomy
included. He can transform men into the likeness of a bird.

LXVI\. CIMERIES, a powerful marquis, appears like a valiant soldier on a
black horse. He rules the spirits in the parts of Africa; he teaches
grammar, logic and rhetoric, discovers buried treasures and things lost
and hidden; he can make a man appear like a soldier of his own kind.

THE SEAL OF AMDUSCIAS

LXVII\. AMDUSCIAS, a great duke, comes first like an unicorn, but will
stand up at request in human shape, causing all manner of musical
instruments to be heard but not seen. He makes trees fall at the will of
the operator and gives excellent familiars.

LXVIII\. BELIAL, a mighty king, created next after Lucifer, appears in
the form of a beautiful angel, seated in a chariot

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

of fire and speaking with a pleasant voice. He fell first amongst the
superior angels who went before Michael and other heavenly angels. He
distributes preferences for senatorships,

causes favours of friends and foes and gives excellent familiars. He
must have offerings and sacrifices made to him. <span

THE SEAL OF DECARABIA

LXIX\. DECARABIA, a marquis, comes in the form of a star in a pentacle,
but puts on the image of man at command. He discovers the virtues of
herbs and precious stones, makes birds seem to fly before the exorcist
and remain with him as familiars, singing and eating like other birds.

THE SEAL OF SEERE

LXX\. SEERE, a mighty prince under Amaymon, King of the East, appears in
the form of a beautiful man on a strong, winged horse. He brings all
things to pass suddenly, transports to any place in the twinkling of an
eye and discovers all thefts. He is indifferently good or bad, and will
do the will of the operator.

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

LXXI\. DANTALIAN, a mighty duke, appears in the form of a man with many
faces of men and women; he has a book in his right hand. He teaches all
arts and sciences, declares all secret counsels, for he knows all human
thoughts and can change them at his will. He kindles love and shews the
similitude of any person in a vision, wheresoever they may be.

LXXII\. ANDROMALIUS, a great duke and earl, appears in the form of a man
holding a serpent in his hand. He returns stolen goods, reveals the
thief, discovers all wickedness and underhand dealing, as also hidden
treasures.

Such are the prime mysteries of *Goëtia* according to the tradition of
the *Lemegeton*; such is the work which has been described in the
interest of White Magic as distinct from the *Key of Solomon*, but
highly important and valuable in its own department. <span
id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_242) Viewed in the light of these
two-and-seventy methods of accomplishing all abominations, it would seem
that the three "analogical realms of occult philosophy" are the three
kingdoms which we have known under other names from our childhood--as
"the world, the flesh and the devil." It

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

will be unnecessary after their enumeration to argue any longer upon the
distinction between Black and White Magic as it appears in one of the
oldest and best of the Rituals. There is no longer any need to inquire
whether the operator is saved by his intention, for we are acquainted
with the nature of the intentions which govern procedure in one of the
most reputable memorials of White Magic which is now extant. The
evocation of Lucifer and Astaroth, whatever the pretext, must be

THE TRIANGLE OF SOLOMON

the first step towards Satanism; but here we have Satanism undiluted,
*plus* all the mysteries of the impure Venus. To dismiss, therefore, the
definition which no longer perplexes, let us establish that the
distinction between White and Black Magic is the distinction between the
*Lemegeton* and the *Grimoire of Honorius*,--in other words, between
cipher and zero.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_239"></span>[215:1](bcm60.htm#fr_240) Otherwise, wine into
water or into blood.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[216:1](bcm60.htm#fr_241) Another codex says
frankly that be can kill the Master and all his Assistants.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[218:1](bcm60.htm#fr_242) He is partly of the
Order of the Virtues and partly of that of the Angels. Unless he be
constrained by Divine Power, he will not remain one hour in the truth.
He was one of the vast cohort shut up by Solomon in a brazen vessel and
released subsequently by the Babylonians.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[219:1](bcm60.htm#fr_243) That is the
discriminating judgment of Mr. Mathers, who forbears, however, to
specify. I do think that the *Lemegeton* is very curious and in this
sense important, but not for the reasons which actuated Mr. Mathers
presumably.
