### § 5. Concerning Virgin Wax or Virgin Earth <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_123)

The candles used in evocation or in other magical experiences, and the
images required for bewitchment, must be composed of virgin wax or
virgin earth--that is to say, the substances in question must not have
been applied previously to another purpose. <span
id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_124) Before operating the following words
must be recited over the material:--ENTABOR, NATABOR, *Si tacibor*,
ADONAY, AN, LAYAMON, TINARMES, EOS PHILODES. <span
id="fr_126"></span>[3](#fn_125) *Angels Of God, be ye present! I invoke
you in my work, that I may obtain virtue by your mediation and may be
perfected very surely*. Then recite the Psalms *Domine, non est
exaltatum cor meum and Domine, quis habitabit*, <span
id="fr_127"></span>[4](#fn_126) adding these words: *I exorcise thee,
creature of wax* \[*or earth*\], *and, by the Creator and God Almighty,
Who created all things from nothing by His Most Holy Name, and by His
angels, I ordain thee to receive virtue and benediction in His Name,
that so thou mayst be sanctified and blessed, thus obtaining that virtue
which we desire, by the Most Holy Name* ADONAY*, which is the life of
all creatures, Amen*. Asperge the substance with the holy water of the
Art, after which preserve it, to make use thereof when needed. So doing,
says *True Black Magic*, thou shalt obtain a sure result in all which
thou undertakest. <span id="fr_128"></span>[5](#fn_127)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_123"></span>[168:1](bcm46.htm#fr_124) This process is
adapted from the *Key of Solomon*, Book ii. c. 8.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[168:2](bcm46.htm#fr_125) The virginity of the
wax and the earth is more perfectly ensured by the directions of the
*Key of Solomon*, in accordance with which the operator must dig up the
earth with his own hands and reduce it to a paste, using no instrument
in case of defilement. The wax must be taken from bees who have made it
for the first time.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[168:3](bcm46.htm#fr_126) These names differ
from those in the *Key of Solomon*, which, however, are, for the most
part, equally unintelligible.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[168:4](bcm46.htm#fr_127) Ps. cxxx. and Ps.
xiv. in the Vulgate.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[168:5](bcm46.htm#fr_128) The *Key of Solomon*
directs that the earth should be freshly dug up on each occasion that it
is required.
