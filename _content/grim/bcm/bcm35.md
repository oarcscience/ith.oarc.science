<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

greyish-white satin, shaded. It may be worn in any manner, and the words
are: OSTHARIMAN, VISANTIPAROS, NOCTATUR.

XX\. Gives the knowledge of the counsels of Infernus and the means of
rendering its projects abortive, but whether for the ultimate health and
weal of the operator's soul there is no guarantee offered. The talisman
is of red satin, with the centre embroidered in gold, the border in
silver and the figures in black and white silk. It should be worn upon
the breast and the ring on the first joint of the little finger of the
left hand. The words are: ACTATOS, CATIPTA, BEJOURAN, ITAPAN, MARNUTUS.

The range of human ambition recognised by Ceremonial Magic being always
somewhat restricted, it is not surprising that the offices of these
talismans frequently overlap one another, or that some of them
correspond very closely to the powers ascribed to the Magus by the
transcendental science of the *Arbatel*. The talismans are preceded in
the original by the figure of a magical rod, stained, says the
letterpress which accompanies it, with the blood of a lamb and having
the form of a serpent. The description is somewhat obscure, but the

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

wand must be apparently flexible, so that it can be bent at need, and
the mouth and tail joined by means of a golden chain, thus forming a
circle. It will be observed that it is the old symbol, the great and
mystic symbol, but in what strange company has it fallen! The wand
should be six feet long and when bent can be used as a circle of
evocation. There is also a figure of the grand magical circle, but it is
not described in the text. There are thus twenty-two figures in all, and
the inclusion of the word TAROT in the list of evoking terms is not
without significance in this connection. A certain correspondence
between the talismans and the Tarot Trumps is indeed unmistakable, at
least in some instances, and seems to indicate that the work has a more
definite occult aspect than would appear at first sight. It is the
symbolism of the Trumps Major redirected towards the Powers of the Deep.
