<P>The name &quot;Grimoire&quot; is derived from the word &quot;Grammar&quot;.
A grammar is a description of a set of symbols and how to combine them
to create well-formed sentences.
A Grimoire is, appropriately enough,
a description of a set of magickal symbols and how to
combine them properly.
Most of the texts linked below are descriptions of traditional European
ritual magick, which is based on Judeo-Christianity.
Even though this must not be confused with neo-Paganism, many of the
neo-Pagan traditions use similar rituals and techniques, albeit with
a different (usually Celtic) vocabulary.

 &emsp; <span class="c_b">Two very mysterious grimoires.</span>
These two grimoires (originating from the same book)
are often cited as being used by Vodun/Obeah practitioners.
Although they claim to be Kabbalistic
in nature, there is very little if any actual Kabbalah to be found in them.
Rather this appears to be a traditional ritual magick system
with incantations to summon and dismiss spirits to achieve worldly ends.
Published in 1849, and translated into English in 1880,
the <I>6th and 7th Books of Moses</I> claim to include material from 
1338, 1383 and 1501, including portions reputedly translated from the
&quot;Cuthan-Samaritan&quot; language, which has been extinct since the
12th Century A.D., and about which very little is known.
The most interesting aspects of this book are the unique illustrations of 
magickal seals, with letters in Hebrew and an unknown script; and the
lists of names of demonic entities.
Note: the images in this grimoire were originally printed in the 19th
Century using very primitive printing technology.
To prepare them for publication on the Internet, they were
scanned from the best source available and then image-processed to
bring out details.  Unfortunately some of these plates have illegible portions.
Note: the first five books of Moses are the traditionally the
first five books of the Bible.

translated by <span class="c_a">S. Liddell MacGregor Mathers</span> [<span class="c_d">1888</span>] &emsp; <span class="c_b">The key to modern ceremonial magic.</span>
Although the author of this grimoire
was traditionally the biblical King Solomon,
it was probably written in the 13th Century A.D.
It was translated by S. Liddell MacGregor
Mathers in 1888; Mathers subsequently had a lot of influence in the
Golden Dawn movement, one of the sources of modern ritual magic; it
is said that he co-wrote its rituals with W.B. Yeats.  Mathers also
translated the <A HREF="../jud/tku/index.htm">Kabbalah</A>.

In spite of the name, Pow-wow is not a Native American tradition,

After nearly dying out it has experienced a small revival in recent years.
