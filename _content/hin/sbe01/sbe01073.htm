<p>1. The chest which has the sky for its circumference and the earth for its bottom, does not decay, for the quarters are its sides, and heaven its lid above. That chest is a treasury, and all things are within it.</p>  
<p>2. Its eastern quarter is called <I>G</I>uh&ucirc;, its southern Saham&acirc;n&acirc;, its western R&acirc;<I>g</I>&ntilde;&icirc;, its northern Subh&ucirc;t&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The child of those quarters is V&acirc;yu, the air, and he who knows that the air is indeed the child of the quarters, never weeps for his sons.

<P><A NAME="fn_182"></A><A HREF="sbe01073.htm#fr_183">49:1</A> The object of this section, the Ko<I>s</I>avi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na, is to show how the promise made in III, 13, 6, 'that a strong son should be born in a man's family,' is to be fulfilled.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_183"></A><A HREF="sbe01073.htm#fr_184">49:2</A> These names are explained by the commentator as follows: Because people offer libations (<I>g</I>uhvati), turning to the east, therefore it is called <I>G</I>uh&ucirc;. Because evil doers suffer (sahante) in the town of Yama, which is in the south, therefore it is called Saham&acirc;n&acirc;. The western quarter is called R&acirc;<I>g</I>&ntilde;&icirc;, either because it is sacred to king Varu<I>n</I>a (r&acirc;<I>g</I>an), or on account of the red colour (r&acirc;<I>g</I>a) of the twilight. The north is called Subh&ucirc;t&acirc;, because wealthy beings (bh&ucirc;timat), like Kuvera &amp;c., reside there.</P>
