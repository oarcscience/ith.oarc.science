<p>1. Man is sacrifice. His (first) twenty-four years are the morning-libation. The G&acirc;yatr&icirc; has twenty-four syllables, the morning-libation is offered with G&acirc;yatr&icirc; hymns. The Vasus are connected with that part of the sacrifice. The Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as (the five senses) are the Vasus, for they make all this to abide (v&acirc;sayanti).</p>  
<p>2. If anything ails him in that (early) age, let him say: 'Ye Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as, ye Vasus, extend this my morning-libation unto the midday-libation, that I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as or Vasus.' Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.</p>  
<p>3. The next forty-four years are the midday-libation. The Trish<I>t</I>ubh has forty-four syllables, the midday-libation is offered with Trish<I>t</I>ubh hymns. The Rudras are connected with that part of it. The Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as are the Rudras, for they make all this to cry (rodayanti).</p>  
<p>4. If anything ails him in that (second) age, let him say: 'Ye Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as, ye Rudras, extend this my midday-libation unto the third libation, that I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as or Rudras.' Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.</p>  
<p>5. The next forty-eight years are the third</p>

<p>libation. The <I>G</I>agat&icirc; has forty-eight syllables, the third libation is offered with <I>G</I>agat&icirc; hymns. The &Acirc;dityas are connected with that part of it. The Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as are the &Acirc;dityas, for they take up all this (&acirc;dadate).</p>  
<p>6. If anything ails him in that (third) age, let him say: 'Ye Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as, ye &Acirc;dityas, extend this my third libation unto the full age, that I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as or &Acirc;dityas.' Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.</p>  
<p>7. Mahid&acirc;sa Aitareya (the son of Itar&acirc;), who knew this, said (addressing a disease): 'Why dost thou afflict me, as I shall not die by it?' He lived a hundred and sixteen years (i.e. 24+44+48). He, too, who knows this lives on to a hundred and sixteen years.</p>
