<p>THE Kaush&icirc;taki-upanishad, or, as it is more properly called, the Kaush&icirc;taki-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a-upanishad, belongs, like the Aitareya-upanishad, to the followers of the Rig-veda. It was translated into Persian under the title of Kokhenk, and has been published in the Bibliotheca Indica, with <I>S</I>a&#7749;kar&acirc;nanda's commentary and an excellent translation by Professor Cowell.</p>  
<p>Though it is called the Kaush&icirc;taki-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a-upanishad, it does not form part of the Kaush&icirc;taki-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a in 30 adhy&acirc;yas which we possess, and we must therefore account for its name by admitting that the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, of which it formed a portion, could be reckoned as part of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a literature of the Rig-veda (see Aitareya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, Introduction, p. xcii), and that hence the Upanishad might be called the Upanishad of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the Kaush&icirc;takins&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>From a commentary discovered by Professor Cowell it appears that the four adhy&acirc;yas of this Upanishad</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xcix"><font size="1" color="green">p. xcix</font></A></p>  
<p>were followed by five other adhy&acirc;yas, answering, so far as we can judge from a few extracts, to some of the adhy&acirc;yas of the Aitareya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, while an imperfect MS. of an &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka in the Royal Library at Berlin (Weber, Catalogue, p.20) begins, like the Aitareya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, with a description of the Mah&acirc;vrata, followed by discussions on the uktha in the second adhy&acirc;ya; and then proceeds in the third adhy&acirc;ya to give the story of <I>K</I>itra G&acirc;&#7749;gy&acirc;yani in the same words as the Kaush&icirc;taki-upanishad in the first adhy&acirc;ya. Other MSS. again adopt different divisions. In one MS. of the commentary (MS. A), the four adhy&acirc;yas of the Upanishad are counted as sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth (ending with ity&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yake navamo 'dhy&acirc;ya<I>h</I>); in another (MS. P) the third and fourth adhy&acirc;yas of the Upanishad are quoted as the fifth and sixth of the Kaush&icirc;taky&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, possibly agreeing therefore, to a certain extent, with the Berlin MS. In a MS. of the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka in the Royal Library at Berlin, there are 15 adhy&acirc;yas, 1 and 2 corresponding to Ait. &Acirc;r. 1 and 5; 3-6 containing the Kaush&icirc;taki-upanishad; 7 and 8 corresponding to Ait. &Acirc;r. 3&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Poley seems to have known a MS. in which the four adhy&acirc;yas of the Upanishad formed the first, seventh, eighth, and ninth adhy&acirc;yas of a Kaush&icirc;taki-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>As there were various recensions of the Kaush&icirc;taki-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana, Kauthuma, &amp;c.), the Upanishad also exists in at least two texts. The commentator, in some of its MSS., refers to the various readings of the <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s, explaining them, whenever there seems to be occasion for it. I have generally followed the text which is presupposed by <I>S</I>a&#7749;kar&acirc;nanda's D&icirc;pik&acirc;, and contained in MSS. F, G (Cowell, Preface, p. v), so far as regards the third and fourth adhy&acirc;yas. According to Professor Cowell, Vidy&acirc;ranya in his Sarvopanishadarth&acirc;nubh&ucirc;tiprak&acirc;<I>s</I>a followed the text of the commentary, while Sankar&acirc;k&acirc;rya, if we may trust to extracts in his commentary on the Ved&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tras, followed the other text, contained in MS. A (Cowell, Preface, p. v).</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_c"><font size="1" color="green">p. c</font></A></p>  
<p>The style of the commentator differs in so marked a manner from that of <I>S</I>a&#7749;kar&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya, that even without the fact that the author of the commentary on the Kaush&icirc;taki-upanishad is called <I>S</I>a&#7749;kar&acirc;nanda, it would have been difficult to ascribe it, as has been done by some scholars, to the famous <I>S</I>a&#7749;kar&acirc;nanda. <I>S</I>a&#7749;kar&acirc;nanda is called the teacher of M&acirc;dhav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya (Hall, Index, p. 98), and the disciple of &Acirc;nand&acirc;tma Muni (Hall, Index, p. 116).</p>  
<p>I have had the great advantage of being able to consult for the Kaush&icirc;taki-upanishad, not only the text and commentary as edited by Professor Cowell, but also his excellent translation. If I differ from him in some points, this is but natural, considering the character of the text and the many difficulties that have still to be solved, before we can hope to arrive at a full understanding of these ancient philosophical treatises.</p>
