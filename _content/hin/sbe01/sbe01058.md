### TWENTY-FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. The teachers of Brahman (Veda) declare, as the Prâta*h*-savana
(morning-oblation) belongs to the Vasus, the Mâdhyandina-savana
(noon-libation) to

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

the Rudras, the third Savana (evening-libation) to the Âdityas and the
Vi*s*ve Devas,

2\. Where then is the world of the sacrificer? He who does not know
this, how can he perform the sacrifice? He only who knows, should
perform it <span id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_157).

3\. Before the beginning of the Prâtaranuvâka, (matin-chant), the
sacrificer, sitting down behind the household altar (gârhapatya), and
looking towards the north, sings the Sâman, addressed to the Vasus:

4\. 'Open the door of the world (the earth), let us see thee, that we
may rule (on earth).'

5\. Then he sacrifices, saying: 'Adoration to Agni, who dwells on the
earth, who dwells in the world! Obtain that world for me, the
sacrificer! That is the world for the sacrificer!'

6\. 'I (the sacrificer) shall go thither, when this life is over. Take
this! (he says, in offering the libation.) Cast back the bolt!' Having
said this, he rises. For him the Vasus fulfil the morning-oblation.

7\. Before the beginning of the Mâdhyandina-savana, the noon-oblation,
the sacrificer, sitting down behind the Âgnidhrîya altar, and looking
towards the north, sings the Sâman, addressed to the Rudras:

8\. 'Open the door of the world (the sky), let us see thee, that we may
rule wide (in the sky).'

9\. Then he sacrifices, saying: 'Adoration to

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vâyu (air), who
dwells in the sky, who dwells in the world. Obtain that world for me,
the sacrificer! That is the world for the sacrificer!'

10\. 'I (the sacrificer) shall go thither, when this life is over. Take
this! Cast back the bolt!' Having said this, he rises. For him the
Rudras fulfil the noon-oblation.

11\. Before the beginning of the third oblation, the sacrificer, sitting
down behind the Âhavanîya altar, and looking towards the north, sings
the Sâman, addressed to the Âdityas and Vi*s*ve Devas:

12\. 'Open the door of the world (the heaven), let us see thee, that we
may rule supreme (in heaven).' This is addressed to the Âdityas.

13\. Next the Sâman addressed to the Vi*s*ve Devas: 'Open the door of
the world (heaven), let us see thee, that we may rule supreme (in
heaven).'

14\. Then he sacrifices, saying: 'Adoration to the Âdityas and to the
Vi*s*ve Devas, who dwell in heaven, who dwell in the world. Obtain that
world for me, the sacrificer!'

15\. 'That is the world for the sacrificer! I (the sacrificer) shall go
thither, when this life is over. Take this! Cast back the bolt!' Having
said this, he rises.

16\. For him the Âdityas and the Vi*s*ve Devas fulfil the third
oblation. He who knows this, knows the full measure of the sacrifice,
yea, he knows it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_157"></span>[36:1](sbe01058.htm#fr_158) The commentator is
always very anxious to explain that though it is better that a priest
should know the hidden meaning of the sacrificial acts which he has to
perform, yet there is nothing to prevent a priest, who has not yet
arrived at this stage of knowledge, from performing his duties.
