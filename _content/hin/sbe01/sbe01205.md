### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Brahman (in the shape of prâ*n*a, breath) entered into that man by
the tips of his feet, and because Brahman entered (prâpadyata) into that
man by the tips of his feet, therefore people call them the tips of the
feet (prapada), but hoofs and claws in other animals.

2\. Then Brahman crept up higher, and therefore they were (called) <span
id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_509) the thighs (ûrû).

3\. Then he said: 'Grasp wide,' and that was (called) the belly (udara).

4\. Then he said: 'Make room for me,' and that was (called) the chest
(uras).

5\. The *S*ârkarâkshyas meditate on the belly as Brahman, the Âru*n*is
on the heart <span id="fr_512"></span>[2](#fn_510). Both (these places)
are Brahman indeed <span id="fr_513"></span>[3](#fn_511).

6\. But Brahman crept upwards and came to the head, and because he came
to the head, therefore the head is called head <span
id="fr_514"></span>[4](#fn_512).

7\. Then these delights alighted in the head, sight, hearing, mind,
speech, breath.

8\. Delights alight on him who thus knows, why the head is called head.

9\. These (five delights or senses) strove together, saying: 'I am the
uktha (hymn), I am the uktha <span id="fr_515"></span>[5](#fn_513).'
'Well,' they said, 'let us all go out from

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

this body; then on whose departure this body shall fall, he shall be the
uktha among us <span id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_514).'

10\. Speech went out, yet the body without speaking remained, eating and
drinking.

Sight went out, yet the body without seeing remained, eating and
drinking.

Hearing went out, yet the body without hearing remained, eating and
drinking.

Mind went out, yet the body, as if blinking, remained, eating and
drinking.

Breath went out, then when breath was gone out, the body fell.

11\. It was decayed, and because people said, it decayed, therefore it
was (called) body (*s*arîra). That is the reason of its name.

12\. If a man knows this, then the evil enemy who hates him decays, or
the evil enemy who hates him is defeated.

13\. They strove again, saying: 'I am the uktha, I am the uktha.'
'Well,' they said, 'let us enter that body again; then on whose entrance
this body shall rise again, he shall be the uktha among us.'

14\. Speech entered, but the body lay still. Sight entered, but the body
lay still. Hearing entered, but the body lay still. Mind entered, but
the body lay still. Breath entered, and when breath had entered, the
body rose, and it became the uktha.

15\. Therefore breath alone is the uktha.

16\. Let people know that breath is the uktha indeed.

17\. The Devas (the other senses) said to breath: 'Thou art the uktha,
thou art all this, we are thine, thou art ours.'

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

18\. This has also been said by a *Ri*shi (Rv. VIII, 92, 32): 'Thou art
ours, we are thine.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_509"></span>[206:1](sbe01205.htm#fr_511) These are all
plays on words. Comm.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[206:2](sbe01205.htm#fr_512) This does not
appear to be the case either in the *Kh*. Up. V, 15; 17, or in the
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a X, 6, 1.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[206:3](sbe01205.htm#fr_513) The pluti in tâȝi
is explained as *s*âstrîyaprasiddhyarthâ.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[206:4](sbe01205.htm#fr_514) All puns, as if we
were to say, because he hied up to the head, therefore the head was
called head.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[206:5](sbe01205.htm#fr_515) Each wished to be
identified with the uktha, as it was said before that the human body,
mouth, nostrils, forehead were to be identified with the uktha. Cf.
Kaush. Up. III, 3.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[207:1](sbe01205.htm#fr_516) Cf. *Kh*. Up. V,
1; B*ri*h. Up. VI, 1; Kaush. Up. II, 12-14; III, 2; Prasna Up. II, 1.
