<p>1. Now those who repeat the Nirbhuga say:</p>  
<p>2. 'The former half&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_646"></A><A HREF="#fn_644"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is the first syllable, the latter half the second syllable, and the space between the first and second halves is the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union).'</p>  
<p>3. He who thus knows this Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.</p>  
<p>4. Now Hrasva M&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&ucirc;keya says: 'We reciters of Nirbhuga say, "Yes, the former half is the first syllable, and the latter half the second syllable, but the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; is the space between the first and second halves in so far as by it one turns out the union (sandhi), and knows what is the accent and what is not&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_647"></A><A HREF="#fn_645"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and distinguishes what is the mora and what is not."'</p>  
<p>5. He who thus knows this Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.</p>  
<p>6. Now his middle son, the child of his mother Pr&acirc;tibodh&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_648"></A><A HREF="#fn_646"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, says: 'One pronounces these two syllables letter by letter, without entirely separating</p>

<p>them, and without entirely uniting them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_649"></A><A HREF="#fn_647"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Then that mora between the first and second halves, which indicates the union, that is the S&acirc;man (evenness, sliding). I therefore hold S&acirc;man only to be the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union).</p>  
<p>7. This has also been declared by a <I>Ri</I>shi (Rv. II, 23, 16):--</p>  
<p>8. 'O B<I>ri</I>haspati, they know nothing higher than S&acirc;man.'</p>  
<p>9. He who thus knows this Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.</p>

In tava it, the vowel i is a short mora or m&acirc;tr&acirc;; but if joined with va, it vanishes, and becomes long e, tavet. Comm.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_646"></A><A HREF="sbe01231.htm#fr_648">253:3</A> Pr&acirc;t&icirc;bodh&icirc;putra, the son of Pr&acirc;t&icirc;bodh&icirc;, she being probably one out of several wives of Hrasva. Another instance of this metronymic nomenclature occurred in K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a Devak&icirc;putra, <I>Kh</I>. Up. III, 7, 6. The Kashmir MS. reads Pr&acirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;bodh&icirc;, but Pratibodha is a recognised name in Ga<I>n</I>a Vid&acirc;di, and the right reading is probably Pr&acirc;tibodh&icirc;. The same MS. leaves out putra &acirc;ha.</P>
