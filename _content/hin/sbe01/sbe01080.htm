<p>1. 'Air (v&acirc;yu) is indeed the end of all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. For when fire goes out, it goes into air. When the sun goes down, it goes into air. When the moon goes down, it goes into air.</p>

<p>3. 'Now with reference to the body. Breath (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a) is indeed the end of all. When a man sleeps, speech goes into breath, so do sight, hearing, and mind. Breath indeed consumes them all.</p>

<p>5. Once while <I>S</I>aunaka K&acirc;peya and Abhiprat&acirc;rin K&acirc;kshaseni were being waited on at their meal, a religious student begged of them. They gave him nothing.</p>  
<p>6. He said: 'One god--who is he?--swallowed the four great ones&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, he, the guardian of the world.</p>

<p>7. <I>S</I>aunaka K&acirc;peya, pondering on that speech, went to the student and said: 'He is the self of the Devas, the creator of all beings, with golden tusks, the eater, not without intelligence. His greatness is said to be great indeed, because, without being eaten, he eats even what is not food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Thus do we, O Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin, meditate on that Being.' Then he said: 'give him food.'</p>  
<p>8. They gave him food. Now these five (the eater V&acirc;yu (air), and his food, Agni (fire), &Acirc;ditya (sun), <I>K</I>andramas (moon), Ap (water)) and the other five (the eater Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a (breath), and his food, speech, sight, hearing, mind) make ten, and that is the K<I>ri</I>ta (the highest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>) cast (representing the ten, the eaters and the food). Therefore in all quarters those ten are food (and) K<I>ri</I>ta (the highest cast).
