### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Will <span id="fr_306"></span>[2](#fn_304) (saṅkalpa) is better
than mind. For when a man wills, then he thinks in his mind, then he
sends forth speech, and he sends it forth in a name. In a name the
sacred hymns are contained, in the sacred hymns all sacrifices.

2\. 'All these therefore (beginning with mind and

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

ending in sacrifice) centre in will, consist of will, abide in will.
Heaven and earth willed, air and ether willed, water and fire willed.
Through the will of heaven and earth &c. rain wills; through the will of
rain food wills; through the will of food the vital airs will; through
the will of the vital airs the sacred hymns will; through the will of
the sacred hymns the sacrifices will; through the will of the sacrifices
the world (as their reward) wills; through the will of the world
everything wills <span id="fr_307"></span>[1](sbe01139.htm#fn_305). This
is will. Meditate on will.

3\. 'He who meditates on will as Brahman, he, being himself safe, firm,
and undistressed, obtains the safe, firm, and undistressed worlds which
he has willed; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as will
reaches--he who meditates on will as Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than will?'

'Yes, there is something better than will.'

'Sir, tell it me.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_304"></span>[112:2](sbe01138.htm#fr_306) Saṅkalpa is
elsewhere defined as a modification of manas. The commentator says that,
like thinking, it is an activity of the inner organ. It is difficult to
find any English term exactly corresponding to saṅkalpa. Rajendralal
Mitra translates it by will, but it implies not only will, but at the
same time conception, determination, and desire.
