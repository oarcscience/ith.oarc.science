<p>Having said this he took fuel in his hand (like a pupil), and approached <I>K</I>itra G&acirc;&#7749;gy&acirc;yani, saying: 'May I come near to you?'

Then I, growing up to be born, a being living by months, whether twelve or thirteen, was together with my father, who also lived by (years of) twelve or thirteen months, that I might either know it (the true Brahman) or not know it. Therefore, O ye seasons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_709"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, grant that I may attain immortality (knowledge of Brahman).

<p>and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the hall of Brahman, called Vibhu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_714"></A><A HREF="#fn_712"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (built by vibhu, egoism), the throne Vi<I>k</I>aksha<I>n</I>&acirc; (buddhi, perception), the couch Amitau<I>g</I>as (endless splendour), and the beloved M&acirc;nas&icirc; (mind) and her image <I>K</I>&acirc;kshush&icirc; (eye), who, as if taking flowers, are weaving the worlds, and the Apsaras, the Amb&acirc;s (sruti, sacred scriptures), and Amb&acirc;yav&icirc;s (buddhi, understanding), and the rivers Ambay&acirc;s (leading to the knowledge of Brahman). To this world he who knows this (who knows the Parya&#7749;ka-vidy&acirc;) approaches. Brahman says to him: 'Run towards him (servants) with such worship as is due to myself. He has reached the river Vi<I>g</I>ar&acirc; (age-less), he will never age.</p>  
<p>4. Then five hundred Apsaras go towards him, one hundred with garlands in their hands, one hundred with ointments in their hands, one hundred with perfumes in their hands, one hundred with garments in their hands, one hundred with fruit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_715"></A><A HREF="#fn_713"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in their hands.

<p>He comes to the river Vi<I>g</I>ar&acirc;, and crosses it by the mind alone, and there shakes off his good and evil deeds. His beloved relatives obtain the good, his unbeloved relatives the evil he has done. And as a man, driving in a chariot, might look at the two wheels (without being touched by them), thus he will look at day and night, thus at good and evil deeds, and at all pairs (at all correlative things, such as light and darkness, heat and cold, &amp;c.) Being freed from good and freed from evil he, the knower of Brahman (neut.), moves towards Brahman.</p>  
<p>5. He approaches the tree Ilya, and the odour of Brahman reaches him. He approaches the city S&acirc;la<I>g</I>ya, and the flavour of Brahman reaches him. He approaches the palace Apar&acirc;<I>g</I>ita, and the splendour of Brahman reaches him. He approaches the door-keepers Indra and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and they run away from him. He approaches the hall Vibhu, and the glory of Brahman reaches him (he thinks, I am Brahman). He approaches the throne Vi<I>k</I>aksha<I>n</I>&acirc;. The S&acirc;man verses, B<I>ri</I>had and Rathantara, are the eastern feet of that throne&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_718"></A><A HREF="#fn_716"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; the S&acirc;man verses, <I>S</I>yaita and Naudhasa, its western feet; the S&acirc;man verses, Vair&ucirc;pa and Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a, its sides lengthways (south and north); the S&acirc;man verses, <I>S</I>&acirc;kvara and Raivata, its sides crossways (east and west). That throne is Pra<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;, knowledge, for by knowledge (self-knowledge) he sees clearly. He approaches the couch Amitau<I>g</I>as. That is Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a (speech). The past and the future are its eastern feet; prosperity and earth its western feet; the S&acirc;man verses, Brihad and Rathantara, are the two sides lengthways of the couch (south and north);</p>

<p>the S&acirc;man verses, Bhadra and Ya<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;ya<I>g</I>&ntilde;&icirc;ya, are its cross-sides at the head and feet (east and west); the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> and S&acirc;man are the long sheets&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_719"></A><A HREF="#fn_717"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (east and west); the Ya<I>g</I>us the cross-sheets (south and north); the moon-beam the cushion; the Udg&icirc;tha the (white) coverlet; prosperity the pillow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_720"></A><A HREF="#fn_718"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. On this couch sits Brahman, and he who knows this (who knows himself one with Brahman sitting on the couch) mounts it first with one foot only. Then Brahman says to him: 'Who art thou?' and he shall answer:</p>  
<p>6. 'I am (like) a season, and the child of the seasons, sprung from the womb of endless space, from the light (from the luminous Brahman).

<p>Brahman says to him: 'How dost thou obtain my male names?' He should answer: 'By breath (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a<I>h</I>).'</p>  
<p>Brahman asks: 'How my female names?' He should answer: 'By speech (v&acirc;<I>k</I>).'</p>  
<p>Brahman asks: 'How my neuter names?' He should answer: 'By mind (manas).'</p>  
<p>'How smells?' 'By the nose.' 'How forms?' 'By the eye.' 'How sounds?' 'By the ear.' 'How flavours of food?' 'By the tongue.' 'How actions?' 'By the hands.' 'How pleasures and pain?' 'By the body.' 'How joy, delight, and offspring?' 'By the organ.' 'How journeyings?' 'By the feet.' 'How thoughts, and what is to be known and desired?' 'By knowledge (pra<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;) alone.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_694"></A><A HREF="sbe01239.htm#fr_696">271:1</A> It is difficult to determine whether <I>K</I>itra's name was G&acirc;&#7749;gy&acirc;yani or G&acirc;rgy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>i. Professor Weber adopted first G&acirc;rgy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>i (Indische Studien 1, P. 395), afterwards G&acirc;&#7749;gy&acirc;yani (ibid. II, 395). Professor Cowell adopts G&acirc;&#7749;gy&acirc;yani, but he tells us that the Telugu MS. reads G&acirc;rgy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>i throughout, and the other MSS. B, C do so occasionally. The commentator explains G&acirc;&#7749;gy&acirc;yani as the descendant (yuv&acirc;patyam) of G&acirc;&#7749;gya. I confess a preference for G&acirc;rgy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>i, because both Ga&#7749;g&acirc; and G&acirc;&#7749;gya are names of rare occurrence in ancient Vedic literature, but I admit that for that very reason the transition of G&acirc;&#7749;gy&acirc;yani into G&acirc;rgy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>i is perhaps more intelligible than that of G&acirc;rgy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>i into G&acirc;&#7749;gy&acirc;yani.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_696"></A><A HREF="sbe01239.htm#fr_698">271:3</A> Cf. <I>Kh</I>. Up. V, 3; VI, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_697"></A><A HREF="sbe01239.htm#fr_699">271:4</A> B<I>ri</I>h. &Acirc;r. VI, 2, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_698"></A><A HREF="sbe01239.htm#fr_700">271:5</A> The question put by <I>K</I>itra to <I>S</I>vetaketu is very obscure, and was probably from the first intended to be obscure in its very wording. What <I>K</I>itra wished to ask we can gather from other passages in the Upanishads, where we see another royal sage, Prav&acirc;ha<I>n</I>a Gaivali (<I>Kh</I>. Up. V, 3; B<I>ri</I>h. &Acirc;r. VI, 2), enlightening <I>S</I>vetaketu on the future life. That future life is reached by two roads; <a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="green">p. 272</font></A> one, the Devapatha, leading to the world of Brahman (the conditioned), beyond which there lies one other stage only, represented by knowledge of and identity with the unconditioned Brahman; the other leading to the world of the fathers, and from thence, after the reward of good works has been consumed, back to a new round of mundane existence. There is a third road for creatures which live and die, worms, insects, and creeping things, but they are of little consequence. Now it is quite clear that the knowledge which king <I>K</I>itra possesses, and which <I>S</I>vetaketu does not possess, is that of the two roads after death, sometimes called the right and the left, or the southern and northern roads. These roads are fully described in the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya-upanishad and in the B<I>ri</I>had-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, with certain variations, yet on the whole with the same purpose. The northern or left road, called also the path of the Devas, passes on from light and day to the bright half of the moon; the southern or right road, called also the path of the fathers, passes on from smoke and night to the dark half of the moon. Both roads therefore meet in the moon, but diverge afterwards. While the northern road passes by the six months when the sun moves towards the north, through the sun, (moon,) and the lightning to the world of Brahman, the southern passes by the six months when the sun moves towards the south, to the world of the fathers, the ether, and the moon. The great difference, however, between the two roads is, that while those who travel on the former do not return again to a new life on earth, but reach in the end a true knowledge of the unconditioned Brahman, those who pass on to the world of the fathers and the moon return to earth to be born again and again.</p>  
<p>The question therefore which <I>K</I>itra addresses to <I>S</I>vetaketu can refer to these two roads only, and though the text is very corrupt, and was so evidently even at the time when the commentary was written, we must try to restore it in accordance with the teaching imparted by <I>K</I>itra in what follows. I propose to read: Gautamasya putra, asti sa<I>m</I>v<I>ri</I>ta<I>m</I> loke yasmin m&acirc; dh&acirc;syasy anyatamo v&acirc;dhv&acirc; tasya (or yasya) m&acirc; loke dh&acirc;syasi, 'Is there a hidden place in the world where you (by your sacrificing and teaching) are able to <a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="green">p. 273</font></A> place me, or is it the other way, and will you place me in the world to which it leads?' Even thus the text is by no means satisfactory, but it is better than anyam aho v&acirc;dhv&acirc;, adopted by the commentator and explained by him: Is there a hidden place in that world in which you will place me as another, i. e. as different from the whole world or identical with the whole world, and, if as different, then having bound me (v&acirc;dhv&acirc; = baddhv&acirc;) and made me a different person? We may read anyataro for anyatamo v&acirc;dhv&acirc;. The commentator sums up the question as referring to a hidden or not hidden place, where <I>K</I>itra should be placed as another person or not another person, as bound or not bound; or, as Professor Cowell renders it, 'O son of Gautama, is there any secret place in the world where thou canst set me unconnected, having fixed me there (as wood united with glue); or is there some other place where thou canst set me?' The speculations on the fate of the soul after death seem to have been peculiar to the royal families of India, while the Brahmans dwelt more on what may be called the shorter cut, a knowledge of Brahman as the true Self. To know, with them, was to be, and, after the dissolution of the body, they looked forward to immediate emancipation, without any further wanderings.</P>

The negative is out of the question, for pra<I>g</I>anayati, he sends into a new life, is exactly what the moon does to those who do not proceed on the Devapatha to the Brahmaloka.
