<p>1. All this is Brahman (n.) Let a man meditate on that (visible world) as beginning, ending, and breathing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in it (the Brahman).</p>  
<p>Now man is a creature of will. According to what his will is in this world, so will he be when he has departed this life. Let him therefore have this will and belief:</p>  
<p>2. The intelligent, whose body is spirit, whose form is light, whose thoughts are true, whose nature is like ether (omnipresent and invisible), from whom all works, all desires, all sweet odours and tastes proceed; he who embraces all this, who never speaks, and is never surprised,</p>

He also is my self within the heart, greater than the earth, greater than the sky, greater than heaven, greater than all these worlds.</p>
