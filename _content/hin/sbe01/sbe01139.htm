<p>sends it forth in a name. In a name the sacred hymns are contained, in the sacred hymns all sacrifices.</p>  
<p>2. 'All these (beginning with mind and ending in sacrifice) centre in consideration, consist of consideration, abide in consideration. Therefore if a man is inconsiderate, even if he possesses much learning, people say of him, he is nothing, whatever he may know; for, if he were learned, he would not be so inconsiderate. But if a man is considerate, even though he knows but little, to him indeed do people listen gladly. Consideration is the centre, consideration is the self, consideration is the support of all these. Meditate on consideration.</p>  
<p>3. 'He who meditates on consideration as Brahman, he, being himself safe, firm, and undistressed, obtains the safe, firm, and undistressed worlds which he has considered; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as consideration reaches--he who meditates on consideration as Brahman.'</p>  
<p>'Sir, is there something better than consideration?'</p>  
<p>'Yes, there is something better than consideration.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_305"></A><A HREF="sbe01138.htm#fr_307">113:1</A> This paragraph is obscure. The text seems doubtful, for instance, in samak<I>li</I>pat&acirc;m, samakalpet&acirc;m, and samakalpat&acirc;m. Then the question is the exact meaning of sa<I>m</I>k<I>li</I>ptyai, which must be taken as an instrumental case. What is intended is that, without rain, food is impossible &amp;c. or inconceivable; but the text says, 'By the will of rain food wills,' &amp;c. Will seems almost to be taken here in the sense in which modern philosophers use it, as a kind of creative will. By the will of rain food wills, would mean, that first rain wills and exists, and afterwards the vital airs will and exist, &amp;c.</P>
