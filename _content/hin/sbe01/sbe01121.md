### THIRD KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Of all living things there are indeed three origins only <span
id="fr_277"></span>[4](#fn_276), that which springs from an egg
(oviparous), that which springs from a living being (viviparous), and
that which springs from a germ.

2\. 'That Being <span id="fr_278"></span>[5](#fn_277) (i. e. that which
had produced fire, water, and earth) thought, let me now enter those
three beings <span id="fr_279"></span>[5](#fn_277) (fire, water, earth)
with this living

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Self (*g*îva
âtmâ) <span id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_278), and let me then reveal
(develop) names and forms.

3\. 'Then that Being having said, Let me make each of these three
tripartite (so that fire, water, and earth should each have itself for
its principal ingredient, besides an admixture of the other two) entered
into those three beings (devatâ) with this living self only, and
revealed names and forms.

4\. 'He made each of these tripartite; and how these three beings become
each of them tripartite, that learn from me now, my friend!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_276"></span>[94:4](sbe01121.htm#fr_277) In the Ait. Up.
four are mentioned, a*nd*a*g*a, here â*nd*a*g*a, *g*âru*g*a (i.e.
*g*arâyu*g*a), here *g*îva*g*a, sveda*g*a, and udbhi*gg*a, sveda*g*a,
born from heat, being additional. Cf. Atharva-veda I, 12, 1.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[94:5](sbe01121.htm#fr_279) The text has
devatâ, deity; here used in a very general sense. The Sat, though it has
produced fire, water, and earth, has not yet obtained its wish of
becoming many.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[95:1](sbe01121.htm#fr_280) This living self is
only a shadow, as it were, of the Highest Self; and as the sun,
reflected in the water, does not suffer from the movement of the water,
the real Self does not suffer pleasure or pain on earth, but the living
self only.
