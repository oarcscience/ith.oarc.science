<p>1. Upako<I>s</I>ala K&acirc;mal&acirc;yana dwelt as a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin (religious student) in the house of Satyak&acirc;ma <I>G</I>&acirc;b&acirc;la. He tended his fires for twelve years. But the teacher, though he allowed other pupils (after they had learnt the sacred books) to depart to their own homes, did not allow Upakosala to depart.</p>  
<p>2. Then his wife said to him: 'This student, who is quite exhausted (with austerities), has carefully tended your fires. Let not the fires themselves blame you, but teach him.' The teacher, however, went away on a journey without having taught him.</p>  
<p>The student from sorrow was not able to eat.</p>

He said: 'There are many desires in this man here, which lose themselves in different directions. I am full of sorrows, and shall take no food.'</p>  
<p>4. Thereupon the fires said among themselves: 'This student, who is quite exhausted, has carefully tended us. Well, let us teach him.' They said to him:</p>  
<p>5. 'Breath is Brahman, Ka (pleasure) is Brahman, Kha (ether) is Brahman.'</p>

<p>They said: 'What is Ka is Kha, what is Kha is Ka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' They therefore taught him Brahman as breath, and as the ether (in the heart)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_209"></A><A HREF="sbe01087.htm#fr_210">64:3</A> The Upako<I>s</I>ala-vidy&acirc; teaches first Brahman as the cause, and then in its various forms, and is therefore called &acirc;tmavidy&acirc; and agnividy&acirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_210"></A><A HREF="sbe01087.htm#fr_211">65:1</A> I do not understand, he means, how Ka, which means pleasure, and is non-eternal, and how Kha, which means ether, and is not intelligent, can be Brahman.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_211"></A><A HREF="sbe01087.htm#fr_212">65:2</A> The commentator explains as follows:--Ka is pleasure, and Kha is ether, but these two words are to determine each other mutually, and thus to form one idea. Ka therefore does not mean ordinary pleasures, but pleasures such as belong to Kha, the ether. And Kha does not signify the ordinary outward ether, but the ether in the heart, which alone is capable of pleasure. What is meant by Ka and Kha is therefore the sentient ether in the heart, and that is Brahman, while Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, breath, is Brahman, in so far as it is united with the ether in the heart.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_212"></A><A HREF="sbe01087.htm#fr_213">65:3</A> And as its ether, i.e. as the ether in the heart, the Brahman, with which pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is connected. Comm.</P>
