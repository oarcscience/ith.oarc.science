<P><A NAME="fn_372"></A><A HREF="sbe01179.htm#fr_374">151:2</A> The next phrase was borrowed from &sect; 3, without even changing the singular to the plural. As Indra only found out that it was Brahman, the original distinction between Indra and the other gods, who only came near to it, was quite justified. Still it might be better to adopt the var. lect. sa hy etat in &sect; 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_373"></A><A HREF="sbe01179.htm#fr_375">152:1</A> I have translated these paragraphs very differently from <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara and other interpreters. The wording is extremely brief, and we can only guess the original intention of the Upanishad by a reference to other passages. Now the first teaching of Brahman, by means of a comparison with the gods or heavenly things in general, seems to be that Brahman is what shines forth suddenly like lightning. Sometimes the relation between the phenomenal world and Brahman is illustrated by the relation between bubbles and the sea, or lightning and the unseen heavenly light (Mait. Up. V 1, 35). In another passage, <I>Kh</I>. Up. VIII, 12, 2, lightning, when no longer seen, is to facilitate the conception of the reality of things, as distinct from their perceptibility. I think, therefore, that the first simile, taken from the phenomenal world, was meant to show that Brahman is that which appears for a moment in the lightning, and then vanishes from our sight.</p>  
<p>The next illustration is purely psychological. Brahman is proved to exist, because our mind moves towards things, because there is something in us which moves and perceives, and because there is something in us which holds our perceptions together (sa&#7749;kalpa), and revives them again by memory.</p>  
<p>I give my translation as hypothetical only, for certainty is extremely difficult to attain, when we have to deal with these enigmatical sayings which, when they were first delivered, were necessarily accompanied by oral explanations.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_374"></A><A HREF="sbe01179.htm#fr_376">152:2</A> Tadvana, as a name of Brahman, is explained by 'the desire of it,' and derived from van, to desire, the same as v&acirc;&ntilde;<I>kh</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_375"></A><A HREF="sbe01179.htm#fr_377">153:1</A> It is impossible to adopt <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara's first rendering, 'the Vedas and all the A&#7749;gas,' i.e. the six subsidiary doctrines. He sees himself that sarv&acirc;&#7749;g&acirc;ni stands in opposition to pratish<I>th</I>&acirc; and &acirc;yatana, but seeing Veda and A&#7749;ga together, no Brahman could help thinking of the Ved&acirc;&#7749;gas.</P>
