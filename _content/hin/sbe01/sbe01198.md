Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THIRD KHA*ND*A.

1\. He recites the eighty tristichs of Gâyatrîs <span
id="fr_476"></span>[2](#fn_474). Verily, the eighty Gâyatrî tristichs
are this world (earth). Whatever there is in this world of glory,
greatness, wives, food, and honour, may I obtain it, may I win it, may
it be mine.

2\. Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas verily is breath. He joins
this world with breath.

3\. He recites the eighty tristichs of B*ri*hatîs. Verily, the eighty
B*ri*hatî tristichs are the world of the sky. Whatever there is in the
world of the sky of glory, greatness, wives, food, and honour, may I
obtain it, may I win it, may it be mine.

4\. Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas verily is breath. He joins
the world of the sky with breath.

5\. He recites the eighty tristichs of Ush*n*ih. Verily, the eighty
Ush*n*ih tristichs are that world, the heaven. Whatever there is in that
world of glory, greatness, wives, food, and honour, also the divine
being of the Devas (Brahman), may I obtain it, may I win it, may it be
mine.

6\. Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas verily is the breath. He
joins that world with breath, yea, with breath.
