### THIRD KHA*ND*A.

1\. While Vi*s*vâmitra was going to repeat the hymns of this day (the
mahâvrata), Indra sat down near him <span
id="fr_539"></span>[4](#fn_537). Vi*s*vâmitra (guessing that Indra
wanted food) said to him, 'This (the verses of the hymn) is food,' and
repeated the thousand B*ri*hatî verses <span
id="fr_540"></span>[5](#fn_538)

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> By means of this
he went to the delightful home of Indra (Svarga).

2\. Indra said to him: '*Ri*shi, thou hast come to my delightful home.
*Ri*shi, repeat a second hymn <span id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_539).'
Vi*s*vâmitra (guessing that Indra wanted food) said to him, 'This (the
verses of the hymn) is food,' and repeated the thousand B*ri*hatî
verses. By means of this he went to the delightful home of Indra
(Svarga).

3\. Indra said to him: '*Ri*shi, thou hast come to my delightful home.
*Ri*shi, repeat a third hymn.' Vi*s*vâmitra (guessing that Indra wanted
food) said to him, 'This (the verses of the hymn) is food,' and repeated
the thousand B*ri*hatî verses. By means of this he went to the
delightful home of Indra (Svarga).

4\. Indra said to him: '*Ri*shi, thou hast come to my delightful home. I
grant thee a boon.' Vi*s*vâmitra said: 'May I know thee.' Indra said: 'I
am Prâ*n*a (breath), O *Ri*shi, thou art Prâ*n*a, all things are
Prâ*n*a. For it is Prâ*n*a who shines as the sun, and I here pervade all
regions under that form. This food of mine (the hymn) is my friend and
my support (dakshi*n*a). This is the food prepared by Visvâmitra. I am
verily he who shines (the sun).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_537"></span>[218:4](sbe01212.htm#fr_539) Upanishasasâda,
instead of upanishasâda. The mistake is probably due to a correction, sa
for sha; the commentator, however, considers it as a Vedic license.
Skâro 'dhika*s* *kh*ândasa*h*.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[218:5](sbe01212.htm#fr_540) These are meant
for the Nishkevalya hymn recited at the noon-libation of the Mahâvrata.
That hymn consists of ten parts, corresponding, as we saw, to ten parts
of a bird, viz. its body, neck, head, root of wings, right wing, left
wing, tail, belly, chest, and thighs. The verses corresponding to these
ten parts, beginning with tad id asa bhuvaneshu *g*yesh*th*am, are given
in the first Âra*n*yaka, and more fully in the fifth Âra*n*yaka by
*S*aunaka. <span id="page_219">p. 219</span> Though they consist of many
metres, yet, when one counts the syllables, they give a thousand
B*ri*hatî verses, each consisting of thirty-six syllables.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[219:1](sbe01212.htm#fr_541) Although the
Nishkevalya is but one hymn, consisting of eighty t*rik*as, yet as these
eighty t*rik*as were represented as three kinds of food (see Ait. Âr.
II, 1, 2, 2-4), the hymn is represented as three hymns, first as eighty
Gâyatrî t*rik*as, then as eighty B*ri*hatî t*rik*as, lastly as eighty
Ush*n*ih t*rik*as.
