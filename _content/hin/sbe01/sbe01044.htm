<p>1. Next let a man meditate on the sevenfold S&acirc;man which is uniform in itself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and leads beyond death. The word hi&#7749;k&acirc;ra has three syllables, the word prast&acirc;va has three syllables: that is equal (sama).</p>  
<p>2. The word &acirc;di (first, Om) has two syllables, the word pratih&acirc;ra has four syllables. Taking one syllable from that over, that is equal (sama).</p>  
<p>3. The word udg&icirc;tha has three syllables, the word upadrava has four syllables. With three and three syllables it should be equal. One syllable being left over, it becomes trisyllabic. Hence it is equal.</p>  
<p>4. The word nidhana has three syllables, therefore it is equal. These make twenty-two syllables.</p>  
<p>5. With twenty-one syllables a man reaches the sun (and death), for the sun is the twenty-first&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> from here; with the twenty-second he conquers what is beyond the sun: that is blessedness, that is freedom from grief</p>  
<p>6. He obtains here the victory over the sun (death), and there is a higher victory than the victory over the sun for him, who knowing this meditates on the sevenfold S&acirc;man as uniform in itself, which leads beyond death, yea, which leads beyond death.</p>
