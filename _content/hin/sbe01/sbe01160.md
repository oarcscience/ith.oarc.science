Textual Heritage

### TWENTY-SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'To him who sees, perceives, and understands this <span
id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_322), the spirit (prâ*n*a) springs from the
Self, hope springs from the Self, memory springs from the Self; so do
ether, fire, water, appearance and disappearance <span
id="fr_325"></span>[2](#fn_323), food, power, understanding, reflection,
consideration, will, Mind, speech, names, sacred hymns, and
sacrifices--aye, all this springs from the Self.

2\. 'There is this verse, "He who sees this, does not see death, nor
illness, nor pain; he who sees this, sees everything, and obtains
everything everywhere.

'"He is one (before creation), he becomes three

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (fire, water,
earth), he becomes five, he becomes seven, he becomes nine; then again
he is called the eleventh, and hundred and ten and one thousand and
twenty <span id="fr_326"></span>[1](#fn_324)."

'When the intellectual aliment has been purified, the whole nature
becomes purified. When the whole nature has been purified, the memory
becomes firm. And when the memory (of the Highest Self) remains firm,
then all the ties (which bind us to a belief in anything but the Self)
are loosened.

'The venerable Sanatkumâra showed to Nârada, after his faults had been
rubbed out, the other side of darkness. They call Sanatkumâra Skanda,
yea, Skanda they call him.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_322"></span>[124:1](sbe01160.htm#fr_324) Before the
acquirement of true knowledge, all that has been mentioned before,
spirit, hope, memory, &c., on to names, was supposed to spring from the
Sat, as something different from oneself. Now he is to know that the Sat
is the Self.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[124:2](sbe01160.htm#fr_325) In the preceding
paragraphs appearance and disappearance (birth and death) are not
mentioned. This shows how easy it was in these treatises either to omit
or to add anything that seemed important.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[125:1](sbe01160.htm#fr_326) This too is meant
as a verse. The commentary says that the various numbers are intended to
show the endless variety of form on the Self after creation. Cf. Mait.
Up. V, 2.
