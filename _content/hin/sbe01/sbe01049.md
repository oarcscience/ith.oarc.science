*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FIFTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. The mists gather, that is the hiṅkâra; the cloud has risen, that is
the prastâva; it rains, that is the udgîtha; it flashes and thunders,
that is the pratihâra; it stops, that is the nidhana. That is the
Vairûpa Sâman, as interwoven in Par*g*anya, the god of rain.

2\. He who thus knows the Vairûpa as interwoven in Par*g*anya, obtains
all kinds of cattle (virûpa), he reaches the full life, he lives long,
becomes great with children and cattle, great by fame. His rule is,
'Never complain of the rain.'
