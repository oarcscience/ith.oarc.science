### EIGHTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Look at your Self in a pan of water, and whatever you do not
understand of your Self <span id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_345), come and
tell me.'

They looked in the water-pan. Then Pra*g*âpati said to them: 'What do
you see?'

They said: 'We both see the self thus altogether, a picture even to the
very hairs and nails.'

2\. Pra*g*âpati said to them: 'After you have adorned yourselves, have
put on your best clothes and cleaned yourselves, look again into the
water-pan.

They, after having adorned themselves, having put on their best clothes
and cleaned themselves, looked into the water-pan.

Pra*g*âpati said: 'What do you see?'

3\. They said: 'Just as we are, well adorned, with our best clothes and
clean, thus we are both there, Sir, well adorned, with our best clothes
and clean.'

Pra*g*âpati said: 'That is the Self, this is the immortal, the fearless,
this is Brahman.'

Then both went away satisfied in their hearts.

4\. And Pra*g*âpati, looking after them, said: 'They both go away
without having perceived and without having known the Self, and whoever
of these two <span id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_346), whether Devas or
Asuras, will follow this doctrine (upanishad), will perish.'

Now Virokana, satisfied in his heart, went to the Asuras and preached
that doctrine to them, that the self (the body) alone is to be
worshipped, that the

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

self (the body) alone is to be served, and that he who worships the self
and serves the self, gains both worlds, this and the next.

5\. Therefore they call even now a man who does not give alms here, who
has no faith, and offers no sacrifices, an Âsura, for this is the
doctrine (upanishad) of the Asuras. They deck out the body of the dead
with perfumes, flowers, and fine raiment by way of ornament, and think
they will thus conquer that world <span id="fr_349"></span>[1](#fn_347).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_345"></span>[136:1](sbe01168.htm#fr_347) I take âtmana*h*
as a genitive, governed by yad, not as an accusative plural.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[136:2](sbe01168.htm#fr_348) The commentator
reads yatare for yata*h*.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[137:1](sbe01168.htm#fr_349) This evidently
refers to the customs and teaching of tribes not entirely conforming to
the Brahmanic system. Whether the adorning of the dead body implies
burial instead of burning, seems doubtful.
