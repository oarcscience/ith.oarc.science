### SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Reflection (dhyâna) <span id="fr_309"></span>[1](#fn_307) is better
than consideration. The earth reflects, as it were, and thus does the
sky, the heaven, the water, the mountains, gods and men. Therefore those
who among men obtain

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

greatness here on earth, seem to have obtained a part of the object of
reflection (because they show a certain repose of manner). Thus while
small and vulgar people are always quarrelling, abusive, and slandering,
great men seem to have obtained a part of the reward of reflection.
Meditate on reflection.

2\. 'He who meditates on reflection as Brahman, is lord and master, as
it were, as far as reflection reaches--he who meditates on reflection as
Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than reflection?'

'Yes, there is something better than reflection.'

'Sir, tell it me.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_307"></span>[114:1](sbe01140.htm#fr_309) Reflection is
concentration of all our thoughts on one object, ekâgratâ. And as a man
who reflects and meditates on the highest objects acquires thereby
repose, becomes firm and immovable, so the earth is supposed to be in
repose and immovable, as it were, by reflection and meditation.
