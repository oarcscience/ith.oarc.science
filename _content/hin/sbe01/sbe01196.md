## FOURTH ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. Next comes the Sûdadohas <span id="fr_462"></span>[1](#fn_460)
verse. Sûdadohas is breath, and thereby he joins all joints with breath.

2\. Next follow the neck verses. They recite them as Ush*n*ih, according
to their metre <span id="fr_463"></span>[2](#fn_461).

3\. Next comes (again) the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas is breath, and
thereby he joins all joints with breath.

4\. Next follows the head. That is in Gâyatrî verses. The Gâyatrî is the
beginning of all metres <span id="fr_464"></span>[3](#fn_462); the head
the first of all members. It is in Arkavat verses (Rv. I, 7, 1-9) <span
id="fr_465"></span>[4](#fn_463). Arka is Agni. They are nine verses. The
head consists of nine pieces. He recites the tenth verse, and that is
the skin and the hairs on the head. It serves for reciting one verse
more than (the nine verses contained in) the Stoma <span
id="fr_466"></span>[5](#fn_464).

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> These form the
Trivrit Stoma and the Gâyatrî metre, and whatever there exists, all this
is produced after the production of this Stoma and this metre. Therefore
the recitation of these head-hymns serves for production.

5\. He who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.

6\. Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Verily, Sûdadohas is breath, and
thereby he joins all joints with breath.

7\. Next follow the vertebrae <span id="fr_467"></span>[1](#fn_465) (of
the bird). These verses are Virâ*g* (shining). Therefore man says to
man, 'Thou shinest above us;' or to a stiff and proud man, 'Thou
carriest thy neck stiff.' Or because the (vertebrae of the neck) run
close together, they are taken to be the best food. For Virâ*g*, is
food, and food is strength.

8\. Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas is breath, and thereby he
joins all joints with breath.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_460"></span>[187:1](sbe01196.htm#fr_462) The
Nishkevalya-*s*astra is represented in the shape of a bird, consisting
of trunk, neck, head, vertebrae, wings, tail, and stomach. Before
describing the hymns which form the neck, another hymn has to be
mentioned, called Sûdadohas, which has to be recited at the end of the
hymns, described before, which form the trunk. Sûdadohas is explained as
'yielding milk,' and because that word occurs in the verse, the verse is
called Sûdadohas. It follows on the Nada verse, Rv. VIII, 69, 3. Cf.
Ait. Âr. I, 5, 1, 7.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[187:2](sbe01196.htm#fr_463) They occur in
another *s*âkhâ, and are to be recited such as they are, without any
insertions. They are given by *S*aunaka, Ait. Âr. V, 2, 1.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[187:3](sbe01196.htm#fr_464) It was created
from the mouth of Pra*g*âpati.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[187:4](sbe01196.htm#fr_465) They are called
so, because the word arka occurs in them.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[187:5](sbe01196.htm#fr_466) The chanters of
the Sâma-veda make a Triv*ri*t Stoma of this hymn, without any
repetitions, leaving out the tenth verse. The reciters of the Rig-veda
excel them therefore by reciting a tenth verse. This is called
ati*s*a*m*sanam (or -nâ).

<span id="fn_465"></span>[188:1](sbe01196.htm#fr_467) Vi*g*avas may be a
singular, and the commentator seems to take it as such in his first
explanation. The text, tâ virâ*g*o bhavanti, proves nothing, because it
could not be sa virâ*g*o bhavanti, nor even sa virâ*d* bhavati. Possibly
the word may occur in both forms, vi*g*u, plural vi*g*ava*h*, and
vi*g*ava*h*. In a somewhat similar way we find grîvâ and grîvâ*h*, folia
and la feuille. On p. 109, the commentator speaks of vi*g*avabhâga, and
again, p. 110, pakshamûlarûpâ vi*g*avâ abhihitâ*h*. He, however,
explains its meaning rightly, as the root of the wings, or rather the
lower bones of the neck. Grîvâ*h*, plural, were originally the vertebrae
of the neck. The paragraph, though very empty, contains at least some
interesting forms of language. First vi*g*u, vertebrae, then the
participles duta and sambâ*lh*atama, and lastly the verb pratya*k*, the
last probably used in the sense of to bring near, to represent, with the
superlative adverb annatamâm (Pâ*n*. V, 4, 11), i. e. they are
represented as if they brought the best food.
