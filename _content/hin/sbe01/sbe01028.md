*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SEVENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Now with reference to the body. *Rik* is speech, Sâman breath <span
id="fr_101"></span>[2](#fn_100). This Sâman (breath) rests on that *Rik*
(speech). Therefore the Sâman is sung as resting on the *Rik*. Sâ is
speech, ama is breath, and that makes Sâma.

2\. *Rik* is the eye, Sâman the self <span
id="fr_102"></span>[3](#fn_101). This Sâman (shadow) rests on that *Rik*
(eye). Therefore the Sâman is sung as resting on the *Rik*. Sâ is the
eye, ama the self, and that makes Sâma.

3\. *Rik* is the ear, Sâman the mind. This Sâman (mind) rests on that
*Rik* (ear). Therefore the Sâman is sung as resting on the *Rik*. Sâ is
the ear, ama the mind, and that makes Sâma.

4\. *Rik* is the white light of the eye, Sâman the blue exceeding
darkness. This Sâman (darkness) rests on the *Rik* (brightness).
Therefore the Sâman is sung as resting on the *Rik*. Sâ is the white
light of the eye, ama the blue exceeding darkness, and that makes Sâma.

5\. Now the person who is seen in the eye, he is *Rik*, he is Sâman,
Uktha <span id="fr_103"></span>[4](#fn_102), Ya*g*us, Brahman. The form
of that person (in the eye) is the same <span
id="fr_104"></span>[5](#fn_103) as the

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

form of the other person (in the sun), the joints of the one (*Rik* and
Sâman) are the joints of the other, the name of the one (ut) is the name
of the other.

6\. He is lord of the worlds beneath that (the self in the eye), and of
all the wishes of men. Therefore all who sing to the vî*n*â (lyre), sing
him, and from him also they obtain wealth.

7\. He who knowing this sings a Sâman, sings to both (the adhidaivata
and adhyâtma self, the person in the sun and the person in the eye, as
one and the same person). He obtains through the one, yea, he obtains
the worlds beyond that, and the wishes of the Devas;

8\. And he obtains through the other the worlds beneath that, and the
wishes of men.

Therefore an Udgât*ri* priest who knows this, may say (to the sacrificer
for whom he officiates);

9\. 'What wish shall I obtain for you by my songs?' For he who knowing
this sings a Sâman is able to obtain wishes through his song, yea,
through his song.
