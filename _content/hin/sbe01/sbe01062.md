Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. The northern rays of the sun are the honey-cells on the left. The
(hymns of the) Atharvâṅgiras are the bees, the Itihâsa-purâ*n*a <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_163) (the reading of the old stories) is the
flower, the water is the nectar.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

2\. Those very hymns of the Atharvâṅgiras (as bees) brooded over the
Itihâsa-purâ*n*a; and from it, thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar)
essence, fame, glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and health.

3\. That flowed forth, and went towards the sun. And that forms what we
call the extreme dark (para*h* k*ri*sh*n*am) light of the sun.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_163"></span>[39:1](sbe01062.htm#fr_164) As there is no
Atharva-veda sacrifice, properly so called, we have corresponding to the
Atharva-veda hymns the so-called fifth <span id="page_40">p. 40</span>
Veda, the Itihâsa-purâ*n*a. This may mean the collection of legends and
traditions, or the old book of traditions. At all events it is taken as
one Purâ*n*a, not as many. These ancient stories were repeated at the
A*s*vamedha sacrifice during the so-called Pariplava nights. Many of
them have been preserved in the Brâhma*n*as; others, in a more modern
form, in the Mahâbhârata. See Weber, Indische Studien, I, p. 258, note.
