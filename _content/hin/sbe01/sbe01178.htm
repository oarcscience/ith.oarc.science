<p>1. Brahman obtained the victory for the Devas. The Devas became elated by the victory of Brahman,</p>

<p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></A></p>  
<p>and they thought, this victory is ours only, this greatness is ours only.</p>  
<p>2. Brahman perceived this and appeared to them. But they did not know it, and said: 'What sprite (yaksha or yakshya) is this?'</p>  
<p>3. They said to Agni (fire): 'O <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas, find out what sprite this is.' 'Yes,' he said.</p>  
<p>4. He ran toward it, and Brahman said to him: 'Who are you?' He replied: 'I am Agni, I am <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas.'</p>  
<p>5. Brahman said: 'What power is in you?' Agni replied: 'I could burn all whatever there is on earth.'</p>  
<p>6. Brahman put a straw before him, saying: 'Burn this.' He went towards it with all his might, but he could not burn it. Then he returned thence and said: 'I could not find out what sprite this is.'</p>  
<p>7. Then they said to V&acirc;yu (air): 'O V&acirc;yu, find out what sprite this is.' 'Yes,' he said.</p>  
<p>8. He ran toward it, and Brahman said to him: 'Who are you?' He replied: 'I am V&acirc;yu, I am M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van.'</p>  
<p>9. Brahman said: 'What power is in you?' V&acirc;yu replied: 'I could take up all whatever there is on earth.'</p>  
<p>10. Brahman put a straw before him, saying: 'Take it up.' He went towards it with all his might, but he could not take it up. Then he returned thence and said: 'I could not find out what sprite this is.'</p>  
<p>11. Then they said to Indra: 'O Maghavan, find out what sprite this is.' He went towards it, but it disappeared from before him.</p>  
<p>12. Then in the same space (ether) he came</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_370"></A><A HREF="sbe01178.htm#fr_372">149:2</A> This kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a is generally represented as a later addition, but its prose style has more of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a character than the verses in the preceding kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, although their metrical structure is irregular, and may be taken as a sign of antiquity.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_371"></A><A HREF="sbe01178.htm#fr_373">151:1</A> Um&acirc; may here be taken as the wife of <I>S</I>iva, daughter of Himavat, better known by her earlier name, P&acirc;rvat&icirc;, the daughter of the mountains. Originally she was, not the daughter of the mountains or of the Him&acirc;laya, but the daughter of the cloud, just as Rudra was originally, not the lord of the mountains, gir&icirc;<I>s</I>a, but the lord of the clouds. We are, however, moving here in a secondary period of Indian thought, in whi.ch we see, as among Semitic nations, the manifested powers, and particularly the knowledge and wisdom of the gods, represented by their wives. Um&acirc; means originally flax, from v&acirc;, to weave, and the same word may have been an old name of wife, she who weaves (cf. duhit<I>ri</I>; spinster, and possibly wife itself, if O. H. G. w&icirc;b is connected with O. H. G. w&euml;ban). It is used almost synonymously with ambik&acirc;, Taitt. &Acirc;r. p. 839. If we wished to take liberties, we might translate um&acirc; haimavat&icirc; by an old woman coming from the Himavat mountains; but I decline all responsibility for such an interpretation.</P>
