Textual Heritage

### TENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'He who moves about happy in dreams, he is the Self, this is the
immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman.'

Then Indra went away satisfied in his heart. But before he had returned
to the Devas, he saw this difficulty. Although it is true that that self
is not blind, even if the body is blind, nor lame, if the body is lame,
though it is true that that self is not rendered faulty by the faults of
it (the body),

2\. Nor struck when it (the body) is struck, nor lamed when it is lamed,
yet it is as if they struck him (the self) in dreams, as if they chased
him <span id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_350).

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He becomes even
conscious, as it were, of pain, and sheds tears. Therefore I see no good
in this.

3\. Taking fuel in his hands, he went again as a pupil to Pra*g*âpati.
Pra*g*âpati said to him: 'Maghavat, as you went away satisfied in your
heart, for what purpose did you come back?'

He said: 'Sir, although it is true that that self is not blind even if
the body is blind, nor lame, if the body is lame, though it is true that
that self is not rendered faulty by the faults of it (the body),

4\. Nor struck when it (the body) is struck, nor lamed when it is lamed,
yet it is as if they struck him (the self) in dreams, as if they chased
him. He becomes even conscious, as it were, of pain, and sheds tears.
Therefore I see no good in this.'

'So it is indeed, Maghavat,' replied Pra*g*âpati; 'but I shall explain
him (the true Self) further to you. Live with me another thirty-two
years.'

He lived with him another thirty-two years. Then Pra*g*âpati said:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_350"></span>[138:1](sbe01170.htm#fr_352) I have adopted the
reading vi*kkh*âyayanti, because it is the most difficult, and therefore
explains most easily the various corruptions, or it may be emendations,
that have crept into the text. *S*aṅkara explains vi*kkh*âdayanti by
vidrâvayanti, and this shows that he too must have read vi*kkh*âyayanti,
for he could not have explained vi*kkh*âdayanti, which means they
uncover or they deprive of their clothing, by vidrâvayanti, they drive
away. It is true that vi*kkh*âyayanti may be explained in two ways; it
may be the causative of *kh*â, to cut, but this meaning is not very
appropriate here, <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> and quite
inadmissible in another passage where vi*kkh*âyayanti occurs, whereas,
if derived from vi*kh* (ὀίχομαι) in a causative sense, *S*aṅkara could
hardly have chosen a better explanation than vidrâvayanti, they make run
away. The root vi*kh*, vi*kkh*âyayati is recognised in Pâ*n*ini III, 1,
28, and in the Dhâtupâ*th*a 28, 129, but it has hitherto been met with
in this passage only, and in B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, Up. IV, 3, 20. Here
also the author speaks of a man who imagines that people kill him or do
him violence, or that an elephant chases him or that he falls into a
pit. Here we have hastîva vi*kkh*âyayati, and *S*aṅkara, at least as
printed by Dr. Roer, explains this by vi*kkh*âpayati, vi*kkh*âdayati,
vidrâvayati; dhâvatîty artha*h*. Much better is Dvivedaganga's
commentary, as published by Dr. Weber, Satap. Brâhm. p. 1145, Kadâ*k*id
ena*m* hastî vi*kkh*âyayatîva vidrâvayatîva; vi*kh*a gatau,
gupûdhûpavi*kh*ipa*n*ipanibhya âya iti (Pâ*n*. III, 1, 28) svârtha
âyapratyaya*h*. In the Dictionary of Boehtlingk and Roth the derivation
from *kh*â, to cut, is preferred; see Nachträge, s. v. *kh*â.
