Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FIFTH KHA*ND*A.

Then the Devas carried him (the breath) forth, and being carried forth,
he was stretched out, and when people said, 'He was stretched out,' then
it was in the morning; when they said, 'He is gone to rest,' then it was
in the evening. Day, therefore, is the breathing up, night the breathing
down <span id="fr_517"></span>[1](#fn_515).

2\. Speech is Agni, sight that Âditya (sun), mind the moon, hearing the
Di*s* (quarters): this is the prahitâ*m* sa*m*yoga <span
id="fr_518"></span>[2](#fn_516), the union of the deities as sent forth.
These deities (Agni, &c.) are thus in the body, but their (phenomenal)
appearance yonder is among the deities--this was intended.

3\. And Hira*n*yadat Vaida also, who knew this (and who by his knowledge
had become Hira*n*yagarbha or the universal spirit), said: 'Whatever
they do not give to me, they do not possess themselves.' I know the
prahitâ*m* sa*m*yoga, the union of the deities, as entered into the
body <span id="fr_519"></span>[3](#fn_517). This is it.

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

4\. To him who knows this all creatures, without being constrained,
offer gifts.

5\. That breath is (to be called) sattya (the true), for sat is breath,
ti is food, yam is the sun <span id="fr_520"></span>[1](#fn_518). This
is threefold, and threefold the eye also may be called, it being white,
dark, and the pupil. He who knows why true is true (why sattya is
sattya), even if he should speak falsely, yet what he says is true.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_515"></span>[208:1](sbe01206.htm#fr_517) All these are
plays on words, prâtar being derived from prâtâyi, sâyam from samâgât.
The real object, however, is to show that breath, which is the uktha,
which is the worshipper, is endowed with certain qualities, viz. time,
speech, &c.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[208:2](sbe01206.htm#fr_518) The meaning is,
that the four deities, Agni, Âditya, Moon, and the Di*s* proceed from
their own places to dwell together in the body of man, and that this is
called the prahitâ*m* sa*m*yoga*h*. Prahit is explained as prahita,
placed, sent. It is probably formed from hi, not from dhâ. Prahito*h*
sa*m*yoganam is the name of a Sâman, Ind. Stud. III, 225. As Devas or
gods they appear each in its own place. The whole passage is very
obscure.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[208:3](sbe01206.htm#fr_519) All this is
extremely obscure, possibly incorrect. For yam, unless it refers to some
other word, we expect yan. For dadyu*h* one expects dadyât. What is
intended is that Hira*n*yadat had <span id="page_209">p. 209</span>
through meditation acquired identity with the universal spirit, and that
therefore he might say that whatever was not surrendered to him did not
really belong to anybody. On Hiranyadat, see Ait. Brâhm. III, 6.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[209:1](sbe01206.htm#fr_520) Cf. *Kh*. Up.
VIII, 3, 5.
