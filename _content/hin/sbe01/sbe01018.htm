<p>THIS Upanishad is best known by the name of Kena-upanishad, from its first word. The name of br&acirc;hm&icirc;-upanishad (IV, 7) can hardly be considered as a title. It means 'the teaching of Brahman,' and is used with reference to other Upanishads also&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara, in his commentary, tells us that this Upanishad forms the ninth adhy&acirc;ya of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, or, if we take his words quite literally, he says, 'the beginning of the ninth adhy&acirc;ya is "the Upanishad beginning with the words Keneshitam, and treating of the Highest Brahman has to be taught."' In the eight preceeding adhy&acirc;yas, he tells us, all the sacred rites or sacrifices had been fully explained, and likewise the meditations (up&acirc;sana) on the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a (vital breath) which belongs to all these sacrifices, and those meditations also which have reference to the fivefold and sevenfold S&acirc;mans. After that followed G&acirc;yatra-s&acirc;man and the Va<I>m</I><I>s</I>a, the genealogical list. All this would naturally form the subject of a S&acirc;ma-veda-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and we find portions corresponding to the description given by <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara in the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya-upanishad, e<I>g</I>. the fivefold S&acirc;man, II, 2; the sevenfold S&acirc;man, II, 8; the G&acirc;yatra-s&acirc;man, III, 12, I.</p>  
<p>&Acirc;nanda<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na tells us that our Upanishad belonged to the S&acirc;kh&acirc; of the Talavak&acirc;ras.</p>  
<p>All this had formerly to be taken on trust, because no Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a was known containing the Upanishad. Dr. Burnell, however, has lately discovered a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the S&acirc;ma-veda which comes very near the description given by <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara. In a letter dated Tanjore, 8th Dec. 1878, he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xc"><font size="1" color="green">p. xc</font></A></p>  
<p>writes: 'It appears to me that you would be glad to know the following about the Kena-upanishad, as it occurs in my MS. of the Talavak&acirc;ra-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>'The last book but one of this Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is termed Upanishad-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. It consists of 145 khandas treating of the G&acirc;yatra-s&acirc;man, and the 134th is a Vamsa. The Kena-upanishad comprises the 135-145 khandas, or the tenth anuv&acirc;ka of a chapter. The 139th section begins: &acirc;s&acirc; v&acirc; idam agra &acirc;sit, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>'My MS. of the Talavak&acirc;ra-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a agrees, as regards the contents, exactly with what <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara says, but not in the divisions. He says that the Kena-upanishad begins the ninth adhy&acirc;ya, but that is not so in my MS. Neither the beginning nor the end of this Upanishad is noticed particularly.</p>  
<p>'The last book of this Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is the &Acirc;rsheya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, which I printed last February.</p>  
<p>'Among the teachers quoted in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a I have noticed both T&acirc;ndya and <I>S</I>&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yani. I should not be surprised to find in it the difficult quotations which are incorrectly given in the MSS. of S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's commentary on the Rig-veda. The story of Ap&acirc;l&acirc;, quoted by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a in his commentary on the Rig-veda, VIII, 80, as from the <I>S</I>&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yanaka, is found word for word, except some trivial var. lectiones, in sections 220-221 of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma book of the Talavak&acirc;ra-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. The <I>S</I>&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yanins seem to be closely connected with the Talavak&acirc;ra-<I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;.'</p>  
<p>From a communication made by Dr. Burnell to the Academy (1 Feb. 79), I gather that this Talavak&acirc;ra-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is called by those who study it '<I>G</I>aimin&icirc;ya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a,' after the <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; of the S&acirc;ma-veda which they follow. The account given in the Academy differs on some particulars slightly from that given in Dr. Burnell's letter to me. He writes: 'The largest part of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a treats of the sacrifices and the S&acirc;mans used at them. The first chapter is on the Agnihotra, and the Agnish<I>t</I>oma and other rites follow at great length. Then comes a book termed Upanishad-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. This contains 145 sections in four chapters. It begins with speculations on the G&acirc;yatra-s&acirc;man,</p>  
<p><a name="page_xci"><font size="1" color="green">p. xci</font></A></p>  
<p>followed by a Va<I>m</I>sa; next, some similar matter and another Va<I>m</I>sa. Then (&sect;&sect; 135-138) comes the Kena-upanishad (Talavak&acirc;ra). The last book is the &Acirc;rsheya. The Upanishad forms the tenth anuv&acirc;ka of the fourth chapter, not the beginning of a ninth chapter, as <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara remarks.'</p>  
<p>The Kena-upanishad has been frequently published and translated. It forms part of D&acirc;r&acirc; Shukoh's Persian, and Anquetil Duperron's Latin translations. It was several times published in English by Rammohun Roy (Translations of Several Principal Books, Passages, and Texts of the Veda, London, 1832, p. 41), in German by Windischmann, Poley, and others. It has been more or less fully discussed by Colebrooke, Windischmann, Poley, Weber, R&ouml;er, Gough, and Regnaud in the books mentioned before,</p>  
<p>Besides the text of this Upanishad contained in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the S&acirc;ma-veda, there is another text, slightly differing, belonging to the Atharva-veda, and there are commentaries on both texts (Colebrooke, Misc. Essays, 1873, II, p. 80).</p>
