*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. He (breath) is likewise a Bibhradvâga (bringer of offspring).
Offspring is vâ*g*a, and he (breath) supports offspring. Because he
supports it, therefore there is (the poet of the sixth Ma*nd*ala of the
Rig-veda, called) Bharadvâga. Therefore people call him who is really
Prâ*n*a (breath), Bharadvâga.

2\. The Devas (speech, &c.) said to him: 'He it is who chiefly causes us
to dwell on earth.' Because the Devas said of him, that he chiefly
caused them to dwell on earth, therefore there is (the poet of the
seventh Ma*nd*ala of the Rig-veda, called) Vasish*th*a. Therefore people
call him who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), Vasish*th*a <span
id="fr_530"></span>[1](#fn_528).

3\. He (breath) went forth towards <span id="fr_531"></span>[2](#fn_529)
all this whatsoever. Because he went forth toward all this whatsoever,
therefore there are (the poets of the eighth Ma*nd*ala of the Rig-veda,
called) the Pragâthas. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ*n*a
(breath), the Pragâthas.

4\. He (breath) purified all this whatsoever. Because he purified all
this whatsoever, therefore there

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

are (the hymns and also the poets <span id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_530)
of the ninth Ma*nd*ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Pavamânîs. Therefore
people called him who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), the Pavamânîs.

5\. He (breath) said: 'Let me be everything whatsoever, small (kshudra)
and great (mahat), and this became the Kshudrasûktas and Mahâsûktas.'
Therefore there were (the hymns and also the poets of the tenth
Ma*nd*ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Kshudrasûktas (and Mahâsûktas).
Therefore people call him who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), the
Kshudrasûktas (and Mahâsûktas).

6\. He (breath) said once: 'You have said what is well said (su-ukta)
indeed. This became a Sûkta (hymn).' Therefore there was the Sûkta.
Therefore people call him who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), Sûkta <span
id="fr_533"></span>[2](#fn_531).

7\. He (breath) is a *Rik* (verse), for he did honour <span
id="fr_534"></span>[3](#fn_532) to all beings (by entering into them).
Because he did honour to all beings, therefore there was the *Rik*
verse. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), *Rik*.

8\. He (breath) is an Ardhar*k*a (half-verse), for he did honour to all
places (ardha) <span id="fr_535"></span>[4](#fn_533). Because he did
honour to all places, therefore there was the Ardhar*k*a. Therefore
people call him who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), Ardhar*k*a.

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

9\. He (breath) is a Pada (word) <span id="fr_536"></span>[1](#fn_534),
for he got into all these beings. Because he got (pâdi) into all these
beings, therefore there was the Pada (word). Therefore people call him
who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), Pada.

10\. He (breath) is an Akshara (syllable), for he pours out (ksharati)
gifts to all these beings, and without him no one can pour out
(atiksharati) gifts. Therefore there was the Akshara (syllable).
Therefore people call him who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), Akshara <span
id="fr_537"></span>[2](#fn_535).

11\. Thus all these *Rik* verses, all Vedas, all sounds <span
id="fr_538"></span>[3](#fn_536) are one word, viz. Prâ*n*a (breath). Let
him know that Prâ*n*a is all *Rik* verses.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_528"></span>[216:1](sbe01211.htm#fr_530) I translate in
accordance with the commentator, and probably with the intention of the
author. The same etymology is repeated in the commentary on II, 2, 4, 2.
It would be more natural to take vasish*th*a in the sense of the
richest.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[216:2](sbe01211.htm#fr_531) This is the
interpretation of the commentator, and the preposition abhi seems to
show that the author too took that view of the etymology of pragâtha.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[217:1](sbe01211.htm#fr_532) It seems, indeed,
as if in the technical language of the Brahmans, the poets of the ninth
Ma*nd*ala were sometimes called Pavamânîs, and the hymns of the tenth
Ma*nd*ala Kshudrasûktas and Mahâsûktas (masc.) Cf. Ârsheya-brâhma*n*a,
ed. Burnell, p. 42.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[217:2](sbe01211.htm#fr_533) The poet also is
called Sûkta, taddrash*t*âpi sûktanâmako 'bhût. Comm.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[217:3](sbe01211.htm#fr_534) I translate
according to the commentator.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[217:4](sbe01211.htm#fr_535) Ardha means both
half and place.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[218:1](sbe01211.htm#fr_536) It may also be
intended for pâda, foot of a verse.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[218:2](sbe01211.htm#fr_537) The Prâ*n*a
(breath) is to be meditated on as all hymns, all poets, all words, &c.
Comm.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[218:3](sbe01211.htm#fr_538) All aspirated
sonant consonants. Comm.
