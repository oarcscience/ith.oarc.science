<p>1. 'A diver-bird (Madgu, meant for Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a) will declare to you another foot of Brahman.'</p>  
<p>(After these words of the Ha<I>m</I>sa), Satyak&acirc;ma, on the morrow, drove the cows onward. And when they came towards the evening, he lighted a fire, penned the cows, laid wood on the fire, and sat down behind the fire, looking toward the east.</p>  
<p>2. Then a diver flew near and said to him 'Satyak&acirc;ma.' He replied: 'Sir.'</p>  
<p>3. The diver said: 'Friend, I will declare unto you one foot of Brahman!</p>  
<p>'Declare it, Sir,' he replied.</p>  
<p>He said to him: 'Breath is one quarter, the eye is one quarter, the ear is one quarter, the mind is one quarter. This is a foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters, and called &Acirc;yatanavat (having a home).</p>  
<p>'He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name of &Acirc;yatanavat, becomes possessed of a home in this world. He conquers the worlds which offer a home, whoever knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name of &Acirc;yatanavat.'</p>
