<p>'When the intellectual aliment has been purified, the whole nature becomes purified. When the whole nature has been purified, the memory becomes firm. And when the memory (of the Highest Self) remains firm, then all the ties (which bind us to a belief in anything but the Self) are loosened.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_322"></A><A HREF="sbe01160.htm#fr_324">124:1</A> Before the acquirement of true knowledge, all that has been mentioned before, spirit, hope, memory, &amp;c., on to names, was supposed to spring from the Sat, as something different from oneself. Now he is to know that the Sat is the Self.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_323"></A><A HREF="sbe01160.htm#fr_325">124:2</A> In the preceding paragraphs appearance and disappearance (birth and death) are not mentioned. This shows how easy it was in these treatises either to omit or to add anything that seemed important.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_324"></A><A HREF="sbe01160.htm#fr_326">125:1</A> This too is meant as a verse. The commentary says that the various numbers are intended to show the endless variety of form on the Self after creation. Cf. Mait. Up. V, 2.</P>
