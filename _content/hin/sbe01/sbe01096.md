*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. Breath said: 'What shall be my food?' They answered: 'Whatever there
is, even unto dogs and birds.' Therefore this is food for Ana (the
breather). His name is clearly Ana <span
id="fr_231"></span>[3](#fn_230). To him who knows this there is nothing
that is not (proper) food.

2\. He said: 'What shall be my dress?' They answered: 'Water.' Therefore
wise people, when they are going to eat food, surround their food before
and after with water <span id="fr_232"></span>[4](#fn_231).' He
(prâ*n*a) thus gains a dress, and is no longer naked <span
id="fr_233"></span>[5](#fn_232)'.

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

3\. Satyakâma *G*âbâla, after he had communicated this to Go*s*ruti
Vaiyâghrapadya, said to him: 'If you were to tell this to a dry stick,
branches would grow, and leaves spring from it.'

4\. If <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_233) a man wishes to reach
greatness, let him perform the Dîkshâ <span
id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_234) (preparatory rite) on the day of the new
moon, and then, on the night of the full moon, let him stir a mash of
all kinds of herbs with curds and honey, and let him pour ghee on the
fire (âvasathya laukika), saying; 'Svâhâ to the oldest and the best.'
After that let him throw all that remains (of the ghee) <span
id="fr_236"></span>[3](#fn_235) into the mash.

5\. In the same manner let him pour ghee on. the fire, saying, 'Svâhâ to
the richest.' After that let him throw all that remains together into
the mash.

In the same manner let him pour ghee on the fire, saying, 'Svâhâ to the
firm rest.' After that let him throw all that remains together into the
mash.

In the same manner let him pour ghee on the fire, saying, 'Svâhâ to
success.' After that let him throw all that remains together into the
mash.

6\. Then going forward and placing the mash

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

in his hands, he recites: 'Thou (Prâ*n*a) art Ama <span
id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_236) by name, for all this together exists in
thee. He is the oldest and best, the king, the sovereign May he make me
the oldest, the best, the king, the sovereign. May I be all this.'

7\. Then he eats with the following *Rik* verse at every foot: 'We
choose that food'--here he swallows--'Of the divine Savit*ri*
(prâ*n*a)'--here he swallows--'The best and all-supporting food'--here
he swallows--'We meditate on the speed of Bhaga (Savit*ri*,
prâ*n*a)'--here he drinks all.

8\. Having cleansed the vessel, whether it be a ka*m*sa or a *k*amasa,
he sits down behind the fire on a skin or on the bare ground, without
speaking or making any other effort. If in his dream he sees a woman,
let him know this to be a sign that his sacrifice has succeeded.

9\. On this there is a *S*loka: 'If during sacrifices which are to
fulfil certain wishes he sees in his dreams a woman, let him know
success from this vision in a dream, yea, from this vision in a dream.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_228"></span>[74:1](sbe01095.htm#fr_229) Pa*d*vî*s*a,
fetter, πέδη, pedica, a word now well known, but which Burnouf
(Commentaire sur le Yaçna, Notes, CLXXIV) tried in vain to decipher.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[74:2](sbe01095.htm#fr_230) Burnouf rightly
preferred pratish*th*âsi to pratish*th*o 'si, though the commentary on
the corresponding passage of the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka seems to favour
tatpratish*th*o 'si.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[74:3](sbe01096.htm#fr_231) Ana, breather, more
general than pra-ana = prâ*n*a, forth-breather, and the other more
specified names of breath.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[74:4](sbe01096.htm#fr_232) They rinse the
mouth before and after every meal.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[74:5](sbe01096.htm#fr_233) We expect, 'He who
knows this' instead of prâ*n*a, but as <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>
prâ*n*a may apply to every individual prâ*n*a, the usual finishing
sentence was possibly dropt on purpose.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[75:1](sbe01096.htm#fr_234) The oblation here
described is called mantha, a mortar, or what is pounded in a mortar, i.
e. barley stirred in some kind of gravy. See *G*aim. N. M. V. P. 406.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[75:2](sbe01096.htm#fr_235) Not the real
dîkshâ, which is a preparatory rite for great sacrifices, but penance,
truthfulness, abstinence, which take the place of dîkshâ with those who
live in the forest and devote themselves to upâsana, meditative worship.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[75:3](sbe01096.htm#fr_236) What is here called
sampâtam avanayati is the same as sa*m*sravam avanayati in the B*ri*h.
Âr. VI, 3, 2. The commentator says: Sruvâvalepanam â*g*yam mantham
sa*m*srâvayati.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[76:1](sbe01096.htm#fr_237) Cf. B*ri*h. Âr. I,
1, 3, 22.
