*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TWENTIETH KHA*ND*A.

1\. The hiṅkâra is fire, the prastâva air, the udgîtha the sun, the
pratihâra the stars, the nidhana the moon. That is the Râ*g*ana Sâman,
as interwoven in the deities.

2\. He who thus knows the Râ*g*ana, as interwoven in the deities,
obtains the same world, the same happiness, the same company as the
gods, he reaches the full life, he lives long, becomes great with
children and cattle, great by fame. His rule is, 'Do not speak evil of
the Brâhma*n*as.'
