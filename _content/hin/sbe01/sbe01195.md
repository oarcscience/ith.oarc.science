*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### EIGHTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. He extends (these verses) by (interpolating) the sound <span
id="fr_454"></span>[4](#fn_452). Verily, breath (prâ*n*a) is sound.
Therefore every breath when it sounds, sounds loud, as it were.

2\. The verse (VIII, 69, 2) nada*m* va odatînâm, &c., is by its
syllables an Ush*n*ih <span id="fr_455"></span>[5](#fn_453), by its feet
an Anush*t*ubh <span id="fr_456"></span>[6](#fn_454). Ush*n*ih is life,
Anush*t*ubh, speech. He thus places life and speech in him (the
sacrificer.)

3\. By repeating the first verse three times, they

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

become twenty-five. The trunk is the twenty-fifth, and Pra*g*âpati is
the twenty-fifth. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his
feet, two legs, two arms, and the trunk the twenty-fifth. He adorns that
trunk as the twenty-fifth. Now this day consists of twenty-five, and the
Stoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-five: it becomes the same
through the same. Therefore the two, the day and the hymn, are
twenty-five. This is the twenty-fifth with regard to the body.

4\. Next, with regard to the deities: The eye, the ear, the mind,
speech, and breath, these five deities (powers) have entered into that
person (purusha), and that person entered into the five deities. He is
wholly pervaded there with his limbs to the very hairs and nails.
Therefore all beings to the very insects are born as pervaded (by the
deities or senses) <span id="fr_457"></span>[1](#fn_455).

5\. This has been declared by a *Ri*shi (Rv. X, 4, 8):--

6\. 'A thousandfold are these fifteen hymns;'--for five arise from
ten <span id="fr_458"></span>[2](#fn_456).

7\. 'As large as heaven and earth, so large is it;'--verily, the self
(*g*îvâtman) is as large as heaven and earth.

8\. 'A thousandfold are the thousand powers <span
id="fr_459"></span>[3](#fn_457);'--

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

by saying this the poet pleases the hymns (the senses), and magnifies
them.

9\. 'As far as Brahman reaches, so far reaches speech;'--wherever there
is Brahman, there is a word; and wherever there is a word, there is
Brahman, this was intended.

10\. The first of the hymns among all those hymns has nine verses.
Verily, there are nine prâ*n*as (openings), and it serves for their
benefit.

11\. Then follows a hymn of six verses. Verily, the seasons are six, and
it serves to obtain them.

12\. Then follows a hymn of five verses. Verily' the Paṅkti consists of
five feet. Verily, Paṅkti is food, and it serves for the gaining of
proper food.

13\. Then follows a tristich. Three are these threefold worlds, and it
serves to conquer them.

14\. These verses become B*ri*hatîs <span
id="fr_460"></span>[1](#fn_458), that metre being immortal, leading to
the world of the Devas. That body of verses is the trunk (of the bird
represented by the whole *s*astra), and thus it is. He who knows this
comes by this way (by making the verses the trunk of the bird) near to
the immortal Self, yea, to the immortal Self <span
id="fr_461"></span>[2](#fn_459).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_452"></span>[184:4](sbe01195.htm#fr_454) Cf. I, 3, 5, 1.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[184:5](sbe01195.htm#fr_455) Each pâda has
seven syllables, the third only six; but a seventh syllable is gained by
pronouncing the y as i. Comm.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[184:6](sbe01195.htm#fr_456) Because it has
four pâdas.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[185:1](sbe01195.htm#fr_457) The commentator
takes this in a different sense, explaining atra, there, as the body
pervaded by the person, yet afterwards stating that all beings are born,
pervaded by the senses.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[185:2](sbe01195.htm#fr_458) The commentator
explains ukthâ, hymns, as members or organs. They are the five, and they
spring from the ten, i. e. from the five elements (earth, water, fire,
wind, and ether), forming part of the father and mother each, and
therefore called ten, or a decade. Da*s*ata*h* is explained by
bhûtada*s*akât.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[185:3](sbe01195.htm#fr_459) The application of
the senses to a thousand different objects.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[186:1](sbe01195.htm#fr_460) Each foot of the
Trish*t*ubh has eleven syllables, to which seven are added from the Nada
hymn. This gives eighteen syllables for each pâda. Two pâdas therefore
give thirty-six syllables, and this is a B*ri*hatî. In this manner the
twenty-three verses of the hymns yield forty-six B*ri*hatîs. Comm.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[186:2](sbe01195.htm#fr_461) He obtains a birth
among the gods by means of this Mahâvrata ceremonial, if performed with
meditation and a right understanding of its hidden meaning.
