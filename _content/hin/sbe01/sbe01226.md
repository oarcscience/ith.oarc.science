## SIXTH ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. Let the women go back to their place.

2\. Who is he whom <span id="fr_609"></span>[1](#fn_607) we meditate on
as the Self? Which <span id="fr_610"></span>[2](#fn_608) is the Self?

3\. That by which we see (form), that by which we hear (sound), that by
which we perceive smells, that by which we utter speech, that by which
we distinguish sweet and not sweet, (1) and what comes from the heart
and the mind, namely, perception, command, understanding, knowledge,
wisdom, seeing, holding, thinking, considering, readiness (or
suffering), remembering, conceiving, willing, breathing, loving,
desiring?

4\. No, all these are various names only of knowledge (the true Self).
(2)

5\. And that Self, consisting of (knowledge), is Brahman (m.) <span
id="fr_611"></span>[3](#fn_609), it is Indra, it is Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_612"></span>[4](#fn_610). All these Devas, these five great
elements, earth, air, ether, water, fire, these and those which are, as
it were, small and mixed <span id="fr_613"></span>[5](#fn_611), and
seeds of this kind and that kind, born from eggs, born from the womb.,
born from heat, born from germs <span id="fr_614"></span>[6](#fn_612),
horses, cows, men, elephants, and whatsoever breathes, whether walking
or flying, and what is immoveable--all that is led (produced) by
knowledge (the Self).

6\. It rests on knowledge (the Self). The world

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

is led (produced) by knowledge (the Self). Knowledge is its cause <span
id="fr_615"></span>[1](#fn_613).

7\. Knowledge is Brahman. (3)

8\. He (Vâmadeva), having by this conscious self stepped forth from this
world, and having obtained all desires in that heavenly world, became
immortal, yea, he became immortal. Thus it is, Om. (4)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_607"></span>[245:1](sbe01226.htm#fr_609) I read ko yam
instead of ko 'yam.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[245:2](sbe01226.htm#fr_610) Or, Which of the
two, the real or the phenomenal, the nirupâdhika or sopâdhika?

<span id="fn_609"></span>[245:3](sbe01226.htm#fr_611) Hira*n*yagarbha.
Comm.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[245:4](sbe01226.htm#fr_612) Virâ*g*. Comm.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[245:5](sbe01226.htm#fr_613) Serpents, &c.,
says the commentary.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[245:6](sbe01226.htm#fr_614) Cf. *Kh*. Up. VI,
3, 1, where the svedaga, born from heat or perspiration, are not
mentioned.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[246:1](sbe01226.htm#fr_615) We have no words
to distinguish between pra*g*ñâ, state of knowing, and pra*g*ñâna, act
of knowing. Both are names of the Highest Brahman, which is the
beginning and end (pratish*th*â) of everything that exists or seems to
exist.
