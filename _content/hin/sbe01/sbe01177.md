*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. The Teacher says: 'If thou thinkest I know it well, then thou
knowest surely but little, what is that form of Brahman known, it may
be, to thee <span id="fr_370"></span>[2](#fn_368)?'

2\. The Pupil says: 'I do not think I know it well, nor do I know that I
do not know it. He

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

among us who knows this, he knows it, nor does he know that he does not
know it <span id="fr_371"></span>[1](#fn_369).

3\. 'He by whom it (Brahman) is not thought, by him it is thought; he by
whom it is thought, knows it not. It is not understood by those who
understand it, it is understood by those who do not understand it.

4\. 'It is thought to be known (as if) by awakening, and (then) we
obtain immortality indeed. By the Self we obtain strength, by knowledge
we obtain immortality.

5\. 'If a man know this here, that is the true (end of life); if he does
not know this here, then there is great destruction (new births). The
wise who have thought on all things (and recognised the Self in them)
become immortal, when they have departed from this world.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_368"></span>[148:2](sbe01177.htm#fr_370) In order to obtain
a verse, we must leave out the words tvam yad asya deveshv atha nu
mîmâ*m*syam eva. They were probably inserted, as an excuse for the third
kha*nd*a treating of the relation of Brahman to the Devas. There is
considerable variety in the text, as handed down in the Sâma-veda and in
the Atharva-veda, which shows that it has been tampered with. Daharam
for dabhram may be the older reading, as synezesis occurs again and
again in the Upanishads.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[149:1](sbe01177.htm#fr_371) This verse has
again been variously explained. I think the train of thought is this: We
cannot know Brahman, as we know other objects, by referring them to a
class and pointing out their differences. But, on the other hand, we do
not know that we know him not, i. e. no one can assert that we know him
not, for we want Brahman in order to know anything. He, therefore, who
knows this double peculiarity of the knowledge of Brahman, he knows
Brahman, as much as it can be known; and he does not know, nor can
anybody prove it to him, that he does not know Brahman.
