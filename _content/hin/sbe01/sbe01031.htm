<p>1. When the Kurus had been destroyed by (hail) stones&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, Ushasti <I>K</I>&acirc;kr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a lived as a beggar with his virgin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> wife at Ibhyagr&acirc;ma.</p>  
<p>2. Seeing a chief eating beans, he begged of him. The chief said: 'I have no more, except those which are put away for me here.'</p>  
<p>3. Ushasti said: 'Give me to eat of them.' He gave him the beans, and said: 'There is something to drink also! Then said Ushasti: 'If I drank of it, I should have drunk what was left by another, and is therefore unclean.'</p>  
<p>4. The chief said: 'Were not those beans also left over and therefore unclean?'</p>  
<p>'No,' he replied; 'for I should not have lived, if I had not eaten them, but the drinking of water would be mere pleasure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>5. Having eaten himself, Ushasti gave the remaining beans to his wife. But she, having eaten before, took them and put them away.</p>  
<p>6. Rising the next morning, Ushasti said to her: 'Alas, if we could only get some food, we might gain a little wealth. The king here is going to offer a sacrifice, he should choose me for all the priestly offices.'</p>

<p>7. His wife said to him: 'Look, here are those beans of yours.' Having eaten them, he went to the sacrifice which was being performed.</p>  
<p>8. He went and sat down on the orchestra near the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s, who were going to sing their hymns of praise. And he said to the Prastot<I>ri</I> (the leader):</p>  
<p>9. 'Prastot<I>ri</I>, if you, without knowing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the deity which belongs to the prast&acirc;va (the hymns &amp;c. of the Prastot<I>ri</I>), are going to sing it, your head will fall off.'</p>  
<p>10. In the same manner he addressed the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>: 'Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>, if you, without knowing the deity which belongs to the udg&icirc;tha (the hymns of the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>), are going to sing it, your head will fall off.'</p>  
<p>11. In the same manner he addressed the Pratihart<I>ri</I>: 'Pratihart<I>ri</I>, if you, without knowing the deity which belongs to the pratih&acirc;ra (the hymns of the Pratihart<I>ri</I>), are going to sing it, your head will fall off.'</p>  
<p>They stopped, and sat down in silence.</p>

Only, if another priest is present, who is initiated, then the uninitiated, taking his place, is in danger of losing his head.</P>
