*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NINETEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Therefore <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_265) the first food
which a man may take, is in the place of Homa. And he who offers that
first oblation, should offer it to Prâ*n*a (up-breathing), saying Svâhâ.
Then Prâ*n*a (up-breathing) is satisfied,

2\. 'If Prâ*n*a is satisfied, the eye is satisfied, if the eye is
satisfied, the sun is satisfied, if the sun is satisfied, heaven is
satisfied, if heaven is satisfied, whatever is under heaven and under
the sun is satisfied.. And through their satisfaction he (the sacrificer
or eater) himself is satisfied with offspring, cattle, health,
brightness, and Vedic splendour.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_265"></span>[89:1](sbe01113.htm#fr_266) The object now is
to show that to him who knows the Vai*s*vânara Self, the act of feeding
himself is like feeding Vai*s*vânara, and that feeding Vai*s*vânara is
the true Agnihotra.
