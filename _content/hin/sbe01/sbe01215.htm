<p>1. He who knows the gradual development of the self in him (the man conceived as the uktha), obtains himself more development.</p>  
<p>2. There are herbs and trees and all that is animated, and he knows the self gradually developing in them. For in herbs and trees sap only is seen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, but thought (<I>k</I>itta) in animated beings.</p>  
<p>Among animated beings again the self develops gradually, for in some sap (blood) is seen (as well as thought), but in others thought is not seen.</p>  
<p>4. And in man again the self develops gradually, for he is most endowed with knowledge. He says what he has known, he sees what he has known&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. He knows what is to happen to-morrow, he knows heaven and hell. By means of the mortal he desires the immortal--thus is he endowed.</p>  
<p>5. With regard to the other animals hunger and thirst only are a kind of understanding. But they do not say what they have known, nor do they see</p>
