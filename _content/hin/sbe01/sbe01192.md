Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FIFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. He extends these (verses) by (interpolating) the sound <span
id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_443). Verily, the sound is purusha, man.
Therefore every man when he speaks, sounds loud, as it were.

2\. At the end of each foot of the first verse of the hymn tad id âsa,
he inserts one foot of the second verse of hymn Rv. VIII, 69, nada*m* va
odatînâm, &c. Thus the verse is to be recited as follows:

Tad id âsa bhuvaneshu *g*yesh*th*am pu  
    nada*m* va odatînâm,  
Yato *g*a*g*ña ugras tveshan*ri*m*n*o ru  
    nada*m* yoyuvatînâm,  
Sadyo ga*g*ñâno ni ri*n*âti *s*atrûn  
    pati*m* vo aghnyânâm,  
Anu yam vi*s*ve madanti ûmâ*h* sho  
    dhenûnâm ishudhyasi.

 

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

In nada*m* va odatînâm (Rv. VIII, 69, 2), odati <span
id="fr_446"></span>[1](#fn_444) are the waters in heaven, for they water
all this; and they are the waters in the mouth, for they water all good
food.

3\. In nada*m* yoyuvatînâm (Rv. VIII, 69, 2), yoyuvatî are the waters in
the sky, for they seem to inundate; and they are the waters of
perspiration, for they seem to run continually.

4\. In pati*m* vo aghnyânâm (Rv. VIII, 69, 2), aghnyâ are the waters
which spring from the smoke of fire, and they are the waters which
spring from the organ.

5\. In dhenûnâm ishudhyasi (Rv. VIII, 69, 2), the dhenu (cows) are the
waters, for they delight all this; and ishudhyasi means, thou art food.

6\. He extends a Trish*t*ubh and an Anush*t*ubh <span
id="fr_447"></span>[2](#fn_445). Trish*t*ubh is the man, Anush*t*ubh the
wife, and they make a couple. Therefore does a man, after having found a
wife, consider himself a more perfect man.

7\. These verses, by repeating the first three times, become
twenty-five. The trunk is the twenty-fifth, and Pra*g*âpati is the
twenty-fifth <span id="fr_448"></span>[3](#fn_446). There are ten
fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, two legs, two arms, and the
trunk the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk as the twenty-fifth. Now
this day consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day
consists of twenty-five: it becomes the same

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

through the same. Therefore the two, the day and the hymn, are
twenty-five <span id="fr_449"></span>[1](sbe01194.htm#fn_447).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_443"></span>[181:1](sbe01192.htm#fr_445) The sound, nada,
is really a verse beginning with nadam, and which is interpolated after
the syllables pu ru sha*h*.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[182:1](sbe01192.htm#fr_446) The nasal pluta on
iti is explained as pâdapratîkagraha*n*e 'tyantamâdarârtha*h*. Cf. Ait.
Âr. II, 1, 4, 3.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[182:2](sbe01192.htm#fr_447) Tad id âsa is a
Trish*t*ubh, nada*m* va*h* an Anush*t*ubh.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[182:3](sbe01192.htm#fr_448) Cf. I, 1, 2, 7; I,
1, 4, 21.
