### SEVENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Next follow the powers of that Person <span
id="fr_523"></span>[1](#fn_521).

2\. By his speech earth and fire were created.

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Herbs are produced
on the earth, and Agni (fire) makes them ripe and sweet. 'Take this,
take this,' thus saying do earth and fire serve their parent, speech.

3\. As far as the earth reaches, as far as fire reaches, so far does his
world extend, and as long as the world of the earth and fire does not
decay, so long does his world not decay who thus knows this power of
speech.

4\. By breath (in the nose) the sky and the air were created. People
follow the sky, and hear along the sky, while the air carries along pure
scent. Thus do sky and air serve their parent, the breath.

As far as the sky reaches, as far as the air reaches, so far does his
world extend, and as long as the world of the sky and the air does not
decay, so long does his world not decay who thus knows this power of
breath.

5\. By his eye heaven and the sun were created. Heaven gives him rain
and food, while the sun causes his light to shine. Thus do the heaven
and the sun serve their parent, the eye.

As far as heaven reaches and as far as the sun reaches, so far does his
world extend, and as long as the world of heaven and the sun does not
decay, so long does his world not decay who thus knows the power of the
eye.

6\. By his ear the quarters and the moon were created. From all the
quarters they come to him, and from all the quarters he hears, while the
moon produces for him the bright and the dark halves for the sake of
sacrificial work. Thus do the quarters and the moon serve their parent,
the ear.

As far as the quarters reach and as far as the

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

moon reaches, so far does his world extend, and as long as the world of
the quarters and the moon does not decay, so long does his world not
decay who thus knows the power of the ear.

7\. By his mind the water and Varu*n*a were created. Water yields to him
faith (being used for sacred acts), Varu*n*a keeps his offspring within
the law. Thus do water and Varu*n*a serve their parent, the mind.

As far as water reaches and as far as Varu*n*a reaches, so far does his
world extend, and as long as the world of water and Varu*n*a does not
decay, so long does his world not decay who thus knows the power of the
mind.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_521"></span>[210:1](sbe01208.htm#fr_523) The purusha, as
described before in the second chapter, is the Pra*g*âpati or universal
spirit with whom the worshipper is to identify himself by meditation.
The manifestations of his power consist in creating the earth, fire, the
sky, the air, heaven, the sun.
