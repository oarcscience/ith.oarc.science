### SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Agni will declare to you another foot of Brahman.'

(After these words of the bull), Satyakâma, on the morrow, drove the
cows (toward the house of the teacher). And when they came towards the
evening, he lighted a fire, penned the cows, laid wood on the fire, and
sat down behind the fire, looking to the east.

2\. Then Agni (the fire) said to him: 'Satyakâma!' He replied: 'Sir.'

3\. Agni said: 'Friend, I will declare unto you one foot of Brahman.'

'Declare it, Sir,' he replied.

He said to him: 'The earth is one quarter, the sky is one quarter, the
heaven is one quarter, the ocean is one quarter. This is a foot of
Brahman, consisting of four quarters, and called Anantavat (endless).'

4\. 'He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting
of four quarters, by the name of Anantavat, becomes endless in this
world. He conquers the endless worlds, whoever knows this and meditates
on the foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name of
Anantavat.
