<P><A NAME="fn_300"></A><A HREF="sbe01135.htm#fr_302">110:1</A> This passage, exhibiting the sacred literature as known at the time, should be compared with the B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, II, 4, 10. The explanation of the old titles rests on the authority of <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara, and he is not always consistent. See Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays, 1873, 11, p. 10.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_301"></A><A HREF="sbe01135.htm#fr_303">110:2</A> Why a man who knows the Veda should not know the Self, while in other places it is said that the Veda teaches the Self, is well illustrated by the commentary. If a royal procession approaches, he says, then, though. we do not see the king, because he is hidden by flags, parasols, &amp;c., yet we say, there is the king. And if we ask who is the king, then again, though we cannot see him and point him out, we can say, at least, that he is different from all that is seen. The Self is hidden in the Veda as a king is hidden in a royal procession.</P>
