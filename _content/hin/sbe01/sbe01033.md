Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TWELFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Now follows the udgîtha of the dogs. Vaka Dâlbhya, or, as he was
also called, Glâva Maitreya, went out to repeat the Veda (in a quiet
place).

2\. A white (dog) appeared before him, and other dogs gathering round
him, said to him: 'Sir, sing and get us food, we are hungry.'

3\. The white dog said to them: 'Come to me to-morrow morning.' Vaka
Dâlbhya, or, as he was also called, Glâva Maitreya, watched.

4\. The dogs came on, holding together, each dog keeping the tail of the
preceding dog in his mouth, as the priests do when they are going to
sing praises with the Vahishpavamâna hymn <span
id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_114). After they had settled down, they began
to say Hiṅ.

5\. 'Om, let us eat! Om, let us drink! Om, may the divine Varu*n*a,
Pra*g*âpati, Savit*ri* <span id="fr_116"></span>[3](#fn_115) bring us
food! Lord of food, bring hither food, bring it, Om!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_113"></span>[21:1](sbe01032.htm#fr_114) There are certain
etymological fancies for assigning each deity to a certain portion of
the Sâma-veda ceremonial. Thus prâ*n*a is assigned to the prastâva,
because both words begin with pra. Âditya is assigned to the udgîtha,
because the sun is ut. Anna, food, is assigned to the pratihâra, because
food is taken, pratih*ri*yate, &c.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[21:2](sbe01033.htm#fr_115) This alludes to a
ceremony where the priests have to walk in procession, each priest
holding the gown of the preceding priest.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[21:3](sbe01033.htm#fr_116) The commentator
explains Varu*n*a and Pra*g*âpati as epithets of Savit*ri*, or the sun,
meaning rain-giver and man-protector.
