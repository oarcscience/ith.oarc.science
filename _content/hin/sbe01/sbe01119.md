## SIXTH PRAPÂ*TH*AKA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. Hari*h*, Om. There lived once *S*vetaketu Âru*n*eya (the grandson of
Aru*n*a). To him his father (Uddâlaka, the son of Aru*n*a) said:
'*S*vetaketu, go to school; for there is none belonging to our race,
darling, who, not having studied (the Veda), is, as it were, a
Brâhma*n*a by birth only.'

2\. Having begun his apprenticeship (with a teacher) when he was twelve
years of age <span id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_267), *S*vetaketu returned
to his father, when he was twenty-four, having then studied all the
Vedas,--conceited, considering himself well-read, and stern.

3\. His father said to him: '*S*vetaketu, as you are so conceited,
considering yourself so well-read, and so stern, my dear, have you ever
asked for that instruction by which we hear what cannot be heard, by
which we perceive what cannot be perceived, by which we know what cannot
be known?'

4\. 'What is that instruction, Sir?' he asked.

The father replied: 'My dear, as by one clod of clay all that is made of
clay is known, the difference <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_268)
being only a name, arising from speech, but the truth being that all is
clay;

5\. 'And as, my dear, by one nugget of gold <span
id="fr_270"></span>[3](#fn_269)

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

all that is made of gold is known, the difference being only a name,
arising from speech, but the truth being that all is gold?

6\. 'And as, my dear, by one pair of nail-scissors all that is made of
iron (kârsh*n*âyasam) is known, the difference being only a name,
arising from speech, but the truth being that all is iron,--thus, my
dear, is that instruction.'

7\. The son said: 'Surely those venerable men (my teachers) did not know
that. For if they had known it, why should they not have told it me? Do
you, Sir, therefore tell me that.' 'Be it so,' said the father.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_267"></span>[92:1](sbe01119.htm#fr_268) This was rather
late, for the son of a Brahman might have begun his studies when he was
seven years old. Âpastamba-sûtras I, 1, 18. Twelve years was considered
the right time for mastering one of the Vedas.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[92:2](sbe01119.htm#fr_269) Vikâra, difference,
variety, change, by form and name, development, cf. VI, 3, 3.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[92:3](sbe01119.htm#fr_270) The commentator
takes lohamani here as suvar*n*api*nd*a.
