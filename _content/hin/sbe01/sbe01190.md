*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THIRD KHA*ND*A.

1\. He begins with tad, this, (the first word of the first hymn, tad id
âsa). Verily 'this, this' is food, and thus he obtains food.

2\. Pra*g*âpati indeed uttered this as the first word, consisting of one
or two syllables, viz. tata and tâta (or tat) <span
id="fr_434"></span>[1](#fn_432). And thus does a child, as soon as he
begins to speak, utter the word, consisting of one or two syllables,
viz. tata and tâta (or tat). With this very word, consisting of tat or
tatta, he begins.

3\. This has been said by a *Ri*shi (Rv. X, 71, 1) <span
id="fr_435"></span>[2](#fn_433):--

4\. 'O B*ri*haspati, the first point of speech;'--for this is the first
and highest point of speech.

5\. 'That which you have uttered, making it a name;'--for names are made
by speech.

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

6\. 'That (name) which was the best and without a flaw;'--for this is
the best and without a flaw.

7\. 'That which was hidden by their love, is made manifest;'--for this
was hidden in the body, viz. those deities (which enter the body, Agni
as voice, entering the mouth, &c.); and that was manifest among the gods
in heaven. This is what was intended by the verse.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_432"></span>[178:1](sbe01190.htm#fr_434) Tata and tâta are
used both by children in addressing their parents, and by parents in
addressing their children. If tat is called the very same word, eva is
used in the sense of iva.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[178:2](sbe01190.htm#fr_435) The verse is cited
to confirm the meaning of tat, the first word of the first hymn (tad id
âsa), as explained before. It was said that tat was the first name
applied to a child. Now, according to Â*s*valâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 16,
8, a name is given to a child at the time of its birth, a name which no
one knows except father and mother, till the time when he is initiated
by a Guru. This is called the abhivadanîya name. In allusion to this
custom it is said here that tata is the secret name of the child, which
becomes publicly known at a later time only. Of course the
interpretation of the verse in that sense is unnatural, but quite in
keeping with the general character of the Âra*n*yaka. I doubt whether
even the commentator understood what was intended by the author, and
whether the gods who enter the body are supposed to know the name, or
whether the name refers to these gods, or, it may be, to tad, the
Brahman.
