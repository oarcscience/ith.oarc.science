## SEVENTH PRAPÂ*TH*AKA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. Nârada approached Sanatkumâra and said, 'Teach me, Sir!' Sanatkumâra
said to him: 'Please to tell me what you know; afterward I shall tell
you what is beyond.'

2\. Nârada said: 'I know the Rig-veda, Sir, the Ya*g*ur-veda, the
Sâma-veda, as the fourth the Âtharva*n*a, as the fifth the
Itihâsa-purâ*n*a (the Bhârata); the Veda of the Vedas (grammar); the
Pitrya (the rules for the sacrifices for the ancestors); the Râ*s*i (the
science of numbers); the Daiva (the science of portents); the Nidhi (the
science of time); the Vâkovâkya (logic); the Ekâyana (ethics); the
Deva-vidyâ (etymology); the Brahma-vidyâ (pronunciation, *s*ikshâ,
ceremonial, kalpa, prosody, *kh*andas); the Bhûta-vidyâ (the science of
demons); the Kshatra-vidyâ

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the science of
weapons); the Nakshatra-vidyâ (astronomy); the Sarpa and
Deva*g*ana-vidyâ (the science of serpents or poisons, and the sciences
of the genii, such as the making of perfumes, dancing, singing, playing,
and other fine arts) <span id="fr_302"></span>[1](#fn_300). All this I
know, Sir.

3\. 'But, Sir, with all this I know the Mantras only, the sacred books,
I do not know the Self. I have heard from men like you, that he who
knows the Self overcomes grief. I am in grief. Do, Sir, help me over
this grief of mine.'

Sanatkumâra, said to him: 'Whatever you have read, is only a name.

4\. 'A name is the Rig-veda, Ya*g*ur-veda, Sâma-veda, and as the fourth
the Âtharvana, as the fifth the Itihâsa-purâ*n*a, the Veda of the Vedas,
the Pitrya, the Râ*s*i, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the Vâkovâkya, the
Ekâyana, the Deva-vidyâ, the Brahma-vidyâ, the Bhûta-vidyâ, the
Kshatra-vidyâ, the Nakshatra-vidyâ, the Sarpa and Devagana-vidyâ. All
these are a name only. Meditate on the name.

5\. 'He who meditates on the name as Brahman <span
id="fr_303"></span>[2](#fn_301),

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

is, as it were, lord and master as far as the name reaches-he who
meditates on the name as Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than a name?'

'Yes, there is something better than a name.'

'Sir, tell it me.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_300"></span>[110:1](sbe01135.htm#fr_302) This passage,
exhibiting the sacred literature as known at the time, should be
compared with the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, II, 4, 10. The explanation of the
old titles rests on the authority of *S*aṅkara, and he is not always
consistent. See Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays, 1873, 11, p. 10.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[110:2](sbe01135.htm#fr_303) Why a man who
knows the Veda should not know the Self, while in other places it is
said that the Veda teaches the Self, is well illustrated by the
commentary. If a royal procession approaches, he says, then, though. we
do not see the king, because he is hidden by flags, parasols, &c., yet
we say, there is the king. And if we ask who is the king, then again,
though we cannot see him and point him out, we can say, at least, that
he is different from all that is seen. The Self is hidden in the Veda as
a king is hidden in a royal procession.
