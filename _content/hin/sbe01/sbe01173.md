### THIRTEENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_361"></span>[1](#fn_359).

1\. From the dark (the Brahman of the heart) I come to the nebulous (the
world of Brahman), from the nebulous to the dark, shaking off all evil,
as a horse shakes his hairs, and as the moon frees herself from the
mouth of Râhu <span id="fr_362"></span>[2](#fn_360). Having shaken off
the body, I obtain, self made and satisfied, the uncreated world of
Brahman, yea, I obtain it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_359"></span>[143:1](sbe01173.htm#fr_361) This chapter is
supposed to contain a hymn of triumph.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[143:2](sbe01173.htm#fr_362) Râhu, in later
times a monster, supposed to swallow the sun and moon at every solar or
lunar eclipse. At first we only hear of the mouth or head of Râhu. In
later times a body was assigned to him, but it had to be destroyed again
by Vishnu, so that nothing remained of him but his head. Râhu seems
derived from rah, to separate, to remove. From it raksh, to wish or
strive to remove, to keep off, to protect, and in a different
application rákshas, a tearing away, violence, rakshás, a robber, an
evil spirit.
