### SEVENTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Pra*g*âpati brooded over the worlds, and from them thus brooded on
he squeezed out the essences, Agni (fire) from the earth, Vâyu (air)
from the sky, Âditya (the sun) from heaven.

2\. He brooded over these three deities, and from them thus brooded on
he squeezed out the essences, the *Rik* verses from Agni, the Ya*g*us
verses from Vâyu, the Sâman verses from Âditya.

3\. He brooded over the threefold knowledge (the three Vedas), and from
it thus brooded on he squeezed out the essences, the sacred interjection
Bhûs from the *Rik* verses, the sacred interjection Bhuvas from the
Ya*g*us verses, the sacred interjection Svar from the Sâman verses.

4\. If the sacrifice is injured from the Rig-Veda side, let him offer a
libation in the Gârhapatya fire, saying, Bhû*h*, Svâha! Thus does he
bind together and heal, by means of the essence and the power of the
*Rik* verses themselves, whatever break the *Rik* sacrifice may have
suffered.

5\. If the sacrifice is injured from the Ya*g*ur-veda side, let him
offer a libation in the Dakshi*n*a fire, saying, Bhuva*h*, Svâhâ! Thus
does he bind together and heal, by means of the essence and the power of
the Ya*g*us verses themselves, whatever break the Ya*g*us sacrifice may
have suffered.

6\. If the sacrifice is injured by the Sâma-veda side, let him offer a
libation in the Âhavanîya fire, saying, Sva*h*, Svâhâ! Thus does he bind
together and heal, by means of the essence and the power of the Sâman
verses themselves, whatever break the Sâman sacrifice may have suffered.

7\. As one binds (softens) gold by means of lava*n*a <span
id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_222) (borax), and silver by means of gold,
and tin by means of silver, and lead by means of tin, and iron (loha) by
means of lead, and wood by means of iron, or also by means of leather,

8\. Thus does one bind together and heal any break in the sacrifice by
means of (the Vyâh*ri*tis or sacrificial interjections which are) the
essence and strength of the three worlds, of the deities, and of the
threefold knowledge. That sacrifice is healed <span
id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_223) in which there is a Brahman priest who
knows this.

9\. That sacrifice is inclined towards the north (in the right way) in
which there is a Brahman priest who knows this. And with regard to such
a Brahman priest there is the following Gâthâ <span
id="fr_225"></span>[3](#fn_224): 'Whereever it falls back, thither the
man <span id="fr_226"></span>[4](#fn_225) goes,'--viz. the Brahman only,
as one of the *Ri*tvi*g* priests. 'He saves the Kurus as a mare' (viz. a
Brahman priest who

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

knows this, saves the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and all the other
priests). Therefore let a man make him who knows this his Brahman
priest, not one who does not know it, who does not know it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_222"></span>[71:1](sbe01094.htm#fr_223) Lava*n*a, a kind of
salt, explained by kshâra and *t*aṅka or *t*aṅkana. It is evidently
borax, which is still imported from the East Indies under the name of
tincal, and used as a flux in chemical processes.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[71:2](sbe01094.htm#fr_224) Bheshagak*ri*ta,
explained by bhesha*g*ena 'iva k*ri*ta*h* sa*m*sk*ri*ta*h*, and also by
*k*ikitsakena su*s*ikshitena 'esha ya*g*ño bhavati,' which looks as if
the commentator had taken it as a genitive of bhesha*g*ak*ri*t.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[71:3](sbe01094.htm#fr_225) This Gâthâ (or,
according to *S*aṅkara, Anugâthâ) is probably a Gâyatrî, though
Ânandagiri says that it is not in the Gâyatrî or any other definite
metre. It may have been originally 'yato yata âvartate, tattad
ga*kkh*ati mânava*h*, kurûn a*s*vâbhirakshati.' This might be taken from
an old epic ballad, 'Wherever the army fell back, thither the man went;
the mare (mares being preferred to stallions in war) saves the Kurus.'
That verse was applied to the Brahman priest succouring the sacrifice,
whenever it seemed to waver, and protecting the Kurus, i. e. the
performers of the sacrifice.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[71:4](sbe01094.htm#fr_226) Mânava, explained
from mauna, or manana, but possibly originally, a descendant of Manu.
