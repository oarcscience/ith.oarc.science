'Of that Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara Self the head is Sute<I>g</I>as (having good light), the eye Vi<I>s</I>var&ucirc;pa (multiform), the breath P<I>ri</I>thagvartman (having various courses), the trunk Bahula (full), the bladder Rayi (wealth), the feet the earth, the chest the altar, the hairs the grass on the altar, the heart the G&acirc;rhapatya fire, the mind the Anv&acirc;h&acirc;rya fire, the mouth the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_264"></A><A HREF="sbe01112.htm#fr_265">88:1</A> The two words pr&acirc;de<I>s</I>am&acirc;tra and abhivim&acirc;na are doubtful. The commentator explains the first in different ways, which are all more or less fanciful. He is measured or known (m&acirc;tra) as Self, <a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></A> by means of heaven as his head and the earth as his feet, these being the pr&acirc;de<I>s</I>as; or, in the mouth and the rest, which are instruments, he is known as without action himself; or, he has the length from heaven to earth, heaven and earth being called pr&acirc;de<I>s</I>a, because they are taught. The interpretation, supported by the <I>G</I>&acirc;b&acirc;la<I>s</I>ruti, that pr&acirc;de<I>s</I>a is the measure from the forehead to the chin, he rejects. Abhivim&acirc;na is taken in the same meaning as abhim&acirc;na in the Ved&acirc;nta, seeing everything in oneself. Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara is taken as the real Self of all beings, and, in the end, of all Selfs, and as thus to be known and worshipped.</P>
