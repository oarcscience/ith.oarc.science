After that let him throw all that remains (of the ghee)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> into the mash.</p>

<p>In the same manner let him pour ghee on the fire, saying, 'Sv&acirc;h&acirc; to the firm rest.' After that let him throw all that remains together into the mash.</p>

He is the oldest and best, the king, the sovereign May he make me the oldest, the best, the king, the sovereign. May I be all this.'</p>  
<p>7. Then he eats with the following <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> verse at every foot: 'We choose that food'--here he swallows--'Of the divine Savit<I>ri</I> (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a)'--here he swallows--'The best and all-supporting food'--here he swallows--'We meditate on the speed of Bhaga (Savit<I>ri</I>, pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a)'--here he drinks all.</p>  
<p>8. Having cleansed the vessel, whether it be a ka<I>m</I>sa or a <I>k</I>amasa, he sits down behind the fire on a skin or on the bare ground, without speaking or making any other effort. If in his dream he sees a woman, let him know this to be a sign that his sacrifice has succeeded.</p>  
<p>9. On this there is a <I>S</I>loka: 'If during sacrifices which are to fulfil certain wishes he sees in his dreams a woman, let him know success from this vision in a dream, yea, from this vision in a dream.'</p>
