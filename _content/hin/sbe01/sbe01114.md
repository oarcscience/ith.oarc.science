### TWENTIETH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'And he who offers the second oblation, should offer it to Vyâna
(back-breathing), saying Svâhâ. Then Vyâna is satisfied,

2\. 'If Vyâna is satisfied, the ear is satisfied, if the ear is
satisfied, the moon is satisfied, if the moon is satisfied, the quarters
are satisfied, if the quarters are satisfied, whatever is under the
quarters and under the moon is satisfied. And through their
*s*atisfaction he (the sacrificer or eater) himself is satisfied with
offspring, cattle, health, brightness, and Vedic splendour.
