### THIRD KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'These true desires, however, are hidden by what is false; though
the desires be true, they have a covering which is false. Thus, whoever
belonging to us has departed this life, him we cannot gain back, so that
we should see him with our eyes.

2\. 'Those who belong to us, whether living or departed, and whatever
else there is which we wish for and do not obtain, all that we find
there (if we descend into our heart, where Brahman dwells, in the ether
of the heart), There are all our true desires, but hidden by what is
false <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_330). As people who do not know
the country, walk again and again over a gold treasure that has been
hidden somewhere in the earth and do not discover it, thus do all these
creatures day after day go into the Brahma-world (they are merged in
Brahman, while asleep), and yet do not discover it, because they are
carried away by untruth (they do not come to themselves, i. e. they do
not discover the true Self in Brahman, dwelling in the heart).

3\. 'That Self abides in the heart. And this is the etymological
explanation. The heart is called h*ri*d-ayam, instead of h*ri*dy-ayam,
i. e. He who is in the heart. He who knows this, that He is in the
heart, goes day by day (when in sushupti, deep sleep) into heaven
(svarga), i.e. into the: Brahman of the heart.

4\. 'Now that serene being <span id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_331) which,
after having

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

risen from out this earthly body, and having reached the highest light
(self-knowledge), appears in its true form, that is the Self,' thus he
spoke (when asked by his pupils). This is the immortal, the fearless,
this is Brahman. And of that Brahman the name is the True, Satyam,

5\. This name Sattyam consists of three syllables, sat-tî-yam <span
id="fr_334"></span>[1](#fn_332). Sat signifies the immortal, t, the
mortal, and with yam he binds both. Because he binds both, the immortal
and the mortal, therefore it is yam. He who knows this goes day by day
into heaven (svarga).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_330"></span>[129:1](sbe01163.htm#fr_332) All the desires
mentioned before are fulfilled, if we find their fulfilment in our Self,
in the city of Brahman within our heart. There we always can possess
those whom we have loved, only we must not wish to see them with our
eyes; that would be a false covering to a true desire.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[129:2](sbe01163.htm#fr_333) Cf. *Kh*. Up.
VIII, 12, 3.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[130:1](sbe01163.htm#fr_334) We ought probably
to read Sattyam, and then Sat-tî-yam. The î in tî would then be the dual
of an anubandha ĭ. Instead of yaddhi, I conjecture yatti. See Ait.
Âra*n*yaka II, 5, 5.
