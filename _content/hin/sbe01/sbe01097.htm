<p>1. <I>S</I>vetaketu &Acirc;ru<I>n</I>eya went to an assembly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of the Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>&acirc;las. Prav&acirc;ha<I>n</I>a <I>G</I>aivali&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> said to him: 'Boy, has your father instructed you?' 'Yes, Sir,' he replied.</p>

<p>'Do you know how they return again?' 'No Sir,' he replied.</p>  
<p>'Do you know where the path of Devas and the path of the fathers diverge?' 'No, Sir,' he replied.</p>
