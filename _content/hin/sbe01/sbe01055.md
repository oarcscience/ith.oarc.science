*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TWENTY-FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. The hiṅkâra is the threefold knowledge, the prastâva these three
worlds, the udgîtha Agni (fire), Vâyu (air), and Âditya (sun), the
pratihâra the stars, the birds, and the rays, the nidhana the serpents,
Gandharvas, and fathers. That is the Sâman, as interwoven in everything.

2\. He who thus knows this Sâman, as interwoven in everything, he
becomes everything.

3\. And thus it is said in the following verse: There are the fivefold
three (the three kinds of sacrificial knowledge, the three worlds &c. in
their fivefold form, i. e. as identified with the hiṅkâra, the prastâva,
&c.), and the other forms of the Sâman. Greater than these there is
nothing else besides.'

4\. He who knows this, knows everything. All regions offer him gifts.
His rule is, 'Let him meditate (on the Sâman), knowing that he is.
everything, yea, that he is everything <span
