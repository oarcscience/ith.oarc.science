Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SECOND KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_270)

1\. 'In the beginning,' my dear, 'there was that only which is (τὸ ὄν),
one only, without a second. Others say, in the beginning there was that
only which is not (τὸ μὴ ὄν), one only, without a second; and from that
which is not, that which is was born.

2\. 'But how could it be thus, my dear?' the father continued. 'How
could that which is, be born of that which is not? No, my dear, only
that which is, was in the beginning, one only, without a second.

3\. 'It thought <span id="fr_272"></span>[2](#fn_271), may I be many,
may I grow forth. It sent forth fire <span
id="fr_273"></span>[3](#fn_272).

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

'That fire <span id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_273) thought, may I be many,
may I grow forth. It sent forth water <span
id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_274).

'And therefore whenever anybody anywhere is hot and perspires, water is
produced on him from fire alone.

4\. 'Water thought, may I be many, may I grow forth. It sent forth
earth <span id="fr_276"></span>[3](#fn_275) (food).

'Therefore whenever it rains anywhere, most food is then produced. From
water alone is eatable food produced.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_270"></span>[93:1](sbe01120.htm#fr_271) Cf. Taitt. Up. II,
6.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[93:2](sbe01120.htm#fr_272) Literally, it saw.
This verb is explained as showing that the Sat is conscious, not
unconscious (bewusst, nicht unbewusst).

<span id="fn_272"></span>[93:3](sbe01120.htm#fr_273) In other Upanishads
the Sat produces first âkâ*s*a, ether, then vâyu, air, and then only
te*g*as, fire. Fire is a better rendering for te*g*as than light or
heat. See Jacobi, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XXIX,
p. 242. The difficulties, however, of <span id="page_94">p. 94</span>
accurately translating tegas are not removed by rendering if by fire, as
may be seen immediately afterward in VI, 4, 1, where te*g*as is said to
supply the red colour of agni, the burning fire, not the god of fire.
See also VI, 8, 6. In later philosophical treatises the meaning of
te*g*as is more carefully determined than in the Upanishads.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[94:1](sbe01120.htm#fr_274) Really the Sat, in
the form of fire. Fire is whatever burns, cooks, shines, and is red.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[94:2](sbe01120.htm#fr_275) By water is meant
all that is fluid, and bright in colour.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[94:3](sbe01120.htm#fr_276) By anna, food, is
here meant the earth, and all that is heavy, firm, dark in colour.
