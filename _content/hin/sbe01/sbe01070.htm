<p>3. That earth again is the body in man, for in it the vital airs (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which are everything) rest, and do not go beyond.</p>

<p>6. 'Such is the greatness of it (of Brahman, under the disguise of G&acirc;yatr&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>); greater than it is the Person&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> (purusha). His feet are all things. The immortal with three feet is in heaven (i. e. in himself).'</p>

<p>7. The Brahman which has been thus described (as immortal with three feet in heaven, and as G&acirc;yatr&icirc;) is the same as the ether which is around us;</p>  
<p>8. And the ether which is around us, is the same as the ether which is within us. And the ether which is within us,</p>  
<p>9. That is the ether within the heart. That ether in the heart (as Brahman) is omnipresent and unchanging. He who knows this obtains omnipresent and unchangeable happiness.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_169"></A><A HREF="sbe01070.htm#fr_170">44:3</A> The G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is one of the sacred metres, and is here to be meditated on as Brahman. It is used in the sense of verse, and as the name of a famous hymn. The G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is often praised as the most powerful metre, and whatever can be obtained by means of the recitation of G&acirc;yatr&icirc; verses is described as the achievement of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. The etymology of g&acirc;yatr&icirc; from gai and tr&acirc; is, of course, fanciful.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_170"></A><A HREF="sbe01070.htm#fr_171">45:1</A> The pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as may be meant for the five senses, as explained in <I>Kh</I>. I, 2, 1; II, 7, 1; or for the five breathings, as explained immediately afterwards in III, 13, 1. The commentator sees in them everything that here exists (<I>Kh</I>. Up. III, 15, 4), and thus establishes the likeness between the body and the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. As G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is the earth, and the earth the body, and the body the heart, G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is in the end to be considered as the heart.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_171"></A><A HREF="sbe01070.htm#fr_172">45:2</A> The four feet are explained as the four quarters of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; metre, of six syllables each. The G&acirc;yatr&icirc; really consists of three feet of eight syllables each.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_172"></A><A HREF="sbe01070.htm#fr_173">45:3</A> The G&acirc;yatr&icirc; has been identified with all beings, with speech, earth, body, heart, and the vital airs, and is therefore called sixfold. This, at least, is the way in which the commentator accounts for the epithet 'sixfold.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_173"></A><A HREF="sbe01070.htm#fr_174">45:4</A> Of Brahman modified as G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, having four feet, and being sixfold.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_174"></A><A HREF="sbe01070.htm#fr_175">45:5</A> The real Brahman, unmodified by form and name.</P>
