<P><A NAME="fn_537"></A><A HREF="sbe01212.htm#fr_539">218:4</A> Upanishasas&acirc;da, instead of upanishas&acirc;da. The mistake is probably due to a correction, sa for sha; the commentator, however, considers it as a Vedic license. Sk&acirc;ro 'dhika<I>s</I> <I>kh</I>&acirc;ndasa<I>h</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_538"></A><A HREF="sbe01212.htm#fr_540">218:5</A> These are meant for the Nishkevalya hymn recited at the noon-libation of the Mah&acirc;vrata. That hymn consists of ten parts, corresponding, as we saw, to ten parts of a bird, viz. its body, neck, head, root of wings, right wing, left wing, tail, belly, chest, and thighs. The verses corresponding to these ten parts, beginning with tad id asa bhuvaneshu <I>g</I>yesh<I>th</I>am, are given in the first &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, and more fully in the fifth &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka by <I>S</I>aunaka. <a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></A> Though they consist of many metres, yet, when one counts the syllables, they give a thousand B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; verses, each consisting of thirty-six syllables.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_539"></A><A HREF="sbe01212.htm#fr_541">219:1</A> Although the Nishkevalya is but one hymn, consisting of eighty t<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as, yet as these eighty t<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as were represented as three kinds of food (see Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 1, 2, 2-4), the hymn is represented as three hymns, first as eighty G&acirc;yatr&icirc; t<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as, then as eighty B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; t<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as, lastly as eighty Ush<I>n</I>ih t<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as.</P>
