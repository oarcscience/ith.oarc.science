<p>1. Let a man meditate on mind as Brahman (n.), this is said with reference to the body. Let a man meditate on the ether as Brahman (n.), this is said with reference to the Devas. Thus both the meditation which has reference to the body, and the meditation which has reference to the Devas, has been taught.</p>  
<p>2. That Brahman (mind) has four feet (quarters).</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Speech is one foot, breath is one foot, the eye is one foot, the car is one foot-so much with reference to the body. Then with reference to the gods, Agni (fire) is one foot, V&acirc;yu (air) is one foot, &Acirc;ditya (sun) is one foot, the quarters are one foot. Thus both the worship which has reference to the body, and the worship which has reference to the Devas, has been taught.</p>  
<p>3. Speech is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with Agni (fire) as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.</p>  
<p>4. Breath is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with V&acirc;yu (air) as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.</p>  
<p>5. The eye is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with &Acirc;ditya (sun) as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.</p>  
<p>6. The ear is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with the quarters as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.</p>
