<p>With this adhy&acirc;ya begins the real Upanishad, best known under the name of the Aitareya-upanishad, and often separately edited, commented on, and translated. If treated separately, what we call the fourth adhy&acirc;ya of the second &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, becomes the first adhy&acirc;ya of the Upanishad, sometimes also, by counting all adhy&acirc;ya from the beginning of the Aitareya-&acirc;ranyaka, the ninth. The divisions adopted by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, who explains the Upanishad as part of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, and by <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara, who explains it independently, vary, though S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a states that he follows in his commentary on the Upanishad the earlier commentary of <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara. I have given the divisions adopted by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, and have marked those of <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara's by figures in parentheses, placed at the end of each paragraph. The difference between this Upanishad and the three preceding adhy&acirc;yas is easily perceived. Hitherto the answer to the question, Whence this world? had been, From Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a meaning breath and life, which was looked upon for a time as a sufficient explanation of all that is. From a psychological point of view this pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is the conscious self (pra<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;tman); in a more mythological form it appears as Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha, 'the golden germ,' sometimes even as Indra. It is one of the chief objects of the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>avidy&acirc;, or life-knowledge, to show that the living principle in us is the same as the living principle in the sun, and that by a recognition of their identity and of the true nature of pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, the devotee, or he who has rightly meditated on pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a during his life, enters after death into the world of Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha.</p>  
<p>This is well expressed in the Kaush&icirc;taki-upanishad III, 2, where Indra says to Pratardana: 'I am Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a; meditate on me as the conscious self (pra<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;tman), as life, as immortality. Life is pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is life. Immortality is pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is immortality. By pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a he obtains immortality in the other world, by knowledge (pra<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;) true conception. Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is consciousness (pra<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;), consciousness is pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a.'</p>  
<p>This, however, though it may have satisfied the mind of the Brahmans for a time, was not a final solution. That final solution of the problem not simply of life, but of existence, is given in the Upanishad which teaches that &Acirc;tman, the Self, and not Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, Life, is the last and only cause of everything. In some places this</p>  
<p><a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="green">p. 237</font></A></p>  
<p>doctrine is laid down in all its simplicity. Our true self, it is said, has its true being in the Highest Self only. In other passages, however, and nearly in the whole of this Upanishad, this simple doctrine is mixed up with much that is mythological, fanciful, and absurd, arthav&acirc;da, as the commentators call it, but as it might often be more truly called, anarthav&acirc;da, and it is only towards the end that the identity of the self-conscious self with the Highest Self or Brahman is clearly enuntiated.</p>

<p>4. That Ambhas (water) is above the heaven, and it is heaven, the support. The Mar&icirc;<I>k</I>is (the lights) are the sky. The Mara (mortal) is the earth, and the waters under the earth are the Ap world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (2)</p>

<p>He then formed the Purusha (the person)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, taking him forth from the water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (3)</p>

From the mouth proceeded speech, from speech Agni (fire)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Nostrils burst forth. From the nostrils proceeded scent (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, from scent V&acirc;yu (air).</p>  
<p>Eyes burst forth. From the eyes proceeded sight, from sight &Acirc;ditya (sun).</p>  
<p>Ears burst forth. From the ears proceeded hearing, from hearing the Di<I>s</I> (quarters of the world),</p>  
<p>Skin burst forth. From the skin proceeded hairs (sense of touch), from the hairs shrubs and trees.</p>  
<p>The heart burst forth. From the heart proceeded mind, from mind <I>K</I>andramas (moon).</p>  
<p>The navel burst forth. From the navel proceeded the Ap&acirc;na (the down-breathing)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, from Ap&acirc;na death.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_584"></A><A HREF="sbe01222.htm#fr_586">237:2</A> Blinking, mishat, i. e. living; cf. Rv. X, 190, 2, vi<I>s</I>vasya mishato va<I>s</I>&icirc;, the lord of all living. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a seems to take mishat as a 3rd pers. sing.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_585"></A><A HREF="sbe01222.htm#fr_587">237:3</A> The names of the four worlds are peculiar. Ambhas means water, and is the name given to the highest world, the waters above the heaven, and heaven itself. Mar&icirc;<I>k</I>is are rays, here used as a name of the sky, antariksha. Mara means dying, and the earth is called so, because all creatures living there must die. Ap is water, here explained as the waters under the earth. The usual division of the world is threefold, earth, sky, and heaven. Here it is fourfold, the fourth division being the water round the earth, or, as the commentator says, under the earth. Ambhas was probably intended for the highest heaven (dyaus), and was then explained both as what is above the heaven and as heaven itself, the support. If we translate, like <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara and Colebrooke, I the water is the region above the heaven which heaven upholds,' we should lose heaven altogether, yet heaven, as the third with sky and earth, is essential in the Indian view of the world.</P>

I have translated it by brooding, though this expresses a part only of the meaning expressed by tap.</P>
