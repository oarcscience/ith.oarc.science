### CHAPTER VIII.

#### SOMA.

<span class="smallcaps">Soma</span>, according to the Vedic hymns, is
the god who "represents and animates the juice of the Soma <span
id="fr_69"></span>[\*](#fn_69) plant." He was the Indian Bacchus. Not
only are all the hymns of the ninth book of the Rig-Veda, one hundred
and fourteen in number, besides a few in other places, dedicated to his
honour, but constant references occur to him in a large proportion of
other hymns. <span id="fr_70"></span>[†](#fn_70) In some of these hymns
he is extolled as the Creator, or Father of the gods. Evidently at that
time he was a most popular deity. Indra, as was stated before, was an
enthusiastic worshipper of Soma.

The following lines will show the warmth of feeling that was cherished
towards him:—

<span class="small">"This Soma is a god; he cures  
 The sharpest ills that man endures.  
 He heals the sick, the sad he cheers,  
 He nerves the weak, dispels their fears;</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The faint with martial ardour fires,  
With lofty thoughts the bard inspires;  
The soul from earth to heaven he lifts;  
So great and wondrous are his gifts,  
Men feel the god within their veins,  
And cry in loud exulting strains:</span>

</div>

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">'We've quaffed the Soma bright  
And are immortal grown:  
We've entered into light,  
And all the gods have known.  
What mortal now can harm,  
Or foeman vex us more?  
Through thee, beyond alarm,  
Immortal god, we soar.'" <span id="fr_71"></span>[\*](#fn_71)</span>

</div>

From the Vedas the following account of Soma is derived. <span
id="fr_72"></span>[†](#fn_72) In some passages the plant is said to have
been brought from a mountain and given to Indra; in others, King Soma is
said to have dwelt amongst the Gandharvas, a race of demi-gods that form
the choir in Indra's heaven. The gods, knowing the virtues of this king
or plant—for the two terms seem to be indiscriminately applied—wished to
obtain it. Not knowing how to get it, Vach (the goddess of speech) said,
"The Gandharvas are fond of women; let me go, and I will obtain it for
you." The gods said, "How can we spare you?" She replied, "Obtain the
god; and I will then return to you, whenever you may want me." Another
account of this affair is, that whilst the gods were living on earth,
Soma was in the sky. Wishing to possess it, they sent Gayatri (a name of
Brahmā's wife or daughter) to fetch it. She went in the form of a bird,
and was returning with it, when the Gandharvas seized it, and only gave
it up when the goddess Vach went amongst them as narrated above.

When Soma was brought to the gods, a dispute arose as to who should have
the first draught. At length, this was decided by a race. Vāyu first
reached the goal, Indra being second. Indra tried hard to win, and when
near the winning post proposed that they should reach it together, Vāyu
taking two-thirds of the drink. Vāyu

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

said, "Not so! I will be the winner alone." Then Indra said, "Let us
come in together, and give me one-fourth of the draught divine!" Vāyu
consented to this, and so the juice was shared between them. <span
id="fr_73"></span>[\*](#fn_73)

Soma is said to have had thirty-three wives, the daughters of Prajāpati;
of these Rohini was the favourite. Being dissatisfied with the
partiality shown to their sister, the other wives returned to their
father. Soma asked that they might come back to him; the father
consented to restore them, provided Soma would treat them all alike.
Soma promised to do this; but, failing to keep his promise, he was
smitten with consumption for breaking his word.

In the verses descriptive and songs in praise of Soma, the actual juice,
and the god supposed to dwell in and manifested by it, are not at all
distinct. All the gods drink of it; and Soma, the god in the juice, is
said to clothe the naked and heal the sick. Many divine attributes are
ascribed to him. He is "addressed as a god in the highest strains of
adulation and veneration. All powers belong to him; all blessings are
besought of him, as his to bestow." He is said to be divine, immortal,
and also to confer immortality on gods and men. "In a passage where the
joys of paradise are more distinctly anticipated and more fervently
implored than in most other parts of the Rig-Veda, Soma is addressed as
the god from whom the gift of future felicity is expected. Thus it is
there said, "Place me, O purified god, in that everlasting and
imperishable world, where there is eternal light and glory. O Indu
(Soma), flow for Indra! Make me immortal in the world where Vaivasvata
lives, where is the universal sphere of the sky, where those great
waters flow." <span id="fr_74"></span>[†](#fn_74)

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

From the hymns addressed to this deity it is evident that at one time it
was considered right for the Hindus to use intoxicants. Now as a rule
they are forbidden. Amongst the members of one branch of the worshippers
of Kāli they are commonly indulged in, but with almost this single
exception, the people do not touch them, and Soma, in his Vedic
character has ceased to be worshipped.

In later years the name Soma was, and still is, given to the moon. How
and why this change took place is not known; but in the later of the
Vedic hymns there is some evidence of the transition. In the following
passage Soma seems to he used in both senses—as god of the intoxicating
juice, and as the moon ruling through the night. " By Soma the Ādityas
are strong; by Soma the earth is great; and Soma is placed in the midst
of the stars. When they crush the plant, he who drinks regards it as
Soma. Of him whom the priests regard as Soma (the moon) no one
drinks." <span id="fr_75"></span>[\*](#fn_75) In another passage this
prayer is found: "May the god Soma, he whom they call the Moon, free
me." Again, "Soma is the moon, the food of the gods." "The sun has the
nature of Agni, the moon of Soma."

In the "Vishnu Purāna" <span id="fr_76"></span>[†](#fn_76) we read,
"Soma was appointed monarch of the stars and plants, of Brāhmans and
plants, of sacrifices and penance." In this Purāna we have quite a
different account of the origin of Soma; but it must be borne in mind
that in this account the term refers only to the moon. At the time the
"Vishnu Purāna" was written, intoxicants were strictly forbidden; hence
Soma, as the god of the intoxicating juice, was no longer known and
praised. According to that Purāna, <span id="fr_77"></span>[‡](#fn_77)

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Soma was the son
of Atri, the son of Brahmā. He performed the Rājasuya sacrifice, and
from the glory-thence acquired, and the immense dominion with which he
had been invested, became so arrogant and licentious, that he carried
off Tārā, the wife of Vrihaspati, the preceptor of the gods. In vain
Vrihaspati sought to recover his bride; in vain Brahmā commanded, and
the holy sages remonstrated. In consequence of this there was a great
war; the gods fighting with Indra on the one side trying to recover
Tārā; Soma with the demons on the other. At length she appealed to
Brahmā for protection, who thereupon commanded Soma to restore her. On
her return, Vrihaspati finding she was pregnant, refused to receive her
until after the birth of her child. In obedience to his orders, the
child was immediately born; who being wonderful in beauty and power,
both Vrihaspati and Soma claimed him as their son. Tārā being referred
to, was too much ashamed to speak. The child was so indignant at this,
that he was about to curse her, saying, "Unless you declare who is my
father, I will sentence you to such a fate as shall deter every female
from hesitating to speak the truth." On this Brahmā again interfered,
pacifying the child, and saying to Tārā, "Tell me, my child, is this the
child of Vrihaspati or Soma?" "Of Soma," she said, blushing. As soon as
she had spoken, the lord of the constellations, his countenance being
bright, embraced his son and said, "Well done, my boy; verily thou art
wise;" and hence his name was Budha. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_69"></span>[69:\*](hmvp12.htm#fr_69) The Soma-plant of the
Rig-Veda is the *Asclepias acida* of Roxburgh. It is a creeping plant,
almost destitute of leaves. It has small white fragrant flowers
collected round the extremities of the branches. Roxburgh says that it
yields purer milky juice than any other plant he knows; and that this
juice is mild, and of an acid nature. The tender shoots are often
plucked by native travellers. It grows on hills of the Punjab, in the
Bolan Pass, in the neighbourhood of Poona, etc. In the Brāhmana of the
Rig-Veda (Haug's Translation), is a most interesting account of the Soma
sacrifice. This is occasionally made in the present day, but very few
priests are acquainted with the ritual of this once celebrated
sacrifice.

Soma, and regent of the planet Mercury, must not be confounded with
Buddha, the teacher whose tenets are held by the Buddhists of the
present day. The two beings have nothing in common; and the names are
identical only when one or other of them is misspelt.
