<p>The incarnation of Parasur&#257;ma, or R&#257;ma with axe, was undertaken by Vishnu for the purpose of exterminating the Kshattriya, or Warrior caste,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> which had tried to assert its authority over the Br&#257;hmanical. Twenty-one times R&#257;ma is said to have cleared the earth of these men, but by various means some few were preserved alive who were able to perpetuate the race.</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The story of this incarnation evidently points to a time when there was a severe and prolonged struggle for supremacy between the members of these two classes. Eventually success lay with the Br&#257;hmans. It should be noticed that the scene of Vishnu's exploits in this Avat&#257;ra, and in those which follow it, was the earth; and not, as in those preceding, the abode of the gods.</p>  
<p>The following legend of the birth of Parasur&#257;ma is from the "Vishnu Pur&#257;na."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> A prince named Gadhi, who was himself an incarnation of Indra, had a daughter named Satyavati. Richika, a descendant of Bhrigu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> demanded her in marriage. The king asked from the decrepit old Br&#257;hman a thousand fleet white horses, each having one black ear, as a wedding present. These horses were obtained, by the help of Varuna, and the Br&#257;hman received the hand of the princess.</p>  
<p>In order to effect the birth of a son, Richika prepared a dish of rice, barley, and pulse, with butter and milk, for his wife to eat, and, at her request, consecrated a similar mixture for her mother, by partaking of which she hoped to give birth to a prince of martial prowess, Leaving both dishes with his wife, after carefully describing which was for herself and which for her mother, the sage went away into the forest. When the time for eating the food came, the mother said to Satyavati, "Daughter! all mothers wish their children to be possessed of excellent qualities, and would be mortified to see them surpassed by the merits of their brother. Give me, therefore, the mess your husband has set apart for you, and you eat that which was intended for me. The son which it is intended to procure for me, is destined to be the monarch of the whole world; whilst that which your dish will give you must be a Br&#257;hman,</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></A></p>  
<p>alike devoid of affluence, valour, and power." Satyavati consented to this proposal, and they exchanged messes.</p>

<p>On Richika's return, perceiving what had happened, he said to his wife, "Sinful woman! what hast thou</p>  
<p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="green">p. 165</font></A></p>  
<p>done? I see thy body of a fearful appearance. Thou hast eaten of the consecrated food that was prepared for thy mother; thou hast done wrong. In that food I had infused the properties of power, and strength, and heroism; in thine, the qualities suited to a Br&#257;hman&#8212;gentleness, knowledge, and resignation. In consequence of having reversed my plans, thy son shall follow a warrior's propensities, and use weapons, and fight, and slay. Thy mother's son shall be born with the inclinations of a Br&#257;hman, and be addicted to peace and piety." Satyavati, hearing this, fell at her husband's feet, and asked that she might not have such a son as he had described; "but if such there must be, let it be my grandson and not my son." The Muni relented, and said, "So be it." Accordingly in due time she gave birth to a son named Jamadagni, who married Renuk&#257;, and had by her the destroyer of the Kshattriya race, Parasur&#257;ma, who was a portion of N&#257;r&#257;yana, the spiritual guide of the universe.</p>  
<p>This is all we find about Parasur&#257;ma's work in the "Vishnu Pur&#257;na." The story of his exploits is told at length twice over in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, and is found in the Bh&#257;gavata, Padma, and Agni Pur&#257;nas. The following account is from the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Jamadagni, the son of Richika (whose birth was just described), having married Renuk&#257;, "conducted the princess to his hermitage, and she was contented to partake in his ascetic life. They had four sons, and then a fifth, who was Jamadagnya (Parasur&#257;ma), the last, but not the least, of the brethren. Once when her sons were absent gathering the fruits on which they fed, Renuk&#257;, who was exact in the discharge of all her duties, went forth to bathe. On her way to the stream</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="green">p. 166</font></A></p>  
<p>she beheld Chitraratha, the Prince of Mrittik&#257;vati, with a garland of lotuses on his neck, sporting with his queen in the water, and she felt envious of their felicity. Defiled by unworthy thoughts, wetted, but not purified by the stream, she returned disquieted to the hermitage. Beholding her fallen from her perfection, and shorn of the lustre of her sanctity, Jamadagni reproved her, and was exceeding wroth.</p>  
<p>"Upon this, her sons came from the wood, and each as he entered was successively commended by his father to put his mother to death; but, amazed and influenced by natural affection, neither of them made any reply; therefore Jamadagni cursed them, and they became idiots. Lastly R&#257;ma returned to the hermitage, when the mighty and holy Jamadagni said to him, 'Kill thy mother, who has sinned; and do it without repining.' R&#257;ma accordingly took up his axe [this was the Parasu, or axe, which Siva had given him] and struck off his mother's head; whereupon the wrath of Jamadagni was assuaged, and, pleased with his son, said: 'Since thou hast obeyed my commands, and done what was hard to be performed, demand from me whatever blessing thou wilt, and thy desires shall be fulfilled.' R&#257;ma begged these boons: the restoration of his mother to life, with forgetfulness of having been slain, and purification from all defilement; the return of his brothers to their natural condition; and for himself, invincibility in single combat, and length of days. All these his father bestowed.</p>  
<p>"It happened on one occasion that, during the absence of the Rishi's sons, the mighty monarch K&#257;rttavirya, the sovereign of the Haihaya tribe, endowed by the favour of Dattatreya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> with a thousand arms, and a</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="green">p. 167</font></A></p>  
<p>golden chariot that went wheresoever he willed it to go, came to the hermitage of Jamadagni, where the wife of the sage received him with proper respect. This K&#257;rttavirya, by reason of his strength, had greatly oppressed the gods, Rishis, and all creatures. The gods and Rishis applied to Vishnu, who, with Indra, devised the means of destroying him. The king, inflated with the pride of valour, made no return for the hospitality of the Rishi's wife; but carried off with him the calf of the milch cow of the sacred oblation, and cast down the tall trees of the hermitage."</p>  
<p>In the R&#257;m&#257;yana is an account of the wonderful cow whose calf this king stole. When commanded by her owner, on the occasion of the visit of a king to the hermitage, to supply the varied wants of the great multitude which accompanied him&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"'The cow from whom all plenty flows,<br> &nbsp;Obedient to her saintly lord,<br> &nbsp;Viands to suit each taste outpoured.<br> &nbsp;Honey she gave, and roasted grain,<br> &nbsp;Mead sweet with flowers, and sugar-cane.<br> &nbsp;Each beverage of flavour rare,<br> &nbsp;And food of every sort, were there:<br> &nbsp;Hills of hot rice, and sweetened cakes,<br> &nbsp;And curdled milk, and soup in lakes.<br> &nbsp;Vast beakers flowing to the brim<br> &nbsp;With sugared drink prepared for him;<br> &nbsp;And dainty sweetmeats, deftly made,<br> &nbsp;Before the hermit's guests were laid.'</small></div></p>  
<p>"When R&#257;ma returned, his father told him what had happened; and seeing the cow in distress, he was filled with wrath. Taking up his splendid bow, he assailed K&#257;rttavirya, and overthrew him in battle. With sharp arrows R&#257;ma cut off his thousand arms, and he perished. The sons of K&#257;rttavirya, to avenge their father's death,</p>  
<p><a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="green">p. 168</font></A></p>  
<p>attacked the hermitage of Jamadagni when R&#257;ma was absent, and slew the pious and unresisting sage, who called repeatedly, but fruitlessly, upon his valiant son. R&#257;ma deeply lamented his father's death, performed the last obsequies, and lighted the funeral pile. He then made a vow that he would extirpate the whole Kshattriya race. In fulfilment of which, with remorseless and fatal rage, he destroyed the sons of K&#257;rttavirya; and, after them, whatever Kshattriyas he encountered. Thrice seven times&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> did he clear the earth of the Kshattriya caste. After he had cleared the world of Kshattriyas, their widows came to the Br&#257;hmans, praying for offspring. The religious Br&#257;hmans, free from any impulse of lust, cohabited with these women, who, in consequence, brought forth valiant Kshattriya boys and girls."</p>  
<p>In another passage in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata it is taught that it was in consequence of the curse of a sage named Apava, that R&#257;ma was able to kill K&#257;rttavirya. The king had permitted Agni to devour the hermitage of this Rishi, who, in revenge, declared that his thousand arms should be cut off by Parasur&#257;ma.</p>  
<p>In the R&#257;m&#257;yana is an interesting legend in which Parasur&#257;ma, himself an incarnation of Vishnu, is described as meeting with R&#257;ma Chandra, the next avat&#257;ra of the same deity, and in which the superiority of R&#257;ma Chandra is declared.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> "As King Dasaratha was returning to his capital with R&#257;ma (Chandra), he was alarmed by the ill-omened sounds uttered by certain birds. The</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="green">p. 169</font></A></p>  
<p>alarming event indicated was the arrival of Parasur&#257;ma. He was fearful to behold, brilliant as fire, and bore his axe and a bow on his shoulder. Being received with honour, he proceeded to say to R&#257;ma, the son of Dasaratha, that he had heard of his prowess in breaking the bow produced by Janaka, and had brought another which he asked him to bend, and to fit an arrow on the string; and offered, if he succeeded in doing so, to engage with him in single combat. Parasur&#257;ma went on to say that the bow R&#257;ma had broken was Siva's; but that the one he now brought was Vishnu's. The gods, anxious to discover which was the greater, Siva or Vishnu, and considering this a favourable opportunity for doing so, sought Brahm&#257;'s help. He thereupon excited the passions of the two R&#257;mas. A great fight ensued. Siva's bow of dreadful power was relaxed, and the three-eyed Mah&#257;deva was arrested by a muttering. The gods were satisfied, and judged Vishnu to be superior. Parasur&#257;ma, however, did not agree to their judgment, so offered Vishnu's bow for his antagonist to try his strength on. Thus challenged, R&#257;ma snatches the bow, bends it, and fits an arrow to the string; and then tells his challenger that as he is a Br&#257;hman he will not slay him, but will either take away his superhuman capacity of movement, or deprive him of the blessed abodes he had gained by austerity. Parasur&#257;ma entreats that his power of movement may not be taken away, but consents that his blissful abodes may be destroyed. 'By bending this bow,' he said, 'I recognize thee to be the imperishable slayer of Madhu, the great lord.' R&#257;ma shoots the arrow, and destroys Parasur&#257;ma's abodes."</p>  
<p>The explanation of this strange legend seems to be the one that is commonly received by Oriental scholars, that the passages in the Epic poems which speak of R&#257;ma as</p>  
<p><a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170</font></A></p>  
<p>an incarnation of Vishnu are interpolations of a later date than the original poem; and this interview of Parasur&#257;ma with R&#257;ma Chandra was introduced for the purpose of giving a quasi-divine sanction to the teaching of these interpolations. If Parasur&#257;ma, an admitted incarnation of Vishnu, acknowledged that R&#257;ma was superior to himself, what stronger proof could be given that R&#257;ma too was divine?</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_158"></A><A HREF="hmvp24.htm#fr_158">162:*</A> There are four chief castes or j&#257;tis of Hindus: the Br&#257;hman, or Priestly; the Kshattriya, or Warrior; the Vaisya, or Merchant; and the Sudra, or Servant. These four classes are commonly said to have sprung respectively from the head, arms, thighs, and feet of the Creator, though there is good reason for the belief that in the olden time no such ideas of the divine origin of caste prevailed. The four original castes have become subdivided into an immense number. This subdivision has been brought about by inter-marriage with members of other classes.</P>
