<p>they consented, and "begot in countless swarms brave sons disguised in sylvan forms." Of Sugriva it is said&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That noblest fire,<br> The Sun, was great Sugriva's sire."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>When R&#257;ma finds this King of the Monkeys, he was an exile, having been driven from his throne by his brother B&#257;li. Kabandha, a giant slain by R&#257;ma, gives the following description of the king to the wandering hero:&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"O R&#257;ma, hear my words and seek<br> &nbsp;Sugriva, for of him I speak.<br> &nbsp;His brother B&#257;li, Indra's son,<br> &nbsp;Expelled him, when the fight he won.<br> &nbsp;With four great chieftains, faithful still,<br> &nbsp;He dwells on Rishyanuka's hill.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> &nbsp;Lord of the V&#257;nars, just and true,<br> &nbsp;Strong, very glorious, bright to view,<br> &nbsp;Unmatched in counsel, firm and meek,<br> &nbsp;Bound by each word his lips may speak,<br> &nbsp;Good, splendid, mighty, bold and brave,<br> &nbsp;Wise in each plan to guide and save.<br> &nbsp;His brother, fired by lust of sway,<br> &nbsp;Drove forth the king in woods to stray;<br> &nbsp;In all thy search for Sit&#257;, he<br> &nbsp;Thy ready friend and help will be."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>R&#257;ma discovers his retreat, hears the story of his wrongs, promises to slay <A HREF="errata.htm#2">B&#257;li</A>, the usurper, and assist Sugriva to regain his throne; Sugriva on his part</p>

<p>solemnly promises to aid R&#257;ma in his search and to enable him to release Sit&#257; from R&#257;vana's bonds. R&#257;ma very soon fulfils his part of the compact. He marches with Sugriva and the others to B&#257;li's city; Sugriva challenges <A HREF="errata.htm#3">B&#257;li</A> to fight, and just as he is getting the worst of it, R&#257;ma lets fly his arrow, which gives B&#257;li his mortal wound. Ere this chief dies, he strongly reproves R&#257;ma for slaying one who had never harmed him and for slaying him too in a secret and cowardly manner. He asks&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"What fame, from one thon hast not slain<br> &nbsp;In front of battle, canst thou gain,<br> &nbsp;Whose secret hand has laid me low,<br> &nbsp;When madly fighting with my foe?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> &nbsp;I held that thou wouldst surely scorn<br> &nbsp;To strike me as I fought my foe,<br> &nbsp;And thought not of a stranger's blow.<br> &nbsp;But now thine evil heart is shown,<br> &nbsp;A yawning well, with grass o&#8217;ergrown.<br> &nbsp;Thou wearest virtue's badge,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> but guile<br> &nbsp;And meanest sin thy soul defile."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>R&#257;ma reminds B&#257;li that Fate had ordained his death, against which it was useless to contend, with which statement B&#257;li agrees, and, withdrawing his unkind words, asks for R&#257;ma's forgiveness.</p>  
<p>On the death of B&#257;li, Sugriva is again installed as King of the V&#257;nars, and R&#257;ma gives him four months for the enjoyment of his long-lost wife and kingdom. At its expiration, as Sugriva appeared to be so absorbed with pleasure as to forget his engagement to assist R&#257;ma, Lakshman reminds him of his duty in no measured terms. At length the order is given to collect the forces. An army of monkeys, bears, etc., goes forth in search of Sita,</p>

<p>who, it is discovered, is somewhere in the southern district over which Hanum&#257;n is supposed to rule, who after diligent inquiry learns her whereabouts. The army marches to the seashore; a bridge connecting the island of Lanka (Ceylon) with the mainland is erected by Nala, and the attacking army surrounds the city. No sooner were they in sight of the city of the foe than</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> They continue to fight with uncertain result until R&#257;vana calls to his aid his magical arts&#8212;</p>

<p>In the course of the great fight, a giant named Kumbhakarna, a brother of R&#257;vana, came forth from the city and did great execution amongst the V&#257;nar host, devouring his victims as fast as they were slain, though they were numbered by thousands. Some idea of the size of this monster may be gained from the fact that</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"There was no respite then, no pause:<br> &nbsp;Fast gaped and closed his hell-like jaws:<br> &nbsp;Yet prisoned in that gloomy cave,<br> &nbsp;Some V&#257;nars still their lives could save;<br> &nbsp;Some through his nostrils found a way,<br> &nbsp;Some through his ears resought the day."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> B&#257;li's son Angad tried to rally the V&#257;nar host, but he was soon dashed senseless on the ground." Hanum&#257;n had already been severely wounded by the monster. And now he attacks Sugriva, who hurled a hill at him, but</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"The giant's chest the stroke repelled."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> This compliment the monster returns by throwing his spear, which Hanum&#257;n caught as it flew, and broke it across his knee. Then</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"At Sugriva's head he sent<br> &nbsp;A peak from Lanka's mountain rent.<br> &nbsp;The rushing mass no might could stay:<br> &nbsp;Sugriva fell, and senseless lay.<br> &nbsp;The giant stooped his foe to seize,<br> &nbsp;And bore him thence, as bears the breeze<br> &nbsp;A cloud in autumn through the sky."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A></small></div></p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The giant enters Lanka with his captive, and is greatly lauded by the people; but his triumph was of short duration, for</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"By slow degrees the V&#257;nars' lord<br> &nbsp;Felt life, and sense, and strength restored.<br> &nbsp;He heard the giant's joyful boast:<br> &nbsp;He thought upon his V&#257;nar host.<br> &nbsp;His teeth and feet he fiercely plied,<br> &nbsp;And bit and rent the giant's side,<br> &nbsp;Who, mad with pain and smeared with gore,<br> &nbsp;Hurled to the ground the load he bore.<br> &nbsp;Regardless of a storm of blows,<br> &nbsp;Swift to the sky the V&#257;nar rose,<br> &nbsp;Then lightly, like a flying ball,<br> &nbsp;High overleapt the city wall."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>Lakshman tried to slay this monster; but it was left for R&#257;ma to finish the work, whose arrows cut off limb after limb, and at last severed head from body. After his death, two brothers, Nikumbha and Kumbha, came forth to do battle for their chief. Sugriva seized Kumbha and hurled him into the sea; on his reaching the shore he struck Sugriva such a blow on his chest that he broke his own wrist with the shock. Sugriva returned the blow by another beneath the neck, which proved fatal. His brother now attacked Sugriva;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"And red with fury flashed his eye.<br> &nbsp;He dashed with mighty sway and swing<br> &nbsp;His axe against the V&#257;nar king;<br> &nbsp;But shattered on that living rock,<br> &nbsp;It split in fragments at the shock.<br> &nbsp;Sugriva, rising to the blow,<br> &nbsp;Raised his huge hand and smote his foe,<br> &nbsp;And in the dust the giant lay,<br> &nbsp;Gasping in blood his soul away."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_373"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></small></div></p>

<p>Sugriva and his heroic army continued faithful to their king's promise until R&#257;ma's victory was won, though death had considerably thinned their ranks; but this loss was made good as, in answer to R&#257;ma's prayer, Yama gave up the whole of the V&#257;nars who had died in the struggle. When R&#257;ma was about to return home in the magic car, Sugriva asked that he and the V&#257;nar chiefs might accompany him to his capital. Their request being granted, they took part in the installation of R&#257;ma as king, and received from that grateful monarch rich presents as a reward for their faithful service.</p>  <h5 align="center">2. HANUM&#256;N.</h5>  
<p>Hanum&#257;n, on the whole the most useful of the Monkey leaders of the expedition to Ceylon, was the son of V&#257;yu, by a V&#257;nar or monkey mother. "His birth is thus described&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"An Apsaras, the fairest found<br> &nbsp;Of nymphs, for heavenly charms renowned,<br> &nbsp;Sweet Punjikasthal&#257;, became<br> &nbsp;A noble V&#257;nar's wedded dame.<br> &nbsp;Her heavenly title heard no more,<br> &nbsp;Anjan&#257; was the name she bore,<br> &nbsp;When, cursed by gods, from heaven she fell,<br> &nbsp;In V&#257;nar form on earth to dwell.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> &nbsp;In youthful beauty wondrous fair,<br> &nbsp;A crown of flowers about her hair.<br> &nbsp;In silken robes of richest dye,<br> &nbsp;She roamed the hills that kiss the sky.<br> &nbsp;Once in her tinted garments dressed,<br> &nbsp;She stood upon the mountain crest.<br> &nbsp;The god of wind beside her came,<br> &nbsp;And breathed upon the lovely dame;<br> &nbsp;And as he fanned her robe aside,<br> &nbsp;The wondrous beauty that he eyed,</small></div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>&nbsp;In rounded lines of breast and limb,<br> &nbsp;And neck and shoulders, ravished him,<br> &nbsp;And captured by her peerless charms,<br> &nbsp;He strained her in his amorous arms.<br> &nbsp;Then to the eager god she cried,<br> &nbsp;In trembling accents, terrified,<br> &nbsp;'Whose impious love has wronged a spouse<br> &nbsp;So constant to her nuptial vows?'</small></div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>&nbsp;He heard, and thus his answer made:<br> &nbsp;'Oh, be not troubled, nor afraid,<br> &nbsp;But trust, and thou shalt know ere long<br> &nbsp;My love has done thee, sweet, no wrong.<br> &nbsp;So strong, and brave, and wise shall be<br> &nbsp;The glorious son I give to thee;<br> &nbsp;Might shall be his, that nought can tire,<br> &nbsp;And limbs to spring as springs his sire.'</small></div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> &nbsp;Thus spoke the god: the conquered dame<br> &nbsp;Rejoiced in heart, nor feared the shame."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_374"></A><A HREF="#fn_374"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>At length the son was born. When a child, seeing the sun rising, and thinking it to be the fruit of a tree, he sprang up three hundred leagues to clutch it. On another occasion Indra let a bolt fly at him which caused him to fall violently on a rock. The fall shattered his cheek, and hence the name Hanum&#257;n, the long-jawed one, was given to him. His father seeing this became angry, and the breezes ceased to blow, until the gods in terror came to appease V&#257;yu: Brahm&#257; promised that this boy should not be slain in battle, and Indra declared that his bolts should never injure him in the future.</p>  
<p>The Monkey leader rendered most valuable service to R&#257;ma. It was he who discovered Sita's abode, and carried a message to her from R&#257;ma. It was he who set fire to Lanka and caused fear to enter the hearts of the R&#257;kshasas dwelling there. It was he who bore R&#257;ma on his shoulders as he crossed over from India to Lanka. Hanum&#257;n thus speaks of his wondrous power:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Sprung from that glorious Father, I<br> &nbsp;In power and speed with him may vie.<br> &nbsp;A thousand times, with airy leap,<br> &nbsp;Can circle loftiest Meru's steep:<br> &nbsp;With my fierce arms can stir the sea<br> &nbsp;Till from their beds the waters flee,<br> &nbsp;And rush at my command to drown<br> &nbsp;This land with grove and tower and town.<br> &nbsp;I through the fields of air can spring<br> &nbsp;Far swifter than the feathered king,<br> &nbsp;And leap before him as he flies<br> &nbsp;On sounding pinions through the skies.<br> &nbsp;I can pursue the Lord of Light<br> &nbsp;Uprising from the eastern height,</small></div></p>

<p>All these powers he devoted to the service of R&#257;ma; for, when that hero and his brother were wounded in the fight, and nothing else could restore them, Hanum&#257;n fled to the Himalayas from Ceylon, and returned almost immediately with the medicinal herbs that grew there, though, on reaching the hills, he had some difficulty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> in finding them:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"But when he thought to seize the prize,<br> &nbsp;They hid them from his eager eyes.<br> &nbsp;Then to the hill in wrath he spake:<br> &nbsp;Mine arm this day shall vengeance take<br> &nbsp;If thou wilt feel no pity, none,<br> &nbsp;In this great need of Raghu's son.'<br> &nbsp;He ceased: his mighty arms he bent,<br> &nbsp;And from the trembling mountain rent<br> &nbsp;His huge head, with the life it bore,<br> &nbsp;Snakes, elephants, and golden ore.<br> &nbsp;O&#8217;er hill and plain and watery waste<br> &nbsp;His rapid way again he traced,<br> &nbsp;And mid the wondering V&#257;nars laid<br> &nbsp;His burden, through the air conveyed.</small></div></p>

"The chief of the monkeys, measureless, seeking to acquire grammar, looking up to the sun, bent on inquiry, go went from the mountain where the sun rises to that where he sets, apprehending the mighty collection. The chief of the monkeys is perfect: no one equals him in the S&#257;stras, in learning, and in ascertaining the sense of the Scriptures. In all sciences, in the rules of austerity, he rivals the preceptor of the gods."</p>  
<p>R&#257;ma himself thus speaks of Hanum&#257;n's knowledge of the Scriptures, when he came to the exile as Sugriva's envoy:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One whose words so sweetly flow,<br> &nbsp;The whole Rig-Veda needs must know,<br> &nbsp;And in his well-trained memory store<br> &nbsp;The Yajush and the S&#257;man's lore.<br> &nbsp;He must have bent his faithful ear<br> &nbsp;All grammar's varied rules to hear.<br> &nbsp;For his long speech how well he spoke!<br> &nbsp;In all its length no rule he broke."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_379"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>To this day Hanum&#257;n is regarded as divine, and in some parts of India is largely worshipped. Living monkeys are regarded as his representatives: hence many temples swarm with them, and it is regarded a meritorious act to feed them, and a sacrilegious act to injure them.</p>

<p>Nala, another of the monkey chiefs, was a son of Visvakarma; and as the son of the architect of the gods, the builder of their beautiful cities, and the forger of their wonder-working weapons, as might have been expected, his work was of a similar nature to that for which his illustrious parent was celebrated. When the army reached the sea, and the difficulty of crossing to Lanka presented itself, as R&#257;ma was preparing to shoot one of his mighty arrows to dry up the ocean, the Sea Deity presented himself, amidst a great commotion of the elements, and thus addressed him:</p>

<p>His first word of advice was this, that R&#257;ma, instead of shooting at the sea, should direct his arrow towards the North, to destroy a race of demons who were hateful to him, and then he went on to say&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Now let a wondrous task be done<br> &nbsp;By Nala, Visvakarma's son,</small></div></p>

<p>Nala declares that he has the will and power to accomplish this great and necessary work; and as an encouragement to R&#257;ma to believe that he will complete it, said&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"My mother, ere she bore her son,<br> &nbsp;This boon from Visvakarma won:<br> &nbsp;'O Mandar&#299;, this child shall be<br> &nbsp;In skill and glory next to me.'<br> &nbsp;But why unbidden should I fill<br> &nbsp;Thine ear with praises of my skill?<br> &nbsp;Command the V&#257;nar hosts to lay<br> &nbsp;Foundations for the bridge to-day."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>R&#257;ma trusts Nala's skill, and orders the V&#257;nars to bring materials for the bridge:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Up sprang the V&#257;nars from their rest,<br> &nbsp;The mandate of the king obeyed,<br> &nbsp;And sought the forest's mighty shade.<br> &nbsp;Uprooted trees to earth they threw,<br> &nbsp;And to the sea the timber drew.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> &nbsp;With mighty engines piles of stone<br> &nbsp;And seated hills were overthrown:<br> &nbsp;Imprisoned waters sprang on high,<br> &nbsp;In rain descending from the sky:<br> &nbsp;And ocean with a roar and swell<br> &nbsp;Heaved wildly when the mountains fell.<br> &nbsp;Then the great bridge of wondrous strength<br> &nbsp;Was built, a hundred leagues in length.<br> &nbsp;Rocks, huge as autumn clouds, bound fast<br> &nbsp;With cordage from the shore, were cast,</small></div></p>

<p>This chief is said to have sprung from Agni, and is described as</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bright as flame,<br> &nbsp;Who in his splendour, might, and worth,<br> &nbsp;Surpassed the sire who gave him birth."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_385"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>Though thus eulogized, no very special feats of his are recorded in the R&#257;m&#257;yana. He held a post of honour as the leader of a division of the army, and his special work appears to have been to provide sentries, and generally to guard the forces of Sugriva from the sudden attacks of the enemy. As the son of Agni he was able to see clearly, and by his watchfulness rendered good service.</p>  <h5 align="center">5. SUSHENA.</h5>  
<p>Varuna aided R&#257;ma by the gift of this leader, who was the father of T&#257;r&#257;, the wife of B&#257;li, Sugriva's brother and the usurper of his throne. To him was</p>

<p>given the command of the army of the West. Sugriva, addressing him, said&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Two hundred thousand of our best<br> &nbsp;With thee, my lord, shall seek the West."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_386"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>After searching in vain for traces of the missing princess, he and the other unsuccessful leaders returned to R&#257;ma and Sugriva, and said&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"On every hill our steps have been,<br> &nbsp;By wood, and cave, and deep ravine;<br> &nbsp;And all the wandering brooks we know,<br> &nbsp;Throughout the land that seaward flow;<br> &nbsp;Our feet by thy command have traced<br> &nbsp;The tangled thicket and the waste,<br> &nbsp;And dens and dingles hard to pass<br> &nbsp;For creeping plants and matted grass."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_387"></A><A HREF="#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>Though they could not learn the exact spot where Sit&#257; was hidden, they discovered that she had been carried towards the South, the quarter under Hanum&#257;n's special charge, and thus considerably narrowed the sphere of the quest. In the great encounter with the foe, Sushena did good service; for when R&#257;ma and Lakshman were overcome by Indrajit's magical noose, Sugriva and his comrades were greatly distressed. The V&#257;nar king, however, being aware that Garuda could release them from the spell by which they were bound, told Sushena, when they regained their strength and senses, to fly with them to Kishkindha hermitage, where they could dwell in safety, whilst he himself fought against R&#257;vana, and rescued the royal lady. Then Sushena, as the physician, said&#8212;</p>

K&#257;lanemi, an uncle of R&#257;vana, was promised the half of the kingdom if he would slay Hanum&#257;n. To effect this, he went to the Himalayas and, disguised as a devotee, invited Hanum&#257;n to eat with him. Hanum&#257;n refused; but on entering a tank near, a crocodile seized his foot. This reptile Hanum&#257;n dragged out of the tank and killed it, from whose body a lovely Apsaras arose, whom Daksha had cursed to live in that form until her release was accomplished by Hanum&#257;n. This nymph, in gratitude for his kindness, warned Hanum&#257;n of his danger. The monkey god went to K&#257;lanemi, and telling him that he saw through his disguise, took him by the feet, and whirled him through the air to Lanka, where he fell before the throne in R&#257;vana's palace.</P>
