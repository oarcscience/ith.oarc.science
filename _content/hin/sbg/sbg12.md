### SEVENTH CHAPTER

The Blessed Lord said:

1\. With the mind intent on Me, O son of Prithâ, taking refuge in Me,
and practising Yoga, how thou shalt without doubt know Me fully, that do
thou hear. <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161)

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

2\. I shall tell you in full, of knowledge, speculative and practical,
knowing which, nothing more here remains to be known.

3\. One, perchance, in thousands of men, strives for perfection; and one
perchance, among the blessed ones, striving thus, knows Me in
reality. <span id="fr_162"></span>[3](#fn_162)

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

4\. Bhumi (earth), Ap (water), Anala (fire), Vâyu (air), Kha (ether),
mind, intellect, and egoism: thus is My Prakriti divided
eight-fold. <span id="fr_163"></span>[4](#fn_163)

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

5\. This is the lower (Prakriti). But different from it, know thou, O
mighty-armed, My higher Prakriti—the principle of self-consciousness, by
which this universe is sustained.

6\. Know that these (two Prakritis) are the womb of all beings. I am the
origin and dissolution of the whole universe. <span
id="fr_164"></span>[6](#fn_164)

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

7\. Beyond Me, O Dhananjaya, there is naught. All this is strung in Me,
as a row of jewels on a thread. <span id="fr_165"></span>[7](#fn_165)

8\. I am the sapidity in waters, O son of Kunti; I, the radiance in the
moon and the sun; I am the Om in all the Vedas, sound in Akâsha, and
manhood in men. <span id="fr_166"></span>[8](#fn_166)

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

9\. I am the sweet fragrance in earth, and the brilliance in fire am I;
the life in all beings, and the austerity am I in ascetics.

10\. Know Me, O son of Prithâ, as the eternal seed of all beings. I am
the intellect of the intelligent, and the heroism of the heroic.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

11\. Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment. I
am, O bull among the Bhâratas, desire in beings, unopposed to
Dharma. <span id="fr_167"></span>[11](#fn_167)

12\. And whatever states pertaining to Sattva, and those pertaining to
Rajas, and to Tamas, know them to proceed from Me alone; still I am not
in them, but they are in Me. <span id="fr_168"></span>[12](#fn_168)

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

13\. Deluded by these states, the modifications of the three Gunas (of
Prakriti), all this world does not know Me, beyond them, and immutable.

14\. Verily, this divine illusion of Mine, constituted of the Gunas, is
difficult to cross over; those who devote themselves to Me alone, cross
over this illusion. <span id="fr_169"></span>[14](#fn_169)

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

15\. They do not devote themselves to Me,—the evil-doers, the deluded,
the lowest of men, deprived of discrimination by Mâyâ, and following the
way of the Asuras. <span id="fr_170"></span>[15](#fn_170)

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

16\. Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna,—the distressed,
the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of enjoyment, and the wise, O bull
among the Bhâratas. <span id="fr_171"></span>[16](#fn_171)

17\. Of them, the wise man, ever-steadfast, (and fired) with devotion to
the One, excels; for supremely dear am I to the wise, and he is dear to
Me.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

18\. Noble indeed are they all, but the wise man I regard as My very
Self; for with the mind steadfast, he is established in Me alone, as the
supreme goal.

19\. At the end of many births, the man of wisdom takes refuge in Me,
realising that all this is Vâsudeva (the innermost Self). Very rare is
that great soul.

20\. Others again, deprived of discrimination by this or that desire,
following this or that rite, devote themselves to other gods, led by
their own natures. <span id="fr_172"></span>[20](#fn_172)

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

21\. Whatsoever form any devotee seeks to worship with Shraddhâ,—that
Shraddhâ of his do I make unwavering.

22\. Endued with that Shraddhâ, he engages in the worship of that, and
from it, gains his desires,—these being verily dispensed by Me alone.

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

23\. But the fruit (accruing) to these men of little understanding is
limited. The worshippers of the Devas go to the Devas; My devotees too
come to me. <span id="fr_173"></span>[23](#fn_173)

24\. The foolish regard Me, the un-manifested, as come into
manifestation, not knowing My supreme state,—immutable and
transcendental. <span id="fr_174"></span>[24](#fn_174)

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

25\. Veiled by the illusion born of the congress of the Gunas, I am not
manifest to all. This deluded world knows Me not, the Unborn, the
Immutable. <span id="fr_175"></span>[25](#fn_175)

26\. I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the whole past, and the present,
and the future, but Me none knoweth.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

27\. By the delusion of the pairs of opposites, arising from desire and
aversion, O descendant of Bharata, all beings fall into delusion at
birth, O scorcher of foes. <span id="fr_176"></span>[27](#fn_176)

28\. Those men of virtuous deeds, whose sin has come to an end,—they,
freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me with firm
resolve.

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

29\. Those who strive for freedom from old age and death, taking refuge
in Me, they know. Brahman, the whole of Adhyâtma, and Karma in its
entirety. <span id="fr_177"></span>[29](#fn_177)

30\. Those who know Me with the Adhibhuta, the Adhidaiva, and the
Adhiyajna, (continue to) know Me even at the time of death, steadfast in
mind. <span id="fr_178"></span>[30](#fn_178)

 

The end of the seventh chapter, designated <span class="smallcaps">The
Way of Knowledge with Realisation</span>.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_161"></span>[163:1](sbg12.htm#fr_161) *Fully*, *i.e.*,
possessed of infinite greatness, strength, power, grace, and other
infinite attributes.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[164:3](sbg12.htm#fr_162) *The Blessed:*
Siddhânâm—this word literally means the perfected ones—but here it means
only those who having acquired good Karma in a past incarnation, strive
for freedom in this life.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[165:4](sbg12.htm#fr_163) The *raison d’être*
of this reduction of matter into five elements is quite different from
that conceived by modern science. Man has five senses only, just five
ways in which he can be affected by matter, therefore his perception of
matter cannot be divided further. The five elements are of two kinds,
subtle and gross. The gross state is said 'to be formed by taking half
of a subtle element, and adding ⅛th to it, of each of the rest: *e.g.*,
gross Akâsha = ½ subtle Akâsha + ⅛th subtle Vâyu + ⅛th subtle Tejas +
⅛th subtle Ap + ⅛th subtle Bhumi: Then again, the ether, air, light,
water, and earth of modern science, do not answer to the five elements
of Hindu philosophy. Akâsha is just the sound-producing agency. From
Akâsha rises Vâyu, having the properties of sound and touch. From Vâyu
springs Tejas, possessing the property of visibility, as well as those
of its predecessors. From Tejas rises Ap, combining with the above
properties its distinctive feature,—flavour. Bhumi comes from Ap,
bringing the additional property of smell to its inheritance.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[166:6](sbg12.htm#fr_164) *I am the origin
&c.:* In Me the whole universe originates and dissolves, as everything
springs froth My Prakriti.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[167:7](sbg12.htm#fr_165) *Beyond Me*—there is
no other cause of the universe but Me.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[167:8](sbg12.htm#fr_166) In Me as essence, all
these are woven, as being My manifestations.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[169:11](sbg12.htm#fr_167) *Desire—Kâma:*
thirst for objects not present to the senses.

*Attachment—Râga:* for those presented to the senses .

*Unopposed to Dharma:* the desire which moves in harmony with the
ordained duties of life.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[169:12](sbg12.htm#fr_168) All things are in
Him, yet not He in them. Logically, this can' only happen in
superimposition through illusion: as that of a ghost seen in the stump
of a tree; the ghost is in the stump, from the point of view of the man
in the dark, but the stump is never <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> in
the ghost. Similarly the universe is superimposed on the Lord, seen in
His place through Mâyâ, but He is not in it. The Lord returns to the
same teaching in Chap. IX. 4, 5.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[170:14](sbg12.htm#fr_169) <span
id="page_171">p. 171</span> *Divine:* transcending human perception.

*Devote . . . alone:* Abandoning all formal religion (Dharma) completely
take refuge in Me, their own Self, the Lord of illusion.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[171:15](sbg12.htm#fr_170) *Way of the Asuras*,
*i.e.*, cruelty, untruth, and the like.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[172:16](sbg12.htm#fr_171) *Seeker of
enjoyment:* One who wishes for objects of enjoyment, both here and
hereafter.

*The Wise:* One who has forsaken all desires, knowing them to arise from
Mâyâ.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[173:20](sbg12.htm#fr_172) *Own natures:*
Samskâras acquired in previous lives.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[175:23](sbg12.htm#fr_173) *These men of little
understanding:* Though the amount of exertion is the same (in the two
kinds of worship), these people do not take refuge in Me, by doing which
they may attain infinite results.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[175:24](sbg12.htm#fr_174) The ignorant take Me
as an ordinary mortal, assuming embodiment from the unmanifested state,
like all other men, being impelled by the force of past Karma. This is
due to their ignorance of My real nature; hence they do not worship Me,
the One without a second.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[176:25](sbg12.htm#fr_175) This Yoga-Mâyâ
spread over the Lord, which veils the understanding of others in
recognising Him, does not obscure His own knowledge, as it is His, and
He is the wielder of it,—just as the glamour (Mâyâ) caused by a juggler
(Mâyâvin) does not obstruct his own knowledge. This illusion which binds
others, cannot dim His vision.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[177:27](sbg12.htm#fr_176) To one whose mind is
subject to the dualistic delusion, caused by the passions of desire and
aversion, there cannot indeed arise a knowledge of things as they are,
even of the external world; far less can such an intellect grasp the
transcendental knowledge of the innermost Self.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[178:29](sbg12.htm#fr_177) (*They know*) *the
whole of Adhyâtma:* They realise in full the Reality underlying the
innermost individual Self.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[178:30](sbg12.htm#fr_178) Their consciousness
of Me continues as ever, unaffected by the change of approaching death.
