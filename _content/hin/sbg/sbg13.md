### EIGHTH CHAPTER

Arjuna said:

1\. What is that Brahman, what is Adhyâtma, what is Karma, O best of
Purushas? What is called Adhibhuta, and what Adhidaiva?

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

2\. Who, and in what way, is Adhiyajna here in this body, O destroyer of
Madhu? And how art Thou known at the time of death, by the
self-controlled?

The Blessed Lord said:

3\. The Imperishable is the Supreme Brahman. Its dwelling in each
individual body is called Adhyâtma; the offering in sacrifice which
causes the genesis and support of beings, is called Karma. <span
id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_179)

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

4\. The perishable adjunct is the Adhibhuta, and the Indweller is the
Adhidaivata; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best of the
embodied. <span id="fr_180"></span>[4](#fn_180)

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

5\. And he, who at the time of death, meditating on Me alone, goes
forth, leaving the body, attains My Being: there is no doubt about this.

6\. Remembering whatever object, at the end, he leaves the body, that
alone is reached by him, O son of Kunti, (because) of his constant
thought of that object. <span id="fr_181"></span>[6](#fn_181)

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

7\. Therefore, at all times, constantly remember Me, and fight. With
mind and intellect absorbed, in Me, thou shalt doubtless come to
Me. <span id="fr_182"></span>[7](#fn_182)

8\. With the mind not moving towards anything else, made steadfast by
the method of habitual meditation, and dwelling on the Supreme,
Resplendent Purusha, O son of Prithâ, one goes to Him. <span
id="fr_183"></span>[8](#fn_183)

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

9-10. The Omniscient, the Ancient, the Overruler, minuter than an atom,
the Sustainer of all, of form inconceivable, self-luminous like the sun,
and beyond the darkness of Mâyâ—he who meditates on Him thus, at the
time of death, full of devotion, with the mind unmoving, and

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

also by the power of Yoga, fixing the whole Prâna betwixt the eye-brows,
he goes to that Supreme, Resplendent Purusha. <span
id="fr_184"></span>[9](#fn_184)

11\. What the knowers of the Veda speak of as Imperishable, what the
self-controlled (Sannyâsins), freed from attachment enter, and to gain
which goal they

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

live the life of a Brahmachârin, that I shall declare unto thee in
brief. <span id="fr_185"></span>[11](#fn_185)

12-13. Controlling all the senses, confining the mind in the heart,
drawing the Prâna into the head, occupied in the practice of
concentration, uttering the one-syllabled "Om"—the Brahman, and
meditating on Me;—he who so departs, leaving the body, attains the
Supreme Goal.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

14\. I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogin who remembers
Me constantly and daily, with a single mind, O son of Prithâ.

15\. Reaching the highest perfection, and having attained Me, the
great-souled ones are no more subject to re-birth—which is the home of
pain, and ephemeral. <span id="fr_186"></span>[15](#fn_186)

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

16\. All the worlds, O Arjuna, including the realm of Brahmâ, are
subject to return, but after attaining Me, O son of Kunti, there is no
re-birth. <span id="fr_187"></span>[16](#fn_187)

17\. They who know (the true measure of) day and night, know the day of
Brahmâ, which ends in a thousand Yugas, and the night which (also) ends
in a thousand Yugas. <span id="fr_188"></span>[17](#fn_188)

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

18\. At the approach of (Brahmâ's) day, all manifestations proceed from
the unmanifested state; at the approach of night, they merge verily into
that alone, which is called the unmanifested.

19\. The very same multitude of beings (that existed in the preceding
day of Brahmâ), being born again and again, merge, in spite of
themselves, O son of Prithâ, (into the unmanifested), at the approach of
night, and re-manifest at the approach of day. <span
id="fr_189"></span>[19](#fn_189)

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

20\. But beyond this unmanifested, there is that other Unmanifested,
Eternal Existence—That which is not destroyed at the destruction of all
beings. <span id="fr_190"></span>[20](#fn_190)

21\. What has been called Unmanifested and Imperishable, has been
described as the Goal Supreme. That is My highest state, having attained
which, there is no return.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

22\. And that Supreme Purusha is attainable, O son of Prithâ, by
whole-souled devotion to Him alone, in Whom all beings dwell, and by
Whom all this is pervaded.

23\. Now I shall tell thee, O bull of the Bhâratas, of the time (path)
travelling in which, the Yogis return, (and again of that, taking which)
they do not return.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

24\. Fire, flame, day-time, the bright fortnight, the six months of the
Northern passage of the sun, taking this path, the knowers of Brahman go
to Brahman.

25\. Smoke, night-time, the dark fortnight, the six months of the
Southern passage of the sun—taking this path the Yogi, attaining the
lunar light, returns. <span id="fr_191"></span>[25](#fn_191)

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span> <span id="page_194">p. 194</span>
<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

26\. Truly are these bright and dark paths of the world considered
eternal: one leads to non-return; by the other, one returns. <span
id="fr_192"></span>[26](#fn_192)

27\. No Yogi, O son of Prithâ, is deluded after knowing these paths.
Therefore, O Arjuna, be thou steadfast in Yoga, at all times. <span
id="fr_193"></span>[27](#fn_193)

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

28\. Whatever meritorious effect is declared (in the Scriptures) to
accrue from (the study of) the Vedas, (the performance of) Yajnas, (the
practice of) austerities and gifts,—above all this rises the Yogi,
having known this, and attains to the primeval, supreme Abode. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[28](#fn_194)

Way to the Imperishable Brahman</span>.

the idea is, that the most prominent thought of one's life occupies the
mind at the time of death. One cannot get rid of it, even as one cannot
get rid of a disagreeable thought-image in a dream; so the character of
the body to be next attained by one is determined accordingly, *i.e.*,
by the final thought.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[183:7](sbg13.htm#fr_182) *Remember Me and
fight:* Do thou constantly keep thy mind fixed on Me and at the same

religious student who takes the vow of continence etc.; every moment of
this stage is one of hard discipline and asceticism.

evolution and involution of the whole universe respectively.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[189:19](sbg13.htm#fr_189) *Being born . . .
themselves:* They repeatedly come forth and dissolve, being forced by
the effects of their own Karma.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[190:20](sbg13.htm#fr_190) *This
unmanifested*—which being the seed of the manifested, is Avidyâ itself.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[192:25](sbg13.htm#fr_191) It is difficult to
decide the true significance of these two verses (24 & 25). Some are
inclined to think that each of the steps means a sphere; while others, a
state of consciousness. Still others think, that the series beginning
with fire means developing states of illumination and renunciation, and
that beginning with smoke, increasing states of ignorance and
attachment. <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

The two paths, Devayâna and Pitriyâna, by which the souls of the dead
are supposed to travel to the other world according to their deserts are
mentioned in the Upanishads, prominently in the Chhândogya, V. x. I, 2.
Bâdarâyana discusses these passages in the Brahma Sutras, IV. ii. 18-21.
But an interesting light has been thrown upon the question by the late
Mr. Tilak's theory of the Arctic home of the ancestors of the Aryan
race. He has also dealt with his subject specially, in a paper of great
value which appeared in *Prabuddha Bharata* (Vol. IX. p. 160).
Considering the importance of the doctrine and the excellent way in
which it has been elucidated by Mr. Tilak, we shall briefly note below
the main heads of his argument.

The words Pitriyâna and Devayâna are used many times in the Rigveda. But
the distinction made in the Upanishads about the soul's path, according
as a man died during the dark or the bright half of the year, was
unknown to the bards of the Rigveda, who held the view that the soul of
a man always travelled by the Pitriyâna road, whatever the time of his
death. It is therefore clear that the doctrine of the Upanishads was a
later development, probably evolved after physical light and darkness
had come to be connected with moral good and evil and the dual character
of the world was established. Now, if along with this we consider that
death during the Southern passage of the sun was regarded as
inauspicious from the <span id="page_194">p. 194</span> Arctic times, we
can see how the distinction arose between the paths of a man's soul
according as he died in the dark or the bright part of the year.

As to the series of steps in each path, since Agni was believed to be
the only leader of the soul on its path, and both paths ended with the
passages of the sun, the starting and halting points thus settled, it
was not difficult to fill in the intermediate steps. The dual character
of the world is [manifested](errata.htm#0) in Agni as flame and smoke.
The flame was therefore the starting point of one path and smoke, of the
other. Day and night, increasing and decreasing moon, Northern and
Southern passages of the sun came next in natural order. The number of
steps can easily be increased, and as a matter of fact has been
increased in the Kaushitaki and some other Upanishads, on the same
general principle.

Another point in this connection may be noted. There is nothing in the
second or Pitriyâna path to correspond with Agni, in the first. We must
therefore either reduce the number of steps in the first path by taking
the words "fire" and "flame" in appositional relation and translate the
same as "fire, that is flame," or increase the steps in the second by
adding "fire" as one.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[195:26](sbg13.htm#fr_192) The paths are
eternal, because Samsâra is eternal.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[195:27](sbg13.htm#fr_193) Knowing that one of
the paths leads to Samsâra and the other to Moksha, the Yogi takes up
the one leading to illumination and rejects the other

<span id="fn_194"></span>[196:28](sbg13.htm#fr_194) This—the truth
imparted by the Lord in answer to the questions of Arjuna at the
beginning of the present chapter.
