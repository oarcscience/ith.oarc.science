<p>Arjuna said:</p>  
<p>Prakriti and Purusha, also the Kshetra and the knower of the Kshetra, knowledge, and that which ought to be known&#8212;these, O Keshava, I desire to learn.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_289"><font size="1" color="green">p. 289</font></A></p>  
<p>The Blessed Lord said:</p>  
<p>1. This body, O son of Kunti, is called Kshetra, and he who knows it is called Kshetrajna by those who know of them (Kshetra and Kshetrajna).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>2. Me do thou also know, O descendant of Bharata, to be Kshetrajna in all Kshetras. The knowledge of Kshetra and Kshetrajna is considered by Me to be the knowledge.</p>  
<p><a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="green">p. 290</font></A></p>  
<p>3. What the Kshetra is, what its properties are, what are its modifications, what effects arise from what causes, and also who He is and what His powers are, that hear from Me in brief.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>4. (This truth) has been sung by Rishis in many ways, in various distinctive chants, in passages indicative of Brahman, full of reasoning, and convincing.</p>  
<p><a name="page_291"><font size="1" color="green">p. 291</font></A></p>  
<p>5-6. The great Elements, Egoism, Intellect, as also the Unmanifested (Mul&acirc; Prakriti), the ten senses and the one (mind), and the five objects of the senses; desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the, aggregate, intelligence, fortitude,&#8212;the Kshetra has been thus briefly described with its modifications.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="green">p. 292</font></A></p>  
<p>7. Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, forbearance, uprightness, service to the teacher, purity, steadiness, self-control;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_293"><font size="1" color="green">p. 293</font></A></p>  
<p>8. The renunciation of sense-objects, and also absence of egoism; reflection on the evils of birth, death, old age, sickness and pain;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_294"><font size="1" color="green">p. 294</font></A></p>  
<p>9. Non-attachment, non-identification of self with son, wife, home, and the rest, and constant even-mindedness in the occurrence of the desirable and the un-undesirable;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>10. Unswerving devotion to Me by the Yoga of non-separation, resort to sequestered places, distaste for the society of men; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="green">p. 295</font></A></p>  
<p>11. Constant application to spiritual knowledge, understanding of the end of true knowledge: this is declared to be knowledge, and what is opposed to it is ignorance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="green">p. 296</font></A></p>  
<p>12. I shall describe that which has to be known, knowing which one attains to immortality, the beginningless Supreme Brahman. It is called neither being nor non-being.</p>  
<p>13. With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears everywhere in the universe,&#8212;That exists pervading all.</p>  
<p>14. Shining by the functions of all the</p>  
<p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="green">p. 297</font></A></p>  
<p>senses, yet without the senses; Absolute, yet sustaining all; devoid of Gunas, yet their experiencer.</p>  
<p>15. Without and within (all) beings; the unmoving and also the moving; because of Its subtlety incomprehensible; It is far and near.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>16. Impartible, yet It exists as if divided in beings: It is to be known as</p>  
<p><a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="green">p. 298</font></A></p>  
<p>sustaining beings; and devouring, as well as generating (them).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>17. The Light even of lights, It is said to be beyond darkness; Knowledge, and the One Thing to be known, the Goal of' knowledge, dwelling in the hearts of all.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="green">p. 299</font></A></p>  
<p>18. Thus Kshetra, knowledge, and that which has to be known, have been briefly stated. Knowing this, My devotee is fitted for My state.</p>  
<p>19. Know thou that Prakriti and Purusha are both beginningless; and know thou also that all modifications and Gunas are born of Prakriti.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>20. In the production of the body and the senses, Prakriti is said to be the cause; in the experience of pleasure and pain, Purusha is said to be the cause.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="green">p. 300</font></A></p>  
<p>21. Purusha seated in Prakriti, experiences the Gunas born of Prakriti; the reason of his birth in good and evil wombs is his attachment to the Gunas.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_290"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="green">p. 301</font></A></p>  
<p>22. And the Supreme Purusha in this body is also called the Looker-on, the Permitter, the Supporter, the Experiencer, the Great Lord, and the Highest Self.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_291"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>23. He who thus knows the Purusha and Prakriti together with the Gunas, whatever his life, is not born again.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="green">p. 302</font></A></p>  
<p>24. Some by meditation behold the Self in their own intelligence by the purified heart, others by the path of knowledge, others again by Karma Yoga.</p>  
<p>25. Others again not knowing thus, worship as they have heard from others.</p>  
<p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="green">p. 303</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Even these go beyond death, regarding what they have heard as the Supreme Refuge.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>26. Whatever being is born, the moving or the unmoving, O bull of the Bh&acirc;ratas, know it to be from the union of Kshetra and Kshetrajna.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="green">p. 304</font></A></p>  
<p>27. He sees, who sees the Lord Supreme, existing equally in all beings, deathless in the dying.</p>  
<p>28. Since seeing the Lord equally existent everywhere, he injures not Self by self, and so goes to the highest Goal.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="green">p. 305</font></A></p>  
<p>29. He sees, who sees that all actions are done by Prakriti alone and that the Self is actionless.</p>  
<p>30. When he sees the separate existence of all beings inherent in the One, and their expansion from That (One) alone, he then becomes Brahman.</p>  
<p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></A></p>  
<p>31. Being without beginning and devoid of Gunas, this Supreme Self, immutable, O son of Kunti, though existing in the body neither acts nor is affected.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_296"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>32. As the all-pervading Ak&acirc;sha, because of its subtlety, is not tainted, so the Self existent in the body everywhere is not tainted.</p>  
<p><a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="green">p. 307</font></A></p>  
<p>33. As the one sun illumines all this world, so does He who abides in the Kshetra, O descendant of Bharata, illumine the whole Kshetra.</p>  
<p>34. They who thus with the eye of knowledge perceive the distinction between the Kshetra and the Kshetrajna, and also the emancipation from the Prakriti of beings, they go to the Supreme.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A></p>

<p>Desire and other qualities which the Vaiseshikas speak of as inherent attributes of the Atman, are spoken of in the sixth Sloka as merely the attributes of Kshetra, and not the attributes of Kshetrajna. Desire and other qualities mentioned here, stand for all the qualities of the Antah-Karana or inner sense,&#8212;as mere mental states. Each of them, being knowable, is Kshetra.</p>  
<p>The Kshetra, of which the various modifications in their totality are spoken of as "this body" in the first Sloka, has been here dwelt upon in all its different forms, from 'The great Elements' to 'fortitude.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_280"></A><A HREF="sbg18.htm#fr_280">292:7</A> <i>Ach&acirc;rya</i>&#8212;one who teaches the means of attaining Moksha.</p>

<p><i>Reflection . . . pain</i>&#8212;or the passage may be interpreted as&#8212;reflection on the evils and miseries of birth, death, old age and sickness. Birth &amp;c., are all miseries, not that they are miseries in themselves, but because they produce misery. From such reflection arises indifference to sense-pleasures, and the senses turn towards the Innermost Self for knowledge.</P>

And being a looker-on, He never stands in the way of the activities of Prakriti as manifested in the body. Indeed, all the consciousness or intelligence that manifests itself in the activities of life is but the reflection of the All-pervading, Absolute and Perfect Intelligence&#8212;the Supreme Spirit.</P>

In his case they are mere semblances of Karma; a burnt cloth, for instance, cannot serve the purposes of a cloth.</P>
