<p>The Blessed Lord said:</p>  
<p>1. To thee, who dost not carp, verily shall I now declare this, the most profound knowledge, united with realisation, having known which, thou shalt be free from evil (Sams&acirc;ra).</p>  
<p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></A></p>  
<p>2. Of sciences, the highest; of profundities, the deepest; of purifiers, the supreme, is this; realisable by direct perception, endowed with (immense) merit, very easy to perform, and of an imperishable nature.</p>  
<p>3. Persons without Shraddh&acirc; for this Dharma, return, O scorcher of foes, without attaining Me, to the path of re-birth fraught with death.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></A></p>  
<p>4. All this world is pervaded by me in My unmanifested form: all beings exist in Me, but I do not dwell in them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>5. Nor do beings exist in Me (in reality), behold My Divine Yoga! Bringing forth and supporting the beings, My Self does not dwell in them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="green">p. 200</font></A></p>  
<p>6. As the mighty wind, moving always everywhere, rests ever in the Ak&acirc;sha, know thou, that even so do all beings rest in Me.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="green">p. 201</font></A></p>  
<p>7. At the end of a Kalpa, O son of Kunti, all beings go back to My Prakriti: at the beginning of (another) Kalpa, I send them forth again.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>8. Animating My Prakriti, I project again and again this whole multitude of beings, helpless under the sway of Prakriti.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></A></p>  
<p>9. These acts do not bind Me, sitting as one neutral, unattached to them, O Dhananjaya.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>10. By reason of My proximity, Prakriti produces all this, the moving and the unmoving; the world wheels round and round, O son of Kunti, because of this.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></A></p>  
<p>11. Unaware of My higher state, as the great Lord of beings, fools disregard Me, dwelling in the human form.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></A></p>  
<p>12. Of vain hopes, of vain works, of vain knowledge, and senseless, they verily are possessed of the delusive nature of R&acirc;kshasas and Asuras.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>13. But the great-souled ones, O son</p>  
<p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="green">p. 205</font></A></p>  
<p>of Prith&acirc;, possessed of the Divine Prakriti, knowing Me to be the origin of beings, and immutable, worship Me with a single mind.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>14. Glorifying Me always and striving with firm resolve, bowing down to Me in devotion, always steadfast, they worship Me.</p>  
<p>15. Others, too, sacrificing by the Yajna of knowledge (<i>i.e.</i>, seeing the Self in all), worship Me the All-Formed, as one, as distinct, as manifold.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="green">p. 206</font></A></p>  
<p>16. I am the Kratu, I the Yajna, I the Svadh&acirc;, I the Aushadham, I the Mantra, I the Ajyam, I the fire, and I the oblation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="green">p. 207</font></A></p>  
<p>17. I am the Father of this world, the Mother, the Sustainer, the Grandfather; the Purifier, the (one) thing to be known, (the syllable) Om, and also the Rik, S&acirc;man and Yajus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>18. The Goal, the Supporter, the Lord, the Witness, the Abode, the Refuge, the Friend, the Origin, the Dissolution, the Substratum, the Storehouse, the Seed immutable.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="green">p. 208</font></A></p>  
<p>19. (As sun) I give heat: I withhold and send forth rain; I am immortality and also death; being and non-being am I, O Arjuna!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="green">p. 209</font></A></p>  
<p>20. The knowers of the three Vedas, worshipping Me by Yajna, drinking the Soma, and (thus) being purified from sin, pray for passage to heaven; reaching the holy world of the Lord of the Devas, they enjoy in heaven the divine pleasures of the Devas.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></A></p>  
<p>21. Having enjoyed the vast Swarga-world, they enter the mortal world, on the exhaustion of their merit: Thus, abiding by the injunctions of the three (Vedas), desiring desires, they (constantly) come and go.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>22. Persons who, meditating on Me as non-separate, worship Me in all beings, to them thus ever jealously engaged, I carry what they lack and preserve what they already have.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></A></p>  
<p>23. Even those devotees, who endued with Shraddh&acirc;, worship other gods, they too worship Me alone, O son of Kunti, (but) by the wrong method.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>24. For I alone am the Enjoyer, and Lord of all Yajnas; but because they do not know Me in reality, they return, (to the mortal world).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="green">p. 212</font></A></p>  
<p>25. Votaries of the Devas go to the Devas; to the Pitris, go their votaries; to the Bhutas, go the Bhuta worshippers; My votaries too come unto Me.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="green">p. 213</font></A></p>  
<p>26. Whoever with devotion offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water, that I accept&#8212;the devout gift of the pure-minded.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>27. Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest, whatever thou offerest in sacrifice, whatever thou givest away, whatever austerity thou practisest, O son of Kunti, do that as an offering unto Me.</p>  
<p><a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="green">p. 214</font></A></p>  
<p>28. Thus shalt thou be freed from the bondages of actions, bearing good and evil results: with the heart steadfast in the Yoga of renunciation, and liberated, thou shalt come unto Me.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>29. I am the same to all beings: to Me there is none hateful or dear. But those who worship Me with devotion, are in Me, and I too am in them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="green">p. 215</font></A></p>  
<p>30. If even a very wicked person worships Me, with devotion to none else, he should be regarded as good, for he has rightly resolved.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></A></p>  
<p>31. Soon does he become righteous, and attain eternal Peace, O son of Kunti boldly canst thou proclaim, that My devotee is never destroyed.</p>  
<p>32. For, taking refuge in Me, they also, O son of Prith&acirc;, who might be of inferior birth,&#8212;women, Vaishyas, as well as Sudras,&#8212;even they attain to the Supreme Goal.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 217</font></A></p>  
<p>33. What need to mention holy Br&acirc;hmanas, and devoted R&acirc;jarshis! Having obtained this transient, joyless world, worship thou Me.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></A></p>  
<p>34. Fill thy mind with Me, be My devotee, sacrifice unto Me, bow down to Me; thus having made thy heart steadfast in Me, taking Me as the Supreme Goal, thou shalt come to Me.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_201"></A><A HREF="sbg14.htm#fr_201">202:9</A> <i>These acts</i>&#8212;which involve the unequal creation and dissolution of the universe.</p>  
<p>As in the case of Ishvara, so in the case of others also, the absence of the egotistic feeling of agency and attachment for results, is the cause of freedom (from Dharma and Adharma).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_202"></A><A HREF="sbg14.htm#fr_202">202:10</A> In verses VII to X the Lord defines His position, following the Arundhati Ny&acirc;ya. When a bride is brought to her husband's house for the first time, he shows her a very tiny star, called Arundhati. To do this, he has to direct her gaze the right way, <a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></A> which he does by asking her to look at something near and something big, in the direction of the star, <i>e.g.</i>, a branch of a tree. Next, he draws her attention to a large bright star observed beyond this branch, and so on, till by several steps, he succeeds in leading her eyes to the right thing. This method of leading to a subtle object through easy steps, is called Arundhati Ny&acirc;ya. The Lord begins by stating that He projects all beings at the beginning of evolution: Prakriti is only an instrument in His hands. Next, He says, He is not affected by that act, since He sits by, as one neutral, perfectly unattached. Lastly, He leads up to the final truth that really He does nothing, that it is Prakriti, who animated by His proximity produces all that is. It is His Light that lights up Prakriti, and makes her live and act. That is all the relation between Him and her.</P>
