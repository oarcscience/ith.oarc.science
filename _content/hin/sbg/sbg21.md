### SIXTEENTH CHAPTER

The Blessed Lord said:

1\. Fearlessness, purity of heart, steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga;
almsgiving, control of the senses, Yajna, reading of the Shâstras,
austerity, uprightness; <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_332)

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

2\. Non-injury, truth, absence of anger, renunciation, tranquillity,
absence of calumny, compassion to beings, un-covetousness, gentleness,
modesty, absence of fickleness; <span id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_333)

3\. Boldness, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of hatred, absence
of

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

pride; these belong to one born for a divine state, O descendant of
Bharata.

4\. Ostentation, arrogance and self-conceit, anger as also harshness and
ignorance, belong to one who is born, O Pârtha, for an Asurika
state. <span id="fr_334"></span>[4](#fn_334)

5\. The divine state is deemed to make for liberation, the Asurika for
bondage; grieve not, O Pândava, thou art born for a divine state.

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

6\. There are two types of beings [in](errata.htm#3) this world, the
divine and the Asurika. The divine have been described at length; hear
from Me, O Pârtha, of the Asurika.

7\. The persons of Asurika nature know not what to do and what to
refrain from; neither is purity found in them nor good conduct, nor
truth. <span id="fr_335"></span>[7](#fn_335)

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

8\. They say, "The universe is without truth, without a (moral) basis,
without a God, brought about by mutual union, with lust for its cause;
what else?" <span id="fr_336"></span>[8](#fn_336)

9\. Holding this view, these ruined souls of small intellect and fierce
deeds, rise as the enemies of the world for its destruction. <span
id="fr_337"></span>[9](#fn_337)

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

10\. Filled with insatiable desires, full of hypocrisy, pride and
arrogance, holding evil ideas through delusion, they work with impure
resolve.

11\. Beset with immense cares ending only with death, regarding
gratification of lust as the highest, and feeling sure that that is
all; <span id="fr_338"></span>[11](#fn_338)

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

12\. Bound by a hundred ties of hope, given over to lust and wrath, they
strive to secure by unjust means hoards of wealth for sensual enjoyment.

13\. "This to-day has been gained by me; this desire I shall obtain;
this is mine, and this wealth also shall be mine in future.

14\. "That enemy has been slain by

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

me, and others also shall I slay. I am the lord, I enjoy, I am
successful, powerful and happy.

15\. "I am rich and well-born. Who else is equal to me? I will
sacrifice, I will give, I will rejoice." Thus deluded by ignorance,

16\. Bewildered by many a fancy, covered by the meshes of delusion,
addicted to the gratification of lust, they fall down into a foul hell.

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

17\. Self-conceited, haughty, filled with the pride and intoxication of
wealth, they perform sacrifices in name, out of ostentation,
disregarding ordinance;

18\. Possessed of egoism, power, insolence, lust and wrath, these
malignant people hate Me (the Self within) in their own bodies and those
of others.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

19\. These malicious and cruel evildoers, most degraded of men, I hurl
perpetually into the wombs of Asuras only, in these worlds. <span
id="fr_339"></span>[19](#fn_339)

20\. Obtaining the Asurika wombs, and deluded birth after birth, not
attaining to Me, they thus fall, O son of Kunti, into a still lower
condition.

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

21\. Triple is this gate of hell, destructive of the self,—lust, anger
and greed; therefore one should forsake these three. <span
id="fr_340"></span>[21](#fn_340)

22\. The man who has got beyond these three gates of darkness, O son of
Kunti, practises what is good for himself, and thus goes to the Goal
Supreme.

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

23\. He who, setting aside the ordinance of the Shâstra, acts under the
impulse of desire, attains not to perfection, nor happiness, nor the
Goal Supreme. <span id="fr_341"></span>[23](#fn_341)

24\. So let the Shâstra be thy authority in ascertaining what ought to
be done and what ought not to be done. Having known what is said in the
ordinance of the Shâstra, thou shouldst act here. <span
id="fr_342"></span>[24](#fn_342)
