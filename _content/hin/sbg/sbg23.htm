<p>Arjuna said:</p>  
<p>1. I desire to know severally, O mighty-armed, the truth of Sanny&acirc;sa, O Hrishikesha, as also of Ty&acirc;ga, O slayer of Keshi.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="green">p. 365</font></A></p>  
<p>The Blessed Lord said:</p>  
<p>2. The renunciation of K&acirc;mya actions, the sages understand as. Sanny&acirc;sa: the wise declare the abandonment of the fruits of all works as Ty&acirc;ga.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>3. Some philosophers declare that all action should be relinquished as an evil, whilst others (say) that the work of Yajna, gift and austerity should not be relinquished.</p>  
<p><a name="page_366"><font size="1" color="green">p. 366</font></A></p>  
<p>4. Hear from Me the final truth about relinquishment, O best of the Bh&acirc;ratas. For relinquishment has been declared to be of three kinds, O tiger among men.</p>  
<p>5. The work of Yajna, gift and austerity should not be relinquished, but it should indeed be performed; (for) Yajna, gift and austerity are purifying to the wise.</p>  
<p><a name="page_367"><font size="1" color="green">p. 367</font></A></p>  
<p>6. But even these works, O P&acirc;rtha, should be performed, leaving attachment and the fruits;&#8212;such is My best and certain conviction.</p>  
<p>7. But the renunciation of obligatory action is not proper. Abandonment of the same from delusion is declared to be T&acirc;masika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_368"><font size="1" color="green">p. 368</font></A></p>  
<p>8. He who from fear of bodily trouble relinquishes action, because it is painful, thus performing a R&acirc;jasika relinquishment, he obtains not the fruit thereof.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>9. When obligatory work is performed, O Arjuna, only because it ought to be done, leaving attachment and fruit, such relinquishment is regarded as S&acirc;ttvika.</p>  
<p><a name="page_369"><font size="1" color="green">p. 369</font></A></p>  
<p>10. The relinquisher endued with Sattva and a steady understanding and with his doubts dispelled, hates not a disagreeable work nor is attached to an agreeable one.</p>  
<p>11. Actions cannot be entirely relinquished by an embodied being, but he who relinquishes the fruits of action is called a relinquisher.</p>  
<p><a name="page_370"><font size="1" color="green">p. 370</font></A></p>  
<p>12. The threefold fruit of action&#8212;disagreeable, agreeable and mixed,&#8212;accrues to non-relinquishers after death, but never to relinquishers.</p>  
<p>13. Learn from Me, O mighty-armed, these five causes for the accomplishment of all works as declared in the wisdom which is the end of all action:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_371"><font size="1" color="green">p. 371</font></A></p>  
<p>14. The body, the agent, the various senses, the different functions of a manifold kind, and the presiding divinity, the fifth of these;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>15. Whatever action a man performs by his body, speech and mind&#8212;whether right or the reverse&#8212;these five are its causes.</p>  
<p><a name="page_372"><font size="1" color="green">p. 372</font></A></p>  
<p>16. Such being the case, he who through a non-purified understanding looks upon his Self, the Absolute, as the agent, he of perverted mind sees not.</p>  
<p>17. He who is free from the notion of egoism, whose intelligence is not affected (by good or evil), though he kills these people, he kills not, nor is bound (by the action);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_373"><font size="1" color="green">p. 373</font></A></p>  
<p>18. Knowledge, the known and the knower form the threefold cause of action. The instrument, the object and the agent are the threefold basis of action.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>19. Knowledge, action and agent are declared in the S&acirc;nkhya philosophy to be</p>  
<p><a name="page_374"><font size="1" color="green">p. 374</font></A></p>  
<p>of three kinds only, from the distinction of Gunas: hear them also duly.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>20. That by which the one indestructible Substance is seen in all beings, inseparate in the separated, know that knowledge to be S&acirc;ttvika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_375"><font size="1" color="green">p. 375</font></A></p>  
<p>21. But that knowledge which sees in all beings various entities of distinct kinds as different from one another, know thou that knowledge as R&acirc;jasika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>22. Whilst that which is confined to one single effect as if it were the whole, without reason, without foundation in truth, and trivial,&#8212;that is declared to be T&acirc;masika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_367"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_376"><font size="1" color="green">p. 376</font></A></p>  
<p>23. An ordained action done without love or hatred by one not desirous of the fruit and free from attachment, is declared to be S&acirc;ttvika.</p>  
<p>24. But the action which is performed desiring desires, or with self-conceit and with much effort, is declared to be R&acirc;jasika.</p>  
<p><a name="page_377"><font size="1" color="green">p. 377</font></A></p>  
<p>25. That action is declared to be T&acirc;masika which is undertaken through delusion, without heed to the consequence, loss (of power and wealth), injury (to others) and (one's own) ability.</p>  
<p>26. An agent who is free from attachment, non-egotistic, endued with fortitude and enthusiasm and unaffected in success or failure, is called S&acirc;ttvika.</p>  
<p>27. He who is passionate, desirous of the fruits of action, greedy, malignant, impure, easily elated or dejected, such an agent is called R&acirc;jasika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_378"><font size="1" color="green">p. 378</font></A></p>  
<p>28. Unsteady, vulgar, arrogant, dishonest, malicious, indolent, desponding and procrastinating, such an agent is called T&acirc;masika.</p>  
<p>29. Hear thou the triple distinction of intellect and fortitude, according to the Gunas, as I declare them exhaustively and severally, O Dhananjaya.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_379"><font size="1" color="green">p. 379</font></A></p>  
<p>30. That which knows the paths of work and renunciation, right and wrong action, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation, that intellect, O P&acirc;rtha, is S&acirc;ttvika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>31. That which has a distorted apprehension of Dharma and its opposite and also of right action and its opposite, that intellect, O P&acirc;rtha, is R&acirc;jasika.</p>  
<p><a name="page_380"><font size="1" color="green">p. 380</font></A></p>  
<p>32. That which enveloped in darkness regards Adharma as Dharma and views all things in a perverted light, that intellect, O P&acirc;rtha, is T&acirc;masika.</p>  
<p>33. The fortitude by which the functions of the mind, the Pr&acirc;na and the senses, O P&acirc;rtha, are regulated, that fortitude, unswerving through Yoga, is S&acirc;ttvika.</p>  
<p><a name="page_381"><font size="1" color="green">p. 381</font></A></p>  
<p>34. But the fortitude by which one regulates (one's mind) to Dharma, desire and wealth, desirous of the fruit of each from attachment, that fortitude, O P&acirc;rtha, is R&acirc;jasika.</p>  
<p>35. That by which a stupid man does not give up sleep, fear, grief, despondency and also overweening conceit, that fortitude, O P&acirc;rtha, is T&acirc;masika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_382"><font size="1" color="green">p. 382</font></A></p>  
<p>36. And now hear from Me, O bull of the Bh&acirc;ratas, of the threefold happiness. That happiness which one learns to enjoy by habit, and by which one comes to the end of pain;</p>  
<p>37. That which is like poison at first, but like nectar at the end; that happiness is declared to be S&acirc;ttvika, born of the translucence of intellect due to Self-realisation.</p>  
<p><a name="page_383"><font size="1" color="green">p. 383</font></A></p>  
<p>38. That which arises from the contact of object with sense, at first like nectar, but at the end like poison, that happiness is declared to be R&acirc;jasika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>39. That happiness which begins and results in self-delusion arising from sleep, indolence and miscomprehension, that is declared to be T&acirc;masika.</p>  
<p><a name="page_384"><font size="1" color="green">p. 384</font></A></p>  
<p>40. There is no entity on earth, or again in heaven among the Devas, that is devoid of these three Gunas, born of Prakriti.</p>  
<p>41. Of Br&acirc;hmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, as also of Sudras, O scorcher of foes, the duties are distributed according to the Gunas born of their own nature.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_373"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_385"><font size="1" color="green">p. 385</font></A></p>  
<p>42. The control of the mind and the senses, austerity, purity, forbearance, and also uprightness, knowledge, realisation, belief in a hereafter,&#8212;these are the duties of the Br&acirc;hmanas, born of (their own) nature.</p>  
<p>43. Prowess, boldness, fortitude, dexterity, and also not flying from battle, generosity and sovereignty are the duties of the Kshatriyas, born of (their own) nature.</p>  
<p><a name="page_386"><font size="1" color="green">p. 386</font></A></p>  
<p>44. Agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade are the duties of the Vaishyas, born of (their own) nature; and action consisting of service is the duty of the Sudras, born of (their own) nature.</p>  
<p>45. Devoted each to his own duty, man attains the highest perfection. How engaged in his own duty, he attains perfection, that hear.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_374"></A><A HREF="#fn_374"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_387"><font size="1" color="green">p. 387</font></A></p>  
<p>46. From whom is the evolution of all beings, by whom all this is pervaded, worshipping Him with his own duty, a man attains perfection.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_375"></A><A HREF="#fn_375"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>47. Better is one's own Dharma, (though) imperfect, than the Dharma of another well-performed. He who does the duty ordained by his own nature incurs no evil.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_388"><font size="1" color="green">p. 388</font></A></p>  
<p>48. One should not relinquish, O son of Kunti, the duty to which one is born, though it is attended with evil; for, all undertakings are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_389"><font size="1" color="green">p. 389</font></A></p>  
<p>49. He whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who has subdued his heart, whose desires have fled, he attains by renunciation to the supreme perfection, consisting of freedom from action.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>50. Learn from Me in brief, O son of Kunti, how reaching such perfection, he attains to Brahman, that supreme consummation of knowledge.</p>  
<p><a name="page_390"><font size="1" color="green">p. 390</font></A></p>  
<p>51. Endued with a pure intellect, subduing the body and the senses with fortitude, relinquishing sound and such other sense-objects, abandoning attraction and hatred;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_379"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>52. Resorting to a sequestered spot, eating but little, body, speech and mind</p>  
<p><a name="page_391"><font size="1" color="green">p. 391</font></A></p>  
<p>controlled, ever engaged in meditation and concentration, possessed of dispassion;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_380"></A><A HREF="#fn_380"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>53. Forsaking egoism, power, pride, lust, wrath and property, freed from the notion of "mine," and tranquil, he is fit for becoming Brahman.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_381"></A><A HREF="#fn_381"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_392"><font size="1" color="green">p. 392</font></A></p>  
<p>54. Brahman-become, tranquil-minded, he neither grieves nor desires; the same to all beings, he attains to supreme devotion unto Me.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>55. By devotion he knows Me in</p>  
<p><a name="page_393"><font size="1" color="green">p. 393</font></A></p>  
<p>reality, what and who I am; then having known Me in reality, he forthwith enters into Me.</p>  
<p>56. Even doing all actions always, taking refuge in Me,&#8212;by My grace he attains to the eternal, immutable State.</p>  
<p>57. Resigning mentally all deeds to Me, having Me as the highest goal, resorting to Buddhi-Yoga do thou ever fix thy mind on Me.</p>  
<p><a name="page_394"><font size="1" color="green">p. 394</font></A></p>  
<p>58. Fixing thy mind on Me, thou shalt, by My grace, overcome all obstacles; but if from self-conceit thou wilt not hear Me, thou shalt perish.</p>  
<p>59. If filled with self-conceit thou thinkest, "I will not fight," vain is this thy resolve; thy Prakriti will constrain thee.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_395"><font size="1" color="green">p. 395</font></A></p>  
<p>60. Fettered, O son of Kunti, by thy own Karma, born of thy own nature, what thou, from delusion, desirest not to do, thou shalt have to do in spite of thyself.</p>  
<p>61. The Lord, O Arjuna, dwells in the hearts of all beings, causing all beings, by His M&acirc;y&acirc;, to revolve, (as if) mounted on a machine.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_384"></A><A HREF="#fn_384"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>62. Take refuge in Him with all thy heart, O Bh&acirc;rata; by His grace shalt thou</p>  
<p><a name="page_396"><font size="1" color="green">p. 396</font></A></p>  
<p>attain supreme peace (and) the eternal abode.</p>  
<p>63. Thus has wisdom more profound than all profundities, been declared to. thee by Me; reflecting over it fully, act as thou likest.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_385"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>64. Hear thou again My supreme word, the profoundest of all; because thou art dearly beloved of Me, therefore will I speak what is good to thee.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_386"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_397"><font size="1" color="green">p. 397</font></A></p>  
<p>65. Occupy thy mind with Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, bow down to Me. Thou shalt reach Myself; truly do I promise unto thee, (for) thou art dear to Me.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_387"></A><A HREF="#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>66. Relinquishing all Dharmas take</p>  
<p><a name="page_398"><font size="1" color="green">p. 398</font></A></p>  
<p>refuge in Me alone; I will liberate thee from all sins; grieve not.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_388"></A><A HREF="#fn_388"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_399"><font size="1" color="green">p. 399</font></A></p>  
<p>67. This is never to be spoken by thee to one who is devoid of austerities or devotion, nor to one who does not render service, nor to one who cavils at Me.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_389"></A><A HREF="#fn_389"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>68. He who with supreme devotion to Me will teach this deeply profound philosophy to My devotees, shall doubtless come to Me alone.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_390"></A><A HREF="#fn_390"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_400"><font size="1" color="green">p. 400</font></A></p>  
<p>69. Nor among men is there any who does dearer service to Me, nor shall there be another on earth dearer to Me, than he.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_391"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>70. And he who will study this sacred dialogue of ours, by him shall I have been worshipped by the Yajna of knowledge; such is My conviction.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_401"><font size="1" color="green">p. 401</font></A></p>  
<p>71. And even that man who hears this, full of Shraddh&acirc; and free from malice, he too, liberated, shall attain to the happy worlds of those of righteous deeds.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_393"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>72. Has this been heard by thee, P&acirc;rtha, with an attentive mind? Has the delusion of thy ignorance been destroyed, O Dhananjaya?</p>  
<p><a name="page_402"><font size="1" color="green">p. 402</font></A></p>  
<p>Arjuna said:</p>  
<p>73. Destroyed is my delusion, and I have gained my memory through Thy grace, O Achyuta. I am firm; my doubts are gone. I will do Thy word.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_394"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_403"><font size="1" color="green">p. 403</font></A></p>  
<p>Sanjaya said:</p>  
<p>74. Thus have I heard this wonderful dialogue between V&acirc;sudeva and the high-souled P&acirc;rtha, causing my hair to stand on end.</p>  
<p>75. Through the grace of Vy&acirc;sa have I heard this supreme and most profound Yoga, direct from Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, Himself declaring it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_395"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_404"><font size="1" color="green">p. 404</font></A></p>  
<p>76. O King, as I remember and remember this wonderful and holy dialogue between Keshava and Arjuna, I rejoice again and again.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>77. And as I remember and remember that most wonderful Form of Hari, great is my wonder, O King; and I rejoice again and again.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_405"><font size="1" color="green">p. 405</font></A></p>  
<p>78. Wherever is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, wherever is P&acirc;rtha, the wielder of the bow, there are prosperity, victory, expansion, and sound policy: such is my conviction.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">78</FONT></A></p>

<p><i>Property:</i> Though a man who is free from all passions of the mind and the senses, may own so much of external belongings as is necessary for bodily sustenance and for the observance of his religious duties (Dharma), yet this the aspirant abandons, even if this comes of itself, because he does not regard <a name="page_392"><font size="1" color="green">p. 392</font></A> the bodily life as his; thus he becomes a Paramahamsa Parivr&acirc;jaka, a Sanny&acirc;sin of the highest order.</P>

<p><i>Liberate thee</i>&#8212;by manifesting Myself as thy own Self.</p>  
<p><i>All sins:</i> all bonds of Dharma and Adharma.</p>  
<p>Sankara in his commentary here very strongly combats the opinion of those who hold that highest spiritual realisation (Jn&acirc;na) and ritualistic work (Karma) may go together in the same person. For Karma is possible only in the relative world (Sams&acirc;ra), which is the outcome of ignorance; and knowledge dispels this ignorance. So neither the conjunction of Jn&acirc;na with Karma, nor Karma alone conduces to the absolute cessation of Sams&acirc;ra, but it is only the Right Knowledge of the Self which does so.</P>

Japa, (3) Up&acirc;msu, or a prayer uttered, in a low voice, or (4) M&acirc;nasa or prayer offered with the mind. Jn&acirc;na-yajna or the Yajna of knowledge comes under the head of M&acirc;nasa, and is therefore the highest.</p>  
<p>The study of the Git&acirc; will produce an effect equal to that of the Yajna of knowledge.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_393"></A><A HREF="sbg23.htm#fr_393">401:71</A> <i>Even that man:</i> much more so he who understands the doctrine.</P>

<p>The purpose of the knowledge of the Sh&acirc;stras is the destruction of doubts and delusions, and the recognition of the true nature of the Self. Here, the answer of Arjuna conclusively shows, that that purpose has been fulfilled in him.</p>
