### INVOCATION <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0)

O blessed Mother  
Who showerest (upon us) the nectar of Advaita  
In the form of (these) eighteen chapters!  
Thou Destroyer of rebirth!  
Thou loving Mother!  
Thou Bhagavad-Gitâ!  
    Upon Thee I meditate.

Thee, O Vyâsa, of lotus-eyes,  
And mighty intellect,  
Who hast lighted the lamp of wisdom  
Filled with the oil of the Mahâbhârata,  
    Thee we salute.

O Thou who art the Refuge  
Of the (ocean-born) Lakshmi,  
Thou in whose right hand is the shepherd's crook,  
Who art the milker of the divine nectar of the Gitâ,  
    To Thee, O Krishna, to Thee our salutation!

The Upanishads are even as the herd of cows,  
The Son of the cowherd as the milker,  
Pârtha as the sucking-calf,  
And men of purified intellect the drinkers,  
    Of this, the supreme nectar, the milk of the Gitâ.

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

Thou son of Vasudeva,  
Destroyer of Kamsa and Chânura,  
Thou supreme bliss of Devaki,  
Guru of the Worlds,  
    Thee, O Krishna, as God, we salute!

Of that great river of battle which the Pândavas crossed over,  
Bhishma and Drona were as the high banks;  
And Jayadratha as the water of the river;  
The King of Gândhâra the water-lily;  
Shalya as the sharks, Kripa as the current;  
Karna the mighty waves;  
Ashvatthâmâ and Vikarna dread water-monsters,  
And Duryodhana was the very whirlpool;  
    But Thou, O Krishna, wast the Ferry-man!

This spotless product of the words of Vyâsa,  
This lotus of the Mahâbhârata,—  
With the Bhagavad-Gitâ as its strong sweet fragrance,  
And tales of heroes as its full-blown petals,  
Held ever open by the talk of Hari, of Him  
Who is destroyer of the taint of Kali-Yuga;  
This lotus to which come joyously  
Day after day the honey-seeking souls,—  
    May this produce in us the highest good!

Him Whose compassion maketh the dumb man eloquent,  
And the cripple to cross mountains,  
Him the All-blissful Mâdhava,  
    Do I salute!

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

To that Supreme One Who is bodied forth in Brahmâ,  
In Varuna, in Indra, in Rudra and Maruts;  
That One Whom all divine beings praise with hymns;  
Him Whom the singers of Sâma-Veda tell;  
Him of Whose glory, sing in full choir, The Upanishads and Vedas;  
Him Whom the Yogis see, with mind absorbed in perfect meditation;  
Him of Whom all the hosts of Devas and Asuras  
Know not the limitations,  
    To Him, the Supreme Good, be salutation,—  
Him we salute. Him we salute. Him we salute.
