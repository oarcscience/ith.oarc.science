### FOURTH CHAPTER

The Blessed Lord said:

1\. I told this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvat; Vivasvat told it to Manu;
(and) Manu told it to Ikshvâku: <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90)

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

2\. Thus handed down in regular succession, the royal sages knew it.
This Yoga, by long lapse of time, declined in this world, O burner of
foes.

3\. I have this day told thee that same ancient Yoga, (for) thou art My
devotee, and My friend, and this secret is profound indeed. <span
id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_91)

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

Arjuna said:

4\. Later was Thy birth, and that of Vivasvat prior; how then should I
understand that Thou toldest this in the beginning?

The Blessed Lord said:

5\. Many are the births that have been passed by Me and thee, O Arjuna.
I know them all, whilst thou knowest not, O scorcher of foes.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

6\. Though I am unborn, of changeless nature and Lord of beings, yet
subjugating My Prakriti, I come into being by My own Mâyâ. <span
id="fr_92"></span>[6](#fn_92)

7\. Whenever, O descendant of Bharata, there is decline of Dharma, and
rise of Adharma, then I body Myself forth. <span
id="fr_93"></span>[7](#fn_93)

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

8\. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked,
and for the establishment of Dharma, I come into being in every
age. <span id="fr_94"></span>[8](#fn_94)

9\. He who thus knows, in true light, My divine birth and action,
leaving the body, is not born again: he attains to Me, O Arjuna. <span
id="fr_95"></span>[9](#fn_95)

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

10\. Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking
refuge in Me, purified by the fire of Knowledge, many have attained My
Being. <span id="fr_96"></span>[10](#fn_96)

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

11\. In whatever way men worship Me, in the same way do I fulfil their
desires: (it is) My path, O son of Prithâ, (that) men tread, in all
ways. <span id="fr_97"></span>[11](#fn_97)

12\. Longing for success in action, in this world, (men) worship the
gods. Because success, resulting from action, is, quickly attained in
the human world. <span id="fr_98"></span>[12](#fn_98)

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

13\. The fourfold caste was created by Me, by the differentiation of
Guna and Karma. Though I am the author thereof, know Me to be the
non-doer, and changeless. <span id="fr_99"></span>[13](#fn_99)

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

14\. Actions do not taint Me, nor have I any thirst for the result of
action. He who knows Me thus is not fettered by action. <span
id="fr_100"></span>[14](#fn_100)

15\. Knowing thus, the ancient seekers after freedom also performed
action. Do thou, therefore, perform action, as did the ancients in olden
times. <span id="fr_101"></span>[15](#fn_101)

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

16\. Even sages are bewildered, as to what is action and what is
inaction. I shall therefore tell you what action is, by knowing which
you will be freed from evil. <span id="fr_102"></span>[16](#fn_102)

17\. For verily, (the true nature) even of action (enjoined by the
Shâstras) should

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

be known, as also, (that) of forbidden action, and of inaction: the
nature of Karma is impenetrable.

18\. He who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, he is
intelligent among men, he is a Yogi and a doer of all action. <span
id="fr_103"></span>[18](#fn_103)

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

19\. Whose undertakings are all devoid of plan and desire for results,
and whose actions are burnt by the fire of knowledge, him, the sages
call wise. <span id="fr_104"></span>[19](#fn_104)

20\. Forsaking the clinging to fruits of action, ever satisfied,
depending on nothing, though engaged in action, he does not do anything.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

21\. Without hope, the body and mind controlled and all possessions
relinquished, he does not suffer any evil consequences, by doing mere
bodily action. <span id="fr_105"></span>[21](#fn_105)

22\. Content with what comes to him without effort, unaffected by the
pairs of opposites, free from envy, even-minded in success and failure,
though acting, he is not bound.

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

23\. Devoid of attachment, liberated, with mind centred in knowledge,
performing work for Yajna alone, his whole Karma dissolves away.

24\. The process is Brahman, the clarified butter is Brahman, offered by
Brahman in the fire of Brahman; by seeing Brahman in action, he reaches
Brahman alone. <span id="fr_106"></span>[24](#fn_106)

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

25\. Some Yogis perform sacrifices to Devas alone, while others offer
the self as sacrifice by the self in the fire of Brahman alone. <span
id="fr_107"></span>[25](#fn_107)

26\. Some again offer hearing and other senses as sacrifice in the fire
of control, while others offer sound and other sense-objects as
sacrifice in the fire of the senses. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[26](#fn_108)

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

27\. Some again offer all the actions of the senses and the functions of
the vital energy, as sacrifice in the fire of control in self, kindled
by knowledge.

28\. Others again offer wealth, austerity, and Yoga, as sacrifice, while
still others, of self-restraint and rigid vows, offer study of the
scriptures and knowledge, as sacrifice. <span
id="fr_109"></span>[28](#fn_109)

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

29\. Yet some offer as sacrifice, the outgoing into the in-coming
breath, and the in-coming into the out-going, stopping the courses of
the in-coming and out-going breaths, constantly practising the
regulation of the vital energy; while others yet of regulated food,
offer in the Prânas the functions thereof. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[29](#fn_110)

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

30-31. All of these are knowers of Yajna, having their sins consumed by
Yajna, and eating of the nectar—the remnant of Yajna, they go to the
Eternal Brahman. (Even) this world is not for the non-performer of
Yajna, how then another, O best of the Kurus? <span
id="fr_111"></span>[30](#fn_111)

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

32\. Various Yajnas, like the above, are strewn in the store-house of
the Veda. Know them all to be born of action, and thus knowing, thou
shalt be free. <span id="fr_112"></span>[32](#fn_112)

33\. Knowledge-sacrifice, O scorcher of foes, is superior to sacrifice
(performed) with (material) objects. All action in its

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

entirety, O Pârtha, attains its consummation in knowledge.

34\. Know that, by prostrating thyself, by questions, and by service;
the wise, those who have realised the Truth, will instruct thee in that
knowledge. <span id="fr_113"></span>[34](#fn_113)

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

35\. Knowing which, thou shalt not, O Pândava, again get deluded like
this, and by which thou shalt see the whole of creation in (thy) Self
and in Me. <span id="fr_114"></span>[35](#fn_114)

36\. Even if thou be the most sinful among all the sinful, yet by the
raft of knowledge alone thou shalt go across all sin.

37\. As blazing fire reduces wood into ashes, so, O Arjuna, does the
fire of knowledge reduce all Karma to ashes. <span
id="fr_115"></span>[37](#fn_115)

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

38\. Verily there exists nothing in this world purifying like knowledge.
In good time, having reached perfection in Yoga, one realises that
oneself in one's own heart.

39\. The man with Shraddhâ, the devoted, the master of one's senses,
attains (this) knowledge. Having attained knowledge one goes at once to
the Supreme Peace.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

40\. The ignorant, the man without Shraddhâ, the doubting self, goes to
destruction. The doubting self has neither this world, nor the next, nor
happiness. <span id="fr_116"></span>[40](#fn_116)

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

41\. With work renounced by Yoga and doubts rent asunder by knowledge, O
Dhananjaya, actions do not bind him who is poised in the Self.

42\. Therefore, cutting with the sword of knowledge, this doubt about
the Self, born of ignorance, residing in thy heart, take refuge in Yoga.
Arise, O Bhârata!

The end of chapter four, designated <span class="smallcaps">The Way of
Renunciation of Action in Knowledge.</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_90"></span>[96:1](sbg09.htm#fr_90) *Vivasvat:* the Sun.
*Manu:* the law-giver. Ikshvâku was the famous ancestor of the Solar
dynasty of Kshatriyas.

This Yoga is said to be imperishable, because the end attainable through
it is imperishable.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[97:3](sbg09.htm#fr_91) *Secret:* Not as the
privilege of an individual or a sect, but because of its profundity. It
is a secret to the unworthy only.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[99:6](sbg09.htm#fr_92) *Subjugating My
Prakriti:* He does not come into being as others do, bound by Karma,
under the thraldom of Prakriti (Nature). He is not tied by the fetters
of the Gunas—because He is the Lord of Mâyâ.

*By My own Mâyâ:* My embodiment is only apparent grid does not touch My
true nature.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[99:7](sbg09.htm#fr_93) <span id="page_100">p.
100</span> The Dharma and its opposite Adharma imply all the duties (and
their opposites) as ordained for men in different stations by the
definite scheme of their life and salvation.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[100:8](sbg09.htm#fr_94) *Destruction of the
wicked:* in order to destroy their wickedness, and give them life
eternal.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[100:9](sbg09.htm#fr_95) *He who knows &c.:* He
who knows the great truth,—that the Lord though apparently born is ever
beyond birth and death, though apparently active in the cause of
righteousness, is ever beyond all action,—becomes illumined with
Self-knowledge. Such a man is never born again.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[101:10](sbg09.htm#fr_96) *Many have attained:*
The import is that the path of liberation here taught by Sri Krishna is
not of recent origin, nor is it dependent upon His present
manifestation, but has been handed down from time immemorial.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[102:11](sbg09.htm#fr_97) In this sloka Sri
Krishna anticipates the objection that God is partial to some and unkind
to others, since He blesses some with Self-knowledge and leaves the rest
in darkness and misery. This difference is not due to any difference in
His attitude towards them, but is of their own choice.

*My path:* In the whole region of thought and action, wherever there is
fulfilment of object, no matter what, the same is due to the Lord. As
the Self within, He brings to fruition all wishes, when the necessary
conditions are fulfilled.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[102:12](sbg09.htm#fr_98) <span id="page_103">p.
103</span> *Because success . . . human world:* Worldly success is much
easier of attainment than Self-knowledge. Hence it is that the ignorant
do not go in for the latter.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[103:13](sbg09.htm#fr_99) This sloka is intended
to explain the diversity of human temperaments and tendencies. All men
are not of the same nature, because of the preponderance of the
different Gunas in them.

The caste system was originally meant to make perfect the growth of
humanity, by the special culture of certain features, through the
process of discriminate selection.

*Though I am the author &c.:* The Lord, though the author of the caste
system, is yet not the author. The same dread of being taken as a doer
or an agent crops up again and again. The paradox is explained in Chap.
IX. 5-10. Mâyâ is the real author, but <span id="page_104">p. 104</span>
He is taken as such, because it is His light which gives existence, not
only to all actions, but to Mâyâ herself.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[104:14](sbg09.htm#fr_100) *Actions do not
taint Me:* Karma cannot introduce into Me anything foreign. I never
depart from My true Self, which is All-fullness.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[104:15](sbg09.htm#fr_101) <span
id="page_105">p. 105</span> *Knowing thus:* Taking this point of view,
that is, that the Self can have no desire for the fruits of action and
cannot be soiled by action.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[105:16](sbg09.htm#fr_102) *Evil:* the evil of
existence, the wheel of birth and death.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[106:18](sbg09.htm#fr_103) An action is an
action so long as the idea of actor-ness of the Self holds good.
Directly the idea of actor-ness disappears, no matter what or how much
is done, action has lost its nature. It has become harmless: it can no
longer bind. On the other hand, how much soever inactive an ignorant
person may remain, so long as there is the idea of actor-ness in him, he
is constantly doing action. Action equals to belief in the actor-ness of
oneself and inaction its reverse.

*He is the doer of all action:* He has achieved the end of all action,
which is freedom.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[107:19](sbg09.htm#fr_104) *Whose undertakings
&c.:* Who is devoid of egoism.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[108:21](sbg09.htm#fr_105) *Evil consequences:*
resulting from good and bad actions, for both lead to bondage.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[109:24](sbg09.htm#fr_106) How can the whole
Karma of a person engaged in work melt away as stated here? Because
after knowledge, his whole life becomes one act of Yajna, in which the
process of oblation, the offering, the fire, the doer of the sacrifice,
the work, and the goal, are all Brahman. Since his Karma produces no
other result than the attainment of Brahman, his Karma is said to melt
away.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[110:25](sbg09.htm#fr_107) *Others offer &c.:*
The sacrifice referred to here, is, divesting the Self of Its Upâdhis
(limiting adjuncts), so that It is found to be the Self.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[110:26](sbg09.htm#fr_108) *Others offer sound
&c.:* Others direct their senses towards pure and unforbidden objects,
and in so doing regard themselves as performing acts of sacrifice.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[111:28](sbg09.htm#fr_109) *Offer Yoga as
sacrifice:* Practise the eightfold Yoga as an act of sacrifice.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[112:29](sbg09.htm#fr_110) *Offer in the Prânas
the functions thereof:* Whatever Prâna has been controlled, into it they
sacrifice all other Prânas; these latter become, as it were, merged in
the former. Or, in another way: They control the different Prânas and
unify them by the foregoing method; the senses are thus attenuated and
are merged in the unified Prâna, as an act of sacrifice. <span
id="page_113">p. 113</span>

All the various acts described in verses 25 to 29, as offerings of
sacrifice, are only conceived as such, the study of the scriptures is
regarded as an act of sacrifice, and so on.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[113:30](sbg09.htm#fr_111) *They go to the
Eternal Brahman:* in course of time, after attaining knowledge through
purification of heart.

*Even this world is not for the non-performer of Yajna:* this means,—he
that does not perform any <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> of the
Yajnas above mentioned, is not fit even for this wretched human
world,—how then could he hope to gain a better world than this?

<span id="fn_112"></span>[114:32](sbg09.htm#fr_112) *Strewn in the
store-house of the Veda:* inculcated by or known through the Veda.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[115:34](sbg09.htm#fr_113) Prostration before
the Guru, questions and personal services to him, constitute
discipleship.

*Those who have realised the Truth:* mere theoretical knowledge, however
perfect, does not qualify a person to be a Guru: the Truth, or Brahman,
must be realised, before one can claim that most elevated position.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[116:35](sbg09.htm#fr_114) *Which:* the
knowledge referred to in the preceding sloka to be learnt from the Guru.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[116:37](sbg09.htm#fr_115) <span
id="page_117">p. 117</span> Excepting of course the Prârabdha, or Karma
which, causing the present body, has begun to bear fruits.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[118:40](sbg09.htm#fr_116) *The ignorant:* one
who knows not the Self.

*The man without Shraddhâ:* one who has no faith in the words and
teachings of his Guru.

*The doubting self has &c.:* One of a doubting disposition fails to
enjoy this world, owing to his constantly rising suspicion about the
people, and things around him, and is also full of doubt as regards the
next world; so do the ignorant and the man without Shraddhâ.
