### SIXTH BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_312"></span>[1](#fn_312).

1\. Verily this is a triad, name, form, and work. Of these names, that
which is called Speech is the Uktha (hymn, supposed to mean also
origin), for from it all names arise. It is their Sâman (song, supposed
to mean also sameness), for it is the same as all names. It is their
Brahman (prayer, supposed to mean also support), for it supports all
names.

2\. Next, of the forms, that which is called Eye is the Uktha (hymn),
for from it all forms arise. It is their Sâman (song), for it is the
same as all forms. It is their Brahman (prayer), for it supports all
forms.

3\. Next, of the works, that which is called Body is the Uktha (hymn),
for from it all works arise. It is their Sâman (song), for it is the
same as all works. It is their Brahman (prayer), for it supports all
works.

That being a triad is one, viz. this Self; and the Self, being one, is
that triad. This is the immortal, covered by the true. Verily breath is
the immortal, name and form are the true, and by them the immortal is
covered.
