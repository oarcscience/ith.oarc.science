### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_327"></span>[2](#fn_327).

1\. Verily he who knows the babe <span id="fr_328"></span>[3](#fn_328)
with his place <span id="fr_329"></span>[4](#fn_329), his chamber <span
id="fr_330"></span>[5](#fn_330), his post <span
id="fr_331"></span>[6](#fn_331), and his rope <span
id="fr_332"></span>[7](#fn_332), he keeps off the seven relatives <span
id="fr_333"></span>[8](#fn_333) who hate him. Verily by the young is
meant the inner life, by his place this (body) <span
id="fr_334"></span>[9](#fn_334), by his chamber this (head), by his post
the vital breath, by his rope the food.

2\. Then the seven imperishable ones <span
id="fr_335"></span>[10](#fn_335) approach him. There are the red lines
in the eye, and by them Rudra clings to him. There is the water

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

in the eye, and by it Par*g*anya clings to him. There is the pupil, and
by it Âditya (sun) clings to him, There is the dark iris, and by it Agni
clings to him. There is the white eye-ball, and by it Indra, clings to
him. With the lower eye-lash the earth, with the upper eye-lash the
heaven clings to him. He who knows this, his food does never perish.

3\. On this there is this *S*loka:

'There <span id="fr_336"></span>[1](#fn_336) is a cup having its mouth
below and its bottom above. Manifold glory has been placed into it. On
its lip sit the seven *Ri*shis, the tongue as the eighth communicates
with Brahman.' What is called the cup having its mouth below and its
bottom above is this head, for its mouth (the mouth) is below, its
bottom (the skull) is above. When it is said that manifold glory has
been placed into it, the senses verily are manifold glory, and he
therefore means the senses. When he says that the seven *Ri*shis sit on
its lip, the *Ri*shis are verily the (active) senses, and he means the
senses. And when he says that the tongue as the eighth communicates with
Brahman, it is because the tongue, as the eighth, does communicate with
Brahman.

4\. These two (the two ears) are the *Ri*shis Gautama and Bharadvâ*g*a;
the right Gautama, the left Bharadvâ*g*a. These two (the eyes) are the
*Ri*shis Vi*s*vâmitra and *G*amadagni; the right Vi*s*vâmitra, the left
*G*amadagni. These two (the nostrils) are the *Ri*shis Vasish*th*a and
Ka*s*yapa; the right Vasish*th*a, the left Ka*s*yapa. The tongue is
Atri, for with the tongue food is eaten, and Atri is meant for Atti,
eating. He who knows this, becomes an eater of everything, and
everything becomes his food.
