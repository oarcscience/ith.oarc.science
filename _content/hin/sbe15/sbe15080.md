### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. The threefold descendants of Pra*g*âpati, gods, men, and Asuras
(evil spirits), dwelt as; Brahma*k*ârins (students) with their father
Pra*g*âpati. Having finished their studentship the gods said: 'Tell us
(something), Sir.' He told them the syllable Da. Then he said: 'Did you
understand?' They said: 'We did understand. You told us "Dâmyata," Be
subdued.' 'Yes,' he said, 'you have understood.'

2\. Then the men said to him: 'Tell us something,

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sir.' He told them
the same syllable Da. Then he said: 'Did you understand?' They said: 'We
did understand. You told us, "Datta," Give.' 'Yes,' he said, 'you have
understood.'

3\. Then the Asuras said to him: 'Tell us something, Sir.' He told them
the same syllable Da. Then he said: 'Did you understand?' They said: 'We
did understand. You told us, "Dayadham," Be merciful.' 'Yes,' he said,
'you have understood.'

The divine voice of thunder repeats the same, Da Da Da, that is, Be
subdued, Give, Be merciful. Therefore let that triad be taught,
Subduing, Giving, and Mercy.
