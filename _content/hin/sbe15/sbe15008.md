*The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VI.

## PRA*SÑ*A-UPANISHAD.

THIS Upanishad is called the Pra*sñ*a or Sha*t*-pra*sñ*a-upanishad, and
at the end of a chapter we find occasionally iti pra*sñ*aprativa*k*anam,
i.e. thus ends the answer to the question. It is ascribed to the
Atharva-veda, and occasionally to the Pippalâda-*s*âkhâ, one of the most
important *s*âkhâs of that Veda. Pippalâda is mentioned in the Upanishad
as the name of the principal teacher.

*S*aṅkara, in the beginning of his commentary, says:

<span id="page_xliii">p. xliii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Mantroktasyârthasya vistarânuvâdidam Brâhma*n*am ârabhyate, which would
mean 'this Brâhma*n*a is commenced as more fully repeating what has been
declared in the Mantra.' This, however, does not, I believe, refer to a
Mantra or hymn in the Atharva-veda-samhitâ, but to the
Mu*nd*aka-upanishad, which, as written in verse, is sometimes spoken of
as a Mantra, or Mantropanishad. This is also the opinion of Ânandagiri,
who says, I one might think that it was mere repetition (punarukti), if
the essence of the Self, which has been explained by the Mantras, were
to be taught here again by the Brâhma*n*a.' For he adds, 'by the Mantras
"Brahma devânâm," &c.,' and this is evidently meant for the beginning of
the Mu*nd*aka-upanishad, 'Brahmâ devânâm.' Ânandagiri refers again to
the Mu*nd*aka in order to show that the Pra*sñ*a is not a mere
repetition, and if *S*aṅkara calls the beginning of it a Brâhma*n*a,
this must be taken in the more general sense of 'what is not
Mantra <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51).' Mantropanishad is a name
used of several Upanishads which are written in verse, and some of
which, like the Î*s*â, have kept their place in the Sa*m*hitâs.
