<p>1. Now when Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya was going to enter upon another state, he said: 'Maitrey&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, verily I am going away from this my house (into the forest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>). Forsooth, let me make a settlement between thee and that K&acirc;ty&acirc;yan&icirc; (my other wife).'</p>  
<p>2. Maitrey&icirc; said: 'My Lord, if this whole earth, full of wealth, belonged to me, tell me, should I be immortal by it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>?'</p>

<p>'No,' replied Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya; 'like the life of rich people will be thy life. But there is no hope of immortality by wealth.'</p>  
<p>3. And Maitrey&icirc; said: 'What should I do with that by which I do not become immortal? What my Lord knoweth (of immortality), tell that to me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>4. Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya replied: 'Thou who art truly dear to me, thou speakest dear words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Come, sit down, I will explain it to thee, and mark well what I say.'</p>  
<p>5. And he said: 'Verily, a husband is not dear, that you may love the husband; but that you may love the Self, therefore a husband is dear.</p>  
<p>'Verily, a wife is not dear, that you may love the wife; but that you may love the Self, therefore a wife is dear.</p>

<p>'Verily, creatures are not dear, that you may love the creatures; but that you may love the Self, therefore are creatures dear.</p>  
<p>'Verily, everything is not dear that you may love everything; but that you may love the Self, therefore everything is dear.</p>  
<p>'Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be perceived, to be marked, O Maitrey&icirc;! When we see, hear, perceive, and know the Self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_348"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, then all this is known.</p>  
<p>6. 'Whosoever looks for the Brahman-class elsewhere than in the Self, was&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> abandoned by the Brahman-class. Whosoever looks for the Kshatra-class elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the Kshatra-class. Whosoever looks for the worlds elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the worlds.

<p>7. 'Now as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> the sounds of a drum, when beaten,</p>

<p>8., And as the sounds of a conch-shell, when blown, cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the shell is seized or the blower of the shell;</p>  
<p>9. 'And as the sounds of a lute, when played, cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the lute is seized or the player of the lute;</p>  
<p>10. 'As clouds of smoke proceed by themselves out of a lighted fire kindled with damp fuel, thus, verily, O Maitrey&icirc;, has been breathed forth from this great Being what we have as <I>Ri</I>g-veda, Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, Sama-veda, Atharv&acirc;&#7749;girasas, Itih&acirc;sa (legends), Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a (cosmogonies), Vidy&acirc; (knowledge), the Upanishads, <I>S</I>lokas (verses), S&ucirc;tras (prose rules), Anuvy&acirc;khy&acirc;nas (glosses), Vy&acirc;khy&acirc;nas (commentaries)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. From him alone all these were breathed forth.</p>  
<p>11. 'As all waters find their centre in the sea, all touches in the skin, all tastes in the tongue, all smells in the nose, all colours in the eye, all sounds in the ear, all percepts in the mind, all knowledge in the heart, all actions in the hands, all movements in the feet, and all the Vedas in speech,--</p>  
<p>12. 'As a lump of salt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, when thrown into water, becomes dissolved into water, and could not be taken</p>

<p>13. Then Maitrey&icirc; said: 'Here thou hast bewildered me, Sir, when thou sayest that having departed, there is no more knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>But Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya replied: 'O Maitrey&icirc;, I say nothing that is bewildering. This is enough, O beloved, for wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_340"></A><A HREF="sbe15061.htm#fr_340">108:2</A> M&acirc;dhyandina text, p. 1062. To the end of the third Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the second Adhy&acirc;ya, all that has been taught does not yet impart the highest knowledge, the identity of the personal and the true Self, the Brahman. In the fourth Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, in which the knowledge of the true Brahman is to be set forth, the Sa<I>m</I>ny&acirc;sa, the retiring from the world, is enjoined, when all desires cease, and no duties are to be performed (Sa<I>m</I>ny&acirc;sa, p&acirc;riv&acirc;<I>g</I>ya). The story is told again with slight variations in the B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka-upanishad IV, 5. The more important variations, occurring in IV, 5, are added here, marked with B. There are besides the various readings of the M&acirc;dhyandina<I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; of the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. See also Deussen, Ved&acirc;nta, p. 185.</P>
