<p>proclaimed to you the honey, both that of Tvasht<I>ri</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and that which is to be your secret, O ye strong ones.</p>  
<p>18. Verily Dadhyak &Acirc;tharva<I>n</I>a proclaimed this honey to the two A<I>s</I>vins, and a <I>Ri</I>shi, seeing this, said:</p>  
<p>'He (the Lord) made bodies with two feet, he made bodies with four feet. Having first become a bird, he entered the bodies as purusha (as the person).' This very purusha is in all bodies the puri<I>s</I>aya, i.e. he who lies in the body (and is therefore called purusha). There is nothing that is not covered by him, nothing that is not filled by him.</p>

<p>'He (the Lord) became like unto every form&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and this is meant to reveal the (true) form of him (the &Acirc;tman). Indra (the Lord) appears multiform through the M&acirc;y&acirc;s (appearances), for his horses (senses) are yoked, hundreds and ten.'</p>  
<p>This (&Acirc;tman) is the horses, this (&Acirc;tman) is the ten, and the thousands, many and endless. This is the Brahman, without cause and without effect, without anything inside or outside; this Self is Brahman, omnipresent and omniscient. This is the teaching (of the Upanishads).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_368"></A><A HREF="sbe15061.htm#fr_368">113:1</A> Instead of the last line, B. adds (IV, 5, 15): That Self is to be described by No, no! He is incomprehensible, for be cannot be comprehended; he is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. How, O beloved, should he know the Knower? Thus, O Maitrey&icirc;, thou hast been instructed. Thus far goes immortality.' Having said so, Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya went away (into the forest). 15. See also <I>Kh</I>&acirc;nd. Up. VII, 24, 1.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_370"></A><A HREF="sbe15062.htm#fr_370">113:3</A> Madhu, honey, seems to be taken here as an instance of something which is both cause and effect, or rather of things which are mutually dependent on each other, or cannot exist without one other. As the bees make the honey, and the honey makes or supports the bees, bees and honey are both cause and effect, or at all events are mutually dependent on one other. In the same way the earth and all living beings are looked upon as mutually dependent, living beings presupposing the earth, and the earth presupposing living beings. This at all events seems to be the general idea of what is called the Madhuvidy&acirc;, the science of honey, which Dadhya<I>k</I> communicated to the A<I>s</I>vins.</P>

The knowledge of this rite forms the honey of Tvasht<I>ri</I>. The other honey which is to be kept secret is the knowledge of the Self, as taught before in the Madhu-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.</P>
