### EIGHTH ANUVÂKA.

\(1\) 'From terror of it (Brahman) the wind blows, from terror the sun
rises; from terror of it Agni and Indra, yea Death runs as the
fifth <span id="fr_225"></span>[3](#fn_225).'

Now this is an examination of (what is meant by) Bliss (ânanda):

Let there be a noble young man, who is well read (in the Veda), very
swift, firm, and strong, and let the whole world be full of wealth for
him, that is one measure of human bliss.

One hundred times that human bliss (2) is one measure of the bliss of
human Gandharvas (genii),

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

and likewise of a great sage (learned in the Vedas) who is free from
desires.

One hundred times that bliss of human Gandharvas is one measure of the
bliss of divine Gandharvas (genii), and likewise of a great sage who is
free from desires.

One hundred times that bliss of divine Gandharvas is one measure of the
bliss of the Fathers, enjoying their long estate, and likewise of a
great sage who is free from desires.

One hundred times that bliss of the Fathers is one measure of the bliss
of the Devas, born in the Â*g*âna heaven (through the merit of their
lawful works), (3) and likewise of a great sage who is free from
desires.

One hundred times that bliss of the Devas born in the Â*g*âna heaven is
one measure of the bliss of the sacrificial Devas, who go to the Devas
by means of their Vaidik sacrifices, and likewise of a great sage who is
free from desires.

One hundred times that bliss of the sacrificial Devas is one measure of
the bliss of the (thirty-three) Devas, and likewise of a great sage who
is free from desires.

One hundred times that bliss of the (thirty-three) Devas is one measure
of the bliss of Indra, (4) and likewise of a great sage who is free from
desires.

One hundred times that bliss of Indra is one measure of the bliss of
B*ri*haspati, and likewise of a great sage who is free from desires.

One hundred times that bliss of B*ri*haspati is one measure of the bliss
of Pra*g*âpati, and likewise of a great sage who is free from desires.

One hundred times that bliss of Pra*g*âpati is one

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

measure of the bliss of Brahman, and likewise of a great sage who is
free from desires.

\(5\) He <span id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_226) who is this (Brahman) in
man, and he who is that (Brahman) in the sun, both are one <span
id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_227).

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

He who knows this, when he has departed this world, reaches and
comprehends the Self which consists of food, the Self which consists of
breath, the Self which consists of mind, the Self which consists of
understanding, the Self which consists of bliss.

On this there is also this *S*loka:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_225"></span>[59:3](sbe15041.htm#fr_225) Ka*th*. Up. VI, 3.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[61:1](sbe15041.htm#fr_226) Cf. III, 10, 4.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[61:2](sbe15041.htm#fr_227) In giving the
various degrees of happiness, the author of the Upanishad gives us at
the same time the various classes of human and divine beings which we
must suppose were recognised in his time. We have Men, human Gandharvas,
divine Gandharvas, Fathers (pitara*s* *k*iralokalokâ*h*), born Gods
(âgâna*g*â devâ*h*), Gods by merit (karmadevâ*h*), Gods, Indra,
B*ri*haspati, Pra*g*âpati, Brahman. Such a list would seem to be the
invention of an individual rather than the result of an old tradition,
if it did not occur in a very similar form in the
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a, Mâdhyandina-*s*âkhâ XIV, 7, 1 ,31,
Kâ*n*va-*s*âkhâ (B*ri*h. Âr. Up. IV, 3, 32). Here, too, the highest
measure of happiness is ascribed to the Brahmaloka, and other beings are
supposed to share a certain measure only of its supreme happiness. The
scale begins in the Mâdhyandina-*s*âkhâ with men, who are followed by
the Fathers (pitaro *g*italokâ*h*), the Gods by merit (karmadevâ*h*),
the Gods by birth (âgânadevâ*h*, with whom the *S*rotriya is joined),
the world of Gods, the world of Gandharvas, the world of Pra*g*âpati,
the world of Brahman. In the B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka-upanishad we have Men,
Fathers, Gandharvas, Gods by merit, Gods by birth, Pra*g*âpati, and
Brahman. If we place the three lists side by side, we find--

The commentators do not help us much. *S*aṅkara on the
Taittirîyaka-upanishad <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> explains the
human Gandharvas as men who have become Gandharvas, a kind of fairies;
divine Gandharvas, as Gandharvas by birth. The Fathers or Manes are
called Kiraloka, because they remain long, though not for ever, in their
world. The âgâna*g*a Gods are explained as born in the world of the
Devas through their good works (smârta), while the Karmadevas are
explained as born there through their sacred works (vaidika). The Gods
are the thirty-three, whose lord is Indra, and whose teacher
B*ri*haspati. Pra*g*âpati is Virâ*g*, Brahman Hira*n*yagarbha.
Dvivedagaṅga, in his commentary on the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a, explains
the Fathers as those who, proceeding on the Southern path, have
conquered their world, more particularly by having themselves offered in
their life sacrifices to their Fathers. The Karmadevas, according to
him, are those who have become Devas by sacred works (*s*rauta), the
Âgânadevas those who were gods before there were men. The Gods are Indra
and the rest, while the Gandharvas are not explained. Pra*g*âpati is
Virâ*g*, Brahman is Hira*n*yagarbha. Lastly, *S*aṅkara, in his
commentary on the B*ri*hadâra*n*yakaupanishad, gives nearly the same
explanation as before; only that he makes âgânadevâ*h* still clearer, by
explaining them as gods âgânata*h*, i.e. utpattita*h*, from their birth.

The arrangement of these beings and their worlds, one rising above the
other, reminds us of the cosmography of the Buddhists, but the elements,
though in a less systematic form, existed evidently before. Thus we find
in the so-called Gargî-brâhma*n*a (Satapatha-brâhma*n*a XIV, 6, 6, 1)
the following succession: Water, air, ether <span
id="fr_228"></span>[a](#fn_228), the worlds of the sky <span
id="fr_229"></span>[b](#fn_229), heaven, sun, moon, stars, gods,
Gandharvas <span id="fr_230"></span>[c](#fn_230), Pra*g*âpati, Brahman.
In the Kaushîtaki-upanishad I, 3 (Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p.
275) there is another series, the worlds of Agni, Vâyu, Varu*n*a, Indra,
Pra*g*âpati, and Brahman. See Weber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 224.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[61:a](sbe15041.htm#fr_228) Deest in
Kânva-*s*âkhâ.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[61:b](sbe15041.htm#fr_229) Between sky and
sun, the Kâ*n*va-*s*âkhâ places the Gandharvaloka (B*ri*h. Âr. Up. III,
6, 1, p. 609).

<span id="fn_230"></span>[61:c](sbe15041.htm#fr_230) Instead of
Gandharvas, the B*ri*h. Âr. Up. places Indra.
