### THIRD QUESTION.

1\. Then Kausalya Â*s*valâyana asked: 'Sir, whence is that Prâ*n*a
(spirit) born? How does it come into this body? And how does it abide,
after it has divided itself? How does it go out? How does it support
what is without <span id="fr_892"></span>[4](#fn_890), and how what is
within?'

2\. He replied: 'You ask questions more difficult, but you are very fond
of Brahman, therefore I shall tell it you.

3\. This Prâ*n*a (spirit) is born of the Self. Like the shadow thrown on
a man, this (the prâ*n*a) is

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

spread out over it (the Brahman) <span id="fr_893"></span>[1](#fn_891).
By the work of the mind <span id="fr_894"></span>[2](#fn_892) does it
come into this body.

4\. As a king commands officials, saying to them: Rule these villages or
those, so does that Prâ*n*a (spirit) dispose the other prâ*n*as, each
for their separate work.

5\. The Apâna (the down-breathing) in the organs of excretion and
generation; the Prâ*n*a himself dwells in eye and ear, passing through
mouth and nose. In the middle is the Samâna <span
id="fr_895"></span>[3](#fn_893) (the on-breathing); it carries what has
been sacrificed as food equally (over the body), and the seven lights
proceed from it.

6\. The Self <span id="fr_896"></span>[4](#fn_894) is in the heart.
There are the 101 arteries, and in each of them there are a hundred
(smaller veins), and for each of these branches there are 72,000 <span
id="fr_897"></span>[5](#fn_895). In these the Vyâna (the back-breathing)
moves.

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

7\. Through one of them, the Udâna (the out-breathing) leads (us)
upwards to the good world by good work, to the bad world by bad work, to
the world of men by both.

8\. The sun rises as the external Prâ*n*a, for it assists the Prâ*n*a in
the eye <span id="fr_898"></span>[1](#fn_896). The deity that exists in
the earth, is there in support of man's Apâna (down-breathing). The
ether between (sun and earth) is the Samâna (on-breathing), the air is
Vyâna (back-breathing).

9\. Light is the Udâna (out-breathing), and therefore he whose light has
gone out comes to a new birth with his senses absorbed in the mind.

10\. Whatever his thought (at the time of death) with that he goes back
to Prâ*n*a, and the Prâ*n*a, united with light <span
id="fr_899"></span>[2](#fn_897), together with the self (the *g*îvâtmâ)
leads on to the world, as deserved.

11\. He who, thus knowing, knows Prâ*n*a, his offspring does not perish,
and he becomes immortal. Thus says the *S*loka:

12\. He who has known the origin <span id="fr_900"></span>[3](#fn_898),
the entry, the place, the fivefold distribution, and the internal
state <span id="fr_901"></span>[4](#fn_899) of the Prâ*n*a, obtains
immortality, yes, obtains immortality.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_890"></span>[276:4](sbe15108.htm#fr_892) All creatures and
the gods.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[277:1](sbe15108.htm#fr_893) Over Brahman, i.e.
the Self, the parama purusha, the akshara, the satya. The prâ*n*a being
called a shadow, is thereby implied to be unreal (an*ri*ta). *S*aṅkara.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[277:2](sbe15108.htm#fr_894) Manok*ri*ta is
explained as an ârsha sandhi. It means the good or evil deeds, which are
the work of the mind.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[277:3](sbe15108.htm#fr_895) I keep to the
usual translation of Samâna by on-breathing, though it is here explained
in a different sense. Samâna is here supposed to be between prâ*n*a and
apâna, and to distribute the food equally, samam, over the body. The
seven lights are explained as the two eyes, the two ears, the two
nostrils, and the mouth.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[277:4](sbe15108.htm#fr_896) Here the Liṅgâtmâ
or *G*îvâtmâ.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[277:5](sbe15108.htm#fr_897) A hundred times
101 would give us 10,100, and each multiplied by 72,000 would give us a
sum total of 727,200,000 veins, or, if we add the principal veins,
727,210,201. Ânandagiri makes the sum total, 72 ko*t*is, 72 lakshas, six
thousands, two hundred and one, where the six of the thousands seems to
be a mistake for da*s*asahasram. In the B*ri*hadâr. Upanishad II, 1, 19,
we read of 72,000 arteries, likewise in Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 108. See also
B*ri*h. Up. IV, <span id="page_278">p. 278</span>3, 20; *Kh*ând. Up. VI,
5, 3, comm.; Kaush. Up. IV, 20; Ka*th*a Up. VI, 16.

<span id="fn_896"></span>[278:1](sbe15108.htm#fr_898) Without the sun
the eye could not see.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[278:2](sbe15108.htm#fr_899) With Udâna, the
out-breathing

<span id="fn_898"></span>[278:3](sbe15108.htm#fr_900) This refers to the
questions asked in verse 1, and answered in the verses which follow.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[278:4](sbe15108.htm#fr_901) The adhyâtma, as
opposed to the vâhya, mentioned in verse 1. Ayati instead of âyâti is
explained by *kh*ândasa*m* hrasvatvam.
