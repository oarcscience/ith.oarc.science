<p>1. Then the Saint <I>S</I>&acirc;k&acirc;yanya, well pleased, said to the King: 'Great King B<I>ri</I>hadratha, thou banner of the race of Ikshv&acirc;ku, quickly obtaining a knowledge of Self, thou art happy, and art renowned by the name of Marut, the wind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_944"></A><A HREF="#fn_941"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

<p>'Which&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_946"></A><A HREF="#fn_943"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, O Saint,' said the King.</p>  
<p>Then the Saint said to him:</p>

Thus said the Saint Maitri&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_950"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.' And <I>S</I>&acirc;k&acirc;yanya said to the King B<I>ri</I>hadratha: 'He who in perfect rest, rising from this body (both from the sth&ucirc;la and s&ucirc;kshma), and reaching the highest</p>

<p>3. 'Now then this is the science of Brahman, and the science of all Upanishads, O King, which was told us by the Saint Maitri&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_953"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. I shall tell it to thee:</p>  
<p>'We hear (in the sacred records) that there were once the V&acirc;lakhilyas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_954"></A><A HREF="#fn_951"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, who had left off all evil, who were vigorous and passionless. They said to the Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati Kratu: "O Saint, this body is without intelligence, like a cart. To what supernatural being belongs this great power by which such a body has been made intelligent? Or who is the driver? What thou knowest, O Saint, tell us that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_955"></A><A HREF="#fn_952"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>."' Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati answered and said:</p>  
<p>4. 'He who in the Sruti is called "Standing above," like passionless ascetics&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_956"></A><A HREF="#fn_953"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> amidst the objects of the world, he, indeed, the pure, clean, undeveloped, tranquil, breathless, bodiless&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_957"></A><A HREF="#fn_954"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, endless, imperishable, firm, everlasting, unborn, independent one, stands in his own greatness, and by him has this body been made intelligent, and he is also the driver of it.'</p>

<p>They said: 'O Saint, How has this been made intelligent by such a being as this which has no desires&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_958"></A><A HREF="#fn_955"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and how is he its driver?' He answered them and said:</p>  
<p>5. 'That Self which is very small, invisible, incomprehensible, called Purusha, dwells of his own will here in part&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_959"></A><A HREF="#fn_956"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; just as a man who is fast asleep awakes of his own will&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_960"></A><A HREF="#fn_957"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. And this part (of the Self) which is entirely intelligent, reflected in man (as the sun in different vessels of water), knowing the body (kshetra<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a), attested by his conceiving, willing, and believing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_961"></A><A HREF="#fn_958"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (lord of creatures), called Vi<I>s</I>va. By him, the intelligent, is this body made intelligent, and he is the driver thereof.'</p>  
<p>They said to him: 'O Saint&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_962"></A><A HREF="#fn_959"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, if this has been made intelligent by such a being as this, which has no desires, and if he is the driver thereof, how was it?' He answered them and said:</p>  
<p>6. 'In the beginning Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (the lord of creatures) stood alone. He had no happiness, when alone. Meditating&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_963"></A><A HREF="#fn_960"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> on himself, he created many</p>

<p>creatures. He looked on them and saw they were, like a stone, without understanding, and standing like a lifeless post. He had no happiness. He thought, I shall enter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_964"></A><A HREF="#fn_961"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> within, that they may awake. Making himself like air (v&acirc;yu)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_965"></A><A HREF="#fn_962"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he entered within. Being one, he could not do it. Then dividing himself fivefold, he is called Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, Ap&acirc;na, Sam&acirc;na, Ud&acirc;na, Vy&acirc;na. Now that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_966"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> air which rises upwards, is Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a. That which moves downwards, is Ap&acirc;na. That by which these two are supposed to be held, is Vy&acirc;na. That&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_967"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> which carries the grosser material of food to the Ap&acirc;na, and brings the subtler material to each limb, has the name Sam&acirc;na. [After these (Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, Ap&acirc;na, Sam&acirc;na) comes the work of the Vy&acirc;na, and between them (the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, Ap&acirc;na, and Sam&acirc;na on one side and the Vy&acirc;na on the other) comes the rising of the Ud&acirc;na.] That which brings up or carries down&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_968"></A><A HREF="#fn_965"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> what has been drunk and eaten, is the Ud&acirc;na&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_969"></A><A HREF="#fn_966"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>

This heat is the purusha (person), and this purusha is Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara. And thus it is said elsewhere&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_972"></A><A HREF="#fn_969"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: "Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara is the fire within man by which the food that is eaten is cooked, i.e. digested. Its noise is that which one hears, if one covers one's ears. When a man is on the point of departing this life, he does not hear that noise."</p>  
<p>Now he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_973"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, having divided himself fivefold, is hidden in a secret place (buddhi), assuming the nature of mind, having the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as as his body, resplendent, having true concepts, and free like ether&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_971"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. Feeling even thus that he has not attained his object, he thinks from within the interior of the heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_972"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, "Let me enjoy objects." Therefore, having first broken open these five apertures (of the senses), he enjoys the objects by means of the five reins. This means that these perceptive organs (ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose) are his reins; the active organs (tongue (for speaking), hands, feet, anus, generative organ) his horses; the body his chariot, the mind the charioteer, the whip being the temperament. Driven by that whip, this body goes round like the</p>

<p>This&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_973"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is indeed the Self, who seeming to be filled with desires, and seeming to be overcome&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_977"></A><A HREF="#fn_974"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by bright or dark fruits of action, wanders about in every body (himself remaining free). Because he is not manifest, because he is infinitely small, because he is invisible, because he cannot be grasped, because he is attached to nothing, therefore he, seeming to be changing, an agent in that which is not (prak<I>ri</I>ti), is in reality not an agent and unchanging. He is pure, firm, stable, undefiled&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_978"></A><A HREF="#fn_975"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, unmoved, free from desire, remaining a spectator, resting in himself Having concealed himself in the cloak of the three qualities he appears as the enjoyer of <I>ri</I>ta, as the enjoyer of <I>ri</I>ta (of his good works).'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_953"></A><A HREF="sbe15113.htm#fr_956">291:6</A> The commentator allows &ucirc;trdhvaretasasa<I>h</I> to be taken as a vocative also.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_954"></A><A HREF="sbe15113.htm#fr_957">291:7</A> Nir&acirc;tm&acirc; is explained by the commentator as thoughtless, without volition, &amp;c. But &acirc;tm&acirc; is frequently used for body also, and this seems more appropriate here. M., however, reads an&icirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;tm&acirc;, and this is the reading explained in the Anubh&ucirc;tiprak&acirc;<I>s</I>a, p. 228, ver. 60. This might mean the &Acirc;tman which has not yet assumed the quality of a personal god. See VI, 28; VI, 31.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_955"></A><A HREF="sbe15113.htm#fr_958">292:1</A> The reading anish<I>th</I>ena is explained by the commentator as free from any local habitation or attachment. He also mentions the various readings anish<I>t</I>ena, free from wishes, and anish<I>th</I>ena, the smallest. M. reads ani<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ena, and this seems better than anish<I>t</I>ena. The Anubh&ucirc;tiprak&acirc;<I>s</I>a reads likewise ani<I>k</I><I>kh</I>asya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_956"></A><A HREF="sbe15113.htm#fr_959">292:2</A> I read buddhip&ucirc;rvam, and again with M. suptasyeva buddhip&ucirc;rvam. I also read a<I>m</I>sena without iti, as in M. The simile seems to be that a man, if he likes, can wake himself at any time of night, and this 'if he likes' is expressed by buddhip&ucirc;rvam. See Anubh&ucirc;tiprak&acirc;<I>s</I>a, vv. 67, 68.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_966"></A><A HREF="sbe15113.htm#fr_969">293:6</A> The views of these five kinds of wind differ considerably. Here the commentator explains that the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a and ap&acirc;na, the up-breathing and down-breathing, keep the bodily warmth alive, as bellows keep up a fire. The food cooked in it is distributed by the Sam&acirc;na, so that the coarse material becomes ordure, the middle flesh, the subtle material mind (manas). The ud&acirc;na brings up phlegm, &amp;c., while the Vy&acirc;na gives strength to the whole body.</P>
