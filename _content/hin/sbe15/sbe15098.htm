<p>For reasons of Victorian modesty, M&uuml;ller left certain aspects of the Brihad&acirc;ranyaka Upanishad, VI, 4, untranslated. This is because this particular Br&acirc;hmana has passages which discuss aspects of Vedic era sex magic. To fill in the gap, I have appended a 1921 translation of the same Br&acirc;hmana. This is from the translation of Robert Ernest Hume, and includes English translations of the passages M&uuml;ller left untranslated. Note that Hume uses a slightly different transcription method for Sanskrit than the SBE system.--J. B. Hare.</p>  <h1 align="center">Brihad&acirc;ranyaka Upanishad</h1>

<p align="center"><b>Incantations and ceremonies for procreation</b></p>  
<p>1. Verily, of created things here earth is the essence; of earth, water; of water, plants; of plants, flowers; of flowers, fruits; of fruits, man (<i>puru<u>s</u>a</i>); of man, semen.</p>  
<p>2. Praj&acirc;pati ('Lord of creatures') bethought himself: 'Come, let me provide him a firm basis!' So he created woman. When he had created her, he revered her below.--Therefore one should revere woman below.--He stretched out for himself that stone which projects. With that he impregnated her.</p>  
<p>3. Her lap is a sacrificial altar; her hairs, the sacrificial grass; her skin, the soma-press. The two labia of the vulva are the fire in the middle. Verily, indeed, as great as is the world of him who sacrifices with the V&acirc;japeya ('Strength-libation') sacrifice, so great is the world of him who practises sexual intercourse, knowing this; he turns the good deeds of women to himself. But he who practises sexual intercourse without knowing this-women turn his good deeds unto themselves.</p>  
<p>4. This, verily, indeed, it was that Udd&acirc;laka &Acirc;ru&#7749;i knew when he said:--</p>  
<p>This, verily, indeed, it was that N&acirc;ka Maudgalya knew when he said:--</p>  
<p>This, verily, indeed, it was that Kum&acirc;rah&acirc;rita knew when he said: 'Many mortal men, Brahmans by descent, go forth from this world, impotent and devoid of merit, namely those who practise sexual intercourse without knowing this.'</p>  
<p>[If] even this much&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_675"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> semen is spilled, whether of one asleep or of one awake, [5] then he should touch it, or [without touching] repeat:--</p>  
<p>'What semen has of mine to earth been spilt now,<br> Whate'er to herb has flowed, whate'er to water--</p>  
<p>This very semen I reclaim!<br> Again to me let vigor come!<br> Again, my strength; again, my glow!<br> Again the altars and the fire<br> Be found in their accustomed place!'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_169hume"><font size="1" color="green">p. 169hume</font></A></p>  
<p>Having spoken thus, he should take it with ring-finger and thumb, and rub it on between his breasts or his eye-brows.</p>  
<p>6. Now, if one should see himself in water, he should recite over it the formula: 'In me be vigor, power, beauty, wealth, merit!'</p>  
<p>This, verily, indeed, is loveliness among women: when she has removed the clothes of her impurity. Therefore when she has removed the clothes of her impurity and is beautiful, one should approach and invite her.</p>  
<p>7. If she should not grant him his desire, he should bribe her. If she still does not grant him his desire, he should hit her with a stick or with his hand, and overcome her, saying: 'With power, with glory I take away your glory!' Thus she becomes inglorious.</p>  
<p>8. If she should yield to him, he says: 'With power, with glory I give you glory!' Thus they two become glorious.</p>  
<p>9. The woman whom one may desire with the thought, 'May she enjoy love with me!'--after inserting the member in her, joining mouth with mouth, and stroking her lap, he should mutter:--</p>  
<p>'Thou that from every limb art come,<br> That from the heart art generate,<br> Thou art the essence of the limbs!<br> Distract this woman here in me,<br> As if by poisoned arrow pierced!'</p>  
<p>10. Now, the woman whom one may desire with the thought, 'May she not conceive offspring!'--after inserting the member in her and joining mouth with mouth, he should first inhale, then exhale, and say: 'With power, with semen, I reclaim the semen from you!' Thus she comes to be without seed.</p>  
<p>12. Now, the woman whom one may desire with the thought, 'May she conceive!'--after inserting the member in her and joining mouth with mouth, he should first exhale, then inhale, and say: 'With power, with semen, I deposit semen in you!' Thus she becomes pregnant.</p>  
<p>12. Now, if one's wife have a paramour, and he hate him, let him put fire in an unannealed vessel, spread out a row of reed arrows in inverse order, and therein sacrifice in inverse</p>  
<p><a name="page_170hume"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170hume</font></A></p>  
<p>order those reed arrows, their heads smeared with ghee, saying:--</p>  
<p>'You have made a libation in my fire! I take away your in-breath and out-breath (<i>pr&acirc;&#7749;&acirc;p&acirc;nau</i>)--you, so-and-so!</p>  
<p>You have made a libation in my fire! I take away your sons and cattle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--you, so-and-so!</p>  
<p>You have made a libation in my fire! I take away your sacrifices and meritorious deeds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--you, so-and-so!</p>  
<p>You have made a libation in my fire! I take away your hope and expectation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_678"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--you, so-and-so!'</p>  
<p>Verily, he whom a Brahman who knows this curses--he departs from this world impotent and devoid of merit. Therefore one should not desire dalliance with the spouse of a person learned in sacred lore (<i>s'rotriya</i>) who knows this, for indeed he who knows this becomes superior.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_679"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. Now, when the monthly sickness comes upon anyone's wife, for three days she should not drink from a metal cup, nor put on fresh clothes. Neither a low-caste man nor a low-caste woman should touch her. At the end of the three nights she should bathe and should have rice threshed.</p>  
<p>14. In case one wishes, 'That a white son be born to me! that he be able to repeat a Veda! that he attain the full length of life!'--they two should have rice cooked with milk and should eat it prepared with ghee. They two are likely to beget [him].</p>  
<p>15. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a tawny son with reddish-brown eyes be born to me! that he be able to recite two Vedas! that he attain the full length of life!'--they two should have rice cooked with sour milk and should eat it prepared with ghee. They two are likely to beget [him].</p>  
<p>16. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a swarthy son with red eyes be born to me! that he be able to repeat three Vedas! that he attain the full length of life!'--they two should have rice boiled with water and should eat it prepared with ghee. They two are likely to beget [him].</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_171hume"><font size="1" color="green">p. 171hume</font></A></p>  
<p>17. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a learned (<i>pa<u>nd</u>ita</i>) daughter be born to me! that she attain the full length of life!'--they two should have rice boiled with sesame and should eat it prepared with ghee. They two are likely to beget [her].</p>  
<p>A. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a son, learned, famed, a frequenter of council-assemblies, a speaker of discourse desired to be heard, be born to me! that he be able to repeat all the Vedas! that he attain the full length of life!'--they two should have rice boiled with meat and should eat it prepared with ghee. They two are likely to beget [him], with meat, either veal or beef.</p>  
<p>19. Now, toward morning, having prepared melted butter in the manner of the Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_680"></A><A HREF="#fn_678"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he takes of the Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka and makes a libation, saying: 'To Agni, hail! To Anumati,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_681"></A><A HREF="#fn_679"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> hail! To the god Savit<I>ri</I> ('Enlivener,' the Sun), whose is true procreation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_682"></A><A HREF="#fn_680"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (<i>satya-prasava</i>), hail!' Having made the libation, he takes and eats, Having eaten, he offers to the other [i.e. to her]. Having washed his hands, he fills a vessel with water and therewith sprinkles her thrice, saying:--</p>  
<p>'Arise from hence, Vis'vavasu!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_683"></A><A HREF="#fn_681"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><br> Some other choicer maiden seek!<br> This wife together with her lord ----'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_684"></A><A HREF="#fn_682"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>20. Then he comes to her and says:--</p>  
<p>'This man (<i>ama</i>) am I; that woman (<i>s&acirc;</i>), thou!<br> That woman, thou; this man am I!<br> I am the S&acirc;man; thou, the Rig!<br> I am the heaven; thou, the earth!</p>  
<p>Come, let us two together clasp!<br> Together let us semen mix,<br> A male, a son for to procure!'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_172hume"><font size="1" color="green">p. 172hume</font></A></p>  
<p>21. Then he spreads apart her thighs, saying: 'Spread yourselves apart, heaven and earth!' Inserting the member in her and joining mouth with mouth, he strokes her three times as the hair lies, saying:--</p>  
<p>'Let Vish&#7749;u make the womb prepared!<br> Let Tyash<u>tr</u>i shape the various forms!<br> Praj&acirc;pati--let him pour in!<br> Let Dh&acirc;t<u>r</u>i place the germ for thee!</p>  
<p>O Sin&icirc;v&acirc;l&icirc;, give the germ;<br> O give the germ, thou broad-tressed dame!<br> Let the Twin Gods implace thy germ--<br> The Asvins, crowned with lotus-wreaths!</p>  
<p>22. With twain attrition-sticks of gold<br> The As'vin Twins twirl forth a flame;<br> 'Tis such a germ we beg for thee,<br> In the tenth month to be brought forth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_685"></A><A HREF="#fn_683"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>As earth contains the germ of Fire (<i>agni</i>),<br> As heaven is pregnant with the Storm (<i>indra</i>),<br> As of the points the Wind (<i>v&acirc;yu</i>) is germ,<br> E'en so a germ I place in thee,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So-and-so!'</p>  
<p>23. When she is about to bring forth, he sprinkles her with water, saying.--</p>  
<p>Like as the wind doth agitate<br> A lotus-pond on every side,<br> So also let thy fetus stir.<br> Let it come with its chorion.</p>  
<p>This fold of Indra's has been made<br> With barricade enclosed around.<br> O Indra, cause him to come forth--<br> The after-birth along with babe!'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_686"></A><A HREF="#fn_684"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>24. When [the son] is born, he [i. e. the father] builds up a fire, places him on his lap, mingles ghee and coagulated milk in a metal dish, and makes an oblation, ladling out of the mingled ghee and coagulated milk, and saying-</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_173hume"><font size="1" color="green">p. 173hume</font></A></p>  
<p>'In this son may I be increased,<br> And have a thousand in mine house!<br> May nothing rob his retinue<br> Of offspring or of animals!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail!</p>  
<p>The vital powers (pr&acirc;<i><u>n</u></i>a) which are in me, my mind, I offer in you.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail!<br> What in this rite I overdid,<br> Or what I have here scanty made--<br> Let Agni, wise, the Prosperer,<br> Make fit and good our sacrifice!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail!'</p>  
<p>25. Then he draws down to the child's right ear and says 'Speech! Speech!' three times. Then he mingles coagulated milk, honey, and ghee and feeds [his son] out of a gold [spoon] which is not placed within [the mouth],&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> saying: 'I place in you <i>Bh&ucirc;r</i>! I place in you <i>Bhuvas</i>! I place in you <i>Svar</i>! <i>Bh&ucirc;r</i>, <i>Bhuvas</i>, <i>Svar</i>---everything&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I place in you!'</p>  
<p>26. Then he gives him a name, saying: 'You are Veda.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> So this becomes his secret name.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_690"></A><A HREF="#fn_688"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>27. Then he presents him to the mother and offers the breast, saying:--</p>  
<p>'Thy breast which is unfailing and refreshing,<br> Wealth-bearer, treasure-finder, rich bestower,<br> With which thou nourishest all things esteem&eacute;d--<br> Give it here, O Sarasvat&icirc;, to suck from.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_691"></A><A HREF="#fn_689"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>'</p>  
<p>28. Then he addresses the child's mother:--</p>  
<p>'You are I<u>l</u>&acirc;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_692"></A><A HREF="#fn_690"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> of the lineage of Mitra and Varu&#7749;a!<br> O heroine! She has borne a hero!'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_693"></A><A HREF="#fn_691"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A><br> Continue to be such a woman abounding in heroes--<br> She who has made us abound in a hero!'</p>

<p>Of such a son, verily, they say: 'Ah, you have gone beyond your father! Ah, you have gone beyond your grandfather!'</p>  
<p>Ah, he reaches the highest pinnacle of splendor, glory, and sacred knowledge who is born as the son of a Brahman who knows this!</p>
