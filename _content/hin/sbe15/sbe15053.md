# B*RI*HADÂRA*N*YAKA-UPANISHAD.

## FIRST ADHYÂYA <span id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_246).

### FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. Verily <span id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_247) the dawn is the head of
the horse which is fit for sacrifice, the sun its eye, the wind its
breath, the mouth the Vai*s*vânara <span id="fr_248"></span>[3](#fn_248)
fire, the year the body of the sacrificial horse. Heaven is the back,
the sky the belly, the earth the chest <span
id="fr_249"></span>[4](#fn_249), the quarters the two sides, the
intermediate quarters the ribs, the members the seasons, the joints the
months and half-months, the feet days and nights, the bones the stars,
the

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

flesh the clouds. The half-digested food is the sand, the rivers the
bowels <span id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_250), the liver and the
lungs <span id="fr_251"></span>[2](#fn_251) the mountains, the hairs the
herbs and trees. As the sun rises, it is the forepart, as it sets, the
hindpart of the horse. When the horse shakes itself <span
id="fr_252"></span>[3](#fn_252), then it lightens; when it kicks, it
thunders; when it makes water, it rains; voice <span
id="fr_253"></span>[4](#fn_253) is its voice.

2\. Verily Day arose after the horse as the (golden) vessel <span
id="fr_254"></span>[5](#fn_254), called Mahiman (greatness), which (at
the sacrifice) is placed before the horse. Its place is in the Eastern
sea. The Night arose after the horse as the (silver) vessel, called
Mahiman, which (at the sacrifice) is placed behind the horse. Its place
is in the Western sea. Verily, these two vessels (or greatnesses) arose
to be on each side of the horse.

As a racer he carried the Devas, as a stallion the Gandharvas, as a
runner the Asuras, as a horse men. The sea is its kin, the sea is its
birthplace.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_246"></span>[73:1](sbe15053.htm#fr_246) It is the third
Adhyâya of the Âra*n*yaka, but the first of the Upanishad.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[73:2](sbe15053.htm#fr_247) This Brâhma*n*a is
found in the Mâdhyandina text of the *S*atapatha, ed. Weber, X, 6, 4.
Its object is there explained by the commentary to be the meditative
worship of Virâ*g*, as represented metaphorically in the members of the
horse. Sâya*n*a dispenses with its explanation, because, as part of the
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka-upanishad, according to the Kâ*n*va-*s*âkhâ, it had
been enlarged on by the Vârttikakâra and explained.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[73:3](sbe15053.htm#fr_248) Agni or fire, as
pervading everything, as universally present in nature.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[73:4](sbe15053.htm#fr_249) Pâ*g*asya is
doubtful. The commentator suggests pâd-asya, the place of the feet, i.e.
the hoof The Greek Pēgasos, or ἵπποι πηλοί, throws no light on the word.
The meaning of hoof would hardly be appropriate here, and I prefer chest
on account of uras in I, 2, 3. Deussen (Vedânta, p. 8) translates, die
Erde seiner Füsse Schemel; but we want some part of the horse.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[74:1](sbe15053.htm#fr_250) Guda, being in the
plural, is explained by nâ*d*î, channel, and sirâ*h*; for we ought to
read sirâ or hirâgraha*n*e for *s*irâ, p. 22, l. 16.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[74:2](sbe15053.htm#fr_251) Klomâna*h* is
explained as a plurale tantum (nityam bahuva*k*anam ekasmin), and being
described as a lump below the heart, on the opposite side of the liver,
it is supposed to be the lungs.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[74:3](sbe15053.htm#fr_252) 'When it yawns.'
Ânandagiri.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[74:4](sbe15053.htm#fr_253) Voice is sometimes
used as a personified power of thunder and other aerial sounds, and this
is identified with the voice of the horse.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[74:5](sbe15053.htm#fr_254) Two vessels, to
hold the sacrificial libations, are placed at the A*s*vamedha before and
behind the horse, the former made of gold, the latter made of silver.
They are called Mahiman in the technical language of the ceremonial. The
place in which these vessels are set, is called their yoni. Cf. Vâgas.
Sa*m*hitâ XXIII, 2.
