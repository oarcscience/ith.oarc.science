### ELEVENTH ANUVÂKA.

1\. After having taught the Veda, the teacher instructs the pupil: 'Say
what is true! Do thy duty! Do not neglect the study of the Veda! After
having brought to thy teacher his proper reward, do not cut off the line
of children! Do not swerve from the truth! Do not swerve from duty! Do
not neglect what is useful! Do not neglect greatness! Do not neglect the
learning and teaching of the Veda!

2\. 'Do not neglect the (sacrificial) works due to the Gods and Fathers!
Let thy mother be to thee like unto a god! Let thy father be to thee
like unto a god! Let thy teacher be to thee like unto a god! Let thy
guest be to thee like unto a god! Whatever actions are blameless, those
should be regarded, not others. Whatever good works have been performed
by us, those should be observed by thee,--

3\. 'Not others. And there are some Brâhma*n*as better than we. They
should be comforted by thee by giving them a seat. Whatever is given
should be given with faith, not without faith,--with joy, with modesty,
with fear, with kindness. If there should

be any doubt in thy mind with regard to any sacred act or with regard to
conduct,--

4\. 'In that case conduct thyself as Brâhma*n*as who possess good
judgment conduct themselves therein, whether they be appointed or
not <span id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_211), as long as they are not too
severe, but devoted to duty. And with regard to things that have been
spoken against, as Brâhma*n*as who possess good judgment conduct
themselves therein, whether they be appointed or not, as long as they
are not too severe, but devoted to duty,

(1-7) Thus conduct thyself 'This is the rule. This is the teaching. This
is the true purport (Upanishad) of the Veda. This is the command. Thus
should you observe. Thus should this be observed.'
