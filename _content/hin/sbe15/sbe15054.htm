<p>1. In the beginning there was nothing (to be perceived)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></A></p>  
<p>here whatsoever. By Death indeed all this was concealed,--by hunger; for death is hunger. Death (the first being) thought, 'Let me have a body.' Then he moved about, worshipping. From him thus worshipping water was produced. And he said: 'Verily, there appeared to me, while I worshipped (ar<I>k</I>ate), water (ka).' This is why water is called ar-ka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Surely there is water (or pleasure) for him who thus knows the reason why water is called arka.</p>  
<p>2. Verily water is arka. And what was there as the froth of the water, that was hardened, and became the earth. On that earth he (Death) rested, and from him, thus resting and heated, Agni (Vir&acirc;<I>g</I>) proceeded, full of light.</p>  
<p>3. That being divided itself threefold, &Acirc;ditya (the sun) as the third, and V&acirc;yu (the air) as the third&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. That spirit (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> became threefold. The head was the Eastern quarter, and the arms this and that quarter</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (i. e. the N. E. and S. E., on the left and right sides). Then the tail was the Western quarter, and the two legs this and that quarter (i. e. the N. W. and S. W.) The sides were the Southern and Northern quarters, the back heaven, the belly the sky, the dust the earth. Thus he (M<I>ri</I>tyu, as arka) stands firm in the water, and he who knows this stands firm wherever he goes.</p>  
<p>4. He desired&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, 'Let a second body be born of me,' and he (Death or Hunger) embraced Speech in his mind. Then the seed became the year. Before that time there was no year. Speech&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> bore him so long as a year, and after that time sent him forth. Then when he was born, he (Death) opened his mouth, as if to swallow him. He cried Bh&acirc;<I>n</I>! and that became speech&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>5. He thought, 'If I kill him, I shall have but little food.' He therefore brought forth by that speech and by that body (the year) all whatsoever exists, the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>, the Ya<I>g</I>us, the S&acirc;man, the metres, the sacrifices, men, and animals.</p>  
<p>And whatever he (Death) brought forth, that he resolved to eat (ad). Verily because he eats everything, therefore is Aditi (Death) called Aditi. He who thus knows why Aditi is called Aditi, becomes an eater of everything, and everything becomes his food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></A></p>  
<p>6. He desired to sacrifice again with a greater sacrifice. He toiled and performed penance. And while he toiled and performed penance, glorious power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> went out of him. Verily glorious power means the senses (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a). Then when the senses had gone out, the body took to swelling (<I>s</I>va-yitum), and mind was in the body.</p>  
<p>7. He desired that this body should be fit for sacrifice (medhya), and that he should be embodied by it. Then he became a horse (a<I>s</I>va), because it swelled (a<I>s</I>vat), and was fit for sacrifice (medhya); and this is why the horse-sacrifice is called A<I>s</I>va-medha.</p>  
<p>Verily he who knows him thus, knows the A<I>s</I>vamedha. Then, letting the horse free, he thought&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and at the end of a year he offered it up for himself, while he gave up the (other) animals to the deities. Therefore the sacrificers offered up the purified horse belonging to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, (as dedicated) to all the deities.</p>  
<p>Verily the shining sun is the A<I>s</I>vamedha-sacrifice, and his body is the year; Agni is the sacrificial fire (arka), and these worlds are his bodies. These two are the sacrificial fire and the A<I>s</I>vamedha-sacrifice, and they are again one deity, viz. Death. He (who knows this) overcomes another death, death does not reach him, death is his Self, he becomes one of those deities.</p>  
<p>

<p>1. There were two kinds of descendants of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the Devas and the Asuras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Now the Devas were indeed the younger, the Asuras the elder ones&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. The Devas, who were struggling in these worlds, said: 'Well, let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifices (the <I>G</I>yotish<I>t</I>oma) by means of the udg&icirc;tha.'</p>  
<p>2. They said to speech (V&acirc;<I>k</I>): 'Do thou sing out for us (the udg&icirc;tha).' 'Yes,' said speech, and sang (the udg&icirc;tha). Whatever delight there is in speech, that she obtained for the Devas by singing (the three pavam&acirc;nas); but that she pronounced well (in the other nine pavam&acirc;nas), that was for herself. The Asuras knew: 'Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at the singer and pierced her with evil. That evil which consists in saying what is bad, that is that evil.</p>  
<p>3. Then they (the Devas) said to breath (scent): 'Do thou sing out for us.' 'Yes,' said breath, and sang. Whatever delight there is in breath (smell), that he obtained for the Devas by singing; but that he smelled well, that was for himself. The Asuras knew: 'Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at the singer, and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></A></p>  
<p>pierced him with evil. That evil which consists in smelling what is bad, that is that evil.</p>  
<p>4. Then they said to the eye: 'Do thou sing out for us.' 'Yes,' said the eye, and sang. Whatever delight there is in the eye, that he obtained for the Devas by singing; but that he saw well, that was for himself The Asuras knew: 'Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at the singer, and pierced him with evil. That evil which consists in seeing what is bad, that is that evil.</p>  
<p>5. Then they said to the ear: 'Do thou sing out for us.' 'Yes,' said the ear, and sang. Whatever delight there is in the ear, that he obtained for the Devas by singing; but that he heard well, that was for himself. The Asuras knew: 'Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at the singer, and pierced him with evil. That evil which consists in hearing what is bad, that is that evil.</p>  
<p>6. Then they said to the mind: 'Do thou sing out for us.' 'Yes,' said the mind, and sang. Whatever delight there is in the mind, that he obtained for the Devas by singing; but that he thought well, that was for himself. The Asuras knew: 'Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at the singer, and pierced him with evil. That evil which consists in thinking what is bad, that is that evil.</p>  
<p>Thus they overwhelmed these deities with evils, thus they pierced them with evil.</p>  
<p>7. Then they said to the breath in the mouth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: 'Do thou sing for us.' 'Yes,' said the breath, and sang. The Asuras knew: 'Verily, through this singer</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></A></p>  
<p>they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at him and pierced him with evil. Now as a ball of earth will be scattered when hitting a stone, thus they perished, scattered in all directions. Hence the Devas rose, the Asuras fell. He who knows this, rises by his self, and the enemy who hates him falls.</p>  
<p>8. Then they (the Devas) said: 'Where was he then who thus stuck to us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?' It was (the breath) within the mouth (&acirc;sye 'ntar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>), and therefore called Ay&acirc;sya; he was the sap (rasa) of the limbs (a&#7749;ga), and therefore called &Acirc;&#7749;girasa.</p>  
<p>9. That deity was called D&ucirc;r, because Death was far (d&ucirc;ran) from it. From him who knows this, Death is far off.</p>  
<p>10. That deity, after having taken away the evil of those deities, viz. death, sent it to where the end of the quarters of the earth is. There he deposited their sins. Therefore let no one go to a man, let no one go to the end (of the quarters of the earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>), that he may not meet there with evil, with death.</p>  
<p>11. That deity, after having taken away the evil of those deities, viz. death, carried them beyond death.</p>  
<p>12. He carried speech across first. When speech had become freed from death, it became (what it had been before) Agni (fire). That Agni, after having stepped beyond death, shines.</p>  
<p>13. Then he carried breath (scent) across. When breath had become freed from death, it became</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> V&acirc;yu (air). That V&acirc;yu, after having stepped beyond death, blows.</p>  
<p>14. Then he carried the eye across. When the eye had become freed from death, it became &Acirc;ditya (the sun). That &Acirc;ditya, after having stepped beyond death, burns.</p>  
<p>15. Then he carried the ear across. When the ear had become freed from death, it became the quarters (space). These are our quarters (space), which have stepped beyond death.</p>  
<p>16. Then he carried the mind across. When the mind had become freed from death, it became the moon (<I>K</I>andramas). That moon, after having stepped beyond death, shines. Thus does that deity carry him, who knows this, across death.</p>  
<p>17. Then breath (vital), by singing, obtained for himself eatable food. For whatever food is eaten, is eaten by breath alone, and in it breath rests&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The Devas said: 'Verily, thus far, whatever food there is, thou hast by singing acquired it for thyself. Now therefore give us a share in that food.' He said: 'You there, enter into me.' They said Yes, and entered all into him. Therefore whatever food is eaten by breath, by it the other senses are satisfied.</p>  
<p>18. If a man knows this, then his own relations come to him in the same manner; he becomes their supporter, their chief leader, their strong ruler&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And if ever anyone tries to oppose&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> one who is possessed of such knowledge among his own relatives, then he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></A></p>  
<p>will not be able to support his own belongings. But he who follows the man who is possessed of such knowledge, and who with his permission wishes to support those whom he has to support, he indeed will be able to support his own belongings.</p>  
<p>19. He was called Ay&acirc;sya &Acirc;&#7749;girasa, for he is the sap (rasa) of the limbs (a&#7749;ga). Verily, breath is the sap of the limbs. Yes, breath is the sap of the limbs. Therefore from whatever limb breath goes away, that limb withers, for breath verily is the sap of the limbs.</p>  
<p>20. He (breath) is also B<I>ri</I>haspati, for speech is B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; (<I>Ri</I>g-veda), and he is her lord; therefore he is B<I>ri</I>haspati.</p>  
<p>2 1. He (breath) is also Brahma<I>n</I>aspati, for speech is Brahman (Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda), and he is her lord; therefore he is Brahma<I>n</I>aspati.</p>  
<p>He (breath) is also S&acirc;man (the Udg&icirc;tha), for speech is S&acirc;man (Sama-veda), and that is both speech (s&acirc;) and breath (ama)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. This is why S&acirc;man is called S&acirc;man.</p>  
<p>22. Or because he is equal (sama) to a grub, equal to a gnat, equal to an elephant, equal to these three worlds, nay, equal to this universe, therefore he is S&acirc;man. He who thus knows this S&acirc;man, obtains union and oneness with S&acirc;man.</p>  
<p>23. He (breath) is Udg&icirc;tha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Breath verily is Ut, for by breath this universe is upheld (uttabdha); and speech is G&icirc;th&acirc;, song. And because he is ut and g&icirc;th&acirc;, therefore he (breath) is Udg&icirc;tha.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></A></p>  
<p>24. And thus Brahmadatta <I>K</I>aikit&acirc;neya (the grandson of <I>K</I>ikit&acirc;na), while taking Soma (r&acirc;<I>g</I>an), said: 'May this Soma strike my head off, if Ay&acirc;sya &Acirc;&#7749;girasa sang another Udg&icirc;tha than this. He sang it indeed as speech and breath.'</p>  
<p>25. He who knows what is the property of this S&acirc;man, obtains property. Now verily its property is tone only. Therefore let a priest, who is going to perform the sacrificial work of a Sama-singer, desire that his voice may have a good tone, and let him perform the sacrifice with a voice that is in good tone. Therefore people (who want a priest) for a sacrifice, look out for one who possesses a good voice, as for one who possesses property. He who thus knows what is the property of that S&acirc;man, obtains property.</p>  
<p>26. He who knows what is the gold of that S&acirc;man, obtains gold. Now verily its gold. is tone only. He who thus knows what is the gold of that S&acirc;man, obtains gold.</p>  
<p>27. He who knows what is the support of that S&acirc;man, he is supported. Now verily its support is speech only. For, as supported in speech, that breath is sung as that S&acirc;man. Some say the support is in food.</p>  
<p>Next follows the Abhy&acirc;roha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (the ascension) of the Pavam&acirc;na verses. Verily the Prastot<I>ri</I> begins to sing the S&acirc;man, and when he begins, then let him (the sacrificer) recite these (three Ya<I>g</I>us-verses):</p>  
<p>'Lead me from the unreal to the real! Lead me</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></A></p>  
<p>from darkness to light! Lead me from death to immortality!'</p>  
<p>Now when he says, 'Lead me from the unreal to the real,' the unreal is verily death, the real immortality. He therefore says, 'Lead me from death to immortality, make me immortal.'</p>  
<p>When he says, 'Lead me from darkness to light,' darkness is verily death, light immortality. He therefore says, 'Lead me from death to immortality, make me immortal.'</p>  
<p>When he says, 'Lead me from death to immortality,' there is nothing there, as it were, hidden (obscure, requiring explanation)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>28. Next come the other Stotras with which the priest may obtain food for himself by singing them. Therefore let the sacrificer, while these Stotras are being sung, ask for a boon, whatever desire he may desire. An Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> priest who knows this obtains by his singing whatever desire he may desire either for himself or for the sacrificer. This (knowledge) indeed is called the conqueror of the worlds. He who thus knows this S&acirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for him there is no fear of his not being admitted to the worlds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_255"></A><A HREF="sbe15054.htm#fr_255">74:6</A> Called the Agni-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and intended to teach the origin of <a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></A> Agni, the fire, which is here used for the Horse-sacrifice. It is found in the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, M&acirc;dhyandina-<I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; X, 6, 5, and there explained as a description of Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha.</P>

The commentator takes arka in the sense of fire, more especially the sacrificial fire employed at the Horse-sacrifice. It may be so, but the more natural interpretation seems to me to take arka here as water, from which indirectly fire is produced. From water springs the earth; on that earth he (Mri<I>t</I>yu or Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) rested, and from him, while resting there, fire (Vir&acirc;<I>g</I>) was produced. That fire assumed three forms, fire, sun, and air, and in that threefold form it is called pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, spirit.</P>
