Textual Heritage

### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. This (heart) indeed is even that, it was indeed the true <span
id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_554) (Brahman). And whosoever knows this
great glorious first-born as the true Brahman, he conquers these worlds,
and conquered likewise may that (enemy) be <span
id="fr_555"></span>[3](#fn_555)! yes, whosoever knows this great

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

glorious first-born as the true Brahman; for Brahman is the true.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_554"></span>[190:2](sbe15082.htm#fr_554) The true, not the
truth; the truly existing. The commentator explains it as it was
explained in II, 3, 1, as sat and tya, containing both sides of the
Brahman.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[190:3](sbe15082.htm#fr_555) An elliptical
expression, as explained by the commentator: May that one (his enemy) be
conquered, just as that one was <span id="page_191">p. 191</span>
conquered by Brahman. If he conquers the world, how much more his enemy
1' It would be better, however, if we could take *g*ita in the sense of
va*s*îk*ri*ta or dânta, because we could then go on with ya eva*m* veda.
