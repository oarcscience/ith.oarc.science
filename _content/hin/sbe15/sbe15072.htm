<P><A NAME="fn_422"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_422">139:2</A> This disputation between Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya and Vidagdha <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya occurs in a simpler form in the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, XI, p. 873. He is here represented as the first who defies Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, and whom Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya asks at once, whether the other Br&acirc;hmans had made him the ulmuk&acirc;vakshaya<I>n</I>a, the cat's paw, literally one who has to take a burning piece of wood out of the fire (ardha. dagdhak&acirc;sh<I>th</I>am ulmukam; tasya vahirnirasanam avakshaya<I>n</I>a<I>m</I> vin&acirc;<I>s</I>a<I>h</I>). The end, however, is different, for on asking the nature of the one god, the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, he is told by Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya that he has asked for what he ought not to ask, and that therefore he will die and thieves will carry away his bones.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_427"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_427">140:3</A> The etymological explanation of Vasu is not quite clear, and <a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></A> the commentator hardly explains our text. Perhaps vasu is meant for the world or the dwellers therein. The more usual explanation occurs in the <I>S</I>atap.

<P><A NAME="fn_431"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_431">142:1</A> I prefer to attribute this to <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya, who is still the questioner, and not Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya; but I am not quite satisfied that I am right in this, or in the subsequent distribution of the parts, assigned to each speaker. If <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya is the questioner, then the sentence, veda v&acirc; aha<I>m</I> tam purusha<I>m</I> sarvasy&acirc;tmana<I>h</I> par&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a<I>m</I> yam &acirc;ttha, must belong to Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, because he refers to the words of another speaker. Lastly, the sentence vadaiva has to be taken as addressed to <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya. The commentator remarks that, he being the questioner, one expects pri<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a instead of vada. But Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya may also be supposed to turn round on <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya and ask him a question in turn, more difficult than the question addressed by <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya to Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, and in that case the last sentence must be taken as an answer, though an imperfect one, of <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya's. The commentator seems to think that after Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya told <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya to ask this question, <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya was frightened and asked it, and that then Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya answered in turn.</P>

I should prefer to take a&#7749;g&acirc;r&acirc;vakshaya<I>n</I>a in the sense of ulmuk&acirc;vakshaya<I>n</I>a, an instrument with which one takes burning coals from the fire to extinguish them, a pair of tongs. Read sanda<I>m</I>sa instead of sandesa. Kshi with ava means to remove, to take away. We should call an a&#7749;g&acirc;r&acirc;vakshaya<I>n</I>a a cat's paw.

<P><A NAME="fn_443"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_443">146:2</A> In the text, published by Dr. Roer in the Bibliotheca Indica, a sentence is left out, viz. h<I>ri</I>daya ity uv&acirc;<I>k</I>a, h<I>ri</I>dayena hi r&ucirc;p&acirc;<I>n</I>i <I>g</I>&acirc;n&acirc;ti, h<I>ri</I>daye hy eva r&ucirc;p&acirc;<I>n</I>i pratish<I>th</I>it&acirc;ni bhavant&icirc;ty.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_444"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_444">147:1</A> D&icirc;ksh&acirc; is the initiatory rite for the Soma sacrifice. Having sacrificed with Soma which has to be bought, the sacrificer becomes endowed with wisdom, and wanders to the North, which is the quarter of Soma.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_449"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_449">148:5</A> The Sam&acirc;na can hardly be meant here for one of the five pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as, generally mentioned before the ud&acirc;na, but, as explained by Dvivedaga&#7749;ga, stands for the S&ucirc;tr&acirc;tman. This S&ucirc;tr&acirc;tman abides in the Antary&acirc;min, and this in the Brahman (K&ucirc;<I>t</I>astha), which is <a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></A> therefore described next. Could Sam&acirc;na be here the same as in IV, 3, 7?</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_453"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_453">150:2</A> <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara seems to have read sn&acirc;vavat, instead of sn&acirc;va, tat sthiram, as we read in both <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_454"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_454">150:3</A> Here the M&acirc;dhyandinas (p. 1080) add, <I>g</I>&acirc;ta eva na <I>g</I>&acirc;yate, ko nv ena<I>m</I> <I>g</I>anayet puna<I>h</I>, which the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas place later.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_455"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_455">150:4</A> Instead of a<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>as&acirc;, the M&acirc;dhyandinas have anyata<I>h</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_456"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_456">150:5</A> The M&acirc;dhyandinas have dh&acirc;n&acirc;ruha u vai, which is better than iva vai, the iva being, according to <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara's own confession, useless. The thread of the argument does not seem to have been clearly perceived by the commentators. What the poet wants to say is, that a man, struck down by death, does not come to life again from seed, because human seed comes from the living only, while trees, springing from grain, are seen to come to life after the tree (which yielded the grain or the seed) is dead. Pretya-sambhava like pretya-bh&acirc;va, means life after death, and pretyasambhava, as an adjective, means coming to life after death.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_457"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_457">150:6</A> This line too is taken in a different sense by the commentator. According to him, it would mean: 'If you say, He has been born <a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></A> (and there is an end of all questioning), I say, No; he is born again, and the question is, How?' This is much too artificial. The order of the verses in the M&acirc;dhyandina-<I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; is better on the whole, leading up more naturally to the question, 'From what root then does a mortal grow up, after he has been felled by death?' When the Br&acirc;hmans cannot answer, Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya answers, or the <I>S</I>ruti declares, that the root from whence a mortal springs again, after death, is Brahman.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_458"></A><A HREF="sbe15072.htm#fr_458">151:1</A> <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara explains r&acirc;tir d&acirc;tu<I>h</I> as r&acirc;ter d&acirc;tu<I>h</I>, a reading adopted by the M&acirc;dhyandinas. He then arrives at the statement that Brahman is the principle or the last source, also the root of a new life, both for those who practise works and for those who, having relinquished works, stand firm in knowledge. Regnaud (II, p. 138) translates: 'C'est Brahma (qui est) l'intelligence, le bonheur, la richesse, le but supr&ecirc;me de celui qui offre (des sacrifices), et de celui qui r&eacute;side (en lui), de celui qui conna&icirc;t.'</P>
