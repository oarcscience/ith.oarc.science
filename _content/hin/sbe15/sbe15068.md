*The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_403).

1\. Then Kahola Kaushîtakeya asked. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya, 'he said, 'tell me
the Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the Self (Âtman), who is
within all.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'This, thy Self, who is within all.'

'Which Self, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, is within all?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'He who overcomes hunger and thirst, sorrow,
passion, old age, and death. When Brâhma*n*as know that Self, and have
risen above the desire for sons <span id="fr_404"></span>[2](#fn_404),
wealth, and (new) worlds <span id="fr_405"></span>[3](#fn_405), they
wander about as mendicants. For a desire for sons is desire for wealth,
a desire for wealth is desire for worlds. Both these are indeed desires.
Therefore let a Brâhma*n*a, after he has done with learning,

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

wish to stand by real strength <span id="fr_406"></span>[1](#fn_406);
after he has done with that strength and learning, he becomes a Muni (a
Yogin); and after he has done with what is not the knowledge of a Muni,
and with what is the knowledge of a Muni, he is a Brâhma*n*a. By
whatever means he has become a Brâhma*n*a, he is such indeed <span
id="fr_407"></span>[2](#fn_407). Everything else is of evil.' After that
Kahola Kaushîtakeya held his peace.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_403"></span>[129:1](sbe15068.htm#fr_403) Mâdhyandina text,
p. 1071, standing before the fourth Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[129:2](sbe15068.htm#fr_404) See B*ri*h. Âr.
Up. IV, 4, 22.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[129:3](sbe15068.htm#fr_405) Life in the world
of the Fathers, or in the world of the Gods.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[130:1](sbe15068.htm#fr_406) Knowledge of the
Self, which enables us to dispense with all other knowledge.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[130:2](sbe15068.htm#fr_407) Mr. Gough proposes
as an alternative rendering: 'Let a Brâhma*n*a renounce learning and
become as a child; and after renouncing learning and a childlike mind,
let him become a quietist; and when he has made an end of quietism and
non-quietism, he shall become a Brâhma*n*a, a Brâhma*n*a indeed.'
Deussen takes a similar view, but I doubt whether 'the knowledge of
babes' is not a Christian rather than an Indian idea, in spite of
*S*aṅkara's remarks on Ved. Sûtra, III, 4, 50, which are strangely at
variance with his commentary here. Possibly the text may be corrupt, for
tish*th*âset too is a very peculiar form. We might conjecture balyena,
as we have abalyam, in IV, 4, 1. In Kaush. Up. III, 3, âbâlyam stands
for âbălyam, possibly for ăbălyam. The construction of kena syâd yena
syât tened*ris*a eva, however, is well known.
