### THIRTEENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. Next follows the Uktha <span id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_570).
Verily, breath (prâ*n*a) is Uktha, for breath raises up (utthâpayati)
all this. From him who knows this, there is raised a wise son, knowing
the Uktha; he obtains union and oneness with the Uktha.

2\. Next follows the Ya*g*us. Verily, breath is Ya*g*us, for all these
beings are joined in breath <span id="fr_571"></span>[2](#fn_571). For
him who knows this, all beings are joined to procure his excellence; he
obtains union and oneness with the Ya*g*us.

3\. Next follows the Sâman. Verily, breath is the Sâman, for all these
beings meet in breath. For him who knows this, all beings meet to
procure his excellence; he obtains union and oneness with the Sâman.

4\. Next follows the Kshatra. Verily, breath is the Kshatra, for breath
is Kshatra, i.e. breath protects (trâyate) him from being hurt
(ksha*n*ito*h*). He who knows this, obtains Kshatra (power), which
requires no protection; he obtains union and oneness with Kshatra <span
id="fr_572"></span>[3](#fn_572).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_570"></span>[195:1](sbe15091.htm#fr_570) Meditation on the
hymn called uktha. On the uktha, as the principal part in the Mahâvrata,
see Kaush. Up. III, 3; Ait. Âr. II, 1, 2. The uktha, yagus, sâman, &c.
are here represented as forms under which prâ*n*a or life, and
indirectly Brahman, is to be meditated on.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[195:2](sbe15091.htm#fr_571) Without life or
breath nothing can join anything else; therefore life is called ya*g*us,
as it were yu*g*us.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[195:3](sbe15091.htm#fr_572) Instead of
Kshatram atram, another *S*âkhâ, i.e. the Mâdhyandina, reads
Kshatramâtram, which Dvivedagaṅga explains as, he <span id="page_196">p.
196</span> obtains the nature of the Kshatra, or he obtains the Kshatra
which protects (Kshatram âtram).
