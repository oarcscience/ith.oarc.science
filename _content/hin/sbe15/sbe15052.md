*The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TENTH ANUVÂKA.

1\. Let him never turn away (a stranger) from his house, that is the
rule. Therefore a man should by all means acquire much food, for (good)
people say (to the stranger): 'There is food ready for him.' If he gives
food amply, food is given to him amply. If he gives food fairly, food is
given to him fairly. If he gives food meanly, food is given to him
meanly.

2\. He who knows this, (recognises and worships Brahman <span
id="fr_241"></span>[2](#fn_241)) as possession in speech, as acquisition
and possession in up-breathing (prâ*n*a) and down-breathing (apâna); as
action in the hands; as walking in the feet; as voiding in the anus.
These are the human recognitions (of Brahman as manifested in human
actions). Next follow the recognitions (of

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahman) with
reference to the Devas, viz. as satisfaction in rain; as power in
lightning;

3\. As glory in cattle; as light in the stars; as procreation,
immortality, and bliss in the member; as everything in the ether. Let
him worship that (Brahman) as support, and he becomes supported. Let him
worship that (Brahman) as greatness (maha*h*), and he becomes great. Let
him worship that (Brahman) as mind, and he becomes endowed with mind.

4\. Let him worship that (Brahman) as adoration, and all desires fall
down before him in adoration. Let him worship that (Brahman) as Brahman,
and he will become possessed of Brahman. Let him worship this as the
absorption of the gods <span id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_242) in Brahman,
and the enemies who hate him will die all around him, all around him
will die the foes whom he does not love.

He <span id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_243) who is this (Brahman) in man,
and he who is that (Brahman) in the sun, both are one.

5\. He who knows this, when he has departed this world, after reaching
and comprehending the Self which consists of food, the Self which
consists of breath, the Self which consists of mind, the Self which
consists of understanding, the Self which consists of bliss, enters and
takes possession of these worlds, and having as much food as he likes,
and assuming as many forms as he likes, he sits down singing this Sâman
(of Brahman): 'Hâvu, hâvu, hâvu!

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

6\. 'I am food (object), I am food, I am food! I am the eater of food
(subject), I am the eater of food, I am the eater of food! I am the poet
(who joins the two together), I am the poet, I am the poet! I am the
first-born of the Right (*ri*ta). Before the Devas I was in the centre
of all that is immortal. He who gives me away, he alone preserves me:
him who eats food, I eat as food.

'I overcome the whole world, I, endowed with golden light <span
id="fr_244"></span>[1](#fn_244). He who knows this, (attains all this).'
This is the Upanishad <span id="fr_245"></span>[2](#fn_245).

<span id="fn_241"></span>[67:2](sbe15052.htm#fr_241) Brâhma*n*a
upâsanaprakâtra*h*.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[68:1](sbe15052.htm#fr_242) Cf. Kaush. Up. II,
12. Here the absorption of the gods of fire, sun, moon, and lightning in
the god of the air (vâyu) is described. *S*aṅkara adds the god of rain,
and shows that air is identical with ether.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[68:2](sbe15052.htm#fr_243) Cf. II, 8.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[69:1](sbe15052.htm#fr_244) If we read
suvar*n*a*g*yoti*h*. The commentator reads suvar *n*a *g*yoti*h*. i.e.
the light is like the sun.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[69:2](sbe15052.htm#fr_245) After the
Anukramanî follows the same invocation as in the beginning of the third
Vallî, 'May it protect us both,' &c.
