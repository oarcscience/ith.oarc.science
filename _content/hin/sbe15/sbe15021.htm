<p>1. He (the knower of the Self) knows that highest home of Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, in which all is contained and shines brightly. The wise who, without desiring happiness, worship that Person&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, transcend this seed, (they are not born again.)</p>  
<p>2. He who forms desires in his mind, is born again through his desires here and there. But to him whose desires are fulfilled and who is conscious of the true Self (within himself) all desires vanish, even here on earth.</p>  
<p>3. That Self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by understanding, nor by much learning. He whom the Self chooses, by him the Self can be gained. The Self chooses him (his body) as his own.</p>  
<p>4. Nor is that Self to be gained by one who is destitute of strength, or without earnestness, or without right meditation. But if a wise man strives after it by those means (by strength, earnestness, and right meditation), then his Self enters the home of Brahman.</p>  
<p>5. When they have reached him (the Self), the sages become satisfied through knowledge, they are conscious of their Self, their passions have passed</p>

<p>away, and they are tranquil. The wise, having reached Him who is omnipresent everywhere, devoted to the Self, enter into him wholly.</p>  
<p>6. Having well ascertained the object of the knowledge of the Ved&acirc;nta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and having purified their nature by the Yoga&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of renunciation, all anchorites, enjoying the highest immortality, become free at the time of the great end (death) in the worlds of Brahm&acirc;.</p>  
<p>7. Their fifteen parts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> enter into their elements, their Devas (the senses) into their (corresponding) Devas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Their deeds and their Self with all his knowledge become all one in the highest Imperishable.</p>  
<p>8. As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, losing their name and their form, thus a wise man, freed from name and form, goes to the divine Person, who is greater than the great&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>9. He who knows that highest Brahman, becomes even Brahman. In his race no one is born ignorant of Brahman. He overcomes grief, he overcomes evil; free from the fetters of the heart, he becomes immortal.</p>  
<p>10. And this is declared by the following <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>-verse: 'Let a man tell this science of Brahman to those only who have performed all (necessary) acts, who are versed in the Vedas, and firmly established in (the lower) Brahman, who themselves offer as</p>

<p>an oblation the one <I>Ri</I>shi (Agni), full of faith, and by whom the rite of (carrying fire on) the head has been performed, according to the rule (of the &Acirc;tharva<I>n</I>as).'</p>
