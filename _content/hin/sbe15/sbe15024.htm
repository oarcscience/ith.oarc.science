<p>1. May glory come to both of us (teacher and pupil) together! May Vedic light belong to both of us!</p>  
<p>Now let us explain the Upanishad (the secret meaning) of the union (sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, under five heads, with regard to the worlds, the heavenly lights, knowledge, offspring, and self (body). People call these the great Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s.</p>  
<p>First, with regard to the worlds. The earth is the former element, heaven the latter, ether their union;</p>  
<p>2. That union takes place through V&acirc;yu (air). So much with regard to the worlds.</p>  
<p>Next, with regard to the heavenly lights. Agni (fire) is the former element, &Acirc;ditya (the sun) the latter, water their union. That union takes place through lightning. So much with regard to the heavenly lights.</p>  
<p>Next, with regard to knowledge. The teacher is the former element,</p>  
<p>The pupil the latter, knowledge their union. That union takes place through the recitation of the Veda. So much with regard to knowledge.</p>  
<p>Next, with regard to offspring. The mother is</p>

<p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></A></p>  
<p>the former element, the father the latter, offspring their union. That union takes place through procreation. So much with regard to offspring.</p>  
<p>4. Next, with regard to the self (body). The lower jaw is the former element, the upper jaw the latter, speech their union. That union takes place through speech. So much with regard to the Self. These are the great Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s. He who knows these Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s (unions), as here explained, becomes united with offspring, cattle, Vedic light, food, and with the heavenly world.</p>
