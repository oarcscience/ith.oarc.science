<p>1. Then Udd&acirc;laka &Acirc;runi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_411"></A><A HREF="#fn_411"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> asked. 'Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya,' he said, 'we dwelt among the Madras in the houses of Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ala K&acirc;pya, studying the sacrifice. His wife was possessed of a Gandharva, and we asked him: "Who art thou?" He answered: "I am Kabandha &Acirc;tharva<I>n</I>a." And he said to Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ala K&acirc;pya and to (us) students: "Dost thou know, K&acirc;pya, that thread by which this world and the other world, and all beings are strung together?" And Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ala K&acirc;pya replied: "I do not know it, Sir." He said again to Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ala K&acirc;pya and to (us) students: "Dost thou know, K&acirc;pya, that puller (ruler) within (antary&acirc;min), who within pulls (rules) this world and the other world and all beings?" And Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ala K&acirc;pya replied: "I do not know it, Sir." He said again to Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ala K&acirc;pya and to (us) students: "He, O K&acirc;pya, who knows that thread and him who pulls (it) within, he knows Brahman, he knows the worlds, he knows the Devas, he knows the Vedas, he knows the Bh&ucirc;tas (creatures), he knows the Self, he knows everything." Thus did he (the Gandharva) say to them, and I know it. If thou, O Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, without knowing that string and the puller within, drivest away those Brahma-cows (the cows offered as a prize to him who best knows Brahman), thy head will fall off.'</p>  
<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya said: 'O Gautama, I believe I know that thread and the puller within.'</p>

<p>The other said: 'Anybody may say, I know, I know. Tell what thou knowest.'</p>  
<p>2. Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya said: 'V&acirc;yu (air) is that thread, O Gautama. By air, as by a thread, O Gautama, this world and the other world, and all creatures are strung together. Therefore, O Gautama, people say of a dead person that his limbs have become unstrung; for by air, as by a thread, O Gautama, they were strung together.'</p>  
<p>The other said: 'So it is, O Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya. Tell now (who is) the puller within.'</p>  
<p>3. Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya said: 'He who dwells in the earth, and within the earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_412"></A><A HREF="#fn_412"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, whom the earth does not know, whose body the earth is, and who pulls (rules) the earth within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>

<p>12. 'He who dwells in the ether (&acirc;k&acirc;sa), and within the ether, whom the ether does not know, whose body the ether is, and who pulls (rules) the ether within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>

<p>14. 'He who dwells in the light (te<I>g</I>as), and within the light, whom the light does not know, whose</p>

<p>body the light is, and who pulls (rules) the light within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>  
<p>So far with respect to the gods (adhidaivatam); now with respect to beings (adhibh&ucirc;tam).</p>  
<p>15. Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya said: 'He who dwells in all beings, and within all beings, whom all beings do not know, whose body all beings are, and who pulls (rules) all beings within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'</p>

<p>23. 'He who dwells in the seed, and within the seed, whom the seed does not know, whose body the seed is, and who pulls (rules) the seed within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal; unseen, but seeing; unheard, but hearing; unperceived, but perceiving; unknown, but knowing. There is no other seer but he, there is no other hearer but he, there is no other perceiver but he, there is no other knower but he. This is thy Self, the ruler within, the immortal. Everything else is of evil.' After that Udd&acirc;laka &Acirc;runi held his peace.</p>
