Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SEVENTH ANUVÂKA.

Let him never abuse food, that is the rule.

Breath is food <span id="fr_238"></span>[2](sbe15050.htm#fn_238), the
body eats the food. The body rests on breath, breath rests on the body.
This is the food resting on food. He who knows this food resting on
food <span id="fr_239"></span>[3](sbe15050.htm#fn_239), rests exalted,
becomes rich in food, and able to cat food (healthy), becomes great by
offspring, cattle, and the splendour of his knowledge (of Brahman),
great by fame.
