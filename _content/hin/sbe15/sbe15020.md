## THIRD MU*ND*AKA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same tree. One of them
eats the sweet fruit, the other looks on without eating <span
id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_180).

2\. On the same tree man sits grieving, immersed, bewildered by his own
impotence (an-î*s*â). But when he sees the other lord (î*s*â) contented
and knows his glory, then his grief passes away <span
id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_181).

3\. When the seer sees the brilliant maker and lord (of the world) as
the Person who has his source in Brahman, then he is wise, and shaking
off good and evil, he reaches the highest oneness, free from passions;

4\. For he is the Breath shining forth in all beings, and he who
understands this becomes truly wise, not a talker only. He revels in the
Self, he delights in the Self, and having performed his works
(truthfulness, penance, meditation, &c.) he rests, firmly established in
Brahman, the best of those who know Brahman <span
id="fr_182"></span>[3](#fn_182).

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

5\. By truthfulness, indeed, by penance, right knowledge, and abstinence
must that Self be gained; the Self whom spotless anchorites gain is
pure, and like a light within the body.

6\. The true prevails, not the untrue; by the true the path is laid out,
the way of the gods (devayâna*h*), on which the old sages, satisfied in
their desires, proceed to where there is that highest place of the True
One.

7\. That (true Brahman) shines forth grand, divine., inconceivable,
smaller than small; it is far beyond what is far and yet near here, it
is hidden in the cave (of the heart) among those who see it even here.

8\. He is not apprehended by the eye, nor by speech, nor by the other
senses, not by penance or good works <span
id="fr_183"></span>[1](#fn_183). When a man's nature has become purified
by the serene light of knowledge, then he sees him, meditating on him as
without parts.

9\. That subtle Self is to be known by thought (*k*etas) there where
breath has entered fivefold, for every thought of men is interwoven with
the senses, and when thought is purified, then the Self arises.

10\. Whatever state a man, whose nature is purified imagines, and
whatever desires he desires (for himself or for others) <span
id="fr_184"></span>[2](#fn_184), that state he conquers and

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

those desires he obtains. Therefore let every man who desires happiness
worship the man who knows the Self <span
id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_185).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_180"></span>[38:1](sbe15020.htm#fr_180) Cf. Rv. I, 164, 20;
Nir. XIV, 30; *S*vet. Up. IV, 6; Ka*th*. Up. III, 1.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[38:2](sbe15020.htm#fr_181) Cf. *S*vet. Up. IV,
7.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[38:3](sbe15020.htm#fr_182) The commentator
states that, besides âtmarati*h* kriyâvân, there was another reading,
viz. âtmaratikriyâvân. This probably owed its origin to a difficulty
felt in reconciling kriyâvân, performing acts, with the brahmavidâ*m*
varish*th*a*h*, the best of those who know Brahman, works being utterly
incompatible with a true knowledge of Brahman. Kriyâvân, however, as
*S*aṅkara points out, may mean here simply, having performed meditation
and other acts conducive to a knowledge of Brahman. Probably
truthfulness, <span id="page_39">p. 39</span> penance, &c., mentioned in
the next following verse, are the kriyâs or works intended. For
grammatical reasons also this reading is preferable. But the last foot
esha brahmavidâ*m* varish*th*a*h* is clearly defective. If we examine
the commentary, we see that *S*aṅkara read brahmanish*th*a*h*, and that
he did not read esha, which would give us the correct metre,
brahmanish*th*o brahmavidâ*m* varish*th*a*h*.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[39:1](sbe15020.htm#fr_183) Cf. Ka*th*. Up. VI,
12.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[39:2](sbe15020.htm#fr_184) Cf. B*ri*h. Âr. I,
4, 15.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[40:1](sbe15020.htm#fr_185) All this is said by
the commentator to refer to a knowledge of the conditioned Brahman only.
