<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Footnotes</H3>
<P><A NAME="fn_728"></A><A HREF="sbe15101.htm#fr_730">238:1</A> The seven introductory verses are taken from hymns addressed to Savit<I>ri</I> as the rising sun. They have been so twisted by <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara, in order to make them applicable to the teachings of the Yoga philosophy, as to become almost nonsensical. I have given a few specimens of <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara's renderings in the notes, but have translated the verses, as much as possible, in their original character. As they are merely introductory, I do not understand why the collector of the Upanishad should have seen in them anything but an invocation of Savit<I>ri</I>.</p>  
<p>These verses are taken from various Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s. The first yu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&acirc;na<I>h</I> prathamam is from Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. IV, 1, 1, 1, 1; V&acirc;<I>g</I>. Sa<I>m</I>h. XI, 1; see also <I>S</I>at. Br. VI, 3, 1, 12. The Taittir&icirc;ya-text agrees with the Upanishad, the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyi-text has dhiyam for dhiya<I>h</I>, and agne<I>h</I> for agnim. Both texts take tatv&acirc;ya as a participle of tan, while the Upanishad reads tattv&acirc;ya, as a dative of tattva, truth. I have translated the verse in its natural sense. <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara, in explaining the Upanishad, translates: 'At the beginning of our meditation, joining the mind with the Highest Self, also the other pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as, or the knowledge of outward things, for the sake of truth, Savit<I>ri</I>, out of the knowledge of outward things, brought Agni, after having discovered his brightness, above the earth, in this body.' He explains it: 'May Savit<I>ri</I>, taking our thoughts away from outward things, in order to concentrate them on the Highest Self, produce in our speech and in our other senses that power which can lighten all objects, which proceeds from Agni and from the other favourable deities.' He adds that 'by the favour of Savit<I>ri</I>, Yoga may be obtained.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_729"></A><A HREF="sbe15101.htm#fr_731">238:2</A> The second verse is from Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. IV, 1, 1, 1, 3; V&acirc;<I>g</I>. Sa<I>m</I>h. XI, 2. The V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyi-text has svargy&acirc;ya for svargey&acirc;ya, and <I>s</I>akty&acirc; for <I>s</I>aktyai. <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara explains: 'With a mind that has been joined <a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="green">p. 239</font></A> by Savit<I>ri</I> to the Highest Self, we, with the sanction of that Savit<I>ri</I>, devote ourselves to the work of meditation, which leads to the obtainment of Svarga, according to our power.' He explains Svarga by Param&acirc;tman. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a in his commentary on the Taittir&icirc;ya-sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; explains svargey&acirc;ya by svargaloke g&icirc;yam&acirc;nasy&acirc;gne<I>h</I> samp&acirc;dan&acirc;ya; <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara, by svargapr&acirc;ptihetubh&ucirc;t&acirc;ya dhy&acirc;nakarma<I>n</I>e. <I>S</I>aktyai is explained by <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara by yath&acirc;s&acirc;marthyam; by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, by <I>s</I>akt&acirc; bh&ucirc;y&acirc;sma. Mah&icirc;dhara explains <I>s</I>akty&acirc; by svas&acirc;marthyena. I believe that the original reading was svargy&acirc;ya <I>s</I>aktyai, and that we must take <I>s</I>aktyai as an infinitive, like ityai, construed with a dative, like d<I>ri</I>saye s&ucirc;ry&acirc;ya, for the seeing of the sun. The two attracted datives would be governed by save, 'we are under the command of Savit<I>ri</I>,' svargy&acirc;ya <I>s</I>aktyai, 'that we may obtain svargya, life in Svarga or blessedness.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_730"></A><A HREF="sbe15101.htm#fr_732">239:1</A> The third verse is from Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. IV, 1, 1, 1, 2; V&acirc;<I>g</I>. Sa<I>m</I>h. XI, 3. The Taittir&icirc;yas read yuktv&acirc;ya manas&acirc;; the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyins, yuktv&acirc;ya savit&acirc;. <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara translates: 'Again he prays that Savit<I>ri</I>, having directed the devas, i.e. the senses, which are moving towards Brahman, and which by knowledge are going to brighten up the heavenly light of Brahman, may order them to do so; that is, he prays that, by the favour of Savit<I>ri</I>, our senses should be turned away from outward things to Brahman or the Self.' Taking the hymn as addressed to Savit<I>ri</I>, I have translated deva by gods, not by senses, suvaryata<I>h</I> by rising to the sky, namely, in the morning. The opposition between manas&acirc; and dhiy&acirc; is the same here as in verse 1, and again in verse 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_731"></A><A HREF="sbe15101.htm#fr_733">239:2</A> This verse is from Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. IV, 1, 1, 1, 4; I, 2, 13, 1, 1; V&acirc;<I>g</I>. Sa<I>m</I>h. V, 14; XI, 4; XXXVII, 2; <I>Ri</I>g-veda V, 81, 1; <I>S</I>at. Br. III, 5, 3, 11; VI, 3, 1, 16. <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara explains this verse again in the same manner as he did the former verses, while the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a supplies two different ritual explanations.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_732"></A><A HREF="sbe15101.htm#fr_734">240:1</A> For this verse, see Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. IV, 1, 1, 2, 1; V&acirc;<I>g</I>. Sa<I>m</I>h. XI, 5; Atharva-veda XVIII, 3, 39; <I>Ri</I>g-veda X, 13, 1. The V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyins read vi <I>s</I>loka etu for vi <I>s</I>lok&acirc; yanti; s&ucirc;re<I>h</I> for s&ucirc;r&acirc;<I>h</I>; <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>vantu for <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>vanti; and the <I>Ri</I>g-veda agrees with them. The dual v&acirc;m is accounted for by the verse belonging to a hymn celebrating the two <I>s</I>akatas, carts, bearing the offerings (havirdh&acirc;ne); most likely, however, the dual referred originally to the dual deities of heaven and earth. I prefer the text of the <I>Ri</I>g-veda and the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyins to that of the Taittir&icirc;yas, and have translated the verse accordingly. In the Atharva-veda XVIII, 39, if we may trust the edition, the verse begins with sv&acirc;sasthe bhavatam indave na<I>h</I>, which is really the end of the next verse (Rv. X, 13, 2), while the second line is, vi <I>s</I>loka eti pathyeva s&ucirc;ri<I>h</I> <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>vantu vi<I>s</I>ve am<I>ri</I>t&acirc;sa etat. I see no sense in pathyeva s&ucirc;r&acirc;<I>h</I>. <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara explains pathyeva by pathi sanm&acirc;rge, athav&acirc; pathy&acirc; k&icirc;rti<I>h</I>, while his later commentary, giving <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>vantu and putr&acirc;<I>h</I> s&ucirc;r&acirc;tmano hira<I>n</I>yagarbhasya, leads one to suppose that he read s&ucirc;re<I>h</I> <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>vantu. <I>S</I>&acirc;yana (Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. IV, 1, 1, 2) explains pathy&acirc; s&ucirc;r&acirc; iva by g&icirc;rv&acirc;<I>n</I>am&acirc;rga antarikshe s&ucirc;ryara<I>s</I>mayo yath&acirc; prasaranti tadvat. The same, when commenting on the <I>Ri</I>g-veda (X, 13, 1), Says: pathy&acirc;-iva s&ucirc;re<I>h</I>, yath&acirc; stotu<I>h</I> svabh&ucirc;t&acirc; pathy&acirc; pari<I>n</I>&acirc;masukh&acirc;vah&acirc;hutir vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;n dev&acirc;n prati vividha<I>m</I> ga<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ati tadvat. Mah&icirc;dhara (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. Sa<I>m</I>h. XI, 5) refers s&ucirc;re<I>h</I> (pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>itasya) to <I>s</I>loka<I>h</I>, and explains pathyeva by patho 'napet&acirc; pathy&acirc; ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>am&acirc;rgaprav<I>ri</I>tt&acirc;huti<I>h</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_733"></A><A HREF="sbe15101.htm#fr_735">240:2</A> Yu<I>g</I>&eacute; cannot stand for yu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>e, as all commentators and translators suppose, but is a datival infinitive. Neither can yu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ate in the following verse stand for yu&#7749;kte (see Boehtlingk, s. v.), or be explained as a subjunctive form. A. reads adhirudhyate, B. abhirudhyate, with a marginal note abhinudyate. It is difficult to say whether in lighting the fire the wind should be directed towards it, or kept from it.</P>

In fact, what was intended to be taught was this, that we must begin with sacrificial acts, then practise yoga, then reach sam&acirc;dhi, perfect knowledge, and lastly bliss.</P>

Thus by fixing the thought on the tip of the nose, a perception of heavenly scent is produced; by fixing it on the tip of the tongue, a perception of heavenly taste; by fixing it on the point of the palate, a heavenly colour; by fixing it on the middle of the tongue, a heavenly touch; by fixing it on the roof of the tongue, a heavenly sound. By means of these perceptions the mind is supposed to be steadied, because it is no longer attracted by the outward objects themselves. See Yoga-s&ucirc;tras I, 35.</P>
