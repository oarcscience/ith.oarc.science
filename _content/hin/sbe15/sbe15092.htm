<p>1. The words Bh&ucirc;mi (earth), Antariksha (sky), and Dyu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_573"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (heaven) form eight syllables. One foot of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; consists of eight syllables. This (one foot) of it is that (i. e. the three worlds). And he who thus knows that foot of it, conquers as far as the three worlds extend.</p>  
<p>2. The <I>Ri</I>kas, the Ya<I>g</I>&ucirc;<I>m</I>shi, and the S&acirc;m&acirc;ni form eight syllables. One foot (the second) of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; consists of eight syllables. This (one foot) of it is that (i.e. the three Vedas, the <I>Ri</I>g-veda, Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, and Sama-veda). And he who thus knows that foot of it, conquers as far as that threefold knowledge extends.</p>  
<p>3. The Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a (the up-breathing), the Ap&acirc;na (the down-breathing), and the Vy&acirc;na (the back-breathing) form eight syllables. One foot (the third) of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; consists of eight syllables. This (one foot) of it is that (i. e. the three vital breaths). And he who thus knows that foot of it, conquers as far as there is anything that breathes. And of that (G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, or speech) this indeed is the fourth (tur&icirc;ya), the bright (dar<I>s</I>ata) foot, shining high above the skies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_574"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. What is here called tur&icirc;ya (the fourth) is meant for <I>k</I>aturtha (the fourth); what is called dar<I>s</I>atam padam (the bright foot) is meant for him who is as it were seen (the person in the sun); and what is called parora<I>g</I>as (he who shines high above the</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></A></p>  
<p>skies) is meant for him who shines higher and higher above every sky. And he who thus knows that foot of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, shines thus himself also with happiness and glory.</p>  
<p>4. That G&acirc;yatr&icirc; (as described before with its three feet) rests on that fourth foot, the bright one, high above the sky. And that again rests on the True (satyam), and the True is the eye, for the eye is (known to be) true. And therefore even now, if two persons come disputing, the one saying, I saw, the other, I heard, then we should trust the one who says, I saw. And the True again rests on force (balam), and force is life (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a), and that (the True) rests on life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_575"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Therefore they say, force is stronger than the True. Thus does that G&acirc;yatr&icirc; rest with respect to the self (as life). That G&acirc;yatr&icirc; protects (tatre) the vital breaths (gayas); the gayas are the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as (vital breaths), and it protects them. And because it protects (tatre) the vital breaths (gayas), therefore it is called G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. And that Savit<I>ri</I> verse which the teacher teaches&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_576"></A><A HREF="#fn_576"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, that is it (the life, the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, and indirectly the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;); and whomsoever he teaches, he protects his vital breaths.</p>  
<p>5. Some teach that S&acirc;vitr&icirc; as an Anush<I>t</I>ubh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> verse, saying that speech is Anush<I>t</I>ubh, and that we teach</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></A></p>  
<p>that speech. Let no one do this, but let him teach the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; as S&acirc;vitr&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And even if one who knows this receives what seems to be much as his reward (as a teacher), yet this is not equal to one foot of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;.</p>  
<p>6. If a man (a teacher) were to receive as his fee these three worlds full of all things, he would obtain that first foot of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. And if a man were to receive as his fee everything as far as this threefold knowledge extends, he would obtain that second foot of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. And if a man were to receive as his fee everything whatsoever breathes, he would obtain that third foot of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. But 'that fourth bright foot, shining high above the skies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>' cannot be obtained by anybody--whence then could one receive such a fee?</p>  
<p>7. The adoration&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_580"></A><A HREF="#fn_580"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of that (G&acirc;yatr&icirc;):</p>  
<p>'O G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, thou hast one foot, two feet, three feet, four feet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_581"></A><A HREF="#fn_581"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Thou art footless, for thou art not known. Worship to thy fourth bright foot above the skies.' If&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> one (who knows this) hates some</p>

<p>one and says, 'May he not obtain this,' or 'May this wish not be accomplished to him,' then that wish is not accomplished to him against whom he thus prays, or if he says, 'May I obtain this.'</p>  
<p>8. And thus <I>G</I>anaka Vaideha spoke on this point to Bu<I>d</I>ila &Acirc;<I>s</I>vatar&acirc;<I>s</I>vi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: 'How is it that thou who spokest thus as knowing the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, hast become an elephant and carriest me?' He answered: 'Your Majesty, I did not know its mouth. Agni, fire, is indeed its mouth; and if people pile even what seems much (wood) on the fire, it consumes it all. And thus a man who knows this, even if he commits what seems much evil, consumes it all and becomes pure, clean, and free from decay and death.'</p>

Here the application is of two kinds, abhi<I>k</I>&acirc;rika, imprecatory against another, and abhyudayika, auspicious for oneself. The former has two formulas, the latter one.
