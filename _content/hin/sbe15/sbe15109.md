### FOURTH QUESTION.

1\. Then Sauryâya*n*in Gârgya asked: 'Sir, What are they that sleep in
this man, and what are they that are awake in him? What power (deva) is
it that sees dreams? Whose is the happiness? On what do all these
depend?'

2\. He replied: 'O Gârgya, As all the rays of the sun, when it sets, are
gathered up in that disc of light, and as they, when the sun rises again
and again, come forth, so is all this (all the senses) gathered up in
the highest faculty (deva) <span id="fr_902"></span>[1](#fn_900), the
mind. Therefore at that time that man does not hear, see, smell, taste,
touch, he does not speak, he does not take, does not enjoy, does not
evacuate, does not move about. He sleeps, that is what people say.

3\. The fires of the prâ*n*as are, as it were <span
id="fr_903"></span>[2](#fn_901), awake in that town (the body). The
Apâna is the Gârhapatya fire, the Vyâna the Anvâhâryapa*k*ana fire; and
because it is taken out of the Gârhapatya fire, which is fire for taking
out <span id="fr_904"></span>[3](#fn_902), therefore the Prâ*n*a is the
Âhavanîya fire <span id="fr_905"></span>[4](#fn_903).

Now the Apâna is identified with the Gârhapatya fire, no reason being
given except afterwards, when it is said that the Prâ*n*a is the
Âhavanîya fire, being taken out of the Gârhapatya, here called <span
id="page_280">p. 280</span> pra*n*ayana, in the same manner as the
prâ*n*a proceeds in sleep from the apâna. The Vyâna is identified with
the Dakshi*n*âgni, the Southern fire, because it issues from the heart
through an aperture on the right.

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

4\. Because it carries equally these two oblations, the out-breathing
and the in-breathing, the Samâna is he (the Hot*ri* priest) <span
id="fr_906"></span>[1](#fn_904). The mind is the sacrificer, the Udâna
is the reward of the sacrifice, and it leads the sacrificer every day
(in deep sleep) to Brahman.

5\. There that god <span id="fr_907"></span>[2](#fn_905) (the mind)
enjoys in sleep greatness. What has been seen, he <span
id="fr_908"></span>[2](#fn_905) sees again; what has been heard, he
hears again; what has been enjoyed in different countries and quarters,
he enjoys again; what has been seen and not seen, heard and not heard,
enjoyed and not enjoyed, he sees it all; he, being all, sees.

6\. And when he is overpowered by light <span
id="fr_909"></span>[3](#fn_906), then that god sees no dreams, and at
that time that happiness arises in his body.

7\. And, O friend, as birds go to a tree to roost, thus all this rests
in the Highest Âtman,--

8\. The earth and its subtile elements, the water and its subtile
elements, the light and its subtile elements, the air and its subtile
elements, the ether and its subtile elements; the eye and what can be

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

seen, the ear and what can be heard, the nose and what can be smelled,
the taste and what can be tasted, the skin and what can be touched, the
voice and what can be spoken, the hands and what can be grasped, the
feet and what can be walked, the mind and what can be perceived,
intellect (buddhi) and what can be conceived, personality and what can
be personified, thought and what can be thought, light and what can be
lighted up, the Prâ*n*a and what is to be supported by it.

9\. For he it is who sees, hears, smells, tastes, perceives, conceives,
acts, he whose essence is knowledge <span
id="fr_910"></span>[1](#fn_907), the person, and he dwells in the
highest, indestructible Self,--

10\. He who knows that indestructible being, obtains (what is) the
highest and indestructible, he without a shadow, without a body, without
colour, bright--,yes, O friend, he who knows it, becomes all-knowing,
becomes all. On this there is this *S*loka:

11\. He, O friend, who knows that indestructible being wherein the true
knower, the vital spirits (prâ*n*as), together with all the powers
(deva), and the elements rest, he, being all-knowing, has penetrated
all.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_900"></span>[279:1](sbe15109.htm#fr_902) See note to verse
5.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[279:2](sbe15109.htm#fr_903) We ought to read
agnaya iva.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[279:3](sbe15109.htm#fr_904) Pra*n*ayana,
pra*n*îyate 'smâd iti pra*n*ayano gârhapatyo 'gni*h*.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[279:4](sbe15109.htm#fr_905) The comparison
between the prâ*n*as and the fires or altars is not very clear. As to
the fires or altars, there is the Gârhapatya, placed in the South-west,
the household fire, which is always kept burning, from which the fire is
taken to the other altars. The Anvâhâryapa*k*ana, commonly called the
Dakshi*n*a fire, placed in the South, used chiefly for oblations to the
forefathers. The Âhavanîya fire, placed in the East, and used for
sacrifices to the gods.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[280:1](sbe15109.htm#fr_906) The name of the
Hot*ri* priest must be supplied. He is supposed to carry two oblations
equally to the Âhavanîya, and in the same way the Vyâna, combines the
two breathings, the in and out breathings.

<span id="fn_905"></span>[280:2](sbe15109.htm#fr_908) The *g*îvâtman
under the guise of manas. The Sanskrit word is deva, god, used in the
sense of an invisible power, but as a masculine. The commentator uses
manodeva*h*, p. 212, l. 5. I generally translate deva, if used in this
sense, by faculty, but the context required a masculine. See verse 2.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[280:3](sbe15109.htm#fr_909) In the state of
profound sleep or sushupti.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[281:1](sbe15109.htm#fr_910) Buddhi and the
rest are the instruments of knowledge, but there is the knower, the
person, in the Highest Self.
