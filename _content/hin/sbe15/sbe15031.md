*The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TENTH ANUVÂKA.

1\. 'I am he who shakes the tree (i.e. the tree of the world, which has
to be cut down by knowledge). 2. My glory is like the top of a mountain.
3. I, whose pure light (of knowledge) has risen high, am that which is
truly immortal, as it resides in the sun.

4\. I am the brightest treasure. 5. I am wise, immortal,
imperishable <span id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_210).' 6. This is the
teaching of the Veda, by the poet Tri*s*aṅku.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_210"></span>[52:1](sbe15031.htm#fr_210) This verse has been
translated as the commentator wishes it to be understood, in praise of
that knowledge of Self which is only to be obtained after all other
duties, and, more particularly, the study of the Veda, have been
performed. The text is probably corrupt, and the interpretation
fanciful.
