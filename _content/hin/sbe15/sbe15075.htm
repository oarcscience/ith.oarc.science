Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya granted it, and thus the King was the first to ask him a question.</p>  
<p>2. 'Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya,' he said, 'what is the light of man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?'</p>  
<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya replied: 'The sun, O King; for, having the sun alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.'</p>  
<p><I>G</I>anaka Vaideha said: 'So indeed it is, O Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya.'</p>  
<p>3. <I>G</I>anaka Vaideha said: 'When the sun has set, O Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, what is then the light of man?'</p>  
<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya replied: 'The moon indeed is his light; for, having the moon alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.'</p>

<p>4. <I>G</I>anaka Vaideha said: 'When the sun has set, O Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, and the moon has set, what is the light of man?'</p>  
<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya replied: 'Fire indeed is his light;</p>

<p>5. <I>G</I>anaka Vaideha said: 'When the sun has set, O Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, and the moon has set, and the fire is gone out, what is then the light of man?'</p>  
<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya replied: 'Sound indeed is his light; for, having sound alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns. Therefore, O King, when one cannot see even one's own hand, yet when a sound is raised, one goes towards it.'</p>  
<p><I>G</I>anaka Vaideha said: 'So indeed it is, O Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya.'</p>  
<p>6. <I>G</I>anaka Vaideha said: 'When the sun has set, O Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, and the moon has set, and the fire is gone out, and the sound hushed, what is then the light of man?'</p>  
<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya said: 'The Self indeed is his light; for, having the Self alone as his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.'</p>  
<p>7. <I>G</I>anaka Vaideha said: 'Who is that Self?'</p>  
<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya replied: 'He who is within the heart, surrounded by the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (senses), the person of light, consisting of knowledge.

<p>9. 'And there are two states for that person, the one here in this world, the other in the other world, and as a third&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> an intermediate state, the state of sleep. When in that intermediate state, he sees both those states together, the one here in this world, and the other in the other world. Now whatever his admission to the other world may be, having gained that admission, he sees both the evils and the blessings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'And when he falls asleep, then after having taken away with him the material from the whole world, destroying&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and building it up again, he sleeps (dreams) by his own light. In that state the person is self-illuminated.</p>  
<p>10. 'There are no (real) chariots in that state, no horses, no roads, but he himself sends forth (creates) chariots, horses, and roads. There are no blessings there, no happiness, no joys, but he himself sends forth (creates) blessings, happiness, and joys. There</p>

<p>are no tanks there, no lakes, no rivers, but he himself sends forth (creates) tanks, lakes, and rivers. He indeed is the maker.</p>  
<p>11. 'On this there are these verses:</p>  
<p>'After having subdued by sleep all that belongs to the body, he, not asleep himself, looks down upon the sleeping (senses). Having assumed light, he goes again to his place, the golden person&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_484"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the lonely bird. (1)</p>  
<p>12. 'Guarding with the breath (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, life) the lower nest, the immortal moves away from the nest; that immortal one goes wherever he likes, the golden person, the lonely bird. (2)</p>  
<p>13. 'Going up and down in his dream, the god makes manifold shapes for himself, either rejoicing together with women, or laughing (with his friends), or seeing terrible sights. (3)</p>  
<p>14. 'People may see his playground&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_485"></A><A HREF="#fn_485"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> but himself no one ever sees. Therefore they say, Let no one wake a man suddenly, for it is not easy to remedy, if he does not get back (rightly to his body)."</p>  
<p>'Here some people (object and) say: "No, this (sleep) is the same as the place of waking, for what he sees while awake, that only he sees when asleep&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>."</p>

<p>18. 'In fact, as a large fish moves along the two banks of a river, the right and the left, so does that person move along these two states, the state of sleeping and the state of waking.</p>  
<p>19. 'And as a falcon, or any other (swift) bird, after he has roamed about here in the air, becomes tired, and folding his wings is carried to his nest, so does that person hasten to that state where, when asleep, he desires no more desires, and dreams no more dreams.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_476"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_476">161:1</A> The introduction to this Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a has a very peculiar interest, as showing the close coherence of the different portions which together form the historical groundwork of the Upanishads. <I>G</I>anaka Vaideha and Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya are leading characters in the B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ranyaka-upanishad, and whenever they meet they seem to converse quite freely, though each retains his own character, and Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya honours <I>G</I>anaka as king quite as much as <I>G</I>anaka honours Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya as a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. Now in our chapter we read that Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya did not wish to enter on a discussion, but that <I>G</I>anaka was the first to address him (p&ucirc;rvam papra<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a). This was evidently considered not quite correct, and an explanation is given, that <I>G</I>anaka took this liberty because on a former occasion Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya had granted him permission to address questions to him, whenever he liked. It might be objected that such an explanation looks very much like an after-thought, and we find indeed that in India itself some of the later commentators tried to avoid the difficulty by dividing the words sa mene na vadishya iti, into sam enena vadishya iti, so that we should have to translate, 'Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya came to <I>G</I>anaka intending to speak with him.' (See Dvivedaga&#7749;ga's Comm. p. 1141.) This is, no doubt, a very ingenious conjecture, which might well rouse the envy of European scholars. But it is no more. The accents decide nothing, because they are changed by different writers, according to their different views of what the Pada text ought to be. What made me prefer the reading which is supported by <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara and Dvivedaga&#7749;ga, though the latter alludes to the other pada<I>k</I><I>kh</I>eda, is that the tmesis, sam enena vadishye, does not occur again, while sa mene is a common phrase. But the most interesting point, as I remarked before, is that this former disputation between <I>G</I>anaka and Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya and the permission granted to the King to ask any question he liked, is not a mere invention to account for the apparent rudeness by which Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya is forced to enter on a discussion against his will, but actually occurs in a former chapter. In <I>S</I>atap. Br. XI, 6, 2, 10, we read: tasmai ha Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkyo vara<I>m</I> dadau; sa hov&acirc;<I>k</I>a, k&acirc;mapra<I>s</I><I>n</I>a <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></A> eva me tvayi Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalky&acirc;sad iti, tato brahm&acirc; <I>G</I>anaka &acirc;sa. This would show that <I>G</I>anaka was considered almost like a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, or at all events enjoyed certain privileges which were supposed to belong to the first caste only. See, for a different view, Deussen, Ved&acirc;nta, p. 203; Regnaud (Mat&eacute;riaux pour servir &agrave; l'histoire de la philosophie de l'Inde), Errata; and Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. lxxiii.</P>

It means man, but also the true essence of man, the soul, as we should say, or something more abstract still, the person, as I generally translate it, though a person beyond the Ego.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_481"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_481">164:1</A> There are really two sth&acirc;nas or states only; the place where they meet, like the place where two villages meet, belongs to both, but it may be distinguished as a third. Dvivedaga&#7749;ga (p. 1141) uses a curious argument in support of the existence of another world. In early childhood, he says, our dreams consist of the impressions of a former world, later on they are filled with the impressions of our senses, and in old age they contain visions of a world to come.</P>

The commentator explains m&acirc;tr&acirc; as a portion of the impressions which are taken away into sleep. 'Destroying' he refers to the body, which in sleep becomes senseless, and 'building up' to the imaginations of dreams.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_484"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_484">165:1</A> The M&acirc;dhyandinas read paurusha, as an adjective to ekaha<I>m</I>sa, but Dvivedaga&#7749;ga explains paurusha as a synonym of purusha, which is the reading of the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_485"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_485">165:2</A> Cf. Su<I>s</I>ruta III, 7, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_486"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_486">165:3</A> I have translated this according to the commentator, who says: 'Therefore the Self is self-illuminated during sleep. But others say the state of waking is indeed the same for him as sleep; there is no other intermediate place, different from this and from the other world.... And if sleep is the same as the state of waking, then is this Self not separate, not cause and effect, but mixed with them, and the Self therefore not self-illuminated. What he means <a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="green">p. 166</font></A> is that others, in order to disprove the self-illumination, say that this sleep is the same as the state of waking, giving as their reason that we see in sleep or in dreams exactly what we see in waking. But this is wrong, because the senses have stopped, and only when the senses have stopped does one see dreams. Therefore there is no necessity for admitting another light in sleep, but only the light inherent in the Self. This has been proved by all that went before.' Dr. Roer takes the same view in his translation, but Deussen (Ved&acirc;nta, p. 205) takes an independent view, and translates: I Therefore it is said: It (sleep) is to him a place of waking only, for what he sees waking, the same he sees in sleep. Thus this spirit serves there for his own light.' Though the interpretations of <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara and Dvivedaga&#7749;ga sound artificial, still Dr. Deussen's version does not remove all difficulties. If the purusha saw in sleep no more than what he had seen before in waking, then the whole argument in favour of the independent action, or the independent light of the purusha, would go; anyhow it would be no argument on Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya's side. See also note to paragraph 9, before.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_487"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_487">166:1</A> The M&acirc;dhyandinas speak only of his return from svapn&acirc;nta to buddh&acirc;nta, from sleep to waking, instead of his going from sainpras&acirc;da (deep sleep) to svapn&acirc; (dream), from svapn&acirc; to buddh&acirc;nta, and from buddh&acirc;nta again to svapn&acirc;nta, as the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas have it. In &sect; 18 the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas also mention svapn&acirc;nta and buddh&acirc;nta only, but the next paragraph refers to sushupti.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_488"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_488">167:1</A> Dvivedaga&#7749;ga explains that if phlegm predominates, qualified by wind and bile, the juice in the veins is white; if wind predominates, qualified by phlegm and bile, it is blue; if bile predominates, qualified by wind and phlegm, it is yellow; if wind and phlegm <a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="green">p. 168</font></A> predominate, with little bile only, it is green; and if the three elements are equal, it is red. See also &Acirc;nandagiri's gloss, where Su<I>s</I>ruta is quoted. Why this should be inserted here, is not quite clear, except that in sleep the purusha is supposed to, move about in the veins.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_489"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_489">168:1</A> Here, again, the commentator seems to be right, but his interpretation does violence to the context. The dangers which a man sees in his sleep are represented as mere imaginations, so is his idea of being of god or a king, while the idea that he is all this (aham eveda<I>m</I> sarva<I>h</I>, i.e. ida<I>m</I> sarvam, see <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara, p. 873, l. 11) is represented as the highest and real state. But it is impossible to begin a new sentence with aham evedam sarvam, and though it is true that all the preceding fancies are qualified by iva, I prefer to take deva and r&acirc;<I>g</I>an as steps leading to the sarv&acirc;tmatva.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_490"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_490">168:2</A> The M&acirc;dhyandinas repeat here the sentence from yatra supto to pa<I>s</I>yati, from the end of &sect; 19.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_491"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_491">168:3</A> The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text reads ati<I>k</I><I>kh</I>and&acirc; apahatap&acirc;pm&acirc;. <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara explains ati<I>k</I><I>kh</I>and&acirc; by ati<I>k</I><I>kh</I>andam, and excuses it as sv&acirc;dhy&acirc;yadharma<I>h</I> p&acirc;<I>th</I>a<I>h</I>. The M&acirc;dhyandinas read ati<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ando, but place the whole sentence where the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas put &acirc;ptak&acirc;mam &amp;c., at the end of &sect; 21.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_492"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_492">169:1</A> The K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas read <I>s</I>ok&acirc;ntaram, the M&acirc;dhyandinas a<I>s</I>ok&acirc;ntaram, but the commentators arrive at the same result, namely, that it means <I>s</I>oka<I>s</I>&ucirc;nyam, free from grief <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara says: <I>s</I>ok&acirc;ntara<I>m</I> soka<I>k</I><I>kh</I>idra<I>m</I> <I>s</I>oka<I>s</I>&ucirc;nyam ityeta<I>k</I>, <I>kh</I>okamadhyaman iti vi; sarvath&acirc;py a<I>s</I>okam.

We find anv&acirc;gata used in a similar way in &sect;&sect; 15, 16, &amp;c. But the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas read ananv&acirc;gata<I>m</I> pu<I>n</I>yena ananv&acirc;gatam p&acirc;pena, and <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara explains the neuter by referring it to r&ucirc;pam (r&ucirc;paparatv&acirc;n napu<I>m</I>sakali&#7749;gam). The M&acirc;dhyandinas, if we may trust Weber's edition, read ananv&acirc;gata<I>h</I> pu<I>n</I>yen&acirc;nv&acirc;gata<I>h</I> p&acirc;pena. The second anv&acirc;gata<I>h</I> may be a mere misprint, but Dvivedaga&#7749;ga seems to have read ananv&acirc;gatam, like the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas, for he says: ananv&acirc;gatam iti r&ucirc;pavishayo napu<I>m</I>sakanirde<I>s</I>a<I>h</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_499"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_499">169:8</A> This is the old Upanishad argument that the true sense is the Self, and not the eye. Although therefore in the state of profound sleep, where the eye and the other senses rest, it might be said that the purusha does not see, yet he is a seer all the time, though he does not see with the eye. The seer cannot lose his character <a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170</font></A> of seeing, as little as the fire can lose its character of burning, so long as it is fire. The Self sees by its own light, like the sun, even where there is no second, no object but the Self, that could be seen.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_500"></A><A HREF="sbe15075.htm#fr_500">171:1</A> Salila is explained as salilavat, like the ocean, the seer being one like the ocean, which is one only.
