<p>'Eight Grahas,' he replied,' and eight Atigrahas.'</p>  
<p>'And what are these eight Grahas and eight Atigrahas?'</p>

<p>3. 'Speech (v&acirc;<I>k</I>) is one Graha, and that is seized by name (n&acirc;man) as the Atigr&acirc;ha, for with speech one pronounces names.</p>  
<p>4. 'The tongue is one Graha, and that is seized by taste as the Atigr&acirc;ha, for with the tongue one perceives tastes.'</p>  
<p>5. 'The eye is one Graha, and that is seized by form as the Atigr&acirc;ha, for with the eye one sees forms.'</p>

<p>9. 'The skin is one Graha, and that is seized by touch as the Atigr&acirc;ha, for with the skin one perceives touch. These are the eight Grahas and the eight Atigrahas.'</p>  
<p>10. 'Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya,' he said, 'everything is the food of death. What then is the deity to whom death is food?'</p>  
<p>'Fire (agni) is death, and that is the food of water. Death is conquered again.'</p>  
<p>11. 'Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya,' he said, 'when such a person (a sage) dies, do the vital breaths (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as) move out of him or no?'</p>

<p>'The name,' he replied; 'for the name is endless, the Vi<I>s</I>vedevas are endless, and by it he gains the endless world.'</p>

<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya said: 'Take my hand, my friend. We two alone shall know of this; let this question of ours not be (discussed) in public.' Then these two went out and argued, and what they said was karman (work), what they praised was karman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, viz. that a man becomes good by good work, and bad by bad work.
