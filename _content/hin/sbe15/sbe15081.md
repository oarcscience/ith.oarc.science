### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. Pra*g*âpati is the heart, is this Brahman, is all this. The heart,
h*ri*daya, consists of three syllables. One syllable is h*ri*, and to
him who knows this, his own people and others bring offerings <span
id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_553). One syllable is da, and to him who
knows this, his own people and others bring gifts. One syllable is yam,
and he who knows this, goes to heaven (svarga) as his world.

that with regard to the heart, i.e. buddhi, the senses are 'its own
people,' and the objects of the senses 'the others.'
