<p>Whenever we see or read of any miracles of supernatural power shown by human beings in India it is always done by Yoga.</p>  
<p>What is this Yoga that gives such wonderful power, divine peace, longevity, etc.?</p>  
<p>Yoga is the science of sciences, it is the way that leads to Godhood. "The Yoga we practice, is not for ourselves alone, but for humanity. Its object is not personal Mukti (liberation), although Mukti is a necessary condition of the Yoga, but the libration of the human race. It is not personal ananda (bliss), but the bringing down of the divine Ananda&#8212;Christ's Kingdom of Heaven, our Satyayuga upon the earth".&#8212;</p>  
<p>&#8212;An excerpt from "The Yoga and Its Objects".</p>  
<p>"Humanity is evolving. Yoga is the means of carrying that evolution forward with great and victorious rapidity", "Yogic Sadhan".</p>  
<p>"The goal marked out for us is not to speculate about these things but to experience them. The call upon us is to grow into the image of God, to dwell in Him and with</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Him and be a channel of His joy and might and an instrument of His works. Purified from all that is Asubha (evil), transfigured in soul by His touch we have to act in the world as dynamos of that divine electricity and send it thrilling and radiating thru mankind, so that wherever one of us stands, hundreds around may become full of His light and force, full of God and full of Ananda (the bliss of the spirit). Churches, orders, theologies, philosophies have failed to save mankind because they have busied themselves with intellectual creeds, dogmas, rites and institutions, with achara sudhi and darshana, as if these could save mankind, and have neglected the one thing needful, the power and purification of the soul. We must go back to the one thing needful, take-up again Christ's Gospel of the purity and perfection of mankind, Mahomed's gospel of perfect submission, self-surrender and servitude of God, Chaitanya's gospel of the perfect love and joy of God in man, Ramkrishna's gospel of the unity of all religions and the divinity of God in man, and gathering all these streams into one mighty river, one purifying and redeeming Ganges, pour it over the death-in-life of a</p>

<p>materialistic humanity as Bhagiratha led down the Ganges and flooded with it the ashes of his fathers, so that there may be a resurrection of the soul in mankind and the Satya yuga for a while returns to the world. Nor is this the whole object of the Lila or the Yoga, the reason for which the Avatars descend is to raise up man again and again, developing in him a higher and ever higher-humanity, a greater and yet greater development of divine being, bringing more and more of heaven again and again upon the earth until our toil is done. Our work accomplished and Sachchidananda fulfilled in all even here, even in this material universe. Small is his work, even if he succeeds, who labours for his own salvation or the salvation of a few, infinitely great is he even if he fail or succeed only partially or for a season, who lives only to bring about peace of soul, joy, purity and perfection among all mankind."</p>
