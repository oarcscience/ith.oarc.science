#### 23. The Ordeal by Poison.

\* 318. <span id="fr_326"></span>[318](#fn_326) Now I shall proclaim the
excellent rule regarding the ordeal by poison: at what time, in what
manner, and in what form it should be administered.

\* 319. <span id="fr_327"></span>[319](#fn_327) The exact quantity of
the poison (to be given) having been fixed by persons conversant with
the essence of law, it shall be weighed, and given to the defendant in
the autumn season, when winter sets in.

320. <span id="fr_328"></span>[320](#fn_328) A man acquainted with law,
must not (administer this ordeal) in the afternoon, nor in the

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

twilight, nor at noon. It must be avoided, likewise, in the autumn,
summer, spring, and rainy seasons.

\* 321. <span id="fr_329"></span>[321](#fn_329) Spoiled poison, shaken
poison, scented and mixed poison, as well as Kâlakû*t*a and Alâbu
poison, should be carefully avoided.

\* 322. Poison from the *Sri*ṅga plant, which grows in the Himâlayas, of
an excellent quality, having (the required) colour, flavour, and taste,
and preserving its natural condition, should be given to members of the
Kshatriya, Vai*s*ya, and *S*ûdra castes.

\* 323. <span id="fr_330"></span>[323](#fn_330) Let him give to the
defendant one-eighth less than the twentieth part of a sixth part of a
Pala of the poison, mixed with clarified butter.

\* 324. <span id="fr_331"></span>[324](#fn_331) Six Yavas should be
given in the rainy season; five Yavas in the hot season; seven or eight
in the winter season; in the autumn season this ordeal must not take
place.

\* 325. <span id="fr_332"></span>[325](#fn_332) ‘Thou, O poison, art the
son of Brahman.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Truth and virtue
are thy support. Clear this man from guilt. Become (like) Ambrosia to
him, through truth.’

\* 326. <span id="fr_333"></span>[326](#fn_333)Let the man be kept in a
shadowy place without taking food, for the whole remainder of the day.
If he remains free from convulsions such as are generally caused by
poison, he is declared innocent by Manu.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_326"></span>[114:318](sbe3330.htm#fr_326) 318-326. The
ordeal by poison consists of the swallowing of a mild poison by the
defendant. He is innocent if he digests the poison without being
affected by it. Vish*n*u XIII; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 110, 111.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[114:319](sbe3330.htm#fr_327) The autumn
season, *S*arad, comprises the two months of Â*s*vina and Kârttika, or
from middle of September to middle of November. The winter season
comprises the two months of Aprahâya*n*a and Pausha, or from middle of
November to middle of January. Mitrami*s*ra, who quotes this text in the
Vîramitrodaya, asserts that the term 'the winter season' must be taken
in this place to include the dewy season, *S*i*s*ira, as well, i.e. the
time from middle of January to middle of March.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[114:320](sbe3330.htm#fr_328) Though the season
of *S*arad has been referred to in par. 319, it must be reckoned among
the prohibited seasons according to par. 320. A. This observation seems
to be just, because the performance of this ordeal in the *S*arad season
is prohibited in par. 324 as well. Vasanta, the spring season, extends
from middle of March to middle of May. Grîshma, the hot season, extends
from middle of May to middle of July. Varshâ, the season of the rains,
extends from middle of July to middle of September.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[115:321](sbe3330.htm#fr_329) Spoiled, shaken,
scented, and mixed poison should be avoided, because it has been changed
from its natural state (into something different). Kâlakû*t*a and Alâbu
poison should be avoided, because it is too strong. A. Kâlakû*t*a is a
certain deadly poison contained in a bulbous root or tuber. According to
a well-known myth, the Kâlakû*t*a poison was produced at the churning of
the ocean, when it threatened to destroy the whole world, and was
therefore swallowed by Siva. Alâbu is the bottle-gourd.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[115:323](sbe3330.htm#fr_330) There are 960
Yavas to a Pala. The fraction, therefore, is as follows:—960 ∙ 1/6 ∙
1/20 ∙ ⅞ = 7 Yavas. In par. 324, the author says that seven or eight
Yavas of poison should be given in winter, i.e. in that season when this
ordeal is ordinarily administered. Vish*n*u lays down generally that
seven Yavas of poison should be given.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[115:324](sbe3330.htm#fr_331) This rule shows
that the prohibition which has been levelled in par. 320 against the
performance of this ordeal in the rainy and summer seasons, must not be
interpreted too strictly.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[115:325](sbe3330.htm#fr_332) This is the
prayer which should be addressed to the poison. A.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[116:326](sbe3330.htm#fr_333) Here ends the
chapter of the ordeal by poison. A.
