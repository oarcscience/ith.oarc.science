# TENTH TITLE OF LAW.

##### TRANSGRESSION OF A COMPACT.

\* 1. <span id="fr_447"></span>[1](#fn_447) The aggregate of the rules
settled amongst heretics, followers of the Veda (Naigamas) and others,
is called Samaya (compact, or established usage). Thus arises a title of
law, termed Transgression of a Compact.

\* 2. <span id="fr_448"></span>[2](#fn_448) Among heretics, followers of
the Veda (Naigamas), guilds (of merchants), corporations (Pûgas), troops
(of soldiers), assemblages (of kinsmen), and other (associations) the
king must maintain the usages (settled among them), both in fortified
towns and in the open country.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

\* 3. <span id="fr_449"></span>[3](#fn_449) Whatever be their laws,
their (religious) duties, (the rules regarding) their attendance, and
the (particular mode of) livelihood prescribed for them, that the king
shall approve of.

\* 4. <span id="fr_450"></span>[4](#fn_450) The king shall prevent them
from undertaking such acts as would be either opposed (to the wishes of
the king), or contemptible in their nature, or injurious to his
interests.

\* 5. <span id="fr_451"></span>[5](#fn_451) Mixed assemblages, unlawful
wearing of arms, and mutual attacks between those persons shall not be
tolerated by the king.

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

\* 6. <span id="fr_452"></span>[6](#fn_452) Those who cause dissension
among the members of an association, shall undergo punishment of a
specially severe kind; because they would prove extremely dangerous,
like an (epidemic) disease, if they were allowed to go free.

\* 7. <span id="fr_453"></span>[7](#fn_453) Whenever a criminal act,
opposed to the dictates of morality, has been attempted, a king desirous
of prosperity shall redress it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_447"></span>[153:1](sbe3342.htm#fr_447) X, 1. 'Heretics,'
Kshapa*n*akas (Buddhist or Jain mendicants) and others who detract from
the authority of the Veda. 'Naigamas,' traders or merchants. According
to the Mitâksharâ, the term Naigama refers to Pâ*s*upatas and others who
uphold the authority of the Veda. The term 'and others' is used to
include corporations of learned Brahmans and other (associations).
Vîramitrodaya, p. 423. The term samaya, literally 'compact,' denotes
local or caste usages, the violation of which forms the subject of the
tenth title of law.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[153:2](sbe3342.htm#fr_448) Of the term
Naigama, the commentators give the same two different interpretations as
in the preceding paragraph. I have referred it to 'followers of the
Veda,' because it comes immediately after the term 'heretics.' The term
pûga has three interpretations in this place. Some say it means
'companies of traders or others.' <span id="page_154">p. 154</span>
Others say it denotes 'associations of persons differing in caste, whose
mode of subsistence is not fixed.' The Vîramitrodaya interprets it as
referring to riders on elephants, horses, &c. In explanation of the
terms vrâta, 'a troop of soldiers,' and ga*n*a, 'an assemblage of
kinsmen,' the commentators quote the following text of Kâtyâyana: 'A
multitude of united men armed with various weapons is called vrâta. An
assemblage of families is called ga*n*a.' Manu VIII, 41; Yâ*gñ*avalkya
II, 192, &c.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[154:3](sbe3342.htm#fr_449) 'Their laws,' such
as to speak the truth. 'Their (religious) duties,' such as the duty of
going about begging alms when the night is over, early in the morning.
'The rules regarding their attendance,' the duty of attending, in a
temple or other (public hall), for the affairs of the community, when
the sound of a drum or other instrument is heard. Vîramitrodaya, p. 430.
The Ratnâkara interprets the term karma, 'their (religious) duties,' by
'their proper occupation for a livelihood.' The drift of this rule,
according to [*G*agannâtha](errata.htm#1), is this, that the king must
not act otherwise than is consistent with the usages of castes or other
corporations. See Colebrooke's Digest, III, 2, 11. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II,
192, &c.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[154:4](sbe3342.htm#fr_450) 'Contemptible in
their nature,' essentially despicable, such as the eating of betel,
which is customary among heretics and others. 'Injurious to his
interests,' causing pecuniary loss, &c. 'He shall prevent them from
undertaking such acts,' he shall act so that they do not undertake them.
Vîramitrodaya, pp. 430, 431.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[154:5](sbe3342.htm#fr_451) 'Mixed
assemblages,' meetings or gatherings of persons differing in caste.
'Unlawful wearing of arms,' wearing arms without sufficient motives,
such as the apprehension of a danger. See Ratnâkara, as quoted in
Colebrooke's Digest, III, 2, 25.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[155:6](sbe3342.htm#fr_452) 'An association,' a
guild of merchants or other corporation. Vîramitrodaya, p. 430.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[155:7](sbe3342.htm#fr_453) When an act tainted
with the sin of covetousness or another crime, and opposed to the
dictates of revealed and traditional law, such as e.g. the prostitution
of widows or other (virtuous females) among heretics or other (sinful
men), has been attempted, the king must redress it, though it may have
been practised for a long time. Vîramitrodaya, p. 431.
