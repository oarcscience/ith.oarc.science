### XVII. VIOLATION OF AGREEMENTS.

1. <span id="fr_1123"></span>[1](#fn_1122) Thus has been declared the
law concerning the mutual relations between master and servant; learn
now concisely the performance of agreements.

2. <span id="fr_1124"></span>[2](#fn_1123) Brahmans imbued with a
knowledge of the Veda and of sacred lore, learned divines, and persons
keeping a sacrificial fire, (the king) should worship, establish them
there (in his kingdom), and provide a maintenance for them.

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

3\. Let him bestow on them houses and landed property, exempt from
taxation, declaring in a written grant that the revenue is remitted.

4\. They shall perform for the citizens constant, special, and voluntary
rites, as well as expiatory and auspicious ones, and pass a decision in
doubtful cases.

5\. A compact formed among villagers, companies (of artizans), and
associations is (called) an agreement; such (an agreement) must be
observed both in times of distress and for acts of piety.

6\. When a danger is apprehended from robbers or thieves, it is
(considered as) distress common to all; in such a case, (the danger)
must be repelled by all, not by one man alone whoever he may be.

7\. Mutual confidence having first been established by means of (the
ordeal by) sacred libation, by, a stipulation in writing, or by umpires,
they shall then set about their work.

8\. Enemies, dissolute, bashful, indolent, timid, avaricious, overaged
or very young persons must not be chosen as intendants of affairs.

9\. Honest persons, acquainted with the Vedas and with duty, able,
self-controlled, sprung from noble families, and skilled in every
business, shall be appointed as heads (of an association).

10\. Two, three, or five persons shall be appointed as advisers of the
association; their advice shall be taken by the villagers, companies (of
artizans), corporations (of cohabitants), and other (fellowships).

11. <span id="fr_1125"></span>[11](#fn_1124) When a stipulation has been
entered in a

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

document as follows, ‘The construction of a house of assembly, of a shed
for (accommodating travellers with) water, a temple, a pool, or a
garden,

12\. Relief to helpless or poor people, the performance of sacrificial
acts, a common path, or defence, shall be undertaken by us in
proportionate shares:’ that is a lawful agreement.

13\. (Such an agreement) must be kept by all. He who fails (in his
agreement), though able (to perform it), shall be punished by
confiscation of his entire property, and by banishment from the town.

14\. And for that man, whoever he may be, who falls out (with his
associates), or neglects (his work), a fine is ordained amounting to six
Nishkas of four *S*uvar*n*as each.

15. <span id="fr_1126"></span>[15](#fn_1125) He who injures the joint
stock, or insults a Brahman acquainted with the three Vedas, or breaks
the mutual agreement, shall be banished from the town.

16. <span id="fr_1127"></span>[16](#fn_1126) An acrimonious or malicious
man, and one who causes dissension or does violent acts, or who is
inimically disposed towards that company, association, or the king,
shall be banished instantly from the town.

17. <span id="fr_1128"></span>[17](#fn_1127) The heads of families,
companies (of artizans) and associations, whether inhabiting a town or a
stronghold, shall censure and reprimand offenders, and forsake them.

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

18. <span id="fr_1129"></span>[18](#fn_1128) Whatever is done by those
(heads of an association), whether harsh or kind towards other people,
must be approved of by the king as well; for they are declared to be the
appointed managers (of affairs).

19. <span id="fr_1130"></span>[19](#fn_1129) Should they agree, actuated
by hatred, on injuring a single member of the fellowship, the king must
restrain them; and they shall be punished, if they persist in their
conduct.

20. <span id="fr_1131"></span>[20](#fn_1130) When a dispute arises
between the chiefs and the societies, the king shall decide it, and
shall bring them back to their duty.

21. <span id="fr_1132"></span>[21](#fn_1131) Those (companions in trade)
who conspire to cheat the king of the share due to him (of their
profits), shall be compelled to pay eight times as much, and shall be
punished if they take to flight.

22. <span id="fr_1133"></span>[22](#fn_1132) Whatever is obtained then
by a man, shall belong to all in common; whether it have been obtained a
sixmonth or a month ago, it shall be divided in due proportion.

23. <span id="fr_1134"></span>[23](#fn_1133) (Or) it shall be bestowed
on the idiotic, the aged, the blind, to women or children, to afflicted
or diseased persons, to persons having issue, or the like (worthy
persons). This is an eternal law.

24\. Whatever is obtained or preserved by the members of a fellowship,
or spent on behalf of the

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

society, or acquired through the king's favour, is common to all
(members of the society).
