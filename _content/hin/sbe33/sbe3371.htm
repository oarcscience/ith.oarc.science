<p>1.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1077"></A><A HREF="#fn_1076"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Immediately after deposits, sale by another person than the owner has been declared by Bh<I>ri</I>gu; listen attentively, I will expound that subject thoroughly.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1078"></A><A HREF="#fn_1077"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> An open deposit, a bailment for delivery (Anv&acirc;hita), a Ny&acirc;sa (sealed) deposit, stolen property, a pledge, or what has been borrowed for use: when any one of these articles has been sold in secret by a man, he is declared a person different from the owner (asv&acirc;min).</p>  
<p>3.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1079"></A><A HREF="#fn_1078"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> When the vendor has been produced and has been cast in the suit, (the judge) shall cause him to pay the price and a fine to the buyer and king respectively, and to restore the property to the owner.</p>  
<p>4.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1080"></A><A HREF="#fn_1079"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> When the former owner comes forward and makes good his claim to the thing bought, the vendor shall be produced (by the purchaser); by doing so, the purchaser may clear himself.</p>  
<p>5.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1081"></A><A HREF="#fn_1080"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> That greedy man who covets another man's property, without having any claim to it, shall be compelled to pay twice the value (of the property claimed) as a fine, if he is unable to prove his claim.</p>  
<p>6.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1082"></A><A HREF="#fn_1081"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> When there is no evidence in a suit, the king shall consider the character of the parties and pass a decree himself, according to the equal, greater, or less (credibility of the parties).</p>  
<p>7.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1083"></A><A HREF="#fn_1082"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> When a purchase has been made before an assembly of merchants, the king's officers being aware of it (also), but from a vendor whose habitation is unknown; or when the purchaser has deceased:</p>

<p>paying half the price (tendered), the custom in that case being that one half of the value is lost to each of the two.</p>  
<p>9. A purchase from an unknown (vendor) is one fault (in that case); want of care in keeping it is another; these two faults are viewed by the wise as legitimate grounds of loss to each party.</p>  
<p>10.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1084"></A><A HREF="#fn_1083"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> When a man purchases (a commodity) at a fair price, and (the purchase) has been previously announced to the king, there is no wrong about it; but he who makes a fraudulent purchase is a thief.</p>  
<p>11. That should be known as a fraudulent purchase which is made at an unreasonably low price, in the interior of a house, outside of the village, at night, in secret, or from a dishonest person.</p>
