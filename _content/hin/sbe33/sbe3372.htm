<p>1.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1085"></A><A HREF="#fn_1084"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Trade or other occupations should not be carried on by prudent men jointly with incompetent or lazy persons, or with such as are afflicted by an illness, ill-fated, or destitute.</p>  
<p>2. A man should carry on business jointly with persons of noble parentage, clever, active, intelligent, familiar with coins, skilled in revenue and expenditure, honest, and enterprising.</p>

<p>joint stock) has been contributed by a partner, in the same proportion shall he defray charges, perform labour, and obtain profit.</p>  
<p>4.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1087"></A><A HREF="#fn_1086"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Of those who lend (jointly) gold, grain, liquids and condiments, or the like, the gain shall be equal to their respective shares (of the joint expenditure), whether equal, more, or less.</p>  
<p>5.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1088"></A><A HREF="#fn_1087"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Whatever property one partner may give (or lend), authorized by many, or whatever contract he may cause to be executed, all that is (considered as having been) done by all.</p>  
<p>6. They are themselves pronounced to be arbitrators and witnesses for one another in doubtful cases, and when a fraudulent act has been discovered, unless a (previous) feud should exist between them.</p>  
<p>7. When any one among them is found out to have practised deceit in a purchase or sale, he must be cleared by an oath (or ordeal); such is the rule in all disputes (of this sort).</p>  
<p>8.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1089"></A><A HREF="#fn_1088"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> When a loss or diminution has occurred through fate or the king, it is ordained that it should be borne by all (partners) in proportion to their respective shares.</p>  
<p>9.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1090"></A><A HREF="#fn_1089"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> When (a single partner acting) without the assent (of the other partners) or against their express instructions injures (their joint property)</p>

<p>through his negligence, he must by himself give a compensation to all his partners.</p>  
<p>10.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1091"></A><A HREF="#fn_1090"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> That (partner), on the other hand, who by his own efforts preserves (the common stock) from a danger apprehended through fate or the king, shall be allowed a tenth part of it (as a reward), the remainder being distributed among the other (partners), according to their shares (in the stock).</p>  
<p>11.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1092"></A><A HREF="#fn_1091"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> Should any such partner in trade happen to die through want of proper care, his goods must be shown (and delivered) to officers appointed by the king.</p>  
<p>12. And when any one comes forward claiming that man's property as heir (to the deceased partner), he shall prove his right to it by (the evidence of) other men, and then let him take it.</p>  
<p>13.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1093"></A><A HREF="#fn_1092"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> The king shall take a sixth, a ninth, and a twelfth part respectively from the property of a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra, Vai<I>s</I>ya, and Kshatriya; and a twentieth from the property of a Brahman.</p>  
<p>14. But after the lapse of three years, if no owner should come forward by any means, the king shall take that property; the wealth of a Brahman he shall bestow on (other) Brahmans.</p>  
<p>15.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1094"></A><A HREF="#fn_1093"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> So among (several) persons jointly performing a ceremony, if any one should meet with an accident, his (part of) the ceremony shall be performed by a kinsman of his, or by all his associates (in work).</p>

<p>17.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1096"></A><A HREF="#fn_1095"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> To a kinsman, relative, or friend one may lend money with a pledge (only); a loan to others must be guaranteed by a surety, or there must be a written contract or witnesses.</p>  
<p>18.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1097"></A><A HREF="#fn_1096"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> Gold or silver may be lent according to one's own choice; liquids and condiments, and grain, for a specified period only; it is by local custom that both the loan and its recovery should be regulated.</p>  
<p>19. That, however, which has been lent by several persons in common, must be recovered by them jointly; any (such lender) who fails to demand (the loan together with his partners) shall forfeit interest.</p>  
<p>20.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1098"></A><A HREF="#fn_1097"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> The law regarding loans has-been declared before, (therefore) it is referred to in an abridged form only in the present chapter. Listen to the legal rules regarding cultivators of the soil and other (associates in work), which are declared as follows.</p>  
<p>21. Tillage should be undertaken by a sensible</p>

<p>man jointly with those who are his equals in point of cattle, workmen, seeds, and the like, as well as implements of husbandry.</p>  
<p>22. They should refrain anxiously from cultivating an enclosed pasture-ground, land adjacent to a town, or to the king's highway, barren soil, and ground infested by mice.</p>  
<p>23. That man will enjoy produce who sows fertile land, which has many holes and is wet, capable of irrigation, surrounded by fields on all sides, and cultivated in due season.</p>  
<p>24. A sensible cultivator must not admit cattle which is lean, very old, tiny, diseased, apt to run away, blind of one eye, or lame.</p>  
<p>25. When by the deficiency of one (partner) as to cattle or seeds a loss happens in (the produce of) the field, it must be made good by him to all the husbandmen.</p>  
<p>26. This primeval set of rules has been declared for cultivators of the soil.</p>  
<p>27.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1099"></A><A HREF="#fn_1098"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> One able to work up gold, silver, thread, wood, stone, or leather, and acquainted with the articles to be manufactured (with such materials), is called <I>S</I>ilpin (an artizan or artist) by the wise.</p>  
<p>28. When goldsmiths or other (artists) practise their art jointly, they shall share the profits in due proportion, corresponding to the nature of their work.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_341"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 341</FONT></A></p>  
<p>29.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1100"></A><A HREF="#fn_1099"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> The headman among a number of workmen jointly building a house or temple, or digging a pool or making articles of leather, is entitled to a double share (of the remuneration).</p>  
<p>30.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1101"></A><A HREF="#fn_1100"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A> The same rule has been declared by virtuous men for musicians; he who knows how to beat the time shall take a share and a half, but the singers shall take equal shares.</p>  
<p>31.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1102"></A><A HREF="#fn_1101"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> When anything has been brought from a hostile country by freebooters, with the permission of their lord, they shall give a sixth part to the king and share (the remainder) in due proportion.</p>  
<p>32. Four shares shall be awarded to their chief; he who is (specially) valiant shall receive three shares; one (particularly) able shall take two; and the remaining associates shall share alike.</p>
