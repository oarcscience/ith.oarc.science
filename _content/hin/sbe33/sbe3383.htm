<p>36.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1251"></A><A HREF="#fn_1250"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A> Because a son (Putra) saves his father from the hell called Put by the very sight of his face, therefore should a man be anxious to beget a son.</p>  
<p>37.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1252"></A><A HREF="#fn_1251"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> Both a son's son and the son of an appointed daughter cause a man to attain heaven.

<p>38.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1253"></A><A HREF="#fn_1252"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A> Gautama has declared that a daughter is appointed after performing a sacrifice to Agni and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati; others have said that she is an appointed daughter (Putrik&acirc;) who was merely supposed to be one (before her birth) by a man having no male issue.</p>  
<p>39.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1254"></A><A HREF="#fn_1253"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A> The other sons, beginning with the son begotten on a wife (Kshetra<I>g</I>a), shall (respectively) take a fifth, a sixth, and a seventh part.</p>  
<p>40.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1255"></A><A HREF="#fn_1254"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A> The son given, the son cast off, the son bought, the son made (or adopted), the son by a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra wife: these, when pure by caste and irreproachable as to their conduct, are considered sons of middle rank.</p>  
<p>41. The son begotten on a wife (Kshetra<I>g</I>a) is despised by the virtuous; and so are the son begotten on a woman twice married, the son of an unmarried damsel, the son received with the wife, and the son secretly born.</p>  
<p>42.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1256"></A><A HREF="#fn_1255"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> Though born of a wife of the same caste, a son destitute of good qualities is unworthy to obtain the paternal wealth; it shall go to those learned (kinsmen) who offer the funeral ball of meal (Pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a) for the father.</p>

<p>and lowest debts; consequently there is no use of him who acts otherwise.</p>  
<p>44. What can be done with a cow which neither gives milk nor is (ever) pregnant? What is the good of a son being born who is neither learned nor virtuous?</p>  
<p>45. A son who is destitute of learning, valour, and wealth, void of devotion and insight, and unobservant of good custom, such a son is declared to be no better than urine and f&aelig;ces.</p>  
<p>46.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1257"></A><A HREF="#fn_1256"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A> In the revealed texts (of the Veda), in the traditional law (of the Sm<I>ri</I>tis), and in popular usage, the wife is declared to be half the body (of her husband), equally sharing the outcome of good and evil acts.</p>  
<p>47.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1258"></A><A HREF="#fn_1257"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A> Of him whose wife is not dead, half his body survives. How should any one else take the property, while half (his) body lives?</p>  
<p>48.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1259"></A><A HREF="#fn_1258"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> Although kinsmen (Sakulyas), although his father and mother, although uterine brothers be living, the wife of him who dies without leaving male issue shall succeed to his share.</p>  
<p>49. A wife deceased before (her husband) takes away his consecrated fire (Agnihotra); but if the husband dies before the wife, she takes his property, if she has been faithful to him. This is an eternal law.</p>

<p>his monthly, sixmonthly, and annual <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas to be performed.</p>  
<p>51. Let her propitiate with funeral oblations and pious liberality her husband's paternal uncles, Gurus, daughter's sons, sister's sons, and maternal uncles; also aged or helpless persons, guests, and women (belonging to the family).</p>  
<p>52. Should agnates (Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as) or cognates (B&acirc;ndhavas) or enemies injure the property, let the king inflict on them the punishment destined for a thief.</p>  
<p>53.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1260"></A><A HREF="#fn_1259"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A> The husband being separated (in interests from his former coparceners), his wife shall take after his death a pledge and whatever else is recognised as property, excepting the immovable wealth.</p>  
<p>54. A wife, though preserving her character and though partition have been made, is unworthy to obtain immovable property. Food or a portion of the arable land shall be given to her at will (for her support).</p>  
<p>55.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1261"></A><A HREF="#fn_1260"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A> The wife is declared to succeed to her husband's property, and in her default, the daughter.</p>  
<p>56.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1262"></A><A HREF="#fn_1261"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A> A daughter, like a son, springs from each member of a man; how then should any other mortal inherit the father's property while she lives?</p>  
<p>57. Equal in caste (to her father) and married to a man of the same caste as her own, virtuous, habitually submissive, she shall inherit her father's property, whether she may have been (expressly) appointed or not.</p>

<p>60.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1264"></A><A HREF="#fn_1263"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A> When a man dies leaving no issue, nor wife, nor brother, nor father, nor mother, all his Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as shall divide his property in due shares.</p>  
<p>61.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1265"></A><A HREF="#fn_1264"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> Half the entire wealth, however, shall first be set apart for the benefit of the deceased (owner) and carefully assigned for his monthly, sixmonthly, and annual <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas.</p>

<p>63.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1267"></A><A HREF="#fn_1266"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A> When a man dies without leaving either wife or male issue, the mother has to be considered as her son's heiress, or a brother (may succeed) if she consents to it.</p>  
<p>64.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1268"></A><A HREF="#fn_1267"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A> But on his death the mother shall take a son's share. The mothers shall share equally with the sons, the maidens shall take fourth-part shares.</p>
