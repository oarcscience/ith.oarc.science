<p>3.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1011"></A><A HREF="#fn_1010"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> An eightieth part (of the principal) accrues as interest on it (every month); and it is certainly doubled by such interest within a third of a year less than seven years (that is to say, within six years and eight months).</p>

<p>sorts; by others, it is stated to be fivefold; and by others again, it is said to be of six kinds. Learn their (various) qualities.</p>  
<p>5. K&acirc;yik&acirc; (bodily interest); k&acirc;lik&acirc; (periodical interest); <I>k</I>akrav<I>ri</I>ddhi (compound interest); k&acirc;rit&acirc; (stipulated interest); <I>s</I>ikh&acirc;v<I>ri</I>ddhi (hair-interest); and bhogal&acirc;bha (interest by enjoyment): such are the six kinds of interest.</p>  
<p>6.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1013"></A><A HREF="#fn_1012"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> K&acirc;yik&acirc; interest is connected with bodily labour; k&acirc;lik&acirc; is due every month; <I>k</I>akrav<I>ri</I>ddhi is interest on interest; k&acirc;rit&acirc; is interest promised by the borrower.</p>  
<p>7, 8. When interest is received every day, it is termed <I>s</I>ikh&acirc;v<I>ri</I>ddhi (hair-interest, because it grows every day). Because it grows constantly like hair, and does not cease growing except on the loss of the head, that is to say, on payment of the principal, therefore it is called hair-interest. The use of a (mortgaged) house, or the produce of a field, is termed bhogal&acirc;bha (interest by enjoyment).</p>  
<p>9.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1014"></A><A HREF="#fn_1013"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> That k&acirc;rit&acirc; (stipulated) interest has to be paid always, which has been stipulated by the debtor himself, over and above (the ordinary rate of interest), and has been promised in times of distress.</p>

<p>12.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1017"></A><A HREF="#fn_1016"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> But the use of a pledge after twice the principal has been realised from it, compound interest, and the exaction of the principal and interest (together as principal) is usury and reprehensible.</p>  
<p>13.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1018"></A><A HREF="#fn_1017"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> On gold (and other precious metals), the interest may make (the debt) double; on clothes and base metals (such as tin or lead), treble; on grain, it is allowed to rise to four times the original amount, and so on edible plants (or fruit), beasts of burden, and wool.</p>  
<p>14. It is allowed to make (the debt) quintuple, on pot-herbs; sextuple, on seeds and sugar-cane; and it may make (the debt) octuple, on salt, oil, and spirituous liquor.</p>  
<p>15. Likewise, on sugar and honey, if the loan be of old standing.</p>  
<p>16.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1019"></A><A HREF="#fn_1018"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> On grass, wood, bricks, thread, substances from which spirits may be extracted, leaves, bones, leather, weapons, flowers, and fruits, no interest is ordained.</p>

<p>be of four sorts; movable or immovable; to be kept only or to be used; to be released at any time, or limited as to time; stated in writing, or stipulated (orally) before witnesses.</p>  
<p>18.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1021"></A><A HREF="#fn_1020"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> Should the creditor, actuated by avarice, use a pledge before interest has ceased to accrue on the loan (on becoming equal to the principal), or before the fixed period has expired, such use shall be stopped.</p>  
<p>19. The pledge has to be kept carefully, like a deposit; interest is forfeited in case of its being damaged.</p>  
<p>20.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1022"></A><A HREF="#fn_1021"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> A pledge having been used and rendered worthless (by such use), the principal (itself) is lost; if a very valuable pledge be spoiled, he must satisfy the pledger.</p>  
<p>21.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1023"></A><A HREF="#fn_1022"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A> If a pledge be destroyed by a fatal accident or by an act of the king, the debtor shall be caused either to deliver another pledge or to pay the debt.</p>  
<p>22.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1024"></A><A HREF="#fn_1023"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A> When the debtor restores the principal and asks for his pledge, it must be restored to him; otherwise the creditor is liable to punishment.</p>

<p>23.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1025"></A><A HREF="#fn_1024"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> When a field or other (immovable property) has been enjoyed, and more than the principal realised by it, then the debtor shall recover his pledge, if the principal and interest has been actually got out of it (by the creditor).</p>  
<p>24. (This law applies) when the debtor delivers a field to the creditor, with the following stipulation, 'This (field) shall be enjoyed by you, when interest has ceased (on becoming equal to the principal), that is certain. When the principal has been realised together with the interest, you shall restore (the field) to me.'</p>  
<p>25.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1026"></A><A HREF="#fn_1025"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A> When the time (for payment) has passed and interest has ceased (on becoming equal to the principal), the creditor shall be owner of the pledge; but, till ten days have elapsed, the debtor is entitled to redeem it.</p>  
<p>26.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1027"></A><A HREF="#fn_1026"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A> Notice having been given to the debtor's family, a pledge to be kept (only) may be used, after the principal has been doubled; and so may a pledge for a fixed period, on the expiration of that term.</p>  
<p>27.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1028"></A><A HREF="#fn_1027"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> When the principal has been doubled, or the stipulated period expired in the case of a pledge delivered for a certain time only, the creditor</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A></p>  
<p>becomes owner of the pledge, after having waited for a fortnight.</p>  
<p>28. If the debtor should pay the debt during that interval, he may recover his pledge (even then).</p>  
<p>29.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1029"></A><A HREF="#fn_1028"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> When the amount of the debt has been doubled (by the interest accruing on it), and the debtor is either dead or no longer present, (the creditor) may take his chattel and sell it before witnesses.</p>  
<p>30. Or, its value having been estimated in an assembly, he may keep it for ten days; after which, having realised a sufficient sum to cover his demand, he should relinquish the balance.</p>  
<p>31.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1030"></A><A HREF="#fn_1029"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> When a man neither enjoys a pledge, nor obtains it (from the debtor), nor points it out (to others), his written contract (concerning the pledge) is invalid, (just like) a document when the (subscribing) witnesses and debtor are dead.</p>  
<p>32.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1031"></A><A HREF="#fn_1030"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A> When a house or field has been mortgaged for use and the period (fixed for such use) has not expired, the debtor cannot recover his property, nor can the creditor (recover) his loan.</p>  
<p>33. When the (stipulated) period has elapsed, both</p>

<p><A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A></p>  
<p>parties are at liberty to do so. But, even before (the stipulated period) has elapsed, they may make an arrangement by mutual consent.</p>  
<p>34.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1032"></A><A HREF="#fn_1031"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A> Where one field has been mortgaged to two creditors at the same time, it shall belong to that mortgagee who was the first to obtain possession of it.</p>  
<p>35.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1033"></A><A HREF="#fn_1032"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A> If both have possessed it for an equal time, it shall be held in common (or shared equally) by them. The same rule is ordained in the case of a gift or a sale.</p>  
<p>36.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1034"></A><A HREF="#fn_1033"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A> Which course should be adopted in cases of a competition between three different acts, the identical property having been sold, mortgaged, and given away on one and the same day?</p>  
<p>37. The three parties should divide that lawful property of theirs among themselves in proportionate shares, the two first in the ratio of their respective claims, whereas the donee ought to obtain a full third.</p>  
<p>38.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1035"></A><A HREF="#fn_1034"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A> The pledgee can never be compelled to restore the pledge against his will, before the whole amount due to him has been paid, nor must (the pledge be obtained from him) by deceit or by (the mode called) <I>K</I>arita.</p>

<p>40.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1037"></A><A HREF="#fn_1036"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A> The first says, 'I will produce (that man);' the second (says), 'He is a respectable man;' the third (says), 'I will pay the debt; the fourth (says), 'I will deliver his assets.'</p>

<p>57.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1053"></A><A HREF="#fn_1052"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A> When a debtor is fettered and conducted into (the creditor's) own house, where he is compelled to pay the debt by beating or other (forcible) means, it is called compulsion.</p>

The commentators agree <A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A> in explaining the term &acirc;dhi, 'a pledge,' as denoting a pledge to be used, such as e.g. a cow to be used with her milk, or landed property pledged together with its produce. The term bandha, 'a deposit,' is supposed to denote a pledge which must not be used; according to the May&ucirc;kha, however, it means a pledge which is not actually delivered to the creditor, the debtor merely promising not to alienate it. 'A pledge of adequate value' is one corresponding in value to the principal together with the interest. V&icirc;ram. p. 293. The term s&acirc;kshimat, 'attested,' is referred to a debt contracted orally before witnesses, both by Colebrooke (Dig. I, 1, 11) and Mandlik (May. loc. cit.). This, however, is opposed to the gloss of the V&icirc;ramitrodaya.</P>

It is hardly necessary to point out that the etymology here proposed of the term kus&icirc;da, 'a loan on interest,' is entirely fanciful. It is really derived from ku and s&icirc;da, and denotes 'that which adheres closely, and cannot easily be got rid of.'
