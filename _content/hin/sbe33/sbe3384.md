### XXVI. GAMBLING AND BETTING.

1. <span id="fr_1291"></span>[1](#fn_1290) Gambling has been prohibited
by Manu, because it destroys truth, honesty, and wealth. It has been
permitted by other (legislators) when conducted so as to allow the king
a share (of every stake).

2\. It shall take place under the superintendence of keepers of
gaming-houses, as it serves the purpose of discovering thieves. The same
rule has to be observed in bets on prize-fights with animals.

3. <span id="fr_1292"></span>[3](#fn_1291) When birds, rams, deer or
other (animals) are caused to fight against one another, after a wager
has been laid, it is called betting on animals (samâhvaya).

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

4. <span id="fr_1293"></span>[4](#fn_1292) When any one is defeated in a
prize-fight between two animals, the wager which has been laid shall be
paid by the owner of the (defeated) animal.

5\. A wager (or game) shall be made in public; false gamblers shall be
banished.

6. <span id="fr_1294"></span>[6](#fn_1293) When there is a point at
issue between the two parties (in a game or wager, other) gamblers shall
examine (and decide) the matter; if they are enemies (of either party),
the king shall decide the dispute.

7. <span id="fr_1295"></span>[7](#fn_1294) One defeated in a secret
game; or ignorant of the rules; or (defeated) by the use of false dice,
or by deceit, though acquainted with the game, shall be released; and
one who has lost his entire wealth in a game shall not be compelled to
give the whole of it.

8\. The keeper of the gaming-house shall receive the stakes and pay the
victorious gambler and the king; he shall also act as witness in a
dispute, assisted by three other gamblers.

9\. Those wicked men who use false dice in a game, or rob the king of
his due, or cheat by making false computations, are declared to be
gamblers deserving punishment.
