# SEVENTEENTH TITLE OF LAW.

##### GAMES.

\* 1. <span id="fr_639"></span>[1](#fn_639) Dishonest gambling with
dice, small slices of leather, little staves of ivory, or other (games),
and betting on birds, form (the subject of) a title of law called
(Gambling with Dice and Betting on Animals).

\* 2. <span id="fr_640"></span>[2](#fn_640) The master of the
gaming-house shall arrange

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

the game and pay the stakes which have been won; the profit of such a
conductor of games shall amount to ten per cent.

3. <span id="fr_641"></span>[3](#fn_641) When the dice on being thrown
fall twice in a game at dice, those acquainted with (playing at) dice
allot the victory to the adversary and the defeat to the gambler.

4. <span id="fr_642"></span>[4](#fn_642) When a dispute has arisen among
gamblers, let (other) gamblers be appealed to; they shall act both as
judges and as witnesses in a dispute of this sort.

5\. No gambler shall ever enter into another gaming-house before having
paid his debt; he must not disobey the master of the gaming-house, and
must pay of his own accord what he owes to him.

\* 6. <span id="fr_643"></span>[6](#fn_643) Wicked men who play with
false dice shall be driven out of the gaming-house, after a wreath of
dice has been hung round their necks; for that is the punishment
ordained for them.

7. <span id="fr_644"></span>[7](#fn_644) If a man gambles with dice,
without authorization from the king, he shall not get his stake, and
shall have to pay a fine.

\* 8. Or let the gamblers pay to the king the share

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

due to him and play in public, thus no wrong will be committed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_639"></span>[212:1](sbe3348.htm#fr_639) XVII, 1. The
translation is according to the Vîramitrodaya. The subject of bets on
animals is treated at great length in the Dhammathats of Burma, which
are based on the law-codes of India. 'Other games,' such as e.g.
*K*aturaṅga (Shatra*ñg*, the Indian chess). 'Birds,' such as pigeons,
also bets on professional wrestlers, rams, &c. Vîramitrodaya, p. 718.
Manu IX, 223.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[212:2](sbe3348.htm#fr_640) 'He shall pay the
stakes which have been won,' i.e. to the <span id="page_213">p.
213</span> winning party. That portion which has to be paid to the king
(see paragraph 8) may also be held to be included in this rule, as
B*ri*haspati says: 'Let the master of the gaming-house collect the
stakes and pay his due to the winning party and to the king.' Âpastamba
II, 10, 25, 12, 13; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 199, 200.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[213:3](sbe3348.htm#fr_641) The rendering of
the first portion of this paragraph is conjectural. It might also be
translated as follows: 'When the dice on being thrown fall twice
repeated,' i.e. when the number is twice as high as at the preceding
throw.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[213:4](sbe3348.htm#fr_642) Yâ*gñ*avalkya II,
202.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[213:6](sbe3348.htm#fr_643) Yâ*gñ*avalkya II,
202.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[213:7](sbe3348.htm#fr_644) 7, 8. Yâ*gñ*avalkya
II, 201, 203. Paragraphs 7 and 8 are omitted in the Nepalese MS.
