<p>6. When a piece of ground has been carried off by a stream, or abandoned (by the owner), or when the boundary marks have been destroyed, (they shall fix the boundary) according to the inference to be drawn from (an inspection of) the spot, and according to the traces of possession (held by the former owner).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_454"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_454">155:1</A> XI, 1. The meaning is as follows: 'A dike,' an embankment for the purposes of irrigation. 'A field,' a cultivated piece of ground (under water). 'A boundary,' a landmark. 'A tilled piece of ground,' cultivated soil. 'A waste,' uncultivated ground. When a decision has to be given in a quarrel with regard to any of these, it is called a lawsuit concerning landed property, or Boundary Dispute. V&icirc;ramitrodaya, p. 451.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_459"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_459">156:8</A> The lower degree of punishment in the case of the persons here mentioned seems to be due to the fact that they may be supposed to be interested in the suit.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_460"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_460">157:9</A> According to the V&icirc;ramitrodaya (p. 458), this prohibition in regard to the determination of the boundary by a single man, has reference to those only who are not acceptable to both parties and unacquainted with the law.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_461"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_461">157:10</A> Manu VIII, 256; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 152.</P>

He shall distribute the ground intermediate between the two villages, which has become the subject of a contest, between the two litigant parties, and fix landmarks between the two. V&icirc;ramitrodaya, p. 460. Manu VIII, 265; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 153.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_463"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_463">158:14</A> This rule seems to be intended principally for banyans and the like trees covering a large area with their offshoots. The Nepalese MS. omits vv. 13, 14, 16.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_464"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_464">158:15</A> The term syandanik&acirc; is variously explained as denoting either the projecting roof or the eaves of a house.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_466"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_466">158:18</A> Kheya means literally 'what is capable of being dug,' and bandhya 'what is capable of being stopped.' What is meant by these two terms may best be seen from the next paragraph.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_467"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_467">159:20</A> With the owner's permission, any man may restore a dike, &amp;c., which has fallen into decay. V&icirc;ramitrodaya, p. 468. Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 157. Read prav<I>ri</I>ttam in the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_468"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_468">159:21</A> The authority of the king is required, because, without it, the profits of the dike would have to be enjoyed by the king himself. <I>S</I>ee Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 157.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_469"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_469">159:22</A> The tertium comparationis in this simile has to be sought in the vanity of the effort only. Manu (IX, 73) applies the same simile to seed, i.e. semen virile spent in vain on the field, i.e. wife of a stranger.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_470"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_470">159:23</A> 'Unable' (to cultivate the field) through want of means. 'A field,' one which has become a desert. Viv&acirc;da<I>k</I>int&acirc;ma<I>n</I>i, p. 64.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_472"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_472">160:25</A> It appears from an analogous text of K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana that this rule is intended for those cases where the owner is unable to pay for the expense incurred by the cultivator. K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana says, 'If through want of means (the owner) do not repay the expense entailed by the cultivation of the waste, the cultivator shall be allowed to keep the produce minus an eighth part. During eight years he may keep the (annual) produce (minus an eighth). After that period, it shall belong, to the proprietor.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_473"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_473">160:26</A> These definitions are inserted here, because the previous rules according to the commentators apply to a desert or forest only, the cultivation of which causes considerable difficulty and expense.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_474"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_474">160:28</A> 28-42. N&acirc;rada's eleventh title of law, though called 'Boundary Disputes,' is in reality a collection of all legal rules relating to fields. Manu and those who follow him treat the subject of damage done by cattle to crops or grass as a section of the chapter on 'Disputes between master and herdsman,' which title of law is wanting in the N&acirc;rada-sm<I>ri</I>ti.</p>  
<p>28. Gautama XII, 20.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_475"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_475">161:29</A> The author of the V&icirc;ramitrodaya (p. 450) observes expressly that the term vadha denotes corporal punishment, and not execution, in this place. The other commentators agree with him. Manu VIII, 241; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 161; Gautama XII, 26; Vish<I>n</I>u V, 146. The Nepalese MS. omits this paragraph.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_479"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_479">162:33</A> The genuineness of this paragraph appears doubtful, because some of the propositions contained in it are nearly identical with the rules laid down in the paragraphs immediately preceding and following it. Besides, the language of this paragraph is obscure, and it is not given in any commentary nor in the Nepalese MS. The solemn ceremony of setting a bull at liberty and consecrating him to the gods, with a mark on each flank, is described by Vish<I>n</I>u, chapter LXXXVI, and in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras. Piercing the nostrils of a barren cow is mentioned as an offence by Manu VIII, 325. It does not become clear why damage done by a cow of this sort should be a greater offence than damage done by an ordinary cow.</P>

'When they remain,' when they spend the night in the field, after grazing. Viv&acirc;da<I>k</I>int&acirc;ma<I>n</I>i, <I>G</I>agann&acirc;tha, &amp;c. 'In the sight of the keeper:' thus according to <I>G</I>agann&acirc;tha (Colebrooke's Digest, III, 4, 46). The correctness of his interpretation is confirmed by Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 162. According to the Viv&acirc;da<I>k</I>int&acirc;ma<I>n</I>i (p. 67), the meaning is this, that the cattle are allowed to graze by the keeper, in the sight of the proprietor of the field, and in spite of the remonstrances of the latter. Vish<I>n</I>u V, 145; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 160, 162.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_484"></A><A HREF="sbe3343.htm#fr_484">163:39</A> The meaning of the injunction to give up the cows seems to be this, that the owner of the cows shall not at once recover them, when they have been seized by the proprietor of the field, after doing damage in the field. The Viv&acirc;da<I>k</I>int&acirc;ma<I>n</I>i has a different reading of this clause: gavatra<I>m</I> gomin&acirc; deya<I>m</I>. This is explained as meaning that 'blades of corn must be made good by the owner of cattle.' Similar readings are found in other commentaries as well. &Acirc;pastamba II, II, 28, 5.</P>
