<p>* 99.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">99</FONT></A> Let a money-lender take, in addition to the principal, the interest fixed by Vasish<I>th</I>a, viz. an eightieth part of a hundred in every month.</p>  
<p>* 100.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">100</FONT></A> Two, three, four, or five (in the hundred) is the legitimate (rate of interest). Let him take as much in the shape of interest, every month, in the direct order of the (four) castes.</p>  
<p>* 101.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">101</FONT></A> Or let him take two in the hundred, remembering the practice of the virtuous. By taking two in the hundred, he does not commit the crime of covetousness.</p>  
<p>* 102.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">102</FONT></A> Interest is declared fourfold in this law-book: periodical interest; stipulated interest; k&acirc;yik&acirc; interest; and compound interest.</p>

<p>periodical interest. That interest is termed stipulated interest which has been promised by the debtor himself.</p>  
<p>* 104. Interest at the rate of one Pa<I>n</I>a or quarter of a Pa<I>n</I>a, paid regularly without diminishing the principal, is denoted k&acirc;yik&acirc; interest. Interest upon interest is called compound interest.</p>  
<p>* 105.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">105</FONT></A> This is the general rule for interest to be paid on loans. There are special rules according to the local usages of the country where the loan has been made.</p>  
<p>* 106.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">106</FONT></A> In some countries the loan may grow till twice the amount of the principal has been reached. In other countries it may grow till it becomes three, or four, or eight times as large as the principal.</p>  
<p>107.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">107</FONT></A> The interest on gold, grain, and clothes may rise till it amounts to two, three, or four times the principal. On liquids, the interest may become octuple; of women and cattle, their offspring (is considered as the interest).</p>

<p>* 109.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="sbe3314.htm#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A> A loan made from friendship can never yield any interest, without being reclaimed by the creditor. If the debtor refuses to restore it on demand, it shall yield interest at the rate of five per cent.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_194"></A><A HREF="sbe3313.htm#fr_194">65:98</A> According to A., Sth&acirc;na, 'continued abode,' may be threefold: relating to the matter, as when profit arises from (the continuance of) victuals remaining well kept in a certain place; or relating to one's own abode, as when a dealer derives profit from business transactions in his own country; or relating to a different place, as when a dealer earns money through foreign trade.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_195"></A><A HREF="sbe3313.htm#fr_195">66:99</A> Identical with Manu VIII, 140. This rule, which fixes the rate of interest at 1&frac14; per cent. by the month, or 15 per cent. per annum, is actually found in the Dharmas&ucirc;tra of Vasish<I>th</I>a II, 51.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_196"></A><A HREF="sbe3313.htm#fr_196">66:100</A> Identical with Manu VIII, 142. The meaning is that he shall take 2 per cent. from a Brahman, 3 per cent. from a Kshatriya, 4 per cent. from a Vai<I>s</I>ya, and 5 per cent. from a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra. A. It appears, from the commentaries on the code of Manu, that the present rule is applicable in those cases where no security has been given, whereas the preceding paragraph refers to loans secured by a pledge.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_197"></A><A HREF="sbe3313.htm#fr_197">66:101</A> Identical with Manu VIII, 141. The meaning is that he shall take 2 per cent. only from honest men, to whatever caste they may belong. A. In the code of Manu, the present rule precedes par. 100, instead of following it. The author of the N&acirc;rada-sm<I>ri</I>ti would seem to have erroneously inverted the original position of the two verses.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_198"></A><A HREF="sbe3313.htm#fr_198">66:102</A> Manu VIII, 153; Gautama XII, 34, 35. See, too, Colebrooke's Digest I, XXXV-XLV.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_199"></A><A HREF="sbe3313.htm#fr_199">66:103</A> 103, 104. 'Periodical interest' means monthly interest, at the rate of from 2 to 5 per cent., according to the caste of the debtor. 'Stipulated interest' is interest at the rate of more than 10 per cent., which has been promised by the debtor himself in times of great distress. K&acirc;ya means principal. If a Pa<I>n</I>a, or quarter of a Pa<I>n</I>a, has to be <A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A> paid every day, without diminishing the principal, i.e. if the whole principal has to be restored, though ever so much interest may have been paid on it, it is called k&acirc;yik&acirc; interest. Where interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per mensem has been paid for twenty months, it will reach the same amount as the sum originally due, so that the principal is doubled. After twenty months more it becomes quadruple; twenty months later it becomes octuple, and so on. This is called compound interest. A. B<I>ri</I>haspati and Vy&acirc;sa derive the term k&acirc;yik&acirc; from k&acirc;ya 'a body,' and explain that it denotes bodily labour, or the use of a pledged slave.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_200"></A><A HREF="sbe3313.htm#fr_200">67:105</A> Where local customs obtain, differing from the rules previously given, they have to be followed. A.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_202"></A><A HREF="sbe3313.htm#fr_202">67:107</A> Gold borrowed at whatsoever rate of interest shall grow till it becomes double; grain, till it becomes treble; cloth, till it becomes <A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A> quadruple; liquids (and condiments), till they become octuple. The offspring of pledged females and cattle shall belong to the creditor. A.</P>
