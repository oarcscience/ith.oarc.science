<P><A NAME="fn_326"></A><A HREF="sbe3330.htm#fr_326">114:318</A> 318-326. The ordeal by poison consists of the swallowing of a mild poison by the defendant. He is innocent if he digests the poison without being affected by it. Vish<I>n</I>u XIII; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 110, 111.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_327"></A><A HREF="sbe3330.htm#fr_327">114:319</A> The autumn season, <I>S</I>arad, comprises the two months of &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina and K&acirc;rttika, or from middle of September to middle of November. The winter season comprises the two months of Aprah&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a and Pausha, or from middle of November to middle of January. Mitrami<I>s</I>ra, who quotes this text in the V&icirc;ramitrodaya, asserts that the term 'the winter season' must be taken in this place to include the dewy season, <I>S</I>i<I>s</I>ira, as well, i.e. the time from middle of January to middle of March.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_328"></A><A HREF="sbe3330.htm#fr_328">114:320</A> Though the season of <I>S</I>arad has been referred to in par. 319, it must be reckoned among the prohibited seasons according to par. 320. A. This observation seems to be just, because the performance of this ordeal in the <I>S</I>arad season is prohibited in par. 324 as well. Vasanta, the spring season, extends from middle of March to middle of May. Gr&icirc;shma, the hot season, extends from middle of May to middle of July. Varsh&acirc;, the season of the rains, extends from middle of July to middle of September.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_329"></A><A HREF="sbe3330.htm#fr_329">115:321</A> Spoiled, shaken, scented, and mixed poison should be avoided, because it has been changed from its natural state (into something different). K&acirc;lak&ucirc;<I>t</I>a and Al&acirc;bu poison should be avoided, because it is too strong. A. K&acirc;lak&ucirc;<I>t</I>a is a certain deadly poison contained in a bulbous root or tuber. According to a well-known myth, the K&acirc;lak&ucirc;<I>t</I>a poison was produced at the churning of the ocean, when it threatened to destroy the whole world, and was therefore swallowed by Siva. Al&acirc;bu is the bottle-gourd.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_330"></A><A HREF="sbe3330.htm#fr_330">115:323</A> There are 960 Yavas to a Pala. The fraction, therefore, is as follows:&#151;960 &#8729; 1/6 &#8729; 1/20 &#8729; &#8542; = 7 Yavas. In par. 324, the author says that seven or eight Yavas of poison should be given in winter, i.e. in that season when this ordeal is ordinarily administered. Vish<I>n</I>u lays down generally that seven Yavas of poison should be given.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_331"></A><A HREF="sbe3330.htm#fr_331">115:324</A> This rule shows that the prohibition which has been levelled in par. 320 against the performance of this ordeal in the rainy and summer seasons, must not be interpreted too strictly.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_332"></A><A HREF="sbe3330.htm#fr_332">115:325</A> This is the prayer which should be addressed to the poison. A.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_333"></A><A HREF="sbe3330.htm#fr_333">116:326</A> Here ends the chapter of the ordeal by poison. A.</P>
