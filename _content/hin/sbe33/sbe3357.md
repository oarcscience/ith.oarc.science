### VII. MISCELLANEOUS LAWS.

1. <span id="fr_828"></span>[1](#fn_827) (Because fathers desire
offspring, to be released from debt by their sons), therefore should a
son begotten (by his father) give up his own property and assiduously
redeem his father from debt, lest he should go to hell.

2. <span id="fr_829"></span>[2](#fn_828) The interest is unlimited on
thread, cotton, substances from which spirits may be extracted, tin,
lead, weapons of all sorts, skins, copper, iron,

3\. And all other articles of this kind, as well as bricks. This has
been declared by Manu Pra*g*âpati.

4\. On oil of every sort, on intoxicating drinks, on honey, on butter,
on sugar, and on salt, the interest shall cease when it reaches eight
times the original amount.

5. <span id="fr_830"></span>[5](#fn_829) The debts of sick, mad,
overaged, or long absent persons: such debts should be discharged by
their sons even while such persons are alive.

6. <span id="fr_831"></span>[6](#fn_830) A wife, a daughter-in-law, a
grandson's wife, and the presents bestowed on a wife (which constitute
her separate property): if a man takes any of these, he shall be made to
pay the debts (of such

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

women); and so shall he who lives on the landed property (of a
stranger).

7\. It is on the wife that the performance of religious acts depends in
all (four) castes, one after the other. He who takes the wife of a man,
takes his property (and debts) as well.

8. <span id="fr_832"></span>[8](#fn_831) Females are not entitled to
bestow gifts, or to sell property. It is only while she is living
together (with her family), that a woman may enjoy (the family
property).

9. <span id="fr_833"></span>[9](#fn_832) It is by permission (of the
owner) only that a female slave, cattle, or an estate may be enjoyed (by
a stranger). He who enjoys that which had not been given up to him (by
the owner), must pay for the (illegitimate) enjoyment of what he had
been enjoying.

10\. When a man forcibly enjoys property, such as a house, field, cow or
the like, without authorization (from the owner), he deserves the same
punishment as a thief.

11\. He who uses a bull, or a milch-cow, or a boat, or a female slave,
without authorization (from the owner), shall pay four Pa*n*as (as a
fine).

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

12\. A female slave, a boat, a beast of burden, and a pledge is not lost
(to the owner) by adverse possession. The possessor is bound to give a
compensation in money for his enjoyment of them.

13\. (Let him give) two Pa*n*as a day for the use of a female slave;
eight Pa*n*as for the use of a milch-cow; thirteen for the use of a
bull; sixteen for the use of a horse or of an estate.

14\. He who forcibly enjoys a boat, a horse, a milch-cow, or the plough
of an agriculturist, shall be made to pay eight times (their value) each
day.

15\. (For the use) of a mortar, half a Pa*n*a; for the use of a pestle,
two Pa*n*as; for the use of a winnowing basket, half a Pa*n*a. Thus has
the sage *G*aimini declared.

16. <span id="fr_834"></span>[16](#fn_833) A deposit which has been
entrusted to a. friend, is called a deposit based on confidence.

17\. Should a man, after entering the order of religious ascetics,
violate the duties of his order, the king should cause him to be branded
with a dog's foot and banish him quickly (from his realm).

18. <span id="fr_835"></span>[18](#fn_834) These two persons are (as
contemptible as) *K*a*nd*âlas for their acts, and should be kept
entirely apart from the world: one who has forsaken the order of
religious ascetics, and one who has entered an order prohibited in law.

19. <span id="fr_836"></span>[19](#fn_835) He is called Guru (a teacher)
who instructs his pupil, duly addressing him in Prâk*ri*t or
Sa*m*sk*ri*t, or employing a local or other dialect.

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

20. <span id="fr_837"></span>[20](#fn_836) When a quarrel has arisen
between prostitutes and the lovers frequenting their house, the
principal prostitutes and the lovers shall decide the dispute in common.

21. <span id="fr_838"></span>[21](#fn_837) If other persons (than the
neighbours) should give false evidence in a dispute concerning land,
such low persons shall be condemned to pay the first fine each in his
turn.

22. <span id="fr_839"></span>[22](#fn_838) A boundary is declared to be
of five sorts, as it may be either marked by signs (such as trees), or
by water (of a river), or by articles deposited underground, or subject
to no quarrel (being determined by consent of both parties), or fixed by
royal command.

23. <span id="fr_840"></span>[23](#fn_839) After having traced those
(robbers) with the aid of able spies acquainted with their habits, he
shall avoid frightening them, and shall cause them to be arrested by
officials secretly set upon them.

24. <span id="fr_841"></span>[24](#fn_840) It is not from the air, from
the sky, from the sea, or from other (such parts) that robbers will
come; therefore one should act thus.

25. <span id="fr_842"></span>[25](#fn_841) (The king) shall endeavour to
inveigle (thieves and robbers) through cunning spies who are anxious to
catch thieves. Other skilful and reliable persons also, artful talkers
and former thieves, shall (be appointed to) detect the thieves.

26\. By giving them wealth and valuable presents,

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

by causing them to attend at public shows and festivals, and by
pretending intended robberies, they shall cause (the thieves) to
assemble together.

27\. Those who fail to make their appearance on such occasions, though
skilful spies have been set on them, shall be arrested together with
their sons, kinsmen, and relatives.

28\. He shall then arrest the thieves after having convicted and enticed
them (to make their appearance), and shall inflict capital punishment on
them in various ways, after having proclaimed (their deeds) everywhere.

29\. Innocent persons also are seen to mingle with thieves
(occasionally); let not the king inflict punishments indiscriminately on
such.
