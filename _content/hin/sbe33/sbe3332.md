#### 25. The Rice Ordeal.

\* 337. <span id="fr_339"></span>[337](#fn_339) Now I will proclaim the
rule regarding the grains of rice which have to be chewed (by the
defendant). This rice ordeal should be administered in cases of larceny,
but on no other occasion whatsoever. That is the law.

\* 338. Let the judge, who must have cleansed himself previously, use
white grains of rice, but not (the grains) of any other fruit, and let
him place them in an earthen vessel in the sight of (an image of the
deity of) the sun.

339. <span id="fr_340"></span>[339](#fn_340) After having mixed them
with water in which (an image of the sun-god) has been bathed, he shall
leave them in that place for a night. At daybreak, after having prepared
them three times, a worshipper of the gods shall give them himself

340\. (To the defendant), who must be facing the east and must have
bathed and fasted, after having proclaimed the charge himself, in order
that right may be discerned from wrong.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

\* 341. When the defendant has chewed the grains, he shall cause him to
spit them on a leaf. If a leaf of the holy fig-tree be not available, he
shall take a leaf of the birch-tree (for that purpose).

\* 342. Should blood issue forth, or the tooth-flesh be hurt, or the
limbs shake, he must be pronounced guilty.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_339"></span>[118:337](sbe3332.htm#fr_339) 337-342. The rice
ordeal consists of chewing a number of grains of rice in the husk. If
the tooth-flesh is hurt and if blood issues forth, or if the man is seen
to be trembling during the proceeding, it is viewed as a proof of guilt.
Otherwise he is acquitted.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[118:339](sbe3332.htm#fr_340) Should the
reading be tri*h* k*ri*tva*h*, '(he shall give them) thrice?'
