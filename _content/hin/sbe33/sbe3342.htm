<p>* 1.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The aggregate of the rules settled amongst heretics, followers of the Veda (Naigamas) and others, is called Samaya (compact, or established usage). Thus arises a title of law, termed Transgression of a Compact.</p>  
<p>* 2.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Among heretics, followers of the Veda (Naigamas), guilds (of merchants), corporations (P&ucirc;gas), troops (of soldiers), assemblages (of kinsmen), and other (associations) the king must maintain the usages (settled among them), both in fortified towns and in the open country.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_447"></A><A HREF="sbe3342.htm#fr_447">153:1</A> X, 1. 'Heretics,' Kshapa<I>n</I>akas (Buddhist or Jain mendicants) and others who detract from the authority of the Veda. 'Naigamas,' traders or merchants. According to the Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc;, the term Naigama refers to P&acirc;<I>s</I>upatas and others who uphold the authority of the Veda. The term 'and others' is used to include corporations of learned Brahmans and other (associations). V&icirc;ramitrodaya, p. 423. The term samaya, literally 'compact,' denotes local or caste usages, the violation of which forms the subject of the tenth title of law.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_448"></A><A HREF="sbe3342.htm#fr_448">153:2</A> Of the term Naigama, the commentators give the same two different interpretations as in the preceding paragraph. I have referred it to 'followers of the Veda,' because it comes immediately after the term 'heretics.' The term p&ucirc;ga has three interpretations in this place. Some say it means 'companies of traders or others.' <A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A> Others say it denotes 'associations of persons differing in caste, whose mode of subsistence is not fixed.' The V&icirc;ramitrodaya interprets it as referring to riders on elephants, horses, &amp;c. In explanation of the terms vr&acirc;ta, 'a troop of soldiers,' and ga<I>n</I>a, 'an assemblage of kinsmen,' the commentators quote the following text of K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana: 'A multitude of united men armed with various weapons is called vr&acirc;ta. An assemblage of families is called ga<I>n</I>a.' Manu VIII, 41; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 192, &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_449"></A><A HREF="sbe3342.htm#fr_449">154:3</A> 'Their laws,' such as to speak the truth. 'Their (religious) duties,' such as the duty of going about begging alms when the night is over, early in the morning. 'The rules regarding their attendance,' the duty of attending, in a temple or other (public hall), for the affairs of the community, when the sound of a drum or other instrument is heard. V&icirc;ramitrodaya, p. 430. The Ratn&acirc;kara interprets the term karma, 'their (religious) duties,' by 'their proper occupation for a livelihood.' The drift of this rule, according to <A HREF="errata.htm#1"><I>G</I>agann&acirc;tha</A>, is this, that the king must not act otherwise than is consistent with the usages of castes or other corporations. See Colebrooke's Digest, III, 2, 11. Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 192, &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_450"></A><A HREF="sbe3342.htm#fr_450">154:4</A> 'Contemptible in their nature,' essentially despicable, such as the eating of betel, which is customary among heretics and others. 'Injurious to his interests,' causing pecuniary loss, &amp;c. 'He shall prevent them from undertaking such acts,' he shall act so that they do not undertake them. V&icirc;ramitrodaya, pp. 430, 431.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_451"></A><A HREF="sbe3342.htm#fr_451">154:5</A> 'Mixed assemblages,' meetings or gatherings of persons differing in caste. 'Unlawful wearing of arms,' wearing arms without sufficient motives, such as the apprehension of a danger. See Ratn&acirc;kara, as quoted in Colebrooke's Digest, III, 2, 25.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_452"></A><A HREF="sbe3342.htm#fr_452">155:6</A> 'An association,' a guild of merchants or other corporation. V&icirc;ramitrodaya, p. 430.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_453"></A><A HREF="sbe3342.htm#fr_453">155:7</A> When an act tainted with the sin of covetousness or another crime, and opposed to the dictates of revealed and traditional law, such as e.g. the prostitution of widows or other (virtuous females) among heretics or other (sinful men), has been attempted, the king must redress it, though it may have been practised for a long time. V&icirc;ramitrodaya, p. 431.</P>
