<p>343.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">343</FONT></A> Now I shall give a description of the ordeal of the hot piece of gold, which has been ordained by Brahman himself for the purpose of distinguishing virtue from vice.</p>  
<p>* 344. (The judge), after having cleansed himself, shall quickly pour clarified butter into a golden, silver, iron, or earthen vessel, and shall place the vessel on the fire.</p>  
<p>* 345. He shall throw into it a shining coin, made k of gold, silver, copper, or iron, after having washed it in water more than once.</p>  
<p>* 346.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">346</FONT></A> Should (the coin) ever drop into the boiling (mixture), it would be a very dangerous thing to touch him (the fire?). Therefore he must address the clarified butter with the following prayer:</p>  
<p>* 347. &#145;Thou art the best instrument of purification, O clarified butter, and (comparable to) Ambrosia</p>

<p>at a sacrifice. Burn this man at once if he is criminal, and be as cold as ice to him if he is innocent.&#146;</p>  
<p>* 348.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">348</FONT></A> If, on touching and examining the forefinger (of the defendant) it is found to be unhurt and to show no boils, he is innocent. Otherwise, he is not (innocent).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_341"></A><A HREF="sbe3333.htm#fr_341">119:343</A> 343-348. The ordeal of the hot piece of gold (Taptam&acirc;sha) derives its name from the gold coin (m&acirc;sha) or signet-ring (mudrik&acirc;), which those who are tried by this ordeal are required to pick out of a vessel filled with a boiling liquid, with the thumb and forefinger. They are declared innocent, if the hand remains unhurt.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_342"></A><A HREF="sbe3333.htm#fr_342">119:346</A> The reading of the first half of this paragraph is quite uncertain, and the above rendering conjectural.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_343"></A><A HREF="sbe3333.htm#fr_343">120:348</A> Some writers refer to two further ordeals, besides the seven kinds mentioned by N&acirc;rada. One of them is the ordeal of the red-hot ploughshare, which the defendant is made to lick. The other consists of drawing lots.</P>
