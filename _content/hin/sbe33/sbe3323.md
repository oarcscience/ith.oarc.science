accepted as correct,

whose veracity is not liable to suspicion. If the number of such
witnesses is equal (on both sides) (the testimony of these must be

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_281"></span>[95:229](sbe3323.htm#fr_281) Manu VIII, 73;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 78; Vish*n*u VIII, 39.

229, 230. Where witnesses endowed with a good memory are found on both
sides in equal numbers, evidence based on recollection is incapable of
influencing the decision of the suit. The witnesses must not be
examined, and the above rule comes into force, that the witnesses become
incompetent, because they do not agree with one another. A. See par.
261.
