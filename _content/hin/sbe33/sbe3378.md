### XX. DEFAMATION.

1. <span id="fr_1160"></span>[1](#fn_1159) Injury (pârushya) is declared
to be of two kinds, harsh speeches and beating; each of these two kinds
is again divided into three species, and the punishment is pronounced to
be threefold.

2. <span id="fr_1161"></span>[2](#fn_1160) Abuse of the first (or
lowest) degree means offensive language against, or defamation of, a
country, village, family, or the like, without (mentioning) an
(individual ignominious) act.

3\. Referring (in terms of contempt) to a man's sister or mother, or
charging him with a minor sin, is termed abuse of a middling sort by the
learned in law.

4\. Charging a man with taking forbidden food or drinks, or taxing him
with a mortal sin, or maliciously exposing his weakest points, is termed
abuse of the highest degree.

5. <span id="fr_1162"></span>[5](#fn_1161) When two persons abuse each
other, their punishment shall be equal, if they are equals in caste; if
one is inferior to the other, his punishment shall be double; for a
superior, half (of the ordinary punishment) is ordained.

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

6. <span id="fr_1163"></span>[6](#fn_1162) When persons equal in caste
and qualities abuse one another, the punishment ordained for them in the
system of law is thirteen Pa*n*as and a half.

7. <span id="fr_1164"></span>[7](#fn_1163) For a Brahman abusing a
Kshatriya, the fine shall be half of a hundred (fifty Pa*n*as); for
abusing a Vai*s*ya, half of fifty (twenty-five Pa*n*as); for abusing a
*S*ûdra, twelve and a half.

8\. This punishment has been declared for (abusing) a virtuous *S*ûdra
who has committed no wrong; no offence is imputable to a Brahman for
abusing (a *S*ûdra) devoid of virtue.

9\. A Vai*s*ya shall be fined a hundred (Pa*n*as) for reviling a
Kshatriya; a Kshatriya reviling a Vai*s*ya shall have to pay half of
that amount as a fine.

10\. In the case of a Kshatriya reviling a *S*ûdra, the fine shall be
twenty Pa*n*as; in the case of a Vai*s*ya, the double amount is declared
to be the proper fine by persons learned in law.

11\. A *S*ûdra shall be compelled to pay the first fine for abusing a
Vai*s*ya; the middling fine (for abusing) a Kshatriya; and the highest
fine (for abusing) a Brahman.

12. <span id="fr_1165"></span>[12](#fn_1164) (A *S*ûdra) teaching the
precepts of religion, or uttering the words of the Veda, or insulting a
Brahman, shall be punished by cutting out his tongue.

13. <span id="fr_1166"></span>[13](#fn_1165) (A man) reviling a sister
or other (relation) of

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

another person shall give a fine amounting to fifty Pa*n*as.

14. <span id="fr_1167"></span>[14](#fn_1166) He who reviles a person's
native country or other (belongings of his), shall be fined twelve
Pa*n*as and a half. He who through arrogance imputes an offence to him,
shall be compelled to pay the first fine.

15\. This gradation of fines has been declared by me, subject to
modification by the sages, in conformity with the (particular caste or
qualities of a) man, so as either to remain as declared, or to be
reduced or raised.
