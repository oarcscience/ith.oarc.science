The subject of bets on animals is treated at great length in the Dhammathats of Burma, which are based on the law-codes of India. 'Other games,' such as e.g. <I>K</I>atura&#7749;ga (Shatra<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>, the Indian chess). 'Birds,' such as pigeons, also bets on professional wrestlers, rams, &amp;c.
