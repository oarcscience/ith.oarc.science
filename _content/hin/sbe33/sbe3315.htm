<P><A NAME="fn_212"></A><A HREF="sbe3315.htm#fr_212">70:117</A> A surety and a pledge are the two sorts of guarantee for a loan on interest. Documents and witnesses are the two kinds of evidence for each of the four elements, which have to be distinguished in the law of debt, viz. the principal, the interest, the surety, and the pledge. A.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_213"></A><A HREF="sbe3315.htm#fr_213">70:118</A> A surety for appearance is where the debtor denies the debt, and is asked to prove his denial in a court. In that case, he must produce a man, who becomes surety for the debtor's appearance at the time of the trial. A surety for payment is where the creditor, anxious to obtain a loan, produces one or several sureties, who are either jointly or severally bound. A surety for honesty is where the debtor denies having received a certain sum, or declares that he has restored it to the creditor, and is required thereupon to produce a surety for his veracity. A. Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 53; Vish<I>n</I>u VI, 41.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_214"></A><A HREF="sbe3315.htm#fr_214">70:119</A> This paragraph is intended to show that the surety for appearance and the surety for honesty are equally responsible as the <A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A> surety for payment. A. Manu VIII, 158-160; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 53; Vish<I>n</I>u VI, 41.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_215"></A><A HREF="sbe3315.htm#fr_215">71:120</A> Where a number of sureties have promised each to pay a certain stipulated share of the debt, in case of the debtor's inability to discharge it himself, the liability of each surety does not extend beyond what has been promised by him. Where, however, all the sureties have declared their joint liability for the whole debt, the creditor may enforce payment from any one among them whom he thinks able to satisfy his demand. A. Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 55; Vish<I>n</I>u VI, 42.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_216"></A><A HREF="sbe3315.htm#fr_216">71:121</A> When, however, the surety, anxious to obtain twice the amount of the sum for which he has given security, should pay the sum to the creditor of his own accord, without being pressed to do so by the creditor, the debtor shall pay that sum only to him, and not the double sum. A. Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 56; Vish<I>n</I>u VI, 43.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_217"></A><A HREF="sbe3315.htm#fr_217">71:122</A> Identical with Manu VIII, 49. According to Asah&acirc;ya, four out of the five modes of recovery of a debt are equivalent to the traditional four means of obtaining success, viz. conciliation, division (bheda), presents, and violence. Thus, 'the mode consonant with religion' means conciliation, i.e. gentle remonstrances. If these should prove of no avail, 'legal proceedings,' or 'division' (bheda), shall be resorted to, i.e. the debtor shall be threatened with a plaint in a court of justice. After that, 'presents' or 'fraud' should be adhibited, i.e. a false hope of fictitious gain shall be held out to the debtor. If this mode also should prove unsuccessful, 'force' or 'violence' <A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A> may be used, by fettering the debtor, or confining him, &amp;c. The fifth mode, called the customary mode (&acirc;<I>k</I>arita), consists of fasting. If the creditor himself, or his son, or his servant, takes to fasting it is no offence; or he may confine his own son or threaten to kill him, or seize the property of a stranger, as a compensation. The commentators of the Code of Manu explain the five modes of recovery of a debt much in the same way as Asah&acirc;ya. 'Fraud,' according to them, is when the creditor borrows money from the debtor under false pretences, or retains a deposit belonging to him. Vyavah&acirc;ra, generally interpreted by 'legal proceedings,' means, according to Medh&acirc;tithi, engaging the debtor in agriculture, trade, or other work, and 'taking the proceeds of his labour.' The 'customary mode' (&acirc;<I>k</I>arita) is variously explained as denoting 'fasting,' or 'killing' or 'taking (one's own or the debtor's) family and cattle.' Under the former interpretation, it is identical with the well-known 'sitting in Dharna.' See the translations of Manu, and Jolly, Ind. Schuldrecht, &sect; 7. For an interesting parallel to the custom of Dharna from the Brehon Laws of Ancient Ireland, see Sir H. Maine's Early History of Institutions, p. 297 foll.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_218"></A><A HREF="sbe3315.htm#fr_218">72:123</A> A dishonest debtor who applies to the king for protection against a creditor enforcing his demand shall not be abetted by the king. 'For secular reasons,' i.e. in order not to disturb the established order of society. 'For religious reasons,' i.e. in order not to offend against religious law. A. Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 50. Vish<I>n</I>u VI, 19; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 40.</P>
