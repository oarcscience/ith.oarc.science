<p>* 1. Where traders or others carry on business jointly, it is called Partnership, which is a title of law.</p>  
<p>* 2.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Where several partners are jointly carrying on business for the purpose of gain, the contribution of funds towards the common stock of the association forms the basis (of their undertakings). Therefore let each contribute his proper share.</p>  
<p>* 3.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> The loss, expenses, and profit of each partner are either equal to those of the other partners, or exceed them, or remain below them, according as his share is equal to theirs, or greater, or less.</p>  
<p>* 4.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> The stores, the food, the charges (for tolls and the like), the loss, the freight, and the expense of keeping valuables must be duly paid for by each of the several partners, in accordance with the terms of their agreements.</p>

<p>lost by his want of care, or in consequence of his acting against the instructions of, or without authorization from, all the other coparceners.</p>  
<p>* 6.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> Where the property of the partnership is in danger through fate, through a gang of robbers, or through the king, the tenth part of the goods shall belong to him who has preserved them through his own exertion.</p>  
<p>* 7.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> Should one partner meet with an accident, his heir shall replace him; or on failure of an heir, another man, or all (the partners) if they are capable (of becoming his substitute).</p>  
<p>* 8.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> In the sane way, where an officiating priest has met with an accident, another (priest) shall officiate for him, and receive from him his part of the fee to the stipulated amount.</p>

<p>who is no offender and free from guilt, or where (a sacrificer) forsakes a faultless priest, they shall both be punished.</p>  
<p>* 10. There are three sorts of officiating priests: one honoured by previous generations, one appointed by (the sacrificer) himself, and one who performs the functions of a priest of his own accord through friendship.</p>  
<p>* 11.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> This law applies to hereditary and self-chosen priests. But it is no sin to abandon a priest officiating of his own accord.</p>  
<p>* 12.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_367"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> A trader on reaching a toll-house should pay the legal duty. A prudent man must not try to evade it, (because) it is called the (king's) tax.</p>  
<p>* 13.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> If he evades a toll-house, or if he buys or sells at another than the legal hour, or if he does not state the value (of his goods) correctly, he shall be fined eight times the amount which he tried to evade.</p>

<p>15.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> The alms received by Brahmans, the property of stage players, and what is capable of being carried on one's back; on all that he must raise no duty.</p>  
<p>* 16. If a travelling merchant who has come into his country should die there, the king shall preserve his goods till the heir comes forward.</p>  
<p>* 17. On failure of an heir, he must make them over to his relatives or connexions. On failure of them, he shall keep them well guarded for a period of ten years.</p>  
<p>* 18.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> When such property without an owner, and which is not claimed by an heir, has been preserved for ten years, the king may keep it for himself. Thus the sacred law will not be violated.</p>
