<P><A NAME="fn_564"></A><A HREF="sbe3345.htm#fr_564">188:1</A> XIII, 1. The term 'sons' includes by implication grandsons and <A NAME="page_189"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 189</FONT></A> more remote descendants. The term 'paternal' includes property of the grandfather and more remote ancestors as well. Mandlik's May&ucirc;kha, p. 33 (IV, 3, 1, Borrodaile). Analogous remarks are found in most other Commentaries.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_565"></A><A HREF="sbe3345.htm#fr_565">189:2</A> 'Their issue' (tadanvaya<I>h</I>). According to the usual explanation, the male issue of the daughters is meant. However, there is nothing in the text to warrant an exclusion of the female issue of daughters. Manu IX, 104, 192; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 117; Gautama XXVIII, 1; Baudh&acirc;yana II, 3, 8.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_566"></A><A HREF="sbe3345.htm#fr_566">189:3</A> According to the May&ucirc;kha, the clause 'when the sisters are married' has to be construed with both the preceding and following clauses, the marriage of the sisters being required to precede both a division in the father's lifetime and a division in the mother's lifetime. See May&ucirc;kha, p. 33 (translation, p. 39). The D&acirc;yabh&acirc;ga has a totally different reading of this text, which is censured in the V&icirc;ramitrodaya. Gautama XXVIII, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_567"></A><A HREF="sbe3345.htm#fr_567">189:4</A> The D&acirc;yabh&acirc;ga (II, 82, Colebrooke) states correctly that the unequal distribution referred to in the last clause of this text must be different from that sort of unequal distribution under which the eldest son is to receive a larger share than the rest. The Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc; school, on the other hand, recognises two different modes of <A NAME="page_190"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 190</FONT></A> distribution only: one equal, and the other with the customary deductions in favour of the eldest son, middlemost son, &amp;c., according to the order of seniority. The writers of this school, therefore, have endeavoured to refute the interpretation of the D&acirc;yabh&acirc;ga. See V&icirc;ramitrodaya, transl., p. 54.&#151;Manu IX, 112 foll.; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 114; &Acirc;pastamba II, 6, 14; Gautama XXVIII, 2; Vish<I>n</I>u XVII, 1; Baudh&acirc;yana II, 3, 9.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_568"></A><A HREF="sbe3345.htm#fr_568">190:5</A> As the management of the property and government of the family, under this rule, may devolve on the youngest brother even, it follows that the middlemost brother may get it &agrave; fortiori. This is expressly stated in the D&acirc;yabh&acirc;ga (III, 1, 15, Colebrooke). Manu IX, 108.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_569"></A><A HREF="sbe3345.htm#fr_569">190:6</A> 'What was received at the time of obtaining a wife is here called the "wealth of a wife;" meaning effects obtained on account of marriage.'

As all the other gifts classed as Str&icirc;dhana are presented by relations, it may be inferred that the nuptial gifts have to come from the same quarter. K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana declares expressly that a gift made by a stranger is not Str&icirc;dhana. Manu IX, 194; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 143, 144; Vish<I>n</I>u XVII, 18.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_571"></A><A HREF="sbe3345.htm#fr_571">191:9</A> See XII, 38 foll. The commentators are of opinion that the G&acirc;ndharva form of marriage follows the same rule as those four forms which are referred to in the first half of this text. This, however, is an artificial interpretation, which has merely been devised for the purpose of making this text agree with an analogous rule of Manu (IX, 196). Manu IX, 195-197; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya II, 144, 145; Vish<I>n</I>u XVII, 19-21; Vasish<I>th</I>a XVII, 46; Baudh&acirc;yana II, 2, 3, 43.

This difference of interpretation is connected with the varying views taken in the several schools of law of the extent of the patria potestas in questions of proprietary right and inheritance.

They add, however, that in doing so he must be guided by lawful motives, such as compassion on an incapable son, partiality for a pious son, and the like. See D&acirc;yabh&acirc;ga II, 74, 75 Colebrooke's Digest, V, 1, 32. The May&ucirc;kha, on the other hand, declares that this rule of N&acirc;rada had legal force in the former ages of the world only.

Colebrooke's D&acirc;yabh&acirc;ga II, 83. The Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc; (I, 2, 13, 54), cutting down the privileges of the father everywhere, interprets this rule as a prohibition of any other mode of unequal distribution except that by which the customary deductions are made in favour of the eldest son, &amp;c.</P>

<p>21. The commentators are at variance as to the precise meaning of the term 'hostile to his father.' Thus the Sarasvat&icirc;vil&acirc;sa declares it to denote one who forgets himself so far as to say, 'He is not my father.' The D&acirc;yakramasa&#7749;graha says it means one who beats his father. According to <I>G</I>agann&acirc;tha and the Ratn&acirc;kara, it means 'one who attempts his father's life or commits other hostile acts against him (m&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc;dik<I>ri</I>t), and who fails to offer the customary funeral oblations to his father after his death.'

The 'son of two fathers' is no doubt one procreated by Niyoga on the wife of one impotent, &amp;c. It is not equally clear why he is to obtain one half only of the property left by his two fathers, as he is elsewhere declared to succeed to both. According to the Ratn&acirc;kara, this rule 'relates to the case where the natural father has a son begotten in lawful wedlock, and the husband of the mother also has by some means (katha<I>m</I><I>k</I>it) obtained male issue by himself begotten.'

The fact that the widow is invested with a claim to maintenance merely under this text, whereas the leading texts of Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya and Vish<I>n</I>u constitute her heir to the property of a husband who has died without leaving male issue, has caused some difficulty to the commentators. Thus Madana says that this text must be held applicable to the widow of an undivided or reunited coparcener only, who is given a mere claim to maintenance by all writers of the Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc; school. The writers of the Bengal school, on the other hand, recognise the widow's right of inheritance in the case of undivided coparceners even. It appears, however, from the order of heirs given in 49-51, that N&acirc;rada does not make the widow an heir in any case.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_594"></A><A HREF="sbe3345.htm#fr_594">198:35</A> Some commentators explain this text as having reference to one who generously declines to take his share at the time of partition. His share shall be made up afterwards by the other brothers contributing severally a portion of their shares. However, there seems to be more foundation for the opinion of those commentators who interpret this text as ordaining the allotment of a preferential share or the presentation of special gifts to the manager of the family property.

This interpretation has been called forth, no doubt, by the fact that, in the opinion of these commentators, the inheritance of one sonless belongs to the widow in the first instance, and does not go to others, where a legitimate widow is in existence.</P>
