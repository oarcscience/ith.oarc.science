Stand thou firmly, secure by<br> Law Supreme, and do not totter. Nor be thy Lord of<br> Sacrifice unsteady.<br> 3 Thou art the strainer, hundred-streamed, of Vasu. Thou<br> art the strainer, thousand-streamed, of Vasu.<br> May Savitar the God with Vasu's strainer, thousand-streamed,<br> rightly cleansing, purify thee.<br> 4 Which didst thou milk? This is the cow Visv&acirc;yu. This<br> Visvakarman. This is Visvadh&acirc;yas.<br> Thee, Indra's share, with Soma do I curdle. Be thou protector<br> of the oblation, Vishnu.<br> 5 I will observe the vow, Lord of Vows, Agni! May I have<br> strength therefor. Success attend me.<br> Now into truth from untruth do I enter.<br> 6 Who is it that unites thee? He unites thee. For what<br> doth he yoke thee? For that he yokes thee.<br> You two for work, you two for its completion.</p>
