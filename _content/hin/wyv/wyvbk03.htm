Ether! Sky!<br> Like heaven in plenty and like earth in compass! Upon thy<br> back, Earth, place of sacrificing to Gods, for gain of food<br> I lay food-eating Agni.<br> 6 This spotted Bull hath come and sat before the Mother and<br> before<br> The Father, mounting up to heaven.</p>

Song is bestowed<br> upon the Bird<br> Throughout the days at break of morn.<br> 9 Agni is light, and light is Agni. Hail!<br> S&ucirc;rya is light, and light is S&ucirc;rya. Hail!<br> Agni is splendour, light is splendour. Hail!<br> S&ucirc;rya is splendour, light is splendour. Hail!<br> Light is S&ucirc;rya, S&ucirc;rya is light. Hail!<br> 10 Accordant with bright Savitar and Night with Indra at her<br> side,<br> May Agni, being pleased, enjoy. All-hail!<br> 11 Approaching sacrifice, may we pronounce a text to Agni<br> who<br> Heareth us even when afar.<br> 12 Agni is head and height of heaven, the Master of the earth<br> is he:<br> He quickeneth the waters&#146; seed.<br> 13 You two will I invoke, O Indra-Agni, will please you both<br> together with oblation.<br> Givers, you twain, of vigorous strength and riches, you<br> twain do I invoke for gain of vigour.<br> 14 This is thine ordered place of birth whence, sprung to life,<br> thou shonest forth.<br> Knowing this, Agni, rise thou up and cause our riches to<br> increase.<br> 15 Here by ordainers was this God appointed first Invoker,<br> best at worship, to be praised at rites,<br> Whom Apnav&acirc;na and the Bhrigus caused to shine, bright-coloured<br> in the wood, spreading to every house.</p>

<p>I, bearing strength, intelligent and happy, come to thee,<br> House, rejoicing in my spirit.<br> 42 The home on which the wanderer thinks, where cheerfulness<br> and joy abound<br> We call the Home to welcome us. May it know us who<br> know it well.<br> 43 Here have the cows been called to us, the goats and sheep<br> have been called near,<br> And in our home we have addressed the meath that sweeteneth<br> our food.<br> I come to thee for safety and for quiet. May joy be ours,<br> felicity, and blessing.<br> 44 We invocate the Maruts, the voracious, eaters of their foes,<br> Delighting in their mess of meal.<br> 45 We expiate by sacrifice each sinful act that we have done,<br> Whether in village or the wild, in company or corporeal<br> sense. Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!<br> 46 Let us not here contend with Gods, O Indra, for, Fierce<br> One! here is thine own sacred portion,<br> Thine, Mighty One, whose friends, the bounteous Maruts,<br> his song who pours oblation, streamlike, honours.<br> 47 The skilful workers have performed their work with voice<br> that gives delight.<br> Having performed the work for Gods, go, ye companions, to<br> your home.<br> 48 O ever-moving Cleansing Bath, thou movest gliding on thy<br> way.</p>

<p>With Gods may I wash out the sin that I have sinned<br> against the Gods, with men the sin against mankind.<br> Preserve me safe from injury, O God, from him who loudly<br> roars.<br> 49 Full, fly away, O spoon, and filled completely fly thou back<br> to us.<br> O Satakratu, let us twain barter, like goods, our food and<br> strength.<br> 50 Give me, I give thee gifts: bestow on me, and I bestow on<br> thee.<br> To me present thy merchandize, and I to thee will give my<br> wares.<br> 51 Well have they eaten and regaled: the friends have risen<br> and passed away.<br> The sages, luminous in themselves, have praised thee with<br> their latest hymn.<br> Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.<br> 52 Thee will we reverence, thee, O Lord of Bounty, who art<br> fair to see.<br> Thus praised, according to our wish come now with richly-laden<br> car. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.<br> 53 We call the spirit hither with a hero-celebrating strain,<br> Yea, with the Fathers&#146; holy hymns.<br> 54 The spirit comes to us again for wisdom, energy, and life,<br> That we may long behold the Sun.<br> 55 O Fathers, may the Heavenly Folk give us the spirit once<br> again,<br> That we may be with those who live.</p>

<p>56 O Soma, with the spirit still within us, blest with progeny,<br> May we be busied in thy law.<br> 57 O Rudra, this is thine allotted portion. With Ambik&acirc; thy<br> sister kindly take it. This, Rudra, is thy share, the rat<br> thy victim.<br> 58 We have contented Rudra, yea, put off Tryambaka the God,<br> That he may make us wealthier, may make us yet more<br> prosperous, may make us vigorous to act.<br> 59 Thou art a healing medicine, a balm for cow and horse and<br> man, a happiness to ram and ewe.<br> 60 Tryambaka we worship, sweet augmenter of prosperity.<br> As from its stem a cucumber, may I be freed from bonds of<br> death, not reft of immortality.<br> We worship him, Tryambaka, the husband-finder, sweet to<br> smell.<br> As from its stem a cucumber, hence and not thence may I<br> be loosed.<br> 61 This, Rudra, is thy food: with this depart beyond the<br> M&ucirc;jav&acirc;ns.<br> With bow unstrung, with <A HREF="errata.htm#1">muffled</A> staff, clothed in a garment<br> made of skin, gracious, not harming us, depart.<br> 62 May Jamadagni's triple life, the triple life of Kasyapa,<br> The triple life of Deities&#151;may that same triple life be ours.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>63 Gracious, thy name; the thunder is thy father. Obeisance<br> be to thee: forbear to harm me.<br> I shave thee for long life, for food to feed thee, for progeny,<br> for riches in abundance, for noble children, for heroic<br> vigour.</p>
