<p>BY impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,<br> with the hands of P&ucirc;shan. Thou art a woman. Here<br> I cut the necks of R&acirc;kshasas away. Barley art thou.<br> Bar off from us our haters, bar our enemies.<br> Thee for heaven, thee for earth, thee for the welkin. Pure<br> be the worlds, the Fathers&#146; dwelling-places. Thou art the<br> habitation of the Fathers.<br> 2 Thou art a leader, easy, to Unnetars, of access. Know<br> this. It will stand upon thee.<br> Savitar, God, anoint thee with sweet butter. Thee for the<br> plants laden with goodly fruitage!<br> Thou with thy top hast touched the sky, hast with thy<br> middle filled the air, and steadied with thy base the earth.<br> 3 Those seats of thine which we desire to visit, where there<br> are many-horned and nimble. oxen,<br> There, of a truth, was mightily imprinted the loftiest step<br> of widely-striding Vishnu.<br> I close thee in, the winner of the Br&acirc;hmans, winner of<br> Nobles and abundant riches.<br> Strengthen the Br&acirc;hmans, strengthen thou the Nobles,<br> strengthen our vital power, strengthen our offspring.<br> 4 Look ye on Vishnu's works, whereby the Friend of Indra,<br> close-allied,<br> Hath let his holy ways be seen.</p>

<p>5 The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where<br> Vishnu is,<br> Laid as it were an eye in heaven.<br> 6 Thou art invested. Heavenly hosts invest thee! Riches of<br> men invest this Sacrificer!<br> Heaven's son art thou. This is thine earthly station. Thine<br> is the beast whose home is in the forest.<br> 7 Encourager art thou. The hosts of heaven have come to<br> yearning Gods, the best conductors.<br> God Tvashtar, make the wealth of cattle quiet. Delightful<br> to the taste be thine oblations.<br> 8 Joy, wealthy ones! Brihaspati, save our riches.<br> I bind thee with the noose of holy Order, thou offering to<br> the Gods. Bold be the Slayer.<br> 9 By impulse of God Savitar I bind thee, with arms of Asvins<br> and with hands of P&ucirc;shan, thee welcome unto Agni and<br> to Soma.<br> Thee for the waters, thee for plants. Thy mother grant<br> thee permission, and thy father, brother born of one dam,<br> thy friend, thy herd-companion. I sprinkle thee welcome<br> to Agni-Soma.<br> 10 Drinker art thou of water. May the Waters, the Goddesses,<br> add sweetness to the oblation prepared for Gods, even<br> though already sweetened.</p>

<p>Thy breath join wind, thy limbs those meet for worship, the<br> sacrifice's lord the boon he prays for.<br> 11 Balmed, both of you, with butter, guard the cattle. Grant,<br> Rich! the Sacrificer's prayer. Approach thou.<br> Meeting with heavenly Wind, from air's mid-region. Be<br> thou united with this offering's body.<br> O Great One, lead the sacrifice's master on to a sacrifice of<br> loftier order. All-hail to Gods! To Gods All-hail!<br> 12 Become no serpent, thou, become no viper. To thee,<br> O widely-spread, be adoration.<br> Advance, unhindered, on thy way. To rivers of butter<br> move along the paths of Order.<br> 13 Bear the oblation to the Gods, ye Waters celestial and pure<br> and well-provided. May we become providers well-provided.<br> 14 I cleanse thy voice, thy breath, thine eye, thine ear, thy<br> navel, and thy feet, thy sexual organ, and thy rump.<br> 15 Let thy mind, voice, and breath increase in fulness, thine<br> eye be fuller, and thine ear grow stronger.<br> Whatever there is in thee sore or wounded, may that be<br> filled for thee, cleansed and united.<br> Blest be the days. Plant, guard! Axe, do not harm him.<br> 16 Thou art the demons&#146; share. Expelled are demons. Here<br> I tread down; here I repel the demons; here lead the<br> demons into lowest darkness.</p>

<p>Invest, ye two, the heaven and earth with fatness.<br> O V&acirc;yu, eagerly enjoy the droppings. Let Agni eagerly<br> enjoy the butter. All-hail!<br> Go, both of you, by Sv&acirc;h&acirc; consecrated, to &Ucirc;rdhvanabhas,<br> offspring of the Maruts.<br> 17 Ye Waters, wash away this stain and whatsoever taint be here,<br> Each sinful act that I have done, and every harmless curse<br> of mine.<br> May Waters rid me of that guilt, and Pavam&acirc;na set me free.<br> 18 Be they united, with the Mind thy mind, and with the Breath<br> thy breath.<br> Thou quiverest. Let Agni make thee ready. Waters have<br> washed together all thy juices.<br> Thee for the Wind's rush, for the speed of P&ucirc;shan. From<br> heated vapour may it reel and totter,&#151;the disconcerted<br> hatred of our foemen.<br> 19 Ye drinkers-up of fatness, drink the fatness; drink up the<br> gravy, drinkers of the gravy! Thou art the oblation of the<br> air's mid-region. All-hail!<br> The regions, the fore-regions, the by-regions, the intermediate<br> and the upper regions,&#151;to all the regions Hail!<br> 20 In every limb is Indra's out-breath seated, in every limb is<br> Indra's in-breath settled.<br> God Tvashtar, let thine ample forms be blended, that what<br> wears different shapes may be one-fashioned.<br> To please thee let thy friends, mother and father, joy over<br> thee as to the Gods thou goest.</p>

Take thou strength.<br> Ye two Bowls, being firm, stay firm, and take ye strength.<br> Mishap&#151;not Soma&#151;hath been killed.<br> 36 East, west, north, south, from every side to meet thee let<br> the regions run.<br> Fill him, O Mother, let the noble meet together.<br> 37 Thou, verily, O Mightiest, as God shalt gladden mortal man.<br> O Bounteous Lord, there is no comforter but thou.
