### BOOK THE SIXTEENTH.

HOMAGE be paid unto thy wrath, O Rudra, homage to thy  
shaft: to thy two arms be homage paid.  
2 With that auspicious form of thine, mild, Rudra! pleasant  
to behold,  
Even with that most blessèd form, look, Mountain-haunter!  
here on us.  
3 The shaft which, Mountain-haunter, thou art holding in  
thy hand to shoot,  
Make that auspicious, Mountain-Lord! Injure not man nor  
moving thing.  
4 O Dweller on the Mountain, we salute thee with auspicious  
hymn;  
That all, yea, all our people may be healthy and well-satisfied.  
5 The Advocate, the first divine Physician, hath defended us.  
Crushing all serpents, drive away all Yâtudhânis down below.  
6 That most auspicious One whose hue is coppery and red  
and brown,  
And those, the Rudras who maintain their station in the  
regions, who surround him in a thousand bands, of these  
we deprecate the wrath.  
7 May he who glides away, whose neck is azure, and whose  
hue is red,  
He whom the herdsmen, whom the girls who carry water  
have beheld, may he when seen be kind to us.  
8 Homage to him the Azure-nested, the thousand-eyed, the  
bountiful,  
Yea, and his spirit ministers—to them I offer reverence.

9 Loosen thy bowstring, loosen it from thy bow's two  
extremities,  
And cast away, O Lord Divine, the arrows that are in thy  
hand.  
10 Now stringless be Kapardin's bow, his quiver hold no pointed  
shaft.  
The shafts he had have perished and the sheath that held  
his sword is bare.  
11 Thy weapon, O Most Bountiful, the bow that resteth in thy  
hand,—  
With that, deprived of power to harm, protect thou us on  
every side.  
12 So may the arrow of thy bow, in all directions, pass us by,  
And in a place remote from us lay thou the quiver that thou  
hast.  
13 Having unbent thy how O thou hundred-eyed, hundred-quivered  
One!  
And dulled thy pointed arrows' heads, be kind and gracious  
unto us.  
14 To thy fierce weapon, now unstrung, be reverent obeisance  
paid.  
Homage be paid to both thine arms, and to thy bow be  
reverence!  
15 Do thou no injury to great or small of us, harm not the  
growing boy, harm not the full grown man.  
Slay not a sire among us, slay no mother here, and to our  
own dear bodies, Rudra! do no harm.  
16 Harm us not in our seed or in our progeny, harm us not in  
our life or in our cows or steeds.  
Slay not our heroes in the fury of their wrath. We with  
oblations ever call on only thee.  
17 Homage to the golden-armed leader of hosts, lord of the  
1 regions, to the trees with their green tresses, to the Lord  
of beasts be homage; homage to him whose sheen is like  
green grass, homage to the radiant Lord of paths, homage
