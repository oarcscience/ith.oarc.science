<p>THAT which, divine, mounts far when man is waking, that<br> which returns to him when he is sleeping,<br> The lights&#146; one light that goeth to a distance, may that,<br> my mind, be moved by right intention.<br> 2 Whereby the wise and thoughtful in assemblies, active in<br> sacrifice, perform their duties,<br> The peerless spirit stored in living creatures, may that, my<br> mind, be moved by right intention.<br> 3 That which is wisdom, intellect, and firmness, immortal light<br> which creatures have within them,<br> That without which men do no single action, may that, my<br> mind, be moved by right intention.<br> 4 Whereby, immortal, all is comprehended, the world which is,<br> and what shall be hereafter,<br> Whereby spreads sacrifice with seven Hotars, may that, my<br> mind, be moved by right intention.<br> 5 Wherein the Richas, S&acirc;mans, Yajur-verses, like spokes within<br> a car's nave, are included,<br> And all the thought of creatures is inwoven, may that, my<br> mind, be moved by right intention.<br> 6 Controlling men, as, with the reins that guide them, a skilful<br> charioteer drives fleet-foot horses,<br> Which dwells within the heart, agile, most rapid, may that,<br> my mind, be moved by right intention.<br> 7 Now will I glorify great strength's upholder, Food,<br> By whose invigorating might Trita rent Vritra limb from limb.</p>

<p>God Savitar the gold-eyed hath come hither, giving choice<br> treasures to the man who worships.<br> 25 Savitar, golden-handed, swiftly moving, goes on his way<br> between the earth and heaven,<br> Drives away sickness, bids the Sun approach us, and spreads<br> the bright sky through the darksome region.<br> 26 May, he, gold-handed Asura, kind leader, come hitherward<br> to us with help and favour.<br> Driving off R&acirc;kshasas and Y&acirc;tudh&acirc;nas, the God is present,<br> praised in hymns at evening.<br> 27 O Savitar, thine ancient dustless pathways are well established<br> in the air's mid-region.<br> O God, come by those paths so fair to travel: preserve thou<br> us from harm this day and bless us.<br> 28 Drink our libations, Asvins twain, grant us protection, both<br> of you,<br> With aids which none may interrupt.<br> 29 Make ye our speech effectual, O Asvins, and this our hymn,<br> ye mighty Wonder-workers.<br> In luckless game I call on you for succour: strengthen us<br> also on the field of battle.<br> 30 With undiminished blessings, O ye Asvins, through days and<br> nights on every side protect us.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuna grant, and Mitra, and Aditi<br> and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.<br> 31 Throughout the dusky firmament, etc., as in XXXIII. 43.<br> 32 Night! the terrestrial realm hath been filled with the<br> Father's power and might.<br> Thou spreadest thee on high unto the seats of heaven: terrific<br> darkness cometh nigh.</p>

Preserve<br> us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>

<p>41 Secure in thy protecting care, O P&ucirc;shan, never may we fail:<br> We here are singers of thy praise.<br> 42 I praise with eloquence hire who guards all pathways. He,<br> when his love impelled him, went to Arka.<br> May he vouchsafe us gear with gold to grace it: may P&ucirc;shan<br> make each prayer of ours effective.<br> 43 Vishnu the undeceivable Protector strode three steps, thenceforth<br> Establishing his high decrees.<br> 44 This, Vishnu's station most sublime, the singers ever vigilant.<br> Lovers of holy song, light up.<br> 45 Filled full of fatness, compassing all things that be, wide,<br> spacious, dropping meath, beautiful in their form,<br> The Heaven and the Earth by Varuna's decree, unwasting,<br> rich in seed, stand parted each from each.<br> 46 Let those who are our foemen stand afar from us: with<br> Indra and with Agni we will drive them off.<br> Vasus, &Acirc;dityas, Rudras have exalted me, made me pre&euml;minent,<br> mighty, thinker, sovran lord.<br> 47 Come, O N&acirc;satyas, with the thrice eleven Gods: come,<br> O ye Asvins, to the drinking of the meath.<br> Prolong our days of life, and wipe out all our sins: ward off<br> our enemies; be with us evermore.<br> 48 May this your praise, may this your song, O Maruts, sung<br> by the poet, M&acirc;na's son, M&acirc;nd&acirc;rya,</p>

<p>Bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us. May we<br> find strengthening food in full abundance.<br> 49 They who were versed in ritual and metre, in hymns and<br> rules, were the Seven godlike Rishis.<br> Viewing the path of those of old, the sages have taken up<br> the reins like chariot-drivers.<br> 50 Bestowing splendour, length of life, increase of wealth, and<br> conquering power,<br> This brightly shining gold shall be attached to me for victory.<br> 51 This gold no demons injure, no Pis&acirc;chas; for this is might<br> of Gods, their primal offspring.<br> Whoever wears the gold of Daksha's children lives a long life<br> among the Gods, lives a long life among mankind.<br> 52 This ornament of gold which Daksha's children bound, with<br> benevolent thoughts, on Sat&acirc;n&icirc;ka,<br> I bind on me for life through hundred autumns, that I may<br> live till ripe old age o&#146;ertakes me.<br> 53 Let Ahibudhnya also hear our calling, and Aja-Ekap&acirc;d and<br> Earth and Ocean.</p>

<p>All Gods Law-strengtheners, invoked and lauded, and Texts<br> recited by the sages, help us!<br> 54 These hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever<br> offer to the Kings &Acirc;dityas.<br> May Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varuna,<br> Daksha, and Amsa.<br> 55 Seven Rishis are established in the body: seven guard it<br> evermore with care unceasing.<br> Seven waters seek the world of him who lies asleep: two<br> sleepless Gods are feast-fellows of him who wakes.<br> 56 O Brahmanaspati, arise. God-fearing men, we pray to thee.<br> May they who give good gifts, the Maruts, come to us. Indra,<br> be thou most swift with them.<br> 57 Now Brahmanaspati speaks forth aloud the solemn hymn<br> of praise.<br> Wherein Indra and Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, the Gods have<br> made their dwelling-place.<br> 58 O Brahmanaspati, be thou controller of this our hymn, and<br> prosper thou our children.<br> All that the Gods regard with love is bless&egrave;d. Loud may<br> we speak, with brave sons, in assembly.<br> He who sate down. Mighty in mind. Father who made us.<br> A share of good, O Lord of Food.</p>
