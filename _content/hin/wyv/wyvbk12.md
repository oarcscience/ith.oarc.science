### BOOK THE TWELFTH.

FAR hath he shone abroad like gold to look on, beaming  
imperishable life for glory.  
Agni by vital powers became immortal when his prolific  
Father Dyaus begat him.  
2 Night and Dawn, different in hue, accordant, meeting  
together, suckle one same infant.  
Golden between the heaven and earth he shineth. The  
wealth-possessing Gods supported Agni.  
3 The Sapient One arrays himself in every form: for quadruped  
and biped he hath brought forth good.  
Excellent Savitar hath looked on heaven's high vault: he  
shineth after the outgoings of the Dawn.  
4 Thou art the goodly-pinioned Bird: thou hast the Trivrit for  
thy head.  
Gâyatra is thine eye, thy wings are Brihat and Rathantara.  
The hymn is self, the metres are his limbs, the formulas his  
name.  
The Vâmadevya Sâman is thy form, the Yajñâyajñiya thy  
tail, the fire-hearths are thy hooves.  
Thou art the goodly-pinioned Bird: go skyward, soar to  
heavenly light.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

5 Thou art the riyal-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount the  
Gâyatra metre: stride along the earth.  
Thou art the foe-destroying stride of Vishnu. Mount the  
Trishtup metre: stride along mid-air.  
Thou art the traitor-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount the  
Jagatî metre: stride along the sky.  
Thou art the foeman-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount  
Anushtup metre: stride along the Quarters.  
6 Agni roared out like Dyaus what time he thunders: licking  
full oft the earth round plants he flickered.  
At once, when born, he looked about, enkindled: he shineth  
forth between the earth and heaven.  
7 Return to me, thou still-returning Agni, with life, with  
lustre, progeny, and treasure,  
With profit, wisdom, riches, and abundance.  
8 A hundred, Agni Angiras! be thy ways, a thousand thy  
returns.  
With increment of increase bring thou back to us what we  
have lost. Again bring hitherward our wealth.  
9 Return again with nourishment; Agni, again with food and  
life. Again preserve us from distress.  
10 Agni, return with store of wealth. Swell with thine overflowing  
stream that feedeth all on every side.  
11 I brought thee: thou hast entered in. Stand stedfast and  
immovable.  
Lot all the people long for thee. Let not thy kingship fall  
away.  
12 Varuna, from the upmost bond release us, let down the  
lowest and remove the midmost.  
So in thy holy law may we made sinless belong to Aditi, O  
thou Âditya.

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

13 High hath the Mighty risen before the Mornings, and come  
to us with light from out the darkness.  
Fair-shapen Agni with white-shining splendour hath filled  
at birth all human habitations.  
14 The Hamsa homed in light, the Vasu in mid-air, the Priest  
beside the altar, Guest within the house,  
Dweller in noblest place, mid men, in truth, in sky, born  
of flood, kine, truth, mountain, he is holy Law. The Great.  
15 Knowing all holy ordinances, Agni, be seated in the lap of  
this thy mother.  
Do not with heat or glowing flame consume her: shine thou  
within her with refulgent lustre.  
16 Within this Fire-pan with thy light, O Agni, in thy proper seat,  
Glowing with warmth, be gracious thou, O Jâtavedas, unto her.  
17 Being propitious unto me, O Agni, sit propitiously.  
Having made all the regions blest, in thine own dwelling  
seat thyself.  
18 First Agni sprang to life from out of heaven, the second  
time from us came Jâtavedas.  
Thirdly the Manly-souled was in the waters. The pious  
lauds and kindles him Eternal.  
19 Agni, we know thy three powers in three stations, we know  
thy forms in many a place divided.  
We know what name supreme thou hast in secret: we know  
the source from which thou hast proceeded.  
20 The Manly-souled lit thee in sea and waters, Man's Viewer  
lit thee in the breast of heaven.  
There as thou stoodest in the third high region the Bulls  
increased thee in the waters’ bosom.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

21 Agni roared out, etc. (verse 6 repeated).  
22 The spring of glories and support of riches, rouser of  
thoughts and guardian of the Soma,  
Good Son of Strength, a King amid the waters, in forefront  
of the Dawns he shines enkindled.  
23 Germ of the world, ensign of all creation, he sprang to life  
and filled the earth and heaven.  
Even the firm rock he cleft when passing over, when the  
Five Tribes brought sacrifice to Agni.  
24 So among mortals was immortal Agni stablished as cleansing,  
wise, and eager envoy.  
He waves the red smoke that he lifts above him, striving  
to reach the heaven with radiant lustre.  
25 Far hath he shone, etc. (verse 1 repeated).  
26 Whoso this day, O God whose flames are lovely, makes thee  
a cake, O Agni, mixed with butter,  
Lead thou and further him to higher fortune, to bliss bestowed  
by Gods, O thou Most Youthful.  
27 Endow him, Agni, with a share of glory, at every, song of  
praise sung forth enrich him.  
Dear let him be to Sûrya, dear to Agni, preëminent with son  
and children's children.  
28 While, Agni, day by day men pay thee worship they win  
themselves all treasures worth the wishing.  
Allied with thee, eager and craving riches, they have disclosed  
the stable filled with cattle.  
29 Agni, man's gracious Friend, the Soma's keeper, Vaisvânara,  
hath been lauded by the Rishis.  
We will invoke benignant Earth and Heaven: ye Deities,  
give us wealth with hero children.  
30 Pay service unto Agni with your fuel, rouse your Guest  
with oil:  
In him present your offerings.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

31 May all the Gods, O Agni, bear thee upward with their earnest  
thoughts:  
Not to be looked on, rich in light, be thou propitious unto us,  
32 Agni, go forth resplendent, thou with thine auspicious flames  
of fire.  
Shining with mighty beams of light harm not my people  
with thy form.  
33 Agni roared out, etc. (verse 21 repeated.)  
34 Far famed is this the Bharata's own Agni: he shineth like  
the Sun with lofty splendour.  
He who hath vanquished Pûru in the battle, the heavenly  
Guest hath shone for us benignly.  
35 Receive these ashes, ye celestial Waters, and lay them in a  
fair place full of fragrance.  
To him bow down the nobly-wedded Matrons! Bear this on  
waters as her son a mother.  
36 Agni, thy home is in the floods: into the plants thou forcest  
way,  
And as their child art born anew.  
37 Thou art the offspring of the plants, thou art the offspring  
of the trees:  
The offspring thou of all that is, thou, Agni, art the Waters’  
Child,  
38 With ashes having reached the womb, the waters, Agni  
and the earth,  
United with the mothers, thou blazing hast seated thee again.  
39 Seated again upon thy seat, the waters, Agni! and the earth,  
In her, thou, most auspicious One, liest as in a mother's lap

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

40, 41 Return again, etc. Agni, return, etc. (verses 9 and 10  
repeated).  
42 Mark this my speech, Divine One, thou Most Youthful,  
offered to thee by him who gives most freely:  
One hates thee, and another sings thy praises. I thine  
adorer laud thy form, O Agni.  
43 Be thou for us a liberal Prince, Giver and Lord of precious  
things.  
Drive those who hate us far away.  
To the Omnific One All-hail!  
14 Again let the Âdityas, Rudras, Yams, and Brahmans with  
their rites light thee, Wealth-bringer!  
Increase thy body with presented butter: effectual be the  
Sacrificer's wishes.  
45 Go hence, depart, creep off in all directions, both ancient  
visitors and recent comers:  
Yama hath given a place on earth to rest in. This place  
for him the Fathers have provided.  
46 Knowledge art thou: accomplishment of wishes. In me be  
the fulfilment of thy wishes.  
Thou art the ashes, thou the mould of Agni. Rankers are  
ye, rankers around. Rankers right upward, be ye fixed.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

47 This is that Agni where the longing Indra took the pressed  
Soma deep within his body.  
Winner of spoils in thousands like a courser, with prayer art  
thou exalted, Jâtavedas.  
48 The splendour which is thine in heaven, O Agni, in earth, O  
Holy One, in plants, in waters,  
Wherewith thou hast o’erspread mid-air's broad region, that  
light is brilliant, billowy, man-surveying.  
49 O Agni, to the flood of heaven thou mountest, thou tallest  
hither Gods, the thought-inspirers.  
The waters, those beyond the light of Sûrya, and those  
that are beneath it here, approach thee.  
50 May the Purîshya Agnis in accord with those that spring  
from floods,  
May they, benevolent, accept the sacrifice, full, wholesome  
draughts.  
51 As holy food, Agni, to thine invoker give wealth in cattle,  
lasting, rich in marvels.  
To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this  
thy gracious will to us-ward.  
52 This is thine ordered place of birth whence, sprung to life,  
thou shonest forth.  
Knowing this, Agni, mount on high and cause our riches to  
increase.  
53 Ranker art thou: Angiras-like sit steady with that Deity.  
Ranker-round art thou: Angiras-like sit steady with that  
Deity.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

54 Fill up the room, supply the void, then settle steady in thy  
place.  
Indr-Âgni and Brihaspati have set thee down in this abode.  
55 The dappled kine who stream with milk prepare his draught  
of Soma juice—  
Clans in the birthplace of the Gods, in the three luminous  
realms of heaven.  
56 All sacred songs have magnified Indra expansive as the sea,  
The best of warriors borne on cars, the Lord, the very Lord  
of Strength.  
57 Combine ye two and harmonize together, dear to each other,  
brilliant, friendly-minded,  
Abiding in one place for food and vigour.  
58 Together have I brought your minds, your ordinances, and  
your thoughts.  
Be thou our Sovran Lord, Agni Purîshya; give food and  
vigour to the Sacrificer.  
59 Thou art Purîshya Agni, thou art wealthy, thou art prosperous.  
Having made all the regions blest, here seat thee in thine  
own abode.  
60 Be ye one-minded unto us, both of one thought, free from  
deceit.  
Harm not the sacrifice, harm not the Patron of the sacrifice.  
Be gracious unto us to-day, ye knowers of all things that be.  
61 Even as a mother bears her son, Earth, Ukhâ hath borne  
within her womb Purîshya Agni.  
Maker of all, accordant with the All-Gods and Seasons, may  
Prajâpati release her.  
62 Seek him who pours not, offers not oblation; follow the  
going of the thief and robber.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

This is thy way; leave us and seek some other. To thee,  
O Goddess Nirriti, be homage.  
63 To thee, sharp-pointed Nirriti, full homage! Loose and  
detach this iron bond that binds him.  
Unanimous with Yama and with Yamî to the sublimest  
vault of heaven uplift him.  
64 Thou, Awful One, thou in whose mouth I offer for the unloosing  
of these binding fetters,  
Whom people hail as Earth with their glad voices, as Nirriti  
in every place I know thee.  
65 The binding noose which Nirriti the Goddess hath fastened  
on thy neck that none may loose it,  
I loose for thee as from the midst of Âyus. Sped forward  
now, eat thou the food we offer:  
To Fortune, her who hath done this, be homage.  
66 Establisher, the gatherer of treasures, he looks with might  
on every form and figure.  
Like Savitar the God whose laws are constant, like Indra,  
he hath stood where meet the pathways.  
67 Wise, through desire of bliss with Gods, the skilful bind the  
traces fast, and lay the yokes on either side.  
68 Lay on the yokes and fasten well the traces; formed is the  
furrow sow the seed within it.  
Through song may we find hearing fraught with plenty:  
near to the ripened grain approach the sickle.

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

69 Happily let the shares turn up the ploughland, happily go  
the ploughers with the oxen!  
Suna and Sîra, pleased with our oblation, cause ye our  
plants to bear abundant fruitage.  
70 Approved by Visvedevas and by Maruts, balmed be the  
furrow with sweet-flavoured fatness.  
Succulent, teeming with thy milky treasure, turn hitherward  
to us with milk, O Furrow.  
71 The keen-shared plough that bringeth bliss, good for the  
Soma-drinker's need,  
Shear out for me a cow, a sheep, a rapid drawer of the car,  
a blooming woman, plump and strong!  
72 Milk out their wish, O Wishing-Cow, to Mitra and to Varuna,  
To Indra, to the Asvins, to Pûshan, to people and to plants.  
73 Be loosed, inviolable, Godward-farers! We have attained  
the limit of this darkness: we have won the light.  
71 The year together with the darksome fortnights; Dawn with  
the ruddy-coloured cows about her; the Asvins with  
their wonderful achievements; the Sun together with his  
dappled Courser; Vaisvânara with Idâ and with butter.  
Svâhâ!  
75 Herbs that sprang up in time of old, three ages earlier than  
the Gods,—  
Of these, whose hue is brown, will I declare the hundred  
powers and seven.

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

76 Ye, Mothers, have a hundred homes, yea, and a thousand are  
your growths.  
Do ye who have a thousand powers free this my patient from  
disease.  
77 Be glad and joyful in the Plants, both blossoming and bearing  
fruit,  
Plants that will lead us to success like mares who conquer in  
the race.  
78 Plants, by this name I speak to you, Mothers, to you the  
Goddesses:  
Steed, cow, and garment may I win, win back thy very self,  
O man.  
79 The Holy Fig tree is your home, your mansion is the Parna  
tree:  
Winners of cattle shall ye be if ye regain for me this man.  
80 He who hath store of Herbs at hand like Kings amid a crowd  
of men,—  
Physician is that sage's name, fiend-slayer, chaser of disease.  
81 Herbs rich in Soma, rich in steeds, in nourishment in strengthening  
power,  
All these have I provided here, that this man may be whole  
again.  
82 The healing virtues of the Plants stream forth like cattle  
from the stall,—  
Plants that shall win me store of wealth, and save thy vital  
breath, O man.  
83 Reliever is your mother's name, and hence Restorers are ye  
called.  
Rivers are ye with wings that fly: keep far whatever brings  
disease.  
84 Over all fences have they passed, as steals a thief into the fold.  
The Plants have driven from the frame whatever malady was  
there.  
85 When, bringing back the vanished strength, I hold these herbs  
within my hand,  
The spirit of disease departs ere he can seize upon the life.  
86 He through whose frame, O Plants, ye creep member by  
member, joint by joint,  
From him ye drive away disease like some strong arbiter of  
strife.  
87 Fly, Spirit of Disease, begone, with the blue jay and kingfisher.  
Fly, with the wind's impetuous speed, vanish together with  
the storm.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

88 Help every one the other, lend assistance each of you to  
each,  
All of you be accordant, give furtherance to this speech of  
mine.  
89 Let fruitful Plants, and fruitless, those that blossom, and  
the blossomless,  
Urged onward by Brihaspati, release us from our pain and  
grief;  
90 [Release](errata.htm#4) me from the curse's plague and woe that comes
from  
Varuna;  
Free me from Yama's fetter, from sin and offence against the  
Gods.  
91 What time, descending from the sky, the Plants flew earthward,  
thus they spake:  
No evil shall befall the man whom while he liveth we  
pervade.  
92 Of all the many Plants whose King is Soma, Plants of hundred  
forms,  
Thou art the Plant most excellent, prompt to the wish, sweet  
to the heart.  
93 O all ye various Herbs whose King is Soma, that o’erspread  
the earth,  
Urged onward by Brihaspati, combine your virtue in this  
Plant.  
94 All Plants that hear this speech, and those that have  
departed far away,  
Come all assembled and confer your healing power upon  
this Herb.  
95 Unharmed be he who digs you up, unharmed the man for  
whom I dig:  
And let no malady attack biped or quadruped of ours.  
96 With Soma as their Sovran Lord the Plants hold colloquy  
and say:  
O King, we save from death the man whose cure a Brâhman  
undertakes.  
97 Most excellent of all art thou, O Plant: thy vassals are the  
trees.  
Let him be subject to our power, the man who seeks to  
injure us.  
98 Banisher of catarrh art thou, of tumours and of hemorrhoids;  
Thou banished Pâkâru and Consumption in a hundred  
forms.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

99 Thee did Gandharvas dig from earth, thee Indra and  
Brihaspati.  
King Soma, knowing thee, O Plant, from his Consumption  
was made free.  
100 Conquer mine enemies, the men who challenge me do thou  
subdue.  
Conquer thou all unhappiness: victorious art thou, O Plant.  
101 Long-lived be he who digs thee, Plant, and he for whom I  
dig thee up.  
So mayst thou also, grown long-lived, rise upward with a  
hundred shoots.  
102 Most excellent of all art thou, O Plant; thy vassals are the  
trees.  
Let him be subject to our power, the man who seeks to  
injure us.  
103 May he not harm me who is earth's begetter, nor he whose  
laws are faithful, sky's pervades;  
Nor he who first begot the lucid waters. To Ka the God  
let us present oblation.  
104 Turn thyself hitherward, O Earth, to us with sacrifice and  
milk.  
Thy covering skin Agni, urged forth, hath mounted.  
105 All, Agni, that in thee is bright, pure, cleansed, and meet  
for sacrifice,  
That do we bring unto the Gods.  
106 I from this place have fed on strength and vigour, the  
womb of holy Law, stream of the mighty.  
In cows let it possess me and in bodies. I quit decline and  
lack of food, and sickness.  
107 Agni, life-power and fame are thine: thy fires blaze mightily,  
thou rich in wealth of beams!  
Sage, passing bright, thou givest to the worshipper, with  
strength, the food that merits laud.  
108 With brilliant, purifying sheen, with perfect sheen thou  
liftest up thyself in light.  
Thou, visiting both thy Mothers, aidest them as Son: thou  
joinest close the earth and heaven.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

109 O Jâtavedas, Son of Strength, rejoice thyself, gracious, in  
our fair hymns and songs.  
In thee are treasured various forms of strengthening food,  
born nobly and of wondrous help.  
110 Agni, spread forth, as Ruler, over living things: give wealth  
to us, Immortal God.  
Thou shinest out from beauty fair to look upon: thou  
leadest us to conquering power.  
111 To him, the wise, who orders sacrifice, who hath great riches  
under his control,  
Thou givest blest award of good, and plenteous food, givest  
him wealth that conquers all.  
112 The men have set before them for their welfare Agni, strong,  
visible to all, the Holy.  
Thee, Godlike One, with ears to hear, most famous, men's  
generations magnify with praise-songs.  
113 Soma, wax great. From every side may vigorous powers  
unite in thee.  
Be in the gathering-place of strength.  
114 In thee be juicy nutriments united, and power and mighty  
foe-subduing vigour.  
Waxing to immortality, O Soma, win highest glory for  
thyself in heaven.  
115 Wax, O most gladdening Soma, great through all thy  
filaments, and be  
A friend of most illustrious fame to prosper us.  
116 May Vatsa draw thy mind away, even from thy loftiest  
dwelling-place,  
Agni, with song that yearns for thee.  
117 Agni, best Angiras, to thee all people who have pleasant  
homes  
Apart have turned to gain their wish.  
118 In dear homes, Agni, the desire of all that is and is to be,  
Shines forth the One Imperial Lord.
