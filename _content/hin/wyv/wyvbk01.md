# THE TEXTS OF THE WHITE YAJURVEDA

# OR VÂJASANEYA-SAMHITÂ.

### BOOK THE FIRST.

THEE for food. Thee for vigour. Ye are breezes.  
To noblest work God Savitar impel you. Inviolable! swell  
his share for Indra.  
No thief, no evil-minded man shall master you rich in off-spring,  
free from pain and sickness.  
Be constant, numerous to this lord of cattle. Guard thou  
the cattle of the Sacrificer.

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

2 Strainer of Vasu art thou. Thou art heaven. Earth art  
thou. Thou art Mâtarisvan's caldron.  
Thou art the All-container. Stand thou firmly, secure by  
Law Supreme, and do not totter. Nor be thy Lord of  
Sacrifice unsteady.  
3 Thou art the strainer, hundred-streamed, of Vasu. Thou  
art the strainer, thousand-streamed, of Vasu.  
May Savitar the God with Vasu's strainer, thousand-streamed,  
rightly cleansing, purify thee.  
4 Which didst thou milk? This is the cow Visvâyu. This  
Visvakarman. This is Visvadhâyas.  
Thee, Indra's share, with Soma do I curdle. Be thou protector  
of the oblation, Vishnu.  
5 I will observe the vow, Lord of Vows, Agni! May I have  
strength therefor. Success attend me.  
Now into truth from untruth do I enter.  
6 Who is it that unites thee? He unites thee. For what  
doth he yoke thee? For that he yokes thee.  
You two for work, you two for its completion.

7 Scorched are the fiends, scorched the malignant beings.  
Burnt out are fiends, burnt out malignant beings.  
Throughout the spacious middle air I travel.  
8 Thou art the yoke. Injure thou him who injures. Harm  
him who harm us. Harm the man we injure.  
Thou art the Gods’ best carrier, bound most firmly, filled  
fullest, welcomest, Gods’ best invoker.  
9 Thou art unbent, receiver of oblations. Stand firmly in thy  
place and do not totter.  
Nor be thy Lord of sacrifice unsteady.  
Let Vishnu mount thee. To the wind lie open. The demons  
are expelled. Let the five grasp it.  
10 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,  
with the hands of Pûshan,  
Thee dear to Agni, dear to Agni-Soma.  
11 Thee for abundance, not for evil spirit. May mine eye look  
upon the light of heaven.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

May those with doors stand on the earth securely. Throughout  
the spacious middle air I travel.  
Upon the navel of the earth I place thee, on Aditi's lap.  
Protect the oblation, Agni!  
12 Ye two are strainers that belong to Vishnu. By Savitar's  
impulse, with this flawless strainer I purify you with the  
rays of Sûrya.  
Bright Waters, flowing forward, foremost drinkers, lead forward  
now this sacrifice, lead forward the Sacrifice's Lord,  
the God-devoted Lord of the Sacrifice, the liberal giver.  
13 Indra elected you in fight with Vritra: in fight with Vritra  
you elected Indra.  
By over-sprinkling are ye consecrated. I sprinkle thee  
agreeable to Agni. I sprinkle thee welcome to Agni-Soma.  
Pure for the work divine be ye, and holy, pure for the sacrifice  
to Gods. Whatever of yours the impure have by their  
touch polluted, hereby I cleanse for you from all defilement.  
14 Giver art thou of happiness. Rejected are fiends, rejected  
are malignant beings.  
Aditi's akin art thou. May Aditi receive thee. A wooden  
stone art thou. Thou art a broad-based stone. May the  
skin of Aditi receive thee.  
15 Body of Agni art thou, the releaser of speech. I seize thee  
for the Gods’ enjoyment.  
A mighty stone art thou, formed out of timber.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

Make ready for the Deities this oblation: with careful preparation  
make it ready.  
Havishkrit, come! Havishkrit, come! Havishkrit, come!  
16 Thou art a cock whose tongue is sweet with honey. Call to  
us hither sap and manly vigour.  
May we with thee in every fight be victors. Rain-grown art  
thou. May the rain-grown receive thee.  
Cleared off are fiends, cleared off are evil beings. Expelled  
are fiends. May Vâyu separate you. May Savitar the  
God, the golden-handed, with flawless hand unto himself  
receive you.  
17 Bold art thou. Cast away the Corpse-consumer. Drive off  
the fire that eats raw flesh, O Agni.  
That which makes offerings to the Gods bring hither.  
Firm art thou. Make earth firm. For the foe's slaughter I  
set thee on, devoted to the priesthood, devoted to the  
nobles and the kinsmen.  
18 Agni, do thou accept our holy service.  
Keeper art thou: make firm the Air's mid-region. For the  
foe's death I set thee on, devoted to priesthood and nobility  
and kinsmen.  
Thou art a stay: uphold the sky securely. For the foe's  
death, etc.  
I set thee on for sake of all the regions. Formers of layers  
are ye, and heap-formers, With Bhrigus’ and Angirases’  
heat be heated.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

19 Giver of happiness art thou. Rejected are fiends, rejected  
are malignant beings. Aditi's skin art thou, May Aditi  
receive thee.  
Bowl, rock art thou. May Aditi's skin receive thee.  
Thou art the sky's supporting pillar.  
Bowl from the rock art thou. The rock receive thee.  
20 Grain art thou. Please the Gods. Thee for in-breathing.  
For out-breath thee. Thee for diffusive breathing. May  
I impart to life a long extension.  
May Savitar the God, the golden-handed, with flawless hand  
unto himself receive you.  
Thee for the eye. Juice art thou of the Great Ones.  
21 By impulse of God Savitar I strew thee, with arms of Asvins,  
with the hands of Basilan.  
With plants let waters, plants with sap he mingled. United  
be the rich ones with the moving. The sweet ones and  
the sweet be joined together.  
22 For generation's sake I join thee. This is Agni's. This
Agni-Soma's.  
Thee for food.  
Thou art the caldron, life of all that liveth. Spread thyself  
widely forth, thou, widely spreading. So may thy Lord of  
sacrifice spread widely.  
Thy skin let Agni harm not. In highest heaven let the God  
Savitar hake thee.  
23 Fear not. Shrink not. Let not the sacrifice be languid, not  
languid he the Sacrificer's offspring.  
For Trita thee. For Dvita thee. For Ekata thee.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

24 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee, with arms of Asvins,  
with the hands of Pûshan, thee who for Gods performest  
sacred service.  
Indra's right arm art thou: sharp with a thousand spikes,  
a hundred edges. The keen-edged Wind art thou, the  
foeman's slayer.  
25 O Earth, whereon men serve the Gods with worship, let me  
not do thy plant's root any damage.  
Go to the pen, the cowstall. Heaven rain for thee.  
On this earth's farthest end, God Savitar, bind him, with  
hundred fetters bind the man who hates us and whom  
we hate. Thence do not thou [release](errata.htm#0) him.  
26 May I drive Araru away from Earth, the seat of men's oblations  
to the Gods. Go to the pen . . . . . . . release him  
(as in verse 25).  
O Araru, thou shalt not soar to heaven. Let not thy drop  
mount upward to the sky.  
Go to the pen . . . . . . . release him (as in verse 25).  
27 I with the metre Gâyatrî enclose thee. I lay the Trishtup  
metre round about thee. With Jagatî metre I confine  
and gird thee.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

Sprung from good soil art thou, and bliss-bestowing. Pleasant  
art thou, and a fair seat to rest on. Thou hast both  
strengthening food and drink in plenty.  
28 Before the cruel foe's secret departure, Mighty One, raising  
high earth, life-bestower, which to the Moon they lifted  
by oblations, that earth the sages still point out and worship.  
Deposit in its place the sprinkling-water, Thou art the slayer  
of the man who hates us.  
29 Scorched are the demons, scorched the evil beings. Burnt  
out are fiends, burnt out malignant creatures.  
Unsharpened, thou art slayer of the foemen. Thee, rich in  
food, I cleanse for the food's kindling.  
Scorched . . . . . creatures (as above).  
Thee rich in food, I cleanse for the food's kindling.  
30 A zone for Aditi art thou. Pervader of Vishnu art thou.  
For great strength I take thee. I look upon thee with an  
eye uninjured.  
Thou art the tongue of Agni. Good invoker of Gods be  
thou at every holy station, at every sacrificial text I utter.  
31 By Savitar's impulsion do I cleanse thee, with flawless  
strainer, with the rays of Sûrya.  
By Savitar's impulsion do I cleanse you, with flawless strainer,  
with the rays of Sûrya.  
Light art thou; thou art splendid; thou art Amrit. Thou,  
truly, art the Gods’ beloved station, inviolable means of  
holy worship.
