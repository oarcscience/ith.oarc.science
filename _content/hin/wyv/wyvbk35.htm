<p>BEGONE the Panis, hence away, rebellious, scorners of the<br> Gods!<br> The place is his who poured the juice.<br> 2 Let Savitar approve a spot upon the earth for thy remains:<br> And let the bulls be yoked for it.<br> 3 Let V&acirc;yu purify. Let Savitar purify. With Agni's glitter.<br> With Savitar's lustre. Let the bulls be unyoked.<br> 4 The Holy Fig Tree is your home, your mansion is the Parna<br> Tree:<br> Winners of cattle shall ye be if ye regain for me this man.<br> 5 Let Savitar lay down thy bones committed to the Mother's<br> lap.<br> Be pleasant to this man, O Earth.<br> 6 Here in the God Praj&acirc;pati, near water, Man, I lay thee down:<br> May his light drive mishap from us.<br> 7 Go hence, O Death, pursue thy special pathway apart from<br> that which Gods are wont to travel.<br> To thee I say it who hast eyes and hearest: Touch not our<br> offspring, injure not our heroes.</p>

<p>8 Pleasant to thee be wind and sun, and pleasant be the bricks<br> to thee.<br> Pleasant to thee be the terrestrial fires: let them not scorch<br> thee in their flames.<br> 9 Prosper for thee the regions and the waters, and let the seas<br> for thee be most propitious.<br> Auspicious unto thee be Air. Prosper all Quarters well for<br> thee!<br> 10 On flows the stony flood: hold fast each other, keep yourselves<br> up, my friends, and pass the river.<br> Here let us leave the powers that brought no profit, and<br> cross the flood to Powers that are auspicious.<br> 11 Drive away evil, drive away fault, sorcery, and guiltiness.<br> Do thou, O Ap&acirc;m&acirc;rga, drive the evil dream away from us.<br> 12 To us let waters and the plants be friendly, to him who<br> hates us, whom we hate, unfriendly.<br> 13 For our prosperity we touch the ox the son of Surabhi.<br> Be bearer and deliverer to us as Indra to the Gods.<br> 14 Looking upon the loftiest light, etc., as in XX. 21.<br> 15 Here I erect this rampart for the living: let none of these,<br> none other, reach this limit.<br> May they survive a hundred lengthened autumns, and may<br> they bury Death beneath this mountain.<br> 16 Agni, thou pourest life, etc., as in XIX. 38.</p>

<p>17 Waxing with sacrifice live long, O Agni, with butter on thy<br> face and homed in fatness.<br> When thou hast drunk the cows&#146; fair savoury butter, guard,<br> as a father guards his son, these people.<br> 18 These men have led about the ox, have duly carried Agni<br> round,<br> And raised their glory to the Gods. Who will attack them<br> with success?<br> 19 I drive Corpse-eating Agni to a distance: sin-laden let him<br> go to Yama's kingdom.<br> Here let this other, J&acirc;tavedas, carry oblation to the Deities,<br> foreknowing.<br> 20 Carry the fat to Fathers, J&acirc;tavedas, where, far away, thou<br> knowest, them established.<br> Let rivulets of marrow flow to meet them, and let their<br> truthful wishes be accomplished. All-hail!<br> 21 Pleasant be thou to us, O Earth, without a thorn, our<br> resting-place.<br> Vouchsafe us shelter reaching far. May thy light drive<br> mishap from us.<br> 22 Born art thou, Agni, from this man: let him again be born<br> from thee,<br> For Svarga's world, the man I name. All-hail!</p>
