<p>I. 65. <i>avadh&ucirc; bh&ucirc;le ko ghar l&acirc;we</p> </i>
<p>HE is dear to me indeed who can call back the wanderer to his home. In the home is the true union, in the home is enjoyment of life: why should I forsake my home and wander in the forest? <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="green">p. 88</font></A> If Brahma helps me to realize truth, verily I will find both bondage and deliverance in home.<br> He is dear to me indeed who has power to dive deep into Brahma; whose mind loses itself with ease in His contemplation.<br> He is dear to me who knows Brahma, and can dwell on His supreme truth in meditation; and who can play the melody of the Infinite by uniting love and renunciation in life.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "The home is the abiding place; in the home is reality; the home helps to attain Him Who is real. So stay where you are, and all things shall come to you in time."</p>
