<p>I. 48. <i>sukh s&acirc;gar me<u>n</u> &acirc;&icirc;ke</p> </i>
<p>WHEN at last you are come to the ocean of happiness, do not go back thirsty.<br> Wake, foolish man! for Death stalks you. Here is pure water before you; drink it at every breath.<br> Do not follow the mirage on foot, but thirst for the nectar;<br> Dhruva, Prahlad, and Shukadeva have drunk of it, and also Raidas has tasted it:<br> The saints are drunk with love, their thirst is for love.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "Listen to me, brother! The nest of fear is broken.<br> Not for a moment have you come face to face with the world: <a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></A><br> You are weaving your bondage of falsehood, your words are full of deception:<br> With the load of desires which you. hold on your head, how can you be light?"<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "Keep within you truth, detachment, and love."</p>
