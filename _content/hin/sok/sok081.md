### LXXX

III\. 69.

satta nâm hai sab te<u>n</u> nyârâ

THE true Name is like none other name!  
The distinction of the Conditioned from the Unconditioned is but a
word:  
The Unconditioned is the seed, the Conditioned is the flower and the
fruit.  
Knowledge is the branch, and the Name is the root.  
Look, and see where the root is: happiness shall be yours when you come
to the root.  
The root will lead you to the branch, the leaf, the flower, and the
fruit:  
It is the encounter with the Lord, it is the attainment of bliss, it is
the reconciliation of the Conditioned and the Unconditioned.
