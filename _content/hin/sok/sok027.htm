<p>ALL things are created by the Om;<br> The love-form is His body.<br> He is without form, without quality, without decay:<br> Seek thou union with Him! <a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></A><br> But that formless God takes a thousand forms in the eyes of His creatures:<br> He is pure and indestructible,<br> His form is infinite and fathomless,<br> He dances in rapture, and waves of form arise from His dance.<br> The body and the mind cannot contain themselves, when they are touched by His great joy.<br> He is immersed in all consciousness, all joys, and all sorrows;<br> He has no beginning and no end;<br> He holds all within His bliss.</p>
