### XXIV

II\. 48.

jis se rahani apâr jagat me

n

MORE than all else do I cherish at heart that love which makes me to
live a limitless life in this world.  
It is like the lotus, which lives in the water and blooms in the water:
yet the water cannot touch its petals, they open beyond its reach.  
It is like a wife, who enters the fire at the bidding of love. She burns
and lets others grieve, yet never dishonours love.  
This ocean of the world is hard to cross: its waters are very deep.
Kabîr says: "Listen to me, O Sadhu! few there are who have reached its
end."
