<p>II. 61. <i>grah candra tapan jot varat hai</p> </i>
<p>THE light of the sun, the moon, and the stars shines bright:<br> The melody of love swells forth, and the rhythm of love's detachment beats the time.<br> Day and night, the chorus of music fills the heavens; and Kab&icirc;r says<br> "My Beloved One gleams like the lightning flash in the sky."</p> 
<p>Do you know how the moments perform their adoration?<br> Waving its row of lamps, the universe sings in worship day and night,<br> There are the hidden banner and the secret canopy:<br> There the sound of the unseen bells is heard.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "There adoration never ceases; there the Lord of the Universe sitteth on His throne." <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></A><br> The whole world does its works and commits its errors: but few are the lovers who know the Beloved.<br> The devout seeker is he who mingles in his heart the double currents of love and detachment, like the mingling of the streams of Ganges and Jumna;<br> In his heart the sacred water flows day and night; and thus the round of births and deaths is brought to an end.</p> 
<p>Behold what wonderful rest is in the Supreme Spirit! and he enjoys it, who makes himself meet for it.<br> Held by the cords of love, the swing of the Ocean of Joy sways to and fro; and a mighty sound breaks forth in song.<br> See what a lotus blooms there without water! and Kab&icirc;r says<br> "My heart's bee drinks its nectar." <a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></A><br> What a wonderful lotus it is, that blooms at the heart of the spinning wheel of the universe! Only a few pure souls know of its true delight.<br> Music is all around it, and there the heart partakes of the joy of the Infinite Sea.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "Dive thou into that Ocean of sweetness: thus let all errors of life and of death flee away."</p> 
<p>Behold how the thirst of the five senses is quenched there! and the three forms of misery are no more!<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "It is the sport of the Unattainable One: look within, and behold how the moon-beams of that Hidden One shine in you."<br> There falls the rhythmic beat of life and death: <a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></A><br> Rapture wells forth, and all space is radiant with light.<br> There the Unstruck Music is sounded; it is the music of the love of the three worlds.<br> There millions of lamps of sun and of moon are burning;<br> There the drum beats, and the lover swings in play.<br> There love-songs resound, and light rains in showers; and the worshipper is entranced in the taste of the heavenly nectar.<br> Look upon life and death; there is no separation between them,<br> The right hand and the left hand are one and the same.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "There the wise man is speechless; for this truth may never be found in Vadas or in books."</p> 
<p>I have had my Seat on the Self-poised One, <a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></A><br> I have drunk of the Cup of the Ineffable,<br> I have found the Key of the Mystery,<br> I have reached the Root of Union.<br> Travelling by no track, I have come to the Sorrowless Land: very easily has the mercy of the great Lord come upon me.<br> They have sung of Him as infinite and unattainable: but I in my meditations have seen Him without sight.<br> That is indeed the sorrowless land, and none know the path that leads there:<br> Only he who is on that path has surely transcended all sorrow.<br> Wonderful is that land of rest, to which no merit can win;<br> It is the wise who has seen it, it is the wise who has sung of it.<br> This is the Ultimate Word: but can any express its marvellous savour? <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></A><br> He who has savoured it once, he knows what joy it can give.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "Knowing it, the ignorant man becomes wise, and the wise man becomes speechless and silent,<br> The worshipper is utterly inebriated,<br> His wisdom and his detachment are made perfect;<br> He drinks from the cup of the inbreathings and the outbreathings of love."</p> 
<p>There the whole sky is filled with sound, and there that music is made without fingers and without strings;<br> There the game of pleasure and pain does not cease.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "If you merge your life in the Ocean of Life, you will find your life in the Supreme Land of Bliss."</p> 
<p>What a frenzy of ecstasy there is in <a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></A> every hour! and the worshipper is pressing out and drinking the essence of the hours: he lives in the life of Brahma.<br> I speak truth, for I have accepted truth in life; I am now attached to truth, I have swept all tinsel away.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "Thus is the worshipper set free from fear; thus have all errors of life and of death left him."</p> 
<p>There the sky is filled with music:<br> There it rains nectar:<br> There the harp-strings jingle, and there the drums beat.<br> What a secret splendour is there, in the mansion of the sky!<br> There no mention is made of the rising and the setting of the sun;<br> In the ocean of manifestation, which is the light of love, day and night are felt to be one. <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></A><br> Joy for ever, no sorrow,--no struggle!<br> There have I seen joy filled to the brim, perfection of joy;<br> No place for error is there.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "There have I witnessed the sport of One Bliss!"</p> 
<p>I have known in my body the sport of the universe: I have escaped from the error of this world..<br> The inward and the outward are become as one sky, the Infinite and the finite are united: I am drunken with the sight of this All!<br> This Light of Thine fulfils the universe: the lamp of love that burns on the salver of knowledge.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "There error cannot enter, and the conflict of life and death is felt no more."</p>
