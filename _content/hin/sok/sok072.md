### LXXI

III\. 13.

sâdh sa**n**gat pîtam

GO thou to the company of the good, where the Beloved One has His
dwelling place:  
Take all thy thoughts and love and instruction from thence.  
Let that assembly be burnt to ashes where His Name is not spoken!  
Tell me, how couldst thou hold a wedding-feast, if the bridegroom
himself were not there?  
Waver no more, think only of the Beloved;  
Set not thy heart on the worship of other gods, there is no worth in the
worship of other masters.  
Kabîr deliberates and says: "Thus thou shalt never find the Beloved!"
