<p>I. 22. <i>jab mai<u>n</u> bh&ucirc;l&acirc;, re bh&acirc;&icirc;</p> </i>
<p>O BROTHER! when I was forgetful, my true Guru showed me the Way.<br> Then I left off all rites and ceremonies, I bathed no more in the holy water:<br> Then I learned that it was I alone who was mad, and the whole world beside me was sane; and I had disturbed these wise people.<br> From that time forth I knew no more how to roll in the dust in obeisance:<br> I do not ring the temple bell:<br> I do not set the idol on its throne: <a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></A><br> I do not worship the image with flowers.<br> It is not the austerities that mortify the flesh which are pleasing to the Lord,<br> When you leave off your clothes and kill your senses, you do not please the Lord:<br> The man who is kind and who practises righteousness, who remains passive amidst the affairs of the world, who considers all creatures on earth as his own self,<br> He attains the Immortal Being, the true God is ever with him.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "He attains the true Name whose words are pure, and who is free from pride and conceit."</p>
