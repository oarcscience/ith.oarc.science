### XLI

I. 76.

santo, sahaj samâdh bhalî

O SADHU! the simple union is the best. Since the day when I met with my
<span id="page_89">p. 89</span> Lord, there has been no end to the sport
of our love.  
I shut not my eyes, I close not my ears, I do not mortify my body;  
I see with eyes open and smile, and behold His beauty everywhere:  
I utter His Name, and whatever I see, it reminds me of Him; whatever I
do., it becomes His worship.  
The rising and the setting are one to me; all contradictions are
solved.  
Wherever I go, I move round Him,  
All I achieve is His service:  
When I lie down, I lie prostrate at His feet.

He is the only adorable one to me: I have none other.  
My tongue has left off impure words, it sings His glory day and night:  
Whether I rise or sit down, I can never forget Him; for the rhythm of
His music beats in my ears. <span id="page_90">p. 90</span>  
Kabîr says: "My heart is frenzied, and I disclose in my soul what is
hidden. I am immersed in that one great bliss which transcends all
pleasure and pain."
