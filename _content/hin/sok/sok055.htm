<p>I. 112. <i>s'unt&acirc; nah&icirc; dhun k&icirc; khabar</p> </i>
<p>HAVE you not heard the tune which the Unstruck Music is playing? In the midst of the chamber the harp of joy is gently and sweetly played; and where is the need of going without to hear it?<br> If you have not drunk of the nectar of that One Love, what boots it though you should purge yourself of all stains?<br> The Kazi is searching the words of the Koran, and instructing others: <a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></A> but if his heart be not steeped in that love, what does it avail, though he be a teacher of men?<br> The Yogi dyes his garments with red: but if he knows naught of that colour of love, what does it avail though his garments be tinted?<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "Whether I be in the temple or the balcony, in the camp or in the flower garden, I tell you truly that every moment my Lord is taking His delight in me."</p>
