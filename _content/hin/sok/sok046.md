*The Songs of Kabir*, tr. by Rabindranath Tagore, intro. by Evelyn
Underhill, \[1915\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XLV

I. 97.

sâdho, ko hai kâ<u>n</u>h se âyo

WHO are you, and whence do you come?  
Where dwells that Supreme Spirit, and how does He have His sport with
all created things?  
The fire is in the wood; but who awakens it suddenly? Then it turns to
ashes, and where goes the force of the fire?  
The true guru teaches that He has neither limit nor infinitude.  
Kabîr says: "Brahma suits His language to the understanding of His
hearer."
