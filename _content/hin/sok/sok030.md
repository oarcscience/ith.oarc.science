Kabîr kab se bhaye vairâgî

GORAKHNATH asks Kabîr:  
"Tell me, O Kabîr, when did your vocation begin? Where did your love
have its rise?"  
Kabîr answers:  
"When He whose forms are manifold had not begun His play: when there was
no Guru, and no disciple: when the world was not spread out: when the
Supreme One was alone--  
Then I became an ascetic; then, O Gorakh, my love was drawn to Brahma.  
Brahma did not hold the crown on his head; the god Vishnu was not <span

unborn; when I was instructed in Yoga.

I became suddenly revealed in Benares, and Râmânanda illumined me;  
I brought with me the thirst for the Infinite, and I have come for the
meeting with Him.  
In simplicity will I unite with the Simple One; my love will surge up.  
O Gorakh, march thou with His music!"
