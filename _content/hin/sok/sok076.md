III\. 55.

ved kahe sargu**n** ke âge

THE Vedas say that the Unconditioned stands beyond the world of
Conditions.  
O woman, what does it avail thee to dispute whether He is beyond all or
in all? <span id="page_118">p. 118</span>  
See thou everything as thine own dwelling place: the mist of pleasure
and pain can never spread there.  
There Brahma is revealed day and night: there light is His garment,
light is His seat, light rests on thy head.  
Kabîr says: "The Master, who is true, He is all light."
