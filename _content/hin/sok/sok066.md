### LXV

I. 22.

jab mai<u>n</u> bhûlâ, re bhâî

O BROTHER! when I was forgetful, my true Guru showed me the Way.  
Then I left off all rites and ceremonies, I bathed no more in the holy
water:  
Then I learned that it was I alone who was mad, and the whole world
beside me was sane; and I had disturbed these wise people.  
From that time forth I knew no more how to roll in the dust in
obeisance:  
I do not ring the temple bell:  
I do not set the idol on its throne: <span id="page_109">p. 109</span>  
I do not worship the image with flowers.  
It is not the austerities that mortify the flesh which are pleasing to
the Lord,  
When you leave off your clothes and kill your senses, you do not please
the Lord:  
The man who is kind and who practises righteousness, who remains passive
amidst the affairs of the world, who considers all creatures on earth as
his own self,  
He attains the Immortal Being, the true God is ever with him.  
Kabîr says: "He attains the true Name whose words are pure, and who is
free from pride and conceit."
