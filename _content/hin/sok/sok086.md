### LXXXV

III\. 90.

naihar se jiyarâ phâ**t** re

MY heart cries aloud for the house of my lover; the open road and the
shelter of a roof are all one to her who has lost the city of her
husband.  
My heart finds no joy in anything: my mind and my body are distraught.  
His palace has a million gates, but there is a vast ocean between it and
me:  
How shall I cross it, O friend? for endless is the outstretching of the
path.  
How wondrously this lyre is wrought! When its strings are rightly
strung, it maddens the heart: but when the keys are broken and the
strings are loosened, none regard it more.  
I tell my parents with laughter that I must go to my Lord in the
morning; <span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

They are angry, for they do not want me to go, and they say: "She thinks
she has gained such dominion over her husband that she can have
whatsoever she wishes; and therefore she is impatient to go to him."  
Dear friend, lift my veil lightly now; for this is the night of love.  
Kabîr says: "Listen to me! My heart is eager to meet my lover: I lie
sleepless upon my bed. Remember me early in the morning!"
