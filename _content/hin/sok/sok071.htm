<p>III. 9. <i>s'&icirc;l santosh sad&acirc; samad<b>r</b>ish<b>t</b>i</p> </i>
<p>HE who is meek and contented., he who has an equal vision, whose mind is filled with the fullness of acceptance and of rest;<br> He who has seen Him and touched Him, he is freed from all fear and trouble.<br> To him the perpetual thought of God is like sandal paste smeared on the body, to him nothing else is delight:<br> His work and his rest are filled with music: he sheds abroad the radiance of love.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "Touch His feet, who is one and indivisible, immutable and peaceful; who fills all vessels to the brim with joy, and whose form is love."</p>
