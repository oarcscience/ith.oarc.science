### LXXXVI

III\. 96.

jîv mahal me<u>n</u> S'iv pahunwâ

SERVE your God, who has come into this temple of life!  
Do not act the part of a madman, for the night is thickening fast.  
He has awaited me for countless ages, <span id="page_133">p. 133</span>
for love of me He has lost His heart:  
Yet I did not know the bliss that was so near to me, for my love was not
yet awake.  
But now, my Lover has made known to me the meaning of the note that
struck my ear:  
Now, my good fortune is come.  
Kabîr says: "Behold! how great is my good fortune! I have received the
unending caress of my Beloved!"
