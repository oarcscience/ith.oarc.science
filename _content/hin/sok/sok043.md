### XLII

I. 79.

tîrath me<u>n</u> to sab pânî hai

THERE is nothing but water at the holy bathing places; and I know that
they are useless, for I have bathed in them.  
The images are all lifeless, they cannot speak; I know, for I have cried
aloud to them.  
The Purana and the Koran are mere words; lifting up the curtain, I have
seen.  
Kabîr gives utterance to the words of experience; and he knows very well
that all other things are untrue.
