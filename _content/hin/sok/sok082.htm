<p>IN the beginning was He alone, sufficient unto Himself: the formless, colourless, and unconditioned Being.<br> Then was there neither beginning, middle, nor end;<br> Then were no eyes, no darkness, no light;<br> Then were no ground, air, nor sky; no fire, water, nor earth; no rivers like the Ganges and the Jumna, no seas, oceans, and waves.<br> Then was neither vice nor virtue; scriptures there were not, as the Vedas and Puranas, nor as the Koran.<br> Kab&icirc;r ponders in his mind and says, "Then was there no activity: the Supreme Being remained merged in the unknown depths of His own self." <a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></A><br> The Guru neither eats nor drinks, neither lives nor dies:<br> Neither has He form, line, colour, nor vesture.<br> He who has neither caste nor clan nor anything else--how may I describe His glory?<br> He has neither form nor formlessness,<br> He has no name,<br> He has neither colour nor colourlessness,<br> He has no dwelling-place.</p>
