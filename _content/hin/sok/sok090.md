### LXXXIX

I. 100.

kôi s'untâ hai jñânî râg gagan me

n

IS there any wise man who will listen to that solemn music which arises
in the sky?  
For He, the Source of all music, makes all vessels full fraught, and
rests in fullness Himself. <span id="page_136">p. 136</span>  
He who is in the body is ever athirst, for he pursues that which is in
part:  
But ever there wells forth deeper and deeper the sound "He is this--this
is He"; fusing love and renunciation into one.  
Kabîr says: "O brother! that is the Primal Word."
