<p>I. 105. <i>jo d&icirc;sai, so to hai n&acirc;h&icirc;<u>n</p> </i></u>
<p>THAT which you see is not: and for that which is, you have no words.<br> Unless you see, you believe not: what is told you&nbsp;you cannot accept.<br> He who is discerning knows by the word; and the ignorant stands gaping. <a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="green">p. 96</font></A><br> Some contemplate the Formless, and others meditate on form: but the wise man knows that Brahma is beyond both.<br> That beauty of His is not seen of the eye: that metre of His is not heard of the ear.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "He who has found both love and renunciation never descends to death."</p>
