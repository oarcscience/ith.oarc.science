WHERE Spring, the lord of the seasons, reigneth, there the Unstruck
Music sounds of itself,  
There the streams of light flow in all directions;  
Few are the men who can cross to that shore!  
There, where millions of Krishnas stand with hands folded,  
Where millions of Vishnus bow their heads,  
Where millions of Brahmâs are reading the Vedas,  
Where millions of Shivas are lost in contemplation,  
Where millions of Indras dwell in the sky,  
Where the demi-gods and the munis are unnumbered,  
Where millions of Saraswatis, Goddess of Music, play on the vina--<span
id="page_59">p. 59</span>  
There is my Lord self-revealed: and the scent of sandal and flowers
dwells in those deeps.
