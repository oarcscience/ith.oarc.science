II\. 59.

jâ<u>n</u>h, cet acet khambh dôû

BETWEEN the poles of the conscious and the unconscious, there has the
mind made a swing:  
Thereon hang all beings and all worlds, and that swing never ceases its
sway.  
Millions of beings are there: the sun and the moon in their courses are
there:  
Millions of ages pass, and the swing goes on.  
All swing! the sky and the earth and the air and the water; and the Lord
Himself taking form:  
And the sight of this has made Kabîr a servant.
