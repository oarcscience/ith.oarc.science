<p>IT is the mercy of my true Guru that has made me to know the unknown;<br> I have learned from Him how to walk without feet, to see without eyes, to hear without ears, to drink <a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></A> without mouth, to fly without wings;<br> I have brought my love and my meditation into the land where there is no sun and moon, nor day and night.<br> Without eating, I have tasted of the sweetness of nectar; and without water, I have quenched my thirst.<br> Where there is the response of delight, there is the fullness of joy. Before whom can that joy be uttered?<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "The Guru is great beyond words, and great is the good fortune of the disciple."</p>
