### LXXXII

III\. 76.

kahai<u>n</u> Kabîr vicâr ke

KABÎR ponders and says: "He who has neither caste nor country, who is
formless and without quality, fills all space."  
The Creator brought into being the Game of Joy: and from the word Om the
Creation sprang. <span id="page_129">p. 129</span>  
The earth is His joy; His joy is the sky;  
His joy is the flashing of the sun and the moon;  
His joy is the beginning, the middle, and the end;  
His joy is eyes, darkness, and light.  
Oceans and waves are His joy: His joy the Sarasvati, the Jumna, and the
Ganges.  
The Guru is One: and life and death., union and separation, are all His
plays of joy!  
His play the land and water, the whole universe!  
His play the earth and the sky!  
In play is the Creation spread out, in play it is established. The whole
world, says Kabîr, rests in His play, yet still the Player remains
unknown.
