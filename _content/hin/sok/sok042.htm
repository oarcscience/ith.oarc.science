Since the day when I met with my <a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></A> Lord, there has been no end to the sport of our love.<br> I shut not my eyes, I close not my ears, I do not mortify my body;<br> I see with eyes open and smile, and behold His beauty everywhere:<br> I utter His Name, and whatever I see, it reminds me of Him; whatever I do., it becomes His worship.<br> The rising and the setting are one to me; all contradictions are solved.<br> Wherever I go, I move round Him,<br> All I achieve is His service:<br> When I lie down, I lie prostrate at His feet.</p> 
<p>He is the only adorable one to me: I have none other.<br> My tongue has left off impure words, it sings His glory day and night:<br> Whether I rise or sit down, I can never forget Him; for the rhythm of His music beats in my ears. <a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></A><br> Kab&icirc;r says: "My heart is frenzied, and I disclose in my soul what is hidden. I am immersed in that one great bliss which transcends all pleasure and pain."</p>
