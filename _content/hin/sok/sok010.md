*The Songs of Kabir*, tr. by Rabindranath Tagore, intro. by Evelyn
Underhill, \[1915\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### IX

I. 104.

aisâ lo nahî<u>n</u> taisâ lo

O HOW may I ever express that secret word?  
O how can I say He is not like this, and He is like that? <span
id="page_53">p. 53</span>  
If I say that He is within me, the universe is ashamed:  
If I say that He is without me, it is falsehood.  
He makes the inner and the outer worlds to be indivisibly one;  
The conscious and the unconscious, both are His footstools.  
He is neither manifest nor hidden, He is neither revealed nor
unrevealed:  
There are no words to tell that which He is.
