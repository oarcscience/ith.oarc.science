With composed mind, and thinking on nothing else, the Brahman should offer worship to both the gods and progenitors, and should respectfully circumambulate, keeping Brahmans on his left hand, and give them food. Standing with his face to the east, he should present, with the</p>

<p>parts of the hand sacred to the gods and to Praj&aacute;pati, balls of food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_868"></A><A HREF="#fn_868"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, with curds, unbruised grain, and jujubes; and should perform, on every accession of good fortune, the rite by which the class of progenitors termed N&aacute;nd&iacute;mukha is propitiated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_869"></A><A HREF="#fn_869"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. A householder should diligently worship the Pitris so named, at the marriage of a son or daughter, on entering a new dwelling, on giving a name to a child, on performing his tonsure and other purificatory ceremonies, at the binding of the mother's hair during gestation, or on first seeing the face of a son, or the like.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The &#346;r&aacute;ddha on such occasions, however, has been briefly alluded to. Hear now, oh king, the rules for the performance of obsequial rites.</p>  
<p>"Having washed the corpse with holy water, decorated it with garlands, and burnt it without the village, the kinsmen, having bathed with their clothes on, are to stand with their faces to the south, and offer libations to the deceased, addressing him by name, and adding, 'wherever thou mayest be&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_870"></A><A HREF="#fn_870"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.' They then return, along with the cattle coming from pasture, to the village; and upon the appearance of the stars retire to rest, sleeping on mats spread upon the earth. Every day (whilst the mourning lasts) a cake or ball of food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_871"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is to be placed on the ground, as an offering to the deceased; and rice, without flesh, is to be daily eaten. Brahmans are to be fed for as many days as the mourner pleases, for the soul of the defunct derives satisfaction accordingly as his relatives are content with their entertainment. On the first day, or the third, or seventh, or ninth (after the death of a person), his kinsmen should change their raiment, and bathe out of doors, and offer a libation of water, with (tila) sesamum-seeds. On the fourth day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_872"></A><A HREF="#fn_872"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> the ashes and bones should be collected: after which the body of one connected with the deceased by offerings of funeral cakes may be touched (by an indifferent person), without thereby incurring impurity; and those who are related only by presentation of water are qualified for any occupation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_873"></A><A HREF="#fn_873"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The former class of relatives may use beds, but they must still refrain from unguents and flowers, and must observe continence, after the ashes and bones have been collected (until the mourning is over). When the deceased is a child, or one who is abroad, or who has been degraded, or a spiritual preceptor, the period of uncleanness is but brief, and the ceremonies with fire and water are discretional. The food of a family in which a kinsman is deceased is not to be partaken of for ten days&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_874"></A><A HREF="#fn_874"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>; and during that period, gifts, acceptance, sacrifice, and sacred study are suspended. The term of impurity for a Brahman is ten days; for a Kshatriya, twelve; for a Vai&#347;ya, half a month; and a whole month for a &#346;&uacute;dra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_875"></A><A HREF="#fn_875"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>. On the first day after uncleanness ceases, the nearest relation of the deceased should feed Brahmans at his pleasure, but in uneven numbers, and offer to the deceased a ball of rice upon holy grass placed near the residue of the food that has been eaten. After the guests have been fed, the mourner, according to his caste, is to touch water, a weapon, a goad, or a staff, as he is purified by such contact. He may then resume the duties prescribed for his caste, and follow the avocation ordinarily pursued by its members.</p>  
<p>"The &#346;r&aacute;ddha enjoined for an individual is to be repeated on the day of his death (in each month for a year)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_876"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>, but without the prayers and rites performed on the first occasion, and without offerings to the Vi&#347;wadevas. A single ball of food is to be offered to the deceased, as the purification of one person, and Brahmans are to be fed. The Brahmans are to be asked by the sacrificer if they are satisfied; and upon their assent, the prayer, 'May this ever satisfy such a one' (the deceased) is to be recited.</p>

<p>"This is the &#346;r&aacute;ddha called Ekoddisht&#769;a, which is to be performed monthly to the end of a twelvemonth from the death of a person; at the expiration of which the ceremony called Sapin&#769;d&#769;ana is to be observed. The practices of this rite are the same as those of the monthly obsequies, but a lustration is to be made with four vessels of water, perfumes, and sesamum: one of these vessels is considered as dedicated to the deceased, the other three to the progenitors in general; and the contents of the former are to be transferred to the other three, by which the deceased becomes included in the class of ancestors, to whom worship is to be addressed with all the ceremonies of the &#346;r&aacute;ddha. The persons who are competent to perform the obsequies of relations connected by the offering of the cake are the son, grandson, great grandson, a kinsman of the deceased, the descendants of a brother, or the posterity of one allied by funeral offerings. In absence of all these, the ceremony may be instituted by those related by presentations of water only, or those connected by offerings of cakes or water to maternal ancestors. Should both families in the male line be extinct, the last obsequies may be performed by women, or by the associates of the deceased in religious or social institutions, or by any one who becomes possessed of the property of a deceased kinsman.</p>  
<p>"Obsequial rites are of three descriptions, initiative, intermediate, and subsequent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_877"></A><A HREF="#fn_877"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>. The first are those which are observed after the burning of the corpse until the touching of water, weapons, &amp;c. (or until the cessation of uncleanness). The intermediate ceremonies are the Sr&aacute;ddhas called Ekoddisht&#769;a, which are offered every month: and the subsequent rites are those which follow the Sapin&#769;d&#769;ikaran&#769;a, when the deceased is admitted amongst the ancestors of his race; and the ceremonies are thenceforth general or ancestral. The first set of rites (as essential) are to be performed by the kindred of the father or mother, whether connected by the offering of the cake or of water, by the associates of the deceased, or by the prince who inherits his property.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The first and the last rites are both to be performed by sons and other relations, and by daughter's sons, and their sons; and so are the sacrifices on the day of the person's death. The last class, or ancestral rites, are to be performed annually, with the same ceremonies as are enjoined for the monthly obsequies; and they may be also performed by females. As the ancestral rights are therefore most universal, I will describe to you, oh king, at what seasons, and in what manner, they should be celebrated."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_867"></A><A HREF="vp087.htm#fr_867">314:1</A> The offerings of the Hindus to the Pitris partake of the character of those of the Romans to the lares and manes, but bear a more conspicuous part in their ritual. They are said indeed by Manu (III. 203), in words repeated in the V&aacute;yu and Matsya Pur&aacute;n&#769;as and Hari Van&#347;a, to be of more moment than the worship of the gods: These ceremonies are not to be regarded as merely obsequial; for independently of the rites addressed to a recently deceased relative, and in connexion with him to remote ancestors and to the progenitors of all beings, which are of a strictly obsequial or funereal description, offerings to deceased ancestors, and the Pitris in general, form an essential ceremony on a great variety of festive and domestic occasions. The Nirn&#769;aya Sindhu, in a passage referred to by Mr. Colebrooke (As. Res. VII.), specifies the following &#346;r&aacute;ddhas: 1. The Nitya, or perpetual; daily offerings to ancestors in general: 2. The Naimittika, or occasional; as the Ekoddisht&#769;a,or obsequial offerings on account of a kinsman recently deceased: 3. The K&aacute;mya, voluntary; performed for the accomplishment of a special design: 4. The Vriddhi; performed on occasions of rejoicing or prosperity: 5. The Sapin&#769;d&#769;ana; offerings to all individual and to general ancestors: 6. The P&aacute;rvan&#769;a &#346;r&aacute;ddha; offerings to the manes on certain lunar days called Parvas, or day of full moon and new moon, and the eighth and fourteenth days of the lunar fortnight: 7. The Gosht&#769;hi; for the advantage of a number of learned persons, or of an assembly of Brahmans, invited for the purpose: 8. The &#346;uddhi; one performed to purify a person from some defilement; an expiatory &#346;r&aacute;ddha: 9. The Karm&aacute;nga; one forming part of the initiatory ceremonies, or Sansk&aacute;ras, observed at conception, birth, tonsure, &amp;c.: 10. The Daiva; to which the gods are invited: 11. The Y&aacute;tr&aacute; &#346;r&aacute;ddha; held by a person going a journey: and 12. The Pusht&#769;i &#346;r&aacute;ddha; one performed to promote health and <a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="green">p. 315</font></A> wealth. Of these, the four which are considered the most solemn are the rite performed for a parent, or near relative, lately deceased; that which is performed for kindred collectively; that observed on certain lunar days; and that celebrated on occasions of rejoicing. Nirn&#769;aya Sindhu, p. 271.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_868"></A><A HREF="vp087.htm#fr_868">315:2</A> Manu directs the balls to be made from the remainder of the clarified butter constituting the previous oblation to the gods. III. 215. Kull&uacute;ka Bhat&#769;t&#769;a explains, however, the oblation to consist partly of Anna food, or boiled rice. The latter is the article of which the balls chiefly consist. Y&aacute;jnawalkya directs them to be made of rice and sesamum-seeds. The V&aacute;yu P. adds to these two ingredients, honey and butter: but various kinds of fruit, of pulse, and of grain, and water, frankincense, sugar, and milk, are also mixed up in the Pin&#769;d&#769;as. Their size also differs; and according to Angiras, as quoted by Hem&aacute;dri in the &#346;r&aacute;ddha May&uacute;kha, they may be of the dimension of the fruit of the jujube, or of the hog-plum, of the fruit of the Bel, or of the wood-apple, or of a fowl's egg. Some authorities direct Pin&#769;d&#769;as of a different size for different &#346;r&aacute;ddhas; prescribing them no larger than the wood-apple at the first or pure funereal ceremony, and as big as a cocoa-nut at the monthly and annual &#346;r&aacute;ddha. In practice the Pin&#769;d&#769;a is usually of such a magnitude that it may be conveniently held by the hand.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_869"></A><A HREF="vp087.htm#fr_869">315:3</A> We have here the authority of the text for classing the N&aacute;nd&iacute;mukhas amongst the Pitris (see p. 297): the verse is ###, and the same Gan&#769;a or class is presently again named: ### The Mantra of the Vriddhi or festival &#346;r&aacute;ddha is also said, in the Nirn&#769;aya Sindhu, to be ###. According to the authorities, however, which are cited in that work, there seems to be some uncertainty about the character of the N&aacute;nd&iacute;mukhas; and they are addressed both as Pitris and gods: being in the former case either the ancestors prior to the great grandfather, ancestors collectively, or a certain class of them; and in the latter, being identified with the Vi&#347;wadevas, or a class of them called also &Uacute;rddhavaktra. The term N&aacute;nd&iacute;mukha is also applied to the rite itself, or to the Vriddhi &#346;r&aacute;ddha, and to one addressed to maternal ancestors. Nirn&#769;aya Sindhu, p. 268, &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_870"></A><A HREF="vp087.htm#fr_870">316:4</A> "An oblation of water must be next presented from the joined palms of the hand, naming the deceased and the family from which he sprang, and saying, 'May this oblation reach thee.'" As. Res. VII. 244. The text has, ###.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_871"></A><A HREF="vp087.htm#fr_871">316:5</A> The proper period of mourning is ten days, on each of which offerings of cakes, and libations of water, are to be made to the deceased, augmenting the number of cakes each day, so that on the last day ten cakes are presented. When the period is shorter, the same number of ten cakes must be distributed amongst the several days, or they may be all presented on one day. Nirn&#769;aya Sindhu, p. 429.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_872"></A><A HREF="vp087.htm#fr_872">316:6</A> It should be, more correctly, on that day on which the mourning ceases, or, as previously mentioned, the first, third, seventh, or ninth; but the authorities vary, and, besides these, the second and fourth days, and certain days of the fortnight or month, are specified. Nirn&#769;aya Sindhu, p. 432.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_873"></A><A HREF="vp087.htm#fr_873">316:7</A> They are no longer unclean. The Sapin&#769;d&#769;as, or those connected by offerings of cakes to common ancestors, extend to seven degrees, ascending or descending. The Sam&aacute;nodakas, or those similarly connected by presentations of water, to fourteen degrees.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_874"></A><A HREF="vp087.htm#fr_874">317:8</A> That is, a mere guest or stranger is not to partake of it. The food directed to be given to Brahmans is given in general only to the relatives of the deceased, who are already unclean. In this respect our text and the modern practice seem to differ from the primitive system, as described by Manu, III. 187. The eleventh or twelfth day is the term on which the &#346;r&aacute;ddha which crowns the whole of the funeral rites is to be performed, and when Brahmans are to be invited. Nirn&#769;aya Sindhu, p. 437.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_875"></A><A HREF="vp087.htm#fr_875">317:9</A> The number of Pin&#769;d&#769;as, however, is for each case the same, or ten. Nirn&#769;aya Sindhu, p. 429.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_876"></A><A HREF="vp087.htm#fr_876">317:10</A> So Manu, III. 251. It may be doubted if the monthly &#346;r&aacute;ddha was part <a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="green">p. 318</font></A> of the ancient system, although Kull&uacute;ka Bhat&#769;t&#769;a supposes it to be referred to (v. 548), and supplies the fancied omission of the text.</P>
