Conclusion

The translation of the Vishńu Puráńa has been made from a collation of
various manuscripts in my possession. I had three when I commenced

<span id="page_lxxiv">p. lxxiv</span>

the work, two in the Devanagari, and one in the Bengali character: a
fourth, from the west of India, was given to me by Major Jervis, when
some progress had been made: and in conducting the latter half of the
translation through the press, I have compared it with three other
copies in the library of the East India Company. All these copies
closely agree; presenting no other differences than occasional varieties
of reading, owing chiefly to the inattention or inaccuracy of the
transcriber. Four of the copies were accompanied by a commentary,
essentially the sane, although occasionally varying; and ascribed, in
part at least, to two different scholiasts. The annotations on the first
two books and the fifth are in two MSS. said to be the work of Śrídhara
Yati, the disciple of Paránanda, and who is therefore the same as
Śrídhara Swámí, the commentator on the Bhágavata. In the other three
books these two MSS. concur with other two in naming the commentator
Ratnagarbha Bhat́t́a, who in those two is the author of the notes on the
entire work. The introductory verses of his comment specify him to be
the disciple of Vidya-váchaspati, the son of Hirańyagarbha, and grandson
of Mádhava, who composed his commentary by desire of Súryákara, son of
Ratínath, Miśra, son of Chandrákara, hereditary ministers of some
sovereign who is not particularized. In the illustrations which are
attributed to these different writers there is so much conformity, that
one or other is largely indebted to his predecessor. They both refer to
earlier commentaries. Śrídhara cites the works of Chit-sukha-yoni and
others, both more extensive and more concise; between which, his own,
which he terms Átma- or Swa-prakása, 'self-illuminator,' holds an
intermediate character. Ratnagarbha entitles his, Vaishńavákúta
chandriká, 'the moonlight of devotion to Vishńu.' The dates of these
commentators are not ascertainable, as far as I am aware, from any of
the particulars which they have specified.

In the notes which I have added to the translation, I have been desirous
chiefly of comparing the statements of the text with those of other
Puráńas, and pointing out the circumstances in which they differ or
agree; so as to render the present publication a sort of concordance to
the whole, as it is not very probable that many of them will be

<span id="page_lxxv">p. lxxv</span>

published or translated. The Index that follows has been made
sufficiently copious to answer the purposes of a mythological and
historical dictionary, as far as the Puráńas, or the greater number of
them, furnish, materials.

In rendering the text into English, I have adhered to it as literally as
was compatible with some regard to the usages of English composition. In
general the original presents few difficulties. The style of the Puráńas
is very commonly humble and easy, and the narrative is plainly and
unpretendingly told. In the addresses to the deities, in the
expatiations upon the divine nature, in the descriptions of the
universe, and in argumentative and metaphysical discussion, there occur
passages in which the difficulty arising from the subject itself is
enhanced by the brief and obscure manner in which it is treated. On such
occasions I derived much aid from the commentary, but it is possible
that I may have sometimes misapprehended and misrepresented the
original; and it is also possible that I may have sometimes failed to
express its purport with sufficient precision to have made it
intelligible. I trust, however, that this will not often be the case,
and that the translation of the Vishńu Puráńa will be of service and of
interest to the few, who in these times of utilitarian selfishness,
conflicting opinion, party virulence, and political agitation, can find
a restingplace for their thoughts in the tranquil contemplation of those
yet living pictures of the ancient world which are exhibited by the
literature and mythology of the Hindus.
