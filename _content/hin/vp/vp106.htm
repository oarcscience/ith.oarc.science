The son of Dev&aacute;vriddha was Babhru of whom this verse is recited; "We hear when afar, and we behold when nigh, that Babhru is the first of men, and Dev&aacute;vriddha is equal to the gods: sixty-six persons following the precepts of one, and six thousand and eight who were disciples of the other, obtained immortality."

<p>born&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1153"></A><A HREF="#fn_1153"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>. The son of Anamitra was Nighna, who had two sons, Prasena and Satr&aacute;jit. The divine &Aacute;ditya, the sun, was the friend of the latter.</p>  
<p>On one occasion Satr&aacute;jit, whilst walking along the sea shore, addressed his mind to S&uacute;rya, and hymned his praises; on which the divinity appeared and stood before him. Beholding him in an indistinct shape, Satr&aacute;jit said to the sun, "I have beheld thee, lord, in the heavens as a globe of fire: now do thou shew favour unto me, that I may see thee in thy proper form." On this the sun taking the jewel called Syamantaka from off his neck, placed it apart, and Satr&aacute;jit beheld him of a dwarfish stature, with a body like burnished copper, and with slightly reddish eyes. Having offered his adorations, the sun desired him to demand a boon, and he requested that the jewel might become his. The sun presented it to him, and then resumed his place in the sky. Having obtained the spotless gem of gems, Satr&aacute;jit wore it on his neck, and becoming as brilliant thereby as the sun himself, irradiating all the region with his splendour, he returned to Dw&aacute;rak&aacute;. The inhabitants of that city, beholding him approach, repaired to the eternal male, Purushottama, who, to sustain the burden of the earth, had assumed a mortal form (as Krishn&#769;a), and said to him, "Lord, assuredly the divine sun is coming to visit you." But Krishn&#769;a smiled, and said, "It is not the divine sun, but Satr&aacute;jit, to whom &Aacute;ditya has presented the Syamantaka gem, and he now wears it: go and behold him without apprehension." Accordingly they departed. Satr&aacute;jit having gone to his house, there deposited the jewel, which yielded daily eight loads of gold, and through its marvellous virtue dispelled all fear of portents, wild beasts, fire, robbers, and famine.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_426"><font size="1" color="green">p. 426</font></A></p>  
<p>Achyuta was of opinion that this wonderful gem should be in the possession of Ugrasena; but although he had the power of taking it from Satr&aacute;jit, he did not deprive him of it, that he might not occasion ally disagreement amongst the family. Satr&aacute;jit, on the other hand, fearing that Krishn&#769;a would ask him for the jewel, transferred it to his brother Prasena. Now it was the peculiar property of this jewel, that although it was an inexhaustible source of good to a virtuous person, yet when worn by a man of bad character it was the cause of his death. Prasena having taken the gem, and hung it round his neck, mounted his horse, and went to the woods to hunt. In the chase he was killed by a lion. The lion, taking the jewel in his mouth, was about to depart, when he was observed and killed by J&aacute;mbavat, the king of the bears, who carrying off the gem retired into his cave, and gave it to his son Sukum&aacute;ra to play with. When some time had elapsed, and Prasena did not appear, the Y&aacute;davas began to whisper one to another, and to say, "This is Krishn&#769;a's doing: desirous of the jewel, and not obtaining it, he has perpetrated the murder of Prasena in order to get it into his possession."</p>  
<p>When these calumnious rumours came to the knowledge of Krishn&#769;a, he collected a number of the Y&aacute;davas, and accompanied by them pursued the course of Prasena by the impressions of his horse's hoofs. Ascertaining by this means that he and his horse had been killed by a lion, he was acquitted by all the people of any share in his death. Desirous of recovering the gem, he thence followed the steps of the lion, and at no great distance came to the place where the lion had been killed by the bear. Following the footmarks of the latter, he arrived at the foot of a mountain, where he desired the Y&aacute;davas to await him, whilst he continued the track. Still guided by the marks of the feet, he discovered a cavern, and had scarcely entered it when he heard the nurse of Sukum&aacute;ra saying to him, "The lion killed Prasena; the lion has been killed by J&aacute;mbavat: weep not, Sukum&aacute;ra, the Syamantaka is your own." Thus assured of his object, Krishn&#769;a advanced into the cavern, and saw the brilliant jewel in the hands of the nurse, who was giving it as a plaything to Sukum&aacute;ra. The nurse soon descried his</p>  
<p><a name="page_427"><font size="1" color="green">p. 427</font></A></p>  
<p>approach, and marking his eyes fixed upon the gem with eager desire, called loudly for help. Hearing her cries, J&aacute;mbavat, full of anger, came to the cave, and a conflict ensued between him and Achyuta, which lasted twenty-one days. The Y&aacute;davas who had accompanied the latter waited seven or eight days in expectation of his return, but as the foe of Madhu still came not forth, they concluded that he must have met his death in the cavern. "It could not have required so many days," they thought, "to overcome an enemy;" and accordingly they departed, and returned to Dw&aacute;rak&aacute;, and announced that Krishn&#769;a had been killed.</p>  
<p>When the relations of Achyuta heard this intelligence, they performed all the obsequial rites suited to the occasion. The food and water thus offered to Krishn&#769;a in the celebration of his &#346;r&aacute;ddha served to support his life, and invigorate his strength in the combat in which he was engaged; whilst his adversary, wearied by daily conflict with a powerful foe, bruised and battered in every limb by heavy blows, and enfeebled by want of food, became unable longer to resist him. Overcome by his mighty antagonist, J&aacute;mbavat cast himself before him and said, "Thou, mighty being, art surely invincible by all the demons, and by the spirits of heaven, earth, or hell; much less art thou to be vanquished by mean and powerless creatures in a human shape; and still less by such as we are, who are born of brute origin. Undoubtedly thou art a portion of my sovereign lord N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a, the defender of the universe." Thus addressed by J&aacute;mbavat, Krishn&#769;a explained to him fully that he had descended to take upon himself the burden of the earth, and kindly alleviated the bodily pain which the bear suffered from the fight, by touching him with his hand. J&aacute;mbavat again prostrated himself before Krishn&#769;a, and presented to him his daughter J&aacute;mbavat&iacute;, as an offering suitable to a guest. He also delivered to his visitor the Syamantaka jewel. Although a gift from such an individual was not fit for his acceptance, yet Krishn&#769;a took the gem for the purpose of clearing his reputation. He then returned along with his bride J&aacute;mbavat&iacute; to Dw&aacute;rak&aacute;..</p>  
<p>When the people of Dw&aacute;rak&aacute; beheld Krishn&#769;a alive and returned, they were filled with delight, so that those who were bowed down with</p>  
<p><a name="page_428"><font size="1" color="green">p. 428</font></A></p>  
<p>years recovered youthful vigour; and all the Y&aacute;davas, men and women, assembled round &Aacute;nakadundubhi, the father of the hero, and congratulated him. Krishn&#769;a related to the whole assembly of the Y&aacute;davas all that had happened, exactly as it had befallen, and restoring the Syamantaka jewel to Satr&aacute;jit was exonerated from the crime of which he had been falsely accused. He then led J&aacute;mbavat&iacute; into the inner apartments.</p>  
<p>When Satr&aacute;jit reflected that he had been the cause of the aspersions upon Krishn&#769;a's character, he felt alarmed, and to conciliate the prince he gave him to wife his daughter Satyabh&aacute;m&aacute;. The maiden had been previously sought in marriage by several of the most distinguished Y&aacute;davas, as Akr&uacute;ra, Kritavarman and &#346;atadhanwan, who were highly incensed at her being wedded to another, and leagued in enmity against Satr&aacute;jit. The chief amongst them, with Akr&uacute;ra and Kritavarman, said to &#346;atadhanwan, "This caitiff Satr&aacute;jit has offered a gross insult to you, as well as to us who solicited his daughter, by giving her to Krishn&#769;a: let him not live: why do you not kill him, and take the jewel? Should Achyuta therefore enter into feud with you, we will take your part." Upon this promise &#346;atadhanwan undertook to slay Satr&aacute;jit.</p>  
<p>When news arrived that the sons of P&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;u had been burned in <A HREF="errata.htm#20">the</A> house of wax&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>, Krishn&#769;a, who knew the real truth, set off for B&aacute;ran&#769;&aacute;vata to allay the animosity of Duryodhana, and to perform the duties his relationship required. &#346;atadhanwan taking advantage of his absence, killed Satr&aacute;jit in his sleep, and took possession of the gem. Upon this coming to the knowledge of Satyabh&aacute;m&aacute;, she immediately mounted her chariot, and, filled with fury at her father's murder, repaired to B&aacute;ran&#769;&aacute;vata, and told her husband how Satr&aacute;jit had been killed by &#346;atadhanwan in resentment of her having been married to another, and how he had carried off the jewel; and she implored him to take prompt measures to avenge such heinous wrong. Krishn&#769;a, who is ever internally placid, being informed of these transactions, said to Satyabh&aacute;m&aacute;, as his eyes flashed with indignation, "These are indeed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_429"><font size="1" color="green">p. 429</font></A></p>  
<p>audacious injuries, but I will not submit to them from so vile a wretch. They must assail the tree, who would kill the birds that there have built their nests. Dismiss excessive sorrow; it needs not your lamentations to excite any wrath." Returning forthwith to Dw&aacute;rak&aacute;, Krishn&#769;a took Baladeva apart, and said to him, "A lion slew Prasena, hunting in the forests; and now Satr&aacute;jit has been murdered by &#346;atadhanwan. As both these are removed, the jewel which belonged to them is our common right. Up then, ascend your car, and put &#346;atadhanwan to death."</p>  
<p>Being thus excited by his brother, Balar&aacute;ma engaged resolutely in the enterprise; but &#346;atadhanwan, being aware of their hostile designs, repaired to Kritavarman, and required his assistance. Kritavarman, however, declined to assist him, pleading his inability to engage in a conflict with both Baladeva and Krishn&#769;a. &#346;atadhanwan thus disappointed, applied to Akr&uacute;ra; but he said, "You must have recourse to some other protector. How should I be able to defend you? There is no one even amongst the immortals, whose praises are celebrated throughout the universe, who is capable of contending with the wielder of the discus, at the stamp of whose foot the three worlds tremble; whose hand makes the wives of the Asuras widows, whose weapons no host, however mighty, can resist: no one is capable of encountering the wielder of the ploughshare, who annihilates the prowess of his enemies by the glances of his eyes, that roll with the joys of wine; and whose vast ploughshare manifests his might, by seizing and exterminating the most formidable foes." "Since this is the case," replied &#346;atadhanwan, "and you are unable to assist me, at least accept and take care of this jewel." "I will do so," answered Akr&uacute;ra, "if you promise that even in the last extremity you will not divulge its being in my possession." To this &#346;atadhanwan agreed, and Akr&uacute;ra took the jewel; and the former mounting a very swift mare, one that could travel a hundred leagues a day, fled from Dw&aacute;rak&aacute;.</p>  
<p>When Krishn&#769;a heard of &#346;atadhanwan's flight, he harnessed his four horses, &#346;aivya, Sugr&iacute;va, Meghapushpa, and Bal&aacute;haka, to his car, and, accompanied by Balar&aacute;ma, set off in pursuit. The mare held her speed,</p>  
<p><a name="page_430"><font size="1" color="green">p. 430</font></A></p>  
<p>and accomplished her hundred leagues; but when she reached the country of Mithil&aacute;, her strength was exhausted, and she dropped down and died. &#346;atadhanwan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1155"></A><A HREF="#fn_1155"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> dismounting, continued his flight on foot. When his pursuers came to the place where the mare had perished, Krishn&#769;a said to Balar&aacute;ma, "Do you remain in the car, whilst I follow the villain on foot, and put him to death; the ground here is bad; and the horses will not be able to drag the chariot across it." Balar&aacute;ma accordingly stayed with the car, and Krishn&#769;a followed &#346;atadhanwan on foot: when he had chased him for two kos, he discharged his discus, and, although &#346;atadhanwan was at a considerable distance, the weapon struck off his head. Krishn&#769;a then coining up, searched his body and his dress for the Syamantaka jewel, but found it not. He then returned to Balabhadra, and told him that they had effected the death of &#346;atadhanwan to no purpose, for the precious gem, the quintessence of all worlds, was not upon his person. When Balabhadra heard this, he flew into a violent rage, and said to V&aacute;sudeva, "Shame light upon you, to be thus greedy of wealth! I acknowledge no brotherhood with you. Here lies my path. Go whither you please; I have done with Dw&aacute;rak&aacute;, with you, with all our house. It is of no use to seek to impose upon me with thy perjuries." Thus reviling his brother, who fruitlessly endeavoured to appease him, Balabhadra went to the city of Videha, where Janaka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1156"></A><A HREF="#fn_1156"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> received him hospitably, and there he remained. V&aacute;sudeva returned to Dw&aacute;rak&aacute;. It was during his stay in the dwelling of Janaka that Duryodhana, the son of Dhritar&aacute;sht&#769;ra, learned from Balabhadra the art of fighting with the mace. At the expiration of three years, Ugrasena and other chiefs of the Y&aacute;davas, being satisfied that Krishn&#769;a had not the jewel, went to Videha, and removed Balabhadra's suspicions, and brought him home.</p>  
<p>Akr&uacute;ra, carefully considering the treasures which the precious jewel secured to him, constantly celebrated religious rites, and, purified with holy prayers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1157"></A><A HREF="#fn_1157"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>, lived in affluence for fifty-two years; and through the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_431"><font size="1" color="green">p. 431</font></A></p>  
<p>virtue of that gem there was no dearth nor pestilence in the whole country&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1158"></A><A HREF="#fn_1158"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>. At the end of that period, &#346;atrughna, the great grandson of Satwata, was killed by the Bhojas, and as they were in bonds of alliance with Akr&uacute;ra, he accompanied them in their flight from Dw&aacute;rak&aacute;. From the moment of his departure various calamities, portents, snakes, dearth, plague, and the like, began to prevail; so that he whose emblem is Gar&uacute;da called together the Y&aacute;davas, with Balabhadra and Ugrasena, and recommended them to consider how it was that so many prodigies should have occurred at the same time. On this Andhaka, one of the elders of the Yadhu race, thus spake: "Wherever &#346;waphalka, the father of Akr&uacute;ra, dwelt, there famine, plague, dearth, and other visitations were unknown. Once when there was want of rain in the kingdom of K&aacute;sir&aacute;j&aacute;, &#346;waphalka was brought there, and immediately there fell rain from the heavens. It happened also that the queen of K&aacute;&#347;&iacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; conceived, and was quick with a daughter; but when the time of delivery arrived, the child issued not from the womb. Twelve years passed away, and still the girl was unborn. Then K&aacute;&#347;&iacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; spake to the child, and said, 'Daughter, why is your birth thus delayed? come forth; I desire to behold you, why do you inflict this protracted suffering upon your mother?' Thus addressed, the infant answered, 'If, father, you will present a cow every day to the Brahmans, I shall at the end of three years more be born.' The king accordingly presented daily a cow to the Brahmans, and at the end of three years the damsel came into the world. Her father called her G&aacute;ndin&iacute;, and he subsequently gave her to &#346;waphalka, when he came to his palace for his benefit. G&aacute;ndin&iacute;, as long as she lived, gave a cow to the Brahmans every day. Akr&uacute;ra was her</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_432"><font size="1" color="green">p. 432</font></A></p>  
<p>son by &#346;waphalka, and his birth therefore proceeds from a combination of uncommon excellence. When a person such as he is, is absent from us, is it likely that famine, pestilence, and prodigies should fail to occur? Let him then he invited to return: the faults of men of exalted worth must not be too severely scrutinized."</p>  
<p>Agreeably to the advice of Audhaka the elder, the Y&aacute;davas sent a mission, headed by Ke&#347;ava, Ugrasena, and Balabhadra, to assure Akr&uacute;ra that no notice would be taken of any irregularity committed by him; and having satisfied him that he was in no danger, they brought him back to Dw&aacute;rak&aacute;. Immediately on his arrival, in consequence of the properties of the jewel, the plague, dearth, famine, and every other calamity and portent, ceased. Krishn&#769;a, observing this, reflected&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1159"></A><A HREF="#fn_1159"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> that the descent of Akr&uacute;ra from G&aacute;ndin&iacute; and &#346;waphalka was a cause wholly disproportionate to such an effect, and that some more powerful influence must be exerted to arrest pestilence and famine. "Of a surety," said he to himself, "the great Syamantaka jewel is in his keeping, for such I have heard are amongst its properties. This Akr&uacute;ra too has been lately celebrating sacrifice after sacrifice; his own means are insufficient for such expenses; it is beyond a doubt that he has the jewel." Having come to this conclusion, he called a meeting of all the Y&aacute;davas at his house, under the pretext of some festive celebration. When they were all seated, and the. purport of their assembling had been explained, and the business accomplished, Krishn&#769;a entered into conversation with Akr&uacute;ra, and, after laughing and joking, said to him, "Kinsman, you are a very prince in your liberality; but we know very well that the precious jewel which was stolen by Sudhanwan was delivered by him to you, and is now in your possession, to the great benefit of this kingdom. So let it remain; we all derive advantage from its virtues.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_433"><font size="1" color="green">p. 433</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> But Balabhadra suspects that I have it, and therefore, out of kindness to me, shew it to the assembly." When Akr&uacute;ra, who had the jewel with him, was thus taxed, he hesitated what he should do. "If I deny that I have the jewel," thought he, "they will search my person, and find the gem hidden amongst my clothes. I cannot submit to a search." So reflecting, Akr&uacute;ra said to N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a, the cause of the whole world, "It is true that the Syamantaka jewel was entrusted to me by &#346;atadhanwan, when he went from hence. I expected every day that you would ask me for it, and with much inconvenience therefore I have kept it until now. The charge of it has subjected me to so much anxiety, that I have been incapable of enjoying any pleasure, and have never known a moment's ease. Afraid that you would think me unfit to retain possession of a jewel so essential to the welfare of the kingdom, I forbore to mention to you its being in my hands; but now take it yourself, and give the care of it to whom you please." Having thus spoken, Akr&uacute;ra drew forth from his garments a small gold box, and took from it the jewel. On displaying it to the assembly of the Y&aacute;davas, the whole chamber where they sat was illuminated by its radiance. "This," said Akr&uacute;ra, "is the Syamantaka gem, which was consigned to me by &#346;atadhanwan: let him to whom it belongs now take it."</p>  
<p>When the Y&aacute;davas beheld the jewel, they were filled with astonishment, and loudly expressed their delight. Balabhadra immediately claimed the jewel as his property jointly with Achyuta, as formerly agreed upon; whilst Satyabh&aacute;m&aacute;, demanded it as her right, as it had originally belonged to her father. Between these two Krishn&#769;a considered himself as an ox between the two wheels of a cart, and thus spake to Akr&uacute;ra in the presence of all the Y&aacute;davas: "This jewel has been exhibited to the assembly in order to clear my reputation; it is the joint right of Balabhadra and myself, and is the patrimonial inheritance of Satyabh&aacute;m&aacute;. But this jewel, to be of advantage to the whole kingdom, should be taken charge of by a person who leads a life of perpetual continence: if worn by an impure individual, it will be the cause of his death. Now as I have sixteen thousand wives, I am not qualified to have the care of it. It is not likely that Satyabh&aacute;m&aacute; will agree to the</p>  
<p><a name="page_434"><font size="1" color="green">p. 434</font></A></p>  
<p>conditions that would entitle her to the possession of the jewel; and as to Balabhadra, he is too much addicted to wine and the pleasures of sense to lead a life of self-denial. We are therefore out of the question, and all the Y&aacute;davas, Balabhadra, Satyabh&aacute;m&aacute;, and myself, request you, most bountiful Akr&uacute;ra, to retain the care of the jewel, as you have done hitherto, for the general good; for you are qualified to have the keeping of it, and in your hands it has been productive of benefit to the country. You must not decline compliance with our request." Akr&uacute;ra, thus urged, accepted the jewel, and thenceforth wore it publicly round his neck, where it shone with dazzling brightness; and Akr&uacute;ra moved about like the sun, wearing a garland of light.</p>  
<p>He who calls to mind the vindication of the character of Krishn&#769;a from false aspersions, shall never become the subject of unfounded accusation in the least degree, and living in the full exercise of his senses shall be cleansed from every sin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1160"></A><A HREF="#fn_1160"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1152"></A><A HREF="vp106.htm#fr_1152">424:8</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata, Matsya, and V&aacute;yu <a name="page_425"><font size="1" color="green">p. 425</font></A> agree in the main, as to the genealogy that follows, with our text. The V&aacute;yu states that Vrishn&#769;i had two wives, M&aacute;dr&iacute; and G&aacute;ndh&aacute;r&iacute;; by the former he had Yudh&aacute;jit and Anamitra, and by the latter Sumitra and Devam&iacute;d&#769;hush. The Matsya also names the ladies, but gives Sumitra to G&aacute;ndh&aacute;r&iacute;, and makes M&aacute;dr&iacute; the mother of Yudh&aacute;jit, Devam&iacute;d&#769;husha, Anamitra, and &#346;ini. The Agni has a similar arrangement, but substitutes Dhrisht&#769;a for Vrishn&#769;i, and makes him the fifteenth in descent from Satwata. The Linga, Padma, Br&aacute;hma P., and Hari V. have made great confusion by altering, apparently without any warrant, the name of Vrishn&#769;i to Krosht&#769;ri.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1153"></A><A HREF="vp106.htm#fr_1153">425:9</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata makes them sons of Yudh&aacute;jit; the Matsya and Agni, as observed in the preceding note, his brothers as well as Sumitra's.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1154"></A><A HREF="vp106.htm#fr_1154">428:10</A> This alludes to events detailed in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1156"></A><A HREF="vp106.htm#fr_1156">430:12</A> A rather violent anachronism to make Janaka cotemporary with Balar&aacute;ma.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1157"></A><A HREF="vp106.htm#fr_1157">430:13</A> The text gives the commencement of the prayer, but the commentator does not say whence it is taken: 'Oh, goddess! the <a name="page_431"><font size="1" color="green">p. 431</font></A> murderer of a Kshatriya or Vai&#347;ya, engaged in religious duties, is the slayer of a Brahman;' i. e. the crime is equally heinous. Perhaps the last word should be ### 'is.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1158"></A><A HREF="vp106.htm#fr_1158">431:14</A> Some of the circumstances of this marvellous gem seem to identify it with a stone of widely diffused celebrity in the East, and which, according to the Mohammedan writers, was given originally by Noah to Japhet; the Hijer al mattyr of the Arabs, Sang yeddat of the Persians, and Jeddah tash of the Turks, the possession of which secures rain and fertility. The author of the Habib us Seir gravely asserts that this stone was in the hands of the Mongols in his day, or in the tenth century.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1159"></A><A HREF="vp106.htm#fr_1159">432:15</A> Krishn&#769;a's reflecting, the commentator observes, is to be understood of him only as consistent with the account here given of him, as if he were a mere man; for, as he was omniscient, there was no occasion for him to reflect or reason. Krishn&#769;a however appears in this story in a very different light from that in which he is usually represented; and the adventure, it may be remarked, is detached from the place in which we might have expected to find it, the narrative of his life, which forms the subject of the next book.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1160"></A><A HREF="vp106.htm#fr_1160">434:16</A> The story of the Syamantaka gem occurs in the Bh&aacute;gavata, V&aacute;yu, Matsya, Br&aacute;hma, and Hari V., and is alluded to in other Pur&aacute;n&#769;as. It may be considered as one common to the whole series. Independently of the part borne in it by Krishn&#769;a, it presents a curious and no doubt a faithful picture of ancient manners, in the loose self-government of a kindred clan, in the acts of personal violence which are committed, in the feuds which ensue, in the public meetings which are held, and the part that is taken by the elders and by the women in all the proceedings of the community.</P>
