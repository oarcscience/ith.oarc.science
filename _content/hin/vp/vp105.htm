<p>is repeated: "Of all the husbands submissive to their wives, who have been or who will be, the most eminent is the king Jy&aacute;magha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1131"></A><A HREF="#fn_1131"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>, who was the husband of &#346;aivy&aacute;." &#346;aivy&aacute; was barren; but Jy&aacute;magha was so much afraid of her, that he did not take any other wife. On one occasion the king, after a desperate conflict with elephants and horse, defeated a powerful foe, who abandoning wife, children, kin, army, treasure, and dominion, fled. When the enemy was put to flight, Jy&aacute;magha beheld a lovely princess left alone, and exclaiming, "Save me, father! Save me, brother!" as her large eyes rolled wildly with affright. The king was struck by her beauty, and penetrated with affection for her, and said to himself, "This is fortunate; I have no children, and am the husband of a sterile bride; this maiden has fallen into my hands to rear up to me posterity: I will espouse her; but first I will take her in my car, and convey her to my palace, where I must request the concurrence of the queen in these nuptials." Accordingly he took the princess into his chariot, and returned to his own capital.</p>  
<p>When Jy&aacute;magha's approach was announced, &#346;aivy&aacute; came to the palace gate, attended by the ministers, the courtiers, and the citizens, to welcome the victorious monarch: but when she beheld the maiden standing on the left hand of the king, her lips swelled and slightly quivered with resentment, and she said to Jy&aacute;magha, "Who is this light-hearted damsel that is with you in the chariot?" The king unprepared with a reply,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_422"><font size="1" color="green">p. 422</font></A></p>  
<p>made answer precipitately, through fear of his queen; "This is my daughter-in-law." "I have never had a son," rejoined &#346;aivy&aacute;, "and you have no other children. Of what son of yours then is this girl the wife?" The king disconcerted by the jealousy and anger which the words of &#346;aivy&aacute; displayed, made this reply to her in order to prevent further contention; "She is the young bride of the future son whom thou shalt bring forth." Hearing this, &#346;aivy&aacute; smiled gently, and said, "So be it;" and the king entered into his great palace.</p>  
<p>In consequence of this conversation regarding the birth of a son having taken place in an auspicious conjunction, aspect, and season, the queen, although passed the time of women, became shortly afterwards pregnant, and bore a son. His father named him Vidarbha, and married him to the damsel he had brought home. They had three sons, Kratha, Kai&#347;ika&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1132"></A><A HREF="#fn_1132"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>, and Romap&aacute;da&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1133"></A><A HREF="#fn_1133"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>.

<P><A NAME="fn_1124"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1124">420:6</A> The text states this in plain prose, but the V&aacute;yu quotes a verse which makes out but a hundred&nbsp;hundred or 10,000 sons.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1125"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1125">420:7</A> The Matsya has the first, third, and fifth of our text, and Prithudharma, Prithuk&iacute;rtti, and Prithumat. The K&uacute;rma has also six names, but makes as many successions.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1126"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1126">420:8</A> Suyajna: Agni, Br&aacute;hma, Matsya. Dharma: Bh&aacute;gavata.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1127"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1127">420:9</A> Ushat: Br&aacute;hma, Hari V.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1128"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1128">420:10</A> &#346;it&iacute;kshu: Agni. &#346;ineyus: Br&aacute;hma. Purujit: Bh&aacute;gavata. The V&aacute;yu has Maruta and Kambalavarhish, brothers, instead.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1129"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1129">420:11</A> Considerable variety prevails here. The Br&aacute;hma and Hari V. have Marutta the R&aacute;jarshi (a gross blunder, see <A HREF="vp093.htm#page_352">p. 352</A>), Kambalavarhish, &#346;atapras&uacute;ti, Rukmakavacha: the Agni--Marutta, Kambalavarhish, Rukmeshu: whilst the Bh&aacute;gavata makes Ruchaka son of U&#347;anas, and father to the five princes who in the text are the grandsons of Rukmakavacha.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1130"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1130">420:12</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata has Rukmeshu, Rukman, Jy&aacute;magha, Prithu, and Purujit. The <a name="page_421"><font size="1" color="green">p. 421</font></A> V&aacute;yu reads the two last names Parigha and Hari. The Br&aacute;hma and Hari V. insert Parajit as the father of the five named as in the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1131"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1131">421:13</A> Most of the other authorities mention that the elder of the five brothers, Rukmeshu, succeeded his father in the sovereignty; and that the second, Prithurukman, remained in his brother's service. P&aacute;lita and Harita were set over Videha (Linga) or Tirhut, and Jy&aacute;magha went forth to settle where he might: according to the V&aacute;yu he conquered Madhyade&#347;a (the country along the Narmad&aacute;), Mekal&aacute;, and the &#346;uktimat mountains. So the Br&aacute;hma P. states that he established himself along the Rikshavat mountain, and dwelt in &#346;uktimati. He names his son, as we shall see, Vidarbha: the country so called is Berar, and amongst his descendants we have the Chaidyas or princes of Boghelkand, and Chandail, and Das&aacute;rha, more correctly perhaps Dasarn&#769;a, Chattisgher; so that this story of Jy&aacute;magha's adventures appears to allude to the first settlement of the Y&aacute;dava tribes along the Narmad&aacute;, more to the south and west than before.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1132"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1132">422:14</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata has Ku&#347;a; the Matsya, Kau&#347;ika: all the authorities agree in specifying three sons.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1133"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1133">422:15</A> Lomap&aacute;da: Agni.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1134"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1134">422:16</A> Vastu: V&aacute;yu. Kriti: Agni.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1135"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1135">422:17</A> &Aacute;huti: V&aacute;yu. Iti: Padma. Dyuti: Matsya. Bhriti: K&uacute;rma. This latter is singular in carrying on the line of Romap&aacute;da for twelve generations farther.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1136"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1136">422:18</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata, however, makes the princes of Chedi continuous from Romap&aacute;da; as, Babhru, Dhriti, U&#347;&iacute;ka, Chedi--the Chaidyas, amongst whom were Damaghosha and &#346;i&#347;up&aacute;la.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1137"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1137">422:19</A> Kumbhi: Padma.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1138"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1138">422:20</A> Dhrisht&#769;a: V&aacute;yu. Dhrisht&#769;i: Matsya,</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1139"></A><A HREF="vp105.htm#fr_1139">422:21</A> Nivritti: V&aacute;yu. Nidhriti: Agni. The Br&aacute;hma makes three sons, Avanta, Da&#347;&aacute;rha, and Balivrishahan. In the Linga it is said of Das&aacute;rha that he was 'destroyer of the host of copper (faced; European?) foes.'</P>
