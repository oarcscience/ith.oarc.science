### CHAP. XIV.

Descendants of Śini, of Anamitra, of Śwaphalka and Chitraka, of Andhaka.
The children of Devaka and Ugrasena. The descendants of Bhajamána.
Children of Śúra: his son Vasudeva: his daughter Prithá married to
Páńd́u: her children Yudhisht́hira and his brothers; also Karńa by Áditya.
The sons of Páńd́u by Mádrí. Husbands and children of Śúra's other
daughters. Previous births of Śiśupála.

THE younger brother of Anamitra was Śini; his son was Satyaka; his son
was Yuyudhána, also known by the name of Sátyaki; his son was Asanga;
his son was Túni <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1](#fn_1161); his son was
Yugandhara <span id="fr_1162"></span>[2](#fn_1162). These princes were
termed Śaineyas.

In the family of Anamitra, Priśni was born; his son was Śwaphalka <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[3](#fn_1163), the sanctity of whose character has
been described: the younger brother of Śwaphalka was named Chitraka.
Śwaphalka had by Gándiní, besides Akrúra, Upamadgu, Mridura, Śárimejaya,
Giri, Kshatropakshatra, Śatrughna, Arimarddana, Dharmadhris,
Dhrisht́asarman, Gandhamojávaha, and Prativáha. He had also a daughter,
Sutárá <span id="fr_1164"></span>[4](#fn_1164).

Devavat and Upadeva were the sons of Akrúra. The sons of Chitrika were
Prithu and Vipritha, and many others <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[5](#fn_1165). Andhaka had four sons, Kukkura,
Bhajamána, Śuchi <span id="fr_1166"></span>[6](#fn_1166),
Kambalavarhish. The son of Kukkura was Vrisht́a <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[7](#fn_1167); his son was Kapotaroman; his son was
Viloman <span id="fr_1168"></span>[8](#fn_1168);

<span id="page_436">p. 436</span>

his son was Bhava <span id="fr_1169"></span>[9](#fn_1169), who was also
called Chandanodakadundubhi <span id="fr_1170"></span>[10](#fn_1170); he
was a friend of the Gandharba Tumburu; his son was Abhijit; his son was
Punarvasu; his son was Áhuka, and he had also a daughter named Áhukí.
The sons of Áhuka were Devaka and Ugrasena. The former had four sons,
Devavat, Upadevá, Sudeva, and Devarakshita, and seven daughters,
Vrikadevá, Upadevá, Devarakshitá, Śrídevá, Śántidevá, Sahadevá, and
Devakí: all the daughters were married to Vasudeva. The sons of Ugrasena
were Kansa, Nyagrodha, Sunáman, Kanka, Śanku, Subhúmi, Rásht́rapála,
Yuddhamusht́hi, and Tusht́imat; and his daughters were Kansá, Kansavatí,
Sutanu, Rásht́rapálí, and Kankí.

The son of Bhajamána <span id="fr_1171"></span>[11](#fn_1171) was
Vidúratha; his son was Śúra; his son was Śamin <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[12](#fn_1172); his son was Pratíkshatra <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[13](#fn_1173); his son was Swayambhoja <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[14](#fn_1174); his son was Hridika, who had
Kritavarman, Śatadhanu, Devamíd́husha, and others <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[15](#fn_1175). Śúra, the son of Devamíd́husha  <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[16](#fn_1176), was married to Márishá, and had by
her ten sons. On the birth of Vasudeva, who was one of these sons, the
gods, to whom the future is manifest, foresaw that the divine being
would take a human form in his family, and thereupon they sounded with
joy the drums of heaven: from this circumstance Vasudeva was also called
Ánakadunbubhi <span id="fr_1177"></span>[17](#fn_1177). His brothers
were Devabhága, Devaśravas, Anádhrisht́i, Karundhaka, Vatsabálaka,
Śrinjaya,

<span id="page_437">p. 437</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Śyáma, Śamíka, and
Gańd́úsha; and his sisters were Prithá, Śrutadevá, Śrutakírttí,
Śrutaśravas, and Rájádhideví.

Śúra had a friend named Kuntibhoja, to whom, as he had no children, the
presented in due form his daughter Pritha. She was married to Pańd́u, and
bore him Yudhisht́hira, Bhíma, and Arjuna, who were in fact the sons of
the deities Dharma, Váyu (air), and Indra. Whilst she was yet unmarried,
also, she had a son named Karńa, begotten by the divine Áditya (the
sun). Pańd́u had another wife, named Mádrí, who had by the twin sons of
Áditya, Násatya and Dasra, two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[18](#fn_1178).

Śrutadevá was married to the Kárusha prince Vriddhaśarman, and bore him
the fierce Asura Dantavaktra. Dhrisht́aketu, raja of Kaikeya <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[19](#fn_1179), married Śrutakírtti, and had by her
Santarddana and four other sons, known as the five Kaikeyas. Jayasena,
king of Avanti, married Rájádhideví, and had Vinda and Anavinda.
Śrutaśravas was wedded to Damaghosha, raja of Chedi, and bore him
Śiśupála <span id="fr_1180"></span>[20](#fn_1180). This prince was in a
former existence the unrighteous but valiant monarch of the Daityas,
Hirańyakaśipu, who was killed by the divine guardian of creation (in the
man-lion Avatára). He was next the ten-headed sovereign Rávańa, whose
unequalled prowess, strength, and power were overcome by the lord of the
three worlds, Ráma. Having been killed by the deity in the form of
Rághava, he had long enjoyed the reward of his virtues in exemption from
an embodied state, but had now received birth once more as Śiśupála, the
son of Damaghosha, king of Chedi. In this character he renewed, with
greater inveteracy than ever, his hostile hatred towards the god
surnamed Puńd́arikáksha, a portion of the supreme being, who had
descended to lighten the burdens of the earth; and was in consequence
slain by him: but from the circumstance of his thoughts being constantly
engrossed by the supreme being, Śiśupála was united with him after
death; for the lord giveth to those to whom he is favourable whatever
they desire, and he bestows a heavenly and exalted station even upon
those whom he slays in his displeasure.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[435:1](vp107.htm#fr_1161) Bhúti: Váyu. Kuni:
Bhágavata. Dyumni: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[435:2](vp107.htm#fr_1162) The Agni makes
these all brother's sons of Satyaka, and adds another, Rishabha, the
father of Śwaphalka.

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[435:3](vp107.htm#fr_1163) The authorities are
not agreed here. Śwaphalka, according to the Agni, as just remarked,
comes from Śini, the son of Anamitra. The Bhágavata, instead of Priśni,
has Vrishńi, son of Anamitra; the Bráhma and Hari V. have Vrishńi; and
the Agni, Prishńi, son of Yudhájit. The Matsya also makes Yudhájit the
ancestor of Akrúra, through Rishabha and Jayanta. Yudhájit in the
Bráhma, &c. is the son of Krosht́ri.

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[435:4](vp107.htm#fr_1164) The different
authorities vary in the reading of these names, though they generally
concur in the number.

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[435:5](vp107.htm#fr_1165) The Matsya and
Padma call them sons of Akrúra, but no doubt incorrectly.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[435:6](vp107.htm#fr_1166) Śami: Váyu. Śaśi:
Matsya. Śini Agni. This last makes them the sons of Babhru, and calls
the first Sundara.

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[435:7](vp107.htm#fr_1167) Vrishńi: Bhágavata,
Váyu, Matsya, &c. Dhrisht́a: Agni. Dhrishńu: Bráhma, Hari V.

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[435:8](vp107.htm#fr_1168) The Bhágavata puts
Viloman first. The Linga makes it an epithet of Kapotaroman, saying he
was Vilomaja, 'irregularly begotten.' In place of Viloman we have
Raivata, Váyu; Taittiri, Matsya; Tittiri, Agni.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[436:9](vp107.htm#fr_1169) Nava: Agni. Bala:
Linga. Nala: Matsya. Tomas: Kúrma. Anu: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[436:10](vp107.htm#fr_1170) The Matsya, Váyu,
and Agni agree with our text. The Linga, Padma, and Kúrma read
Ánakadundubhi as a synonyme of Bala. The Bráhma and Hari V. have no such
name, but here insert Punarvasu, son of Taittiri. The Bhágavata has a
different series, or Anu, Andhaka, Dundubhi, Arijit, Punarvasu, Áhuka.

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[436:11](vp107.htm#fr_1171) This Bhajamána is
the son of Andhaka, according to all the best authorities; so the Padma
calls this branch the Ándhakas. The Agni makes him the son of Babhru.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[436:12](vp107.htm#fr_1172) Váta, Niváta,
Śamin: Váyu.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[436:13](vp107.htm#fr_1173) Sonáśwa: Matsya.
Sonáksha: Padma. Śini: Bhájavata.

<span id="fn_1174"></span>[436:14](vp107.htm#fr_1174) Bhojaka: Agni.
Bhoja: Padma.

<span id="fn_1175"></span>[436:15](vp107.htm#fr_1175) Ten sons: Matsya,
&c.

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[436:16](vp107.htm#fr_1176) Devárha: Váyu,
Padma, Agni, and Matsya; and a different series follows, or
Kambalavarhish, Asamaujas, Samaujas, Sudanstra, Suvaśa, Dhrisht́a,
Anamitra, Nighna, Satrájit. They all make Vasudeva the son of Śúra,
however; but the three first leave it doubtful whether that Śúra was the
son of Bhajamána or not. The Bhágavata and Bráhma agree with the text,
which is probably correct. The Bráhma has Śúra son of Devamíd́hush,
although it does not specify the latter amongst the sons of Hridika.

<span id="fn_1177"></span>[436:17](vp107.htm#fr_1177) Ánaka a larger,
and Dundubhi a smaller drum.

<span id="fn_1178"></span>[437:18](vp107.htm#fr_1178) The Mahábhárata is
the best authority for these circumstances.

<span id="fn_1179"></span>[437:19](vp107.htm#fr_1179) The Padma calls
him king of Kashmir.

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[437:20](vp107.htm#fr_1180) The Bráhma P. and
Hari V. make Śrutadevá mother of Śiśupála, and Prithukírtti of
Dantavaktra.
