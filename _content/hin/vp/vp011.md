7\. The Márkańd́eya Puráńa

7\. Márkańd́a or Márkańd́eya Puráńa. "That Puráńa in which, commencing
with the story of the birds that were acquainted with right and wrong,
every thing is narrated fully by Márkańd́eya, as it was explained by holy
sages in reply to the question of the Muni, is called the Márkańd́eya,
containing nine thousand verses <span id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54)."
This is so called from its

<span id="page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv</span>

being in the first instance narrated by Márkańd́eya Muni, and in the
second place by certain fabulous birds; thus far agreeing with the
account given of it in the Matsya. That, as well as other authorities,
specify its containing nine thousand stanzas; but my copy closes with a
verse affirming that the number of verses recited by the Muni was six
thousand nine hundred; and a copy in the East India Company's library
has a similar specification. The termination is, however, somewhat
abrupt, and there is no reason why the subject with which it ends should
not have been carried on farther. One copy in the Company's library,
indeed, belonging to the Guicowar's collection, states at the close that
it is the end of the first Khańd́a, or section. If the Puráńa was ever
completed, the remaining portion of it appears to be lost.

Jaimini, the pupil of Vyása, applies to Márkańd́eya to be made acquainted
with the nature of Vásudeva, and for an explanation of some of the
incidents described in the Mahábhárata; with the ambrosia of which
divine poem, Vyása he declares has watered the whole world: a reference
which establishes the priority of the Bhárata to the Márkańd́eya Puráńa,
however incompatible this may be with the tradition, that having
finished the Puráńas, Vyása wrote the poem.

Márkańd́eya excuses himself, saying he has a religious rite to perform;
and he refers Jaimini to some very sapient birds, who reside in the
Vindhya mountains; birds of a celestial origin, found, when just born,
by the Muni Śamíka, on the field of Kurukshetra, and brought up by him
along with his scholars: in consequence of which, and by virtue of their
heavenly descent, they became profoundly versed in the Vedas, and a
knowledge of spiritual truth. This machinery is borrowed from the
Mahábhárata, with some embellishment. Jaimini accordingly has recourse
to the birds, Pingáksha and his brethren, and puts to them the questions
he had asked of the Muni. "Why was Vásudeva born as a mortal? How was it
that Draupadí was the wife of the five Páńd́us? Why did Baladeva do
penance for Brahmanicide? and why were the children of Draupadí
destroyed, when they had Krishńa and Arjuna to defend them?" The answers
to these inquiries occupy a number of chapters, and form a sort of
supplement to the Mahábhárata; supplying,

<span id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span>

partly by invention, perhaps, and partly by reference to equally ancient
authorities, the blanks left in some of its narrations.

Legends of Vritrásura's death, Baladeva's penance, Hariśchandra's
elevation to heaven, and the quarrel between Vaśisht́ha and Viswámitra,
are followed by a discussion respecting birth, death, and sin; which
leads to a more extended description of the different hells than is
found in other Puráńas. The account of creation which is contained in
this work is repeated by the birds after Márkańd́eya's account of it to
Krosht́uki, and is confined to the origin of the Vedas and patriarchal
families, amongst whom are new characters, as Duhsaha and his wife
Mársht́i, and their descendants; allegorical personages, representing
intolerable iniquity and its consequences. There is then a description
of the world, with, as usual to this Puráńa, several singularities, some
of which are noticed in the following pages. This being the state of the
world in the Swáyambhuva Manwantara, an account of the other Manwantaras
succeeds, in which the births of the Manus, and a number of other
particulars, are peculiar to this work. The present or Vaivaswata
Manwantara is very briefly passed over; but the next, the first of the
future Manwantaras, contains the long episodical narrative of the
actions of the goddess Durgá, which is the especial boast of this
Puráńa, and is the text-book of the worshippers of Káli, Chańd́í, or
Durgá, in Bengal. It is the Chańd́í Pátha, or Durgá Máhátmya, in which
the victories of the goddess over different evil beings, or Asuras, are
detailed with considerable power and spirit. It is read daily in the
temples of Durgá, and furnishes the pomp and circumstance of the great
festival of Bengal, the Durgá pujá, or public worship of that
goddess <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55).

After the account of the Manwantaras is completed, there follows a
series of legends, some new, some old, relating to the sun and his
posterity; continued to Vaivaswata Manu and his sons, and their
immediate descendants; terminating with Dama, the son of
Narishyanta <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56). Of most of the persons
noticed, the work narrates particulars not found elsewhere.

<span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>

This Puráńa has a character different from that of all the others. It
has nothing of a sectarial spirit, little of a religious tone, rarely
inserting prayers and invocations to any deity, and such as are inserted
are brief and moderate. It deals little in precepts, ceremonial or
moral. Its leading feature is narrative, and it presents an
uninterrupted succession of legends, most of which, when ancient, are
embellished with new circumstances; and when new, partake so far of the
spirit of the old, that they are disinterested creations of the
imagination, having no particular motive; being designed to recommend no
special doctrine or observance. Whether they are derived from any other
source, or whether they are original inventions, it is not possible to
ascertain. They are most probably, for the greater part at least,
original; and the whole has been narrated in the compiler's own manner,
a manner superior to that of the Puráńas in general, with exception of
the Bhágavata.

It is not easy to conjecture a date for this Puráńa: it is subsequent to
the Mahábhárata, but how long subsequent is doubtful. It is
unquestionably more ancient than such works as the Brahmá, Padma, and
Náradíya Puráńas; and its freedom from sectarial bias is a reason for
supposing it anterior to the Bhágavata. At the same time, its partial
conformity to the definition of a Puráńa, and the tenor of the additions
which it has made to received legends and traditions, indicate a not
very remote age; and, in the absence of any guide to a more positive
conclusion, it may conjecturally be placed in the ninth or tenth
century.
