<p align="center"><font size="-1" color="green">Form of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as</font></p>  
<p>The invariable form of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as is that of a dialogue, in which some person relates its contents in reply to the inquiries of another. This dialogue is interwoven with others, which are repeated as having been held on other occasions between different individuals, in consequence of similar questions having been asked. The immediate narrator is commonly, though not constantly, Lomaharshan&#769;a or Romaharshan&#769;a, the disciple of Vy&aacute;sa, who is supposed to communicate what was imparted to him by his preceptor, as he had heard it from some other sage. Vy&aacute;sa, as will be seen in the body of the work&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>, is a generic title, meaning an 'arranger' or 'compiler.' It is in this age applied to Krishn&#769;a Dwaip&aacute;yana,</p>

<p>the son of Par&aacute;&#347;ara, who is said to have taught the Vedas and Pur&aacute;n&#769;as to various disciples, but who appears to have been the head of a college or school, under whom various learned men gave to the sacred literature of the Hindus the form in which it now presents itself. In this task the disciples, as they are termed, of Vy&aacute;sa were rather his colleagues and coadjutors, for they were already conversant with what he is fabled to have taught them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>; and amongst them, Lomaharshan&#769;a represents the class of persons who were especially charged with the record of political and temporal events. He is called S&uacute;ta, as if it was a proper name; but it is more correctly a title; and Lomaharshan&#769;a was 'a S&uacute;ta,' that is, a bard or panegyrist, who was created, according to our text&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A>, to celebrate the exploits of princes; and who, according to the V&aacute;yu and Padma Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, has a right by birth and profession to narrate the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, in preference even to the Brahmans&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>. It is not unlikely therefore that we are to understand, by his being represented as the disciple of Vy&aacute;sa, the institution of some attempt, made under the direction of the latter, to collect from the heralds and annalists of his day the scattered traditions which they had imperfectly preserved; and hence the consequent appropriation of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, in a great measure, to the genealogies of regal dynasties, and descriptions of the universe. However this may be, the machinery has been but loosely adhered to, and many of the Patinas, like the Vishn&#769;u, are referred to a different narrator.</p>  
<p>An account is given in the following work&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> of a series of Paur&aacute;n&#769;ik compilations, of which in their present form no vestige appears. Lomaharshan&#769;a is said to have had six disciples, three of whom composed as many fundamental Sanhit&aacute;s, whilst he himself compiled a fourth. By a Sanhit&aacute; is generally understood a 'collection' or 'compilation.' The Sanhit&aacute;s of the Vedas are collections of hymns and prayers belonging to them, arranged according to the judgment of some individual sage, who is therefore looked upon as the originator and teacher of each. The Sanhit&aacute;s of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, then, should be analogous compilations, attributed respectively to Mitrayu, &#346;&aacute;n&#347;ap&aacute;yana, Akritavran&#769;a, and Romaharshan&#769;a: no such Paur&aacute;n&#769;ik Sanhit&aacute;s are now known, The</p>

<p>substance of the four is said to be collected in the Vishn&#769;u Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, which is also, in another place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>, itself called a Sanhit&aacute;: but such compilations have not, as far as inquiry has yet proceeded, been discovered. The specification may be accepted as an indication of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as having existed in some other form, in which they are no longer met with; although it does not appear that the arrangement was incompatible with their existence as separate works, for the Vishn&#769;u Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, which is our authority for the four Sanhit&aacute;s, gives us also the usual enumeration of the several Pur&aacute;n&#769;as.</p>
