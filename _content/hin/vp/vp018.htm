<p>14. V&aacute;mana Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. "That in which the four-faced Brahm&aacute; taught the three objects of existence, as subservient to the account of the greatness of Trivikrama, which treats also of the &#346;iva Kalpa, and which consists of ten thousand stanzas, is called the V&aacute;mana Pur&aacute;n&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A>."</p>  
<p>The V&aacute;mana Pur&aacute;n&#769;a contains an account of the dwarf incarnation of Vishn&#769;u; but it is related by Pulastya to N&aacute;rada, and extends to but about seven thousand stanzas. Its contents can scarcely establish its claim to the character of a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>There is little or no order in the subjects which this work recapitulates, and which arise out of replies made by Pulastya to questions put abruptly and unconnectedly by N&aacute;rada. The greater part of them relate to the worship of the Linga; a rather strange topic for a Vaishn&#769;ava Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, but engrossing the principal part of the compilation. They are however subservient to the object of illustrating the sanctity of certain holy places; so that the V&aacute;mana Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is little else than a succession of M&aacute;h&aacute;tmyas. Thus in the opening almost of the work occurs the story of Daksha's sacrifice, the object of which is to send &#346;iva to P&aacute;pamochana t&iacute;rtha at Benares, where he is released from the sin of Brahmanicide. Next conies the story of the burning of K&aacute;madeva, for the purpose of illustrating the holiness of a &#346;iva-linga at Kedare&#347;wara in the Himalaya, and of Badarik&aacute;&#347;rama. The larger part of the work consists of the Saro-m&aacute;h&aacute;tmya, or legendary exemplifications of the holiness of Sth&aacute;n&#769;u t&iacute;rtha; that is, of the sanctity of various Lingas and certain pools at Thanesar and Kurukhet, the country north-west from Delhi. There are some stories also relating to the holiness of the G&oacute;davar&iacute; river; but the general site of the legends is in Hindustan. In the course of these accounts we have a long narrative of the marriage of &#346;iva with Um&aacute;, and the birth of K&aacute;rtikeya. There are a few brief allusions to creation and the Manwantaras, but they are merely incidental; and all the five characteristics of a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a are deficient. In noticing the Sw&aacute;rochisha Manwantara, towards the end of the book, the elevation of Bali as monarch of the Daityas, and his subjugation of the universe, the gods included, are described; and this leads to the narration that gives its title to the Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, the birth of Krishn&#769;a as a dwarf, for the purpose of humiliating Bali by fraud, as he was invincible by force. The story is told as usual, but the scene is laid at Kurukshetra.</p>  
<p>A more minute examination of this work than that which has been given to it might perhaps discover some hint from which to conjecture its date. It is of a more tolerant character than the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, and divides its homage between &#346;iva and Vishn&#769;u with tolerable impartiality. It is not connected, therefore, with any sectarial principles, and may have preceded their introduction. It has not, however, the air of any antiquity,</p>  
<p><a name="page_xlix"><font size="1" color="green">p. xlix</font></A></p>  
<p>and its compilation may have amused the leisure of some Brahman of Benares three or four centuries ago.</p>

Vans Kennedy, p. 293 et seq., it appears that his copy so far corresponds with mine, and the work is therefore probably the same: two copies in the Company's library also agree with mine.</P>
