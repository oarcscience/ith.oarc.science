<p align="center"><font size="-1" color="green">Classification of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as</font></p>  
<p>There is another classification of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as alluded to in the Matsya Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, and specified by the Padma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, but more fully. It is not undeserving of notice, as it expresses the opinion which native writers entertain of the scope of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, and of their recognising the subservience of these works to the dissemination of sectarian principles.. Thus it is said in the Uttara Khan&#769;d&#769;a of the Padma, that the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, as well as other works, are divided into three classes, according to the qualities which prevail in them. Thus the Vishn&#769;u, N&aacute;rad&iacute;ya, Bh&aacute;gavata, G&aacute;rud&#769;a, Padma, and V&aacute;r&aacute;ha Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, are S&aacute;twika, or pure, from the predominance in them of the Satwa quality, or that of goodness and purity. They are, in fact, Vaishn&#769;ava Pur&aacute;n&#769;as. The Matsya, K&uacute;rma, Linga, &#346;iva, Skanda, and Agni Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, are T&aacute;masa, or Pur&aacute;n&#769;as of darkness, from the prevalence of the quality of Tamas, 'ignorance,' 'gloom.' They are indisputably &#346;aiva Pur&aacute;n&#769;as. The third series, comprising the Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a, Brahma-vaivartta, M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya, Bhavishya, V&aacute;mana, and Brahm&aacute; Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, are designated as R&aacute;jasa, 'passionate,' from Rajas, the property of passion, which they are supposed to represent.. The Matsya does not specify which are the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as that come under these designations, but remarks that those in which the M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya of Hari or Vishn&#769;u prevails are S&aacute;twika; those in which the legends of Agni or &#346;iva predominate are T&aacute;masa; and those which dwell most on the stories of Brahm&aacute; are R&aacute;jasa. I have elsewhere stated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>, that I considered the R&aacute;jasa Pur&aacute;n&#769;as to lean to the S&aacute;kta division of the Hindus, the worshippers of &#346;akti, or the female principle; founding this opinion</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xiii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xiii</font></A></p>  
<p>on the character of the legends which some of them contain, such as the Durg&aacute; M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya, or celebrated legend on which the worship of Durg&aacute; or K&aacute;l&iacute; is especially founded, which is a principal episode of the M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya. The Brahma-vaivartta also devotes the greatest portion of its chapters to the celebration of R&aacute;dh&aacute;, the mistress of Krishn&#769;a, and other female divinities. Col. Vans Kennedy, however, objects to the application of the term S&aacute;kta to this last division of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, the worship of &#346;akti being the especial object of a different class of works, the Tantras, and no such form of worship being particularly inculcated in the Br&aacute;hma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A>. This last argument is of weight in regard to the particular instance specified, and the designation of &#346;akti may not be correctly applicable to the whole class, although it is to some of the series; for there is no incompatibility in the advocacy of a T&aacute;ntrika modification of the Hindu religion by any Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, and it has unquestionably been practised in works known as Upa-pur&aacute;n&#769;as. The proper appropriation of the third class of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, according to the Padma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, appears to be to the worship of Krishn&#769;a, not in the character in which he is represented in the Vishn&#769;u and Bh&aacute;gavata Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, in which the incidents of his boyhood are only a portion of his biography, and in which the human character largely participates, at least in his riper years, but as the infant Krishn&#769;a, Govinda, B&aacute;la Gop&aacute;la, the sojourner in Vrind&aacute;van, the companion of the cowherds and milkmaids, the lover of R&aacute;dh&aacute;, or as the juvenile master of the universe, Jagann&aacute;tha. The term R&aacute;jasa, implying the animation of passion, and enjoyment of sensual delights, is applicable, not only to the character of the youthful divinity, but to those with whom his adoration in these forms seems to have originated, the Gosains of Gokul and Bengal, the followers and descendants of Vallabha and Chaitanya, the priests and proprietors of Jagann&aacute;th and &#346;r&iacute;n&aacute;th-dw&aacute;r, who lead a life of affluence and indulgence, and vindicate, both by precept and practice, the reasonableness of the R&aacute;jasa property, and the congruity of temporal enjoyment with the duties of religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The Pur&aacute;n&#769;as are uniformly stated to be eighteen in number. It is said that there are also eighteen Upa-pur&aacute;n&#769;as, or minor Pur&aacute;n&#769;as; but</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xiv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xiv</font></A></p>  
<p>the names of only a few of these are specified in the least exceptionable authorities, and the greater number of the works is not procurable. With regard to the eighteen Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, there is a peculiarity in their specification, which is proof of an interference with the integrity of the text, in some of them at least; for each of them specifies the names of the whole eighteen. Now the list could not have been complete whilst the work that gives it was unfinished, and in one only therefore, the last of the series, have we a right to look for it. As however there are more last words than one, it is evident that the names must have been inserted in all except one after the whole were completed: which of the eighteen is the exception, and truly the last, there is no clue to discover, and the specification is probably an interpolation in most, if not in all.</p>  
<p>The names that are specified are commonly the same, and are as follows: 1. Br&aacute;hma, 2. P&aacute;dma, 3. Vaishn&#769;ava, 4. &#346;aiva, 5. Bh&aacute;gavata, 6. N&aacute;rada, 7. M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;a, 8. &Aacute;gneya, 9. Bhavishya, 10. Brahma-vaivartta, 11. Lainga, 12. V&aacute;r&aacute;ha, 13. Sk&aacute;nda, 14. V&aacute;mana, 15. Kaurma, 16. M&aacute;tsya, 17. G&aacute;rud&#769;a, 18. Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A>. This is from the twelfth book of the Bh&aacute;gavata, and is the same as occurs in the Vishn&#769;u&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A>. In other authorities there are a few variations. The list of the K.&uacute;rma P. omits the Agni Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, and substitutes the V&aacute;yu. The Agni leaves out the &#346;aiva, and inserts the V&aacute;yu. The Var&aacute;ha omits the G&aacute;rud&#769;a and Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a, and inserts the V&aacute;yu and Narasinha: in this last it is singular. The M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya agrees with the Vishn&#769;u and Bh&aacute;gavata in omitting the V&aacute;yu. The Matsya, like the Agni, leaves out the &#346;aiva.</p>  
<p>Some of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, as the Agni, Matsya, Bh&aacute;gavata, and Padma, also particularize the number of stanzas which each of the eighteen contains. In one or two instances they disagree, but in general they concur. The aggregate is stated at 400,000 slokas, or 1,600,000 lines. These are</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xv</font></A></p>  
<p>fabled to be but an abridgment, the whole amount being a krore, or ten millions of stanzas, or even a thousand millions. If all the fragmentary portions claiming in various parts of India to belong to the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as were admitted, their extent would much exceed the lesser, though it would not reach the larger enumeration. The former is, however, as I have elsewhere stated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A>, a quantity that an individual European scholar could scarcely expect to peruse with due care and attention, unless his whole time were devoted exclusively for many years to the task. Yet without some such labour being achieved, it was clear, from the crudity and inexactness of all that had been hitherto published on the subject, with one exception&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A>, that sound views on the subject of Hindu mythology and tradition were not to be expected. Circumstances, which I have already explained in the paper in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society referred to above, enabled me to avail myself of competent assistance, by which I made a minute abstract of most of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as. In course of time I hope to place a tolerably copious and connected analysis of the whole eighteen before Oriental scholars, and in the mean while offer a brief notice of their several contents.</p>  
<p>In general the enumeration of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as is a simple nomenclature, with the addition in some cases of the number of verses; but to these the Matsya Pur&aacute;n&#769;a joins the mention of one or two circumstances peculiar to each, which, although scanty, are of value, as offering means of identifying the copies of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as now found with those to which the Matsya refers, or of discovering a difference between the present and the past. I shall therefore prefix the passage descriptive of each Pur&aacute;n&#769;a from the Matsya. It is necessary to remark, however, that in the comparison instituted between that description and the Pur&aacute;n&#769;a as it exists, I necessarily refer to the copy or copies which I employed for the purpose of examination and analysis, and which were procured with some trouble and cost in Benares and Calcutta. In some instances my manuscripts</p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_xvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. xvi</font></A></p>  
<p>have been collated with others from different parts of India, and the result has shewn, that, with regard at least to the Brahm&aacute;, Vishn&#769;u, V&aacute;yu, Matsya, Padma, Bh&aacute;gavata, and K&uacute;rma Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, the same works, in all essential respects, are generally current under the same appellations. Whether this is invariably the case may be doubted, and farther inquiry may possibly shew that I have been obliged to content myself with mutilated or unauthentic works&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A>. It is with this reservation, therefore, that I must be understood to speak of the concurrence or disagreement of any Pur&aacute;n&#769;a with the notice of it which the Matsya P. has preserved.</p>
