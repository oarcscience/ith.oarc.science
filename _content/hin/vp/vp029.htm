<p>The fifth book of the Vishn&#769;u Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is exclusively occupied with the life of Krishn&#769;a. This is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, and is one argument against its antiquity. It is possible, though not yet proved, that Krishn&#769;a as an Avat&aacute;ra of Vishn&#769;u, is mentioned in an indisputably genuine text of the Vedas. He is conspicuously prominent in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, but very contradictorily described there. The part that he usually performs is that of a mere mortal, although the passages</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxi"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxi</font></A></p>  
<p>are numerous that attach divinity to his person. There are, however, no descriptions in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata of his juvenile frolics, of his sports in Vrind&aacute;van, his pastimes with the cow-boys, or even his destruction of the Asuras sent to kill him. These stories have all a modern complexion: they do not harmonize with the tone of the ancient legends, which is generally grave, and sometimes majestic: they are the creations of a puerile taste, and grovelling imagination. These Chapters of the Vishn&#769;u Pur&aacute;n&#769;a offer some difficulties as to their originality: they are the same as those on the same subject in the Brahm&aacute; Pur&aacute;n&#769;a: they are not very dissimilar to those of the Bh&aacute;gavata. The latter has some incidents which the Vishn&#769;u has not, and may therefore be thought to have improved upon the prior narrative of the latter. On the other hand, abridgment is equally a proof of posteriority as amplification. The simpler style of the Vishn&#769;u Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is however in favour of its priority; and the miscellaneous composition of the Brahm&aacute; Pur&aacute;n&#769;a renders it likely to have borrowed these chapters from the Vishn&#769;u. The life of Krishn&#769;a in the Hari-van&#347;a and the Brahma-vaivartta are indisputably of later date.</p>
