### CHAP. XII.

Descendants of Krosht́ri. Jyámagha's connubial affection for his wife
Śaivyá: their descendants kings of Vidarbha and Chedi.

KROSHT́RI, the son of Yadu <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1](#fn_1119), had a
son named Vrijinívat <span id="fr_1120"></span>[2](#fn_1120); his son
was Swáhí <span id="fr_1121"></span>[3](#fn_1121); his son was
Rushadru <span id="fr_1122"></span>[4](#fn_1122); his son was
Chitraratha; his son was Śaśavindu, who was lord of the fourteen great
gems <span id="fr_1123"></span>[5](#fn_1123); he had a hundred thousand
wives and a million of sons <span id="fr_1124"></span>[6](#fn_1124). The
most renowned of them were Prithuyaśas, Prithukarman, Prithujaya,
Prithukírtti, Prithudána, and Prithuśravas. The son of the last of these
six <span id="fr_1125"></span>[7](#fn_1125) was Tamas <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[8](#fn_1126); his son was Uśanas <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[9](#fn_1127), who celebrated a hundred sacrifices
of the horse; his son was Śiteyus <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[10](#fn_1128); his son was Rukmakavacha <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[11](#fn_1129); his son was Parávrit, who lead five
sons, Rukméshu, Prithurukman, Jyámagha, Pálita, and Harita <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[12](#fn_1130). To this day the following verse
relating to Jyámagha

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

is repeated: "Of all the husbands submissive to their wives, who have
been or who will be, the most eminent is the king Jyámagha <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[13](#fn_1131), who was the husband of Śaivyá."
Śaivyá was barren; but Jyámagha was so much afraid of her, that he did
not take any other wife. On one occasion the king, after a desperate
conflict with elephants and horse, defeated a powerful foe, who
abandoning wife, children, kin, army, treasure, and dominion, fled. When
the enemy was put to flight, Jyámagha beheld a lovely princess left
alone, and exclaiming, "Save me, father! Save me, brother!" as her large
eyes rolled wildly with affright. The king was struck by her beauty, and
penetrated with affection for her, and said to himself, "This is
fortunate; I have no children, and am the husband of a sterile bride;
this maiden has fallen into my hands to rear up to me posterity: I will
espouse her; but first I will take her in my car, and convey her to my
palace, where I must request the concurrence of the queen in these
nuptials." Accordingly he took the princess into his chariot, and
returned to his own capital.

When Jyámagha's approach was announced, Śaivyá came to the palace gate,
attended by the ministers, the courtiers, and the citizens, to welcome
the victorious monarch: but when she beheld the maiden standing on the
left hand of the king, her lips swelled and slightly quivered with
resentment, and she said to Jyámagha, "Who is this light-hearted damsel
that is with you in the chariot?" The king unprepared with a reply,

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

made answer precipitately, through fear of his queen; "This is my
daughter-in-law." "I have never had a son," rejoined Śaivyá, "and you
have no other children. Of what son of yours then is this girl the
wife?" The king disconcerted by the jealousy and anger which the words
of Śaivyá displayed, made this reply to her in order to prevent further
contention; "She is the young bride of the future son whom thou shalt
bring forth." Hearing this, Śaivyá smiled gently, and said, "So be it;"
and the king entered into his great palace.

In consequence of this conversation regarding the birth of a son having
taken place in an auspicious conjunction, aspect, and season, the queen,
although passed the time of women, became shortly afterwards pregnant,
and bore a son. His father named him Vidarbha, and married him to the
damsel he had brought home. They had three sons, Kratha, Kaiśika <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[14](#fn_1132), and Romapáda <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[15](#fn_1133). The son of Romapáda was Babhru <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[16](#fn_1134), and his son was Dhriti <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[17](#fn_1135). The son of Kaiśika was Chedi, whose
descendants were called the Chaidya kings <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[18](#fn_1136). The son of Kratha was Kunti <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[19](#fn_1137); his son was Vrishńi <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[20](#fn_1138); his son was Nirvriti <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[21](#fn_1139); his son was Dasárha; his son was
Vyoman; his son was Jímúta; his son was Vikriti <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[22](#fn_1140); his son was Bhímaratha; his son was
Navaratha <span id="fr_1141"></span>[23](#fn_1141); his son was
Daśaratha <span id="fr_1142"></span>[24](#fn_1142); his son was Śakuni;
his son was Karambhi; his son was Devaráta; his son was
Devakshatra <span id="fr_1143"></span>[25](#fn_1143); his son was
Madhu <span id="fr_1144"></span>[26](#fn_1144); his son was Anavaratha;
his

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

son was Kuruvatsa; his son was Anuratha; his son was Puruhotra; his son
was Anśu; his son was Satwata, from whom the princes of this house were
termed Sátwatas. This was the progeny of Jyámagha; by listening to the
account of whom, a man is purified from his sins.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1119"></span>[420:1](vp105.htm#fr_1119) In the Bráhma P.
and Hari V. we have two families from Krosht́ri; one which is much the
same as that of the text; the other makes short work of a long story, as
we shall again notice.

<span id="fn_1120"></span>[420:2](vp105.htm#fr_1120) Vajravat: Kúrma.

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[420:3](vp105.htm#fr_1121) Śánti: Kúrma.
Swáha: Matsya. Triśanku Linga.

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[420:4](vp105.htm#fr_1122) Vishánsu: Agni.
Rishabha: Linga. Kuśika: Kúrma. Ruśeku: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[420:5](vp105.htm#fr_1123) Or articles the
best of their kind; seven animate, and seven inanimate; a wife, a
priest, a general, a charioteer, a horse, an elephant, and a body of
foot soldiers; or, instead of the last three, an executioner, an
encomiast, a reader of the Vedas; and a chariot, an umbrella, a jewel, a
sword, a shield, a banner, and a treasure.

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[420:6](vp105.htm#fr_1124) The text states
this in plain prose, but the Váyu quotes a verse which makes out but a
hundred hundred or 10,000 sons.

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[420:7](vp105.htm#fr_1125) The Matsya has the
first, third, and fifth of our text, and Prithudharma, Prithukírtti, and
Prithumat. The Kúrma has also six names, but makes as many successions.

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[420:8](vp105.htm#fr_1126) Suyajna: Agni,
Bráhma, Matsya. Dharma: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[420:9](vp105.htm#fr_1127) Ushat: Bráhma, Hari
V.

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[420:10](vp105.htm#fr_1128) Śitíkshu: Agni.
Śineyus: Bráhma. Purujit: Bhágavata. The Váyu has Maruta and
Kambalavarhish, brothers, instead.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[420:11](vp105.htm#fr_1129) Considerable
variety prevails here. The Bráhma and Hari V. have Marutta the Rájarshi
(a gross blunder, see [p. 352](vp093.htm#page_352)), Kambalavarhish,
Śataprasúti, Rukmakavacha: the Agni--Marutta, Kambalavarhish, Rukmeshu:
whilst the Bhágavata makes Ruchaka son of Uśanas, and father to the five
princes who in the text are the grandsons of Rukmakavacha.

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[420:12](vp105.htm#fr_1130) The Bhágavata has
Rukmeshu, Rukman, Jyámagha, Prithu, and Purujit. The <span
id="page_421">p. 421</span> Váyu reads the two last names Parigha and
Hari. The Bráhma and Hari V. insert Parajit as the father of the five
named as in the text.

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[421:13](vp105.htm#fr_1131) Most of the other
authorities mention that the elder of the five brothers, Rukmeshu,
succeeded his father in the sovereignty; and that the second,
Prithurukman, remained in his brother's service. Pálita and Harita were
set over Videha (Linga) or Tirhut, and Jyámagha went forth to settle
where he might: according to the Váyu he conquered Madhyadeśa (the
country along the Narmadá), Mekalá, and the Śuktimat mountains. So the
Bráhma P. states that he established himself along the Rikshavat
mountain, and dwelt in Śuktimati. He names his son, as we shall see,
Vidarbha: the country so called is Berar, and amongst his descendants we
have the Chaidyas or princes of Boghelkand, and Chandail, and Dasárha,
more correctly perhaps Dasarńa, Chattisgher; so that this story of
Jyámagha's adventures appears to allude to the first settlement of the
Yádava tribes along the Narmadá, more to the south and west than before.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[422:14](vp105.htm#fr_1132) The Bhágavata has
Kuśa; the Matsya, Kauśika: all the authorities agree in specifying three
sons.

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[422:15](vp105.htm#fr_1133) Lomapáda: Agni.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[422:16](vp105.htm#fr_1134) Vastu: Váyu.
Kriti: Agni.

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[422:17](vp105.htm#fr_1135) Áhuti: Váyu. Iti:
Padma. Dyuti: Matsya. Bhriti: Kúrma. This latter is singular in carrying
on the line of Romapáda for twelve generations farther.

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[422:18](vp105.htm#fr_1136) The Bhágavata,
however, makes the princes of Chedi continuous from Romapáda; as,
Babhru, Dhriti, Uśíka, Chedi--the Chaidyas, amongst whom were Damaghosha
and Śiśupála.

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[422:19](vp105.htm#fr_1137) Kumbhi: Padma.

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[422:20](vp105.htm#fr_1138) Dhrisht́a: Váyu.
Dhrisht́i: Matsya,

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[422:21](vp105.htm#fr_1139) Nivritti: Váyu.
Nidhriti: Agni. The Bráhma makes three sons, Avanta, Daśárha, and
Balivrishahan. In the Linga it is said of Dasárha that he was 'destroyer
of the host of copper (faced; European?) foes.'

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[422:22](vp105.htm#fr_1140) Vikala: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[422:23](vp105.htm#fr_1141) Nararatha: Bráhma,
Hari V.

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[422:24](vp105.htm#fr_1142) Drid́haratha: Agni.
Devaráta: Linga.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[422:25](vp105.htm#fr_1143) Soma: Linga.
Devanakshatra: Padma.

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[422:26](vp105.htm#fr_1144) There is great
variety in the succeeding appellations: <span id="page_423">p.

Purushaprabhu, Manwat, Pratarddana, Satwata; and the Agni, Dravavasu,
Puruhuta, Jantu, and Sátwata. Some of these originate, no doubt, in the
blunders of copyists, but they cannot all be referred to that source.
