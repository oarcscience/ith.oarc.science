### CHAP. XI.

The Yádava race, or descendants of Yadu. Kárttavírya obtains a boon from
Dattátreya: takes Rávańa prisoner: is killed by Paraśuráma: his
descendants.

I WILL first relate to you the family of Yadu, the eldest son of Yayáti,
in which the eternal immutable Vishńu descended upon earth in a portion
of his essence <span id="fr_1099"></span>[1](#fn_1099); of which the
glory cannot be described, though for ever hymned in order to confer the
fruit of all their wishes--whether they desired virtue, wealth,
pleasure, or liberation--upon all created beings, upon men, saints,
heavenly quiristers, spirits of evil, nymphs, centaurs, serpents, birds,
demons, gods, sages, Brahmans, and ascetics. Whoever hears the account
of the race of Yadu shall be released from all sin; for the supreme
spirit, that is without form, and which is called Vishńu, was manifested
in this family.

Yadu had four sons, Sahasrajit, Krosht́i, Nala, and Raghu <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[2](#fn_1100). Śatajit was the son of the elder of
these, and he had three sons, Haihaya, Veńu <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[3](#fn_1101), and Haya. The son of Haihaya was
Dharmanetra <span id="fr_1102"></span>[4](#fn_1102); his son was
Kuntí <span id="fr_1103"></span>[5](#fn_1103); his son was Sáhanji <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[6](#fn_1104); his son was Mahishmat <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[7](#fn_1105); his son

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

was Bhadrasena <span id="fr_1106"></span>[8](#fn_1106); his son was
Durdama; his son was Dhanaka <span id="fr_1107"></span>[9](#fn_1107),
who had four sons, Kritavíryya, Kritágni, Kritavarman, and Kritaujas.
Kritavíryya's son was Arjuna, the sovereign of the seven Dwípas, the
lord of a thousand arms. This prince propitiated the sage Dattátreya,
the descendant of Atri, who was a portion of Vishńu, and solicited and
obtained from him these boons--a thousand arms; never acting unjustly;
subjugation of the world by justice, and protecting it equitably;
victory over his enemies; and death by the hands of a person renowned in
the three regions of the universe. With these means he ruled over the
whole earth with might and justice, and offered ten thousand sacrifices.
Of him this verse is still recited; "The kings of the earth will
assuredly never pursue his steps in sacrifice, in munificence, in
devotion, in courtesy, and in self-control." In his reign nothing was
lost or injured; and so he governed the whole earth with undiminished
health, prosperity, power, and might, for eighty five thousand years.
Whilst sporting in the waters of the Narmadá, and elevated with wine,
Rávańa came on his tour of triumph to the city Máhishmatí, and there he
who boasted of overthrowing the gods, the Daityas, the Gandharbas and
their king, was taken prisoner by Kárttavírya, and confined like a tame
beast in a corner of his capital <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[10](#fn_1108). At the expiration of his long reign
Kárttavírya was killed by Paraśuráma, who was an embodied portion of the
mighty Náráyańa <span id="fr_1109"></span>[11](#fn_1109). Of the hundred
sons of this king, the five principal were Śúra <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[12](#fn_1110), Śúrasena, Vrishańa <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[13](#fn_1111), Madhu <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[14](#fn_1112), and

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jayadhwaja <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[15](#fn_1113). The son of the last was Tálajangha,
who had a hundred sons, called after him Tálajanghas: the eldest of
these was Vítihotra; another was Bharata <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[16](#fn_1114), who had two sons, Vrisha and
Sujátí <span id="fr_1115"></span>[17](#fn_1115). The son of Vrisha was
Madhu <span id="fr_1116"></span>[18](#fn_1116); he had a hundred sons,
the chief of whom was Vrishńi, and from him the family obtained the name
of Vrishńi <span id="fr_1117"></span>[19](#fn_1117). From the name of
their father, Madhu, they were also called Mádhavas; whilst from the
denomination of their common ancestor Yadu, the whole were termed
Yádavas <span id="fr_1118"></span>[20](#fn_1118).

<span id="fn_1099"></span>[416:1](vp104.htm#fr_1099) Or, 'in which
Krishńa was born.' It might have been expected, from the importance of
this genealogy, that it would have been so carefully preserved, that the
authorities would have closely concurred in its details. Although,
however, the leading specifications coincide, yet, as we shall have
occasion to notice, great and irreconcilable variations occur.

<span id="fn_1100"></span>[416:2](vp104.htm#fr_1100) The two first
generally agree. There are differences in the rest; as,

<div align="center">

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Bráhma and
Hari V. read Sahasráda for the first name; and the Linga has Balasani in
place of Nala. The Agni makes Śatajit also a son of Yadu.

<span id="fn_1101"></span>[416:3](vp104.htm#fr_1101) Veńuhaya:
Bhágavata, &c. Uttánahaya: Padma. Vet́t́ahaya: Matsya. They were the sons
of Sahasráda: Bráhma and Hari V.

<span id="fn_1102"></span>[416:4](vp104.htm#fr_1102) Dharmatantra: Váyu.
Dharma: Kúrma.

<span id="fn_1103"></span>[416:5](vp104.htm#fr_1103) Kírtti: Váyu.

<span id="fn_1104"></span>[416:6](vp104.htm#fr_1104) Sanjneya: Váyu.
Sankana: Agni. Sahanja of Sahanjani pura: Bráhma. Sanjnita: Linga.
Sanhana: Matsya. Sohanji: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1105"></span>[416:7](vp104.htm#fr_1105) By whom the city of
Máhíshmatí on the Narbadda was founded: Bráhma P., Hari V.

<span id="fn_1106"></span>[417:8](vp104.htm#fr_1106) So the Bhágavata;
but the Váyu, more correctly, has Bhadrasreńya. See [p.
407](vp101.htm#page_407). n. [12](vp101.htm#fn_1080).

<span id="fn_1107"></span>[417:9](vp104.htm#fr_1107) Kanaka: Váyu, &c.
Varaka: Linga. Andhaka: Kúrma.

<span id="fn_1108"></span>[417:10](vp104.htm#fr_1108) According to the
Váyu, Kárttavírya was the aggressor, invading Lanká, and there taking
Rávańa prisoner. The circumstances are more usually narrated as in our
text.

<span id="fn_1109"></span>[417:11](vp104.htm#fr_1109) See page 402.
Kárttavírya's fate was the consequence of an imprecation denounced by
Ápava or Vaśisht́ha, the son of Varuńa, whose hermitage had been burnt,
according to the Mahábhárata, Rája-dharma, by Chitrabhánu, or Fire, to
whom the king had in his bounty presented the world. The Váyu makes the
king himself the incendiary, with arrows given him by Súrya to dry up
the ocean.

<span id="fn_1110"></span>[417:12](vp104.htm#fr_1110) Urjjita:
Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1111"></span>[417:13](vp104.htm#fr_1111) Vrishabha:
Bhágavata. Dhrisht́a: Matsya. Dhrishńa: Kúrma. Prishokta: Padma. Vrishńi:
Linga. Krishńáksha: Bráhma.

<span id="fn_1112"></span>[417:14](vp104.htm#fr_1112) Krishńa, in all
except the Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1113"></span>[418:15](vp104.htm#fr_1113) King of Avanti:
Bráhma and Hari Vanśa.

<span id="fn_1114"></span>[418:16](vp104.htm#fr_1114) Ananta: Váyu and
Agni; elsewhere omitted.

<span id="fn_1115"></span>[418:17](vp104.htm#fr_1115) Durjaya only:
Váyu, Matsya.

<span id="fn_1116"></span>[418:18](vp104.htm#fr_1116) This Madhu,
according to the Bhágavata, was the son of Kárttavírya. The Bráhma and
Hari V. make him the son of Vrisha, but do not say whose son Vrisha was.
The commentator on the latter asserts that the name is a synonyme of
Payoda, the son of Yadu, according to his authority, and to that alone.

<span id="fn_1117"></span>[418:19](vp104.htm#fr_1117) The Bhágavata
agrees with our text, but the Bráhma, Hari V., Linga, and Kúrma make
Vrishańa the son of Madhu, and derive the family name of Vrishńis or
Várshńeyas from him.

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[418:20](vp104.htm#fr_1118) The text takes no
notice of some collateral tribes, which appear to merit remark. Most of
the other authorities, in mentioning the sons of Jayadhwaja, observe
that from them came the five great divisions of the Haihaya tribe.
These, according to the Váyu, were the Tálajanghas, Vítihotras,
Ávantyas, Tuńd́ikeras, and Játas. The Matsya and Agni omit the first, and
substitute Bhojas; and the latter are included in the list in the
Bráhma, Padma, Linga, and Hari V. For Játas the reading is Sanjátas or
Sujátas. The Bráhma P. has also Bháratas, who, as well as the Sujátas,
are not commonly specified, it is said, 'from their great number.' They
are in all probability invented by the compiler out of the names of the
text, Bharata and Sujáti. The situation of these tribes is central
India, for the capital of the Tálajanghas was Máhishmatí or
Chulí-Maheswar, still called, according to Col. Tod,
Sahasra-báhuki-basti, 'the village of the thousand-armed;' that is, of
Kárttavíryya. Annals of Rajasthan, I. 39. n. The Tuńd́ikeras and
Vítihotras are placed in the geographical lists behind the Vindhyan
mountains, and the termination -kaira is common in the valley of the
Narmadá, as Bairkaira, &c., or we may have Tuńd́ikera abbreviated, as
Tuńd́ari on the Tapti. The Ávantyas were in Ujayin, and the Bhojas were
in the neighbourhood probably of Dhár in Malwa. These tribes must have
preceded, then, the Rajput tribes, by whom these countries are now
occupied, or Rahtores, Chauhans, Pawars, Gehlotes, and the rest. There
are still some vestiges of them, and a tribe of Haihayas still exists,
at the top of the valley of Sohagpur in Bhagel-khańd́, aware of their
ancient lineage, and though <span id="page_419">p. 419</span> few in
number, celebrated for their valour. Tod's Rajasthan, I. 39. The scope
of the traditions regarding them, especially of their overrunning the
country, along with Śakas and other foreign tribes, in the reign
preceding that of Sagara (see p. 373), indicates their foreign origin
also; and if we might trust to verbal resemblances, we might suspect
that the Hayas and Haihayas of the Hindus had some connexion with the
Hia, Hoiei-ke, Hoiei-hu, and similarly denominated Hun or Turk tribes,
who make a figure in Chinese history. Des Guignes, Histoire des Huns, I.
7, 55, 231. II. 253, &c. At the same time it is to be observed that
these tribes do not make their appearance until some centuries after the
Christian era, and the scene of their first exploits is far from the
frontiers of India: the coincidence of appellation may be therefore
merely accidental. In the word Haya, which properly means 'a horse,' it
is not impossible, however, that we have a confirmatory evidence of the
Scythian origin of the Haihayas, as Col. Tod supposed; although we
cannot with him imagine the word 'horse' itself is derived from haya.
Rajasthan, I. 76.
