<p>13. Skanda Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. "The Sk&aacute;nda Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is that in which the six-faced deity (Skanda) has related the events of the Tatpurusha Kalpa, enlarged with many tales, and subservient to the duties taught by Mahe&#347;wara. It is said to contain eighty-one thousand one hundred stanzas: so it is asserted amongst mankind &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A>."</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xlvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. xlvi</font></A></p>  
<p>It is uniformly agreed that the Skanda Pur&aacute;n&#769;a in a collective form has no existence; and the fragments in the shape of Sanhit&aacute;s, Khan&#769;d&#769;as, and M&aacute;h&aacute;tmyas, which are affirmed in various parts of India to be portions of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, present a much more formidable mass of stanzas than even the immense number of which it is said to consist. The most celebrated of these portions in Hindustan is the K&aacute;&#347;&iacute; Khan&#769;d&#769;a, a very minute description of the temples of &#346;iva in or adjacent to Benares, mixed with directions for worshipping Mahe&#347;wara, and a great variety of legends explanatory of its merits, and of the holiness of K&aacute;&#347;&iacute;: many of them are puerile and uninteresting, but some are of a higher character. The story of Agastya records probably, in a legendary style, the propagation of Hinduism in the south of India: and in the history of Divod&aacute;sa, king of K&aacute;&#347;&iacute;, we have an embellished tradition of the temporary depression of the worship of &#346;iva, even in its metropolis, before the ascendancy of the followers of Buddha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A>, There is every reason to believe the greater part of the contents of the K&aacute;&#347;&iacute; Khan&#769;d&#769;a anterior to the first attack upon Benares by Mahmud of Ghizni. The K&aacute;&#347;&iacute; Khan&#769;d&#769;a alone contains fifteen thousand stanzas.</p>  
<p>Another considerable work ascribed in upper India to the Skanda Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is the Utkala Khan&#769;d&#769;a, giving an account of the holiness of Urissa, and the Kshetra of Purushottama or Jagann&aacute;tha. The same vicinage is the site of temples, once of great magnificence and extent, dedicated to &#346;iva, as Bhuvane&#347;wara, which forms an excuse for attaching an account of a Vaishn&#769;ava T&iacute;rtha to an eminently &#346;aiva Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. There can be little doubt, however, that the Utkala Khan&#769;d&#769;a is unwarrantably included amongst the progeny of the parent work. Besides these, there is a Brahmottara Khan&#769;d&#769;a, a Rev&aacute; Khan&#769;d&#769;a, a &#346;iva Rahasya Khan&#769;d&#769;a, a Himavat Khan&#769;d&#769;a, and others. Of the Sanhit&aacute;s, the chief are the S&uacute;ta Sanhit&aacute;, Sanatkum&aacute;ra Sanhit&aacute;, Saura Sanhit&aacute;, and Kapila Sanhit&aacute;: there are several other works denominated Sanhit&aacute;s.

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> M&aacute;h&aacute;tmyas are more numerous still&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A>. According to the S&uacute;ta Sanhit&aacute;, as quoted by Col. Vans Kennedy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A>, the Skanda Pur&aacute;n&#769;a contains six Sanhit&aacute;s, five hundred Khan&#769;d&#769;as, and five hundred thousand stanzas; more than is even attributed to all the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as. He thinks, judging from internal evidence, that all the Khan&#769;d&#769;as and Sanhit&aacute;s may be admitted to be genuine, though the M&aacute;h&aacute;tmyas have rather a questionable appearance. Now one kind of internal evidence is the quantity; and as no more than eighty-one thousand one hundred stanzas have ever been claimed for it, all in excess above that amount must be questionable. But many of the Khan&#769;d&#769;as, the K&aacute;&#347;&iacute; Khan&#769;d&#769;a for instance, are quite as local as the M&aacute;h&aacute;tmyas, being legendary stories relating to the erection and sanctity of certain temples or groups of temples, and to certain Lingas; the interested origin of which renders them very reasonably objects of suspicion. In the present state of our acquaintance with the reputed portions of the Skanda Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, my own views of their authenticity are so opposed to those entertained by Col. Vans Kennedy, that instead of admitting all the Sanhit&aacute;s and Khan&#769;d&#769;as to be genuine, I doubt if any one of them was ever a part of the Skanda Pur&aacute;n&#769;a.</p>
