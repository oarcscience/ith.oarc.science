Similar details of Auttami, T&aacute;masa, Raivata, Ch&aacute;kshusha, and Vaivaswata. The forms of Vishn&#769;u, as the preserver, in each Manwantara. The meaning of Vishn&#769;u.</FONT></p>  
<p>MAITREYA.--The disposition of the earth and of the ocean, and the system of the sun and the planets, the creation of the gods and the rest, the origin of the Rishis, the generation of the four castes, the production of brute creatures, and the narratives of Dhruva and Prahl&aacute;da, have been fully related by thee, my venerable preceptor. I am now desirous to hear from you the series of all the Manwantaras, as well as an account of those who preside over the respective periods, with &#346;akra, the king of the gods, at their head.</p>  
<p>PAR&Aacute;&#346;ARA.--I will repeat to you, Maitreya, in their order, the different Manwantaras; those which are past, and those which are to come.</p>  
<p>The first Manu was Sw&aacute;yambhuva, then came Sw&aacute;rochisha, then Auttami, then T&aacute;masa, then Raivata, then Ch&aacute;kshusha: these six Manus have passed away. The Manu who presides over the seventh Manwantara, which is the present period, is Vaivaswata, the son of the sun.</p>

<p>The Manu of the present period is the wise lord of obsequies, the illustrious offspring of the sun: the deities are the &Aacute;dityas, Vasus, and Rudras; their sovereign is Purandara: Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, Ka&#347;yapa, Atri, Jamadagni, Gautama, Vi&#347;w&aacute;mitra, and Bharadw&aacute;ja are the seven Rishis: and the nine pious sons of Vaivaswata Manu are the kings Ikshw&aacute;ku, Nabhaga, Dhrisht&#769;a, Sany&aacute;ti, Narishyanta, N&aacute;bhanidisht&#769;a, Karusha, Prishadhra, and the celebrated Vasumat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_762"></A><A HREF="#fn_762"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The unequalled energy of Vishn&#769;u combining with the quality of goodness, and effecting the preservation of created things, presides over all the Manwantaras in the form of a divinity. Of a portion of that divinity Yajna was born in the Sw&aacute;yambhuva Manwantara, the will-begotten progeny of &Aacute;k&uacute;t&iacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_763"></A><A HREF="#fn_763"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A>. When the Sw&aacute;rochisha Manwantara had arrived, that divine Yajna was born as Ajita, along with the Tushita gods, the sons of Tushit&aacute;. In the third Manwantara, Tushita was again born of Saty&aacute;, as Satya, along with the class of deities so denominated. In the next period, Satya became Hari, along with the Haris, the</p>

<p>children of Har&iacute;. The excellent Hari was again born in the Raivata Manwantara, of Sambh&uacute;ti, as M&aacute;nasa, along with the gods called Abh&uacute;tarajasas. In the next period, Vishn&#769;u was born of Vikunthi, as Vaikuntha, along with the deities called Vaikunthas. In the present Manwantara, Vishn&#769;u was again born as V&aacute;mana, the son of Ka&#347;yapa by Adit&iacute;. With three paces he subdued the worlds, and gave them, freed from all embarrassment, to Purandara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_764"></A><A HREF="#fn_764"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>. These are the seven persons by whom, in the several Manwantaras, created beings have been protected. Because this whole world has been pervaded by the energy of the deity, he is entitled Vishn&#769;u, from the root Vis, 'to enter' or 'pervade;' for all the gods, the Manus, the seven Rishis, the sons of the Manus, the Indras the sovereigns of the gods, all are but the impersonated might of Vishn&#769;u&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_765"></A><A HREF="#fn_765"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_743"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_743">259:1</A> The gods were said to be the Y&aacute;mas (<A HREF="vp041.htm#page_54">p. 54</A>); the Rishis were Mar&iacute;chi, Angiras, &amp;c. (<A HREF="vp041.htm#page_49">p. 49</A>. n. <A HREF="vp041.htm#fn_200">2</A>); and the sons were Priyavrata and Utt&aacute;nap&aacute;da (<A HREF="vp041.htm#page_53">p. 53</A>). The V&aacute;yu adds to the Yamas, the Ajitas, who share with the former, it observes, sacrificial <a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="green">p. 260</font></A> offerings. The Matsya, Padma, Br&aacute;hma P. and Hari Van&#347;a substitute for the sons, the grandsons of Sw&aacute;yambhuva, Agn&iacute;dhra and the rest (<A HREF="vp058.htm#page_162">p. 162</A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_744"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_744">260:2</A> This Manu, according to the legend of his birth in the M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya P., was the son of Swarochish, so named from the splendour of his appearance when born, and who was the son of the nymph Varuthin&iacute; by the Gandharba Kali. The text, in another place, makes him a son of Priyavrata.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_745"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_745">260:3</A> The V&aacute;yu gives the names of the individuals of these two classes, consisting each of twelve. It furnishes also the nomenclature of all the classes of divinities, and of the sons of the Manus in each Manwantara. According to the same authority, the Tushitas were the sons of Kratu: the Bh&aacute;gavata calls them the sons of Tushit&aacute; by Veda&#347;iras. The divinities of each period are, according to the V&aacute;yu, those to whom offerings of the Soma juice and the like are presented collectively.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_746"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_746">260:4</A> The V&aacute;yu describes the Rishis of each Manwantara as the sons, or in some cases the descendants in a direct line, of the seven sages, Atri, Angiras, Bhrigu, Ka&#347;yapa, Pulaha, Pulastya, and Va&#347;isht&#769;ha; with some inconsistency, for Ka&#347;yapa, at least, did not appear himself until the seventh, Manwantara. In the present series &Uacute;rja is the son of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, Stambha springs from Ka&#347;yapa, Pr&aacute;n&#769;a from Bhrigu, Dattoli is the son of Pulastya, Rishabha descends from Angiras, Ni&#347;chara from Atri, and Arvar&iacute;vat is the son of Pulaha. The Br&aacute;hma P. and Hari Van&#347;a have a rather different list, or Aurva, Stambha, Ka&#347;yapa, Pr&aacute;n&#769;a, Vrihaspati, Chyavana, and Dattoli; but the origin of part of this difference is nothing more than an imperfect quotation from the V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;a; the two first, Aurva and Stambha, being specified as the son of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha and the descendant of Ka&#347;yapa, and then the parentage of the rest being omitted: to complete the seven, therefore, Ka&#347;yapa becomes one of them. Some other errors of this nature occur in these two works, and from the same cause, a blundering citation of the V&aacute;yu, which is named as their authority. A curious peculiarity also occurs in these mistakes. They are confined to the first eight Manwantaras. The Br&aacute;hma P. omits all details of the last six, and the Hari Van&#347;a inserts them fully and correctly, agreeably to the authority of the V&aacute;yu. It looks, therefore, as if the compiler of the Hari Van&#347;a had followed the Br&aacute;hma, as far as it went, right or wrong; but had had recourse to the original V&aacute;yu P. when the Br&aacute;hma failed him. Dattoli is sometimes written Dattoni and Dattotri; and the latter appears to have been the case with the copy of the Hari Van&#347;a employed by M. Langlois, who makes one of the Rishis of this Manwantara, "le penitent Atri." He is not without countenance in some such reading, for the Padma P. changes the name to Datt&aacute;treya, no doubt suggested by Datta-atri. <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="green">p. 261</font></A> Datt&aacute;treya, however, is the son of Atri; whilst the V&aacute;yu calls the person of the text the son of Pulastya. There can be no doubt therefore of the correct reading, for the son of Pulastya is Dattoli. (<A HREF="vp045.htm#page_83">p. 83</A>.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_747"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_747">261:5</A> The V&aacute;yu agrees with the text in these names, adding seven others. The Bh&aacute;gavata has a different series. The Padma has four other names, Nabha, Nabhasya, Prasriti, Bhavana. The Br&aacute;hma has ten names, including two of these, and several of the names of the Rishis of the tenth Manwantara. The Matsya has the four names of the Padma for the sons of the Manu, and gives seven others, Hav&iacute;ndhra, Sukrita, M&uacute;rtti, Apas, Jyotir, Aya, Smrita (the names of the Br&aacute;hma), as the seven Praj&aacute;patis of this period, and sons of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha. The sons of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, however, belong to the third Manwantara, and bear different appellations. There is, no doubt, some blundering here in all the books except the V&aacute;yu, and those which agree with it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_748"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_748">261:6</A> The name occurs Auttami, Auttama, and Uttama. The Bh&aacute;gavata and V&aacute;yu agree with our text (<A HREF="#page_263">p. 263</A>) in making him a descendant from Priyavrata. The M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya calls him the son of Uttama, the son of Utt&aacute;nap&aacute;da: and this appears to be the correct genealogy, both from our text and the Bh&aacute;gavata.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_749"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_749">261:7</A> The Br&aacute;hma and Hari Van&#347;a have, in place of these, the Bh&aacute;nus; but the V&aacute;yu and M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya concur with the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_750"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_750">261:8</A> All the authorities agree in this; but the Br&aacute;hma and Hari Van&#347;a appear to furnish a different series also; or even a third, according to the French translation: 'Dans le troisi&egrave;me Manwantara parurent comme Saptarchis les fils de Vasichtha, de son nom appel&eacute;s V&acirc;sichthas, les fils de Hiranyagarbha et les illustres enfans d&#8217;Ourdja.' The text is, ### &amp;c. The meaning of which is, 'There were (in the first Manwantara) seven celebrated sons of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, who (in the third Manwantara) were sons of Brahm&aacute; (i. e. Rishis), the illustrious posterity of Urjj&aacute;. We have already seen that Urjj&aacute; was the wife of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, by whom she had seven sons, Rajas,' &amp;c. (see <A HREF="vp045.htm#page_83">p. 83</A>), in the Sw&aacute;yambhuva Manwantara; and these were born again as the Rishis of the third period. The names of these persons, according to the Matsya and Padma, are however very different from those of the sons of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, given <A HREF="vp045.htm#page_83">p. 83</A>, or Kaukundihi, Kurundi, Dalaya, &#346;ankha, Prav&aacute;hita, Mita, and Sammita.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_751"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_751">261:9</A> The V&aacute;yu adds ten other names to those of the text. The Br&aacute;hma gives ten <a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="green">p. 262</font></A> altogether different. The Bh&aacute;gavata an Padma have each a separate nomenclature.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_752"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_752">262:10</A> Of these, the Br&aacute;hma and Hari V notice only the Satyas: the Matsya and Padma have only S&aacute;dhyas. The V&aacute;yu Bh&aacute;gavata, K&uacute;rma, and M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya agree with the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_753"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_753">262:11</A> He is the son of Priyavrata, according to the text, the V&aacute;yu, &amp;c. The M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya has a legend of his birth by a doe; and from his being begotten in dark, tempestuous weather, he derives his name.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_754"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_754">262:12</A> Severally, according to the V&aacute;yu, the progeny of Bhrigu, Ka&#347;yapa, Angiras, Pulastya, Atri, Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, and Pulaha. There is considerable variety in some of the names. Thus the Matsya has Kavi, Prithu, Agni, Salpa, Dh&iacute;mat, Kapi, Akapi. The Hari Van&#347;a has K&aacute;vya, Prithu, Agni, Jahnu, Dh&aacute;tri, Kapivat, Akapivat. For the two last the V&aacute;yu reads G&aacute;tra and Vanap&iacute;tha. The son of Pulaha is in his place (<A HREF="vp045.htm#page_83">p. 83</A>. n. <A HREF="vp045.htm#fn_245">6</A>), Arvar&iacute;vat or Vanakap&iacute;vat. G&aacute;tra is amongst the sons of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha (<A HREF="vp045.htm#page_83">p. 83</A>). The V&aacute;yu is therefore probably most correct, although our text, in regard to these two denominations, admits of no doubt.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_755"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_755">262:13</A> The V&aacute;yu, &amp;c. agree with the text; the V&aacute;yu naming eleven. The Br&aacute;hma, Matsya, and Padma have a series of ten names, Sutapas, Tapom&uacute;la, &amp;c.; of which, seven are the Rishis of the twelfth Manwantara.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_756"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_756">262:14</A> Raivata, as well as his three predecessors, is regarded usually as a descendant of Priyavrata. The M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya has a long legend of his birth, as the son of king Durgama by the nymph Revat&iacute;, sprung from the constellation Revat&iacute;, whom Ritav&aacute;ch, a Muni, caused to fall from heaven. Her radiance became a lake on mount Kumuda, thence called Raivataka; and from it appeared the damsel, who was brought up by Pramucha Muni. Upon the marriage of Revat&iacute;, the Muni, at her request, restored the asterism to its place in the skies.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_757"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_757">262:15</A> The Br&aacute;hma inserts of these only the Abh&uacute;tarajasas, with the remark, that 'they were of like nature (with their name):' i. e. they were exempt from the quality of passion. M. Langlois, in rendering the parallel passage of the Hari Van&#347;a, has confounded the epithet and the subject: 'dont les dieux furent les Pracritis, d&eacute;pourvu de <a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="green">p. 263</font></A> colere et de passion.' He is also at a loss what to do with the terms P&aacute;riplava and Raibhya, in the following passage; ### asking, 'qu&#8217;est ce que P&aacute;riplava? qu&#8217;est ce que R&ecirc;bhya?' If he had had the commentary at hand, these questions would have been unnecessary: they are there said to be two classes of divinities.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_758"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_758">263:16</A> There is less variety in these names than usual. Vedab&aacute;hu is read Devab&aacute;hu; Sudh&aacute;man, Satyanetra; and Mah&aacute;muni, Muni, Yajur, V&aacute;&#347;isht&#769;ha, and Yadudhra. According to the V&aacute;yu, those of the text are respectively of the lineage of Angiras, Bhrigu, Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, Pulastya, Atri, Pulaha, and Ka&#347;yapa. There is considerable variety in the names of the Manu's sons.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_760"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_760">263:18</A> The authorities agree as to the number, but differ as to the names; reading for &Aacute;dyas, &Aacute;ry&aacute;s and &Aacute;pyas; for Prast&uacute;tas, Prabh&uacute;tas and Pras&uacute;tas; for Prithugas, Prithukas and Prithusas; and, which is a more wide deviation, Ribhus for Bhavyas. M. Langlois omits the Pras&uacute;tas, and inserts Divaukasas; but the latter, meaning 'divinities,' is only an epithet. The Hari Van&#347;a has, ###---. The comment adds, ###.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_761"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_761">263:19</A> The V&aacute;yu reads Sudh&aacute;man for the first name; Unnata for Uttama; and Abhim&aacute;na for Abhin&aacute;man. The latter occurs also Abhin&aacute;min (Matsya) and Atin&aacute;man (Hari V.) The latter reads, no doubt incorrectly, Bhrigu, Nabha, and <a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="green">p. 264</font></A> Vivaswat for Uttama, Madhu, and Havishmat. The sons of Ch&aacute;kshusha are enumerated, <A HREF="vp048.htm#page_98">p. 98</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_762"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_762">264:20</A> There is no great variety of nomenclature in this Manwantara. The V&aacute;yu adds to the deities the S&aacute;dhyas, Vi&#347;was, Maruts, and gods sprung from Bhrigu and Angiras. The Bh&aacute;gavata adds the Ribhus: and most include the two &Aacute;swins as a class. Of the Maruts, however, the Hari Van&#347;a remarks that they are born in every Manwantara, seven times seven (or forty-nine); that in each Manwantara four times seven, or twenty-eight, obtain emancipation, but their places are filled up by persons reborn in that character. So the commentator explains the passages ### and ### &amp;c. ### Comment. ### Comment. It may be suspected, however, that these passages have been derived from the simple statement of the Matsya, that in all the Manwantaras classes of Rishis appear by seven and seven, and having established a code of law and morality, depart to felicity. The V&aacute;yu has a rather different list of the seven Rishis; or Vasumat, the son of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha; Vats&aacute;ra, descended from Ka&#347;yapa; Vi&#347;w&aacute;mitra, the son of G&aacute;dhi, and of the Ku&#347;ika race; Jamadagni, son of Kuru, of the race of Bhrigu; Bharadw&aacute;ja, son of Vrihaspati; &#346;aradwat, son of Gautama, of the family of Utatthya; and Brahmakosha or Atri, descended from Brahm&aacute;. All the other authorities agree with our text.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_764"></A><A HREF="vp075.htm#fr_764">265:22</A> There is no further account of this incarnation in the Vishn&#769;u Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. Fuller details occur in the Bh&aacute;gavata, K&uacute;rma, Matsya, and V&aacute;mana Pur&aacute;n&#769;as. The first of these (b. VIII. c. 15-23) relates the penance and sacrifices of Bali, son of Virochana, by which he had overcome Indra and the gods, and obtained supreme dominion over the three spheres. Vishn&#769;u, at the request of the deities, was born as a dwarf, V&aacute;mana, the son of Adit&iacute; by Ka&#347;yapa; who, applying to Bali for alms, was promised by the prince whatever he might demand, notwithstanding &#346;ukra, the preceptor of the Daityas, apprised him whom he had to deal with. The dwarf demanded as much space as he could step over at three steps; and upon the assent of Bali, enlarged himself to such dimensions as to stride over the three worlds. Being worshipped however by Bali and his ancestor Prahl&aacute;da, he conceded to them the sovereignty of P&aacute;t&aacute;la.</P>
