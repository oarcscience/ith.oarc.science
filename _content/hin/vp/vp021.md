*The Vishnu Purana*, translated by Horace Hayman Wilson, \[1840\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

17\. The Gárud́a Puráńa

17\. Gárud́a Puráńa. "That which Vishńu recited in the Gárud́a Kalpa,
relating chiefly to the birth of Gárud́a from Vinatá, is here called the
Gárud́a Puráńa; and in it there are read nineteen thousand verses <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78)."

The Gárud́a Puráńa which has been the subject of my examination
corresponds in no respect with this description, and is probably a
different work, though entitled the Gárud́a Puráńa. It is identical,
however, with two copies in the Company's library. It consists of no
more than about seven thousand stanzas; it is repeated by Brahmá to
Indra; and it contains no account of the birth of Garuda. There is a
brief notice of the creation; but the greater part is occupied with the
description of Vratas, or religious observances, of holidays, of sacred
places dedicated to the sun, and with prayers from the Tántrika ritual,
addressed to the sun, to Śiva, and to Vishńu. It contains also treatises
on astrology, palmistry, and precious stones; and one, still more
extensive, on medicine. The latter portion, called the Preta Kalpa, is
taken up with directions for the performance of obsequial rites. There
is nothing in

<span id="page_liv">p. liv</span>

all this to justify the application of the name. Whether a genuine
Gárud́a Puráńa exists is doubtful. The description given in the Matsya is
less particular than even the brief notices of the other Puráńas, and
might have easily been written without any knowledge of the book itself,
being, with exception of the number of stanzas, confined to
circumstances that the title alone indicates.
