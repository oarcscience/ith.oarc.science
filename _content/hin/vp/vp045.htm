<p>MAITREYA.--Thou hast narrated to me, great Muni, all that I asked of thee: now resume the account of the creation subsequently to Bhrigu.</p>  
<p>PAR&Aacute;&#346;ARA.--Lakshm&iacute;, the bride of Vishn&#769;u, was the daughter of Bhrigu by Khy&aacute;ti. They had also two sons, Dh&aacute;tri and Vidh&aacute;tri, who married the two daughters of the illustrious Meru, &Aacute;yati and Niryati; and had by them each a son, named Pr&aacute;n&#769;a and Mrikan&#769;d&#769;a. The son of the latter was M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya, from whom Veda&#347;iras was born&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The son of Pr&aacute;n&#769;a was named Dyutimat, and his son was R&aacute;javat; after whom, the race of Bhrigu became infinitely multiplied.</p>  
<p>Sambh&uacute;ti, the wife of Mar&iacute;chi, gave birth to Paurnam&aacute;sa, whose sons were Virajas and Sarvaga. I shall hereafter notice his other descendants, when I give a more particular account of the race of Mar&iacute;chi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_240"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_240">82:1</A> The commentator interprets the text ### to refer to Pr&aacute;n&#769;a: 'Veda&#347;iras was born the son of Pr&aacute;n&#769;a.' So the Bh&aacute;gavata has ###. The Linga, the V&aacute;yu, and M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya, however, confirm our reading of the text, making Veda&#347;iras the son of M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya. Pr&aacute;n&#769;a, or, as read in the two former, P&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;u, was married to Pun&#769;d&#769;ar&iacute;k&aacute;, and had by her Dyutimat, whose sons were Srij&aacute;van&#769;a and Asruta or Asrutavran&#769;a. Mrikan&#769;d&#769;a (also read Mrikan&#769;d&#769;u) married Manaswin&iacute;, and had M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya, whose son, by Murddhany&aacute;, was Veda&#347;iras: he married P&iacute;var&iacute;, and had many children, who constituted the family, or Brahmanical tribe, of Bh&aacute;rgavas, sons of Bhrigu. The most celebrated of these was U&#347;anas, the preceptor of the Daityas, who, according to the Bh&aacute;gavata, was the son of Veda&#347;iras; but the V&aacute;yu makes him the son of Bhrigu by Paulom&iacute;, and born at a different period.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_241"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_241">82:2</A> Alluding especially to Ka&#347;yapa, the son of Mar&iacute;chi, of whose posterity a full detail is subsequently given. The Bh&aacute;gavata adds a daughter, Devakuly&aacute;; and the V&aacute;yu and Linga, four daughters, Tusht&#769;i, Pusht&#769;i, Twish&aacute;, and Apachiti. The latter inserts the grandsons of Paurnam&aacute;sa. Virajas, married to Gaur&iacute;, has Sudh&aacute;man, a Lokap&aacute;la, or ruler of the east quarter; and Parvasa (quasi Sarvaga) has, by Parvas&iacute;, Yajnav&aacute;ma and Ka&#347;yata, who were both founders of Gotras, or families. The names of all these occur in different forms in different MSS.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_242"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_242">83:3</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata adds, that in the Sw&aacute;rochisha Manwantara the sages Uttathya and Vrihaspati were also sons of Angiras; and the V&aacute;yu, &amp;c. specify Agni and K&iacute;rttimat as the sons of the patriarch in the first Manwantara. Agni, married to Sadwat&iacute;, has Parjanya, married to Mar&iacute;chi; and their son is Hiranyaroman, a Lokap&aacute;la. K&iacute;rttimat has, by Dhenuk&aacute;, two sons, Charishn&#769;u and Dhritimat.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_243"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_243">83:4</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata gives an account of Atri's penance, by which the three gods, Brahm&aacute;, Vishn&#769;u, and &#346;iva, were propitiated, and became, in portions of themselves, severally his sons, Soma, Datta, and Durv&aacute;sas. The V&aacute;yu has a totally different series, or five sons, Satyanetra, Havya, &Aacute;pomurtti, Sani, and Soma; and one daughter, Sruti, who became the wife of Kardama.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_244"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_244">83:5</A> The text would seem to imply that he was called Agastya in a former Manwantara, but the commentator explains it as above. The Bh&aacute;gavata calls the wife of Pulastya, Havirbh&uacute;, whose sons were the Muni Agastya, called in a former birth Dahr&aacute;gni or Jat&#769;har&aacute;gni, and Visravas. The latter had by Ilavil&aacute;, the deity of wealth, Kuvera; and by Kesin&iacute;, the R&aacute;kshasas R&aacute;van&#769;a, Kumbhakarn&#769;a, and Vibh&iacute;shan&#769;a. The V&aacute;yu specifies three sons of Pulastya, Dattoli, Vedab&aacute;hu, and Vin&iacute;ta; and one daughter, Sadwat&iacute;, married (see note 3) to Agni.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_245"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_245">83:6</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata reads Karma&#347;resht&#769;ha, Var&iacute;yas, and Sahishn&#769;u. The V&aacute;yu and Linga have Kardama and Ambar&iacute;sha in place of the two first, and add Vanakap&iacute;vat and a daughter, P&iacute;var&iacute;, married to Veda&#347;iras (see note <A HREF="#fn_240">1</A>). Kardama married &#346;ruti (note <A HREF="#fn_243">4</A>), and had by her Sankhap&aacute;da, one of the Lokap&aacute;las, and a daughter, K&aacute;my&aacute;, married to Priyavrata (note <A HREF="vp041.htm#fn_204">6</A>, <A HREF="vp041.htm#page_53">p. 53</A>). Vana-kap&iacute;vat, also read Dhana-k. and Ghana-k., had a son, Sahishn&#769;u, married to Yasodhar&aacute;, and they were the parents of K&aacute;madeva.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_246"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_246">83:7</A> The different authorities agree in this place. The V&aacute;yu adds two daughters, Puny&aacute; and Sumat&iacute;, married to Yajnav&aacute;ma (see note <A HREF="#fn_241">2</A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_247"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_247">83:8</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata has an entirely different set of names, or Chitraketu, Surochish, Virajas, Mitra, Ulwana, Vasubhridy&aacute;na, and <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></A> Dyumat. It also specifies Saktri and others, as the issue of a different marriage. The V&aacute;yu and Linga have the same sons as in our text, reading Putra and Hasta in place of G&aacute;tra: they add a daughter, Pun&#769;d&#769;arik&aacute;, married to Pan&#769;d&#769;u (see note <A HREF="#fn_240">1</A>). The eldest son, according to the V&aacute;yu, espoused a daughter of M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya, and had by her the Lokap&aacute;la of the west, Ketumat. The seven sons of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha are termed in the text the seven Rishis, appearing in that character in the third Manwantara.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_248"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_248">84:9</A> The eldest son of Brahm&aacute;, according to the commentator, upon the authority of the Vedas. The V&aacute;yu P. enters into a very long detail of the names and places of the whole forty-nine fires. According to that, also, P&aacute;vaka is electric or Vaidynta fire; Pavam&aacute;na is that produced by friction, or Nirmathya; and &#346;uchi is solar, Saura, fire. Pavam&aacute;na was the parent of Kavyav&aacute;hana, the fire of the Pitris; &#346;uchi of Havyav&aacute;hana, the fire of the gods; and Pavam&aacute;na of Saharaksha, the fire of the Asuras. The Bh&aacute;gavata explains these different fires to be so many appellations of fire employed in the invocations with which different oblations to fire are offered in the ritual of the Vedas: ### explained by the commentator, ###.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_249"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_249">84:10</A> According to the commentator, this distinction is derived from the Vedas. The first class, or Agnishw&aacute;ttas, consists of those householders who, when alive, did not maintain their domestic fires, nor offer burnt-sacrifices: the second, of those who kept up the household flame, and presented oblations with fire. Manu calls these Agnidagdhas and the reverse, which Sir W. Jones renders, 'consumable by fire,' &amp;c. Kull&uacute;ka Bhat&#769;t&#769;a gives no explanation of them. The Bh&aacute;gavata adds other classes of Pitris; or, the &Aacute;jyapas, drinkers of ghee;' and Somap&aacute;s, drinkers of the acid juice.' The commentator, explaining the meaning of the terms S&aacute;gnayas and An&aacute;gnyas, has, ### which might be understood to signify, that the Pitris who are 'without fire' are those to whom oblations are not offered; and those 'with fire' are they to whom oblations are presented.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_250"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_250">84:11</A> The V&aacute;yu carries this genealogy forward. Dh&aacute;ran&iacute; was married to Meru, and <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></A> had by him Mandara and three daughters, Niyati, &Aacute;yati, and Vel&aacute;: the two first were married to Dh&aacute;tri and Vidh&aacute;tri (<A HREF="vp044.htm#page_81">p. 81</A>). Vel&aacute; was the wife of Samudra, by whom she had S&aacute;mudr&iacute;, married to Prach&iacute;navarhish, and the mother of the ten Prachetasas, the fathers of Daksha, as subsequently narrated. Men&aacute; was married to Him&aacute;vat, and was the mother of Main&aacute;ka, and of Gang&aacute;, and of P&aacute;rvati or Um&aacute;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_251"></A><A HREF="vp045.htm#fr_251">85:12</A> No notice is here taken of Sati, married to Bhava, as is intimated in c. 8 (<A HREF="vp042.htm#page_59">p. 59</A>), when describing the Rudras. Of these genealogies the fullest and apparently the oldest account is given in the V&aacute;yu P.: as far as that of our text extends, the two nearly agree, allowing for differences of appellation originating in inaccurate transcription, the names frequently varying in different copies of the same work, leaving it doubtful which reading should be preferred. The Bh&aacute;gavata, as observed above (<A HREF="vp041.htm#page_54">p. 54</A>. n. <A HREF="vp041.htm#fn_210">12</A>), has created some further perplexity by substituting, as the wives of the patriarchs, the daughters of Kardama for those of Daksha. Of the general statement it may be observed, that although in some respects allegorical, as in the names of the wives of the Rishis (<A HREF="vp041.htm#page_54">p. 54</A>); and in others astronomical, as in the denominations of the daughters of Anginas (<A HREF="#page_82">p. 82</A>); yet it seems probable that it is not altogether fabulous, but that the persons in some instances had a real existence, the genealogies originating in imperfectly preserved traditions of the families of the first teachers of the Hindu religion, and of the descent of individuals who took an active share in its propagation.</P>
