### CHAP. XII.

Indra comes to Gokula: praises Krishńa, and makes him prince over the
cattle. Krishńa promises to befriend Arjuna.

AFTER Gokula had been saved by the elevation of the mountain, Indra
became desirous of beholding Krishńa. The conqueror of his foes
accordingly mounted his vast elephant Airávata, and came to Govarddhana,
where the king of the gods beheld the mighty Dámodara tending cattle,
and assuming the person of a cow-boy, and, although the preserver of the
whole world, surrounded by the sons of the herdsmen: above his head he
saw Garud́a, the king of birds, invisible to mortals, spreading out his
wings to shade the head of Hari. Alighting from his elephant, and
addressing him apart, Śakra, his eyes expanding with pleasure, thus
spake to Madhusúdana: "Hear, Krishńa, the reason why I have come hither;
why I have approached thee; for thou couldest not otherwise conceive it.
Thou, who art the supporter of all, hast descended upon earth, to
relieve her of her burden. In resentment of my obstructed rites I sent
the clouds to deluge Gokula, and they have done this evil deed. Thou, by
raising up the mountain, hast preserved the cattle; and of a verity I am
much pleased, O hero, with thy wondrous deed. The object of the gods is
now, methinks, accomplished, since with thy single hand thou hast raised
aloft this chief of mountains. I have now come by desire of the
cattle <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1](#fn_1491), grateful for their
preservation, in order to install you as Upendra; and, as the Indra of
the cows, thou shalt be called Govinda <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[2](#fn_1492)." Having thus said, Mahendra took a
ewer from his elephant

<span id="page_529">p. 529</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Airávata, and with
the holy water it contained performed the regal ceremony of aspersion.
The cattle, as the rite was celebrating, deluged the earth with their
milk.

When Indra had, by direction of the kine, inaugurated Krishńa, the
husband of Śachí said to him affectionately, "I have thus performed what
the cows enjoined me. Now, illustrious being, hear what farther I
propose, with a view to facilitate your task. A portion of me has been
born as Arjuna, the son of Pritha: let him ever be defended by thee, and
he will assist thee in bearing thy burden. He is to be cherished by
thee, Madhusúdana, like another self." To this Krishńa replied, "I know
thy son, who has been born in the race of Bharata, and I will

<span id="page_530">p. 530</span>

befriend him as long as I continue upon earth. As long as I am present,
invincible Śakra, no one shall be able to subdue Arjuna in fight. When
the great demon Kansa has been slain, and Arisht́a, Keśin, Kuvalayápíd́a,
Naraka, and other fierce Daityas, shall have been put to death, there
will take place a great war, in which the burden of the earth will be
removed. Now therefore depart, and be not anxious on account of thy son;
for no foe shall triumph over Arjuna whilst I am present. For his sake I
will restore to Kunti all her sons; with Yudhisht́hira at their head,
unharmed, when the Bhárata war is at an end."

Upon Krishńa's ceasing to speak, he and Indra mutually embraced; and the
latter, mounting his elephant Airávata, returned to heaven. Krishńa,
with the cattle and the herdsmen, went his way to Vraja, where the wives
of the Gopas watched for his approach.

<span id="fn_1491"></span>[528:1](vp129.htm#fr_1491) Gobhischa chodita;
that is, 'delegated,' says the commentator, 'by the cow of plenty,
Kámadhenu, and other celestial kine, inhabitants of Goloka, the heaven
of cows:' but this is evidently unauthorized by the text, as celestial
cattle could not be grateful for preservation upon earth; and the notion
of Goloka, a heaven of cows and Krishńa, is a modern piece of mysticism,
drawn from such sectarial works as the Brahma Vaivartta P. and Hari
Vanśa.

<span id="fn_1492"></span>[528:2](vp129.htm#fr_1492) The purport of
Indra's speech is to explain the meaning of two of Krishńa's names,
Upendra and Govinda. The commentators on the Amara Kosha agree in <span
id="page_529">p. 529</span> explaining the first, the younger brother of
Indra, \#\#\# conformably to the synonyme that immediately follows in
the text of Amara, Indrávaraja; a name that occurs also in the
Mahábhárata: Krishńa, as the son of Devakí, who is an incarnation of
Adití, being born of the latter subsequently to Indra. Govinda is he who
knows, finds, or tends cattle; Gám vindati. The Pauráńik etymology makes
the latter the Indra (\#\#\# quasi \#\#\#) of cows; and in this capacity
he may well be considered as a minor or inferior Indra, such being the
proper sense of the term Upendra (Upa in composition); as, Upa-puráńa,
'a minor Puráńa,' &c. The proper import of the word Upendra has,
however, been anxiously distorted by the sectarian followers of Krishńa.
Thus the commentator on our text asserts that Upa is here synonymous
with Upari, and that Upendratwa, 'the station of Upendra,' means 'rule
in the heaven of heavens, Goloka;' a new creation of this sect, above
Satya-loka, which, in the uncorrupt Pauráńik system, is the highest of
the seven Lokas: see [p. 213](vp065.htm#page_213). So the Hari Vanśa
makes Indra say, 'As thou, Krishńa, art appointed, by the cows, Indra
superior to me, therefore the deities in heaven shall call thee
Upendra.' The Bhágavata does not introduce the name, though it no doubt
alludes to it in making the divine cow Surabhi, who is said to have come
from Goloka with Indra, address Krishńa, and say, 'We, instructed by
Brahmá, will crown you as our Indra.' Accordingly Krishńa has the water
of the Ganges thrown over him by the elephant of Indra, and Indra, the
gods, and sages praise him, and salute him by the appellation of
Govinda. The Hari Vanśa assigns this to Indra alone, who says, 'I am
only the Indra of the gods; thou hast attained the rank of Indra of the
kine, and they shall for ever celebrate thee on earth as Govinda.' All
this is very different from the sober account of our text, and is
undoubtedly of comparatively recent origin.
