He, that Brahma, was all things; comprehending in his own nature the indiscrete and discrete. He then existed in the forms of Purusha and of K&aacute;la. Purusha (spirit) is the first form, of the supreme; next proceeded two other forms, the discrete and indiscrete; and K&aacute;la (time) was the last. These four--Pradh&aacute;na (primary or crude matter), Purusha (spirit), Vyakta (visible substance), and K&aacute;la (time)--the wise consider to be the pure and supreme condition of Vishn&#769;u&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>.

<p>That chief principle (Pradh&aacute;na), which is the indiscrete cause, is called by the sages also Prakriti (nature): it is subtile, uniform, and comprehends what is and what is not (or both causes and effects); is durable, self-sustained, illimitable, undecaying, and stable; devoid of sound or touch, and possessing neither colour nor form; endowed with the three qualities (in equilibrium); the mother of the world; without beginning; and that into which all that is produced is resolved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>.

"There was neither day nor night, nor sky nor earth, nor darkness nor light, nor any other thing, save only One, unapprehensible by intellect, or That which is Brahma and Pum&aacute;n (spirit) and Pradh&aacute;na (matter)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A>." The two forms which are other than the essence of unmodified Vishn&#769;u, are Pradh&aacute;na (matter) and Purusha (spirit); and his other form, by which those two are connected or separated, is called K&aacute;la (time)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>. When discrete substance is aggregated in crude nature, as in a foregone dissolution, that dissolution is termed elemental (Pr&aacute;krita). The deity as Time is without beginning, and his end is not known; and from him the revolutions of creation, continuance, and dissolution unintermittingly succeed: for when, in the latter season, the equilibrium of the qualities (Pradh&aacute;na) exists, and spirit (Pum&aacute;n) is detached from matter, then the form of Vishn&#769;u which is Time abides&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>.

Elementary Egotism then becoming productive, as the rudiment of sound, produced from it Ether, of which sound is the characteristic, investing it with its rudiment of sound. Ether becoming productive, engendered the rudiment of touch; whence originated strong wind, the property of which is touch; and Ether, with the rudiment of sound, enveloped the rudiment of touch. Then wind becoming productive, produced the rudiment of form (colour); whence light (or fire) proceeded, of which, form (colour) is the attribute; and the rudiment of touch enveloped the wind with the rudiment of colour. Light becoming productive, produced the rudiment of taste; whence proceed all juices in which flavour resides; and the rudiment of colour invested the juices with the rudiment of taste.

This is the elemental creation, proceeding from the principle of egotism affected by the property of darkness. The organs of sense are said to be the passionate products of the same principle, affected by foulness; and the ten divinities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A> proceed from egotism affected by the principle of goodness; as does Mind, which</p>

<p>is the eleventh. The organs of sense are ten: of the ten, five are the skin, eye, nose, tongue, and ear; the object of which, combined with Intellect, is the apprehension of sound and the rest: the organs of excretion and procreation, the hands, the feet, and the voice, form the other five; of which excretion, generation, manipulation, motion, and speaking, are the several acts.</p>  
<p>Then, ether, air, light, water, and earth, severally united with the properties of sound and the rest, existed as distinguishable according to their qualities, as soothing, terrific, or stupifying; but possessing various energies, and being unconnected, they could not, without combination, create living beings, not having blended with each other. Having combined, therefore, with one another, they assumed, through their mutual association, the character of one mass of entire unity; and from the direction of spirit, with the acquiescence of the indiscrete Principle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A>, Intellect and the rest, to the gross elements inclusive, formed an egg&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A>, which gradually expanded like a bubble of water.

<p>excellent natural abode of Vishn&#769;u in the form of Brahm&aacute;; and there Vishn&#769;u, the lord of the universe, whose essence is inscrutable, assumed a perceptible form, and even he himself abided in it in the character of Brahm&aacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A>. Its womb, vast as the mountain Meru, was composed of the mountains; and the mighty oceans were the waters that filled its cavity. In that egg, O Brahman, were the continents and seas and mountains, the planets and divisions of the universe, the gods, the demons, and mankind. And this egg was externally invested by seven natural envelopes, or by water, air, fire, ether, and Ahank&aacute;ra the origin of the elements, each tenfold the extent of that which it invested; next came the principle of Intelligence; and, finally, the whole was surrounded by the indiscrete Principle: resembling thus the cocoa-nut, filled interiorly with pulp, and exteriorly covered by husk and rind.</p>  
<p>Affecting then the quality of activity, Hari, the lord of all, himself becoming Brahm&aacute;, engaged in the creation of the universe. Vishn&#769;u with the quality of goodness, and of immeasurable power, preserves created things through successive ages, until the close of the period termed a Kalpa; when the same mighty deity, Jan&aacute;rddana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A>, invested with the quality of darkness, assumes the awful form of Rudra, and swallows up the universe. Having thus devoured all things, and converted the world into one vast ocean, the Supreme reposes upon his mighty serpent couch amidst the deep: he awakes after a season, and again, as Brahm&aacute;, becomes the author of creation.</p>  
<p>Thus the one only god, Jan&aacute;rddana, takes the designation of Brahm&aacute;, Vishn&#769;u, and &#346;iva, accordingly as he creates, preserves, or destroys&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_114"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_114">7:1</A> The three hypostases of Vishn&#769;u. Hiran&#769;yagarbha is a name of Brahm&aacute;; he who was born from the golden egg. Hari is Vishn&#769;u, and &#346;ankara Siva. The Vishn&#769;u who is the subject of our text is the supreme being in all these three divinities or hypostases, in his different characters of creator, preserver and destroyer. Thus in the M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya: 'Accordingly, as the primal all-pervading spirit is distinguished by attributes in creation and the rest, so he obtains the denomination of Brahm&aacute;, Vishn&#769;u, and &#346;iva. In the capacity of Brahm&aacute; he creates the worlds; in that of Rudra he destroys them; in that of Vishn&#769;u he is quiescent. These are the three Avasth&aacute;s (ht. hypostases) of the self-born. Brahm&aacute; is the quality of activity; Rudra that of darkness; Vishn&#769;u, the lord of the world, is goodness: so, therefore, the three gods are the three qualities. They are ever combined with, and dependent upon one another; and they are never for an instant separate; they never quit each other.' The notion is one common to all antiquity, although less philosophically conceived, or perhaps less distinctly expressed, in the passages which have come down to us. The &#0964;&#0961;&#0949;&#8150;&#0962; &#7936;&#0961;&#0967;&#0953;&#0954;&#8048;&#0962; &#8017;&#0960;&#0959;&#0963;&#0964;&#0940;&#0963;&#0949;&#0953;&#0962; of Plato are said by Cudworth (I. 111), upon the authority of Plotinus, to be an ancient doctrine, &#0960;&#0945;&#0955;&#0945;&#0953;&#8048; &#0948;&#8057;&#0958;&#0945;: and he also observes, "Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato have all of them asserted a trinity of divine hypostases; and as they unquestionably derived much of their doctrine from the Egyptians, it may reasonably be suspected that the Egyptians did the like before them." As however the Grecian accounts, and those of the Egyptians, are much more perplexed and unsatisfactory than those of the Hindus, it is most probable that we find amongst them the doctrine in its most original as well as most methodical and significant form.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_115"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_115">8:2</A> This address to Vishn&#769;u pursues the notion that he, as the supreme being, is one, whilst he is all: he is Avik&aacute;ra, not subject to change; Sadaikar&uacute;pa, one invariable nature: he is the liberator (t&aacute;ra), or he who bears mortals across the ocean of existence: he is both single and manifold (ek&aacute;nekar&uacute;pa): and he is the indiscrete (avyakta) cause of the world, as well as the discrete (vyakta) effect; or the invisible cause, and visible creation.</P>

Maya is an affix denoting 'made' or 'consisting of,' as K&aacute;sht&#769;ha maya, 'made of wood.' The world is therefore not regarded by the Pauranics as an emanation or an illusion, but as consubstantial with its first cause.</P>

The Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata interprets it in one place to mean, 'he who is not distinct from final emancipation;' and in another to signify, 'exempt from decay'. A commentator on the K&aacute;&#347;ikhan&#769;d&#769;a of the Sk&aacute;nda Pur&aacute;n&#769;a explains it, 'he who never declines (or varies) from his own proper nature.'</P>

This is not the doctrine of M&aacute;y&aacute;, or the influence of illusion, <a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></A> which alone, according to Ved&aacute;nta idealism, constitutes belief in the existence of matter: a doctrine foreign to most of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, and first introduced amongst them apparently by the Bh&aacute;gavata.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_123"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_123">9:10</A> The ordinary derivation of V&aacute;sudeva has been noticed above (<A HREF="vp035.htm#page_1">p. 1</A>): here it is derived from Vas, 'to dwell,' from Vishn&#769;u's abiding in all things, and all in him. The Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata explains V&aacute;su in the same manner, and Deva to signify radiant, shining: 'He causes all things to dwell in him, and he abides in all; whence he is named V&aacute;su: being resplendent as the sun, he is called Deva: and he who is both these, is denominated V&aacute;sudeva.' See also b. VI. c. 5.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_124"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_124">9:11</A> The commentator argues that V&aacute;sudeva must be the Brahma, or supreme being, of the Vedas, because the same circumstances are predicated of both, as eternity, omnipresence, omnipotence, &amp;c.; but he does not adduce any scriptural text with the name V&aacute;sudeva.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_125"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_125">9:12</A> Time is not usually enumerated in the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as as an element of the first cause, but the Padma P. and the Bh&aacute;gavata <a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></A> agree with the Vishn&#769;u in including it. It appears to have been regarded at an earlier date as an independent cause: the commentator on the Moksha Dherma cites a passage from the Vedas, which he understands to allude to the different theories of the cause of creation. Time, inherent nature, consequence of acts, self-will, elementary atoms, matter, and spirit, asserted severally by the Astrologers, the Buddhists, the Mim&aacute;nsakas, the Jains, the Logicians, the S&aacute;nkhyas, and the Ved&aacute;ntis. &#0922;&#0961;&#8057;&#0957;&#0959;&#0962; was also one of the first generated agents in creation, according to the Orphic theogony.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_126"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_126">10:13</A> The creation of the world is very commonly considered to be the Lil&aacute;, sport or amusement, of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_127"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_127">10:14</A> The attributes of Pradh&aacute;na, the chief (principle or element), here specified, conform generally to those ascribed to it by the S&aacute;nkhya philosophy (S&aacute;nkhya K&aacute;rik&aacute;, p. 16, &amp;c.), although some of them are incompatible with its origin from a first cause. In the S&aacute;nkhya this incongruity does not occur; for there Pradh&aacute;na is independent, and coordinate with primary spirit. The Pur&aacute;n&#769;as give rise to the inconsistency by a lax use of both philosophical and pantheistical expressions. The most incongruous epithets in our text are however explained away in the comment. Thus nitya, 'eternal,' is said to mean 'uniform, not liable to increase or diminution:' Sadasad&aacute;tmaka, 'comprehending what is and what is not,' means 'having the power of both cause and effect', as proceeding from Vishn&#769;u, and as giving origin to material things. An&aacute;di, 'without beginning,' means 'without birth', not being engendered by any created thing, but proceeding immediately from the first cause. 'The mother,' or literally the womb of the world', means the passive agent in creation,' operated on or influenced by the active will of the Creator. The first part of the passage in the text is a favourite one with several of. the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, but they modify it and apply it after their own fashion. In the Vishn&#769;u the original is ###, rendered as above. The V&aacute;yu, Brahm&aacute;nda, and <a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></A> K&uacute;rmma Pur&aacute;n&#769;as have 'The indiscrete cause, which is uniform, and both cause and effect, and whom those who are acquainted with first principles call Pradh&aacute;na and Prakriti--is the uncognizable Brahma, who was before all.' But the application of two synonymes of Prakriti to Brahma seems unnecessary at least. The Brahm&aacute; P. corrects the reading apparently: the first line is as before; the second is, ###. The passage is placed absolutely; 'There was an indiscrete cause eternal, and cause and effect, which was both matter and spirit (Pradh&aacute;na and Purusha), from which this world was made. Instead of 'such' or this,' some copies read 'from which &Iacute;&#347;wara or god (the active deity or Brahm&aacute;) made the world.' The Hari Van&#347;a has the same reading, except in the last term, which it makes ### that is, according to the commentator, the world, which is &Iacute;&#347;wara, was made.' The same authority explains this indiscrete cause, avyakta k&aacute;rana, to denote Brahm&aacute;, the creator an identification very unusual, if not inaccurate, and possibly founded on misapprehension of what is stated by the Bhavishya P.: 'That male or spirit which is endowed with that which is the indiscrete cause, &amp;c. is known in the world as Brahm&aacute;: he being in the egg, &amp;c.' The passage is precisely the same in Manu, I, 11; except that we have 'visrishta' instead of 'vi&#347;isht&#769;ha:' the latter is a questionable reading, and is probably wrong: the sense of the latter is, detached; and the whole means very consistently, 'embodied spirit detached from the indiscrete cause of the world is known as Brahm&aacute;.' The Padma P. inserts the first line, ### &amp;c., but has 'Which creates undoubtedly Mahat and the other qualities' assigning the first epithets, therefore, as the Vishn&#769;u does, to Prakriti only. The Linga also refers the expression to Prakriti alone, but makes it a secondary cause: 'An indiscrete cause, which those acquainted with first principles call Pradh&aacute;na and Prakriti, proceeded from that &Iacute;&#347;wara (&#346;iva).' This passage is one of very many instances in which expressions are common to several Pur&aacute;n&#769;as that seem to be borrowed from one another, or from some common source older than any of them, especially in this instance, as the same text occurs in Manu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_128"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_128">11:15</A> The expression of the text is rather obscure; 'All was pervaded (or comprehended) by that chief principle before (recreation), after the (last) destruction.' The ellipses are filled up by the commentator. This, he adds, is to be regarded as the state of things at a Mah&aacute; Pralaya, or total dissolution; leaving, therefore, crude matter, nature, or chaos, as a coexistent element with the Supreme. This, which is conformable to the philosophical doctrine, is not however that of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as in general, nor <a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></A> that of our text, which states (b. VI. c. 4), that at a Pr&aacute;krita, or elementary dissolution, Pradh&aacute;na itself merges into the deity. Neither is it apparently the doctrine of the Vedas, although their language is somewhat equivocal.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_129"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_129">12:16</A> The metre here is one common to the Vedas, Trishtubh, but in other respects the language is not characteristic of those compositions. The purport of the passage is rendered somewhat doubtful by its close, and by the explanation of the commentator. The former is, 'One Pradh&aacute;nika Brahma Spirit: THAT, was. The commentator explains Pradh&aacute;nika, Pradh&aacute;na eva, the same word as Pradh&aacute;na; but it is a derivative word, which may be used attributively, implying 'having, or conjoined with, Pradh&aacute;na.' The commentator, however, interprets it as the substantive; for he adds, 'There was Pradh&aacute;na and Brahma and Spirit; this triad was at the period of dissolution.' He evidently, however, understands their conjoint existence as one only; for he continues, 'So, according to the Vedas, then there was neither the existent (invisible cause, or matter) nor the non-existent (visible effect, or creation),' meaning that there was only One Being, in whom matter and its modifications were all comprehended.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_130"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_130">12:17</A> Or it might be rendered, 'Those two other forms (which proceed) from his supreme nature;' that is, from the nature of Vishn&#769;u, when he is Nirup&aacute;dhi, or without adventitious attributes: ### 'other' (###); the commentator states they are other or separate from Vishn&#769;u only through M&aacute;y&aacute;, illusion,' but here implying false notion;' the elements of creation being in essence one with Vishn&#769;u, though in existence detached and different.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_131"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_131">12:18</A> Pradh&aacute;na, when unmodified, is, according to the S&aacute;nkhyas and Paur&aacute;n&#769;ics, nothing more than the three qualities in equilibrio, or goodness, foulness, and darkness neutralising each other; (S&aacute;nkhya <a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></A> K&aacute;rik&aacute;, p. 52;) so in the Matsya P.: ###. This state is synonymous with the non-evolution of material products, or with dissolution; implying, however, separate existence, and detached from spirit This being the case, it is asked who. should sustain matter and spirit whilst separate, or renew their combination so as to renovate creation? It is answered, Time, which is when every thing else is not; and which, at the end of a certain interval, unites Matter, Pradh&aacute;na, and Purusha, and produces creation. Conceptions of this kind are evidently comprised in the Orphic triad, or the ancient notion of the cooperation of three such principles in creation; as Phanes or Eros, which is the Hindu spirit or Purusha; Chaos, matter or Pradh&aacute;na; and Chronos, or K&aacute;la, time.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_132"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_132">13:19</A> Pradh&aacute;na is styled Vyaya 'that which may be expended;' or Parin&#769;&aacute;min, 'which may be modified:' and Purusha is called Avyaya, 'inconsumable; or aparin&aacute;.min, 'immutable.' The expressions 'having entered into,' and 'agitated,' recall the mode in which divine intelligence, mens, &#0957;&#0959;&#8166;&#0962;, was conceived by the ancients to operate upon matter:</p>

<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">Spiritus intus alit totamque infusa per artus<br> Mens agitat molem et magno se corpore miscet:</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>or perhaps it more closely approximates to the Ph&#339;nician cosmogony, in which a spirit mixing with its own principles gives rise to creation. Brucker, I. 240. As presently explained, the mixture is not mechanical; it is an influence or effect exerted upon intermediate agents, which produce effects; as perfumes do not delight the mind by actual contact, but by the impression they make upon the sense of smelling, which communicates it to the mind. The entrance of the supreme Vishn&#769;u into spirit as well as matter is less intelligible than the view elsewhere taken of it, as the infusion of spirit, identified with the Supreme, into Prakriti or matter alone. Thus in the Padma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a: 'He who is called the male (spirit) of Prakriti, is here named Achyuta; and that same divine Vishn&#769;u entered into Prakriti.' So the Vrihat Naradiya: 'The lord of the world, who is called Purusha, producing agitation in Prakriti.' From the notion of influence or agitation produced on matter through or with spirit, the abuse of personification led to actual or vicarious admixture. Thus the Bh&aacute;gavata, identifying M&aacute;y&aacute; with Prakriti, has, <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></A> 'Through the operation of time, the Mighty One, who is present to the pure, implanted a seed in M&aacute;y&aacute; endowed with qualities, as Purusha, which is one with himself.' B. III. s.5. And the Bhavishya: 'Some learned men say, that the Supreme Being, desirous to create beings, creates in the commencement of the Kalpa a body of soul (or an incorporeal substance); which soul created by him enters into Prakriti; and Prakriti being thereby agitated, creates many material elements.' But these may be regarded as notions of a later date. In the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata the first cause is declared to be 'Intellectual,' who creates by his mind or will: The first (Being) is called M&aacute;nasa (intellectual), and is so celebrated by great sages: he is God, without beginning or end, indivisible, immortal, undecaying.' And again: 'The Intellectual created many kinds of creatures by his mind.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_133"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_133">14:20</A> Contraction, Sankocha, is explained by S&aacute;mya, sameness or equilibrium of the three qualities, or inert Pradh&aacute;na: and Expansion, Vik&aacute;&#347;a, is the destruction of this equipoise, by previous agitation and consequent developement of material products.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_134"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_134">14:21</A> The term here is Kshetrajna, 'embodied spirit,' or that which knows the kshetra or 'body;' implying the combination of spirit with form or matter, for the purpose of creating.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_135"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_135">14:22</A> The first product of Pradh&aacute;na sensible to divine, though not to mere human organs, is, both according to the S&aacute;nkhya and Paur&aacute;n&#769;ic doctrines, the principle called Mahat, literally 'the Great,' explained in other places, as in our text, 'the production of the manifestation of the qualities:' or, as in the V&aacute;yu, ###. We have in the same Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, as well as in the Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a and Linga, a number of synonymes for this term, as, ###. They are also explained, though not very distinctly, to the following purport: <font size="-1" color="green">"</font>Manas is that which considers the consequences of acts to all creatures, and provides for their happiness. Mahat, the Great principle, is so termed from being the first of the created principles, and from its extension being greater than that of the rest. Mati is that which discriminates and distinguishes objects preparatory to their fruition by Soul. Brahm&aacute; implies that which effects the developement and augmentation of created things. Pur <a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></A> is that by which the concurrence of nature occupies and fills all bodies. Buddhi is that which communicates to soul the knowledge of good and evil. Khy&aacute;ti is the means of individual fruition, or the faculty of discriminating objects by appropriate designations, and the like. &Iacute;&#347;wara is that which knows all things as if they were present. Prajn&aacute; is that by which the properties of things are known. Chiti is that by which the consequences of acts and species of knowledge are selected for the use of soul. Smriti is the faculty of recognising all things, past, present, or to come. Samvit is that in which all things are found or known, and which is found or known in all things: and Vipura is that which is free from the effects of contrarieties, as of knowledge and ignorance, and the like. Mahat is also called &Iacute;&#347;wara, from its exercising supremacy over all things; Bh&aacute;va, from its elementary existence; Eka, or 'the one,' from its singleness; Purusha, from its abiding within the body; and from its being ungenerated it is called Swayambhu." Now in this nomenclature we have chiefly two sets of words; one, as Manas, Buddhi, Mati, signifying mind, intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, design; and the other, as Brahm&aacute;, &Iacute;&#347;wara, &amp;c., denoting an active creator and ruler of the universe: as the V&aacute;yu adds, 'Mahat, impelled by the desire to create, causes various creation:' and the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata has, 'Mahat created Ahank&aacute;ra.' The Pur&aacute;n&#769;as generally employ the same expression, attributing to Mahat or Intelligence the 'act of creating. Mahat is therefore the divine mind in creative operation, the &#0957;&#0959;&#8166;&#0962; &#8001; &#0948;&#0953;&#0945;&#0954;&#8057;&#0963;&#0956;&#0969;&#0957; &#0964;&#0949; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#0960;&#0940;&#0957;&#0964;&#0969;&#0957; &#7936;&#0943;&#0964;&#0953;&#0959;&#0962; of Anaxagoras; an ordering and disposing mind, which was the cause of all things: The word itself suggests some relationship to the Ph&#339;nician Mot, which, like Mahat, was the first product of the mixture of spirit and matter, and the first rudiment of creation: "Ex connexione autem ejus spiritus prodiit mot . . . hinc seminium omnis creatur&aelig; et omnium rerum creatio." Brucker, I. 240. Mot, it is true, . appears to be a purely material substance, whilst Mahat is an incorporeal substance; but they agree in their place in the cosmogony, and are something alike in name. How far also the Ph&#339;nician system has been accurately described, is matter of uncertainty. See S&aacute;nkhya K&aacute;rik&aacute;, p. 83.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_136"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_136">15:23</A> The sense of Ahank&aacute;ra cannot be very well rendered by any European term. It means the principle of individual existence, that which appropriates perceptions, and on which depend the notions, I think, I feel, I am. It might be expressed by the proposition of Descartes reversed; "Sum, ergo cogito, sentio," &amp;c. The equivalent employed by Mr. Colebrooke, egotism, has the advantage of an analogous etymology, Ahank&aacute;ra being derived from Aham, 'I;' as in the Hari Van&#347;a: 'He (Brahm&aacute;), oh Bh&aacute;rata, said, <i>I</i> will create creatures.' See also S. K&aacute;rik&aacute;, p. 91.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_137"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_137">16:24</A> These three varieties of Ahank&aacute;ra are also described in the S&aacute;nkhya K&aacute;rik&aacute;, p. 92. Vaik&aacute;rika, that which is productive, or susceptible of production, is the same as the S&aacute;twika, or that which is combined with the property of goodness. Taijasa Ahank&aacute;ra is that which is endowed with Tejas, heat' or energy,' in <A HREF="errata.htm#1">consequence</A> of its having the property of Rajas, 'passion' or 'activity;' and the third kind, Bh&uacute;t&aacute;di, or 'elementary,' is the T&aacute;masa, or has the property of darkness. From the first kind proceed the senses; from the last, the rudimental unconscious elements; both kinds, which are equally of themselves inert, being rendered productive by the cooperation of the second, the energetic or active modification of Ahank&aacute;ra, which is therefore said to be the origin of both the senses and the elements.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_138"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_138">16:25</A> The successive series of rudiments and elements, and their respectively engendering the rudiments and elements next in order, occur in most of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, in nearly the same words. The Vrihann&aacute;radiya P. observes, 'They (the elements) in successive order acquire the property of causality one to the other.' The order is also the same; or, ether (&aacute;k&aacute;s), wind or air (v&aacute;yu), fire or light (tejas), water and earth; except in one passage of the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata (Moksha Dherma, C. 9), where it is ether, water, fire, air, earth. The order of Empedocles was ether, fire, earth, water, air. Cudworth, I. 97. The investment (&aacute;varan&#769;a) of each element by its own rudiment, and of each rudiment by its preceding gross and rudimental elements, is also met with in most of the chief Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, as the V&aacute;yu, Padma, Linga, and Bh&aacute;gavata; and traces <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></A> of it are found amongst the ancient cosmogonists; for Anaximander supposed, that when the world was made, a certain sphere or flame of fire, separated from matter (the Infinite), encompassed the air, which invested the earth as the bark does a tree:' &#0922;&#0945;&#0964;&#8048; &#0964;&#8052;&#0957; &#0947;&#8051;&#0957;&#0949;&#0963;&#0953;&#0957; &#0964;&#0959;&#8166;&#0948;&#0949; &#0964;&#0959;&#8166; &#0954;&#8057;&#0963;&#0956;&#0959;&#0965; &#7936;&#0960;&#0959;&#0954;&#0961;&#0953;&#0952;&#8134;&#0957;&#0945;&#0953;, &#0954;&#0945;&#0943; &#0964;&#0953;&#0957;&#0945; &#7953;&#0954; &#0964;&#0959;&#8059;&#0964;&#0959;&#0965; &#0966;&#0955;&#0959;&#0947;&#8056;&#0962; &#0963;&#0960;&#0945;&#8150;&#0961;&#0945;&#0957; &#0960;&#0949;&#0961;&#0953;&#0966;&#0965;&#8134;&#0957;&#0945;&#0953; &#0964;&#8183; &#0960;&#0949;&#0961;&#8054; &#0964;&#8052;&#0957; &#0947;&#8134;&#0957; &#7940;&#0949;&#0961;&#0953;, &#8033;&#0962; &#0964;&#8183; &#0948;&#8051;&#0957;&#0948;&#0961;&#8179; &#0966;&#0955;&#0959;&#0953;&#8057;&#0957;. Euseb. Pr, I. 15. Some of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, as the Matsya, V&aacute;yu, Linga, Bh&aacute;gavata, and M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya, add a description of a participation of properties amongst the elements, which is rather Ved&aacute;nta than S&aacute;nkhya. According to this notion, the elements add to their characteristic properties those of the elements which precede them. &Aacute;kas has the single property of sound: air has those of touch and sound: fire has colour, touch, and sound: water has taste, colour, touch, and sound: and earth has smell and the rest, thus having five properties: or, as the Linga P. describes the series, ###.</P>

In either case the notion is the same, and the aggregation of the elements is the effect of the presidence of spirit, without any active interference of the indiscrete principle. The Avyakta is passive in the evolution and combination of Mahat and the rest. Pradh&aacute;na is, no doubt, intended, but its identification with the Supreme is also implied. The term Anugraha may also refer to a classification of the order of creation, which will be again adverted to.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_143"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_143">18:30</A> It is impossible not to refer this notion to the same origin as the widely diffused opinion of antiquity, of the first manifestation of the world in the form of an egg. "It seems to have been a favourite symbol, and very ancient, and we find it adopted among many nations." Bryant, III. 165. Traces of it occur amongst the Syrians, Persians, and Egyptians; and besides the Orphic egg amongst the Greeks, and that described by Aristophanes, &#0932;&#8051;&#0954;&#0964;&#0949;&#0957; &#0960;&#0961;&#8061;&#0964;&#0953;&#0963;&#0964;&#0959;&#0957; &#8017;&#0960;&#0951;&#0957;&#8051;&#0956;&#0953;&#0959;&#0957; &#0957;&#8058;&#0958; &#7969; &#0956;&#0949;&#0955;&#0945;&#0957;&#8057;&#0960;&#0964;&#0949;&#0961;&#0959;&#0962; &#8032;&#8057;&#0957; part of the ceremony in the Dionysiaca and other mysteries consisted of the consecration of an egg; by which, according to Porphyry, was signified the world: &#7961;&#0961;&#0956;&#0951;&#0957;&#0949;&#8058;&#0949;&#0953; &#0948;&#8050; &#0964;&#8056; &#8032;&#8056;&#0957; &#0964;&#8056;&#0957; &#0954;&#8057;&#0963;&#0956;&#0959;&#0957;. Whether this egg typified the ark, as Bryant and Faber suppose, is not material to the proof of the antiquity and wide diffusion of the belief that the world in the beginning existed in such a figure. A similar account of the first aggregation of the elements in the form of an egg is given in all the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, with the usual epithet Haima or Hiranya, 'golden,' as it occurs in Manu, I. 9.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_144"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_144">19:31</A> Here is another analogy to the doctrines of antiquity relating to the mundane egg: and as the first visible male being, who, as we shall hereafter see, united in himself the nature of either sex, abode in the egg, and issued from it; so "this firstborn of the world, whom they represented under two shapes and characters, and who sprung from the mundane egg, was the person from whom the mortals and immortals were derived. He was the same as Dionusus, whom they styled, &#0960;&#0961;&#0969;&#0964;&#8057;&#0947;&#0959;&#0957;&#0959;&#0957; &#0948;&#0953;&#0966;&#0957;&#8134; &#0964;&#0961;&#0943;&#0947;&#0959;&#0957;&#0959;&#0957; &#0914;&#0945;&#0954;&#0967;&#0949;&#8150;&#0959;&#0957; &#7948;&#0957;&#0945;&#0954;&#0964;&#0945; &#7948;&#0947;&#0961;&#0953;&#0959;&#0957; &#7936;&#0961;&#0961;&#0951;&#0964;&#8056;&#0957; &#0954;&#0961;&#8059;&#0966;&#0953;&#0959;&#0957; &#0948;&#0953;&#0954;&#8051;&#0961;&#0969;&#0964;&#0945; &#0948;&#0943;&#0956;&#0959;&#0966;&#0959;&#0957;:" or, with the omission of one epithet, , ###.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_145"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_145">19:32</A> Jan&aacute;rddana is derived from Jana, 'men,' and Arddana, 'worship;' 'the object of adoration to mankind.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_146"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_146">19:33</A> This is the invariable doctrine of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, diversified only according to the <a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></A> individual divinity to whom they ascribe identity with Param&aacute;tm&aacute; or Parame&#347;wara. In our text this is Vishn&#769;u: in the &#346;aiva Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, as in the Linga, it is &#346;iva: in the Brahma-vaivartta it is Krishn&#769;a. The identification of one of the hypostases with the common source of the triad was an incongruity not unknown to other theogonies; for Cneph, amongst the Egyptians, appears on the one hand to have been identified with the Supreme Being, the indivisible unity, whilst on the other he is confounded with both Emeph and Ptha, the second and third persons of the triad of hypostases. Cudworth, I. 4. 18.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_147"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_147">20:34</A> 'The world that is termed spirit;' explained by the commentator, 'which indeed bears the appellation spirit;' conformably to the text of the Vedas, 'this universe is indeed spirit.' This is rather Ved&aacute;nta than S&aacute;nkhya, and appears to deny the existence of matter: and so it does as an independent existence; for the origin and end of infinite substance is the Deity or universal spirit: but it does not therefore imply the non-existence of the world as real substance.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_148"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_148">20:35</A> Vishn&#769;u is both Bh&uacute;te&#347;a, 'lord of the elements,' or of created things, and Vi&#347;war&uacute;pa, 'universal substance:' he is therefore, as one with sensible things, subject to his own control.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_149"></A><A HREF="vp036.htm#fr_149">20:36</A> Varen&#769;ya, 'most excellent;' being the same, according to the commentator, with supreme felicity.</P>
