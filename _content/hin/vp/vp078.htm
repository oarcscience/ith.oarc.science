<p>PAR&Aacute;&#346;ARA.--The original Veda, in four parts, consisted of one hundred thousand stanzas; and from it sacrifice of ten kinds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the accomplisher of all desires, proceeded. In the twenty-eighth Dw&aacute;para age my son Vy&aacute;sa separated the four portions of the Veda into four Vedas. In the same manner as the Vedas were arranged by him, as Vedavy&aacute;sa, so were they divided in former periods by all the preceding Vy&aacute;sas, and by myself: and the branches into which they were subdivided by him were the same into which they had been distributed in every aggregate of the four ages. Know, Maitreya, the Vy&aacute;sa called Krishn&#769;a Dwaip&aacute;yana to be the deity N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a; for who else on this earth could have composed the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_788"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>? Into what portions the Vedas were arranged by my magnanimous son, in the Dw&aacute;para age, you shall hear.</p>  
<p>When Vy&aacute;sa was enjoined by Brahm&aacute; to arrange the Vedas in different books, he took four persons, well read in those works, as his disciples. He appointed Paila reader of the Rich&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_789"></A><A HREF="#fn_789"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; Vai&#347;amp&aacute;yana of</p>

<p>the Yajush; and Jaimini of the Soma-veda: and Sumantu, who was conversant with the Atharva-veda, was also the disciple of the learned Vy&aacute;sa. He also took S&uacute;ta, who was named Lomaharshan&#769;a, as his pupil in historical and legendary traditions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_790"></A><A HREF="#fn_790"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>There was but one Yajur-veda; but dividing this into four parts, Vy&aacute;sa instituted the sacrificial rite that is administered by four kinds of priests: in which it was the duty of the Adhwaryu to recite the prayers (Yajush) (or direct the ceremony); of the Hotri, to repeat the hymns (Richas); of the Udg&aacute;tri, to chaunt other hymns (S&aacute;ma); and of the Brahman, to pronounce the formul&aelig; called Atharva. Then the Muni, having collected together the hymns called Richas, compiled the Rigveda; with the prayers and directions termed Yajushas he formed the Yajur-veda; with those called S&aacute;ma, S&aacute;ma-veda; and with the Atharvas he composed the rules of all the ceremonies suited to kings, and the function of the Brahman agreeably to practice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_791"></A><A HREF="#fn_791"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>This vast original tree of the Vedas, having been divided by him into four principal stems, soon branched out into an extensive forest. In the first place, Paila divided the Rig-veda, and gave the two Sanhit&aacute;s (or collections of hymns) to Indrapramati and to B&aacute;shkali. B&aacute;shkali&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_792"></A><A HREF="#fn_792"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> subdivided his Sanhit&aacute; into four, which he gave to his disciples Baudhya, Agnim&aacute;t&#769;hara, Yajnawalka, and Par&aacute;&#347;ara; and they taught these secondary shoots from the primitive branch. Indrapramati imparted his Sanhit&aacute; to his son Man&#769;d&#769;ukeya, and it thence descended through successive generations, as well as disciples&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_793"></A><A HREF="#fn_793"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. Vedamitra, called also &#346;&aacute;kalya, studied the same Sanhit&aacute;, but he divided it into five Sanhit&aacute;s, which he distributed amongst as many disciples, named severally Mudgala, Goswalu, V&aacute;tsya, &#346;&aacute;l&iacute;ya, and &#346;i&#347;ira&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_794"></A><A HREF="#fn_794"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>. S&aacute;kap&uacute;rn&#769;i made a different division of the original Sanhit&aacute; into three portions, and added a glossary (Nirukta), constituting a fourth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_795"></A><A HREF="#fn_795"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>.

<P><A NAME="fn_787"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_787">275:1</A> According to the Grihya portion of the S&aacute;ma-veda, there are five great sacrificial ceremonies; 1. Agnihotra, burnt-offerings, or libations of clarified butter on sacred fire; 2. Der&#347;apaurn&#769;am&aacute;sa, sacrifices at new and full moon; 3. Ch&aacute;turmasya, sacrifices every four months; 4. Pa&#347;u-yajna or A&#347;wamedha, sacrifice of a horse or animal; and 5. Soma-yajna, offerings and libations of the juice of the acid asclepias. These, again, are either Pr&aacute;krita, 'simple,' or Vaikrita, 'modified;' and being thus doubled, constitute ten.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_788"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_788">275:2</A> The composition of the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata is always ascribed to the Vy&aacute;sa named Krishn&#769;a Dwaip&aacute;yana, the cotemporary of the events there described. The allusion in the text establishes the priority of the poem to the Vishn&#769;u Pur&aacute;n&#769;a.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_789"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_789">275:3</A> Or rather, 'he took Paila as teacher.' The expression is, Rigveda &#347;r&aacute;vakam Pailam jagr&aacute;ha. &#346;r&aacute;vaka means properly 'he who causes to hear,' 'a lecturer,' 'a preacher;' although, as in the case of its applicability to the laity of the Buddhists and Jainas, it <a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="green">p. 276</font></A> denotes a disciple. The commentator however observes, that the text is sometimes read 'one who had gone through the Rig-veda.' So in the preceding verse it is said, 'he took four persons, well read in the Vedas, as his disciples,' and again it is said, 'Sumantu, conversant with the Atharva-veda, was his disciple.' It is clear, therefore, that the Vedas were known, as distinct works, before Krishn&#769;a Dwaip&aacute;yana; and it is difficult to understand how he earned his title of arranger, or Vy&aacute;sa: at any rate, in undertaking to give order to the prayers and hymns of which the Vedas consist, Paila and the others were rather his coadjutors than disciples; and it seems probable that the tradition records the first establishment of a school, of which the Vy&aacute;sa was the head, and the other persons named were the teachers.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_790"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_790">276:4</A> The Itih&aacute;sa and Pur&aacute;n&#769;as; understanding by the former, legendary and traditional narratives. It is usually supposed that by the Itih&aacute;sa the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata is especially meant; but although this poem is ascribed to Krishn&#769;a Dwaip&aacute;yana, the recitation of it is not attributed to his pupil, Roma or Loma-harshan&#769;a: it was first narrated by Vai&#347;amp&aacute;yana, and after him by Sauti, the son of Lomaharshan&#769;a.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_791"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_791">276:5</A> From this account, which is repeated in the V&aacute;yu P., it appears that the original Veda was the Yajush, or in other words was a miscellaneous body of precepts, formul&aelig;, prayers, and hymns, for sacrificial ceremonies; Yajush being derived by the grammarians from Yaj, 'to worship.' The derivation of the V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, however, is from Yuj, 'to join,' 'to employ;' the formul&aelig; being those especially applied to sacrificial rites, or set apart for that purpose from the general collection: <a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="green">p. 277</font></A> ### again, ### The commentator on the text however, citing the former of these passages from the V&aacute;yu, reads it, confining the derivation to Yaj, 'to worship.' The concluding passage, relating to the Atharvan, refers, in regard to regal ceremonies, to those of expiation, &#346;&aacute;nti, &amp;c. The function of the Brahman is not explained; but from the preceding specification of the four orders of priests who repeat at sacrifices portions of the several Vedas, it relates to the office of the one that is termed specifically the Brahman: so the V&aacute;yu has 'He constituted the function of the Brahman at sacrifices with the Atharva-veda.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_792"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_792">277:6</A> Both in our text and in that of the V&aacute;yu this name occurs both B&aacute;shkala and B&aacute;shkali. Mr. Colebrooke writes it B&aacute;hkala and B&aacute;hkali. As. Res. VIII. 374.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_793"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_793">277:7</A> The V&aacute;yu supplies the detail. Man&#769;d&#769;ukeya, or, as one copy writes, M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya, taught the Sanhit&aacute; to his son Satya&#347;ravas; he to his son Satyahita; and he to his son Satya&#347;r&iacute;. The latter had three pupils, &#346;&aacute;kalya, also called Devamitra (sic in MS.), Rath&aacute;ntara, and another B&aacute;shkali, called also Bharadw&aacute;ja. The V&aacute;yu has a legend of &#346;&aacute;kalya's death, in consequence of his being defeated by Y&aacute;jnavalkya in a disputation at a sacrifice celebrated by Janaka.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_794"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_794">277:8</A> These names in the V&aacute;yu are Mudgala, Golaka, Kh&aacute;liya, M&aacute;tsya, &#346;ai&#347;ireya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_795"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_795">277:9</A> The commentator, who is here followed by Mr. Colebrooke, states that he was a pupil of Indrapramati; but from the V&aacute;yu it appears that &#346;&aacute;kap&uacute;rn&#769;i was another name of Rath&aacute;ntara, the pupil of Satya&#347;r&iacute;, the author of three Sanhit&aacute;s and a Nirukta, or glossary; whence Mr. Colebrooke supposes him the same with Y&aacute;ska. As. Res. VIII. 375. It is highly probable that the text of the V&aacute;yu may be made to correct that of the Vishn&#769;u in this place, which is inaccurate, notwithstanding the copies agree: they read, ###. <a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="green">p. 278</font></A> Here &#346;&aacute;kap&uacute;rn&#769;ir-atha-itaram is the necessary construction; but quere if it should not be &#346;&aacute;kap&uacute;rn&#769;i Rath&aacute;ntara. The parallel passage in the V&aacute;yu is, ###. Now in describing the pupils of Satya&#347;r&iacute;, Rath&aacute;ntara was named clearly enough: ###. In another passage it would seem to be implied that this B&aacute;shkali was the author of the Sanhit&aacute;s, and Rath&aacute;ntara of the Nirukta only: ###. However this may be, his being the author of the Nirukta identifies him with &#346;&aacute;kap&uacute;rn&#769;i, and makes it likely that the two names should come in juxta-position in our text, as well as in the V&aacute;yu. It must be admitted, however, that there are some rather inexplicable repetitions in the part of the V&aacute;yu where this account occurs, although two copies agree in the reading. That a portion of the Vedas goes by the name of Rathantara we have seen (<A HREF="vp039.htm#page_42">p. 42</A>); but as far as is yet known, the name is confined to different prayers or hymns of the Uhya G&aacute;na of the S&aacute;ma-veda. The text of the Vishn&#769;u also admits of a different explanation regarding the work of &#346;&aacute;kap&uacute;rn&#769;i, and instead of a threefold division of the original, the passage may mean that he composed a third Sanhit&aacute;. So Mr. Colebrooke says "the Vishn&#769;u P. omits the &#346;&aacute;kh&aacute;s of A&#347;wal&aacute;yana and S&aacute;nkhy&aacute;yana, and intimates that &#346;&aacute;kap&uacute;rn&#769;i gave the third varied edition from that of Indrapramati." The V&aacute;yu, however, is clear in ascribing three Sanhit&aacute;s or &#346;&aacute;kh&aacute;s to &#346;&aacute;kap&uacute;rn&#769;i.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_796"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_796">278:10</A> In the V&aacute;yu the four pupils of S&aacute;kap&uacute;rn&#769;i are called Kenava, D&aacute;laki, &#346;ataval&aacute;ka, and Naigama.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_797"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_797">278:11</A> This B&aacute;shkali may either be, according to the commentator, the pupil of Paila, who, in addition to the four Sanhit&aacute;s previously noticed, compiled three others; or he may be another B&aacute;shkali, a fellow-pupil of &#346;&aacute;kap&uacute;rni. The V&aacute;yu makes him a disciple of Satya&#347;r&iacute;, the fellow-pupil of &#346;&aacute;kalya and Rath&aacute;ntara, and adds the name or title Bh&aacute;radw&aacute;ja.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_798"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_798">278:12</A> In the V&aacute;yu they are called Nand&aacute;yan&iacute;ya, Pannag&aacute;ri, and &Aacute;rjjava.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_799"></A><A HREF="vp078.htm#fr_799">278:13</A> Both the Vishn&#769;u and V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;as omit two other principal divisions of the Rich, those of A&#347;wal&aacute;yana and S&aacute;nkhy&aacute;yana or the Kau&#347;&iacute;tak&iacute;. As. Res. VIII. 375. There is no specification of the aggregate number of Sanhit&aacute;s of the Rich in our text, or in the V&aacute;yu; but they describe eighteen, including the Nirukta; or as Mr. Colebrooke states, sixteen (As. Res. VIII. 374); that is, omitting the two portions of the original, as divided by Paila. The K&uacute;rma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a states the number at twenty-one; but treatises on the study of the Vedas reduce the &#346;&aacute;kh&aacute;s of the Rich to five.</P>
