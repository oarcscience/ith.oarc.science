Cherish thy son, Dushyanta; treat not &#346;akuntal&aacute; with disrespect. Sons, who are born from the paternal loins, rescue their progenitors from the infernal regions. Thou art the parent of this boy; &#346;akuntal&aacute; has spoken truth." From the expression 'cherish,' Bharaswa, the prince was called Bharata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1229"></A><A HREF="#fn_1229"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Bharata had by different wives nine sons, but they were put to death by their own mothers, because Bharata remarked that they bore no resemblance to him, and the women were afraid that he would therefore desert them. The birth of his sons being thus unavailing, Bharata sacrificed to the Maruts, and they gave him Bharadw&aacute;ja, the son of Vrihaspati by Mamata the wife of Utathya, expelled by the kick of Dirghatamas, his half brother, before his time. This verse explains the purport of his appellation; "'Silly woman,' said Vrihaspati, 'cherish this child of two fathers' (bhara dw&aacute;-jam). 'No, Vrihaspati,' replied Mamat&aacute;, <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>do you take care of him.' So saying, they both abandoned him; but from their expressions the boy was called Bharadw&aacute;ja." He was also termed Vitatha, in allusion to the unprofitable (vitatha) birth of the sons of Bharata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1230"></A><A HREF="#fn_1230"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>.

Thus the construction is such as to intimate that Tansu or Tansurodha had a wife named Il&aacute;, the daughter of Medh&aacute;tithi; that is, his brother's great-granddaughter: but this, as the commentator observes, is contrary to common sense, and he would read it therefore, 'The daughter of him who was named Ilin;' a Raja so called: but in the V&aacute;yu and Matsya we have Ilin&aacute;, the daughter of Yama, married to Tansu, and mother of Malina or Anila; more correctly perhaps Ailina. The blunder of the Hari V. therefore arises from the compiler's reading Yasya, 'of whom,' instead of Yamasya, 'Yama.' It is not an error of transcription, for the metre requires Yasya, and the remark of the commentator proves the correctness of the reading. The name occurs &Iacute;lina, the son of Tansu, in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, agreeably to the Anuvan&#347;a &#347;loka, which is there quoted. 'Saraswat&iacute; bore Tansu to Matin&aacute;ra, and Tansu begot a son, &Iacute;lina, by K&aacute;ling&iacute;.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1228"></A><A HREF="vp112.htm#fr_1228">448:13</A> The V&aacute;yu, Matsya, and Bh&aacute;gavata agree with our text in making these the grandsons of Tansu: even the Br&aacute;hma P. concurs, but the Hari V. makes them his sons, having apparently transformed Tansosuta, the son of Tansu, into a synonyme of Tansu, or Tansurodha; as in these parallel passages: 'The son of Tansu was the illustrious sage Dharmanetra: Upad&aacute;nav&iacute; had from him four excellent sons.' Br&aacute;hma P. 'Tansurodha was a royal sage, the illustrious institutor of laws. Upad&aacute;nav&iacute; had four sons from Tansurodha.' Hari V. The commentator explains Dharmanetra to be 'institutor <a name="page_449"><font size="1" color="green">p. 449</font></A> of laws.' We have Upad&aacute;nav&iacute; before, as the daughter of Vrishaparvan the Daitya, married to Hiran&#769;y&aacute;ksha. Hamilton (Buchanan) calls her the wife of Sughora. The four sons are named in other authorities, with some variations: Dushyanta, Sushyanta or Rishyanta or Sumanta, Prav&iacute;ra and Anagha or Naya. The Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata enumerates five, Dushyanta, &#346;&uacute;ra, Bh&iacute;ma, Vasu, and Pravasu, but makes them the sons of &Iacute;lina and grandsons of Tansu.</P>

They are repeated in the same book, in the account of the family of Puru, p. 139. They occur, with a slight variation of the order, in other Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, as the V&aacute;yu, &amp;c., and shew the greater antiquity of the story of &#346;akuntal&aacute;, although they do not narrate it. The meaning of the name Bharata is differently explained in &#346;akuntal&aacute;; he is said to be so called from supporting' the world: he is also there named &#346;arvadamana, 'the conqueror of all.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1230"></A><A HREF="vp112.htm#fr_1230">449:15</A> The Br&aacute;hma P. and Hari V., the latter especially, appear to have modified this legend, with the view perhaps of reconciling those circumstances which are related of Bharadw&aacute;ja as a sage with his <a name="page_450"><font size="1" color="green">p. 450</font></A> history as a king. Whilst therefore they state that Bharadw&aacute;ja was brought by the winds to Bharata, they state that he was so brought to perform a sacrifice, by which a son was born, whom Bharadw&aacute;ja also inaugurated. In the V&aacute;yu, Matsya, and Agni, however, the story is much more consistently narrated; and Bharadw&aacute;ja, being abandoned by his natural parent, is brought by the winds, as a child, not as a sage; and being adopted by Bharata, is one and the same with Vitatha, as our text relates. Thus in the V&aacute;yu, the Maruts bring to Bharata, already sacrificing for progeny, Bharadw&aacute;ja, the son of Vrihaspati; and Bharata receiving him, says, "This Bharadw&aacute;ja shall be Vitatha." The Matsya also says, the Maruts in compassion took the child, and being pleased with Bharata's worship, gave it to him, and he was named Vitatha. And the Agni tells the whole story in one verse: 'Then the son of Vrihaspati, being taken by the winds; Bharadw&aacute;ja was transferred with sacrifice, and was Vitatha.' The account given in the Bh&aacute;gavata is to the same purpose. The commentator on the text also makes the matter clear enough: 'The name of Bharadw&aacute;ja in the condition of son of Bharata was Vitatha.' It is clear that a new-born infant could not be the officiating priest at a sacrifice for his own adoption, whatever the compiler of the Hari Van&#347;a may please to assert. From Bharadw&aacute;ja, a Brahman by birth, and king by adoption, descended Brahmans and Kshatriyas, the children of two fathers: The Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, in the &Aacute;di Parvan, tells the story very simply. In one place, p. 136. v. 3710, it says that Bharata, on the birth of his children proving vain, obtained from Bharadw&aacute;ja, by great sacrifices, a son, Bh&uacute;manyu; and in another passage it makes Bh&uacute;manyu the son of Bharata by Sunand&aacute;, daughter of &#346;arvasena, king of K&aacute;&#347;&iacute;; p. 139. v. 3785. The two are not incompatible.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1238"></A><A HREF="vp112.htm#fr_1238">451:23</A> In the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, Suhotra is the son of Bh&uacute;manyu; and in one place the father of Ajam&iacute;d&#769;ha, &amp;c., and in another of Hastin. The Br&aacute;hma P. in some degree, and the Hari Van&#347;a in a still greater, have made most extraordinary confusion in the instance of this name. In our text and in all the best authorities we have three Suhotras, perfectly distinct: 1. Suhotra great-grandson of Am&aacute;vasu, father of Jahnu, and ancestor of Visw&aacute;mitra and the Kau&#347;ikas (see <A HREF="vp085.htm#page_308">p. 308</A>); 2. Suhotra son of Kshatravriddha, and grandson of Ayus, and progenitor of the race of K&aacute;&#347;&iacute; kings (<A HREF="vp101.htm#page_406">p. 406</A>); and 3. Suhotra the son of Vrihatkshatra, grandson of Vitatha, and parent of Hastin. In the two blundering compilations mentioned, we have, first (Hari V. c. 20), a Suhotra son of Vrihatkshatra, of the race of Puru; his descent is not given, but, from the names which follow Suhotra, the dynasty is that of our present text: secondly (Hari V. c. 27), Suhotra son of K&aacute;nchana, of the line of Am&aacute;vasu, and father of Jahnu, &amp;c.: thirdly (Hari V. c. 29), Suhotra the son of Kshatravriddha, and progenitor of the K&aacute;&#347;&iacute; kings: fourthly (Hari V. 32), we have the first and third of these personages confounded; Suhotra is made the son of Vitatha, and progenitor of the K&aacute;&#347;&iacute; kings, the dynasty of whom is repeated; thus connecting them with the line of Puru instead of &Aacute;yus, in opposition to all authority. Again, we have a notable piece of confusion, and Suhotra the son of Vitatha is made the father of Vrihat, the father of the three princes who in our text and in the Hari V. (c. 20) are the sons of Hastin; and amongst whom Ajam&iacute;d&#769;ha is made the father of Jahnu, and ancestor of the Kau&#347;ikas, instead of being, as in c. 27, and as every where else, of the family of Am&aacute;vasu. The source of all this confusion is obvious. The compilers extracted all the authentic traditions accurately enough, but, puzzled by the identity of name, they have also <a name="page_452"><font size="1" color="green">p. 452</font></A> mixed the different accounts together, and caused very absurd and needless perplexity. It is quite clear also that the Hari Vanua does not deserve the pains taken, and taken fruitlessly, by Mr. Hamilton and M. Langlois to reduce it to consistency. It is of no weight whatever as an authority for the dynasties of kings, although it furnishes some particular details, which it has picked up possibly from authentic sources not now available.</P>
