5\. The Bhágavata Puráńa

5\. Śrí Bhágavata. "That in which ample details of duty are described,
and which opens with (an extract from) the Gáyatri; that in which the
death of the Asura Vritra is told, and in which the mortals and
immortals of the Sáraswata Kalpa, with the events that then happened

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

to them in the world, are related; that, is celebrated as the Bhágavata,
and consists of eighteen thousand verses <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45)." The Bhágavata is a work of great
celebrity in India, and exercises a more direct and powerful influence
upon the opinions and feelings of the people than perhaps any other of
the Puráńas. It is placed the fifth in all the lists; but the Padma
Puráńa ranks it as the eighteenth, as the extracted substance of all the
rest. According to the usual specification, it consists of eighteen
thousand ślokas, distributed amongst three hundred and thirty-two
chapters, divided into twelve Skandhas or books. It is named Bhágavata
from its being dedicated to the glorification of Bhagavat or Vishńu.

The Bhágavata is communicated to the Rishis at Naimishárańya by Súta, as
usual; but he only repeats what was narrated by Śuka, the son of Vyása,
to Paríkshit, the king of Hastinápura, the grandson of Arjuna. Having
incurred the imprecation of a hermit, by which he was sentenced to die
of the bite of a venomous snake, at the expiration of seven days; the
king, in preparation for . this event, repairs to the banks of the
Ganges; whither also come the gods and sages, to witness his death.
Amongst the latter is Śuka; and it is in reply to Paríkshit's question,
what a man should do who is about to die, that he narrates the
Bhágavata, as he had heard it from Vyása; for nothing secures final
happiness so certainly, as to die whilst the thoughts are wholly
engrossed by Vishńu.

The course of the narration opens with a cosmogony, which, although in
most respects similar to that of other Puráńas, is more largely
intermixed with allegory and mysticism, and derives its tone more from
the Vedanta than the Sánkhya philosophy. The doctrine of active creation
by the Supreme, as one with Vásudeva, is more distinctly asserted, with
a more decided enunciation of the effects being resolvable into Máyá, or
illusion. There are also doctrinal peculiarities, highly characteristic
of this Puráńa; amongst which is the assertion that it was originally
communicated by Brahmá to Nárada, that all men whatsoever, Hindus of
every caste, and even Mlechchhas, outcastes or barbarians, might learn
to have faith in Vásudeva.

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

In the third book the interlocutors are changed to Maitreya and Vidura;
the former of whom is the disciple in the Vishńu Puráńa, the latter was
the half-brother of the Kuru princes. Maitreya, again, gives an account
of the Srisht́i-lílá, or sport of creation, in a strain partly common to
the Puráńas, partly peculiar; although he declares he learned it from
his teacher Paráśara, at the desire of Pulastya <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46); referring thus to the fabulous origin of
the Vishńu Puráńa, and furnishing evidence of its priority. Again,
however, the authority is changed, and the narrative is said to have
been that which was communicated by Śesha to the Nágas. The creation of
Brahmá is then described, and the divisions of time are explained. A
very long and peculiar account is given of the Varáha incarnation of
Vishńu, which is followed by the creation of the Prajápatis and
Swáyambhuva, whose daughter Devahutí is married to Karddama Rishi; an
incident peculiar to this work, as is that which follows of the Avatára
of Vishńu as Kapila the son of Karddama and Devahutí, the author of the
Sánkhya philosophy, which he expounds, after a Vaishńava fashion, to his
mother, in the last nine chapters of this section.

The Manwantara of Swáyambhuva, and the multiplication of the patriarchal
families, are next described with some peculiarities of nomenclature,
which are pointed out in the notes to the parallel passages of the
Vishńu Puráńa. The traditions of Dhruva, Veńa, Prithu, and other princes
of this period, are the other subjects of the fourth Skandha, and are
continued in the fifth to that of the Bharata who obtained emancipation.
The details generally conform to those of the Vishńu Puráńa, and the
same words are often employed, so that it would he difficult to
determine which work had the best right to them, had not the Bhágavata
itself indicated its obligations to the Vishńu. The remainder of the
fifth book is occupied with the description of the universe, and the
same conformity with the Vishńu continues.

This is only partially the case with the sixth book, which contains a
variety of legends of a miscellaneous description, intended to
illustrate the merit of worshipping Vishńu: some of them belong to the
early

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

stock, but some are apparently novel. The seventh book is mostly
occupied with the legend of Prahláda. In the eighth we have an account
of the remaining Manwantaras; in which, as happening in the course of
them, a variety of ancient legends are repeated, as the battle between
the king of the elephants and an alligator, the churning of the ocean,
and the dwarf and fish Avatáras. The ninth book narrates the dynasties
of the Vaivaswata Manwantara, or the princes of the solar and lunar
races to the time of Krishńa <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47). The
particulars conform generally with those recorded in the Vishńu.

The tenth book is the characteristic part of this Puráńa, and the
portion upon which its popularity is founded. It is appropriated
entirely to the history of Krishńa, which it narrates much in the same
manner as the Vishńu, but in more detail; holding a middle place,
however, between it and the extravagant prolixity with which the Hari
Vanśa repeats the story. It is not necessary to particularize it
farther. It has been translated into perhaps all the languages of India,
and is a favourite work with all descriptions of people.

The eleventh book describes the destruction of the Yádavas, and death of
Krishńa. Previous to the latter event, Krishńa instructs Uddhava in the
performance of the Yoga; a subject consigned by the Vishńu to the
concluding passages. The narrative is much the same, but something more
summary than that of the Vishńu. The twelfth book continues the lines of
the kings of the Kálí age prophetically to a similar period as the
Vishńu, and gives a like account of the deterioration of all things, and
their final dissolution. Consistently with the subject of the Puráńa,
the serpent Takshaka bites Paríkshit, and he expires, and the work
should terminate; or the close might be extended to the subsequent
sacrifice of Janamejaya for the destruction of the whole serpent race.
There is a rather awkwardly introduced description, however, of the
arrangement of the Vedas and Puráńas by Vyása,

<span id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span>

and the legend of Márkańd́eya's interview with the infant Krishńa, during
a period of worldly dissolution. We then come to the end of the
Bhágavata, in a series of encomiastic commendations of its own sanctity,
and efficacy to salvation.

Mr. Colebrooke observes of the Bhágavata Puráńa, "I am inclined to adopt
an opinion supported by many learned Hindus, who consider the celebrated
Śrí Bhágavata as the work of a grammarian (Vopadeva), supposed to have
lived six hundred years ago <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48)." Col.
Vans Kennedy considers this an incautious admission, because "it is
unquestionable that the number of the Puráńas has been always held to be
eighteen; but in most of the Puráńas the names of the eighteen are
enumerated, amongst which the Bhágavata is invariably included; and
consequently if it were composed only six hundred years ago, the others
must be of an equally modern date <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49)."
Some of them are no doubt more recent; but, as already remarked, no
weight can be attached to the specification of the eighteen names, for
they are always complete; each Puráńa enumerates all. Which is the last?
which had the opportunity of naming its seventeen predecessors, and
adding itself? The argument proves too much. There can be little doubt
that the list has been inserted upon the authority of tradition, either
by some improving transcriber, or by the compiler of a work more recent
than the eighteen genuine Puráńas. The objection is also rebutted by the
assertion, that there was another Puráńa to which the name applies, and
which is still to be met with, the Deví Bhágavata.

For, the authenticity of the Bhágavata is one of the few questions
affecting their sacred literature which Hindu writers have ventured to
discuss. The occasion is furnished by the text itself. In the fourth
chapter of the first book it is said that Vyása arranged the Vedas, and
divided them into four; and that he then compiled the Itihása and
Puráńas, as a fifth Veda. The Vedas he gave to Paila and the rest; the
Itihása and Puráńas to Lomaharshańa, the father of Súta <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50). Then reflecting that these works may not
be accessible to women, Śúdras, and

<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span>

mixed castes, he composed the Bhárata, for the purpose of placing
religious knowledge within their reach. Still he felt dissatisfied, and
wandered in much perplexity along the banks of the Saraswatí, where his
hermitage was situated, when Nárada paid him a visit. Having confided to
him his secret and seemingly causeless dissatisfaction, Nárada suggested
that it arose from his not having sufficiently dwelt, in the works he
had finished, upon the merit of worshipping Vásudeva. Vyása at once
admitted its truth, and found a remedy for his uneasiness in the
composition of the Bhágavata, which he taught to Śuka his son <span
id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51). Here therefore is the most positive
assertion that the Bhágavata was composed subsequently to the Puráńas,
and given to a different pupil, and was not therefore one of the
eighteen of which Romaharshańa the Seta was, according to all concurrent
testimonies, the depositary. Still the Bhágavata is named amongst the
eighteen Puráńas by the inspired authorities; and how can these
incongruities be reconciled?

The principal point in dispute seems to have been started by an
expression of Śrídhara Swámin, a commentator on the Bhágavata, who
somewhat incautiously made the remark that there was no reason to
suspect that by the term Bhágavata any other work than the subject of
his labours was intended. This was therefore an admission that some
suspicions had been entertained of the correctness of the nomenclature,
and that an opinion had been expressed that the term belonged, not to
the Śrí Bhágavata, but to the Deví Bhágavata; to a Śaiva, not a
Vaishńava, composition. With whom doubts prevailed prior to Śrídhara
Swámin, or by whom they were urged, does not appear; for, as far as we
are aware, no works, anterior to his date, in which they are advanced
have been met with. Subsequently, various tracts have been written on
the subject. There are three in the library of the East India Company;
the Durjana Mukha Chapet́iká, 'A slap of the face for the vile,' by
Rámáśrama; the Durjana Mukha Mahá Chapet́iká, 'A great slap of the face
for the wicked,' by Káśináth Bhat́t́a; and the Durjana Mukha Padma Pad́uká,
'A slipper' for the same part of the same persons, by a

<span id="page_xxx">p. xxx</span>

nameless disputant. The first maintains the authenticity of the
Bhágavata; the second asserts that the Deví Bhágavata is the genuine
Puráńa; and the third replies to the arguments of the first. There is
also a work by Purushottama, entitled 'Thirteen arguments for dispelling
all doubts of the character of the Bhágavata' (Bhágavata swarúpa vihsaya
śanká nirása trayodasa); whilst Bálambhat́t́a, a commentator on the
Mitákshara, indulging in a dissertation on the meaning of the word
Puráńa, adduces reasons for questioning the inspired origin of this
Puráńa.

The chief arguments in favour of the authenticity of this Puráńa are the
absence of any reason why Vopadeva, to whom it is attributed, should not
have put his own name to it; its being included in all lists of the
Puráńas, sometimes with circumstances that belong to no other Puráńa;
and its being admitted to be a Puráńa, and cited as authority, or made
the subject of comment, by writers of established reputation, of whom
Śankara Áchárya is one, and he lived long before Vopadeva. The reply to
the first argument is rather feeble, the controversialists being
unwilling perhaps to admit the real object, the promotion of new
doctrines. It is therefore said that Vyása was an incarnation of
Náráyańa, and the purpose was to propitiate his favour. The insertion of
a Bhágavata amongst the eighteen Puráńas is acknowledged; but this, it
is said, can be the Deví Bhágavata alone, for the circumstances apply
more correctly to it than to the Vaishńava Bhágavata. Thus a text is
quoted by Káśináth from a Puráńa--he does not state which--that says of
the Bhágavata that it contains eighteen thousand verses, twelve books,
and three hundred and thirty-two chapters. Káśináth asserts that the
chapters of the Śrí Bhágavata are three hundred and thirty-five, and
that the numbers apply throughout only to the Deví Bhágavata. It is also
said that the Bhágavata contains an account of the acquirement of holy
knowledge by Hayagríva; the particulars of the Sáraswata Kalpa; a
dialogue between Ambarísha and Śuka; and that it commences with the
Gayatrí, or at least a citation of it. These all apply to the Deví
Bhágavata alone, except the last; but it also is more true of the Śaiva
than of the Vaishńava work, for the latter has only one word of the
Gayatrí, dhímahi, 'we meditate;' whilst the former to dhímahi adds, Yá
nah prachodayát,

<span id="page_xxxi">p. xxxi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'who may enlighten
us.' To the third argument it is in the first place objected, that the
citation of the Bhágavata by modern writers is no test of its
authenticity; and with regard to the more ancient commentary of Śankara
Áchárya, it is asked, "Where is it?" Those who advocate the sanctity of
the Bhágavata reply, "It was written in a difficult style, and became
obsolete, and is lost." "A very unsatisfactory plea," retort their
opponents, "for we still have the works of Śankara, several of which are
quite as difficult as any in the Sanscrit language." The existence of
this comment, too, rests upon the authority of Mádhwa or Mádhava, who in
a commentary of his own asserts that he has consulted eight others. Now
amongst these is one by the monkey Hanumán; and although a Hindu
disputant may believe in the reality of such a composition, yet we may
receive its citation as a proof that Mádhwa was not very scrupulous in
the verification of his authorities.

There are other topics urged in this controversy on both sides, some of
which are simple enough, some are ingenious: but the statement of the
text is of itself sufficient to shew that according to the received
opinion of all the authorities of the priority of the eighteen Puráńas
to the Bhárata, it is impossible that the Śrí Bhágavata, which is
subsequent to the Bhárata, should be of the number; and the evidence of
style, the superiority of which to that of the Puráńas in general is
admitted by the disputants, is also proof that it is the work of a
different hand. Whether the Deví Bhágavata have a better title to be
considered as an original composition of Vyása, is equally questionable;
but it cannot be doubted that the Śrí Bhágavata is the product of
uninspired erudition. There does not seem to be any other ground than
tradition for ascribing it to Vopadeva the grammarian; but there is no
reason to call the tradition in question. Vopadeva flourished at the
court of Hemádri, Rájá of Devagiri, Deogur or Dowlutabad, and must
consequently have lived prior to the conquest of that principality by
the Mohammedans in the fourteenth century. The date of the twelfth
century, commonly assigned to him, is probably correct, and is that of
the Bhágavata Puráńa.
