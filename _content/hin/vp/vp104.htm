<p>I WILL first relate to you the family of Yadu, the eldest son of Yay&aacute;ti, in which the eternal immutable Vishn&#769;u descended upon earth in a portion of his essence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1099"></A><A HREF="#fn_1099"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; of which the glory cannot be described, though for ever hymned in order to confer the fruit of all their wishes--whether they desired virtue, wealth, pleasure, or liberation--upon all created beings, upon men, saints, heavenly quiristers, spirits of evil, nymphs, centaurs, serpents, birds, demons, gods, sages, Brahmans, and ascetics. Whoever hears the account of the race of Yadu shall be released from all sin; for the supreme spirit, that is without form, and which is called Vishn&#769;u, was manifested in this family.</p>  
<p>Yadu had four sons, Sahasrajit, Krosht&#769;i, Nala, and Raghu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1100"></A><A HREF="#fn_1100"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. &#346;atajit was the son of the elder of these, and he had three sons, Haihaya, Ven&#769;u&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1101"></A><A HREF="#fn_1101"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and Haya.

Kritav&iacute;ryya's son was Arjuna, the sovereign of the seven Dw&iacute;pas, the lord of a thousand arms. This prince propitiated the sage Datt&aacute;treya, the descendant of Atri, who was a portion of Vishn&#769;u, and solicited and obtained from him these boons--a thousand arms; never acting unjustly; subjugation of the world by justice, and protecting it equitably; victory over his enemies; and death by the hands of a person renowned in the three regions of the universe. With these means he ruled over the whole earth with might and justice, and offered ten thousand sacrifices. Of him this verse is still recited; "The kings of the earth will assuredly never pursue his steps in sacrifice, in munificence, in devotion, in courtesy, and in self-control." In his reign nothing was lost or injured; and so he governed the whole earth with undiminished health, prosperity, power, and might, for eighty five thousand years. Whilst sporting in the waters of the Narmad&aacute;, and elevated with wine, R&aacute;van&#769;a came on his tour of triumph to the city M&aacute;hishmat&iacute;, and there he who boasted of overthrowing the gods, the Daityas, the Gandharbas and their king, was taken prisoner by K&aacute;rttav&iacute;rya, and confined like a tame beast in a corner of his capital&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1108"></A><A HREF="#fn_1108"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>.

The Br&aacute;hma and Hari V. make him the son of Vrisha, but do not say whose son Vrisha was. The commentator on the latter asserts that the name is a synonyme of Payoda, the son of Yadu, according to his authority, and to that alone.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1117"></A><A HREF="vp104.htm#fr_1117">418:19</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata agrees with our text, but the Br&aacute;hma, Hari V., Linga, and K&uacute;rma make Vrishan&#769;a the son of Madhu, and derive the family name of Vrishn&#769;is or V&aacute;rshn&#769;eyas from him.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1118"></A><A HREF="vp104.htm#fr_1118">418:20</A> The text takes no notice of some collateral tribes, which appear to merit remark. Most of the other authorities, in mentioning the sons of Jayadhwaja, observe that from them came the five great divisions of the Haihaya tribe. These, according to the V&aacute;yu, were the T&aacute;lajanghas, V&iacute;tihotras, &Aacute;vantyas, Tun&#769;d&#769;ikeras, and J&aacute;tas. The Matsya and Agni omit the first, and substitute Bhojas; and the latter are included in the list in the Br&aacute;hma, Padma, Linga, and Hari V. For J&aacute;tas the reading is Sanj&aacute;tas or Suj&aacute;tas. The Br&aacute;hma P. has also Bh&aacute;ratas, who, as well as the Suj&aacute;tas, are not commonly specified, it is said, 'from their great number.' They are in all probability invented by the compiler out of the names of the text, Bharata and Suj&aacute;ti. The situation of these tribes is central India, for the capital of the T&aacute;lajanghas was M&aacute;hishmat&iacute; or Chul&iacute;-Maheswar, still called, according to Col. Tod, Sahasra-b&aacute;huki-basti, 'the village of the thousand-armed;' that is, of K&aacute;rttav&iacute;ryya. Annals of Rajasthan, I. 39. n. The Tun&#769;d&#769;ikeras and V&iacute;tihotras are placed in the geographical lists behind the Vindhyan mountains, and the termination -kaira is common in the valley of the Narmad&aacute;, as Bairkaira, &amp;c., or we may have Tun&#769;d&#769;ikera abbreviated, as Tun&#769;d&#769;ari on the Tapti. The &Aacute;vantyas were in Ujayin, and the Bhojas were in the neighbourhood probably of Dh&aacute;r in Malwa. These tribes must have preceded, then, the Rajput tribes, by whom these countries are now occupied, or Rahtores, Chauhans, Pawars, Gehlotes, and the rest. There are still some vestiges of them, and a tribe of Haihayas still exists, at the top of the valley of Sohagpur in Bhagel-khan&#769;d&#769;, aware of their ancient lineage, and though <a name="page_419"><font size="1" color="green">p. 419</font></A> few in number, celebrated for their valour. Tod's Rajasthan, I. 39. The scope of the traditions regarding them, especially of their overrunning the country, along with &#346;akas and other foreign tribes, in the reign preceding that of Sagara (see p. 373), indicates their foreign origin also; and if we might trust to verbal resemblances, we might suspect that the Hayas and Haihayas of the Hindus had some connexion with the Hia, Hoiei-ke, Hoiei-hu, and similarly denominated Hun or Turk tribes, who make a figure in Chinese history. Des Guignes, Histoire des Huns, I. 7, 55, 231. II. 253, &amp;c. At the same time it is to be observed that these tribes do not make their appearance until some centuries after the Christian era, and the scene of their first exploits is far from the frontiers of India: the coincidence of appellation may be therefore merely accidental. In the word Haya, which properly means 'a horse,' it is not impossible, however, that we have a confirmatory evidence of the Scythian origin of the Haihayas, as Col. Tod supposed; although we cannot with him imagine the word 'horse' itself is derived from haya. Rajasthan, I. 76.</P>
