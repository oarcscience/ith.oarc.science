<p>17. G&aacute;rud&#769;a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. "That which Vishn&#769;u recited in the G&aacute;rud&#769;a Kalpa, relating chiefly to the birth of G&aacute;rud&#769;a from Vinat&aacute;, is here called the G&aacute;rud&#769;a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a; and in it there are read nineteen thousand verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A>."</p>  
<p>The G&aacute;rud&#769;a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a which has been the subject of my examination corresponds in no respect with this description, and is probably a different work, though entitled the G&aacute;rud&#769;a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. It is identical, however, with two copies in the Company's library. It consists of no more than about seven thousand stanzas; it is repeated by Brahm&aacute; to Indra; and it contains no account of the birth of Garuda. There is a brief notice of the creation; but the greater part is occupied with the description of Vratas, or religious observances, of holidays, of sacred places dedicated to the sun, and with prayers from the T&aacute;ntrika ritual, addressed to the sun, to &#346;iva, and to Vishn&#769;u. It contains also treatises on astrology, palmistry, and precious stones; and one, still more extensive, on medicine. The latter portion, called the Preta Kalpa, is taken up with directions for the performance of obsequial rites. There is nothing in</p>

<p>all this to justify the application of the name. Whether a genuine G&aacute;rud&#769;a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a exists is doubtful. The description given in the Matsya is less particular than even the brief notices of the other Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, and might have easily been written without any knowledge of the book itself, being, with exception of the number of stanzas, confined to circumstances that the title alone indicates.</p>
