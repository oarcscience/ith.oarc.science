THE last of the Vríhadratha dynasty, Ripunjaya, will have a minister
named Sunika <span id="fr_1353"></span>[1](#fn_1353), who having killed
his sovereign, will place his son Pradyota upon the throne <span
id="fr_1354"></span>[2](#fn_1354): his son will be Pálaka <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[3](#fn_1355); his son will be Viśákhayúpa <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[4](#fn_1356); his son will be Janaka <span
id="fr_1357"></span>[5](#fn_1357); and his son will be
Nandivarddhana <span id="fr_1358"></span>[6](#fn_1358). These five kings
of the house of Pradyota will reign over the earth for a hundred and
thirty-eight years <span id="fr_1359"></span>[7](#fn_1359).

The next prince will be Śiśunaga <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[8](#fn_1360); his son will be Kákavarńa <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[9](#fn_1361); his son will be Kshemadharman <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[10](#fn_1362); his son will be Kshatraujas <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[11](#fn_1363); his son will be Vidmisára <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[12](#fn_1364); his son will be Ájátaśatru <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[13](#fn_1365); his son will be

<span id="page_467">p. 467</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dharbaka <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[14](#fn_1366); his son will be Udayáśwa <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[15](#fn_1367); his son will also be Nandivarddhana;
and his son will be Mahánandi <span id="fr_1368"></span>[16](#fn_1368).
These ten Śaiśunágas will be kings of the earth for three hundred and
sixty-two years <span id="fr_1369"></span>[17](#fn_1369).

The son of Mahánanda will be born of a woman of the Śúdra or servile
class; his name will be Nanda, called Mahápadma, for he will be
exceedingly avaricious <span id="fr_1370"></span>[18](#fn_1370). Like
another Paraśuráma, he will be the annihilator of the Kshatriya race;
for after him the kings of the earth will be Śúdras. He will bring the
whole earth under one umbrella: he

<span id="page_468">p. 468</span>

will have eight sons, Sumálya and others, who will reign after
Mahápadma; and he and his sons <span id="fr_1371"></span>[19](#fn_1371)
will govern for a hundred years. The Brahman Kaut́ilya will root out the
nine Nandas <span id="fr_1372"></span>[20](#fn_1372)

Upon the cessation of the race of Nanda, the Mauryas will possess the
earth, for Kant́ilya will place Chandragupta <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[21](#fn_1373) on the throne: his son

<span id="page_469">p. 469</span>

will be Vindusára <span id="fr_1374"></span>[22](#fn_1374); his son will
be Aśokavarddhana <span id="fr_1375"></span>[23](#fn_1375); his son will
be

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Suyaśas <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[24](#fn_1376); his son will be Daśaratha; his son
will be Sangata; his son will be Śáliśúka; his son will be Somaśarmman;
his son will be Saśadharman <span id="fr_1377"></span>[25](#fn_1377);
and his successor will be Vrihadratha. These are the ten Mauryas, who
will reign over the earth for a hundred and thirty-seven years <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[26](#fn_1378).

The dynasty of the Śungas will next become possessed of the sovereignty;
for Pushpamitra, the general of the last Maurya prince, will

<span id="page_471">p. 471</span>

put his master to death, and ascend the throne <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[27](#fn_1379): his son will be Agnimitra <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[28](#fn_1380); his son will be Sujyesht́ha <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[29](#fn_1381); his son will be Vasumitra <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[30](#fn_1382); his son will be Árdraka <span
id="fr_1383"></span>[31](#fn_1383); his son will be Pulindaka <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[32](#fn_1384); his son will be Ghoshavasu <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[33](#fn_1385); his son will be Vajramitra <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[34](#fn_1386); his son will be Bhágavata <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[35](#fn_1387); his son will be Devabhúti <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[36](#fn_1388). These are the ten Śungas, who will
govern the kingdom for a hundred and twelve years <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[37](#fn_1389).

Devabhúti, the last Śunga prince, being addicted to, immoral
indulgences, his minister, the Kańwa named Vasudeva will murder him, and
usurp the kingdom: his son will be Bhúmimitra; his son will be Náráyańa;
his son will be Suśarman. These four Káńwas will be kings of the earth
for forty-five years <span id="fr_1390"></span>[38](#fn_1390).

<span id="page_472">p. 472</span>

Suśarman the Káńwa will be killed by a powerful servant named Śipraka,
of the Ándhra tribe, who will become king, and found the Ándhrabhritya
dynasty <span id="fr_1391"></span>[39](#fn_1391): he will be succeeded
by his brother Krishńa <span id="fr_1392"></span>[40](#fn_1392); his son
will be Śrí Śátakarńi <span id="fr_1393"></span>[41](#fn_1393); his son
will be Púrnotsanga <span id="fr_1394"></span>[42](#fn_1394); his son
will be Śátakarńi (2nd) <span id="fr_1395"></span>[43](#fn_1395); his
son will be Lambodara <span id="fr_1396"></span>[44](#fn_1396); his son
will be Ivílaka <span id="fr_1397"></span>[45](#fn_1397); his son will
be Meghaswáti <span id="fr_1398"></span>[46](#fn_1398); his son will be
Patumat <span id="fr_1399"></span>[47](#fn_1399); his

<span id="page_473">p. 473</span>

son will be Arisht́akarman <span id="fr_1400"></span>[48](#fn_1400); his
son will be Hála <span id="fr_1401"></span>[49](#fn_1401); his son will
be Tálaka <span id="fr_1402"></span>[50](#fn_1402); his son will be
Pravilasena <span id="fr_1403"></span>[51](#fn_1403); his son will be
Sundara, named Śátakarńi <span id="fr_1404"></span>[52](#fn_1404); his
son will be Chakora Śátakarńi <span id="fr_1405"></span>[53](#fn_1405);
his son will be Śivaswáti <span id="fr_1406"></span>[54](#fn_1406); his
son will be Gomatiputra <span id="fr_1407"></span>[55](#fn_1407); his
son will be Pulimat <span id="fr_1408"></span>[56](#fn_1408); his son
will be Śivaśrí Śátakarńi <span id="fr_1409"></span>[57](#fn_1409); his
son will be Śivaskandha <span id="fr_1410"></span>[58](#fn_1410); his
son will be Yajnaśrí <span id="fr_1411"></span>[59](#fn_1411); his son
will be Vijaya <span id="fr_1412"></span>[60](#fn_1412); his son will be
Chandraśrí <span id="fr_1413"></span>[61](#fn_1413); his son will be
Pulomárchish <span id="fr_1414"></span>[62](#fn_1414). These thirty
Andhrabhritya kings will reign four hundred and fifty-six years <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[63](#fn_1415).

<span id="page_474">p. 474</span>

After these, various races will reign, as seven Ábhíras, ten Garddhabas,
sixteen Śakas, eight Yavanas, fourteen Tusháras, thirteen Muńd́as,

<span id="page_475">p. 475</span>

eleven Maunas, altogether seventy-nine princes <span
id="fr_1416"></span>[64](#fn_1416), who will be sovereigns

<span id="page_476">p. 476</span>

of the earth for one thousand three hundred and ninety years; and

<span id="page_477">p. 477</span>

then eleven Pauras will be kings for three hundred years <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[65](#fn_1417). When they are destroyed, the
Kailakila Yavanas will be kings; the chief of whom will be Vindhyaśakti;
his son will be Puranjaya; his son will be Rámachandra; his son will be
Adharma, from whom will be Varánga, Kritanandana, Śudhinandi,
Nandiyaśas, Śiśuka, and Pravíra; these will rule for a hundred and six
years <span id="fr_1418"></span>[66](#fn_1418). From them will proceed
thirteen sons;

<span id="page_478">p. 478</span>

then three Báhlíkas, and Pushpamitra, and Pat́umitra, and others, to the
number of thirteen, will rule over Mekala <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[67](#fn_1419). There will be nine

<span id="page_479">p. 479</span>

kings in the seven Koalas, and there will be as many Naishadha
princes <span id="fr_1420"></span>[68](#fn_1420).

In Magadhá a sovereign named Viśwasphat́ika will establish other tribes;
he will extirpate the Kshatriya or martial race, and elevate fishermen,
barbarians, and Brahmans, and other castes, to power <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[69](#fn_1421). The nine Nágas will reign in
Padmávati, Kántipuri, and Mathurá; and the Guptas of Magadhá along the
Ganges to Prayága <span id="fr_1422"></span>[70](#fn_1422). A prince
named

<span id="page_480">p. 480</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Devarakshita will
reign, in a city on the sea shore, over the Kośalas, Od́ras, Puńd́ras, and
Támraliptas <span id="fr_1423"></span>[71](#fn_1423). The Guhas will
possess Kálinga, Máhihaka, and the mountains of Mahendra <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[72](#fn_1424). The race of Mańidhanu will occupy
the countries of the Nishádas, Naimishikas, and Kálatoyas <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[73](#fn_1425).

<span id="page_481">p. 481</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The people called
Kanakas will possess the Amazon country, and that called Múshika <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[74](#fn_1426). Men of the three tribes, but
degraded, and Ábhíras and Śúdras, will occupy Śaurásht́ra, Avanti, Śúra,
Arbuda, and Marubhúmi: and Śúdras, outcastes, and barbarians will be
masters of the banks of the Indus, Dárvika, the Chandrabhágá, and
Káshmir <span id="fr_1427"></span>[75](#fn_1427).

<span id="page_482">p. 482</span>

These will all be contemporary monarchs, reigning over the earth; kings
of churlish spirit, violent temper, and ever addicted to falsehood and
wickedness. They will inflict death on women, children, and cows; they
will seize upon the property of their subjects; they will be of limited
power, and will for the most part rapidly rise and fall; their lives
will be short, their desires insatiable, and they will display but
little piety. The people of the various countries intermingling with
them will follow their example, and the barbarians being powerful in the
patronage of the princes, whilst purer tribes are neglected, the people
will perish <span id="fr_1428"></span>[76](#fn_1428). Wealth and piety
will decrease day by day, until

<span id="page_483">p. 483</span>

the world will be wholly depraved. Then property alone will confer rank;
wealth will be the only source of devotion; passion will be the sole
bond of union between the sexes; falsehood will be the only means of
success in litigation; and women will be objects merely of sensual
gratification. Earth will be venerated but for its mineral
treasures <span id="fr_1429"></span>[77](#fn_1429); the Brahmanical
thread will constitute a Brahman; external types (as the staff and red
garb) will be the only distinctions of the several orders of life;
dishonesty will be the universal means of subsistence; weakness will be
the cause of dependance; menace and presumption will be substituted for
learning; liberality will be devotion; simple ablution will be
purification <span id="fr_1430"></span>[78](#fn_1430); mutual assent
will be marriage; fine clothes will be dignity <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[79](#fn_1431); and water afar off will be esteemed
a holy spring. Amidst all castes he who is the strongest will reign over
a principality thus vitiated by many faults. The people, unable to bear
the heavy burdens imposed upon them by their avaricious sovereigns, will
take refuge amongst the valleys of the mountains, and will be glad to
feed upon wild honey, herbs, roots, fruits, flowers, and leaves: their
only covering will be the bark of trees, and they will be exposed to the
cold, and wind, and sun, and rain. No man's life will exceed three and
twenty years. Thus in the Kali age shall decay constantly proceed, until
the human race approaches its annihilation.

When the practices taught by the Vedas and the institutes of law shall
nearly have ceased, and the close of the Kali age shall be nigh, a

<span id="page_484">p. 484</span>

portion of that divine being who exists of his own spiritual nature in
the character of Brahma, and who is the beginning and the end, and who
comprehends all things, shall descend upon earth: he will be born in the
family of Vishńuyaśas, an eminent Brahman of Sambhala village, as Kalki,
endowed with the eight superhuman faculties. By his irresistible might
he will destroy all the Mlechchhas and thieves, and all whose minds are
devoted to iniquity. He will then reestablish righteousness upon earth;
and the minds of those who live at the end of the Kali age shall be
awakened, and shall be as pellucid as crystal. The men who are thus
changed by virtue of that peculiar time shall be as the seeds of human
beings, and shall give birth to a race who shall follow the laws of the
Krita age, or age of purity. As it is said; "When the sun and moon, and
the lunar asterism Tishya, and the planet Jupiter, are in one mansion,
the Krita age shall return <span id="fr_1432"></span>[80](#fn_1432)."

Thus, most excellent Muni, the kings who are past, who are present, and
who are to be, have been enumerated. From the birth of Paríkshit to the
coronation of Nanda it is to be known that 1015 years have elapsed <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[81](#fn_1433). When the two first stars of the
seven Rishis (the great Bear)

<span id="page_485">p. 485</span>

rise in the heavens, and some lunar asterism is seen at night at an
equal distance between them, then the seven Rishis continue stationary
in that conjunction for a hundred years of men <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[82](#fn_1434). At the birth of

<span id="page_486">p. 486</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Paríkshit they
were in Maghá, and the Kali age then commenced, which consists of 1200
(divine) years. When the portion of Vishńu (that had been born from
Vasudeva) returned to heaven, then the Kali age commenced. As long as
the earth was touched by his sacred feet, the Kali age could not affect
it. As soon as the incarnation of the eternal Vishńu had departed, the
son of Dharma, Yudhisht́hira, with his brethren, abdicated the
sovereignty. Observing unpropitious portents, consequent upon Krishńa's
disappearance, he placed Paríkshit upon the throne. When the seven
Rishis are in Purváshád́há, then Nanda will begin to reign <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[83](#fn_1435), and thenceforward the influence of
the Kali will augment.

<span id="page_487">p. 487</span>

The day that Krishńa shall have departed from the earth will be the
first of the Kali age, the duration of which you shall hear; it will
continue for 360,000 years of mortals. After twelve hundred divine years
shall have elapsed, the Krita age shall be renewed.

Thus age after age Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaiśyas, and Śúdras, excellent
Brahman, men of great souls, have passed away by thousands; whose names
and tribes and families I have not enumerated to you, from their great
number, and the repetition of appellations it would involve. Two
persons, Devápi of the race of Puru, and Maru of the family of Ikshwáku,
through the force of devotion continue alive throughout the whole four
ages, residing at the village of Kalápa: they will return hither in the
beginning of the Krita age, and, becoming members of the family of the
Manu, give origin to the Kshatriya dynasties <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[84](#fn_1436). In this manner the earth is
possessed through every series of the three first ages, the Krita,
Treta, and Dwápara, by the sons of the Manu; and some remain in the Kali
age, to serve as the rudiments of renewed generations, in the same way
as Devápi and Maru are still in existence.

I have now given you a summary account of the sovereigns of the earth;
to recapitulate the whole would be impossible even in a hundred lives.
These and other kings, who with perishable frames have possessed this
ever-during world, and who, blinded with deceptive notions of individual
occupation, have indulged the feeling that suggests, "This earth is
mine--it is my son's--it belongs to my dynasty," have all passed away.
So, many who reigned before them, many who succeeded them, and many who
are yet to come, have ceased, or will cease, to be. Earth laughs, as if
smiling with autumnal flowers, to behold her kings unable to effect the
subjugation of themselves. I will repeat to you, Maitreya, the stanzas
that were chanted by Earth, and which the Muni Asita communicated to
Janaka, whose banner was virtue. "How great is the folly of princes, who
are endowed with the faculty of reason, to cherish

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

the confidence of ambition, when they themselves are but foam upon the
wave. Before they have subdued themselves, they seek to reduce their
ministers, their servants, their subjects, under their authority; they
then endeavour to overcome their foes. 'Thus,' say they, 'will we
conquer the ocean-circled earth;' and, intent upon their project, behold
not death, which is not far off. But what mighty matter is the
subjugation of the sea-girt earth to one who can subdue himself.
Emancipation from existence is the fruit of self-control. It is through
infatuation that kings desire to possess me, whom their predecessors
have been forced to leave, whom their fathers have not retained.
Beguiled by the selfish love of sway, fathers contend with sons, and
brothers with brothers, for my possession. Foolishness has been the
character of every king who has boasted, 'All this earth is mine--every
thing is mine--it will be in my house for ever;' for he is dead. How is
it possible that such vain desires should survive in the hearts of his
descendants, who have seen their progenitor, absorbed by the thirst of
dominion, compelled to relinquish me, whom he called his own, and tread
the path of dissolution? When I hear a king sending word to another by
his ambassador, 'This earth is mine; immediately resign your pretensions
to it;' I am moved to violent laughter at first, but it soon subsides in
pity for the infatuated fool."

These were the verses, Maitreya, which Earth recited, and by listening
to which ambition fades away like snow before the sun. I have now
related to you the whole account of the descendants of the Manu; amongst
whom have flourished kings endowed with a portion of Vishńu, engaged in
the preservation of the earth. Whoever shall listen reverently and with
faith to this narrative, proceeding from the posterity of Manu, shall be
purified entirely from all his sins, and, with the perfect possession of
his faculties, shall live in unequalled affluence, plenty, and
prosperity. He who has heard of the races of the sun and moon, of
Ikshwá.ku, Jahnu, Mańd́hátri, Sagara, and Raghu, who have all perished;
of Yayáti, Nahusha, and their posterity, who are no more; of kings of
great might, resistless valour, and unbounded wealth, who have been
overcome by still more powerful time, and are now only a tale; he will
learn wisdom, and forbear to call either children, or wife, or house, or

<span id="page_489">p. 489</span>

lands, or wealth, his own. The arduous penances that have been performed
by heroic men obstructing fate for countless years, religious rites and
sacrifices of great efficacy and virtue, have been made by time the
subject only of narration. The valiant Prithu traversed the universe,
every where triumphant over his foes; yet he was blown away, like the
light down of the Simal tree, before the blast of time. He who was
Kártavíryya subdued innumerable enemies, and conquered the seven zones
of the earth; but now he is only the topic of a theme, a subject for
affirmation and contradiction <span id="fr_1437"></span>[85](#fn_1437).
Fie upon the empire of the sons of Raghu, who triumphed over Daśánana,
and extended their sway to the ends of the earth; for was it not
consumed in an instant by the frown of the destroyer? Mańd́hátri, the
emperor of the universe, is embodied only in a legend; and what pious
man who hears it will ever be so unwise as to cherish the desire of
possession in his soul? Bhagíratha, Sagara, Kakutstha, Daśánana, Ráma,
Lakshmana, Yudhisht́hira, and others, have been. Is it so? Have they ever
really existed? Where are they now? we know not! The powerful kings who
now are, or who will be, as I have related them to you, or any others
who are unspecified, are all subject to the same fate, and the present
and the future will perish and be forgotten, like their predecessors.
Aware of this truth, a wise man will never be influenced by the
principle of individual appropriation; and regarding them as only
transient and temporal possessions, he will not consider children and
posterity, lands and property, or whatever else is personal, to be his
own.

Bauddhas. Vidmisára, read also Vindhusára, Vilwisára, &c., is most
probably their Vimbasára, who was born at the same time with Śákya, and
was reigning at Rájgriha when he began his religious career. The
Maháwanśo says that Siddhatto and Bimbisaro were attached <span
id="page_467">p. 467</span> friends, as their fathers had been before
them: [p. 10](vp036.htm#page_10). Śákya is said to have died in the
reign of Ajátaśatru, the son of Vimbasára, in the eighth year of his
reign. The Váyu transposes these names, and the Matsya still more alters
the order of Ajátaśatru; but the Bhágavata concurs with our text. The
Buddhist authority differs from the Puráńas materially as to the
duration of the reigns, giving to Bimbisaro 52 years, and to Ajatasattu
32: the latter, according to the same, murdered his father. Maháwanśo,
p. 10. We may therefore with some confidence claim for these princes a
date of about six centuries B. C. They are considered co-temporary with
Sudhodana, &c. in the list of the Aikshwákavas ([p.
463](vp115.htm#page_463). n. [20](vp115.htm#fn_1327)).

<span id="fn_1366"></span>[467:14](vp117.htm#fr_1366) Harshaka, 25 yrs.
V.; Vansaka, 24, M.

<span id="fn_1367"></span>[467:15](vp117.htm#fr_1367) 33 yrs. V.; Udibhi
or Udásin, 33, M. According to the Váyu, Udaya or Udayáśwa founded
Kusumapur or Pát́aliputra, on the southern angle of the Ganges. The
legends of Śákya, consistently with this tradition, take no notice of
this city in his peregrinations on either bank of the Ganges. The
Maháwanśo calls the son and successor of Ajátaśatru, Udayibhadako
(Udayinhhadraka): p. 15.

<span id="fn_1368"></span>[467:16](vp117.htm#fr_1368) 42 and 43 yrs. V.;
40 and 43, M. The Maháwanśo has in place of these, Anuruddhako, Mundo,
and Nágadáso; all in succession parricides: the last deposed by an
insurrection of the people: p. 15.

<span id="fn_1369"></span>[467:17](vp117.htm#fr_1369) The several
authorities agree in the number of ten Śaiśunágas, and in the aggregate
years of their reigns, which the Matsya and the Bhágavata call 360: the
Váyu has 362, with which the several periods correspond: the details of
the Matsya give 363. The Váyu and Matsya call the Śaiśunágas,
Kshatrabandhus, which may designate an inferior order of Kshatriyas:
they also observe, that cotemporary with the dynasties already
specified, the Pauravas, the Várhadrathas, and Mágadhas, there were
other races of royal descent; as, Aikshwákava princes, 24: Pánchálas,
25, V.; 27, M: Kálakas or Kásakas or Káseyas, 24: Haihayas, 24, V.; 28,
M.: Kálingas, 32, V.; 40, M.: Śakas, V.; Aśmakas, M., 25: Kuravas, 26:
Maithilas, 28: Śúrasenas, 23: and Vitihotras, 20.

<span id="fn_1370"></span>[467:18](vp117.htm#fr_1370) The Bhágavata
calls him Mahápadmapati, the lord of Mahápadma; which the commentator
interprets, 'sovereign of an infinite host,' or 'of immense wealth;'
Mahápadma signifying 100.000 millions. The Váyu and Matsya, however,
consider Mahápadma as another name of Nanda.

<span id="fn_1371"></span>[468:19](vp117.htm#fr_1371) So the Bhágavata
also; but it would be more compatible with chronology to consider the
nine Nandas as so many descents. The Váyu and Matsya give eighty-eight
years to Mahápadma, and only the remaining twelve to Sumálya and the
rest of the remaining eight; these twelve years being occupied with the
efforts of Kaut́ilya to expel the Nandas. The Maháwanśo, evidently
intending the same events, gives names and circumstances differently; it
may be doubted if with more accuracy. On the deposal of Nágadáso, the
people raised to the throne the minister Susunágo, who reigned eighteen
years. This prince is evidently confounded with the Śiśuuága of the
Puráńas. He was succeeded by his son Kálásoko, who reigned twenty years;
and he was succeeded by his sons, ten of whom reigned together for
twenty-two years: subsequently there were nine, who, according to their
seniority, reigned for twenty-two years. The Brahman Chanako put the
ninth surviving brother, named Dhana-Nando (Rich-Nanda), to death, and
installed Chandagutto. Maháwanśo, p. 15 and 21. These particulars,
notwithstanding the alteration of some of the names, belong clearly to
one story; and that of the Buddhists looks as if it was borrowed and
modified from that of the Brahmans. The commentary on the Maháwanśo,
translated by Mr. Turnour (Introduction, p. xxxviii.), calls the sons of
Kálásoko 'the nine Nandas;' but another Buddhist authority, the
Dípawanśo, omits Kálásoko, and says that Susunágo had ten brothers, who
after his demise reigned collectively twenty-two years. Journal of the
As. Soc. of Bengal, Nov. 1838, p. 930.

<span id="fn_1372"></span>[468:20](vp117.htm#fr_1372) For the
particulars of the story here alluded to, see the Mudrá Rákshasa, Hindu
Theatre, vol. II. Kaut́ilya is also called, according to the commentator
on our text, Vátsyáyana, Vishńugupta, and Cháńakya. According to the
Matsya P., Kant́ilya retained the regal authority for a century; but
there is some inaccuracy in the copies.

<span id="fn_1373"></span>[468:21](vp117.htm#fr_1373) This is the most
important name in all the lists, as it can scarcely be doubted that he
is the Sandrocottus, or, as Athenæus writes more correctly, the
Sandrocoptus, of the Greeks, as I have endeavoured to prove in the
introduction to the Mudrá Rákshasa. The relative positions of
Chandragupta, Vidmisára, or Bimbisára, and Ajátaśatru, serve to confirm
the identification. Śákya was cotemporary with both the latter, dying in
the eighth year of Ajátaśatru's reign. The Maháwanśo says he reigned
twenty-four years afterwards; but the Váyu makes his whole reign but
twenty-five years, which would place the close of it B. C. 526. The rest
of the Śaiśunága dynasty, according to the Váyu and Matsya, reigned 143
or 140 years; bringing their close to B. C. 383. Another century being
deducted for the duration of the Nandas, would place the accession of
<span id="page_469">p. 469</span> Chandragupta B. C. 283. Chandragupta
was the cotemporary of Seleucus Nicator, who began his reign B. C. 310,
and concluded a treaty with him B. C. 305. Although therefore his date
may not be made out quite correctly from the Pauráńik premises, yet the
error cannot be more than twenty or thirty years. The result is much
nearer the truth than that furnished by Buddhist authorities. According
to the Maháwanśo a hundred years had elapsed from the death of Buddha to
the tenth year of the reign of Kálásoko (p. 15). He reigned other ten
years, and his sons forty-four, making a total of 154 years between the
death of Śákya and the accession of Chandragupta, which is consequently
placed B. C. 389, or above seventy years too early. According to the
Buddhist authorities, Chan-ta-kutta or Chandragupta commenced his reign
396 B. C. Burmese Table; Prinsep's Useful Tables. Mr. Turnour, in his
Introduction, giving to Kálásoko eighteen years subsequent to the
century after Buddha, places Chandragupta's accession B. C. 381, which,
he observes, is sixty years too soon; dating, however, the accession of
Chandragupta front 323 B. C. or immediately upon Alexander's death, a
period too early by eight or ten years at least. The discrepancy of
dates, Mr. Turnour is disposed to think, proceeds from some intentional
perversion of the buddhistical chronology. Introd. p. L. The commentator
on our text says that Chandragupta was the son of Nanda by a wife named
Murá, whence he and his descendants were called Mauryas. Col. Tod
considers Maurya a corruption of Mori, the name of a Rajput tribe. The
T́íka on the Maháwanśo builds a story on the fancied resemblance of the
word to Mayúra, S. Mori, Pr. 'a peacock.' There being abundance of
pea-fowl in the place where the Sákya tribe built a town, they called it
Mori, and there princes were thence called Mauryas. Turnour,
Introduction to the Maháwanśo, p. xxxix. Chandragupta reigned, according
to the Váyu P., 24 years; according to the Maháwanśo, 34; to the
Dípawasanśo, 24.

<span id="fn_1374"></span>[469:22](vp117.htm#fr_1374) So the Maháwanśo,
Bindusáro. Burmese Table, Bin-tu-sara. The Váyu has Bhadrasára, 25
years; the Bhágavata, Várisára. The Matsya names but four princes of
this race, although it concurs with the others in stating the series to
consist of ten. The names are also differently arranged, and one is
peculiar: they are, Śatadhanwan, Vrihadratha, Śuka, and Daśaratha.

<span id="fn_1375"></span>[469:23](vp117.htm#fr_1375) Aśoka, 36 years,
Váyu; Śuka, 26, Mats.; Aśokavarddhana, Bhág.; Aśoko and Dhammaśoko,
Maháwanśo. This king is the most celebrated of any in the annals of the
Buddhists. In the commencement of his reign he followed the Brahmanical
faith, but became a convert to that of Buddha, and a zealous encourager
of it. He is said to have maintained in his palace 64,000 Buddhist
priests, and to have erected 84,000 columns or topes throughout India. A
great convocation of Buddhist priests was held in the eighteenth year of
his reign, which was followed by missions to Ceylon and other places.
According to Buddhist chronology he ascended the throne 218 years after
the death of Buddha, B. C. 325. As <span id="page_470">p. 470</span> the
grandson of Chandragupta, however, he must have been some time
subsequent to this, or, agreeably to the joint duration of the reigns of
Chandragupta and Bindusára, supposing the former to have commenced his
reign about B. C. 315, forty-nine years later, or B. C. 266. The
duration of his reign is said to have been thirty-six years, bringing it
down to B. C. 230: but if we deduct these periods from the date
assignable to Chandragupta, of B. C. 283, we shall place Aśoka's reign
from B. C. 234 to 198. Now it is certain that a number of very curious
inscriptions, on columns and rocks, by a Buddhist prince, in an ancient
form of letter, and the Páli language, exist in India; and that some of
them refer to Greek princes, who can be no other than members of the
Seleucidan and Ptolemæan dynasties, and are probably Antiochus the Great
and Ptolemy Euergetes, kings of Syria and Egypt in the latter part of
the third century before Christ. Journal of the Asiatic Society of
Bengal, February and March, 1838. The Indian king appears always under
the appellation Piyadaśí or Priyadarśín, 'the beautiful;' and is
entitled Devánam-piya, 'the beloved of the gods.' According to Buddhist
authorities, the Rasawáhiní and Dípawanśo, quoted by Mr. Turnour (J. As.
Soc. of Bengal, Dec. 1837, p. 1056, and Nov. 1838, p. 930), Piyadaśí or
Piyadaśano is identified both by name and circumstances with Aśoka, and
to him therefore the inscriptions must be attributed. Their purport
agrees well enough with his character, and their wide diffusion with the
traditionary report of the number of his monuments. His date is not
exactly that of Antiochus the Great, but it is not very far different,
and the corrections required to make it correspond are no more than the
inexact manner in which both Brahmanical and Buddhist chronology is
preserved may well be expected to render necessary.

<span id="fn_1376"></span>[470:24](vp117.htm#fr_1376) The name of
Daśaratha, in a similar ancient character as that of Piyadaśí's
inscriptions, has been found at Gaya amongst Buddhist remains, and like
them decyphered by Mr. Prinsep, Journ. As. Soc. Bengal, Aug. 1837, p.
677. A different series of names occurs in the Váyu; or, Kuśala, 8 yrs.;
Bandhupálita, Indrapálita, Daśavarman, 7 yrs.; Śatadhara, 8 yrs.; and
Vrihadaśwa, 7 yrs. The Bhágavata agrees in most of the names, and its
omission of Daśaratha is corrected by the commentator.

<span id="fn_1377"></span>[470:25](vp117.htm#fr_1377) Śatadhanwan, Bhág.

<span id="fn_1378"></span>[470:26](vp117.htm#fr_1378) The Váyu says nine
Sumúrttyas reigned 137 years. The Matsya and Bhágavata have ten Mauryas,
and 137 years. The detailed numbers of the Váyu and Matsya differ from
their totals, but the copies are manifestly corrupt.

<span id="fn_1379"></span>[471:27](vp117.htm#fr_1379) The Bhágavata
omits this name, but states that there were ten Śungas, although,
without Pushpamitra, only nine are named. The Váyu and Matsya have the
same account of the circumstances of his accession to the throne; the
former gives him a reign of sixty, the latter of thirty-six years. In a
play attributed to Kálidása, the Málavikágnimitra, of which Agnimitra is
the hero, his father is alluded to as the Senání or general, as if he
had deposed his master in favour, not of himself, but of his son.
Agnimitra is termed king of Vidiśa, not of Magadhá. Pushpamitra is
represented as engaged in a conflict with the Yavanas on the Indus; thus
continuing the political relations with the Greeks or Scythians of
Bactria and Ariana. See Hindu Theatre, vol. I. 347.

<span id="fn_1380"></span>[471:28](vp117.htm#fr_1380) 8 yrs. V.; omitted
M.

<span id="fn_1381"></span>[471:29](vp117.htm#fr_1381) 7 yrs. V. and M.;
but the latter places him after Vasumitra; and in the drama the son of
Agnimitra is called Vasumitra.

<span id="fn_1382"></span>[471:30](vp117.htm#fr_1382) 8 yrs. V.; 10 yrs.

<span id="fn_1383"></span>[471:31](vp117.htm#fr_1383) Andraka, V.;

V. and M.

<span id="fn_1388"></span>[471:36](vp117.htm#fr_1388) Kshemabhúmi, V.;
Devabhúmi, M.; 10 yrs. both.

<span id="fn_1389"></span>[471:37](vp117.htm#fr_1389) The Bhágavata
says, 'more than a hundred.' The commentator explains it: 112. The Váyu
and Matsya have the same period.

<span id="fn_1390"></span>[471:38](vp117.htm#fr_1390) The names of the
four princes agree in all the authorities. The Matsya transfers the
character of Vyasaní to the minister, with the further addition of his
being a Brahman; Dwija. In the lists given by Sir Wm. Jones and Col.
Wilford, the four Káńwas are said to have reigned 345 years; but in
seven copies of the Vishńu P., from different parts of India, the number
is, as given in the text, forty-five. There is however authority for the
larger number, both in the text of the Bhágavata and the comment. The
former has, \#\#\#\# and the latter, \#\#\# <span id="page_472">p.
472</span> There is no doubt therefore of the purport of the text; and
it is only surprising that such a chronology should have been inserted
in the Bhágavata, not only in opposition to all probability, but to
other authority. The Váyu and Matsya not only confirm the lower number
by stating it as a total, but by giving it in detail; thus:

<div align="center">

|                     |           |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Vasudeva will reign |  9 years  |
| Bhúmimitra          | 14        |
| Náráyańa            | 12        |
| Suśarman            | <u>10</u> |
| Total               | 45        |

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And six copies of
the Matsya concur in this statement.

<span id="fn_1391"></span>[472:39](vp117.htm#fr_1391) The expressions
Andhrajátiyas and Andhrabhrityas have much perplexed Col. Wilford, who
makes three races out of one, Ándhras, Andhrajátiyas, and
Andhrabhrityas. As. Res. IX. 101. There is no warrant for three races in
the Puráńas, although the Matsya, and perhaps the Váyu, distinguishes
two, as we shall hereafter see. Our text has but one, to which all the
terms may be applied. The first of the dynasty was an Ándhra by birth or
caste (játiya), and a servant (bhritya) of the last of the Káńwa race.
So the Váyu; \#\#\#: the Matsya; \#\#\# and the Bhágavata; \#\#\#. The
terms 'an Andhra by caste' and 'a Bhritya or servant,' with the
addition, in the last passage, of Vrishala, 'a Śúdra,' all apply to one
person and one dynasty. Wilford has made wild work with his triad. The
name of the first of this race is variously read: Sindhuka, Váyu;
Śiśuka, Matsya; Balin, Bhág.; and, according to Wilford, Chhismaka in
the Brahmańd́a P., and Śúdraka or Śúraka in the Kumáriká Khańd́a of the
Skánda P. As. Res. IX. 107. He reigned 23 years, Váyu and Matsya. If the
latter form of his name be correct, he may be the king who is spoken of
in the prologue to the Mrichchhakat́í.

<span id="fn_1415"></span>[473:63](vp117.htm#fr_1415) The Váyu and
Bhágavata state also 30 kings, and 456 years; the Matsya has 29 kings,
and 460 years. The actual enumeration of the text gives but 24 names;
that of the Bhágavata but 23; that of the Váyu but 17. The Matsya has
the whole 29 names, adding several to the list of our text; and the
aggregate of the reigns amounts to 435 years and 6 months. The
difference between this and the total specified arises probably from
some inaccuracy in the MSS. As this list appears to be fuller than any
other, it may be advisable to insert it as it occurs in the Radcliffe
copy of the Matsya P.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Several of the
names vary in this list from those in my copy. The adjuncts Swáti and
Śátikarńa appear to be conjoined or not with the other appellations,
according to the convenience of, the metre, and seem to be the family
designations or titles. The dynasty is of considerable chronological
interest, as it admits of some plausible verifications. That a powerful
race of Andhra princes ruled in India in the beginning of the Christian
era, we learn from Pliny, who describes them as possessed of thirty
fortified cities, with an army of 100,000 men and 1000 elephants. The
Andræ of this writer are probably the people of the upper part of the
peninsula, Andhra being the proper designation of Telingana. The
Peutingerian tables, however, place the Andre-Indi on the banks of the
Ganges, and the southern princes may have extended or shifted the site
of their power. Towards the close of the dynasty we find names that
appear to agree with those of princes of middle India, of whom mention
is made by the Chinese; as, Yue-gnai (Yajnaśrí), king of Kiapili, A. D.
408; Des Guignes, I. 45; and Ho-lo-mien (Pulomán), king of Magadhá in
621; ibid. I. 56. The Pauráńik lists place these two princes more nearly
together, but we cannot rely implicitly upon their accuracy. Calculating
from Chandragupta downwards, the Indian date of Yajna and the Chinese
Yue-gnai corresponds; for we have,

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A date remarkably
near that derivable from the Chinese annals. If the Indian Pulomán be
the same with the Chinese Ho-lo-mien, there must be some considerable
omission in the Pauráńik dynasty. There is a farther identification in
the case of Ho-lo-mien, which makes it certain that a prince of Magadhá
is intended, as the place of his residence is called by the Chinese
Kia-so-mo-pulo-ching and Potoli-tse-Ching; or in Sanscrit, Kusuma-pura
and Pát́ali-putra. The equivalent of the latter name consists, not only
in the identity of the sounds Pát́ali and Po-to-li, but in the
translation of 'putra' by 'tse;' each word meaning in their respective
languages 'son.' No doubt can be entertained therefore that the city
intended is the metropolis of Magadhá, Pát́aliputra or Palibothra.
Wilford identifies Pulomat or Pulomán with the Po-lo-muen of the
Chinese; but Des Guignes interprets Po-lo-muen kuë, 'royaume des
Brahmanes.' Buchanan (Hamilton), following the Bhágavata as to the name
of the last king, Sulomadhi, would place him about A. D. 846; but his
premises are far from accurate, <span id="page_475">p. 475</span> and
his deduction in this instance at least is of no weight. Geneal. of the
Hindus, Introd. p. 16. He supposes the Andhra kings of Magadhá to have
retained their power on the Ganges until the Mohammedan invasion, or the
twelfth century, when they retired to the south, and reigned at Warankal
in Telingana. Inscriptions and coins, however, confirm the statement of
the Puráńas, that a different dynasty succeeded to the Andhras some
centuries before the Mohammedan conquests; and the Chinese also record,
that upon the death of the king of Magadhá, Ho-lo-mien (Puloman?), some
time before A. D. 648, great troubles in India took place. Des Guignes.
Some very curious and authentic testimony to the actual existence of
these Andhra kings has been lately afforded by the discovery of an
ancient inscription in Guzerat, in which Rudra Dámá, the Kshatrapa or
Satrap of Surasht́ra, is recorded to have repeatedly overcome Śátakarńi,
king of the southern country (Dakshińapatha). The inscription is without
date, but it is in an old character, and makes mention of the two Maurya
princes, Chandragupta and Aśoka, as if not very long prior to its
composition. Mr. J. Prinsep, to whom we are indebted for the decyphering
and translating of this important document, has been also successful in
decyphering the legends on a series of coins belonging to the princes of
Surásht́ra, amongst whom the name of Rudra Dámá occurs; and he is
inclined, although with hesitation, to place these princes about a
century after Anoka, or Rudra Dámá about 153 B. C. J. As. Soc. Bengal,
May 1837, and April 1838. According to the computation hazarded above
from our text, the race of Andhra kings should not commence till about
20 years B. C., which would agree with Pliny's notice of them; but it is
possible that they existed earlier in the south of India, although they
established their authority in Magadhá only in the first centuries of
the Christian era.

<span id="fn_1416"></span>[475:64](vp117.htm#fr_1416) These parallel
dynasties are thus particularized in our other authorities:

Ábhíras, 7, M.; 10, V; kings of Avabhriti, 7, Bhág.

Garddabhins, 10, M. V. Bhág.

Śakas, 18, M. V.; Kankas, 16, Bhág.

Yavanas, 8, M. V. Bhág.

Maunas, 18, V.; Húńas, 19, M.; Maulas, 11, Bhág.

Total--85 kings, Váyu; 89, Matsya; 76, and 1399 years, Bhág.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The other two
authorities give the years of each dynasty severally. The numbers are
apparently intended to be the same, but those of the Matsya are palpable
blunders, although almost all the MSS. agree in the reading. The
chronology of the Váyu is, Ábhíras, 67 years; Garddabhins, 72; Śakas,
380; Yavanas, 82; Tusháras, 500 (all the copies of the Matsya have
7000); Marúńd́as, 200; and Mlechchhas, intending perhaps Maunas, 300 yrs.
Total 1601 years, or less than 19 years to a reign. They are not however
continuous, but nearly cotemporary dynasties; and if they comprise, as
they probably do, the Greek and Scythian princes of the west of India,
the periods may not be very wide <span id="page_476">p. 476</span> of
the truth. The Matsya begins the list with one more dynasty, another
Andhra (see n. [39](#fn_1391)), of whom there were seven: 'When the
dominion of the Andhras has ceased, there shall be seven other Andhras,
kings of the race of their servants; and then nine Ábhíras.' The passage
of the Váyu, although somewhat similar in terms, has a different
purport: 'Of these, the Andhras having passed away, there shall be seven
cotemporary races; as, ten Ábhíras,' &c. The passage is differently read
in different copies, but this is the only intelligible reading. At the
same time it subsequently specifies a period for the duration of the
Andhra dynasty different from that before given, or three hundred years,
as if a different race was referred to: 'The Andhras shall possess the
earth two hundred years and one hundred.' The Matsya has twice five
hundred: 'The Śríparvatíya Andhras twice five hundred years.' One MS.
has more consistently fifty-two years. But there is evidently something
faulty in all the MSS. The expression of the Matsya, 'Śríparvatíya
Andhras,' is remarkable; Śríparvat being in Telingana. There is probably
some confusion of the two races, the Magadhá and Tailinga kings, in
these passages of the Puráńas. The Bhágavata has a dynasty of seven
Andhra kings, but of a different period (see n. [39](#fn_1391)). Col.
Wilford has attempted a verification of these dynasties; in some
instances perhaps with success, though certainly not in all. The Ábhíras
he calls the shepherd kings of the north of India: they were more
probably Greeks or Scythians or Parthians, along the lower Indus: traces
of the name occur, as formerly observed, in the Abiria of Ptolemy, and
the Áhírs as a distinct race still exist in Guzerat. Araish Mehfil. The
Śakas are the Sacæ, and the duration of their power is not unlikely to
be near the truth. The eight Yavana kings may be, as he supposes, Greek
princes of Bactria, or rather of western India. The Tusháras he makes
the Parthians. If the Bhágavata has the preferable reading, Tushkáras,
they were the Tochari, a Scythian race. The Murúńd́as, or, as he has it,
Maurúńd́as, he considers to be a tribe of Huns, the Morundæ of Ptolemy.
According to the Matsya they were of Mlechchha origin,
Mlechchha-sambhava. The Váyu calls them Arya-mlechchhas; quere,
Barbarians of Ariana. Wilford regards the Maunas as also a tribe of
Huns; and the word is in all the MSS. of the Matsya, Húńas; traces of
whom may be still found in the west and south of India. Inscription at
Merritch. Journ. R. As. vol. III. p. 103. The Garddabhins Wilford
conjectures to be descendants of Bahram Gor, king of Persia; but this is
very questionable. That they were a tribe in the west of India may be
conjectured, as some strange tales prevail there of a Gandharba, changed
to an ass, marrying the daughter of the king of Dhár. As. Res. VI. 35,
and IX. 147; also 'Cutch' by Mrs. Postans, p. 18: fables suggested no
doubt by the name Garddabha, signifying an ass. There is also <span
id="page_477">p. 477</span> evidently some affinity between these
Garddabhins and the old Gadhia Pysa, or ass-money, as vulgarly termed,
found in various parts of western India, and which is unquestionably of
ancient date. Journ. As. Soc. Bengal, Dec. 1835, p. 688. It may be the
coinage of the Garddabha princes; Garddabla, being the original of
Gadha, meaning also an ass. I have elsewhere conjectured the possibility
of their being current about a century and a half before our era. Journ.
R. As. Soc. vol. III. 385. Col. Tod, quoting a parallel passage in
Hindi, reads, instead of Garddhabhin, Gor-ind, which he explains the
Indras or lords of Gor; but the reading is undoubtedly erroneous.

<span id="fn_1417"></span>[477:65](vp117.htm#fr_1417) The copies agree
in reading Pauras, but the commentator remarks that it is sometimes
Maunas, but they have already been specified; unless the term be
repeated in order to separate the duration of this dynasty from that of
the rest. Such seems to be the purport of the similar passage of the
Bhágavata. These kings (Andhras, &c.) will possess the earth 1099 years,
and the eleven Maulas 300.' No such name as Pauras occurs in the other
authorities. The analogy of duration identifies them with the Mlechchhas
of the Váyu: 'Eleven Mlechchhas will possess the earth for three
centuries:' and the Váyu may refer to the Maunas, as no other period is
assigned for them. The periods of the Bhágavata, 1099 and 300, come much
to the same as that of our text, 1390; the one including the three
centuries of the Maunas, the other stating it separately. The Váyu
apparently adds it to the rest, thus making the total 1601, instead of
1390. It is evident that the same scheme is intended by the several
authorities, although some inaccuracy affects either the original
statement or the existing manuscripts.

<span id="fn_1418"></span>[477:66](vp117.htm#fr_1418) Kilakila,
Kolakila, Kolikila, Kilinakila, as it is variously read. Sir Wm. Jones's
Pandit stated that he understood it to be a city in the Mahratta country
(As. Res. XI. 142); and there has been found a confirmation of his
belief in an inscription, where Kilagila, as it is there termed, is
called the capital of Márasinha Deva, king of the Konkan. Journ. R. As.
Soc. vol. IV. p. 282. This inscription dates A. D. 1058. The Puráńas
refer probably to a long antecedent date, when the Greek princes, or
their Indo-Scythic successors, following the course of the Indus, spread
to the upper part of the western coast of the peninsula. The text calls
them Yavanas; and the Váyu and Matsya say they were Yavanas in
institutions, manners, and policy. The Bhágavata names five of their
princes, Bhutánanda, <span id="page_478">p. 478</span> Bangiri,
Śiśunandi, Yaśnandi, and Pravíra, who will reign 106 years, and they are
therefore imperfect representatives of the series in our text. The
Matsya has no farther specific enumeration of any dynasty. The Váyu
makes Pravíra the son of Vindhyaśakti; the latter reigning 96 years, and
the former 60: the latter is king of Kánchana puri, 'the golden city,'
and is followed by four sons, whose names are not mentioned. Between
Vindhyaśakti and Pravíra, however, a dynasty of kings is introduced,
some of the names of which resemble those of the Kilakila princes of the
text. They are, Bhogin the son of Seshanága, Sadáchandra, Nakhavat,
Dhanadhamita, Vinśaja, Bhutinanda--at a period before the end of the
Śungas? (the copies have \#\#\#)--Madhunandi, his younger brother
Nandiyaśas; and in his race there will be three other Rájás, Dauhitra,
Śiśuka, and Ripukáyán. These are called princes of Vidiśa or Videśa; the
latter meaning perhaps 'foreign,' and constitute the Nága dynasty. Our
text calls Vindhyaśakti a Murddhábhishikta, a warrior of a mixed race,
sprung from a Brahman father and Kshatriya mother.

<span id="fn_1419"></span>[478:67](vp117.htm#fr_1419) The text of this
passage runs thus: \#\#\#. 'Their sons,' the commentator explains by
'thirteen sons of Vindhyaśakti and the rest.' The Bhágavata has a
different statement, identifying the sons of the Vindhya race with the
Báhlikas, and making them thirteen: 'The Báhlikas will be their thirteen
sons.' As the commentator; 'There will be severally thirteen sons,
called Báhlikas, of Bhútananda and the rest.' The following verse
'Pushpamitra, a king, and then Durmitra:' who or what they were does not
appear. The commentator says, Pushpamitra was another king, and Durmitra
was his son. Here is evidently careless and inaccurate compilation. The
Váyu, though not quite satisfactory, accords better with our text.
'Pravíra,' it says, will have four sons: when the Vindhya race is
extinct, there will be three Báhlíka kings, Supratíka, Nabhíra, who will
reign thirty years, and Śakyamánábhava (quere this name), king of the
Mahishas. The Pushpamitras will then be, and the Pat́umitras also, who
will be seven kings of Mekalá. Such is the generation.' The plural verb
with only two Báhlíka names indicates some omission, unless we correct
it to it 'they two will reign;' but the following name and title,
Śakyamánábhava, king of the Mahishas, seems to have little connexion
with the Báhlikas. If, in a subsequent part of the citation, the reading
'trayodaśa' be correct, it must then be thirteen Pat́umitras; but it will
be difficult to know what to do with Sapta, 'seven' If for Santati we
might read <span id="page_479">p. 479</span> Saptati, 'seventy,' the
sense might be, 'these thirteen kings ruled for seventy-seven years.'
However this may be, it seems most correct to separate the thirteen sons
or families of the Vindhya princes from the three Báhlikas, and them
from the Pushpamitras and Pat́umitras, who governed Mekalá, a country on
the Narbada (see [p. 186](vp061.htm#page_186). n.
[18](vp061.htm#fn_494)). What the Báhlikas, or princes of Balkh, had to
do in this part of India is doubtful. The Durmitra of the Bhágavata has
been conjectured by Col. Tod (Trans. R. As. Soc. I. 325) to be intended
for the Bactrian prince Demetrius: but it is not clear that even the
Bhágavata considers this prince as one of the Báhlikas, and the name
occurs nowhere else.

<span id="fn_1420"></span>[479:68](vp117.htm#fr_1420) For the situation
of Kośalá, see [p. 190](vp061.htm#page_190). n. [79](vp061.htm#fn_555).
The three copies of the Váyu read Komalá, and call the kings, the
Meghas, more strong than sapient. The Bhágavata agrees with our text.
The Váyu says of the Naishadhas, or kings of Nishadha, that they were
all of the race of Nala. The Bhágavata adds two other races, seven
Andhras (see note [63](#fn_1415)) and kings of Vaidúra, with the remark
that these were all cotemporaries, being, as the commentator observes,
petty or provincial rulers.

<span id="fn_1421"></span>[479:69](vp117.htm#fr_1421) The Váyu has
Viśwaspháńi and Viśwasphińi; the Bhágavata, Viśwasphúrtti, or in some
MSS. Viśwaphúiji. The castes he establishes or places in authority, to
the exclusion of the Kshatriyas, are called in all the copies of our
text Kaivarttas, Pat́us, Pulindas, and Brahmans. The Váyu (three MSS.)
has Kaivarttas, Panchakas, Pulindas, and Brahmans. The Bhágavata has,
Pulindas, Yadus, and Mádrakas. The Váyu describes Viśwaspháńi as a great
warrior, and apparently as a eunuch: He worshipped the gods and manes,
and dying on the banks of the Ganges went to the heaven of Indra.

<span id="fn_1422"></span>[479:70](vp117.htm#fr_1422) Such appears to be
the purport of our text. The nine Nágas might be thought to mean the
same as the descendants of Śesha Nága, but the Váyu has another series
here, analogous to that of the text: 'The nine Náka kings will possess
the city Champávatí, and the seven Nágas (?) the pleasant city Mathura.
Princes of the Gupta race will possess all these countries, the banks of
the Ganges to Prayága and Sáketa and Magadhá.' <span id="page_480">p.
480</span> This account is the most explicit, and probably most
accurate, of all. The Nákas were Rájás of Bhágalpur; the Nágas, of
Mathura; and the intermediate countries along the Ganges were governed
by the Guptas, or Rájás of the Vaiśya caste. The Bhágavata seems to have
taken great liberties with the account, as it makes Viśwasphúrtti king
over Anugangá, the course of the Ganges from Haridwar, according to the
commentator, to Prayága, residing at Padmávatí: omitting the Nágas
altogether, and converting 'gupta' into an epithet of 'medini,' the
preserved or protected earth. Wilford considers the Nágas, Nákas, and
Guptas to be all the same: he says, 'Then came a dynasty of nine kings,
called the nine Nágas or Nágas; these were an obscure tribe, called for
that reason Guptavanśas, who ruled in Padmávati.' That city he calls
Patna; but in the Málati and Mádhava, Padmávatí lies amongst the Vindhya
hills. Kántipuri he makes Cotwal, near Gwalior. The reading of the Váyu,
Champávati, however, obviates the necessity of all vague conjecture.
According to Wilford there is a powerful tribe still called Nákas
between the Jamuna and the Betwa. Of the existence and power of the
Guptas, however, we have recently had ample proofs from inscriptions and
coins, as in the Chandragupta and Samudragupta of the Allatabad column;
Journ. As. Soc. Bengal, March and June, 1834; and Kumáragupta,
Chandragupta, Samudragupta, Śaśigupta, &c. on the Archer coins, found at
Kanoj and elsewhere; As. Res. XVII. pl. 1. fig. 5, 7, 13, 19; and Journ.
As. Soc. Bengal, Nov. 1835, pl. 38 and 39; and in other numbers of the
same Journal: in all which, the character in which the legends are
written is of a period prior to the use of the modern Devanagari, and
was current in all probability about the fifth century of our era, as
conjectured by Mr. Prinsep: see his table of the modifications of the
Sanscrit alphabet from 543 B. C. to 1200 A. D. Journ. As. Soc. Bengal,
March 1838.

<span id="fn_1423"></span>[480:71](vp117.htm#fr_1423) The Váyu also
mentions the descendants of Devarakshita or Daivarakshitas as kings of
the Kośalas, Támralipta, and the sea coast; so far conforming with our
text as to include the western parts of Bengal, Tamlook, Medinipur, and
Orissa. One copy reads Andhra, perhaps for Od́ra, Orissa; and one has
Champá for the capital, which is probably an error, although the two
other MSS., being still more faulty, do not offer the means of
correction.

<span id="fn_1424"></span>[480:72](vp117.htm#fr_1424) The Váyu has the
same. The countries are parts of Orissa and Berar.

<span id="fn_1425"></span>[480:73](vp117.htm#fr_1425) The Váyu has sons
of Mańidhańya for the ruling dynasty, but names the countries those of
the Naishadhas, Yudakas, Śaśikas, and Kálatoyas. The first name applies
to a tract of country near <span id="page_481">p. 481</span> the Vindhya
mountains, but the last to a country in the north. The west or
southwest, however, is probably intended in this place.

<span id="fn_1426"></span>[481:74](vp117.htm#fr_1426) The Stri Rájya is
usually placed in Bhote. It may perhaps here designate Malabar, where
polyandry equally prevails. Múshika, or the country of thieves, was the
pirate coast of the Konkan. The Váyu reads Bhokshyaka or Bhokhyaka for
Múshika. The Bhágavata omits all these specifications subsequent to the
notice of Viwasphúrtti.

<span id="fn_1427"></span>[481:75](vp117.htm#fr_1427) From this we might
infer that the Vishńu P. was compiled when the Mohammedans were making
their first encroachments on the west. They seem to have invaded and to
have settled in Sindh early in the eighth century, although Indian
princes continued on the Indus for a subsequent period. Scriptor. Arab.
de rebus Indicis. Gildemeister, p. 6. They were engaged in hostilities
in 698 or 700 with the prince of Kabul, in whose name, however disguised
by its Mohammedan representations of Ratil, Ratbal, or Ratibal, it is
not difficult to recognise the genuine Hindu appellation of Ratanpál, or
Ratnapál. Their progress in this direction has not been traced; but at
the period of their invasion of Sindh they advanced to Multan, and
probably established themselves there and at Lahore within a century.
Kashmir they did not occupy till a much later date, and the Rája
Tarangini takes no notice of any attacks upon it; but the Chinese have
recorded an application from the king of Kashmir, Chin-tho-lo-pi-li,
evidently the Chandrápid́a of the Sanscrit, for aid against the Arabs,
about A. D. 713. Gildemeister, p. 13. Although, therefore, not actually
settled at the Panjab so early as the beginning, they had commenced
their incursions, and had no doubt made good their footing by the end of
the eighth or commencement of the ninth century. This age of the Puráńa
is compatible with reference to the cotemporary race of Gupta kings,
from the fourth or fifth to the seventh or eighth century; or, if we are
disposed to go farther back, we may apply the passage to the Greek and
Indo-Scythian princes. It seems more likely to be the former period; but
in all such passages in this or other Puráńas there is the risk that
verses inspired by the presence of Mohammedan rulers may have been
interpolated into the original text. Had the Mohammedans of Hindustan,
however, been intended by the latter, the indications would have been
more distinct, and the localities assigned to them more central. Even
the Bhágavata, the date of which we have good reason for conjecturing to
be the middle of the twelfth century, and which influenced the form
assumed about that time by the worship of Vishńu, cannot be thought to
refer to the Mohammedan conquerors of <span id="page_482">p. 482</span>
upper India. It is there stated, that rulers fallen from their castes,
or Śúdras, will be the princes of Saurásht́ra, Avanti, Abhíra, Śúra,
Arbuda, and Málava; and barbarians, Śúdras, and other outcastes, not
enlightened by the Vedas, will possess Káshmír, Kauntí, and the banks of
the Chandrabhágá and Indus.' Now it was not until the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries that the Mohammedans established themselves in
Guzerat and Malwa, and the Bhágavata was unquestionably well known in
various parts of India long before that time. (Account of Hindu Sects,
As. Res. vol. XVI.) It cannot therefore allude to Mohammedans. By
specifying the princes as seceders from the Vedas, there is no doubt
that the barbarians and outcastes intended are so only in a religious
sense; and we know from indisputable authorities that the western
countries, Guzerat, Abu, Málava, were the chief seats, first of the
Buddhists, and then of the Jainas, from a period commencing perhaps
before the Christian era, and scarcely terminating with the Mohammedan
conquest. Inscriptions from Abu, As. Res. vol. XVI.

<span id="fn_1428"></span>[482:76](vp117.htm#fr_1428) The commentator,
having no doubt the existing state of things in view, interprets the
passage somewhat differently: the original is, \#\#\#. The comment
explains 'strong', and adds, the Mlechchhas will be in the centre, and
the Áryyas at the end:' meaning, if any thing, that the unbelievers are
in the heart of the country, and the Hindus on the borders: a
description, however, never correct, except as applicable to the
governments; and in that case inconsistent with the text, which had
previously represented the bordering countries in the hands of outcastes
and heretics. All that the text intends, is to represent infidels and
foreigners high in power, and the Brahmans depressed. It is not unlikely
that the reading is erroneous, notwithstanding the copies concur, and
that the passage should be here the same as that of the Váyu;
'Intermixed with them, the nations, adopting every where barbaric <span
id="page_483">p. 483</span> institutions, exist in a state of disorder,
and the subjects shall be destroyed.' The expression Mlechchhácháráścha
being used instead of Mlechchhaścháryáścha. A passage similar to that of
the text, noticing the intermixture of Hindus and barbarians, occurs in
a different place (see [p. 175](vp060.htm#page_175). n.
[4](vp060.htm#fn_392)), and designates tare condition of India in all
ages: at no period has the whole of the population followed Brahmanical
Hinduism.

<span id="fn_1429"></span>[483:77](vp117.htm#fr_1429) That is, there
will be no Tírthas, places held sacred, and objects of pilgrimage; no
particular spot of earth will have any especial sanctity.

<span id="fn_1430"></span>[483:78](vp117.htm#fr_1430) Gifts will be made
from the impulse of ordinary feeling, not in connexion with religious
rites, and as an act of devotion; and ablution will be performed for
pleasure or comfort, not religiously with prescribed ceremonies and
prayers.

<span id="fn_1431"></span>[483:79](vp117.htm#fr_1431) The expression
Sadveśadhárin is explained to mean either one who wears fine clothes, or
who assumes the exterior garb of sanctity. Either interpretation is
equally allowable.

<span id="fn_1432"></span>[484:80](vp117.htm#fr_1432) The Bhágavata
agrees with the text in these particulars. The chief star of Tishya is δ
in the constellation Cancer.

<span id="fn_1433"></span>[484:81](vp117.htm#fr_1433) All the copies
concur in this reading. Three copies of the Váyu assign to the same
interval 1050 years: and of the Matsya five copies have the same, or
1050 years; whilst one copy has 1500 years. The Bhágavata has 1115
years; which the commentator explains, 'a thousand years and a hundred
with fifteen over.' He notices nevertheless, although he does not
attempt to account for the discrepancy, that the total period from
Paríkshit to Nanda was actually, according to the duration of the
different intermediate dynasties, as enumerated by all the authorities,
fifteen centuries; viz.

<div align="center">

|               |            |      |
|---------------|------------|------|
| Magadhá kings | 1000       | yrs. |
| Pradyota, &c. | 138        |      |
| Śiśunága, &c. | <u>362</u> |      |
|               | 1500       |      |

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The shorter period
is best proportioned to the number of kings; for reckoning from
Sahadeva, who was cotemporary with Paríkshit, and taking the number of
the Várhadrathas from the Matsya, we have thirty-two of them, five of
the Pradyota race, and ten Śaiśunágas, or in all forty-seven; which, as
the divisor of 1050, gives rather more than twenty-two years to a reign.
The Váyu and the Matsya further specify the interval from Nanda to
Pulomat, the last of the Ándhra kings, as being 836 years; a total that
does not<span id="page_485">p. 485</span> agree exactly with the items
previously specified:

<div align="center">

|           |         |            |      |
|-----------|---------|------------|------|
| 9         | Nandas  | 100        | yrs. |
| 10        | Mauryas | 137        |      |
| 10        | Śungas  | 112        |      |
| 4         | Kańwas  | 45         |      |
| <u>29</u> | Andhras | <u>460</u> |      |
| 62        |         | 854        |      |

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In either case the
average duration of reign is not improbable, as the highest number gives
less than fourteen years to each prince. It is important to remember
that the reign of Paríkshit is, according to Hindu chronology, coeval
with the commencement of the Kali age; and even therefore taking the
longest Pauráńik interval we have but sixteen centuries between
Chandragupta--or considering him as the same with Sandrocoptos, nineteen
centuries B. C.--for the beginning of the Kali age. According to the
chronology of our text, however, it would be but B. C. 1415; to that of
the Váyu and Matsya, B. C. 1450; and to that of the Bhágavata, 1515.
According to Col. Wilford's computations (As. Res. vol. IX. Chron.
Table, p. 116) the conclusion of the great war took place B. C. 1370:
Buchanan conjectures it to have occurred in the thirteenth century B. C.
Vyása was the putative father of Páńd́u and Dhritarásht́ra, and
consequently was cotemporary with the heroes of the great war. Mr.
Colebrooke infers from astronomical data that the arrangement of the
Vedas attributed to Vyása took place in the fourteenth century B.C. Mr.
Bentley brings the date of Yudhisht́hira, the chief of the Páńd́avas, to
575 B. C. (Historical View of Hindu Astronomy, p. 67); but the weight of
authority is in favour of the thirteenth or fourteenth century B. C. for
the war of the Mahábhárata, and the reputed commencement of the Kali
age.

<span id="fn_1434"></span>[485:82](vp117.htm#fr_1434) A similar
explanation is given in the Bhágavata, Váyu, and Matsya Puráńas; and
like accounts from astronomical writers are cited by Mr. Colebrooke, As.
Res. vol. IX. p. 358. The commentator on the Bhágavata thus explains the
notion: "The two stars (Pulaha and Kratu) must rise or be visible before
the rest, and whichever asterism is in a line south from the middle of
those stars, is that with which the seven stars are united; and so they
continue for one hundred years." Col. Wilford has also given a like
explanation of the revolution of the Rishis; As. Res. vol. IX. p. 83.
According to Bentley the notion originated in a contrivance of the
astronomers to shew the quantity of the precession of the equinoxes.
"This was by assuming an imaginary line or great circle passing through
the poles of the ecliptic and the beginning of the fixed Maghá, which
circle was supposed to cut some of the stars in the Great Bear. The
seven stars in the Great Bear the circle so assumed was called the line
of the Rishis, and being fixed to the beginning of the lunar asterism
Maghá, the precession would be solved by stating the degree &c. of any
moveable lunar mansion cut by that fixed line or circle as an <span
id="page_486">p. 486</span> index. Historical View of Hindu Astronomy,
p. 65.

<span id="fn_1435"></span>[486:83](vp117.htm#fr_1435) The Bhágavata has
the same; and this agrees with the period assigned for the interval
between Paríkshit and Nanda of 1050 years; as, including Maghá, we have
ten asterisms to Purváshád́há, or 1000 years. The Váyu and Matsya are so
very inaccurate in all the copies consulted, that it is not safe to
affirm what they mean to describe. Apparently they state that at the end
of the Andhra dynasty the Rishis will be in Krittiká, which furnishes
other ten asterisms; the whole being nearly in accordance with the
chronology of the text, as the total interval from Paríkshit to the last
of the Andhras is 1050 + 836 =1886, and the entire century of each
asterism at the beginning and end of the series need not be taken into
account. The copies of the Matsya read, 'The seven Rishis are on a line
with the brilliant Agni;' that is, with Krittiká, of which Agni is the
presiding deity. The Váyu intends in all probability the same phrase,
but the three copies have, \#\#\# a very unintelligible clause. Again,
it seems as if they intended to designate the end of the Andhra race as
the period of a complete revolution, or 2700 years; for the Váyu has,
'The races at the end of the Andhas will be after 2700 years:' the
Matsya has, \#\#\# and at the close of the passage, after specifying as
usual that 'the seven Rishis were in Maghá in the time of Paríkshit,'
the Váyu adds, \#\#\# a passage which, though repeated in the MSS., is
obviously most inaccurate; although it might perhaps be understood to
intimate that the Rishis will be in the twenty-fourth asterism after the
Andhra race; but that would give only 1400 years from Paríkshit to
Pulomat; whilst if the twenty-fourth from Maghá was intended, it would
give 2400 years: both periods being incompatible with previous
specifications. The Matsya has a different reading of the second line,
but one not much more satisfactory; 'A hundred years of Brahmá will be
in the twenty-fourth (asterism?).' In neither of these authorities,
however, is it proposed by the last-cited passages to illustrate the
chronology of princes or dynasties: the specification <span
id="page_487">p. 487</span> of the period, whatever it may be, is that
of the era at which the evil influence of the Kali age is to become most
active and irresistible.

<span id="fn_1436"></span>[487:84](vp117.htm#fr_1436) The Bhágavata has
the same. Devápi, as the commentator observes, being the restorer of the
lunar, and Maru of the solar race.

<span id="fn_1437"></span>[489:85](vp117.htm#fr_1437) To be the cause of
Sankalpa, 'conviction,' 'belief;' and Vikalpa, 'doubt,' 'disbelief.' The
Bhágavata indulges in a similar strain, and often in the same words. The
whole recalls the words of the Roman satirist;

. . . I, demens, et sævas curre per Alpes,  
Ut pueris placeas, et declamatio fias.
