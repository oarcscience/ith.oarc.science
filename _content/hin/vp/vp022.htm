<p>18. Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. "That which has declared, in twelve thousand two hundred verses, the magnificence of the egg of Brahm&aacute;, and in which an account of the future Kalpas is contained, is called the Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, and was revealed by Brahm&aacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">80</FONT></A>."</p>  
<p>The Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is usually considered to be in much the same predicament as the Skanda, no longer procurable in a collective body, but represented by a variety of Khan&#769;d&#769;as and M&aacute;h&aacute;tmyas, professing to be derived from it. The facility with which any tract may be thus attached to the non-existent original, and the advantage that has been taken of its absence to compile a variety of unauthentic fragments, have given to the Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a, Skanda, and Padma, according to Col. Wilford, the character of being the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as of thieves or impostors&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A>. This is not applicable to the Padma, which, as above shewn, occurs entire and the same in various parts of India. The imposition of which the other two are made the vehicles can deceive no one, as the purpose of the particular legend is always too obvious to leave any doubt of its origin.</p>  
<p>Copies of what profess to be the entire Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a are sometimes, though rarely, procurable. I met with one in two portions, the former containing, one hundred and twenty-four chapters, the latter seventy-eight; and the whole containing about the number of stanzas assigned to the Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. The first and largest portion, however, proved to be the same as the V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, with a passage occasionally slightly varied, and at the end of each chapter the common phrase 'Iti Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a Pur&aacute;n&#769;e' substituted for 'Iti V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;e.' I do not think there was any intended fraud in the substitution. The last section of the first part of the V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is termed the Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a section, giving an</p>

<p>account of the dissolution of the universe; and a careless or ignorant transcriber might have taken this for the title of the whole. The checks to the identity of the work have been honestly preserved, both in the index and the frequent specification of V&aacute;yu as the teacher or narrator of it.</p>  
<p>The second portion of this Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a is not any part of the V&aacute;yu; it is probably current in the Dakhin as a Sanhit&aacute; or Khan&#769;d&#769;a. Agastya is represented as going to the city K&aacute;nch&iacute; (Conjeveram), where Vishn&#769;u, as Hayagr&iacute;va, appears to him, and, in answer to his inquiries, imparts to him the means of salvation, the worship of Para&#347;akt&iacute;. In illustration of the efficacy of this form of adoration, the main subject of the work is an account of the exploits of Lalit&aacute; Dev&iacute;, a form of Durg&aacute;, and her destruction of the demon Bh&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;&aacute;sura. Rules for her worship are also given, which are decidedly of a &#346;&aacute;kta or T&aacute;ntrika description; and this work cannot be admitted, therefore, to be part of a genuine Pur&aacute;n&#769;a.</p>
