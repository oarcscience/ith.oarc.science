<p>Diti, having lost her children, propitiated Ka&#347;yapa; and the best of ascetics, being pleased with her, promised her a boon; on which she prayed for a son of irresistible prowess and valour, who should destroy Indra. The excellent Muni granted his wife the great gift she had solicited, but with one condition: "You shall bear a son," he said, "who shall slay Indra, if with thoughts wholly pious, and person entirely pure, you carefully carry the babe in your womb for a hundred years." Having thus said, Ka&#347;yapa departed; and the dame conceived, and during gestation assiduously observed the rules of mental and personal purity. When the king of the immortals, learnt that Diti bore a son destined for his destruction, he came to her, and attended upon her with the utmost humility, watching for an opportunity to disappoint her intention. At last, in the last year of the century, the opportunity occurred. Diti</p>

<p>retired one night to rest without performing the prescribed ablution of her feet, and fell asleep; on which the thunderer divided with his thunderbolt the embryo in her womb into seven portions. The child, thus mutilated, cried bitterly; and Indra repeatedly attempted to console and silence it, but in vain: on which the god, being incensed, again divided each of the seven portions into seven, and thus formed the swift-moving deities called M&aacute;rutas (winds). They derived this appellation from the words with which Indra had addressed them (M&aacute; rod&iacute;h, 'Weep not'); and they became forty-nine subordinate divinities, the associates of the wielder of the thunderbolt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_329"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_329">147:1</A> The Padma P. makes these the sons of Prahl&aacute;da. The Bh&aacute;gavata says there were five sons, but does not give the names. It also inserts the sons of Hl&aacute;da, making them the celebrated demons Ilwala and V&aacute;t&aacute;pi. The V&aacute;yu refers to Hl&aacute;da, other Daityas, famous in Paur&aacute;n&#769;ic legend, making his son, Nisunda; and his sons, Sunda and Upasunda; the former the father of Mar&iacute;cha and T&aacute;rak&aacute;; the latter, of M&uacute;ka.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_330"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_330">147:2</A> The Padma P. and V&aacute;yu name several of these, but they are not of any note: the latter gives the names of two daughters, who are more celebrated, P&uacute;tan&aacute; and &#346;akuni.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_331"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_331">147:3</A> The descendants of Hiran&#769;y&aacute;ksha are said, in the Padma P., to have extended to seventy-seven crores, or seven hundred and seventy millions. Some copies, for T&aacute;raka, read K&aacute;lan&aacute;bha.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_332"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_332">147:4</A> The Padma and V&aacute;yu P. furnish a much longer list of names, but those of most note are the same as in the text, with which also the Bh&aacute;gavata for the most part agrees.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_333"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_333">147:5</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata makes Prabh&aacute; the wife of Namuchi: according to the V&aacute;yu, she is the mother of Nahusha.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_334"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_334">147:6</A> Married to Yay&aacute;ti, as will be related.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_335"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_335">147:7</A> The text might be understood to imply that the latter two were the daughters of Vaisw&aacute;nara; and the Bh&aacute;gavata has, "The four lovely daughters of Vaisw&aacute;nara were Upad&aacute;nav&iacute;, Haya&#347;iras, Pulom&aacute;, and K&aacute;lak&aacute;." The Padma substitutes Vajr&aacute; and Sundar&iacute; for the two former names. The V&aacute;yu specifies only Pulom&aacute; and K&aacute;lik&aacute; as the daughters of Vaisw&aacute;nara, as does our text. Upad&aacute;nav&iacute;, according to the Bh&aacute;gavata, is the wife of Hiran&#769;y&aacute;ksha; and Haya&#347;iras, of Kratu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_336"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_336">148:8</A> Though not specified by the text as one of the D&aacute;navas, he is included in the catalogue of the V&aacute;yu, and the commentator on the Bh&aacute;gavata calls him a son of Danu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_337"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_337">148:9</A> The word is also read K&uacute;lakas and K&aacute;lakeyas: the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, I. 643, has K&aacute;lakanjas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_338"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_338">148:10</A> The text omits the two most celebrated of the Sainhikeyas, or sons of Sinhik&aacute;, R&aacute;hu (see <A HREF="vp044.htm#page_78">p. 78</A>. note <A HREF="vp044.htm#fn_236">8</A>) and Ketu, who are specified both in the Bh&aacute;gavata and the V&aacute;yu; the former as the eldest son. Of the other sons it is said by the V&aacute;yu that they were all killed by Para&#347;ur&aacute;ma.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_339"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_339">148:11</A> Two names of note, found in the V&aacute;yu, are omitted by the Vishn&#769;u; that of Puloman, the father of &#346;ach&iacute;, the wife of Indra, and mother of Jayanta; and Maya, the father of Vajrak&aacute;m&aacute; and Mahodar&iacute;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_340"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_340">148:12</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata says the Paulomas were killed by Arjuna, who therefore, the commentator observes, were the same as the Niv&aacute;ta Kavachas: but the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata describes the destruction of the Niv&aacute;ta Kavachas and of the Paulomas and K&aacute;lakeyas as the successive exploits of Arjuna. Vana P. 8. I. 633. The story is narrated in detail only in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, which is consequently prior to all the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as in which the allusion occurs. According to that work, the Niv&aacute;ta Kavachas were D&aacute;navas, to the number of thirty millions, residing in the depths of the sea; and the Paulomas and K&aacute;lakanjas were the children of two Daitya dames, Pulom&aacute; and K&aacute;lak&aacute;, inhabiting Hiranyapura, the golden city, floating in the air.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_341"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_341">148:13</A> All the copies read ### which should be, '&#346;&uacute;k&iacute; bore parrots; and Ul&uacute;k&iacute;, the several sorts of owls? but Ul&uacute;k&iacute; is nowhere named as one of the daughters of T&aacute;mr&aacute;; and the reading may be, 'Owls <a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></A> and birds opposed to owls, i. e. crows. The authorities generally concur with our text; but the V&aacute;yu has a somewhat different account; or, &#346;uk&iacute;, married to Garud&#769;a, the mother of parrots: &#346;yen&iacute;, married to Arun&#769;a, mother of Samp&aacute;ti and Jat&#769;&aacute;yu: Bh&aacute;s&iacute;, the mother of jays, owls, crows, peacocks, pigeons, and fowls: Kraunchi, the parent of curlews, herons, cranes: and Dhritar&aacute;shtr&iacute;, the mother of geese, ducks, teal, and other water-fowl. The three last are also called the wives of Garud&#769;a.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_342"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_342">149:14</A> Most of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as agree in this account; but the Bh&aacute;gavata makes Vinat&aacute; the wife of T&aacute;rksha, and in this place substitutes Saram&aacute;, the mother of wild animals. The V&aacute;yu adds the metres of the Vedas as the daughters of Vinat&aacute;; and the Padma gives her one daughter Saud&aacute;min&iacute;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_343"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_343">149:15</A> The dragons of modern fable. An&aacute;yush or Dan&aacute;yush is substituted for Suras&aacute; in the V&aacute;yu, and in one of the accounts of the Padma. The Bh&aacute;gavata says R&aacute;kshasas were her offspring. The Matsya has both Suras&aacute; and An&aacute;yush, making the former the parent of all quadrupeds, except cows; the latter, the mother of diseases.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_344"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_344">149:16</A> The V&aacute;yu names forty: the most noted amongst whom, in addition to those of the text, are Air&aacute;vata, Dhritar&aacute;sht&#769;ra, Mah&aacute;nila, Bal&aacute;haka, Anjana, Pushpadansht&#769;ra, Durmukha, K&aacute;l&iacute;ya, Pun&#769;d&#769;ar&iacute;ka, Kapila, N&aacute;husha, and Man&#769;i.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_345"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_345">149:17</A> By Dansht&#769;rin&#769;a some understand, serpents, some R&aacute;kshasas; but by the context carnivorous animals, birds, and fishes seem intended. The V&aacute;yu makes Krodhava&#347;&aacute; the mother of twelve daughters, Mrig&iacute; and others, from whom all wild animals, deer, elephants, monkeys, tigers, lions, dogs, also fishes, reptiles, and Bh&uacute;tas and Pi&#347;&aacute;chas, or goblins, sprang.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_346"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_346">150:18</A> One copy only inserts a half stanza here; "Krodh&aacute; was the mother of the Pi&#347;&aacute;chas;" which is an interpolation apparently from the Matsya or Hari Van&#347;a. The Padma P., second legend, makes Krodh&aacute; the mother of the Bh&uacute;tas; and Pi&#347;&aacute;ch&aacute;, of the Pi&#347;&aacute;ch&aacute;s.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_347"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_347">150:19</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata says, of animals with cloven hoofs. The V&aacute;yu has, of the eleven Rudras, of the bull of &#346;iva, and of two daughters, Rohin&#769;&iacute; and Gandharb&iacute;; from the former of whom descended horned cattle; and from the latter, horses.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_348"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_348">150:20</A> According to the V&aacute;yu, Khas&aacute; had two sons, Yaksha and R&aacute;kshas, severally the progenitors of those beings.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_349"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_349">150:21</A> The Padma, second series, makes V&aacute;ch the mother of both Apsarasas and Gandharbas: the V&aacute;yu has long lists of the names of both classes, as well as of Vidy&aacute;dharas and Kinnaras. The Apsarasas are distinguished as of two kinds, Laukika, 'worldly,' of whom thirty-four are specified; and Daivika, or 'divine,' ten in number: the latter furnish the individuals most frequently engaged in the interruption of the penances of holy sages, such as Menak&aacute;, Sahajany&aacute;, Ghrit&aacute;ch&iacute;, Pramloch&aacute;, Visw&aacute;chi, and P&uacute;rvachitti. Urva&#347;&iacute; is of a different order to both, being the daughter of N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a. Rambh&aacute;, Tilotam&aacute; Misrake&#347;&iacute;, are included amongst the Laukika nymphs. There are also fourteen Gan&#769;as, or troops, of Apsarasas, bearing peculiar designations, as &Aacute;h&uacute;tas, Sobhayant&iacute;s, Vegavat&iacute;s, &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_350"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_350">150:22</A> The K&uacute;rma, Matsya, Br&aacute;hma, Linga, Agni, Padma, and V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;as agree generally with our text in the description of Ka&#347;yapa's wives and progeny. The V&aacute;yu enters most into details, and contains very long catalogues of the names of the different characters descended from the sage. The Padma and Matsya and the Hari Van&#347;a repeat the story, but admit several variations, some of which have been adverted to in the preceding notes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_351"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_351">150:23</A> We have a considerable variation here in the commentary, and it may be doubted if the allusion in the text is accurately explained by either of the versions. In one it is said that 'Brahm&aacute;, the grandsire of <a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></A> the Gandharbas, &amp;c., appointed the seven Rishis, who were born in a former Manwantara, to be his sons, or to be the intermediate agents in creation: he created no other beings himself, being engrossed by the sacrificial ceremony.' Instead of "putratwe," 'in the state of sons,' the reading is sometimes "pitratwe," 'in the character of fathers;' that is, to all other beings. Thus the gods and the rest, who in a former Manwantara originated from Ka&#347;yapa, were created in the present period as the offspring of the seven Rishis. The other explanation agrees with the preceding in ascribing the birth of all creatures to the intermediate agency of the seven Rishis, but calls them the actual sons of Brahm&aacute;, begotten at the sacrifice of Vanilla, in the sacrificial fire. The authority for the story is not given, beyond its being in other Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, it has the air of a modern mystification. The latter member of the passage is separated altogether from the foregoing, and carried on to what follows: thus; "In the war of the Gandharbas, serpents, gods, and demons, Diti having lost her children," &amp;c.; the word 'virodha' being understood, it is said, This is defended by the authority of the Hari Van&#347;a, where the passage occurs word for word, except in the last half stanza, which, instead of ### occurs ###. The parallel passages are thus rendered by M. Langlois: 'Le Mouni Swarotchicha avoit cess&eacute; de r&eacute;gner quand cette cr&eacute;ation eut lieu: c&#8217;&eacute;tait sous l&#8217;empire du Menou Vevaswata le sacrifice de Varouna avait commenc&eacute;. La premi&egrave;re cr&eacute;ation fut celle de Brahm&aacute;, quand il jugea qu&#8217;il &eacute;tait temps de proc&eacute;der &agrave; son sacrifice, et que, souverain a&iuml;eul du monde, il forma lui-m&ecirc;me dans sa pens&eacute;e et enfanta les sept Brahmarchis.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_352"></A><A HREF="vp056.htm#fr_352">152:24</A> This legend occurs in all those Pur&aacute;n&#769;as in which the account of Ka&#347;yapa's family is related.</P>
