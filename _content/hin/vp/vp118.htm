<p>have requested; the birth of a part of a part of Vishn&#769;u, and the benefits which his actions conferred upon the world.</p>  
<p>Vasudeva formerly married the daughter of Devaka, the illustrious Devak&iacute;, a maiden of celestial beauty. After their nuptials, Kansa, the increaser of the race of Bhoja, drove their car as their charioteer. As they were going along, a voice in the sky, sounding aloud and deep as thunder, addressed Kansa, and said, "Fool that you are, the eighth child of the damsel whom you are driving in the car shall take away your life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1441"></A><A HREF="#fn_1441"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>!" On hearing this, Kansa drew his sword, and was about to put Devak&iacute; to death; but Vasudeva interposed, saying, "Kill not Devak&iacute;, great warrior; spare her life, and I will deliver to you every child that she may bring forth." Appeased by which promise, and relying on the character of Vasudeva, Kansa desisted from the attempt.</p>  
<p>At that time, Earth, overburdened by her load, repaired to mount Meru to an assembly of the gods, and addressing the divinities, with Brahm&aacute; at their head, related in piteous accents all her distress. "Agni," said Earth, "is the progenitor of gold; S&uacute;rya, of rays of light&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1442"></A><A HREF="#fn_1442"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>: the parent and guide of me and of all spheres is the supreme N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a, who is Brahm&aacute;, the lord of the lord of patriarchs; the eldest of the eldest born; one with minutes and hours; one with time; having form, though indiscrete. This assemblage of yourselves, O gods, is but a part of him. The sun, the winds, the saints, the Rudras, the Vasus, the Aswins, fire, the patriarch creators of the universe, of whom Atri is the first, all are but forms of the mighty and inscrutable Vishn&#769;u. The Yakshas, R&aacute;kshasas, Daityas, spirits of evil, serpents, and children of Danu, the singers and nymphs of heaven, are forms of the great spirit, Vishn&#769;u. The heavens painted with planets, constellations, and stars; fire, water, wind, and myself, and every perceptible thing; the whole universe itself--consists of Vishn&#769;u. The multifarious forms of that manifold being encounter</p>

<p align="justify'">and succeed one another, night and day, like the waves of the sea. At this present season many demons, of whom K&aacute;lanemi is the chief, have overrun, and continually harrass, the region of mortals. The great Asura K&aacute;lanemi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1443"></A><A HREF="#fn_1443"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, that was killed by the powerful Vishn&#769;u, has revived in Kansa, the son of Ugrasena, and many other mighty demons, more than I can enumerate, as Arisht&#769;a, Dhenuka, Ke&#347;in, Pralamba, Naraka, Sunda, and the fierce B&aacute;n&#769;a, the son of Bali&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1444"></A><A HREF="#fn_1444"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, are born in the palaces of kings. Countless hosts of proud and powerful spirits, chiefs of the demon race, assuming celestial forms, now walk the earth; and, unable to support myself beneath the incumbent load, I come to you for succour. Illustrious deities, do you so act that I may be relieved from my burden, lest helpless I sink into the nethermost abyss."</p>  
<p>When the gods had heard these complaints of Earth, Brahm&aacute; at their request explained to them how her burden might be lightened. "Celestials," said Brahm&aacute;, "all that Earth has said is undoubtedly true. I, Mah&aacute;deva, and you all, are but N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a; but the impersonations of his power are for ever mutually fluctuating, and excess or diminution is indicated by the predominance of the strong, and the depression of the weak. Come therefore, let us repair to the northern coast of the milky sea, and having glorified Hari, report to him what we have heard. He, who is the spirit of all, and of whom the universe consists, constantly, for the sake of Earth, descends in a small portion of his essence to establish righteousness below." Accordingly Brahm&aacute;, attended by the gods, went to the milky sea, and there, with minds intent upon him, praised him whose emblem is Garud&#769;a.</p>  
<p>"O thou," said Brahm&aacute;, "who art distinct from holy writ&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1445"></A><A HREF="#fn_1445"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>; whose double nature is twofold wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1446"></A><A HREF="#fn_1446"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>, superior and inferior, and who art the</p>

Thou art one supreme; thou art that supreme and eternal state which the wise behold with the eye of knowledge. There is nothing else but thou, O lord; nothing else has been or will be. Thou art both discrete and indiscrete, universal and individual, omniscient, all-seeing, omnipotent, possessed of all wisdom and strength and power.

<p>The unborn, universal Hari, having heard with his mental ear these eulogiums, was pleased, and thus spake to Brahm&aacute;: "Tell me, Brahm&aacute;, what you and the gods desire: speak boldly, certain of success." Brahm&aacute;, beholding the divine, universal form of Hari, quickly prostrated himself, and again renewed his praises. "Glory to thee, the thousand-formed, the thousand-armed, the many-visaged, many-footed; to thee, the illimitable author of creation, preservation, and destruction; most subtile of the subtile, most vast of the great: to thee, who art nature, intellect, and consciousness; and who art other spirit even than the spiritual root of those principles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1459"></A><A HREF="#fn_1459"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>. Do thou shew favour upon us. Behold, lord, this earth, oppressed by mighty Asuras, and shaken to her mountain basements, comes to thee, who art her invincible defender, to be relieved from her burden. Behold me, Indra, the Aswins, Varun&#769;a, and Yama, the Rudras, the Vasus, the suns, the winds, fire, and all other celestials, prepared to execute whatever thou shalt will that we shall do. Do thou, in whom there is no imperfection, O sovereign of the deities, give thy orders to thy servants: lo, we are ready."</p>  
<p>When Brahm&aacute; had ended, the supreme lord plucked off two hairs, one white and one black, and said to the gods, "These my hairs shall descend upon earth, and shall relieve her of the burden of her distress&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1460"></A><A HREF="#fn_1460"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A>.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Let all the gods also, in their own portions, go down to earth, and wage war with the haughty Asuras, who are there incorporate, and who shall every one of them be destroyed. Doubt not of this: they shall perish before the withering glance of mine eyes. This my (black) hair shall be impersonated in the eighth conception of the wife of Vasudeva, Devak&iacute;, who is like a goddess; and shall slay Kansa, who is the demon K&aacute;lanemi." Thus having spoken, Hari disappeared; and the gods bowing to him, though invisible, returned to the summit of mount Meru, from whence they descended upon earth.</p>  
<p>The Muni N&aacute;rada informed Kansa that the supporter of the earth, Vishn&#769;u, would be the eighth child of Devak&iacute;; and his wrath being excited by this report, he placed both Vasudeva and Devak&iacute; in confinement. Agreeably to his promise, the former delivered to Kansa each infant as soon as it was born. It is said that these, to the number of six, were the children of the demon Hiran&#769;yaka&#347;ipu, who were introduced into the womb of Devak&iacute;, at the command of Vishn&#769;u, during the hours of Devak&iacute;'s repose, by the goddess Yoganidr&aacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1461"></A><A HREF="#fn_1461"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>, the great illusory energy of Vishn&#769;u, by whom, as utter ignorance, the whole world is beguiled. To her Vishn&#769;u said, "Go, Nidr&aacute;, to the nether regions, and by my command conduct successively six of their princes to be conceived of Devak&iacute;. When these shall have been put to death by Kansa, the seventh conception shall be formed of a portion of &#346;esha, who is a part of me; and this you shall transfer, before the time of birth, to Rohin&#769;&iacute;, another wife of Vasudeva, who resides at Gokula. The report shall run, that Devak&iacute; miscarries, through the anxiety of imprisonment, and dread of the R&aacute;j&aacute; of the Bhojas. From being extracted from his mother's womb, the child shall be known by the name of Sankarshan&#769;a, and he shall be valiant and strong, and like the peak of the white mountain in</p>

In the night of the eighth lunation of the dark half of the month Nabhas, in the season of the rains, I shall be born. You shall receive birth on the ninth. Impelled and aided by my power, Vasudeva shall bear me to the bed of Ya&#347;od&aacute;, and you to that of Devak&iacute;. Kansa shall take you, and hold you up to dash you against a stone; but you shall escape from his grasp into the sky, where the hundred-eyed Indra shall meet and do homage to you, through reverence for me, and shall bow before you, and acknowledge you as his sister. Having slain Sumbha, Nisumbha, and numerous other demons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1462"></A><A HREF="#fn_1462"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>, you shall sanctify the earth in many places&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1463"></A><A HREF="#fn_1463"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A>. Thou art wealth, progeny, fame, patience, heaven and earth, fortitude, modesty, nutrition, dawn, and every other female (form or property). They who address thee morning and afternoon with reverence and praise, and call thee &Aacute;ry&aacute;, Durg&aacute;, Vedagarbh&aacute;, Ambik&aacute;, Bhadr&aacute;, Bhadrak&aacute;l&iacute;, Kshem&iacute;, or Kshemankar&iacute;, shall receive from my bounty whatever they desire. Propitiated with offerings of wine and flesh and various viands, thou shalt bestow upon mankind all their prayers. Through my favour all men shall ever have faith in thee. Assured of this, go, goddess, and execute my commands."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1438"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1438">491:1</A> The whole of this book is dedicated to the biography of Krishn&#769;a. Many of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as omit this subject altogether, or only allude to it occasionally. In others it is equally prominent. The Br&aacute;hma P. gives the story exactly in the same words as our text: which has the best right to them may be questioned; but, as it is usually met with, the Br&aacute;hma P. is a very heterogeneous compilation. The Hari Van&#347;a has a narrative more detailed than that of the text, with additions and embellishments of its own. The Brahma Vaivartta throughout celebrates the acts of Krishn&#769;a; and one portion of it, the Krishn&#769;a Janma Khan&#769;d&#769;a, especially describes his boyhood and youth. The incidents are the same in general as those in the text, but they are lost amidst interminable descriptions of Krishn&#769;a's sports with the Gop&iacute;s and with his mistress R&aacute;dh&aacute;, a person not noticed elsewhere; the whole is in a style indicative of a modern origin. The Agni P. and Padma P. (Uttara Khan&#769;d&#769;a) have accounts of Krishn&#769;a, but they are mere summaries, compiled evidently from other works. The principal authority for the adventures of Krishn&#769;a is the Bh&aacute;gavata, the tenth book of which is exclusively devoted to him. It is this work which has, no doubt, mainly extended the worship of Krishn&#769;a, as its popularity is evinced by its having been translated into all the spoken languages of India professing to have a literature. The Prem-sagar, its Hindi version, is well known; but there are also translations in Mahratta, Telugu, Tamil, &amp;c. It does not seem likely, however, that the Vishn&#769;u P. has copied the Bh&aacute;gavata; for although. its greater conciseness may sometimes look like abridgment, yet the descriptions are generally of a more simple and antiquated character. Here, as usual, the <a name="page_492"><font size="1" color="green">p. 492</font></A> Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata is no doubt the earliest extant authority; but it is not the earliest, for whilst it omits to narrate most of his personal adventures unconnected with his alliance with the P&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;avas, it often alludes to them, and names repeatedly his capital, his wives, and his progeny. It also devotes a section, the Mau&#347;ala P., to the destruction of the Y&aacute;davas. The story of Krishn&#769;a the prince and hero must have been complete when the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata was compiled. It is doubtful, however, if Krishn&#769;a the boy, and his adventures at Vrind&aacute;van, were not subsequent inventions. There are no allusions to them in the poem, of an unsuspicious nature. The only ones that I have met with are contained in a speech by &#346;i&#347;up&aacute;la, Sabh&aacute; P., vol. I. p. 360, in which he reviles Krishn&#769;a; but they may easily have been interpolated. There may be others scattered through the poem, but I have not observed them.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1439"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1439">492:2</A> The notices of Krishn&#769;a's origin and character in various passages of the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata are by no means consistent, and indicate different dates at least. In an address to him by Arjuna, Vana P., vol. I. p. 436, he is said to have passed thousands of years in various holy places, engaged in arduous penances. He is frequently identified with the Rishi N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a, or he and Arjuna are said to be Nara and N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a. In the D&aacute;na-dharma he is represented as a worshipper of &#346;iva, and propitiating him and his wife Um&aacute;, and receiving as boons from them wives and children. As a warrior and prince he is always on the scene; but he is repeatedly called an An&#347;a, or portion of Vishn&#769;u; whilst in a great number of places he is identified with Vishn&#769;u or N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a, and is consequently 'all things.' This latter is his character, of course, amongst the Vaishn&#769;avas, agreeably to the text of the Bh&aacute;gavata: 'Krishn&#769;a is the lord (Vishn&#769;u) himself.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1440"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1440">492:3</A> This is a still farther diminution of Krishn&#769;a's dignity; he is not even a part, but 'a part of a part,' An&#347;&aacute;n&#347;&aacute;vat&aacute;ra: but this, the commentator maintains, is to be understood only of his form or condition as man, not of his power, as it suffered no diminution, either in its primary or secondary state, as light by suffusion suffers no decrease; and a verse of the Veda is cited to this effect: 'Though that which is full be taken from what is full, yet the remainder is undiminished;' 'Krishn&#769;a is nevertheless the very supreme Brahma, though it be a mystery how the supreme should assume the form of a man.' So the Bh&aacute;gavata in one passage predicts that the Para-purusha, Purushottama or Vishn&#769;u, will be born visibly in the dwelling of Vasudeva.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1441"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1441">493:4</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata tells the circumstance as in the text. The Hari Van&#347;a makes N&aacute;rada apprise Kansa of his danger. N&aacute;rada's interposition is not mentioned until afterwards by our authority. Devak&iacute; is the cousin of Kansa: see <A HREF="vp107.htm#page_436">p. 436</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1453"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1453">496:16</A> Or the passage is understood, 'Thou art one subsequently to Prakriti;' that is, thou art Brahm&aacute;, the active will of the supreme, creating forms from rudimental matter.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1454"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1454">496:17</A> As the three fires enjoined by the Vedas, and the fire metaphorically of devotion; or lightnings, solar heat, fire generated artificially, and the fire of digestion or animal fire; or Vishn&#769;u in that character bestows beauty, vigour, power, and wealth.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1456"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1456">496:19</A> Beyond the separate layers or envelopes of elementary substances (see <A HREF="vp036.htm#page_19">p. 19</A>); or, according to the Ved&aacute;nta notions, uninvested by those grosser sheaths or coverings, derived from food and the like, by which subtile body is enclosed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1457"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1457">496:20</A> Mah&aacute;vibh&uacute;ti sansth&aacute;na. Vibh&uacute;ti is explained by Prapancha, sensible, material, or elementary substance, constituting body.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1458"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1458">496:21</A> The passage is somewhat obscurely expressed, and is differently interpreted; <a name="page_497"><font size="1" color="green">p. 497</font></A> it is, 'Not from no cause, nor from cause, nor from cause and no cause.' The term 'no cause' may, the commentator says, designate fixed prescribed duties, the Nityakarma; 'cause' may signify occasional sacrifices, the K&aacute;mya-karma: neither of these can form any necessity for Vishn&#769;u's descent, as they might of a mere mortal's being born on the earth: or K&aacute;ran&#769;a is explained to mean 'obtaining pleasure,' from Ka and &Aacute;ran&#769;a, 'obtaining;' obtaining happiness, or the cause of it, piety, virtue; and with the negative, Ak&aacute;ran&#769;a, the reverse, pain, the consequence of wickedness. The purport is clear enough; it is merely meant to state that Vishn&#769;u is not subject to the necessity which is the cause of human birth.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1459"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1459">497:22</A> The term Pradh&aacute;na, which is repeated in this passage, is explained in the second place to mean Pum&aacute;n, 'soul' or 'spirit.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1460"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1460">497:23</A> The same account of the origin of Krishn&#769;a is given in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, &Aacute;di P., vol. I. p. 266. The white hair is impersonated as Balar&aacute;ma; the black, as Krishn&#769;a. The commentator on our text maintains that this is not to be literally understood: 'Vishn&#769;u did not intend that the two hairs should become incarnate, but he meant to signify, that, should he send them, they would be more than sufficient to destroy Kansa and his demons: or the birth of R&aacute;ma and Krishn&#769;a was a double illusion, <a name="page_498"><font size="1" color="green">p. 498</font></A> typified by the two hairs.' This seems to be a refinement upon an older and somewhat undignified account of the origin of Krishn&#769;a and his brother. The commentator on the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata argues that they are to be understood merely as the media by which Devak&iacute; and Roh&iacute;n&iacute; conceived.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1461"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1461">498:24</A> Yoganidr&aacute; is the sleep of devotion or abstraction, the active principle of illusion, personified, and also termed M&aacute;y&aacute; and Maham&aacute;y&aacute;, also Avidy&aacute; or ignorance. In the Durg&aacute; M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya of the M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya Pur&aacute;n&#769;a a she appears as Dev&iacute; or Durg&aacute;, the &#346;akti or bride of &#346;iva; but in our text as Vaishn&#769;avi, or the &#346;akti of Vishn&#769;u.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1462"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1462">499:25</A> Allusion is here made to the exploits of Durg&aacute;, as celebrated especially in the Durg&aacute; M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya; and it must be posterior to the date of that or some similar composition. The passage may be an interpolation, as the M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya P. in general has the appearance of being a more recent compilation than the Vishn&#769;u.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1463"></A><A HREF="vp118.htm#fr_1463">499:26</A> This refers to the P&iacute;t&#769;ha sth&aacute;nas, 'fifty-one places,' where, according to the Tantras, the limbs of &#346;at&iacute; fell, when scattered by her husband &#346;iva, as he bore her dead body about, and tore it to pieces, after she had put an end to her existence at Daksha's sacrifice. This part of the legend seems to be an addition to the original fable made by the Tantras, as it is not in the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as (see the story of Daksha's sacrifice). It bears some analogy to the Egyptian fable of Isis and Osiris. At the P&iacute;t&#769;ha sth&aacute;nas, however, of Jw&aacute;l&aacute;mukh&iacute;, Vindhyav&aacute;sin&iacute;, K&aacute;l&iacute;gh&aacute;t, and others, temples are erected to the different forms of Dev&iacute; or &#346;at&iacute;, not to the phallic emblem of Mah&aacute;deva, which, if present, is there as an accessory and embellishment, not as a principal, and the chief object of worship is a figure of the goddess; a circumstance in which there is an essential difference between the temples of Durg&aacute; and shrines of Osiris.</P>
