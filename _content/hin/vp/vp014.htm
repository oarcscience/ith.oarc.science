<p>10. Brahma-vaivartta Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. "That Pur&aacute;n&#769;a which is related by S&aacute;varn&#769;i to N&aacute;rada, and contains the account of the greatness of Krishn&#769;a, with the occurrences of the Rathantara Kalpa, where also the story of Brahma-var&aacute;ha is repeatedly told, is called the Brahma-vaivartta, and contains eighteen thousand stanzas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A>." The account here given of the Brahma-vaivartta Pur&aacute;n&#769;a agrees with its present state as to its extent. The copies rather exceed than fall short of eighteen thousand stanzas. It also correctly represents its comprising a M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya or legend of Krishn&#769;a; but it is very doubtful, nevertheless, if the same work is intended.</p>  
<p>The Brahma-vaivartta, as it now exists, is narrated, not by S&aacute;varn&#769;i, but the Rishi N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a to N&aacute;rada, by whom it is communicated to Vy&aacute;sa: he teaches it to S&uacute;ta, and the latter repeats it to the Rishis at Naimish&aacute;ran&#769;ya. It is divided into four Khan&#769;d&#769;as, or books; the Br&aacute;hma, Prakriti, Gane&#347;a, and Krishn&#769;a Janma Khan&#769;d&#769;as; dedicated severally to describe the acts of Brahm&aacute;, Dev&iacute;, Gane&#347;a, and Krishn&#769;a; the latter, however, throughout absorbing the interest and importance of the work. In none of these is there any account of the Var&aacute;ha Avat&aacute;ra of Vishn&#769;u, which seems to be intended by the Matsya; nor any reference to a Rathantara Kalpa. It may also be observed, that, in describing the merit of presenting a copy of this Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, the Matsya adds, "Whoever makes such gift, is honoured in the Brahma-loka;" a sphere which is of very inferior dignity to that to which a worshipper of Krishn&#769;a is taught to aspire by this Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. The character of the work is in truth so decidedly sectarial, and the sect to which it belongs so distinctly marked,</p>

<p>that of the worshippers of the juvenile Krishn&#769;a and R&aacute;dh&aacute;, a form of belief of known modern origin, that it can scarcely have found a notice in a work to which, like the Matsya, a much more remote date seems to belong. Although therefore the Matsya may be received in proof of there having been a Brahma-vaivartta Pur&aacute;n&#769;a at the date of its compilation, dedicated especially to the honour of Krishn&#769;a, yet we cannot credit the possibility of its being the same we now possess.</p>  
<p>Although some of the legends believed to be ancient are scattered through the different portions of this Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, yet the great mass of it is taken up with tiresome descriptions of Vrindavan and Goloka, the dwellings of Krishn&#769;a on earth and in heaven; with endless repetitions of prayers and invocations addressed to him; and with insipid descriptions of his person and sports, and the love of the Gop&iacute;s and of R&aacute;dh&aacute; towards him. There are some particulars of the origin of the artificer castes, which is of value because it is cited as authority in matters affecting them, contained in the Br&aacute;hma Khan&#769;d&#769;a; and in the Pr&aacute;krita and Gane&#347;a Khan&#769;d&#769;as are legends of those divinities, not wholly, perhaps, modern inventions, but of which the source has not been traced. In the life of Krishn&#769;a the incidents recorded are the same as those narrated in the Vishn&#769;u and the Bh&aacute;gavata; but the stories, absurd as they are, are much compressed to make room for original matter, still more puerile and tiresome. The Brahma-vaivartta has not the slightest title to be regarded as a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A>.</p>
