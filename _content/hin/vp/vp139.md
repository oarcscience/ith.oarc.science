### CHAP. XXII.

Jarásandha besieges Mathurá; is defeated, but repeatedly renews the
attack.

PARÁŚARA.--The mighty Kansa had married the two daughters of Jarásandha,
one named Asti, the other Práptí. Jarásandha was king of Magadhá, and a
very powerful prince <span id="fr_1522"></span>[1](#fn_1522); who, when
he heard that Krishńa had killed his son-in-law, was much incensed, and,
collecting a large force, marched against Mathurá, determined to put the
Yádavas and Krishńa to the sword. Accordingly he invested the city with
three and twenty numerous divisions of his forces <span
id="fr_1523"></span>[2](#fn_1523). Ráma and Janárddana sallied from the
town with a slender, but resolute force, and fought bravely with the
armies of Magadhá. The two youthful leaders prudently resolved to have
recourse to their ancient weapons, and accordingly the bow of Hari, with
two quivers filled with exhaustless arrows, and the mace called
Kaumodaki, and the ploughshare of Balabhadra, as well as the club
Saunanda, descended at a wish from heaven. Armed with these weapons,
they speedily discomfited the king of Magadhá and his hosts, and
reentered the city in triumph.

Although the wicked king of Magadhá, Jarásandha, was defeated, yet
Krishńa knew that whilst he escaped alive he was not subdued; and in
fact he soon returned with a mighty force, and was again forced by Ráma
and Krishńa to fly. Eighteen times <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[3](#fn_1524) did the haughty prince of Magadhá
renew his attack upon the Yádavas, headed by Krishńa; and was as often
defeated and put to the rout by them, with very inferior numbers. That
the Yádavas were not overpowered by their foes, was owing to the present
might of the portion of the discus-armed Vishńu.

<span id="page_564">p. 564</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It was the pastime
of the lord of the universe, in his capacity of man, to launch various
weapons against his enemies; for what effort of power to annihilate his
foes could be necessary to him, whose fiat creates and destroys the
world? but as subjecting himself to human customs, he formed alliances
with the brave, and engaged in hostilities with the base. He had
recourse to the four devices of policy, or negotiation, presents, sowing
dissension, and chastisement; and sometimes even betook himself to
flight. Thus imitating the conduct of human beings, the lord of the
world pursued at will his sports.

<span id="fn_1522"></span>[563:1](vp139.htm#fr_1522) See page
[456](vp112.htm#page_456).

<span id="fn_1523"></span>[563:2](vp139.htm#fr_1523) With twenty-three
Akshouhinis, each consisting of 109,300 infantry, 65,610 horse, 22,870
chariots, and as many elephants. The Hari Vanśa enumerates, as the
allies or tributaries of Jarásandha, a number of princes from various
parts of India, but this is a gratuitous embellishment.

<span id="fn_1524"></span>[563:3](vp139.htm#fr_1524) The Bhágavata and
Hari Vanśa say 'seventeen times.' The latter indulges in a prolix
description of the first encounter; nothing of which occurs in the
Bhágavata, any more than in our text.
