Of Suhma it may be remarked, that it is specified in the Siddh&aacute;nta Kaumud&iacute; as an example of Panin&iacute;'s rule; 17.3.24; by which Nagara compounded with names of countries in the east becomes N&aacute;gara, as Sauhman&aacute;gara, 'produced, &amp;c. in a city of Suhma.' The descendants of Anu, according to the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata were all Mlechchhas. The last named work, as well as the V&aacute;yu and Matsya Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, have an absurd story of the circumstances of the birth of D&iacute;rghatamas, who was the son of Uj&aacute;si or Utathya, the elder brother of Vrihaspati by Mamat&aacute;, and of his begetting Anga <a name="page_445"><font size="1" color="green">p. 445</font></A> and the rest. They agree in assigning descendants of all four castes to them; the V&aacute;yu stating that Bali had ### and the Matsya ascribing it to a boon given by Brahm&aacute; to Bali: 'Do thou establish the four perpetual castes.' Of these, the Brahmans are known as B&aacute;leyas: ###. The Matsya calls Bali, the son of Virochana, and 'existing for a whole Kalpa;' identifying him therefore, only in a different period and form, with the Bali of the V&aacute;mana Avat&aacute;ra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1207"></A><A HREF="vp111.htm#fr_1207">445:13</A> An&aacute;p&aacute;na: V&aacute;yu. Khan&aacute;p&aacute;na: Bh&aacute;gavata. Adhiv&aacute;hana: Agni. Dadhivahana: Matsya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1208"></A><A HREF="vp111.htm#fr_1208">445:14</A> This prince is said in the V&aacute;yu to have drank the Soma juice along with Indra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1209"></A><A HREF="vp111.htm#fr_1209">445:15</A> The Matsya and Agni insert a Satyaratha.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1210"></A><A HREF="vp111.htm#fr_1210">445:16</A> This is noticed in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan&#769;a, in the story of the hermit Rishya&#347;ringa, to whom &#346;&aacute;nt&aacute; was given in marriage. Her adoptive father is called in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan&#769;a, as the is in the Agni and Matsya, Lomap&aacute;da: the meaning is the same, 'hairy foot.' R&aacute;m&aacute;yan&#769;a, IX. X. See also Prelude to the Uttara R&aacute;ma Cheritra, Hindu Theatre, I. 289.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1211"></A><A HREF="vp111.htm#fr_1211">445:17</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata differs here from all the other authorities in omitting Champa, the founder of Champapur&iacute;, a city of which traces still remain in the vicinity of Bhagalpur, having inserted him previously amongst the descendants of Ikshw&aacute;ku (see <A HREF="vp095.htm#page_373">p. 373</A>. n. <A HREF="vp095.htm#fn_982">12</A>). Champ&aacute; is every where recognised as the capital of Anga, and the translators of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan&#769;a were very wide of the truth, when they conjectured that it might be Angwa or Ava.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1212"></A><A HREF="vp111.htm#fr_1212">445:18</A> Vrihaddarbha: Br&aacute;hma. The Bh&aacute;gavata omits the two successors of Champa, and makes Vrihadratha, Vrihatkarman, and Vrihadbh&aacute;nu, sons of Prithul&aacute;ksha.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1213"></A><A HREF="vp111.htm#fr_1213">445:19</A> The V&aacute;yu, Matsya, and Hari V. make Vijaya the brother of Jayadratha. The Bh&aacute;gavata agrees with our text. The mother of Vijaya from her origin was of the S&uacute;ta caste, the genealogist and charioteer. Manu, X. 47. Her son was of the same caste, children taking the caste of the mother: consequently the descendants of Vijaya, kings of Anga, were S&uacute;tas; and this explains the contemptuous application of the term S&uacute;ta to Karn&#769;a, the half brother of the P&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;us; for he, as <a name="page_446"><font size="1" color="green">p. 446</font></A> will presently be mentioned, was adopted into the Anga family, and succeeded to the crown.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1214"></A><A HREF="vp111.htm#fr_1214">446:20</A> Some variety prevails in the series of princes here, but this arises from not distinguishing the collateral lines, the descendants of Jayadratha from those of Vijaya. The V&aacute;yu and Matsya give the latter as in our text, but they agree also with the Agni and Br&aacute;hma in the successors of Jayadratha, as Drid&#769;haratha or Vrihadratha, and Janamejaya or Vi&#347;wajit.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1215"></A><A HREF="vp111.htm#fr_1215">446:21</A> S&uacute;rasena: V&aacute;yu. Vikarn&#769;a: Br&aacute;hma.</P>
