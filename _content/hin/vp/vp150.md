### CHAP. XXXIII.

Báńa solicits Śiva for war: finds Aniruddha in the palace, and makes him
prisoner. Krishńa, Balaráma, and Pradyumna come to his rescue Śiva and
Skanda aid Báńa: the former is disabled; the latter put to flight. Báńa
encounters Krishńa, who cuts off all his arms, and is about to put him
to death. Śiva intercedes, and Krishńa a spares his life. Vishńu and
Śiva are the same.

BEFORE this took place, Báńa had been engaged in the adoration of the
three-eyed god, and had thus prayed to him: "I am humiliated, O lord, by
the possession of a thousand arms in a state of peace; let some
hostilities ensue, in which I may derive some advantage from their
possession. Without war, what is the use of these arms? they are but a
burden to me." Śankara replied, "When thy peacock banner shall be
broken, thou shalt have war, the delight of the evil spirits that feast
on the flesh of man." Báńa, pleased by this promise, proffered his
thanks to Śambhu, and returned to his palace, where he found his
standard broken; at which his joy was increased.

At that time the nymph Chitralekhá returned from Dwáraká, and by the
exercise of her magic power brought Aniruddha along with her. The guards
of the inner apartments discovering him there with Ushá, reported it to
the king who immediately sent a body of his followers to seize the
prince; but the valiant youth, taking up an iron club, slew his
assailants: on which Báńa mounted his car, advanced against him, and
endeavoured to put him to death. Finding, however, that Aniruddha was
not to be subdued by prowess, he followed the counsel of his minister,
and brought his magical faculties into the conflict, by which he
succeeded in capturing the Yadu prince, and binding him in serpent
bonds.

When Aniruddha was missed from Dwáravatí, and the Yádavas were inquiring
of one another whither he had gone, Nárada came to them, and told them
that he was the prisoner of Báńa, having been conveyed by a female,
possessed of magic faculties, to Śońitapura <span
id="fr_1552"></span>[1](#fn_1552) When they heard

<span id="page_594">p. 594</span>

this, they were satisfied; for they had imagined he had been taken away
by the gods (in reprisal for the Párijáta tree). Krishńa therefore
immediately summoned Garud́a, who came with a wish; and mounting upon
him, along with Bala and Pradyumna, he set off for the city of Báńa. On
their approach to the city they were opposed by the spirits who attend
on Rudra, but these were soon destroyed by Hari, and he and his
companions reached the vicinity of the town. Here mighty Fever, an
emanation from Maheśwara, having three feet and three heads <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[2](#fn_1553), fought desperately with Vishńu in
defence of Báńa. Baladeva, upon whom his ashes were scattered, was
seized with burning heat, and his eyelids trembled: but he obtained
relief by clinging to the body of Krishńa. Contending thus with the
divine holder of the bow, the Fever emanating from Śiva was quickly
expelled from the person of Krishńa by Fever which he himself
engendered. Brahmá beholding the impersonated malady bewildered by the
beating inflicted by the arms of the deity, entreated the latter to
desist; and the foe of Madhu refrained, and absorbed into himself the
fever he had created. The rival Fever then departed, saying to Krishńa,
"Those men who call to memory the combat between us shall be ever exempt
from febrile disease."

Next Vishńu overcame and demolished the five fires <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[3](#fn_1554), and with perfect ease annihilated the
army of the Dánavas. Then the son of Bali (Báńa),

<span id="page_595">p. 595</span>

with the whole of the Daitya host, assisted by Śankara and Kártikeya,
fought with Śauri. A fierce combat took place between Hari and Śankara;
all the regions shook, scorched by their flaming weapons, and the
celestials felt assured that the end of the universe was at hand.
Govinda, with the weapon of yawning, set Śankara a-gape; and then the
demons and the demigods attendant upon Śiva were destroyed on every
side; for Hara, overcome with incessant gaping, sat down in his car, and
was unable longer to contend with Krishńa, whom no acts affect. The
deity of war, Kártikeya, wounded in the arm by Garud́a, struck by the
weapons of Pradyumna, and disarmed by the shout of Hari, took to flight.
Báńa, when he saw Śankara disabled, the Daityas destroyed, Guha fled,
and Śiva's followers slain, advanced on his vast car, the horses of
which were harnessed by Nandíśa, to encounter Krishńa and his associates
Bala and Pradyumna. The valiant Balabhadra, attacking the host of Báńa,
wounded them in many ways with his arrows, and put them to a shameful
rout; and their sovereign beheld them dragged about by Ráma with his
ploughshare, or beaten by him with his club, or pierced by Krishńa with
his arrows: he therefore attacked Krishńa, and a fight took place
between them: they cast at each other fiery shafts, that pierced through
their armour; but Krishńa intercepted with his arrows those of Báńa, and
cut them to pieces. Báńa nevertheless wounded Keśava, and the wielder of
the discus wounded Báńa; and both desirous of victory, and seeking
enraged the death of his antagonist, hurled various missiles at each
other. When an infinite number of arrows had been cut to pieces, and the
weapons began to be exhausted, Krishńa resolved to put Báńa to death.
The destroyer of the demon host therefore took up his discus Sudarśana,
blazing with the radiance of a hundred suns. As he was in the act of
casting it, the mystical goddess Kot́aví, the magic lore of the demons,
stood naked before him <span id="fr_1555"></span>[4](#fn_1555). Seeing
her before him, Krishńa, with unclosed eyes, cast

<span id="page_596">p. 596</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sudarśana, to cut
off the arms of Báńa. The discus, dreaded in its flight by the whole of
the weapons of the demons, lopped off successively the numerous arms of
the Asura. Beholding Krishńa with the discus again in his hand, and
preparing to launch it once more, for the total demolition of Báńa, the
foe of Tripura (Śiva) respectfully addressed him. The husband of Umá,
seeing the blood streaming from the dissevered arms of Báńa, approached
Govinda, to solicit a suspension of hostilities, and said to him,
"Krishńa, Krishńa, lord of the world, I know thee, first of spirits, the
supreme lord, infinite felicity, without beginning or end, and beyond
all things. This sport of universal being, in which thou takest the
persons of god, animals, and men, is a subordinate attribute of thy
energy. Be propitious therefore, O lord, unto me. I have given Báńa
assurance of safety; do not thou falsify that which I have spoken. He
has grown old in devotion to me; let him not incur thy displeasure. The
Daitya has received a boon from me, and therefore I deprecate thy
wrath." When he had concluded, Govinda, dismissing his resentment
against the Asura, looked graciously on the lord of Umá, the wielder of
the trident, and said to him, "Since you, Śankara, have given a boon
unto Báńa, let him live: from respect to your promises, my discus is
arrested: the assurance of safety granted by you is granted also by me.
You are fit to apprehend that you are not distinct from me. *That* which
I am, thou art; and *that* also is this world, with its gods, demons,
and mankind. Men contemplate distinctions, because they are stupified by
ignorance." So saying, Krishńa went to the place where the son of
Pradyumna was confined. The snakes that bound him were destroyed, being
blasted by the breath of Garud́a: and Krishńa, placing him, along with
his wife, upon the celestial bird, returned with Pradyumna and Ráma to
Dwáraká <span id="fr_1556"></span>[4](#fn_1556).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1552"></span>[593:1](vp150.htm#fr_1552) The synonymes of
Śońitapura in the Trikáńd́a Śesha are Devikot́a, Báńapur, Kot́ívarsham, and
Ushávana. The first is usually considered to be the modern Devicotta in
the Carnatic, which is commonly believed to be the scene of Báńa's
defeat. The name, however, occurs in other parts of India; in the
Dekhin, on <span id="page_594">p. 594</span> the banks of the Godávarí,
according to Wilford the capital of Munja (As. Res. IX. 199); and in
Asam, near Gwalpára, as the city of the Daityas. As. Res. XIV. 443
Hamilton notices the remains of a city so called in Dinajpur. In the
Káliká P., Báńa is described as the friend, and apparently neighbour, of
Naraka, king of Pragjyotish or Asam.

<span id="fn_1553"></span>[594:2](vp150.htm#fr_1553) Alluding to the
three stages of febrile paroxysms, or to the recurrence of tertian ague.
A contest with this enemy, in the course of military operations, is an
allegory which the British armies in India too often illustrate.

<span id="fn_1554"></span>[594:3](vp150.htm#fr_1554) The Áhavaniya,
Gárhapatya, Dakshińa, Sabhya, and Ávasathya, are the five fires; of
which the three first have a religious, and the other two a secular
character. The first is a fire prepared for oblations at an occasional
sacrifice: the second is the household fire, to be perpetually
maintained: the third is a sacrificial fire, in the centre of the other
two, and placed to the south: the Sabhya is a fire lighted to warm a
party: and the Ávasatthya the common domestic or culinary fire. Manu,
III. too, 185, and Kullúka Bhat́t́a's explanation.

<span id="fn_1555"></span>[595:4](vp150.htm#fr_1555) Kot́aví is said to
be an eighth portion of Rudráńí, and the tutelary goddess of the
Daityas, composed of incantations. The Hari V. calls her also Lambá, and
intimates her being the mother of Báńa, and as identical with Durgá. The
word in the lexicons designates a naked woman, and is thence applicable
to Durgá, in some of her forms.

<span id="fn_1556"></span>[596:4](vp150.htm#fr_1556) There can be little
doubt that this legend describes a serious struggle between the Śaivas
and Vaishńavas, in which the latter, according to their own report, were
victorious; and the Śaivas, although they attempt to make out a sort of
compromise between Rudra and Krishńa, are obliged to admit his having
the worst of the conflict, and his inability to protect his votary. The
Bhágavata tells the story much as the text. The Hari V. amplifies even
more than usual, the narrative occupying nearly seventy pages of the
French translation. The legend is to be found to the same purport, but
in various degrees of detail, in the Agni P., Kúrma P., Padma P. (Uttara
Khańd́a), Vámana P., and Brahma Vaivartta P. (Krishńa Janma Khańd́a).
