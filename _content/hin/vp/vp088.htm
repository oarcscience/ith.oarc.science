<p>"When a householder finds that any circumstance has occurred, or a distinguished guest has arrived, on which account ancestral ceremonies are appropriate, the should celebrate them. He should offer a voluntary sacrifice upon any atmospheric portent, at the equinoctial and solstitial periods, at eclipses of the sun and moon, on the sun's entrance into a zodiacal sign, upon unpropitious aspects of the planets and asterisms, on dreaming unlucky dreams, and on eating the grain of the year's harvest.

It is not easy for a man to effect his object, who is desirous of worshipping the Pitris or the gods on a day of new moon when the stars are those of Dhanisht&#769;h&aacute;, Purvabh&aacute;drapad&aacute;, or &#346;at&aacute;bhish&aacute;. Hear also an account of another class of Sr&aacute;ddhas, which afford especial contentment to progenitors, as explained by Sanatkum&aacute;ra, the son of Brahm&aacute;, to the magnanimous Pur&uacute;ravas, when full of faith and devotion to the Pitris he inquired how he might please them. The third lunar day of the month Vai&#347;&aacute;kha (April, May), and the ninth of K&aacute;rtika</p>

<p><a name="page_323"><font size="1" color="green">p. 323</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (October, November), in the light fortnight; the thirteenth of Nabha (July, August), and the fifteenth of M&aacute;gha (January, February), in the dark fortnight; are called by ancient teachers the anniversaries of the first day of a Yuga, or age (Yug&aacute;dya), and are esteemed most sacred. On these days, water mixed with sesamum-seeds should be regularly presented to the progenitors of mankind; as well as on every solar and lunar eclipse; on the eighth lunations of the dark fortnights of Agrah&aacute;yan&#769;a, M&aacute;gha, and Ph&aacute;lguna (December--February); on the two days commencing the solstices, when the nights and days alternately begin to diminish; on those days which are the anniversaries of the beginning of the Manwantaras; when the sun is in the path of the goat; and on all occurrences of meteoric phenomena. A &#346;r&aacute;ddha at these seasons contents the Pitris for a thousand years: such is the secret which they have imparted. The fifteenth day of the dark half of the month M&aacute;gha, when united with the conjunction of the asterism over which Varun&#769;a presides (Sat&aacute;bhish&aacute;), is a season of no little sanctity, when offerings are especially grateful to the progenitors. Food and water presented by men who are of respectable families, when the asterism Dhanisht&#769;h&aacute; is combined with the day of new moon, content the Pitris for ten thousand years; whilst they repose for a whole age when satisfied by offerings made on the day of new moon when &Aacute;rdr&aacute; is the lunar mansion.</p>  
<p>"He who, after having offered food and libations to the Pitris, bathes in the Ganges, Satlaj, Vip&aacute;&#347;&aacute; (Beyah), Saraswat&iacute;, or the Gomat&iacute; at Naimisha, expiates all his sins. The Pitris also say, 'After having received satisfaction for a twelvemonth, we shall further derive gratification by libations offered by our descendants at some place of pilgrimage, at the end of the dark fortnight of M&aacute;gha.' The songs of the Pitris confer purity of heart, integrity of wealth, prosperous seasons, perfect rites, and devout faith; all that men can desire. Hear the verses that constitute those songs, by listening to which all those advantages will be secured, oh prince, by you. 'That enlightened individual who begrudges not his wealth, but presents us with cakes, shall be born in a distinguished family. Prosperous and affluent shall that man ever be, who in honour of us gives to the Brahmans, if he is wealthy, jewels, clothes,</p>  
<p><a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="green">p. 324</font></A></p>  
<p>land, conveyances, wealth, or any valuable presents; or who, with faith and humility, entertains them with food, according to his means, at proper seasons. If he cannot afford to give them dressed food, he must, in proportion to his ability, present them with unboiled grain, or such gifts, however trifling, as he can bestow. Should he be utterly unable even to do this, he must give to some eminent Brahman, bowing at the same time before him, sesamum-seeds adhering to the tips of his fingers, and sprinkle water to us, from the palms of his hands, upon the ground; or he must gather, as he may, fodder for a day, and give it to a cow; by which he will, if firm in faith, yield us satisfaction. If nothing of this kind is practicable, he must go to a forest, and lift up his arms to the sun and other regents of the spheres, and say aloud--I have no money, nor property, nor grain, nor any thing whatever it for an ancestral offering. Bowing therefore to my ancestors, I hope the progenitors will be satisfied with these arms tossed up in the air in devotion.' These are the words of the Pitris themselves; and he who endeavours, with such means as he may possess, to fulfil their wishes, performs the ancestral rite called a &#346;r&aacute;ddha."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_878"></A><A HREF="vp088.htm#fr_878">322:1</A> <a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="green">p. 320</font></A> We may here take the opportunity of inquiring who are meant by the Pitris; and, generally speaking, they may be called a race of divine beings, inhabiting celestial regions of their own, and receiving into their society the spirits of those mortals for whom the rite of fellowship in obsequial cakes with them, the Sapin&#769;d&#769;&iacute;karan&#769;a, has been duly performed. The Pitris collectively, therefore, include a man's ancestors; but the principal members of this order of beings are of a different origin. The V&aacute;yu, Matsya, and Padma Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, and Hari Van&#347;a, profess to give an account of the original Pitris. The account is much the same, and for the most part in the same words, in all. They agree in distinguishing the Pitris into seven classes; three of which are without form, or composed of intellectual, not elementary substance, and assuming what forms they please; and four are corporeal. When they come to the enumeration of the particular classes they somewhat differ, and the accounts in all the works are singularly imperfect. According to a legend given by the V&aacute;yu and the Hari Van&#347;a, the first Pitris were the sons of the gods. The gods having offended Brahm&aacute;, by neglecting to worship him, were cursed by him to become fools; but upon their repentance he directed them to apply to their sons for instruction. Being taught accordingly the rites of expiation and penance by their sons, they addressed them as fathers; whence the sons of the gods were the first Pitris. So the <A HREF="errata.htm#14">Matsya</A> has 'The Pitris are born in the Manwantaras as the sons of the gods.' The Hari Van&#347;a makes the sons assume the character of fathers, addressing them, 'Depart, children.' Again; the V&aacute;yu P. declares the seven orders of Pitris to have been originally the first gods, the Vair&aacute;jas, whom Brahm&aacute;, with the eye of Yoga, beheld in the eternal spheres, and who are the gods of the gods. Again; in the same work we have the incorporeal Pitris called Vair&aacute;jas, from being the sons of the Praj&aacute;pati Viraja. The Matsya agrees with this latter statement, and adds that the gods worship them. The Hari Van&#347;a has the same statement, but more precisely <a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="green">p. 321</font></A> distinguishes the Vair&aacute;jas as one class only of the incorporeal Pitris. The commentator states the same, calling the three incorporeal Pitris, Vair&aacute;jas, Agnishw&aacute;ttas, and Varhishads; and the four corporeal orders, Suk&aacute;las, &Aacute;ngirasas, Suswadhas, and Somap&aacute;s. The Vair&aacute;jas are described as the fathers of Men&aacute;, the mother of Um&aacute;. Their abode is variously termed the S&aacute;nt&aacute;nika, San&aacute;tana, and Soma loka. As the posterity of Viraja, they are the Somasads of Manu. The other classes of Pitris the three Pur&aacute;n&#769;as agree with Manu in representing as the sons of the patriarchs, and in general assign to them the same offices and posterity. They are the following:--</p>  
<p>Agnishw&aacute;ttas--sons of Mar&iacute;chi, and Pitris of the gods (Manu, Matsya, Padma): living in Soma-loka, and parents of Achchod&aacute; (Matsya, Padma, Hari Van&#347;a). The V&aacute;yu makes them residents of Viraja-loka, sons of Pulastya, Pitris of the demigods and demons, and parents of P&iacute;var&iacute;; omitting the next order of Pitris, to whom these circumstances more accurately refer. The commentator on the Hari V. derives the name from Agnishu, 'in or by oblations to fire,' and &Aacute;tta, 'obtained,' 'invoked.'</p>  
<p>Varhishads--sons of Atri, and Pitris of the demons (Manu): sons of Pulastya, Pitris of the demons, residents in Vaibhr&aacute;ja, fathers of P&iacute;var&iacute; (Matsya, Padma, Hari V.).</p>  
<p>These three are the formless or incorporeal Pitris.</p>  
<p>Somap&aacute;s--descendants of Bhrigu, or sons of Kavi by Swadh&aacute;, the daughter of Agni; and Pitris of the Brahmans (Manu and V&aacute;yu P.). The Padma calls them Ushmap&aacute;s. The Hari V. calls the Somap&aacute;s, to whom it ascribes the same descent as the V&aacute;yu, the Pitris of the &#346;&uacute;dras; and the Suk&aacute;las the Pitris of the Brahmans.</p>  
<p>Havishmantas--in the solar sphere, sons of Angiras, and Pitris of the Kshatriyas (Manu, V&aacute;yu, Matsya, Padma, Hari Van&#347;a).</p>  
<p>&Aacute;jyap&aacute;s--sons of Kardama, Pitris of the Vai&#347;yas, in the K&aacute;maduha-loka (Manu, &amp;c.); but the lawgiver calls them the sons of Pulastya. The Pitris of the Vai&#347;yas are called K&aacute;vyas in the Nandi Upapur&aacute;n&#769;a; and in the Hari Van&#347;a and its comment they are termed Suswadhas, sons of Kardama, descended from Pulaha.</p>  
<p>Suk&aacute;lins--sons of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, and Pitris of the &#346;&uacute;dras (Manu and V&aacute;yu P.). They are not mentioned in the Padma. The Matsya inserts the name and descent, but specifies them as amongst the incorporeal Pitris. It may be suspected that the passage is corrupt. The Hari Van&#347;a makes the Suk&aacute;las sons of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, the Pitris of the Brahmans; and gives the title of Somap&aacute;s to the Pitris of the &#346;&uacute;dras. In general this work follows the V&aacute;yu; but with omissions and transpositions, as if it had carelessly mutilated its original.</p>  
<p>Besides these Pitris or progenitors, other heavenly beings are sometimes made to adopt a similar character: thus Manu says, "The wise call our fathers Vasus; our paternal grandfathers, Rudras; our paternal great grandfathers, &Aacute;dityas; agreeably <a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="green">p. 322</font></A> to a text of the Vedas:" that is, these divine beings are to be meditated upon along with, and as not distinct from, progenitors. Hem&aacute;dri quotes the Nandi Upapur&aacute;n&#769;a for a different practice, and directs Vishn&#769;u to be identified with the father, Brahm&aacute; with the grandfather, and &#346;iva with the great grandfather. This, however, is &#346;aiva innovation. The Vaishn&#769;avas direct Aniruddha to be regarded as one's-self, and Pradyumna, Sankarshan&#769;a, and V&aacute;sudeva as the three ancestors. Again, they are identified with Varun&#769;a, Pr&aacute;j&aacute;patya, and Agni; or, again, with months, seasons, and years. Nirn&#769;aya Sindhu, p. 284. It may be doubted how far any of these correctly represent the original notions inculcated by the texts of the Vedas, from which, in the most essential particulars, they are derived.</P>
