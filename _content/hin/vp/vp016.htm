<p align="center"><font size="-1" color="green">12. The Var&aacute;ha Pur&aacute;n&#769;a</font></p>  
<p>12. Var&aacute;ha Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. "That in which the glory of the great Var&aacute;ha is predominant, as it was revealed to Earth by Vishn&#769;u, in connexion, wise Munis, with the M&aacute;nava Kalpa, and which contains twenty-four thousand verses, is called the V&aacute;r&aacute;ha Pur&aacute;n&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A>."</p>  
<p>It may be doubted if the Var&aacute;ha Pur&aacute;n&#769;a of the present day is here intended. It is narrated by Vishn&#769;u as Var&aacute;ha, or in the boar incarnation, to the personified Earth. Its extent, however, is not half that specified, little exceeding ten thousand stanzas. It furnishes also itself</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_xlv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xlv</font></A></p>  
<p>evidence of the prior currency of some other work, similarly denominated; as, in the description of Mathur&aacute; contained in it, Sumantu, a Muni, is made to observe, "The divine Var&aacute;ha in former times expounded a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, for the purpose of solving the perplexity of Earth."</p>  
<p>Nor can the Var&aacute;ha Pur&aacute;n&#769;a be regarded as a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a agreeably to the common definition, as it contains but a few scattered and brief allusions to the creation of the world, and the reign of kings: it has no detailed genealogies either of the patriarchal or regal families, and no account of the reigns of the Manus. Like the Linga Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, it is a religious manual, almost wholly occupied with forms of prayer, and rules for devotional observances, addressed to Vishn&#769;u; interspersed with legendary illustrations, most of which are peculiar to itself, though some are taken from the common and ancient stock: many of them, rather incompatibly with the general scope of the compilation, relate to the history of &#346;iva and Durg&aacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A>. A considerable portion of the work is devoted to descriptions of various T&iacute;rthas, places of Vaishn&#769;ava pilgrimage; and one of Mathur&aacute; enters into a variety of particulars relating to the shrines of that city, constituting the Mathur&aacute; M&aacute;h&aacute;tmyam.</p>  
<p>In the sectarianism of the Var&aacute;ha Pur&aacute;n&#769;a there is no leaning to the particular adoration of Krishn&#769;a, nor are the Rath-y&aacute;tr&aacute; and Janm&aacute;sht&#769;am&iacute; included amongst the observances enjoined. There are other indications of its belonging to an earlier stage of Vaishn&#769;ava worship, and it may perhaps be referred to the age of R&aacute;m&aacute;nuja, the early part of the twelfth century.</p>

The Tri &#346;akti M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya occurs, as he gives it, in my copy, and is so far an indication of the identity of the Var&aacute;ha Pur&aacute;n&#769;a in the different MSS.</P>
