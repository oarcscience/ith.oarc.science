<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Krishn&#769;a carries off Rukmin&iacute;: the princes who come to rescue her repulsed by Balar&aacute;ma. Rukmin overthrown, but spared by Krishn&#769;a, founds Bhojakat&#769;a. Pradyumna born of Rukmin&iacute;.</FONT></p>  
<p>BH&Iacute;SHMAKA was king of Vidarbha, residing at Kundina&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1534"></A><A HREF="#fn_1534"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. He had a son named Rukmin, and a beautiful daughter termed Rukmin&iacute;. Krishn&#769;a fell in love with the latter, and solicited her in marriage; but her brother who hated Krishn&#769;a, would not assent to the espousals. At the suggestion of Jar&aacute;sandha, and with the concurrence of his son, the powerful sovereign Bh&iacute;shmaka affianced Rukmin&iacute; to &#346;i&#347;up&aacute;la. In order to celebrate the nuptials, Jar&aacute;sandha and other princes, the friends of &#346;i&#347;up&aacute;la, assembled in the capital of Vidarbha; and Krishn&#769;a, attended by Balabhadra and many other Y&aacute;davas, also went to Kundina to witness the wedding. When there, Hari contrived, on the eve of the nuptials, to carry off the princess&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1535"></A><A HREF="#fn_1535"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, leaving R&aacute;ma and his kinsmen to sustain the weight of his enemies. Paun&#769;d&#769;raka, the illustrious Dantavakra, Viduratha, &#346;i&#347;up&aacute;la, Jar&aacute;sandha, &#346;alya, and other kings, indignant at the insult, exerted themselves to kill Krishn&#769;a, but were repelled by Balar&aacute;ma and the Y&aacute;davas. Rukmin, vowing that he would never enter Kundina again until he had slain Ke&#347;ava in fight, pursued and overtook him. In the combat that ensued, Krishn&#769;a destroyed with his discus, as if in sport, the host of Rukmin, with all its horse, and elephants, and foot, and chariots, and overthrew him, and hurled him on the ground, and would have put him to death, but was withheld by the entreaties of Rukmin&iacute;. "He is my only brother," she exclaimed, "and must not be slain by</p>

<p>thee: restrain your wrath, O divine lord, and give me my brother in charity." Thus addressed by her, Krishn&#769;a, whom no acts affect, spared Rukm&iacute;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1536"></A><A HREF="#fn_1536"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; and he (in pursuance of his vow) founded the city Bhojakat&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1537"></A><A HREF="#fn_1537"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and ever afterwards dwelt therein. After the defeat of Rukmin, Krishn&#769;a married Rukmin&iacute; in due form, having first made her his own by the R&aacute;kshasa ritual&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1538"></A><A HREF="#fn_1538"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. She bore him the gallant Pradyumna, a portion of the deity of love. The demon Sambara carried him off, but he slew the demon.</p>
