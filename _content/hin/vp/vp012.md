*The Vishnu Purana*, translated by Horace Hayman Wilson, \[1840\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

8\. The Agni Puráńa

8\. Agni Puráńa. "That Puráńa which describes the occurrences of the
Íśána Kalpa, and was related by Agni to Vaśisht́ha, is called the Ágneya:
it consists of sixteen thousand stanzas <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57)." The Agni or Agneya Puráńa derives its
name from its having being communicated originally by Agni, the deity of
fire, to the Muni Vaśisht́ha, for the purpose of instructing him in the
twofold knowledge of Brahma <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58). By him
it was taught to Vyása, who imparted it to Súta; and the latter is
represented as repeating it to the Rising at Naimishárańya. Its contents
are variously specified as sixteen thousand, fifteen thousand, or
fourteen thousand

<span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span>

stanzas. The two copies which were employed by me contain about fifteen
thousand ślokas. There are two in the Company's library, which do not
extend beyond twelve thousand verses; but they are in many other
respects different from mine: one of them was written at Agra, in the
reign of Akbar, in A. D. 1589.

The Agni Puráńa, in the form in which it has been obtained in Bengal and
at Benares, presents a striking contrast to the Márkańd́eya. It may be
doubted if a single line of it is original. A very great proportion of
it may be traced to other sources; and a more careful collation --if the
task was worth the time it would require--would probably discover the
remainder.

The early chapters of this Puráńa <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59)
describe the Avatáras; and in those of Ráma and Krishńa avowedly follow
the Rámáyańa and Mahábhárata. A considerable portion is then
appropriated to instructions for the performance of religious
ceremonies; many of winch belong to the Tántrika ritual, and are
apparently transcribed from the principal authorities of that system.
Some belong to mystical forms of Śaiva worship, little known in
Hindustan, though perhaps still practised in the south. One of these is
the Díkshá, or initiation of a novice; by which, with numerous
ceremonies and invocations, in which the mysterious monosyllables of the
Tantras are constantly repeated, the disciple is transformed into a
living personation of Śiva, and receives in that capacity the homage of
his Guru. Interspersed with these, are chapters descriptive of the earth
and of the universe, which are the same as those of the Vishńu Puráńa;
and Máhátmyas or legends of holy places, particularly of Gaya. Chapters
on the duties of kings, and on the art of war, then occur, which have
the appearance of being extracted from some older work, as is
undoubtedly the chapter on judicature, which follows them, and which is
the same as the text of the Mitákshara. Subsequent to these, we have an
account of the distribution and arrangement of the Vedas and Puráńas,
which is little else than an abridgment of the

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vishńu: and in a
chapter on gifts we have a description of the Puráńas, which is
precisely the same, and in the same situation, as the similar subject in
the Matsya Puráńa. The genealogical chapters are meagre lists, differing
in a few respects from those commonly received, as hereafter noticed,
but unaccompanied by any particulars, such as those recorded or invented
in the Márkańd́eya. The next subject is medicine, compiled avowedly, but
injudiciously, from the Sauśruta. A series of chapters on the mystic
worship of Śiva and Deví follows; and the work winds up with treatises
on rhetoric, prosody, and grammar, according to the Sutras of Pingala
and Pánini.

The cyclopædical character of the Agni Puráńa, as it is now described,
excludes it from any legitimate claims to be regarded as a Puráńa, and
proves that its origin cannot be very remote. It is subsequent to the
Itihásas; to the chief works on grammar, rhetoric, and medicine; and to
the introduction of the Tántrika worship of Deví. When this latter took
place is yet far from determined, but there is every probability that it
dates long after the beginning of our era. The materials of the Agni,
Puráńa are, however, no doubt of some antiquity. The medicine of Suśruta
is considerably older than the ninth century; and the grammar of Pánini
probably precedes Christianity. The chapters on archery and arms, and on
regal administration, are also distinguished by an entirely Hindu
character, and must have been written long anterior to the Mohammedan
invasion. So far the Agni Puráńa is valuable, as embodying and
preserving relics of antiquity, although compiled at a more' recent
date.

Col. Wilford <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60) has made great use of
a list of kings derived from an appendix to the Agni Puráńa, which
professes to be the sixty-third or last section. As he observes, it is
seldom found annexed to the Puráńa. I have never met with it, and doubt
its ever having formed any part of the original compilation. It would
appear from Col. Wilford's remarks, that this list notices Mohammed as
the institutor of an era; but his account of this is not very distinct.
He mentions explicitly, however, that the list speaks of Sáliváhana and
Vikramáditya; and this is quite

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

sufficient to establish its character. The compilers of the Puráńas were
not such bunglers as to bring within their chronology so well known a
personage as Vikramáditya. There are in all parts of India various
compilations ascribed to the Puráńas, which never formed any portion of
their contents, and which, although offering sometimes useful local
information, and valuable as preserving popular traditions, are not in
justice to be confounded with the Puráńas, so as to cause them to be
charged with even more serious errors and anachronisms than those of
which they are guilty.

The two copies of this work in the library of the East India Company
appropriate the first half to a description of the ordinary and
occasional observances of the Hindus, interspersed with a few legends:
the latter half treats exclusively of the history of Mina.
