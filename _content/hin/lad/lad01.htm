<p><A NAME="page_1"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 1</FONT></A></p>  <h1 align="center">Love and Death</h1>  
<p>IN woodlands of the bright and early world,<br> When love was to himself yet new and warm<br> And stainless, played like morning with a flower<br> Ruru with his young bride Priyumvada.<br> Fresh-cheeked and dew-eyed white Priyumvada<br> Opened her budded heart of crimson bloom<br> To love, to Ruru; Ruru, a happy flood<br> Of passion round a lotus dancing thrilled,<br> Blinded with his soul's waves Priyumvada.<br> To him the earth was a bed for this sole flower,<br> To her all the world was filled with his embrace.<br> Wet with new rains the morning earth, released<br> From her fierce centuries and burning suns,<br> Lavished her breath in greenness; poignant flowers<br> Thronged all her eager breast, and her young arms<br> Cradled a childlike bounding life that played<br> And would not cease, nor ever weary grew<br> Of her bright promise; for all was joy and breeze<br> And perfume, colour and bloom and ardent rays<br> Of living, and delight desired the world.<br> Then Earth was quick and pregnant tamelessly;<br> A free and unwalled race possessed her plains<br> Whose hearts uncramped by bonds, whose unspoiled thoughts<br> At once replied to light. Foisoned <font size="-1" color="green">(sic)</font> the fields;<br> Lonely and rich the forests and the swaying<br> Of those unnumbered tops affected men<br> With thoughts to their vast music kin. Undammed<br> The virgin rivers moved towards the sea,<br> And mountains yet unseen and peoples vague<br> Winged young imagination like an eagle<br> To strange beauty remote. And Ruru felt<br> The sweetness of the early earth as sap<br> All through him, and short life an aeon made <A NAME="page_2"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 2</FONT></A><br> By boundless possibility, and love,<br> Sweetest of all unfathomable love,<br> A glory untired. As a bright bird comes flying<br> From airy extravagance to his own home,<br> And breasts his mate, and feels her all his goal,<br> So from boon sunlight and the fresh chill wave<br> Which swirled and lapped between the slumbering fields,<br> From forest pools and wanderings mid leaves<br> Through emerald ever-new discoveries,<br> Mysterious hillsides ranged and buoyant-swift<br> Races with our wild brothers in the meads,<br> Came Ruru back to the white-bosomed girl,<br> Strong-winged to pleasure. She all fresh and new<br> Rose to him, and he plunged into her charm.<br> For neither to her honey and poignancy<br> Artlessly interchanged, nor any limit<br> To the sweet physical delight of her<br> He found. Her eyes like deep and infinite wells<br> Lured his attracted soul, and her touch thrilled<br> Not lightly, though so light; the joy prolonged<br> And sweetness of the lingering of her lips<br> Was every time a nectar of surprise<br> To her lover; her smooth-gleaming shoulder bared<br> In darkness of her hair showed jasmine-bright,<br> While her kissed bosom by rich tumults stirred<br> Was a moved sea that rocked beneath his heart,<br> Then when her lips had made him blind, soft siege<br> Of all her unseen body to his rule<br> Betrayed the ravishing realm of her white limbs,<br> An empire for the glory of a God.<br> He knew not whether he loved most her smile,<br> Her causeless tears or little angers swift,<br> Whether held wet against him from the bath<br> Among her kindred lotuses, her cheeks<br> Soft to his lips and dangerous happy breasts<br> That vanquished all his strength with their desire,<br> Meeting his absence with her sudden face,<br> Or when the leaf-hid bird at night complained<br> Near their wreathed arbour on the moonlit lake,<br> Sobbing delight out from her heart of bliss, <A NAME="page_3"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 3</FONT></A><br> Or in his clasp of rapture laughing low<br> Of his close bosom bridal-glad and pleased<br> With passion and this fiery play of love,<br> Or breaking off like one who thinks of grief,<br> Wonderful melancholy in her eyes<br> Grown liquid and with wayward sorrow large,<br> Thus he in her found a warm world of sweets,<br> And lived of ecstasy secure, nor deemed<br> Any new hour could match that early bliss.<br> But Love has joys for spirits born divine<br> More bleeding-lovely than his thornless rose.<br> That day he had left, while yet the east was dark,<br> Rising, her bosom and into the river<br> Swam out, exulting in the sting and swift<br> Sharp-edged desire around his limbs, and sprang<br> Wet to the bank, and streamed into the wood.<br> As a young horse upon the pastures glad<br> Feels greensward and the wind along his mane<br> And arches as he goes his neck, so went<br> In an immense delight of youth the boy<br> And shook his locks, joy-crested. Boundlessly<br> He revelled in swift air of life, a creature<br> Of wide and vigorous morning. Far he strayed<br> Tempting for flower and fruit branches in heaven,<br> And plucked, and flung away, and brighter chose,<br> Seeking comparisons for her bloom; and followed<br> New streams, and touched new trees, and felt slow beauty<br> And leafy secret change; for the damp leaves,<br> Grey-green at first, grew pallid with the light<br> And warmed with consciousness of sunshine near;<br> Then the whole daylight wandered in, and made<br> Hard tracts of splendour, and enriched all hues.<br> But when a happy sheltered heat he felt<br> And heard contented voice of living things<br> Harmonious with the noon, he turned and swiftly<br> Went homeward yearning to Priyumvada,<br> And near his home emerging from green leaves<br> He laughed towards the sun: "O father Sun,"<br> He cried, "how good it is to live, to love!<br> Surely our joy shall never end, nor we <A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A><br> Grow old, but like bright rivers or pure winds<br> Sweetly continue, or revive with flowers,<br> Or live at least as long as senseless trees."<br> He dreamed, and said with a soft smile: "Lo, she!<br> And she will turn from me with angry tears<br> Her delicate face more beautiful than storm<br> Or rainy moonlight. I will follow her,<br> And soothe her heart with sovereign flatteries;<br> Or rather all tyranny exhaust and taste<br> The beauty of her anger like a fruit,<br> Vexing her soul with helplessness; then soften<br> Easily with quiet undenied demand<br> Of heart insisting upon heart; or else<br> Will reinvest her beauty bright with flowers,<br> Or with my hands her little feet persuade.<br> Then will her face be like a sudden dawn,<br> And flower compelled into reluctant smiles."<br> He had not ceased when he beheld her. She,<br> Tearing a jasmine bloom with waiting hands,<br> Stood drooping, petulant, but heard at once<br> His footsteps and before she was aware,<br> A sudden smile of exquisite delight<br> Leaped to her mouth, and a great blush of joy<br> Surprised her cheeks. She for a moment stood<br> Beautiful with her love before she died;<br> And he laughed towards her. With a pitiful cry<br> She paled; moaning, her stricken limbs collapsed.<br> But petrified, in awful dumb surprise,<br> He gazed; then waking with a bound was by her,<br> All panic expectation. As he came,<br> He saw a brilliant flash of coils evade<br> The sunlight, and with hateful gorgeous hood<br> Darted into green safety, hissing, death.<br> Voiceless he sank beside her and stretched out<br> His arms and desperately touched her face,<br> As if to attract her soul to live, and sought<br> Beseeching with his hands her bosom. O, she<br> Was warm, and cruel hope pierced him; but pale<br> As jasmines fading on a girl's sweet breast<br> Her cheek was, and forgot its perfect rose. <A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A><br> Her eyes that clung to sunlight yet, with pain<br> Were large and feebly round his neck her arms<br> She lifted and, desiring his pale cheek<br> Against her bosom, sobbed out piteously,<br> "Ah, love!" and stopped heart-broken; then, "O Love!<br> Alas the green dear home that I must leave<br> So early! I was so glad of love and kisses,<br> And thought that centuries would not exhaust<br> The deep embrace. And I have had so little<br> Of joy and the wild day and throbbing night,<br> Laughter, and tenderness, and strife and tears.<br> I have not numbered half the brilliant birds<br> In one green forest, nor am familiar grown<br> With sunrise and the progress of the eves,<br> Nor have with plaintive cries of birds made friends,<br> Cuckoo and rainlark and love-speak-to-me.<br> I have not learned the names of half the flowers<br> Around me; so few trees know me by my name;<br> Nor have I seen the stars so very often<br> That I should die. I feel a dreadful hand<br> Drawing me from the touch of thy warm limbs<br> Into some cold vague mist, and all black night<br> Descends towards me. I no more am thine,<br> But go I know not where, and see pale shapes<br> And gloomy countries and that terrible stream.<br> O Love, O Love, they take me from thee far,<br> And whether we shall find each other ever<br> In the wide dreadful territory of death,<br> I know not. Or thou wilt forget me quite,<br> And life compel thee into other arms.<br> Ah, come with me! I cannot bear to wander<br> In that cold cruel country all alone,<br> Helpless and terrified, or sob by streams<br> Denied sweet sunlight and by thee unloved."<br> Slower her voice came now, and over her cheek<br> Death paused; then, sobbing like a little child<br> Too early from her bounding pleasures called,<br> The lovely discontented spirit stole<br> From her warm body white. Over her leaned<br> Ruru, and waited for dead lips to move. <A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A><br> Still in the greenwood lay Priyumvada,<br> And Ruru rose not from her, but with eyes<br> Emptied of glory hung above his dead,<br> Only, without a word, without a tear.<br> Then the crowned wives of the great forest came,<br> They who had fed her from maternal breasts,<br> And grieved over the lovely body cold,<br> And bore it from him; nor did he entreat<br> One last look nor one kiss, nor yet denied<br> What he had loved so well. They the dead girl<br> Into some distant greenness bore away.</p>  
<p>But Ruru, while the stillness of the place<br> Remembered her, sat without voice. He heard<br> Through the great silence that was now his soul,<br> The forest sounds, a squirrel's leap through leaves,<br> The cheeping of a bird just overhead,<br> A peacock with his melancholy cry<br> Complaining far away, and tossings dim<br> And slight unnoticeable stir of trees.<br> But all these were to him like distant things<br> And he alone in his heart's void. And yet<br> No thought he had of her so lately lost,<br> Rather far pictures, trivial incidents<br> Of that old life before her delicate face<br> Had lived for him, dumbly distinct like thoughts<br> Of men that die, kept with long pomps his mind<br> Excluding the dead girl. So still he was,<br> The birds flashed by him with their swift small wings,<br> Fanning him. Then he moved, then rigorous<br> Memory through all his body shuddering<br> Awoke, and he looked up and knew the place,<br> And recognised greenness immutable,<br> And saw old trees and the same flowers still bloom.<br> He felt the bright indifference of earth<br> And all the lonely uselessness of pain.<br> Then lifting up the beauty of his brow<br> He spoke, with sorrow pale: "O grim cold Death!<br> But I will not like ordinary men<br> Satiate thee with cries, and falsely woo thee, <A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A><br> And make my grief thy theatre, who lie<br> Prostrate beneath thy thunderbolts and make<br> Night witness of their moans, shuddering and crying<br> When sudden memories pierce them like swords,<br> And often starting up as at a thought<br> Intolerable, pace a little, then<br> Sink down exhausted by brief agony.<br> O secrecy terrific, darkness vast,<br> At which we shudder! Somewhere, I know not where,<br> Somehow, I know not how, I shall confront<br> Thy gloom, tremendous spirit, and seize with hands<br> And prove what thou art and what man." He said,<br> And slowly to the forests wandered. There<br> Long months he travelled between grief and grief,<br> Reliving thoughts of her with every pace,<br> Measuring vast pain in his immortal mind.<br> And his heart cried in him as when a fire<br> Roars through wide forests and the branches cry<br> Burning towards heaven in torture glorious.<br> So burned, immense, his grief within him; he raised<br> His young pure face all solemnised with pain,<br> Voiceless. Then Fate was shaken, and the Gods<br> Grieved for him, of his silence grown afraid.<br> Therefore from peaks divine came flashing down<br> Immortal Agni and to the Uswuttha-tree<br> Cried in the Voice that slays the world: "O tree<br> That liftest thy enormous branches able<br> To shelter armies, more than armies now<br> Shelter, be famous, house a brilliant God.<br> For the grief grows in Ruru's breast up-piled,<br> As wrestles with its anguished barricades<br> In silence an impending flood, and Gods<br> Immortal grow afraid. For earth alarmed<br> Shudders to bear the curse lest her young life<br> Pale with eclipse and all-creating love<br> Be to mere pain condemned. Divert the wrath<br> Into thy boughs, Uswuttha&#8212;thou shalt be<br> My throne&#8212;glorious, though in eternal pain,<br> Yet worth much pain to harbour divine fire."<br> So ended the young pure destroyer's voice, <A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A><br> And the dumb god consented silently.<br> In the same noon came Ruru; his mind had paused,<br> Lured for a moment by soft wandering gleams<br> Into forgetfulness of pain; for thoughts<br> Gentle and near-eyed whispering memories<br> So sweetly came, his blind heart dreamed she lived.<br> Slow the Uswuttha-tree bent down its leaves,<br> And smote his cheek, and touched his heavy hair.<br> And Ruru turned illumined. For a moment,<br> One blissful moment he had felt 'twas she.<br> So had she often stolen up and touched<br> His curls with her enamoured fingers small,<br> Lingering, while the wind smote him with her hair<br> And her quick breath came to him like spring. Then he,<br> Turning, as one surprised with heaven, saw<br> Ready to his swift passionate grasp her bosom<br> And body sweet expecting his embrace.<br> Oh, now saw her not, but the guilty tree<br> Shrinking; then grief back with a double crown<br> Arose and stained his face with agony.<br> Nor silence he endured, but the dumb force<br> Ascetic and inherited, by sires<br> Fierce-musing earned, from the boy's bosom blazed.<br> "O Uswuttha-tree, wantonly who hast mocked<br> My anguish with the wind, but thou no more<br> Have joy of the cool wind nor green delight,<br> But live thy guilty leaves in fire, so long<br> As Aryan wheels by thy doomed shadow vast<br> Thunder to war, nor bless with cool wide waves<br> Lyric Saruswathi nations impure."<br> He spoke, and the vast tree groaned through its leaves,<br> Recognising its fate; then smouldered; lines<br> Of living fire rushed up the girth and hissed<br> Serpentine in the unconsuming leaves;<br> Last, all Hutashan in his chariot armed<br> Sprang on the boughs and blazed into the sky,<br> And wailing all the great tormented creature<br> Stood wide in agony; one half was green<br> And earthly, the other a weird brilliance<br> Filled with the speed and cry of endless flame. <A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A><br> But he, with the fierce rushing-out of power<br> Shaken and that strong grasp of anguish, flung<br> His hands out to the sun; "Priyumvada!"<br> He cried, and at that well-loved sound there dawned<br> With overwhelming sweetness miserable<br> Upon his mind the old delightful times<br> When he had called her by her liquid name,<br> Where the voice loved to linger. He remembered<br> The chompuc bushes where she turned away<br> Half-angered, and his speaking of her name<br> Masterfully as to a lovely slave<br> Rebellious who has erred; at that the slow<br> Yielding of her small head, and after a little<br> Her sliding towards him and beautiful<br> Propitiating body as she sank down<br> With timid graspings deprecatingly<br> In prostrate warm surrender, her flushed cheeks<br> Upon his feet and little touches soft;<br> Or her long name uttered beseechingly,<br> And the swift leap of all her body to him,<br> And eyes of large repentance, and the weight<br> Of her wild bosom and lips unsatisfied;<br> Or hourly call for little trivial needs,<br> Or sweet unneeded wanton summoning,<br> Daily appeal that never staled nor lost<br> Its sudden music, and her lovely speed,<br> Sedulous occupation left, quick-breathing,<br> With great glad eyes and eager parted lips;<br> Or in deep quiet moments murmuring<br> That name like a religion in her ear,<br> And her calm look compelled to ecstasy;<br> Or to the river luring her, or breathed<br> Over her dainty slumber, or secret sweet<br> Bridal outpantings of her broken name.<br> All these as rush unintermitting waves<br> Upon a swimmer overborne, broke on him<br> Relentless, things too happy to be endured,<br> Till faint with the recalled felicity<br> Low he moaned out: "O pale Priyumvada!<br> O dead fair flower! yet living to my grief! <A NAME="page_10"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 10</FONT></A><br> But I could only slay the innocent tree,<br> Powerless when power should have been. Not such<br> Was Bhrigu from whose sacred strength I spring,<br> Nor Bhrigu's son, my father, when he blazed<br> Out from Puloma's side, and burning, blind,<br> Fell like a tree the ravisher unjust. <br> But I degenerate from such sires. O Death<br> That showest not thy face beneath the stars,<br> But comest masked, and on our dear ones seizing<br> Fearest to wrestle equally with love!<br> Nor from thy gloomy house any come back<br> To tell thy way. But O, if any strength<br> In lover's constancy to torture dwell<br> Earthward to force a helping god and such<br> Ascetic force be born of lover's pain,<br> Let my dumb pangs be heard. Whoe&#8217;er thou art,<br> O thou bright enemy of Death descend<br> And lead me to that portal dim. For I <br> Have burned in fires cruel as the fire<br> And lain upon a sharper couch than swords."<br> He ceased, and heaven thrilled, and the far blue<br> Quivered as with invisible downward wings.</p>  
<p>But Ruru passioned on, and came with eve<br> To secret grass and a green opening moist<br> In a cool lustre. Leaned upon a tree<br> That bathed in faery air and saw the sky<br> Through branches, and a single parrot loud<br> Screamed from its top, there stood a golden boy,<br> Half-naked, with bright limbs all beautiful&#8212;<br> Delicate they were, in sweetness absolute:<br> For every gleam and every soft strong curve<br> Magically compelled the eye, and smote<br> The heart to weakness. In his hands he swung<br> A bow&#8212;not such as human archers use:<br> For the string moved and murmured like many bees,<br> And nameless fragrance made the casual air<br> A peril. He on Ruru that fair face<br> Turned, and his steps with lovely gesture chained.<br> "Who art thou here, in forests wandering,<A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A><br> And thy young exquisite face is solemnised<br> With pain? Luxuriously the Gods have tortured<br> Thy heart to see such dreadful glorious beauty<br> Agonize in thy lips and brilliant eyes:<br> As tyrants in the fierceness of others' pangs<br> Joy and feel strong, clothing with brilliant fire,<br> Tyrants in Titan lands. Needs must her mouth<br> Have been pure honey and her bosom a charm,<br> Whom thou desirest seeing not the green<br> And common lovely sounds hast quite forgot."<br> And Ruru, mastered by the God, replied:<br> "I know thee by thy cruel beauty bright,<br> Kama, who makest many worlds one fire.<br> Ah, wherefore wilt thou ask of her to increase<br> The passion and regret? Thou knowest, great love!<br> Thy nymph her mother, if thou truly art he<br> And not a dream of my disastrous soul."<br> But with the thrilled eternal smile that makes<br> The spring, the lover of Rathi golden-limbed<br> Replied to Ruru, "Mortal, I am he;<br> I am that Madan who inform the stars<br> With lustre and on life's wide canvas fill<br> Pictures of light and shade, of joy and tears,<br> Make ordinary moments wonderful<br> And common speech a charm: knit life to life<br> With interfusions of opposing souls<br> And sudden meetings and slow sorceries:<br> Wing the boy bridegroom to that panting breast,<br> Smite Gods with mortal faces, dreadfully<br> Among great beautiful kings and watched by eyes<br> That burn, force on the virgin's fainting limbs<br> And drive her to the one face never seen,<br> The one breast meant eternally for her.<br> By me come wedded sweets, by me the wife's<br> Busy delight and passionate obedience,<br> And loving eager service never sated,<br> And happy lips, and worshipping soft eyes:<br> And mine the husband's hungry arms and use<br> Unwearying of old tender words and ways,<br> Joy of her hair, and silent pleasure felt <A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A><br> Of nearness to one dear familiar shape.<br> Nor only these, but many affections bright<br> And soft glad things cluster around my name.<br> I plant fraternal tender yearnings, make<br> The sister's sweet attractiveness and leap<br> Of heart towards imperious kindred blood,<br> And the young mother's passionate deep look,<br> Earth's high similitude of One not earth,<br> Teach filial heart-beats strong. These are my gifts<br> For which men praise me, these my glories calm:<br> But fiercer shafts I can, wild storms blown down<br> Shaking fixed minds and melting marble natures,<br> Tears and dumb bitterness and pain unpitied,<br> Racked thirsting jealousy and kind hearts made stone:<br> And in undisciplined huge souls I sow<br> Dire vengeance and impossible cruelties,<br> Cold lusts that linger and fierce fickleness,<br> The loves close kin to hate, brute violence<br> And mad insatiable longings pale,<br> And passion blind as death and deaf as swords.<br> O mortal, all deep-souled desires and all<br> Yearnings immense are mine, so much I can."<br> So as he spoke, his face grew wonderful<br> With vast suggestion, his human-seeming limbs<br> Brightened with a soft splendour: luminous hints<br> Of the concealed divinity transpired.<br> But soon with a slight discontented frown:<br> "So much I can, as even the great Gods learn.<br> Only with death I wrestle in vain, until<br> My passionate godhead all becomes a doubt.<br> Mortal, I am the light in stars, of flowers<br> The bloom, the nameless fragrance that pervades<br> Creation: but behind me, older than me,<br> He comes with night and cold tremendous shade.<br> Hard is the way to him, most hard to find,<br> Harder to tread, for perishable feet<br> Almost impossible. Yet, O fair youth,<br> If thou must needs go down, and thou art strong<br> In passion and in constancy, nor easy<br> The soul to slay that has survived such grief <A NAME="page_13"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 13</FONT></A><br> Steel then thyself to venture, armed by Love.<br> Yet listen first what heavy trade they drive<br> Who would win back their dead to human arms."<br> So much the God; but swift, with eager eyes<br> And panting bosom and glorious flushed face,<br> The lover: "O great Love! O beautiful Love!<br> But if by strength is possible, of body<br> Or mind, battle or spirit or moving speech,<br> Sweet speech that makes even cruelty grow kind,<br> Or yearning melody&#8212;for I have heard<br> That when Saruswathi in heaven her harp<br> Has smitten, the cruel sweetness terrible<br> Coils taking no denial through the soul,<br> And tears burst from the hearts of Gods&#8212;then I,<br> Making great music, or with perfect words,<br> Will strive, or staying him with desperate hands<br> Match human strength &#8217;gainst formidable Death.<br> But if with price, ah God! what easier! Tears<br> Dreadful, innumerable I will absolve,<br> Or pay with anguish through the centuries,<br> Soul's agony and torture physical,<br> So her small hands about my face at last<br> I feel, close real hair sting me with life,<br> And palpable breathing bosom on me press."<br> Then with a lenient smile the mighty God:<br> "O ignorant fond lover, not with tears<br> Shalt thou persuade immitigable Death.<br> He will not pity all thy pangs: nor know<br> His stony eyes with music to grow kind,<br> Nor lovely words accepts. And how wilt thou<br> Wrestle with that grim shadow, who canst not save<br> One bloom from fading? A sole thing the Gods<br> Demand from all men living, sacrifice:<br> Nor without this shall any crown be grasped.<br> Yet many sacrifices are there, oxen,<br> And prayers, and Soma wine, and pious flowers,<br> Blood and the fierce expense of mind, and pure<br> Incense of perfect actions, perfect thoughts,<br> Or liberality wide as the sun's,<br> Or ruthless labour or disastrous tears,<A NAME="page_14"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 14</FONT></A><br> Exile or death or pain more hard than death,<br> Absence, a desert, from the faces loved;<br> Even sin may be a sumptuous sacrifice<br> Acceptable for unholy fruits. But none<br> Of these the inexorable shadow asks:<br> Alone of gods Death loves not gifts: he visits<br> The pure heart as the stained. Lo, the just man<br> Bowed helpless over his dead, nor all his virtues<br> Shall quicken that cold bosom: near him the wild<br> Marred face and passionate and will not leave<br> Kissing dead lips that shall not chide him more.<br> Life the pale ghost requires: with half thy life<br> Thou mayst protract the thread too early cut<br> Of that delightful spirit&#8212;half sweet life.<br> O Ruru, lo, thy frail precarious days,<br> And yet how sweet they are! simply to breathe<br> How warm and sweet! And ordinary things<br> How exquisite, thou then shalt learn when lost,<br> How luminous the daylight was, mere sleep<br> How soft and friendly clasping tired limbs,<br> And the deliciousness of common food.<br> And things indifferent thou then shalt want,<br> Regret rejected beauty, brightnesses<br> Bestowed in vain. Wilt thou yield up, O lover,<br> Half thy sweet portion of this light and gladness,<br> Thy little insufficient share, and vainly<br> Give to another? She is not thyself:<br> Thou dost not feel the gladness in her bosom,<br> Nor with the torture of thy body will she<br> Throb and cry out: at most with tender looks<br> And pitiful attempt to feel move near thee,<br> And weep how far she is from what she loves.<br> Men live like stars that see each other in heaven,<br> But one knows not the pleasure and the grief<br> The others feel: he lonely rapture has,<br> Or bears his incommunicable pain.<br> O Ruru, there are many beautiful faces,<br> But one thyself. Think then how thou shalt mourn<br> When thou hast shortened joy and feelst at last<br> The shadow that thou hadst for such sweet store." <A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A><br> He ceased with a strange doubtful look. But swift<br> Came back the lover's voice, like passionate rain.<br> "O idle words! For what is mere sunlight?<br> Who would live on into extreme old age,<br> Burden the impatient world, a weary old man,<br> And look back on a selfish time ill-spent<br> Exacting out of prodigal great life<br> Small separate pleasures like an usurer,<br> And no rich sacrifice and no large act<br> Finding oneself in others, nor the sweet<br> Expense of Nature in her passionate gusts<br> Of love and giving, first of the soul's needs?<br> Who is so coldly wise, and does not feel<br> How wasted were our grandiose human days<br> In prudent personal unshared delights?<br> Why dost thou mock me, friend of all the stars?<br> How canst thou be love's god and know not this,<br> That love burns down the body's barriers cold<br> And laughs at difference&#8212;playing with it merely<br> To make joy sweeter? O too deeply I know,<br> The lover is not different from the loved,<br> Nor is their silence dumb to each other. He<br> Contains her heart and feels her body in his,<br> He flushes with her heat, chills with her cold.<br> And when she dies, oh! when she dies, oh me,<br> The emptiness, the maim! the life no life,<br> The sweet and passionate oneness lost! And if<br> By shortening of great grief won back, O price<br> Easy! O glad briefness, aeons may envy!<br> For we shall live not fearing death, nor feel<br> As others yearning over the loved at night<br> When the lamp flickers, sudden chills of dread<br> Terrible; nor at short absence agonise,<br> Wrestling with mad imagination. Us<br> Serenely when the darkening shadow comes,<br> One common sob shall end and soul clasp soul,<br> Leaving the body in a long dim kiss.<br> Then in the joys of heaven we shall consort,<br> Amid the gladness often touching hands<br> To make bliss sure; or in the ghastly stream <A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A><br> If we must anguish, yet it shall not part<br> Our passionate limbs inextricably locked<br> By one strong agony, but we shall feel<br> Hell's pain half joy through sweet companionship.<br> God Love, I weary of words. O wing me rather<br> To her, my eloquent princess of the spring,<br> In whatsoever wintry shores she roam."<br> He ceased with eager forward eyes; once more<br> A light of beauty immortal through the limbs<br> Gleaming of the boy-god and soft sweet face,<br> Glorifying him, flushed, and he replied:<br> "Go then, O thou dear youth, and bear this flower<br> In thy hand warily. For thou shalt come<br> To that high meeting of the Ganges pure<br> With vague and violent Ocean. There arise<br> And loudly appeal my brother, the wild sea."<br> He spoke and stretched out his immortal hand,<br> And Ruru's met it. All his young limbs yearned<br> With dreadful rapture shuddering through them. He<br> Felt in his fingers subtle uncertain bloom,<br> A quivering magnificence, half fire,<br> Whose petals changed like flame, and from them breathed<br> Dangerous attraction and alarmed delight,<br> As at a peril near. He raised his eyes,<br> But the green place was empty of the God.<br> Only the faery tree looked up at heaven<br> Through branches, and with recent pleasure shook.<br> Then over fading earth the night was lord.</p>  
<p>But from Shatudru and Bipasha, streams<br> Once holy, and loved Iravathi and swift<br> Clear Chandrabhaga and Bitosta's toil<br> For man, went Ruru to bright sumptuous lands<br> By Aryan fathers not yet paced, but wild,<br> But virgin to our fruitful human toil,<br> Where nature lay reclined in dumb delight<br> Alone with woodlands and the voiceless hills.<br> He with the widening yellow Ganges came,<br> Amazed, to trackless countries where few tribes,<br> Kirath and Poundrian, warred, worshipping trees <A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A><br> And the great serpent. But robust wild earth,<br> But forests with their splendid life of beasts<br> Savage mastered those strong inhabitants.<br> Thither came Ruru. In a thin soft eve<br> Ganges spread far her multitudinous waves,<br> A glimmering restlessness with voices large,<br> And from the forests of that half-seen bank<br> A boat came heaving over it, white-winged,<br> With a sole silent helmsman marble-pale.<br> Then Ruru by his side stepped in; they went<br> Down the mysterious river and beheld<br> The great banks widen out of sight. The world<br> Was water and the skies to water plunged.<br> All night with a dim motion gliding down<br> He felt the dark against his eyelids; felt,<br> As in a dream more real than daylight,<br> The helmsman with his dumb and marble face<br> Near him and moving wideness all around,<br> And that continual gliding dimly on,<br> As one who on a shoreless water sails<br> For ever to a port he shall not win.<br> But when the darkness paled, he heard a moan<br> Of mightier waves and had the wide great sense<br> Of ocean and the depths below our feet.<br> But the boat stopped; the pilot lifted on him<br> His marble gaze cheval with the stars.<br> Then in the white-winged boat the boy arose<br> And saw around him the vast sea all grey<br> And heaving in the pallid dawning light.<br> Loud Ruru cried across the murmur: "Hear me,<br> O inarticulate grey Ocean, hear.<br> If any cadence in thy infinite<br> Rumour was caught from lover's moan, O Sea,<br> Open thy abysses to my mortal tread.<br> For I would travel to the despairing shades,<br> The spheres of suffering where entangled dwell<br> Souls unreleased and the untimely dead<br> Who weep remembering. Thither, O guide me,<br> No despicable wayfarer, but Ruru,<br> But son of a great Rishi, from all men <A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A><br> On earth selected for peculiar pangs,<br> Special disaster. Lo, this petalled fire,<br> How freshly it blooms and lasts with my great pain!"<br> He held the flower out subtly glimmering.<br> And like a living thing the huge sea trembled,<br> Then rose, calling, and filled the sight with eaves,<br> Converging all its giant crests; towards him<br> Innumerable waters loomed and heaven<br> Threatened. Horizon on horizon moved<br> Dreadfully swift; then with a prone wide sound<br> All Ocean hollowing drew him swiftly in,<br> Curving with monstrous menace over him.<br> He down the gulf where the loud waves collapsed<br> Descending, saw with floating hair arise<br> The daughters of the sea in pale green light,<br> A million mystic breasts suddenly bare,<br> And came beneath the flood and stunned beheld<br> A mute stupendous march of waters race<br> To reach some viewless pit beneath the world.<br> Ganges he saw, as men predestined rush<br> Upon a fearful doom foreseen, so ran,<br> Alarmed, with anguished speed, the river vast.<br> Veiled to his eyes the triple goddess rose.<br> She with a sound of water cried to him,<br> A thousand voices moaning with one pain:<br> "Lover, who fearedst not sunlight to leave,<br> With me thou mayst behold that helpless spirit<br> Lost in the gloom, if still thy burning bosom<br> Have courage to endure great Nature's night<br> In the dire lands where I, a goddess, mourn<br> Hurting my heart with my own cruelty."<br> She darkened to the ominous descent,<br> Unwilling, and her once so human waves<br> Sent forth a cry not meant for living ears.<br> And Ruru chilled; but terrible strong love<br> Was like a fiery finger in his breast<br> Pointing him on; so he through horror went<br> Conducted by inexorable sound.<br> For monstrous voices to his ear were close,<br> And bodiless terrors with their dimness seized him <A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A><br> In an obscurity phantasmal. Thus<br> With agony of soul to the grey waste<br> He came, glad of the pain of passage over,<br> As men who through the storms of anguish strive<br> Into abiding tranquil dreariness<br> And draw sad breath assured; to the grey waste,<br> Hopeless Patal, the immutable<br> Country, where neither sun nor rain arrives,<br> Nor happy labour of the human plough<br> Fruitfully turns the soil, but in vague sands<br> And indeterminable strange rocks and caverns<br> That into silent blackness huge recede,<br> Dwell the great serpent and his hosts, writhed forms,<br> Sinuous, abhorred, through many horrible leagues<br> Coiling in a half darkness. Shapes he saw,<br> And heard the hiss and knew the lambent light<br> Loathsome, but passed compelling his strong soul.<br> At last through those six tired hopeless worlds,<br> Too hopeless far for grief, pale he arrived<br> Into a nether air by anguish moved,<br> And heard before him cries that pierced the heart,<br> Human, not to be borne, and issued shaken<br> By the great river accursed. Maddened it ran,<br> Anguished, importunate, and in its waves<br> The drifting ghosts their agony endured.<br> There Ruru saw pale faces float of kings<br> And grandiose victors and revered high priests<br> And famous women. Now rose from the wave<br> A golden shuddering arm and now a face.<br> Torn piteous sides were seen and breasts that quailed.<br> Over them moaned the penal waters on,<br> And had no joy of their fierce cruelty.<br> Then Ruru, his young cheeks with pity wan,<br> Half moaned: "O miserable race of men,<br> With violent and passionate souls you come<br> Foredoomed upon the earth and live brief days<br> In fear and anguish, catching at stray beams<br> Of sunlight, little fragrances of flowers,<br> Then from your spacious earth in a great horror<br> Descend into this night, and here too soon <A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A><br> Must expiate your few inadequate joys.<br> O bargain hard! Death helps us not. He leads<br> Alarmed, all shivering from his chill embrace,<br> The naked spirit here. Oh my sweet flower,<br> Art thou too whelmed in this fierce wailing flood?<br> Ah me! But I will haste and deeply plunge<br> Into its hopeless pools and either bring<br> Thy old warm beauty back beneath the stars,<br> Or find thee out and clasp thy tortured bosom<br> And kiss thy sweet wrung lips and hush thy cries.<br> Love shall draw half thy pain into my limbs;<br> Then we shall triumph glad of agony."<br> He ceased and one replied close by his ear:<br> "O thou who troublest with thy living eyes<br> Established death, pass on. She whom thou seekest<br> Rolls not in the accurs&egrave;d tide. For late<br> I saw her mid those pale inhabitants<br> Whom bodily anguish visits not, but thoughts<br> Sorrowful and dumb memories absolve,<br> And martyrdom of scourged hearts quivering."<br> He turned and saw astride the dolorous flood<br> A mighty bridge paved with mosaic fire,<br> All restless, and a woman clothed in flame,<br> With hands calamitous that held a sword,<br> Stood of the quaking passage sentinel.<br> Magnificent and dire her burning face.<br> "Pass on," she said once more, "O Bhrigu's son;<br> The flower protects thee from my hands." She stretched<br> One arm towards him and with violence<br> Majestic over the horrid arch compelled.<br> Unhurt, though shaking from her touch, alone<br> He stood upon an inner bank with strange<br> Black dreary mosses covered and perceived<br> A dim and level plain without one flower.<br> Over it paced a multitude immense<br> With gentle faces occupied by pain;<br> Strong men were there and grieving mothers, girls<br> With early beauty in their limbs and young<br> Sad children of their childlike faces robbed.<br> Naked they paced with falling hair and gaze <A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A><br> Drooping upon their bosoms, weak as flowers<br> That die for want of rain unmurmuring.<br> Always a silence was upon the place.<br> But Ruru came among them. Suddenly<br> One felt him there and looked, then as a wind<br> Moves over a still field of patient corn,<br> And the ears stir and shudder and look up<br> And bend innumerably flowing, so<br> All those dumb spirits stirred and through them passed<br> One shuddering motion of raised faces; then<br> They streamed towards him without sound and caught<br> With desperate hands his robe or touched his hair<br> Or strove to feel upon them living breath.<br> Pale girls and quiet children came and knelt<br> And with large sorrowful eyes into his looked.<br> Yet with their silent passion the cold hush<br> Moved not; but Ruru's human heart half burst<br> With burden of so many sorrows; tears<br> Welled from him; he with anguish understood<br> That terrible and wordless sympathy<br> Of dead souls for the living. Then he turned<br> His eyes and scanned their lovely faces strange<br> For that one face and found it not. He paled,<br> And spoke vain words into the listless air:<br> "O spirits once joyous, miserable race,<br> Happier if the old gladness were forgot!<br> My soul yearns with your sorrow. Yet ah! reveal<br> If dwell my love in your sad nation lost.<br> Well may you know her, O wan beautiful spirits!<br> But she most beautiful of all that died,<br> By sweetness recognisable. Her name<br> The sunshine knew." Speaking his tears made way:<br> But they with dumb lips only looked at him,<br> A vague and empty mourning in their eyes.<br> He murmured low: "Ah, folly! were she here,<br> Would she not first have felt me, first have raised<br> Her lids and run to me, leaned back her face<br> Of silent sorrow on my breast and looked<br> With the old altered eyes into my own<br> And striven to make my anguish understand? <A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A><br> Oh joy, had she been here! for though her lips<br> Of their old excellent music quite were robbed,<br> Yet her dumb passion would have spoken to me;<br> We should have understood each other and walked<br> Silently hand in hand, almost content."<br> He said and passed through those untimely dead.<br> Speechless they followed him with clinging eyes.<br> Then to a solemn building weird he came<br> With grave colossal pillars round. One dome<br> Roofed the whole brooding edifice, like cloud,<br> And at the door strange shapes were pacing, armed.<br> Then from their fear the sweet and mournful dead<br> Drew back, returning to their wordless grief.<br> But Ruru to the perilous doorway strode,<br> And those disastrous shapes upon him raised<br> Their bows and aimed; but he held out Love's flower,<br> And with stern faces checked they let him pass.<br> He entered and beheld a silent hall<br> Dim and unbounded; moving then like one<br> Who up a dismal stair seeks ever light,<br> Attained a dais brilliant doubtfully<br> With flaming pediment and round it coiled<br> Python and Naga monstrous, Joruthcaru,<br> Tuxuc and Vasuki himself, immense,<br> Magic Carcotaca all flecked with fire;<br> And many other prone destroying shapes<br> Coiled. On the wondrous dais rose a throne,<br> And he its pedestal whose lotus hood<br> With ominous beauty crowns his horrible<br> Sleek folds, great Mahapudma; high displayed<br> He bears the throne of Death. There sat supreme<br> With those compassionate and lethal eyes,<br> Who many names, who many natures holds;<br> Yama, the strong pure Hades sad and subtle,<br> Dharma, who keeps the laws of old untouched,<br> Critanta, who ends all things and at last<br> Himself shall end. On either side of him<br> The four-eyed dogs mysterious rested prone,<br> Watchful, with huge heads on their paws advanced;<br> And emanations of the godhead dim <A NAME="page_23"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 23</FONT></A><br> Moved near him, shadowy or serpentine,<br> Vast Time and cold irreparable Death.<br> Then Ruru came and bowed before the throne;<br> And swaying all those figures stirred as shapes<br> Upon a tapestry moved by the wind,<br> And the sad voice was heard: "What breathing man<br> Bows at the throne of Hades? By what force,<br> Spiritual or communicated, troubles<br> His living beauty the dead grace of Hell?"<br> And one replied who seemed a neighbouring voice:<br> "He has the blood of Gods and Titans old.<br> An Apsara his mother liquid-orbed<br> Bore to the youthful Chyavan's strong embrace<br> This passionate face of earth with Eden touched.<br> Chyavan was Bhrigu's child, Puloma bore,<br> The Titaness,&#8212;Bhrigu, great Brahma's son.<br> Love gave the flower that helps by anguish; therefore<br> He chilled not with the breath of Hades, nor<br> The cry of the infernal stream made stone."<br> But at the name of Love all hell was moved.<br> Death's throne half faded into twilight; hissed<br> The phantoms serpentine as if in pain,<br> And the dogs raised their dreadful heads. Then spoke<br> Yama: "And what needs Love in this pale realm,<br> The warm great Love? All worlds his breath confounds,<br> Mars solemn order and old steadfastness.<br> But not in hell his legates come and go;<br> His vernal jurisdiction to bare Hell<br> Extends not. This last world resists his power<br> Youthful, anarchic. Here will he enlarge<br> Tumult and wanton joys?" The voice replied:<br> "Menaca momentary on the earth,<br> Heaven's Apsara by the fleeting hours beguiled<br> Played in the happy hidden glens; there bowed<br> To yoke of swift terrestrial joys she bore,<br> Immortal, to that fair Gundhurva king<br> A mortal blossom of delight. That bloom<br> Young Ruru found and plucked, but her too soon<br> Thy fatal hooded snake on earth surprised,<br> And he through gloom now travels armed by Love." <A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A><br> But then all Hades swaying towards him cried:<br> "O mortal, O misled! But sacrifice<br> Is stronger, nor may law of Hell or Heaven<br> Its fierce effectual action supersede.<br> Thy dead I yield. Yet thou bethink thee, mortal,<br> Not as a tedious evil nor to be<br> Lightly rejected gave the gods old age,<br> But tranquil, but august, but making easy<br> The steep ascent to God. Therefore must Time<br> Still batter down the glory and form of youth<br> And animal magnificent strong ease,<br> To warn the earthward man that he is spirit<br> Dallying with transience, nor by death he ends,<br> Nor to the dumb warm mother's arms is bound,<br> But called unborn into the unborn skies.<br> For body fades with the increasing soul<br> And wideness of its limit grown intolerant<br> Replaces life's impetuous joys by peace.<br> Youth, manhood, ripeness, age, four seasons<br> Twixt its return and pale departing life<br> Describes, O mortal,&#8212;youth that forward bends<br> Midst hopes, delights and dreamings; manhood deepens<br> To passions, toils and thoughts profound; but ripeness<br> For large reflective gathering-up of these,<br> As on a lonely slope whence men look back<br> Down towards the cities and the human fields<br> Where they too worked and laughed and loved; next age,<br> Wonderful age with those approaching skies.<br> That boon wilt thou renounce? Wherefore? To bring<br> For a few years&#8212;how miserably few!&#8212;<br> Her sunward who must after all return.<br> Ah, son of Rishis, cease, Lo, I remit<br> Hell's grasp, not oft-relinquished, and send back<br> Thy beautiful life unborrowed to the stars.<br> Or thou must render to the immutable<br> Total all thy fruit-bearing years; then she<br> Reblossoms." But the Shadow antagonist:<br> "Let him be shown the glory he would renounce."<br> And over the flaming pediment there moved,<br> As on a frieze a march of sculptures, carved <A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A><br> By Phidias for the Virgin strong and pure,<br> Most perfect once of all things seen in earth<br> Or Heaven, in Athens on the Acropolis,<br> But now dismembered, now disrupt! or as<br> In Buddhist cavern or Orissan temple,<br> Large aspirations architectural,<br> Warrior and dancing-girl, adept and king,<br> And conquering pomps and daily peaceful groups<br> Dream delicately on, softening with beauty<br> Great Bhuvanayshwar, the Almighty's house,<br> With sculptural suggestion so were limned<br> Scenes future on a pediment of fire.<br> There Ruru saw himself divine with age,<br> A Rishi to whom infinity is close,<br> Rejoicing in some green song-haunted glade<br> Or boundless mountain-top where most we feel<br> Wideness, not by small happy things disturbed.<br> Around him, as around an ancient tree<br> Its seedlings, forms august or flame-like rose;<br> They grew beneath his hands and were his work;<br> Great kings were there whom time remembers, fertile<br> Deep minds and poets with their chanting lips<br> Whose words were seed of vast philosophies<br> These worshipped; above this earth's half-day he saw<br> Amazed the dawn of that mysterious Face<br> And all the universe in beauty merge.<br> Mad the boy thrilled upwards, then spent ebbed back.<br> Over his mind, as birds across the sky<br> Sweep and are gone, the vision of those fields<br> And drooping faces came; almost he heard<br> The burdened river with human anguish wail.<br> Then with a sudden fury gathering<br> His soul he hurled out of it half its life,<br> And fell, like lightning, prone. Triumphant rose<br> The Shadow chill and deepened giant night.<br> Only the dais flickered in the gloom,<br> And those snake-eyes of cruel fire subdued.<br> But suddenly a bloom, a fragrance. Hell<br> Shuddered with bliss: resentful, overborne,<br> The world-besetting Terror faded back <A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A><br> Like one grown weak by desperate victory,<br> And a voice cried in Ruru's tired soul:<br> "Arise! the strife is over, easy now<br> The horror that thou hast to face, the burden<br> Now shared." And with a sudden burst like spring<br> Life woke in the strong lover over-tired.<br> He rose and left dim Death. Twelve times he crossed<br> Boithorini, the river dolorous,<br> Twelve times resisted Hell and hurried down<br> Into the ominous pit where plunges black<br> The vast stream thundering, saw, led puissantly<br> From night to unimaginable night,<br> As men oppressed in dreams, who cannot wake,<br> But measure penal visions,&#8212;punishments<br> Whose sight pollutes, unheard-of tortures, pangs<br> Monstrous, intolerable mute agonies,<br> Twisted unmoving attitudes of pain,<br> Like thoughts inhuman in statuary. A fierce<br> And iron voicelessness had grasped those worlds.<br> No horror of cries expressed their endless pain,<br> No saving struggle, no breathings of the soul.<br> And in the last hell irremediable<br> Where Ganges clots into that fatal pool,<br> Appalled he saw her; pallid, listless, bare&#8212;<br> O other than that earthly warmth and grace<br> In which the happy roses deepened and dimmed<br> With come-and-go of swift enamoured blood!<br> Dumb drooped she; round her shapes of anger armed<br> Stood dark like thunder-clouds. But Ruru sprang<br> Upon them, burning with the admitted God.<br> They from his touch like ineffectual fears<br> Vanished; then sole with her, trembling he cried<br> The old glad name and crying bent to her<br> And touched, and at the touch the silent knots<br> Of Hell were broken and its sombre dream<br> Of dreadful stately pains at once dispersed.<br> Then as from one whom a surpassing joy<br> Has conquered, all the bright surrounding world<br> Streams swiftly into distance, and he feels<br> His daily senses slipping from his grasp, <A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A><br> So that unbearable enormous world<br> Went rolling mighty shades, like the wet mist<br> From men on mountain-tops; and sleep outstretched<br> Rising its soft arms towards him and his thoughts,<br> As on a bed, sank to ascending void.</p>  
<p>But when he woke, he heard the ko&iuml;l insist<br> On sweetness and the voice of happy things<br> Content with sunlight. The warm sense was round him<br> Of old essential earth, known hues and custom<br> Familiar tranquillising body and mind,<br> As in its natural wave a lotus feels.<br> He looked and saw all grass and dense green trees,<br> And sunshine and a single grasshopper<br> Near him repeated fierily its note.<br> Thrilling he felt beneath his bosom her;<br> Oh, warm and breathing were those rescued limbs<br> Against the greenness, vivid, palpable, white,<br> With great black hair and real and her cheek's<br> Old softness and her mouth a dewy rose.<br> For many moments comforting his soul<br> With all her jasmine body sun-ensnared<br> He fed his longing eyes and, half in doubt,<br> With touches satisfied himself of her.<br> Hesitating he kissed her eyelids. Sighing<br> With a slight sob she woke and earthly large<br> Her eyes looked upward into his. She stretched<br> Her arms up, yearning, and their souls embraced;<br> Then twixt brief sobbing laughter and blissful tears,<br> Clinging with all her limbs to him, "O love,<br> The green&nbsp;green world! the warm sunlight!" and ceased,<br> Finding no words; but the earth breathed round them,<br> Glad of her children and the ko&iuml;l's voice<br> Persisted in the morning of the world.</p>
