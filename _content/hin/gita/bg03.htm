</p>  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER III<br> Of Virtue in Work</h1>  
<p><i>Arjuna.</i> Thou whom all mortals praise, Janardana!<br> If meditation be a nobler thing<br> Than action, wherefore, then, great Kesava!<br> Dost thou impel me to this dreadful fight?<br> Now am I by thy doubtful speech disturbed!<br> Tell me one thing, and tell me certainly;<br> By what road shall I find the better end?<br> Krishna. I told thee, blameless Lord! there be paths <br> Shown to this world; two schools of wisdom. First<br> The Sankhya's, which doth save in way of works<br> Prescribed by reason; next, the Yog, which bids<br> Attain by meditation, spiritually:<br> Yet these are one! No man shall 'scape from act<br> By shunning action; nay, and none shall come<br> By mere renouncements unto perfectness.<br> Nay, and no jot of time, at any time,<br> Rests any actionless; his nature's law<br> Compels him, even unwilling, into act;<br> [For thought is act in fancy]. He who sits<br> Suppressing all the instruments of flesh,<br> Yet in his idle heart thinking on them,<br> Plays the inept and guilty hypocrite:<br> But he who, with strong body serving mind,<br> Gives up his mortal powers to worthy work,<br> Not seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one<br> Is honourable. Do thine allotted task!<br> Work is more excellent than idleness;<br> The body's life proceeds not, lacking work.<br> There is a task of holiness to do,<br> Unlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not<br> The faithful soul; such earthly duty do<br> Free from desire, and thou shalt well perform<br> Thy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati -- <br> In the beginning, when all men were made,<br> And, with mankind, the sacrifice -- "Do this!<br> Work! sacrifice! Increase and multiply<br> With sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk,<br> Your 'Cow of Plenty,' giving back her milk<br> Of all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;<br> The gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye<br> The gods will grant to Labour, when it pays<br> Tithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats<br> Fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven<br> No gift of toil, that thief steals from his world." </p>  
<p>Who eat of food after their sacrifice<br> Are quit of fault, but they that spread a feast<br> All for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.<br> By food the living live; food comes of rain,<br> And rain comes by the pious sacrifice,<br> And sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;<br> Thus action is of Brahma, who is One,<br> The Only, All-pervading; at all times<br> Present in sacrifice. He that abstains<br> To help the rolling wheels of this great world,<br> Glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,<br> Shameful and vain. Existing for himself,<br> Self-concentrated, serving self alone,<br> No part hath he in aught; nothing achieved,<br> Nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope<br> Of help for all the living things of earth<br> Depends from him. Therefore, thy task prescribed<br> With spirit unattached gladly perform,<br> Since in performance of plain duty man<br> Mounts to his highest bliss. By works alone<br> Janak and ancient saints reached blessedness!<br> Moreover, for the upholding of thy kind,<br> Action thou should'st embrace. What the wise choose<br> The unwise people take; what best men do<br> The multitude will follow. Look on me,<br> Thou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds<br> I am not bound to any toil, no height<br> Awaits to scale, no gift remains to gain,<br> Yet I act here! and, if I acted not -- <br> Earnest and watchful -- those that look to me<br> For guidance, sinking back to sloth again<br> Because I slumbered, would decline from good,<br> And I should break earth's order and commit<br> Her offspring unto ruin, Bharata!<br> Even as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense,<br> So let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set<br> To bring the world deliverance, and its bliss;<br> Not sowing in those simple, busy hearts<br> Seed of despair. Yea! let each play his part<br> In all he finds to do, with unyoked soul.<br> All things are everywhere by Nature wrought<br> In interaction of the quahties.<br> The fool, cheated by self, thinks, "This I did"<br> And "That I wrought;" but -- ah, thou strong-armed Prince! -- <br> A better-lessoned mind, knowing the play<br> Of visible things within the world of sense,<br> And how the qualities must qualify,<br> Standeth aloof even from his acts. Th' untaught<br> Live mixed with them, knowing not Nature's way,<br> Of highest aims unwitting, slow and dull.<br> Those make thou not to stumble, having the light;<br> But all thy dues discharging, for My sake,<br> With meditation centred inwardly,<br> Seeking no profit, satisfied, serene,<br> Heedless of issue -- fight! They who shall keep<br> My ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts,<br> Have quittance from all issue of their acts;<br> But those who disregard My ordinance,<br> Thinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss,<br> Confused and foolish. 'Sooth, the instructed one<br> Doth of his kind, following what fits him most:<br> And lower creatures of their kind; in vain<br> Contending 'gainst the law. Needs must it be<br> The objects of the sense will stir the sense<br> To like and dislike, yet th' enlightened man<br> Yields not to these, knowing them enemies.<br> Finally, this is better, that one do<br> His own task as he may, even though he fail,<br> Than take tasks not his own, though they seem good.<br> To die performing duty is no ill;<br> But who seeks other roads shall wander still.<br> Arjuna. Yet tell me, Teacher! by what force doth man <br> Go to his ill, unwilling; as if one<br> Pushed him that evil path?<br> Krishna. Kama it is!<br> Passion it is! born of the Darknesses,<br> Which pusheth him. Mighty of appetite,<br> Sinful, and strong is this! -- man's enemy!<br> As smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust<br> Mars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds<br> The babe unborn, so is the world of things<br> Foiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh.<br> The wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe<br> It is of wisdom, wearing countless forms,<br> Fair but deceitful, subtle as a flame.<br> Sense, mind, and reason -- these, O Kunti's Son!<br> Are booty for it; in its play with these<br> It maddens man, beguiling, blinding him.<br> Therefore, thou noblest child of Bharata!<br> Govern thy heart! Constrain th' entangled sense!<br> Resist the false, soft sinfulness which saps<br> Knowledge and judgment! Yea, the world is strong<br> But what discerns it stronger, and the mind<br> Strongest; and high o'er all the ruling Soul.<br> Wherefore, perceiving Him who reigns supreme,<br> Put forth full force of Soul in thy own soul!<br> Fight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear Hero! slay<br> What haunts thee in fond shapes, and would betray! </p>  
<p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER III OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA, </p>
