</p>  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XIII<br> Of Religion by Separation of Matter and Spirit</h1>  
<p><i>Arjuna.</i> Now would I hear, O gracious Kesava!<br> Of Life which seems, and Soul beyond, which sees,<br> And what it is we know- or think to know.<br> Krishna. Yea! Son of Kunti! for this flesh ye see<br> Is Kshetra, is the field where Life disports;<br> And that which views and knows it is the Soul,<br> Kshetrajna. In all "fields," thou Indian prince!<br> I am Kshetrajna. I am what surveys!<br> Only that knowledge knows which knows the known<br> By the knower! What it is, that "field" of life,<br> What qualities it hath, and whence it is,<br> And why it changeth, and the faculty<br> That wotteth it, the mightiness of this,<br> And how it wotteth- hear these things from Me!</p>  
<p>The elements, the conscious life, the mind,<br> The unseen vital force, the nine strange gates<br> Of the body, and the five domains of sense;<br> Desire, dislike, pleasure and pain, and thought<br> Deep-woven, and persistency of being;<br> These all are wrought on Matter by the Soul!</p>  
<p>Humbleness, truthfulness, and harmlessness,<br> Patience and honour, reverence for the wise.<br> Purity, constancy, control of self,<br> Contempt of sense-delights, self-sacrifice,<br> Perception of the certitude of ill<br> In birth, death, age, disease, suffering, and sin;<br> Detachment, lightly holding unto home,<br> Children, and wife, and all that bindeth men;<br> An ever-tranquil heart in fortunes good<br> And fortunes evil, with a will set firm<br> To worship Me- Me only! ceasing not;<br> Loving all solitudes, and shunning noise<br> Of foolish crowds; endeavours resolute<br> To reach perception of the Utmost Soul,<br> And grace to understand what gain it were<br> So to attain,- this is true Wisdom, Prince!<br> And what is otherwise is ignorance!</p>  
<p>Now will I speak of knowledge best to know-<br> That Truth which giveth man Amrit to drink,<br> The Truth of HIM, the Para-Brahm, the All,<br> The Uncreated; not Asat, nor Sat,<br> Not Form, nor the Unformed; yet both, and more;-<br> Whose hands are everywhere, and everywhere<br> Planted His feet, and everywhere His eyes<br> Beholding, and His ears in every place<br> Hearing, and all His faces everywhere<br> Enlightening and encompassing His worlds.<br> Glorified in the senses He hath given,<br> Yet beyond sense He is; sustaining all,<br> Yet dwells He unattached: of forms and modes<br> Master, yet neither form nor mode hath He;<br> He is within all beings- and without-<br> Motionless, yet still moving; not discerned<br> For subtlety of instant presence; close<br> To all, to each; yet measurelessly far!<br> Not manifold, and yet subsisting still<br> In all which lives; for ever to be known<br> As the Sustainer, yet, at the End of Times,<br> He maketh all to end- and re-creates.<br> The Light of Lights He is, in the heart of the Dark<br> Shining eternally. Wisdom He is<br> And Wisdom's way, and Guide of all the wise,<br> Planted in every heart.</p>  
<p>So have I told<br> Of Life's stuff, and the moulding, and the lore<br> To comprehend. Whoso, adoring Me,<br> Perceiveth this, shall surely come to Me!</p>  
<p>Know thou that Nature and the Spirit both<br> Have no beginning! Know that qualities<br> And changes of them are by Nature wrought;<br> That Nature puts to work the acting frame,<br> But Spirit doth inform it, and so cause<br> Feeling of pain and pleasure. Spirit, linked<br> To moulded matter, entereth into bond<br> With qualities by Nature framed, and, thus<br> Married to matter, breeds the birth again<br> In good or evil yonis.<br> Yet is this-<br> Yea! in its bodily prison!- Spirit pure,<br> Spirit supreme; surveying, governing,<br> Guarding, possessing; Lord and Master still<br> PURUSHA, Ultimate, One Soul with Me.</p>  
<p>Whoso thus knows himself, and knows his soul<br> PURUSHA, working through the qualities<br> With Nature's modes, the light hath come for him!<br> Whatever flesh he bears, never again<br> Shall he take on its load. Some few there be<br> By meditation find the Soul in Self<br> Self-schooled; and some by long philosophy<br> And holy life reach thither; some by works:<br> Some, never so attaining, hear of light<br> From other lips, and seize, and cleave to it<br> Worshipping; yea! and those- to teaching true-<br> Overpass Death!<br> Wherever, Indian Prince!<br> Life is- of moving things, or things unmoved,<br> Plant or still seed- know, what is there hath grown<br> By bond of Matter and of Spirit: Know<br> He sees indeed who sees in all alike<br> The living, lordly Soul; the Soul Supreme,<br> Imperishable amid the Perishing:<br> For, whoso thus beholds, in every place,<br> In every form, the same, one, Living Life,<br> Doth no more wrongfulness unto himself,<br> But goes the highest road which brings to bliss.<br> Seeing, he sees, indeed, who sees that works<br> Are Nature's wont, for Soul to practise by<br> Acting, yet not the agent; sees the mass<br> Of separate living things- each of its kind-<br> Issue from One, and blend again to One:<br> Then hath he BRAHMA, he attains!<br> O Prince!<br> That Ultimate, High Spirit, Uncreate,<br> Unqualified, even when it entereth flesh<br> Taketh no stain of acts, worketh in nought!<br> Like to th' ethereal air, pervading all,<br> Which, for sheer subtlety, avoideth taint,<br> The subtle Soul sits everywhere, unstained:<br> Like to the light of the all-piercing sun<br> [Which is not changed by aught it shines upon,]<br> The Soul's light shineth pure in every place;<br> And they who, by such eye of wisdom, see<br> How Matter, and what deals with it, divide;<br> And how the Spirit and the flesh have strife,<br> Those wise ones go the way which leads to Life!</p>  
<p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XIII OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Kshetrakshetrajnavibhagayog,"<br> Or "The Book of Religion by Separation of Matter and Spirit." </p>
