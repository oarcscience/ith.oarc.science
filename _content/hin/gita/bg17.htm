</p>  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XVII<br> Of Religion by the Threefold Kinds of Faith</h1>  
<p><i>Arjuna.</i> If men forsake the holy ordinance,<br> Heedless of Shastras, yet keep faith at heart<br> And worship, what shall be the state of those,<br> Great Krishna! Sattwan, Rajas, Tamas? Say!<br> Krishna. Threefold the faith is of mankind, and springs<br> From those three qualities,- becoming "true,"<br> Or "passion-stained," or "dark," as thou shalt hear!</p>  
<p>The faith of each believer, Indian Prince!<br> Conforms itself to what he truly is.<br> Where thou shalt see a worshipper, that one<br> To what he worships lives assimilate,<br> [Such as the shrine, so is the votary,]<br> The "soothfast" souls adore true gods; the souls<br> Obeying Rajas worship Rakshasas<br> Or Yakshas; and the men of Darkness pray<br> To Pretas and to Bhutas. Yea, and those<br> Who practise bitter penance, not enjoined<br> By rightful rule- penance which hath its root<br> In self-sufficient, proud hypocrisies-<br> Those men, passion-beset, violent, wild,<br> Torturing- the witless ones- My elements<br> Shut in fair company within their flesh,<br> (Nay, Me myself, present within the flesh!)<br> Know them to devils devoted, not to Heaven!<br> For like as foods are threefold for mankind<br> In nourishing, so is there threefold way<br> Of worship, abstinence, and almsgiving!<br> Hear this of Me! there is a food which brings<br> Force, substance, strength, and health, and joy to live,<br> Being well-seasoned, cordial, comforting,<br> The "Soothfast" meat. And there be foods which bring<br> Aches and unrests, and burning blood, and grief<br> Being too biting, heating, salt, and sharp,<br> And therefore craved by too strong appetite.<br> And there is foul food- kept from over-night,<br> Savourless, filthy, which the foul will eat,<br> A feast of rottenness, meet for the lips<br> Of such as love the "Darkness."</p>  
<p>Thus with rites;-<br> A sacrifice not for rewardment made,<br> Offered in rightful wise, when he who vows<br> Sayeth, with heart devout, "This I should do!<br> Is "Soothfast" rite. But sacrifice for gain,<br> Offered for good repute, be sure that this,<br> O Best of Bharatas! is Rajas-rite,<br> With stamp of "passion." And a sacrifice<br> Offered against the laws, with no due dole<br> Of food-giving, with no accompaniment<br> Of hallowed hymn, nor largesse to the priests,<br> In faithless celebration, call it vile,<br> The deed of "Darkness!"- lost!<br> Worship of gods<br> Meriting worship; lowly reverence<br> Of Twice-borns, Teachers, Elders; Purity,<br> Rectitude, and the Brahmacharya's vow,<br> And not to injure any helpless thing,-<br> These make a true religiousness of Act.</p>  
<p>Words causing no man woe, words ever true,<br> Gentle and pleasing words, and those ye say<br> In murmured reading of a Sacred Writ,-<br> These make the true religiousness of Speech.</p>  
<p>Serenity of soul, benignity,<br> Sway of the silent Spirit, constant stress<br> To sanctify the Nature,- these things make<br> Good rite, and true religiousness of Mind.</p>  
<p>Such threefold faith, in highest piety<br> Kept, with no hope of gain, by hearts devote<br> Is perfect work of Sattwan, true belief.</p>  
<p>Religion shown in act of proud display<br> To win good entertainment, worship, fame,<br> Such- say I- is of Rajas, rash and vain.</p>  
<p>Religion followed by a witless will<br> To torture self, or come at power to hurt<br> Another,- 'tis of Tamas, dark and ill.</p>  
<p>The gift lovingly given, when one shall say<br> "Now must I gladly give!" when he who takes<br> Can render nothing back; made in due place,<br> Due time, and to a meet recipient,<br> Is gift of Sattwan, fair and profitable.</p>  
<p>The gift selfishly given, where to receive<br> Is hoped again, or when some end is sought,<br> Or where the gift is proffered with a grudge,<br> This is of Rajas, stained with impulse, ill.</p>  
<p>The gift churlishly flung, at evil time,<br> In wrongful place, to base recipient,<br> Made in disdain or harsh unkindliness,<br> Is gift of Tamas, dark; it doth not bless!</p>  
<p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XVII OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Sraddhatrayavibhagayog,"<br> Or "The Book of Religion by the Threefold<br> Kinds of Faith." </p>
