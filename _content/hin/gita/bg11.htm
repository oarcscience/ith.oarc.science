</p>  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XI<br> Of the Manifesting of the One and Manifold</h1>  
<p><i>Arjuna.</i> This, for my soul's peace, have I heard from Thee,<br> The unfolding of the Mystery Supreme<br> Named Adhyatman; comprehending which,<br> My darkness is dispelled; for now I know-<br> O Lotus-eyed!- whence is the birth of men,<br> And whence their death, and what the majesties<br> Of Thine immortal rule. Fain would I see,<br> As thou Thyself declar'st it, Sovereign Lord!<br> The likeness of that glory of Thy Form<br> Wholly revealed. O Thou Divinest One!<br> If this can be, if I may bear the sight,<br> Make Thyself visible, Lord of all prayers!<br> Show me Thy very self, the Eternal God!<br> Krishna. Gaze, then, thou Son of Pritha! I manifest for thee<br> Those hundred thousand thousand shapes that clothe my Mystery:<br> I show thee all my semblances, infinite, rich, divine,<br> My changeful hues, my countless forms. See! in this face of mine,<br> Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Aswins, and Maruts; see<br> Wonders unnumbered, Indian Prince! revealed to none save thee.<br> Behold! this is the Universe!- Look! what is live and dead<br> I gather all in one- in Me! Gaze, as thy lips have said<br> On GOD, ETERNAL, VERY GOD! See ME! what thou prayest!</p>  
<p>Thou canst not!- nor, with human eyes, Arjuna! ever mayest!<br> Therefore I give thee sense divine. Have other eyes, new light!<br> And, look! This is My glory, unveiled to mortal sight!<br> Sanjaya. Then, O King! to God, so saying,<br> Stood, to Pritha's Son displaying<br> All the splendour, wonder, dread<br> Of His vast Almighty-head.<br> Out of countless eyes beholding,<br> Out of countless mouths commanding,<br> Countless mystic forms enfolding<br> In one Form: supremely standing<br> Countless radiant glories wearing,<br> Countless heavenly weapons bearing,<br> Crowned with garlands of star-clusters,<br> Robed in garb of woven lustres,<br> Breathing from His perfect Presence<br> Breaths of every subtle essence<br> Of all heavenly odours; shedding<br> Blinding brilliance; overspreading-<br> Boundless, beautiful- all spaces<br> With His all-regarding faces;<br> So He showed! If there should rise<br> Suddenly within the skies<br> Sunburst of a thousand suns<br> Flooding earth with beams undeemed-of,<br> Then might be that Holy One's<br> Majesty and radiance dreamed of!</p>  
<p>So did Pandu's Son behold<br> All this universe enfold<br> All its huge diversity<br> Into one vast shape, and be<br> Visible, and viewed, and blended<br> In one Body- subtle, splendid,<br> Nameless- th' All-comprehending<br> God of Gods, the Never-Ending<br> Deity!</p>  
<p>But, sore amazed,<br> Thrilled, o'erfilled, dazzled, and dazed,<br> Arjuna knelt; and bowed his head,<br> And clasped his palms; and cried, and said:<br> Arjuna. Yea! I have seen! I see!<br> Lord! all is wrapped in Thee!<br> The gods are in Thy glorious frame! the creatures<br> Of earth, and heaven, and hell<br> In Thy Divine form dwell,<br> And in Thy countenance shine all the features</p>  
<p>Of Brahma, sitting lone<br> Upon His lotus-throne;<br> Of saints and sages, and the serpent races<br> Ananta, Vasuki;<br> Yea! mightiest Lord! I see<br> Thy thousand thousand arms and breasts, and faces,</p>  
<p>And eyes,- on every side<br> Perfect, diversified;<br> And nowhere end of Thee, nowhere beginning,<br> Nowhere a centre! Shifts-<br> Wherever soul's gaze lifts-<br> Thy central Self, all-wielding, and all-winning!</p>  
<p>Infinite King! I see<br> The anadem on Thee,<br> The club, the shell, the discus; see Thee burning<br> In beams insufferable,<br> Lighting earth, heaven, and hell<br> With brilliance blazing, glowing, flashing; turning</p>  
<p>Darkness to dazzling day,<br> Look I whichever way;<br> Ah, Lord! I worship Thee, the Undivided,<br> The Uttermost of thought,<br> The Treasure-Palace wrought<br> To hold the wealth of the worlds; the Shield provided</p>  
<p>To shelter Virtue's laws;<br> The Fount whence Life's stream draws<br> All waters of all rivers of all being:<br> The One Unborn, Unending:<br> Unchanging and Unblending!<br> With might and majesty, past thought, past seeing!</p>  
<p>Silver of moon and gold<br> Of sun are glories rolled<br> From Thy great eyes; Thy visage, beaming tender<br> Throughout the stars and skies,<br> Doth to warm life surprise<br> Thy Universe. The worlds are filled with wonder</p>  
<p>Of Thy perfections! Space<br> Star-sprinkled, and void place<br> From pole to pole of the Blue, from bound to bound,<br> Hath Thee in every spot,<br> Thee, Thee!- Where Thou art not,<br> O Holy, Marvellous Form! is nowhere found!</p>  
<p>O Mystic, Awful One!<br> At sight of Thee, made known,<br> The Three Worlds quake; the lower gods draw nigh Thee;<br> They fold their palms, and bow<br> Body, and breast, and brow,<br> And, whispering worship, laud and magnify Thee!</p>  
<p>Rishis and Siddhas cry<br> "Hail! Highest Majesty!<br> From sage and singer breaks the hymn of glory<br> In dulcet harmony,<br> Sounding the praise of Thee;<br> While countless companies take up the story,</p>  
<p>Rudras, who ride the storms,<br> Th' Adityas' shining forms,<br> Vasus and Sadhyas, Viswas, Ushmapas;<br> Maruts, and those great Twins<br> The heavenly, fair, Aswins,<br> Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Siddhas, and Asuras,-</p>  
<p>These see Thee, and revere<br> In sudden-stricken fear;<br> Yea! the Worlds,- seeing Thee with form stupendous,<br> With faces manifold,<br> With eyes which all behold,<br> Unnumbered eyes, vast arms, members tremendous,</p>  
<p>Flanks, lit with sun and star,<br> Feet planted near and far,<br> Tushes of terror, mouths wrathful and tender;-<br> The Three wide Worlds before Thee<br> Adore, as I adore Thee,<br> Quake, as I quake, to witness so much splendour!</p>  
<p>I mark Thee strike the skies<br> With front, in wondrous wise<br> Huge, rainbow-painted, glittering; and thy mouth<br> Opened, and orbs which see<br> All things, whatever be<br> In all Thy worlds, east, west, and north and south.</p>  
<p>O Eyes of God! O Head!<br> My strength of soul is fled,<br> Gone is heart's force, rebuked is mind's desire!<br> When I behold Thee so,<br> With awful brows a-glow,<br> With burning glance, and lips lighted by fire</p>  
<p>Fierce as those flames which shall<br> Consume, at close of all,<br> Earth, Heaven! Ah me! I see no Earth and Heaven!<br> Thee, Lord of Lords! I see,<br> Thee only- only Thee!<br> Now let Thy mercy unto me be given,</p>  
<p>Thou Refuge of the World!<br> Lo! to the cavern hurled<br> Of Thy wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed,<br> I see our noblest ones,<br> Great Dhritarashtra's sons,<br> Bhishma, Drona, and Karna, caught and crushed!</p>  
<p>The Kings and Chiefs drawn in,<br> That gaping gorge within;<br> The best of both these armies torn and riven!<br> Between Thy jaws they lie<br> Mangled full bloodily,<br> Ground into dust and death! Like streams down-driven</p>  
<p>With helpless haste, which go<br> In headlong furious flow<br> Straight to the gulfing deeps of th' unfilled ocean,<br> So to that flaming cave<br> Those heroes great and brave<br> Pour, in unending streams, with helpless motion!</p>  
<p>Like moths which in the night<br> Flutter towards a light,<br> Drawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying,<br> So to their death still throng,<br> Blind, dazzled, borne along<br> Ceaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying!</p>  
<p>Thou, that hast fashioned men,<br> Devourest them again,<br> One with another, great and small, alike!<br> The creatures whom Thou mak'st,<br> With flaming jaws Thou tak'st,<br> Lapping them up! Lord God! Thy terrors strike</p>  
<p>From end to end of earth,<br> Filling life full, from birth<br> To death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread!<br> Ah, Vishnu! make me know<br> Why is Thy visage so?<br> Who art Thou, feasting thus upon Thy dead?</p>  
<p>Who? awful Deity!<br> I bow myself to Thee,<br> Namostu Te, Devavara! Prasid!<br> O Mightiest Lord! rehearse<br> Why hast Thou face so fierce?<br> Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed?<br> Krishna. Thou seest Me as Time who kills,<br> Time who brings all to doom,<br> The Slayer Time, Ancient of Days, come hither to consume;<br> Excepting thee, of all these hosts of hostile chiefs arrayed,<br> There stands not one shall leave alive the battlefield! Dismayed<br> No longer be! Arise! obtain renown! destroy thy foes!<br> Fight for the kingdom waiting thee when thou hast vanquished those.<br> By Me they fall- not thee! the stroke of death is dealt them now,<br> Even as they show thus gallantly; My instrument art thou!<br> Strike, strong-armed Prince, at Drona! at Bhishma strike! deal<br> death<br> On Karna, Jyadratha; stay all their warlike breath!<br> 'Tis I who bid them perish! Thou wilt but slay the slain;<br> Fight! they must fall, and thou must live, victor upon this plain!<br> Sanjaya. Hearing mighty Keshav's word,<br> Trembling that helmed Lord<br> Clasped his lifted palms, and- praying<br> Grace of Krishna- stood there, saying,<br> With bowed brow and accents broken,<br> These words, timorously spoken:<br> Arjuna. Worthily, Lord of Might!<br> The whole world hath delight<br> In Thy surpassing power, obeying Thee;<br> The Rakshasas, in dread<br> At sight of Thee, are sped<br> To all four quarters; and the company</p>  
<p>Of Siddhas sound Thy name.<br> How should they not proclaim<br> Thy Majesties, Divinest, Mightiest?<br> Thou Brahm, than Brahma greater!<br> Thou Infinite Creator!<br> Thou God of gods, Life's Dwelling-place and Rest.</p>  
<p>Thou, of all souls the Soul!<br> The Comprehending Whole!<br> Of being formed, and formless being the Framer;<br> O Utmost One! O Lord!<br> Older than eld, Who stored<br> The worlds with wealth of life! O Treasure-Claimer,</p>  
<p>Who wottest all, and art<br> Wisdom Thyself! O Part<br> In all, and All; for all from Thee have risen<br> Numberless now I see<br> The aspects are of Thee!<br> Vayu Thou art, and He who keeps the prison</p>  
<p>Of Narak, Yama dark;<br> And Agni's shining spark;<br> Varuna's waves are Thy waves. Moon and starlight<br> Are Thine! Prajapati<br> Art Thou, and 'tis to Thee<br> They knelt in worshipping the old world's far light,</p>  
<p>The first of mortal men.<br> Again, Thou God! again<br> A thousand thousand times be magnified!<br> Honour and worship be-<br> Glory and praise,- to Thee<br> Namo, Namaste, cried on every side;<br> Cried here, above, below,<br> Uttered when Thou dost go,<br> Uttered where Thou dost come! Namo! we call;<br> Namostu! God adored!<br> Namostu! Nameless Lord<br> Hail to Thee! Praise to Thee Thou One in all;</p>  
<p>For Thou art All! Yea, Thou!<br> Ah! if in anger now<br> Thou shouldst remember I did think Thee Friend,<br> Speaking with easy speech,<br> As men use each to each;<br> Did call Thee "Krishna," "Prince," nor comprehend</p>  
<p>Thy hidden majesty,<br> The might, the awe of Thee;<br> Did, in my heedlessness, or in my love,<br> On journey, or in jest,<br> Or when we lay at rest,<br> Sitting at council, straying in the grove,</p>  
<p>Alone, or in the throng,<br> Do Thee, most Holy! wrong,<br> Be Thy grace granted for that witless sin<br> For Thou art, now I know,<br> Father of all below,<br> Of all above, of all the worlds within</p>  
<p>Guru of Gurus; more<br> To reverence and adore<br> Than all which is adorable and high!<br> How, in the wide worlds three<br> Should any equal be?<br> Should any other share Thy Majesty?</p>  
<p>Therefore, with body bent<br> And reverent intent,<br> I praise, and serve, and seek Thee, asking grace.<br> As father to a son,<br> As friend to friend, as one<br> Who loveth to his lover, turn Thy face</p>  
<p>In gentleness on me!<br> Good is it I did see<br> This unknown marvel of Thy Form! But fear<br> Mingles with joy! Retake,<br> Dear Lord! for pity's sake<br> Thine earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear!</p>  
<p>Be merciful, and show<br> The visage that I know;<br> Let me regard Thee, as of yore, arrayed<br> With disc and forehead-gem,<br> With mace and anadem,<br> Thou that sustainest all things! Undismayed</p>  
<p>Let me once more behold<br> The form I loved of old,<br> Thou of the thousand arms and countless eyes!<br> This frightened heart is fain<br> To see restored again<br> My Charioteer, in Krishna's kind disguise.</p>  
<p>Krishna. Yea! thou hast seen, Arjuna! because I loved thee well,<br> The secret countenance of Me, revealed by mystic spell,<br> Shining, and wonderful, and majestic, manifold,<br> Which none save thou in all the years had favour to behold;<br> For not by Vedas cometh this, nor sacrifice, nor alms,<br> Nor works well-done, nor penance long, nor prayers, nor chanted<br> psalms,<br> That mortal eyes should bear to view the Immortal Soul unclad,<br> Prince of the Kurus! This was kept for thee alone! Be glad!<br> Let no more trouble shake thy heart, because thine eyes have seen<br> My terror with My glory. As I before have been<br> So will I be again for thee; with lightened heart behold!<br> Once more I am thy Krishna, the form thou knew'st of old!<br> Sanjaya. These words to Arjuna spake<br> Vasudev, and straight did take<br> Back again the semblance dear<br> Of the well-loved charioteer;<br> Peace and joy it did restore<br> When the Prince beheld once more<br> Mighty BRAHMA'S form and face<br> Clothed in Krishna's gentle grace.<br> Arjuna. Now that I see come back, Janardana!<br> This friendly human frame, my mind can think<br> Calm thoughts once more; my heart beats still again!<br> Krishna. Yea! it was wonderful and terrible<br> To view me as thou didst, dear Prince! The gods<br> Dread and desire continually to view!<br> Yet not by Vedas, nor from sacrifice,<br> Nor penance, nor gift-giving, nor with prayer<br> Shall any so behold, as thou hast seen!<br> Only by fullest service, perfect faith,<br> And uttermost surrender am I known<br> And seen, and entered into, Indian Prince!<br> Who doeth all for Me; who findeth Me<br> In all; adoreth always; loveth all<br> Which I have made, and Me, for Love's sole end,<br> That man, Arjuna! unto Me doth wend.</p>  
<p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XI OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Viswarupadarsanam,"<br> Or "The Book of the Manifesting of the<br> One and Manifold." </p>
