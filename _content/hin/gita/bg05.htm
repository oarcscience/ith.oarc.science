</p>  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER V<br> Of Religion by Renouncing Fruit of Works</h1>  
<p><i>Arjuna.</i> Yet, Krishna at the one time thou dost laud<br> Surcease of works, and, at another time,<br> Service through work. Of these twain plainly tell<br> Which is the better way?<br> Krishna. To cease from works<br> Is well, and to do works in holiness<br> Is well; and both conduct to bliss supreme;<br> But of these twain the better way is his<br> Who working piously refraineth not.</p>  
<p>That is the true Renouncer, firm and fixed,<br> Who- seeking nought, rejecting nought- dwells proof<br> Against the "opposites." O valiant Prince!<br> In doing, such breaks lightly from all deed:<br> 'Tis the new scholar talks as they were two,<br> This Sankhya and this Yoga: wise men know<br> Who husbands one plucks golden fruit of both!<br> The region of high rest which Sankhyans reach<br> Yogins attain. Who sees these twain as one<br> Sees with clear eyes! Yet such abstraction, Chief!<br> Is hard to win without much holiness.<br> Whoso is fixed in holiness, self-ruled,<br> Pure-hearted, lord of senses and of self,<br> Lost in the common life of all which lives-<br> A "Yogayukt"- he is a Saint who wends<br> Straightway to Brahm. Such an one is not touched<br> By taint of deeds. "Nought of myself I do!"<br> Thus will he think- who holds the truth of truths-<br> In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling; when<br> He eats, or goes, or breathes; slumbers or talks,<br> Holds fast or loosens, opes his eyes or shuts;<br> Always assured "This is the sense-world plays<br> With senses." He that acts in thought of Brahm,<br> Detaching end from act, with act content,<br> The world of sense can no more stain his soul<br> Than waters mar th' enamelled lotus-leaf.<br> With life, with heart, with mind,- nay, with the help<br> Of all five senses- letting selfhood go-<br> Yogins toil ever towards their souls' release.<br> Such votaries, renouncing fruit of deeds,<br> Gain endless peace: the unvowed, the passion-bound,<br> Seeking a fruit from works, are fastened down.<br> The embodied sage, withdrawn within his soul,<br> At every act sits godlike in "the town<br> Which hath nine gateways," neither doing aught<br> Nor causing any deed. This world's Lord makes<br> Neither the work, nor passion for the work,<br> Nor lust for fruit of work; the man's own self<br> Pushes to these! The Master of this World<br> Takes on himself the good or evil deeds<br> Of no man- dwelling beyond! Mankind errs here<br> By folly, darkening knowledge. But, for whom<br> That darkness of the soul is chased by light,<br> Splendid and clear shines manifest the Truth<br> As if a Sun of Wisdom sprang to shed<br> Its beams of dawn. Him meditating still,<br> Him seeking, with Him blended, stayed on Him,<br> The souls illuminated take that road<br> Which hath no turning back- their sins flung off,<br> By strength of faith. [Who will may have this Light;<br> Who hath it sees.] To him who wisely sees,<br> The Brahman with his scrolls and sanctities,<br> The cow, the elephant, the unclean dog,<br> The Outcast gorging dog's meat, are all one.</p>  
<p>The world is overcome- aye! even here!<br> By such as fix their faith on Unity.<br> The sinless Brahma dwells in Unity,<br> And they in Brahma. Be not over-glad<br> Attaining joy, and be not over-sad<br> Encountering grief, but, stayed on Brahma, still<br> Constant let each abide! The sage whose soul<br> Holds off from outer contacts, in himself<br> Finds bliss; to Brahma joined by piety,<br> His spirit tastes eternal peace. The joys<br> Springing from sense-life are but quickening wombs<br> Which breed sure griefs: those joys begin and end!<br> The wise mind takes no pleasure, Kunti's Son!<br> In such as those! But if a man shall learn,<br> Even while he lives and bears his body's chain,<br> To master lust and anger, he is blest!<br> He is the Yukta; he hath happiness,<br> Contentment, light, within: his life is merged<br> In Brahma's life; he doth Nirvana touch!<br> Thus go the Rishis unto rest, who dwell<br> With sins effaced, with doubts at end, with hearts<br> Governed and calm. Glad in all good they live,<br> Nigh to the peace of God; and all those live<br> Who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath,<br> Subduing self and senses, knowing the Soul!</p>  
<p>The Saint who shuts outside his placid soul<br> All touch of sense, letting no contact through;<br> Whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows,<br> Whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn<br> Equal and slow through nostrils still and close;<br> That one- with organs, heart, and mind constrained,<br> Bent on deliverance, having put away<br> Passion, and fear, and rage;- hath even now,<br> Obtained deliverance, ever and ever freed.<br> Yea! for he knows Me Who am He that heeds<br> The sacrifice and worship, God revealed;<br> And He who heeds not, being Lord of Worlds,<br> Lover of all that lives, God unrevealed,<br> Wherein who will shall find surety and shield!</p>  
<p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER V OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Karmasanyasayog,"<br> Or "The Book of Religion by Renouncing<br> Fruit of Works." </p>
