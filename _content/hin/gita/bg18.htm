</p>  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XVIII<br> Of Religion by Deliverance and Renunciation</h1>  
<p><i>Arjuna.</i> Fain would I better know, Thou Glorious One!<br> The very truth- Heart's Lord!- of Sannyas,<br> Abstention; and Renunciation, Lord!<br> Tyaga; and what separates these twain!<br> Krishna. The poets rightly teach that Sannyas<br> Is the foregoing of all acts which spring<br> Out of desire; and their wisest say<br> Tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts.</p>  
<p>There be among the saints some who have held<br> All action sinful, and to be renounced;<br> And some who answer, "Nay! the goodly acts-<br> As worship, penance, alms- must be performed!"<br> Hear now My sentence, Best of Bharatas!</p>  
<p>'Tis well set forth, O Chaser of thy Foes!<br> Renunciation is of threefold form,<br> And Worship, Penance, Alms, not to be stayed;<br> Nay, to be gladly done; for all those three<br> Are purifying waters for true souls!</p>  
<p>Yet must be practised even those high works<br> In yielding up attachment, and all fruit<br> Produced by works. This is My judgment, Prince!<br> This My insuperable and fixed decree!</p>  
<p>Abstaining from a work by right prescribed<br> Never is meet! So to abstain doth spring<br> From "Darkness," and Delusion teacheth it.<br> Abstaining from a work grievous to flesh,<br> When one saith "'Tis unpleasing!" this is null!<br> Such an one acts from "passion;" nought of gain<br> Wins his Renunciation! But, Arjun!<br> Abstaining from attachment to the work,<br> Abstaining from rewardment in the work,<br> While yet one doeth it full faithfully,<br> Saying, "'Tis right to do!" that is "true" act<br> And abstinence! Who doeth duties so,<br> Unvexed if his work fail, if it succeed<br> Unflattered, in his own heart justified,<br> Quit of debates and doubts, his is "true" act:<br> For, being in the body, none may stand<br> Wholly aloof from act; yet, who abstains<br> From profit of his acts is abstinent.</p>  
<p>The fruit of labours, in the fives to come,<br> Is threefold for all men,- Desirable,<br> And Undesirable, and mixed of both;<br> But no fruit is at all where no work was.</p>  
<p>Hear from me, Long-armed Lord! the makings five<br> Which go to every act, in Sankhya taught<br> As necessary. First the force; and then<br> The agent; next, the various instruments;<br> Fourth, the especial effort; fifth, the God.<br> What work soever any mortal doth<br> Of body, mind, or speech, evil or good,<br> By these five doth he that. Which being thus,<br> Whoso, for lack of knowledge, seeth himself<br> As the sole actor, knoweth nought at all<br> And seeth nought. Therefore, I say, if one-<br> Holding aloof from self- with unstained mind<br> Should slay all yonder host, being bid to slay,<br> He doth not slay; he is not bound thereby!</p>  
<p>Knowledge, the thing known, and the mind which knows,<br> These make the threefold starting-ground of act.<br> The act, the actor, and the instrument,<br> These make the threefold total of the deed.<br> But knowledge, agent, act, are differenced<br> By three dividing qualities. Hear now<br> Which be the qualities dividing them.</p>  
<p>There is "true" Knowledge. Learn thou it is this:<br> To see one changeless Life in all the Lives,<br> And in the Separate, One Inseparable.<br> There is imperfect Knowledge: that which sees<br> The separate existences apart,<br> And, being separated, holds them real.<br> There is false Knowledge: that which blindly clings<br> To one as if 'twere all, seeking no Cause,<br> Deprived of light, narrow, and dull, and "dark."</p>  
<p>There is "right" Action: that which- being enjoined-<br> Is wrought without attachment, passionlessly,<br> For duty, not for love, nor hate, nor gain.<br> There is "vain" Action: that which men pursue<br> Aching to satisfy desires, impelled<br> By sense of self, with all-absorbing stress:<br> This is of Rajas- passionate and vain.<br> There is "dark" Action: when one doth a thing<br> Heedless of issues, heedless of the hurt<br> Or wrong for others, heedless if he harm<br> His own soul- 'tis of Tamas, black and bad!</p>  
<p>There is the "rightful" doer. He who acts<br> Free from self-seeking, humble, resolute,<br> Steadfast, in good or evil hap the same,<br> Content to do aright- he "truly" acts.<br> There is th' "impassioned" doer. He that works<br> From impulse, seeking profit, rude and bold<br> To overcome, unchastened; slave by turns<br> Of sorrow and of joy: of Rajas he!<br> And there be evil doers; loose of heart,<br> Low-minded, stubborn, fraudulent, remiss,<br> Dull, slow, despondent- children of the "dark."</p>  
<p>Hear, too, of Intellect and Steadfastness<br> The threefold separation, Conqueror-Prince!<br> How these are set apart by Qualities.</p>  
<p>Good is the Intellect which comprehends<br> The coming forth and going back of life,<br> What must be done, and what must not be done,<br> What should be feared, and what should not be feared,<br> What binds and what emancipates the soul:<br> That is of Sattwan, Prince! of "soothfastness."<br> Marred is the Intellect which, knowing right<br> And knowing wrong, and what is well to do<br> And what must not be done, yet understands<br> Nought with firm mind, nor as the calm truth is:<br> This is of Rajas, Prince! and "passionate!"<br> Evil is Intellect which, wrapped in gloom,<br> Looks upon wrong as right, and sees all things<br> Contrariwise of Truth. O Pritha's Son!<br> That is of Tamas, "dark" and desperate!</p>  
<p>Good is the steadfastness whereby a man<br> Masters his beats of heart, his very breath<br> Of life, the action of his senses; fixed<br> In never-shaken faith and piety:<br> That is of Sattwan, Prince! "soothfast" and fair!<br> Stained is the steadfastness whereby a man<br> Holds to his duty, purpose, effort, end,<br> For life's sake, and the love of goods to gain,<br> Arjuna! 'tis of Raias, passion-stamped!<br> Sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool<br> Cleaves to his sloth, his sorrow, and his fears,<br> His folly and despair. This- Pritha's Son!-<br> Is born of Tamas, "dark" and miserable!</p>  
<p>Hear further, Chief of Bharatas! from Me<br> The threefold kinds of Pleasure which there be.</p>  
<p>Good Pleasure is the pleasure that endures,<br> Banishing pain for aye; bitter at first<br> As poison to the soul, but afterward<br> Sweet as the taste of Amrit. Drink of that!<br> It springeth in the Spirit's deep content.<br> And painful Pleasure springeth from the bond<br> Between the senses and the sense-world. Sweet<br> As Amrit is its first taste, but its last<br> Bitter as poison. 'Tis of Rajas, Prince!<br> And foul and "dark" the Pleasure is which springs<br> From sloth and sin and foolishness; at first<br> And at the last, and all the way of life<br> The soul bewildering. 'Tis of Tamas, Prince!</p>  
<p>For nothing lives on earth, nor 'midst the gods<br> In utmost heaven, but hath its being bound<br> With these three Qualities, by Nature framed.</p>  
<p>The work of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas,<br> And Sudras, O thou Slayer of thy Foes!<br> Is fixed by reason of the Qualities<br> Planted in each:<br> A Brahman's virtues, Prince<br> Born of his nature, are serenity,<br> Self-mastery, religion, purity,<br> Patience, uprightness, learning, and to know<br> The truth of things which be. A Kshatriya's pride,<br> Born of his nature, lives in valour, fire,<br> Constancy, skilfulness, spirit in fight,<br> And open-handedness and noble mien,<br> As of a lord of men. A Vaisya's task,<br> Born with his nature, is to till the ground,<br> Tend cattle, venture trade. A Sudra's state,<br> Suiting his nature, is to minister.</p>  
<p>Whoso performeth- diligent, content-<br> The work allotted him, whate'er it be,<br> Lays hold of perfectness! Hear how a man<br> Findeth perfection, being so content:<br> He findeth it through worship- wrought by work-<br> Of HIM that is the Source of all which lives,<br> Of HIM by Whom the universe was stretched.</p>  
<p>Better thine own work is, though done with fault,<br> Than doing others' work, ev'n excellently.<br> He shall not fall in sin who fronts the task<br> Set him by Nature's hand! Let no man leave<br> His natural duty, Prince! though it bear blame!<br> For every work hath blame, as every flame<br> Is wrapped in smoke! Only that man attains<br> Perfect surcease of work whose work was wrought<br> With mind unfettered, soul wholly subdued,<br> Desires for ever dead, results renounced.</p>  
<p>Learn from me, Son of Kunti! also this,<br> How one, attaining perfect peace, attains<br> BRAHM, the supreme, the highest height of all!</p>  
<p>Devoted- with a heart grown pure, restrained<br> In lordly self-control, forgoing wiles<br> Of song and senses, freed from love and hate,<br> Dwelling 'mid solitudes, in diet spare,<br> With body, speech, and will tamed to obey,<br> Ever to holy meditation vowed,<br> From passions liberate, quit of the Self,<br> Of arrogance, impatience, anger, pride;<br> Freed from surroundings, quiet, lacking nought-<br> Such an one grows to oneness with the BRAHM;<br> Such an one, growing one with BRAHM, serene,<br> Sorrows no more, desires no more; his soul,<br> Equally loving all that lives, loves well<br> Me, Who have made them, and attains to Me.<br> By this same love and worship doth he know<br> Me as I am, how high and wonderful,<br> And knowing, straightway enters into Me.<br> And whatsoever deeds he doeth- fixed<br> In Me, as in his refuge- he hath won<br> For ever and for ever by My grace<br> Th' Eternal Rest! So win thou! In thy thoughts<br> Do all thou dost for Me! Renounce for Me!<br> Sacrifice heart and mind and will to Me!<br> Live in the faith of Me! In faith of Me<br> All dangers thou shalt vanquish, by My grace;<br> But, trusting to thyself and heeding not,<br> Thou can'st but perish! If this day thou say'st,<br> Relying on thyself, "I will not fight!"<br> Vain will the purpose prove! thy qualities<br> Would spur thee to the war. What thou dost shun,<br> Misled by fair illusions, thou wouldst seek<br> Against thy will, when the task comes to thee<br> Waking the promptings in thy nature set.<br> There lives a Master in the hearts of men<br> Maketh their deeds, by subtle pulling-strings,<br> Dance to what tune HE will. With all thy soul<br> Trust Him, and take Him for thy succour, Prince!<br> So- only so, Arjuna!- shalt thou gain-<br> By grace of Him- the uttermost repose,<br> The Eternal Place!<br> Thus hath been opened thee<br> This Truth of Truths, the Mystery more hid<br> Than any secret mystery. Meditate!<br> And- as thou wilt- then act!</p>  
<p>Nay! but once more<br> Take My last word, My utmost meaning have!<br> Precious thou art to Me; right well-beloved!<br> Listen! tell thee for thy comfort this.<br> Give Me thy heart! adore Me! serve Me! cling<br> In faith and love and reverence to Me!<br> So shalt thou come to Me! I promise true,<br> For thou art sweet to Me!<br> And let go those-<br> Rites and writ duties! Fly to Me alone!<br> Make Me thy single refuge! will free<br> Thy soul from all its sins! Be of good cheer!</p>  
<p>[Hide, the holy Krishna saith,<br> This from him that hath no faith,<br> Him that worships not, nor seeks<br> Wisdom's teaching when she speaks:<br> Hide it from all men who mock;<br> But, wherever, 'mid the flock<br> Of My lovers, one shall teach<br> This divinest, wisest, speech-<br> Teaching in the faith to bring<br> Truth to them, and offering<br> Of all honour unto Me-<br> Unto Brahma cometh he!<br> Nay, and nowhere shall ye find<br> Any man of all mankind<br> Doing dearer deed for Me;<br> Nor shall any dearer be<br> In My earth. Yea, furthermore,<br> Whoso reads this converse o'er,<br> Held by Us upon the plain,<br> Pondering piously and fain,<br> He hath paid Me sacrifice!<br> (Krishna speaketh in this wise!)<br> Yea, and whoso, full of faith,<br> Heareth wisely what it saith,<br> Heareth meekly,- when he dies,<br> Surely shall his spirit rise<br> To those regions where the Blest,<br> Free of flesh, in joyance rest.]</p>  
<p>Hath this been heard by thee, O Indian Prince!<br> With mind intent? hath all the ignorance-<br> Which bred thy trouble- vanished, My Arjun?<br> Arjuna. Trouble and ignorance are gone! the Light<br> Hath come unto me, by Thy favour, Lord!<br> Now am I fixed! my doubt is fled away!<br> According to Thy word, so will I do!</p>  
<p><i>Sanjaya.</i> Thus gathered I the gracious speech of Krishna, O my<br> King!<br> Thus have I told, with heart a-thrill, this wise and wondrous thing<br> By great Vyasa's learning writ, how Krishna's self made known<br> The Yoga, being Yoga's Lord. So is the high truth shown!<br> And aye, when I remember, O Lord my King, again<br> Arjuna and the God in talk, and all this holy strain,<br> Great is my gladness: when I muse that splendour, passing speech,<br> Of Hari, visible and plain, there is no tongue to reach<br> My marvel and my love and bliss. O Archer-Prince! all hail!<br> O Krishna, Lord of Yoga! surely there shall not fail<br> Blessing, and victory, and power, for Thy most mighty sake,<br> Where this song comes of Arjun, and how with God he spake.</p>
