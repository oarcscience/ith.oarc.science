</p>  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER IX<br> Of Religion by the Kingly Knowledge and the Kingly Mystery</h1>  
<p><i>Krishna.</i> Now will I open unto thee- whose heart<br> Rejects not- that last lore, deepest-concealed,<br> That farthest secret of My Heavens and Earths,<br> Which but to know shall set thee free from ills,-<br> A royal lore! a Kingly mystery!<br> Yea! for the soul such light as purgeth it<br> From every sin; a light of holiness<br> With inmost splendour shining; plain to see;<br> Easy to walk by, inexhaustible!</p>  
<p>They that receive not this, failing in faith<br> To grasp the greater wisdom, reach not Me,<br> Destroyer of thy foes! They sink anew<br> Into the realm of Flesh, where all things change!</p>  
<p>By Me the whole vast Universe of things<br> Is spread abroad;- by Me, the Unmanifest!<br> In Me are all existences contained;<br> Not I in them!<br> Yet they are not contained,<br> Those visible things! Receive and strive to embrace<br> The mystery majestical! My Being-<br> Creating all, sustaining all- still dwells<br> Outside of all!</p>  
<p>See! as the shoreless airs<br> Move in the measureless space, but are not space,<br> [And space were space without the moving airs];<br> So all things are in Me, but are not I.</p>  
<p>At closing of each Kalpa, Indian Prince!<br> All things which be back to My Being come:<br> At the beginning of each Kalpa, all<br> Issue new-born from Me.</p>  
<p>By Energy<br> And help of Prakriti, my outer Self,<br> Again, and yet again, I make go forth<br> The realms of visible things- without their will-<br> All of them- by the power of Prakriti.</p>  
<p>Yet these great makings, Prince! involve Me not<br> Enchain Me not ! I sit apart from them,<br> Other, and Higher, and Free; nowise attached!</p>  
<p>Thus doth the stuff of worlds, moulded by Me,<br> Bring forth all that which is, moving or still,<br> Living or lifeless! Thus the worlds go on!</p>  
<p>The minds untaught mistake Me, veiled in form;-<br> Naught see they of My secret Presence, nought<br> Of My hid Nature, ruling all which lives.<br> Vain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed<br> On vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek<br> An evil way, the way of brutes and fiends.<br> But My Mahatmas, those of noble soul<br> Who tread the path celestial, worship Me<br> With hearts unwandering,- knowing Me the Source,<br> Th' Eternal Source, of Life. Unendingly<br> They glorify Me; seek Me; keep their vows<br> Of reverence and love, with changeless faith<br> Adoring Me. Yea, and those too adore,<br> Who, offering sacrifice of wakened hearts,<br> Have sense of one pervading Spirit's stress,<br> One Force in every place, though manifold!<br> I am the Sacrifice! I am the Prayer!<br> I am the Funeral-Cake set for the dead!<br> I am the healing herb! I am the ghee,<br> The Mantra, and the flame, and that which burns!<br> I am- of all this boundless Universe-<br> The Father, Mother, Ancestor, and Guard!<br> The end of Learning! That which purifies<br> In lustral water! I am OM! I am<br> Rig-Veda, Sama-Veda, Yajur-Ved;<br> The Way, the Fosterer, the Lord, the Judge,<br> The Witness; the Abode, the Refuge-House,<br> The Friend, the Fountain and the Sea of Life<br> Which sends, and swallows up; Treasure of Worlds<br> And Treasure-Chamber! Seed and Seed-Sower,<br> Whence endless harvests spring! Sun's heat is mine;<br> Heaven's rain is mine to grant or to withhold;<br> Death am I, and Immortal Life I am,<br> Arjuna! SAT and ASAT, Visible Life,<br> And Life Invisible!<br> Yea! those who learn<br> The threefold Veds, who drink the Soma-wine,<br> Purge sins, pay sacrifice- from Me they earn<br> Passage to Swarga; where the meats divine</p>  
<p>Of great gods feed them in high Indra's heaven.<br> Yet they, when that prodigious joy is o'er,<br> Paradise spent, and wage for merits given,<br> Come to the world of death and change once more.</p>  
<p>They had their recompense! they stored their treasure,<br> Following the threefold Scripture and its writ;<br> Who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure<br> Of joy which comes and goes! I grant them it!</p>  
<p>But to those blessed ones who worship Me,<br> Turning not otherwhere, with minds set fast,<br> I bring assurance of full bliss beyond.</p>  
<p>Nay, and of hearts which follow other gods<br> In simple faith, their prayers arise to me,<br> O Kunti's Son! though they pray wrongfully;<br> For I am the Receiver and the Lord<br> Of every sacrifice, which these know not<br> Rightfully; so they fall to earth again!<br> Who follow gods go to their gods; who vow<br> Their souls to Pitris go to Pitris; minds<br> To evil Bhuts given o'er sink to the Bhuts;<br> And whoso loveth Me cometh to Me.<br> Whoso shall offer Me in faith and love<br> A leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth,<br> That offering I accept, lovingly made<br> With pious will. Whate'er thou doest, Prince!<br> Eating or sacrificing, giving gifts,<br> Praying or fasting, let it all be done<br> For Me, as Mine. So shalt thou free thyself<br> From Karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men<br> To good and evil issue, so shalt come<br> Safe unto Me- when thou art quit of flesh-<br> By faith and abdication joined to Me!</p>  
<p>I am alike for all! I know not hate,<br> I know not favour! What is made is Mine!<br> But them that worship Me with love, I love;<br> They are in Me, and I in them!</p>  
<p>Nay, Prince!<br> If one of evil life turn in his thought<br> Straightly to Me, count him amidst the good;<br> He hath the high way chosen; he shall grow<br> Righteous ere long; he shall attain that peace<br> Which changes not. Thou Prince of India!<br> Be certain none can perish, trusting Me!<br> O Pritha's Son! whoso will turn to Me,<br> Though they be born from the very womb of Sin,<br> Woman or man; sprung of the Vaisya caste<br> Or lowly disregarded Sudra,- all<br> Plant foot upon the highest path; how then<br> The holy Brahmans and My Royal Saints?<br> Ah! ye who into this ill world are come-<br> Fleeting and false- set your faith fast on Me!<br> Fix heart and thought on Me! Adore Me! Bring<br> Offerings to Me! Make Me prostrations! Make<br> Me your supremest joy! and, undivided,<br> Unto My rest your spirits shall be guided.</p>  
<p><br> HERE ENDETH CHAPTER IX OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Rajavidyarajaguhyayog,"<br> Or "The Book of Religion by the Kingly Knowledge<br> and the Kingly Mystery." </p>
