<P>I only said, "When in the evening the round full moon gets entangled among the branches of that <I>Kadam</I> tree, couldn't somebody catch it?"</P>
<P>But d&acirc;d&acirc; [<I>elder brother</I>] laughed at me and said, "Baby, you are the silliest child I have ever known. The moon is ever so far from us, how could anybody catch it?"</P>
<P>I said, "D&acirc;d&acirc; how foolish you are! When mother looks out of her window and smiles down at us playing, would you call her far away?"</P>
<P>Still said, "You are a stupid child! But, baby, where could you find a net big enough to catch the moon with?"</P>
<P>I said, "Surely you could catch it with your hands."</P>
<P>But d&acirc;d&acirc; laughed and said, "You are the silliest child I have known. If it came nearer, you would see how big the moon is."</P>
<P>I said, "D&acirc;d&acirc;, what nonsense they teach at your school! When mother bends her face down to kiss us does her face look very big?"</P>
<P>But still d&acirc;d&acirc; says, "You are a stupid child."</P>
