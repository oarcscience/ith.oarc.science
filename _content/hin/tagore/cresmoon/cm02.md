# INDEX OF THE FIRST LINES

Ah, these jasmines  
Ah, who was it coloured that little frock  
Bless this little heart  
Child, how happy you are sitting in the dust  
Come and hire me  
Day by day I float my paper boats  
I am small because I am a little child  
If baby only wanted to, he could fly  
If I were only a little puppy  
If people came to know where my king's palace is  
I long to go over there  
Imagine, mother  
I only said, "When in the evening"  
I paced alone  
It is time for me to go, mother  
I want to give you something, my child  
I wish I could take a quiet corner  
Mother, I do want to leave off my lessons  
Mother, let us imagine we are travelling  
Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds  
Mother, the light has grown grey  
Mother, your baby is silly  
On the seashore of endless worlds  
O you shaggy-headed banyan tree  
Say of him what you please  
Sullen clouds are gathering  
Supposing I became a *champa* flower  
The boat of the boatman Madhu  
The night was dark when we went away  
The sleep that flits on baby's eyes  
They clamour and fight  
This song of mine  
When I bring you coloured toys  
When storm clouds  
When the gong sounds ten  
Where have I come from  
Who stole sleep from baby's eyes  
Why are those tears in your eyes, my child  
Why do you sit there on the floor  
You say that father writes a lot of books
