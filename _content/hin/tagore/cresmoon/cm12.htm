<P>Why are those tears in your eyes, my child?</P>
<P>How horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing?</P>
<P>You have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing--is that why they call you dirty?</P>
<P>O, fie! Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because it has smudged its face with ink?</P>
<P>For every little trifle they blame you, my child. They are ready to find fault for nothing.</P>
<P>You tore your clothes while playing--is that why they call you untidy?</P>
<P>O, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles through its ragged clouds?</P>
<P>Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.</P>
<P>Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.</P>
<P>They make a long list of your misdeeds. Everybody knows how you love sweet things--is that why they call you greedy?</P>
<P>O, fie! What then would they call us who love you?</P>
