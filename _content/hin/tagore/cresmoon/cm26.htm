<P>If I were only a little puppy, not your baby, mother dear, would you say "No" to me if I tried to eat from your dish?</P>
<P>Would you drive me off, saying to me, "Get away, you naughty little puppy?"</P>
<P>Then go, mother, go! I will never come to you when you call me, and never let you feed me any more.</P>
<P>If I were only a little green parrot, and not your baby, mother dear, would you keep me chained lest I should fly away?</P>
<P>Would you shake your finger at me and say, "What an ungrateful wretch of a bird! It is gnawing at its chain day and night?"</P>
<P>Then, go, mother, go! I will run away into the woods; I will never let you take me in your arms again.</P>
