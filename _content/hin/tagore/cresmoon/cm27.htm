<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">VOCATION</H3>
<P>When the gong sounds ten in the morning and I walk to school by our lane,</P>
<P>Every day I meet the hawker crying, "Bangles, crystal bangles!"</P>
<P>There is nothing to hurry him on, there is no road he must take, no place he must go to, no time when he must come home.</P>
<P>I wish I were a hawker, spending my day in the road, crying, "Bangles, crystal bangles!"</P>
<P>When at four in the afternoon I come back from the school,</P>
<P>I can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging the ground.</P>
<P>He does what he likes with his spade, he soils his clothes with dust, nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or gets wet.</P>
<P>I wish I were a gardener digging away at the garden with nobody to stop me from digging.</P>
<P>Just as it gets dark in the evening and my mother sends me to bed,</P>
<P>I can see through my open window the watchman walking up and down.</P>
<P>The lane is dark and lonely, and the street-lamp stands like a giant with one red eye in its head.</P>
<P>The watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at his side, and never once goes to bed in his life.</P>
<P>I wish I were a watchman walking the streets all night, chasing the shadows with my lantern.</P>
