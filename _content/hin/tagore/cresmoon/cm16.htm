<P>Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me--</P>
<P>"We play from the time we wake till the day ends.</P>
<P>We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon.</P>
<P>I ask, "But, how am I to get up to you?" They answer, "Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds."</P>
<P>"My mother is waiting for me at home," I say. "How can I leave her and come?"</P>
<P>Then they smile and float away.</P>
<P>But I know a nicer game than that, mother.</P>
<P>I shall be the cloud and you the moon.</P>
<P>I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will be the blue sky.</P>
<P>The folk who live in the waves call out to me--</P>
<P>"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know not where we pass."</P>
<P>I ask, "But, how am I to join you?" They tell me, "Come to the edge of the shore and stand with your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves."</P>
<P>I say, "My mother always wants me at home in the evening--how can I leave her and go?"</P>
<P>Then they smile, dance and pass by.</P>
<P>But I know a better game than that.</P>
<P>I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.</P>
<P>I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with laughter.</P>
<P>And no one in the world will know where we both are.</P>
