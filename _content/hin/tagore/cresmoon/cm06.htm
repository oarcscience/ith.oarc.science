<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">BABY'S WAY</H3>
<P>If baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment.</P>
<P>It is not for nothing that he does not leave us.</P>
<P>He loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever bear to lose sight of her.</P>
<P>Baby knows all manner of wise words, though few on earth can understand their meaning.</P>
<P>It is not for nothing that he never wants to speak.</P>
<P>The one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from mother's lips. That is why he looks so innocent.</P>
<P>Baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar on to this earth.</P>
<P>It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.</P>
<P>This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly helpless, so that he may beg for mother's wealth of love.</P>
<P>Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny crescent moon.</P>
<P>It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.</P>
<P>He knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little corner of a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught and pressed in her dear arms.</P>
<P>Baby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect bliss.</P>
<P>It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.</P>
<P>Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's yearning heart to him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles weave the double bond of pity and love.</P>
