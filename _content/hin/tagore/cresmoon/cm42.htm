<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE LAST BARGAIN</H3>
<P>"Come and hire me," I cried, while in the morning I was walking on the stone-paved road.</P>
<P>Sword in hand, the King came in his chariot.</P>
<P>He held my hand and said, "I will hire you with my power."</P>
<P>But his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot.</P>
<P>In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors.</P>
<P>I wandered along the crooked lane.</P>
<P>An old man came out with his bag of gold.</P>
<P>He pondered and said, "I will hire you with my money."</P>
<P>He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away.</P>
<P>It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower.</P>
<P>The fair maid came out and said, "I will hire you with a smile."</P>
<P>Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark.</P>
<P>The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly.</P>
<P>A child sat playing with shells.</P>
<P>He raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, "I hire you with nothing."</P>
<P>From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.</P>
