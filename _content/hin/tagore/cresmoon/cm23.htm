<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE FURTHER BANK</H3>
<P>I long to go over there to the further bank of the river,</P>
<P>Where those boats are tied to the bamboo poles in a line;</P>
<P>Where men cross over in their boats in the morning with ploughs on their shoulders to till their far-away fields;</P>
<P>Where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the riverside pasture;</P>
<P>Whence they all come back home in the evening, leaving the jackals to howl in the island overgrown with weeds,</P>
<P>Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferry when I am grown up.</P>
<P>They say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank,</P>
<P>Where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over, and thick reeds grow round the margins where waterbirds lay their eggs;</P>
<P>Where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny footprints upon the clean soft mud;</P>
<P>Where in the evening the tall grasses crested with white flowers invite the moonbeam to float upon their waves.</P>
<P>Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferryboat when I am grown up.</P>
<P>I shall cross and cross back from bank to bank, and all the boys and girls of the village will wonder at me while they are bathing.</P>
<P>When the sun climbs the mid sky and morning wears on to noon, I shall come running to you, saying, "Mother, I am hungry!"</P>
<P>When the day is done and the shadows cower under the trees, I shall come back in the dusk.</P>
<P>I shall never go away from you into the town to work like father.</P>
<P>Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferryboat when I am grown up.</P>
