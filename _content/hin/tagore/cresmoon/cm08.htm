<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">SLEEP-STEALER</H3>
<P>Who stole sleep from baby's eyes? I must know.</P>
<P>Clasping her pitcher to her waist mother went to fetch water from the village near by.</P>
<P>It was noon. The children's playtime was over; the ducks in the pond were silent.</P>
<P>The shepherd boy lay asleep under the shadow of the <I>banyan</I> tree.</P>
<P>The crane stood grave and still in the swamp near the mango grove.</P>
<P>In the meanwhile the Sleep-stealer came and, snatching sleep from baby's eyes, flew away.</P>
<P>When mother came back she found baby travelling the room over on all fours.</P>
<P>Who stole sleep from our baby's eyes? I must know. I must find her and chain her up.</P>
<P>I must look into that dark cave, where, through boulders and scowling stones, trickles a tiny stream.</P>
<P>I must search in the drowsy shade of the <I>bakula</I> grove, where pigeons coo in their corner, and fairies' anklets tinkle in the stillness of starry nights.</P>
<P>In the evening I will peep into the whispering silence of the bamboo forest, where fireflies squander their light, and will ask every creature I meet, "Can anybody tell me where the Sleep-stealer lives?"</P>
<P>Who stole sleep from baby's eyes? I must know.</P>
<P>Shouldn't I give her a good lesson if I could only catch her!</P>
<P>I would raid her nest and see where she hoards all her stolen sleep.</P>
<P>I would plunder it all, and carry it home.</P>
<P>I would bind her two wings securely, set her on the bank of the river, and then let her play at fishing with a reed among the rushes and water-lilies.</P>
<P>When the marketing is over in the evening, and the village children sit in their mothers' laps, then the night birds will mockingly din her ears with:</P>
<P>"Whose sleep will you steal now?"</P>
