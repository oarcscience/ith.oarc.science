<P>Child, how happy you are sitting in the dust, playing with a broken twig all the morning.</P>
<P>I smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig.</P>
<P>I am busy with my accounts, adding up figures by the hour.</P>
<P>Perhaps you glance at me and think, "What a stupid game to spoil your morning with!"</P>
<P>Child, I have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mud-pies.</P>
<P>I seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver.</P>
<P>With whatever you find you create your glad games, I spend both my time and my strength over things I never can obtain.</P>
<P>In my frail canoe I struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that I too am playing a game.</P>
