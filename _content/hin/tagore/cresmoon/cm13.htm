<P>Say of him what you please, but I know my child's failings.</P>
<P>I do not love him because he is good, but because he is my little child.</P>
<P>How should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh his merits against his faults?</P>
<P>When I must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my being.</P>
<P>When I cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him.</P>
<P>I alone have a right to blame and punish, for he only may chastise who loves.</P>
