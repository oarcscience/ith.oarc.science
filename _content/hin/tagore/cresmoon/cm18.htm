<P>If people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish into the air.</P>
<P>The walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold.</P>
<P>The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.</P>
<P>But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is.</P>
<P>It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the <I>tulsi</I> plant stands.</P>
<P>The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable seas.</P>
<P>There is none in the world who can find her but myself.</P>
<P>She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.</P>
<P>She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand, and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.</P>
<P>But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the <I>tulsi</I> plant stands.</P>
<P>When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.</P>
<P>I sit in the corner where the shadows of the walls meet together.</P>
<P>Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she knows where the barber in the story lives.</P>
<P>But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in the story lives.</P>
<P>It is at the corner of the terrace where the pot of the <I>tulsi</I> plant stands.</P>
