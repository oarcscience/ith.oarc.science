<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">BABY'S WORLD</H3>
<P>I wish I could take a quiet corner in the heart of my baby's very own world.</P>
<P>I know it has stars that talk to him, and a sky that stoops down to his face to amuse him with its silly clouds and rainbows.</P>
<P>Those who make believe to be dumb, and look as if they never could move, come creeping to his window with their stories and with trays crowded with bright toys.</P>
<P>I wish I could travel by the road that crosses baby's mind, and out beyond all bounds;</P>
<P>Where messengers run errands for no cause between the kingdoms of kings of no history;</P>
<P>Where Reason makes kites of her laws and flies them, and Truth sets Fact free from its fetters.</P>
