<P>Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running stream.</P>
<P>In big black letters I write my name on them and the name of the village where I live.</P>
<P>I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and know who I am.</P>
<P>I load my little boats with <I>shiuli</I> flowers from our garden, and hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land in the night.</P>
<P>I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the little clouds setting their white bulging sails.</P>
<P>I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down the air to race with my boats!</P>
<P>When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.</P>
<P>The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading is their baskets full of dreams.</P>
