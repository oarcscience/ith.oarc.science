<P>You say that father writes a lot of books, but what he writes I don't understand.</P>
<P>He was reading to you all the evening, but could you really make out what he meant?</P>
<P>What nice stories, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father write like that, I wonder?</P>
<P>Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses?</P>
<P>Has he forgotten them all?</P>
<P>Often when he gets late for his bath you have to go and call him an hundred times.</P>
<P>You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on writing and forgets.</P>
<P>Father always plays at making books.</P>
<P>If ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call me, "what a naughty child!"</P>
<P>If I make the slightest noise, you say, "Don't you see that father's at his work?"</P>
<P>What's the fun of always writing and writing?</P>
<P>When I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does,--a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,--why do you get cross with me, then, mother?</P>
<P>You never say a word when father writes.</P>
<P>When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't seem to mind at all.</P>
<P>But if I take only one sheet to make a boat with, you say, "Child, how troublesome you are!"</P>
<P>What do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black marks all over on both sides?</P>
