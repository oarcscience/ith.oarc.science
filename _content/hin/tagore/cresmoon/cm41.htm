<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE CHILD-ANGEL</H3>
<P>They clamour and fight, they doubt and despair, they know no end to their wranglings.</P>
<P>Let your life come amongst them like a flame of light, my child, unflickering and pure, and delight them into silence.</P>
<P>They are cruel in their greed and their envy, their words are like hidden knives thirsting for blood.</P>
<P>Go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the evening over the strife of the day.</P>
<P>Let them see your face, my child, and thus know the meaning of all things; let them love you and thus love each other.</P>
<P>Come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless, my child. At sunrise open and raise your heart like a blossoming flower, and at sunset bend your head and in silence complete the worship of the day.</P>
