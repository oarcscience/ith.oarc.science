<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE WICKED POSTMAN</H3>
<P>Why do you sit there on the floor so quiet and silent, tell me, mother dear?</P>
<P>The rain is coming in through the open window, making you all wet, and you don't mind it.</P>
<P>Do you hear the gong striking four? It is time for my brother to come home from school.</P>
<P>What has happened to you that you look so strange?</P>
<P>Haven't you got a letter from father to-day?</P>
<P>I saw the postman bringing letters in his bag for almost everybody in the town.</P>
<P>Only, father's letters he keeps to read himself. I am sure the postman is a wicked man.</P>
<P>But don't be unhappy about that, mother dear.</P>
<P>To-morrow is market day in the next village. You ask your maid to buy some pens and papers.</P>
<P>I myself will write all father's letters; you will not find a single mistake.</P>
<P>I shall write from A right up to K.</P>
<P>But, mother, why do you smile?</P>
<P>You don't believe that I can write as nicely as father does!</P>
<P>But I shall rule my paper carefully, and write all the letters beautifully big.</P>
<P>When I finish my writing, do you think I shall be so foolish as father and drop it into the horrid postman's bag?</P>
<P>I shall bring it to you myself without waiting, and letter by letter help you to read my writing.</P>
<P>I know the postman does not like to give you the really nice letters.</P>
