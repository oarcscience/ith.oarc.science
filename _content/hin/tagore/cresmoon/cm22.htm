<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SAILOR</H3>
<P>The boat of the boatman Madhu is moored at the wharf of Rajgunj.</P>
<P>It is uselessly laden with jute, and has been lying there idle for ever so long.</P>
<P>If he would only lend me his boat, I should man her with a hundred oars, and hoist sails, five or six or seven.</P>
<P>I should never steer her to stupid markets. I should sail the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.</P>
<P>But, mother, you won't weep for me in a corner.</P>
<P>I am not going into the forest like Ramachandra to come back only after fourteen years.</P>
<P>I shall become the prince of the story, and fill my boat with whatever I like.</P>
<P>I shall take my friend Ashu with me. We shall sail merrily across the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.</P>
<P>We shall set sail in the early morning light.</P>
<P>When at noontide you are bathing at the pond, we shall be in the land of a strange king.</P>
<P>We shall pass the ford of Tirpurni, and leave behind us the desert of Tep&acirc;ntar.</P>
<P>When we come back it will be getting dark, and I shall tell you of all that we have seen.</P>
<P>I shall cross the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.</P>
