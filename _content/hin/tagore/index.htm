<P>
Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was a Bengali poet, philosopher, artist,
playwright, composer and novelist.
India's first Nobel laureate, Tagore won the 1913 Nobel Prize for Literature.
He composed the text of both India's and Bangladesh's respective
national anthems.
Tagore travelled widely and was friends with many notable 20th century figures
such as <A HREF="../../neu/yeats/index">William Butler Yeats</A>, 
H.G. Wells, Ezra Pound,
and <A HREF="../../aor/einstein/index">Albert Einstein</A>.
While he supported Indian Independence, he often had tactical
disagreements with Gandhi (at one point talking him out of a fast to the death).
His body of literature is deeply sympathetic for the
poor and upholds universal humanistic values.
His poetry drew from traditional Vaisnava folk lyrics and was often
deeply mystical.
