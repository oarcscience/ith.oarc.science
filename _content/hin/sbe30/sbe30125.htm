<p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
<p>This refers again to the same subject, namely what has to be done if there are either more or less mantras than there are acts which they are to accompany. In that case it is here allowed to use as many mantras as there are acts, and to drop the rest of the mantras. Or, if there are less mantras than there are acts, then, after the mantras have been equally divided, the last verse is to be multiplied. For instance, in the Dvikap&acirc;la sacrifice for the two A<I>s</I>vins, the placing of the two kap&acirc;las is accompanied by two mantras. The rest of the mantras enjoined in the prak<I>ri</I>ti is left out. But if there are, for instance, twelve or more ish<I>t</I>ak&acirc;s, bricks, to be placed, while there are only ten mantras, then the mantras are equally divided, and the fifth and tenth to be repeated, as many times as is necessary to equal the number of the ish<I>t</I>ak&acirc;s.</p>

<p>This seems to mean that anything new, peculiar to a Vik<I>ri</I>ti, and not mentioned in the Prak<I>ri</I>ti, should come in at the end, that is, after those portions of the sacrifice which are enjoined in the Prak<I>ri</I>ti.</p>

The exact object of the S&ucirc;tra is not quite clear. Prabhutva is explained by samarthatva, that is, fitness. This would mean, that on account of their fitness, or because they can be used for the object for which they are intended, or, so long as they can be used, the rule applying to them should remain. The commentary explains tantram by tantrat&acirc; or ekat&acirc;. It may mean that the same pots and spits should be used, so long as they fulfil their purpose. The next S&ucirc;tra would then form a natural limitation.</p>

<p>But if there is a different kind of animal, there is difference (in pots and spits), owing to the diversity of cooking.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
<p>If different animals are to be cooked, then there must be different pots for each (pratipa<I>s</I>um), because each requires a different kind of cooking. The commentary adds that, as the reason for using different pots is given, that reason applies also to young and old animals of the same kind (<I>g</I>&acirc;ti), i, e. the young and small animal would require a different pot and a different kind of cooking.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_155">155</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&Ucirc;TRA CLV.</h3>  
<p>At the Vanaspati sacrifice, which is a modification (vik&acirc;ra) of the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t, the addresses (nigama) of the deities should take place in the Y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;, because they are included in the Prak<I>ri</I>ti.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_155_c">155<sup>c</sup></A></FONT></span></p>  
<p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
<p>These nigamas of the deities are not mentioned in the rules of the Vanaspati sacrifice, but they are mentioned in the rules for the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t sacrifice of the Dar<I>s</I>ap&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa, which is the Prak<I>ri</I>ti, and should therefore be taken over. Here again, because a reason is given, it is</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_362"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 362</FONT></A></p>  
<p>understood that the same reason would apply to other portions of Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t also, such as the Dvir abhigh&acirc;ra<I>n</I>a, which is to be retained in the Vanaspati sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_156">156</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&Ucirc;TRA CLVI.</h3>  
<p>The Anv&acirc;rambha<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; or initiatory ceremony does not take place in a Vik<I>ri</I>ti, because the Vik<I>ri</I>tis would fall within the time of the Prak<I>ri</I>ti, and the Anv&acirc;rambha<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; has but one object, namely (the initiation of) the Dar<I>s</I>a-p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_156_c">156<sup>c</sup></A></FONT></span></p>  
<p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
<p>The Anv&acirc;rambha<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; ceremony has to be performed by those who begin the Dar<I>s</I>a-p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa sacrifice. It has thus one object only, and is never enjoined for any other cause. It is not therefore transferred to any Vik<I>ri</I>ti, such as the Saurya ceremony, &amp;c. The Dar<I>s</I>a-p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa sacrifice having to be performed during the whole of life, or during thirty years, the Vik<I>ri</I>tis would necessarily fall within the same space of time. The initiatory ceremony has reference to the Dar<I>s</I>a-p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa sacrifice only, and thus serves as an introduction to all the Vik<I>ri</I>tis, without having to be repeated for each.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_157">157</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&Ucirc;TRA CLVII.</h3>  
<p>Or (according to others) the Anv&acirc;rambha<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; should take place (in the Vik<I>ri</I>tis also), because the time (of the Dar<I>s</I>a-p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa) does not form an essential part.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_157_c">157<sup>c</sup></A></FONT></span></p>  
<p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
<p>This S&ucirc;tra is not quite clear. It shows clearly enough that, according to some authorities, the Anv&acirc;rambha<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; or initiatory ceremony of the Dar<I>s</I>a-p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa sacrifice should take place in the Vik<I>ri</I>tis also; but why? Because the time has not the character of a <I>s</I>esha, which is said to be a synonym of a&#7749;ga, an essential part of a sacrifice.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_363"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 363</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> When it is said that the Dar<I>s</I>a-p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa should be performed during life, this is not meant as determining the time of the sacrifice. It only means that so long as there is life a man should perform these sacrifices, and that their non-performance would constitute a sin. The former argument, therefore, that the time of the Vik<I>ri</I>ti sacrifices would fall within the time of the Prak<I>ri</I>ti sacrifice is not tenable.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_158">158</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&Ucirc;TRA CLVIII.</h3>  
<p>And again, because there is difference in the undertaking.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_158_c">158<sup>c</sup></A></FONT></span></p>  
<p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
<p>&Acirc;rambha, the beginning, is explained as the determination to perform a certain sacrifice (dar<I>s</I>ap&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;s&acirc;bhy&acirc;y<I>m</I> yakshya iti ni<I>s</I><I>k</I>ayapura<I>h</I>sara<I>h</I> sa&#7749;kalpa<I>h</I>). The object of the undertaking in the case of the Dar<I>s</I>a-p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa sacrifice, as the Prak<I>ri</I>ti, is simply svarga, in the Vik<I>ri</I>tis it may be any kind of desire. Therefore the Anv&acirc;rambha<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; ceremony of the Dar<I>s</I>a-p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sas should be transferred to its Vik<I>ri</I>tis. This seems to have been the opinion of the same authorities who are referred to in S&ucirc;tra CLVII. The final outcome of the whole controversy, however, is clearly that our &Acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya is in favour of omitting the Anv&acirc;rambha<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; in the Vik<I>ri</I>tis. Anayo<I>h</I> pakshayor anv&acirc;rambha<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc;bh&acirc;vapakshasyaiva balavattvam &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ry&acirc;bhilashitam iti many&acirc;mahe. The Anv&acirc;rambha<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; is not to be considered as an ordinary A&#7749;ga, but as a special act to fit the sacrificer to perform the Dar<I>s</I>a-p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa and to perform it through the whole of his life.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_159">159</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&Ucirc;TRA CLIX.</h3>  
<p>For every object (new sacrifice) let him bring forward the fire (let him perform the Agnipra<I>n</I>ayana, the fetching of the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya from the G&acirc;rhapatya fire). When the sacrifice is finished</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_364"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 364</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the fire becomes again ordinary fire, as when the (divine) fire has returned (to the firesticks).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_159_c">159<sup>c</sup></A></FONT></span></p>  
<p align="center"><b>Commentary.</b></p>  
<p>The fire for a sacrifice is supposed to be set apart or consecrated (<I>s</I>&acirc;str&icirc;ya), but it is so for a special sacrifice only, and when that sacrifice is ended, it is supposed to become like ordinary fire again. Artha is prayo<I>g</I>ana, the sacrifice for which the fire is intended (agnis&acirc;dhyavihitakarm&acirc;nush<I>th</I>&acirc;nam; tasya&nbsp;tasya vihitasya karma<I>n</I>o<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>nush<I>th</I>&acirc;n&acirc;rtha<I>m</I> g&acirc;rhapaty&acirc;dibhya &acirc;havan&icirc;y&acirc;dyagnim pra<I>n</I>ayet). The commentator remarks that there are two Agnis, the one who is visible, the other who is the god. Now while the divine Agni leaves the coals and ascends or is absorbed again in the two firesticks (ara<I>n</I>&icirc;), the other remains like ordinary kitchen fire. See on Sam&acirc;roha<I>n</I>a, Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 311; &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-<I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra III, 10, 4-5.</p>
