*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 1, SECTION 4.

1\. 'The four divine quarters of the heaven, the consorts of Wind, whom
the sun surveys: to their

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

long life I turn thee; may consumption go away to destruction!'

2. <span id="fr_652"></span>[2](#fn_652) Having placed (him there) he
addresses (his wife with the Mantra), 'May no demon do harm to thy son,
no cow that rushes upon him (?). Mayst thou become the friend of
treasures; mayst thou live in prosperity in thy own way.'

3\. He washes her right breast and makes her give it to the child with
(the formula), 'May this boy suckle long life; may he reach old age. Let
thy breast be exuberant for him, and life, glory, renown, splendour,
strength.'

4\. In the same way the left breast.

5\. With (the words), 'He does not suffer, he does not cry, when we
speak to him and when we touch him'—he touches both breasts. Then he
places a covered water-pot near her head, with (the formula), 'O waters,
watch in the house. As you watch with the gods, thus watch over this
wife, the mother of a good son.'

6\. On the twelfth day the mother and the son take a bath.

7\. They make the house clean.

8. <span id="fr_653"></span>[8](#fn_653) They take the Sûtikâgni away,
and they bring the Aupâsana fire.

9\. Having put wood on that fire, and having performed the rites down to
the Vyâh*ri*ti oblations, they sacrifice twelve oblations with the
verses, 'May Dhât*ri* give us wealth' (III, 3, II, 2-5); according to
some (teachers they make) thirteen (oblations).

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

10\. 'This, O Varu*n*a' (&c.; see I, chap. 27, Sûtra 2, down to): 'Hail!
Good luck!' Then let him give a name to the child, of two syllables or
of four syllables, beginning with a sonant, with a semi-vowel in it,
with a long vowel (or) the Visarga at its end, or a name that contains
the particle su, for such a name has a firm foundation; thus it is
understood.

11. <span id="fr_654"></span>[11](#fn_654) Let the father and the mother
pronounce (that name) first. For it is understood, 'My name first, O
*G*âtavedas.'

12\. He should give him two names. For it is understood (Taitt. Sa*m*h.
VI, 3, I, 3), 'Therefore a Brâhma*n*a who has two names, will have
success.'

13. <span id="fr_655"></span>[13](#fn_655) The second name should be a
Nakshatra name.

14\. The one name should be secret; by the other they should call him.

15\. He should give him the name Somayâ*g*in (i.e. performer of Soma
sacrifices) as his third name; thus it is understood.

16\. When he returns from a journey, or when his son returns, he touches
him with (the formula), 'With Soma's lustre I touch thee, with Agni's
splendour, with the glory of the sun.'

17. <span id="fr_656"></span>[17](#fn_656) With (the formula), 'With the
hu*m*kâra (the mystical syllable hu*m*) of the cattle I kiss thee, N.N.!
For the sake of long life and of glory! Hu*m*!' he

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

kisses his head. Then he seizes with his right hand (his son's) right
hand together with the thumb, with the five sections, 'Agni is
long-lived.'

18. <span id="fr_657"></span>[18](#fn_657) 'May Agni bestow on thee long
life everywhere' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 3, 14, 4)—this (verse) he murmurs in
(his son's) right ear as above.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[214:2](sbe30076.htm#fr_652) 4, 2. I am not
certain about the translation of dhenur atisâri*n*î. The Âpastambîya
Mantrapâ*th*a has atyâ*k*âri*n*î. Atisârin means, suffering from
diarrhoea; perhaps we should read abhisâri*n*î.

my mother have given me in the beginning' (pitâ mâtâ *k*a dadhatur yad
agre).
