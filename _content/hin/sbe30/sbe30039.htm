<P><A NAME="fn_422"></A><A HREF="sbe30039.htm#fr_422">120:1</A> 7, 1 seq. Comp. Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 2, 6 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_423"></A><A HREF="sbe30039.htm#fr_423">121:19</A> 19-21. I have translated the words of these S&ucirc;tras without trying to express any meaning. According to the commentary the meaning is the following: 19. He should not build a house which has its door on the back-side, or which has one front-door and one back-door. 20. The house-door should not face the door of another house. 21. The house-door should be so constructed that the householder cannot be seen by <I>K</I>&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;las, &amp;c., when he is performing religious acts or when dining in his house. Or, if instead of sa<I>m</I>lok&icirc; the reading sa<I>m</I>loki is accepted, the S&ucirc;tra means: the house-door should be so constructed, that valuable objects, &amp;c., which are in the house, cannot be seen by passers-by.&#151;The commentary on Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 2, 15 contains the remark: dv&acirc;radvaya<I>m</I> (var. lectio, dv&acirc;ra<I>m</I>&nbsp;dv&acirc;ra<I>m</I>) parasparam <I>ri</I><I>g</I>u na sy&acirc;d iti ke<I>k</I>it. This seems to me to lead to the right understanding of these S&ucirc;tras. I think we ought to read and to divide in this way: (19) anudv&acirc;ra<I>m</I> <I>k</I>a. (20. 21) g<I>ri</I>hadv&acirc;ra<I>m</I> yath&acirc; na sa<I>m</I>loki sy&acirc;t. 'And (let him construct) a back-door, so that it does not face the (chief) house-door.' The Kh&acirc;dira MSS. have the readings, asallok&icirc;, asandraloke, sa<I>m</I>loka.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_424"></A><A HREF="sbe30039.htm#fr_424">122:22</A> 22-24. These are <I>S</I>lokas to which the commentary very appropriately, though not exactly in the sense in which it was originally set down, applies the dictum so frequently found in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts: na hy ekasm&acirc;d akshar&acirc;d vir&acirc;dhayanti. Dr. Knauer's attempts to restore correct <I>S</I>lokas are perhaps a little hazardous; he inserts in the third verse <I>k</I>a after plakshas, and in the second he changes the first br&ucirc;y&acirc;t into <I>k</I>a, whereby the second foot of the hemistich loses its regular shape <A NAME="img_12200"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/12200.jpg">, and receives instead of it the form <A NAME="img_12201"></A>

<P><A NAME="fn_425"></A><A HREF="sbe30039.htm#fr_425">122:25</A> He should remove an A<I>s</I>vattha tree from the east-side, &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_426"></A><A HREF="sbe30039.htm#fr_426">122:26</A> He should sacrifice to the deities to whom the transplanted trees are sacred.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_427"></A><A HREF="sbe30039.htm#fr_427">122:27</A> 27 seq. Here begins the description of the v&acirc;stu<I>s</I>amana, which extends to S&ucirc;tra 43. As to the animal sacrifice prescribed in this S&ucirc;tra, comp. Dr. Winternitz's essay, Einige Bemerkungen &uuml;ber das Bauopfer bei den Indern (Sitzungsbericht der Anthrop. Gesellschaft in Wien, 19 April, 1887), p. 8.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_429"></A><A HREF="sbe30039.htm#fr_429">123:36</A> The commentary says: 'The last oblation should be offered with the formula, "To Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati sv&acirc;h&acirc;!"' Probably we ought to correct the text, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pata ity uttam&acirc;, 'the last (verse) is, "Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati!" (MB. II, 5, 8);' see above, IV, 6, 9; Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 2, 20.</P>
