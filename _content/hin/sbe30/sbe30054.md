### PA*T*ALA 3, SECTION 11.

1\. He puts on the two ear-rings, the right one to his right ear, the
left one to his left ear, with (the verse which he repeats for each of
the two earrings), 'Virâ*g* and Svarâ*g*, and the aiding powers that
dwell in our house, the prosperity that dwells in the face of royalty:
therewith unite me.'

2. <span id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_554) With (the Mantra), 'With the
seasons and the combinations of seasons, for the sake of long life, of

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

splendour, with the sap that dwells in the year: therewith we make them
touch the jaws'—he clasps the two ear-rings.

3. <span id="fr_555"></span>[3](#fn_555) With (the Mantra), 'This herb
is protecting, overcoming, and powerful. May it make me shine with
golden lustre; (may it make me) beloved among many people; may it make
me full of holy lustre. Thou art not a bond'—he ties the pellet (of
wood, mentioned above, Section 10, Sûtra 6) to his neck.

4. <span id="fr_556"></span>[4](#fn_556) He puts on a wreath with the
two (verses),

'Beautiful one, elevate thyself to beauty, beautifying my face. Beautify
my face and make my fortune increase'—(and),

'(The wreath) which *G*amadagni has brought to *S*raddhâ to please her,
that I put on (my head) together with fortune and splendour.'

5. <span id="fr_557"></span>[5](#fn_557) 'The salve coming from the
Trikakud (mountain), born on the Himavat, therewith I anoint you (i.e.
the eyes), and with fortune and splendour. (I put?) into myself the
demon of the mountain (?)'—with (this verse) he anoints himself with
Traikakuda salve, (or) if he cannot get that, with some other (salve).

6\. With (the verse), 'My mind that has fled away' (Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ VI,
6, 7, 2) he looks into a mirror.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

7. <span id="fr_558"></span>[7](#fn_558) With (the formula), 'On the
impulse of the god,' &c., he takes a staff of reed (which somebody hands
him), and with (the formula), 'Thou art the thunderbolt of Indra. O
A*s*vins, protect me!'—he thrice wipes it off, upwards from below.

8\. With (the formula), 'Speed! Make speed away from us those who hate
us, robbers, creeping things, beasts of prey, Rakshas, Pi*s*â*k*as.
Protect us, O staff, from danger that comes from men; protect us from
every danger; from all sides destroy the robbers'—(and with the verse),
'Not naked (i.e. covered with bark) thou art born on all trees, a
destroyer of foes. Destroy all hosts of enemies from every side like
Maghavan (Indra)'—he swings (the staff) three times from left to right
over his head.

9. <span id="fr_559"></span>[9](#fn_559) With (the formula), 'The divine
standing-places are you. Do not pinch me'—he steps into the shoes.

10. <span id="fr_560"></span>[10](#fn_560) With (the formula),
'Pra*g*âpati's shelter art thou, the Brahman's covering'—he takes the
parasol.

11. <span id="fr_561"></span>[11](#fn_561) With the verse, 'My staff
which fell down in the open air to the ground, that I take up again for
the sake of long life, of holiness, of holy lustre'—he takes up his
staff, if it has fallen from his hand.

End of the Third Pa*t*ala.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_554"></span>[167:2](sbe30054.htm#fr_554) 11, 2. The end of
the Mantra is corrupt. We ought to read, as <span id="page_168">p.
168</span> Dr. Kirste has shown, tena sa*m*hanu k*ri*nmasi (Av. V, 28,
13). Mât*ri*datta says, sa*m*g*ri*h*n*îte<sup>ऽ</sup>pidhânenâpidadhâti
pratigrahasa*m*graha*n*ayo*h* sa*m*yuktatvâd ekâpavargatvât.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[168:3](sbe30054.htm#fr_555) The Mantra, with
the exception of the last words, is identical with the last verse of
Section 10, Sûtra 6. Here the MSS. again have oshadhe for oshadhis.

VI, 137: yâ*m* *G*amadagnir akhanad duhitre, &c.; Pâraskara II, 6, 23.

Traikakuda salve, comp. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 69, and see
Atharva-veda IV, 9, 9.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[169:7](sbe30054.htm#fr_558) He takes the staff
with the well-known Sâvitra formula, 'On the impulse of the god
Savit*ri* . . . I take thee.'

<span id="fn_561"></span>[169:11](sbe30054.htm#fr_561) Instead of
yamâyushe I propose to read âyushe. Comp. Pâraskara II, 2, 12.
