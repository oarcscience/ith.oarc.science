<p>1.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_785"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> With the next (verse, II, 18, 10) he has the &Icirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;na led to the southern (hut),</p>  
<p>2. With worldly words the 'bountiful goddess' to the northern (hut),</p>  
<p>3. To the middle (between the two huts) the 'conqueror.'</p>  
<p>4. He gives them water to drink in the same order in which they have been led (to their places), takes three portions of boiled rice (from the Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka prepared for &Icirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;na), takes (these portions of rice) to the fire, makes (the three gods) touch them with the next (formulas, II, 18, II-13), sacrifices of these portions, to each god of the portion which belongs to him, with the next (formulas, II, 18, 14-30), cuts off (Avad&acirc;nas) from all (portions), and sacrifices with the next Ya<I>g</I>us (II, 18, 31) to Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t.</p>  
<p>5. Having worshipped (the god &Icirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;na) with the next Ya<I>g</I>us (II, 18, 32), he distributes with the next (formulas, II, 18, 33-39) leaves together with portions of boiled rice, two (leaves) with each (Ya<I>g</I>us), then ten to the divine hosts (II, 18, 40), and ten to the (divine hosts) that follow (and are referred to in the next Ya<I>g</I>us, II, 18, 41).</p>

<p>6. With the next (formulas, II, 18, 42-45) he does the same as before (i.e. he distributes two leaves with each Mantra).</p>  
<p>7. Having formed a lump of boiled rice, he puts it into a basket of leaves, and with the next Ya<I>g</I>us (II, 18, 46) hangs it up on a tree.</p>  
<p>8. Here he should murmur the Rudra texts (Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. IV, 5),</p>  
<p>9. Or the first and last (Anuv&acirc;ka).</p>  
<p>10. He places his cows around the fire so that the smoke (of the sacrifice) may reach them.</p>  
<p>11.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_786"></A><A HREF="#fn_786"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> With his firmly shut fist full of Darbha grass he besprinkles (them) with scents; the bull first.</p>  
<p>12. He should perform a sacrifice to Kshetrapati, without a fire, in the path used by his cows.</p>  
<p>13. He has (the Kshetrapati) led to his place in the same way as the &Icirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;na (see above, S&ucirc;tra 1).</p>  
<p>14. He puts (portions of boiled rice) into four or seven leaves, naming (the god).</p>  
<p>15.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> Let him sacrifice quickly; the god has a strong digestion (?).</p>  
<p>16. With the next two (verses, II, 18, 47. 48) he does worship (to Kshetrapati).</p>  
<p>17. The Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka (belonging to &Icirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;na) he gives to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as to eat;</p>  
<p>18. That belonging to Kshetrapati his uterine relations eat,</p>  
<p>19. Or as is the custom in their family.</p>
