#### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 4.

1. <span id="fr_300"></span>[1](#fn_300) A student, after he has studied
the Veda,

2\. And has offered a present to his Guru (i.e. to his) teacher,

3. <span id="fr_301"></span>[3](#fn_301) Should, with the permission (of
his parents), take a wife,

4\. One who does not belong to the same Gotra,

5. <span id="fr_302"></span>[5](#fn_302) And who is not a Sapi*nd*a
relation of his mother.

6. <span id="fr_303"></span>[6](#fn_303) The best, however, is a 'naked'
girl.

7. <span id="fr_304"></span>[7](#fn_304) Now the bath (which is taken at
the end of studentship, will be described).

8\. To the north or the east of the teacher's house there is an
enclosure.

9\. There the teacher sits down, facing the north, on eastward-pointed
Darbha grass;

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

10\. Facing the east the student on northward-pointed Darbha grass.

11\. The teacher should besprinkle (him) with lukewarm, scented water,
which has been boiled with all kinds of herbs.

12\. But as if he (i.e. the student, should do so) himself—

13. <span id="fr_305"></span>[13](#fn_305) (In such a way) he is alluded
to in the Mantras; (therefore the besprinkling should be done rather by
the student, and not by the teacher \[?\]).

14\. With (the verse), 'The fires which dwell in the waters' (MB. I, 7,
1)—(the student\[?\]) pours his joined hands full of water (on the
ground),

15\. And again with (the formula), 'What is dreadful in the waters, what
is cruel in the waters, what is turbulent in the waters' (ibid. 2).

16\. With (the formula), 'The shining one I take here' (ibid. 3)—he
besprinkles himself.

17\. And again with (the formula), 'For the sake of glory, of splendour'
(ibid. 4).

18\. And again with (the verse), 'By which you made the wife
(pregnant?') (ibid. 5).

19\. A fourth time silently.

20\. He then should rise and should worship the sun with the Mantra,
'Rising with (the Maruts) who bear shining spears' (ibid. 6-9), &c.

21. <span id="fr_306"></span>[21](#fn_306) Optionally he may use the
single sections of

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

the Mantra separately (in the morning, at noon, and in the evening) as
indicated in the text.

22\. He should add (the formula), 'The eye art thou' (ibid. 9) after
(each of the three sections of the Mantra, 6-8).

23\. With the verse, 'Loosen the highest fetter, O Varu*n*a' (ibid. 10),
he takes off the girdle.

24\. After he has entertained the Brâhma*n*as with food and has eaten
himself, he should have his hair, his beard, the hair of his body, and
his nails cut, so as to leave the lock of hair (as required by the
custom of his family).

25\. Having bathed and adorned himself, and having put on two garments
(an under-garment and an upper-garment) which have not yet been washed,
he should put a garland (on his head) with (the formula), 'Luck art
thou; take delight in me' (ibid. 11).

26\. The two shoes (he puts on) with (the formula), 'Leaders are you;
lead me' (ibid. 12).

27\. With (the formula), 'The Gandharva art thou' (ibid. 13), he takes a
bamboo staff.

28\. He approaches the teacher together with the assembly (of his
pupils) and looks at the assembly of his teacher's (pupils) with (the
words), 'Like an eye-ball may I be dear to you' (ibid. 14).

29\. Sitting down near (the teacher) he touches the sense-organs at his
head with (the verse), 'The she-ichneumon, covered by the lips' (ibid.
15).

30\. Here the teacher should honour him with the Argha ceremony.

31\. (The student then) should approach a chariot yoked with oxen, and
should touch its two side-pieces or the two arms of the chariot-pole
with

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the verse), 'O
tree, may thy limbs be strong' (ibid. 16).

32\. With (the last words of that verse), 'May he who stands on thee,
win what can be won'—he mounts it.

33\. Having driven (some distance) in an easterly or northerly
direction, he turns round from left to right and comes back (to his
teacher).

34. <span id="fr_307"></span>[34](#fn_307) When he has come back, the
Argha ceremony should be performed (for him by his teacher), say the
Kauhalîyas.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_300"></span>[82:1](sbe30026.htm#fr_300) 4, 1 seq. The
description given in this chapter of the Samâvartana, or of the ceremony
performed at the end of studentship, is opened with a few sentences
referring to another section of the G*ri*hya ritual, namely, to
marriage. It seems to me that these first Sûtras of this chapter once
formed, in a text from which Gobhila has taken them, the introduction to
an exposition of the wedding ceremonies, and that Gobhila was induced to
transfer them to the description of the Samâvartana, by their opening
words, 'A student, after he has studied the Veda, &c.' With Sûtras 1-3,
comp. Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 3, 1.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[82:3](sbe30026.htm#fr_301) I prefer to supply,
(with the permission) of his parents, and not, of his teacher.
Hira*n*yake*s*in says, samâv*ri*tta â*k*âryakulât mâtâpitarau
bibh*ri*yât, tâbhyâm anu*gñ*âto bhâryâm upaya*kkh*et.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[82:5](sbe30026.htm#fr_302) Regarding the term
Sapi*nd*a, see, for instance, Gautama XIV, 13 (S.B.E. II, 247):
'Sapi*nd*a-relationship ceases with the fifth or the seventh
(ancestor).' Comp. Manu V, 60.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[82:6](sbe30026.htm#fr_303) According to the
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha (II, 1 7. 18), a 'naked' girl is one who has not yet
the monthly period, or whose breast is not yet developed. Comp.
Vasish*th*a XVII, 70; Gautama XVIII, 23.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[82:7](sbe30026.htm#fr_304) 7 seqq. Comp.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya III, 1, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[83:13](sbe30026.htm#fr_305) In the Mantras
prescribed for the besprinkling of the student (Mantra-Brâhma*n*a I, 7,
1 seq.) there occur passages such as, for instance, 'Therewith I, N.N.,
besprinkle myself.'

<span id="fn_306"></span>[83:21](sbe30026.htm#fr_306) He may use the
first section of the Mantra, which contains the word prâtar, in the
morning, &c.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[85:34](sbe30026.htm#fr_307) Instead of its
being performed at the time stated in Sûtra 30.
