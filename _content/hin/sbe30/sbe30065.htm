<p>6. When (the bridegroom with his bride) has come to his house, he says to her, 'Cross (the threshold) with thy right foot first; do not stand on the threshold.'</p>  
<p>7. In the hall, in its easterly part, he puts down the fire and puts wood on it.</p>  
<p>8. To the west of the fire he spreads out a red bull's skin with the neck to the east, with the hair outside.</p>
