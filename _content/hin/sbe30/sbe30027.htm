<p>2. Here the teachers enumerate the following (regulations).</p>  
<p>3. N&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;talomnyopah&acirc;sam i<I>k</I><I>kh</I>et.</p>

<p>14. Let him not gather fruits himself.</p>  
<p>15. He should not wear a scentless wreath,</p>  
<p>16. If it is not a wreath of gold.</p>  
<p>17. (He should not wear a wreath) of which the expression m&acirc;l&acirc; (garland) has been used.</p>

<p>19. He should avoid using the word bhadra ('blessed') without a reason.</p>  
<p>20.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_309"></A><A HREF="#fn_309"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> He should say (instead of it), mandra ('lovely').</p>  
<p>21.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_310"></A><A HREF="#fn_310"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A> There are three (kinds of) Sn&acirc;takas:</p>  
<p>22. A Vidy&acirc;sn&acirc;taka (or a Sn&acirc;taka by knowledge), a Vratasn&acirc;taka (or a Sn&acirc;taka by the completion of his vow), and a Vidy&acirc;vratasn&acirc;taka (i.e. Sn&acirc;taka by both).</p>

<p>28. Nor of what he has not heard, as if he had heard it.</p>  
<p>29. He should give up everything that forms an impediment for his Veda-recitation.</p>

<p>35. He should not enter the village by a by-path.</p>

The commentator of course tries to defend Gobhila, but I think he has not succeeded. Probably Gobhila has taken the two S&ucirc;tras from different texts on which his own composition seems to be based.</P>
