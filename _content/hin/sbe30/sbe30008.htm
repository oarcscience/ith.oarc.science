<p>4. And on that day on which the moon is not seen, (he should fast, considering it) as the new-moon day.</p>

<p>9. Sometimes he may also while (the moon) is (still) visible (accept it as the day of new-moon); for (already then the moon) has made its way.</p>  
<p>10.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> The time of full-moon is reckoned in three ways: (when the full moon rises at) the meeting (of day and night), or when it rises after sunset, or when it stands high (in the sky at sunset).</p>

<p>13. Now on the day which is the fast-day, on that day, in the forenoon, having offered his morning oblation, he besmears that surface on which the fire is placed, on all sides with cow-dung.</p>  
<p>14. He then gets the pieces of wood ready (which are to be put on the fire)&#151;of Khadira or of Pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a wood.</p>  
<p>15.

<p>16. The Barhis consists of Ku<I>s</I>a grass cut off at the points at which the blades diverge from the main stalk.</p>  
<p>17. (The blades should be) cut off near the roots at (the ceremonies directed to) the Fathers.</p>  
<p>18. If that (i.e. Ku<I>s</I>a grass) cannot be obtained, (he may take) any kind of grass, with the exception of <I>S</I>&ucirc;ka grass, of Saccharum reed, of such grass as is apt to break, of Balba<I>g</I>a grass, of Mutava, of Amphidonax reed, of <I>S</I>u<I>n</I><I>th</I>a.</p>

The first twelve S&ucirc;tras of this chapter have been translated by Professor Weber, Ueber den Vedakalender namens Jyotisham, pp. 50 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_135"></A><A HREF="sbe30008.htm#fr_135">25:2</A> See the note below at S&ucirc;tra 10.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_136"></A><A HREF="sbe30008.htm#fr_136">25:3</A> With these two S&ucirc;tras, 'sandhy&acirc;<I>m</I> paur<I>n</I>am&acirc;s&icirc;m upavaset; uttar&acirc;m ity eke,' a passage should be compared which is identically found in the Aitareya (VII, 11), and in the Kaush&icirc;taka Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (III, 1): p&ucirc;rv&acirc;<I>m</I> paur<I>n</I>am&acirc;s&icirc;m upavased iti Pai&#7749;gyam, uttar&acirc;m iti Kaush&icirc;takam.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_137"></A><A HREF="sbe30008.htm#fr_137">25:6</A> The month is reckoned here, as is usually done, as beginning with the fortnight of the increasing moon.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_138"></A><A HREF="sbe30008.htm#fr_138">26:7</A> Here begins a new exposition of the question of full and new moon which stands independently by the side of the former sections, and which Gobhila has not taken much care to weld together with them. Comp. S&ucirc;tra to with S&ucirc;tras 2 and 3, and S&ucirc;tra 8 with S&ucirc;tra 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_139"></A><A HREF="sbe30008.htm#fr_139">26:10</A> The first of the three times is that mentioned in S&ucirc;tra 2. It seems to me not very safe to interpret sandhy&acirc; in that modern sense, in which sandhi is used, for instance, in the verse quoted by M&acirc;dhava, Weber, Jyotisha 51, so that it designates the meeting-point of the bright and of the dark fortnight ('&acirc;vartane yad&acirc; sandhi<I>h</I> parvapratipador bhavet,' &amp;c.). If sandhy&acirc; were that, we should expect that the same word would occupy a similar position in the definition of am&acirc;v&acirc;sy&acirc;. I prefer, therefore, with the commentary, to understand sandhy&acirc; in its ancient sense, as the time which divides day from night. Thus sandhy&acirc; paur<I>n</I>am&acirc;s&icirc;, the full-moon day, on which the moon rises at the meeting of day and night, stands in opposition to uttar&acirc; paur<I>n</I>am&acirc;s&icirc; (S&ucirc;tra 2), or to astamitodit&acirc; (scil. paur<I>n</I>am&acirc;s&icirc;, S&ucirc;tra 10), exactly in the same way as in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a passages quoted above (note on &sect; 3) p&ucirc;rv&acirc; paur<I>n</I>am&acirc;s&icirc; is opposed to uttar&acirc; paur<I>n</I>am&acirc;s&icirc;. The second and third cases are those of the full moon rising (shortly) after sunset, and of the moon becoming full when standing high in the sky.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_140"></A><A HREF="sbe30008.htm#fr_140">27:19</A> As to anugupt&acirc; &acirc;pa<I>h</I>, see above, chap. I, 9.</P>
