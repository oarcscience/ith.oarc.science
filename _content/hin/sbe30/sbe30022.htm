<p>7. On the day on which the youth is going to receive the initiation, on that day, early in the morning, they give him to eat, and have his hair arranged, and wash him, and deck him with ornaments, and put on him a (new) garment which has not yet been washed.</p>

<p>17. Between the fire and the teacher the student (stands), raising his joined hands, turning his face towards the teacher, on northward-pointed Darbha grass.</p>  
<p>18. Standing on his south side a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a versed in the Mantras fills (the student's) joined hands with water,</p>  
<p>19. And afterwards (those) of the teacher.</p>  
<p>20. Looking (at the student the teacher) murmurs (the verse), 'With him who comes to us, we have come together' (MB. I, 6, 14).</p>  
<p>21. He causes (the student) to say, 'I have come hither to studentship' (ibid. 16).</p>

<p>27. He then makes him turn round from left to right with (the formula), 'Move in the sun's course after him, N.N.!' (ibid. 19).</p>  
<p>28. Grasping down with his right hand over his right shoulder he should touch his uncovered navel with (the formula), 'Thou art the knot of all breath' (ibid. 20).</p>  
<p>29. Raising himself (from the position implied in S&ucirc;tra 28, he should touch) the place near the navel with (the formula), 'Ahura' (ibid. 21).</p>  
<p>30. Raising himself (still more, he should touch) the place of the heart with (the formula), 'K<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ana' (ibid. 22).</p>  
<p>31. Having touched from behind with his right hand (the student's) right shoulder with (the formula), 'I give thee in charge to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, N.N.!' (ibid. 23)&#151;</p>  
<p>32. And with his left (hand) the left (shoulder) with (the formula), 'I give thee in charge to the god Savit<I>ri</I>, N.N.!' (ibid. 24)&#151;</p>

<p>the fire, the teacher sits down to the east, on northward-pointed Darbha grass,</p>  
<p>36. The student to the west, bending his right knee, turning his face towards the teacher, also on northward-pointed Darbha grass.</p>  
<p>37. (The teacher) then ties round (the student) thrice from left to right the girdle made of Mu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>a grass and causes him to repeat (the verse), 'Protecting us from evil word' (ibid. 27), and (the verse), 'The protectress of right' (ibid. 28).</p>  
<p>38. Then (the student) respectfully sits down near (the teacher) with (the words), 'Recite, sir! May the reverend one recite the S&acirc;vitr&icirc; to me.'</p>  
<p>39. He then recites (the S&acirc;vitr&icirc;, ibid. 29) to him, P&acirc;da by P&acirc;da, hemistich by hemistich, and the whole verse,</p>  
<p>40. And the Mah&acirc;vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis one by one, with the word Om at the end (ibid. 30).</p>  
<p>41. And handing over to him the staff, which should be made of (the wood of) a tree, he causes him to repeat (the formula), 'O glorious one, make me glorious' (ibid. 31).</p>  
<p>42. Then (the student) goes to beg food,</p>  
<p>43. First of his mother, and of two other women friends, or of as many as there are in the neighbourhood.</p>  
<p>44. He announces the alms (received) to his teacher.</p>  
<p>45. The rest of the day he stands silently.</p>  
<p>46. After sunset he puts a piece of wood on the fire with (the Mantra), 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood' (ibid. 32).</p>  
<p>47. Through a period of three nights he avoids eating pungent or saline food.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A></p>  
<p>48. At the end of that (period) a mess of boiled rice-grains (is offered) to Savit<I>ri</I>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_252"></A><A HREF="sbe30022.htm#fr_252">64:8</A> There are four kinds of garments indicated, though only persons of three castes are concerned. The explanation of this apparent incongruence follows from S&ucirc;tra 12.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_254"></A><A HREF="sbe30022.htm#fr_254">64:13</A> As the garments indicated in S&ucirc;tra 8 belong, in the order in which they are stated, to persons of the three castes respectively, thus also of the skins (S&ucirc;tra 9), of the girdles (S&ucirc;tra 10), and of the staffs (S&ucirc;tra 11); the first is that belonging to a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, the second, to a Kshatriya, and the third, to a Vai<I>s</I>ya.</P>

It is evident that the words tasy&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya<I>h</I> belong to S&ucirc;tra 23, and not to S&ucirc;tra 22, to which the traditional division of the S&ucirc;tras assigns them. The corresponding section of the Mantra-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a runs thus: 'What is thy name?'&#151;'My name is N.N.!' It is not clear whether the student, being questioned by the teacher, had to indicate his ordinary name, and then to receive from the teacher his 'abhiv&acirc;dan&icirc;ya n&acirc;madheya,' or whether he had to pronounce, on the teacher's question, directly the abhiv&acirc;dan&icirc;ya name chosen for him by the teacher. The commentary and the corresponding passage of the Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya (II, 4, 12) are in favour of the second alternative.</P>
