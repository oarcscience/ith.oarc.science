------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 2.

1. <span id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_356) On the following day the
Anvash*t*akya (ceremony is performed),

2\. Or on the day which follows after that.

3\. To the south-east (of the house), in the intermediate direction
(between south and east), they partition off (a place with mats or the
like).

4\. The long-side (of that place should lie) in the same (direction).

5\. They should perform (the ceremonies) turning their faces towards the
same (direction).

6\. (It should measure) at least four prakramas (i.e. steps).

7\. (It should have) its entrance from the west.

8. <span id="fr_357"></span>[8](#fn_357) In the northern part of that
enclosure they make the Laksha*n*a and carry the fire (to that place).

9\. To the west of the fire he places a mortar so that it stands firmly,
and husks, holding his left hand uppermost, one handful of rice-grains
which he has seized with one grasp.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

10\. When (the rice) has been husked,

11\. He should once carefully remove the husks.

12. <span id="fr_358"></span>[12](#fn_358) And then he should cut off a
lump of flesh from that thigh and should cut it in small pieces on a new
slaughtering-bench,

13\. (With the intention) that the Pi*nd*as (or lumps of food offered to
the Manes) should be thoroughly mixed up with flesh.

14. <span id="fr_359"></span>[14](#fn_359) On the same fire he cooks one
mess of rice-grains and one of meat, stirring up the one and the other
separately, from right to left, with the two pot-ladles.

15. <span id="fr_360"></span>[15](#fn_360) After he has cooked them, he
should pour (Â*g*ya) on them, should take them from the fire towards the
south, and should not pour (Â*g*ya) on them again.

16\. In the southern part of the enclosure (Sûtras 3 seq.) he should
have three pits dug, so that the eastern (pit is dug) first,

17\. One span in length, four inches in breadth and in depth.

18. <span id="fr_361"></span>[18](#fn_361) Having made the Laksha*n*a to
the east of the eastern pit, they carry the fire (to that place).

19\. Having carried the fire round the pits on their west side, he
should put it down on the Laksha*n*a.

20\. He strews (round the fire) one handful of Darbha grass which he has
cut off in one portion.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

21\. And (he strews it into) the pits,

22\. Beginning with the eastern (pit).

23\. To the west of the pits he should have a layer spread out,

24\. Of southward-pointed Ku*s*a grass,

25\. Inclined towards the south.

26\. And he should put a mat on it.

27. <span id="fr_362"></span>[27](#fn_362) To that (layer of grass) they
fetch for him (the following sacrificial implements), one by one, from
right to left:

28\. The two pots in which sacrificial food has been cooked (Sûtra 14),
the two pot-ladles (Sûtra 14), one brazen vessel, one Darvî (spoon), and
water.

29. <span id="fr_363"></span>[29](#fn_363) (The sacrificer's) wife
places a stone on the Barhis and pounds (on that stone the fragrant
substance called) Sthagara.

30. <span id="fr_364"></span>[30](#fn_364) And on the same (stone) she
grinds some collyrium, and anoints therewith three Darbha blades,
including the interstices (between the single blades?).

31. <span id="fr_365"></span>[31](#fn_365) He should also get some oil
made from sesamum seeds,

32. <span id="fr_366"></span>[32](#fn_366) And a piece of linen tape.

33. <span id="fr_367"></span>[33](#fn_367) After he has invited an odd
number of blameless Brâhma*n*as, whose faces should be turned towards
the north, to sit down on a pure spot,

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

34. <span id="fr_368"></span>[34](#fn_368) And has given them Darbha
grass (in order that they may sit down thereon),

35. <span id="fr_369"></span>[35](#fn_369) He gives them (pure) water
and afterwards sesamum-water, pronouncing his father's name, 'N.N.! To
thee this sesamum-water, and to those who follow thee here, and to those
whom thou followest. To thee Svadhâ!'

36. <span id="fr_370"></span>[36](#fn_370) After he has touched water,
(he does) the same for the other two.

37. <span id="fr_371"></span>[37](#fn_371) In the same way (he gives
them) perfumes.

38. <span id="fr_372"></span>[38](#fn_372) The words in which he
addresses (the Brâhma*n*as) when going to sacrifice, are, 'I shall offer
it into the fire.'

39\. After they have replied, 'Offer it,' he should cut off (the
prescribed portions) from the two messes of cooked food (Sûtra 14), (and
should put those portions) into the brazen vessel. He then should
sacrifice, picking out (portions of the Havis) with the pot-ladle, the
first (oblation) with (the words), 'Svâhâ to Soma Pit*ri*mat,' the
second with (the words), 'Svâhâ to Agni Kavyavâhana' (MB. II, 3, 1. 2).
