<p>10. Facing the east the student on northward-pointed Darbha grass.</p>  
<p>11. The teacher should besprinkle (him) with lukewarm, scented water, which has been boiled with all kinds of herbs.</p>  
<p>12. But as if he (i.e. the student, should do so) himself&#151;</p>  
<p>13.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> (In such a way) he is alluded to in the Mantras; (therefore the besprinkling should be done rather by the student, and not by the teacher [?]).</p>  
<p>14. With (the verse), 'The fires which dwell in the waters' (MB. I, 7, 1)&#151;(the student[?]) pours his joined hands full of water (on the ground),</p>  
<p>15. And again with (the formula), 'What is dreadful in the waters, what is cruel in the waters, what is turbulent in the waters' (ibid. 2).</p>  
<p>16. With (the formula), 'The shining one I take here' (ibid. 3)&#151;he besprinkles himself.</p>  
<p>17. And again with (the formula), 'For the sake of glory, of splendour' (ibid. 4).</p>  
<p>18. And again with (the verse), 'By which you made the wife (pregnant?') (ibid. 5).</p>

<p>the Mantra separately (in the morning, at noon, and in the evening) as indicated in the text.</p>  
<p>22. He should add (the formula), 'The eye art thou' (ibid. 9) after (each of the three sections of the Mantra, 6-8).</p>  
<p>23. With the verse, 'Loosen the highest fetter, O Varu<I>n</I>a' (ibid. 10), he takes off the girdle.</p>  
<p>24. After he has entertained the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as with food and has eaten himself, he should have his hair, his beard, the hair of his body, and his nails cut, so as to leave the lock of hair (as required by the custom of his family).</p>  
<p>25. Having bathed and adorned himself, and having put on two garments (an under-garment and an upper-garment) which have not yet been washed, he should put a garland (on his head) with (the formula), 'Luck art thou; take delight in me' (ibid. 11).</p>  
<p>26. The two shoes (he puts on) with (the formula), 'Leaders are you; lead me' (ibid. 12).</p>  
<p>27. With (the formula), 'The Gandharva art thou' (ibid. 13), he takes a bamboo staff.</p>  
<p>28. He approaches the teacher together with the assembly (of his pupils) and looks at the assembly of his teacher's (pupils) with (the words), 'Like an eye-ball may I be dear to you' (ibid. 14).</p>  
<p>29. Sitting down near (the teacher) he touches the sense-organs at his head with (the verse), 'The she-ichneumon, covered by the lips' (ibid. 15).</p>  
<p>30. Here the teacher should honour him with the Argha ceremony.</p>  
<p>31. (The student then) should approach a chariot yoked with oxen, and should touch its two side-pieces or the two arms of the chariot-pole with</p>

The description given in this chapter of the Sam&acirc;vartana, or of the ceremony performed at the end of studentship, is opened with a few sentences referring to another section of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual, namely, to marriage. It seems to me that these first S&ucirc;tras of this chapter once formed, in a text from which Gobhila has taken them, the introduction to an exposition of the wedding ceremonies, and that Gobhila was induced to transfer them to the description of the Sam&acirc;vartana, by their opening words, 'A student, after he has studied the Veda, &amp;c.'
