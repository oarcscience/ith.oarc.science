------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 7, SECTION 22.

1\. Then they let her depart (in a vehicle from her father's house), or
they let her be taken away.

2\. Having put (the fire into a vessel) they carry that (nuptial) fire
behind (the newly-married couple).

3\. It should be kept constantly.

4. <span id="fr_624"></span>[4](#fn_624) If it goes out, (a new fire)
should be kindled by attrition, or it should be fetched from the house
of a *S*rotriya.

5\. Besides, if (the fire) goes out, the wife or the husband should
fast.

6\. When (the bridegroom with his bride) has come to his house, he says
to her, 'Cross (the threshold) with thy right foot first; do not stand
on the threshold.'

7\. In the hall, in its easterly part, he puts down the fire and puts
wood on it.

8\. To the west of the fire he spreads out a red bull's skin with the
neck to the east, with the hair outside.

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

9. <span id="fr_625"></span>[9](#fn_625) On that (skin) they both sit
down facing the east or the north, so that the wife sits behind her
husband, with (the verse), 'Here may the cows sit down, here the horses,
here the men. Here may also Pûshan with a thousand (sacrificial) gifts
sit down.'

10\. They sit silently until the stars appear.

11\. When the stars have appeared, he goes forth from the house (with
his wife) in an easterly or northerly direction, and worships the
quarters (of the horizon) with (the hemistich), 'Ye goddesses, ye six
wide ones' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 7, 14, 2).

12. <span id="fr_626"></span>[12](#fn_626) (He worships) the stars with
(the Pâda), 'May we not be deprived of our offspring;'

13\. The moon with (the Pâda), 'May we not get into the power of him who
hates us, O king Soma!

14\. He worships the seven *Ri*shis (ursa major) with (the verse), 'The
seven *Ri*shis who have led to firmness she, Arundhatî, who stands first
among the six K*ri*ttikâs (pleiads):—may she, the eighth one, who leads
the conjunction of the (moon with the) six K*ri*ttikâs, the first (among
conjunctions) shine upon us!' Then he worships the polar star with (the
formula), 'Firm dwelling, firm origin. The firm one art thou, standing
on the side of firmness. Thou art the pillar of the stars; thus protect
me against my adversary.

Adoration be to the Brahman, to the firm, immovable one! Adoration be to
the Brahman's son, Pra*g*âpati! Adoration to the Brahman's children,

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

to the thirty-three gods! Adoration to the Brahman's children and
grandchildren, to the Aṅgiras!

He who knows thee (the polar star) as the firm, immovable Brahman with
its children and with its grandchildren, with such a man children and
grandchildren will firmly dwell, servants and pupils, garments and
woollen blankets, bronze and gold, wives and kings, food, safety, long
life, glory, renown, splendour, strength, holy lustre, and the enjoyment
of food. May all these things firmly and immovably dwell with me!'

<span id="fn_624"></span>[193:4](sbe30065.htm#fr_624) 22, 4 'If the fire
on which they had put wood, was a fire produced by attrition, (the new
fire) should (also) be kindled by attrition. If it was a common
(laukika) fire that they had fetched, (the new fire) should be fetched
from a Srotriya's house. Thereby it is shown that the common fire at the
Upanayana ceremony, &c., should be fetched only from a Srotriya's
house.' Mât*ri*datta.
