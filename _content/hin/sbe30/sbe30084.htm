<p>to perform). Then he takes a water-pot and a handful of Darbha grass, goes forth to a place that lies in a south-easterly intermediate direction, spreads the Darbha grass out with its points towards the south, and pours out on that (grass) with downward-turned hands, ending in the south, three handfuls of water, with (the formulas), 'May the fathers, the friends of Soma, wipe themselves! May the grandfathers . . . the great-grandfathers, the friends of Soma, wipe themselves!' or, 'N.N.! Wash thyself! N.N.! Wash thyself!'</p>

To his father he gives his lump with (the words), 'This to thee, father, N.N.!' to the grandfather with (the words), 'This to thee, grandfather, N.N.!' to the great-grandfather with (the words), 'This to thee, great-grandfather, N.N.!' silently a fourth (lump). This (fourth lump) is optional.</p>  
<p>4. Should he not know the names (of the ancestors), he gives the lump to the father with (the words), 'Svadh&acirc; to the Fathers who dwell on the earth,' to the grandfather with (the words), 'Svadh&acirc; to the Fathers who dwell in the air,' to the great-grandfather with (the words), 'Svadh&acirc; to the Fathers who dwell in heaven.'</p>  
<p>5. Then he gives, corresponding to each lump, collyrium and (other) salve and (something that represents) a garment.</p>

Do not seize upon anything else that is ours,' he tears off a skirt (of his garment) or a flake of wool and puts that down (for the Fathers), if he is in the first half of his life.</p>  
<p>9. He tears out some hairs of his body, if in the second half.</p>  
<p>10. Then he washes the vessel (in which the food was of which he had offered the lumps), and sprinkles (the water with which he has washed it), from right to left round (the lumps) with (the Mantra), 'These honey-sweet waters, bringing refreshment to children and grandchildren, giving sweet drink and ambrosia to the Fathers, the divine waters refresh both (the living and the dead), these rivers, abounding in water, covered with reeds, with beautiful bathing-places; may they flow up to you in yon world!' Then he turns the vessel over, crosses his hands so that the left hand becomes right and the right hand becomes left, and worships (the Fathers) with the formulas of adoration, 'Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of sap' (Taitt.
