1\. 'This is for thee, father, this honey-sweet wave, rich in water. As
great as Agni and the earth are, so great is its measure, so great is
its might. As. such a great one I give it. As Agni is imperishable and
inexhaustible, thus may it be imperishable and inexhaustible, sweet
drink to my father. By that imperishable (wave), that sweet drink, live
thou together with those, N.N.! The *Rik*as are thy might.

are . . . As Vâyu is imperishable . . . to my grandfather. . . . The
Ya*g*us are thy might.

the heaven are . . . "The Sâmans are thy might.'

sons.'
