*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 1, SECTION 3.

1\. 'As the wind blows, as the ocean waves, thus may the embryo move;
may it come forth together with the after-birth'—with (this verse) he
strokes (her body) from above downwards.

2\. When the child is born, he lays an axe on a stone, and a piece of
gold on that axe; after he has turned these things upside down (so that
the stone lies uppermost), he holds the boy over them with (the two
verses),

'Be a stone, be an axe, be insuperable gold. Thou indeed art the Veda
called son; so live a hundred autumns.

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

'From limb by limb thou art produced; out of the heart thou art born.
Thou indeed art the self (âtman) called son; so live a hundred autumns.'

3\. (The contents of this Sûtra are similar to those of Pâraskara I, 16,
2.)

4\. They take the Aupâsana (or regular G*ri*hya) fire away, and they
bring the Sûtikâgni (or the fire of the confinement).

5\. That (fire) is only used for warming (dishes, etc.).

6\. No ceremonies are performed with it except the fumigation (see the
next Sûtra).

7. <span id="fr_649"></span>[7](#fn_649) He fumigates (the child) with
small grains mixed with mustard seeds. These he throws into the coals
(of the Sûtikâgni) (eleven times, each time with one of the following
Mantras):

\(a\) 'May *S*a*nd*a and Marka, Upavîra, *S*â*nd*ikera, Ulûkhala,
*K*yavana vanish from here. Svâhâ!

\(b\) 'Âlikhat, Vilikhat, Animisha, Ki*m*vadanta, Upa*s*ruti. Svâhâ!

\(c\) 'Aryam*n*a, Kumbhin, *S*atru, Pâtrapâ*n*i, Nipu*n*i. Svâhâ!

\(d\) 'May Ântrîmukha, Sarshapâru*n*a vanish from here. Svâhâ!

\(e\) 'Ke*s*inî, *S*valominî, Ba*g*âbo*g*â, Upakâ*s*ini—go away, vanish
from here. Svâhâ!

\(f\) 'The servants of Kuvera, Vi*s*vavâsa (?), sent by the king of
demons, all of one common origin,

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

walk through the villages, visiting those who wake (?). Svâhâ!

\(g\) '"Kill them! Bind them!" thus (says) this messenger of Brahman.
Agni has encompassed them. Indra knows them; B*ri*haspati knows them; I
the Brâhma*n*a know them who seize (men), who have prominent teeth,
rugged hair, hanging breasts. Svâhâ!

\(h\) 'The night-walkers, wearing ornaments on their breasts, with
lances in their hands, drinking out of skulls! Svâhâ!

\(i\) 'Their father U*kk*ai*hs*râvyakar*n*aka walks (?) at their head,
their mother walks in the rear, seeking a vikhura (?) in the village.
Svâhâ!

\(k\) 'The sister, the night-walker, looks at the family through the
rift (?)—she who wakes while people sleep, whose mind is turned on the
wife that has become mother. Svâhâ!

\(l\) 'O god with the black path, Agni, burn the lungs, the hearts, the
livers of those (female demons); burn their eyes. Svâhâ!'

8. <span id="fr_650"></span>[8](#fn_650) Then he washes his hands and
touches the ground with (the verses), 'O thou whose hair is well parted!
Thy heart that dwells in heaven, in the moon: of that immortality impart
to us. May I not weep over distress (falling to my lot) through my sons.

'I know thy heart, O earth, that dwells in heaven, in the moon: thus may
I, the lord of immortality, not weep over distress (falling to my lot)
through my sons.'

9\. Now (follows) the medhâ*g*anana (or production

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

of intelligence). With (an instrument of) gold over which he has laid a
Darbha shoot tied (to that piece of gold) he gives to the child, which
is held so that it faces the east, ghee to eat, with the formulas,
'Bhû*h*! I sacrifice the *Rik*as over thee! Bhuva*h*! I sacrifice the
Ya*g*us over thee! Suva*h*! I sacrifice the Sâmans over thee! Bhûr
bhuva*h* suva*h*! I sacrifice the Atharvan and Aṅgiras hymns over thee!'

10. <span id="fr_651"></span>[10](#fn_651) He then bathes the child with
lukewarm water with (the following Mantras):

'From chronic disease, from destruction, from wile, from Varu*n*a's
fetter I release thee. I make thee guiltless before the Brahman; may
both Heaven and Earth be kind towards thee.

'May Agni together with the waters bring thee bliss, Heaven and Earth
together with the herbs; may the air together with the wind bring thee
bliss; may the four quarters of the heaven bring thee bliss.

'Rightly have the gods released the sun from darkness and from the
seizing demon; they have dismissed him from guilt; thus I deliver this
boy from chronic disease, from curse that comes from his kin, from wile,
from Varu*n*a's fetter.'

11\. He then places the child in his mother's lap with (the verse):
