### INTRODUCTORY NOTE

###### TO THE

## G*RI*HYA-SÛTRA OF HIRA*N*YAKE*S*IN.

<span class="smallcaps">After</span> the excellent remarks of Professor
Bühler on the position of Hira*n*yake*s*in among the Sûtra authors of
the Black Ya*g*ur-veda (Sacred Books, vol. ii, p. xxiii seq.), I can
here content myself with shortly indicating the materials on which my
translation of this G*ri*hya-sûtra, which was unpublished when I began
to translate it, is based. For the first half of the work I could avail
myself, in the first place, of the text, together with the commentary of
Mât*ri*datta, which the late Dr. Schoenberg of Vienna had prepared for
publication, and which was based on a number of MSS collated by him. It
is my melancholy duty gratefully to acknowledge here the kindness with
which that prematurely deceased young scholar has placed at my disposal
the materials he had collected, and the results of his labour which he
continued till the last days of his life. For the second half of the
Sûtra his death deprived me of this important assistance; here then
Professors Kielhorn of Göttingen and Bühler of Vienna have been kind
enough to enable me to finish the task of this translation, by lending
me two MSS. of the text and two MSS. of Mât*ri*datta's commentary which
they possess.

Finally, Dr. J. Kirste of Vienna very kindly sent me the proof-sheets of
his valuable edition before it was published. With the aid of these my
translation has been revised.
