### PA*T*ALA 7, SECTION 19.

1\. The unground grain (which is left over, see above, VII, 18, 11) they
give to the boys to eat.

2\. Let him repeat in the same way this Bali-offering of whatever food
he has got or of flour, from that day to full moon of (the month)
Mârga*s*îrsha.

3\. On the day of the full moon of Mârga*s*îrsha after sunset a
Sthâlîpâka (is offered as above, VII, 18, 5).

4\. In the Mantra for the Bali-offering he changes (the word 'I shall
offer' into) 'I have offered.'

5\. Then he does not offer (the Bali) any longer.

6\. (Now follows) the Âgraya*n*a sacrifice (or partaking of the
first-fruits) of one who has not set up the (*S*rauta) fires.

7\. He prepares a Sthâlîpâka of the fresh fruits, sacrifices to the
deities of the (*S*rauta) Âgraya*n*a sacrifice with (Agni)
Svish*t*ak*ri*t as the fourth, fills his mouth with grains, swallows
them, sips water, forms a lump of the boiled (sacrificial) food, and
throws it up with the next Ya*g*us (II, 18, 1) to the summit of the
house.

8. <span id="fr_783"></span>[8](#fn_783) (Now follows) the 'redescent'
in the winter.

9\. With the next Ya*g*us (II, 18, 2) they 'redescend' (or take as their
sleeping-place a layer of straw instead of the high bedsteads which they
have used before). With the next Ya*g*us formulas (II, 18, 3-7) they lie
down on a new layer (of straw) on their right sides,

10\. The father to the south, the mother to the north (of him), and so
the others, one after the other from the eldest to the youngest.

11\. After he has arisen, he touches the earth with the next two
(verses, II, 18, 8. 9).

12\. In the same way the lying down, &c., is repeated thrice.

13. <span id="fr_784"></span>[13](#fn_784) Having prepared a Sthâlîpâka
for Lana and

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

one for Kshetrapati, he goes out in an easterly or northerly direction,
prepares a raised surface, (and then follow the ceremonies) beginning
with the putting of wood on the fire.

14\. To the west of the fire he builds two huts.
