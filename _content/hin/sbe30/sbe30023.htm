<P><A NAME="fn_259"></A><A HREF="sbe30023.htm#fr_259">69:1</A> 1, 1. After the description of the regular Upanayana here follow, in chaps. 1 and 2, statements regarding the special Vratas which the Vedic student has to undergo, or rather which he may undergo, in the time of his studentship. Comp. the corresponding statements on the Vratas of the <I>Ri</I>gvedins, <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya II, 11 and 12. By the followers of the S&acirc;ma-veda the ceremony of the God&acirc;na, or cutting of the beard (comp. <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana I, 28, 19; P&acirc;raskara II, 1, 7 seq.; &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana I, 18), was put into connection with their system of Vratas; the undergoing of the God&acirc;navrata enabled the student to study the P&ucirc;rv&acirc;r<I>k</I>ika of the S&acirc;ma-veda. In the commentary on Gobhila III, 1, 28 we find the following statements with regard to this Vrata as well as to the other Vratas mentioned in S&ucirc;tra 28: 'The Upanayana-vrata has been declared to refer to the study of the S&acirc;vitr&icirc; (comp. Bloomfield's notes on G<I>ri</I>hya-sa<I>m</I>graha II, 42. 43); the God&acirc;na-vrata, to the study of the collections of verses sacred to the gods Agni, Indra, and Soma Pavam&acirc;na (this is the P&ucirc;rv&acirc;r<I>k</I>ika of the S&acirc;ma-veda); the Vr&acirc;tika-vrata, to the study of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, with the exclusion of the <I>S</I>ukriya sections; the &Acirc;ditya-vrata, to the study of the <I>S</I>ukriya sections; the Aupanishada-vrata, to the study of the Upanishad-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a; the <I>G</I>yaish<I>th</I>as&acirc;mika-vrata, to the study of the &Acirc;<I>g</I>yadohas.' The Vratas were connected with a repetition of the Upanayana ceremony (S&ucirc;tras 10 seq.) in the way stated in my note on <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana II, 12, 1.&#151;Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya II, 5, 1 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_260"></A><A HREF="sbe30023.htm#fr_260">69:2</A> Comp. <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana I, 28, 19, 'The God&acirc;nakarman is identical with the <I>K</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;karman.' P&acirc;raskara II, 1, 7, At the Ke<I>s</I>&acirc;nta ceremony he says, "Hair and beard" (instead of "hair," as at the <I>K</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;kara<I>n</I>a).'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_265"></A><A HREF="sbe30023.htm#fr_265">71:30</A> According to the commentary some study the <I>S</I>ukriyas as a part of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka; these do not undergo the &Acirc;ditya-vrata. Others, for instance the Kauthumas, separate the <I>S</I>ukriyas from the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka and keep a special vow, the &Acirc;ditya-vrata, by which they are enabled to study those texts.</P>
