------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 7.

1. <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_223) Now (follows) the
Sîmantakara*n*a (or parting of the hair), in her first pregnancy,—

2\. In the fourth, or sixth, or eighth month (of her pregnancy).

3. <span id="fr_224"></span>[3](#fn_224) In the morning, after she has
been washed, sitting on northward-pointed Darbha grass, (all over her
body), including her head, she sits down to the west of the fire on
northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.

4. <span id="fr_225"></span>[4](#fn_225) Her husband, standing behind
her, ties (to her neck) an Udumbara branch with an even number of unripe
fruits on it, with (the verse), 'Rich in sap is this tree' (MB. I, 5,
1).

5\. He then parts her hair upwards (i.e. beginning from the front), the
first time with Darbha blades, with (the word), 'Bhû*h*!' the second
time with (the word), 'Bhuva*h*!' the third time with (the word),
'Sva*h*!'—

6\. Then with (a splint of) Vîratara (wood) with this verse, 'With which
Aditi's' (ibid. 2);

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

7\. Then with a full spindle, with this verse, 'I invoke Râkâ' (ibid. 3.
4)

8\. And with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, with (the
verse), 'Which are thy blessings, O Râkâ' (ibid. 5).

9\. (There should be prepared) a mess of boiled rice with sesamum seeds,
covered with ghee; at that he should make her look.

10\. Let him say to her, 'What dost thou see?' and make her answer,
'Offspring!'

11\. That (food) she should eat herself.

12\. Brâhma*n*a women should sit by her side, pronouncing auspicious
words (such as), 'A mother of valiant sons! A mother of living sons! A
living husband's wife!'

13. <span id="fr_226"></span>[13](#fn_226) Now (follows) the sacrifice
for the woman in labour.

14\. When the child is appearing, he strews (Darbha grass) round the
fire and sacrifices two Â*g*ya oblations with this verse, 'She who
athwart' (MB. I, 5, 6), and with (the verse), 'Vipa*sk*it has taken
away' (ibid. 7).

15\. 'A male he will be born, N.N. by name'—(in this passage of the last
verse) he pronounces a name.

16\. What that (name is), is kept secret.

17. <span id="fr_227"></span>[17](#fn_227) When they announce to him
that a son has been born, he should say, 'Delay still cutting off the
navel-string and giving him the breast.'

18. <span id="fr_228"></span>[18](#fn_228) Let him have rice and
barley-grains pounded in the same way as the (Nyagrodha) shoot.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

19. <span id="fr_229"></span>[19](#fn_229) Seizing (that pounded
*s*ubstance) with the thumb and the fourth finger of his right hand, he
smears it on the tongue of the boy, with the formula, 'This order' (MB.
I, 5, 8).

20\. In the same way the production of intelligence (is performed). He
should give to eat (to the child) clarified butter.

21\. Or he takes it with gold (i.e. with a golden spoon) and sacrifices
it on the face of the boy with this verse, 'May Mitra and Varu*n*a
bestow intelligence on thee' (MB. I, 5, 9), and with (the verse), 'The
lord of the seat, the wonderful' (Sâma-veda I, 171).

22\. Let him say, 'Cut off the navel-string,' and, 'Give the breast (to
the child).'

23. <span id="fr_230"></span>[23](#fn_230) From that time let him not
touch (his wife) until ten nights have passed.
