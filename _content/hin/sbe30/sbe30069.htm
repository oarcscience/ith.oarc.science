<p>1. The fire which (the sacrificer keeps) from the time of his marriage, is called the Aup&acirc;sana (or sacred domestic fire)</p>  
<p>2. With this fire the sacred domestic ceremonies are performed.</p>  
<p>3.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_637"></A><A HREF="#fn_637"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> On account of his worship devoted to this (fire the sacrificer) is considered as an &Acirc;hit&acirc;gni (i.e. as one who has set up the <I>S</I>rauta fires), and on account of his fortnightly <I>K</I>aru sacrifices (on the days of the new and full moon) as one who offers the sacrifices of the new and full moon (as prescribed in the <I>S</I>rauta ritual); so (is it taught).</p>  
<p>4. If (the service at the domestic fire) has been interrupted for twelve days, the sacrificer ought to set the fire up again.</p>  
<p>5. Or he should count all the sacrifices (that have been left out), and should offer them.</p>  
<p>6. (The punar&acirc;dh&acirc;na or repeated setting up of the fire is performed in the following way): in an enclosed space, having raised (the surface), sprinkled it (with water), strewn it with sand, and covered it with Udumbara or Plaksha branches, he silently brings together the things belonging to (the sacrifice) according as he is able to get them, produces fire by attrition out of a sacrificially pure piece of wood, or gets a common fire, places it in a big vessel, sets it in a blaze, and puts (fuel) on it with the words, 'Bh&ucirc;<I>h</I>! Bhuva<I>h</I>! Suva<I>h</I>! Om! Fixity!'</p>

<p>7. He then puts wood on the fire, performs (the rites) down to the Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>ti oblations, and offers two 'mind&acirc; oblations' (i.e. oblations for making up for defects) with (the two Mantras), 'If a defect (mind&acirc;) has arisen in me,' (and), 'Agni has given me back my eye' (Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. III, 2, 5, 4).</p>  
<p>8. He offers three 'tantu oblations' with (the Mantras), 'Stretching the weft (tantu)' (Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. III, 4, 2, 2), 'Awake, Agni!' (IV, 7, 13, 5), 'The thirty-three threads of the weft' (I, 5, 10, 4).</p>  
<p>9. He offers four 'abhy&acirc;vartin oblations' with (the Mantras), 'Agni who turns to us (abhy&acirc;vartin)!' 'Agni A&#7749;giras!' 'Again with sap,' 'With wealth' (Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. IV. 2, 1, 2. 3).</p>  
<p>10.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_638"></A><A HREF="#fn_638"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> Having made oblations with the single Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis and with (the three Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis together), and having made an oblation with the verse, 'Thou art quick, Agni, and free from imprecation. Verily (satyam) thou art quick. Held by us in our quick mind (manas), with thy quick (mind) thou carriest the offering (to the gods). Being quick bestow medicine on us! Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'&#151;this (last) oblation contains an allusion to the mind (manas), it refers to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and alludes to the number seven (?),&#151;he quickly repeats in his mind the da<I>s</I>ahot<I>ri</I> formula (Taitt. &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>y. III, 1, 1). Then he makes the sagraha oblation (?); (then follow the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A></p>  
<p>oblations), 'This, O Varu<I>n</I>a' (&amp;c.; see I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the S&ucirc;tra). Then he serves food to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and causes them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' he then performs in the known way the sacrifice of a mess of cooked food to Agni.</p>  
<p>11. Here he gives an optional gift to his Guru: a pair of clothes, a milch cow, or a bull.</p>  
<p>12.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_639"></A><A HREF="#fn_639"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> If he sets out on a journey, he makes the fire enter himself or the two kindling-sticks in the way that has been described (in the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra).</p>  
<p>13. Or let him make it enter a piece of wood, in the same way as into the kindling-sticks.</p>  
<p>14. A piece of Khadira wood, or of Pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a, or of Udumbara, or of A<I>s</I>vattha wood&#151;</p>  
<p>15. With one of these kinds of wood he fetches, where he turns in (on his journey), fire from the house of a <I>S</I>rotriya, and puts the (piece of wood) into which his fire has entered, on (that fire), with the two verses, 'He who has received the oblations' (Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. IV, 6, 5, 3), and 'Awake!' (IV, 7, 13, 5).</p>  
<p>16. The way in which he sacrifices has been explained (in the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra).</p>  
<p>17. If one half-monthly sacrifice has been omitted, he should have a sacrifice to (Agni) Pathik<I>ri</I>t performed over this (fire). If two (half-monthly sacrifices), to (Agni) Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara and Pathik<I>ri</I>t. If more than two, (the fire) has to be set up again.</p>  
<p>18. If the fire is destroyed or lost, or if it is mixed with other fires, it has to be set up again..</p>

I cannot see why the oblation made with this Mantra is called saptavat&icirc; (alluding to the number seven); possibly we ought to read satyavat&icirc; (containing the word satyam, 'verily').
