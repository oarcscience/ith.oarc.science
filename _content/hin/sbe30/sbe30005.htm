<p>2. Raising his right arm, putting the head into (the upav&icirc;ta), he suspends (the cord) over his left shoulder, so that it hangs down on his right side: thus he becomes ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>opav&icirc;tin.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_106"></A><A HREF="sbe30005.htm#fr_106">16:1</A> 2, 1-4. Rules regarding the Upav&icirc;ta. Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya I, 1, 4-6. Compare the detailed description of the nine threads of which the Upav&icirc;ta-string should consist, in the G<I>ri</I>hya-sa<I>m</I>graha II, 48 seqq. A string was evidently considered as the regular and preferable form of the Upav&icirc;ta; with regard to the second kind of Upav&icirc;ta mentioned in S&ucirc;tra 1, the commentary says, 'A garment (is used), <A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A> if the Upav&icirc;ta has been lost, for instance, in a forest, and if it is impossible to get a string.' A similar remark is given with reference to the third kind of Upav&icirc;ta, the rope of Ku<I>s</I>a grass.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_109"></A><A HREF="sbe30005.htm#fr_109">18:20</A> According to the commentary he has to hold his hands between his knees. Comp. <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh.-G<I>ri</I>hya I, 10, 8. Thus the shoulders are brought forward.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_110"></A><A HREF="sbe30005.htm#fr_110">18:21</A> 21-27. These S&ucirc;tras form three regular <I>S</I>loka hemistichs. Only at the end of the second hemistich there is a metrical irregularity (sop&acirc;natka<I>h</I> kva<I>k</I>it standing at the end of the verse).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_114"></A><A HREF="sbe30005.htm#fr_114">19:32</A> This S&ucirc;tra again forms a Sloka, though a slightly irregular Sloka.</P>
