### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 6, SECTION 19.

1\. After he has returned from the teacher's house, he should support
his father and mother.

2. <span id="fr_609"></span>[2](#fn_609) With their permission he should
take a wife belonging to the same caste and country, a 'naked' girl, a
virgin who should belong to a different Gotra (from her husband's).

3. <span id="fr_610"></span>[3](#fn_610) Whatever he intends to do (for
instance, taking a wife), he should do on an auspicious day only, during
one of the following five spaces of time, viz. in the morning, the
forenoon, at midday, in the afternoon, or in the evening.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

4. <span id="fr_611"></span>[4](#fn_611) Having put wood on the fire,
and having performed (the preparatory rites) down to the laying of
(three) branches round (the fire, the bridegroom) looks at the bride who
is led to him, with (the verse), 'Auspicious ornaments does this woman
wear. Come up to her and behold her. Having brought lack to her, go away
back to your houses.'

5\. To the south of the bridegroom the bride sits down.

6. <span id="fr_612"></span>[6](#fn_612) After she has sipped water, she
touches him, and he sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as above.

7. <span id="fr_613"></span>[7](#fn_613) After he has performed the
rites down to the oblations made with the Vyâh*ri*tis, he sacrifices
with (the following Mantras),

'May Agni come hither, the first of gods. May he release the offspring
of this wife from the fetter of death. That may this king Varu*n*a
grant, that this wife may not weep over distress (falling to her lot)
through her sons. Svâhâ!

'May Agni Gârhapatya protect this woman. May he lead her offspring to
old age. With fertile womb may she be the mother of living children. May
she experience delight in her sons. Svâhâ!

'May no noise that comes from thee, arise in the house by night. May the
(she-goblins called) the weeping ones take their abode in another
(woman)

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

than thee. Mayst thou not be beaten at thy breast by (the she-goblin)
Vike*s*î ("the rough-haired one"). May thy husband live, and mayst thou
shine in thy husband's world, beholding thy genial offspring! Svâhâ!

'May Heaven protect thy back, Vâyu thy thighs, and the two A*s*vins thy
breast. May Savit*ri* protect thy suckling sons. Until the garment is
put on (thy sons?), may B*ri*haspati guard (them?), and the Vi*s*ve
devâs afterwards. Svâhâ!

'Childlessness, the death of sons, evil, and distress, I take (from
thee), as a wreath (is taken) from the head, and (like a wreath) I put
all evil on (the head of) our foes. Svâhâ!

'With this well-disposed prayer which the gods have created, I kill the
Pi*s*â*k*as that dwell in thy womb. The flesh-devouring death-bringers I
cast down. May thy sons live to old age. Svâhâ!'

8\. After he has sacrificed with (the verses), 'This, O Varu*n*a,' 'For
this I entreat thee,' 'Thou Agni,' Thus thou, Agni,' 'Thou, Agni, art
quick,' 'Pra*g*âpati'—he makes her tread on a stone, with (the verse),
'Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm. Destroy those who seek to do
thee harm; overcome thy enemies.'

9\. To the west of the fire he strews two layers of northward-pointed
Darbha grass, the one more to the west, the other more to the east. On
these both (the bridegroom and the bride) station themselves, the one
more to the west, the other more to the east.

8\. See above, I, 1, 3, 5; I, 1, 4, 1.

savar*n*â*m* samânâbhi*g*anâ*m* *k*a. Mât*ri*datta. As to the meaning of
'a naked girl,' (i.e. a girl who has not yet the monthly illness), comp.
Gobhila III, 4, 6 and note.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[186:3](sbe30062.htm#fr_610) According to
Mât*ri*datta, 'morning' means one Nâ*d*ikâ before and one Nâ*d*ikâ after
sunrise; 'forenoon' means one Nâ*d*ikâ before and one Nâ*d*ikâ after the
moment at which the first quarter of the day has elapsed; and thus each
of the other three day-times <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> is
understood to comprise two Nâ*d*ikâs. As the whole day consists of sixty
Nâ*d*ikâs, it is the sixth part of the day (= 10 Nâ*d*ikâs) which is
considered as auspicious for such purposes as taking a wife.
