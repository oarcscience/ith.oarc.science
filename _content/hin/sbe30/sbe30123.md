# ÂPASTAMBA'S YA*GÑ*A-PARIBHÂSHÂ-SÛTRAS. (*cont*.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_101">101</span></span>

### SÛTRA CI.

For these two last portions he makes the indication of the deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_101_c">101<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

With the earlier portions, there is a rule which of two gods should have
the first or the second portion. With the last couple, however, the
priest may himself assign whichever portion he likes to one or the other
god. The commentary says, svayam eva idam asyâ iti saṅkalpayet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_102">102</span></span>

### SÛTRA CII.

When there is a number of *K*arus and Puro*d*â*s*as, one separates what
belongs to the *K*arus and what belongs to the Puro*d*â*s*as, before the
strewing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_102_c">102<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Prâg adhivapanât, before the strewing, is explained by prâg
adhivapanârthak*ri*sh*n*â*g*inâdânât, before one takes the black skin
which is used for the strewing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103">103</span></span>

### SÛTRA CIII.

One then marks the two (the materials for the Karus and the
Puro*d*â*s*as) according to the deities (for whom they are intended).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_104">104</span></span>

### SÛTRA CIV.

Let the word idam be the rule.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_104_c">104<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

This means that the offering (havis) intended for each deity should be
pointed out by the words idam, this, Agne*h*, is for Agni, &c. Thus we
read with regard to the offerings intended for certain gods and
goddesses: ida*m* Dhâtur, idam Anumatyâ, Râkâyâ*h* Sinîvâlyâ*h*,
Kuhvâ*h*.

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_105">105</span></span>

### SÛTRA CV.

All this applies also to *K*arus and Puro*d*â*s*as which are separated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_105_c">105<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The commentary explains vyatishikta by anyonya*m* vyavahita, though it
is difficult to see how it can have that meaning. It is said that in the
Vai*s*vadeva the *K*arus and Puro*d*â*s*as are vyatishikta, but that
they also have to be divided before the adhivapana, and to be marked for
each deity. Thus we read: Idam Agne*h*, Savitu*h*, Pûsh*n*o, Marutâ*m*,
Dyâvâp*ri*thivyo*h*, &c.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_106">106</span></span>

### SÛTRA CVI.

At the time when the Kapâlas are put on the fire, one puts on the karu
with the first kapâla verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_106_c">106<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Karu is here used for the vessel for boiling the *k*aru, the
*k*arusthâlî. The first of these verses is dh*ri*sh*t*ir asi. Kapâlas
are the jars in which the rice is cooked.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_107">107</span></span>

### SÛTRA CVII.

The verse is adapted and changed to dhruvo<sup>ऽ</sup>si.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_107_c">107<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Sa*m*nâma means the same as ûha, i.e. the modification of a verse so as
to adapt it to the object for which it is used. In our case, *k*aru,
being a masculine, dh*ri*sh*t*i, a feminine, is replaced by dhruva, a
masculine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_108">108</span></span>

### SÛTRA CVIII.

At the time when the meal is to be cleansed, one cleanses the grains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_108_c">108<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

This takes place after the *k*aru-pot has been put on. The ta*nd*ulas
are the unhusked grains, pish*t*a is the

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

ground flour. In Sanskrit a distinction is made between *s*asya, the
corn in the field, dhânya, corn with the husk, ta*nd*ula, grains without
husks, anna, roasted grains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_109">109</span></span>

### SÛTRA CIX.

At the time of cooking (adhi*s*rapa*n*a) one throws the grains in with
the cooking verse.

Commentary. This verse is gharmo<sup>ऽ</sup>si.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span>

### SÛTRA CX.

Without taking the *k*aru (out of the sthâlî) one puts it down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111">111</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXI.

At the Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa sacrifices there are fifteen Sâmidhenîs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111_c">111<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Sâmidhenîs are particular verses recited while the fire is being
kindled. The first and last verses are repeated thrice, so as to make
fifteen in all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_112">112</span></span>

### SÛTRA CII.

At the Ish*t*i and Pa*s*ubandha sacrifices there are seventeen
Sâmidhenîs, when they are so handed down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113">113</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXIII.

When it is said that wishful ish*t*is are performed in a murmur, this
means that the names of the chief deities are pronounced in a murmur
(likewise the yâ*g*yâ and anuvâkyâ).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_114">114</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXIV.

The Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa sacrifice is the Prak*ri*ti or norm for all
ish*t*is.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_114_c">114<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The Sûtras, in describing the performance of certain sacrifices, treat
some of them in full detail. These are called prak*ri*ti.
Prak*ri*yante<sup>ऽ</sup>smin dharmâ iti prakara*n*am prak*ri*ti*h*.
They form the type of other sacrifices, which are therefore looked upon
as mere modifications, vik*ri*ti, and in describing them those points
only are fully described in which they differ from their prak*ri*ti. A
sacrifice which is a vik*ri*ti, may again become the prak*ri*ti of
another sacrifice. This system is no doubt compendious, but it is not
free from difficulty, and, in some cases, from uncertainty. It shows how
much system there is in the Indian sacrifices, and how fully and
minutely that system must have been elaborated, before it assumed that
form in which we find it in the Brâhma*n*as and Sûtras. It must not be
supposed that the sacrifices which serve as prak*ri*ti, are therefore
historically the most ancient.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115">115</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXV.

It is also the norm for the Agnîshomîya Pa*s*u, the animal sacrifice for
Agnî-Shomau.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_116">116</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXVI.

And this is the norm for the Savanîya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_117">117</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXVII.

And the Savanîya is the norm for the Aikâda*s*inas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_118">118</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXVIII.

And the Aikâda*s*inas are the norm for the Pa*s*uga*n*as.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_118_c">118<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The rules for the Pa*s*uga*n*as are therefore to be taken over from the
Aikâda*s*inas, the Savanîya, the Agnîshomîya-pa*s*u, and the
Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa, so far as they have been modified in each
particular case, and are

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

finally determined by the rules of each Pa*s*uga*n*a, as, for instance,
the Âditya-pa*s*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_119">119</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXIX.

The Vai*s*vadeva is the norm for the Varu*n*a-praghâsa, Sâkamedha, and
Sîra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_119_c">119<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The Vai*s*vadeva, beginning, like the Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa, with an
Âgneya ash*t*akapâla, takes certain rules from the Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa,
and transfers these, together with its own, as, for instance, the nine
prayâ*g*as, to the Varu*n*a-praghâsa, &c.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXX.

The Vai*s*vadevika Ekakapâla is the norm for all Ekakapâlas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120_c">120<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The Ekakapâla is a puro*d*â*s*a cake, baked in one kapâla. It is fully
described in the Vai*s*vadeva, and then becomes the norm of all
Ekakapâlas. An ekakapâla cake is not divided.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_121">121</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXI.

The Vai*s*vadevî Âmikshâ is the norm for the Âmikshâs (a preparation of
milk).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_122">122</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXII.

Here the Vikâra, the modification, is perceived from similarity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_122_c">122<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

If it has once been laid down that the Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa is the
prak*ri*ti or norm for all ish*t*is, then similarity determines the
modification in all details, such as the offerings and the gods to whom
offerings are made. Thus Karu, being a vegetable offering, would rank as
a vikâra of puro*d*â*s*a, which occurs in the Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa
sacrifice, and is likewise vegetable. Honey and water

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

would be looked upon as most like the Â*g*ya in the Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa.
Âmikshâ, a preparation of milk, would come nearest to the Sâ*m*nâyya,
which is a mixture of sour and sweet milk.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_123">123</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXIII.

Offerings for one deity are vikâras of the Âgneya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_123_c">123<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

In the Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa, which is the prak*ri*ti of the ish*t*is, the
puro*d*â*s*a for Agni is meant for one deity. Hence all offerings to one
deity in the vik*ri*tis follow the general rules of the Âgneya
puro*d*â*s*a, as described in the Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa, for instance, the
karu for Sûrya, the Dvâda*s*a-kapâla for Sâvitrî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_124">124</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXIV.

Offerings for two deities are vikâras of the Agnîshomîya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_124_c">124<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

They must, however, be vegetable offerings, because the puro*d*â*s*a for
Agnî-Shomau is a vegetable offering. As an instance, the Âgnâvaish*n*ava
Ekâda*s*akapâla is quoted. Agnîshomîya has a short a, but the first a in
âgnavaish*n*ava is long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_125">125</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXV.

Offerings for many deities are vikâras also of the Aindrâgna.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_125_c">125<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The *k*a in bahudevatâ*s* *k*a is explained by the commentary as
intended to include the Âgnâvaish*n*ava also. Any offering intended for
more than one deity may be considered as intended for many deities.
