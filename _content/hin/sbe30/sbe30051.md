in the morning and in the evening he brings (to his teacher) the food
which he has received as alms and a pot of water; every day (he fetches)
a bundle of firewood; in the morning and in the evening, or daily in the
evening he puts fuel on (the fire, in the following way):

3. <span id="fr_532"></span>[3](#fn_532) Before sprinkling (water) round
(the fire), he wipes (with his wet hand) from left to right round (the
fire) with the verse, 'As you have loosed, O Vasus, the buffalo-cow'
(Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 7, 15, 7), and sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as
above.

4. <span id="fr_533"></span>[4](#fn_533) (Then) he puts (four) pieces of
wood (on the fire) with the single (Vyâh*ri*tis) and with (the three
Vyâh*ri*tis) together, and (four other pieces) with (the following four
verses),

'This fuel is thine, Agni; thereby thou shalt grow and gain vigour. And
may we grow and gain vigour. Svâhâ!

'May Indra give me insight; may Sarasvatî, the goddess, (give) insight;
may both A*s*vins, wreathed with lotus, bestow insight on me. Svâhâ!

'The insight that dwells with the Apsaras, the mind that dwells with the
Gandharvas, the divine insight and that which is born from men: may that
insight, the fragrant one, rejoice in me! Svâhâ!

'May insight, the fragrant one, that assumes all shapes, the
gold-coloured, mobile one, come to me. Rich in sap, swelling with milk,
may she, insight, the lovely-faced one, rejoice in me! Svâhâ!'

5. <span id="fr_534"></span>[5](#fn_534) Having wiped round (the fire)
in the same way, he sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as above.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

6. <span id="fr_535"></span>[6](#fn_535) He worships the fire with the
Mantras, 'What thy splendour is, Agni, may I thereby' (Taitt. Sa*m*h.
III, 5, 3, 2), and 'On me may insight, on me offspring' (Taitt.
Âra*n*yaka X, 44).

7. <span id="fr_536"></span>[7](#fn_536) After the lapse of those three
days (Sûtra 1) he serves in the same way the three kinds of food (stated
above) to the Brâhma*n*as, causes them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail!
Good luck!' and discharges himself of his vow by (repeating) these
(Mantras) with (the necessary) alterations, 'Agni, lord of the vow, I
have kept the vow' (see above, I, 2, 7, 8).

8. <span id="fr_537"></span>[8](#fn_537) He keeps the same observances

forty-eight years, or

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

twenty-four (years), or twelve (years), or until he has learnt (the
Veda).

15\. He should not, however, omit keeping the observances.

16. <span id="fr_541"></span>[16](#fn_541) At the beginning and on the
completion of the study of a Kâ*nd*a (of the Black Ya*g*ur-veda he
sacrifices) with (the verse), 'The lord of the seat, the wonderful one,
the friend of Indra, the dear one, I have entreated for the gift of
insight. Svâhâ!'

In the second place the *Ri*shi of the Kâ*nd*a (receives an oblation).

(Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varu*n*a;' 'For this I
entreat thee;' 'Thou, Agni;' 'Thus thou, Agni;' 'Thou, Agni, art quick;'
'Pra*g*âpati!' and, 'What I have done too much in this sacrifice.' Here
some add as subordinate oblations the *G*aya, Abhyâtâna, and
Râsh*t*rabh*ri*t (oblations) as above.

End of the Second Pa*t*ala.
