### PA*T*ALA 7, SECTION 26 <span id="fr_636"></span>[1](#fn_636).

1\. The fire which (the sacrificer keeps) from the time of his marriage,
is called the Aupâsana (or sacred domestic fire)

2\. With this fire the sacred domestic ceremonies are performed.

3. <span id="fr_637"></span>[3](#fn_637) On account of his worship
devoted to this (fire the sacrificer) is considered as an Âhitâgni (i.e.
as one who has set up the *S*rauta fires), and on account of his
fortnightly *K*aru sacrifices (on the days of the new and full moon) as
one who offers the sacrifices of the new and full moon (as prescribed in
the *S*rauta ritual); so (is it taught).

4\. If (the service at the domestic fire) has been interrupted for
twelve days, the sacrificer ought to set the fire up again.

5\. Or he should count all the sacrifices (that have been left out), and
should offer them.

6\. (The punarâdhâna or repeated setting up of the fire is performed in
the following way): in an enclosed space, having raised (the surface),
sprinkled it (with water), strewn it with sand, and covered it with
Udumbara or Plaksha branches, he silently brings together the things
belonging to (the sacrifice) according as he is able to get them,
produces fire by attrition out of a sacrificially pure piece of wood, or
gets a common fire, places it in a big vessel, sets it in a blaze, and
puts (fuel) on it with the words, 'Bhû*h*! Bhuva*h*! Suva*h*! Om!
Fixity!'

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

7\. He then puts wood on the fire, performs (the rites) down to the
Vyâh*ri*ti oblations, and offers two 'mindâ oblations' (i.e. oblations
for making up for defects) with (the two Mantras), 'If a defect (mindâ)
has arisen in me,' (and), 'Agni has given me back my eye' (Taitt.
Sa*m*h. III, 2, 5, 4).

8\. He offers three 'tantu oblations' with (the Mantras), 'Stretching
the weft (tantu)' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. III, 4, 2, 2), 'Awake, Agni!' (IV, 7,
13, 5), 'The thirty-three threads of the weft' (I, 5, 10, 4).

9\. He offers four 'abhyâvartin oblations' with (the Mantras), 'Agni who
turns to us (abhyâvartin)!' 'Agni Aṅgiras!' 'Again with sap,' 'With
wealth' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV. 2, 1, 2. 3).

10. <span id="fr_638"></span>[10](#fn_638) Having made oblations with
the single Vyâh*ri*tis and with (the three Vyâh*ri*tis together), and
having made an oblation with the verse, 'Thou art quick, Agni, and free
from imprecation. Verily (satyam) thou art quick. Held by us in our
quick mind (manas), with thy quick (mind) thou carriest the offering (to
the gods). Being quick bestow medicine on us! Svâhâ!'—this (last)
oblation contains an allusion to the mind (manas), it refers to
Pra*g*âpati, and alludes to the number seven (?),—he quickly repeats in
his mind the da*s*ahot*ri* formula (Taitt. Âra*n*y. III, 1, 1). Then he
makes the sagraha oblation (?); (then follow the

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

oblations), 'This, O Varu*n*a' (&c.; see I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of
the Sûtra). Then he serves food to the Brâhma*n*as and causes them to
say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' he then performs in the known
way the sacrifice of a mess of cooked food to Agni.

11\. Here he gives an optional gift to his Guru: a pair of clothes, a
milch cow, or a bull.

12. <span id="fr_639"></span>[12](#fn_639) If he sets out on a journey,
he makes the fire enter himself or the two kindling-sticks in the way
that has been described (in the *S*rauta-sûtra).

13\. Or let him make it enter a piece of wood, in the same way as into
the kindling-sticks.

14\. A piece of Khadira wood, or of Palâ*s*a, or of Udumbara, or of
A*s*vattha wood—

15\. With one of these kinds of wood he fetches, where he turns in (on
his journey), fire from the house of a *S*rotriya, and puts the (piece
of wood) into which his fire has entered, on (that fire), with the two
verses, 'He who has received the oblations' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 6, 5,
3), and 'Awake!' (IV, 7, 13, 5).

16\. The way in which he sacrifices has been explained (in the
*S*rauta-sûtra).

17\. If one half-monthly sacrifice has been omitted, he should have a
sacrifice to (Agni) Pathik*ri*t performed over this (fire). If two
(half-monthly sacrifices), to (Agni) Vai*s*vânara and Pathik*ri*t. If
more than two, (the fire) has to be set up again.

18\. If the fire is destroyed or lost, or if it is mixed with other
fires, it has to be set up again..

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_636"></span>[201:1](sbe30069.htm#fr_636) This chapter is
left out in Mât*ri*datta's commentary; it seems to be a later addition.
The division of the Sûtras is my own.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[201:3](sbe30069.htm#fr_637) 26, 3. For
tasyaupâsanena I think we should read tasyopâsanena.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[202:10](sbe30069.htm#fr_638) As to the Mantra,
'Thou art quick, &c.,' comp. above, I, 1, 3, 5, and the note on
*S*âṅkhâyana I, 9, 12. I cannot see why the oblation made with this
Mantra is called saptavatî (alluding to the number seven); possibly we
ought to read satyavatî (containing the word satyam, 'verily'). Can the
words sagraha*m* hutvâ mean, 'having performed the worship of the
planets (graha) at his sacrifice'?

<span id="fn_639"></span>[203:12](sbe30069.htm#fr_639) Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana V, 1, 1.
