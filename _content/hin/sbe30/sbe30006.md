### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 3. <span id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_115)

1. <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116) Having put wood on the (sacred)
fire, having swept"(the ground) round it, he should, bending his right
knee, pour out to the south of the fire his joined hands full of water
with (the words), 'Aditi! Give thy consent!'

2\. To the west with (the words), 'Anumati! Give thy consent!'

3\. To the north with (the words), 'Sarasvatî! Give thy consent!'

4\. With (the words), 'God Savit*ri*! Give thy impulse!'
(Mantra-Brâhma*n*a I, 1, 1) he should sprinkle (water) round the fire
once or thrice so as to keep his right side turned towards it—

5\. Interchanging the points at which he begins and ends the (sprinkling
of water), and sprinkling so as to encompass what he is going to offer
(with the streams of water).

6. <span id="fr_117"></span>[6](#fn_117) Let him then make oblations of
the sacrificial food, be it prepared or raw, over the fire.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

7. <span id="fr_118"></span>[7](#fn_118) If it is raw, he should
sacrifice after having washed it and having let the water drop off.

8\. If it consists in curds or milk or rice gruel, (he should sacrifice
it) with a brazen bowl, or with the pot in which the oblations of boiled
rice are prepared, or also with the (sacrificial spoon called) Sruva;

9. <span id="fr_119"></span>[9](#fn_120)  <span
id="fr_120"></span>[10](#fn_119) In the evening the first (oblation)
with (the formula), 'To Agni Svâhâ!' the second silently, in the middle
and in the north-eastern part (of the fire);

10\. In the morning the first (oblation) with (the formula), 'To Sûrya
Svâhâ!' the second again silently, again in the middle and in the
north-eastern part (of the fire).

11\. Having put a piece of wood (on the fire), and having again
sprinkled (water) round it, he should pour out again his joined hands
full of water in the same way (as prescribed in the Sûtras 1-3); in the
Mantras he says, 'Thou hast given thy consent' (instead of 'Give thy
consent').

12. <span id="fr_121"></span>[12](#fn_121) Having circumambulated the
fire so as to turn his right side towards it, having poured out the
remains of water, and filled the vessel again, and put it (in its proper
place), (he may do) whatever his business is.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

13. <span id="fr_122"></span>[13](#fn_122) In that way, from that time
(in which he has begun to offer the two daily sacrifices) he should
sacrifice, or should have sacrificed, over the (sacred) domestic fire,
till the end of his life.

14\. Here now they say:

15. <span id="fr_123"></span>[15](#fn_123) 'If they like, his wife may
offer the morning and evening oblations over the domestic fire. For his
wife is (as it were) his house, and that fire is the domestic fire.'

16. <span id="fr_124"></span>[16](#fn_124) When the morning meal or the
evening meal is ready, he should make (his wife) say, 'It is ready!'—

17\. In an unbroken voice (?), having made himself pure,

18. <span id="fr_125"></span>[18](#fn_125) He replies in a loud voice,
'Om!' Then in

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

a low voice: 'To that (food) I bring adoration. May it not fail!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_115"></span>[19:3](sbe30006.htm#fr_115) Rules regarding the
daily morning and evening sacrifice.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[19:1](sbe30006.htm#fr_116) 1-5.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 2, 17-21.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[19:6](sbe30006.htm#fr_117) The sacrificial
food is either k*ri*ta (prepared) or ak*ri*ta (unprepared). A mess of
boiled rice, for instance, is k*ri*ta, rice grains are ak*ri*ta.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[20:7](sbe30006.htm#fr_118) 7-12.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 5, 10-12. Prodaka in Sûtra 7 is explained by
pragatodaka.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[20:10](sbe30006.htm#fr_120) 9-10.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya, l.l. 13-15.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[20:9](sbe30006.htm#fr_119) The first oblation
is made in the middle, the second, sacred to Pra*g*âpati (*S*âṅkhâyana
I, 3, 15, &c.), in the north-eastern part of the sacred fire. The tenth
Sûtra of course is to be understood in the same way.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[20:12](sbe30006.htm#fr_121) The water is that
mentioned chap. 1, 24. With regard to <span id="page_21">p. 21</span>
yathârtham the commentary says, 'yathârtha*m* karmâpavargavihita*m*
Vâmadevyagânâdika*m* prâtarâhutipa*sk*âdvihita*m* brahmaya*gñ*a*m* vâ
kuryâd iti vâkya*s*esha*h*.' Similarly in the note on II, 4, 11 it is
said, 'yathârtham iti karma*n*a*h* parisamâptir u*k*yate;' II, 8, 17:
'yathârtha*m* tantrasamâpana*m* kuryât,' &c. In my translation I have
adopted the opinion of Professor Weber (Indische Studien, V, 375),
according to whom yathârtham simply means, '(he should behave) as
required by circumstances;' '(he should do) what happens to be his
business.'

<span id="fn_122"></span>[21:13](sbe30006.htm#fr_122) The last words are
â *g*îvitâvabh*ri*thât, which literally means 'till the Avabh*ri*tha
bath of his life.' The Avabh*ri*tha bath is the bath taken at the end of
certain sacrifices, so that the Avabh*ri*tha of life signifies death.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[21:15](sbe30006.htm#fr_123) Khâdira-G*ri*hya
I, 5, 17.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[21:16](sbe30006.htm#fr_124) 16-18.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya, l.l. 18, 19. In my translation of Sûtra 17 I have
adopted, though not quite without doubt, the conjecture of Professor
Roth given in Professor Knauer's note, p. 137. Professor Roth writes
*ri*tebhaṅgayâ vâ*k*â or *ri*tebhagayâ vâ*k*â: he says simply 'om,' and
not 'ó-o-ó-o-ó-om.' According to the commentary Sûtra 17 would refer to
the wife, not to the husband.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[21:18](sbe30006.htm#fr_125) The MSS. give
mâkhyâ and mâkshâ. We ought to read, tan ma kshâyîty upâ*ms*u. Comp.
Âpastamba II, 2, 3, 11
