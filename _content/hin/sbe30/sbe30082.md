### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 4, SECTION 10.

1. <span id="fr_675"></span>[1](#fn_675) On the new-moon day, in the
afternoon, or on days with an odd number in the dark fortnight the
monthly (*S*râddha is performed).

2\. Having prepared food for the Fathers and having arranged
southward-pointed Darbha grass as seats (for the Brâhma*n*as whom he is
going to invite), he invites an odd number of pure Brâhma*n*as who are
versed in the Mantras, with no deficient limbs, who are not connected
with himself by consanguinity or by their Gotra or by the Mantras, (such
as his teacher or his pupils).

3\. In feeding them he should not look at any (worldly) purposes.

4. <span id="fr_676"></span>[4](#fn_676) Having put wood on the fire and
strewn southward pointed and eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it,
having prepared the Â*g*ya in an Â*g*ya pot over which he has laid one
purifier, having sprinkled water round (the fire) from right to left,
and put a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire), he sacrifices with the
(spoon called) Darvi which is made of Udumbara wood.

5\. Having performed the rites down to the Â*g*yabhâga offerings, he
suspends his sacrificial cord over his right shoulder and calls the
Fathers (to his sacrifice) with (the verse), 'Come hither, O Fathers,
friends of Soma, on your hidden, ancient paths, bestowing on us
offspring and wealth and long life, a life of a hundred autumns.'

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

6. <span id="fr_677"></span>[6](#fn_677) He sprinkles water in the same
direction (i.e. towards the south) with (the verse), 'Divine waters,
send us Agni. May our Fathers enjoy this sacrifice. May they who receive
their nourishment every month bestow on us wealth with valiant heroes.'

7. <span id="fr_678"></span>[7](#fn_678) Having performed the rites down
to the Vyâh*ri*ti oblations with his sacrificial cord over his left
shoulder, he suspends it over his right shoulder and sacrifices with
(the following Mantras):

'To Soma with the Fathers, svadhâ! Adoration! 'To Yama with the Aṅgiras
and with the Fathers, svadhâ! Adoration!

'With the waters that spring in the east and those that come from the
north: with the waters, the supporters of the whole world, I interpose
another one between (myself and) my father. Svadhâ! Adoration!

'I interpose (another one) through the mountains;

'I interpose through the wide earth; through the sky and the points of
the horizon, through infinite bliss I interpose another one between
(myself and) my grandfather. Svadhâ! Adoration!

'I interpose (another one) through the seasons, through days and nights
with the beautiful twilight. Through half-months and months I interpose
another one between (myself and) my great-grandfather. Svadhâ!
Adoration!'

Then he sacrifices with their names: 'To N.N. svadhâ! Adoration! To N.N.
svadhâ! Adoration!'

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

'Wherein my mother has done amiss, abandoning her duty (towards her
husband), may my father take that sperm as his own; may another one fall
off from the mother. Svadhâ! Adoration!'

In the same way a second and a third verse with the alteration of the
Mantra, 'Wherein my grandmother,' 'Wherein my great-grandmother.'
