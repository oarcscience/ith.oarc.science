It is stated that the recitation of the Vir&ucirc;p&acirc;ksha and Prapada formulas and also the parisam&ucirc;hana (S&ucirc;tra 5) should be omitted at the so-called Kshiprahomas, i.e. at sacrifices performed without the assistance of a ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avid. See Bloomfield's notes on G<I>ri</I>hya-sa<I>m</I>graha I, 92. 96. Regarding the way in which a pr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;y&acirc;ma ('suppression of breath') is performed, comp. Vasish<I>th</I>a XXV, 13 (S.B.E. XIV, p. 126).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_408"></A><A HREF="sbe30037.htm#fr_408">115:10</A> There are two meals a day. The words of this S&ucirc;tra, 'Or three meals,' are explained in the commentary in the following way. He should, if he does not entirely abstain from food through three days, take only three meals during that time, i.e. he should take one meal a day. The commentator adds that some read abhakt&acirc;ni instead of bhakt&acirc;ni ('or he should omit three meals'), in which case the result would be the same. I prefer the reading <A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A> bhakt&acirc;ni, and propose to supply, not, 'he should eat,' but 'he should omit' ('abho<I>g</I>anam,' S&ucirc;tra 9). Possibly the meaning is that three successive meals should be omitted; thus also the compiler of the Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya seems to have understood this S&ucirc;tra. </P>
<P><A NAME="fn_409"></A><A HREF="sbe30037.htm#fr_409">116:11</A> Comp., for instance, below, chap. 6, 1.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_411"></A><A HREF="sbe30037.htm#fr_411">116:13</A> My translation of this S&ucirc;tra differs from the commentary. There it is said: 'An occurrence which is perceived only when it has happened (sannipatitam eva), and of which the cause by which it is produced is unknown, for instance the appearance of a halo, is called s&acirc;nnip&acirc;tika. Such s&acirc;nnip&acirc;tika ceremonies are uparish<I>t</I>&acirc;ddaiksha. The d&icirc;ksh&acirc; is the preparatory consecration (of the sacrificer), for instance by three days of fasting. A ceremony which has its d&icirc;ksh&acirc; after itself is called uparish<I>t</I>&acirc;ddaiksha.' Similarly the commentary on Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 1, 3 says, 'uparish<I>t</I>&acirc;t s&acirc;nnip&acirc;tike naimittike karma k<I>ri</I>tv&acirc;bho<I>g</I>anam.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_412"></A><A HREF="sbe30037.htm#fr_412">117:23</A> The commentary explains p&acirc;rthivam, 'p<I>ri</I>thivyartha<I>m</I> kriyate, iti p&acirc;rthivam, gr&acirc;makshetr&acirc;dyartham;' similarly the commentary on Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 1, 13 says, 'p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;patitvapr&acirc;ptyartham idam ukta<I>m</I> karma.'</P>
