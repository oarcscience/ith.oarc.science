### PA*T*ALA 7, SECTION 25.

1. <span id="fr_631"></span>[1](#fn_631) (a) 'May Vish*n*u make thy womb
ready; may Tvash*tri* frame the shape (of the child); may Pra*g*âpati
pour forth (the sperm); may Dhât*ri* give thee conception!

\(b\) 'Give conception, Sinîvâlî; give conception, Sarasvatî! May the
two A*s*vins, wreathed with lotus, give conception to thee!

\(c\) 'The embryo which the two A*s*vins produce with their golden
kindling-sticks: that embryo we call into thy womb, that thou mayst give
birth to it after ten months.

(d) <span id="fr_632"></span>[d](#fn_632) 'As the earth is pregnant with
Agni, as the heaven is with Indra pregnant, as Vâyu dwells in the womb
of the regions (of the earth), thus I place an embryo into thy womb.

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

\(e\) 'Open thy womb; take in the sperm; may a male child, an embryo be
begotten in the womb. The mother bears him ten months; may he be born,
the most valiant of his kin.

\(f\) 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a
man be born here, thy son, after ten months.

(g) <span id="fr_633"></span>[g](#fn_633) 'I do with thee (the work)
that is sacred to Pra*g*âpati; may an embryo enter thy womb. May a child
be born without deficiency, with all its limbs, not blind, not lame, not
sucked out by Pi*s*â*k*as.

(h) <span id="fr_634"></span>[h](#fn_634) 'By the superior powers which
the bulls shall produce for us, thereby become thou pregnant; may he be
born, the most valiant of his kin.

(i) <span id="fr_635"></span>[i](#fn_635) 'Indra has laid down in the
tree the embryo of the sterile cow and of the cow that prematurely
produces; thereby become thou pregnant; be a well-breeding cow'—

And (besides with the two Mantras), 'United are our names' (above, 24,
4), and, 'The concord of the *k*akravâka birds' (24, 6).

2\. (He should cohabit with her with the formulas), 'Bhû*h*! Through
Pra*g*âpati, the highest bull, I pour forth (the sperm); conceive a
valiant son, N.N.! Bhuva*h*! Through Pra*g*âpati, &c.—Suva*h*! Through
Pra*g*âpati, &c.' Thus he will gain a valiant son.

3\. The Mantras ought to be repeated whenever they cohabit, according to
Âtreya,

4\. Only the first time and after her monthly courses, according to
Bâdarâya*n*a.
