Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 3, SECTION 9.

1\. After he has studied the Veda, the bath (which signifies the end of
his studentship, is taken by him).

2\. We shall explain that (bath).

3\. During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing
moon, under (the Nakshatra) Rohi*n*î, (or) M*ri*ga*s*iras, (or) Tishya,
(or) Uttarâ

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Phalgunî, (or)
Hasta, (or) *K*itrâ, or the two Vi*s*âkhâs: under these (Nakshatras) he
may take the bath.

4. <span id="fr_542"></span>[4](#fn_542) He goes to a place near which
water is, puts wood on the fire, performs the rites down to the
oblations made with the Vyâh*ri*tis, and puts a piece of Palâ*s*a wood
on (the fire) with (the verse), 'Let us prepare this song like a
chariot, for *G*âtavedas who deserves it, with our prayer. For his
foresight in this assembly is a bliss to us. Agni! Dwelling in thy
friendship may we not suffer harm. Svâhâ!'

5\. Then he sacrifices with the Vyâh*ri*tis as above,

6. <span id="fr_543"></span>[6](#fn_543) (And another oblation with the
verse), 'The threefold age of *G*amadagni, Ka*s*yapa's threefold age,
the threefold age that belongs to the gods: may that threefold age be
mine. Svâhâ!'

7\. (Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varu*n*a,' &c.
(see above, I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sûtra).

8. <span id="fr_544"></span>[8](#fn_544) After he has served food to the
Brâhma*n*as, and has caused them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good
luck!' he discharges himself of his vow by (repeating) these (Mantras),
'Agni, lord of the vow, I have kept the vow.'

9\. Having (thus) discharged himself of his vow, he worships the sun
with the two (verses), 'Upwards

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

that (*G*âtavedas)' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 4, 43, 1), and, 'The bright'
(ibid.).

10. <span id="fr_545"></span>[10](#fn_545) With (the words), '(Loosen)
from us thy highest band, Varu*n*a,' he takes off the upper garment
which he has worn during his studentship, and puts on another (garment).
With (the words), '(Loosen) the lowest (fetter),' (he takes off) the
under garment; with (the words), '(Take) away the middle (fetter),' the
girdle. With (the words), 'And may we, O Âditya, under thy law (&c.),'
(he deposes) his staff. The girdle, the staff, and the black antelope's
skin he throws into water, sits down to the west of the fire, facing the
east, and touches the razor (with which he is going to be shaven), with
(the formula), 'Razor is thy name; the axe is thy father. Adoration to
thee! Do no harm to me!'

11. <span id="fr_546"></span>[11](#fn_546) Having handed over (that
razor) to the barber, he touches the water with which his hair is to be
moistened, with (the formula), 'Be blissful, (O waters), when we touch
you.' \[(The barber) then pours together warm and cold water. Having
poured warm (water) into cold (water)—\]

12. <span id="fr_547"></span>[12](#fn_547) (The barber) moistens the
hair near the right ear with (the words), 'May the waters moisten thee
for life, for old age and splendour' (Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ I, 2, 1, 1).

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

13. <span id="fr_548"></span>[13](#fn_548) With (the words), 'Herb!
protect him' (Taitt. Sa*m*h., loc. cit.), he puts an herb with the point
upwards into (the hair).

14. <span id="fr_549"></span>[14](#fn_549) With (the words), 'Axe! do no
harm to him!' (Taitt. Sa*m*h., loc. cit.), he touches (that herb) with
the razor.

15\. With (the words), 'Heard by the gods, I shave that (hair)' (Taitt.
Sa*m*h., loc. cit.), he shaves him.

16. <span id="fr_550"></span>[16](#fn_550) With (the formula), 'If thou
shavest, O shaver, my hair and my beard with the razor, the wounding,
the well-shaped, make our face resplendent, but do not take away our
life'—(the student who is going to take the bath), looks at the barber.

17\. He has the beard shaven first, then the hair in his arm-pits, then
the hair (on his head), then the hair of his body, then (he has) his
nails (cut).

18\. A person who is kindly disposed (towards the student), gathers the
hair, the beard, the hair of the body, and the nails (that have been cut
off), in a lump of bull's dung, and buries (that lump of dung) in a
cow-stable, or near an Udumbara tree, or in a clump of Darbha grass,
with (the words), 'Thus I

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

hide the sin of N.N., who belongs to the Gotra N.N.'

19\. Having rubbed himself with powder such as is used in bathing, he
cleanses his teeth with a stick of Udumbara wood—

<span id="fn_542"></span>[162:4](sbe30052.htm#fr_542) 9, 4. Comp. I, 1,
3, 4; *Ri*g-veda I, 94, 1. 'Where the words are used, "He puts wood on
the fire" (agnim upasamâdhâya), he should prepare the ground by raising
it, &c., should carry the fire to that place, should put wood on it, and
then he should sacrifice in the fire. Where those words are not used, he
should (only) strew grass round the fire which is (already) established
in its proper place, and should thus perform the sacrifice.'
Mât*ri*datta.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[162:6](sbe30052.htm#fr_543) *S*âṅkhâyana I,
28, 9.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[162:8](sbe30052.htm#fr_544) Comp. I, 2, 7, 25;
8, 7.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[163:10](sbe30052.htm#fr_545) The words quoted
in this Sûtra are the parts of a *Rik* which is found in Taittirîya
Sa*m*hitâ I, 5, 11, 3.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[163:11](sbe30052.htm#fr_546) The words which I
have included in brackets are wanting in some of the MSS., and are not
explained in the commentaries. They are doubtless a spurious addition.
Comp. Â*s*valâyana I, 57, 6, &c.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[163:12](sbe30052.htm#fr_547) Pâraskara II, 1,
9. The same expression dakshi*n*a*m* godânam, of which I have treated
there in the note, is used in this Sûtra. Comp., besides,
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 28, 9; Âpastamba-*S*rauta-sûtra <span
id="page_164">p. 164</span> X, 5, 8; *S*atapatha-Br. III, 1, 2, 6.
According to Mât*ri*datta, there is some difference of opinion between
the different teachers as to whether the Mantras for the moistening of
the hair and the following rites are to be repeated by the teacher or by
the barber.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[164:13](sbe30052.htm#fr_548) Â*s*valâyana I,
17, 8; Pâraskara II, 1, 10; Âpastamba-*S*raut., loc. cit.;
Kâtyâyana-Sraut. VII, 2, 10. The parallel texts prescribe that one
Ku*s*a blade, or three Ku*s*a blades, should be put into the hair.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[164:14](sbe30052.htm#fr_549) Yâ*gñ*ikadeva in
his commentary on Kâtyâyana (loc. cit.) says, kshure*n*âbhinidhâya
kshuradhârâm antarhitat*rin*asyopari nidhâya.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[164:16](sbe30052.htm#fr_550) Â*s*valâyana I,
17, 16. Comp. also *Ri*g-veda I, 24, 11.
