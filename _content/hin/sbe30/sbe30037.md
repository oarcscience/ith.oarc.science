### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 5.

1. <span id="fr_405"></span>[1](#fn_405) At (the sacrifices) for the
obtainment of special wishes, which will be henceforth described,

2\. And, according to some (teachers), also at (the sacrifices)
described above (the following rites should be performed).

3\. He should touch the earth, to the west of the fire, with his two
hands turned downwards, with (the verse), 'We partake of the earth’s'
(MB. II, 4, 1).

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

4\. In the night-time (he pronounces that Mantra so that it ends with
the word) 'goods' (vasu), in the day-time (so that it ends) with
'wealth' (dhanam).

5\. With the three verses, 'This praise' (MB. II, 4, 2-4) he should wipe
along (with his hands) around (the fire).

6. <span id="fr_406"></span>[6](#fn_406) Before sacrifices the
Virûpâksha formula (MB. II, 4, 6) (should be recited).

7\. And at (ceremonies) which are connected with special wishes, the
Prapada formula (MB. II, 4, 5)—(in the following way):

8\. He should murmur (the Prapada formula), 'Austerities and splendour,'
should perform one suppression of breath, and should, fixing his
thoughts on the object (of his wish), emit his breath, when beginning
the Virûpâksha formula.

9. <span id="fr_407"></span>[9](#fn_407) When undertaking ceremonies for
the obtainment of special wishes, let him fast during three (days and)
nights,

10. <span id="fr_408"></span>[10](#fn_408) Or (let him omit) three
meals.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

11. <span id="fr_409"></span>[11](#fn_409) At such ceremonies, however,
as are repeated regularly, (let him do so only) before their first
performance.

12. <span id="fr_410"></span>[12](#fn_410) He should (simply) fast,
however, before such ceremonies as are performed on sacrificial days
(i.e. on the first day of the fortnight).

13. <span id="fr_411"></span>[13](#fn_411) (At a ceremony) which ought
to be performed immediately (after the occurrence by which it has been
caused), the consecration follows after (the ceremony itself).

14\. Let him recite the Prapada formula (Sûtras 7. 8), sitting in the
forest on Darbha grass,

15\. Of which the panicles are turned towards the east, if he is
desirous of holy lustre,

16\. To the north, if desirous of sons and of cattle,

17\. To both directions, if desirous of both.

18\. One who desires that his stock of cattle may increase, should offer
a sacrifice of rice and barley

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

with (the verse), 'He who has a thousand arms, the protector of
cow-keepers' (MB. II, 4, 7).

19\. Having murmured the Kautomata verse (ibid. 8) over fruits of a big
tree, he should give them—

20\. To a person whose favour he wishes to gain.

21\. One (fruit) more (than he gives to that person), an even number (of
fruits), he should keep himself.

22\. There are the five verses, 'Like a tree' (MB. II, 4, 9-13).

23. <span id="fr_412"></span>[23](#fn_412) With these firstly a ceremony
(is performed) for (obtaining property on) the earth.

24\. He should fast one fortnight,

25\. Or, if he is not able (to do so, he may drink) once a day
rice-water,

26\. In which he can see his image.

27. <span id="fr_413"></span>[27](#fn_413) This observance (forms part)
of (all) fortnightly observances.

28. <span id="fr_414"></span>[28](#fn_414) He then should in the
full-moon night plunge up to his navel into a pool which does not dry
up, and should sacrifice at the end of (each of those five) verses fried
grains with his mouth into the water, with the word Svâhâ.

29\. Now (follows) another (ceremony with the same five verses).

30\. With the first (verse) one who is desirous of the enjoyment (of
riches), should worship the sun, within sight of (that) person rich in
wealth (from

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

whom he hopes to obtain wealth); then he will obtain wealth.

31\. With the second (verse) one who desires that his stock of horses
and elephants may increase, should sacrifice fried grains, while the sun
has a halo.

32\. With the third (verse) one who desires that his flocks may
increase, (should sacrifice) sesamum seeds, while the moon (has a halo).

33\. Having worshipped the sun with the fourth (verse), let him acquire
wealth; then he will come back safe and wealthy.

34\. Having worshipped the sun with the fifth (verse) let him return to
his house. He will safely return home; he will safely return home.

Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 2, 6 seq.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[115:6](sbe30037.htm#fr_406) 6-8.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 2, 23; G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha I, 96. It is stated that
the recitation of the Virûpâksha and Prapada formulas and also the
parisamûhana (Sûtra 5) should be omitted at the so-called Kshiprahomas,
i.e. at sacrifices performed without the assistance of a ya*gñ*avid. See
Bloomfield's notes on G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha I, 92. 96. Regarding the way
in which a prâ*n*âyâma ('suppression of breath') is performed, comp.
Vasish*th*a XXV, 13 (S.B.E. XIV, p. 126).

Khâdira-G*ri*hya IV, 1, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[115:10](sbe30037.htm#fr_408) There are two
meals a day. The words of this Sûtra, 'Or three meals,' are explained in
the commentary in the following way. He should, if he does not entirely
abstain from food through three days, take only three meals during that
time, i.e. he should take one meal a day. The commentator adds that some
read abhaktâni instead of bhaktâni ('or he should omit three meals'), in
which case the result would be the same. I prefer the reading <span
id="page_116">p. 116</span> bhaktâni, and propose to supply, not, 'he
should eat,' but 'he should omit' ('abho*g*anam,' Sûtra 9). Possibly the
meaning is that three successive meals should be omitted; thus also the
compiler of the Khâdira-G*ri*hya seems to have understood this Sûtra.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[116:11](sbe30037.htm#fr_409) Comp., for
instance, below, chap. 6, 1.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[116:12](sbe30037.htm#fr_410) Comp. below,
chaps. 6, 4; 8, 23.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[116:13](sbe30037.htm#fr_411) My translation of
this Sûtra differs from the commentary. There it is said: 'An occurrence
which is perceived only when it has happened (sannipatitam eva), and of
which the cause by which it is produced is unknown, for instance the
appearance of a halo, is called sânnipâtika. Such sânnipâtika ceremonies
are uparish*t*âddaiksha. The dîkshâ is the preparatory consecration (of
the sacrificer), for instance by three days of fasting. A ceremony which
has its dîkshâ after itself is called uparish*t*âddaiksha.' Similarly
the commentary on Khâdira-G*ri*hya IV, 1, 3 says, 'uparish*t*ât
sânnipâtike naimittike karma k*ri*tvâbho*g*anam.'

<span id="fn_412"></span>[117:23](sbe30037.htm#fr_412) The commentary
explains pârthivam, 'p*ri*thivyartha*m* kriyate, iti pârthivam,
grâmakshetrâdyartham;' similarly the commentary on Khâdira-G*ri*hya IV,
1, 13 says, 'p*ri*thivîpatitvaprâptyartham idam ukta*m* karma.'

<span id="fn_413"></span>[117:27](sbe30037.htm#fr_413) Comp. below,
chap. 6, 12.
