<p>1.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> On the following day the Anvash<I>t</I>akya (ceremony is performed),</p>  
<p>2. Or on the day which follows after that.</p>  
<p>3. To the south-east (of the house), in the intermediate direction (between south and east), they partition off (a place with mats or the like).</p>  
<p>4. The long-side (of that place should lie) in the same (direction).</p>  
<p>5. They should perform (the ceremonies) turning their faces towards the same (direction).</p>  
<p>6. (It should measure) at least four prakramas (i.e. steps).</p>  
<p>7. (It should have) its entrance from the west.</p>  
<p>8.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> In the northern part of that enclosure they make the Laksha<I>n</I>a and carry the fire (to that place).</p>  
<p>9. To the west of the fire he places a mortar so that it stands firmly, and husks, holding his left hand uppermost, one handful of rice-grains which he has seized with one grasp.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. When (the rice) has been husked,</p>  
<p>11. He should once carefully remove the husks.</p>  
<p>12.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> And then he should cut off a lump of flesh from that thigh and should cut it in small pieces on a new slaughtering-bench,</p>  
<p>13. (With the intention) that the Pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as (or lumps of food offered to the Manes) should be thoroughly mixed up with flesh.</p>  
<p>14.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> On the same fire he cooks one mess of rice-grains and one of meat, stirring up the one and the other separately, from right to left, with the two pot-ladles.</p>  
<p>15.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> After he has cooked them, he should pour (&Acirc;<I>g</I>ya) on them, should take them from the fire towards the south, and should not pour (&Acirc;<I>g</I>ya) on them again.</p>  
<p>16. In the southern part of the enclosure (S&ucirc;tras 3 seq.) he should have three pits dug, so that the eastern (pit is dug) first,</p>  
<p>17. One span in length, four inches in breadth and in depth.</p>  
<p>18.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> Having made the Laksha<I>n</I>a to the east of the eastern pit, they carry the fire (to that place).</p>  
<p>19. Having carried the fire round the pits on their west side, he should put it down on the Laksha<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>20. He strews (round the fire) one handful of Darbha grass which he has cut off in one portion.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A></p>  
<p>21. And (he strews it into) the pits,</p>  
<p>22. Beginning with the eastern (pit).</p>  
<p>23. To the west of the pits he should have a layer spread out,</p>  
<p>24. Of southward-pointed Ku<I>s</I>a grass,</p>  
<p>25. Inclined towards the south.</p>  
<p>26. And he should put a mat on it.</p>  
<p>27.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> To that (layer of grass) they fetch for him (the following sacrificial implements), one by one, from right to left:</p>  
<p>28. The two pots in which sacrificial food has been cooked (S&ucirc;tra 14), the two pot-ladles (S&ucirc;tra 14), one brazen vessel, one Darv&icirc; (spoon), and water.</p>  
<p>29.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> (The sacrificer's) wife places a stone on the Barhis and pounds (on that stone the fragrant substance called) Sthagara.</p>  
<p>30.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A> And on the same (stone) she grinds some collyrium, and anoints therewith three Darbha blades, including the interstices (between the single blades?).</p>  
<p>31.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> He should also get some oil made from sesamum seeds,</p>  
<p>32.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A> And a piece of linen tape.</p>  
<p>33.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_367"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A> After he has invited an odd number of blameless Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, whose faces should be turned towards the north, to sit down on a pure spot,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>34.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A> And has given them Darbha grass (in order that they may sit down thereon),</p>  
<p>35.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A> He gives them (pure) water and afterwards sesamum-water, pronouncing his father's name, 'N.N.! To thee this sesamum-water, and to those who follow thee here, and to those whom thou followest. To thee Svadh&acirc;!'</p>  
<p>36.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A> After he has touched water, (he does) the same for the other two.</p>  
<p>37.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> In the same way (he gives them) perfumes.</p>  
<p>38.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A> The words in which he addresses (the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as) when going to sacrifice, are, 'I shall offer it into the fire.'</p>  
<p>39. After they have replied, 'Offer it,' he should cut off (the prescribed portions) from the two messes of cooked food (S&ucirc;tra 14), (and should put those portions) into the brazen vessel. He then should sacrifice, picking out (portions of the Havis) with the pot-ladle, the first (oblation) with (the words), 'Sv&acirc;h&acirc; to Soma Pit<I>ri</I>mat,' the second with (the words), 'Sv&acirc;h&acirc; to Agni Kavyav&acirc;hana' (MB. II, 3, 1. 2).</p>
