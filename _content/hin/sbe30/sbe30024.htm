<p>2. (Or) nine, six, three (years).</p>  
<p>3. These are the various possibilities.</p>  
<p>4. Or also one year, according to some (teachers).</p>  
<p>5. (In this case), however, the observances are enhanced.</p>  
<p>6. (Keeping the Vrata through one year is allowed only) if (the student's) ancestors have learnt the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc; verses.</p>  
<p>7. There is also a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the Rauruki (<I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;, in which it is said):</p>  
<p>8. 'The mothers forsooth say to their sons, when they suckle them:</p>  
<p>9. '"Become men, my little sons, who endeavour to accomplish the <I>S</I>akvar&icirc;-vrata!"'</p>  
<p>10.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> During (the Vrata preparatory to the study of) these (i.e. the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc; verses), touching water at the time of each Savana (is prescribed).</p>

<p>12.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> In the evening, after he has touched water, he should not eat, before he has put the piece of wood on the fire.</p>

<p>13. He should wear dark clothes.</p>  
<p>14. He should eat dark food.</p>  
<p>15. Let him be devoted to his teacher.</p>  
<p>16. Let him make way for nobody.</p>  
<p>17. He should be addicted to austerities.</p>  
<p>18. He should stand in day-time.</p>  
<p>19. He should sit at night.</p>  
<p>20. And when it is raining, he should not retire to a covered place.</p>  
<p>21. He should say to (the god) when he sends rain, 'The <I>S</I>akvar&icirc;s are water.'</p>  
<p>22. When (the god) sends lightning, he should say to him, 'Such forsooth is the nature of the <I>S</I>akvar&icirc;s.'</p>

<p>24. Let him not cross a river without touching water.</p>  
<p>25. Let him not ascend a ship.</p>  
<p>26. If his life is in danger, however, he may ascend (a ship), after having touched water.</p>  
<p>27. In the same way (he should touch water) having disembarked.</p>  
<p>28. For in water the virtue of the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc;s is contained.</p>  
<p>29. If he practises these duties, (the god) Par<I>g</I>anya will send rain according to his wish.</p>  
<p>30.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A> The rules about dark (clothes), standing, sitting, (making) way, and (dark) food may be considered as optional.</p>  
<p>31. After he has kept his vow through one third (of the prescribed time, the teacher) should</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></p>  
<p>sing to him the (first) Stotriya verse (of the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc;s).</p>  
<p>32. In the same way the two other Stotriya verses (after two-thirds of the time and at the end of the whole time).</p>  
<p>33. Or all (the three verses) at the end of the whole (time).</p>  
<p>34. He should sing them to (the student) who has fasted and shuts his eyes.</p>  
<p>35.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A> Having filled a brass vessel with water, having thrown into it all sorts of herbs, and dipped (the student's) hands into it, the teacher should veil (the student's eyes) from left to right with a (new) garment that has not yet been washed.</p>  
<p>36.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A> Or he should sing (the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc;s to him) immediately after he has veiled (his eyes).</p>  
<p>37.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> With veiled eyes, keeping silence, he should abstain from food through a period of three nights, or through one day and one night.</p>  
<p>38. Or he should stand in the forest till sunset (and spend the night in the village).</p>  
<p>39. On the next morning he should put wood on the fire in the forest, should sacrifice with the Mah&acirc;vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis, and should cause the student to look at (the following objects, viz.)</p>  
<p>40. Fire, &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya, the sun, a Brahman, a bull, food, water, curds,</p>

<p>43.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A> After the ceremony for averting evil has been performed, the student respectfully salutes the teacher.</p>

<p>47. Let him provide his teacher with clothes, according to some (teachers).</p>  
<p>48.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> A mess of cooked food, sacred to Indra, (is prepared). Let him sacrifice of that (food) with this verse, 'To the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>, to the S&acirc;man we sacrifice' (S&acirc;ma-veda I, 369), or (with the verse), 'The lord of the seat, the wonderful' (ibid. I, 171), or with both (verses).</p>  
<p>49.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A> This (he should do) at (all) the Anuprava<I>k</I>an&icirc;ya ceremonies.</p>

<p>52. After (the student) has returned (from the forest), he should entertain his teacher and his retinue with food,</p>  
<p>53. And his fellow-students who have come together.</p>  
<p>54. The way to sing the <I>G</I>yesh<I>th</I>as&acirc;mans has been explained by (the statements given with regard to) the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc;-(vrata).</p>
