contain).

3\. In the same way with the next (Mantras—M. I, 13, 7-10—he should
address the following objects), according to the characteristics (which
those Mantras contain): a conspicuous tree, a heap of excrements, the
skirt (of his garment) which is blown against him by the wind, and a
shrieking bird.

4\. One (for instance, the wife's father) who wishes that the hearts of
both (husband and wife) may be in accord should observe chastity through
at least three nights and should prepare a Sthâlîpâka. Then (the
ceremonies) from the putting (of wood) on (the fire) down to the
Â*g*yabhâga oblations (are performed), and while the wife takes hold of
him, he sacrifices of the Sthâlîpâka the oblations (indicated by the)
next (Mantras; M. I, 14, 1-7); then he enters upon the performance of
the *G*aya and following oblations, and performs (the rites) down to the
sprinkling (of water) round (the fire). (The remains of) the
(sacrificial food) with butter, he should give to eat to an even number
of Brâhma*n*as, at least to two, and should cause them to pronounce
wishes for his success.

5. <span id="fr_754"></span>[5](#fn_754) When the moon, on the following
day, will be in conjunction with Tishya, she strews three times seven
barley-grains around (the plant) Clypea Hernandifolia with (the
formula), 'If thou belongest to Varu*n*a, I redeem thee from Varu*n*a.
If thou belongest to Soma, I redeem thee from Soma.'

6\. On the following day she should set upright (the plant) with the
next (verse; M. I, 15, 1), should recite the next three (verses; M. I,
15, 2-4) over it, should tie (its root) with the next (verse; M. I, 15,
5) to her hands so that (her husband) does not see it, and should, when
they have gone to bed, embrace her husband with her arms, with the verse
alluding to the word upadhâna ('putting on;' M. I, 15, 6).

7\. Thus he will be subject to her.

8\. By this (rite) also (a wife) overcomes her co-wives.

9\. For this same purpose she worships the sun daily with the next
Anuvâka (M. I, 16).

10\. If a wife is affected with consumption or is otherwise sick, one
who has to observe chastity, should rub her limbs with young lotus
leaves which are still rolled up, and with lotus roots, with the next
(formulas, limb by limb) according to the characteristics (contained in
those formulas; M. I, 17, 1-6), and should throw away (the leaves and
roots) towards the west.

11\. With the next (verses; M. I, 17, 7-10) he should give the wife's
garment (which she has worn at the wedding \[?\]) to (a Brâhma*n*a) who
knows this (ceremony).
