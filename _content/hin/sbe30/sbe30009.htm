<P><A NAME="fn_142"></A><A HREF="sbe30009.htm#fr_142">28:1</A> 6, 1. The teacher's name is spelt elsewhere M&acirc;nutantavya, which seems to be the more correct spelling. The Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya (II, I, 5) has M&acirc;nadantavya. Dr. Knauer has called attention to several other blunders of the MSS., which are unusually frequent just in this passage. For I have no doubt that in spite of the unanimous agreement of the MSS. we are to change m&acirc;nushy&acirc;hutir into m&acirc;nushasy&acirc;hutir, and I think it very probable, to say the least, that in S&ucirc;tra 4 k&acirc;mayetaupavasathikam should be corrected into k&acirc;mayey&acirc;t&acirc;m aupavasathikam, though here the singular could possibly be defended by very faithful believers in the authority of the MSS.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_143"></A><A HREF="sbe30009.htm#fr_143">29:4</A> Or, which is pleasant to him? See the note on &sect; 1.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_145"></A><A HREF="sbe30009.htm#fr_145">29:14</A> The ceremonies stated in this S&ucirc;tra have to be performed by the Brahman. This is stated in the commentary, and the comparison <A NAME="page_30"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 30</FONT></A> of parallel texts leaves no doubt as to the correctness of this view. Thus Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in says (I, 1): etasmin k&acirc;le brahm&acirc; ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>opav&icirc;ta<I>m</I> k<I>ri</I>tv&acirc;pa &acirc;<I>k</I>amy&acirc;pare<I>n</I>&acirc;gni<I>m</I> dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;tikramya brahmasadan&acirc;t t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>a<I>m</I> nirasya, &amp;c. Comp. also the corresponding passages of the <I>S</I>rauta ritual given by Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 17. I do not think it probable, however, that we should read brahm&acirc;<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>san&acirc;t, so that it would be distinctly expressed by the text that the Brahman is the subject (comp. Dr. Knauer's Introduction, p. viii). For we read in this same S&ucirc;tra brahm&acirc;san&acirc;t t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>am abhisa<I>m</I>g<I>ri</I>hya; in S&ucirc;tra 15, brahm&acirc;sana upavi<I>s</I>ati; in S&ucirc;tra 21, brahm&acirc;sane nidh&acirc;ya: of these passages it is in the second made probable by the sense, and it is certain in the third, that brahm&acirc;sana is to be understood as a compound equal to brahmasadana. Thus it would, in my opinion, be unnatural not to explain it in the same way also in the first passage. Par&acirc;vasu is opposed to Vasu (S&ucirc;tra 15) in the same way as some texts, for instance &Acirc;pastamba, oppose Par&acirc;gvasu to Arv&acirc;gvasu.</P>
