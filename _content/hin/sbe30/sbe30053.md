Intangible Textual Heritage

### PA*T*ALA 3, SECTION 10.

1\. With (the formula), 'Stand in your places for the sake of the
enjoyment of food. Stand in your places for the sake of long life. Stand
in your places for the sake of holy lustre. May I be blessed with long
life, an enjoyer of food, adorned with holy lustre.'

2\. Then (the teacher) makes him wash himself with lukewarm water, with
the three verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, I, 5,
1), with the four verses, 'The gold-coloured, clean, purifying (waters)'
(Taitt. Sa*m*h. V, 6, 1), and with the Anuvâka, 'The purifier, the
heavenly one' (Taitt. Brâhma*n*a I, 4, 8).

3. <span id="fr_551"></span>[3](#fn_551) Or (instead of performing these
rites in the neighbourhood of water) they make an enclosure in a
cow-stable and cover it (from all sides); that (the student) enters
before sunrise, and in that (enclosure) the whole (ceremony) is
performed. 'On that day the sun does not shine upon him,' some say. 'For
he who shines (i.e. the sun), shines by the splendour of those who have
taken the bath. Therefore the face of a Snâtaka is, as it were,
resplendent (?).'

4. <span id="fr_552"></span>[4](#fn_552) (His friends or relations)
bring him all sorts of

perfumes, or ground sandal wood; he besprinkles that (with water), and
worships the gods by raising his joined hands towards the east, with
(the formulas), 'Adoration to Graha (the taker) and to Abhigraha (the
seizer)! Adoration to *S*âka and *G*a*ñg*abha! Adoration to those
deities who are seizers!' (Then) he anoints himself with (that salve of
sandal wood) with (the verse), 'The scent that dwells with the Apsaras,
and the splendour that dwells with the Gandharvas, divine and human
scent: may that here enter upon me!'

5\. They bring him a pair of (new) garments that have not yet been
washed. He besprinkles them (with water) and puts on the under garment
with (the formula), 'Thou art Soma's body; protect my body! Thou who art
my own body, enter upon me; thou who art a blissful body, enter upon
me.' Then he touches water, (puts on) the upper garment with the same
(Mantra), and sits down to the west of the fire, facing the east.

6. <span id="fr_553"></span>[6](#fn_553) They bring him two ear-rings
and a perforated pellet of sandal wood or of Badarî wood, overlaid with
gold (at its aperture); these two things he ties to a Darbha blade,
holds them over the fire, and pours over them (into the fire) oblations
(of ghee) with (the Mantras),

'May this gold which brings long life and splendour and increase of
wealth, and which gets through (all adversities), enter upon me for the
sake of long life, of splendour, and of victory. Svâhâ!

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> '(This gold)
brings high gain, superiority in battles, superiority in assemblies; it
conquers treasures. All perfections unitedly dwell together in this
gold. Svâhâ!

'I have obtained an auspicious name like (the name) of a father of gold.
Thus may (the gold) make me shine with golden lustre; (may it make me)
beloved among many people; may it make me full of holy lustre. Svâhâ!

'Make me beloved among the gods; make me beloved with Brahman (i.e.
among the Brâhma*n*as), beloved among Vai*s*yas and *S*ûdras; make me
beloved among the kings (i.e. among the Kshatriyas). Svâhâ!

'This herb is protecting, overcoming, and powerful. May it make me shine
with golden lustre; (may it make me) beloved among many people; may it
make me full of holy lustre. Svâhâ!'

7\. Having thrice washed (the two ear-rings) in a vessel of water with
the same five (Mantras), without the word Svâhâ, (moving them round in
the water) from left to right—
