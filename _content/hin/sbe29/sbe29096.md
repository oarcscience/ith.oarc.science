------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 4.

1 <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_336). 'Unerring mind, vigorous eye
(is) the sun, the noblest of the stars. Inauguration, do no harm to
me!'—with (these words) they look at Savit*ri* (I.e. the sun).

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

2\. One (verse), 'You both the gladdening one' (Rig-veda X, 131, 4), and
the three (verses), 'Blessing to us on the paths' (Rig-veda X, 63,
15-17) (are to be repeated before the recitation) of the Mahâvrata
(chapter).

3\. But (at that) of the *S*akvarî (verses) before (the formula
mentioned in the first Sara):

4 <span id="fr_338"></span>[4](#fn_337). The three T*rik*as, 'To him,
the thirsty one' (Rig-veda VI, 42, 1-3), 'The wealthiest (Soma), O
wealthy one' (VI, 44, 1-3), 'Him who does no harm to you' (VI, 44, 4-6),
(the verse), 'To him, to him the sap of the herb' (VI, 42, 4), (and the
verse), "Verily thou art a hero' (VIII, 81, 28)—thus for the *S*akvarî
(verses) before and afterwards.

5\. Now for the Upanishad (texts)—

6\. The same (recitation) as for the Mahâvrata.

7 <span id="fr_339"></span>[7](#fn_338). For the Sa*m*hitâs, however,
before (the text given in the first Sûtra the formula has to be
recited), 'I shall speak right, I shall speak truth (&c.)'—this is the
difference (in the case of the Sa*m*hitâs).

8 <span id="fr_340"></span>[8](#fn_339). Now for the Mantha the two
verses (have to be recited) before (the formula given in the first
Sûtra), 'This we entreat of Savitar,' 'That glorious (splendour) of
Savitar' (Rig-veda V, 82, 1; III, 62, 10).

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

9\. With (the formula), 'Unerring mind' (see Sûtra 1), then follow the
expiatory formulas that belong to the (different) sections.

10\. (All) this on one day.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[145:1](sbe29096.htm#fr_337) 4, 1. The formula
'Adabdha*m* mana*h*,' &c. has to be recited before each of the single
Âra*n*yaka texts (the *S*akvarî verses, the Mahâvrata, &c.); to this
formula are added, before or after it, as the case may be, other texts
specified in the Sûtras 2-8. Of these there can be no doubt about the
meaning of Sûtras 7, 8, treating of the introductory formulas of the
Sa*m*hitâ section (Kaush. Âr. VII-VIII) and of the Mantha section (ibid.
IX): before the text adabdham, &c. are to be added, in the first case
the formula *ri*ta*m* vadishyâmi, &c., in the second case two *Rik*as
addressed to Savit*ri*. These formulas and verses have been received
into the Âra*n*yaka text and are found there in the order here stated,
at the beginning of books VII and IX. The meaning of the words
sa*m*hitânâ*m* tu pûrvam (Sûtra 7) having thus been established, I can
see no reason why we should not interpret the words *s*akvarî*n*â*m* to
pûrvam (Sûtra 3) quite in the same way. Thus the introductory
benediction for the recital of the *S*akvarî verses would consist,
firstly of the verses stated in Sûtra 4, then of the formula adabdham,
&c.; those verses would have to be repeated again after the *S*akvarî
verses (end of Sûtra 4). The recitation of the Mahâvrata (Sûtras 1, 2)
and of the Upanishads (Sûtra 5) is preceded by adabdham, &c., and then
by the four verses stated in Sûtra 2. The interpretation which
Nârâya*n*a gives of this Sûtra is not quite the same as that which I
have here proposed; see p. 163 of the German edition.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[146:4](sbe29096.htm#fr_338) According to the
reading of some MSS. we should have to translate, or (the verse),
'Verily,' &c.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[146:7](sbe29096.htm#fr_339) On the Sa*m*hitâs
(Kaush. Âr. VII, VIII) see Max Müller, Rig-veda Prâti*s*âkhya, pp. 4
seq.; Ait. Âra*n*yaka III (pp. 305 seqq., ed. Bibl. Ind.; Sacred Books
of the East, I, pp. 247 seq.).

<span id="fn_339"></span>[146:8](sbe29096.htm#fr_340) Regarding the
description of the Mantha sacrifice (Kaush. Âr. IX) which has to be
performed by one who wishes to attain greatness, comp. *S*atap.
Brâhma*n*a XIV, 9, 2; *Kh*ând. Up. V, 2, 4; Sacred Books of the East, I,
p. 75.
