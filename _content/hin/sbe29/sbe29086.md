### KHA*ND*A 5.

2\. Let him sacrifice with (the hymn), 'O gods, the dove' (Rig-veda X,
165), verse by verse.

3\. If he has seen a bad dream or an occurrence boding misfortune,

4\. Or when the cawing of a crow is heard in (the dead of) night,

5\. And in the case of other prodigies,

6\. Let him cook rice-grains with milk,

7\. With the milk of a cow that has a calf of the same colour (with her
own),

8\. But in no case of a black (cow),

9\. And let him sacrifice with the night-hymn (Rig-veda X, 127), verse
by verse.

10\. Having eaten the remnants of those oblations with the
Mahâvyâh*ri*tis,

11\. And having recited over his ears (the verse), 'Blessing with our
ears' (Rig-veda I, 89, 8),

12\. And over himself (the verse), 'May a hundred autumns be before us,
ye gods' (ibid. 9),

13\. He shall give something to the Brâhma*n*as.
