### KA*ND*IKÂ 2.

1 <span id="fr_528"></span>[1](#fn_527). Now the rules how one should
recite (the Vedic texts) for one's self.

2\. He should go out of the village to the east or to the north, bathe
in water, sip water on a clean spot, clad with the sacrificial cord; he
should spread out, his garment being not wet, a great quantity of Darbha
grass, the tufts of which are directed towards the east, and should sit
down thereon with his face turned to the east, making a lap, putting
together his hands in which he holds purifiers (i.e. Ku*s*a blades), so
that the right hand lies uppermost.

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

It is understood (in the *S*ruti), 'This is what Darbha grass is: it is
the essence of waters and herbs. He thus makes the Brahman provided with
essence.'

Looking at the point where heaven and earth touch each other, or
shutting his eyes, or in whatever way he may deem himself apt (for
reciting the Veda), thus adapting himself he should recite (the sacred
texts) for himself.

3\. The Vyâh*ri*tis preceded by (the syllable) Om (are pronounced
first).

4\. He (then) repeats the Sâvitrî (Rig-Veda III, 62, 10), (firstly) Pâda
by Pâda, (then) hemistich by hemistich, thirdly the whole.
