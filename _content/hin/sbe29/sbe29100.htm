<p>(The <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> quoted above then says), 'He who with an oblation'&#151;and, 'He who with knowledge;' even by learning only satisfaction is produced (in the gods).</p>  
<p>Seeing this the <I>Ri</I>shi has said, 'To him who does not keep away from himself the cows, to him who longs for cows, who dwells in the sky, speak a wonderful word, sweeter than ghee and honey.' Thereby he means, 'This my word, sweeter than ghee and honey, is satisfaction (to the god); may it be sweeter.'</p>  
<p>(And another <I>Ri</I>shi says), 'To thee, O Agni, by this <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> we offer an oblation prepared by our heart; may these be oxen, bulls, and cows.' (Thereby he means), 'They are my oxen, bulls, and cows (which I offer to the god), they who study this text, reciting it for themselves (as their Sv&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya).'</p>  
<p>(And further on the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> quoted above says), 'He who (worships Agni) with adoration, offering rich sacrifices.' 'Verily also by the performing of adoration (the gods may be worshipped); for the gods are not beyond the performing of adoration; adoration verily is sacrifice'&#151;thus runs a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_358"></A><A HREF="sbe29100.htm#fr_359">159:1</A> 1, 1. The spreading (vit&acirc;na or, as it is also called, vih&acirc;ra or vist&acirc;ra) of the sacred fires is the taking of two of the three sacrificial fires, the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire and the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;gni, out of the G&acirc;rhapatya fire (see, for instance, Weber's Indische Studien, IX, 216 seq.). The rites based on, or connected with the vit&acirc;na; are the rites forming the subject of the <I>S</I>rauta ritual, which are to be performed with the three fires.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_359"></A><A HREF="sbe29100.htm#fr_360">159:2</A> Comp. <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya I, 5, 1; I, 10, 7. The division here is somewhat different from that given by <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana; what <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana calls ahuta, is here prahuta ('sacrificed up'); the prahutas of <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana form here no special category; the pr&acirc;<I>s</I>itas of <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana are the brahma<I>n</I>i hut&acirc;s of &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana. Thus &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana has three categories, while <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana (and quite in the same way P&acirc;raskara I, 4, 1) gives four. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a mentions as an example of prahuta sacrifices the balihara<I>n</I>a prescribed below, I, 2, 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_360"></A><A HREF="sbe29100.htm#fr_361">159:3</A> Rig-veda VIII, 19, 5, The mortal who with a piece of wood, or with an oblation, or with knowledge worships Agni, who with adoration (worships him) offering rich sacrifices,' &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_361"></A><A HREF="sbe29100.htm#fr_362">160:4</A> The words of the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>, 'with an oblation,' are here repeated, the Vedic instrumental &acirc;hut&icirc; being replaced and explained by the regular form &acirc;huty&acirc;.</p>  
<p>The following <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> is taken from the eighth Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala, 24, 20. The god compared there with a rutting bull is Indra.</p>  
<p>The following verse is Rig-veda VI, 16, 47; we may doubt as to the correctness of the explanation given in our text, by which te&nbsp;te is referred to the persons studying the hymns of the <I>Ri</I>shi. All these quotations of course are meant to show that the knowledge of the Veda and the performing of namas (adoration) is equivalent to a real sacrifice.</P>
