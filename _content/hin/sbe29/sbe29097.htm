N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a has the following note: 'The evil which is attached to their body, such as dirt, they drive away, i.e. they remove it by means of their reciting (of the sacred texts), and then they perform the standing expiation which has been declared above, which begins with the syllable Om and with the Mah&acirc;vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis' (see chap. 3, 12).</P>

N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a says that dadhe is supplied to this Mantra from the preceding S&ucirc;tra, and so indeed the Mantra is given in the Aitareya recension. The translation of abhinihita<I>m</I> trir hitam is merely tentative; see N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's note, p. 165, of the German edition. Perhaps abhinihita<I>m</I> should be taken in its grammatical value, and the S&ucirc;tra should be translated, "That (I place) into myself (&acirc;tmani)"&#151;with these words (they look) at themselves, pronouncing (the word &acirc;tmani) with Abhinidh&acirc;na, three times repeated (?).' On abhinidh&acirc;na, comp. Professor Max M&uuml;ller's edition of the Rig-veda Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, pp. cxvii seqq.</P>
