------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 14.

1 <span id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_186). Now (follows) the Vai*s*vadeva
(sacrifice).

2 <span id="fr_188"></span>[2](#fn_187). The rite of the sacrifice has
been explained.

3\. Let him pour oblations of prepared Vai*s*vadeva food in the evening
and in the morning into the (sacred) domestic fire.

4\. 'To Agni svâhâ! To Soma svâhâ! To Indra and Agni svâhâ! To Vish*n*u
svâhâ! To Bharadvâ*g*a Dhanvantari svâhâ! To the Vi*s*ve devâs svâhâ! To
Pra*g*âpati svâhâ! To Aditi svâhâ! To Anumati svâhâ! To Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

svâhâ!'—having thus offered the oblations belonging to those deities,

5\. He then shall offer Balis (i.e. portions of food) in the centre of
the floor to the same deities; (then another Bali with the words,)
'Adoration to Brahman and to the Brâhma*n*as!' and (with the verse),
'Vâstoshpati, accept us' (Rig-veda VII, 54, 1) in the centre of the
floor to Vâstoshpati.

6 <span id="fr_189"></span>[6-7](#fn_188). He then distributes Balis,
from the left to the right, through the different quarters (of the
horizon, to the presiding deities) in due order (with the words),

7\. 'Adoration to Indra and to those belonging to Indra! Adoration to
Yama and to those belonging to Yama! Adoration to Varu*n*a and to those
belonging to Varu*n*a! Adoration to Soma and to those belonging to Soma!
Adoration to B*ri*haspati and to those belonging to B*ri*haspati!'

8 <span id="fr_190"></span>[8](#fn_189). Then (turned) towards the disk
of the sun, 'Adoration to Aditi and to the Âdityas! Adoration

5\. 'He shall offer a Bali to those deities, i.e. to those ten deities
to whom he has sacrificed, to Agni, &c. (see Sûtra 4), addressing them
with the word, "Adoration (to such and such a deity")—because in the
other cases the word "adoration" (nama*h*) has been prescribed for the
Bali.' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

to the Nakshatras, to seasons, to months, to half-months, to days and
nights, to years!'

9\. 'To Pûshan, the path-maker; to Dhâtar, to Vidhâtar, and to the
Maruts'—(thus) on the thresholds.

10\. To Vish*n*u on the grindstone.

11\. 'To the tree'—(thus) in the mortar.

12\. 'To the herbs'—(thus) where the herbs are kept.

13\. 'To Par*g*anya, to the waters'—(thus) near the water-pot.

14\. 'Adoration to *S*rî'—(thus) in the bed at the head, 'to Bhadrakâlî
at the foot.

15\. In the privy, 'Adoration to Sarvânnabhûti!'

16\. Then (he throws a Bali) into the air, in the evening with the
words, 'To the night-walkers,' in the morning with the words, 'To the
day-walkers,' and with the Verse,' Which gods' (Rig-veda I, 139, 11).

17\. To the unknown deities to the north, and to Dhanapati (i.e. the
Lord of treasures).

I8. With the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder he pours
out the remnant to the south with the verse, 'They whom the fire has
burnt' (Rig-veda X, 15, 14).

19\. When he has made his offerings to gods, fathers (i.e. Manes), and
men, let him give food to a *S*rotriya (i.e. to a learned Brâhma*n*a).

20\. Or let him give alms (of food) to a student.

21 <span id="fr_191"></span>[21](#fn_190). Let him immediately
afterwards offer food to a female under his protection, to a pregnant
woman, to boys, and to old people.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

22 <span id="fr_192"></span>[22-23](#fn_191). Let him throw (some food)
on the ground for the dogs, for the dog-butchers, and for the birds.

23 <span id="fr_193"></span>[23](#fn_192). Let him eat nothing without
having cut off (and offered as a Bali) a portion thereof.

24\. (Let him) not (eat) alone,

25\. Nor before (the others).

26\. With regard thereto it has been said also in the *Rik*,' In vain
the fool gains food' (Rig-veda X, 117, 6).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_186"></span>[84:1](sbe29044.htm#fr_187) 14, 1. The rules
regarding the Vai*s*vadeva sacrifice stand here, as I have already
pointed out in the German edition, p. 142, in a very strange position
amid the matter that concerns the student, and before the description of
the ceremony that concludes studentship (the Samâvartana; III, 1). On
the first word of the chapter, atha, Nârâya*n*a observes that thereby
the householder is marked as the subject of the following rules. It
seems rather forced to explain the position of this chapter, as
Nârâya*n*a does, by pointing out that in some cases, for instance when
the teacher is away on a journey, a student also can eventually be
called upon to perform the Vai*s*vadeva sacrifice (comp. below, chap.
17, 3).

<span id="fn_187"></span>[84:2](sbe29044.htm#fr_188) This Sûtra shows,
according to Nârâya*n*a, that the Vai*s*vadeva offering does not follow
the ordinary type of sacrifice (the Prati*s*rute homakalpa, as it is
termed above, I, 9, 19), but the form described in the
Agnikâryaprakara*n*a, above, chap. 10, 3 seq.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[85:6-7](sbe29044.htm#fr_189) 6, 7. The
distribution of Balis begins in the east, which is the part of the
horizon sacred to Indra; it then proceeds to the south, the west, the
north, which are sacred respectively to Yama, Varu*n*a, and Soma.
Finally the Bali belonging to B*ri*haspati and the Bârhaspatyas is
offered, according to Nârâya*n*a, to the north-east.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[85:8](sbe29044.htm#fr_190) The commentators
(see p. 142 of the German edition) differ as to whether âdityama*nd*ala
means the disk of the sun towards which this Bali should be offered, or
a place or an apartment of circular form (âdityama*nd*alarûpe
ma*nd*alâgâre, as in my opinion we ought to correct the reading in
Nârâya*n*a's note).

<span id="fn_190"></span>[86:21](sbe29044.htm#fr_191) Comp.
Böhtlingk-Roth s. v. suvâsinî, and Professor Bühler's note on Gautama V,
25.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[87:22-23](sbe29044.htm#fr_192) 22, 23.
Probably these Sûtras should be divided after iti.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[87:23](sbe29044.htm#fr_193) 'Pûrva*m* means,
he should not eat before his relations (bandhubhya*h* pûrva*m*
prathamata*h*).' Nârâya*n*a.
