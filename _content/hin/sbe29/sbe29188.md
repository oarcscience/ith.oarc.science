Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 15.

1\. On the full-moon day of Praush*th*apada the sacrifice to Indra.

2 <span id="fr_849"></span>[2](#fn_848). Having cooked milk-rice for
Indra and cakes, and having put cakes round (the fire), he sacrifices
the two Â*g*ya portions and Â*g*ya oblations to Indra, to Indrâ*n*î, to
A*g*a Ekapad, to Ahi Budhnya, and to the Prosh*th*apadâs.

3 <span id="fr_850"></span>[3](#fn_849). After he has eaten (his portion
of the sacrificial food), he offers a Bali to the Maruts. For the
*S*ruti says, 'The Maruts eat what is not-sacrificed.'

4 <span id="fr_851"></span>[4](#fn_850). (This Bali he offers) in
A*s*vattha leaves, because it is said, 'The Maruts stood in the
A*s*vattha tree.'

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

5 <span id="fr_852"></span>[5](#fn_851). (He offers it) with (the
texts), 'Brilliantly resplendent' (Var. Sa*m*h. XVII, 80-85), Mantra by
Mantra,

6 <span id="fr_853"></span>[6](#fn_852). And with the (Mantra called)
Vimukha.

7\. (This Mantra he repeats only) in his mind.

8 <span id="fr_854"></span>[8](#fn_853). For the *S*ruti says, 'These
are their names.'

9 <span id="fr_855"></span>[9](#fn_854). He murmurs, 'To Indra the
divine' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XVII, 86).

10\. Then (follows) the feeding of the Brâhma*n*as.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_848"></span>[331:2](sbe29188.htm#fr_849) 15, 2. After these
Â*g*ya oblations follows the chief oblation of the whole sacrifice, the
oblation of milk-rice to Indra. In one of Professor Stenzler's MSS.
there is a special Sûtra inserted after Sûtra 2, 'Of the cooked food he
makes an oblation with (the formula), "To Indra svâhâ."' I do not,
however, think it right to receive this Sûtra into the text, as the
other MSS. do not support it, and the commentators did not find it in
the text which they read.

<span id="fn_849"></span>[331:3](sbe29188.htm#fr_850) Professor
Stenzler's translation, 'Die Maruts essen kein Opfer,' seems to me not
quite exact. I should prefer to say, 'Die Maruts essen Nicht-Opfer.'
This passage, taken from *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a IV, 5, 2, 16, is quoted
as supporting the rule that a Bali offering should be made to the
Maruts; for in the technical language the term ahuta is applied to Bali
offerings (*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 10, 7,
huto<sup>ऽ</sup>gnihotrahomena, ahuto balikarma*n*â).

<span id="fn_850"></span>[331:4](sbe29188.htm#fr_851) When Indra called
them to his help against V*ri*tra. *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a IV, 3, 3, 6.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[332:5](sbe29188.htm#fr_852) This Sûtra is
identical with the last words of Kâty. XVIII, 4, 23.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[332:6](sbe29188.htm#fr_853) This is the first
part of Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XVII, 86.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[332:8](sbe29188.htm#fr_854) *S*atapatha
Brâhma*n*a IX, 3, I, 26. There it is said that *s*ukra*g*yoti*s*
('brilliantly resplendent') &c. (the words used in Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XVII,
80) are names of the Maruts.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[332:9](sbe29188.htm#fr_855) This Sûtra is
identical with Kâty. XVIII, 4, 25.
