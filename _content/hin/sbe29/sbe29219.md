### KHA*ND*A 2.

1 <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1-7](#fn_1027). On the full-moon day of
(the month) *S*râva*n*a, let him carry forward fire from his house, and
let him besmear (the place around it) to the extent of more than one
prakrama (i.e. step) towards the different directions (of the horizon).

2\. Having once taken a quantity of flour, and having put it into (the
spoon called) Darvi, he should pour out water on the besmeared place to
the east (of the fire), and should offer a Bali with (the formula), (O
king of serpents) dwelling towards the east' (MB. II, 1, 1),

3\. He should pour out the rest of the water.

4\. Having touched water, he should do the same

towards the other directions (of the horizon) according as they are
mentioned in the Mantras.

5\. Between (the besmeared surface) towards the south and that towards
the east and the fire (there should be) a passage.

6\. After he has thrown the remnants (of flour) out of the basket into
the fire, he should go from (the fire) which has been carried forward,
to that (fire) which has not (been carried forward), and should turn his
hands downwards (so as to touch the earth with them) and should murmur
(the Mantra), 'Adoration to the earth's' (l.l. 3).

7\. Thence rising he should place (to the north of the fire) a bunch of
Darbha-grass with (the Mantra), 'The king Soma' (l.l.4), and should fix
his thoughts on the serpents that are in that bunch.

8 <span id="fr_1029"></span>[8-13](#fn_1028). Taking a portion of fried
grain, he should go out of the village in a northern or eastern
direction, and should sacrifice it with his joined hands with the four
(verses), 'Hearken, Râkâ!' (MB. II, 6, 2 seqq.).

9\. Walking eastwards he should murmur, 'Be a giver of wealth' (l.l. 6).

10\. Thus three times to the different quarters and intermediate
quarters (of the horizon).

11\. Looking upwards (he should offer a Bali) to the hosts of divine
beings,

12\. (Looking) towards the side, to the hosts of other beings;

13\. Looking downwards, he should go back (to the fire) without looking

put it into a new vessel, and after sunset he should offer Balis.

Veda-study;

17\. On the full-moon day of *S*râva*n*a, according to some (teachers).

18\. Having sacrificed as at the Upanayana—

20\. (The verse), 'Soma, the king' (Sâma-veda I, 91), and the first
verses of the Parvans.

21\. Let them eat grain and curds with two appropriate (verses).

22\. On the following day in the morning let them repeat (the Veda) to

24\. Then the Rahasya texts are chanted,

25\. Except when lightning is seen or thunder heard.

26\. When they have studied four months and a half, they finish on the
