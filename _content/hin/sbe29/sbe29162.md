*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 8.

1 <span id="fr_710"></span>[1](#fn_709). Then he makes her step forward
in a northern direction seven steps (with the words),

'One for sap, two for juice, three for the prospering of wealth, four
for comfort, five for cattle, six for the seasons. Friend! be with seven
steps (united to me). So be thou devoted to me.'

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

2\. (The words), 'May Vish*n*u lead thee' are added to every part (of
the formula).

3 <span id="fr_711"></span>[3](#fn_710). From the moment of their going
away a man who holds a water-pot on his shoulder, stands silent to the
south of the fire;

4\. To the north, (according to the opinion) of some (teachers).

5\. From that (pot) he sprinkles her (with water) on her head (with the
formula),

'The blessed, the most blessed waters, the peaceful ones, the most
peaceful ones, may they give medicine to thee'—

6\. And with the three (verses), Ye waters are' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XI,
50-52).

7\. He then makes her look at the sun with (the verse), 'That eye'
(Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXXVI, 24.).

8 <span id="fr_712"></span>[8](#fn_711). He then touches her heart,
(reaching) over her right shoulder, with (the words), 'Into my will I
take thy heart; thy mind shall follow my mind; in my word thou shalt
rejoice with all thy heart; may Pra*g*âpati join thee to me.'

9 <span id="fr_713"></span>[9](#fn_712). He then recites over her (the
verse), 'Auspicious ornaments does this woman wear. Come up to her and
behold her. Having brought luck to her, go away back to your houses.'

10 <span id="fr_714"></span>[10](#fn_713). A strong man snatches her up
from the

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

ground, and sets her down in an eastern or northern direction in an
out-of-the-way house, on a red bull's hide, with (the words),

'Here may the cows sit down, here the horses, here the men. Here may
sacrifice with a thousand gifts, here may Pûshan sit down.'

11\. And what (the people in) the village tell them, that they should
do.

12 <span id="fr_715"></span>[12](#fn_714). For it is said, 'At weddings
and funerals he shall enter the village;'

13\. (And) because the *S*ruti says, 'Therefore on these two occasions
authority rests with the village.'

14\. To the teacher (who helps at the wedding ceremonies) he gives an
optional gift.

15 <span id="fr_716"></span>[15-17](#fn_715). A cow is the optional gift
to be given by a Brâhma*n*a,

16\. A village by a Râ*g*anya,

17\. A horse by a Vai*s*ya.

18 <span id="fr_717"></span>[18](#fn_716). A hundred (cows) with a
chariot (he gives to a father) who has only daughters.

19 <span id="fr_718"></span>[19](#fn_717). After sunset he shows her the
firm star (i.e. the polar-star) with (the words),

'Firm art thou; I see thee, the firm one. Firm be thou with me, O
thriving one!

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

'To me B*ri*haspati has given thee; obtaining offspring through me, thy
husband, live with me a hundred autumns.'

20\. If she does not see (the polar-star), let her say notwithstanding,
'I see,' &c.

21 <span id="fr_719"></span>[21](#fn_718). Through a period of three
nights they shall eat no saline food; they shall sleep on the ground;
through one year they shall refrain from conjugal intercourse, or
through a period of twelve nights, or of six nights, or at least of
three nights.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_709"></span>[283:1](sbe29162.htm#fr_710) 8, 1. The parallel
texts have sakhâ and saptapadî for sakhe and saptapadâ of Pâraskara.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[284:3](sbe29162.htm#fr_711) See above, I, 4,
15. The water mentioned here is designated as stheyâ âpa*h*; see
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 13, 5 seq.; G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha II, 26. 35.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[284:8](sbe29162.htm#fr_712) See the note on
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, 3, 3.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[284:9](sbe29162.htm#fr_713) Rig-veda X, 85,
33.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[284:10](sbe29162.htm#fr_714) The Atharva-veda
(XX, 127, 12) has the reading pra *g*âyadhvam instead of ni shîdantu (in
the first Pâda); the second hemistich there runs thus: iho
sahasradakshi*n*o<sup>ऽ</sup>pi Pûshâ ni shîdati.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[285:12](sbe29162.htm#fr_715) I have ventured,
differing from Professor Stenzler ('Bei der Hochzeit und auf der
Leichenstätte richte er sich nach dem Dorfe'), to translate pravi*s*atât
according to its original meaning. Could this possibly be a rule for
Vânaprasthas who live in the forest and enter the village only on
exceptional occasions?

<span id="fn_715"></span>[285:15-17](sbe29162.htm#fr_716) *S*âṅkhâyana
I, 14, 13 seqq.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[285:18](sbe29162.htm#fr_717) *S*âṅkhâyana I,
14, 16. Comp. the note there.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[285:19](sbe29162.htm#fr_718) In the text the
word 'firm' (dhruva) is neuter in the two first instances, and refers to
the 'firm star;' the third time it is feminine, referring to the bride.
Pâraskara has the vocative poshye for the nominative poshyâ of
*S*âṅkhâyana I, 17, 3; comp. above, § 1 sakhe for sakhâ.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[286:21](sbe29162.htm#fr_719) *S*âṅkhâyana I,
17, 5. 6; Â*s*valâyana I, 8, 10. 11.
