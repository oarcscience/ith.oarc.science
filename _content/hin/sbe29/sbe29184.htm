<P><A NAME="fn_827"></A><A HREF="sbe29184.htm#fr_828">323:1</A> 11, 1. 'Entire interruption' means, according to the commentators, that not only the study of the Veda itself, but also that of the Ved&acirc;&#7749;gas, or even all sorts of worldly instruction are forbidden.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_828"></A><A HREF="sbe29184.htm#fr_829">323:3</A> I have left the words sarvar&ucirc;pe <I>k</I>a untranslated. Evidently <A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A> sarvar&ucirc;pa is identical with the doubtful word <I>s</I>avar&ucirc;pa which twice occurs in the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya. See the discussion on that word in the note on <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana II, 12, 10.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_829"></A><A HREF="sbe29184.htm#fr_830">324:4</A> On antardiv&acirc;k&icirc;rtye, comp. Manu V, 85. Gautama XVI, 19.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_830"></A><A HREF="sbe29184.htm#fr_831">324:8</A> The T&acirc;n&ucirc;naptra is an invocation directed to Tan&ucirc;napt<I>ri</I> (i.e. the wind) by which the officiating priests and the Ya<I>g</I>am&acirc;na at a Soma sacrifice pledge their faith to do no harm to each other. See Indische Studien, X, 362.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_831"></A><A HREF="sbe29184.htm#fr_832">325:12</A> The reading of the Mantra is doubtful. I think it should stand as Professor Stenzler has printed it, except that I should propose to correct yuv&acirc; into yuv&acirc;n&acirc; (comp. &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-<I>S</I>rauta VI, 12, 12). It is probable that the gods addressed are the two A<I>s</I>vins, who are called kav&icirc; and yuv&acirc;n&acirc; in several passages of the Vedas.</P>
