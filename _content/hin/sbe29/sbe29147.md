### KA*ND*IKÂ 2.

1 <span id="fr_580"></span>[1](#fn_579). (The relations of the dead
person) now carry (his sacred) fires and (his) sacrificial vessels in
that direction.

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

2\. After them aged persons forming an odd number, men and women not
going together, (carry) the dead body.

3\. Some (say) that (the dead body should be carried) in a cart with a
seat, drawn by cows.

4 <span id="fr_581"></span>[4](#fn_580). (Some prescribe) a she-animal
for covering (the dead body with its limbs):

5\. A cow,

6\. Or a she-goat of one colour.

7\. Some (take) a black one.

8\. They tie (a rope) to its left fore-foot and lead it behind (the dead
body).

9\. Then follow the relations (of the dead person), wearing their
sacrificial cords below (round their body), with the hair-locks untied,
the older fines first, the younger ones last.

10 <span id="fr_582"></span>[10](#fn_581). When they have thus arrived
at the place, the performer (of the rites) walks three times round the
spot with his left side turned towards it, and with a *S*amî branch
sprinkles water on it, with (the verse), 'Go away, withdraw, and depart
from here' (Rig-veda X, 14, 9).

11\. To the south-east, on an elevated corner (of that place), he places
the Âhavanîya fire,

12 <span id="fr_583"></span>[12-13](#fn_582). To the north-west the
Gârhapatya fire,

13\. To the south-west the Dakshi*n*a fire.

14 <span id="fr_584"></span>[14](#fn_583). After that a person that
knows (how to do it), piles up between the fires a pile of fuel.

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

15\. After sacrificial grass and a black antelope's skin with the hair
outside has been spread out there, they place the dead body thereon,
which they have carried so as to pass by the Gârhapatya fire on its
north-side, turning its head towards the Âhavanîya.

16 <span id="fr_585"></span>[16](#fn_584). To the north (of the body
they place) the wife (of the deceased),

17\. And a bow for a Kshatriya.

18 <span id="fr_586"></span>[18](#fn_585). Her brother-in-law, being a
representative of her husband, or a pupil (of her husband), or an aged
servant, should cause her to rise (from that place) with (the verse),
'Arise, O wife, to the world of life' (Rig-veda X, 18, 8).

19 <span id="fr_587"></span>[19](#fn_586). The performer (of the rites)
should murmur (that verse), if a *S*ûdra (makes her rise from the pile).

20\. With (the verse), 'Taking the bow out of the hand of the deceased'
(Rig-veda X, 18, 9), (he takes away) the bow.

21\. It has been stated (what is to be done) in case a *S*ûdra (should
perform this act).

22 <span id="fr_588"></span>[22](#fn_587). Having bent the bow, he
should, before the piling up (of the things mentioned below, which are
put on the dead body) is done, break it to pieces, and throw it (on the
pile).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_578"></span>[237:12](sbe29146.htm#fr_574) Nârâya*n*a: By
the word *s*ma*s*âna (cemetery) two different *s*ma*s*ânas are
designated here, because below (Sûtra 15) a distinction is added (to the
word *s*ma*s*âna), in the words, 'This is a characteristic required for
the *s*ma*s*âna where the body is to be burned.' Thus the place where
the body is burned, and the place where the gathered bones are
deposited, both are called *s*ma*s*âna.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[237:1](sbe29147.htm#fr_580) 2, 1. In the
direction stated above, chap. 1, 6.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[238:4](sbe29147.htm#fr_581) See chap. 3,
20-25.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[238:10](sbe29147.htm#fr_582) Kartodakena (i.e.
kartâ udakena) is evidently the right reading, not gartodakena.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[238:12-13](sbe29147.htm#fr_583) 12, 13. The
words, 'on an elevated corner' (Sûtra 11) have to be supplied.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[238:14](sbe29147.htm#fr_584) As to the pronoun
enam, which refers, with an irregular <span id="page_239">p. 239</span>
construction, to the dead person, comp *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a XII, 5, 2,
7.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[239:16](sbe29147.htm#fr_585) The wife is made
to lie down on the pile.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[239:18](sbe29147.htm#fr_586) Possibly the
words devara*h* and patisthânîya*h* refer to two different persons, so
that we should have to translate, 'Her brother-in-law, (or some other)
representative of her husband, &c.'

<span id="fn_586"></span>[239:19](sbe29147.htm#fr_587) This refers to
the case of the aged servant. The word for which we have put *S*ûdra
here and in Sûtra 21, is v*ri*shala.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[239:22](sbe29147.htm#fr_588) See Sûtra 19.
