### KHA*ND*A 7.

1 <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_38). When assent has been declared (by
the girl's father, the bridegroom) sacrifices.

2\. He besmears a quadrangular space with cow-dung.

3 <span id="fr_40"></span>[3](#fn_39). (Let him consider in the
ceremonies to be performed,) of the two eastern intermediate directions,
the southern one as that to which (the rites) should be directed, if the
rites belong to the Manes,

of the two eastern intermediate directions, sacred to Î*s*âna, should be
considered as that to which the ceremonies sacred to the gods, such as
oblations, &c., are to be directed.'—Comp. Â*s*valâyana-*S*raut. I, 12,
4.}

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

4\. The northern one, if the rites belong to the gods,

5\. Or rather the east (itself) according to some (teachers).

6 <span id="fr_41"></span>[6-7](#fn_40). He draws in the middle (of the
sacrificial ground) a line from south to north,

7\. Upwards from this, turned upwards, to the south one line, in the
middle one, to the north one.

8\. These he sprinkles (with water),

9 <span id="fr_42"></span>[9](#fn_41). Carries forward the fire with the
verse, 'I carry forward Agni with genial mind; may he be the assembler
of goods. Do no harm to us, to the old nor to the young; be a saviour to
us, to men and animals,'

10\. Or (he carries it forward) silently,

11\. Then he wipes with his wet hand three times around the fire,
turning his right side to it. This they call SAMÛHANA (sweeping
together).

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

12\. Once, turning his left side to it, in the rites belonging to the
Manes.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_38"></span>[22:1](sbe29009.htm#fr_39) 7, 1 seq. Here
follows a description of the sacrifice which is to be performed when the
girl's father has declared his assent (prati*s*rute) to give her away in
marriage: this is the general model for all G*ri*hya sacrifices.—'Varo
*g*uhoti,' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[22:3](sbe29009.htm#fr_40) 'He here states an
exception to the rule, "The ceremonies sacred to the Manes are directed
towards the south" (*S*rauta-sûtra I, 1, 14) . . . . He should consider
the south-eastern direction, sacred to Agni, as that to which the
ceremonies are to be directed (prâ*k*îm pûrvâ*m* kalpayet) which are
sacred to the Manes, such as <span id="page_23">p. 23</span>prescribed
in the Sûtra, "Let him make oblations every month to the Fathers" (IV,
1, 1) . . . . He states an exception to the rule, "The ceremonies sacred
to the gods are directed towards the east" (*S*raut. I, 1, 13) . . . .

from Râma*k*andra's and Nârâya*n*a's commentaries, p. 123 of the German
edition. An illustration of the form of the stha*nd*ila with the lines
drawn thereon is given by Dr. Bloomfield in his note on the
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha-pari*s*ish*t*a I, 52 seq.; instead of the three
lines, however, which are here prescribed in Sûtra 7, there are four
indicated in accordance with the doctrine of that Pari*s*ish*t*a and of
Gobhila himself, which are stated to be sacred to P*ri*thivî,
Pra*g*âpati, Indra, and Soma, while the line turned from south to north
is sacred to Agni.

Agnipra*n*ayana (carrying forward of the fire) see the
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha-pari*s*ish*t*a I, 64-69.
