Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 5.

1 <span id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_138). After one year (the teacher)
recites the Sâvitrî (to the student),

2\. (Or) after three nights,

3\. Or immediately.

4 <span id="fr_140"></span>[4-6](#fn_139). Let him recite a Gâyatrî to a
Brâhma*n*a,

5\. A Trish*t*ubh to a Kshatriya,

6\. A *G*agatî to a Vai*s*ya.

7\. But let it be anyhow a verse sacred to Savitar.

8\. They seat themselves to the north of the fire,

9 <span id="fr_141"></span>[9](#fn_140). The teacher with his face
turned eastward, the other westward.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

10 <span id="fr_142"></span>[10-11](#fn_141). After (the student) has
said, 'Recite, sir!'—

11\. The teacher, having pronounced the word OM, then causes the other
one to say, 'Recite the Sâvitrî, sir!'

12\. He then recites the Sâvitrî to him, the verse 'That glorious
(splendour) of Savitar' (Rig-Veda III, 62, 10); (firstly) pâda by pâda,
(then) hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) without a stop.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_138"></span>[66:1](sbe29035.htm#fr_139) 5, 1. The study of
the Veda is opened by the Sâvitrî. Comp. *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a, loc.
cit., §§ 6 seq.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[66:4-6](sbe29035.htm#fr_140) The Gâyatrî which
the teacher shall recite to a Brâhma*n*a is the same verse of which it
is said below, chap. q, II, that it belongs to Vi*s*vâmitra (Rig-veda
III, 62, to); the Trish*t*ubh which is taught to the Kshatriya is a
verse ascribed to Hira*n*yastûpa, Rig-veda I, 35, 2; the *G*agatî which
is to be repeated to a Vai*s*ya is Rig-veda IV, 40, 5, belonging to
Vâmadeva, or Rig-veda I, 35, 9, belonging to Hira*n*yastûpa. See the
note on chap. 7, 10.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[66:9](sbe29035.htm#fr_141) The same position
is prescribed, in the same words, for the study of the main part of the
Veda, below, chap. 7, 3; during <span id="page_67">p. 67</span> the
study of the Âra*n*yaka the position is slightly different (VI, 3, 2).
According to Nârâya*n*a this Sûtra would contain a nishedha of the
Sûtras 828 and 829 of the Rig-veda-Prâti*s*âkhya (p. ccxcii of Professor
Max Müller's edition).

<span id="fn_141"></span>[67:10-11](sbe29035.htm#fr_142) 10, 11. The
Indian tradition divides these Sûtras after â*k*ârya*h*, so that the
words adhîhi bho would have to be pronounced by the teacher. Thus also
Nârâya*n*a explains, â*k*ârya adhîhi bho 3 iti mâ*n*avakam uktvâ, &c. In
my opinion it is the student or the students who say adhîhi bho. Thus
the Prâti*s*âkhya (Sûtra 831, ed. Max Müller) says, 'They invite him
with the words adhîhi bho 3, all the students the teacher, having
embraced his feet.' Comp. also below, IV, 8, 12, the greater part of
which Sûtra is word for word identical with these rules; VI, 3, 6;
Gautama I, 46; Gobhila II, 10, 38.
