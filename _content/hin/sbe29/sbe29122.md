Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 23.

1 <span id="fr_471"></span>[1](#fn_470). He chooses priests (for
officiating at a sacrifice) with neither deficient nor superfluous
limbs, 'who on

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

the mother's and on the father's side (&c.),' as it has been said above.

2\. Let him choose young men as officiating priests: thus (declare) some
(teachers).

3\. He chooses first the Brahman, then the Hot*ri*, then the Adhvaryu,
then the Udgât*ri*.

4 <span id="fr_472"></span>[4](#fn_471). Or all who officiate at the
Ahîna sacrifices and at those lasting one day.

5 <span id="fr_473"></span>[5](#fn_472). The Kaushîtakinas prescribe the
Sadasya as the seventeenth, saying, 'He is the looker-on at the
performances.'

6 <span id="fr_474"></span>[6](#fn_473). This has been said in the two
*Rik*as, 'He whom the officiating priests, performing (the sacrifice) in
many ways' (Rig-veda VIII, 58, I. 2).

7 <span id="fr_475"></span>[7](#fn_474). He chooses the Hot*ri* first.

8\. With (the formula), 'Agni is my Hot*ri*; he is my Hot*ri*; I choose
thee N.N. as my Hot*ri*' (he chooses) the Hot*ri*.

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

9\. With (the formula), '*K*andramas (the moon) is my Brahman; he is my
Brahman; I choose thee N.N. as my Brahman' (he chooses) the Brahman.

10\. With (the formula), 'Âditya (the sun) is my Adhvaryu; (he is my
Adhvaryu, &c.)'—the Adhvaryu.

11\. With (the formula), 'Par*g*anya is my Udgât*ri*; (he is my
Udgât*ri*, &c.)'—the Udgât*ri*.

12 <span id="fr_476"></span>[12](#fn_475). With (the formula), 'The
waters are my reciters of what belongs to the Hotrakas'—the Hotrakas.

13 <span id="fr_477"></span>[13-14](#fn_476). With (the formula), 'The
rays are my *K*amasâdhvaryus'—the *K*amasâdhvaryus.

14\. With (the formula), 'The ether is my Sadasya'—the Sadasya.

15\. He whom he has chosen should murmur, 'A great thing thou hast told
me; splendour thou hast told me; fortune thou hast told me; glory thou
hast told me; praise thou hast told me; success thou hast told me;
enjoyment thou hast told me; satiating thou hast told me; everything
thou hast told me.'

16\. Having murmured (this formula), the Hot*ri* declares his assent (in
the words), 'Agni is thy Hot*ri*; he is thy Hot*ri*; thy human Hot*ri*
am I.'

17\. '*K*andramas (the moon) is thy Brahman; he is thy Brahman
(&c.)'—thus the Brahman.

18\. In the same way the others according to the prescriptions (given
above).

19 <span id="fr_478"></span>[19](#fn_477). And if (the priest who
accepts the invitation)

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

is going to perform the sacrifice (for the inviting person, he should
add), 'May that bless me; may that enter upon me; may I thereby enjoy
(bliss).'

20 <span id="fr_479"></span>[20](#fn_478). The functions of an
officiating priest are not to be exercised, if abandoned (by another
priest), or at an Ahîna sacrifice with small sacrificial fee, or for a
person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with consumption, or
decried among the people in his village, or of despised extraction: for
such persons (the functions of a Ritvi*g* should not be exercised).

21 <span id="fr_480"></span>[21](#fn_479). He (who is chosen as a
*Ri*tvi*g*) should ask the Somapravâka, 'What sacrifice is it? Who are

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

the priests officiating? What is the fee for the sacrifice?'

22\. If (all the conditions) are favourable, he should accept.

23\. Let (the officiating priests) eat no flesh nor have intercourse
with a wife until the completion of the sacrifice.

24\. 'By this prayer, O Agni, increase' (Rig-veda I, 31, 18)—with (this
verse) let him offer (at the end of the sacrifice) an oblation of Â*g*ya
in (his own) Dakshi*n*âgni, and go away where he likes;

25\. In the same way one who has not set up the (*S*rauta) fires, in his
(sacred) domestic fire with this *Rik*, 'Forgive us, O Agni, this sin'
(Rig-veda I, 31, 16).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_470"></span>[193:1](sbe29122.htm#fr_471) 23, 1. Comp.
*S*rauta-sûtra IX, 3, 20; G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 5, 1.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[194:4](sbe29122.htm#fr_472) The Ahîna
sacrifices are those which last more than one day, but not more than
twelve days. (Indische Studien, IX, 373; X, 355.) The priests
officiating at such sacrifices are the sixteen stated in the
*S*rauta-sûtra IV, 1, 6. 7. Those besides the sixteen, though they are
chosen (saty api vara*n*e) for taking part in the sacred performances,
have not the rank of *ri*tvi*g*as (officiating priests); such are the
Sadasya, the Samit*ri*, and the *K*amasâdhvaryava*h* (schol. *S*rautas.
loc. cit.). See Max Müller's History of A. S. L., pp. 450, 469 seq. As
to the Sadasya, however, there was some difference of opinion (see the
next Sûtra).

<span id="fn_472"></span>[194:5](sbe29122.htm#fr_473) On the office of
the Sadasya, see Indische Studien, X, 136, 144.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[194:6](sbe29122.htm#fr_474) The two *Rik*as
quoted here belong to the tenth among the Vâlakhilya hymns, a hymn
omitted in many of the Rig-veda MSS. They give no special confirmation
to the rules stated in our text, but contain only a general allusion to
the unity of the sacrifice, which the various priests perform in many
various ways.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[194:7](sbe29122.htm#fr_475) 'If the four
(chief) priests have to be chosen, the choosing of the Brâhma*n*a stands
first in order (see above, Sûtra 3); if all (the sixteen), then the
choosing of the Hot*ri* stands first in order.' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[195:12](sbe29122.htm#fr_476) The twelve
priests of the sixteen (see § 4 note) who do not stand at the head of
one of the four categories. Those at the head are enumerated in the
Sutras

<span id="fn_476"></span>[195:13-14](sbe29122.htm#fr_477) 13, 14. See
above, § 4 note.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[195:19](sbe29122.htm#fr_478) Priests who only
perform the Agnyâdheya for a person, are, according to Nârâya*n*a's note
on this Sûtra, not considered as <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>
performing a sacrifice for him; consequently the formula given here is
only to be used by priests who are elected for a Soma sacrifice.
Stenzler translates, 'So spricht er, wenn er das Opfer durch sie
vollziehen lassen will.' But this would be yakshyamâ*n*a*h*, not
yâ*g*ayishyan.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[196:20](sbe29122.htm#fr_479) The tradition
takes nî*k*adakshi*n*asya as in apposition to ahînasya, and I have
translated accordingly. But I cannot help thinking that the two words
should be separated, so that we should have to translate, 'or at an
Ahîna, or for a person that gives small sacrificial fee.' Thus the
Brâhma*n*a quoted by Âpastamba (see the commentary on the Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a
Brâhma*n*a, vol. i, p. 6, ed. Bibl. Indica) gives the following
questions which the Ritvi*g* to be chosen should ask, 'Is it no Ahîna
sacrifice? Is the Ritvi*g* office not abandoned by others? Is the
sacrificial fee plentiful?' It is a very singular fact, that on the one
hand the assistance of a number of *Ri*tvi*g*as was unanimously declared
necessary for the performance of an Ahîna sacrifice, while on the other
hand it was considered objectionable, at least among some of the Vedic
schools, to officiate at such a sacrifice. See Weber's Indische Studien,
X, 150, 151.

On anude*s*yabhi*s*asta Nârâya*n*a says, sade*s*inâbhi*s*astasyaivam
eke. anye tu *s*râddhe pratishiddhasyety âhu*h*. It seems to me that
anude*s*ya (or rather ânude*s*ya?) in *S*âṅkhâyana-*S*raut. V, 1, 10
(Indische Studien, X, 147) means the same, though the commentary on that
Sûtra ascribes a different meaning to that word.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[196:21](sbe29122.htm#fr_480) The Somapravâka
is the messenger who invites the priests on behalf of the sacrificer to
officiate at his intended Soma sacrifice. Comp. Indische Studien, IX,
308.
