### KA*ND*IKÂ 2.

1 <span id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_665). The setting up of the Âvasathya
(or sacred domestic) fire (is performed) at the time of his wedding.

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

2 <span id="fr_667"></span>[2](#fn_666). At the time of the division of
the inheritance, according to some (teachers).

3 <span id="fr_668"></span>[3](#fn_667) After he has fetched fire from
the house of a Vai*s*ya who is rich in cattle,—

4 <span id="fr_669"></span>[4](#fn_668). All ceremonies are performed as
at the cooking of the *k*âtushprâ*s*ya food.

5 <span id="fr_670"></span>[5](#fn_669). Some (say that) the handing
over of the kindling sticks (should take place),

6 <span id="fr_671"></span>[6](#fn_670). Because the *S*ruti says,
'There are five great sacrifices.'

7 <span id="fr_672"></span>[7](#fn_671). Having cooked a mess of
sacrificial food for the deities of the Agnyâdheya, and having
sacrificed the two Â*g*ya portions, he sacrifices (the following) Â*g*ya
oblations:

8 <span id="fr_673"></span>[8](#fn_672). 'Thou, Agni' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*hitâ
XXI, 3); 'Thus

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

thou, Agni' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*hitâ XXI, 4); 'This, O Varu*n*a' (XXI, 1); 'For
this I entreat thee' (XXI, 2); 'Thy hundred' (Kâty.-*S*raut. XXV, 1,
11); 'And quick, Agni' (Kâty. l.l.); 'The highest one' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h.
XII, 12); 'Be both to us' (ibid. V, 3)—with (these verses he sacrifices)
eight (oblations) before (the oblations of cooked food).

9\. Thus he sacrifices also afterwards, after he has made oblations of
the mess of cooked food to the deities of the Agnyâdheya.

10\. And to (Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t,

11 <span id="fr_674"></span>[11](#fn_673). With (the formulas), 'Into
the quick one (has been put) Agni's (sacrificial portion) over which the
word vasha*t* has been spoken;' 'What I have done too much;' 'O gods who
know the way.'

12 <span id="fr_675"></span>[12](#fn_674). Having sacrificed the Barhis,
he partakes (of the sacrificial food).

13\. Then food is given to the Brâhma*n*as.

on this Sûtra, in the Introduction, pp. [265](sbe29154.htm#page_265)
seq.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[271:6](sbe29156.htm#fr_671) *S*atapatha
Brâhma*n*a XI, 5, 6, 1: 'There are five great sacrifices which are great
Sattras, viz. the sacrifice to living beings, the sacrifice to men, the
sacrifice to the Manes, the sacrifice to the gods, the Brahmaya*gñ*a.'
As the G*ri*hya ceremonies are included here under the category of
mahâya*gñ*âs or great sacrifices, they require, according to the
teachers whose opinion is stated in Sûtra 5, a form of the Agnyâdhâna
(setting up of the sacred fire) analogous to the Agnyâdhâna of the
*S*rauta ritual, and containing, like that Âdhâna, the act of the
Ara*n*ipradâna or handing over of the kindling woods (Sûtra 5).

<span id="fn_671"></span>[271:7](sbe29156.htm#fr_672) The deities of the
Agnyâdheya, or of the *S*rauta ceremony corresponding to the G*ri*hya
rite here treated of, are Agni pavamâna, Agni pâvaka, Agni *s*u*k*i,
Aditi. On the Â*g*yabhâgas, see *S*âṅkhâyana I, 9, 7, &c.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[271:8](sbe29156.htm#fr_673) The verses Vâ*g*.
Sa*m*h. XXI, 3, 4, the two verses quoted <span id="page_272">p.
272</span> Kâty. XXV, 1, 11, and fifthly the verse Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XII,
12, are prescribed for the Sarvaprâya*sk*itta (or general expiatory
ceremony), see Kâtyâyana l.l.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[272:11](sbe29156.htm#fr_674) Professor
Stenzler, following *G*ayarâma, takes the whole as one Mantra, which he
translates: 'Ungehemmet sei Agni's Spende, die durch die That ich
überreich machte, bahnschaffende Götter!' But the words yat
karma*n*âtyarîri*k*am are the opening words of a Mantra quoted
*S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a XIV, 9, 4, 24, (comp. also Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya
I, 10, 23; the connection in which atyarîri*k*am there stands, shows
that the word designates a mistake made in the sacrificial work by doing
too much.) The words devâ gâtuvida*h* are the Pratîka of Vâ*g*.
Sa*m*hitâ VIII, 21. Thus I have no doubt that also ayâsy Agner
vasha*t*k*ri*tam (or possibly ayâsy Agner (?) and vasha*t*k*ri*tam (?))
is a Pratîka. Of course, the translation of these words must remain
uncertain until the Mantra to which they belong has been discovered.
