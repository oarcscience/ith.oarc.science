<p>1&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (He says), 'Memory and reproach and knowledge, faith, and wisdom as the fifth, what is sacrificed, and what is given, and what is studied, and what is done, truth, learning, vow&#151;</p>  
<p>'The vow which belongs to Agni together with Indra, with Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, with the <I>Ri</I>shis, with the royal ones among the <I>Ri</I>shis, with the Fathers, with the royal ones among the Fathers, with the human beings, with the royal ones among the human beings, with shine, over-shine, after-shine, counter-shine, with gods and men, with Gandharvas and Apsaras, with wild animals and domestic animals,&#151;the vow, belonging to my own self, dwelling in my own self, that is my universal vow. Hereby, O Agni, I become addicted to the universal vow. Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'</p>

<p>5. He (i.e. the Sn&acirc;taka) has to keep the following observances:</p>  
<p>6. He shall not bathe in the night-time; he shall not bathe naked; he shall not lie down naked; he shall not look at a naked woman, except during sexual intercourse; he shall not run during rain; he shall not climb up a tree; he shall not descend into a well; he shall not swim with his arms across a river; he shall not expose himself to danger. 'A great being indeed is a Sn&acirc;taka'&#151;thus it is understood (in the <I>S</I>ruti).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_554"></A><A HREF="sbe29142.htm#fr_555">229:1</A> 9, 1. '"My memory and my non-memory, that is my double vow"&#151;in this way the twelve (parts of which the first section of the Mantra consists) should be recited.' N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a. I think the commentator is wrong here, and that section should rather be recited as it is given in the text without any alteration; it forms a regular <I>S</I>loka. Agne<I>h</I> instead of Agne is a conjecture of Prof. Stenzler, which I have adopted.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_555"></A><A HREF="sbe29142.htm#fr_556">229:2</A> According to N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a the hymn should be recited including the Khila, so that ten pieces of wood are offered. Now the hymn consists of nine verses; there can be, consequently, only one Khailika verse, which is, I suppose, the first verse of the Khila quoted above, p. 228.</P>
