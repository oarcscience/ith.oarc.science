*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 2.

1\. He should initiate a Brâhma*n*a, when he is eight years old, or in
the eighth year after the conception,

2\. Â*s*valâyana, when he is eleven years old,

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

3\. A Vai*s*ya, when he is twelve years old.

4\. Or according as it is considered auspicious by all (the different
families).

5\. He should feed the Brâhma*n*as. And they lead him (i.e. the boy who
is to be initiated) on, with his head shaven all round, and decked with
ornaments.

6 <span id="fr_765"></span>[6](#fn_764). (The teacher) makes him place
himself to the west of the fire and say, 'I have come hither for the
sake of studentship (brahma*k*arya).' And, 'I will be a student
(brahma*k*ârin).'

7\. He then makes him put on a garment with (the verse), 'In the way in
which B*ri*haspati put the garment of immortality on Indra, thus I put
(this garment) on thee, for the sake of long life, of old age, of
strength, of splendour.'

8 <span id="fr_766"></span>[8](#fn_765). He ties round him the girdle
with (the verse which the youth recites), 'Here has come to me, keeping
away evil words, purifying my kind as a [purifier](errata.htm#1),
clothing herself, by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation, with
strength, this sisterly goddess, this blessed girdle.'

9 <span id="fr_767"></span>[9](#fn_766). Or, 'A youth, well attired,
dressed, came hither. He, being born, becomes glorious. Wise sages extol
him, devout ones, turning their minds to the gods.'

10\. Or silently.

11\. He gives him the staff.

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

12\. (The student) accepts it with (the verse), 'My staff which fell
down to the ground in the open air, that I take up again for the sake of
long life, of holiness, of holy lustre.'

13 <span id="fr_768"></span>[13](#fn_767). According to some (teachers
he accepts the staff) in the way prescribed for the inauguration,
because it is said, 'He enters upon a long Sattra (or sacrificial
period).'

14\. (The teacher) then with his joined hands fills (the student's)
joined hands with water with the three (verses), 'Ye waters are' (Vâ*g*.
Sa*m*h. XI, 50 seqq.).

15 <span id="fr_769"></span>[15](#fn_768). He then makes him look at the
sun with (the verse), 'That eye' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXXVI, 24).

16 <span id="fr_770"></span>[16](#fn_769). He then touches his heart,
(reaching) over his right shoulder, with (the words), 'Into my will I
take thy heart, &c.'

17 <span id="fr_771"></span>[17](#fn_770). He then seizes (the
student's) right hand and says, 'What is thy name?

18\. He replies, 'I am N.N., sir!'

19\. He then says to him, 'Whose pupil (brahma*k*ârin) art thou?'

20 <span id="fr_772"></span>[20](#fn_771). After (the student) has said,
'Yours!'—(the

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

teacher replies,) 'Indra's pupil art thou; Agni is thy teacher; I am thy
teacher, N.N.!'

21\. He then gives him in charge to living beings with (the formulas),
'To Pra*g*âpati I give thee in charge. To the god Savit*ri* I give thee
in charge. To the waters, the herbs I give thee in charge. To Heaven and
Earth I give thee in charge. To the Vi*s*ve devâs I give thee in charge.
To all beings I give thee in charge for the sake of freedom from harm.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_764"></span>[304:6](sbe29175.htm#fr_765) 6 seqq. Comp.
*S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a XI, 5, 4.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[304:8](sbe29175.htm#fr_766) The commentators
differ as to whether the Â*k*ârya or the youth should recite the verse.
The comparison of *S*âṅkhâyana II, 2, 1 would rather tend to show that
it is the teacher, but Gobhila II, 10 says expressly: athaina*m* tri*h*
pradakshi*n*a*m* mu*ñg*amekhalâ*m* pariharan vâ*k*ayatîya*m* duruktât
paribâdhamânety *ri*tasya goptrîti vâ.

<span id="fn_766"></span>[304:9](sbe29175.htm#fr_767) Rig-veda III, 8,
4. The verse is originally addressed to Agni.

<span id="fn_767"></span>[305:13](sbe29175.htm#fr_768) *S*atapatha
Brâhma*n*a XI, 3, 3, 2: 'He enters upon a long Sattra, who enters upon
Brahma*k*arya.' The student, when being initiated, ought to behave,
consequently, in the same way as those who receive the inauguration
(dîkshâ) for a long Sattra. This is the meaning of this Sûtra. The rules
regarding the staff handed over by the Adhvaryu to the Ya*g*amâna at the
dîkshâ ceremony are given by Kâtyâyana, *S*rauta-sûtra VII, 4, 1-4.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[305:15](sbe29175.htm#fr_769) See above, I, 8,

*S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a XI, 5, 4, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_771"></span>[305:20](sbe29175.htm#fr_772) The words 'I am
thy teacher' are omitted in one of Professor Stenzler's MSS. and in his
translation. But they are given in the parallel passage of the
*S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a. The <span id="page_306">p. 306</span> parallel
passage in *S*âṅkhâyana (G*ri*hya II, 3, 1) also runs thus: Agnir
â*k*âryas tava, asâv, aha*m* *k*obhau.
