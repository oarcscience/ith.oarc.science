### KA*ND*IKÂ 13.

1 <span id="fr_835"></span>[1](#fn_834). On an auspicious day the
harnessing to the plough. Or under (the Nakshatra) *G*yesh*th*â,
(because that rite is) sacred to Indra.

2 <span id="fr_836"></span>[2](#fn_835). To Indra, Par*g*anya, the two
A*s*vins, the Maruts, Udalâkâ*s*yapa, Svâtikârî, Sîtâ, and Anumati, he
offers curds, rice grains, perfumes, and fried grains, and then makes
the bullocks eat honey and ghee.

3\. He should put them to the plough with (the verse), 'They harness to
the ploughs' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XII, 67).

4\. With (the verse), 'For luck may us the ploughshares' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h.
XII, 69) let him plough or touch the plough-share.

5 <span id="fr_837"></span>[5](#fn_836). Or (he may) not (do so),
because (that verse) has been prescribed for (the erection of) the Agni
(-altar), and the act of sowing stands in connection (with it).

6\. After the front-bullock has been sprinkled (with water), they then
should plough unploughed ground.

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

7 <span id="fr_838"></span>[7](#fn_837). He should make oblations of
cooked sacrificial food to the same deities as above, when sowing both
rice and barley, and at the sacrifice to Sîtâ.

8\. Then (follows) feeding of the Brâhma*n*as.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_834"></span>[326:1](sbe29186.htm#fr_835) 13, 1. Indra is
the presiding deity over the constellation *G*yesh*th*â; see
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 26, 16, &c.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[326:2](sbe29186.htm#fr_836) The names of the
genius Udalâkâ*s*yapa and of the female genius Svâtikârî occur, as far
as I know, only hero. Böhtlingk-Roth propose to read Sphâti*m*kârî ('the
goddess who gives abundance').

<span id="fn_836"></span>[326:5](sbe29186.htm#fr_837) At the
Agni-*k*ayana ceremony furrows are drawn with the plough on the
Agni-kshetra with the verses Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XII, 69-7 2. Afterwards
grains of different kinds are sown. See Kâtyâyana XVII, 2, 12; 3, 8;
Indische Studien, XIII, 244 seq. Thus in the *S*rauta ritual the verse
Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XII, 69 stands in a connection which does not conform to
the occasion for which it would be used here.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[327:7](sbe29186.htm#fr_838) 'As above' refers
to Sûtra 2. On the Sîtâ-ya*gñ*a, see below, chap. 17.
