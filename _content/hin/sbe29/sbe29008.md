### KHA*ND*A 6.

1 <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_35). If he will acquire a wife, let
him recite over the wooers (whom he sends to the girl's father) when
they go away, the verse, 'Thornless' (Rig-veda X, 85, 23).

2\. When they arrive, they take flowers, fruits, barley, and a pot of
water.

3 <span id="fr_37"></span>[3](#fn_36). They say thrice, 'Here I am,
sir!'

4\. When these words have been uttered, they ask the girl in marriage,
reciting the clan names, the dwellers turning their faces to the east,
the visitors to the west.

5\. When the matter pleases both sides, let them touch a full vessel
into which have been put flowers,

fried grain, fruits, barley, and gold, and let them recite (the
formula), 'Undisturbed art thou, the undisturbable vigour of the gods,
not cursed, protecting against a curse, unexposed to a curse. Might I
straightway attain to truth. Put me into prosperity.'

6 <span id="fr_38"></span>[6](#fn_37). With the verse, 'Offspring may
produce us' (Rig-veda X, 85, 43), the Â*k*ârya of the girl's (family),
standing up, places (the vessel) on her head (saying), 'Offspring I put
into thee, cattle I put into thee, splendour and holy lustre I put into
thee.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_35"></span>[21:1](sbe29008.htm#fr_36) 6, 1. 'The wooers,
i.e. his own father, &c.' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[21:3](sbe29008.htm#fr_37) 'When the father of
the suitor and the others, together with their Â*k*ârya, have arrived at
the house of him who is to give away the girl, they station themselves
in the hall, and the father of the suitor says thrice, "Here am I, N.N.
(amuka*s*arman), Sir!"—in these words he announces himself three times .
. . . For at the house of the person who gives the girl away, there
arrive also, in order to see the festivities, many other people. In
order to distinguish himself from these, he pronounces his name.'
Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[22:6](sbe29008.htm#fr_38) The position of the
words as well as the sense favours combining the genitive kanyâyâ*h*
with â*k*ârya*h*, not with mûrdhani, though Râma*k*andra says that the
varapakshâ*k*ârya is to be understood.
