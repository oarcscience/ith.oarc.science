He causes Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as who are endowed with learning, moral character, and correct conduct, or with one of these (characteristics), who have been invited in time, who have taken a bath, washed their feet, and sipped water, to sit down, as representatives of the Fathers, with their faces turned to the north, one for each one of the Fathers, or two for each, or three for each.</p>  
<p>3. The larger their number is, the greater is the reward (which the sacrificer is entitled to expect).</p>

Grandfather, this is thy Arghya. Great-grandfather, this is thy Arghya'&#151;having first offered (ordinary) water (to the Fathers).</p>  
<p>14. When he is going to hand over that (Arghya water to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as who represent the Fathers, he says once each time), 'Svadh&acirc;! The Arghya water!'</p>

Comp. on the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha ceremonies in general the note on <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 1, 1, and the quotations given there. The P&acirc;rva<I>n</I>a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha, which is celebrated on the new-moon day, is treated of by <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana IV, 1, the &Acirc;bhyudayika <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha, IV, 4, the Ekoddish<I>t</I>a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha, IV, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_623"></A><A HREF="sbe29152.htm#fr_624">251:5</A> An&acirc;dye. Of the different interpretations of this word which N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a gives, it may suffice here to quote two. The first <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha may either mean the P&acirc;rva<I>n</I>a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha, because this stands first among the different kinds of <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha ceremonies enumerated in S&ucirc;tra 1; or it may mean the Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>&icirc;kara<I>n</I>a (see S&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana IV, 3), for this is the first occasion on which a dead person receives <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha oblations together with two others of the Fathers.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_624"></A><A HREF="sbe29152.htm#fr_625">251:6</A> The sacrifice to the Manes, as forming part of the <I>S</I>rauta ritual, is explained in the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra II, 6 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_625"></A><A HREF="sbe29152.htm#fr_626">251:8</A> Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya I, 229.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_626"></A><A HREF="sbe29152.htm#fr_627">251:9</A> Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya I, 230. The reading of several words of the Mantra is doubtful, and the parallel texts, as Prof. Stenzler has not failed to observe, differ; especially the words pratnavadbhi<I>h</I> pratta<I>h</I> seem to me to be corrupt. The word pratnavat is only known to the Petersburg Dictionary as having the meaning, 'containing the word pratna,' which will not do here. Thus, I think that the reading pratnam adbhi<I>h</I> p<I>ri</I>kta<I>h</I> should be adopted; the translation would be, 'Anciently thou hast been mixed with water.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_627"></A><A HREF="sbe29152.htm#fr_628">252:12</A> Comp. <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 4, 6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_628"></A><A HREF="sbe29152.htm#fr_629">252:13</A> The part of the hand above the thumb is called the 'T&icirc;rtha belonging to the Manes;' see, for instance, Baudh&acirc;yana's Dharma-s&ucirc;tra I, 8, 16. The sacrificer is here understood to wear his sacrificial cord suspended over the left shoulder (he is 'y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>opav&icirc;tin'). But as the oblation here treated of is directed to the Manes, it is required that he should be pr&acirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;n&acirc;v&icirc;tin. Now he is considered as pr&acirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;n&acirc;v&icirc;tin, according to N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, not only if the cord is suspended over his right shoulder (which is the ordinary meaning of pr&acirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;n&acirc;v&icirc;tin), but also if the hand with which he performs the rites, and the shoulder over which he wears the sacred cord, are either both right or both left. Thus here, acting with the left-hand and wearing the cord over the left shoulder, he becomes pr&acirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;n&acirc;v&icirc;tin.</p>  
<p>The last word (app&ucirc;rvam) is separated by N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a from the rest, so that it forms a separate S&ucirc;tra.</P>

Instead of p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc; sambabh&ucirc;vu<I>h</I> (p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc; being intended as a locative; see Lanman, Noun-inflection in the Veda, p. 389) we should read, no doubt, as the parallel texts have, payas&acirc; sambabh&ucirc;vu<I>h</I>: 'The celestial waters which have united themselves with milk.'</P>
