### KA*ND*IKÂ 6.

1 <span id="fr_704"></span>[1](#fn_703). The girl's brother pours out of
his joined hands into her joined hands fried grain mixed with *S*amî
leaves.

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

2 <span id="fr_705"></span>[2](#fn_704). This she sacrifices, with
firmly joined hands, standing, (while the bridegroom recites the
verses,)

'To the god Aryaman the girls have made sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god
Aryaman, loosen us from here, and not from the husband. Svâhâ!

'This woman, strewing grains, prays thus, "May my husband live long; may
my relations be prosperous." Svâhâ!

'These grains I throw into the fire: may this bring prosperity to thee,
and may it unite me with thee. May Agni grant us that. N.N.! Svâhâ!'

3 <span id="fr_706"></span>[3](#fn_705). He then seizes her right hand
together with the thumb, with (the verses),

'I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness, that thou mayst live to old
age with me, thy husband. Bhaga, Aryaman, Sâvitrî, Purandhi, the gods
have given thee to me that we may rule our house.

'This am I, that art thou; that art thou, this am I. The Sâman am I, the
*Rik* thou; the heaven I, the earth thou.

'Come! Let us marry. Let us unite our sperm. Let us beget offspring. Let
us acquire many sons, and may they reach old age.

'Loving, bright, with genial minds may we see a hundred autumns, may we
live a hundred autumns, may we hear a hundred autumns!'
