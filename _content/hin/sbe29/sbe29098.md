Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 6.

1\. Having worshipped the Sun with (the verses), 'Savit*ri* from the
west,' 'This eye' (Rig-veda X, 36, 14; VII, 66, 16),

2 <span id="fr_343"></span>[2](#fn_342). They turn away, come back, sit
down.

3\. With (the words), 'As the water is appeased'—they draw water out of
the vessel used for the expiation,

4\. Pour it out on the ground,

5 <span id="fr_344"></span>[5](#fn_343). Spread (some) of that (water
over the ground) with (the words), 'As the earth (is appeased),'—

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

6 <span id="fr_345"></span>[6](#fn_344). He (then) smears it on his
right shoulder with (the words), 'Thus may peace dwell in me.'

7\. In the same way a second time.

8\. In the same way a third time.

9\. 'Piece by piece thou art produced; piece by piece thou risest up;
bring welfare to us, O house!'—with (this text they) take pieces of
Dûrvâ stalks (out of the vessel of water), put them on their heads,

10 <span id="fr_346"></span>[10](#fn_345). (And make water-offerings
with the formulas), 'May Agni satiate himself; may Vâyu satiate himself;
may Sûrya satiate himself; may Vish*n*u satiate himself; may Pra*g*âpati
satiate himself; may Virûpâksha satiate himself; may Sahasrâksha satiate
himself; may all beings satiate themselves.'

11 <span id="fr_347"></span>[11](#fn_346). (Then) Sumantu, *G*aimini,
Vai*s*ampâyana, Paila, and the other teachers (receive their offerings).

12 <span id="fr_348"></span>[12](#fn_347). (Then) every one (worships in
the same way) his fathers.

13\. With (the text), 'To the sea you' (*S*raut. IV, 11, 11) they pour
out the water,

14\. Murmur the Vâmadevya,

15\. And separate according to their pleasure.

16\. (The final benedictory formula runs thus), 'Through the power of
wisdom, of *S*ruti and Sm*ri*ti, as handed down by tradition, through
(that power) which has its measure in (the Vedic texts) that have been
gone through(?), and which is possessed of

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

undisputed firmness, may peace be with us in welfare. Adoration be to
gods, *Ri*shis, Manes, and men! May they whom we have adored, make happy
life, beauty, health, peace, incolumity, imperishableness, vigour,
splendour, glory, power, holy lustre, renown, age, offspring, cattle,
adoration, increase. From wrongly spoken, wrongly used (prayer), from
everything that is deficient or excessive, for the good of gods and
*Ri*shis, may the Brahman and Truth protect me; may the Brahman and
Truth protect me!'

End of the Sixth Adhyâya.

End of the *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[148:2](sbe29098.htm#fr_343) 6, 2. Nârâya*n*a
explains vyâvartamânâ*h* by parâvartamânadharmayuktâ*h*.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[148:5](sbe29098.htm#fr_344) Perhaps we should
read asyâm (scil. p*ri*thivyâm) abhikarshanti, <span id="page_149">p.
149</span> and translate, 'they draw (lines of that water) on this
(earth).'

<span id="fn_344"></span>[149:6](sbe29098.htm#fr_345) Nârâya*n*a says
that all the students are to do so.
