### KÂ*ND*A III, KA*ND*IKÂ 1.

1 <span id="fr_866"></span>[1](#fn_865). (Now shall be explained) the
partaking of the first-fruits (of the harvest), of a person who has not
set up the (sacred *S*rauta) fires.

2 <span id="fr_867"></span>[2](#fn_866). He cooks a mess of fresh
sacrificial food, sacrifices the two Â*g*ya portions, and two Â*g*ya
oblations, (with the formulas),

'To the hundredfold armed, hundredfold valiant, hundredfold blissful
one, the vanquisher of enemies—he who may create a hundred autumns for
us, Indra,—may he lead us across (the gulf of) misfortune. Svâhâ!

'The four paths that go between heaven and earth, trodden by the gods—of
these (paths) lead us to that which may bring us freedom from decay and
decline, O all ye gods. Svâhâ!'

3 <span id="fr_868"></span>[3](#fn_867). Having made oblations of the
mess of cooked food to the Âgraya*n*a deities, he makes another oblation
to (Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t with (the verse), 'Agni, make this (sacrifice)
full, that it may be well offered. And may the god destroy all hostile
powers. Come hither, showing us a good path. Bestow on us long life,
full of splendour and free from decay. Svâhâ!'

4\. He then eats (of the fresh fruits with the

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

verses), 'May Agni eat first, for he knows how the Havis (is fit for
sacrifice); may he, the friend of all human tribes, make the herbs
blessed to us.

From the good you have led us to the better, ye gods! Through thee, the
nourishment, may we obtain thee. Thus enter into us, O potion, bringing
refreshment, for the good of our children and of ourselves, and
pleasant.'

5 <span id="fr_869"></span>[5](#fn_868). Or with the (verse) sacred to
Annapati (the Lord of food).

6 <span id="fr_870"></span>[6](#fn_869). For barley, however, (he uses
the Mantra), 'This barley, mixed with honey, they have ploughed through
Sarasvatî under Manu. Indra was lord of the plough, the hundredfold wise
one; ploughers were the Maruts, the exuberant givers.'

7\. Then (follows) the feeding of the Brâhma*n*as.
