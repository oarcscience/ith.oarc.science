<P><A NAME="fn_147"></A><A HREF="sbe29037.htm#fr_148">69:1</A> 7, 1. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'Now (atha), i.e. after the observance of the <I>S</I>ukriya vrata,' &amp;c. On the Sukriya vrata which has to be undergone before the Anuva<I>k</I>ana treated of in this chapter can be performed, see the note on chap. 4, 1, and below, chap. II, 9. One would have expected that in the arrangement of <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana the rites belonging to the Sukriya vrata would precede the exposition of the Anuva<I>k</I>ana. Perhaps it was in consequence of the exact analogy of the Sukriya with the <I>S</I>&acirc;kvara, Vr&acirc;tika, Aupanishada vratas, that the description of the former has been postponed till the latter had to be treated of.</p>  
<p>R&acirc;ma<I>k</I>andra's Paddhati has the following remark here, 'Now the way of studying the Veda, called Anuva<I>k</I>ana, is set forth. This can be done only after the Sukriya vrata has been enjoined on the student; before that nothing but the S&acirc;vitr&icirc; can be taught to him.'</P>

N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a states, in accordance with these S&ucirc;tras of the fifth chapter, that in case the student belongs to the second or third caste, an &Ucirc;ha (i.e. a corresponding alteration of the formulas; from the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra, VI, 1, 3 the definition is quoted here <I>s</I>abdavik&acirc;ram &ucirc;ha<I>m</I> bruvate) takes place.

A Vai<I>s</I>ya has to say, 'Recite the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;, sir!'&#151;'Recite the verse of Hira<I>n</I>yast&ucirc;pa (or, of V&acirc;madeva, Rig-veda I, 35, 9 or IV, 40, 5), sir!'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_153"></A><A HREF="sbe29037.htm#fr_154">70:17</A> Comp. Indische Studien, X, 132, note 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_154"></A><A HREF="sbe29037.htm#fr_155">71:18-20</A> I do not think that Professor Weber (Indische Studien, X, 132) has quite exactly rendered the meaning of these S&ucirc;tras when he says, 'The teacher then (i.e. after the formula of S&ucirc;tra 17 has been pronounced) teaches him first the <I>Ri</I>shi, the deity, and the metre of each Mantra. In case he does not know them himself for a Mantra, he recites the holy S&acirc;vitr&icirc; (tat Savitur vare<I>n</I>yam). After this he teaches him in due order either (1) the single <I>Ri</I>shis, i.e. the hymns belonging to each <I>Ri</I>shi, or (2) the single Anuv&acirc;kas,' &amp;C.&#151;It does not seem quite probable to me that the student should have had to learn first the <I>Ri</I>shis, deities, and metres of the whole Veda, before the text of the hymns was taught him; I rather believe that hymn by hymn the indication of the <I>Ri</I>shis, &amp;c. preceded the anuva<I>k</I>ana of the text itself, and with this opinion the statement of N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a agrees, 'Eva<I>m</I> p&ucirc;rvoktena prak&acirc;re<I>n</I>a <I>ri</I>shidevat&acirc;<I>kh</I>anda<I>h</I>p&ucirc;rvaka<I>m</I> ta<I>m</I>&nbsp;ta<I>m</I> Agnim &icirc;<I>l</I>a ity&acirc;dika<I>m</I> mantra<I>m</I> m&acirc;<I>n</I>avak&acirc;y&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ryo<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>nubr&ucirc;y&acirc;t.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_155"></A><A HREF="sbe29037.htm#fr_156">71:19</A> According to N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a by esheti (literally, 'This [is the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>]') it is meant that the teacher, after having recited the S&acirc;vitr&icirc; in the three ways mentioned, should say to the student, 'This <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> is in the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; metre. If recited p&acirc;da by p&acirc;da, it has three p&acirc;das. Thus also this <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>, if recited hemistich by hemistich, has two Avas&acirc;nas (pauses), the first at the end of the hemistich, the second at the end of the third <I>k</I>arma (or p&acirc;da). Thus also this <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> is recited without stopping; at the end of the three <I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>as, or of the twenty-four syllables, the pause (avas&acirc;na) should be made. Thus I recite to thee the S&acirc;vitr&icirc;; I recite to thee the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;; I recite to thee the verse of Vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;mitra.' 'For,' adds N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, 'if the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; has been recited, the whole complex of the Veda being of that very <A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A> substance, a complete knowledge thereof has been produced.' The commentator then indicates a shorter form for the teacher's words which our S&ucirc;tra prescribes by esheti, 'This verse belongs to Savitar; it is a G&acirc;yatr&icirc;; its <I>Ri</I>shi is Vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;mitra.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_156"></A><A HREF="sbe29037.htm#fr_157">72:21</A> The Kshudras&ucirc;ktas are the hymns Rig-veda X, 129-191.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_157"></A><A HREF="sbe29037.htm#fr_158">72:24</A> 24 seq. This seems to be an abridged method by which students who had not the intention of becoming Vedic scholars, and probably chiefly students of the Kshatriya and Vai<I>s</I>ya caste, could fulfil their duty of learning the Veda; a student who knew the first and last hymn of a <I>Ri</I>shi, or of an Anuv&acirc;ka, was, as would seem from these S&ucirc;tras, by a sort of fiction considered as though he had known the whole portion belonging to that <I>Ri</I>shi, or the whole Anuv&acirc;ka.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_158"></A><A HREF="sbe29037.htm#fr_159">72:27</A> N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains <I>Ri</I>shisv&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya by mantrasa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;. He says, The Anuv&acirc;<I>k</I>ana which has been declared here, is to be understood also with regard to the sv&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya, i.e. to the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; of the Mantras.' I think there is a blunder in the MS., and instead of tad api sv&acirc;dhy&acirc;ye . . . <I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>eya<I>m</I> we ought to read tad <I>ri</I>shisv&acirc;dhy&acirc;ye . . . <I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>eya<I>m</I>. In this case we should have to translate the quoted passage, '. . . is to be understood with regard to the <I>Ri</I>shisv&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya, i.e. to, &amp;c.'&#151;I think, however, that the true meaning of the S&ucirc;tra is different from what N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a believes it to be. The expression vy&acirc;khy&acirc;tam apparently conveys a reference to another treatise in which the rules regarding the <I>Ri</I>shisv&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya would seem to have been fully set forth. The <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra contains <A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A> no passage which could be the one here referred to; we may suppose, therefore, that either a chapter of a Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya is quoted here, or a separate treatise on the special subject of the <I>Ri</I>shisv&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya. References to such treatises are found in the S&ucirc;tra texts in several instances, of which the most important is that in the Gobhila-G<I>ri</I>hya I, 5, 13, 'On what day the moon becomes full, the knowledge thereof is contained in a special text; that one either should study or ascertain when the Parvan is from those who have studied it.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_159"></A><A HREF="sbe29037.htm#fr_160">73:28</A> N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'First stand the Mantras, then the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, because it contains the viniyoga (the ritual use of the Mantras), then the Sm<I>ri</I>ti texts such as Manu, &amp;c. When he has repeated these texts to the student, after the end of the Anuv&acirc;<I>k</I>ana, the teacher should take from the student the Ku<I>s</I>a blades which had been taken up before for the sake of the Anuv&acirc;<I>k</I>ana (see S&ucirc;tras 5 seq.),' &amp;c.&#151;The teacher is made the subject of this rule also by R&acirc;ma<I>k</I>andra. On yath&acirc;s&ucirc;ktam N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a observes that according to some teachers these water oblations were directed to the <I>Ri</I>shis of the different hymns (<I>ri</I>sh&icirc;n uddi<I>s</I>yeti ke<I>k</I>it). This statement seems to be countenanced by IV, 6, 6. Comp. the note below on IV, 9, 1.</P>
