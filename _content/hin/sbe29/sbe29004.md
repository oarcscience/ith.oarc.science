*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 2.

1\. At the end of the sacrificial acts (follows) the distribution of
food to Brâhma*n*as.

2\. Voice, (pleasantness of) form, age, learning, moral character,
(right) conduct are the qualities (required in the Brâhma*n*as who are
to be invited thereto).

3\. Learning, however, outweighs every (other qualification).

4\. A learned one should not be passed over.

5\. 'The threefold (knowledge, viz. that) which refers to the deities,
that which refers to the Âtman, and that which refers to sacrifice,

'(Handed down) in the Mantras and in the Brâhma*n*a: this is called
learning.

6\. 'A performer of the sacred rights, a man who has studied (the Veda),
who is old in learning and devoted to austerities:

'He who gives food (even) once to such (a Brâhma*n*a), hunger will not
befall that man any more.

7\. 'Whatsoever deity he may wish to satiate at any sacrifice,

'Destining it to that (deity) in his mind, he shall give (the food) to a
person like that.

8\. 'An oblation deposited in a person like that will never miss its way
to the deity;

'Treasure of men, vessel of gods (in which they receive what is given to
them) he is called.'
