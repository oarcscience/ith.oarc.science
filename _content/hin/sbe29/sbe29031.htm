<P><A NAME="fn_119"></A><A HREF="sbe29031.htm#fr_120">58:1</A> 1, 1. With regard to the standing terminology of the Upanayana, or the initiation of the student, we may observe that upa-n&icirc; does not mean, as, for instance, Professor Stenzler seems to understand it, 'to introduce a student to his teacher.' Thus P&acirc;raskara's S&ucirc;tra II, 2, 1, ash<I>t</I>&acirc;varsha<I>m</I> br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>am upanayet, &amp;c., is translated by that distinguished scholar, 'Den achtj&auml;hrigen Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a soll er (beim Lehrer) einf&uuml;hren,' &amp;c. (comp. also &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya I, 19, 1). The texts clearly point to another translation of upa-n&icirc;, for they show that the person that introduces the student (upanayati or upanayate; the middle is used very frequently, for instance, <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a XI, 5, 4, 1; <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh. II, I, 25) is not the father or a relation of the youth who could be supposed to lead him to the teacher, but the teacher himself; he introduces (upanayati) him to the brahma<I>k</I>arya, or introduces him with himself, and the student enters upon (upaiti) the brahma<I>k</I>arya, or enters with (upaiti) the teacher; he who has thus entered upon studentship, is consequently designated as upeta (<I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh. IV, 8, 1; P&acirc;raskara III, 10, 10), and for the initiation, which is usually called up an ay an a, occasionally also the word up&acirc;yana is used (see the M&acirc;nava-G<I>ri</I>hya I, 22, quoted by Professor Jolly in his article, Das Dharma-s&ucirc;tra des Vish<I>n</I>u, p. 79). The following passages may be quoted here as supporting our opinion on this terminology. At <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a XI, 5, 3, 13 <I>S</I>au<I>k</I>eya says to Udd&acirc;laka &Acirc;ru<I>n</I>i, 'I will enter (as a student) with the reverend One' (up&acirc;y&acirc;ni bhagavantam); and &Acirc;ru<I>n</I>i replies, 'Come, enter (with me)!' (ehy upehi), 'and he initiated him' (ta<I>m</I> hopaninye). Ibid. XI, 5, 4, 16 it is stated that according to some a teacher who has initiated a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a as a student (br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a<I>m</I> brahma<I>k</I>aryam upan&icirc;ya) should abstain from sexual intercourse, for a student who enters upon studentship (yo brahma<I>k</I>aryam upaiti) becomes, as it were, a garbha, &amp;c. Finally we may add that the Buddhist terminology regarding the entering into the order or upon a life of righteousness is clearly connected with that followed, for instance, in the dialogue between <A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A> <I>S</I>au<I>k</I>eya and &Acirc;ru<I>n</I>i. As <I>S</I>au<I>k</I>eya there says, up&acirc;y&acirc;ni bhagavantam, we frequently read in the P&acirc;li books expressions like this, upemi Buddha<I>m</I> sara<I>n</I>a<I>m</I> dhamma<I>&ntilde;</I> <I>k</I>&acirc;pi anuttara<I>m</I>, &amp;c. (Dhammap. A<I>t</I><I>th</I>akath&acirc;, p. 97, ed. Fausb&ouml;ll), and as &Acirc;ru<I>n</I>i replies, ehy upehi, Buddha says to those who wish to be ordained, ehi bhikkhu, sv&acirc;kkh&acirc;to dhammo, <I>k</I>ara brahma<I>k</I>ariya<I>m</I>, &amp;c. (Mah&acirc;vagga I, 6, 32, &amp;c.; S.B.E., vol. xiii, p. 74, note).</p>  
<p>The counting of the years not from the birth but from the conception occurs both in the Brahmanical and in the Buddhist ordinances, comp. H. O., Buddha, sein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde, p. 354, note 1. Several G<I>ri</I>hya texts (for instance, &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. I, 19, 1. 2) admit both ways of counting the years. The number of years given for the Upanayana of persons of the three castes (Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as 8-16, Kshatriyas 11-22, Vai<I>s</I>yas 12-24) is evidently derived from the number of syllables of the three metres which are so very frequently stated to correspond to the three castes, to the three gods or categories of gods (Agni, Indra, Vi<I>s</I>ve dev&acirc;s) &amp;c., viz. the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, the Trish<I>t</I>ubh, and the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;. This is a very curious example, showing how in India phantastical speculations like those regarding the mystical qualities of the metres, were strong enough to influence the customs and institutions of real life.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_120"></A><A HREF="sbe29031.htm#fr_121">59:9</A> 9 seq. All these are standing expressions recurring nearly identically in most of the G<I>ri</I>hya and Dharma-s&ucirc;tras. In the rule contained in S&ucirc;tra 13 a number of the parallel texts have vivaheyu<I>h</I> or viv&acirc;hayeyu<I>h</I>, others have vyavahareyu<I>h</I>. Comp. Vasish<I>th</I>a XI, 75; Indische Studien, vol. x, p. 21.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_121"></A><A HREF="sbe29031.htm#fr_122">60:14</A> This S&ucirc;tra should rather be divided into two, as indicated in the translation. As to the mekhal&acirc; (girdle) comp. below, chap. 2, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_122"></A><A HREF="sbe29031.htm#fr_123">60:21</A> There is no doubt that pr&acirc;<I>n</I>asammito (which N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains thus, 'pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is the wind [or breath]; [the staff should] reach to the place where the wind leaves the body, i.e. to the tip of the nose') should either be corrected into, or explained as, ghr&acirc;<I>n</I>asammito; the <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya MS. has ghr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;ntiko br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>asya. Comp. Gautama I, 26, &amp;c. The parallel texts agree in assigning the longer staff to the higher, not as <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana does, to the lower caste.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_123"></A><A HREF="sbe29031.htm#fr_124">61:26</A> After the introductory remarks given in the preceding S&ucirc;tras the ritual itself of the Upanayana is now described.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_124"></A><A HREF="sbe29031.htm#fr_125">61:28</A> N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: hutv&acirc;&#146;n&acirc;de<I>s</I>aparibh&acirc;sh&acirc;ta<I>h</I> (see above, I, 12, 13) purast&acirc;tsa<I>m</I><I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>aka<I>m</I> hutv&acirc; agni<I>m</I> sth&acirc;pit&acirc;gni<I>m</I> (see above, I, 5, 2) <I>g</I>aghanena . . . tish<I>th</I>ata<I>h</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_125"></A><A HREF="sbe29031.htm#fr_126">61:30</A> This S&ucirc;tra is wanting in most of the MSS. (see the note, p. 48 of the German edition). It contains the Mantra with which the A<I>g</I>ina (the hide mentioned in S&ucirc;tras 2, 4, 5 of this chapter) is put on. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a gives the Mantra which he says is taken from the M&acirc;dhyandina-G<I>ri</I>hya (in the P&acirc;raskara-G<I>ri</I>hya it is not found), after chap. 2, 3, and he states that the corresponding act to which it belongs has its place after the rites concerning the girdle (chap. 2, 1) and the sacrificial cord (2, 3).</P>
