### KA*ND*IKÂ 12.

1\. When a battle is beginning, (the royal Purohita) should cause the
king to put on his armour (in the following way).

2 <span id="fr_564"></span>[12\_2](#fn_563). (The Purohita) stations
himself to the west of (the king's) chariot with (the hymn?), 'I have
brought thee hither; be here' (Rig-veda X, 173).

3\. With (the verse), 'Like a thunder-cloud is his countenance'
(Rig-veda VI, 75, 1), he should tender the coat of mail to him.

4\. With the following (verse) the bow.

5\. The following (verse) he should cause him to repeat.

6\. He should murmur himself the fourth.

7\. With the fifth he should tender the quiver to him.

8\. When (the king) starts, the sixth.

9\. The seventh (he recites) over the horses.

10\. The eighth he should cause (the king) to repeat while looking at
the arrows;

11\. (The verse), 'Like a serpent it encircles the arm with its
windings' (Rig-veda VI, 75, 14), when he ties to his arm the leather (by
which the arm is protected against the bow-string).

12 <span id="fr_565"></span>[12](#fn_564). He then mounts up to (the
king on his chariot), while he is driving, and causes him to repeat the
Abhîvarta hymn (Rig-veda X, 174) and the two verses, 'He who, Mitra and
Varu*n*a' (Rig-veda VIII, 101, 3 seq.).

13 <span id="fr_566"></span>[13](#fn_565). He then should look at him
with the Apratiratha, *S*âsa, and Saupar*n*a hymns.

14 <span id="fr_567"></span>[14](#fn_566). The Saupar*n*a is (the hymn),
'May the streams of honey and ghee flow forwards.'

15\. (The king) should drive (in his chariot successively) to all
quarters (of the horizon).

16\. He should commence the battle in the line of battle invented by
Âditya or by U*s*anas.

17 <span id="fr_568"></span>[17-18](#fn_567). He should touch the drum
with the three verses, 'Fill earth and heaven with thy roar' (Rig-veda
VI, 47, 29 seqq.).

18\. With (the verse), 'Shot off fall down' (Rig-veda VI, 75, 16), he
should shoot off the arrows.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

19 <span id="fr_569"></span>[19](#fn_568). 'Where the arrows fly' (l.l.
v. 17)—this (verse) he should murmur while they are fighting.

20\. Or he should teach (the king the texts mentioned). Or he should
teach (the king).

End of the Third Adhyâya.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_563"></span>[233:12\_2](sbe29145.htm#fr_564) 12, 2.
According to Nârâya*n*a the Pratîka here signifies not the verse, but
the whole hymn, though a whole Pâda is given (comp. *S*rauta-sûtra I, 1,
17).

<span id="fn_564"></span>[234:12](sbe29145.htm#fr_565) The Abhîvarta
hymn begins with the word abhîvartena, and is ascribed to Abhîvarta
Âṅgirasa.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[234:13](sbe29145.htm#fr_566) The Apratiratha
hymn is Rig-veda X, 103 (ascribed to Apratiratha Aindra); the *S*âsa, X,
152 (ascribed to Sâsa Bhâradvâ*g*a). On the Saupar*n*a, see the next
Sûtra.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[234:14](sbe29145.htm#fr_567) This hymn is not
found in any Vedic Sa*m*hitâ, as far s I know, nor does it occur in the
Supar*n*âdhyâya. I have followed Prof. Stenzler's conjecture pra dhârâ
yantu instead of pradhârayantu, which is confirmed by Sâya*n*a's note on
Aitareya Brâhma*n*a VI, 25, 7; VIII, 10, 4 (pp. 365, 399 ed. Aufrecht).

<span id="fn_567"></span>[234:17-18](sbe29145.htm#fr_568) 17, 18.
According to Nârâya*n*a the subject is the king.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[235:19](sbe29145.htm#fr_569) Here the subject
is the Purohita.
