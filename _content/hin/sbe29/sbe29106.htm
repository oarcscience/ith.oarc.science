Having placed to the west of the fire a mill-stone, to the north-east (of the fire) a water-pot, he should sacrifice, while she takes hold of him. Standing, with his face turned to the west, while she is sitting and turns her face to the east, he should with (the formula), 'I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness seize her thumb if he desires that only male children may be born to him;</p>

Leading her three times round the fire and the water-pot, so that their right sides are turned towards (the fire, &amp;c.), he murmurs, 'This am I, that art thou; that art thou, this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the S&acirc;man I, the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> thou.

<p>16. He then loosens her two locks of hair, if they are made, (i.e. if) two tufts of wool are bound round her hair on the two sides,</p>

According to those teachers whose opinion is related in S&ucirc;tras 6-14, the leading round the fire, the treading on the stone, and the offering of fried grain (with the three parts of the Mantra, S&ucirc;tra 1 3) are repeated thrice; then follows the offering prescribed in S&ucirc;tra 14, so that the last two offerings follow immediately on each other.
