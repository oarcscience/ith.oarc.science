<p>'Law, the chief post! Fortune, the pinnacle! Day and night, the two door-boards!</p>  
<p>'Indra's house is wealthy, protecting; that I enter with my children, with my cattle, with everything that is mine.</p>  
<p>'Hither is called the whole number (of relatives), the friends whose coming is good. Thus (I enter) thee, O house. May our dwellings be full of inviolable heroes from all sides!'</p>
