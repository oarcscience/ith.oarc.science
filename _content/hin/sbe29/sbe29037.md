### KHA*ND*A 7.

1 <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_147). Now (follows the exposition) of
the study of the Veda.

2 <span id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_148). Both sit down to the north of
the fire,

3\. The teacher with his face to the east, the other one to the west.

4 <span id="fr_150"></span>[4](#fn_149). After (the student) has
reverentially saluted the teacher's feet and has sprinkled his (own)
hands (with water),

5\. And has kneeled down with his right knee on young Ku*s*a shoots at
their roots,

6 <span id="fr_151"></span>[6](#fn_150). And has grasped round (those
Ku*s*a shoots) in 'heir middle with his hands, holding the right
uppermost,

7\. The teacher, having seized them at their tops

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

with his left hand, and with his right hand sprinkling them with water,
then makes the other say:

8 <span id="fr_152"></span>[8](#fn_151). 'Recite the Sâvitrî, sir!' says
the other.

9\. 'I recite the Sâvitrî to thee!' says the teacher.

10 <span id="fr_153"></span>[10](#fn_152). 'Recite the Gâyatrî, sir!'
says the other.

'I recite the Gâyatrî to thee!' says the teacher.

11\. 'Recite the verse of Vi*s*vâmitra, sir!' says the other.

'I recite the verse of Vi*s*vâmitra to thee!' says the teacher.

12\. 'Recite the *Ri*shis, sir!' says the other.

I recite the *Ri*shis to thee!' says the teacher.

13\. 'Recite the deities, sir!' says the other.

'I recite the deities to thee!' says the teacher.

14\. 'Recite the metres, sir!' says the other.

'I recite the metres to thee!' says the teacher.

15\. 'Recite the *S*ruti, sir!' says the other.

'I recite the *S*ruti to thee!' says the teacher.

16\. 'Recite the Sm*ri*ti, sir!' says the other.

'I recite the Sm*ri*ti to thee!' says the teacher.

17 <span id="fr_154"></span>[17](#fn_153). 'Recite faith and insight,
sir!' says the other.

'I recite faith and insight to thee!' says the teacher.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

18 <span id="fr_155"></span>[18-20](#fn_154). In that way, according to
what *Ri*shi each hymn belongs to and what its deity and its metre is,
thus (with the corresponding indications of *Ri*shi, &c.) let him recite
each hymn;

19 <span id="fr_156"></span>[19](#fn_155). Or also, if he does not know
the *Ri*shis, deities, and metres, the teacher recites this verse, 'That
glorious (splendour) of Savitar' (Rig-veda III, 62, 10), pâda by pâda,
hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) without a stop, and says, when he
has finished, 'This (verse belongs to Savitar; it is a Gâyatrî;
Vi*s*vâmitra is its *Ri*shi).'

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

20\. Let him thus recite (the hymns belonging to) each *Ri*shi, or
(each) Anuvâka;

21 <span id="fr_157"></span>[21](#fn_156). Of the short hymns (in the
tenth Ma*nd*ala) an Anuvâka,

22\. Or as much as the master may think fit.

23\. Or optionally he may recite the first and last hymn of (each)
*Ri*shi,

24 <span id="fr_158"></span>[24](#fn_157). Or of (each) Anuvâka,

25\. (Or) one (verse) of the beginning of each hymn.

26\. The teacher may optionally say at the beginning of the hymn, 'This
is the commencement.'

27 <span id="fr_159"></span>[27](#fn_158). This has been (further)
explained in (the treatise about) the *Ri*shisvâdhyâya.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

28 <span id="fr_160"></span>[28](#fn_159). When (the lesson) is
finished, he takes the young Ku*s*a shoots, makes of cow-dung a pit at
their roots, and sprinkles water on the Ku*s*a (shoots) for each hymn.

29 <span id="fr_161"></span>[29](#fn_160). For the rest of the day
standing and fasting.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_147"></span>[69:1](sbe29037.htm#fr_148) 7, 1. Nârâya*n*a:
'Now (atha), i.e. after the observance of the *S*ukriya vrata,' &c. On
the Sukriya vrata which has to be undergone before the Anuva*k*ana
treated of in this chapter can be performed, see the note on chap. 4, 1,
and below, chap. II, 9. One would have expected that in the arrangement
of *S*âṅkhâyana the rites belonging to the Sukriya vrata would precede
the exposition of the Anuva*k*ana. Perhaps it was in consequence of the
exact analogy of the Sukriya with the *S*âkvara, Vrâtika, Aupanishada
vratas, that the description of the former has been postponed till the
latter had to be treated of.

Râma*k*andra's Paddhati has the following remark here, 'Now the way of
studying the Veda, called Anuva*k*ana, is set forth. This can be done
only after the Sukriya vrata has been enjoined on the student; before
that nothing but the Sâvitrî can be taught to him.'

<span id="fn_148"></span>[69:2](sbe29037.htm#fr_149) 2 seq. Comp. above,
chap. 2, 8 seq.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[69:4](sbe29037.htm#fr_150) The way in which
this reverential salutation should be performed is described below, IV,
12, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[69:6](sbe29037.htm#fr_151) On
dakshi*n*ottarâbhyâm, see chap. 2, 11 and Nârâya*n*a's note there.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[70:8](sbe29037.htm#fr_152) 8 seq. Comp.
Weber's Indische Studien, vol. x, p. 131 seq.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[70:10](sbe29037.htm#fr_153) Comp. the note on
chap. 5, 4-6. Nârâya*n*a states, in accordance with these Sûtras of the
fifth chapter, that in case the student belongs to the second or third
caste, an Ûha (i.e. a corresponding alteration of the formulas; from the
*S*rauta-sûtra, VI, 1, 3 the definition is quoted here *s*abdavikâram
ûha*m* bruvate) takes place. If he is a Kshatriya, he has to say,
'Recite the Trish*t*ubh, sir!'—'Recite the verse of Hira*n*yastûpa
(Rig-veda I, 35, 2), sir!' A Vai*s*ya has to say, 'Recite the *G*agatî,
sir!'—'Recite the verse of Hira*n*yastûpa (or, of Vâmadeva, Rig-veda I,
35, 9 or IV, 40, 5), sir!'

<span id="fn_153"></span>[70:17](sbe29037.htm#fr_154) Comp. Indische
Studien, X, 132, note 1.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[71:18-20](sbe29037.htm#fr_155) I do not think
that Professor Weber (Indische Studien, X, 132) has quite exactly
rendered the meaning of these Sûtras when he says, 'The teacher then
(i.e. after the formula of Sûtra 17 has been pronounced) teaches him
first the *Ri*shi, the deity, and the metre of each Mantra. In case he
does not know them himself for a Mantra, he recites the holy Sâvitrî
(tat Savitur vare*n*yam). After this he teaches him in due order either
(1) the single *Ri*shis, i.e. the hymns belonging to each *Ri*shi, or
(2) the single Anuvâkas,' &C.—It does not seem quite probable to me that
the student should have had to learn first the *Ri*shis, deities, and
metres of the whole Veda, before the text of the hymns was taught him; I
rather believe that hymn by hymn the indication of the *Ri*shis, &c.
preceded the anuva*k*ana of the text itself, and with this opinion the
statement of Nârâya*n*a agrees, 'Eva*m* pûrvoktena prakâre*n*a
*ri*shidevatâ*kh*anda*h*pûrvaka*m* ta*m* ta*m* Agnim î*l*a ityâdika*m*
mantra*m* mâ*n*avakâyâ*k*âryo<sup>ऽ</sup>nubrûyât.'

<span id="fn_155"></span>[71:19](sbe29037.htm#fr_156) According to
Nârâya*n*a by esheti (literally, 'This \[is the *Rik*\]') it is meant
that the teacher, after having recited the Sâvitrî in the three ways
mentioned, should say to the student, 'This *Rik* is in the Gâyatrî
metre. If recited pâda by pâda, it has three pâdas. Thus also this
*Rik*, if recited hemistich by hemistich, has two Avasânas (pauses), the
first at the end of the hemistich, the second at the end of the third
*k*arma (or pâda). Thus also this *Rik* is recited without stopping; at
the end of the three *k*ara*n*as, or of the twenty-four syllables, the
pause (avasâna) should be made. Thus I recite to thee the Sâvitrî; I
recite to thee the Gâyatrî; I recite to thee the verse of Vi*s*vâmitra.'
'For,' adds Nârâya*n*a, 'if the Gâyatrî has been recited, the whole
complex of the Veda being of that very <span id="page_72">p. 72</span>
substance, a complete knowledge thereof has been produced.' The
commentator then indicates a shorter form for the teacher's words which
our Sûtra prescribes by esheti, 'This verse belongs to Savitar; it is a
Gâyatrî; its *Ri*shi is Vi*s*vâmitra.'

<span id="fn_156"></span>[72:21](sbe29037.htm#fr_157) The Kshudrasûktas
are the hymns Rig-veda X, 129-191.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[72:24](sbe29037.htm#fr_158) 24 seq. This seems
to be an abridged method by which students who had not the intention of
becoming Vedic scholars, and probably chiefly students of the Kshatriya
and Vai*s*ya caste, could fulfil their duty of learning the Veda; a
student who knew the first and last hymn of a *Ri*shi, or of an Anuvâka,
was, as would seem from these Sûtras, by a sort of fiction considered as
though he had known the whole portion belonging to that *Ri*shi, or the
whole Anuvâka.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[72:27](sbe29037.htm#fr_159) Nârâya*n*a
explains *Ri*shisvâdhyâya by mantrasa*m*hitâ. He says, The Anuvâ*k*ana
which has been declared here, is to be understood also with regard to
the svâdhyâya, i.e. to the Sa*m*hitâ of the Mantras.' I think there is a
blunder in the MS., and instead of tad api svâdhyâye . . . *gñ*eya*m* we
ought to read tad *ri*shisvâdhyâye . . . *gñ*eya*m*. In this case we
should have to translate the quoted passage, '. . . is to be understood
with regard to the *Ri*shisvâdhyâya, i.e. to, &c.'—I think, however,
that the true meaning of the Sûtra is different from what Nârâya*n*a
believes it to be. The expression vyâkhyâtam apparently conveys a
reference to another treatise in which the rules regarding the
*Ri*shisvâdhyâya would seem to have been fully set forth. The
*S*rauta-sûtra contains <span id="page_73">p. 73</span> no passage which
could be the one here referred to; we may suppose, therefore, that
either a chapter of a Prâti*s*âkhya is quoted here, or a separate
treatise on the special subject of the *Ri*shisvâdhyâya. References to
such treatises are found in the Sûtra texts in several instances, of
which the most important is that in the Gobhila-G*ri*hya I, 5, 13, 'On
what day the moon becomes full, the knowledge thereof is contained in a
special text; that one either should study or ascertain when the Parvan
is from those who have studied it.'

<span id="fn_159"></span>[73:28](sbe29037.htm#fr_160) Nârâya*n*a: 'First
stand the Mantras, then the Brâhma*n*a, because it contains the viniyoga
(the ritual use of the Mantras), then the Sm*ri*ti texts such as Manu,
&c. When he has repeated these texts to the student, after the end of
the Anuvâ*k*ana, the teacher should take from the student the Ku*s*a
blades which had been taken up before for the sake of the Anuvâ*k*ana
(see Sûtras 5 seq.),' &c.—The teacher is made the subject of this rule
also by Râma*k*andra. On yathâsûktam Nârâya*n*a observes that according
to some teachers these water oblations were directed to the *Ri*shis of
the different hymns (*ri*shîn uddi*s*yeti ke*k*it). This statement seems
to be countenanced by IV, 6, 6. Comp. the note below on IV, 9, 1.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[73:29](sbe29037.htm#fr_161) 'This rule
concerns the Brahma*k*ârin.' Nârâya*n*a. See also Â*s*valâyana I, 22,
11.
