### KHA*ND*A 13.

1 <span id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_225). At the middle (Ash*t*akâ) and
in the middle of the rainy season,

2\. The four Mahâvyâh*ri*tis (and) the four (verses), They who have
thirsted' (Rig-veda X, 15, 9 seq.): having quickly recited (these
verses) he shall sacrifice the omentum;

3\. Or (he shall do so) with the verse, 'Carry the omentum, *G*âtavedas,
to the Manes, where thou knowest them in the world of virtue. May
streams of fat flow to them; may the wishes of the sacrificer be
fulfilled. Svâhâ!'

4\. (Then follow) the four Mahâvyâh*ri*tis (and) the four (verses),
'They who have thirsted' (see Sûtra 2): (thus is offered) an eightfold
oblation of cooked food, together with the cut-off portions.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

5 <span id="fr_227"></span>[5](#fn_226). Or, 'Interposed are the
mountains; interposed is the wide earth to me. With the sky and all the
points of the horizon I interpose another one instead of the father. To
N.N. svâhâ!

'Interposed to me are the seasons, and days and nights, the twilight's
children. With the months and half-months I interpose another one
instead of the father. To N.N. svâhâ!

'With the standing ones, with the streaming ones. with the small ones
that flow about: with the waters, the supporters of all I interpose
another one instead of the father. To N.N. svâhâ!

'Wherein my mother has done amiss, going astray, faithless to her
husband, that sperm may my father take as his own; may another one fall
off from the mother. To N.N. svâhâ!'—these four (verses) instead of the
Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, if (the sacrificer) is an illegitimate child.

6\. Or milk-rice (should be offered).

7 <span id="fr_228"></span>[7](#fn_227). On the next day the
Anvash*t*akya ceremony (i.e. ceremony following the Ash*t*akâ) in
accordance with the rite of the Pi*nd*apit*ri*ya*gñ*a.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_225"></span>[103:1](sbe29061.htm#fr_226) 13, 1. On
madhyâvarsha, comp. Weber, loc. cit., pp. 331, 337. Nârâya*n*a
understands not 'in the middle of the rainy season,' but 'in the middle
of the year' (see his note, p. 146 of the German edition). I cannot help
thinking that the word madhyâvarshe, given by the MSS. here and in
Pâraskara III, 3, 13, and explained by Nârâya*n*a, is a corrupt reading
which we should correct into mâghyavarshe ('the festival celebrated
during the rainy season under the Nakshatra Maghâs'), or something like
that. The MSS. of Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya II, 5, 9 have mâghyâvarsha*m*,
mâghâvarsha*m*, mâdhyâvarsha*m*. Vish*n*u (LXXVI, 1, comp. LXXVIII, 52,
and Professor Jolly's note, Sacred Books of the East, VII, p. 240)
mentions 'the three Ash*t*akâs, the three Anvash*t*akâs, a Mâgha day
which falls on the thirteenth of the dark half of the month
Praush*th*apada.' Comp. Manu III, 273, varshâsu *k*a maghâsu *k*a;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 260.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[104:5](sbe29061.htm#fr_227) Instead of 'N.N.'
(the text has the feminine amushyai) the sacrificer inserts the name of
his mother. For mâsâs, ardhamâsâs I propose to read, mâsais,
ardhamâsais.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[104:7](sbe29061.htm#fr_228) On Anvash*t*akya,
comp. Bühler, S.B.E., XIV, p. 55; Jolly. loc. cit., p. 59.
