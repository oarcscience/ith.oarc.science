<p>AMONG the Grantha MSS. collected by the late Dr. Burnell and now belonging to the India Office Library, there are some MSS. (numbers CLXXII and following of the Catalogue) of a G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra hitherto unpublished, which is ascribed to Kh&acirc;dir&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya. It belongs to the Dr&acirc;hy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a school of the S&acirc;ma-veda, which prevails in the south of the Indian peninsula&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_963"></A><A HREF="#fn_962"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and it is based on the Gobhil&icirc;ya-s&ucirc;tra, from which it has taken the greater number of its aphorisms, just as the Dr&acirc;hy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a-<I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra, as far as we can judge at present, is nothing but a slightly altered redaction of L&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_964"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Like the Gobhila-G<I>ri</I>hya it very seldom gives the Mantras in their full extent, but quotes them only with their Prat&icirc;kas, and it is easy to identify these quotations in the Mantrabr&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (published at Calcutta, 1873), which contains the texts prescribed by Gobhila for the G<I>ri</I>hya ceremonies.</p>  
<p>The Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya has evidently been composed with the intention of abridging Gobhila's very detailed and somewhat lengthy treatise on the domestic rites. Digressions, such as, for instance, that introduced by the words tatraihad &acirc;hu<I>h</I>, Gobhila I, 2, 10-27, or such as Gobhila's explication of the terms paur<I>n</I>am&acirc;s&icirc; and am&acirc;v&acirc;sy&acirc;, I, 5, 7 seqq., or most of the regulations concerning the <I>S</I>akvaryas, III, 3, or the <I>S</I>lokas, IV, 7, are invariably left</p>

<p>out, and in the descriptions of the single ceremonies throughout the principal points only are given, with the omission of all words and of all matter that it seemed possible to dispense with. On the other hand, the arrangement of the S&ucirc;tras has undergone frequent changes, in which the compiler clearly shows his intention of grouping together, more carefully than was done in the original text, the S&ucirc;tras which naturally belong to each other. Of the S&ucirc;tras of the Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya which cannot be identified in Gobhila, several are to be traced back to L&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yana, or we should perhaps rather say, to Dr&acirc;hy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a. Thus Kh&acirc;d. I, 1, 14 mantr&acirc;ntam avyakta<I>m</I> parasy&acirc;digraha<I>n</I>ena vidy&acirc;t evidently corresponds to L&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yana I, 1, 3, uttar&acirc;di<I>h</I> p&ucirc;rv&acirc;ntalaksha<I>n</I>am, and Kh&acirc;d. I, 1, 24 avy&acirc;v<I>ri</I>tti<I>m</I> ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;&#7749;gair avya<I>v</I>&acirc;ya<I>m</I> <I>k</I>e<I>kh</I>et is identical with L&acirc;<I>t</I>y. I, 2, 15, avyav&acirc;yo<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>vy&acirc;v<I>ri</I>tti<I>s</I> <I>k</I>a yag<I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;&#7749;gai<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Upon the whole, though certainly the Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya does not contain much matter which is not known to us from other sources, it notwithstanding possesses a certain interest, since it shows by a very clear example how a S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra of the later time would remodel the work of a more ancient author, trying to surpass him by a more correct arrangement, and especially by what became more and more appreciated as the chief accomplishment of S&ucirc;tra composition, the greatest possible succinctness and economising of words. To an interpreter of Gobhila the comparison of the Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya no doubt will suggest in many instances a more correct understanding of his text than he would have been likely to arrive at without that aid, and perhaps even readings of Gobhila which seemed hitherto subject to no doubt, will have to give way to readings supplied by the Grantha MSS. of the Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya. Thus, Gobhila III, 8, 16, I do not hesitate to correct asa<I>m</I>sv&acirc;dam, on the authority of Kh&acirc;d. III, 3, 13, into asa<I>m</I>kh&acirc;dam or asa<I>m</I>kh&acirc;dan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_965"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>As the text of the Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya is very short and has not yet been published, it has been printed at the foot of the page, together with references to the parallel passages of Gobhila. For further explanations of the single S&ucirc;tras, I refer to my translation of Gobhila which will form part of the second volume of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, where I shall also hope to give some extracts from Rudraskanda's commentary on the Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya.</p>
