*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 22.

1\. In the seventh month, at her first pregnancy, the Sîmantonnayana (or
parting of the hair).

2\. He causes her, after she has bathed and put on a (new) garment which
has not yet been washed, to sit down behind the fire.

3\. He sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, with the
Mahâvyâh*ri*tis.

4\. He cooks a mess of food,

5\. According to some (teachers) boiled rice with Mudga beans.

6\. The implements used and the Nakshatra should be of male gender.

7\. (He then sacrifices with the following texts,) 'May Dhâtar give to
his worshipper further life and safety; may we obtain the favour of the
god whose laws are truthful.

'Dhâtar disposes of offspring and wealth; Dhâtar has created this whole
world; Dhâtar will give a

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

son to the sacrificer: to him you shall sacrifice, an offering rich in
ghee.'

(Besides) with the three verses, 'Ne*g*amesha, fly away' (Rig-veda
Khailika sûkta, after X, 184, vol. vi, p. 31), and in the sixth place
the verse, 'Pra*g*âpati' (Rig-veda X, 121, 10).

8 <span id="fr_99"></span>[8](#fn_98). (The husband then) parts her
hair, upwards, beginning from the middle, with a porcupine's quill that
has three white spots, or with a Darbha needle together with unripe
Udumbara fruits, with the words, 'Bhûr bhuva*h* sva*h*.'

9\. He lays down (the thing he has used) in her lap,

10 <span id="fr_100"></span>[10](#fn_99). Ties (the fruits) to a string
of three twisted threads and fastens them to her neck with the words,
'Rich in sap is this tree; like the sappy one be thou fruitful.'

11 <span id="fr_101"></span>[11](#fn_100). (The husband) then says to
lute-players, 'Sing ye the king—

12\. 'Or if anybody else is still more valiant.'

13 <span id="fr_102"></span>[13](#fn_101). Having poured fried grain
into a water-pot, let him cause her to drink it with the six verses,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'May Vish*n*u take
care of thy womb,' 'I call Râkâ' (Rig-veda X, 184, 1; II, 32, 4-8).

14\. Let him then touch her (with the words),

15 <span id="fr_103"></span>[15](#fn_102). 'The winged one art thou, the
Garutmat; the Triv*ri*t (stoma) is thy head, the Gâyatra thy eye, the
metres thy limbs, the Ya*g*us thy name, the Sâman thy body.'

16 <span id="fr_104"></span>[16-17](#fn_103). Let him cause her to sing
merrily,

17\. Wearing, if she likes, many gold ornaments.

18\. A bull is the fee for the sacrifice.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_98"></span>[48:8](sbe29024.htm#fr_99) 22, 8. Comp. above,
chap. 12, 6.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[48:10](sbe29024.htm#fr_100) Nârâya*n*a:
tis*ri*bhis tantubhir v*ri*tte sûtre udumbaraphalâni . . . gale . . .
badhnâti. I have translated accordingly. Pâraskara I, 15, 6 uses the
same expression triv*ri*t. Professor Stenzler there translates it, on
the authority of *G*ayarâma, 'dreifache Haarflechte,' and says in his
note on that passage that, according to *S*âṅkhâyana, he would have to
tie the things with a threefold string to the neck of the woman, as if
*S*âṅkhâyana's statement were different from that of Pâraskara. But both
authors have the same word, and only the commentators differ in their
explanations thereof.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[48:11](sbe29024.htm#fr_101) Â*s*valâyana more
explicitly says (I, 14, 6), Soma*m* râ*g*âna*m* sa*m*gâyetâm iti.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[48:13](sbe29024.htm#fr_102) In my German
translation there is a mistake which should be corrected. I have there
referred shal*rik*a to the verses Râkâm <span id="page_79">p. 79</span>
aham, which are actually only five in number. The six verses are
Vish*n*ur yonim, &c., and the five verses mentioned.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[49:15](sbe29024.htm#fr_103) Vâ*g*asaneyi
