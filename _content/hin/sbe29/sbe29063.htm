<P><A NAME="fn_230"></A><A HREF="sbe29063.htm#fr_231">106:1</A> 1, 1. Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as 1-4 contain the rules regarding the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha oblations directed to the Manes. The dinners offered in connection with these <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha sacrifices to Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and also&#151;though of this of course no notice is taken in Vedic texts&#151;to <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as stood in the first line among the exhibitions of liberality of lay people towards priests and monks. Thus we find among the stock phrases that constantly reoccur in the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas, the mention of Sama<I>n</I>as and Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as 'who have eaten the food given to them out of faith' (saddh&acirc;deyy&acirc;ni bho<I>g</I>an&acirc;ni bhu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>itv&acirc;)&#151;wherein the 'food given out of faith' (saddh&acirc;deyya) either chiefly or exclusively means the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha dinners, which are so called because the sacrificer gives them 'full of faith' (<I>s</I>raddh&acirc;samanvita, Manu III, 275) to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and through them to the Manes.</p>  
<p>The principal form of <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha is that treated of in chap. 1, which is designated in other texts (see, for instance, &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 7, 1) as p&acirc;rva<I>n</I>a <I>s</I>r&acirc;ddha. There are, however, besides the parvan of the new moon, other times also considered as admissible for the performing of this monthly <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha; see Gautama XV, 2 seq.; &Acirc;pastamba II, 16, &amp;c.; and comp. on the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas in general the passages quoted by Professor Jolly, Das Dharma-s&ucirc;tra des Vish<I>n</I>u (Sitzung der Bair. Akademie, phil. Classe, 7 Juni, 1879), pp. 46 seq.; Max M&uuml;ller, 'India, what can it teach us?' pp. 234 Seq., 374 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_231"></A><A HREF="sbe29063.htm#fr_232">106:2</A> '"As the fathers" means: he invites the youngest, middle-aged, and eldest Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as to sit down in the place of the father, the grandfather, and the great-grandfather' (N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a). A similar explanation of pit<I>ri</I>vat is mentioned by N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a on &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya <A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A> IV, 7, 2. My German translation of this S&ucirc;tra ought to be altered accordingly.</p>  
<p>Besides the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as mentioned in this S&ucirc;tra, who represent the fathers, according to all the commentaries, other Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as had to be invited as representing the Vi<I>s</I>ve dev&acirc;s. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a gives detailed statements as to the number of the pait<I>ri</I>ka and of the daivika Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as to be invited, and though at first sight a European reader would rather be inclined to doubt whether at the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha ceremony, as the author of the text intended to describe it, any Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as at all had to be present except the pait<I>ri</I>kas, the S&ucirc;tra 2, 5 shows that the commentators are quite right in their statements regarding both categories of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_232"></A><A HREF="sbe29063.htm#fr_233">107:5-7</A> It would be more natural to alter the division of the S&ucirc;tras, so as to bring &acirc;mantrya in the fifth, anna<I>&ntilde;</I> <I>k</I>a in the seventh S&ucirc;tra. In this case we should have to translate: 5. After this, having (respectfully) spoken to them who have been adorned (by him with flowers, ornaments, &amp;c.); 6. And having put (food) into the fire, 7. And having assigned the food to them, &amp;c., he shall cause them to eat.&#151;The respectful address mentioned in the fifth S&ucirc;tra consists, according to N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, in the announcement, 'Ye Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, I will put (food) into the fire!' (comp. &Acirc;<I>s</I>v.-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 7, 18), which he subsequently does with the formulas, 'To Agni Kavyav&acirc;hana sv&acirc;h&acirc;! To Soma Pit<I>ri</I>mat sv&acirc;h&acirc;! To Yama A&#7749;girasvat Pit<I>ri</I>mat sv&acirc;h&acirc;!' Comp. Baudh&acirc;yana II, 1 4, 8.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_233"></A><A HREF="sbe29063.htm#fr_234">108:9</A> As to the way in which the Pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as should he offered, N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a refers to the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra (IV, 4).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_234"></A><A HREF="sbe29063.htm#fr_235">108:10-11</A> 10, 11. Pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;n evidently belongs to the tenth S&ucirc;tra, not, as the Indian tradition takes it, to the eleventh. Between the Pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as of the fathers and those belonging to the mothers he puts, according to N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, for instance, Darbha grass.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_235"></A><A HREF="sbe29063.htm#fr_236">108:13</A> <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra IV, 3 seq.</P>
