### Footnotes

<span id="fn_301"></span>[134:1](sbe29083.htm#fr_302) 2, 1 seq. Comp.
Â*s*valâyana-Pari*s*ish*t*a IV, 9.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[135:5](sbe29083.htm#fr_303) These are names of
Agni dwelling in the waters; see Pâraskara II, 6, 10; Mantrabrâhma*n*a
I, 7, 1. Several of the names are here misspelled; thus G*ri*hya,
Apag*ri*hya should be, no doubt, Gohya, Upagohya, which is the reading
given in Pâraskara, loc. cit.
