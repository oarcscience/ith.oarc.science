<P><A NAME="fn_142"></A><A HREF="sbe29036.htm#fr_143">67:1-2</A> 6, 1, 2. R&acirc;ma<I>k</I>andra: '. . . with this Mantra which the teacher tells him, and which he (the student) pronounces, he sips water <A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A> three times . . . He (the teacher) then gives him again the staff, which he had given him before silently.' I do not think that this double handing over of the staff agrees with the real meaning of the text; Gobhila also (II, 10) and &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana (I, 22, 1) prescribe the da<I>n</I><I>d</I>aprad&acirc;na after the repetition of the S&acirc;vitr&icirc;, without mentioning that the same had been already done before; P&acirc;raskara II, 2, II speaks of the handing over of the staff before the recital of the S&acirc;vitr&icirc;, and does not state that it should be repeated afterwards.</p>  
<p>All these ceremonies, the teaching of the S&acirc;vitr&icirc; as well as the da<I>n</I><I>d</I>aprad&acirc;na, were considered as forming part of the Upanayana, even though a longer or shorter space of time (chap. 5, 1-3) might elapse between the first arrival of the student at the teacher's house and the performing of these rites. This follows from chap. 11, S&ucirc;tras 2-4.</P>
