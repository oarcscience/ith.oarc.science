<P><A NAME="fn_562"></A><A HREF="sbe29144.htm#fr_563">233:11_2</A> The Svasti-&Acirc;treya is the part of the hymn V, 51, which very frequently contains the word svasti (vv. 11-15). There is a Khila appended to that hymn (Rig-veda, vol. iii, p. 30), which, according to N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, is also to be murmured on this occasion.</P>
