Should he run away (nevertheless, his master) should establish a fire that has been taken from a wood that is on fire, and should sacrifice (in that fire) Ku<I>s</I>a plates (used for protecting the hands when holding a hot sacrificial pan) that have been anointed with ghee, with (the formula), 'May the stumbler stumble round thee, . . . . may he tie thee with Indra's fetter, loosen thee for me, and may he lead another one up (to me).'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_894"></A><A HREF="sbe29197.htm#fr_895">351:7_3</A> Ukh&acirc; y&acirc;bhy&acirc;<I>m</I> g<I>ri</I>hyate t&acirc;v i<I>n</I><I>d</I>vau. Comm. on K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana, <I>S</I>raut. XVI, 4, 2.</p>  
<p>In the Mantra I propose to read, pari tv&acirc; hvalano, &amp;c. Niv<I>ri</I>ttendrav&icirc;rudha<I>h</I> seems to be corrupt; it seems to be a compound of niv<I>ri</I>tta, a second member which is doubtful, and v&icirc;rudh (the plant). The meaning may have been 'giving it up to consume the plants.'</P>
