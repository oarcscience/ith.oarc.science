### KHA*ND*A 11.

1 <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_168). Now (follows) the directing to
the (special) observances.

2 <span id="fr_170"></span>[2-4](#fn_169). The rules for it have been

3\. He does not recite the Sâvitrî.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

4 <span id="fr_171"></span>[4](#fn_170). Some say that the handing over
of the staff forms the end (of this ceremony).

5\. During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing
moon—

6 <span id="fr_172"></span>[6](#fn_171). The teacher having abstained
through one day and one night, from sexual intercourse and from eating
flesh—

7 <span id="fr_173"></span>[7](#fn_172). With the exclusion of the
fourteenth day and of the eighth (of the half-month),

8\. And of the first and last, according to some (teachers),

9 <span id="fr_174"></span>[9](#fn_173). Or on what day else the
constellation seems lucky to him, on that day he shall direct (the
student) to the duties of holiness according to the *S*ukriya rite.

10 <span id="fr_175"></span>[10](#fn_174). Let him observe (those)
duties through three days, or twelve days, or one year, or as long as
the master may think fit.

11\. The *S*âkvara (observance), however, (is to be kept) one year.

12\. (So also) the Vrâtika and Aupanishada (observances).

13 <span id="fr_176"></span>[13](#fn_175). When the time has elapsed,
when the duties

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

have been observed, when the Veda has been studied down to the
*S*a*m*yu-Bârhaspatya-(hymn), let (the teacher then), should he intend
to instruct (the student) in the secret (part of the Veda), ascertain
the time (through which the student has to observe the special rites)
and the rules to be observed, from the (special) directions (that are
handed down on this subject).

replying, "I will be a *S*ukriya-brahma*k*ârin." Thus also at the other
observances he shall pronounce each time the name of the observance to
which he directs him.'
