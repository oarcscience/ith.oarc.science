### ADHYÂYA V, KHA*ND*A 1.

1 <span id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_296). Now when he intends to set out
on a journey, he makes (his sacred) fire enter into himself, (or) into
the two kindling sticks, or into (an ordinary) log of wood,

2 <span id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_297). Once with (the text), 'Come,
enter into my Prâ*n*as,' twice silently.

3\. Or with (the verse), 'This is thy womb' (Rig-veda III, 29, to) he
warms the two kindling sticks,

4\. Or an (ordinary log of) wood.

5 <span id="fr_299"></span>[5](#fn_298). And before sunset the kindling
(by attrition),

6\. And at the time of the Vai*s*vadeva sacrifice.

7 <span id="fr_300"></span>[7](#fn_299). Having carried a common fire to
a place that has been smeared (with cowdung), which is elevated, and

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

which has been sprinkled (with water), he makes (the sacred fire)
redescend (from its receptacle, with the formula), 'Redescend!'

8 <span id="fr_301"></span>[8-9](#fn_300). If the fire goes out, he
sacrifices the two Sarvaprâya*sk*itta oblations (oblations for general
expiation) and (other oblations) with (the formulas), 'Protect us, Agni,
that we may prosper. Svâhâ! Protect us that we may obtain all wealth.
Svâhâ! The sacrifice protect, O resplendent one! Svâhâ! Protect
everything, O hundredfold wise one. Svâhâ!'

9\. In the case of a breach of his vow let him fast and sacrifice (an
oblation) of Â*g*ya with (the verse), 'Thou, Agni, art the lord of the
vow' (Rig-veda VIII, 11, 1).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_296"></span>[133:1](sbe29082.htm#fr_297) 1, 1. The ceremony
of Samâroha*n*a, by which the duties towards the sacred fire are
suspended, by causing the fire to 'enter' into the sacrificer's body, or
into the two Ara*n*is, or into another piece of wood, is already
mentioned in several passages of the Brâhma*n*a texts; comp. the
quotations given by Professor Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 3r 1. Comp.
besides Â*s*valâyana-*S*rauta-sûtra III 10; Sâṅkhâyana-*S*raut. II, 17.
The Samâroha*n*a into the sacrificer's own body is done by warming the
hands at the sacred fire; see Â*s*v., loc. cit., Sûtra 6. In the
Sâṅkhâyana-*S*rauta-sûtra the corresponding rule, which regards there of
course the Âhitâgni, runs thus, 'If he performs the Samâroha*n*a, he
warms his hands at the Gârhapatya fire, and then touches his Prâ*n*as
with the words, "Come, enter into my Prâ*n*as."' On the two other cases,
see the Sûtras 3 and 4. Sûtras 2, 3, 5 are taken word for word from the
*S*rauta-sûtra.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[133:2](sbe29082.htm#fr_298) This Sûtra refers
only to the case where he causes the fire to enter into himself.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[133:5](sbe29082.htm#fr_299) Comp. the
commentary on Â*s*v.-*S*raut., loc. cit. 8. He makes the fire redescend
from his body or from the Ara*n*is by performing the Manthana (kindling
the fire by attrition of the Ara*n*is).

<span id="fn_299"></span>[133:7](sbe29082.htm#fr_300) The Mantra alluded
to here is given in the *S*rauta-sûtra. It <span id="page_134">p.
134</span> runs thus, 'Redescend, O *G*âtavedas; carry again offerings
to the gods, knowing us. Long life, offspring, wealth bestow on us;
uninjured shine in our dwelling!'

<span id="fn_300"></span>[134:8-9](sbe29082.htm#fr_301) These Sûtras
stand in no connection with the Samâroha*n*a treated of before.

On the two Sarvaprâya*sk*itta oblations see above, I, 9, 12 and the note
there.

The vow spoken of in Sûtra 9 Nârâya*n*a refers to the restrictions
regarding the food which the sacrificer and his wife are to eat on the
Upavasatha days, connected with the festivals of the full and new moon.
