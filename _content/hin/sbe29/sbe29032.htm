<P><A NAME="fn_129"></A><A HREF="sbe29032.htm#fr_130">62:6-7</A> 6, 7. A similar dialogue between the teacher and the student at the Upanayana is given in the Kau<I>s</I>ika-s&ucirc;tra (ap. Weber, Indische Studien, X, 71). The student there says, 'Make me an &Acirc;rsheya (a descendant of the <I>Ri</I>shis) and one who has relations, and initiate me.' And the teacher replies, 'I make thee an &Acirc;rsheya and one who has relations, and I initiate thee.' As in this passage of the Kau<I>s</I>ika-s&ucirc;tra the teacher is represented as having the power of making, by the Upanayana ceremony, an &Acirc;rsheya of the student, thus, according to the view expressed by Professor Weber (loc. cit., p. 72 seq.), <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana would even give it into the teacher's power to make the student his sam&acirc;n&acirc;rsheya, i.e. to extend his own &Acirc;rsheya on as many pupils as he likes. Professor Weber understands the sixth S&ucirc;tra so that the teacher would have to say, sam&acirc;n&acirc;rsheyo bhav&acirc;n br&ucirc;hi (N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: bhav&acirc;n br&ucirc;h&icirc;ti brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;r&icirc; bhav&acirc;n br&ucirc;h&icirc;ty ata<I>h</I> [S&ucirc;tra 8] si<I>m</I>h&acirc;valokanany&acirc;yen&acirc;tr&acirc;nusha<I>g</I>yate. According to R&acirc;ma<I>k</I>andra's Paddhati he is <A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A> only to say sam&acirc;n&acirc;rsheya<I>h</I>). The student answers, sam&acirc;n&acirc;rsheyo &#146;ham bho; Professor Weber, who supplies the imperative as&acirc;ni, translates this, 'May I have the same &Acirc;rsheya, sir!'</p>  
<p>I think it more natural to simply translate the teacher's question, 'Art thou sam&acirc;n&acirc;rsheya?' (or, supplying bhav&acirc;n br&ucirc;hi from S&ucirc;tra 8, 'Declare that thou art sam&acirc;n&acirc;rsheya'), and the student's reply, I am sam&acirc;n&acirc;rsheya, sir!' Thus we ought possibly to consider these formulas, which state a fictitious, ideal sam&acirc;n&acirc;rsheyatva of the teacher and the students as a trace, and as far as I can see as the only trace, of an ancient rule requiring a real sam&acirc;n&acirc;rsheyatva of teacher and student. As long as the ritual differences between the different Gotras, of which, as is well known, only a few traces have survived in the Vedic tradition, had retained their full importance, it can indeed scarcely have been considered as admissible that a young Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a should be confided to the guidance of a teacher who sacrificed and invoked the gods in another way than the customs of the pupil's own family required.</P>
