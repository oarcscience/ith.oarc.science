### KHA*ND*A 14.

1\. 'This woman, strewing grains, prays thus, "May I bring bliss to my
relations; may my husband live long. Svâhâ!"'—while the husband murmurs
(this) text, she sacrifices standing.

2 <span id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_81). (All the ceremonies,) beginning
from the treading

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

upon the stone, (are repeated) in the same way for a second time,

3\. And in the same way a third time.

4\. Silently, if they like, a fourth time.

5 <span id="fr_83"></span>[5](#fn_82). (The Â*k*ârya?) makes (them) step
forward in a north-eastern direction seven steps (with the words),

6\. 'For sap with one step, for juice with two steps, for the prospering
of wealth with three steps, for comfort with four steps, for cattle with
five steps, for the seasons with six steps. Friend be with seven steps.'

7\. (The Â*k*ârya?) 'appeases' those (foot-steps) with water.

8 <span id="fr_84"></span>[8](#fn_83). With the three Âpohish*th*îyâ
verses (Rig-veda X, 9, 1-3) he wipes (them) with the Stheyâ water,

9 <span id="fr_85"></span>[9](#fn_84). And sprinkles it on their heads.

10\. (The bridegroom then) says, 'I give you a cow.'

11\. Let him give something to the Brâhma*n*as each time at the
Sthâlîpâkas and other rites;

12 <span id="fr_86"></span>[12](#fn_85). To him who knows the Sûryâ hymn
the bride's shift.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

13 <span id="fr_87"></span>[13-15](#fn_86). A cow is the optional gift
to be given by a Brâhma*n*a,

14\. A village by a Râ*g*anya,

15\. A horse by a Vai*s*ya.

16 <span id="fr_88"></span>[16](#fn_87). A hundred (cows) with a chariot
(he gives to a father) who has only daughters.

17\. To those versed in the sacrificial rites he gives a horse.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_81"></span>[37:2](sbe29016.htm#fr_82) 14, 2. The treading
on the stone is prescribed in chap. 13, 12.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[38:5](sbe29016.htm#fr_83) 5, 7. According to
Nârâya*n*a it is the teacher who makes them walk the seven steps; the
Paddhati says that the bridegroom or the Â*k*ârya causes her to do so.
Comp. Pâraskara I, 8, 1; Â*s*valâyana I, 7, 19, &c.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[38:8](sbe29016.htm#fr_84) Comp. chap. 13, 9.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[38:9](sbe29016.htm#fr_85) Probably we should
read mûrdhanî (acc. dual.), not mûrdhani. Â*s*valâyana has *s*irasî. Of
course the heads of both the bridegroom and the bride were sprinkled
with water; comp. Â*s*valâyana I, 7, 20, &c.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[38:12](sbe29016.htm#fr_86) The Sûryâ hymn is
Rig-veda X, 85. Comp. the note above on chap. 13, 4.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[39:13-15](sbe29016.htm#fr_87) These Sûtras,
treating of the fee for the sacrifice, are identical with Pâraskara I,
8, 15-18. Apparently they are taken from the same lost original from
which several identical passages in the Sûtras of Pâraskara and
*S*âṅkhâyana seem to be derived (see the notes on chap. 5, 1; 13, 7).
They stand rather out of place here, for they return to the same subject
which had already been treated of in Sûtra 10, though in that Sûtra, as
very frequently is the case in our text and in similar ones, only the
case of the bridegroom being a Brâhma*n*a has been taken notice of.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[39:16](sbe29016.htm#fr_88) Comp. the passages
quoted by Professor Stenzler on Pâraskara I, 8, 18. Nârâya*n*a has the
following note: 'To a duhit*ri*mat, i.e. to the father of a girl who has
no brother, he shall give a hundred cows and besides a chariot, in order
to destroy the guilt brought about by marrying a girl who has no
brother.' Possibly we should here emancipate ourselves from the
authority of the commentators, and explain duhit*ri*mat 'he who gives
his daughter in marriage,' the bride's father. Comp. Âpastamba II, 11,
18; II, 13, 12; Weber, Indische Studien, V, 343, note 2.
