### KA*ND*IKÂ 15.

1 <span id="fr_442"></span>[1](#fn_441). When a son has been born, (the
father) should, before other people touch him, give him to eat from gold
(i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon) butter and honey with
which he has ground gold(-dust), with (the verse), 'I administer to thee
the wisdom ('veda') of honey, of ghee, raised by Savit*ri* the
bountiful. Long-living, protected by the gods, live a hundred autumns in
this world!'

2\. Approaching (his mouth) to (the child's) two ears he murmurs the
'production of intelligence:' 'Intelligence may give to thee god
Savit*ri*, intelligence may goddess Sarasvatî, intelligence may give to
thee the two divine A*s*vins, wreathed with lotus.'

3 <span id="fr_443"></span>[3](#fn_442). He touches (the child's) two
shoulders with (the verse), 'Be a stone, be an axe, be insuperable gold.
Thou indeed art the Veda, called son; so live a hundred autumns'—and
with (the verses), 'Indra, give the best treasures' (Rig-veda II, 21,
6), Bestow on us, O bountiful one, O speedy one' (Rig-veda III, 36, 10).

4\. And let them give him a name beginning with

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

a sonant, with a semivowel in it, with the Visarga at its end,
consisting of two syllables,

5\. Or of four syllables;

6\. Of two syllables, if he is desirous of firm position; of four
syllables, if he is desirous of holy lustre;

7\. But in every case with an even number (of syllables) for men, an
uneven for women.

8\. And let him also find out (for the child) a name to be used at
respectful salutations (such as that due to the Â*k*ârya at the ceremony
of the initiation); that his mother and his father (alone) should know
till his initiation.

9\. When he returns from a journey, he embraces his son's head and
murmurs, 'From limb by limb thou art produced; out of the heart thou art
born. Thou indeed art the self called son; so live a hundred
autumns!'—(thus) he kisses him three times on his head.

10\. The rite only (without the Mantra is performed) for a girl.
