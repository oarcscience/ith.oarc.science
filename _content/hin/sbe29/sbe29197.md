### KA*ND*IKÂ 7.

1 <span id="fr_894"></span>[1](#fn_893). (Now will be declared) the
making water round about a servant who is disposed to run away.

2\. While (the servant) is sleeping, he should discharge his urine into
the horn of a living animal, and should three times walk round him,
turning his left side towards him, and sprinkle (the urine) round him,

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

with (the verse), 'From the mountain (on which thou art born), from thy
mother, from thy sister, from thy parents and thy brothers, from thy
friends I sever thee.

'Run-away servant, I have made water round thee. Having been watered
round, where wilt thou go?'

3 <span id="fr_895"></span>[7\_3](#fn_894). Should he run away
(nevertheless, his master) should establish a fire that has been taken
from a wood that is on fire, and should sacrifice (in that fire) Ku*s*a
plates (used for protecting the hands when holding a hot sacrificial
pan) that have been anointed with ghee, with (the formula), 'May the
stumbler stumble round thee, . . . . may he tie thee with Indra's
fetter, loosen thee for me, and may he lead another one up (to me).'

4 <span id="fr_896"></span>[4](#fn_895). Then he will quietly remain (in
his master's house).

Utûla-parimeha*h*. It is probable that utûla, as meaning a slave who
habitually runs away, is connected with the use of that word as the name
of a tribe in the north-west of India.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[351:7\_3](sbe29197.htm#fr_895) Ukhâ yâbhyâ*m*
g*ri*hyate tâv i*nd*vau. Comm. on Kâtyâyana, *S*raut. XVI, 4, 2.

In the Mantra I propose to read, pari tvâ hvalano, &c.
Niv*ri*ttendravîrudha*h* seems to be corrupt; it seems to be a compound
of niv*ri*tta, a second member which is doubtful, and vîrudh (the
plant). The meaning may have been 'giving it up to consume the plants.'

<span id="fn_895"></span>[351:4](sbe29197.htm#fr_896) This Sûtra is word
for word identical with chap. 6, 4.
