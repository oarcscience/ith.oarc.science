Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 15.

1 <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_193). Should any one of the six
persons (mentioned in the *S*rauta-sûtra and in the Sûtras 4-9) to whom
the Arghya reception is due, visit (him), let him make (ready) a cow, a
goat, or what (sort of food) he thinks most like (thereto).

2 <span id="fr_195"></span>[2-3](#fn_194). Let the Argha not be without
flesh.

3\. On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say,
'Make it (ready).'

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

4\. The animal (offered) to the teacher is sacred to Agni;

5\. If offered to an officiating priest, to B*ri*haspati;

6 <span id="fr_196"></span>[6](#fn_195). If to the father-in-law, to
Pra*g*âpati;

7\. If to a king, to Indra;

8 <span id="fr_197"></span>[8](#fn_196). If to a friend, to Mitra;

9\. If to a Snâtaka, to Indra and Agni;

10\. Even if he performs more than one Soma sacrifice during a year, let
only priests who have received (from him) the Arghya reception officiate
for him, not such who have not received it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_193"></span>[87:1](sbe29045.htm#fr_194) 15, 1. This Sûtra
presupposes the *S*rauta-sûtra IV, 21, 1: 'To six persons the Argha
reception is due, viz. to the teacher, to an officiating priest, to the
father-in-law, to a king, to a Snâtaka, to a friend.' Here the fourth
person mentioned is the *s*va*s*ura, while in the G*ri*hya text the
expression vaivâhya is used. It is difficult not to believe that both
words are used in the same sense, and accordingly Nârâya*n*a says
vivâhya*h* *s*va*s*ura*h*. Comp. Professor Stenzler's note on Pâraskara
I, 3, 1; Âpastamba II, 8, 7; Gautama V, 27.

Sâmânyatama*m* sad*ris*atama*m* mâshâdikam (mâkhâdikam the MS.) annam.
Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[87:2-3](sbe29045.htm#fr_195) 2, 3. These
Sûtras are identical with Pâraskara I, 3, 29. 30. The following Sûtra of
Pâraskara stands in the *S*âṅkhâyana text as <span id="page_88">p.
88</span> Sûtra 10. Probably Pâraskara here represents the text which
both Sûtrakâras follow, more exactly, and the enumeration given by
*S*âṅkhâyana in Sûtras 4-9 of the different categories of Arghyas with
the corresponding deities, is an addition to that original stock of
rules.

Apparently the two Sûtras 2 and 3 stand in contradiction to each other,
as Sûtra 2 seems to prescribe that at the Argha meal in every case flesh
should be given to the guest, and Sûtra 3 specifies only two occasions
on which the killing of the Argha cow cannot be dispensed with. Perhaps
the meaning is this, that it is not necessary, except in the cases of a
sacrifice and of a wedding, to kill a cow expressly for that purpose,
but that in any case, even if the cow offered to the guest be declined
by him, the host should take care that some flesh be served at that
meal. So says Nârâya*n*a in his note on Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 24, 33,
'Pa*s*ukara*n*apakshe tanmâ*m*sena bho*g*anam, utsar*g*anapakshe
mâ*m*santare*n*a.' Similarly the Buddhists distinguish between eating
flesh and eating the flesh of an animal expressly killed in order to
entertain that very guest.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[88:6](sbe29045.htm#fr_196) The literal
translation of vaivâhya would be 'a person related by marriage.' But
comp. the note on Sûtra 1.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[88:8](sbe29045.htm#fr_197) Priya of course
does not mean *g*âmâtar, as is stated in a number of commentaries.
Gobhila says, priyo<sup>ऽ</sup>tithi*h*.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[88:11](sbe29045.htm#fr_198) Other persons, for
instance a king, can claim the Argha reception not more than once a
year. Comp. Âpastamba II, 8, 7; Gautama V, 28, 29, &c.
