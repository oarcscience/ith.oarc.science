### Footnotes

<span id="fn_282"></span>[125:5](sbe29074.htm#fr_283) 12, 5. Nârâya*n*a:
'As to how that respectful salutation (abhivâdana) should he performed,
he says . . . with his own right hand he touches the right foot of the
Â*k*ârya or other person (whom he salutes), and with his left hand the
left foot (comp. Manu II, 72) (and says), "I am N.N. (amuka*s*arman) of
the Gotra N.N., sir! I offer my respectful salutation!"'

<span id="fn_283"></span>[125:6](sbe29074.htm#fr_284) 'The Â*k*ârya or
other person seizes the hands of the saluting person,' &c. Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[125:10](sbe29074.htm#fr_285) See Nârâya*n*a's
commentary, p. 154 of the German edition.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[126:16](sbe29074.htm#fr_286) According to
Nârâya*n*a we should have to supply, 'while it is raining,' which is
countenanced by a number of parallel texts, for instance,
Â*s*v.-G*ri*hya III, 9, 6.
