### KA*ND*IKÂ 10.

1\. Now (follows) the Adhyâyopâkarman (or opening ceremony at the
beginning of the annual course of study).

2 <span id="fr_822"></span>[2](#fn_821). When the herbs appear, (when
the moon stands in conjunction) with *S*rava*n*a, on the full-moon day
of the *S*râva*n*a month, or on the fifth (Tithi) of the *S*râva*n*a
month under (the Nakshatra) Hasta;

3\. Having sacrificed the two Â*g*ya portions, he offers two Â*g*ya
oblations, (namely,)

4\. To the Earth and to Agni, if (he studies) the Rig-veda,

5\. To the Air and to Vâyu, if the Ya*g*ur-veda,

6\. To the Heaven and to the Sun, if the Sâma-veda,

7\. To the quarters (of the horizon) and to the Moon, if the
Atharva-veda;

8\. (Besides) to the Brahman, to the metres in every case,

9\. And to Pra*g*âpati, to the gods, to the *Ri*shis, to Faith, to
Insight, to Sadasaspati, to Anumati.

10 <span id="fr_823"></span>[10](#fn_822). The same (oblations are made)
when the

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

observances are imposed (on a student) or given up (by him, after having
been kept through the prescribed period of time).

11\. With (the verse), 'Sadasaspati' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXXII, 13) (the
teacher) three times (sacrifices) fried grains.

12\. All should repeat (that verse after him).

13\. After each oblation they should each time put on the fire three
pieces of Udumbara wood, fresh branches with leaves, anointed with ghee,
reciting the Sâvitrî.

14 <span id="fr_824"></span>[14](#fn_823). And the students (should put
wood on the fire) in the manner stated above.

15\. With (the verse), 'Luck may bring us' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. IX, 16) they
should eat the fried grains without chewing them.

16\. With the verse, 'Of Dadhikrâvan' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXIII, 32) they
should eat curds.

17 <span id="fr_825"></span>[17](#fn_824). As many pupils as he wishes
to obtain, so many sesamum grains should he sacrifice with a dice-board,
with the Sâvitrî or with the Anuvâka, 'Bright-resplending' (Vâ*g*.
Sa*m*h. XVII, 80 seqq.).

18 <span id="fr_826"></span>[18](#fn_825). After they have eaten (the
remainder of the sacrificial food, the teacher) should pronounce the
word Om and then repeat the Sâvitrî three times, and the beginnings of
the Adhyâyas to (the students) who are seated facing the west;

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

19\. The beginnings of the sections belonging to the (different)
*Ri*shis, if they are Bahv*rik*as (i.e. if they study the *Ri*g-Veda),

20 <span id="fr_827"></span>[20](#fn_826). The Parvans, if they are
*Kh*andogas (i.e. if they study the Sâma-veda),

21\. The Sûktas, if they are Atharvans.

22\. All murmur: 'May it be ours in common; may it bless us in common;
may this Brahman be powerful with us together. Indra knows that through
which, and in which way, no hatred may spring up amongst us.'

23\. Through a period of three nights they should not study (the Veda).

24\. And they should not cut the hair of their bodies and their nails.

25\. Some say (that this should not be done) till the Utsarga (i.e. the
concluding ceremony of the annual course of study).
