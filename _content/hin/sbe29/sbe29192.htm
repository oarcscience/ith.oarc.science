<p>1. On the full-moon day of M&acirc;rga<I>s</I>&icirc;rsha the &Acirc;grah&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc; ceremony (is performed).</p>  
<p>2&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_871"></A><A HREF="#fn_870"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. He cooks a mess of sacrificial food, sacrifices two &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya oblations as at the <I>S</I>rava<I>n</I>&acirc; sacrifice, and other oblations with (the following verses):</p>  
<p>'The night whom men welcome like a cow that comes to them, (the night) which is the consort of the year, may that (night) be auspicious to us. Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'The night which is the image of the year, that we worship. May I reach old age, imparting strength to my offspring. Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!</p>  
<p>'To the Sa<I>m</I>vatsara, to the Parivatsara, to the Id&acirc;vatsara, to the Id&acirc;vatsara, to the Vatsara bring ye great adoration. May we, undecayed, unbeaten, long enjoy the favour of these (years) which are worthy of sacrifices. Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!</p>  
<p>'May summer, winter and spring, the rains be friendly, and may autumn be free of danger to us. In the safe protection of these seasons may we dwell, (and) may (they) last (to us) through a hundred years. Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'</p>  
<p>3. He makes oblations of the cooked food to Soma, to (the Nakshatra) M<I>ri</I>ga<I>s</I>iras, to the full moon of M&acirc;rga<I>s</I>&icirc;rsha, and to the winter.</p>  
<p>4&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_872"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. After he has eaten (of the sacrificial food), he throws the remainder of the flour into a basket, (and then follow the same rites that have been stated above) from (the sacrificer's) going out down to their cleaning themselves.</p>  
<p>5. After the cleaning he says, 'The Bali offering is finished.'</p>

<p>not yet been washed, they 'redescend,' having bathed, wearing garments which have not yet been washed: the master (of the house) southward, his wife to the north (of her husband, and then the other persons belonging to the house) so that each younger one lies more to the north.</p>  
<p>7. Having caused the Brahman to sit down southward, and having placed to the north a water-pot, a <I>S</I>am&icirc; branch, an earth-clod taken out of a furrow, and a stone, he murmurs, looking at the fire: 'This Agni is most valiant, he is most blessed, the best giver of a thousand boons, highly powerful. May he establish us both in the highest place.'</p>  
<p>8. To the west of the fire he joins his hands (and holds them) towards the east.</p>  
<p>9. With the three (verses), 'The divine ship' (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. Sa<I>m</I>h. XXI, 6-8) they ascend the layer (of straw).</p>  
<p>10&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_874"></A><A HREF="#fn_873"><FONT SIZE="1">10-11</FONT></A>. He addresses the Brahman: 'Brahman, we will redescend.'</p>  
<p>11. The Brahman having given his permission, they redescend with (the words), 'Life, fame, glory, strength, enjoyment of food, offspring!'</p>  
<p>12&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_875"></A><A HREF="#fn_874"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>. Those who have received the initiation murmur, 'May a good winter, a good spring, a good summer be bestowed on us. Blessed may be to us the rains; may the autumns be blessed to us.'</p>  
<p>13. With (the verse), 'Be soft to us, O earth' (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. Sa<I>m</I>h. XXXV, 21), they lie down on their right sides, their heads turned towards the east.</p>

<p>15. This (they repeat) two other times, with the Brahman's permission.</p>  
<p>16. Let them sleep on the ground four months (after the Pratyavaroha<I>n</I>a), or as long as they like.</p>
