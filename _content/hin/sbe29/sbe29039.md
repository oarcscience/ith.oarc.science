Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 9.

1 <span id="fr_164"></span>[9\_1](#fn_163). In the forest, with a piece
of wood in his hand, seated, he performs the Sandhyâ (or twilight
devotion) constantly, observing silence, turning his face north-west, to
the region between the chief (west) point and the intermediate
(north-western) point (of the horizon), until the stars appear,

2 <span id="fr_165"></span>[9\_2](#fn_164). Murmuring, when (the
twilight) has passed, the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, the Sâvitrî, and the
auspicious hymns.

3\. In the same way in the morning, turning his face to the east,
standing, until the disk of the sun appears.

10, 1 <span id="fr_166"></span>[10\_1](#fn_165). When (the sun) has
risen, the study (of the Veda) goes on.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_163"></span>[74:9\_1](sbe29039.htm#fr_164) 9, 1, On the
Sandhyâ ceremony comp chiefly Baudhâyana II, 7. Samitpâ*n*i of course is
not sa*m*yatapâ*n*i, as Nârâya*n*a explains it. On anvash*t*amade*s*a
comp. Professor Stenzler's note on Â*s*valâyana III, 7, 4.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[74:9\_2](sbe29039.htm#fr_165) The Svastyayanas
are texts such as Rig-veda I, 89; IV, 31.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[74:10\_1](sbe29039.htm#fr_166) 10, 1. This
Sûtra evidently should be placed at the end of the ninth chapter; comp.
IV, 6, 9. The fact that, as the commentary observes, the words nitya*m*
vâgyata*h* (chap. 9, Sûtra 1) are to be <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>
supplied here also points in the same direction. That this Sûtra has
nothing to do with the Agnipari*k*aryâ, of which the tenth chapter
treats, becomes evident also from Râma*k*andra's Paddhati.
