<P><A NAME="fn_176"></A><A HREF="sbe29042.htm#fr_177">78:1</A> 12, 1 seq. The Indian tradition (with the exception only, as far as is known to me, of the <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya commentary) refers the ceremonies described in this chapter, like those treated of in chap. 11, as well to the <I>S</I>ukriya as to the <I>S</I>&acirc;kvara and the other Vratas. This is not correct. The eleventh chapter gives the rites common to the four Vratas; the <I>S</I>ukriya vrata is connected with no special ceremonies beside those, so that the exposition of this Vrata is brought to an end in that chapter. The last S&ucirc;tra of chap. 11 marks the transition to the special rites which are peculiar to the three other Vratas, and are connected with the character of mystical secrecy attributed to the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, and thus it is with the exclusion of the Sukriya that the twelfth chapter refers only to those Vratas. The difference which we have pointed out between the two chapters finds its characteristic expression in S&ucirc;tras 9 and 11 of chap. 11, compared with chap. 12, 13. 14; in the former S&ucirc;tras the statements there given are expressly extended to the Sukriya, the <I>S</I>&acirc;kvara, the Vr&acirc;tika, and the Aupanishada, while in the latter passage mention is made first of the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc;s, i.e. the text corresponding to the <I>S</I>&acirc;kvara vrata, and then the uttar&acirc;<I>n</I>i prakara<I>n</I>&acirc;ni (the following sections) are referred to, i.e. the Mah&acirc;vrata and the Upanishad, so that the Sukriya vrata or the texts, the study of which is entered upon by that Vrata, are left out here.</p>  
<p>There is a good deal of confusion in the several commentaries <A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A> with regard to the succession of the different ceremonies taught in this chapter. They all agree in stating that after the lapse of the year through which the Vrata is kept, a ceremony is performed called Udd&icirc;ksha<I>n</I>ik&acirc;, i.e. the giving up of the D&icirc;ksh&acirc;, or preparatory observance. This Udd&icirc;ksha<I>n</I>ik&acirc; consists chiefly in the teacher's ascertaining whether the student has fulfilled the duties involved by the Vrata (see S&ucirc;tras 2 and 3). Besides that, there is no doubt that a repetition of the Upanayana (chap. 11, 2) also formed part of the preparatory rites for the study of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka. As to the way in which these different ceremonies and the other rites described in this chapter would have to be arranged according to our text, it is perhaps best to follow the statements given in an epitome from the b&acirc;l&acirc;vabodhan&acirc;rtham <I>Ri</I>shidaivata<I>kh</I>andopaddhati (MS. Berol. Chambers, 199 a, fols. 13-16); the slight confusion therein is not difficult to get rid of. There we read, 'The <I>S</I>&acirc;kvara, however, is to be kept one year (chap. 11, 11). When the Udd&icirc;ksha<I>n</I>ik&acirc; has been performed, and three nights (chap. 12, 6) or one day and one night (ibid. 7) have elapsed, the Upanayana should be performed as above (chap. 11, 2), with this difference that at the end of the formula mama vrate, &amp;c. (chap. 4, 1) one should say, "May B<I>ri</I>haspati join thee to me for the holy observance of the <I>S</I>&acirc;kvara through one year, O Devadatta!" (On this formula, resting on a misunderstanding of chap. 4, S&ucirc;tra 2, see the Introduction, p. 8.) The rest is the same as at the <I>S</I>ukriya. Then, when the year (chap. 11, 11) has elapsed, and the Udd&icirc;ksha<I>n</I>ik&acirc; has been performed, and the three days or the night have passed (chap. 12, 6. 7), he should go out of the village . . . and in the north-eastern direction,' &amp;c. (here follows the description of how the secret doctrines should be taught to the student, according to <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh. VI). The confusion showing itself in the double mention of the Udd&icirc;ksha<I>n</I>ik&acirc;, before and after the Upanayana, should no doubt be put to the account of the excerptor or perhaps even of the MS.; what the meaning of the original Paddhati was is sufficiently shown in the remarks on the following Vratas, for instance, on the Vr&acirc;tika (fol. 16), 'Now follows the Vr&acirc;tika vrata. It lasts one year (chap. <A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A> 11, 12). When the <I>S</I>&acirc;kvara has reached its end [here we find added at the margin of the MS.," After the Udd&icirc;ksha<I>n</I>ik&acirc; has been performed." These words ought not to be received into the text; in the corresponding passage on the Aupanishada vrata they are not found] he performs the whole ceremony, beginning from the smearing (of the Stha<I>n</I><I>d</I>ila with cow-dung), the drawing of the lines, &amp;c., as at the Upanayana . . . and then, when one year has elapsed, he performs the Udd&icirc;ksha<I>n</I>ik&acirc;, and the rules [given in chap. 12, 9 seq.] are observed as above.' I think that here the meaning of the text is correctly represented; first comes the Upanayana, then follows the Vrata lasting one year, then the Udd&icirc;ksha<I>n</I>ik&acirc;. After this ceremony the teacher gives to the student the directions mentioned in chap. 12, 16; then follow the three days, or the one night (chap. 12, 6. 7), and finally they both go out of the village to the north-east, and in the forest they recite the Rahasya.</p>  
<p>On the whole ceremonies connected with the study of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka the sixth book should be compared.</P>

The translation of the last words of this S&ucirc;tra (sarv&acirc;<I>n</I>i <I>k</I>a <I>s</I>avar&ucirc;p&acirc;<I>n</I>i y&acirc;ny &acirc;sye na [or &acirc;syena?] pravi<I>s</I>eyu<I>h</I> svasya v&acirc;s&acirc;n nirasan) is absolutely uncertain. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a says that such animals as lions, serpents, &amp;c. are designated in common use as <I>s</I>avar&ucirc;p&acirc;<I>n</I>i. (This literally means, 'having the form of a corpse.' Immediately afterwards N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a gives a nearly identical explanation of <I>s</I>avar&ucirc;pa as different from the one stated first. So perhaps we may conjecture that his first explanation rests on a reading sarpar&ucirc;p&acirc;<I>n</I>i; comp. the reading sarvar&ucirc;pa of P&acirc;raskara.) Of these the animals entering their dwelling-places with the mouth first (&acirc;syena) are to be understood here as forming, when looked at, an impediment for the study. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a then says that other authorities understand <I>s</I>ava in the sense of a dead human body; then <I>s</I>avar&ucirc;p&acirc;<I>n</I>i are beings having the form thereof (tadr&ucirc;p&acirc;<I>n</I>i), such as dogs, jackals, &amp;c. The words y&acirc;ny &acirc;syena pravi<I>s</I>eyu<I>h</I> signify that the study is impeded also on the sight of lions, tigers, &amp;c.; for these enter their dwelling-places with their faces first (? anumukhai<I>h</I> k<I>ri</I>tv&acirc;). The words svasya v&acirc;s&acirc;n nirasan mean, <A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A> according to N&acirc;r., 'when he&#151;i.e. the teacher&#151;goes out of his dwelling-place.' R&acirc;ma<I>k</I>andra says that <I>s</I>avar&ucirc;pa either means lions, snakes, and other dangerous animals, or nails, horns, and other such things that fall off or are severed from the body. The text of the <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya MS. is sarv&acirc;<I>n</I>i <I>k</I>a <I>s</I>y&acirc;mar&ucirc;p&acirc;<I>n</I>i y&acirc;v&acirc;ny&acirc; (?) pravi<I>s</I>eyu<I>h</I>, which the commentary explains, sarv&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I> <I>k</I>a bhakshyavarg&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I> <I>k</I>a. I think there can be little doubt that the text of <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana is correct (except that some doubt will remain as to &acirc;syena or &acirc;sye na), the more so as the passage reoccurs, nearly identically, below at VI, 1, 4. 5. As to the translation we can only go so far as to venture the opinion that the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana text does not admit the interpretation given by <I>G</I>ayar&acirc;ma, and accepted by Professor Stenzler (who compares &Acirc;pastamba I, 11, 27; Gautama XVI, 41) in P&acirc;raskara II, 11, 3 for sarvar&ucirc;pa, which consequently should, in our opinion, be rejected also in that passage of P&acirc;raskara. For ascertaining the true meaning of <I>s</I>avar&ucirc;pa we shall have to wait until new parallel passages have been discovered.</P>
