<p>1&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 'A bull's hide'&#151;this has been declared.</p>  
<p>2&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. On that hide the husband makes her sit down and sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, four oblations (with the following formulas),</p>  
<p>3. 'With god Agni, with the earth-world of the worlds, and the Rig-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., sv&acirc;h&acirc;!</p>  
<p>'With god V&acirc;yu, with the air-world of the worlds,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., sv&acirc;h&acirc;!</p>  
<p>'With god S&ucirc;rya, with the heaven-world of the worlds, with the S&acirc;ma-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., sv&acirc;h&acirc;!</p>  
<p>'With god <I>K</I>andra, with the world of the quarters (of the horizon) of the worlds, with the Brahma-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'</p>  
<p>4. Or, 'Bh&ucirc;<I>h</I>! What harm dwells in thee, bringing death to thy husband, death to thy husband's brother, that I make death-bringing to thy paramour, N.N., sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'&#151;thus the first (of the before-mentioned formulas) may be joined with the first Mah&acirc;vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>ti, the second with the second, the third with the third, the fourth with (the three Mah&acirc;vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis) together.</p>  
<p>5. With (the verse), 'With no evil eye' (Rig-veda X, 85, 44), let him besmear (her) eyes with &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya salve.</p>  
<p>6. (The bridegroom,) having touched the ends of her hair with the three (verses), 'How may us the resplendent one . . .' (Rig-veda IV, 31, 1-3),</p>  
<p>7. And having quickly recited the four verses, 'And those divine medicines' (Rig-veda VIII, 18, 8), at the end (of that text) with the word sv&acirc;h&acirc; (pours out) the remainder on (her) head.</p>  
<p>8&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>. Here some place a boy of good birth on both sides, in her lap, with this (verse), 'Into thy womb' (see below, chap. 19, 6),</p>  
<p>

<p>9. Or also silently.</p>  
<p>10. Into this (boy's) joined hands (the bridegroom) gives fruits and causes (the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as) to wish an auspicious day.</p>  
<p>11. Thus she becomes the mother of male children.</p>  
<p>12. With the rest of the hymn, 'Stay ye here both' (Rig-veda X, 85, 42 seq.), they make them enter the house.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_90"></A><A HREF="sbe29018.htm#fr_91">41:1</A> 16, 1. In chap. 15, 22 it is said that the bride arrives at the house; in 16, 12, that she enters the house. Probably we are to understand, therefore, that the sacrifice prescribed in this chapter, S&ucirc;tras 2 seq., is performed before the house, like the V&acirc;stoshpat&icirc;ya karman (below, III, 4). The words, 'has been declared,' refer to the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra (IV, r6, 2), 'Having spread a red bull's skin, with the neck to the north or to the east, with the hair outside, behind the fire, they sit down,' &amp;c.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_92"></A><A HREF="sbe29018.htm#fr_93">42:8</A> It should be noted that the verse &acirc; te yonim is quoted here only with the Pratika, while its full text is given below, chap. 19, 6. Can the S&ucirc;tras describing this ceremony with the kum&acirc;ra ubhayata<I>h</I>-su<I>g</I>&acirc;ta be a later addition?</P>
