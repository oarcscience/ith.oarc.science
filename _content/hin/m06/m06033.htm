<p>"The Holy One said, 'Now I will tell thee that art without envy that most mysterious knowledge along with experience, knowing which thou wilt be freed from evil. This is royal science, a royal mystery, highly cleansing, directly apprehensible, consistent with the sacred laws, easy to practise, (and) imperishable. Those persons, O chastiser of foes, who have no faith in this sacred doctrine, not attaining to me, return to the path of this world that is subject to destruction. This entire universe is pervaded by me in my unmanifest form. All entities are in me, but I do not reside in them. Nor yet are all entities in me. Behold my divine power. Supporting all entities and producing all entities, myself doth not (yet) reside in (those) entities. As the great and obiquitious atmosphere always occupieth space, understand that all entities reside in me in the same way.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> All entities, O son of Kunti, attain to my nature at the close of a <i>Kalpa</i>. I create them again at the beginning of a <i>Kalpa</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Regulating my own (independent) nature I create again and in this whole assemblage of entities which is plastic in consequence of its subjection to nature.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Those acts, however, O Dhananjaya, do not fetter me who sitteth as one unconcerned, being unattached to those acts (of creation). Through me, the overlooker, primal nature produceth the (universe of) mobiles and immobiles. For the reason, O son of Kunti, the universe passeth through its rounds (of birth and destruction).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Not knowing my supreme nature of the great lord of all entities, ignorant people of vain hopes, vain acts, vain knowledge, confounded minds, wedded to the delusive nature of <i>Asuras</i> and <i>Rakshasas</i>, disregard me (as one) that hath assumed a human body. But high-souled ones, O son of Pritha, possessed of divine nature, and with minds directed to nothing else, worship me, knowing (me) to be the origin of all entities and undestructible. Always glorifying me, (or) striving with firm vows, (or) bowing down to me, with reverence and ever devoted, (they) worship me.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Others again, performing the sacrifice of knowledge,</p>

<p>worship me, (some) as one, (some) as distinct, (some) as pervading the universe, in many forms.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I am the <i>Vedic</i> sacrifice, I am the sacrifice enjoined in the <i>Smritis</i>, I am <i>Swadha</i>, I am the medicament produced from herbs; I am the <i>mantra</i>, I am the sacrificial libation, I am the fire, and I am the (sacrificial) offering.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I am the father of this universe, the mother, the creator, grandsire; (I am) the thing to be known, the means by which everything is cleaned, the syllable <i>Om</i>, the <i>Rik</i>, the <i>Saman</i> and the <i>Yajus</i>, (I am) the goal, the supporter, the lord, the on-looker, the abode, the refuge, the friend, the source, the destruction, the support, the receptacle; and the undestructible seed. I give heat, I produce and suspend rain; I am immortality, and also death; and I am the existent and the non-existent, O Arjuna. They who know the three branches of knowledge, also drink the <i>Soma</i> juice, and whose sins have been cleansed worshipping me by sacrifices, seek admission into heaven; and these attaining to the sacred region of the chief of the gods, enjoy in heaven the celestial pleasure of the gods. Having enjoyed that celestial world of vast extent, upon exhaustion of their merit they re-enter the mortal world. It is thus that they who accept the doctrines of the three <i>Vedas</i> and wish for objects of desires, obtain going and coming. Those persons who, thinking (of me) without directing their minds to anything else, worship me, of those who are (thus) always devoted (to me)--I make them gifts and preserve what they have. Even those devotees who, endued with faith worship other godheads even they, O son of Kunti, worship me alone, (though) irregularly.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> I am the enjoyer, as also the lord, of all sacrifices. They, however, do not know me truly; hence they fall off (from heaven). They whose vows are directed to the <i>Pitris</i> attain to the <i>Pitris</i>; who direct (their) worship to the inferior spirits called <i>Bhutas</i> attain to <i>Bhutas</i>; they who worship me, attain even to myself. They who offer me with reverence, leaf, flower, fruit, water--that offered with reverence, I accept from him whose self is pure.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Whatever thou dost, whatever eatest, whatever drinkest, whatever givest, whatever austerities thou performest, manage it in such a way, O son of Kunti, that it may be an offering to me. Thus mayst thou be freed from the fetters of action having good and evil fruits. With self endued with renunciation and devotion, thou wilt be released and will come to me. I am alike to all creatures; there is none hateful to me, none dear. They, however, who worship me with reverence are in me and I also am in them. If even a person of exceedingly wicked conduct worshippeth me, without worshipping any one else, he should certainly be regard as good, for his efforts are well-directed. (Such a person) soon becometh of virtuous soul, and attaineth to eternal tranquillity. Know, O son of Kunti, that none devoted to me</p>

<p>is ever lost. For, O son of Pritha, even they who may be of sinful birth, women, Vaisyas, and also Sudras, even they, resorting to me, attain to the supreme goal. What then (shall I say) of holy Brahmanas and saints who are my devotees? Having come to this transient and miserable world, be engaged in my worship.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Fix thy mind on me; be my devotee, my worshipper; bow to me; and thus making me thy refuge and applying thy self to abstraction, thou wilt certainly come to me.'</p>
