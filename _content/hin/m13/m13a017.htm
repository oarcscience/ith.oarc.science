<p>"Vasudeva said, 'Concentrating his mind, O Yudhishthira. the regenerate Rishi Upamanyu, with hands joined together in reverence uttered this abstract of names (applying to Mahadeva), commencing from the beginning.'</p>  
<p>"Upamanyu said, 'I shall adore that great Deity who deserves the adorations of all creatures, by uttering those names that are celebrated over all the worlds,--names some of which were uttered by the Grandsire Brahma, some by the Rishis, and some of which occur in the Vedas and the Vedangas. Those names have been applied (unto the great Deity) by persons that are eminent. Those names of him that are, again, true and fraught with success and are capable of accomplishing all the purposes which the utterer may have in view, have been applied unto Mahadeva by Tandi after calling them from the Vedic lore with the aid of his devotion. Indeed, with those names that have been uttered by many well-known persons of righteousness and by ascetics conversant with all the spiritual principles. I shall adore him who is the foremost, who is the first, who leads to heaven, who is ready to confer benefits upon all creatures, and who is auspicious. Those names have been heard everywhere in the universe, having spread from the region of Brahma (where they were originally invented). All of them are fraught with the element of Truth. With those names I shall adore him who is Supreme Brahman, who has been declared (unto the universe) by the Vedas, and who is Eternal. I shall now tell thee, O chief of Yacht's race those names. Do thou hear them with rapt attention. Thou art a devoted worshipper of the Supreme Deity. Do thou worship the illustrious Bhava, distinguishing him above all the deities. And because thou art devoted to him, I shall therefore, recite those names in thy hearing. Mahadeva is Eternal Brahman. Persons endued with Yoga; Yoga's achievements are unable to know in even a hundred years, the glory and puissance of the great Deity in their entirety. Verily, the beginning, middle or end of Mahadeva cannot be apprehended by the very deities. Indeed, when the case is such, who is there O Madhava, that can recite the attributes of Mahadeva in their entirety? For all that, I shall through the grace of that illustrious and supreme Deity of perfect wisdom, extended to me for my devotion to him, recite his attributes as embodied in an abstract of few words and letters. The Supreme Lord is incapable of being adored by any one if he does not grant his permission to the adorer. As regards myself, it is only when I become fortunate enough to receive his permission that I succeed in adoring him. I shall indicate only a few names of that great Deity who is without birth and without destruction, who is the original cause of the universe, who is endued with the highest Soul, and whose origin is unmanifest. Hear, O Krishna, a few names, that were uttered by Brahma himself, of that giver of boons, that adorable deity, that puissant one who has the universe for his form, and who is possessed of supreme wisdom. These names that I shall recite</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></p>  
<p>are extracted from the ten thousand names that the great Grandsire had uttered in days of yore, as ghee is extracted from curds. As gold represents the essence of rocky mountains, as honey represents the essence of flowers, as Manda represents the extract from ghee, even so have these names been extracted from and represent the essence of those ten thousand names that were uttered by Grandsire Brahma. This abstract of names is capable of cleansing every sin, however heinous. It possesses the same merit that is attached to the four Vedas. It should be comprehended with attention by spiritual aspirants and engraved on the memory. These names <A HREF="errata.htm#9">fraught</A> with auspiciousness, leading to advancement, destructive of Rakshasas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and great cleansers should be imparted to only him that is devoted to the great Lord, to him that has faith, to him that believes. Unto him that has no faith, him that is an unbeliever, him that has not subjugated his soul, it should never be communicated. That creature, O Krishna, who cherishes malice towards the illustrious Mahadeva who is the original cause of everything, who is the Supreme Soul, and who is the great Lord, has certainly to go to hell with all his ancestors before and all his children after him. This abstract of names that I shall recite to thee is looked upon as Yoga.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> This is looked upon as the highest object of meditation. This is that which one should constantly recite as <i>Japya</i>. This is equivalent to Knowledge. This is the highest Mystery. If one, even during his last moments, recites it or hears it recited unto him, one succeeds in attaining to the highest end. This is holy. This is auspicious, this is fraught with every kind of benefit. This is the best of all things. Brahma, the Grandsire of all the universe, having in days of old composed it, assigned to it the foremost place among all excellent hymns. From that time, this hymn to the greatness and glory of the high-souled Mahadeva, which is held in the highest esteem by all the deities, has come to be regarded as the king of all hymns. This king of all hymns was first conveyed from the region of Brahman to heaven, the region of the celestials. Tandi then obtained it from heaven. Hence is it known as the hymn composed by Tandi. From heaven Tandi brought it down on Earth. It is the most auspicious of all auspicious things, and is capable of cleansing the heart from all sins however heinous. O thou of mighty arms, I shall recite to thee that best of all hymns. This hymn relates to him who is the Veda of the Vedas, and the most ancient of all ancient objects, to him who is the energy of all energies, and the penance of all penances; to him who is the most tranquil of all creatures endued with tranquillity, and who is the splendour of all splendours; to him who is looked upon as the most restrained of all creatures that are restrained, and him who is the intelligence of all creatures endued with intelligence; to him who is looked upon as the deity of all deities, and the Rishi of all Rishis; to him who is regarded as the sacrifice of all sacrifices and the most auspicious</p>

<p>of all things fraught with auspiciousness; to him who is the Rudra of all Rudras and the effulgence of all things endued with effulgence; to him who is the Yogin of all Yogins, and the cause of all causes; to him from whom all the worlds start into existence, and unto whom all the worlds return when they cease to exist; to him who is the Soul of all existent creatures, and who is called Hara of immeasurable energy.

<p>"I have thus, 'O Krishna, hymned the praises of the illustrious Deity by reciting his names in the order of their importance. Who is there that can hymn the praises of the lord of the universe, that great Lord of all who deserves our adorations and worship and reverence, whom the very gods with Brahma at their head are unable to praise and whom the Rishis also fail to sing? Aided, however, by my devotion to him, and having received his permission, I have praised that Lord of sacrifices, that Deity of supreme puissance, that foremost of all creatures endued with intelligence. By praising with these names that enhance one's auspiciousness of the great lord of blessedness, a worshipper of devoted soul and pure heart succeeds in attaining to his own self. These names constitute a hymn that furnishes the best means of attaining to Brahman. With the aid of this hymn one is sure to succeed in attaining to Emancipation. Rishis and the deities all praise the highest deity by uttering this hymn. Hymned by persons of restrained soul Mahadeva becomes gratified with those that hymn his praises so. The illustrious deity is always full of compassion towards his devotees. Endued with omnipotence, he it is that gives Emancipation to those that worship him. So also, they among men that are foremost, that are possessed of faith and devotion hear and recite for others</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and utter with reverence the praises of that highest and eternal Lord <i>viz</i>. Isana, in all their successive lives and adore him in thought, word, and deed, and adoring him thus at all times, <i>viz</i>. when they are lying or seated or walking or awake or opening the eyelids or shutting them, and thinking of him repeatedly, become objects of reverence with all their fellowmen and derive great gratification and exceeding joy. When a creature becomes cleansed of all his sins in course of millions of births in diverse orders of being, it is then that devotion springs up in his heart for Mahadeva. It is through good luck alone that undivided devotion to Bhava who is the original cause (of the universe) fully springs up in the heart of one that is conversant with every mode of worshipping that great Deity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Such stainless and pure devotion to Rudra, that has singleness of purpose and that is simply irresistible in its course, is seldom to be found among even the deities, and never among men. It is through the grace of Rudra that such devotion arises in the hearts of human beings. In consequence of such devotion, men, identifying themselves wholly with Mahadeva, succeed in attaining to the highest success. The illustrious Deity who is always inclined to extend his grace towards them that seek him with humility, and throw themselves with their whole soul upon him rescues them from the world. Except the great Deity who frees creatures from rebirth, all other gods constantly nullify the penances of men, for men have no other source of puissance that is as great as these.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> It was even thus Tandi of tranquil soul, resembling Indra himself in splendour, praised the illustrious Lord of all existent and non-existent things,--that great Deity clad in animal skins. Indeed, Brahma had sung this hymn in the presence of Sankara. Thou art a Brahmana (being conversant with Brahman and devoted to those that are conversant with Brahman). Thou shalt, therefore, comprehend it well. This is cleansing, and washes away all sins. This confers Yoga and Emancipation and heaven and contentment. He who recites this hymn with undivided devotion to Sankara succeeds in attaining to that high end which is theirs that are devoted to the doctrines of the Sankhya philosophy. That worshipper who recites this hymn daily for one year with singleness of devotion succeeds in obtaining the end that he desires. This hymn is a great mystery. It formerly resided in the breast of Brahma the Creator. Brahma imparted it unto Sakra. Sakra imparted unto Mrityu. Mrityu imparted it unto the Rudras. From the Rudras Tandi got it. Indeed Tandi acquired it in the region of Brahman as the reward of his severe austerities. Tandi communicated it to Sukra, and Sukra of Bhrigu's race communicated it</p>

<p>to Gautama. Gautama in his turn, O descendant of Madhu, communicated it to Vaivaswata-Manu. Manu communicated it unto Narayana of great intelligence, numbered among the Sadhyas and held exceedingly dear by him. The illustrious Narayana, numbered among the Sadhyas and possessed of glory that knows no diminution, communicated it to Yama. Vaivaswat Yama communicated it to Nachiketa. Nachiketa, O thou of Vrishni's race, communicated to Markandeya. From Markandeya, O Janarddana, I obtained it as the reward of my vows and fasts. To thee, O slayer of foes, I communicate that hymn unheard by others. This hymn leads to heaven. It dispels disease and bestows long life. This is worthy of the highest praise, and is consistent with the Vedas.'</p>  
<p>"Krishna continued, 'That person, O Partha, who recites this hymn with a pure heart observing the vow of Brahmacharyya, and with his senses under control, regularly for one whole year, succeeds in obtaining the fruits of a horse-sacrifice. Danavas and Yakshas and Rakshasas and Pisachas and Yatudhanas and Guhyakas and snakes can do no injury to him.'"</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_90"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_90">75:2</A> The commentator explains that <i>Bhava</i> is here used in the sense of that from which all things now and into which all things merge when the universal dissolution comes. Or, it may imply, mere existence, without reference, that is, to any attribute by which it is capable of being described or comprehended.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_91"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_91">75:3</A> <i>i.e.</i>, <i>Virat</i> or vast or Infinite.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_92"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_92">75:4</A> The task of rendering these names is exceedingly difficult. In the original, many of these names are such that they are capable of more than one interpretation. The commentator often suggests more than one meaning. Each name would require a separate note for explaining all its bearings. <i>Niyata</i> is literally one who is observant of fasts and vows and who has restrained his senses. Hence it means an ascetic. Mahadeva is an ascetic. <i>Smasanu</i> is either a crematorium, the place where dead creatures lie down, or, it may mean Varanasi, the sacred city of Siva, where creatures dying have not to take rebirth. Siva is both a resident of crematoria and of Varanasi.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_93"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_93">75:5</A> Or, the universe is displayed in thee.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_94"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_94">76:1</A> Probably, what is said here is that Mahadeva is the Pratyag Soul free from ignorance.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_95"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_95">76:2</A> By <i>Niyama</i> is meant purity both internal and external, contentedness, with whatever is got, penances, Vedic studies, meditation on the Deity, etc.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_96"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_96">76:3</A> <i>Nidhi</i> implies the largest number that can be named in Arithmetical notation. Hence, it implies, as the commentator correctly explains, the possessor of inexhaustible felicity and gladness.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_97"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_97">76:4</A> <i>Sahasraksha</i> is either Indra or possessor of innumerable eyes in consequence of Mahadeva's being identical with the universe. <i>Visalaksha</i> is one whose eyes are of vast power, because the Past and the Future are seen by them even as the Present. <i>Soma</i> implies either the Moon or the juice of the Soma <i>i.e.</i> the libations poured in the sacrificial fire. All righteous persons, again, become luminaries in the firmament. It is Mahadeva that makes them so <i>i.e.</i>, he is the giver of glorious forms to those that deserve them.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_98"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_98">76:5</A> Many of these names require comments to be intelligible. <i>Ketu</i> is no plant but Hindu astronomers name the descending node of the Moon by that name. Hence Rahu is the ascending node of the Moon. <i>Graha</i>, is that which seizes; <i>Grahapati</i> is <i>Mangala</i>, so called for its malevolence, <i>Varah</i> is <i>Vrihaspati</i> or Jupiter, who is the counterself of <i>Sukra</i> or Venus. In Hindu mythology, <i>Sukra</i> is a male person, the preceptor of the Daityas and Asuras. <i>Atri</i> is <i>Vudha</i> or Mercury, represented as the sons of <i>Atri</i>. <i>Atryahnamaskarta</i> is <i>Durvasas</i> who was the son of Atri's wife, got by the lady through a boon of Mahadeva. Daksha's Sacrifice sought to fly away from Siva, but the latter pursued it and shot his arrow at it for destroying it downright.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_99"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_99">77:1</A> <i>Suvarna-retas</i> is explained by the commentator as follows: At first he created water and then cast his seed into it. That seed became a golden egg. It may also mean that <i>Mahadeva</i> is <i>Agni</i> or the deity of fire, for gold represents the seed of Agni.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_100"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_100">77:2</A> The sense is this: <i>Jiva</i> carries that seed of acts, <i>i.e.</i>, Ignorance and Desire, with him. In consequence of this seed, <i>Jiva</i> travels from one world into another ceaselessly. This seed, therefore, is the conveyance or the means of locomotion of <i>Jiva</i>. Mahadeva is <i>Jiva</i>. The soul is called the rider, and the body is the car that bears the Soul on it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_101"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_101">77:3</A> <i>Ganapati</i> is <i>Ganesa</i>, the eldest son of <i>Mahadeva</i>. The Ganas are mighty beings that wait upon Mahadeva. This make up the first hundred names. The commentator takes <i>Avala</i> and <i>Gana</i> together.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_102"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_102">77:4</A> <i>Digvasas</i> means nude. The Puranas say that for stupefying the wives of certain ascetics, Mahadeva became nude on one occasion. The real meaning, however, is that he is capable of covering and does actually cover even infinite space. In the sense of nude, the word means one that has empty space for his cover or vestments.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_103"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_103">77:5</A> The meaning is that with thee Knowledge is penance instead of actual physical austerities being so. This is only another way of saying that thou hast <i>Jnanamayam Tapah</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_104"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_104">78:1</A> <i>Sataghni</i> a killer of hundred; Wilson thinks it was a kind of rocket.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_105"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_105">78:2</A> <i>Harikesa</i> means one having the senses for one's rays, <i>i.e.</i>, one who displays all objects before the soul through the doors of the senses. The meaning is that Mahadeva is he through whose puissance the mind succeeds in acquiring knowledge through the senses.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_106"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_106">78:3</A> <i>Krishna</i> is explained by the commentator thus. <i>Krish</i> is a word signifying <i>Bhu</i> or Existence. The letter <i>n</i> (the palatal one) signifies <i>nivritti</i>. Hence Krishna is <i>anandatanmatra</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_107"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_107">78:4</A> Kaparddin is thus explained by the commentator <i>Kam Jalam pivati iti kapah</i>. So called because of the incident noted in the text, for the matted locks of Mahadeva had sucked up the river Ganga when it first fell from heaven. Then <i>Rit</i> means sovereignty or lordship. <i>Riddah</i> is one that gives sovereignty. Combining the two, the compound <i>Kaparddin</i> is formed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_108"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_108">78:5</A> <i>Nabhah</i> means space which implies puissance. That <i>Nabhah</i> is the <i>sthala</i> or abode of Mahadeva. The Bengal texts which read <i>Nabhastala</i> are vicious.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_109"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_109">78:6</A> The deities are said to move about during the day, while the Asuras and Rakshasas during the night. What is said, therefore, here is that thou art the deities and thou art their foes of the Daityas and others.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_110"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_110">79:1</A> Sound, only when manifested, becomes perceptible. When unmanifest and lying in the womb of eternal space, it is believed to have an existence. Unmanifest Brahman is frequently represented as <i>anahatah savdah</i> or unstruck sound.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_111"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_111">79:2</A> These four ways are as enumerated by commentator, <i>Visva</i>, <i>Taijasa</i>, <i>Prajna</i>, <i>Sivadhyana</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_112"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_112">79:3</A> It may also mean that thou art he called Buddha who preached against all sacrifices.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_113"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_113">79:4</A> The commentator explains that Mahadeva's defeat at the hands of Krishna in the city of Vana was due to Mahadeva's kindness for Krishna, even as Krishna broke his own vow of never taking up arms in the battle of Kurukshetra, for honouring his worshipper Bhishma who had vowed that he would compel Krishna to take up arms.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_114"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_114">80:1</A> The sense is this: when the universal destruction cones and all becomes a mighty expanse of water, there appears a banian tree under whose shade the immortal <i>Rishi Markandeya</i> sees a boy who is <i>Mahavishnu</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_115"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_115">80:2</A> It may also mean that thou art he at whose approach all the <i>Daitya</i> troops fled in all directions.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_116"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_116">80:3</A> <i>i.e.</i>, thou art Time itself. This is the implication.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_117"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_117">80:4</A> By these three names what is indicated is that Mahadeva is a householder, it Sanyasin and a forest-recluse. House-holders bear a tuft of hair on their heads, Sanyasins have bald heads, while forest recluses or Vanaprasthis have matted locks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_118"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_118">81:1</A> The sense is that Brahman is felt by every one in the firmament of his own heart. Mahadeva, as identical with Brahman is displayed in the heart that is within the physical case. Hence, he may be said to take birth or appear in his effulgence within every one's body.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_119"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_119">81:2</A> <i>Kalakatankatah</i> is explained by the commentator as follows:--<i>Kala</i> is <i>Yama</i>. He is covered over with the illusion of the Supreme Deity. This all covering illusion, again, has the Supreme Deity for its cover. Thou art that Supreme Deity.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_120"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_120">81:3</A> <i>Vibhaga</i> and <i>Sarvaga</i>, the commentator explains, are used for indicating that thou art the universe as <i>Vyashti</i> and <i>Samashti</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_121"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_121">81:4</A> Some editions read <i>susaranab</i>, meaning thou art he who well protects the universe.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_122"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_122">81:5</A> The golden mail being the illusion of the Supreme Deity in consequence of which the universe has become displayed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_123"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_123">81:6</A> Thou art <i>Pasupati</i>; <i>atodyah pratodanarhah pasavah yasya iti</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_124"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_124">81:7</A> The commentator explains that <i>Tarangavit</i>, which is literally conversant with waves means one that is acquainted with the joys or pleasures that arise from the possession or enjoyment of worldly things, for such joys may truly be likened to waves which appear and disappear on the bosom of the sea or ocean of Eternity.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_125"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_125">82:1</A> The commentator explains that the binder of Asura chiefs refers to the Supreme Deity's form of Vishnu in which he had bound Vali, the chief of the Asuras. The plural form has reference to successive Kalpas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_126"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_126">82:2</A> The sense is that thou art he that is well conversant with the ritual of sacrifices.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_127"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_127">82:3</A> Or, it may mean that thou art he that has no vestments, for no vestments can cover thy vast limbs.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_128"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_128">82:4</A> Those that uphold others are, for example, the elephants that stand at the different points of the compass, the snake Sesha, etc. What is said here is that thou art the best of all these or all such beings.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_129"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_129">82:5</A> The sense is that thou art Vishnu who is the foremost of the celestials and thou art Agni who is the lowest of the celestials; <i>i.e.</i>, thou art all the celestials.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_130"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_130">83:1</A> The body is as it were a pit into which the soul falls, determined by Desire and Ignorance.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_131"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_131">83:2</A> <i>Vasu</i>, the commentator explains, indicates the Wind, for it means that which establishes all things into itself.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_132"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_132">83:3</A> <i>Nisachara</i> is one acting through <i>nisa</i>, or <i>Avidya</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, one who enjoys all objects, implying <i>Jiva</i> invested with Ignorance.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_133"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_133">83:4</A> The Soul can view the Soul or itself, if it can transcend the body with the aid of Yoga.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_134"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_134">83:5</A> The commentator explains that the first word means that thou art <i>Hansa</i> and that the second word means thou art <i>Paramahansa</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_135"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_135">84:1</A> <i>Varhaspatya</i> is a word that is applied to a priest. The deities first got their priest for assisting them at their sacrifices. Human beings then got theirs. Those born after Vrihaspati are Vrihaspatyas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_136"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_136">84:2</A> This word <i>Nandivardhanah</i> may also mean he that withdraws or takes away the joys previously conferred.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_137"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_137">85:1</A> The language of the <i>Veda</i> is divine. That of the scriptures is human.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_138"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_138">86:1</A> Literally, crown of the head.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_139"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_139">86:2</A> <i>i.e.</i>, that succeeds in effecting his Emancipation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_140"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_140">86:3</A> <i>Mahanakha</i> refers to the incarnation of <i>Narasingha</i> or the Man-lion assumed for slaying the <i>Daitya Hiranyakasipu</i>, the father of Prahlada. <i>Maharoman</i> has reference to the form of the mighty or vast Boar that the Supreme Deity assumed for raising the submerged Earth on his tusks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_141"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_141">86:4</A> <i>Mahamuni</i> may mean either one that is very <i>mananasilah</i> or one that is exceedingly taciturn.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_142"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_142">86:5</A> How the world has been likened to a tree has been explained in the Moksha sections of the Santi Parvan.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_143"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_143">86:6</A> This is explained in the sense of no one being able to enquire after Brahman unless he has a body, however subtile, with the necessary senses and understanding. It may also mean that the tree of the world furnishes evidence of the existence of the Supreme Deity.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_144"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_144">87:1</A> Both the vernacular translators have rendered many of these names most carelessly. The Burdwan translator takes <i>Yaju</i> as one name and <i>Padabhuja</i> as another. This is very absurd.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_145"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_145">87:2</A> These are the ten previously enumerated, beginning with residence in the mother's womb and ending with death as the tenth, with heaven the eleventh and Emancipation the twelfth.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_146"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_146">87:3</A> It should be remembered that Kali which is either the age of sinfulness or the presiding deity of that age and, therefore, a malevolent one, is highly propitious to Emancipation. The world being generally sinful, those who succeed in living righteously in this age or under the sway of this malevolent deity, very quickly attain to heaven if heaven be their object, or Emancipation if they strive for Emancipation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_147"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_147">87:4</A> Implying that thou assumest the form of the constellation called the Great Bear, and moving onward in space causest the lapse of Time. This constellation, in Hindu astronomy, is known by the name of <i>Sisumara</i> because of its resemblance with the form of a tortoise.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_148"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_148">88:1</A> The word <i>bhashma</i>, meaning ashes, literally signifies anything that dispels, tears off all bonds, and cures every disease. Ashes are used by Sanyasins for rubbing their bodies as a mark of their having consumed every sin and cut off every bond and freed themselves from all diseases.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_149"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_149">88:2</A> Mahadeva gave a quantity of ashes to his devotees for protecting them from sin.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_150"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_150">88:3</A> Vide the story of Mankanaka. The <i>Rishi</i> of that name, beholding vegetable juice issuing from his body, began to dance in joy. The whole universe, overpowered by a sympathetic influence, began to dance with him. At this, for protecting the universe, Mahadeva showed himself to Mankanaka and, pressing his fingers, brought out a quantity of ashes, thus showing that his body was made of ashes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_151"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_151">88:4</A> <i>Anukari</i> literally means an accessory. In the form of Vishnu or Krishna, the Supreme Deity addrest himself to aid Arjuna in slaying Bhishma.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_152"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_152">88:5</A> As Krishna the friend of Arjuna.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_153"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_153">89:1</A> In the Pauranik myth, the Earth is described as being supported in empty space by a mighty snake called Sesha. Mahadeva is that Sesha, otherwise called <i>Ananta</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_154"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_154">90:1</A> <i>i.e.</i>, Mahavishnu, from whose navel arose the primeval lotus within which was born Brahma.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_155"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_155">90:2</A> The Bombay text has a misprint. It reads <i>Punya-chanchu</i> for <i>Punya-chunchu</i>. In printing the commentary also, the well-known grammatical <i>Sutra vrittanschanchu</i> etc. The Burdwan translator repeats the misprint in his rendering. K. P. Singha avoids it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_156"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_156">90:3</A> The word <i>Kurukshetra</i> or its abbreviation <i>Kuru</i> means the field or department of action. It means also the actual field, so called, on which king <i>Kuru</i> performed his penances, and which is so sacred that its very dust cleanses a person of all sins.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_157"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_157">90:4</A> The commentator explains that <i>Siddharthah</i> means <i>Siddhantah</i>, and that the following compound is its adjective.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_158"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_158">91:1</A> Literally, the Soul of real existence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_159"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_159">91:2</A> People eat off plates of silver or gold or of other metals. Mahadeva has for his plate <i>Kala</i> or destroyer of the universe. Both the vernacular translators have erred in rendering this word. K. P. Singha takes the compound as really consisting of two names, etc.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_160"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_160">91:3</A> The sense is that Mahadeva is the foremost of <i>Sadhakas</i> or worshippers engaged in acquiring a particular object, for he has emaciated or reduced to nothingness all his foes in the form of all passions good and evil. <i>Prakarshena tanukritah arayah kamadayo yena sah</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_161"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_161">91:4</A> <i>Narah</i> is thus explained by the commentator.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_162"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_162">92:1</A> The commentator explains that he who is called <i>Suparvan</i> in heaven is otherwise called <i>Mahan</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_163"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_163">92:2</A> <i>Sarva-sahana-samarthya pradah</i> as the commentator explains. Hence, it means that Mahadeva is he who makes creatures competent to bear all things, <i>i.e.</i> all griefs and all joys, as also the influence all physical objects that is quietly borne without life being destroyed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_164"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_164">92:3</A> The etymology of <i>Hara</i> is thus explained by the commentator; <i>Hanti iti ha sulah</i>; <i>tam rati</i> or <i>adatte</i>. This is very fanciful.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_165"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_165">93:1</A> The sense is this: a <i>nipana</i> is a shallow pond or ditch where cattle drink. The very oceans are the <i>nipanas</i> or <i>Mahadeva</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_166"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_166">93:2</A> The commentator thinks that this has reference to the incarnation of <i>Trivikrama</i> <i>i.e.</i>, the dwarf suddenly expanding his form till with two steps he covered Heaven and Earth and demanded space for his third step.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_167"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_167">94:1</A> <i>i.e.</i>, thou art possessed of Yoga knowledge.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_168"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_168">94:2</A> The two together form one name.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_169"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_169">94:3</A> These are <i>Vija</i>, <i>Sakti</i>, and <i>Kilakani</i>. A <i>kakud</i> is a hump or elevated place in the body.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_170"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_170">95:1</A> The thin bamboo rod in the hand of the Brahmana is mightier than the thunderbolt of Indra. The thunder scorches all existing objects upon which it falls. The Brahmana's rod (which symbolizes the Brahmana's might in the form of his curse) blasts even unborn generations. The might of the rod is derived from Mahadeva.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_171"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_171">95:2</A> <i>Sayambhuvah Tigmatejah</i> is one name. The commentator explains that Brahman could not look at Mahadeva; hence this reference to his prowess.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_172"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_172">95:3</A> Brahma, after his birth within the primeval lotus, became desirous of seeing the end of the stalk of that lotus. He went on and on, without succeeding to find what he sought. The meaning of the word, therefore, by implication is that Mahadeva is infinite.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_173"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_173">95:4</A> Once Brahma asked Surabhi to bear evidence before Vishnu to the statement that Brahma has seen the foremost part of Siva. Surabhi having given false evidence out of fear for Brahma was cursed by Siva that her offspring will eat unholy substances.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_174"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_174">95:5</A> <i>Uma</i> is another name for <i>Brahmavidya</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_175"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_175">95:6</A> Falling from the celestial regions, the river Ganga was held by Mahadeva on his head, among his matted locks. At the earnest solicitations of King Bhagiratha he gave her out so that flowing along the surface of the Earth she met the ocean, first passing over the spot where the ashes of Bhagiratha's ancestors, the sixty thousand sons of king Sagara of the solar race, lay.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_176"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_176">96:1</A> This form is called <i>Hara-Gauri</i>, as explained before.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_177"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_177">96:2</A> Some texts read <i>Pritatma</i>, implying one of contented soul. The reading noticed by the commentator is <i>Pitatma</i>, meaning gold-complexioned. The Burdwan translator takes <i>Pritatma</i> as one name. This is not correct.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_178"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_178">96:3</A> Mahadeva is represented as possessed of five heads, four on four sides and one above.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_179"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_179">96:4</A> <i>Amritogovrisherwarah</i> is one name.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_180"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_180">96:5</A> These are names for different portions of time.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_181"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_181">97:1</A> The Srutis declare that Fire is his head, the Sun and the Moon are his eyes, etc.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_182"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_182">97:2</A> Mahadeva has an image in the country of the Kalingas that is called <i>Vyaghreswara</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_183"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_183">98:1</A> <i>Kantah</i> is thus explained. <i>Kasya Sukhasya antah sima</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_184"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_184">99:1</A> Undivided, <i>i.e.</i>, having nothing else for its object, <i>Sarva-bhavatah</i> is <i>bhagvat</i>. The sense is that unless one becomes conversant with all the modes of worshipping Bhava, <i>i.e.</i>, in thought, word and deed, and unless one has special good luck, one cannot have such devotion to Bhava.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_185"></A><A HREF="m13a017.htm#fr_185">99:2</A> There are numerous instances of the gods having become alarmed at the penances of men and done their best to nullify those penances by despatching celestial nymphs for attracting them of carnal pleasures.</P>
