# CHAPTER V.

On this <span id="fr_1217"></span>[1](#fn_1212), too, O chief of the
descendants of Bharata! they relate this ancient story, (in the form of)
a dialogue, which occurred, O son of P*ri*thâ! between a husband and
wife. A Brâhma*n*a's wife, seeing the Brâhma*n*a her husband, who had
gone through all knowledge and experience <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[2](#fn_1213), seated in seclusion, spoke to him
(thus): 'What world, indeed, shall I go to, depending on you as (my)
husband, you who live renouncing (all) action, and who are harsh and
undiscerning <span id="fr_1219"></span>[3](#fn_1214). We have heard that
wives attain to the worlds acquired by (their) husbands. What goal,
verily, shall I reach, having got you for my husband?' Thus addressed,
that man of a tranquil self, spoke to her with a slight smile: 'O
beautiful one! O sinless one! I am not offended at these words of yours.
Whatever action there is, that can be caught (by the touch) <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[4](#fn_1215), or seen, or heard, that only do the
men of action engage in as. action. Those who are devoid of knowledge
only lodge <span id="fr_1221"></span>[5](#fn_1216) delusion in
themselves by means of action. And freedom from action

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

is not to be attained in this world even for an instant <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[1](#fn_1217). From birth to the destruction of the
body, action, good or bad, by act, mind or speech <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[2](#fn_1218), does exist among (all) beings. While
the paths <span id="fr_1224"></span>[3](#fn_1219) (of action), in which
the materials are visible, are destroyed by demons <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[4](#fn_1220), I have perceived by means of the self
the seat abiding in the self <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[5](#fn_1221)--(the seat) where dwells the Brahman
free from the pairs of opposites, and the moon together with the
fire <span id="fr_1227"></span>[6](#fn_1222), upholding (all) beings
(as) the mover of the intellectual principle <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[7](#fn_1223); (the seat) for which <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[8](#fn_1224) Brahman and others concentrating
(their minds) worship that indestructible (principle), and for which
learned men have their senses restrained, and their selfs tranquil, and
(observe) good vows. It is not to be smelt by the nose, and not to be
tasted by the tongue. It is not to be touched by the sense of touch, but
is to be apprehended by the mind. It cannot be

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

conquered by the eyes,, and is entirely beyond the senses of hearing. It
is devoid of smell, devoid of taste and touch, devoid of colour and
sound, and imperishable <span id="fr_1230"></span>[1](#fn_1225). (It is
that) from which (this whole) expanse <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[2](#fn_1226) (of the universe) proceeds, and on
which it rests. From this the Prâ*n*a, Apâna, Samâna, Vyâna, and Udâna
also proceed, and into it they enter <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[3](#fn_1227). Between the Samâna and the Vyâna, the
Prâ*n*a and the Apâna moved. When that <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[4](#fn_1228) is asleep, the Samâna and Vyâna also
are absorbed <span id="fr_1234"></span>[5](#fn_1229); and between the
Prâ*n*a and the Apâna dwells the Udâna pervading (all). Therefore the
Prâ*n*a and the Apâna do not forsake a sleeping person. That is called
the Udâna, as the life-winds are controlled <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[6](#fn_1230) (by it). And therefore those who study
the Brahman engage in penance <span id="fr_1236"></span>[7](#fn_1231) of
which I am the goal <span id="fr_1237"></span>[8](#fn_1232). In

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

the interior <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1](#fn_1233), in the midst of
all these (life-winds) which move about in the body and swallow up one
another <span id="fr_1239"></span>[2](#fn_1234), blazes the Vai*s*vâna
fire <span id="fr_1240"></span>[3](#fn_1235) sevenfold. The nose, and
the tongue, and the eye, and the skin, and the ear as the fifth, the
mind and the understanding, these are the seven tongues <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[4](#fn_1236) of the blaze of Vai*s*vânara. That
which is to be smelt, that which is to be drunk, that which is to be
seen, that which is to be touched, and likewise that which is to be
heard, and also that which is to be thought of, and that which is to be
understood, those are the seven (kinds of) fuel for me <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[5](#fn_1237). That which smells, that which cats,
that which sees, that which touches, and that which hears. as the fifth,
that which thinks, and that which understands, these are the seven great
officiating priests <span id="fr_1243"></span>[6](#fn_1238). And mark
this always,

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

\[paragraph continues\] O beautiful one! The learned sacrificers
throwing (in) due (form) the seven offerings into the seven fires in
seven ways, produce them in their wombs <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[1](#fn_1239); (namely), that which is to be smelt,
that which is to be drunk, that which is to be seen, that which is to be
touched, and likewise that which is to be heard, that which is to be
thought of, and also that which is to be understood. Earth, air, space,
water, and light as the fifth, mind and understanding, these seven,
indeed, are named wombs. All the qualities which stand <span
id="fr_1245"></span>[2](#fn_1240) as offerings are absorbed into the
mouth of the fire <span id="fr_1246"></span>[3](#fn_1241); and having
dwelt within that dwelling are born in their respective wombs <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[4](#fn_1242). And in that very (principle), which
is the generator of all entities, they remain absorbed during (the time
of) deluge. From that <span id="fr_1248"></span>[5](#fn_1243) is
produced smell; from that is produced taste; from that is produced
colour; from that touch is produced; from that is produced sound; from
that doubt <span id="fr_1249"></span>[6](#fn_1244) is produced; from
that is produced determination. This (is what) they know as the
sevenfold production. In this very way was it <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[7](#fn_1245) comprehended by the ancients. Becoming
perfected by the perfect sacrifice <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[8](#fn_1246), they were perfectly filled with
light.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1212"></span>[256:1](sbe0832.htm#fr_1217) I. e. the
questions at [p. 252](sbe0831.htm#page_252), Nîlaka*nth*a; more
probably, perhaps, the 'doctrine' mentioned at [p.
254](sbe0831.htm#page_254) is what is alluded to.

<span id="fn_1213"></span>[256:2](sbe0832.htm#fr_1218) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
57](sbe0805.htm#page_57) and note.

<span id="fn_1214"></span>[256:3](sbe0832.htm#fr_1219) Nîlaka*nth*a says
this means 'ignorance that the wife has no other support.' Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra interprets kînâ*s*a to mean 'indigent' instead of 'harsh.'

<span id="fn_1215"></span>[256:4](sbe0832.htm#fr_1220) So Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra. Nîlakan*th*a's reading and his interpretation of the passage
are different.

<span id="fn_1216"></span>[256:5](sbe0832.htm#fr_1221) I follow Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra; the original literally means 'restrain.'

<span id="fn_1217"></span>[257:1](sbe0832.htm#fr_1222) Cf. Gîtâ, pp.
[52](sbe0804.htm#page_52), [53](sbe0805.htm#page_53); see also, as to
freedom from action, Gîtâ, [p. 127](sbe0820.htm#page_127).

<span id="fn_1218"></span>[257:2](sbe0832.htm#fr_1223) I. e. thought,
word, and deed. I have in the text kept to a more literal rendering.

<span id="fn_1219"></span>[257:3](sbe0832.htm#fr_1224) This is
Nîlaka*nth*a's reading and interpretation. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra reads
'actions visible and invisible.'

<span id="fn_1220"></span>[257:4](sbe0832.htm#fr_1225) Cf. inter alia
Kumâra-sambhava II, 46.

<span id="fn_1221"></span>[257:5](sbe0832.htm#fr_1226) I. e. says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, the safe place, within the body; and says
Nîlaka*nth*a, the seat called Avimukta, between the nose and the brows;
as to which cf. Gîtâ, [p. 67](sbe0807.htm#page_67). In the Kenopanishad
(p. 220) the word âyatana is used to signify a means to the attainment
of the Brahman.

<span id="fn_1222"></span>[257:6](sbe0832.htm#fr_1227) The moon and fire
constitute the universe, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
113](sbe0817.htm#page_113). Nîlakan*th*a interprets this more mystically
as referring to the I*d*â and Pi<u>n</u>galâ arteries.

<span id="fn_1223"></span>[257:7](sbe0832.htm#fr_1228) So Nîlaka*nth*a,
but he takes it to stand for 'vâyu' or wind, as a distinct principle.
The sense is by no means clear. But the moon being the deity of the mind
also may, perhaps, be described as she is here, on that account.

<span id="fn_1224"></span>[257:8](sbe0832.htm#fr_1229) This is Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra's interpretation of the original locative.

<span id="fn_1225"></span>[258:1](sbe0832.htm#fr_1230) Cf. note
 [4](sbe0831.htm#fn_1159), [p. 247](sbe0831.htm#page_247) supra, and [p.
253](sbe0831.htm#page_253).

<span id="fn_1226"></span>[258:2](sbe0832.htm#fr_1231) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says this means the five great elements, the eleven organs (active and
perceptive, and the mind), the life-wind, and the individual soul.

<span id="fn_1227"></span>[258:3](sbe0832.htm#fr_1232) The Prâ*n*a is at
the nose, the Apâna at the arms, the Samâna at the navel, the Vyâna
pervades the whole body, and the Udâna is at all the joints; cf.
Yoga-sûtra III, 38 seq. Nîlaka*nth*a says this explains how the
'expanse' (meaning, he says, the operations of the creation, &c.)
'proceeds' from the Brahman. See on the life-winds, B*ri*hadâra*ny*aka,
p. 667; *Kh*ândogya, pp. 42-188; Sâ<u>n</u>khyatattvakaumudî, p. 96;
Vedânta Paribhâshâ, p. 45; [p. 271](sbe0835.htm#page_271) infra.

<span id="fn_1228"></span>[258:4](sbe0832.htm#fr_1233) The self,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Nîlaka*nth*a says, the Prâ*n*a accompanied by the
Apâna.'

<span id="fn_1229"></span>[258:5](sbe0832.htm#fr_1234) I. e. into the
Prâ*n*a and Apâna, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1230"></span>[258:6](sbe0832.htm#fr_1235) Nîlaka*nth*a
derives the word thus, utkarshe*n*a ânayati.

<span id="fn_1231"></span>[258:7](sbe0832.htm#fr_1236) I. e. the
subjugation of the life-winds as indicated at Gîtâ, [p.
61](sbe0806.htm#page_61).

<span id="fn_1232"></span>[258:8](sbe0832.htm#fr_1237) The meaning of
the passage as a whole is not very clear, and the commentators afford
but little help. The sense appears to be this: The course of worldly
life is due to the operations of the life-winds which are attached to
the self and lead to its manifestations as individual souls. Of these,
the Samâna and Vyâna are <span id="page_259">p. 259</span> controlled
and held under check by the Prâ*n*a and Apâna, into which latter the
former are absorbed in sleep. The latter two are held in check and
controlled by the Udâna, which thus controls all. And the control of
this, which is the control of all the five, and which is otherwise
called penance, destroys the course of worldly life, and leads to the
supreme self.

<span id="fn_1233"></span>[259:1](sbe0832.htm#fr_1238) I. e. within the
body.

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[259:2](sbe0832.htm#fr_1239) As explained in
note  [8](#fn_1232), [p. 258](#page_258).

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[259:3](sbe0832.htm#fr_1240) This, says
Nîlaka*nth*a, explains the word 'I' in the sentence preceding.
Vaisvânara is a word often used to denote the self. The Vishama*s*lokî
derives it thus, 'that which saves all beings from hell;' see the
Prasna-upanishad, pp. 167-188 (where seven tongues are also referred
to); Mu*nd*aka, p. 292; *Kh*ândogya, p. 364; Mândukya, p. 341.

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[259:4](sbe0832.htm#fr_1241) Cf.
Taittirîya-âranyaka, p. 802.

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[259:5](sbe0832.htm#fr_1242) I. e. the
Vaisvânara. Cf. Taittirîya-âranyaka, p. 803 and gloss.

<span id="fn_1238"></span>[259:6](sbe0832.htm#fr_1243) These I take to
be the powers of hearing, &c., which are presided over by the several
deities; or, better, Perhaps, they may mean the soul distinguished as so
many with reference to these several powers; cf. B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p.
169; Maitrî, p,. 96; Prasna, pp. 214, 215; Kaushîtaki, p. 96; Aitareya,
p. 187; *Kh*ândogya, p. 616. The latter sense is accepted by Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[260:1](sbe0832.htm#fr_1244) The next clause
explains this; that which is to be smelt is earth, and so on throughout.
The men who sacrifice all sensuous objects, get such powers that they
can create the objects whenever they like. As to 'in their wombs,' see
Yoga Bhâshya, p. 108.

<span id="fn_1240"></span>[260:2](sbe0832.htm#fr_1245) I. e. are so
treated in the above allegory.

<span id="fn_1241"></span>[260:3](sbe0832.htm#fr_1246) I. e. the
Brahman.

<span id="fn_1242"></span>[260:4](sbe0832.htm#fr_1247) I. e. when the
sacrificer wishes, as stated in note  [1](#fn_1239).

<span id="fn_1243"></span>[260:5](sbe0832.htm#fr_1248) That
principle--viz. the Brahman.

<span id="fn_1244"></span>[260:6](sbe0832.htm#fr_1249) This is the
operation of the mind, see Gîtâ, [p. 57](sbe0805.htm#page_57) note.

<span id="fn_1245"></span>[260:7](sbe0832.htm#fr_1250) The Brahman,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Or it may be the 'sevenfold production.'

<span id="fn_1246"></span>[260:8](sbe0832.htm#fr_1251) The wholesale
sacrifice of all sensuous perceptions. The <span id="page_262">p.
262</span> root corresponding with perfect occurs three times in the
original, hence the repetition of perfect above.
