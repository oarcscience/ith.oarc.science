<P>On this, too, they relate an ancient story, O beautiful one! (showing) of what description is the institution of the five sacrificial priests. The learned know this to be a great principle, that the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a and the Ap&acirc;na, and the Ud&acirc;na, and also the Sam&acirc;na and the Vy&acirc;na, are the five sacrificial priests.</P>

<P>My former belief was that the sacrificial priests were seven. by (their) nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1299"></A><A HREF="#fn_1294"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.

<P>The wind prepared by the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a afterwards becomes the Ap&acirc;na. The wind prepared in the Ap&acirc;na then works as the Vy&acirc;na. The wind prepared by the Vy&acirc;na works as the Ud&acirc;na.

<P><A NAME="fn_1292"></A><A HREF="sbe0834.htm#fr_1297">270:2</A> Owing to the want of food, &amp;c. Cf. Maitr&icirc;, p. 112, and <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya. p. 422.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1293"></A><A HREF="sbe0834.htm#fr_1298">270:3</A> Perception of pleasure, says Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra; but he takes the subsequent clause to mean this, 'and without you no pleasure accrues to us either.' The text is here in an unsatisfactory state.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1294"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1299">270:4</A> As stated in the last chapter; some MSS. read 'your' for 'my' at the beginning of the sentence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1295"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1300">270:5</A> Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra says that in this Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>ahot<I>ri</I>-vidh&acirc;na the five chief Hot<I>ri</I>s only are stated for briefly explaining the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;y&acirc;ma.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1296"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1301">271:1</A> Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra says, 'The wind going to the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, and being obstructed in upward progress by the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, goes to the Ap&acirc;na, and then unable to go upwards or downwards, enters the passages or n&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;s of the body and becomes Vy&acirc;na. In the same way Ud&acirc;na, by the collision of the two, produces sound in the throat, and depends on Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a and Ap&acirc;na; so, too, the Sam&acirc;na dwelling in the navel and kindling the gastric fire is also dependent on those two.' The meaning seems to be that one life-wind is distributed in the different places, and gets different names, as stated, in the order mentioned. See Maitr&icirc;, p. 28.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1297"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1302">271:2</A> A similar visit on the part of the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as (who, however, are not there the life-winds only, but the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a life-wind and the active organs) to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is mentioned at B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka-upanishad, p. 1016, and <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya, p. 297. Cf. also Pra<I>s</I>na, p. 178; B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, p. 317; and Kaush&icirc;taki, p. 63. See also, generally, as to the life-winds and their functions, B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, p. 280, and <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara's comment there; Yoga-s&ucirc;tras III, 38, and comment; Cowell's note at Maitr&icirc;, p. 247; <I>S</I>&acirc;nti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 184, st. 24-25; chap. 185, st. 1 seq.; and <A HREF="sbe0832.htm#page_258">p. 258</A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1298"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1303">272:1</A> Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra says, Vy&acirc;na and Ap&acirc;na also by force of the two 'ands' which occur in the original; and so in other places too.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1299"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1304">272:2</A> Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra says on this, 'The Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a moves upwards through the help of the Ap&acirc;na. If it moved downwards, it would be simply absorbed into the Ap&acirc;na.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1300"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1305">272:3</A> I. e. recommenced its, proper operation in its proper place.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1302"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1307">273:1</A> Because the Sam&acirc;na helps in the digestion of the food which afterwards goes to the Vy&acirc;na for distribution through the n&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;s.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1303"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1308">273:2</A> Because the Ud&acirc;na is able to generate sound after the n&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;s are filled up by the Vy&acirc;na.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1304"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1309">273:3</A> 'Not greatest' because none of them is independent of the other. 'Greatest' Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra renders by 'superior to objects.'</P>
