<P><A NAME="fn_1320"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1325">277:3</A> The V&acirc;madevya is a s&ucirc;kta beginning 'Kay&acirc; na<I>s</I> <I>k</I>itr&acirc;' (Rv. IV, 31, 1). The singing of it is the third Savana, Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra. And see Taittir&icirc;ya-&acirc;ranyaka, p. 889.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1323"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1328">278:2</A> The texts here differ. Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra's reading he interprets to mean 'the subjugation of these Hotris.' The reading followed in the text seems to some extent to be supported by the sequel. But the passage altogether is not very clear.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1324"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1329">278:3</A> So Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra--through these the knowledge of the qualities of objects of sense is acquired.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1326"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1331">278:5</A> This seems to mean, that the powers of smelling, &amp;c., when attributed to the self, make him appear as an agent, as an active principle.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1327"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1332">278:6</A> I. e. action, agent, and instrument, Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1330"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1335">279:1</A> I. e., I presume, the senses. Cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0804.htm#page_50">p. 50</A>. The learned do. not suppose their self to have aught to do with them. Cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0807.htm#page_64">p. 64</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1331"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1336">279:2</A> Cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0805.htm#page_53">p. 53</A>; Manu III, 118.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1333"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1338">279:4</A> I. e. mischief owing to the destruction of life necessary for getting food, says N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a quoting B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, p. 913.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1334"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1339">279:5</A> This includes the operation of the understanding also. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a says this verse explains what the word 'food' means here.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1336"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1341">279:7</A> That is to say, my self, Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra. See <A HREF="sbe0832.htm#page_259">p. 259</A>, note &nbsp;<A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fn_1235"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> supra.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1338"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1343">279:9</A> It is called 'fire,' as it burns up all action. Cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0806.htm#page_62">p. 62</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1339"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1344">280:1</A> Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra's commentary is not intelligible here, so I follow N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, but diffidently.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1340"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1345">280:2</A> I. e. the mind, say the commentators. 'Mant&acirc;' simply is given among the synonyms of Aha<U>n</U>k&acirc;ra at S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&acirc;ra, p. 16.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1341"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1346">280:3</A> I. e. the actions performed for knowledge of the truth, Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1342"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1347">280:4</A> N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a refers to a <I>Rik</I> 'Tapa &acirc;s&icirc;d-g<I>ri</I>hapatih,' and also the famous allegory at the end of the Taittir&icirc;ya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka. These are cited, he says, as authorities for this 'sacrifice (consisting of) concentration of mind.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1343"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1348">280:5</A> I. e. the senses, N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a. Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra compares the whole passage with the Purusha S&ucirc;kta, which are the <I>Rik</I> verses alluded to, according to him. He refers for further explanations to his own commentary on that s&ucirc;kta of the Rig-veda.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1344"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1349">280:6</A> They sing these hymns, out of the gratification produced by knowledge of the self, says N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, and he cites Taittir&icirc;ya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, p. 749. See also Taittir&icirc;ya-upanishad, p. 138, and <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara's commentary there.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1345"></A><A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fr_1350">280:7</A> The readings of our texts here are not very satisfactory. The illustration is stated, says N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, whose reading we follow, by the Taittir&icirc;yas in the passage referred to in the last note. Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra's reading means 'such as T&acirc;hu <I>k</I>&acirc;hu,' which would seem to be the words of the S&acirc;man hymn referred to. But his commentary does not show what the words before him were. The whole figure as drawn out in this passage is not quite clear, though the general sense is pretty intelligible. Cf. the allegories at Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, pp. 132, 133, and at the close of the Taittir&icirc;ya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka.</P>
