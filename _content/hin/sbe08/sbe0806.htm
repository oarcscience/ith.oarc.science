<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Deity said:</P>
<P>This everlasting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (system of) devotion I declared to the sun, the sun declared it to Manu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and Manu communicated it to Ikshv&acirc;ku. Coming thus by steps, it became known to royal sages. But, O terror of (your) foes! that devotion was lost to the world by long (lapse of) time. That same primeval devotion I have declared to you to-day, seeing. that you are my devotee and friend, for it is the highest mystery.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Ar<I>g</I>una said:</P>
<P>Later is your birth the birth of the sun is prior. How then shall I understand that you declared (this) first?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Deity said:</P>
<P>I have passed through many births, O Ar<I>g</I>una I and you also. I know them all, but you, O terror of (your) foes! do not know them. Even though I am unborn and inexhaustible in (my) essence, even though I am lord of all beings, still I take up the control of my own nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and am born by means</P>

<P>of my delusive power. Whensoever, O descendant of Bharata! piety languishes, and impiety is in the ascendant, I create myself. I am born age after age, for the protection of the good, for the destruction of evil-doers, and the establishment of piety. Whoever truly knows thus my divine birth and work, casts off (this) body and is not born again. He comes to me, O Ar<I>g</I>una! Many from whom affection, fear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and wrath have departed, who are full of me, who depend on me, and who are purified by the penance of knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, have come into my essence. I serve men in the way in which they approach me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. In every way, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! men follow in my path&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Desiring the success of actions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, men in this world worship the divinities, for in this world of mortals, the success produced by action is soon obtained. The fourfold division of castes was created by me according to the apportionment of qualities and duties. But though I am its author, know me to be inexhaustible, and not the author. Actions defile me not. I have no attachment to the fruit of actions. He who knows me thus is not tied down by actions. Knowing this, the men of old who wished for final emancipation, performed action. Therefore do you, too, perform action as was done by men of old in olden times. Even sages are confused as to what</P>

<P>is action, what inaction. Therefore I will speak to you about action, and learning that, you will be freed from (this world of) evil. One must possess knowledge about action; one must also possess knowledge about prohibited action; and again one must possess knowledge about inaction. The truth regarding action is abstruse. He is wise among men, he is possessed of devotion, and performs all actions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction. The wise call him learned, whose acts are all free from desires and fancies, and whose actions are burnt down by the fire of knowledge. Forsaking all attachment to the fruit of action, always contented, dependent on none, he does nothing at all, though he engages in action. Devoid of expectations, restraining the mind and the self, and casting off all belongings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he incurs no sin, performing actions merely for the sake of the body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Satisfied with earnings coming spontaneously&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, rising above the pairs of opposites, free from all animosity, and equable on success or ill-success, he is not fettered down, even though he performs (actions). The acts of one who is devoid of attachment, who is free&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, whose mind is fixed on knowledge, and who performs action for (the purpose of) the sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> are all destroyed.</P>

<P>Brahman is the oblation; with Brahman (as a sacrificial instrument) it is offered up; Brahman is in the fire; and by Brahman it is thrown; and Brahman, too, is the goal to which he proceeds who meditates on Brahman in the action&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Some devotees perform the sacrifice to the gods, some offer up the sacrifice by the sacrifice itself in the fire of Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Others offer up the senses, such as the sense of hearing and others, in the fires of restraint&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; others offer up the objects of sense, such as sound and so forth, into the fires of the senses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Some again offer up all the operations of the senses and the operations of the life-breaths into the fire of devotion by self-restraint&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, kindled by knowledge. Others perform the sacrifice of wealth, the sacrifice of penance, the sacrifice of concentration of mind, the sacrifice of Vedic study&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and of knowledge, and others are ascetics of rigid vows. Some offer up the upward life-breath into the downward life-breath, and the downward life-breath into the upper life-breath, and stopping up the motions of the upward and downward life-breaths, devote themselves to the restraint of the life-breaths&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.

<P>the life-breaths. All of these, conversant with the sacrifice, have their sins destroyed by the sacrifice. Those who eat the nectar-like leavings of the sacrifice repair to the eternal Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. This world is not for those who perform no sacrifice, whence (then) the other, O best of the Kauravas! Thus sacrifices of various sorts are laid down in the Vedas. Know them all to be produced from action&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and knowing this you will be released (from the fetters of this world). The sacrifice of knowledge, O terror of (your) foes! is superior to the sacrifice of wealth, for action, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! is wholly and entirely comprehended in knowledge. That&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> you should learn by salutation, question, and service&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The men of knowledge who perceive the truth will teach knowledge to you. Having learnt that, O son of P&acirc;<I>nd</I>u! you will not again fall thus into delusion; and by means of it, you will see all beings, without exception, first in yourself, and then in me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. Even if you are the most sinful of all sinful men, you will cross over all trespasses by means of the boat of knowledge alone. As a fire well kindled, O Ar<I>g</I>una! reduces fuel to ashes, so the fire of knowledge reduces all actions to ashes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. For there is in this world no means of sanctification like knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, and that one perfected by devotion finds within one's self in time. He who has faith, whose</P>

<P>senses are restrained, and who is assiduous, obtains knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="sbe0807.htm#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Obtaining knowledge, he acquires, without delay, the highest tranquillity. He who is ignorant and devoid of faith, and whose self is full of misgivings, is ruined. Not this world, not the next, nor happiness, is for him whose self is full of misgivings. Actions, O Dhana&ntilde;<I>g</I>aya! do not fetter one who is self-possessed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="sbe0807.htm#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, who has renounced action by devotion, and who has destroyed misgivings by knowledge. Therefore, O descendant of Bharata! destroy, with the sword of knowledge, these misgivings of yours which fill your mind, and which are produced from ignorance. Engage in devotion. Arise!</P>
