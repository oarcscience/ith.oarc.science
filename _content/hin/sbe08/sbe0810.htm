<P>What is that Brahman, what the Adhy&acirc;tma, and what, O best of beings! is action? And what is called the Adhibh&ucirc;ta? And who is the Adhiya<I>g</I>&ntilde;a, and how in this body, O destroyer of Madhu? And how, too, are you to be known at the time of departure (from this world) by those who restrain their selfs?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Deity said:</P>
<P>The Brahman is the supreme, the indestructible. Its manifestation (as an individual self) is called the Adhy&acirc;tma. The offering (of an oblation to any divinity), which is the cause of the production and development of all things, is named action. The Adhibh&ucirc;ta is all perishable things. The Adhidaivata is the (primal) being. And the Adhiya<I>g</I>&ntilde;a, O best of embodied (beings)! is I myself in this body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</P>

Therefore, at all times remember me, and engage in battle. Fixing your mind and understanding on me, you will come to me, there is no doubt. He who thinks of the supreme divine Being, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! with a mind not (running) to other (objects), and possessed of abstraction in the shape of continuous meditation (about the supreme), goes to him. He who, possessed of reverence (for the supreme Being) with a steady mind, and with the power of devotion, properly concentrates the life-breath between the brows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and meditates on the ancient Seer, the ruler, more minute than the minutest atom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the supporter of all, who is of an unthinkable form, whose brilliance is like that of the sun, and who is beyond all darkness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, he attains to that transcendent and divine Being.

On the opening passage of the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya, <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara says, 'Om is the closest designation of the supreme Being.

They are limited by time. As to ages, <I>S</I>r&icirc;dhara says, a human year is a day and night of the gods. Twelve thousand years made of such days and nights make up the four ages: one thousand such, 'quaternions of ages' make up a day, and another thousand a night of Brahm&acirc;. Of such days and nights Brahm&acirc; has a hundred years to live. At the close of his life, the universe is destroyed.</P>
