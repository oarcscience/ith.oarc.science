<P>Now I will speak to you, who are not given to carping, of that most mysterious knowledge, accompanied by experience, by knowing which you will be released from evil. It is the chief among the sciences, the chief among the mysteries. It is the best means of sanctification. It is imperishable, not</P>

<P>opposed to the sacred law. It is to be apprehended directly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="#fn_313"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and is easy to practise. O terror of your foes! those men who have no faith in this holy doctrine, return to the path of this mortal world, without attaining to me. This whole universe is pervaded by me in an unperceived form. All entities live in me, but I do not live in them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_315"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Nor yet do all entities live in me. See my divine power. Supporting all entities and producing all entities, my self lives not in (those) entities. As the great and ubiquitous atmosphere always remains in space, know that similarly all entities live in me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_316"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. At the expiration of a Kalpa, O son of Kunt&icirc;! all entities enter my nature; and at the beginning of a Kalpa, I again bring them forth. Taking the control of my own nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, I bring forth again and again this whole collection of entities, without a will of its own&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_318"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, by the power of nature. But, O Ar<I>g</I>una! these actions do not fetter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_319"></A><A HREF="#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> me, who remain like one unconcerned, and who am unattached to those actions. Nature gives birth to movables and immovables through me, the supervisor, and by reason of that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, O son of Kunt&icirc;! the universe revolves.

But the high-souled ones, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! who are inclined to the godlike nature, knowing me as the inexhaustible source of (all) entities, worship me with minds not (turned) elsewhere.</P>
<P>Constantly glorifying me, and exerting themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_322"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, firm in their vows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and saluting me with reverence,</P>
<P>they worship me, being always devoted. And others again, offering up the sacrifice of knowledge, worship me as one, as distinct, and as all-pervading in numerous forms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. I am the Kratu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, I am the Ya<I>g</I>&ntilde;a, I am the Svadh&acirc;, I the product of the herbs. I am the sacred verse.

I am the father of this universe, the mother, the creator, the grandsire, the thing to be known, the means of sanctification, the syllable Om&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, the <I>Rik</I>, S&acirc;man, and Ya<I>g</I>us also; the goal, the sustainer, the lord, the supervisor, the</P>

I cause heat and I send forth and stop showers. I am immortality and also death; and I, O Ar<I>g</I>una! am that which is and that which is not&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Those who know the three (branches of) knowledge, who drink the Soma juice, whose sins are washed away, offer sacrifices and pray to me for a passage into heaven; and reaching the holy world of the lord of gods, they enjoy in the celestial regions the celestial pleasures of the gods. And having enjoyed that great heavenly world, they enter the mortal world when (their) merit is exhausted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Thus those who wish for objects of desire, and resort to the ordinances of the three (Vedas), obtain (as the fruit) going and coming. To those men who worship me, meditating on me and on no one else, and who are constantly devoted, I give new gifts and preserve what is acquired by them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Even those, O son of Kunt&icirc;! who being devotees of other divinities worship with faith, worship me only, (but) irregularly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. For I am the enjoyer as well as the lord&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> of all sacrifices. But they know me not truly, therefore do they fall&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. Those who make vows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> to the gods go to the gods;</P>

<P>those who make vows to the manes go to the manes, those who worship the Bh&ucirc;tas go to the Bh&ucirc;tas; and those likewise who worship me go to me. Whoever with devotion offers me leaf, flower, fruit, water, that, presented with devotion, I accept from him whose self is pure. Whatever you do, O son of Kunt&icirc;! whatever you eat, whatever sacrifice you make, whatever you give, whatever penance you perform, do that as offered to me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Thus will you be released from the bonds of action, the fruits of which are agreeable or disagreeable. And with your self possessed of (this) devotion, (this) renunciation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_337"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, you will be released (from the bonds of action) and will come to me. I am alike to all beings; to me none is hateful, none dear. But those who worship me with devotion (dwell) in me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and I too in them. Even if a very ill-conducted man worships me, not worshipping any one else, he must certainly be deemed to be good, for he has well resolved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. He soon becomes devout of heart, and obtains lasting tranquillity. (You may) affirm, O son of Kunt&icirc;! that my devotee is never ruined. For, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! even those who are of sinful birth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, women, Vai<I>s</I>yas; and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras likewise, resorting to me, attain the supreme goal.

(Place your) mind on me, become my devotee, my worshipper; reverence me, and thus making me your highest goal, and devoting your self to abstraction, you will certainly come to me.</P>
