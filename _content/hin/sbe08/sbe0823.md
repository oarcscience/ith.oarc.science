# CHAPTER II.

Vaisampâyana said:

Then the talented king, Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra, bowed <span
id="fr_615"></span>[2](#fn_612) to those words uttered by Vidura, and,
in a secluded place <span id="fr_616"></span>[3](#fn_613), interrogated
Sanatsu*g*âta regarding the highest knowledge <span
id="fr_617"></span>[4](#fn_614), wishing to become (a) high-souled
(man) <span id="fr_618"></span>[5](#fn_615).

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

O Sanatsu*g*âta! which of the two is correct, your teaching <span
id="fr_619"></span>[6](#fn_616), about which I have heard, that death
exists not, or that <span id="fr_620"></span>[7](#fn_617) the gods and
demons practised

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

the life of Brahma*k*ârins <span id="fr_621"></span>[1](#fn_618), for
freedom from death?

Sanatsu*g*âta said

Some (say), that freedom from death (results) from action <span
id="fr_622"></span>[2](#fn_619); and others that death exists not. Hear
me explain (this), O king! have no misgiving about it <span
id="fr_623"></span>[3](#fn_620). Both truths, O Kshatriya! have been
current from the beginning <span id="fr_624"></span>[4](#fn_621). The
wise maintain what (is called) delusion (to be) death. I <span
id="fr_625"></span>[5](#fn_622) verily call heedlessness death, and
likewise I call freedom from heedlessness immortality. Through
heedlessness, verily, were the demons <span
id="fr_626"></span>[6](#fn_623) vanquished; and through freedom

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

from heedlessness the gods attained to the Brahman. Death, verily, does
not devour living creatures like a tiger; for, indeed, his form is not
to be perceived. Some <span id="fr_627"></span>[1](#fn_624) say that
death is different from this, (named) Yama, who dwells in the self <span
id="fr_628"></span>[2](#fn_625) the (practice of the) life of
Brahma*k*ârins (being) immortality. That god governs his kingdom in the
world of the Pit*ri*s, (being) good to the good, and not good to (those
who are) not good. That death, (or) heedlessness, develops in men as
desire, and afterwards as wrath, and in the shape of delusion <span
id="fr_629"></span>[3](#fn_626). And then travelling in devious
paths <span id="fr_630"></span>[4](#fn_627) through egoism, one does not
attain to union <span id="fr_631"></span>[5](#fn_628) with the self.
Those who are deluded by it <span id="fr_632"></span>[6](#fn_629), and
who remain under its influence, depart from this (world), and there
again fall down <span id="fr_633"></span>[7](#fn_630). Then, the
deities <span id="fr_634"></span>[8](#fn_631) gather around them. And
then he undergoes death after death <span
id="fr_635"></span>[9](#fn_632). Being attached to the fruit of action,
on action presenting itself, they follow after it <span
id="fr_636"></span>[10](#fn_633), and do not cross

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

beyond death. And the embodied (self), in consequence of not
understanding union <span id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_634) with the real
entity, proceeds on all hands <span id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_635) with
attachment to enjoyments. That <span id="fr_639"></span>[3](#fn_636),
verily, is the great source of delusion to the senses; for by
contact <span id="fr_640"></span>[4](#fn_637) with unreal entities, his
migrations <span id="fr_641"></span>[5](#fn_638) are (rendered)
inevitable; because having his inner self contaminated by contact with
unreal entities, he devotes himself to objects of sense on all sides,
pondering on them (only). (That) pondering, verily, first. ruins <span
id="fr_642"></span>[6](#fn_639) him; and soon afterwards desire and
wrath, after attacking him. These <span id="fr_643"></span>[7](#fn_640)
lead children to death. But sensible men cross beyond death by their
good sense. He who pondering (on the self) destroys <span
id="fr_644"></span>[8](#fn_641) (the) fugitive (objects of sense), not
even thinking of them through contempt (for them), and who being
possessed of knowledge destroys desires in this way, becomes, as it
were, the death of death (itself), and swallows (it) up <span
id="fr_645"></span>[9](#fn_642). The being who

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

pursues desires, is destroyed (in pursuing) after the desires <span
id="fr_646"></span>[1](#fn_643). But casting away desires, a being gets
rid of all taint <span id="fr_647"></span>[2](#fn_644) whatever, This
body, void of enlightenment <span id="fr_648"></span>[3](#fn_645), seems
(to be) a hell for (all) beings. Those who are avaricious run
about <span id="fr_649"></span>[4](#fn_646), going headlong to a ditch.
A man, O Kshatriya! who contemns everything else <span
id="fr_650"></span>[5](#fn_647) learns nothing. To him (the body is)
like a tiger made of straw <span id="fr_651"></span>[6](#fn_648). And
this internal self (joined to) delusion and fear <span
id="fr_652"></span>[7](#fn_649) in consequence of wrath and avarice,
within your body, that verily is death <span
id="fr_653"></span>[8](#fn_650). Understanding death <span
id="fr_654"></span>[9](#fn_651) to be thus produced, and adhering to
knowledge, one is not afraid of death <span
id="fr_655"></span>[10](#fn_652) in this (world). In his province death
is destroyed, as a mortal (is destroyed) on arriving in the province of
death.

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

The good, eternal, and most holy worlds <span
id="fr_656"></span>[11](#fn_653), which

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

are mentioned (as attainable) by the twice-born by means of
worship <span id="fr_657"></span>[1](#fn_654), those, say the Vedas, are
the highest aim <span id="fr_658"></span>[2](#fn_655). How is it, then,
that one who understands this does not resort to action?

Sanatsu*g*âta said!

(Thinking) so, an ignorant man does resort to action. The Vedas likewise
do lay down various benefits <span id="fr_659"></span>[3](#fn_656) (for
him). But that <span id="fr_660"></span>[4](#fn_657) (man) comes not
hither <span id="fr_661"></span>[5](#fn_658). (Becoming) the supreme
self <span id="fr_662"></span>[6](#fn_659), he attains the supreme, by
the (right) path destroying the wrong paths <span
id="fr_663"></span>[7](#fn_660).

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

Who <span id="fr_664"></span>[8](#fn_661) is it that constrains this
unborn primeval (self), if it is (itself). all this severally <span
id="fr_665"></span>[9](#fn_662)? And what

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

has it to do, or what is its unhappiness <span
id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_663)? Tell me all that accurately, O learned
person!

Sanatsu*g*âta said:

There is great danger <span id="fr_667"></span>[2](#fn_664) in
attributing distinctions to it. The everlasting <span
id="fr_668"></span>[3](#fn_665) (principles) exist by connexion with the
beginningless <span id="fr_669"></span>[4](#fn_666) (principle). So that
his greatness is not lost at all <span id="fr_670"></span>[5](#fn_667),
and beings exist by connexion with the beginningless <span
id="fr_671"></span>[4](#fn_666) (principle). That which is the real--the
supreme Being <span id="fr_672"></span>[6](#fn_668)--is eternal. He
creates the universe by means of changes <span
id="fr_673"></span>[7](#fn_669), for such is his power held to be; and
for such connexions of things the Vedas are (authority) <span
id="fr_674"></span>[8](#fn_670).

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

Since some practise piety <span id="fr_675"></span>[1](#fn_671) in this
world, and some likewise practise impiety in this world; is the piety
destroyed by the sin, or else. does the piety destroy sin?

Sanatsu*g*âta said:

Whichever <span id="fr_676"></span>[2](#fn_672) he adheres to, the man
of understanding always destroys both by means of knowledge; (that is)
settled <span id="fr_677"></span>[3](#fn_673). Likewise, in the other
case <span id="fr_678"></span>[4](#fn_674), the embodied (self) obtains
merit; and to such a one sin (also) accrues; (that too is) settled <span
id="fr_679"></span>[3](#fn_673). Departing (from this world), he enjoys
by his actions both (kinds of) fruit, which are not enduring <span
id="fr_680"></span>[5](#fn_675)--of actions (which are) pure, and of
(those which are) sinful. The man of understanding casts aside sin by
piety in this (world), for know that his piety is more powerful <span
id="fr_681"></span>[6](#fn_676). Those Brâhma*n*as, in whom there is
emulation <span id="fr_682"></span>[7](#fn_677) about (their) piety, as
there is in strong men about (their) strength, after departing from this
world, become glorious in heaven <span id="fr_683"></span>[8](#fn_678).
And

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

to those in whom there is no emulation about (their) piety, that (piety)
is a means of (acquiring) knowledge <span
id="fr_684"></span>[1](#fn_679). Such Brâhma*n*as released from this
(world), go to the heaven which is free from the threefold source of
pain <span id="fr_685"></span>[2](#fn_680). People who understand the
Vedas call his conduct good. (But) people closely connected <span
id="fr_686"></span>[3](#fn_681), as well as strangers, do not pay much
regard to him. Wherever he may believe food and drink for a Brâhma*n*a
to exist in abundance, like water on grass in the autumn, there would he
live and not be vexed <span id="fr_687"></span>[4](#fn_682). (To him)
only that person is good, and no other (as a companion), who does
nothing in excess, and who occasions fear and injury to a taciturn
man <span id="fr_688"></span>[5](#fn_683). And his food is acceptable to
the good, who does not vex the self of a taciturn man, and who does not
destroy the property of a Brâhma*n*a <span
id="fr_689"></span>[6](#fn_684). A Brâhma*n*a should hold, that living
in the midst of kinsmen, his actions should be always unknown <span
id="fr_690"></span>[7](#fn_685); and he should not

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

think <span id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_686) (about them). What
Brâhma*n*a ought to think of the inner self, which is void of
symbols <span id="fr_692"></span>[2](#fn_687), immovable, pure, and free
from all pairs of opposites, in this way <span
id="fr_693"></span>[3](#fn_688)? What sin is not committed by that
thief, who steals away his own self <span
id="fr_694"></span>[4](#fn_689), who regards his self as one thing, when
it is a different thing. The far-seeing Brâhma*n*a, who knows the
Brahman, is not wearied <span id="fr_695"></span>[5](#fn_690), he
receives nothing <span id="fr_696"></span>[6](#fn_691); he is honoured,
free from trouble <span id="fr_697"></span>[7](#fn_692), and wise, but
acts as if he was not wise <span id="fr_698"></span>[8](#fn_693). As
dogs eat what is vomited, so do they, enjoying their own bravery <span
id="fr_699"></span>[9](#fn_694), eat what is vomited, always with
disaster (to themselves). Those twice-born persons, who are not

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

first <span id="fr_700"></span>[1](#fn_695) in respect of human wealth,
but who are first in the Vedas <span id="fr_701"></span>[2](#fn_696),
are unconquerable, not to be shaken <span
id="fr_702"></span>[3](#fn_697); they should be understood to be forms
of the Brahman. Whosoever may in this (world) know all the gods <span
id="fr_703"></span>[4](#fn_698)---doers of favours--he is not equal to a
Brâhma*n*a, (nor even) he, <span id="fr_704"></span>[5](#fn_699) for
whom he exerts himself. The man who makes no efforts <span
id="fr_705"></span>[6](#fn_700), and is respected, does not, being
respected, think himself. respected <span
id="fr_706"></span>[7](#fn_701), nor does he become vexed in consequence
of disrespect. One who is respected <span
id="fr_707"></span>[8](#fn_702) should think it to be a natural
operation of people, like their opening or closing of the eyelids, that
the learned respect him in this world. One who is not respected should
think, that the deluded people who do not understand piety, and who are
devoid of (knowledge of) the world and the Sâstras, will never respect
one who is worthy of respect. Respect and taciturnity <span
id="fr_708"></span>[9](#fn_703), verily, never dwell together; for this
world is (the field) for respect, the next for taciturnity, as is
understood <span id="fr_709"></span>[10](#fn_704). For worldly wealth
dwells in the

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

sphere of respect <span id="fr_710"></span>[1](sbe0824.htm#fn_705), and
that, too, is an obstacle <span
id="fr_711"></span>[2](sbe0824.htm#fn_706). While the Brahmic
wealth <span id="fr_712"></span>[3](sbe0824.htm#fn_707), O Kshatriya! is
difficult to be attained by any one devoid of knowledge. The ways (to
it) are stated by the good to be of various descriptions, and difficult
to reach--truth, straightforwardness, modesty <span
id="fr_713"></span>[4](sbe0824.htm#fn_708), restraint (of senses),
purity, knowledge, which are the six impediments (in the way) of respect
and delusion.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_611"></span>[151:1](sbe0822.htm#fr_614) Comp. Gîtâ passim;
disgust, scil. that resulting from a general dissatisfaction with
everything. As to 'ruin and prosperity,' Nîlaka*nth*a adds, 'and their
causes, sin and merit.'

<span id="fn_612"></span>[151:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_615) Literally
'respected.' Nîlaka*nth*a says it means rejoiced over, for
Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra thought, that, in spite of his treachery he was safe,
as death was taught by Sanatsu*g*âta to have no existence.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[151:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_616) I. e. free from the
presence of ignorant and vulgar people. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
68](sbe0808.htm#page_68) supra.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[151:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_617) I. e. knowledge
concerning the supreme Self.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[151:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_618) *S*a<u>n</u>kara's
construction seems different, but is not quite clear. He says, 'wishing
to become--Brahman--the meaning is wishing to acquire the self lost
through ignorance.'

<span id="fn_616"></span>[151:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_619) I. e. imparted to
your pupils, *S*a<u>n</u>kara adds; 'heard,' scil. from Vidura.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[151:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_620) The construction is
imperfect, but the sense is clear: is your <span id="page_152">p.
152</span> view correct, or the view involved in the practice of gods
and demons?

<span id="fn_618"></span>[152:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_621) See Gîtâ, [p.
69](sbe0808.htm#page_69) supra; Ka*th*opanishad, p. 102; Pra*s*na, p.
162. As to the gods being afraid of death, see *Kh*ândogya, p. 50; and
N*ri*si*m*ha Tâpinî, p. 32; and as to gods and demons practising the
life of Brahma*k*ârins, see *Kh*ândogya, p. 571; and cf.
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 964.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[152:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_622) I. e. action
prescribed in the Vedas.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[152:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_623) I. e. as to how I
shall be able to reconcile the seeming contradiction between the 'two
truths.'

<span id="fn_621"></span>[152:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_624) I. e. of creation.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[152:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_625) Sanatsu*g*âta says
he differs from 'the wise;' delusion = thinking the not-self to be the
self; heedlessness = falling off from one's natural condition as the
Brahman--which is the cause of delusion (*S*a<u>n</u>kara). See [p.
153](#page_153) infra; Ka*th*a, 152; and Taittirîya-upanishad, p. 80.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[152:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_626) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
suggests that demons might mean creatures attached to worldly objects;
and gods those who are pleased in their own self; and he cites a stanza
in support of this suggestion. The allusion, however, seems to be
plainly to the story at *Kh*ândogya, p. 571 seq., where the idea and
expression of 'being vanquished' also occurs (p. 583). That word
*S*a<u>n</u>kara interprets in connexion with his suggested
interpretation to mean 'are born in lower species.' See *Kh*ândogya, p.
585, and Maitrî, p. 211, about asuras or demons. It is interesting to
note that in the Introduction to the Mahâbhâshya, there is an allusion
to a story of the 'demons' being 'vanquished' in consequence of their
grammatical blunders.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[153:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_627) Those deluded by
worldly objects; 'this' means 'heedlessness.'

<span id="fn_625"></span>[153:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_628) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
cites a stanza from Manu, which says that king Yama Vaivasvata dwells in
the heart of every one. Cf. Aitareya-upanishad, p. 187. The following
clause he understands to contain two epithets of Yama, meaning
'immortal, and intent on the Brahman.' I follow Nîlaka*nth*a, but not
very confidently.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[153:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_629) Here we have the
developments, the varying forms, of death or heedlessness.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[153:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_630) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
57](sbe0805.htm#page_57). I. e. paths contrary to *S*rutis and
*S*m*ri*tis.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[153:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_631) Concentration of
mind on the self or Brahman.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[153:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_632) I. e. the egoism
spoken of before.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[153:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_633) I. e. to this
mortal world. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 84](sbe0811.htm#page_84), and
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, pp. 855, 856. There = from the next world.
*S*a<u>n</u>kara says, 'having lived there.'

<span id="fn_631"></span>[153:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_634) I.e. the senses.
Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 123](sbe0820.htm#page_123), and inter alia Î*s*opanishad,
p. 10.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[153:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_635) Cf. Ka*th*a, p.
129, and B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 889.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[153:10](sbe0823.htm#fr_636) I. e. the fruit.
Cf. Ka*th*a, p. 155, and Mu*nd*aka, p. 317.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[154:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_637) I. e. its identity
with the Brahman.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[154:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_638) I. e. in various
forms of life, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[154:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_639) The going about in
search of enjoyments.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[154:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_640) The contact leads
to pondering on them, and that to desire, &c., as described further on.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[154:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_641) Through various
lives. Birth and death are certain for him.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[154:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_642) I. e. causes
oblivion of his real nature, *S*a<u>n</u>kara. Cf. the whole train of
cause and effect at Gîtâ, [p. 50](sbe0804.htm#page_50) supra.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[154:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_643) I. e. the
pondering, desire, wrath, &c. As to I children,' cf. Ka*th*a, pp. 96 and
123, where bâla is contrasted with dhîra, as here. The 'good sense' is
of help in withstanding the temptations of worldly objects.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[154:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_644) Destroys =
abandons; pondering, just before this, is rendered by *S*a<u>n</u>kara
to mean 'thinking of the objects as transient, impure,' &c.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[154:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_645) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
cites on this a stanza of unknown authorship, which says, 'The learned
and clever man who knows the self, and by discrimination destroys all
objects of sense, is said to be the death of death.' See too [p.
178](sbe0825.htm#page_178) infra.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[155:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_646) On this
Nîlaka*nth*a quotes these lines, 'The antelope, elephant, butterfly,
bee, and fish--these five are destroyed by the five,' i. e. the five
objects of sense, sound, &c. See *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap.
174, st. 45.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[155:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_647) I. e. misery,
Nîlaka*nth*a; merit or sin, *S*a<u>n</u>kara.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[155:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_648) I. e. void of
discrimination between the real and unreal, Nîlaka*nth*a; result of
ignorance, *S*a<u>n</u>kara. 'A hell, as being full of filth,' says
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, 'such as, phlegm, blood, excretions.' Cf. Maitrî, p.
48.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[155:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_649) As blind men
groping about fall into a ditch, so do these, *S*a<u>n</u>kara.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[155:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_650) I. e. other than
the sensuous objects he loves; 'learns nothing' about the supreme Self
which he disregards.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[155:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_651) Useless for any
good purpose.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[155:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_652) Cf.
Taittirîya-upanishad, p. 102.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[155:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_653) As being ruinous to
oneself. *S*a<u>n</u>kara compares Gîtâ, [p. 68](sbe0808.htm#page_68).
Cf. also Taittirîya-upanishad, p. 103, and see B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p.
61.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[155:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_654) I. e. heedlessness
and its developments as stated.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[155:10](sbe0823.htm#fr_655) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
cites on this Taittirîya-upanishad, p. 78

<span id="fn_653"></span>[155:11](sbe0823.htm#fr_656) Such as Satyaloka,
&c.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[156:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_657) *G*yotish*t*oma,
A*s*vamedha, and other rites.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[156:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_658) As leading to final
emancipation.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[156:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_659) I. e. objects for
which various ceremonies (or 'actions') should be performed.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[156:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_660) I. e. the man of
knowledge.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[156:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_661) I. e. into the
sphere of action. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).

<span id="fn_659"></span>[156:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_662) Knowing the supreme
self is identical with becoming the supreme self, Mu*nd*aka, p. 323.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[156:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_663) I. e. getting rid
of the paths which keep one away from the Brahman by means of
contemplation of the Brahman, &c. Nîlaka*nth*a renders 'right path' to
mean the Sushum*n*â passage by which the soul proceeds to final
emancipation, see *Kh*ândogya, p. 570; Ka*th*a, p. 157.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[156:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_664) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
says: 'Having shown that true death is heedlessness, and having shown
that heedlessness in its forms of anger &c. is the cause of all evil,
and having also shown that death is destroyed by true knowledge, and
having shown further that heaven &c. are really not man's highest goal;
the author has also implied the unity of the supreme and individual
self. On that arises a doubt, which is stated in this passage.'

<span id="fn_662"></span>[156:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_665) All this = all the
developments of the Brahman, i. e. space, wind, fire, water, earth,
vegetation, food, living creatures; see Taittirîyopanishad, p. 68.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[157:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_666) What is the purpose
of its existence, and what misery does it undergo on entering the course
of worldly life?

<span id="fn_664"></span>[157:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_667) 'The danger,' says
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, 'is that of contravening Vedic texts such as "I am the
Brahman," "Thou art that," &c.' May it not rather be that pointed out at
Ka*th*opanishad, p. 129, viz. never attaining final emancipation? Cf.
also N*ri*si*m*ha Tâpinî, p. 223.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[157:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_668) The individual
selfs, *S*a<u>n</u>kara.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[157:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_671) Nature or mâyâ.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[157:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_670) The appearance of
degradation to an inferior state being delusive.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[157:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_672) The original word
implies the possession of ai*s*varya, dharma, ya*s*as, *s*rî, vairâgya,
moksha. See *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 329 (where the list is slightly
different). For another definition, see Maitrî, p. 6 (gloss).

<span id="fn_669"></span>[157:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_673) See note , [p.
156](#page_156).

<span id="fn_670"></span>[157:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_674) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
says: 'The question of Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra having suggested a difference
between two principles, one of which constrains, and the other of which
is constrained, the answer is--Such a difference ought not to be
alleged, as it involves "danger." Then the question arises, How is the
difference, which does appear to be explained? The reply is, It is due
to the beginningless principle--delusion or ignorance. The next sentence
shows that the universe as it appears is also a result of delusion.'
Nîlaka*nth*a says expressly, changes = delusion. He renders the original
which we have translated by 'beginningless' first, to mean 'collection
of objects of enjoyments.' *S*a<u>n</u>kara's explanation seems
tautological as regards the words 'connexion with the beginningless,'
which occur twice in the above. Nîlaka*nth*a's <span id="page_158">p.
158</span> is not quite clear. May the expression on the second occasion
mean, that the connexion by which beings are stated before to exist has
had no beginning--has existed from eternity? The translation should then
run thus: 'And beings exist by a connexion which had no beginning;' (see
Sâriraka Bhâshya, p. 494.) Connexions of things = creation of universe
by his power.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[158:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_675) E. g. Agnish*t*oma,
&c., *S*a<u>n</u>kara.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[158:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_676) I. e. impiety or
piety, sin or merit.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[158:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_679) In *S*rutis and
Sm*ri*tis, which *S*a<u>n</u>kara quotes. *Kh*ândogya, p. 622;
Mu*nd*aka, p. 309; B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 911. See, too, Maitrî, p. 131.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[158:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_678) Of the man devoid
of knowledge.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[158:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_680) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
76](sbe0809.htm#page_76), and B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 636.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[158:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_681) See [p.
164](sbe0824.htm#page_164), note  [9](sbe0824.htm#fn_726) infra.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[158:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_682) The feeling of
one's own superiority over others in piety.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[158:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_683) In the shape of
Nakshatras,' says *S*a<u>n</u>kara, which is not quite intelligible. See
*Kh*ândogya, p. 258, and Anugîtâ infra, [p. 240](sbe0829.htm#page_240).

<span id="fn_679"></span>[159:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_684) According to the
Vedântic theory, the acts of piety purify the inner man, and are thus a
stepping-stone to knowledge. See Introduction, [p.
147](sbe0821.htm#page_147) supra. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
122](sbe0820.htm#page_122); and B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 899.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[159:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_685) I. e. physical,
mental, and such as is caused by superhuman agency. This is
*S*a<u>n</u>kara's explanation. It is somewhat far fetched, but I can
find none better. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 49](sbe0804.htm#page_49). And see also
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 876, and the commentary of *S*a<u>n</u>kara there
with Ânandagiri's gloss.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[159:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_686) E. g. wife,
children, &c.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[159:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_687) I. e. vexed as to
how his livelihood is to be earned, &c.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[159:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_688) Excess, e.g. too
much obsequiousness towards a 'taciturn man,' owing to his holiness, &c.
Taciturn man = ascetic. Injury = disrespect, &c. Perhaps the protest
against worldliness is here carried to an extreme. *S*a<u>n</u>kara
cites Manu as a parallel, 'A Brâhma*n*a should be afraid of (worldly)
respect as of poison.'

<span id="fn_684"></span>[159:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_689) E.g. the Ku*s*a
grass, deerskin, &c., mentioned at Gîtâ, [p. 68](sbe0808.htm#page_68).

<span id="fn_685"></span>[159:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_690) I. e. he should not
parade his actions. *S*a<u>n</u>kara compares Vasish*th*a and a Vedic
text. See, too, the quotation at Taitt. Âra*n*. p. 902.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[160:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_691) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
103](sbe0815.htm#page_103). *S*a<u>n</u>kara suggests an alternative
explanation of this stanza, which will make it mean that one performing
the operations of the senses, should devote oneself nevertheless to the
unknown principle, and not consider the senses to be the self.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[160:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_692) I. e. beyond the
reach of inference; 'subtle,' says *S*a<u>n</u>kara. Cf.
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 364; B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 855; Maitrî, p. 182;
and Ka*th*a, p. 149, where *S*a<u>n</u>kara suggests a somewhat
different meaning. As to immovable, cf. Î*s*a, p. 10, and Gîtâ, [p.
104](sbe0815.htm#page_104). *S*a<u>n</u>kara renders it by 'void of
activity;' and pure he paraphrases by 'free from ignorance and other
taints.'

<span id="fn_688"></span>[160:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_693) It is difficult to
say what 'in this way' refers to. *S*a<u>n</u>kara renders it by 'as
possessing qualities appertaining to the two kinds of body.' On
*S*a<u>n</u>kara's suggested meaning of the stanza preceding (see note
 [1](#fn_686)), it would refer to the confusion of the senses with the
self.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[160:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_694) Such a person is
called a destroyer of his own self at Î*s*opanishad, p. 9.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[160:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_695) I. e. by the
troubles of worldly life.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[160:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_696) Cf. 'without
belongings' at Gîtâ, [p. 128](sbe0820.htm#page_128).

<span id="fn_692"></span>[160:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_697) Anger and other
obstacles to concentration of mind.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[160:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_698) I. e.
unintelligent. The text of Vasish*th*a referred to in note
 [7](#fn_685), [p. 159](#page_159), says he should act like an
unintelligent man. Cf. also Gau*d*apâda-kârikâs, p. 443, and *S*âriraka
Bhâshya, p. 1041.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[160:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_699) I. e. singing the
praises of their own greatness and worth, instead of keeping their
'conduct unknown.'

<span id="fn_695"></span>[161:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_700) Highly esteemed for
or strongly attached to, *S*a<u>n</u>kara. Human wealth = wife,
offspring, property, &c. Cf. *Kh*ândogya, p. 319; B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p.
262.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[161:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_701) I. e. veracity and
other duties taught by the Vedas.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[161:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_702) 'They need fear
nought,' says Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[161:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_703) I. e. may sacrifice
to them, *S*a<u>n</u>kara.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[161:5](sbe0823.htm#fr_704) Not even the deity
to whom the sacrifice is offered is equal to one who knows the Brahman.
Cf. Taittirîya, p. 23, and. Anugîtâ, [p. 250](sbe0831.htm#page_250).

<span id="fn_700"></span>[161:6](sbe0823.htm#fr_705) I. e. one who is
'taciturn' and does not parade his greatness.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[161:7](sbe0823.htm#fr_706) He does not care
for the respect shown him.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[161:8](sbe0823.htm#fr_707) Because he knows
the Brahman.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[161:9](sbe0823.htm#fr_708) I. e. restraint of
all senses, not of speech only. For the contrast compare that between
*s*reya and preya at Ka*th*a, p. 92.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[161:10](sbe0823.htm#fr_709) I. e. by all men
of understanding. *S*a<u>n</u>kara's rendering is different: 'The next,
which is known as Tad, is for taciturnity.' He cites for this Gîtâ, [p.
120](sbe0819.htm#page_120).
