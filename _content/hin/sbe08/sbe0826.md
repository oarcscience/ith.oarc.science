# CHAPTER VI.

That pure <span id="fr_899"></span>[1](#fn_894), great light <span
id="fr_900"></span>[2](#fn_895), which is radiant; that great
glory <span id="fr_901"></span>[3](#fn_896); that, verily, which the
gods worship <span id="fr_902"></span>[4](#fn_897); that by means of
which the sun shines forth <span id="fr_903"></span>[5](#fn_898)--that
eternal divine being is perceived by devotees. From (that) pure
(principle) the Brahman <span id="fr_904"></span>[6](#fn_899) is
produced; by (that) pure (principle) the Brahman is developed <span
id="fr_905"></span>[7](#fn_900); that pure (principle), not illumined
among all radiant (bodies), is (itself) luminous and illuminates
(them) <span id="fr_906"></span>[8](#fn_901). That eternal divine being
is perceived by devotees. The perfect is raised out of the perfect. It
(being raised) out of the perfect is called the perfect. The perfect is
withdrawn from the perfect, and the perfect only remains <span
id="fr_907"></span>[9](#fn_902). That eternal divine being is perceived
by devotees.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (From the Brahman), the waters <span
id="fr_908"></span>[1](#fn_903) (are produced); and then from the
waters, the gross body. In the space within that <span
id="fr_909"></span>[2](#fn_904), dwelt the two divine (principles). Both
enveloping the quarters and sub-quarters, support earth and heaven <span
id="fr_910"></span>[3](#fn_905). That eternal divine being is perceived
by devotees. The horse <span id="fr_911"></span>[4](#fn_906)(-like
senses) lead towards heaven him, who is possessed of knowledge and
divine, (who is) free from old age, and who stands on the wheel of this
chariot(-like body), which is transient, but the operations of which are
imperishable <span id="fr_912"></span>[5](#fn_907). That eternal divine
being <span id="fr_913"></span>[6](#fn_908) is perceived by devotees.
His form has no parallel <span id="fr_914"></span>[7](#fn_909); no one
sees him with the eye <span id="fr_915"></span>[8](#fn_910). Those who
apprehend him by means, of the understanding, and also the mind and
heart, become immortal <span id="fr_916"></span>[9](#fn_911). That
eternal

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

divine being is perceived by devotees. The currents of twelve
collections <span id="fr_917"></span>[1](#fn_912), supported by the
Deity, regulate the honey <span id="fr_918"></span>[2](#fn_913); and
those who follow after it move about in (this) dangerous (world). That
eternal divine being <span id="fr_919"></span>[3](#fn_914) is perceived
by devotees. The bee <span id="fr_920"></span>[4](#fn_915) drinks that
accumulated honey for half a month <span
id="fr_921"></span>[5](#fn_916). The Lord created the oblation for all
beings <span id="fr_922"></span>[6](#fn_917). That eternal divine being
is perceived by devotees. Those who are devoid of wings <span
id="fr_923"></span>[7](#fn_918), coming

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

to the A*s*vattha of golden leaves <span
id="fr_924"></span>[1](#fn_919), there become possessed of wings, and
fly away happily <span id="fr_925"></span>[2](#fn_920). That eternal
divine being <span id="fr_926"></span>[3](#fn_921) is perceived by
devotees. The upward life-wind swallows up the downward life-wind; the
moon swallows up the upward life-wind; the sun swallows up the
moon <span id="fr_927"></span>[4](#fn_922); and another <span
id="fr_928"></span>[5](#fn_923), swallows up the sun. Moving about above
the waters, the supreme self <span id="fr_929"></span>[6](#fn_924) does
not raise one leg <span id="fr_930"></span>[7](#fn_925). (Should he
raise) that, which is always performing sacrifices <span
id="fr_931"></span>[8](#fn_926), there will be no death, no
immortality <span id="fr_932"></span>[9](#fn_927). That eternal divine
being <span id="fr_933"></span>[10](#fn_928) is perceived by devotees.

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The being which is the inner self, and which is
of the size of a thumb <span id="fr_934"></span>[1](#fn_929), is always
migrating in consequence of the connexion with the subtle body <span
id="fr_935"></span>[2](#fn_930). The deluded ones do not perceive that
praiseworthy lord, primeval and radiant, and possessed of creative
power <span id="fr_936"></span>[3](#fn_931). That eternal divine being
is perceived by devotees. Leading mortals to destruction by their own
action <span id="fr_937"></span>[4](#fn_932), they conceal themselves
like serpents in secret recesses, <span id="fr_938"></span>[5](#fn_933).
The deluded men then become more deluded <span
id="fr_939"></span>[6](#fn_934). The enjoyments afforded by them cause
delusion, and lead to worldly life <span
id="fr_940"></span>[7](#fn_935). That eternal divine being <span
id="fr_941"></span>[8](#fn_936) is perceived by devotees. This <span
id="fr_942"></span>[9](#fn_937) seems to be common to all
mankind--whether possessed of resources <span
id="fr_943"></span>[10](#fn_938) or not possessed of resources--it is
common to immortality and the other <span
id="fr_944"></span>[11](#fn_939). Those who are possessed (of
them) <span id="fr_945"></span>[12](#fn_940) attain there to the source
of the honey <span id="fr_946"></span>[13](#fn_941). That eternal divine
being is perceived by devotees. They go,

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

pervading both worlds by knowledge <span
id="fr_947"></span>[1](#fn_942). Then the Agnihotra though not performed
is (as good as) performed <span id="fr_948"></span>[2](#fn_943). Your
(knowledge) of the Brahman, therefore, will not lead you to
littleness <span id="fr_949"></span>[3](#fn_944). Knowledge is
(his) <span id="fr_950"></span>[4](#fn_945) name. To that the talented
ones attain. That eternal divine being is perceived by devotees. The
self of this description absorbing the material cause <span
id="fr_951"></span>[5](#fn_946) becomes great. And the self of him who
understands that being is not degraded here <span
id="fr_952"></span>[6](#fn_947). That eternal divine being is perceived
by devotees. One should ever and always be doing good. (There is) no
death, whence (can there be) immortality <span
id="fr_953"></span>[7](#fn_948)? The real and the unreal have both the
same real (entity) as their basis. The source of the existent and the
non-existent is but one <span id="fr_954"></span>[8](#fn_949). That
eternal divine being is perceived by devotees. The

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

being who is the inner self, and who is of the size of a thumb, is not
seen, being placed in the heart <span id="fr_955"></span>[1](#fn_950).
He is unborn, is moving about day and night, without sloth. Meditating
on him, a wise man remains placid <span id="fr_956"></span>[2](#fn_951).
That eternal divine being is perceived by devotees. From him comes the
wind <span id="fr_957"></span>[3](#fn_952); in him, likewise, is
(everything) dissolved. From him (come) the fire and the moon; and from
him comes life <span id="fr_958"></span>[4](#fn_953). That is the
support (of the universe); that is immortal; that is all things
perceptible <span id="fr_959"></span>[5](#fn_954); that is the Brahman,
that glory. From that all entities were produced; and in that (they) are
dissolved <span id="fr_960"></span>[6](#fn_955). That eternal divine
being is perceived by devotees. The brilliant (Brahman) supports the two
divine principles <span id="fr_961"></span>[7](#fn_956) and the
universe, earth and heaven, and the quarters. He from whom the rivers
flow in (various) directions, from him were created the great
oceans <span id="fr_962"></span>[8](#fn_957). That eternal divine being
is perceived by devotees. Should one fly, even after furnishing oneself
with thousands upon thousands of wings, and even though one should have
the velocity of thought <span id="fr_963"></span>[9](#fn_958), one would
never reach the end of the (great) cause <span
id="fr_964"></span>[10](#fn_959). That eternal divine

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

being is perceived by devotees. His form dwells in the unperceived <span
id="fr_965"></span>[1](#fn_960); and those whose understandings are very
well refined <span id="fr_966"></span>[2](#fn_961) perceive him. The
talented man who has got rid (of affection and aversion) perceives (him)
by the mind. Those who understand him <span
id="fr_967"></span>[3](#fn_962) become immortal. When one sees this self
in all beings stationed in various places <span
id="fr_968"></span>[4](#fn_963), what should one grieve for after
that <span id="fr_969"></span>[5](#fn_964)? The Brâhma*n*a has (as much
interest) in all beings, as in a big reservoir of water, to which waters
flow from all sides <span id="fr_970"></span>[6](#fn_965). I alone am
your mother <span id="fr_971"></span>[7](#fn_966), father,

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

and I too am the son. And I am the self of all this--that which exists
and that which does not exist <span id="fr_972"></span>[1](#fn_967). (I
am) the aged grandfather of this, the father, and the son, O descendant
of Bharata! You dwell in my self only <span
id="fr_973"></span>[2](#fn_968). You are not mine, nor I (yours). The
self only is my seat <span id="fr_974"></span>[3](#fn_969); the self too
is (the source of) my birth <span id="fr_975"></span>[4](#fn_970). I am
woven through and through <span id="fr_976"></span>[5](#fn_971)
(everything). And my seat is free from (the attacks of) old age <span
id="fr_977"></span>[6](#fn_972). I am unborn, moving about day and
night, without sloth. Knowing (me), verily, a wise man remains
placid <span id="fr_978"></span>[7](#fn_973). Minuter than an atom <span
id="fr_979"></span>[8](#fn_974), possessed of a good mind <span
id="fr_980"></span>[9](#fn_975), I am stationed within all beings <span
id="fr_981"></span>[10](#fn_976). (The wise) know the father of all
beings to be placed in the lotus <span
id="fr_982"></span>[11](#fn_977)(-like heart of every one).

<span id="fn_898"></span>[186:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_903) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
112](sbe0817.htm#page_112), note .

<span id="fn_899"></span>[186:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_904) 'Named
Hira*n*yagarbha,' *S*a<u>n</u>kara. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.

Maitrî, p. 130; Taitt. Âra*n*. p. 894.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[186:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_905) 'In the form of
Virâ*g*,' says *S*a<u>n</u>kara. As to these two, cf. Mu*nd*aka, pp.
270-272; and *S*a<u>n</u>kara's and Ânandagiri's notes there. See also
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, pp. 324, 325; and N*ri*si*m*ha Tâpinî, pp. 233, 234;
Colebrooke, Essays, pp. 344, 368 (Madras reprint). The Virâ*g*
corresponds rather to the gross material world viewed as a whole; the
Hira*n*yagarbha to the subtle elements similarly viewed, an earlier
stage in the development. Cf. the Vedântasâra.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[186:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_906) Cf. Mundaka, p.
303, and Gîtâ, [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112).

<span id="fn_902"></span>[186:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_907) The individual self
is part of the supreme (Gîtâ, [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112)); perfect =
not limited by space, time, &c.; as being part of a thing perfect in its
essence, the individual soul also is perfect. The individual self is
withdrawn from the perfect, viz. the whole aggregate of body, senses,
&c. presided over by the self, and when so withdrawn it appears to be
the pure self only. Cf. B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 948.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[187:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_908) 'The five
elements,' says *S*a<u>n</u>kara, cf. Aitareya, p. 189; and for 'gross
body,' the original is literally 'water;' see supra, p. 179, note 6; and
see, too, Îsopanishad, p. 11, and *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 368, for
different but kindred meanings.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[187:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_909) Viz. the lotus-like
heart. Cf. *Kh*ândogya,. p. 528.

<span id="fn_905"></span>[187:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_910) The two principles
between them pervade the universe, the individual self being connected
with the material world, the other with heaven; 'divine' is, literally,
'the brilliant,' says *S*a<u>n</u>kara, who quotes Ka*th*a, p. 305, as a
parallel for the whole passage.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[187:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_911) Cf. Ka*th*a, p.
111; Maitrî, pp. 19-34; and Mahâbhârata Strî Parvan, chap. VII, St. 13.
Heaven = the Brahman here (see B*ri*hadâranyaka, p. 876); divine = not
vulgar, or unrefined-*S*a<u>n</u>kara, who adds that though the senses
generally lead one to sensuous objects, they do not do so when under the
guidance of true knowledge.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[187:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_912) The body is
perishable, but action done by the self while in the body leaves its
effect.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[187:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_913) To whom, namely,
the man of knowledge goes, as before stated.

<span id="fn_909"></span>[187:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_914) Cf.
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 347.

<span id="fn_910"></span>[187:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_915) Cf. Ka*th*a, p.
152, and comment there, where the eye is said to stand for all the
senses.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[187:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_916) Ka*th*a, p. 149;
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, pp. 346-348, also p. 330 (should it be manîshâ there
instead of manvi*s*o ?). The meanings of the three words are difficult
to fix accurately. *S*a<u>n</u>kara varies in his interpretations. <span
id="page_188">p. 188</span> Probably the meaning he gives here is the
best. Mind and understanding have been explained at Gîtâ, [p.
57](sbe0805.htm#page_57). The heart is the place within, where the self
is said to be, and it may be taken as indicating the self, the meaning
would then be--a direct consciousness in the self of its unity with the
Supreme. See, too, Taitt Âra*n*. p.896.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[188:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_917) The five organs of
action, the five senses of perception, the mind and understanding make
the twelve.

<span id="fn_913"></span>[188:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_918) Each current has
its own honey regularly distributed to it under the supervision of the
Deity, the Supreme. Honey = material enjoyment. Cf. Ka*th*a, p. 126,
where *S*a<u>n</u>kara renders it by karmaphala, 'fruit of action.'

<span id="fn_914"></span>[188:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_919) Who supervises the
distribution as stated. Cf. Vedânta-sûtra III, 2, 28-31.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[188:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_920) Bhramara, which the
commentators interpret to mean 'one who is given to flying about--the
individual self.'

<span id="fn_916"></span>[188:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_921) I. e. in one life
in respect of actions done in a previous life.

<span id="fn_917"></span>[188:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_922) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
says this is in answer to a possible difficulty that action performed
here cannot have its fruit in the next world, as the fruit is so far
removed in time from the action. The answer is, The Lord, the Supreme,
can effect this, and taking his existence into account there is no
difficulty. Oblation = food, &c., *S*a<u>n</u>kara. The meaning of the
whole passage, which is not very clear, seems to be that the Lord has
arranged things so that each being receives some of this honey, this
food, which is the fruit of his own action. Then the question arises, Do
these beings always continue taking the honey and 'migrating,' or are
they ever released? That is answered by the following sentence.

<span id="fn_918"></span>[188:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_923) 'The wings of
knowledge,' says *S*a<u>n</u>kara, citing a Brâhma*n*a text, those,
verily, who have knowledge are possessed of wings, those who are not
possessed of knowledge are devoid of wings.'

<span id="fn_919"></span>[189:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_924) So, literally;
*S*a<u>n</u>kara explains 'golden' to mean beneficial and pleasant,' by
a somewhat fanciful derivation of the word hira*n*ya. He refers to Gîtâ,
[p. 111](sbe0817.htm#page_111), about the leaves of the A*s*vattha.
Nîlaka*nth*a takes the leaves to be son, wife, &c., which are 'golden,'
attractive at first sight. 'Coming to the A*s*vattha,' *S*a<u>n</u>kara
says, means being born as a Brâhma*n*a,' &c. 'Flying away' = obtaining
final emancipation.

<span id="fn_920"></span>[189:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_925) The 'selfs' are
compared to birds in the famous passage at Mu*nd*aka, p. 306 (also
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 337). See also B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 499.

<span id="fn_921"></span>[189:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_926) Knowledge of whom
leads to 'flying away happily.'

<span id="fn_922"></span>[189:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_927) Cf. *Kh*ândogya, p.
441. *S*a<u>n</u>kara says that the author here explains the yoga by
which the Supreme is to be attained. As to the life-winds, cf. Gîtâ, [p.
61](sbe0806.htm#page_61). 'The moon,' says *S*a<u>n</u>kara, 'means the
mind, and the sun the understanding, as they are the respective deities
of those organs' (cf. B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, pp. 521-542, and Aitareya, p.
187, where, however, the sun is said to appertain to the eye).

<span id="fn_923"></span>[189:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_928) I. e. the Brahman;
the result is, one remains in the condition of being identified with the
Brahman.

<span id="fn_924"></span>[189:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_929) Literally,
flamingo. Cf. *S*vetâ*s*vatara, pp. 332, 367; see also p. 289; Maitrî,
p. 99; and the commentary on *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 283.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[189:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_930) Viz. the individual
self, *S*a<u>n</u>kara; that is, as it were, the bond of connexion
between the Supreme and the world. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
112](sbe0817.htm#page_112).

<span id="fn_926"></span>[189:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_931) This is the
meaning, though the word in the original is *Ri*tvi*g*, which in the
later literature only means priest.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[189:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_932) As the whole of the
material world is dissolved, when the self is dissevered from the
delusion which is the cause of it.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[189:10](sbe0826.htm#fr_933) Viz. who moves
about on the waters, as above stated.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[190:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_934) *S*vetâ*s*vatara,
pp. 330-355; Taitt. Âra*n*. p. 858, and comments there.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[190:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_935) The life-winds, the
ten organs or senses, mind, and understanding. See the same word
similarly interpreted at *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 306, and Sankhya-sûtra
III, 9.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[190:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_936) According to
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, he who makes the distinct entities, after entering
into them; he alludes apparently to *Kh*ândogya, p. 407.

<span id="fn_932"></span>[190:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_937) Namely, that of
giving the poison of sensuous objects.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[190:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_938) I. e. the eye, ear,
&c., like the holes of serpents.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[190:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_939) I. e. can
appreciate nought but those sensuous objects.

<span id="fn_935"></span>[190:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_940) One reading is,
'lead to danger' = which means 'to hell,' according to Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[190:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_941) Scil. delusion
about whom leads to 'danger' or 'worldly life.'

<span id="fn_937"></span>[190:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_942) The quality of
being one with the Brahman in essence.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[190:10](sbe0826.htm#fr_943) Self-restraint,
tranquillity, &c.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[190:11](sbe0826.htm#fr_944) I. e. whether in
the midst of worldly life, or in the state of perfect emancipation.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[190:12](sbe0826.htm#fr_945) Viz. the resources
spoken of before.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[190:13](sbe0826.htm#fr_946) Viz. the supreme
Brahman. 'There' *S*a<u>n</u>kara takes to mean 'in the supreme abode of
Vish*n*u.' See Introduction.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[191:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_947) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
does not explain this. Nîlaka*nth*a says pervading = fully
understanding; both worlds = the self and the not-self. Is the meaning
something like that of the passage last cited by *S*a<u>n</u>kara under
Vedânta-sûtra IV, 2, 14?

<span id="fn_943"></span>[191:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_948) He obtains the
fruit of it, *S*a<u>n</u>kara. See as to Agnihotra, *Kh*ândogya, p. 381
seq.; and Vedânta-sûtra IV, 1, 16.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[191:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_949) I. e. this mortal
world, as action &c. would do.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[191:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_950) I. e. of one who
understands himself to be the Brahman. See Aitareya-upanishad, p. 246.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[191:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_951) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
says, 'the cause in which all is absorbed.' Cf. a similar, but not
identical, meaning given to Vai*s*vânara at *Kh*ândogya, p. 264; and see
Vedânta-sûtra I, 2, 24. Becomes great = becomes the Brahman,
*S*a<u>n</u>kara.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[191:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_952) Even in this body,
*S*a<u>n</u>kara; degradation he takes to mean departure from the body,
citing Brihadâranyaka, p. 540.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[191:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_953) There is no worldly
life with birth and death for one who does good, and thinks his self to
be the Brahman; hence no emancipation from such life either.

<span id="fn_949"></span>[191:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_954) The Brahman is the
real, and on that the unreal material world is imagined. Cf. Taittirîya,
p. 97, and *S*a<u>n</u>kara's comments there, which are of use in
understanding this passage.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[192:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_955) Cf. Ka*th*a, pp.
130, 157; and B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 360.

<span id="fn_951"></span>[192:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_956) Cf.
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 342; Ka*th*a, pp. 100, 107; Maitrî, p. 134.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[192:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_957) Cf. Taittirîya, p.
67; Ka*th*a, p. 146; Mu*nd*aka, p. 293.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[192:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_958) Ka*th*a, p. 298;
Mu*nd*aka, p. 288.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[192:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_959) See [p.
180](sbe0825.htm#page_180), note .

<span id="fn_955"></span>[192:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_960) See [p.
180](sbe0825.htm#page_180) supra.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[192:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_961) 'The individual
soul, and God,' say the commentators, the latter being distinct from the
supreme self. 'The universe,' says Nîlaka*nth*a, 'means earth,' &c., by
which I suppose he means earth, heaven, quarters, mentioned directly
afterwards.

<span id="fn_957"></span>[192:8](sbe0826.htm#fr_962) Ka*th*a, p. 293.

<span id="fn_958"></span>[192:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_963) This figure is
implied in the Îsopanishad, p. 10.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[192:10](sbe0826.htm#fr_964) 'Therefore it is
endless,' says *S*a<u>n</u>kara; and as to this, cf. Taittirîya, p. 51.

<span id="fn_960"></span>[193:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_965) 'In a sphere beyond
the reach of perception,' says *S*a<u>n</u>kara, who also quotes
Ka*th*a, p. 149, or *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 347, where the same line also
occurs.

<span id="fn_961"></span>[193:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_966) The original for
understandings is sattva, which *S*a<u>n</u>kara renders to mean
anta*h*kara*n*a. 'Refined,' he says, 'by sacrifices and other
sanctifying operations.' In the Ka*th*a at p. 148 sattva is rendered by
*S*a<u>n</u>kara to mean buddhi--a common use of the word.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[193:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_967) 'As being,' says
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, 'identical with themselves.' It will be noted that the
form of expression is slightly altered here. It is not 'those who
understand this.'

<span id="fn_963"></span>[193:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_968) I. e. in different
aggregates of body, senses, &c. Cf. Gîtâ, pp.
[104](sbe0815.htm#page_104) and [124](sbe0820.htm#page_124); also
*Kh*ândogya, pp. 475-551.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[193:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_969) Cf.
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 882; *S*a<u>n</u>kara, also refers to
Î*s*opanishad, p. 14.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[193:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_970) The words are
pretty nearly the same as at Gîtâ, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).
*S*a<u>n</u>kara says, the Brâhma*n*a 'who has done all he need do' has
no interest whatever in any being, as he has none in a big reservoir,
and he cites Gîtâ, [p. 54](sbe0805.htm#page_54), in support of this. One
copy of *S*a<u>n</u>kara, however, differs from this; that runs thus:
'As a person who has done all he need do, has no interest in a big
reservoir of water, so to a Brâhma*n*a who sees the self in all beings,
there is no interest in all the actions laid down in the Vedas, &c.; as
he has obtained everything by mere perception of the self.'
Nîlaka*nth*a's reading is exactly the same as at Gîtâ, [p.
48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).

<span id="fn_966"></span>[193:7](sbe0826.htm#fr_971) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
says that Sanatsu*g*âta states here his own experiences, like Vâmadeva,
(about whom there is a reference at B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 216) and
others, to corroborate what he has already said. Cf. also Gîtâ, [p.
83](sbe0811.htm#page_83), as to the whole passage.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[194:1](sbe0826.htm#fr_972) See Gîtâ, [p.
84](sbe0811.htm#page_84). Nîlaka*nth*a takes what exists to mean
'present,' and what does not exist to mean 'past and future.' Cf.
Khândogya, p. 532.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[194:2](sbe0826.htm#fr_973) See Gîtâ, [p.
82](sbe0811.htm#page_82), where there is also a similar apparent
contradiction.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[194:3](sbe0826.htm#fr_974) Cf. *Kh*ândogya, p.
518.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[194:4](sbe0826.htm#fr_975) That is to say he
is 'unborn,' says Nîlaka*nth*a. *S*a<u>n</u>kara seems to take 'my' with
'seat' only, and not with birth; for he says, 'everything has its birth
from the self.'

<span id="fn_971"></span>[194:5](sbe0826.htm#fr_976) Cf. Mu*nd*aka, p.
298; Maitrî, p. 84, and comment there.

<span id="fn_972"></span>[194:6](sbe0826.htm#fr_977) Cf. Gîtâ, pp.
[77](sbe0809.htm#page_77), [109](sbe0816.htm#page_109), and *Kh*ândogya,
pp. 535, 550.

<span id="fn_975"></span>[194:9](sbe0826.htm#fr_980) I. e. a mind free
from affection and aversion, hatred, &c., *S*a<u>n</u>kara.

<span id="fn_976"></span>[194:10](sbe0826.htm#fr_981) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
