Thus having first a tranquil self, be obtains whatever he desires. When the quality of goodness predominates in the unperceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1938"></A><A HREF="#fn_1930"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, that fits one for immortality. The men of knowledge extol nothing else beyond goodness. By inference&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1939"></A><A HREF="#fn_1931"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> we understand the (attainment to the) being to depend on goodness. It is not possible otherwise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1940"></A><A HREF="#fn_1932"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> to attain to that being, O best of the twice-born! Forgiveness, courage, harmlessness, equability, truth, straightforwardness, knowledge, abandonment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1941"></A><A HREF="#fn_1933"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, and also renunciation are laid down as (constituting) conduct</P>

<P>of the quality of goodness. By this very inference the wise verily believe in the Being and nature as one, there is no doubt of that. Some learned. men, who are devoted to knowledge, assert the unity of the Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a and nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1942"></A><A HREF="#fn_1934"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But that is not correct. That they are always distinct (from one another) is also (said) without (due) consideration&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1943"></A><A HREF="#fn_1935"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Distinction and also association&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1944"></A><A HREF="#fn_1936"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> should be accurately understood. Unity and diversity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1945"></A><A HREF="#fn_1937"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> are likewise laid down. Such is the doctrine of the learned. Between the gnat and the udumbara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1946"></A><A HREF="#fn_1938"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> there is observed unity and diversity also. As a fish is in water distinct (from it), such is their relation; (such is) the relation of the drops of water with the leaf of the lotus.</P>

But N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a takes it to mean the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khyas, and he takes the preceding words as indicating two views based on <I>S</I>ruti texts, viz. the first, that the world is a development of the Brahman, and the other that the Brahman does not undergo any development or change. An&acirc;maya he takes to mean changeless, and Brahmamaya he takes to mean developed from the Brahman.</P>

N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a takes it to mean one who identifies himself with everything.

<P><A NAME="fn_1925"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1933">372:8</A> I. e. the goal to be acquired.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1926"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1934">372:9</A> 'Tranquillity'--the original may also be rendered by 'favour,' <A NAME="page_373"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 373</FONT></A> as to which cf. <A HREF="sbe0828.htm#page_234">p. 234</A> supra, but further on the phrase 'having a tranquil self' occurs, where the latter sense is not quite suitable. See G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0804.htm#page_51">p. 51</A>, and Yoga-s&ucirc;tra I, 33.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1927"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1935">373:1</A> I. e. the specific modes which are mentioned of control of life-winds, e. g. at G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0806.htm#page_61">p. 61</A>, or Yoga-s&ucirc;tra II, 49 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1928"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1936">373:2</A> N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a proposes two interpretations of this. He says the ten are the eight mentioned in Yoga-s&ucirc;tra II, 29, and in addition tarka and vair&acirc;gya (as to which see Yoga-s&ucirc;tra I, 15 and 17). To make up the twelve he substitutes for the last two the four named at Yoga-s&ucirc;tra I, 33. He also suggests that 'ten or twelve' may mean twenty-two, which he makes up thus. The five modes of yama (Yoga-s&ucirc;tra II, 30), five of niyama (ibid. 32), the remaining six in Yoga-s&ucirc;tra II, 29, the four in Yoga-s&ucirc;tra I, 33, and tarka and vair&acirc;gya as before.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1929"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1937">373:3</A> The twenty-four are the elements according to the S&acirc;nkhya system. See S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&acirc;ra, p. 11, and <A HREF="sbe0858.htm#page_368">p. 368</A> supra. That which is beyond them is Purusha.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1930"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1938">373:4</A> The unperceived, it should be noted, is made up of the three qualities; the predominance of goodness indicates enlightenment or knowledge. Cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0816.htm#page_108">p. 108</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1931"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1939">373:5</A> The middle term in the inference being, says Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, the enlightening effect of the quality in question.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1932"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1940">373:6</A> Cf. <A HREF="sbe0824.htm#page_167">p. 167</A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1933"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1941">373:7</A> The original is ty&acirc;ga, which Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra renders by 'abandonment of all belongings;' renunciation, scil. of fruit. Cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0819.htm#page_121">p. 121</A>, and <A HREF="sbe0817.htm#page_114">p. 114</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1934"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1942">374:1</A> Here, says N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, the author indicates an objection to the proposition stated just before. But the passage is not clear.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1935"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1943">374:2</A> This, says N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, is a reply to the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khyas, who hold the two to be distinct. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a adds, that if the two are distinct, nature will, conceivably, adhere even to an emancipated creature; and if they are one, then the being or self would be really engaging in action and so forth, and that activity being really a property of the self, could not be destroyed save by the destruction of the self. Hence that view is also wrong.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1936"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1944">374:3</A> Like that of sea and wave, N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1937"></A><A HREF="sbe0860.htm#fr_1945">374:4</A> Unity of Brahman and diversity of manifestation or nature, Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, who adds--by reason of the association they are spoken of as one, by reason of the unity and diversity they are distinct. The next sentence contains three parallel cases.</P>
