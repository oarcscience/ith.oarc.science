# CHAPTER XXX.

Brahman said:

The wheel of life <span id="fr_1780"></span>[3](#fn_1773) moves on; a
wheel of which the spoke is the understanding, of which the pole <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[4](#fn_1774) is the mind, of which the bonds are
the group of the senses, of which the outer rim <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[5](#fn_1775) is the five great elements, of which
the environment is home <span id="fr_1783"></span>[6](#fn_1776); which

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

abounds in old age and grief, which moves in the midst of disease and
misfortune, which rotates in <span id="fr_1784"></span>[1](#fn_1777)
space and time; the noise of which is trouble and toil, the
rotations <span id="fr_1785"></span>[2](#fn_1778) of which (constitute)
day and night; which is encircled with cold. and heat of which pleasure
and pain are the joints, and hunger and thirst the nails fixed into it,
of which sunshine and shade are the ruts; which staggers in the opening
or closing of an eyelid, which is enveloped in the fearful waters of
delusion, which is ever revolving and void of consciousness <span
id="fr_1786"></span>[3](#fn_1779), which is measured by months and half
months, is ever-changing <span id="fr_1787"></span>[4](#fn_1780), which
moves through (all) the worlds <span id="fr_1788"></span>[5](#fn_1781);
the mud <span id="fr_1789"></span>[6](#fn_1782) for which is penance and
regulations, the mover of which is the force of the quality of
passion <span id="fr_1790"></span>[7](#fn_1783); which is lit up <span
id="fr_1791"></span>[8](#fn_1784) by the great egoism, which is
sustained by the qualities; the fastenings in which are vexations <span
id="fr_1792"></span>[9](#fn_1785);

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

which revolves in the midst. of grief and destruction <span
id="fr_1793"></span>[1](#fn_1786), which is full of actions and
instruments of action <span id="fr_1794"></span>[2](#fn_1787), which is
large, and which is extended by means of attachments <span
id="fr_1795"></span>[3](#fn_1788), which is rendered unsteady by avarice
and desire <span id="fr_1796"></span>[4](#fn_1789), which is produced by
ignorance of various (matters) <span id="fr_1797"></span>[5](#fn_1790)
which is attended upon by fear and delusion, and which is the cause of
the delusion of all beings, which moves towards joy and pleasure <span
id="fr_1798"></span>[6](#fn_1791), which has desire and wrath as its
appurtenances, which is made up of (the entities) beginning with the
Mahat and ending with the gross elements <span
id="fr_1799"></span>[7](#fn_1792), which is unchecked, the imperishable
source (of all) <span id="fr_1800"></span>[8](#fn_1793), the speed of
which is like that of the mind, and which is (never) fatigued. This
wheel of life, which is associated with the pairs of opposites, and
which is devoid of consciousness, all the world, together with the
immortals should cast away, abridge, and check <span
id="fr_1801"></span>[9](#fn_1794). That man: among all creatures, who
always

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

accurately understands the movement and stoppage <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1](#fn_1795) of the wheel of life is never deluded.
(That) sage, released from all impressions <span
id="fr_1803"></span>[2](#fn_1796), transcending all pairs of opposites,
and released from all sins, attains the highest goal. The householder,
and the Brahma*k*ârin, the forester, and also the beggar <span
id="fr_1804"></span>[3](#fn_1797), all these four orders are stated to
have the order of householder for their basis. Whatever system of
rules <span id="fr_1805"></span>[4](#fn_1798) is prescribed in this
world, to follow it is good; this has been celebrated from ancient
times <span id="fr_1806"></span>[5](#fn_1799). He who has been first
refined by ceremonies <span id="fr_1807"></span>[6](#fn_1800), and who
has duly observed vows, being (born) in a caste of (high)
qualifications <span id="fr_1808"></span>[7](#fn_1801), and who
understands the Vedas, should return <span
id="fr_1809"></span>[8](#fn_1802) (from his preceptor's house). Always
devoted to his own wife, behaving like <span
id="fr_1810"></span>[9](#fn_1803) good men, with his senses restrained,
and full of faith, one should perform the five sacrifices <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[10](#fn_1804) in this world. The sage who eats what
remains after (offerings) to deities <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[11](#fn_1805) and guests, who is devoted to Vedic
rites, who duly performs sacrifices and

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

gifts according to his means, who is not thoughtlessly active <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1](#fn_1806) with the hand or foot, who is not
thoughtlessly active with the eye, and who is not thoughtlessly active
with his speech or any of his limbs, to such a one the (word) good
applies. One should always have the sacred thread and a clean cloth, and
be of pure vows, and self-restrained, and should always associate with
good men, making gifts, and with one's external organs restrained; one
should restrain one's lust and hunger <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[2](#fn_1807), should be kind, should behave like
the good, and keep a bamboo stick and a water-pot filled with
water <span id="fr_1815"></span>[3](#fn_1808). One should learn and
teach, should likewise perform sacrifices and officiate at others'
sacrifices, and should give and receive gifts,--(thus) one should adopt
the sixfold mode of life <span id="fr_1816"></span>[4](#fn_1809). Know
that three (of these) duties are the means of livelihood for
Brâhma*n*as, the two teaching and officiating at sacrifices, and also
receiving untainted gifts <span id="fr_1817"></span>[5](#fn_1810). And
as to the other remaining three duties, gift, study, and sacrifice, they
are pious <span id="fr_1818"></span>[6](#fn_1811) duties. With regard to
those three duties, the sage who understands piety, who is
self-restrained, kind, possessed of forgiveness, and equable to all
creatures, should avoid heedlessness <span
id="fr_1819"></span>[7](#fn_1812). The

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

Brâhmana householder, who is of rigid vows, who is thus devoted,
discharging all these duties as much as is in his power, conquers
heaven.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1771"></span>[355:1](sbe0856.htm#fr_1778) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
45](sbe0804.htm#page_45).

<span id="fn_1772"></span>[355:2](sbe0856.htm#fr_1779) All this is
action, the fruit of which is perishable; the fruit of knowledge, on the
other hand, is everlasting.

<span id="fn_1773"></span>[355:3](sbe0857.htm#fr_1780) Literally, time;
it seems, however, to stand for the vicissitudes of worldly life. Cf.
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 283. The body is called 'wheel of time' at [p.
53](sbe0805.htm#page_53) supra, but Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra there says 'it is
the wheel which causes the rotation of the wheel of time.'

<span id="fn_1774"></span>[355:4](sbe0857.htm#fr_1781) The cause of its
being large in dimensions, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra; the supporting pillar,
Nîlaka*nth*a. I prefer the former, and take the sense to be that worldly
life is co-extensive with the operations or 'fancies' of the mind.

<span id="fn_1775"></span>[355:5](sbe0857.htm#fr_1782) What is outside
the elements, the physical manifestations of Prak*ri*ti, is beyond the
domain of worldly life.

<span id="fn_1776"></span>[355:6](sbe0857.htm#fr_1783) The possession of
'home' is equivalent to a dwelling in the midst of worldly life. Hence
the idea of homelessness at inter alia Gîtâ, pp.
[101](sbe0814.htm#page_101)-[103](sbe0815.htm#page_103).

<span id="fn_1777"></span>[356:1](sbe0857.htm#fr_1784) This means, I
presume, that worldly life is conditioned, so to say, by space and time.
See [p. 343](sbe0854.htm#page_343) supra.

<span id="fn_1778"></span>[356:2](sbe0857.htm#fr_1785) I. e. the cause
of the rotation, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1779"></span>[356:3](sbe0857.htm#fr_1786) I. e.
unintelligent.

<span id="fn_1780"></span>[356:4](sbe0857.htm#fr_1787) Now takes the
form of a man, now of an animal, and then of some other thing,
Nîlaka*nth*a. I think, however, that the meaning is, that it is not
alike to all; different persons are in different states in this world.

<span id="fn_1781"></span>[356:5](sbe0857.htm#fr_1788) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says this means that it is the cause of the movements in all the worlds.
That is the sense I extract from his words, which are not quite clear,
lokânâm sam*k*ara*n*e hetus. The rendering in the text follows
Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1782"></span>[356:6](sbe0857.htm#fr_1789) I. e., I presume,
that which retards the revolutions of the 'wheel.' Instead of 'penance,'
Nîlaka*nth*a's reading is 'the, quality of darkness.'

<span id="fn_1783"></span>[356:7](sbe0857.htm#fr_1790) Cf.
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ, p. 13, and Vâkaspati's commentary thereon.

<span id="fn_1784"></span>[356:8](sbe0857.htm#fr_1791) 'Animated,'
Nîlaka*nth*a. Egoism is the cause of the world, and of all knowledge of
it. Cf. Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ, p. 24.

<span id="fn_1785"></span>[356:9](sbe0857.htm#fr_1792) The text here is
unsatisfactory. I follow Nîlaka*nth*a, who says 'vexations = those
arising from not obtaining what is desired.'

<span id="fn_1786"></span>[357:1](sbe0857.htm#fr_1793) Revolves in the
midst of, = lives upon, is fed by, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1787"></span>[357:2](sbe0857.htm#fr_1794) I. e. the organs
of action, I presume.

<span id="fn_1788"></span>[357:3](sbe0857.htm#fr_1795) The more
attachments one has, the more one is tied down to worldly life, and the
more comprehensive such life becomes.

<span id="fn_1789"></span>[357:4](sbe0857.htm#fr_1796) Avarice is
coveting another's wealth when one has one's own; desire is the wish for
that which one has not.

<span id="fn_1790"></span>[357:5](sbe0857.htm#fr_1797) Nîlaka*nth*a
reads 'vi*k*itra,' which he renders to mean diversified, as being made
up of the three qualities, ignorance there being the same thing as
Prak*ri*ti, which is probably a better sense altogether than that
obtainable from Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's reading.

<span id="fn_1791"></span>[357:6](sbe0857.htm#fr_1798) Which moves by
attachment to eternal pleasures, &c., Nîlaka*nth*a. See [p.
300](sbe0842.htm#page_300) supra.

<span id="fn_1792"></span>[357:7](sbe0857.htm#fr_1799) I. e. all the
world developed from Prakriti--a common phrase.

<span id="fn_1793"></span>[357:8](sbe0857.htm#fr_1800) This is
Nîlaka*nth*a's forced meaning. But the text here is doubtful. Perhaps
the sense is 'in which production and dissolution are going on
unchecked.'

<span id="fn_1794"></span>[357:9](sbe0857.htm#fr_1801) See [p.
344](sbe0854.htm#page_344) note. For the last word, the variant here is
sthâpayet, make steady or stop.

<span id="fn_1795"></span>[358:1](sbe0857.htm#fr_1802) I. e. the causes
of the revolution and stoppage, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1796"></span>[358:2](sbe0857.htm#fr_1803) Impressions of
previous actions, delusions, &c. And see [p. 247](sbe0831.htm#page_247)
supra.

<span id="fn_1797"></span>[358:3](sbe0857.htm#fr_1804) I. e. the
Samnyâsin.

<span id="fn_1798"></span>[358:4](sbe0857.htm#fr_1805) *S*âstra. Cf.
Gîtâ, [p. 117](sbe0818.htm#page_117).

<span id="fn_1799"></span>[358:5](sbe0857.htm#fr_1806) 'Such is the
eternal fame,' literally.

<span id="fn_1800"></span>[358:6](sbe0857.htm#fr_1807) I. e. on whom the
Vedic rites or Sa*m*skâras are duly performed. And see Gîtâ, [p.
122](sbe0820.htm#page_122).

<span id="fn_1801"></span>[358:7](sbe0857.htm#fr_1808) I. e. one of the
three higher castes.

<span id="fn_1802"></span>[358:8](sbe0857.htm#fr_1809) The original is
the technical word for the return of a Brahma*k*ârin after finishing his
studies. He is describing the 'householder.'

<span id="fn_1803"></span>[358:9](sbe0857.htm#fr_1810) I. e. following
the rule of conduct sanctioned by the good.

<span id="fn_1804"></span>[358:10](sbe0857.htm#fr_1811) Vide Williams'
Dictionary, s.v. mahâya*g*ña; Â*s*valâyana G*ri*hya III, 1, 3; Manu II,
69; IV, 21.

<span id="fn_1805"></span>[358:11](sbe0857.htm#fr_1812) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
62](sbe0806.htm#page_62); a guest must always be fed, and unless he is
satisfied the host must not eat. Cf. *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 192,
st. 15; Manu III, 106; Âpastamba II, 3, 7, 3.

<span id="fn_1806"></span>[359:1](sbe0857.htm#fr_1813) The same word as
at Gîtâ, [p. 114](sbe0817.htm#page_114), there rendered 'vain activity.'

<span id="fn_1807"></span>[359:2](sbe0857.htm#fr_1814) Cf. Âpastamba II,
1, 1, 2 seq.

<span id="fn_1808"></span>[359:3](sbe0857.htm#fr_1815) Cf. Manu IV, 36;
Âpastamba II, 1, 1, 15.

<span id="fn_1809"></span>[359:4](sbe0857.htm#fr_1816) These are the
well-known six duties of Brâhma*n*as as specified by Manu and others.
See the discussion of this point in the Introduction.

<span id="fn_1810"></span>[359:5](sbe0857.htm#fr_1817) Another reading
is 'gifts from an untainted (source).'

<span id="fn_1811"></span>[359:6](sbe0857.htm#fr_1818) What is the exact
meaning of this here? I suppose the meaning is that the performance of
them is a pure performance of duty; the others are duties the
performance of which supplies ones own wants, and is therefore
interested. Cf. Gautama X, 1 and 2.

<span id="fn_1812"></span>[359:7](sbe0857.htm#fr_1819) I. e. omission or
mistake in performance.
