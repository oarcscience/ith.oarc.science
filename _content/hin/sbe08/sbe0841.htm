(There lived once) a king named Ar<I>g</I>una&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1425"></A><A HREF="#fn_1420"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, a descendant of K<I>ri</I>tav&icirc;rya, possessed of a thousand arms, who with his bow conquered the (whole) earth up to the ocean.

<P>on a time, as we have heard, he was walking about near the sea, proud of his strength, and showering hundreds of arrows on the sea. The ocean, saluting him, and with joined hands, said, 'O brave man! do not throw arrows (on me). Say, what shall I do for you? The creatures, who take shelter with me, are being destroyed, O tiger-like king! by the great arrows thrown by you. Give them security, O Lord!'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Ar<I>g</I>una said:</P>
<P>If there is anywhere any wielder of the bow equal to me in battle, who might stand against me in the field, name him to me.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The ocean said:</P>
<P>If, O king! you have heard of the great sage <I>G</I>amadagni, his son is (the) proper (person) to show you due hospitality&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1426"></A><A HREF="#fn_1421"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>Then the king, full of great wrath, went away, and arriving at that hermitage approached R&acirc;ma only. In company with his kinsmen, he did many (acts) disagreeable to R&acirc;ma, and caused much trouble to the high-souled R&acirc;ma. Then the power of R&acirc;ma, whose power was unbounded, blazed forth, burning the hosts of the enemy, O lotus-eyed one! And then R&acirc;ma, taking up his axe, hacked away that man of the thousand arms in battle, like a tree of many branches. Seeing him killed and fallen, all (his) kinsmen assembled together, and taking swords and lances, surrounded the descendant of Bh<I>ri</I>gu. R&acirc;ma also taking up a bow, and hurriedly mounting a chariot, shot away volleys of arrows, and blew away the army of the king. Then some of the</P>

And the subjects of those (Kshatriyas) who were not performing their prescribed duties&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1427"></A><A HREF="#fn_1422"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> through fear of him, became V<I>ri</I>shalas, owing to the disappearance of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1428"></A><A HREF="#fn_1423"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

Then when the heroic (children) of Kshatriya women were destroyed again and again, the Kshatriyas, who were produced by the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1430"></A><A HREF="#fn_1425"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, were also destroyed by the son of <I>G</I>amadagni. At the end of the twenty-first slaughter, a bodiless voice from heaven, which was heard by all people, spoke sweetly to R&acirc;ma, 'O R&acirc;ma! O R&acirc;ma! desist (from this slaughter). What good, dear friend, do you perceive, in taking away the lives of these kinsmen of Kshatriyas over and over again?' Then, too, his grandfathers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1431"></A><A HREF="#fn_1426"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, with <I>Rik</I>&icirc;ka as their head, likewise said to the high-souled (R&acirc;ma), 'Desist, O noble one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1432"></A><A HREF="#fn_1427"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>!'

<P>O best of victors! you ought not to destroy these kinsmen of Kshatriyas. It is not proper for you, being a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, to slaughter these kings.</P>
