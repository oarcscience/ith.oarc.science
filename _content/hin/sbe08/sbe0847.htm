<P>pupil, O terror of your foes! asked a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a preceptor of rigid vows, (when he was) seated, something about the highest good. 'I' (he said), 'whose goal is the highest good, am come to you (who are) venerable; I pray of you with (bowed) head, O Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a! that you should explain to me what I ask.' The preceptor, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! said to the pupil who spoke thus: 'I will explain to you everything, O twice-born one! on which you verily have any doubt.' Thus addressed by the preceptor, O best of the Kauravas! he who was devoted to the preceptor, put (his) questions with joined bands. Listen to that, O you of great intelligence!</P>

From what were the movable and immovable entities born? By what do entities live, and what is the limit of their life? What is truth, what penance, O Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a? What are called the qualities by the good? And what paths are happy? What is pleasure, and what sin? These questions of mine, O venerable Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a sage! O you of excellent vows! do you be pleased to explain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1492"></A><A HREF="#fn_1487"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> correctly, truly, and accurately. There is none else here who can explain these questions. Speak, O best of those who understand piety! I feel the highest curiosity (in this matter).

<P ALIGN="CENTER">V&acirc;sudeva said:</P>
<P>That talented preceptor, who preserved (all) vows, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! O chief of the family of the Kauravas! O restrainer of foes! duly explained all those questions to that pupil, who had approached him (for instruction), who put (his) questions properly, who was possessed of (the necessary) qualifications, who was tranquil, who conducted himself in an agreeable manner, who was like (his) shadow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1494"></A><A HREF="#fn_1489"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and who was a self-restrained ascetic and a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin.</P>

We consider knowledge only as the highest thing; and renunciation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1496"></A><A HREF="#fn_1491"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> as the best penance.

Formerly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1507"></A><A HREF="#fn_1502"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the sages, B<I>ri</I>haspati, Bharadv&acirc;<I>g</I>a, Gautama, and likewise Bh&acirc;rgava, Vasish<I>th</I>a, and also K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, and Vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;mitra, and Atri also, desiring knowledge, met each other, after having travelled over all paths&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1508"></A><A HREF="#fn_1503"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and becoming wearied of their own actions. And those twice-born (sages), giving the lead to the old sage &Acirc;<U>n</U>girasa, saw Brahman, from whom (all) sin has departed, in Brahman's mansion. Having saluted that high-souled one who was sitting at ease, the great sages, full of humility, asked him this momentous (question) concerning the highest good: 'How should one perform good action? how is one released from sin? what paths are happy for us? what is truth and what vice? By what action are the two paths southern and northern obtained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1509"></A><A HREF="#fn_1504"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>? (and what is) destruction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1510"></A><A HREF="#fn_1505"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and emancipation, the birth and death of entities?'

<P>when thus spoken to by the sages, I will state to you. Listen (to that) O pupil!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Brahman said:</P>
<P>From the truth were the entities movable and immovable produced. They live by penance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1512"></A><A HREF="#fn_1507"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Understand that, O you of excellent vows! By their own action they remain transcending their own source&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1513"></A><A HREF="#fn_1508"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. For the truth joined with the qualities is invariably of five varieties. The Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1514"></A><A HREF="#fn_1509"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is the truth; penance is the truth; Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati also is truth; the entities are born from the truth; the universe consisting of (all) creatures is the truth. Therefore Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as whose final goal is always concentration of mind, from whom anger and vexation have departed, and who are invariably devoting themselves to piety, are full of the truth. I will speak about those (Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as) who are restrained by one another&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1515"></A><A HREF="#fn_1510"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, who are possessed of knowledge, who are the establishers of the bridge of piety, and who are the constant creators of the people&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1516"></A><A HREF="#fn_1511"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. I will speak of the four (branches of knowledge, and likewise of the castes, and of the four orders, distinctly. The wise always speak of piety as one, (but) having</P>

<P>four quarters. I will speak to you, O twice-born ones! of the happy path, which is productive of pleasure, and which has been invariably travelled over. by talented men in old days for (obtaining) assimilation with the Brahman. Learn, O noble ones! from me, now speaking exhaustively, of that highest path which is difficult to understand, and of the highest seat. The first step is said to be the order of Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins; the second is that of householders; next after that is that of foresters; and next after that too, the highest step must be understood to be that relating to the Adhy&acirc;tma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1517"></A><A HREF="#fn_1512"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Light&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1518"></A><A HREF="#fn_1513"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, space, sun, air, Indra, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, one sees not these, while one does not attain to the Adhy&acirc;tma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1519"></A><A HREF="#fn_1514"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. I will subsequently state the means to that, which you should understand. The order of foresters, (the order) of the sages who dwell in forests and live on fruits roots and air, is prescribed for the three twice-born (castes). The order of householders is prescribed for all castes. The talented ones speak of piety as having faith for its characteristic. Thus have I described to you the paths leading to the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1520"></A><A HREF="#fn_1515"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, which are occupied by good and talented men by means of their actions, and which are bridges of piety. He who, rigid in his vows, takes up any one of these modes of piety separately, always comes in time to perceive the production and dissolution of</P>

Now I shall state with accuracy and with reasons, all the elements which abide in parts in all objects. The great self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1522"></A><A HREF="sbe0848.htm#fn_1517"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the unperceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1523"></A><A HREF="sbe0848.htm#fn_1518"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> likewise, and likewise also egoism, the ten senses and the one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1524"></A><A HREF="sbe0848.htm#fn_1519"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> (sense), and the five great elements, and the specific characteristics of the five elements&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1525"></A><A HREF="sbe0848.htm#fn_1520"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, such is the eternal creation. The number of the elements is celebrated as being twenty-four plus one. And the talented man who understands the production and dissolution of (all) elements, he, of all beings, never comes by delusion. He who accurately understand the elements, the whole of the qualities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1526"></A><A HREF="sbe0848.htm#fn_1521"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and also all the deities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1527"></A><A HREF="sbe0848.htm#fn_1522"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, casting aside sin, and getting rid of all bonds, attains to all the spotless worlds.</P>
