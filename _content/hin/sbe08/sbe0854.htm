<P>From egoism, verily, were the five great elements born--earth, air, space, water, and light as the fifth. In these five great elements, in the operations of (perceiving) sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell, creatures are deluded&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1638"></A><A HREF="#fn_1631"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. When, at the termination of the destruction of the great elements, the final dissolution approaches, O talented one! a great danger for all living beings arises&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1639"></A><A HREF="#fn_1632"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Every entity is dissolved into that from which it is produced. They are born one from the other, and are dissolved in the reverse order&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1640"></A><A HREF="#fn_1633"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Then when every entity, movable or immovable, has been dissolved, the talented men who possess a (good) memory&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1641"></A><A HREF="#fn_1634"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> are not dissolved at all. Sound, touch, and likewise colour, taste, and smell as the fifth; the operations (connected with these) have causes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1642"></A><A HREF="#fn_1635"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and are inconstant, and their name is delusion. Caused by the production of avarice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1643"></A><A HREF="#fn_1636"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, not different from one another&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1644"></A><A HREF="#fn_1637"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, and insignificant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1645"></A><A HREF="#fn_1638"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, connected with flesh and blood, and depending upon one another,</P>

The Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a and the Ap&acirc;na, the Ud&acirc;na, the Sam&acirc;na, and the Vy&acirc;na also, these five winds are also joined to the inner self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1647"></A><A HREF="#fn_1640"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and together with speech, mind, and understanding make the eight constituents of the universe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1648"></A><A HREF="#fn_1641"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.

And the eleven organs, which are stated as having been produced from egoism--these, O twice-born ones! I will describe specifically. The ear, the skin, the two eyes, the tongue, the nose also as the fifth, the two feet, the organ of excretion, and the organ of generation, the two hands, and speech as the tenth; such is the group of organs, the mind is the eleventh. This group one should subdue first, then the Brahman shines (before him). Five (of these) are called the organs of perception, and five the</P>

<P>organs of action. The five beginning with the ear are truly said to be connected with knowledge. And all the rest are without distinction connected with action. The mind should be understood to be among both&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1651"></A><A HREF="#fn_1644"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the understanding is the twelfth. Thus have been stated the eleven organs in order. Understanding these&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1652"></A><A HREF="#fn_1645"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, learned men think they have accomplished (everything). I will now proceed to state all the various organs. Space&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1653"></A><A HREF="#fn_1646"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is the first entity; as connected with the self it is called the ear; likewise as connected with objects (it is) sound; and the presiding deity there is the quarters. The second entity is air; it is known as the skin as connected with the self; as connected with objects (it is) the object of touch; and the presiding deity there is lightning. The third (entity) is said to be light; as connected with the self it is called the eye; next as connected with objects (it is) colour; and the presiding deity there is the sun. The fourth (entity) should be understood to be water; as connected with the self it is called the tongue; as connected with objects it is taste; and the presiding deity there is Soma. The fifth entity is earth; as connected with the self it is the nose; as connected with objects likewise it is smell; and the presiding deity there is the wind. Thus are the five entities stated to be divided among the three&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1654"></A><A HREF="#fn_1647"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. I will now proceed to state all the various organs.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> As connected with the self, the feet are mentioned by Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, who perceive the truth; as connected with objects it is motion; the presiding deity there is Vish<I>n</I>u. The Ap&acirc;na wind, the motion of which is downward, as connected with the self, is called the organ of excretion; as connected with objects it is excretion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1655"></A><A HREF="#fn_1648"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and the presiding deity there is Mitra. As connected with the self the generative organ is mentioned, the producer of all beings; as connected with objects it is the semen; and the presiding deity there is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. Men who understand the Adhy&acirc;tma speak of the two hands as connected with the self; as connected with objects it is actions; and the presiding deity there is Indra. Then first, as connected with the self, is speech which relates to all the gods; as connected with objects it is what is spoken; and the presiding deity there is fire. As connected with the self they mention the mind, which follows after the five entities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1656"></A><A HREF="#fn_1649"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; as connected with objects it is the mental operation; the presiding deity there is the- moon. Likewise (there is) egoism, the cause of the whole course of worldly life, as connected with the self; as connected with objects, self-consciousness; the presiding deity there is Rudra.

And the (mode of) birth is fourfold. Those born from eggs, those born from germs, those born from perspiration, and those born from wombs-such is the fourfold (mode of) birth of the group of living beings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1658"></A><A HREF="#fn_1651"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now there are the inferior beings and likewise those moving in the air. Those should be understood to be born from eggs, as also all reptiles. Insects are said to be born from perspiration; and worms of the like description. This is said to be the second (mode of) birth, and inferior. Those beings, however, which are born after the lapse of some time, bursting through the earth, are said to be born from germs, O best of the twice-born! Beings of two feet or more than two feet, and those which move crookedly, are the beings born from wombs. Understand about them also, O best of men! The eternal seat (where) the Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1659"></A><A HREF="#fn_1652"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (is to be attained) should be understood to be twofold-penance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1660"></A><A HREF="#fn_1653"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and meritorious action.

The second entity is air; as connected with the (individual) self it is called the skin; as connected with objects it is the object of touch; and the presiding deity there is the lightning. The third is called light; as connected with the (individual) self it is laid down to be the eye; next as connected with objects it is colour; the presiding deity there is the sun.

A knowledge of this, O ye who understand piety! is here obtained by those who possess knowledge.

When everything is absorbed into the mind, the pleasures of (worldly) life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1667"></A><A HREF="#fn_1660"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are not esteemed.
