We have heard that wives attain to the worlds acquired by (their) husbands. What goal, verily, shall I reach, having got you for my husband?'

Earth, air, space, water, and light as the fifth, mind and understanding, these seven, indeed, are named wombs.

G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0807.htm#page_67">p. 67</A>. In the Kenopanishad (p. 220) the word &acirc;yatana is used to signify a means to the attainment of the Brahman.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1222"></A><A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fr_1227">257:6</A> The moon and fire constitute the universe, says Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra. Cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0817.htm#page_113">p. 113</A>. N&icirc;lakan<I>th</I>a interprets this more mystically as referring to the I<I>d</I>&acirc; and Pi<U>n</U>gal&acirc; arteries.</P>

The sense is by no means clear. But the moon being the deity of the mind also may, perhaps, be described as she is here, on that account.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1224"></A><A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fr_1229">257:8</A> This is Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra's interpretation of the original locative.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1226"></A><A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fr_1231">258:2</A> Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra says this means the five great elements, the eleven organs (active and perceptive, and the mind), the life-wind, and the individual soul.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1227"></A><A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fr_1232">258:3</A> The Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is at the nose, the Ap&acirc;na at the arms, the Sam&acirc;na at the navel, the Vy&acirc;na pervades the whole body, and the Ud&acirc;na is at all the joints; cf. Yoga-s&ucirc;tra III, 38 seq. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a says this explains how the 'expanse' (meaning, he says, the operations of the creation, &amp;c.) 'proceeds' from the Brahman. See on the life-winds, B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>ny</I>aka, p. 667; <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya, pp. 42-188; S&acirc;<U>n</U>khyatattvakaumud&icirc;, p. 96; Ved&acirc;nta Paribh&acirc;sh&acirc;, p. 45; <A HREF="sbe0835.htm#page_271">p. 271</A> infra.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1230"></A><A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fr_1235">258:6</A> N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a derives the word thus, utkarshe<I>n</I>a &acirc;nayati.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1231"></A><A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fr_1236">258:7</A> I. e. the subjugation of the life-winds as indicated at G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0806.htm#page_61">p. 61</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1232"></A><A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fr_1237">258:8</A> The meaning of the passage as a whole is not very clear, and the commentators afford but little help. The sense appears to be this: The course of worldly life is due to the operations of the life-winds which are attached to the self and lead to its manifestations as individual souls. Of these, the Sam&acirc;na and Vy&acirc;na are <A NAME="page_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A> controlled and held under check by the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a and Ap&acirc;na, into which latter the former are absorbed in sleep. The latter two are held in check and controlled by the Ud&acirc;na, which thus controls all. And the control of this, which is the control of all the five, and which is otherwise called penance, destroys the course of worldly life, and leads to the supreme self.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1235"></A><A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fr_1240">259:3</A> This, says N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, explains the word 'I' in the sentence preceding. Vaisv&acirc;nara is a word often used to denote the self. The Vishama<I>s</I>lok&icirc; derives it thus, 'that which saves all beings from hell;' see the Prasna-upanishad, pp. 167-188 (where seven tongues are also referred to); Mu<I>nd</I>aka, p. 292; <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya, p. 364; M&acirc;ndukya, p. 341.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1238"></A><A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fr_1243">259:6</A> These I take to be the powers of hearing, &amp;c., which are presided over by the several deities; or, better, Perhaps, they may mean the soul distinguished as so many with reference to these several powers; cf. B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, p. 169; Maitr&icirc;, p,. 96; Prasna, pp. 214, 215; Kaush&icirc;taki, p. 96; Aitareya, p. 187; <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya, p. 616.

<P><A NAME="fn_1239"></A><A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fr_1244">260:1</A> The next clause explains this; that which is to be smelt is earth, and so on throughout.
