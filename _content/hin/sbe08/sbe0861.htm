<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> And, O best of the gods! piety being thus confused and abounding in contradictions, we are deluded, and come to no determination. People are acting, (saying) this is good, this is good. And he who is attached to a certain (form of) piety, always esteems that. Here (therefore) our understanding breaks down, and our mind is distracted. We wish, O best (of beings)! to be informed of what is good. Be pleased now to proceed to state what is (so) mysterious, and what is the cause of the connexion between the Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a and nature. Thus addressed by those Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, the venerable, holy, and talented creator of worlds told them accurately (what they asked).</P>

N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a says means = 'meditation and so forth;' as to 'that is not so' he cites what he calls a <I>S</I>ruti, which is however one of the K&acirc;rik&acirc;s of Gau<I>d</I>ap&acirc;da on the M&acirc;<I>nd</I>ukya; see p. 432.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1948"></A><A HREF="sbe0861.htm#fr_1956">376:3</A> That is to say, they hold that meditation should be practised.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1952"></A><A HREF="sbe0861.htm#fr_1960">376:7</A> Were there optimists. and pessimists at the time of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; in India? This verse, however, does not occur in some MSS. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a's note on this passage may be of some interest. He says, 'Some hold that the self exists after the body is lost; others, that is the Lok&acirc;yatas or <I>K</I>&acirc;rv&acirc;kas, hold the contrary. Everything doubtful is the view of the Sy&acirc;dv&acirc;dins; nothing doubtful that of the Tairthikas, the great teachers (I presume, about their own respective doctrines). Everything impermanent, T&acirc;rkikas; permanent, M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>sakas; nothing exists, the <I>S</I>&ucirc;nyav&acirc;dins; something exists, but only momentarily, <A NAME="page_377"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 377</FONT></A> Saugatas; knowledge is one, but the ego and non-ego are two different principles, the Yog&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ras; mixed, U<I>d</I>ulomas; one, is the view of the worshippers of the Brahman as possessed of qualities; distinct, other M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>sakas, who hold that the special actions are the cause (of everything, is meant, I presume); manifold = the atomists; time and space = astrologers. Those who "say that is not so," that is to say, that what we see has no real existence at all, are the V<I>ri</I>ddhas, ancient philosophers; omission to bathe = the condition of Naish<I>th</I>ika Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins; bathing = householder's condition; "means should be resorted to, that is not so," those who are against all meditation, &amp;c., according to the <I>S</I>ruti text, which N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a quotes; "merit and glory, that is not so," some say there is no merit as the Lok&acirc;yatas or <I>K</I>&acirc;rv&acirc;kas; "knowledge, renunciation," the former is to be gained only by means of the latter; "ponder on elements" = who are intent on the investigation of the true nature of things; nature = abundance of resources, by which alone knowledge is produced, not by mere renunciation.' It will be understood, that this commentary assumes a different syntactical construction of the original in some places from that adopted in our translation.</P>
