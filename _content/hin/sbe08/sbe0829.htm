<P>Then grasping his feet, K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, asked questions very difficult to explain, and all of them that (being), the best of the supporters of piety, did explain.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, said:</P>
<P>How does the body perish, and how, too, is it produced? How does one who moves in this harassing course of worldly life become freed? And (how) does the self, getting rid of nature, abandon the body (produced) from it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1073"></A><A HREF="#fn_1068"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>? And how, being freed from the body, does he attain to the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1074"></A><A HREF="#fn_1069"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>? How does this man enjoy the good and evil acts done by himself? And where do the acts of one who is released from the body remain?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a said:</P>
<P>Thus addressed, O descendant of V<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>i! that Siddha answered these questions in order. Hear me relate what (he said).</P>

<P>When those actions, productive of long life and fame&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1075"></A><A HREF="#fn_1070"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which a man performs here, are entirely exhausted, after his assumption of another body, he performs (actions of an) opposite character, his self being overcome at the exhaustion of life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1076"></A><A HREF="#fn_1071"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And his ruin being impending, his understanding goes astray.

By aggravating the disorders (in) his own (body), he contracts a disease which ends in death, or he even engages in unreasonable (acts), such as hanging&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1084"></A><A HREF="#fn_1079"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (oneself). From these causes, the living&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1085"></A><A HREF="#fn_1080"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> body of that creature then perishes. Learn about that correctly as I am about to state it. Heat being kindled in the body, and being urged by a sharp wind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1086"></A><A HREF="#fn_1081"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, pervades the whole frame, and, verily, checks the (movements of all the) life-winds. Know this truly, that excessively powerful heat, if kindled in the body, bursts open the vital parts-the seats of the Soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1087"></A><A HREF="#fn_1082"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. Then the soul, full of torments, forthwith falls away from the perishable (body). Know, O best of the twice-born! that (every) creature leaves the body, when the vital parts are burst open, its self being overcome with torments. All beings are constantly distracted with birth and death; and, O chief of the twice-born! are seen abandoning (their) bodies; or entering the womb on the exhaustion of (their previous) actions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1088"></A><A HREF="#fn_1083"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.

As the compact association of the five elements is broken up, the wind in the body, distributed within the five elements&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1090"></A><A HREF="#fn_1085"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, between the upward and downward life-winds, being aggravated by cold, and urged by a sharp wind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1091"></A><A HREF="#fn_1086"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, goes upwards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1092"></A><A HREF="#fn_1087"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, abandoning the embodied (self) in consequence of pain.

<P>that to be a vital part, for thus it is seen (laid down) in the Scriptures. Those vital parts being wounded, that (wind) directly comes out therefrom, and entering the bosom of a creature obstructs the heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1099"></A><A HREF="#fn_1094"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Then the possessor of consciousness knows nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1100"></A><A HREF="#fn_1095"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Having his knowledge enveloped by darkness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1101"></A><A HREF="#fn_1096"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, while the vitals are still enveloped, the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1102"></A><A HREF="#fn_1097"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, being without a fixed seat, is shaken about by the wind. And then he heaves a very deep and alarming gasp, and makes the unconscious body quiver as he goes out (of it). That soul, dropping out of the body, is surrounded on both sides by his own actions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1103"></A><A HREF="#fn_1098"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, his own pure and meritorious, as also his sinful (ones). Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, possessed of knowledge, whose convictions are correctly (formed) from sacred learning, know him by (his) marks as one who has performed meritorious actions or the reverse. As those who have eyes see a glow-worm disappear here and there in darkness, so likewise do those who have eyes of knowledge. Such a soul, the Siddhas see with a divine eye, departing (from the body), or coming to the birth, or entering into a womb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1104"></A><A HREF="#fn_1099"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. Its three descriptions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1105"></A><A HREF="#fn_1100"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> of seats are here learnt from the Scriptures.

<P>creatures dwell. All embodied (selfs), having here performed good or evil (actions), obtain (the fruit). It is here they obtain higher or lower enjoyments by their own actions. And it is those whose actions here are evil, who by their actions go to, hell. Harassing is that lower place where men are tormented. Freedom from it is very difficult, and the self should be specially protected from it. Learn from me now the seats in which creatures going up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1107"></A><A HREF="#fn_1102"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> dwell, and which I shall describe truly. Hearing this, you will learn the highest knowledge, and decision regarding action&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1108"></A><A HREF="#fn_1103"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. All (the worlds in) the forms of stars, and this lunar sphere&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1109"></A><A HREF="#fn_1104"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and also this solar sphere which shines in the world by its own lustre, know these to be the seats of men who perform meritorious actions. All these, verily, fall down again and again in consequence of the exhaustion of their actions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1110"></A><A HREF="#fn_1105"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> . And there, too, in heaven, there are differences of low, high, and middling,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1111"></A><A HREF="#fn_1106"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. Nor, even there, is there satisfaction, (even) after a sight of most magnificent splendour. Thus have I stated to you these seats distinctly. I will after this (proceed to) state to you the production of the f&#156;tus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1112"></A><A HREF="#fn_1107"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. And, O twice-born one! hear that attentively from me as I state it.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1077"></A><A HREF="sbe0829.htm#fr_1082">236:8</A> This is doubtful. The sense may be, 'who takes juicy or not thoroughly prepared food by day and night.' But see &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana Grihya-s&ucirc;tra, p. 90; &Acirc;pastamba I, 1, 2, 24; Gautama II, 13.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1081"></A><A HREF="sbe0829.htm#fr_1086">237:4</A> This is different, as the commentators point out, from the ordinary life-winds.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1083"></A><A HREF="sbe0829.htm#fr_1088">237:6</A> I adopt the reading karma<I>n</I>&acirc;m, which I find in one of the MSS. I consulted. I think it probable that that was the reading before the commentators. The other reading is marma<I>n</I>&acirc;m.</P>
