He who knows it knows the Vedas. Upwards and downwards extend its branches, which are enlarged by the qualities, and the sprouts of which are sensuous objects. And downwards to this human world are continued its roots which lead on to action. Its form is not thus known here, nor (its) end, nor beginning, nor support. But having with the firm weapon of unconcern, cut this A<I>s</I>vattha, whose roots are firmly fixed, then should one seek for that seat from which those that go there never return, (thinking) that one rests on that same primal being from whom the ancient course (of worldly life) emanated. Those who are free from pride and delusion, who have overcome the evils of attachment, who are constant in (contemplating) the relation of the supreme and individual self, from whom desire has departed, who are free from the pairs (of opposites) called pleasure and pain, go undeluded to that imperishable seat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="#fn_468"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

<P><A NAME="fn_468"></A><A HREF="sbe0817.htm#fr_469">111:2</A> A<I>s</I>vattha stands here for the course of worldly life. Its roots are above, viz. the supreme being; its boughs are Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha and others of the higher beings. The Vedas are its leaves, preserving it as leaves preserve trees (another interpretation is that they are the causes of the fruit which the tree bears, i. e. salvation, &amp;c.) Upwards and downwards, from the highest to the lowest of created things. Enlarged = the qualities manifesting themselves, as body, senses, &amp;c.; objects of sense are sprouts as they are attached to the senses, which are the tips of the branches above stated. The roots which extend downwards are the desires for various <A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A> enjoyments. Its form not thus known here, i.e. to those who live and move in this world, thus viz. as above described. The man who knows the tree thus is said to know the Vedas, because knowledge of it is knowledge of the substance of the Vedas, which is, that the course of worldly life springs from the supreme, is kept up by Vedic rites, and destroyed by knowledge of the supreme. As to freedom from pride, cf. Sutta Nip&acirc;ta, p. 4.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_474"></A><A HREF="sbe0817.htm#fr_475">112:6</A> Cf. Maitr&icirc;-upanishad, p. 142. This sentence continues what has been stated at the top of the page. The intervening <A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A> portion explains how souls do come back in some cases. As a general rule, 'all going ends in returning.' But the soul is an exception in some cases, as the 'going' to the Brahman is going to the fountain-head. Then the question arises, How does the severance come off at all? And that is what the lines up to this explain.</P>

Support, i. e. by keeping the earth from falling or crumbling away. The moon is said to nourish herbs by communicating to them some of her 'juice.' The moon, it may be noted, is called 'watery star' by Shakespeare. As to her relation to the vegetable kingdom, see Matsya-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a XXIII, stanza 10 seq.</P>
