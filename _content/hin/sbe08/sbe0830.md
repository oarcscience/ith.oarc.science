# CHAPTER III.

There is no destruction here of actions good or not good <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1](#fn_1108). Coming to one body after another they
become ripened in their respective ways <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[2](#fn_1109). As a fruitful (tree) producing fruit
may yield much fruit, so does merit performed with a pure mind become
expanded <span id="fr_1115"></span>[3](#fn_1110). Sin, too, performed
with a sinful mind, is similarly (expanded). For the self engages in
action, putting forward this mind <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[4](#fn_1111). And now further, hear how <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[5](#fn_1112) a man, overwhelmed with action, and
enveloped in desire and anger <span id="fr_1118"></span>[6](#fn_1113),
enters a womb. Within the womb of a woman, (he) obtains-as the result of
action a body good or else bad <span id="fr_1119"></span>[7](#fn_1114),
made up of virile semen and blood. Owing to (his) subtlety and
imperceptibility, though he obtains a body appertaining to the Brahman,
he is not attached anywhere; hence is he the eternal Brahman <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[8](#fn_1115). That is the seed of all beings; by
that

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

all creatures exist. That soul, entering all the limbs of the fœtus,
part by part, and dwelling in the seat of the life-wind <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[1](#fn_1116), supports (them) with the mind <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[2](#fn_1117). Then the fœtus, becoming possessed of
consciousness, moves about its limbs. As liquefied iron being poured out
assumes the form of the image <span id="fr_1123"></span>[3](#fn_1118),
such you must know is the entrance of the soul into the fœtus. As fire
entering a ball of iron, heats it, such too, you must understand, is the
manifestation of the soul in the fœtus. And as a blazing lamp shines in
a house, even so does consciousness light up bodies <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[4](#fn_1119). And whatever action he performs,
whether good or bad, everything done in a former body must necessarily
be enjoyed (or suffered). Then <span id="fr_1125"></span>[5](#fn_1120)
that is exhausted, and again other (action) is accumulated, so long as
the piety which dwells in the practice of concentration of mind for
final emancipation <span id="fr_1126"></span>[6](#fn_1121) has not been
learnt. As to that, O best (of men)! I will tell you about that action
by which, verily, one going the round of various births, becomes happy.
Gifts, penance, life as a Brahma*k*ârin, adherence to prescribed
regulations, restraint of the senses <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[7](#fn_1122), and also

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

tranquillity, compassion to (all) beings, self-restraint, and absence of
cruelty, refraining from the appropriation of the wealth of others, not
acting dishonestly even in thought towards (any) being in this world,
serving mother and father, honouring deities and guests, honouring
preceptors, pity, purity, constant restraint of the organs <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1](#fn_1123), and causing good to be done; this is
said to be the conduct of the good <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[2](#fn_1124). From this is produced piety, which
protects people to eternity. Thus one should look (for it) among the
good, for among them it constantly abides. The practice to which the
good adhere, points out (what) piety (is) <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[3](#fn_1125). And among them dwells that (course
of) action which constitutes eternal piety. He who acquires that, never
comes to an evil end <span id="fr_1131"></span>[4](#fn_1126). By this
are people held in check from making a slip in the paths of piety <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[5](#fn_1127). But the devotee who is released <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[6](#fn_1128) is esteemed higher than these. For the
deliverance from the course of worldly life of the man who acts piously
and well, as he should act, takes place after a long time <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[7](#fn_1129). Thus a creature always meets with
(the effects of) the action performed (in a) previous (life). And
that <span id="fr_1135"></span>[8](#fn_1130) is the sole cause by which
he comes here (in a) degraded (form). There is

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

in the world a doubt as to what originally was the source from which he
became invested with a body. And that I shall now proceed to state.
Brahman, the grandfather of all people, having Made a body for himself,
created the whole of the three worlds, moving and fixed <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1](#fn_1131). From that he created the Pradhâna,
the material cause of all embodied (selfs), by which all this is
pervaded, and which is known in the world as the highest <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[2](#fn_1132). This is what is called the
destructible <span id="fr_1138"></span>[3](#fn_1133); but the
other <span id="fr_1139"></span>[4](#fn_1134) is immortal and
indestructible. And Pra*g*âpati, who had been first created, created all
creatures and (all) the fixed entities, (having) as regards the moving
(creation), a pair separately for each <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[5](#fn_1135) (species). Such is the ancient
(tradition) heard (by us). And as regards that, the grandsire fixed a
limit of time, and (a rule) about migrations among (various) creatures,
and about the return <span id="fr_1141"></span>[6](#fn_1136). What I say
is all correct and proper, like (what may be said by) any talented
person who has in

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

a former birth perceived the self <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[1](sbe0831.htm#fn_1137). He who properly perceives
pleasure and pain to be inconstant, the body to be an unholy aggregate
 <span id="fr_1143"></span>[2](sbe0831.htm#fn_1138), and ruin to be
connected with action <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[3](sbe0831.htm#fn_1139), and who remembers that
whatever little there is of happiness is all misery <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[4](sbe0831.htm#fn_1140), he will cross beyond the
fearful ocean of worldly life, which is very difficult to cross. He who
understands the Pradhâna <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[5](sbe0831.htm#fn_1141), (though) attacked by birth
and death and disease, sees one (principle of) consciousness in all
beings possessed of consciousness <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[6](sbe0831.htm#fn_1142). Then seeking after the
supreme seat, he becomes indifferent to everything <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[7](sbe0831.htm#fn_1143). O best (of men)! I will
give you accurate instruction concerning it. Learn from me exhaustively,
O Brâhma*n*a! the excellent knowledge concerning the eternal
imperishable seat, which I am now about to declare.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1108"></span>[241:1](sbe0830.htm#fr_1113) Cf.
Maitrî-upanishad, p. 53, and Mu*nd*aka, p. 270. And see generally as to
this passage, *S*ârîraka Bhâshya, pp. 751-760.

<span id="fn_1109"></span>[241:2](sbe0830.htm#fr_1114) I. e. they yield
their respective fruits; cf. Maitrî, p. 43, and *Kh*ândogya, p. 358.

<span id="fn_1110"></span>[241:3](sbe0830.htm#fr_1115) This explains,
say the commentators, how even a little merit or sin requires sometimes
more than one birth to enjoy and exhaust,

<span id="fn_1111"></span>[241:4](sbe0830.htm#fr_1116) As a king
performs sacrifices 'putting forward' a priest, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra; and
cf. Dhammapada, the first two verses.

<span id="fn_1112"></span>[241:5](sbe0830.htm#fr_1117) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
has tathâ, 'in the same way,' instead of this, and renders it to mean
'putting forward' the mind.

<span id="fn_1113"></span>[241:6](sbe0830.htm#fr_1118) Hence he does not
get rid of birth and death.

<span id="fn_1114"></span>[241:7](sbe0830.htm#fr_1119) Good = of gods or
men; bad = of the lower species of creatures, Ar*g*una.

<span id="fn_1115"></span>[241:8](sbe0830.htm#fr_1120) He, in the
preceding sentences, according to Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, means the self,
through the mind, or 'putting forward' the mind, as said above. In this
sentence, he takes 'he' to mean the mind itself; Brahman = the self; and
the mind, he says, is called the Brahman, as it, like the self, is the
cause of the *K*aitanya, intelligence, in all creatures.

<span id="fn_1116"></span>[242:1](sbe0830.htm#fr_1121) I. e. the heart.

<span id="fn_1117"></span>[242:2](sbe0830.htm#fr_1122) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says that the. soul at the beginning of the sentence means the mind, and
mind here means knowledge or intelligence. Cf. [p.
238](sbe0829.htm#page_238) supra.

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[242:3](sbe0830.htm#fr_1123) In the mould of
which, that is to say, it is poured.

<span id="fn_1119"></span>[242:4](sbe0830.htm#fr_1124) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
106](sbe0815.htm#page_106). The three similes, says Nîlaka*nth*a, show
that the soul pervades the whole body, is yet imperceptible, and also
unattached to the body. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's explanation is different, but
I prefer Nîlaka*nth*a's.

<span id="fn_1120"></span>[242:5](sbe0830.htm#fr_1125) I. e. by the
enjoyment or suffering.

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[242:6](sbe0830.htm#fr_1126) I. e. while he
does not possess the knowledge which leads to the piety necessary as a
preliminary for final emancipation, and which ultimately destroys
action. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 62](sbe0806.htm#page_62).

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[242:7](sbe0830.htm#fr_1127) I. e. keeping the
senses of hearing &c. from all operations<span id="page_243">p.
243</span> save those relating to the Brahman. Tranquillity is the same
thing as regards the mind.

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[243:1](sbe0830.htm#fr_1128) This I take to
mean restraint of the active organs, such as speech, &c.
'Self-restraint' is rendered by Nîlaka*nth*a to mean 'concentration of
mind.'

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[243:2](sbe0830.htm#fr_1129) Cf. Maitrî, p.
57; *Kh*ândogya, p. 136; and Gîtâ, pp. [103](sbe0815.htm#page_103),
[119](sbe0819.htm#page_119).

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[243:3](sbe0830.htm#fr_1130) Cf. Âpastamba I,
1, 1, 2; I, 1, 20, 7; *S*akuntalâ, p. 30 (Williams).

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[243:4](sbe0830.htm#fr_1131) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
72](sbe0808.htm#page_72).

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[243:5](sbe0830.htm#fr_1132) By this, i.e. by
the practice of the good, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[243:6](sbe0830.htm#fr_1133) From delusion,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra; emancipated by force of his devotion, Nîlakantha.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[243:7](sbe0830.htm#fr_1134) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
73](sbe0808.htm#page_73); *Kh*ândogya, pp. 136, 137.

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[243:8](sbe0830.htm#fr_1135) Scil. the action.

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[244:1](sbe0830.htm#fr_1136) I.e. animate and
inanimate. 'A body for himself' = undeveloped Âkâ*s*a, Nîlaka*nth*a. But
see Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 19, and Sâ<u>n</u>khya Prav. Bhâshya I, 122,
and III, 10.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[244:2](sbe0830.htm#fr_1137) Cf. inter alia
Gîtâ, [p. 58](sbe0805.htm#page_58) and note, and Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p.
11. As to the words at the beginning of this sentence, 'from that,' cf.
Taittirîya-upanishad, p. 67, where everything is derived from Âkâ*s*a,
mentioned in the last note, and Âkâ*s*a from the Brahman.

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[244:3](sbe0830.htm#fr_1138) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
113](sbe0817.htm#page_113), where there are three principles
distinguished from each other.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[244:4](sbe0830.htm#fr_1139) I. e. the self,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[244:5](sbe0830.htm#fr_1140) A pair, i. e. a
male and female for each species, such as man, &c., Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[244:6](sbe0830.htm#fr_1141) Pra*g*âpati fixed
the limit of life for every 'moving' creature, and the rule as to going
from one species of body into another, and as to going from one world to
another. As to a part of 'the ancient tradition,' the first stanza of
the Mu*nd*aka-upanishad may be compared.
