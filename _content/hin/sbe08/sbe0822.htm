<P>If, O Vidura! there is anything not (yet) said by you in (your) discourse, then do impart it to me who wish to hear, for you have spoken marvellous (things).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Vidura said:</P>
<P>O Dh<I>ri</I>tar&acirc;sh<I>t</I>ra! the ancient youth Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;ta, (otherwise called) San&acirc;tana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, who declared that death exists not--he, O descendant of Bharata! the best of all talented men, will explain all the doubts of your mind, both those (which are) secret&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and those openly declared.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Dh<I>ri</I>tar&acirc;sh<I>t</I>ra said:</P>
<P>What, do you not yourself know more about this (subject), that San&acirc;tana should explain (it) to me? Explain (it) yourself, O Vidura! if there is any remnant of intelligence (left) in you.</P>

<P>1 am born of a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra womb, and do not like to say more than what (I have said). But the intelligence of that youth, I believe to be eternal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_610"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. He who has come of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a womb, even though he may proclaim a great mystery, does not thereby become liable to the censure of the gods. Therefore do I say this to you.</P>

<P>Do you, O Vidura! speak to the ancient San&acirc;tana for me, so that there may be a meeting even here, between (myself in) this body (and him).</P>

And he, too, O descendant of Bharata! knowing of such meditation, made his appearance.

After he had been comfortably seated, and had taken rest, Vidura then spoke to him: 'Venerable sir! there is some doubt in Dh<I>ri</I>tar&acirc;sh<I>t</I>ra's mind, which cannot</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_605"></A><A HREF="sbe0822.htm#fr_608">149:1</A> So N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a. <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara says Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;ta is Sanatkum&acirc;ra, and the component parts of the name he paraphrases by 'born from Brahman.' For San&acirc;tana, see B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>ny</I>aka, p. 506, and note &nbsp;<A HREF="sbe0821.htm#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <A HREF="sbe0821.htm#page_141">p. 141</A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_606"></A><A HREF="sbe0822.htm#fr_609">149:2</A> I. e. relating to subjects which may be freely discussed by all, and those which may not. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a adopts a different reading, which he interprets to mean 'doctrines exoteric and esoteric,' e. g. self-restraint, &amp;c., and the acquisition of mystic power, &amp;c., respectively. The expression 'doubts of the mind' occurs. however, further on.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_607"></A><A HREF="sbe0822.htm#fr_610">150:1</A> I. e., I suppose, never-failing, and such as can deal with all sorts of topics. Sanatkum&acirc;ra, it need scarcely be stated, is the teacher of N&acirc;rada in the famous dialogue in the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogyopanishad, p. 473.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_608"></A><A HREF="sbe0822.htm#fr_611">150:2</A> Vai<I>s</I>amp&acirc;yana is the narrator of the grand story of which pieces like the present form parts.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_609"></A><A HREF="sbe0822.htm#fr_612">150:3</A> The reading is sometimes different, so as to mean 'of rigid vows,' as at G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0806.htm#page_61">p. 61</A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_610"></A><A HREF="sbe0822.htm#fr_613">150:4</A> The pronouns here are too numerous. Does 'he' here refer to Dh<I>ri</I>tar&acirc;sh<I>t</I>ra? Vidura seems more likely, though the express mention of him in the next sentence might be treated as pointing the other way.</P>
