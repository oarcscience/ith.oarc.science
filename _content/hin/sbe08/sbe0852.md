# CHAPTER XXV.

Brahman said:

From the unperceived was first produced the great self <span
id="fr_1621"></span>[1](#fn_1614) of great intelligence, the source of
all qualities <span id="fr_1622"></span>[2](#fn_1615); it is said to be
the first creation. That great self is signified by these synonymous
terms--the great self, intelligence, Vish*n*u <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[3](#fn_1616), Gishnu, Sambhu, the valiant, the
understanding, means of knowledge, means of perception, and likewise
cognition, courage, memory. Knowing that (great self), a learned
Brâhma*n*a comes not by delusion. It has hands and feet on all
sides <span id="fr_1624"></span>[4](#fn_1617), it has eyes, heads, and
faces on all sides; it stands pervading everything in the world <span
id="fr_1625"></span>[5](#fn_1618). The being of great power is stationed
in the heart of all. Minuteness <span id="fr_1626"></span>[6](#fn_1619),
lightness, (the power of) obtaining (everything) (are his); he is the
governor, the light, inexhaustible. Now people who comprehend the
understanding, and who are always possessed of a good heart, who
practice meditation, who are constant at concentration of mind, who are
true to their promises, and whose senses are subdued, who are possessed
of knowledge, who are not avaricious, who have subdued wrath, whose
minds are clear, who are talented, who are devoid of (the thought that
this or that is) mine, who are devoid of egoism,

these being emancipated, attain greatness <span
id="fr_1627"></span>[1](sbe0853.htm#fn_1620). And the talented man who
understands that high and holy goal, the great self <span
id="fr_1628"></span>[2](sbe0853.htm#fn_1621), he among all people comes
not by delusion. The self-existent Vish*n*u is the Lord in the primary
creations <span id="fr_1629"></span>[3](sbe0853.htm#fn_1622). And he who
thus knows the lord lying in the cave <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[4](sbe0853.htm#fn_1623), the transcendent, ancient
being, of universal form, and golden <span
id="fr_1631"></span>[5](sbe0853.htm#fn_1624), the highest goal of those
possessed of understanding, that talented man, abides transcending the
understanding <span id="fr_1632"></span>[6](sbe0853.htm#fn_1625).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1614"></span>[332:1](sbe0852.htm#fr_1621) I. e. the
understanding, on which see Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra I, 61-64. It is called
being (Purusha) further on, as it dwells in the body (Puri).

<span id="fn_1615"></span>[332:2](sbe0852.htm#fr_1622) I. e. of the
effects of all qualities (namely, the universe; cf. Gîtâ, [p.
48](sbe0804.htm#page_48)), Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1616"></span>[332:3](sbe0852.htm#fr_1623) I. e.
all-pervading, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. On the whole passage, see
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, pp. 15, 16, and note  [3](sbe0853.htm#fn_1622) on
page [333](#page_333) infra.

<span id="fn_1617"></span>[332:4](sbe0852.htm#fr_1624) As, says Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra, it is the source of all activity.

<span id="fn_1618"></span>[332:5](sbe0852.htm#fr_1625) The words are
identical with those at Gîtâ, [p. 103](sbe0815.htm#page_103).

<span id="fn_1619"></span>[332:6](sbe0852.htm#fr_1626) See [p.
