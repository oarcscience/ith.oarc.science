The words 'the Brahman is his origin' are not quite clear, as being not connected with the figure employed. Perhaps it might be taken otherwise thus, 'the Brahman (is) the fire produced from the Brahman,' this last standing for the ara<I>n</I>i.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1362"></A><A HREF="sbe0838.htm#fr_1367">284:2</A> I. e. one who understands the truth, N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a; God, Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra. The same sentence winds up two of the following chapters; and at <A HREF="sbe0846.htm#page_310">p. 310</A> K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a says the Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a signifies the supreme self.

<P><A NAME="fn_1367"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1372">285:2</A> Cf. Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya, <A HREF="sbe0825.htm#page_180">p. 180</A> and note there.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1368"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1373">285:3</A> Cf. as to all this G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0814.htm#page_101">p. 101</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1369"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1374">285:4</A> This is not the forest spoken of before. but what has been before called the 'impassable place,' but which also at <A HREF="#page_286">p. 286</A> is by implication called a forest, viz. the course of worldly life.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1370"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1375">285:5</A> Viz. the eye, ear, tongue, skin, and nose, and the mind, and understanding--these are called trees, as being producers of the fruits, namely, the pleasures and pains derived from their several operations; the guests are the powers of each sense personified--they receive the fruits above described; the hermitages are the trees above mentioned, in which the guests take shelter; the seven forms of concentration are the exclusion from the self of the seven functions of the seven senses &amp;c. already referred to; the seven forms of initiation refer to the initiation into the higher life, by repudiating as not one's own the actions of each member out of the group of seven. Cf. as to this <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya, p. 219, and commentary there.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1371"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1376">285:6</A> Cf. for these different numbers of colours, Yoga-s&ucirc;tra II, 19, and commentary, p. 105, and <I>S</I>&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&acirc;ra, p. 18. The trees here meant are the Tanm&acirc;tras, or subtle elements, and the theory is that the Gandha-tanm&acirc;tra, or subtle element of smell, has five qualities, its <A NAME="page_286"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 286</FONT></A> own special one, so to say, and the four special ones of the others; the next is taste, the next colour, the next touch, and the last sound; each has one quality less than its predecessor. See Yoga-s&ucirc;tra, p. 106, and gloss; <I>S</I>&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&ucirc;tra I, 62; and Ved&acirc;nta Paribh&acirc;sh&acirc;, p. 45.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1372"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1377">286:1</A> These are mind and understanding; the fruits and flowers are here of 'undistinguished colours,' as the text expresses it, since they include the colours of all the fruits of all the other five sets of trees; that is to say, the subject-matter of their operations is sound, taste, &amp;c., the subject-matters of all the senses together. 'Undistinguished colours' is, perhaps, more literally 'of colours not clear.' Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra paraphrases it by 'of variegated colours,' which is no doubt the true ultimate sense.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1373"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1378">286:2</A> The self, N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a. See <A HREF="sbe0837.htm#page_279">p. 279</A>, note &nbsp;<A HREF="sbe0837.htm#fn_1336"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> supra.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1377"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1382">286:6</A> I. e. when the senses having worked, as unconnected with the self, are finally absorbed into it. Cf. <I>S</I>&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-k&acirc;rik&acirc; 49 and Ka<I>th</I>a, p. 151.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1378"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1383">287:1</A> It extends on all sides, its end cannot be perceived on any side.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1379"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1384">287:2</A> These are, according to Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, the Mahat, Aha<U>n</U>k&acirc;ra, and five Tanm&acirc;tras. Their faces are turned downwards, as they are obstacles in the way upwards, viz. the way of final emancipation; they are brilliant, as they light up the course of worldly life; and hence, too, they are 'causes of generation.' They give birth to the universe.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1380"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1385">287:3</A> They conceal the higher delight of final emancipation.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1382"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1387">287:5</A> Viz. the Brahman.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1383"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1388">287:6</A> Cf. <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya, pp. 295-300. The word sages here, as before, means the various organs. See B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, p. 415.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1384"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1389">287:7</A> Glory = renown; brilliance = Brahmic splendour (Brahmate<I>g</I>as); perfection = obtaining what is desired; power = not being conquered by others, Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra. About the sun, see line 3 of text above.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1385"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1390">287:8</A> I. e. contentment. See the second line in the text above.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1386"></A><A HREF="sbe0839.htm#fr_1391">287:9</A> I. e. the space in the heart, the sacrifice being that of 'concentration of mind,' yogaya<I>g</I>&ntilde;a,--N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a. A confluence of rivers is very sacred--here the meaning intended seems to be the absorption of all desires by contentment into the heart.</P>
