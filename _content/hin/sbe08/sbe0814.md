# CHAPTER XII.

Ar*g*una said:

Of the worshippers, who thus, constantly devoted, meditate on you, and
those who (meditate) on the unperceived and indestructible, which best
know devotion?

The Deity said:

Those who being constantly devoted, and possessed of the highest faith,
worship me with a mind fixed on me, are deemed by me to be the most
devoted. But those, who, restraining the (whole) group of the senses,
and with a mind at all times

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

equable, meditate on the indescribable, indestructible, unperceived
(principle) which is all-pervading, unthinkable, indifferent <span
id="fr_404"></span>[1](#fn_403), immovable, and constant, they, intent
on the good of all beings, necessarily attain to me. For those whose
minds are attached to the unperceived, the trouble is much greater.
Because the unperceived goal <span id="fr_405"></span>[2](#fn_404) is
obtained by embodied (beings) with difficulty. As to those, however, O
son of P*ri*thâ! who, dedicating all their actions to me, and (holding)
me as their highest (goal), worship me, meditating on me with a devotion
towards none besides me, and whose minds are fixed on me, I, Without
delay, come forward as their deliverer from the ocean of this world of
death. Place your mind on me only; fix your understanding on me. In me
you will dwell <span id="fr_406"></span>[3](#fn_405) hereafter, (there
is) no doubt. But if you are unable to fix your mind steadily on me,
then, O Dhanañ*g*aya! endeavour <span id="fr_407"></span>[4](#fn_406) to
obtain me by the abstraction of mind (resulting) from continuous
meditation <span id="fr_408"></span>[5](#fn_407). If you are unequal
even to continuous meditation, then let acts for (propitiating) me be
your highest (aim). Even performing actions for (propitiating) me, you
will attain perfection. If you are unable to do even this, then resort
to devotion <span id="fr_409"></span>[6](#fn_408) to me, and, with
self-restraint, abandon all fruit of action. For knowledge is better
than continuous meditation; concentration <span
id="fr_410"></span>[7](#fn_409) is esteemed higher

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

than knowledge; and the abandonment of fruit of action than
concentration; from (that) abandonment, tranquillity soon (results).
That devotee of mine, who hates no being, who is friendly and
compassionate, who is free from egoism, and from (the idea that this or
that is) mine, to whom happiness and misery are alike, who is forgiving,
contented, constantly devoted, self-restrained, and firm in his
determinations, and whose mind and understanding are devoted to me, he
is dear to me. He through whom the world is not agitated <span
id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_410), and who is not agitated by the world,
who is free from joy and anger and fear and agitation, he too is dear to
me. That devotee of mine, who is unconcerned <span
id="fr_412"></span>[2](#fn_411), pure, assiduous <span
id="fr_413"></span>[3](#fn_412), impartial, free from distress <span
id="fr_414"></span>[4](#fn_413), who abandons all actions (for
fruit <span id="fr_415"></span>[5](#fn_414)), he is dear to me. He who
is full of devotion to me, who feels no joy and no aversion, who does
not grieve and does not desire, who abandons (both what is) agreeable
and (what is) disagreeable, he is dear to me. He who is alike to friend
and foe, as also in honour and dishonour, who is alike in cold and heat,
pleasure and pain, who is free from attachments, to whom praise and
blame are alike, who is taciturn <span id="fr_416"></span>[6](#fn_415),
and contented with anything whatever (that comes), who is homeless <span
id="fr_417"></span>[7](#fn_416), and of a steady mind, and full of
devotion,

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

that man is dear to me. But those devotees who, imbued with faith, and
(regarding) me as their highest (goal), resort to this holy (means for
attaining) immortality, as stated, they are extremely dear to me.
