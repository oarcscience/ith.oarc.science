# CHAPTER VIII.

Ar*g*una said:

What is that Brahman, what the Adhyâtma, and what, O best of beings! is
action? And what is called the Adhibhûta? And who is the Adhiya*g*ña,
and how in this body, O destroyer of Madhu? And how, too, are you to be
known at the time of departure (from this world) by those who restrain
their selfs?

The Deity said:

The Brahman is the supreme, the indestructible. Its manifestation (as an
individual self) is called the Adhyâtma. The offering (of an oblation to
any divinity), which is the cause of the production and development of
all things, is named action. The Adhibhûta is all perishable things. The
Adhidaivata is the (primal) being. And the Adhiya*g*ña, O best of
embodied (beings)! is I myself in this body <span
id="fr_292"></span>[4](#fn_291).

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And he who leaves this body and departs (from
this world) remembering me in (his) last moments, comes into my essence.
There is no doubt of that. Also whichever form <span
id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_292) (of deity) he remembers when he finally
leaves this body, to that he goes, O son of Kuntî! having been used to
ponder on it. Therefore, at all times remember me, and engage in battle.
Fixing your mind and understanding on me, you will come to me, there is
no doubt. He who thinks of the supreme divine Being, O son of P*ri*thâ!
with a mind not (running) to other (objects), and possessed of
abstraction in the shape of continuous meditation (about the supreme),
goes to him. He who, possessed of reverence (for the supreme Being) with
a steady mind, and with the power of devotion, properly concentrates the
life-breath between the brows <span id="fr_294"></span>[2](#fn_293), and
meditates on the ancient Seer, the ruler, more minute than the minutest
atom <span id="fr_295"></span>[3](#fn_294), the supporter of all, who is
of an unthinkable form, whose brilliance is like that of the sun, and
who is beyond all darkness <span id="fr_296"></span>[4](#fn_295), he
attains to that transcendent and divine Being. I <span
id="fr_297"></span>[5](#fn_296) will tell you briefly about the seat,
which those who know the Vedas declare to be indestructible; which
entered by ascetics from whom all desires have departed; and wishing for
which, people pursue the

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

mode of life of Brahma*k*ârins <span id="fr_298"></span>[1](#fn_297). He
who leaves the body and departs (from this world), stopping up all
passages <span id="fr_299"></span>[2](#fn_298), and confining the mind
within the heart <span id="fr_300"></span>[3](#fn_299), placing the
life-breath in the head, and adhering to uninterrupted meditation <span
id="fr_301"></span>[4](#fn_300), repeating the single syllable 'Om,'
(signifying) the eternal Brahman <span id="fr_302"></span>[5](#fn_301),
and meditating on me, he reaches the highest goal. To the devotee who
constantly practises abstraction, O son of P*ri*thâ! and who with a mind
not (turned) to anything else, is ever and constantly meditating on me,
I am easy of access. The high-souled ones, who achieve the highest
perfection, attaining to me, do not again come to life, which is
transient, a home of woes <span id="fr_303"></span>[6](#fn_302). All
worlds, O Ar*g*una! up to the world of Brahman, are (destined) to
return <span id="fr_304"></span>[7](#fn_303). But, O son of Kuntî! after
attaining to me, there is no birth again. Those who know a day of
Brahman to end after one thousand ages, and the night to terminate after
one thousand ages, are the persons

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

who know day and night <span id="fr_305"></span>[1](#fn_304). On the
advent of day, all perceptible things are produced from the unperceived;
and on the advent of night they dissolve in that same (principle) called
the unperceived. This same assemblage of entities, being produced again
and again, dissolves on the advent of night, and, O son of P*ri*thâ!
issues forth on the advent of day, without a will of its own <span
id="fr_306"></span>[2](#fn_305). But there is another entity,
unperceived and eternal, and distinct from this unperceived (principle),
which is not destroyed when all entities are destroyed. It is called the
unperceived, the indestructible; they call it the highest goal.
Attaining to it, none returns <span id="fr_307"></span>[3](#fn_306).
That is my supreme abode. That supreme Being, O son of P*ri*thâ! he in
whom all these entities dwell <span id="fr_308"></span>[4](#fn_307), and
by whom all this is permeated, is to be attained to by reverence not
(directed) to another. I will state the times, O descendant of Bharata!
at which devotees departing (from this world) go, never to return, or to
return. The fire, the flame <span id="fr_309"></span>[5](#fn_308), the
day,

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern solstice, departing
(from the world) in these, those who know the Brahman go to the Brahman.
Smoke, night, the dark fortnight, the six months of the southern
solstice, (dying) in these, the devotee goes to the lunar light and
returns <span id="fr_310"></span>[1](sbe0811.htm#fn_309). These two
paths, bright and dark, are deemed to be eternal in this world <span
id="fr_311"></span>[2](sbe0811.htm#fn_310). By the one, (a man) goes
never to return, by the other he comes back. Knowing these two paths, O
son of P*ri*thâ! no devotee is deluded <span
id="fr_312"></span>[3](sbe0811.htm#fn_311). Therefore at all times be
possessed of devotion, O Ar*g*una! A devotee knowing all this <span
id="fr_313"></span>[4](sbe0811.htm#fn_312), obtains all the holy fruit
which is prescribed for (study of) the Vedas, for sacrifices, and also
for penances and gifts, and he attains to the highest and primeval seat.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_288"></span>[77:1](sbe0809.htm#fr_289) Concerning the
supreme principle and the mode of worshipping it.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[77:2](sbe0809.htm#fr_290) Cf. infra, [p.
109](sbe0816.htm#page_109).

<span id="fn_290"></span>[77:3](sbe0809.htm#fr_291) See the next
chapter.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[77:4](sbe0810.htm#fr_292) Adhyâtma where it
occurs before (e. g. [p. 55](sbe0805.htm#page_55)) has been rendered
'the relation between the supreme and individual soul.' As to <span
id="page_78">p. 78</span> action, cf. pp. [53](sbe0805.htm#page_53),
[54](sbe0805.htm#page_54). Adhibhûta is apparently the whole inanimate
creation, and Adhidaivata is the being supposed to dwell in the sun.
Adhiya*g*ña is K*ri*sh*n*a. Cf. too pp. [113](sbe0817.htm#page_113),
[114](sbe0817.htm#page_114).

<span id="fn_292"></span>[78:1](sbe0810.htm#fr_293) Some commentators
say 'whatever thing' generally. The 'form' remembered in one's last
moments would be that which had been most often meditated on during
life.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[78:2](sbe0810.htm#fr_294) Cf. supra, [p.
67](sbe0807.htm#page_67).

<span id="fn_294"></span>[78:3](sbe0810.htm#fr_295) Ka*th*a, p. 105;
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 333.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[78:4](sbe0810.htm#fr_296) Cf.
*S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad, p. 327.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[78:5](sbe0810.htm#fr_297) Kathopanishad, p.
102.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[79:1](sbe0810.htm#fr_298) As to
Brahma*k*ârins, see supra, [p. 69](sbe0808.htm#page_69).

<span id="fn_298"></span>[79:2](sbe0810.htm#fr_299) 'The senses,' say
the commentators. Might it not refer to the 'nine portals' at [p.
65](sbe0807.htm#page_65) supra? See also, however, [p.
108](sbe0816.htm#page_108).

<span id="fn_299"></span>[79:3](sbe0810.htm#fr_300) I. e. thinking of
nothing, making the mind cease to work. Cf. Maitrî-upanishad, p. 179.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[79:4](sbe0810.htm#fr_301) Cf.
Maitrî-upanishad, p. 130, uninterrupted, like 'oil when poured out,'
says the commentator.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[79:5](sbe0810.htm#fr_302) Cf.
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad, p. 151; Mândukya, pp. 330-388 (Om is all-past,
present, and future); N*ri*si*m*ha Tâpinî, pp. 110, 117, 171; Maitrî, p.
140; Pra*s*na, p. 220. On the opening passage of the *Kh*ândogya,
*S*a<u>n</u>kara says, 'Om is the closest designation of the supreme
Being. He is pleased when it is pronounced, as people are at the mention
of a favourite name.' See also Max Müller, Hibbert Lectures, p. 84;
Goldstücker's Remains, I, 122.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[79:6](sbe0810.htm#fr_303) See infra, [p.
86](sbe0811.htm#page_86); and cf. Sutta Nipâta, p. 125.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[79:7](sbe0810.htm#fr_304) They are only
temporary, not the everlasting seats of the soul.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[80:1](sbe0810.htm#fr_305) Cf. Manu I, 73.
*S*a<u>n</u>kara says, that this explains why the abodes of Brahmâ and
others are said to be not lasting. They are limited by time. As to ages,
*S*rîdhara says, a human year is a day and night of the gods. Twelve
thousand years made of such days and nights make up the four ages: one
thousand such, 'quaternions of ages' make up a day, and another thousand
a night of Brahmâ. Of such days and nights Brahmâ has a hundred years to
live. At the close of his life, the universe is destroyed.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[80:2](sbe0810.htm#fr_306) Cf. [p.
82](sbe0811.htm#page_82) infra; also Manu-sm*ri*ti I, 52; and Kâlidâsa's
Kumârasambhava II, 8.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[80:3](sbe0810.htm#fr_307) Cf. Ka*th*opanishad,
p. 149; and also [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112) infra.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[80:4](sbe0810.htm#fr_308) I. e. by whom, as
the cause of them, all these entities are supported; cf. [p.
82](sbe0811.htm#page_82) infra.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[80:5](sbe0810.htm#fr_309) *S*rîdhara
understands 'the time when,' in the sentence preceding this, to mean the
path indicated by a deity presiding over <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>
time, by which;' and the fire-flame as included in this, though having
no connexion with time. *S*a<u>n</u>kara agrees, though he also suggests
that fire means a deity presiding over time. I own I have no clear
notion of the meaning of these verses. Cf. *Kh*ândogya, p. 342;
B*ri*had-âra*ny*aka-upanishad, p. 1057 seq.
