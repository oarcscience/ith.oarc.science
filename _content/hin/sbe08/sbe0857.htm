<P><A NAME="fn_1777"></A><A HREF="sbe0857.htm#fr_1784">356:1</A> This means, I presume, that worldly life is conditioned, so to say, by space and time. See <A HREF="sbe0854.htm#page_343">p. 343</A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1778"></A><A HREF="sbe0857.htm#fr_1785">356:2</A> I. e. the cause of the rotation, N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1781"></A><A HREF="sbe0857.htm#fr_1788">356:5</A> Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra says this means that it is the cause of the movements in all the worlds. That is the sense I extract from his words, which are not quite clear, lok&acirc;n&acirc;m sam<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>e hetus. The rendering in the text follows N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1782"></A><A HREF="sbe0857.htm#fr_1789">356:6</A> I. e., I presume, that which retards the revolutions of the 'wheel.' Instead of 'penance,' N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a's reading is 'the, quality of darkness.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1785"></A><A HREF="sbe0857.htm#fr_1792">356:9</A> The text here is unsatisfactory. I follow N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, who says 'vexations = those arising from not obtaining what is desired.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1789"></A><A HREF="sbe0857.htm#fr_1796">357:4</A> Avarice is coveting another's wealth when one has one's own; desire is the wish for that which one has not.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1790"></A><A HREF="sbe0857.htm#fr_1797">357:5</A> N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a reads 'vi<I>k</I>itra,' which he renders to mean diversified, as being made up of the three qualities, ignorance there being the same thing as Prak<I>ri</I>ti, which is probably a better sense altogether than that obtainable from Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra's reading.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1793"></A><A HREF="sbe0857.htm#fr_1800">357:8</A> This is N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a's forced meaning. But the text here is doubtful. Perhaps the sense is 'in which production and dissolution are going on unchecked.'</P>
