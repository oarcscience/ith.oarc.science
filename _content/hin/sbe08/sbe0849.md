# CHAPTER XXII.

Brahman said:

O best (of men)! I will explain to you accurately the quality of
passion. Learn, O noble ones! the action of the quality of passion.
Injuring (others), beauty <span id="fr_1564"></span>[2](#fn_1558), toil,
pleasure and pain, cold and heat, power <span

wrath, exercise and quarrel too, vindictiveness, desire, backbiting,
battle, the thought (that this or that is) mine, preservation <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[4](#fn_1560), slaughter, bonds, affliction, buying
and selling, touching <span id="fr_1568"></span>[5](#fn_1561) other
people's weak points, by cutting, breaking, piercing; fierceness and

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

uttering falsehoods, bad <span id="fr_1569"></span>[1](#fn_1562) gifts,
doubt, boasting, censure, praise, laudation <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[2](#fn_1563), prowess, defiance, attendance. (on
another), obedience <span id="fr_1571"></span>[3](#fn_1564), service,,
harbouring desire, management <span id="fr_1572"></span>[4](#fn_1565),
policy, heedlessness, contumely, belongings <span
id="fr_1573"></span>[5](#fn_1566), and the various decorations which
prevail in this world, for men, for women, for living creatures., for
articles, and for houses, vexation, and also want of faith, vows and
regulation <span id="fr_1574"></span>[6](#fn_1567), and actions with
expectations, and the various acts of public charity <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[7](#fn_1568) the ceremony of Svâhâ, the ceremony of
Svadhâ, the ceremony of Vashat <span id="fr_1576"></span>[8](#fn_1569),
salutation, both officiating at sacrifices and imparting instruction,
and also sacrificing and study, gifts and acceptance of gifts,
expiations, auspicious rites, the wish 'this may be mine and that may be
mine,' affection generated by the qualities <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[9](#fn_1570), treachery and likewise deception,
disrespect and respect, theft, slaughter, disgust, vexing (oneself),
wakefulness, ostentation, haughtiness, and attachment also, devotion,
pleasure and delight, gambling, common scandal, association with women,
devotion

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

to dancing, and instrumental or vocal music, all these qualities, O
Brâhma*n*as! are described as passionate. The men who meditate on past,
present, and future entities in this world <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1](sbe0850.htm#fn_1571), who are always devoted to
the triad--piety, wealth, and lust also <span
id="fr_1579"></span>[2](sbe0850.htm#fn_1572)--who acting under (the
impulse of) desires exult or. the success of all their desires, these
men, who are enveloped by passion, have (their) currents downwards <span
id="fr_1580"></span>[3](sbe0850.htm#fn_1573). Born again and again in
this world, they rejoice <span
id="fr_1581"></span>[4](sbe0850.htm#fn_1574), and wish for the fruit
appertaining to the life after death <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[5](sbe0850.htm#fn_1575) and that appertaining to
this world also. They give and receive, and make Tarpa*n*a <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[6](sbe0850.htm#fn_1576), and also sacrifice. The
qualities of passion have been described to you in many ways, and the
action of the quality has also been stated accurately. The man who
always understands these qualities, gets rid of all passionate
qualities.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1557"></span>[323:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1563) Generally and
specifically, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1558"></span>[323:2](sbe0849.htm#fr_1565) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says these mean pride of beauty and pride of power respectively. Cf. as
to this list generally, Maitrî, pp. 50, 51.

<span id="fn_1559"></span>[323:3](sbe0849.htm#fr_1566) Cf.
Sanatsu*g*âta, [p. 168](sbe0824.htm#page_168).

<span id="fn_1560"></span>[323:4](sbe0849.htm#fr_1567) I presume this
means solicitude for preserving what one has got. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).

<span id="fn_1561"></span>[323:5](sbe0849.htm#fr_1568) Literally,
piercing. 'Cutting, breaking, piercing,' further on, seem to indicate
the greater or less offensiveness of the operation of 'touching others'
weak points.'

<span id="fn_1562"></span>[324:1](sbe0849.htm#fr_1569) I. e. to
undeserving persons, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Probably it includes the other
defects also pointed out at Gîtâ, [p. 120](sbe0819.htm#page_120). As to
doubt, see Gîtâ, [p. 63](sbe0806.htm#page_63).

<span id="fn_1563"></span>[324:2](sbe0849.htm#fr_1570) The one is
attributing merits which do not exist, the other is merely parading
merits which do exist.

<span id="fn_1564"></span>[324:3](sbe0849.htm#fr_1571) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
takes this literally to mean 'wish to hear.'

<span id="fn_1565"></span>[324:4](sbe0849.htm#fr_1572) Cleverness in
worldly affairs, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1566"></span>[324:5](sbe0849.htm#fr_1573) Cf. Gîtâ, passim,
and see also Yoga-sûtras II, 30, and commentary (pp. 127-129, Calc. ed.)

<span id="fn_1567"></span>[324:6](sbe0849.htm#fr_1574) Fasts and other
observances for special benefits.

<span id="fn_1568"></span>[324:7](sbe0849.htm#fr_1575) E.g. digging
tanks and wells, &c.

<span id="fn_1569"></span>[324:8](sbe0849.htm#fr_1576) Vashat and Svâhâ
indicate offerings to gods, Svadhâ to the manes. See B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka,
p. 982, and Mâ*nd*ukya (Gau*d*apâda Kârikâ), p. 443, and commentaries
there.

<span id="fn_1570"></span>[324:9](sbe0849.htm#fr_1577) I presume this
means attachment to the operations of the qualities. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
48](sbe0804.htm#page_48). As to the wish just before, see Gîtâ, pp.
[115](sbe0818.htm#page_115), [110](sbe0816.htm#page_110).
