<P ALIGN="CENTER">Sa&ntilde;<I>g</I>aya said:</P>
<P>To him, who was thus overcome with pity, and dejected, and whose eyes were full of tears and turbid, the destroyer of Madhu spoke these words.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Deity said:</P>
<P>How (comes it that) this delusion, O Ar<I>g</I>una! which is discarded by the good, which excludes from heaven, and occasions infamy, has overtaken you in this (place of) peril? Be not effeminate, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! it is not worthy of you. Cast off this base weakness of heart, and arise, O terror of (your) foes!</P>

<P>killing (my) preceptors--(men) of great glory--it is better to live even on alms in this world. But killing them, though they are avaricious of worldly goods, I should only enjoy blood-tainted enjoyments. Nor do we know which of the two is better for us-whether that we should vanquish them, or that they should vanquish us. Even those, whom having killed, we do not wish to live--even those sons of Dh<I>ri</I>tar&acirc;sh<I>t</I>ra stand (arrayed) against us. With a heart contaminated by the taint of helplessness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with a mind confounded about my duty, I ask you. Tell me what is assuredly good for me. I am your disciple; instruct me, who have thrown myself on your (indulgence). For I do not perceive what is to dispel that grief which will dry up my organs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> after I shall have obtained a prosperous kingdom on earth without a foe, or even the sovereignty of the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Sa&ntilde;<I>g</I>aya said:</P>
<P>Having spoken thus to Hrish&icirc;kesa, O terror of (your) foes! Gu<I>d</I>&acirc;ke<I>s</I>a said to Govinda, 'I shall not engage in battle;' and verily remained silent. To him thus desponding between the two armies, O descendant of Bharata! H<I>ri</I>sh&icirc;kesa spoke these words with a slight smile.</P>

<P>and you talk words of wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Learned men grieve not for the living nor the dead. Never did I not exist, nor you, nor these rulers of men; nor will any one of us ever hereafter cease to be. As, in this body, infancy and youth and old age (come) to the embodied (self)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, so does the acquisition of another body; a sensible man is not deceived about that The contacts of the senses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, O son of Kunt&icirc;! which produce cold and heat, pleasure and pain, are not permanent, they are ever coming and going. Bear them, O descendant of Bharata! For, O chief of men! that sensible man whom they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> (pain and pleasure being alike to him) afflict not, he merits immortality. There is no existence for that which is unreal; there is no non-existence for that which is real. And the (correct) conclusion about both&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is perceived by those who perceive the truth. Know that to be indestructible which pervades all this; the destruction of that inexhaustible (principle) none can bring about. These bodies appertaining to the embodied (self) which is eternal, indestructible, and indefinable, are said&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> to be perishable; therefore do engage in battle, O descendant of Bharata!

<P>it to be killed, both know nothing. It kills not, is not killed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is not born, nor does it ever die, nor, having existed, does it exist no more. Unborn, everlasting, unchangeable, and primeval, it is not killed when the body is killed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! how can that man who knows it thus to be indestructible, everlasting, unborn, and inexhaustible, how and whom can he kill, whom can he cause to be killed? As a man, casting off old clothes, puts on others and new ones, so the embodied (self) casting off old bodies, goes to others and new ones. Weapons do not divide it (into pieces); fire does not burn it, waters do not moisten it; the wind does not dry it up. It is not divisible; it is not combustible; it is not to be moistened; it is not to be dried up. It is everlasting, all-pervading, stable, firm, and eternal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. It is said to be unperceived, to be unthinkable, to be unchangeable. Therefore knowing it to be such, you ought not to grieve, But even if you think that it is constantly born, and constantly dies, still, O you of mighty arms! you ought not to grieve thus. For to one that is born, death is certain; and to one that dies, birth is certain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Therefore</P>

<P>about (this) unavoidable thing, you ought not to grieve. The source of things, O descendant of Bharata! is unperceived; their middle state is perceived; and their end again is unperceived. What (occasion is there for any) lamentation regarding them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>? One looks upon it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> as a wonder; another similarly speaks of it as a wonder; another too hears of it as a wonder; and even after having heard of it, no one does really know it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. This embodied (self), O descendant of Bharata! within every one's body is ever indestructible. Therefore you ought not to grieve for any being. Having regard to your own duty also, you ought not to falter, for there is nothing better for a Kshatriya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> than a righteous battle. Happy those Kshatriyas, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! who can find such a battle (to fight)--come of itself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>--an open door to heaven! But if you will not fight this righteous battle, then you will have abandoned your own duty and your fame, and you will incur sin. All beings, too, will tell of your everlasting infamy; and to one who has been honoured, infamy is (a) greater (evil) than death. (Warriors who are) masters of great cars will think that you abstained from the battle through fear, and having been highly thought of by them, you will fall down to littleness. Your enemies, too,</P>

<P>decrying your power, will speak much about you that should not be spoken. And what, indeed, more lamentable than that? Killed, you will obtain heaven; victorious, you will enjoy the earth. Therefore arise, O son of Kunt&icirc;! resolved to (engage in) battle. Looking alike on pleasure and pain, on gain and loss, on victory and defeat, then prepare for battle, and thus you will not incur sin. The knowledge here declared to you is that relating to the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now hear that relating to the Yoga. Possessed of this knowledge, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! you will cast off the bonds of action. In this (path to final emancipation) nothing that is commenced becomes abortive; no obstacles exist; and even a little of this (form of ) piety protects one from great danger&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

But the states of mind of those who have no firm understanding are many-branched and endless. The state of mind consisting in firm understanding regarding steady contemplation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> does not belong to those, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! who are strongly attached to (worldly) pleasures and power, and whose minds are drawn away by that flowery talk which is full of (ordinances of) specific acts for the attainment of (those) pleasures and (that) power, and which promises</P>

<P>birth as the fruit of acts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--(that flowery talk) which those unwise ones utter, who are enamoured of Vedic words, who say there is nothing else, who are full of desires, and whose goal is heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The Vedas (merely) relate to the effects of the three qualities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; do you, O Ar<I>g</I>una! rise above those effects of the three qualities, and be free from the pairs of opposites&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, always preserve courage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, be free from anxiety for new acquisitions or protection of old acquisitions, and be self-controlled&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. To the instructed Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, there is in all the Vedas as much utility as in a reservoir of water into which waters flow from all sides&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. Your business is with action alone; not by any means with fruit. Let not the fruit of action be your motive (to action). Let not your attachment be (fixed) on inaction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>.

<P>ill-success; (such) equability is called devotion. Action, O Dhana&ntilde;<I>g</I>aya! is far inferior to the devotion of the mind. In that devotion seek shelter. Wretched are those whose motive (to action) is the fruit (of action). He who has obtained devotion in this world casts off both merit and sin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Therefore apply yourself to devotion; devotion in (all) actions is wisdom. The wise who have obtained devotion cast off the fruit of action; and released from the shackles of (repeated)births&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, repair to that seat where there is no unhappiness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. When your mind shall have crossed beyond the taint of delusion, then will you become indifferent to all that you have heard or will heard&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. When your mind, confounded by what you have heard&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, will stand firm and steady in contemplation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, then will you acquire devotion.</P>

<P>desires of his heart, and is pleased in his self only and by his self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he is then called one of steady mind. He whose heart is not agitated in the midst of calamities, who has no longing for pleasures, and from whom (the feelings of) affection, fear, and wrath&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> have departed, is called a sage of steady mind. His mind is steady, who, being without attachments anywhere, feels no exultation and no aversion on encountering the various agreeable and disagreeable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (things of this world). A man's mind is steady, when he withdraws his senses from (all) objects of sense, as the tortoise (withdraws) its limbs from all sides. Objects of sense draw back from a person who is abstinent; not so the taste (for those objects). But even the taste departs from him, when he has seen the Supreme&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The boisterous senses, O son of Kunt&icirc;! carry away by force the mind even of a wise man, who exerts himself (for final emancipation). Restraining them all, a man should remain engaged in devotion, making me his only resort. For his mind is steady whose senses are under his control. The man who ponders over objects of sense forms an attachment to them; from (that) attachment is produced desire; and from desire anger is produced&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; from anger results want of discrimination&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>; from want of discrimination,</P>

But the self-restrained man who moves among&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> objects with senses under the control of his own self, and free from affection and aversion, obtains tranquillity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. When there is tranquillity, all his miseries are destroyed, for the mind of him whose heart is tranquil soon becomes steady. He who is not self-restrained has no steadiness of mind; nor has he who is not self-restrained perseverance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the pursuit of self-knowledge; there is no tranquillity for him who does not persevere in the pursuit of self-knowledge; and whence can there be happiness for one who is not tranquil? For the heart which follows the rambling senses leads away his judgment, as the wind leads a boat astray upon the waters. Therefore, O you of mighty arms! his mind is steady whose senses are restrained on all sides from objects of sense.

I suggest the following explanation:--Having said that the Vedas are concerned with actions for special benefits, K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a compares them to a reservoir which provides water for various special purposes, drinking, bathing, &amp;c. The Vedas similarly prescribe particular rites and ceremonies for going to heaven, or destroying an enemy, &amp;c. But, says K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a, man's duty is merely to perform the actions prescribed for him among these, and not entertain desires for the special benefits named. The stanza occurs in the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya, too.</P>
