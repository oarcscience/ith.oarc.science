# CHAPTER VI.

The Brâhma*n*a said: On this, too, they relate this ancient story. Learn
now of what description is the institution of the ten sacrificial
priests <span id="fr_1252"></span>[1](#fn_1247). The ear <span
id="fr_1253"></span>[2](#fn_1248), the tongue, the nose, the two feet,
the two hands, speech, the genital organ, and the anus, these, verity,
are ten sacrificial priests, O beautiful one! Sound, touch, colour, and
taste, smell, words, action, motion, and the discharge of semen, urine,
and excrement, these are the ten oblations. The quarters, wind, sun,
moon, earth and fire, and Vish*n*u also, Indra, Pra*g*âpati, and Mitra,
these, O beautiful one! are the ten fires <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[3](#fn_1249). The ten organs are the makers of the
offering; the offerings are ten, O beautiful one! Objects of sense,
verily, are the fuel; and they are offered up into the ten fires. The
mind is the ladle <span id="fr_1255"></span>[4](#fn_1250); and the
wealth is the pure, highest knowledge} <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[5](#fn_1251). (Thus) we have heard, was the
universe duly divided <span id="fr_1257"></span>[6](#fn_1252). And the
mind, which is the instrument

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

of knowledge, requires everything knowable <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[1](#fn_1253) (as its offering). The mind is within
the body the upholder of the frame, and the knower is the upholder of
the body <span id="fr_1259"></span>[2](#fn_1254). That <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[3](#fn_1255) upholder of the body is the Gârhapatya
fire; from that another is produced, and the mind which is the
Âhavanîya; and into this the offering is thrown. Then the lord of speech
was produced <span id="fr_1261"></span>[4](#fn_1256); that (lord of
speech) looks up to the mind. First, verily, are words produced; and the
mind runs after them.

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

The Brâhma*n*a's wife said:

How did speech come into existence first, and how did the mind come into
existence afterwards, seeing that words are uttered (after they have
been) thought over by the mind? By means of what experience does
intelligence come to the mind, and (though) developed, does not
comprehend <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1](#fn_1257)? What verily
obstructs it?

The Brâhma*n*a said:

The Apâna becoming lord changes it into the state of the Apâna in
consequence. That is called the movement of the mind, and hence the mind
is in need (of it) <span id="fr_1263"></span>[2](#fn_1258). But since
you ask me a question regarding speech and mind, I will relate to you a
dialogue between themselves. Both speech and mind went to the self of
all beings <span id="fr_1264"></span>[3](#fn_1259) and spoke (to him
thus), 'Say which of us is superior; destroy our doubts, O lord!'
Thereupon the lord positively said to speech, 'Mind (is superior).' But
speech thereupon said to him, 'I, verily, yield (you) your desires <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[4](#fn_1260).'

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

The Brâhma*n*a <span id="fr_1266"></span>[1](#fn_1261) said:

Know, that (in) my (view), there are two minds <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[2](#fn_1262), immovable and also movable. The
immovable, verily, is with me; the movable is in your dominion. Whatever
mantra, or letter, or tone goes to your dominion, that indeed is the
movable mind <span id="fr_1268"></span>[3](#fn_1263). To that you are
superior. But inasmuch, O beautiful one I as you came personally to
speak to me (in the way you did) <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[4](#fn_1264), therefore, O Sarasvatî! you shall
never speak after (hard) exhalations <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[5](#fn_1265). The goddess speech, verily, dwelt
always between the Prâ*n*a and Apâna <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[6](#fn_1266). But, O noble one! going with the
Apâna

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

wind <span id="fr_1272"></span>[1](#fn_1267), though impelled, (in
consequence of) being without the Prâ*n*a, she ran up to Pra*g*âpati,
saying, 'Be pleased <span id="fr_1273"></span>[2](#fn_1268), O venerable
sir!' Then <span id="fr_1274"></span>[3](#fn_1269) the Prâ*n*a appeared
again nourishing speech. And therefore speech never speaks after (hard)
exhalation. It is always noisy or noiseless. Of those two, the noiseless
is superior to the noisy <span id="fr_1275"></span>[4](#fn_1270)
(speech). This excellent (speech), like a cow, yields milk <span
id="fr_1276"></span>[5](#fn_1271), and speaking of the Brahman it always
produces the eternal (emancipation). This cow-like speech, O you of a
bright smile! is divine, with divine <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[6](#fn_1272) power. Observe the difference of (its)
two subtle, flowing (forms) <span id="fr_1278"></span>[7](#fn_1273).

The Brâhma*n*a's wife said:

What did the goddess of speech say on that occasion in days of old,
when, though (she was) impelled with a desire to speak, words could not
be uttered?

The Brâhma*n*a said:

The (speech) which is produced in the body by

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

means of the Prâ*n*a <span id="fr_1279"></span>[1](sbe0834.htm#fn_1274),
and which then goes into the Apâna, and then becoming assimilated with
the Udâna leaves the body <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[2](sbe0834.htm#fn_1275), and with the Vyâna
envelopes all the quarters <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[3](sbe0834.htm#fn_1276), then (finally) dwells in
the Samâna <span id="fr_1282"></span>[4](sbe0834.htm#fn_1277). So speech
formerly spoke. Hence the mind is distinguished by reason of its being
immovable, and the goddess distinguished by reason of her being
movable <span id="fr_1283"></span>[5](sbe0834.htm#fn_1278).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1247"></span>[261:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1252) Cf.
Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a, p. 411, and Âra*n*yaka, p. 281.

<span id="fn_1248"></span>[261:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1253) Cf.
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 459. The reading in the printed edition of Bombay
is defective here.

<span id="fn_1249"></span>[261:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1254) See [p.
337](sbe0854.htm#page_337) seq., where all this is more fully explained.
And cf. the analogous Buddhistic doctrine stated at Lalita Vistara
(Translation by Dr. R. Mitra), p. 11.

<span id="fn_1250"></span>[261:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1255) See
Taittirîya-âra*n*yaka loc. cit., and cf. Gîtâ, [p.
61](sbe0806.htm#page_61). 'The wealth' probably means the Dakshi*n*â to
be given to the priests, which is mentioned at Gîtâ, [p.
119](sbe0819.htm#page_119).

<span id="fn_1251"></span>[261:5](sbe0833.htm#fr_1256) The 'priests'
here being the senses, the knowledge would accrue to them, as to which
cf. Gîtâ, [p. 108](sbe0816.htm#page_108).

<span id="fn_1252"></span>[261:6](sbe0833.htm#fr_1257) See note
 [3](#fn_1249).

<span id="fn_1253"></span>[262:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1258) Each sense can
only offer up its own perceptions--the mind offers up all knowledge
whatever.

<span id="fn_1254"></span>[262:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1259) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says this is an implied simile, the mind is an upholder of the body as
the, 'knower' or self is.

<span id="fn_1255"></span>[262:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1260) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says this means 'the mind.' I think it better to take it here as the
self (see [p. 238](sbe0829.htm#page_238) supra), to which the 'mind' and
the 'other,' mentioned further on, would be subordinate; the 'other'
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra renders by the 'group of the senses.' The senses are
compared to fires at Gîtâ, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61). The passage at
Taittirîya-âranyaka above cited refers only to the Gârhapatya and
Âhavanîya fires. Nîlaka*nth*a's text and explanation of this passage
are, to my mind, not nearly so satisfactory as Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's.

<span id="fn_1256"></span>[262:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1261) In the
Taittirîya-brâhmana and Âra*n*yaka loc. cit., the equivalent of the
original word for 'lord of speech' here occurs, viz. Vâkpati for
Vâ*k*aspati here; but that is there described as the Hot*ri* priest, and
speech itself as the Vedî or altar. The commentator there interprets
'lord of speech' to mean the wind which causes vocal activity, and
resides in the throat, palate, &c. As to mind and speech, see also
*Kh*ândogya, pp. 285-441, and comments of *S*a<u>n</u>kara there. The
meaning of this passage, however, is not by any means clear to my mind.
The Da*s*ahot*ri* mantras in the Taittirîya are stated to be the mantras
of the Ish*t*i, or sacrifice, performed by Pra*g*âpati for creation. It
is possible, then, that the meaning here is, that speech which is to be
learnt by the pupil, as stated further on--namely, the Vedas--was first
produced from that Ish*t*i (cf. Kullûka on Manu I, 21). But to
understand that speech, mind is necessary; hence it is said to look up
to the mind. The Brâhma*n*a's, wife, however, seems to understand speech
as ordinary speech, hence her question.

<span id="fn_1257"></span>[263:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1262) This, again, is
to my mind very hard to understand. The original word for 'intelligence'
is mati, which at *Kh*ândogya, p. 514, *S*a<u>n</u>kara interprets thus:
'intelligence is pondering, application to (literally, respect for) the
subject of thought.' The original for 'developed,' Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
renders by 'mixed or assimilated with;' and 'does not comprehend,' he
takes to mean 'does not understand--speech or words.' This question
appears to suggested by the last words of the, previous speech.

<span id="fn_1258"></span>[263:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1263) These two
sentences are again very obscure. Nîlaka*nth*a, as usual, deserts his
original, giving peculiar meanings to the words without producing any
authority. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra is very meagre, and besides the MS. is very
incorrect. See [p. 264](#page_264), note  [5](#fn_1265) infra.

<span id="fn_1259"></span>[263:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1264) I. e.
Pra*g*âpati, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, which seems to be justified by the
sequel. Nîlaka*nth*a takes it to mean the individual self, which
doubtless is its meaning elsewhere, e.g. Maitrî, p. 56.

<span id="fn_1260"></span>[263:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1265) I. e. speech
conveys information on all matters, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra; <span
id="page_264">p. 264</span> as the means of acquiring desired fruit,
visible or invisible, is learnt by speech, Nîlaka*nth*a. Cf. as to all
this, B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka-upanishad, pp. 50 seq. and 261.

<span id="fn_1261"></span>[264:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1266) I. e.
Nîlaka*nth*a says, 'the Brâhma*n*a named mind,' alluding apparently to
[p. 310](sbe0846.htm#page_310) infra. But the reading of some of the
MSS., viz. Brahman for the Brâhma*n*a, seems preferable, having regard
to what follows. Apparently, the Brâhma*n*a's own speech should begin at
'The goddess speech' further on.

<span id="fn_1262"></span>[264:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1267) Nîlaka*nth*a
says, immovable = to be understood by the external senses; movable = not
perceptible by senses, such as heaven, &c., which is not quite
intelligible. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says, the immovable mind is that of the
teacher, which is fixed, as it has not to learn or acquire anything,
while that of the pupil is movable as acquiring new impressions and
knowledge.

<span id="fn_1263"></span>[264:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1268) I. e. it is the
movable mind which takes cognisance of the significations of all mantras
(sacred texts), letters, tones, in which, I presume, sacred instruction
is conveyed. To this mind, speech is superior, as that mind only works
on what speech places before it; but the mind which is 'with'
Pra*g*âpati, is superior to speech as it is not dependent on speech like
the other.

<span id="fn_1264"></span>[264:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1269) I. e. proudly,
about her being the giver of desires to Brahman.

<span id="fn_1265"></span>[264:5](sbe0833.htm#fr_1270) I. e., says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, the words will not come out with the Prâ*n*a life-wind
and convey any sense to the hearer, but will be absorbed down into the
Apâna life-wind, and not be articulated as speech at all. Cf.
Kaushîtaki, p. 41; Ka*th*a, p. 184 (with glosses); and *Kh*ândogya, p.
42.

<span id="fn_1266"></span>[264:6](sbe0833.htm#fr_1271) I. e., I presume,
was dependent on the two life-winds named. Cf. [p.
353](sbe0856.htm#page_353) infra. For this sense of the word 'between,'
see [p. 258](sbe0832.htm#page_258) supra, and *Kh*ândogya-upanishad, p.
623.

<span id="fn_1267"></span>[265:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1272) And not with the
Prâ*n*a, so as to be articulated. Cf. [p. 264](#page_264).

<span id="fn_1268"></span>[265:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1273) I. e. to withdraw
the 'curse' pronounced, as above stated.

<span id="fn_1269"></span>[265:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1274) After the curse
was withdrawn, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Cf. B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 317.

<span id="fn_1270"></span>[265:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1275) Since, says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, noiseless speech is the source of all
words--Vâ<u>n</u>maya. Perhaps we may compare Aitareya-brâhmana (Haug),
p. 47.

<span id="fn_1271"></span>[265:5](sbe0833.htm#fr_1276) Viz.
Vâ<u>n</u>maya; milk, as a source of pleasure.

<span id="fn_1272"></span>[265:6](sbe0833.htm#fr_1277) I. e.
enlightening, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. But, perhaps, the translation should be,
'has powers divine and not divine.' As to this, cf. Sâ<u>n</u>khya
Bhâshya on III, 41, and Sâ<u>n</u>khyatattvakaumudî, p. 118, and
Wilson's Sânkhya Kârikâ, p. 37 (Sanskrit), and *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 284
(gloss).

<span id="fn_1273"></span>[265:7](sbe0833.htm#fr_1278) Ar*g*una Mitra
refers to a '*S*atapatha text' in praise of the subtle speech. I cannot
trace the text. But see Nirukta (Roth), pp. 167-187.
