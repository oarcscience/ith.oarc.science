#### XIII. <span class="smallcaps">Light And Darkness</span> <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48)

In the Lord is to be veiled this universe, whatsoever stirs in the
world. With renunciation thereof <span id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49)
thou mayst enjoy; lust thou after the wealth of none.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

One may seek to live a hundred years doing works here. So it is with
thee, not otherwise; his work defiles not man. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50)

Dæmonic are in sooth these worlds, veiled in blind darkness; into them
pass after death whatsoever folk slay their own souls.

The One, unstirring, is yet swifter than the mind; the gods cannot reach
it as it travels before. Standing it outspeeds others that run; in it
the Wind-spirit lays the waters.

It stirs, and stirs not; it is far, and near. It is within all, and
outside all that is.

But he who discerns all creatures in his Self, and his Self in all
creatures, has no disquiet thence.

What delusion, what grief can be with him in whom all creatures have
become the very self of the thinker discerning their oneness?

He has spread around, a thing bright, bodiless, taking no hurt,
sinewless, pure, unsmitten by evil; a sage, wise, encompassing,
self-existent, he has duly assigned purposes for all time.

Into blind darkness pass they who worship Ignorance; into still greater
dark they who are content with Knowledge. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51)

It is neither what comes by Knowledge, they

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

say, nor what comes by Ignorance; thus have we heard from the sages who
taught us this lore.

He who understands both Knowledge and Ignorance <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52) passes by Ignorance over death and by
Knowledge enjoys deathlessness.

Into blind darkness pass they who worship Change-into-naught; into still
greater dark they who worship Change-into-aught. <span
id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53)

It is neither what comes by Change-into-aught, they say, nor what comes
by Change-into-naught; thus have we heard from the sages who taught us
this lore.

He who understands <span id="fr_54"></span>[3](#fn_54) both
Change-into-aught and Destruction passes by Destruction over death and
by Change-into-aught enjoys deathlessness.

The face of truth is covered with a golden bowl. O Pūshan, remove it,
that the keeper of truths may see. <span id="fr_55"></span>[4](#fn_55)

O Pūshan, sole seer, O Yama, Sun, child of

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Prajā-pati, part
asunder thy rays, mass together thy radiance. I see that fairest shape
of thee. Yonder, yonder spirit am I.

The breath to the everlasting wind; and be this body ended in ashes.

Om! remember, O my spirit, remember the work! remember, O my spirit,
remember the work! O Fire, lead us by good ways to riches, thou god who
knowest all courses; keep far from us crooked sin, and we will offer to
thee exceeding homage and praise. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_48"></span>[88:1](brk41.htm#fr_48) The Īśāvāsya or
Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā Upanishad.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[88:2](brk41.htm#fr_49)Viz. of the phenomenal
world of sense-perception.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[89:1](brk41.htm#fr_50) Provided he has
knowledge of Brahma.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[89:2](brk41.htm#fr_51) "Ignorance" probably
means the conception of the phenomenal world as really existent in
itself; "Knowledge," the attempt to trace the universe back to a first
principle different from the Self.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[90:1](brk41.htm#fr_52) Viz. he who knows both
these forms of knowledge to be delusive.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[90:2](brk41.htm#fr_53) The author here attacks
those who believe that Being undergoes change either into non-being or
into a different phase of being. His cardinal principle is that Being is
one and changeless.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[90:3](brk41.htm#fr_54) I.e., he who knows both
ideas to be false.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[90:4](brk41.htm#fr_55) This and the following
verses (a death-bed prayer, according to tradition) are a prayer to the
Sun-god to reveal the figure of the *Purusha* in the sun (corresponding
to the figure in the human eye, and symbolic of Brahma; see p. 16). The
Sun-god is here identified with Yama, the ruler of the dead. On
Prajā-pati, see p. 14; in the next extract he is mythically represented
as a teacher of philosophic lore.
