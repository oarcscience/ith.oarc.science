<p>"If one should smite upon the root of this great tree, beloved, it would sweat sap, and live. If one should smite upon its midst, it would sweat sap, and live. If one should smite upon its top, it would sweat sap, and live. Instinct with the Live Self, it stands full lush and glad.</p>  
<p>But if the Live One leave one bough, it withers. If it leave another bough, it withers. If it leave a third bough, it withers. If it leave the whole, the whole withers. So know, beloved," said he,</p>

<p>"the thing whence the Live One has departed does indeed die; but the Live One dies not. In this subtleness has this All its essence; it is the True; it is the Self; thou art it, &#346;vetaketu."</p>

<p>"Bring from yonder a fig."</p>  
<p>"Here it is, my lord."</p>  
<p>"Break it."</p>  
<p>"It is broken, my lord."</p>  
<p>"What seest thou in it? "</p>  
<p>"Here are but little seeds, my lord."</p>  
<p>"Now break one of them."</p>  
<p>"It is broken, my lord."</p>  
<p>"What seest thou in it?"</p>  
<p>"Naught whatsoever, my lord."</div></p>  
<p>And he said to him: "Of that subtleness which thou canst not behold, beloved, is this great fig-tree made. Have faith, beloved. In this subtleness has this All its essence; it is the True; it is the Self; thou art it, &#346;vetaketu."</p>

<p>"Be it so, beloved," said he.</div></p>  
<p>"Lay this salt in water, and on the morrow draw nigh to me." And he did so. Then he said to him: "Bring me the salt which thou laidst in the water yester eve."</p>

<p>He felt, but found it not; it was as melted away.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Drink from this end thereof. How is it?"</p>  
<p>"It is salty."</p>  
<p>"Drink from the midst. How is it?"</p>  
<p>"It is salty."</p>  
<p>"Drink from yonder end. How is it?"</p>  
<p>"It is salty."</p>  
<p>"Lay it aside, and draw nigh to me." And he did so.</div></p>  
<p>"It is still present," said he to him; "herein forsooth thou canst not behold Being, beloved, but herein soothly it is. In this subtleness has this All its essence; it is the True; it is the Self; thou art it, &#346;vetaketu."</p>
