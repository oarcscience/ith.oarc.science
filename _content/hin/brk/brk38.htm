"Nay, my lord," said Patanchala K&#257;pya, "I know it not." Then he said to Patanchala K&#257;pya and the students of sacrifice, "Knowest thou, K&#257;pya, that Inward Ruler who rules inwardly this world and the world beyond and all creatures?" "Nay, my lord," said Patanchala K&#257;pya, "I know him not." Then he said to Patanchala K&#257;pya and the students of sacrifice, "Verily, K&#257;pya, he who should know that Thread and that Inward Ruler knows Brahma, knows the worlds, knows the Vedas, knows the creatures, knows the Self, knows the All." This he said to them: this I know. If thou, Y&#257;jnavalkya, shalt drive home the Brahman's cows without knowing that Thread and that Inward Ruler, thy head shall split."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p>"Any man may say, "I know, I know"; but do thou say how thou knowest."</p>  
<p>"Truly, Gautama," said he, "the wind is that Thread; for by the wind as thread, Gautama, this world and the world beyond and all creatures are bound together. Therefore, Gautama, they say of a man who has died that his limbs are relaxed; for by the wind as thread, Gautama, were they bound together."</p>

Up. III. i. 1). The mention of a splitting head occurs several times in a similar connection in the Upanishads; practically it means that he who accepts the challenge and fails in these tourneys of wit is doomed to death by "visitation of God."</P>
