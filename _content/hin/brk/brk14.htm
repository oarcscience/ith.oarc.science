It is the universal subject of thought; but as it is itself the universe, and there is nothing beside, it is also its own object, like the Aristotelian &#0957;&#8057;&#0951;&#0963;&#0953;&#0962; &#0957;&#0959;&#8053;&#0963;&#0949;&#0969;&#0962;; and as it is above the conditions of space, time, and causality, we can say of it only that it <i>exists,</i> and is <i>Thought.</i></p>

VIII. iii. 4, XII. 3, Ka&#7789;h. v. 15, &#346;vet. VI. 14.</p>
