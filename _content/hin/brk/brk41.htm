<p>In the Lord is to be veiled this universe, whatsoever stirs in the world. With renunciation thereof&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> thou mayst enjoy; lust thou after the wealth of none.</p>

<p>One may seek to live a hundred years doing works here. So it is with thee, not otherwise; his work defiles not man.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>D&aelig;monic are in sooth these worlds, veiled in blind darkness; into them pass after death whatsoever folk slay their own souls.</p>  
<p>The One, unstirring, is yet swifter than the mind; the gods cannot reach it as it travels before. Standing it outspeeds others that run; in it the Wind-spirit lays the waters.</p>  
<p>It stirs, and stirs not; it is far, and near. It is within all, and outside all that is.</p>  
<p>But he who discerns all creatures in his Self, and his Self in all creatures, has no disquiet thence.</p>  
<p>What delusion, what grief can be with him in whom all creatures have become the very self of the thinker discerning their oneness?</p>  
<p>He has spread around, a thing bright, bodiless, taking no hurt, sinewless, pure, unsmitten by evil; a sage, wise, encompassing, self-existent, he has duly assigned purposes for all time.</p>  
<p>Into blind darkness pass they who worship Ignorance; into still greater dark they who are content with Knowledge.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p>He who understands both Knowledge and Ignorance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> passes by Ignorance over death and by Knowledge enjoys deathlessness.</p>  
<p>Into blind darkness pass they who worship Change-into-naught; into still greater dark they who worship Change-into-aught.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>It is neither what comes by Change-into-aught, they say, nor what comes by Change-into-naught; thus have we heard from the sages who taught us this lore.</p>  
<p>He who understands&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> both Change-into-aught and Destruction passes by Destruction over death and by Change-into-aught enjoys deathlessness.</p>  
<p>The face of truth is covered with a golden bowl. O P&#363;shan, remove it, that the keeper of truths may see.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p>The breath to the everlasting wind; and be this body ended in ashes.</p>  
<p>Om! remember, O my spirit, remember the work! remember, O my spirit, remember the work! O Fire, lead us by good ways to riches, thou god who knowest all courses; keep far from us crooked sin, and we will offer to thee exceeding homage and praise.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="brk42.htm#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_49"></A><A HREF="brk41.htm#fr_49">88:2</A>Viz. of the phenomenal world of sense-perception.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_50"></A><A HREF="brk41.htm#fr_50">89:1</A> Provided he has knowledge of Brahma.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_51"></A><A HREF="brk41.htm#fr_51">89:2</A> "Ignorance" probably means the conception of the phenomenal world as really existent in itself; "Knowledge," the attempt to trace the universe back to a first principle different from the Self.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_52"></A><A HREF="brk41.htm#fr_52">90:1</A> Viz. he who knows both these forms of knowledge to be delusive.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_53"></A><A HREF="brk41.htm#fr_53">90:2</A> The author here attacks those who believe that Being undergoes change either into non-being or into a different phase of being. His cardinal principle is that Being is one and changeless.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_54"></A><A HREF="brk41.htm#fr_54">90:3</A> I.e., he who knows both ideas to be false.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_55"></A><A HREF="brk41.htm#fr_55">90:4</A> This and the following verses (a death-bed prayer, according to tradition) are a prayer to the Sun-god to reveal the figure of the <i>Purusha</i> in the sun (corresponding to the figure in the human eye, and symbolic of Brahma; see p. 16). The Sun-god is here identified with Yama, the ruler of the dead. On Praj&#257;-pati, see p. 14; in the next extract he is mythically represented as a teacher of philosophic lore.</P>
