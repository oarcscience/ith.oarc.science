#### XI. <span class="smallcaps">The Wisdom of Raikva</span> <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39)

Jānaśruti Pautrāyaṇa was a devout giver, bestowing much largesse,
preparing much food. He caused lodgings to be built everywhere, that he
might have men everywhere fed. Now in the night there flew swans by. One
swan said to another, "Ho, ho, Dim-eye, Dim-eye! Jānaśruti

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pautrāyaṇa's
splendour is outspread like that of the heavens; so touch it not, lest
thou burn thyself."

The other answered him, "Who forsooth is he of whom thou speakest as
though he were Raikva of the Cart?"

"What meanest thou by Raikva of the Cart?"

"As the lower dice-throws fall under the winning four-throw, so
whatsoever good deed the people do falls to him; of him who knows this
and of that which he knows do I speak." <span
id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40)

Jānaśruti Pautrāyaṇa overheard this. When he rose up, he said to his
chamberlain, "Ho, thou speakest as of Raikva of the Cart <span
id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41); what meanest thou by Raikva of the Cart?"

"As the lower dice-throws fall under the winning four-throw, so
whatsoever good deed the people do falls to him; of him who knows this
and of that which he knows do I speak."

The chamberlain sought \[Raikva\], and came back, saying "I have found
him not." \[Jānaśruti\] said to him, "Ho, go for him in the place where
a Brahman is to be sought."

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

\[Raikva\] was under a waggon, scratching his scabs; and he <span
id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42) sat down before him, and said to him, "Art
thou Raikva of the Cart, my lord?"

"Yea, I am," he answered.

The chamberlain came back, saying, "I have found him."

Then Jānaśruti Pautrāyaṇa took six hundred kine, a golden chain, and a
mule-car, and drew near to him, and said, "Raikva, here are six hundred
kine, a golden chain, and a mule-car; my lord, teach me the deity that
thou worshippest."

But the other answered, "Fie on thee, base fellow; keep them for
thyself, with thy kine!"

Then Jānaśruti Pautrāyaṇa took a thousand kine, a golden chain, a
mule-car, and his daughter, and drew near to him, and said, "Raikva,
here are a thousand kine, a golden chain, a mule-car, a wife, and the
village in which thou art sitting; my lord, teach me!"

He lifted up her face, and said, "He has brought these! Base fellow,
with this face alone thou mightest have made me speak."

That is the place called Raikva-parṇa in the land of the Mahāvṛishas
where he dwelt at his bidding.

Thus he said to him:

"The Wind in sooth is an ingatherer. When fire goes out, it sinks into
the Wind. When the sun goes down, it sinks into the Wind. When

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

the moon goes down, it sinks into the Wind. When waters dry up, they
sink into the Wind. For the Wind gathers in all these. Thus as to
godhead.

Now as to personality. The Breath is an in-gatherer. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43) When one sleeps, the speech sinks into the
Breath, the eye into the Breath, the ear into the Breath, the mind into
the Breath. For the Breath gathers in all these. These are the two
ingatherers, the Wind among the gods and the Breath among the breaths.

A Brahman-student begged alms of Śaunaka Kāpeya and Abhipratāri
Kākshaseni when their meal was set before them. They gave him nothing.
He said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Who is the one God, guardian of the world,  
Who swallowed up the other mighty four?  
On him, Kāpeya, mortals may not look;  
Abhipratāri, many are his homes.

</div>

To him forsooth who has this food it is not given."

Then Śaunaka Kāpeya, having pondered, answered him thus:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The spirit of the Gods, the creatures’ sire,  
Golden of tooth and greedy he, nor witless.  
Exceeding is his majesty, they say,  
For he uneaten eats what none may eat.

</div>

"So this is what we worship, O Brahman student.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Give him alms!"
And they gave to him.

These in sooth are the ten, five and five <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](brk40.htm#fn_44); this is the four-throw.
Therefore the ten, the four-throw, are in all parts of the world as
food. This is Virāṭ, eater of food; thereby all the world is seen. All
the world is seen by him, he becomes an eater of food, who has this
knowledge."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_39"></span>[80:1](brk39.htm#fr_39) Chhāndogya Upanishad,
IV. 1-3.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[81:1](brk39.htm#fr_40) The Hindus know of four
casts of the dice—the *kṛita,* counting as four, the *tretā,* counting
as three, the *dvāpara,* counting as two, and the *kali,* reckoned as
one; the *kṛita* outweighs all the other throws, and hence has the value
of 10. Raikva has universal wisdom; hence the virtues of all other men
are merely parts of his excellence, which includes them all.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[81:2](brk39.htm#fr_41) The chamberlain, after
Hindu custom, had addressed him in strains of panegyric on his rising
from bed.
