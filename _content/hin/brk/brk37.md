#### IX. <span class="smallcaps">The Everlasting Nay</span> <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33)

Verily this great unborn Self it is that is compact of understanding
amid the life-breaths, that lies in the ether within the heart, master
of all, lord of all, ruler of all; He becomes not greater by a good deed
nor less by an ill deed; He is king of all, ruler of born beings,
guardian of born beings, the dyke holding asunder these worlds that they
fall not one into another. Brahmans seek to know Him by reading the
Veda, by sacrifice, by charity, by mortification. Knowing

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Him, a man becomes
a saint; wandering friars wander forth seeking Him for their world.
Understanding this, the ancients desired not offspring: "What is
offspring to us who have this Self for this world?" So having departed
from desire of sons, from desire of substance, and desire of the world,
they went about begging. For desire of sons is desire of substance,
desire of substance is desire of the world; these are both desires.

This Self is *Nay, Nay:* not to be grasped, for He is not grasped; not
to be broken, for He is not broken; unclinging, for He clings not; He is
not bound, He trembles not, He takes no hurt. One \[who knows this\] is
overcome neither by having done evil for His sake nor by having done
good for His sake; he overcomes both; work done and work not done grieve
him not.

This is said by a verse:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Brahman's constant majesty by works  
Nor waxes more, nor wanes. This shall he trace;  
This known, ill deeds defile him nevermore.
