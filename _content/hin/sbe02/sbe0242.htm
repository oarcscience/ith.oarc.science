<p>1. This reception of guests is an everlasting (<I>S</I>rauta)-sacrifice offered by the householder to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. The fire in the stomach of the guest (represents) the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, (the sacred fire) in the house of the host represents the G&acirc;rhapatya, the fire at which the food for the guest is cooked (represents) the fire used for cooking the sacrificial viands (the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;gni).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>3. He who eats before his guest consumes the food, the prosperity, the issue, the cattle, the merit which his family acquired by sacrifices and charitable works.</p>  
<p>4. Food (offered to guests) which is mixed with milk procures the reward of an Agnish<I>t</I>oma-sacrifice. Food mixed with clarified butter procures the reward of an Ukthya, food mixed with honey the reward of an Atir&acirc;tra, food accompanied by meat the reward of a Dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha, (food and) water numerous offspring and long life.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. It is declared in the Veda, 'Both welcome and indifferent guests procure heaven (for their host).'</p>

<p>6. When he gives food in the morning, at noon, and in the evening, (these gifts) are the Savanas (of that sacrifice offered to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>7. When he rises after his guest has risen (to depart), that act represents the Udavas&acirc;n&icirc;y&acirc; ish<I>t</I>i (of a Vedic sacrifice).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>8. When he addresses (the guest) kindly, that kind address (represents) the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. When he follows (his departing guest, his steps represent) the steps of Vishnu.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. When he returns (after having accompanied his guest), that (act represents) the Avabh<I>ri</I>tha, (the final bath performed after the completion of a sacrifice.)</p>  
<p>11. Thus (a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a shall treat) a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, (and a Kshatriya and a Vai<I>s</I>ya their caste-fellows.)</p>  
<p>12. If a guest comes to a king, he shall make (his Purohita) honour him more than himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. If a guest comes to an Agnihotrin, he himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_601"></A><A HREF="#fn_600"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>

<p>shall go to meet him and say to him: 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, where didst thou stay (last night)?' (Then he offers water, saying): 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, here is water.' (Next he offers milk or the like, saying): 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may (these fluids) refresh (thee).'</p>  
<p>14. (If the guest stays at the time of the Agnihotra, he shall make him sit down to the north of the fire and) murmur in a low voice, before offering the oblations: 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy heart desires;' 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy will is;' 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy wish is;' 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy desire is.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_602"></A><A HREF="#fn_601"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>15. If a guest comes, after the fires have been placed (on the altar), but before the oblations have been offered, (the host) himself shall approach him and say to him: 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows give me permission; I wish to sacrifice.' Then he shall sacrifice, after having received permission. A Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a declares that he commits a sin if he sacrifices without permission.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_602"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>16. He who entertains guests for one night obtains earthly happiness, a second night gains the middle air, a third heavenly bliss, a fourth the world of unsurpassable bliss; many nights procure endless worlds. That has been declared in the Veda.</p>  
<p>17. If an unlearned person who pretends to be</p>

Thus (the merit) of his (gift) becomes (as) great (as if a learned Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a had received it).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_593"></A><A HREF="sbe0242.htm#fr_594">117:2</A> in the first S&ucirc;tra the reception of guests had been compared to an everlasting Vedic sacrifice. This analog is traced further in detail in this S&ucirc;tra. One of the chief characteristics of a Vedic sacrifice is the vit&acirc;na, or the use of three sacred fires. Hence &Acirc;pastamba shows that three fires also are used in offering hospitality to guests. </P>
