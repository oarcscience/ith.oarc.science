<p>1. If he has any doubts regarding the caste and conduct of a person who has come to him in order to fulfil his duty (of learning the Veda), he shall kindle a fire (with the ceremonies prescribed for kindling the sacrificial fire) and ask him about his caste and conduct.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_581"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. If he declares himself to be (of) good (family and conduct, the teacher elect) shall say, 'Agni who sees, V&acirc;yu who hears, &Acirc;ditya who brings to light, vouch for his goodness; may it be well with this person! He is free from sin.' Then he shall begin to teach him.</p>  
<p>3. A guest comes to the house resembling a burning fire.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p>4. He is called a <I>S</I>rotriya who, observing the law (of studentship), has learned one recension of the Veda (which may be current in his family).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_584"></A><A HREF="#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. He is called a guest (who, being a <I>S</I>rotriya), approaches solely for the fulfilment of his religious duties, and with no other object, a householder who lives intent on the fulfilment of his duties.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. The reward for honouring (such a guest) is immunity from misfortunes, and heavenly bliss.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>7. He shall go to meet such (a guest), honour him according to his age (by the formulas of salutation prescribed), and cause a seat to be given to him.</p>  
<p>8. Some declare that, if possible, the seat should have many feet.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. The (householder himself) shall wash the feet of that (guest); according to some, two <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras shall do it.</p>  
<p>10. One of them shall be employed in pouring water (over the guest, the other in washing his feet).</p>  
<p>11. Some declare that the water for the (guest) shall be brought in an earthen vessel.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></p>  
<p>12. But (a guest) who has not yet returned home from his teacher shall not be a cause for fetching water.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. In case a (student comes, the host) shall repeat the Veda (together with him) for a longer time (than with other guests).</p>  
<p>14. He shall converse kindly (with his guest), and gladden him with milk or other (drinks), with eatables, or at least with water.</p>  
<p>15. He shall offer to his guest a room, a bed, a mattress, a pillow with a cover, and ointment, and what else (may be necessary).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>16. (If the dinner has been finished before the arrival of the guest), he shall call his cook and give him rice or yava for (preparing a fresh meal for) the guest.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>17. (If dinner is ready at the arrival of the guest), he himself shall portion out the food and look at it, saying (to himself), 'Is this (portion) greater, or this?'</p>  
<p>18. He shall say, 'Take out a larger (portion for the guest).'</p>  
<p>19. A guest who is at enmity (with his host) shall not eat his food, nor (shall he eat the food of a host) who hates him or accuses him of a crime, or of one who is suspected of a crime.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>20. For it is declared in the Veda that he (who eats the food of such a person) eats his guilt.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_581"></A><A HREF="sbe0241.htm#fr_582">114:1</A> <b>6</b>. The person desirous to study addresses his teacher elect with the following Mantra: Bhagavan maitre<I>n</I>a <I>k</I>akshush&acirc; pa<I>s</I>ya <I>s</I>ivena manas&acirc;nug<I>ri</I>h&acirc;<I>n</I>a pras&icirc;da m&acirc;m adhy&acirc;paya, 'venerable Sir, look on me with a friendly eye, receive me with a favourable mind, be kind and teach me.' The teacher elect then asks: Ki<I>m</I>gotro &#8217;si saumya, kim&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ra<I>h</I>, 'friend, of what family art thou? what is thy rule of conduct?'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_582"></A><A HREF="sbe0241.htm#fr_583">114:3</A> The object of this S&ucirc;tra is to show the absolute necessity of feeding a guest. For, if offended, he might burn the house with the flames of his anger.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_583"></A><A HREF="sbe0241.htm#fr_584">115:4</A> The object of this S&ucirc;tra is to complete the definition of the term 'guest' to be given in the following S&ucirc;tra. In my translation I have followed Haradatta's gloss. The literal sense of &Acirc;pastamba's words is,. 'He who, observing the law, has studied one recension of each (of the four) Vedas, becomes a <I>S</I>rotriya.' Haradatta says this definition would be contrary to the current acceptation of the term. That argument proves, however, nothing for &Acirc;pastamba's times.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_586"></A><A HREF="sbe0241.htm#fr_587">115:8</A> Haradatta states that this is also &Acirc;pastamba's opinion.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_587"></A><A HREF="sbe0241.htm#fr_588">115:11</A> According to Haradatta, &Acirc;pastamba is of opinion that it should be brought in a pot made of metal.</P>
