2\. (The four orders are, that of) the student, (that of) the

24\. (He shall be) indifferent towards (all) creatures, (whether they do

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

practising austerities. <span id="fr_904"></span>[26](#fn_903)

27\. Kindling the fire according to the (rule of the) *S*râmanaka

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_889"></span>[192:1](sbe0267.htm#fr_890) **III**. Other
Sm*ri*tikâras maintain that a Brâhma*n*a must pass through all the four
orders. Compare Âpastamba II, 9, 21, 5; Manu VI, 34-38; and the long
discussion on the comparative excellence of the orders of householders
and of ascetics. Âpastamba II, 9, 2 3, 3-II, 9, 2 4, 14.

<span id="fn_890"></span>[192:2](sbe0267.htm#fr_891) 'Though the order
of studentship has already been described above, still in the following
chapter the rules for a professed (naish*th*ika) student will be given
(and it had therefore again to be mentioned). Bhikshu has generally been
translated by ascetic (sannyâsin). Vaikhânasa, literally, he who lives
according to the rule promulgated by Vikhanas, means hermit. For that
(sage) has chiefly taught that order. In all other *S*âstras (the order
of) hermits is the third, and (the order of) ascetics the fourth. Here a
different arrangement is adopted. The reason of the displacement of the
hermit is that the author considers the first-named three orders
preferable. Hence if a man chooses to pass through all four, the
sequence is that prescribed in other *S*âstras.'--Haradatta. In making
these statements the commentator has apparently forgotten that Âpastamba
(II, 9, 21, 1) agrees exactly with Gautama. It is, however, very
probable that Haradatta has given correctly the reason why the hermit is
placed last by our author and by Âpastamba.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[193:3](sbe0267.htm#fr_892) Manu VI, 87.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[193:4](sbe0267.htm#fr_893) Âpastamba I, 1, 4,
29.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[193:5](sbe0267.htm#fr_894) Âpastamba II, 9,
21, 6.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[193:6](sbe0267.htm#fr_895) According to
Haradatta the term Guru here includes the father. But see the next
Sûtra, where Guru can only mean the teacher.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[193:10](sbe0267.htm#fr_896) Âpastamba II, 9,
21, 3-4. My MSS. have uttareshâm, 'of the later named,' instead of
itareshâm, 'of the other' (orders), both in the Sûtra and in subsequent
quotations of the same.

<span id="fn_896"></span>[193:11](sbe0267.htm#fr_897) Âpastamba II, 9,
21, 8-10; Manu VI, 41-43; Colebrooke, Mitâksharâ II, 8, 7.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[193:13](sbe0267.htm#fr_898) This rule shows
that the Vasso of the Bauddhas and *G*ainas is also derived from a
Brahmanical source; see also Baudhâyana 11, 6, 11, 20.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[194:15](sbe0267.htm#fr_899) Manu VI, 55-56.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[194:19](sbe0267.htm#fr_900) Âpastamba II, 9, 2
1, 11.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[194:20](sbe0267.htm#fr_901) He shall not
appropriate, i.e. take parts of these, i.e. fruits, leaves, and the
like, which have not been detached, i.e. have not fallen off. But he may
take what has become detached spontaneously.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[194:21](sbe0267.htm#fr_902) Out of season,
i.e. except in the rainy season, during which, according to Sûtra 13, an
ascetic must not wander about.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[194:23](sbe0267.htm#fr_903) 'He shall avoid,
i.e. neither himself nor by the agency of others cause the destruction,
i.e. the pounding by means of a pestle or the like, of seeds, i.e. raw
rice and the like. Hence he shall accept as alms cooked food only, not
rice and the like.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[195:26](sbe0267.htm#fr_904) Âpastamba II, 9,
21, 18-II, 9, 23, 2. 'Austerities (tapas) means emaciating his
body.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[195:27](sbe0267.htm#fr_905) 'He shall offer
oblations in the morning and evening,' (these words), though not
expressed, are understood.

<span id="fn_905"></span>[195:29](sbe0267.htm#fr_906) i.e. he shall
perform the five Mahâya*gñ*as, just like a householder, only using
wild-growing fruits, roots, &c., for the oblations.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[195:31](sbe0267.htm#fr_907) 'They declare,
that baishka means the flesh of an animal, slain by a tiger or the like.
He may use even that. The word "even" implies blame. Hence this is a
rule for times of distress, and it must be understood that such food is
to be eaten only on failure of roots and fruits and the
like.'--Haradatta. The commentator adds that the flesh of forbidden
animals must be avoided.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[195:34](sbe0267.htm#fr_908) According to
Haradatta the lower garment shall be made of kira, which he again
explains as cloth made of Ku*s*a grass and the like, and the upper of a
skin.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[195:35](sbe0267.htm#fr_909) Haradatta reads
atisa*m*vatsaram, not atisâ*m*vatsaram, as in <span id="page_196">p.
196</span> Professor Stenzler's edition, though he notices the latter
reading. Manu VI, 15

<span id="fn_909"></span>[196:36](sbe0267.htm#fr_910) 'The duties of a
householder, the Agnihotra, and the like, are frequently prescribed and
praised in all Vedas, Dharma*s*âstras, and Itihâsas. As, therefore, the
order of householders is explicitly prescribed, this alone is the order
(obligatory on all men). But the other orders are prescribed only for
those unfit for the (duties of a householder). That is the opinion of
many teachers.'--Haradatta. Haradatta's explanation of â*k*âryâ*h*,
which he takes to mean 'many teachers,' seems to me inadmissible. Eke,
'some (teachers)', is used in that sense, and â*k*âryâ*h* cannot
possibly be a synonymous term. Further on (IV, 23) Haradatta himself
admits that by â*k*âryâ*h* one teacher is meant. It must be translated
'the venerable teacher,' because the Hindus are very fond of the use of
the pluralis majestatis. I have no doubt that Gautama means his own
teacher, whom, of course, etiquette forbids him to name. See also R.
Garbe, Uebersetzung des Vaitâna-sûtra, I, 3.
