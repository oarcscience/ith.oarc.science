### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 9, KHA*ND*A 25.

1\. He who has had connection with a Guru's wife shall cut off his organ
together with the testicles, take them into his joined hands and walk
towards the south without stopping, until he falls down dead. <span
id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_465)

2\. Or he may die embracing a heated metal image of a woman. <span
id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_466)

3\. A drinker of spirituous liquor shall drink exceedingly hot liquor so
that he dies. <span id="fr_468"></span>[3](#fn_467)

4\. A thief shall go to the king with flying hair, carrying a club on
his shoulder, and tell him his deed. He (the king) shall give him a blow
with that (club). If the thief dies, his sin is expiated. <span
id="fr_469"></span>[4](#fn_468)

5\. If he is forgiven (by the king), the guilt falls upon him who
forgives him, <span id="fr_470"></span>[5](#fn_469)

6\. Or he may throw himself into the fire, or perform repeatedly severe
austerities, <span id="fr_471"></span>[6](#fn_470)

7\. Or he may kill himself by diminishing daily his portion of food,

8\. Or he may perform K*rikkh*ra penances (uninterruptedly) for one
year. <span id="fr_472"></span>[8](#fn_471)

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

9\. Now they quote also (the following verse): <span
id="fr_473"></span>[9](#fn_472)

10\. Those who have committed a theft (of gold), drunk spirituous
liquor, or had connection with a Guru's wife, but not those who have
slain a Brâhma*n*a, shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food,
bathe at the times of the three libations (morning, noon, and evening),
passing the day standing and the night sitting. After the lapse of three
years they throw off their guilt.

11\. (A man of any caste) excepting the first, who has slain a man of
the first caste, shall go on a battle-field and place himself (between
the two hostile armies). There they shall kill him (and thereby he
becomes pure). <span id="fr_474"></span>[11](#fn_473)

12\. Or such a sinner may tear from his body and make the priest offer
as a burnt-offering his hair, skin, flesh, and the rest, and then throw
himself into the fire. <span id="fr_475"></span>[12](#fn_474)

13\. If a crow, a chameleon, a peacock, a Brâhma*n*î duck, a swan, the
vulture called Bhâsa, a frog, an ichneumon, a musk-rat, or a dog has
been killed, then the same penance as for a *S*ûdra must be
performed. <span id="fr_476"></span>[13](#fn_475)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_465"></span>[82:1](sbe0228.htm#fr_466) **25**. Haradatta's
explanation of a 'Guru's wife' by 'mother' rests on a comparison of
similar passages from other Sm*ri*tis, where a different 'penance' is
prescribed for incestuous intercourse with other near relations. Manu
XI, 105; Yâ*gñ*. III, 259.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[82:2](sbe0228.htm#fr_467) Manu XI, 104;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 259.

<span id="fn_467"></span>[82:3](sbe0228.htm#fr_468) Manu XI, 91, 92;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 253.

<span id="fn_468"></span>[82:4](sbe0228.htm#fr_469) I.e. who has stolen
the gold of a Brâhma*n*a. Manu VIII, 314, 316; XI, 99-101; Yâ*gñ*. III,
257.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[82:5](sbe0228.htm#fr_470) Manu VIII, 317.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[82:6](sbe0228.htm#fr_471) Manu XI, 102.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[82:8](sbe0228.htm#fr_472) According to
Haradatta this Sûtra refers to all kinds of sins and it must be
understood that the K*rikkh*ra penances must be heavy for great crimes,
and lighter for smaller faults; see also below, I, 9, 27, 7 and 8.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[83:9](sbe0228.htm#fr_473) Haradatta states
that the verse is taken from a Purâ*n*a.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[83:11](sbe0228.htm#fr_474) Manu XI, 74;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 248.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[83:12](sbe0228.htm#fr_475) The Mantras given
in the commentary, and a parallel passage of Vasish*th*a XX, 25-26, show
that this terrible penance is not altogether a mere theory of Âpastamba.
Yâ*gñ*. III, 247.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[83:13](sbe0228.htm#fr_476) 'According to some,
the penance must be performed if all these animals together have been
slain; according to others, if only one of them has been
killed.'--Haradatta. Manu XI, 132, 136 Yâ*gñ*. III, 270-272.
