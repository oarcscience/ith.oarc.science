### Footnotes

<span id="fn_400"></span>[65:1](sbe0221.htm#fr_401) **18**. Manu IV,
247. 'Ugra denotes either a bad twice-born man. or the offspring of a
Vai*s*ya and of a *S*ûdra-woman. Other persons of a similar character
must be understood to be included by the term.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[66:4](sbe0221.htm#fr_402) Also this rule seems
to belong to Hârita, on account of its close connection with the
preceding two.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[66:8](sbe0221.htm#fr_403) Haradatta quotes, in
support of the last Sûtras, a passage of the *Kh*ândogya Upanishad, I,
10, 1, and one from the .*Rig*-veda, IV, 18, 13, according to which it
would be lawful to eat even impure food, as a dog's entrails, under such
circumstances. Other commentators explain this and the preceding three
Sûtras differently. According to them the translation would run thus:
'If he himself does not find any livelihood (in times of distress, he
may dwell even with low-caste people who give him something to eat, and)
he may eat (food given by them) paying for it with (some small gift in)
gold or with animals.' This second explanation is perhaps preferable.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[66:9](sbe0221.htm#fr_404) Manu IV, 219, and
223.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[67:11](sbe0221.htm#fr_405) If a Brâhma*n*a who
has been ordered to perform a penance, performs a Vai*s*vadeva or other
rite without heeding the order of his spiritual teacher, then a student
who has returned home ought not to eat in his house, until the enjoined
penance has been performed.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[67:12](sbe0221.htm#fr_406) 'The use of the
part. perf. pass. "performed" indicates that he must not eat there,
whilst the penance is being performed.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[67:14](sbe0221.htm#fr_407) Yâ*gñ*. 1, 166.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[67:15](sbe0221.htm#fr_408) Manu IV, 223

<span id="fn_408"></span>[67:16](sbe0221.htm#fr_409) Manu IV, 209.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[67:17](sbe0221.htm#fr_410) Manu IV, 209;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 168.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[67:18](sbe0221.htm#fr_411) Manu IV, 2 10, 215;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 162-164.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[67:19](sbe0221.htm#fr_412) Yâ*gñ*. I, 164.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[68:21](sbe0221.htm#fr_413) Manu IV, 212;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 162.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[68:22](sbe0221.htm#fr_414) Manu IV, 210;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 161.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[68:23](sbe0221.htm#fr_415) 'That is to say,
one who has begun, but not finished a Soma-sacrifice.'--Haradatta. Manu
IV, 210, and Gopatha-brâhma*n*a III, 19.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[68:25](sbe0221.htm#fr_416) Aitareya-brâhma*n*a
II, 1, 9.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[68:27](sbe0221.htm#fr_417) Manu I V, 211;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 161.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[68:28](sbe0221.htm#fr_418) The village or town
messengers are always men of the lowest castes, such as the Mahârs of
Mahârâsh*th*ra.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[68:29](sbe0221.htm#fr_419) 'For example, he
who offers human blood in a magic rite.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[68:30](sbe0221.htm#fr_420) Haradatta explains
*k*ârî, translated by 'spy,' to mean 'a <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>
secret adherent of the *S*âkta sect' (gû*dh*a*k*ârî, *s*âkta*h*). The
existence of this sect in early times has not hitherto been proved.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[69:31](sbe0221.htm#fr_421) Haradatta gives the
*S*âkyas or Bauddhas as an instance. But it is doubtful, whether
Âpastamba meant to refer to them, though it seems probable that heretics
are intended.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[69:32](sbe0221.htm#fr_422) Yâ*gñ*. I, 160.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[69:33](sbe0221.htm#fr_423) 'Who avoids
everybody, i.e. who neither invites nor dines with anybody.'--Haradatta.
