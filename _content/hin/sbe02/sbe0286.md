### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1390"></span>[283:1](sbe0286.htm#fr_1391) **XXII**. The
text of the Sûtra consists of the single word 'penance' in the singular,
which, being the adhikâra or heading, must be taken with each of the
following Sûtras down to the end of chapter XXIII.

<span id="fn_1391"></span>[283:2](sbe0286.htm#fr_1392) Manu XI, 74.

<span id="fn_1392"></span>[283:3](sbe0286.htm#fr_1393) Âpastamba I, 9,
25, 11.

<span id="fn_1393"></span>[283:4](sbe0286.htm#fr_1394) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 11-20. Haradatta says, 'the foot of a bedstead' (kha*t*vâṅga) is
known in the case of the Pâ*s*upatas, and indicates thereby that he
interprets the term to mean 'a club shaped like the foot of a bedstead,'
which the Pâ*s*upatas wear.

<span id="fn_1394"></span>[283:5](sbe0286.htm#fr_1395) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 13.

<span id="fn_1395"></span>[284:6](sbe0286.htm#fr_1396) Âpastamba I, 9,
25, 10.

<span id="fn_1396"></span>[284:7](sbe0286.htm#fr_1397) Manu XI, 80;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 244-245.

<span id="fn_1397"></span>[284:8](sbe0286.htm#fr_1398) Âpastamba I, 9,
25, 21.

<span id="fn_1398"></span>[284:9](sbe0286.htm#fr_1399) Âpastamba I, 9,
25, 22.

<span id="fn_1399"></span>[284:10](sbe0286.htm#fr_1400) Haradatta names
the Pa*ñk*arâtra sacrifice as an instance of a *S*rauta ya*gñ*a, of
which an Agnish*t*ut forms part. He adds that another commentator
explain s the Sûtra to mean, 'or at any other sacrifice, provided that
an Agnish*t*ut sacrifice be its final ceremony.' Regarding the
Agnish*t*ut sacrifice, see also above, XIX, 10.

<span id="fn_1400"></span>[284:11](sbe0286.htm#fr_1401) Yâ*gñ*avalkya
III, 252.

<span id="fn_1401"></span>[284:12](sbe0286.htm#fr_1402) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 9; Manu XI, 88; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 251.

<span id="fn_1402"></span>[284:13](sbe0286.htm#fr_1403) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 8; Manu, Yâ*gñ*avalkya, loc. cit.

<span id="fn_1403"></span>[284:14](sbe0286.htm#fr_1404) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 1, 4. 'Prâk*ri*ta (normal) means natural <span id="page_285">p.
285</span> (svâbhâvika), i.e. not accompanied by the carrying of the
foot of a bedstead and the rest.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1404"></span>[285:15](sbe0286.htm#fr_1405) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 2, 4.

<span id="fn_1405"></span>[285:16](sbe0286.htm#fr_1406) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 3, 4.

<span id="fn_1406"></span>[285:17](sbe0286.htm#fr_1407) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 5; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 269. Haradatta says that this rule refers to
the expiation of the murder of a virtuous Brâhma*n*î.

<span id="fn_1407"></span>[285:18](sbe0286.htm#fr_1408) Âpastamba, I, 9,
26, 5; Manu XI, 109-116; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 263. Haradatta thinks that
the Sûtra refers to the cow of a virtuous *S*rotriya or of a poor
Brâhma*n*a who has many children.

<span id="fn_1408"></span>[285:19](sbe0286.htm#fr_1409) Âpastamba I, 9,
25, 13. Haradatta explains dahara to mean a small mouse, but gives the
meaning assigned to it in the translation as the opinion of others. He
states that all the animals named must have been intentionally injured
and together.

<span id="fn_1409"></span>[285:20](sbe0286.htm#fr_1410) Manu XI, 142;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 275.

<span id="fn_1410"></span>[285:21](sbe0286.htm#fr_1411) Âpastamba I, 9,
26, 2.

<span id="fn_1411"></span>[286:22](sbe0286.htm#fr_1412) Haradatta quotes
a verse showing that 'something' means eight handfuls (mush*t*i) of
grain.

<span id="fn_1412"></span>[286:23](sbe0286.htm#fr_1413) Manu XI, 134;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 273.

<span id="fn_1413"></span>[286:24](sbe0286.htm#fr_1414) Manu XI, 135.

<span id="fn_1414"></span>[286:25](sbe0286.htm#fr_1415) Manu XI, 34;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 273. Possibly da*nd*a, a bar, denotes here a
particular measure, as a da*nd*a is said to be equal to four hastas or
ninety-six aṅgulis.

<span id="fn_1415"></span>[286:26](sbe0286.htm#fr_1416) Manu XI, 139.

<span id="fn_1416"></span>[286:29](sbe0286.htm#fr_1417)-30. Âpastamba
II, 110, 27, 11.

<span id="fn_1417"></span>[286:33](sbe0286.htm#fr_1418) Haradatta says
that by the employment of Vedic texts, teaching or sacrificing is meant,
but that others refer the Sûtra <span id="page_287">p. 287</span> to the
performance of these acts in the company of, not for unworthy people.

<span id="fn_1418"></span>[287:35](sbe0286.htm#fr_1419) Manu XI, 189;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 297.

<span id="fn_1419"></span>[287:36](sbe0286.htm#fr_1420) Manu XI, 174.
Regarding the Kûshmâ*nd*as, see XIX, 12.
