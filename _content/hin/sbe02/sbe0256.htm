'Though four (orders) are enumerated, he uses the word "four," lest, in the absence of a distinct rule of the venerable teacher, one order only, that of the householder, should be allowed, as has been taught in other Sm<I>ri</I>tis.'--Haradatta. Manu VI, 87.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_724"></A><A HREF="sbe0256.htm#fr_725">153:8</A> The meaning of the S&ucirc;tra is, that the studentship is a necessary preliminary for the Sa<I>m</I>ny&acirc;sin. If a man considers sufficiently purified by his life in that order, he may become a Sa<I>m</I>ny&acirc;sin immediately after its completion. Otherwise he may first become a householder, or a hermit, and enter the last <A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A> order, when his passions are entirely extinct.

<P><A NAME="fn_728"></A><A HREF="sbe0256.htm#fr_729">154:15</A> Haradatta apparently takes the word <I>S</I>&acirc;stras to mean 'Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stras.'</P>

Therefore the meaning intended is, "He shall offer a Samidh morn and evening in the common fire, just as formerly, (during his studentship)." Another commentator says, "Gautama declares that he shall kindle a fire according to the rule of the <I>S</I>r&acirc;manaka S&ucirc;tra. The <I>S</I>r&acirc;manaka S&ucirc;tra is the Vaikh&acirc;nasa S&ucirc;tra.
