ability. <span id="fr_945"></span>[6](#fn_944)

division of the family estate. <span id="fr_946"></span>[7](#fn_945)

8\. The domestic (ceremonies must be performed) with (the aid of) that
(fire). <span id="fr_947"></span>[8](#fn_946)

9\. (Also) the sacrifices to the gods, manes, (and) men? and the private

18\. A gift of food shall be preceded by a libation of water and (it
shall be presented) after (the recipient) has been made to say, 'May
welfare attend thee,' <span id="fr_956"></span>[18](#fn_955)

19\. And the same (rule applies) to all gifts presented for the sake of
spiritual merit.

20\. The reward of a gift (offered) to a person who is not a Brâhma*n*a

24\. An untruth spoken by people under the influence of anger, excessive

id="fr_961"></span>[24](#fn_960)

25\. Before (a householder eats) he shall feed his guests, the infants,
the sick people, the pregnant women, the females under his protection,
the very aged men, and those of low condition (who may be in his
house). <span id="fr_962"></span>[25](#fn_961)

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

26\. But (when) his teacher, parents (or intimate) friends (visit his
house), he shall proceed to the preparation of the dinner after asking
them (for orders). <span id="fr_963"></span>[26](#fn_962)

31\. (But to a king) who is not a *S*rotriya a seat and water. <span
id="fr_966"></span>[31](#fn_965)

32\. But for a *S*rotriya he shall cause to be prepared a foot-bath, an
Arghya, and food of a superior quality. <span
id="fr_967"></span>[32](#fn_966)

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

33\. Or his usual food distinguished by a (particularly careful)
preparation. <span id="fr_968"></span>[33](#fn_967)

<span id="fn_943"></span>[201:5](sbe0269.htm#fr_944) Manu III, 82
Yâ*gñ*. I, 104. 'The word "and" indicates that water must be offered to
the gods and *Ri*shis also.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[201:6](sbe0269.htm#fr_945) '(Rites) other than
those prescribed in Sûtras 3-5 he may perform according to his energy,
i.e. according to his ability. But those he should zealously perform. As
the oblations to the gods and the other (Mahâya*gñ*as) are mentioned
before the kindling of the domestic fire, they must be performed by a
person who has not yet kindled the domestic fire with the aid of the
common (kitchen) fire.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[201:7](sbe0269.htm#fr_946) As long as the
family remains united, its head offers the oblations for all its
members.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[201:8](sbe0269.htm#fr_947) 'The domestic
rites, i.e. the Pu*m*savana and the rest. . . . Now with the aid of
which fire must a man, who has not yet kindled the domestic fire,
perform the Pu*m*savana, &c.? Some answer that he shall use a common
fire. But the opinion of the teacher (Gautama) is that he shall use the
sacred fire which has been kindled on that occasion.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[201:9](sbe0269.htm#fr_948) Haradatta states
that the Mahâya*gñ*as are again enumerated in order to show that a
person who has kindled the sacred fire shall use this for them, not a
common fire. He also states that a passage of U*s*anas, according to
which some teachers prescribe the performance of the daily recitation
near the sacred fire, shows that this rite too has a connection with the
sacred fire.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[202:10](sbe0269.htm#fr_949) Âpastamba II, 2,
3, 16, where, however, as in all other works, the order of the offerings
differs. Haradatta adds that the word 'oblations' is used in the Sûtra
in order to indicate that the word svâhâ must be pronounced at the end
of each Mantra, and that the expression 'in the fire' indicates that the
Bali-offerings described in the following Sûtra must be thrown on the
ground.

<span id="fn_949"></span>[202:11](sbe0269.htm#fr_950) Compare Âpastamba
II, 2, 3, 20-II, 2, 4, 8; Manu III, 87-90, where, as elsewhere, the
order of the offerings differs. According to Haradatta the deities
intended are, Indra, Agni, Yama, Nir*ri*ti, Varu*n*a, Vâyu, Soma, and
Î*s*âna. The first offering must be placed to the east, the next to the
south-east, south, &c.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[202:12](sbe0269.htm#fr_951) At all the doors,
as many as there are, a Bali must be offered with the Mantra, 'To the
Maruts, svâhâ.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_951"></span>[202:13](sbe0269.htm#fr_952) 'As he says
"inside" (pravi*s*ya, literally "entering") he must stand outside while
offering the Balis at the doors. At this occasion some require the
following Mantra, "To the deities of the dwelling, svâhâ," because that
is found in the Â*s*valâyana (G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 2, 4). Others consider
it necessary to mention the deities by name, and to present as many
offerings as there are deities, while pronouncing the required
words.'--Haradatta. The commentator then goes on to quote a passage from
U*s*anas, which he considers applicable, because it contains the names
of the G*ri*hadevatâs. I doubt, however, if the 'others' are right, and
still more if, in case they should be right, it would be advisable to
supply the names of the G*ri*hadevatâs from U*s*anas.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[203:14](sbe0269.htm#fr_953) 'Because the word
"and" occurs in Sûtra 11 after the word "to the deities presiding over
the points of the horizon" a Bali-offering must be presented to the
deities mentioned by the author in Sûtra 10, viz. to the earth, wind,
Pra*g*âpati, and to all the gods, after a Bali has been offered to
Brahman.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[203:16](sbe0269.htm#fr_954) 'The Bali
presented to Âkâ*s*a, "the ether," must be thrown up into the air, as
Manu says, III, 90.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[203:17](sbe0269.htm#fr_955) 'Because of the
word "and," he must, also, present Balis to the deities mentioned
above.'--Haradatta. The commentator means to say that in the evening not
only the 'Beings walking about at night' (nakta*mk*ara) are to receive a
portion, but all the other deities too, and that the Balikarma must be
offered twice a day.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[203:18](sbe0269.htm#fr_956)-19. Âpastamba II,
4, 9, 8.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[203:20](sbe0269.htm#fr_957) According to
Haradatta the term *S*rotriya here denotes one who has studied one Veda,
(but see also Âpastamba II, 3, 6, 4; II, 4, 8, 5.) Vedapâraga is a man
who has studied one Veda, together with the Aṅgas, Kalpa-sûtras, and
Upanishads.

<span id="fn_957"></span>[203:21](sbe0269.htm#fr_958) Âpastamba II, 5,
10, 1-2. 'Now he promulgates a Sûtra which refers to those cases where
one must necessarily make gifts, and where one incurs guilt by a
refusal. . . . As the expression "outside the Vedi" is used, presents
must be given to others also "inside the Vedi" (i.e. fees to priests,
&c.)'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_958"></span>[204:22](sbe0269.htm#fr_959) Âpastamba II, 2,
4, 14.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[204:23](sbe0269.htm#fr_960) Âpastamba II, 5,
10, 3; Colebrooke II, Digest IV, 47; Mayûkha IX, 5. 'As he says "for an
unlawful purpose," what has been promised must in other cases
necessarily be given.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_960"></span>[204:24](sbe0269.htm#fr_961) Colebrooke II,
Digest IV, 56. '"Does not cause (the speaker) to fall," i.e. produces no
guilt. Hence such persons need not even give a promised
present.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_961"></span>[204:25](sbe0269.htm#fr_962) Âpastamba II, 2,
4, 11-13; II, 4, 9, 10; Manu III, 116. 'Females under his protection
(suvâsinya*h*), i.e. daughters and sisters those of low condition
(*g*aghanyâ*h*), i.e. servants, slaves, and the like . . . . . The term
"men of low condition" is made a separate word in the text in order to
show that they come after the others.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[205:26](sbe0269.htm#fr_963) Manu III, 113.

<span id="fn_963"></span>[205:27](sbe0269.htm#fr_964) Âpastamba II, 4,
8, 5-9.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[205:30](sbe0269.htm#fr_965) 'And to a king a
Madhuparka must be offered on his arrival. If he is a *S*rotriya (this
must be done) on each visit.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[205:31](sbe0269.htm#fr_966) 'A king who is not
a *S*rotriya shall be honoured with a seat and water, not with a
Madhuparka.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[205:32](sbe0269.htm#fr_967) Âpastamba II, 3,
6, 7-10, 14-15. 'This Sûtra may be optionally taken as referring to a
Brâhma*n*a, because the word *S*rotriya is repeated. For a *S*rotriya
who has come as a guest, a foot-bath, i.e. water for washing the feet,
an Arghya, i.e. water mixed with Dûrvâ grass, flowers, &c., and food of
a superior quality, i.e. milk and rice; cakes and the like shall be
particularly prepared, if the host is able to afford it.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[206:33](sbe0269.htm#fr_968) 'But if (the host
is) not able (to afford dainties), he shall prepare that same food which
is daily used in his house, distinguished in the preparation, i.e. by
adding pepper and the like condiments, by frying it, and so
forth.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[206:34](sbe0269.htm#fr_969) Âpastamba II, 22,
4, 16; II, 3, 6, 12. Haradatta points out that in this case nothing but
a simple dinner shall be given.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[206:36](sbe0269.htm#fr_970) Âpastamba II, 2,
4, 14. ' On failure of grass and the rest, a welcome, i.e. (the host
shall say) "Thou art tired, sit down here."'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[206:37](sbe0269.htm#fr_971) Manu 111, 106-107.
'This Sûtra refers solely to such a guest, as is described below, Sûtra
40.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[206:38](sbe0269.htm#fr_972) 'Accompanying,
i.e. walking after him; respectfully attending to, i.e. sitting with him
and so forth. As it is not possible that these two acts can be performed
by the host in the same manner as for himself, the meaning of the Sûtra
must be taken to be merely that they are to be performed.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_972"></span>[206:39](sbe0269.htm#fr_973) Haradatta says
that some explain this Sûtra to mean, '(The host shall show the same
attention) even to a man who is a little inferior (to himself in
learning, &c.),' but that he disapproves of their opinion.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[207:40](sbe0269.htm#fr_974) Âpastamba II, 3,
6, 5. Haradatta states, that by 'the time when the sun's rays pass over
the trees,' either the middle of the day or the late afternoon may be
meant.

<span id="fn_974"></span>[207:41](sbe0269.htm#fr_975) Âpastamba I, 4,
14, 26-29.

<span id="fn_975"></span>[207:43](sbe0269.htm#fr_976) Âpastamba II, 2,
