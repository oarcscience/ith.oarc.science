### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 7, KHA*ND*A 17.

1\. (If) rhinoceros' meat (is given to Brâhma*n*as seated) on (seats
covered with) the skin of a rhinoceros, (the Manes are satisfied) for a
very long time. <span id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_690)

2\. (The same effect is obtained) by (offering the) flesh (of the fish
called) *S*atabali, <span id="fr_692"></span>[2](#fn_691)

3\. And by (offering the) meat of the (crane called) Vârdhrâ*n*asa.

4\. Pure, with composed mind and full of ardour, he shall feed
Brâhma*n*as who know the Vedas, and who are not connected with him by
marriage, blood relationship, by the relationship of sacrificial priest
and sacrificer, or by the relationship of (teacher and) pupil. <span
id="fr_693"></span>[4](#fn_692)

5\. If strangers are deficient in the (requisite) good qualities, even a
full brother who possesses them, may be fed (at a *S*râddha).

6\. (The admissibility of) pupils (and the rest) has been declared
hereby.

7\. Now they quote also (in regard to this matter the following verse):

8\. The food eaten (at a sacrifice) by persons related to the giver is,
indeed, a gift offered to the goblins. It reaches neither the Manes nor
the <span id="fr_694"></span>[8](#fn_693)

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

gods. Losing its power (to procure heaven), it errs about in this world
as a cow that has lost its calf runs into a strange stable.

9\. The meaning (of the verse) is, that gifts which are eaten (and
offered) mutually by relations, (and thus go) from one house to the
other, perish in this world.

10\. If the good qualities (of several persons who might be invited) are
equal, old men and (amongst these) poor ones, who wish to come, have the
preference.

11\. On the day before (the ceremony) the (first) invitation (must be
issued). <span id="fr_695"></span>[11](#fn_694)

12\. On the following day the second invitation takes place. <span
id="fr_696"></span>[12](#fn_695)

13\. (On the same day also takes place) the third invitation (which
consists in the call to dinner). <span id="fr_697"></span>[13](#fn_696)

14\. Some declare, that every act at a funeral sacrifice must be
repeated three times.

15\. As (the acts are performed) the first time, so they must be
repeated) the second and the third times.

16\. When all (the three oblations) have been <span
id="fr_698"></span>[16](#fn_697)

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

offered, he shall take a portion of the food of all (three), and shall
eat a small mouthful of the remainder in the manner described (in the
G*ri*hya-sûtra).

17\. But the custom of the Northerners is to pour into the hands of the
Brâhma*n*as, when they are seated on their seats, (water which has been
taken from the water-vessel.) <span id="fr_699"></span>[17](#fn_698)

18\. (At the time of the burnt-offering which is offered at the
beginning of the dinner) he addresses the Brâhma*n*as with this Mantra:
'Let it be taken out, and let it be offered in the fire.' <span
id="fr_700"></span>[18](#fn_699)

19\. (They shall give their permission with this Mantra): 'Let it be
taken out at thy pleasure, let it be offered in the fire at thy
pleasure.' Having received this permission, he shall take out (some of
the prepared food) and offer it.

20\. They blame it, if dogs and Apapâtras are allowed to see the
performance of a funeral-sacrifice.

21\. The following persons defile the company if they are invited to a
funeral-sacrifice, viz. a leper, a bald man, the violator of another
man's bed, the son of a Brâhma*n*a who follows the profession of a
Kshatriya, and the son of (a Brâhma*n*a who by marrying first a *S*ûdra
wife had himself become) a *S*ûdra, born from a Brâhma*n*a woman. <span
id="fr_701"></span>[21](#fn_700)

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

22\. The following persons sanctify the company if they eat at a
funeral-sacrifice, viz. one who has studied the three verses of the Veda
containing the word 'Madhu,' each three times; one who has studied the
part of the Veda containing the word 'Supar*n*a' three times; a
Tri*n*â*k*iketa; one who has studied the Mantras required for the four
sacrifices (called A*s*vamedha, Purushamedha, Sarvamedha, and
Pit*ri*medha); one who keeps five fires; one who knows the Sâman called
*G*yesh*th*a; one who fulfils the duty of daily study; the son of one
who has studied and is able to teach the whole Veda with its Aṅgas, and
a *S*rotriya. <span id="fr_702"></span>[22](#fn_701)

23\. He shall not perform (any part of) a funeral sacrifice at
night. <span id="fr_703"></span>[23](#fn_702)

24\. After having begun (a funeral-sacrifice), he shall not eat until he
has finished it. <span id="fr_704"></span>[24](#fn_703)

25\. (He shall not perform a funeral-sacrifice at <span
id="fr_705"></span>[25](#fn_704)

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

night), except if an eclipse of the moon takes place.

and 149, 188; Yâ*gñ*. I, 225.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[143:8](sbe0252.htm#fr_694) See Manu III, 141,
where this Trish*t*ubh has been turned into an Anush*t*ubh.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[144:11](sbe0252.htm#fr_695) Manu III, 187;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 225. According to Haradatta the formula of invitation is,
*S*va*h* *s*râddham bhavitâ, tatrâhavanîyârthe bhavadbhi*h* prasâde
kartavya iti, 'to-morrow a *S*râddha will take place. Do me the favour
to take at that the place of the Âhavanîya-fire.'

<span id="fn_695"></span>[144:12](sbe0252.htm#fr_696) The formula is,
Adya *s*râddham, 'to-day the *S*râddha takes place.'

<span id="fn_696"></span>[144:13](sbe0252.htm#fr_697) The call to dinner
is, Siddham âgamyatim, 'the food is ready; come.'

<span id="fn_697"></span>[144:16](sbe0252.htm#fr_698) Âpastamba
G*ri*hya-sûtra VIII, 2 1, 9. 'He shall eat it pronouncing the Mantra,
"Prâ*n*e nivish*t*osm*ri*ta*m* *g*uhomi."' Taitt. Âr. X, 34, 1.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[145:17](sbe0252.htm#fr_699) The North of India
begins to the north of the river Sarâvati. The rule alluded to is given
by Yâ*gñ*. I. 226, 229, Manu III, 2 10.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[145:18](sbe0252.htm#fr_700) Yâ*gñ*. I, 235.
20. Manu III. 239.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[145:21](sbe0252.htm#fr_701) Manu III, 152-166,
and particularly 153 and 154 Yâ*gñ*. I. 222-224. Haradatta's explanation
of the word '*S*ûdra' by 'a Brâhma*n*a who has become a *S*ûdra' is
probably not because the son of a real *S*ûdra and of a Brâhma*n*a
female is a Ka*nd*âla, and has been disposed of by the preceding Sûtra.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[146:22](sbe0252.htm#fr_702) Compare Manu III,
185, 186; Yâ*gñ*. I, 219-221. The three verses to be known by a Trimadhu
are, Madhu vâtâ *ri*tâyate, &c., which occur both in the Taitt. Sa*m*h.
and in the Taitt. Âr. The explanation of Trisupar*n*a is not certain.
Haradatta thinks that it may mean either a person who knows the three
verses *K*atushkapardâ yuvati*h* supe*s*â, &c., Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a I,
2, 1, 27, &c., or one who knows the three Anuvâkas from the Taittirîya
Âra*n*yaka X, 48-50, beginning, Brahmametu mâm, &c. The word
'Tri*n*â*k*iketa' has three explanations:--*a*. A person who knows the
Nâ*k*iketa-fire according to the Taittirîyaka, Ka*th*avallî, and the
*S*atapatha, i.e. has studied the portions on the Nâ*k*iketa-fire in
these three books. *b*. A person who has thrice kindled the
Nâ*k*iketa-fire. *c*. A person who has studied the Anuvâka, called
Vira*g*as. *K*aturmedha may also mean 'one who has performed the four
sacrifices' enumerated above.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[146:23](sbe0252.htm#fr_703) Manu III, 280.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[146:24](sbe0252.htm#fr_704) 'The *S*râddha is
stated to begin with the first invitation to the Brahmans.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[146:25](sbe0252.htm#fr_705) 'The Northerners
do not generally receive this Sûtra, and therefore former commentators
have not explained it.'--Haradatta.
