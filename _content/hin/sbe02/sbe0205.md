<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Pâvamânîs, beginning with 'If near or far,' the
Ya*g*ushpavitra, ('May the waters, the mothers purify us,' &c.) the
Sâmapavitra, ('With what help assists,' &c.), and the Âṅgirasapavitra

initiation is not remembered, are called 'burial-grounds.'

6\. Intercourse, dining, and intermarriage with them should be avoided.
For them, if they like, the (following) penance (is prescribed). (Such a
man) shall keep for twelve years the rules prescribed for a student who
is studying the three Vedas. Afterwards he may be initiated. Then he
shall bathe, reciting the Pâvamânîs and the other (texts mentioned
above, I, 1, 2, 2).

7\. Then he may be instructed in the duties of a householder.

8\. He shall not be taught (the whole Veda), but only the sacred
formulas required for the domestic ceremonies.

9\. When he has finished this (study of the G*ri*hya-mantras), he may be
initiated (after having performed the penance prescribed) for the first
neglect (I, 1, 1, 28).

10\. Afterwards (everything is performed) as in the case of a regular
initiation. <span id="fr_132"></span>[10](#fn_131)

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

He who has been initiated shall dwell as a religious student in the

14\. (Or) less by half (i.e. for twenty-four years),

15\. (Or) three quarters less (i.e. for twelve years),

16\. Twelve years (should be) the shortest time (for his residence with
his teacher). <span id="fr_135"></span>[16](#fn_134)

17\. A student who studies the sacred science shall not dwell with
anybody else (than his teacher). <span id="fr_136"></span>[17](#fn_135)

18\. Now (follow) the rules for the studentship.

19\. He shall obey his teacher, except (when ordered to commit) crimes
which cause loss of caste. <span id="fr_137"></span>[19](#fn_136)

20\. He shall do what is serviceable to his teacher, he shall not
contradict him. <span id="fr_138"></span>[20](#fn_137)

21\. He shall always occupy a couch or seat lower (than that of his
teacher). <span id="fr_139"></span>[21](#fn_138)

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

22\. He shall not eat food offered (at a sacrifice to the gods or the

24\. He shall not sleep in the day-time.

25\. He shall not use perfumes. <span id="fr_141"></span>[25](#fn_140)

like). <span id="fr_143"></span>[27](#fn_142)

28\. He shall not wash his body (with hot water for pleasure).

29\. But, if it is soiled by unclean things, he shall clean it (with
earth or water), in a place where he is not seen by a Guru. <span
id="fr_144"></span>[29](#fn_143)

30\. Let him not sport in the water whilst bathing; let him swim
(motionless) like a stick. <span id="fr_145"></span>[30](#fn_144)

31\. He shall wear all his hair tied in one braid. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[31](#fn_145)

without any reference to caste, that the staff of a student should be
made of the wood of a tree (that is fit to be used at the
sacrifice). <span id="fr_148"></span>[38](#fn_147)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_130"></span>[5:2](sbe0205.htm#fr_131) **2**. The seven
Pâvamânîs are seven verses which occur Rig veda IX, 67, 21-27.
Ya*g*ushpavitra = Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 2, 1, 1. The Sâmapavitra is found
Sâma-veda I, 2, 2, 3, 5. Âṅgirasapavitra = *Rig*-veda IV, 40, 5.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[6:10](sbe0205.htm#fr_132) The commentator
observes that for those whose great-great-grandfather or remoter
ancestors were not initiated, no penance is prescribed, and that it must
be fixed by those who know the law.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[7:11](sbe0205.htm#fr_133) Manu II, 164.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[7:12](sbe0205.htm#fr_134) Manu III, 1, and
Yâ*gñ*. I, 36; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 125.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[7:16](sbe0205.htm#fr_135) The commentator
declares that in Manu III, 1, the expression until he has learnt it,'
must be understood in this sense, that the pupil may leave his teacher,
if he has learnt the Veda, after twelve years' study, never before. But
compare also Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû. I, 22, 3.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[7:17](sbe0205.htm#fr_136) The commentator
states that this rule refers only to a temporary, not to a professed
student (naish*th*ika). He also gives an entirely different explanation
to the Sûtra, which, according to some, means, 'A student who learns the
sacred science shall not fast in order to obtain heaven.' This rendering
also is admissible, as the word para may mean either a 'stranger' or
'heaven' and upavâsa, 'dwelling' or 'fasting.'

<span id="fn_136"></span>[7:19](sbe0205.htm#fr_137) Regarding the crimes
which cause loss of caste (patanîya), see below, I, 7, 21, 7.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[7:20](sbe0205.htm#fr_138) Manu II, 108, and
Yâ*gñ*. I, 27.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[7:21](sbe0205.htm#fr_139) Manu II, 108, 198;
Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 123 and 124.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[8:23](sbe0205.htm#fr_140) Regarding the
meaning of kshâra, 'pungent condiments,' see Haradatta on II, 6, 15, 15.
Other commentators explain the term differently.--Manu II, 177; Yâ*gñ*.
I, 33; and Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 123. Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû. I, 22, 2.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[8:25](sbe0205.htm#fr_141) Manu II, 177;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 33.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[8:26](sbe0205.htm#fr_142) Manu II, 180.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[8:27](sbe0205.htm#fr_143) Manu II, 178;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 33.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[8:29](sbe0205.htm#fr_144) 'Here, in the
section on the teacher, the word guru designates the father and the rest
also.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[8:30](sbe0205.htm#fr_145) Another version of
the first portion of this Sûtra, proposed by Haradatta, is, 'Let him
not, whilst bathing, clean himself (with bathing powder or the like).'
Another commentator takes Sûtra 28 as a prohibition of the daily bath or
washing generally ordained for Brâhma*n*as, and refers Sûtra 29. to the
naimittika snâna or 'bathing on certain occasions,' and takes Sûtra 30
as a restriction of the latter.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[8:31](sbe0205.htm#fr_146) Manu II, 2 19.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[9:33](sbe0205.htm#fr_147) Manu II, 42-44;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 29; Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû. I, 19, 12; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 23.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[9:38](sbe0205.htm#fr_148) Manu II, 45; Yâ*gñ*.
I, 29; Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû. I, 19, 13; 20, 1; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 23.

Haradatta gives no commentary on this Sûtra, but refers back to the
G*ri*hya-sûtra, II, 16-17, where the same words occur.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[9:39](sbe0205.htm#fr_149) The word forms a
Sûtra by itself, in order to show that every one must wear this cloth.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[9:40](sbe0205.htm#fr_150) Manu II, 41. 'Clean'
means here and everywhere else, if applied to animals or things,' fit to
be used at the sacrifice.'

<span id="fn_150"></span>[9:41](sbe0205.htm#fr_151) Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû. I,
19, 11; Weber, Ind. Stud X, 22.
