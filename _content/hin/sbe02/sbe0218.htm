<P><A NAME="fn_341"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_342">54:1</A> <b>15</b>. Taitt. &Acirc;r. II, 1, 2 seq.; Manu IV, 58.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_342"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_343">54:2</A> Pure water is that which a cow will drink. Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 192; Manu V, 128.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_343"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_344">54:3</A> The ceremony of 'sipping water' may be performed in two ways; either the 'person sipping' may take the water out of a river, pond, &amp;c., or he may get the water poured into his hand by another person. But, according to &Acirc;pastamba, he must not take a pot or gourd in his left hand and pour the water into his right, as some Sm<I>ri</I>tis allow. The reason for this rule is, that &Acirc;pastamba considers it essential that both hands should be used in conveying the water to the mouth; see also above, I, 1, 4, 21. This agrees with the custom now followed, which is to bend the right hand into the form of a cow's ear, and to touch the right wrist with the left hand while drinking.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_344"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_345">55:4</A> 'Some think, that this S&ucirc;tra is intended to forbid also the drinking of rain-water. Other commentators declare that, according to this S&ucirc;tra, it is allowed to use for "sipping" drops of water which fall from a vessel suspended by ropes [because the S&ucirc;tra emphatically excludes "rain-drops only].'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_345"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_346">55:6</A> Manu II, 61. 'Because the term "heated by fire" is used, there is no objection to water heated by the rays of the sun. In the same manner the use of, "hot" water only is usually forbidden in the Sm<I>ri</I>tis.'-- Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_346"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_347">55:7</A> 'Because the phrase "with empty hands" is used, he commits no fault if he raises his hand, holding a stick or a clod. Some declare, that the term "touching water" (rendered by "washing means "sipping water."'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_347"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_348">55:11</A> The translation given above is based on the interpretation of Haradatta, who considers that &Acirc;pastamba holds 'crossing a river' to cause impurity. The natural and probably the right interpretation, however, is that rejected by Haradatta, 'But he shall sip water after having come out (of the river or tank).'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_348"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_349">55:12</A> '"On the fire used for Vedic or Sm&acirc;rta sacrifices or for household purposes.". . . Some declare, that (the fuel need not be sprinkled with water) if used for the kitchen fire.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_349"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_350">56:14</A> Haradatta's commentary is of little use, and I am not quite certain that my translation is correct.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_350"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_351">56:15</A> Manu V, 118.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_351"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_352">56:17</A> This second proceeding is adopted in case the dog has touched the hands or the lower parts of the body, as may be learnt by the comparison of a verse of Manu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_352"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_353">56:18</A> Manu IV, 142; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 155.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_353"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_354">56:20</A> Manu IV, 53. Haradatta mentions other explanations of this S&ucirc;tra. Some say, that the <I>S</I>rauta fire may be kindled by blowing, because that is ordained particularly in the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyaka, but that the domestic fire is not to be treated so. Others again consider the rule absolute, and say, that a hollow reed or bellows must be used for kindling the fire, lest drops of saliva should fall upon it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_354"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_355">56:21</A> Manu IV, 54.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_355"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_356">57:22</A> The last condition mentioned in the S&ucirc;tra indicates, that the place must have a river or tank, not wells only, as the purification by sipping water cannot be performed without help, with water from wells.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_356"></A><A HREF="sbe0218.htm#fr_357">57:23</A> Manu V, 138.</P>
