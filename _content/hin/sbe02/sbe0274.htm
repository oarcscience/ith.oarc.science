Haradatta says that some believe the term 'twice-born' to have been used in order to indicate that the three occupations may be lawfully followed after the second birth, i.e. the initiation only. But he declares that alms may be given even by an uninitiated &Acirc;ryan, while studying the Veda and sacrificing are specially forbidden to him.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1088"></A><A HREF="sbe0274.htm#fr_1089">227:2</A> &Acirc;pastamba II, 5, 10, 4.</P>

If he neglects them, he commits sin; if he follows them, he will be exalted. But the other occupations, teaching, &amp;c., shall be followed if there is occasion for them. No sin is committed by neglecting them, nor any greatness gained by following them. They are merely means of livelihood.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1090"></A><A HREF="sbe0274.htm#fr_1091">227:4</A> &Acirc;pastamba I, 4, 13, 15-18. The expression 'above-mentioned' refers to the whole of the rules regarding a pupil's conduct given above, I, 52-II, 51. It is difficult to understand what is intended by 'the exchange of the Veda for wealth or money,' if it is not the bh<I>ri</I>tak&acirc;dhy&acirc;pana or teaching for money which Manu III, 156 blames so severely. It seems to me unlikely that Gautama means simply to sanction this practice. It is more probable that his rule refers to the case of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as in distress, who avail themselves of the permission given above, VII, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1091"></A><A HREF="sbe0274.htm#fr_1092">228:5</A>-6. These rules which allow Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as to be gentlemen farmers and sleeping partners in mercantile or banking firms, managed by Vai<I>s</I>yas, do not occur in other Sm<I>ri</I>tis. But they agree with the practice followed at present in many parts of India, and the praise bestowed in Vedic works on those who present land to Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as as well as the numerous ancient land grants show that from early times many Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as were holders of land, which, as a rule, was cultivated by <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1094"></A><A HREF="sbe0274.htm#fr_1095">228:11</A> Haradatta takes this S&ucirc;tra differently. He says: 'The immunity from taxes which has been granted to Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and others by former kings he shall maintain in the same manner as formerly! But I think that 'akara' must be taken as a Bahuvr&icirc;hi compound, and is used to designate widows, orphans, ascetics, &amp;c.; see &Acirc;pastamba II, 10, 26, 10-7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1095"></A><A HREF="sbe0274.htm#fr_1096">228:12</A> Haradatta observes that others explain upakurv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, 'temporary students,' opposed to naish<I>th</I>ika, 'permanent students,' to mean 'men who benefit the people,' i.e. physicians and the like.</P>

He says, 'Adhika, "additional," means the money which is paid on account of (the additional occupations) which have been explained above (S&ucirc;tra 7 seq.) "To protect all created beings," &amp;c. Thereon shall he live, he himself, his servants, his elephants, horses, and his other (animals).' If this explanation is adopted, the S&ucirc;tra ought to be translated thus, 'He shall live on (the taxes paid for his) additional (occupations).' It seems, however, more probable that Gautama means to say that the king shall live on the surplus which remains after providing for the external and internal security of the kingdom, and that his object is to forbid the application of the whole revenue to the personal expenses of the ruler.</P>

Between this S&ucirc;tra and the next, my MSS. insert an additional one, not found in Professor Stenzler's edition, <I>S</I>&ucirc;drasy&acirc;pi nishekapu<I>m</I>savanas&icirc;mantonnayana<I>g</I>&acirc;takarman&acirc;makara<I>n</I>opanishkrama<I>n</I>&acirc;nnapr&acirc;<I>s</I>ana<I>k</I>aul&acirc;nyamantrak&acirc;<I>n</I>i yath&acirc;k&acirc;lam upadish<I>t</I>&acirc;n&icirc;<I>t</I>i, 'for the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra also the Nisheka (or impregnation), the Pu<I>m</I>savana (or rite for securing male offspring), the S&icirc;mantonnayana (or arranging the parting of a pregnant wife), the <I>G</I>&acirc;takarman (or ceremony on the birth of the child), the name-giving, the first walk in the open air, the first feeding, and the <I>K</I>aula (or tonsure of the child's head) are prescribed to be performed at the proper periods, but without the recitation of sacred texts.' But I am inclined to consider it spurious: first, because there is no proper commentary; secondly, because the enumeration of the Sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ras given here does not agree with <A NAME="page_233"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 233</FONT></A> that given above, VIII, 14; and thirdly, because, according to the practice of Gautama, this S&ucirc;tra should begin with 'tasy&acirc;pi' instead of with 'S&ucirc;drasy&acirc;pi,' and the 'tasy&acirc;pi' in the next would become superfluous. The rule agrees however with Manu X, 63, 127.</P>
