### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[255:1](sbe0279.htm#fr_1238) **XV**. 'The word
"now" indicates that a new topic begins.'--Haradatta. The rules now
following refer in the first instance to the Pârva*n*a or monthly
*S*râddha, but most of them serve also as general rules for all the
numerous varieties of funeral sacrifices.

<span id="fn_1238"></span>[255:2](sbe0279.htm#fr_1239) Manu III, 122;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 217.

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[255:3](sbe0279.htm#fr_1240) Âpastamba II, 7,
16, 6.

<span id="fn_1240"></span>[255:4](sbe0279.htm#fr_1241) Âpastamba II, 7,
16, 6-2 2.

<span id="fn_1241"></span>[255:5](sbe0279.htm#fr_1242) Some of the most
famous among the places where the performance of a *S*râddha is
particularly efficacious and meritorious are Gayâ in Bihâr, Pushkara or
Pokhar near Agmîr, the Kurukshetra near Dehli, Nâsika on the Godâvarî.
Pilgrims or persons passing through such places may and must perform a
*S*râddha on any day of the month.

<span id="fn_1242"></span>[255:7](sbe0279.htm#fr_1243) Yâ*gñ*avalkya I,
227.

<span id="fn_1243"></span>[255:8](sbe0279.htm#fr_1244) See also below,
Sûtra 21.

<span id="fn_1244"></span>[255:9](sbe0279.htm#fr_1245) Âpastamba II, 7,
17, 4. Haradatta explains vâk, 'eloquence,' by 'ability to speak
Sanskrit,' rûpa, 'beauty,' by 'the proper number of limbs,' and
vaya*h*sampanna, 'of (suitable) age,' by 'not too young.'

<span id="fn_1245"></span>[256:11](sbe0279.htm#fr_1246) I.e. in honour
of the father a young man is to be invited, in honour of the grandfather
an old man, and in honour of the great-grandfather a very old man.

<span id="fn_1246"></span>[256:12](sbe0279.htm#fr_1247) Âpastamba II. 7,
17, 4, 8; Manu III, 140.

<span id="fn_1247"></span>[256:15](sbe0279.htm#fr_1248) Âpastamba II, 7,
16, 23-11, 7, 17, 3; 11, 8, 18, 13.

<span id="fn_1248"></span>[256:16](sbe0279.htm#fr_1249) Âpastamba II, 7,
17, 21. 'A destroyer of the sacred fire (vîrahan), i.e. one who
extinguishes intentionally the (domestic) fire <span id="page_257">p.
257</span> out of hatred against his wife, and for the like
reasons.'--Haradatta. He also remarks that some read agredidhishu
instead of agredidhishû, and he proposes to explain the former, on the
authority of Vyâghra and of the Naigha*nt*ukas, as 'a Brâhma*n*a whose
wife has been wedded before to another man.'

<span id="fn_1249"></span>[257:17](sbe0279.htm#fr_1250) My MSS. make two
Sûtras out of Professor Stenzler's one, and read upapati*h* \| yasya
*k*a sa*h*. The sense remains the same, but the latter version of the
text is, I think, the correct one.

<span id="fn_1250"></span>[257:18](sbe0279.htm#fr_1251) Haradatta says
that ku*nd*âsin may also mean 'he who eats out of a vessel called
ku*nd*a,' as the people have in some countries the habit of preparing
their food and afterwards eating out of the ku*nd*a. Haradatta explains
tyaktâtman, 'one who despairs of himself,' by 'one who has made an
attempt on his own life, and has tried to hang himself, and the like.'
He remarks that some explain durvâla, 'a bald man,' by
nirvesh*t*ita*s*epha. He who neglects the recitation of the sacred
texts, i.e. of those texts which, like the Gâyatrî, ought to be recited.

<span id="fn_1251"></span>[258:19](sbe0279.htm#fr_1252) Below, XXVIII,
2, it will be prescribed that the division of the family estate may take
place during the lifetime of the father with his consent. From this
Sûtra it would appear that sons could enforce a division of the
ancestral estate against his will, as Yâ*gñ*avalkya also allows (see
Colebrooke, Mitâksharâ I, 6, 5-11), and that this practice, though
legal, was held to be contra bonos mores.

<span id="fn_1252"></span>[258:20](sbe0279.htm#fr_1253) Âpastamba II, 7,
17, 5-6.

<span id="fn_1253"></span>[258:21](sbe0279.htm#fr_1254) According to
Haradatta, this Sûtra is intended as a modification of Sûtra 8.

<span id="fn_1254"></span>[258:22](sbe0279.htm#fr_1255) Manu III, 250.
23. Manu III, 188.

<span id="fn_1255"></span>[259:24](sbe0279.htm#fr_1256) Âpastamba II, 7,
17, 20.

<span id="fn_1256"></span>[259:28](sbe0279.htm#fr_1257) Âpastamba II, 7,
17, 22.

<span id="fn_1257"></span>[259:29](sbe0279.htm#fr_1258)-30. Manu III,
132-137, 148-149.
