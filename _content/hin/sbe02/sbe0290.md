Sâmavidhâna I, 2, 1; Âpastamba I, 9, 27, 7. Haradatta states that
ata*h*, 'therefore,' means 'because the K*rikkh*ras cannot be performed
if they have not been described,' while Sâya*n*a, on the Sâmavidhâna,
asserts that it means 'because unpurified persons who are unable to
offer sacrifices cannot gain heavenly bliss without performing
austerities such as K*rikkh*ras.' It is a remarkable fact that Haradatta
does not seem to have been aware that the twenty-sixth chapter of
Gautama is taken bodily from the Sâmavidhâna.

pungent condiments.'

the Sâmans and Mantras, see notes to Burnell's edition of the
Sâmavidhâna, and above, XXV, 7. Haradatta remarks that in the Taitt.
Sa*m*h. (V, 6, 1) the Mantras beginning ' The golden-coloured' are ten
in number, and adds that 'if in some other *S*âkhâ eight are found,
those must be taken.'

<span id="fn_1463"></span>[297:12](sbe0290.htm#fr_1464) Sâmavidhâna I,
2, 5, where, however, only four Mantras are given instead of our
thirteen. The epithets given to the deity in the Sâmavidhâna can all be
referred to the Sun, provided he is identified with the universal soul,
while in the above Sûtra, Rudra and Indra have been introduced. It
cannot be doubtful that the Sâmavidhâna gives an older and more
authentic form of the prayer. My translation of the epithets, which are
found in the Sâmavidhâna also, follows Sâya*n*a's gloss. Haradatta does
not explain them. About Sobhya in the twelfth Mantra, which possibly
might mean, 'he who dwells in a mirage, i.e. the Sa*m*sâra,' I feel
doubtful. My MSS. read somya, and the Sâmavidhâna has saumya in the
second Mantra. But I am unwilling to alter the word, as Professor
Stenzler's reading may have been derived from a South-Indian MS., where
bhya and mya do not resemble each other so, much as in the Devanâgarî
characters.

has bathed after completing the study of all the four Vedas.
