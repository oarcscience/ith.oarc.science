### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 3, KHA*ND*A 7.

1\. This reception of guests is an everlasting (*S*rauta)-sacrifice
offered by the householder to Pra*g*âpati. <span
id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_592)

2\. The fire in the stomach of the guest (represents) the Âhavanîya,
(the sacred fire) in the house of the host represents the Gârhapatya,
the fire at which the food for the guest is cooked (represents) the fire
used for cooking the sacrificial viands (the Dakshi*n*âgni). <span
id="fr_594"></span>[2](#fn_593)

3\. He who eats before his guest consumes the food, the prosperity, the
issue, the cattle, the merit which his family acquired by sacrifices and
charitable works.

4\. Food (offered to guests) which is mixed with milk procures the
reward of an Agnish*t*oma-sacrifice. Food mixed with clarified butter
procures the reward of an Ukthya, food mixed with honey the reward of an
Atirâtra, food accompanied by meat the reward of a Dvâda*s*âha, (food
and) water numerous offspring and long life. <span
id="fr_595"></span>[4](#fn_594)

5\. It is declared in the Veda, 'Both welcome and indifferent guests
procure heaven (for their host).'

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

6\. When he gives food in the morning, at noon, and in the evening,
(these gifts) are the Savanas (of that sacrifice offered to
Pra*g*âpati). <span id="fr_596"></span>[6](#fn_595)

7\. When he rises after his guest has risen (to depart), that act
represents the Udavasânîyâ ish*t*i (of a Vedic sacrifice). <span
id="fr_597"></span>[7](#fn_596)

8\. When he addresses (the guest) kindly, that kind address (represents)
the Dakshi*n*â. <span id="fr_598"></span>[8](#fn_597)

9\. When he follows (his departing guest, his steps represent) the steps
of Vishnu. <span id="fr_599"></span>[9](#fn_598)

10\. When he returns (after having accompanied his guest), that (act
represents) the Avabh*ri*tha, (the final bath performed after the
completion of a sacrifice.)

11\. Thus (a Brâhma*n*a shall treat) a Brâhma*n*a, (and a Kshatriya and
a Vai*s*ya their caste-fellows.)

12\. If a guest comes to a king, he shall make (his Purohita) honour him
more than himself. <span id="fr_600"></span>[12](#fn_599)

13\. If a guest comes to an Agnihotrin, he himself <span
id="fr_601"></span>[13](#fn_600)

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

shall go to meet him and say to him: 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows,
where didst thou stay (last night)?' (Then he offers water, saying): 'O
faithful fulfiller of thy vows, here is water.' (Next he offers milk or
the like, saying): 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may (these fluids)
refresh (thee).'

14\. (If the guest stays at the time of the Agnihotra, he shall make him
sit down to the north of the fire and) murmur in a low voice, before
offering the oblations: 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as
thy heart desires;' 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy
will is;' 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy wish is;'
'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy desire is.' <span
id="fr_602"></span>[14](#fn_601)

15\. If a guest comes, after the fires have been placed (on the altar),
but before the oblations have been offered, (the host) himself shall
approach him and say to him: 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows give me
permission; I wish to sacrifice.' Then he shall sacrifice, after having
received permission. A Brâhma*n*a declares that he commits a sin if he
sacrifices without permission. <span id="fr_603"></span>[15](#fn_602)

16\. He who entertains guests for one night obtains earthly happiness, a
second night gains the middle air, a third heavenly bliss, a fourth the
world of unsurpassable bliss; many nights procure endless worlds. That
has been declared in the Veda.

17\. If an unlearned person who pretends to be

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (worthy of the appellation) 'guest' comes to
him, he shall give him a seat, water, and food, (thinking) 'I give it to
a learned Brâhma*n*a.' Thus (the merit) of his (gift) becomes (as) great
(as if a learned Brâhma*n*a had received it).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_592"></span>[117:1](sbe0242.htm#fr_593) **7**.
'Prâ*g*âpatya may mean either "created by Pra*g*âpati" or sacred to
Pra*g*âpati."'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[117:2](sbe0242.htm#fr_594) in the first Sûtra
the reception of guests had been compared to an everlasting Vedic
sacrifice. This analog is traced further in detail in this Sûtra. One of
the chief characteristics of a Vedic sacrifice is the vitâna, or the use
of three sacred fires. Hence Âpastamba shows that three fires also are
used in offering hospitality to guests.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[117:4](sbe0242.htm#fr_595) Regarding the
Agnish*t*oma and the other sacrifices mentioned, see Aitareya-brâhma*n*a
III, 8; IV, 1; IV, 4.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[118:6](sbe0242.htm#fr_596) The morning,
midday, and evening offerings offered at the great Vedic sacrifices are
called Savanas. The object of this Sûtra is to prescribe the hospitable
reception of guests at a times of the day, and to further describe the
similarity of a guest-offering to a Vedic sacrifice.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[118:7](sbe0242.htm#fr_597) Regarding the
Udavasânîyâ ish*t*i, see Aitareya-brâhma*n*a VIII, 5. It is the
'concluding ish*t*i.'

<span id="fn_597"></span>[118:8](sbe0242.htm#fr_598) Dakshi*n*â is the
reward given to priests who officiate at a sacrifice.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[118:9](sbe0242.htm#fr_599) 'The steps of
Vishnu' are three steps which the sacrificer has to make between the
Vedi and the Âhavanîya-fire. See Pet. Diet. s. v.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[118:12](sbe0242.htm#fr_600) 'A guest,' i.e.
such a one as described above, II, 3, 6, 4 and 5.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[118:13](sbe0242.htm#fr_601) An Agnihotrin is a
Brâhma*n*a who offers certain daily burnt offerings called Agnihotra.
The translation of the last clause renders tarpayantu, the reading of
the Atharva-veda.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[119:14](sbe0242.htm#fr_602) According to some,
all these sentences must be pronounced; according to Haradatta, one
only, which may be selected optionally.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[119:15](sbe0242.htm#fr_603) Haradatta states
that the Brâhma*n*a mentioned in the text is the Âharva*n*a-brâhma*n*a.
See Atharva-veda. XV, 11-12.
