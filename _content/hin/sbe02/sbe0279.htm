<P><A NAME="fn_1241"></A><A HREF="sbe0279.htm#fr_1242">255:5</A> Some of the most famous among the places where the performance of a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha is particularly efficacious and meritorious are Gay&acirc; in Bih&acirc;r, Pushkara or Pokhar near Agm&icirc;r, the Kurukshetra near Dehli, N&acirc;sika on the God&acirc;var&icirc;. Pilgrims or persons passing through such places may and must perform a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha on any day of the month.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1248"></A><A HREF="sbe0279.htm#fr_1249">256:16</A> &Acirc;pastamba II, 7, 17, 21. 'A destroyer of the sacred fire (v&icirc;rahan), i.e. one who extinguishes intentionally the (domestic) fire <A NAME="page_257"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 257</FONT></A> out of hatred against his wife, and for the like reasons.'--Haradatta. He also remarks that some read agredidhishu instead of agredidhish&ucirc;, and he proposes to explain the former, on the authority of Vy&acirc;ghra and of the Naigha<I>n</I><I>t</I>ukas, as 'a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a whose wife has been wedded before to another man.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1249"></A><A HREF="sbe0279.htm#fr_1250">257:17</A> My MSS. make two S&ucirc;tras out of Professor Stenzler's one, and read upapati<I>h</I> | yasya <I>k</I>a sa<I>h</I>. The sense remains the same, but the latter version of the text is, I think, the correct one.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1250"></A><A HREF="sbe0279.htm#fr_1251">257:18</A> Haradatta says that ku<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;sin may also mean 'he who eats out of a vessel called ku<I>n</I><I>d</I>a,' as the people have in some countries the habit of preparing their food and afterwards eating out of the ku<I>n</I><I>d</I>a. Haradatta explains tyakt&acirc;tman, 'one who despairs of himself,' by 'one who has made an attempt on his own life, and has tried to hang himself, and the like.' He remarks that some explain durv&acirc;la, 'a bald man,' by nirvesh<I>t</I>ita<I>s</I>epha. He who neglects the recitation of the sacred texts, i.e. of those texts which, like the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, ought to be recited.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1251"></A><A HREF="sbe0279.htm#fr_1252">258:19</A> Below, XXVIII, 2, it will be prescribed that the division of the family estate may take place during the lifetime of the father with his consent. From this S&ucirc;tra it would appear that sons could enforce a division of the ancestral estate against his will, as Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya also allows (see Colebrooke, Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc; I, 6, 5-11), and that this practice, though legal, was held to be contra bonos mores.</P>
