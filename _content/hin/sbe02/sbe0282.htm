<P><A NAME="fn_1329"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1330">270:1</A> <b>XVIII</b>. Manu V, 155. This S&ucirc;tra refers in the first instance to the inability of wives to offer on their own account <I>S</I>rauta or G<I>ri</I>hya-sacrifices, or to perform vows and religious ceremonies prescribed in the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as, without the permission of their husbands. As the word str&icirc; means both wife and woman, its ulterior meaning is, that women in general are never independent; see Manu V, 148; IX, 3; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya 1, 85.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1330"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1331">270:2</A> &Acirc;pastamba II, 10, 27, 6; Manu IX, 102.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1331"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1332">270:3</A> Manu V, 166; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya I, 87.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1332"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1333">270:4</A> &Acirc;pastamba II, 10, 27, 2-3; Manu IX, 59-60; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya I, 68. Apati, 'she whose husband is dead,' means literally, 'she who has no husband.' But as the case of a woman whose husband has gone abroad, is discussed below, it follows that the former translation alone is admissible. It must, of course, be understood that the widow has no children.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1333"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1334">271:5</A> The Gurus are here the husband's relatives, under whose protection the widow lives.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1334"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1335">271:6</A> Regarding the term Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, see above, XIV, 13; a Sagotra is a relative bearing the same family name (laukika gotra) removed seven to thirteen degrees, or still further. A Sam&acirc;napravara is one who is descended from the same <I>Ri</I>shi (vaidika gotra).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1335"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1336">271:8</A> Colebrooke V, Digest 265. Haradatta explains atidvit&icirc;ya, 'not more than two (sons),' to mean 'not more than one son' (prathamam apatyam at&icirc;tya dvit&icirc;yam na <I>g</I>anayed iti). But see Manu IX, 61.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1336"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1337">271:9</A> &Acirc;pastamba II, 6, 13, 6-7.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1338"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1339">271:11</A> Manu IX, 145. Such a son is called Kshetra<I>g</I>a, see below, XXVIII, 32.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1341"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1342">272:15</A> Manu IX, 76. 'When the husband has disappeared, i.e. has gone to a foreign country, his wife, though childless, shall wait for six years. After (the lapse of) that (period) she may, if she desires it, produce a child (by cohabiting with a Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a), after having been authorised thereto by her Gurus. If the husband is heard of, i.e. that he dwells in such and such a country, she shall go to him.'--Haradatta. Kshapa<I>n</I>a, 'waiting,' is ambiguous, and may also mean being continent or emaciating herself.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1342"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1343">272:17</A> I.e. before she goes to live with a Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, or tries to follow her husband, in case his residence is known.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1343"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1344">272:20</A> Manu IX, 90-92; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya I, 64.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1346"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1347">273:24</A> Manu XI, 11, 13. Haradatta explains dharmatantra, 'a rite prescribed by the sacred law,' here, as well as S&ucirc;tra 32, by 'the means,' i.e. a sacrificial animal and the like required by one who is engaged in performing a sacred duty, i.e. a Pa<I>s</I>ubandha-sacrifice and the like.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1347"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1348">273:25</A> Manu XI, 12. 26-27. Manu XI, 14.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1348"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1349">273:28</A> Manu XI, 16; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya III, 43-</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1349"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1350">273:30</A> Manu XI, 7; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya III, 43-44.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1350"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1351">273:31</A> Manu XI, 21-22. Haradatta adds that a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who acts thus, must, of course, not be punished.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1351"></A><A HREF="sbe0282.htm#fr_1352">274:32</A> Haradatta refers this S&ucirc;tra to the case where 'a sacrificial animal or other requisites for a sacrifice are stolen from a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. It seems, however, more probable that it refers to the duty of the king to prevent, by all means in his power, a violation of the sacred duty to perform <I>S</I>rauta-sacrifices, and that it is intended to prescribe that he is to assist a man who is engaged in them and too poor to finish them.</P>
