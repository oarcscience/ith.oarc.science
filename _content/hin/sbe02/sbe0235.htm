<P><A NAME="fn_523"></A><A HREF="sbe0235.htm#fr_524">98:24</A> Haradatta tells the story to which the second half of the verse alludes, in the following manner: 'A certain <I>Ri</I>shi had two pupils, called Dharmaprahr&acirc;da and Kum&acirc;lana. Once they brought from the forest two great bundles of firewood and threw them negligently into their teacher's house, without looking. One of the bundles struck the teacher's little son so that he died. Then the teacher asked his two pupils, "Which of you two has killed him?" Both answered, "Not I, not I." Hereupon the teacher, being unable to (come to a decision in order to) send away, the sinner and to keep the innocent one, called Death, and asked him, "Which of the two has killed the boy?" Then Death, finding himself involved in a difficult law-question, began to weep, and <A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A> giving his decision, said, "Oh Dharmaprahr&acirc;da, not to Kum&acirc;lana (the dative has the sense of the genitive), this sin is none of Kum&acirc;lana's!" Instead of declaring, "Dharmaprahr&acirc;da, thou hast done this,' he said, "The other did not do it." Still from the circumstances of the case it appeared that the meaning of the answer was, "The other has done it." "This was the decision which he gave crying."'--The reading of the text rendered in the translation is, dharmaprahr&acirc;da na kum&acirc;lan&acirc;ya.</P>
