<p>1. The Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as become impure by the death (of a relative) during ten (days and) nights, except those who officiate as priests, who have performed the D&icirc;ksha<I>n</I>&icirc;yesh<I>t</I>i (or initiatory ceremony of a <I>S</I>rauta sacrifice), and those who are students.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1212"></A><A HREF="#fn_1211"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p>18. Or three days.</p>  
<p>19. And if he hears (of the death of a Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a) after (the lapse of) ten (days and nights, the impurity lasts for) one night together with the preceding and following days,</p>  
<p>20. Likewise when a relative who is not a Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, a relative by marriage, or a fellow-student (has died).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1222"></A><A HREF="#fn_1221"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>

<p>24. (The duration of the impurity) of a Vai<I>s</I>ya and of a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra (in the same case) has been declared (by S&ucirc;tras 3-5).</p>  
<p>25. Or (it shall last for these two) as many nights as there are seasons (in the year);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1226"></A><A HREF="#fn_1225"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>26. And (the same rule may be made applicable) to the two higher (castes).</p>  
<p>27. Or (the impurity lasts) three days.</p>  
<p>28. And if the teacher, his son or wife, a person for whom (a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a) sacrifices or a pupil (has been carried out, the duration of the impurity is) the same.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1227"></A><A HREF="#fn_1226"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A></p>

<p>29. And if a man of lower caste carries, out (the corpse of) one of higher caste, or a man of higher caste (carries out the body of) one of lower caste, (the duration of) the impurity in these (cases) is determined by (the caste of) the dead man.</p>  
<p>30. On touching an outcast, a Ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;la, a woman impure on account of her confinement, a woman in her courses, or a corpse, and on touching persons who have touched them, he shall purify himself by bathing dressed in his clothes,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1228"></A><A HREF="#fn_1227"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>31. Likewise if he has followed a corpse (that was being carried out),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1229"></A><A HREF="#fn_1228"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A></p>

<p>33. Some (declare), that (the limb) which (a dog) may touch (must be washed).</p>  
<p>34. The Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as shall offer (libations of) water for (a deceased relative) whose <I>K</I>aula-karman (or tonsure) has been performed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1231"></A><A HREF="#fn_1230"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A></p>  
<p>35. As well as for the wives and daughters of such (a person).</p>  
<p>36. Some (declare, that it must be done in the case) of married female relatives (also).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1232"></A><A HREF="#fn_1231"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A></p>

<p>38. They shall not clean (themselves);</p>

Regarding the meaning of the term Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, see below, S&ucirc;tra 13. This S&ucirc;tra refers, of course, to Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as only.</P>

The S&ucirc;tra may, however, also be translated 'the relatives of those who have been killed by a cow, or by a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, &amp;c.,' as the latter case, too, is mentioned by Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya III, 21. The word anvaksham, translated by 'immediately after burial,' is explained by Haradatta as follows: 'The corpse is seen, i.e. is visible, so Iona; the meaning is that they will be pure after having bathed at the end of the burial.'</P>

Haradatta states that the Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a relationship extends to four degrees in the case of the son of an appointed daughter (see below, XXVIII, 18), while it includes the relatives within six degrees in the case of a legitimate son of the body. In either case the term refers to Sagotra-sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, or Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as who bear the same family name only. The case of the Bhinnagotra-sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as will be discussed below, S&ucirc;tra 20.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1221"></A><A HREF="sbe0278.htm#fr_1222">251:20</A> Manu V, 81. Haradatta explains asapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, 'a kinsman who is not a Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a,' by Sam&acirc;nodaka, i.e. 'a kinsman bearing the same family name, but more than six degrees removed,' and yonisambandha, 'a relative by marriage,' by 'the maternal grandfather, a maternal aunt's sons, and their sons, &amp;c., the fathers of wives and the rest.' The latter term, for which 'a person related through a female' would be a more exact rendering than the one given above, includes, therefore, those persons who, according to the terminology of Manu and Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, are called Bhinnagotra-sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, B&acirc;ndhavas, or Bandhus (see Colebrooke, Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc; II, 53; II, 6). Gautama's terminology agrees in this respect with that of &Acirc;pastamba, see note on II, 5, 11, 16.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1222"></A><A HREF="sbe0278.htm#fr_1223">251:21</A> Haradatta explains sabrahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin by suh<I>ri</I>t, 'a friend.' But the term which elsewhere means 'a fellow-student' cannot have that sense in our S&ucirc;tra, as the fellow-student (sah&acirc;dhy&acirc;yin) has been mentioned already. The translation given above is supported by the manner in which it is used in the ancient landgrants, where expressions like bahv<I>ri</I><I>k</I>asabrahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin are of common occurrence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1223"></A><A HREF="sbe0278.htm#fr_1224">252:22</A> Manu V, 81.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1224"></A><A HREF="sbe0278.htm#fr_1225">252:23</A> 'The word upaspar<I>s</I>ana (literally touching) does not denote here simple touching. For below, S&ucirc;tra 30, bathing with the clothes on, will be prescribed for that, What does upaspar<I>s</I>ana then mean? It means carrying out a corpse. For that an impurity lasting ten days falls on the performer, provided that the carrying out be done for an object, i.e. with the intention of gaining a fee or the like, not for the sake of doing one's duty. The word impurity is here repeated in order to indicate that the impurity, here intended, differs from that described above. Hence the rules given below, S&ucirc;tra 37, which prescribe sleeping and sitting on the ground and so forth, do not apply. (The word impurity) indicates (here) merely that (the performer of the act) must not be touched, and has no right (to perform sacred ceremonies).'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1225"></A><A HREF="sbe0278.htm#fr_1226">252:25</A> Haradatta states that Gautama does not simply say 'six days,' because five seasons only are to be reckoned in the case of a Vai<I>s</I>ya, and six in the case of a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1226"></A><A HREF="sbe0278.htm#fr_1227">252:28</A> Haradatta asserts that m<I>ri</I>teshu, 'have died,' must be understood. But as both the preceding and the following S&ucirc;tras. refer to <A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A> the carrying out of corpses, it is impossible to agree with him. It seems to me that Gautama's rule means, that, if a man has carried out the corpse of a teacher, &amp;c., he becomes impure for ten, eleven, or twelve days, or for three days only. See also Manu V, 91, 103; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya III, 15.</P>
