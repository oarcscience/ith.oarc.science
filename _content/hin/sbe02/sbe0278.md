### CHAPTER XIV.

1\. The Sapi*nd*as become impure by the death (of a relative) during ten
(days and) nights, except those who officiate as priests, who have
performed the Dîksha*n*îyesh*t*i (or initiatory ceremony of a *S*rauta
sacrifice), and those who are students. <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[1](#fn_1211)

2\. (The impurity) of a Kshatriya lasts for eleven (days and)
nights, <span id="fr_1213"></span>[2](#fn_1212)

3, (That) of a Vai*s*ya twelve (days and) nights,

4\. (Or), according to some, half a month,

5\. (And that) of a *S*ûdra a whole month. <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[5](#fn_1213)

6\. If during (a period of impurity) another (death) happens, the
(relatives) shall be pure after (the lapse of) the remainder of that
(first period). <span id="fr_1215"></span>[6](#fn_1214)

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

7\. (But) if one night (only of the period of impurity) remains (and
another death happens, they shall become pure) after (the lapse of) two
(days and nights).

8\. (If the second death happens) on the morning (after the completion
of the period of impurity, they shall be purified) after three (days and
nights).

9\. (The relatives) of those who are slain for the sake of cows and
Brâhma*n*as (become pure) immediately after the burial, <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[9](#fn_1215)

10\. And (those of men destroyed) by the anger of the king, <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[10](#fn_1216)

11\. (Further, those of men killed) in battle,

12\. Likewise (those) of men who voluntarily (die) by starving
themselves to death, by weapons, fire, poison, or water, by hanging
themselves, or by jumping (from a precipice). <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[12](#fn_1217)

13\. Sapi*nd*a-relationship ceases with the fifth or the seventh
(ancestor). <span id="fr_1219"></span>[13](#fn_1218)

14\. (The rules regarding impurity caused by the <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[14](#fn_1219)

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

death of a relative apply) to the birth (of a child) also.

15\. (In) that (case the impurity falls) on the parents,

16\. Or on, the mother (alone).

17\. (The impurity) for a miscarriage (lasts for a number of days and)
nights equal to (the number of) months from conception, <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[17](#fn_1220)

18\. Or three days.

19\. And if he hears (of the death of a Sapi*nd*a) after (the lapse of)
ten (days and nights, the impurity lasts for) one night together with
the preceding and following days,

20\. Likewise when a relative who is not a Sapi*nd*a, a relative by
marriage, or a fellow-student (has died). <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[20](#fn_1221)

21\. For a man who studies the same recension of the Veda (the impurity
lasts) one day, <span id="fr_1223"></span>[21](#fn_1222)

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

22\. Likewise for a *S*rotriya who dwells in the same house. <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[22](#fn_1223)

23\. On touching (i.e. on carrying out) a corpse from an interested
motive, the impurity lasts for ten days. <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[23](#fn_1224)

24\. (The duration of the impurity) of a Vai*s*ya and of a *S*ûdra (in
the same case) has been declared (by Sûtras 3-5).

25\. Or (it shall last for these two) as many nights as there are
seasons (in the year); <span id="fr_1226"></span>[25](#fn_1225)

26\. And (the same rule may be made applicable) to the two higher
(castes).

27\. Or (the impurity lasts) three days.

28\. And if the teacher, his son or wife, a person for whom (a
Brâhma*n*a) sacrifices or a pupil (has been carried out, the duration of
the impurity is) the same. <span id="fr_1227"></span>[28](#fn_1226)

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

29\. And if a man of lower caste carries, out (the corpse of) one of
higher caste, or a man of higher caste (carries out the body of) one of
lower caste, (the duration of) the impurity in these (cases) is
determined by (the caste of) the dead man.

30\. On touching an outcast, a Ka*nd*âla, a woman impure on account of
her confinement, a woman in her courses, or a corpse, and on touching
persons who have touched them, he shall purify himself by bathing
dressed in his clothes, <span id="fr_1228"></span>[30](#fn_1227)

31\. Likewise if he has followed a corpse (that was being carried
out), <span id="fr_1229"></span>[31](#fn_1228)

32\. And (if he has come into contact) with a dog. <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[32](#fn_1229)

33\. Some (declare), that (the limb) which (a dog) may touch (must be
washed).

34\. The Sapi*nd*as shall offer (libations of) water for (a deceased
relative) whose *K*aula-karman (or tonsure) has been performed, <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[34](#fn_1230)

35\. As well as for the wives and daughters of such (a person).

36\. Some (declare, that it must be done in the case) of married female
relatives (also). <span id="fr_1232"></span>[36](#fn_1231)

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

37\. (During the period of impurity) all (the mourners) shall sleep and
sit on the ground and remain chaste. <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[37](#fn_1232)

38\. They shall not clean (themselves);

39\. Nor shall they eat meat until (the funeral oblation) has been
offered. <span id="fr_1234"></span>[39](#fn_1233)

40\. On the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth (days after the
death) water (mixed with sesamum) must be offered.

41\. And the garments (worn during that ceremony) must be changed,

42\. But on the last (day they must be given) to men of the lowest
castes.

43\. The parents (shall offer water for a son who dies) after he has
teethed.

44\. If infants, (relatives) who live in a distant country, those who
have renounced domestic life, and those who are not Sapi*nd*as, (die),
the purification is instantaneous. <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[44](#fn_1234)

45\. Kings (remain always pure), lest their business be impeded, <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[45](#fn_1235)

46\. And a Brâhma*n*a, lest his daily study of the Veda be
interrupted. <span id="fr_1237"></span>[46](#fn_1236)

59, 83, 93; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 18, 28; see also Âpastamba I, 5, 16, 18.
Regarding the meaning of the term Sapi*nd*a, see below, Sûtra 13. This
Sûtra refers, of course, to Brâhma*n*as only.

<span id="fn_1215"></span>[250:9](sbe0278.htm#fr_1216) Yâ*gñ*avalkya
III, 27. The Sûtra may, however, also be translated 'the relatives of
those who have been killed by a cow, or by a Brâhma*n*a, &c.,' as the
latter case, too, is mentioned by Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 21. The word
anvaksham, translated by 'immediately after burial,' is explained by
Haradatta as follows: 'The corpse is seen, i.e. is visible, so Iona; the
meaning is that they will be pure after having bathed at the end of the
burial.'

<span id="fn_1216"></span>[250:10](sbe0278.htm#fr_1217) Yâ*gñ*avalkya
III, 21.

<span id="fn_1217"></span>[250:12](sbe0278.htm#fr_1218) Manu V, 89;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 21.

<span id="fn_1218"></span>[250:13](sbe0278.htm#fr_1219) Âpastamba II, 6,
15, 2. Haradatta states that the Sapi*nd*a relationship extends to four
degrees in the case of the son of an appointed daughter (see below,
XXVIII, 18), while it includes the relatives within six degrees in the
case of a legitimate son of the body. In either case the term refers to
Sagotra-sapi*nd*as, or Sapi*nd*as who bear the same family name only.
The case of the Bhinnagotra-sapi*nd*as will be discussed below, Sûtra
20.

<span id="fn_1219"></span>[250:14](sbe0278.htm#fr_1220)-16. Manu V, 62;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 18-19.

<span id="fn_1220"></span>[251:17](sbe0278.htm#fr_1221) Manu V, 66;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 20. 19. Manu V, 75-77.

<span id="fn_1221"></span>[251:20](sbe0278.htm#fr_1222) Manu V, 81.
Haradatta explains asapi*nd*a, 'a kinsman who is not a Sapi*nd*a,' by
Samânodaka, i.e. 'a kinsman bearing the same family name, but more than
six degrees removed,' and yonisambandha, 'a relative by marriage,' by
'the maternal grandfather, a maternal aunt's sons, and their sons, &c.,
the fathers of wives and the rest.' The latter term, for which 'a person
related through a female' would be a more exact rendering than the one
given above, includes, therefore, those persons who, according to the
terminology of Manu and Yâ*gñ*avalkya, are called
Bhinnagotra-sapi*nd*as, Bândhavas, or Bandhus (see Colebrooke,
Mitâksharâ II, 53; II, 6). Gautama's terminology agrees in this respect
with that of Âpastamba, see note on II, 5, 11, 16.

<span id="fn_1222"></span>[251:21](sbe0278.htm#fr_1223) Haradatta
explains sabrahma*k*ârin by suh*ri*t, 'a friend.' But the term which
elsewhere means 'a fellow-student' cannot have that sense in our Sûtra,
as the fellow-student (sahâdhyâyin) has been mentioned already. The
translation given above is supported by the manner in which it is used
in the ancient landgrants, where expressions like
bahv*rik*asabrahma*k*ârin are of common occurrence.

<span id="fn_1223"></span>[252:22](sbe0278.htm#fr_1224) Manu V, 81.

<span id="fn_1224"></span>[252:23](sbe0278.htm#fr_1225) 'The word
upaspar*s*ana (literally touching) does not denote here simple touching.
For below, Sûtra 30, bathing with the clothes on, will be prescribed for
that, What does upaspar*s*ana then mean? It means carrying out a corpse.
For that an impurity lasting ten days falls on the performer, provided
that the carrying out be done for an object, i.e. with the intention of
gaining a fee or the like, not for the sake of doing one's duty. The
word impurity is here repeated in order to indicate that the impurity,
here intended, differs from that described above. Hence the rules given
below, Sûtra 37, which prescribe sleeping and sitting on the ground and
so forth, do not apply. (The word impurity) indicates (here) merely that
(the performer of the act) must not be touched, and has no right (to
perform sacred ceremonies).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1225"></span>[252:25](sbe0278.htm#fr_1226) Haradatta states
that Gautama does not simply say 'six days,' because five seasons only
are to be reckoned in the case of a Vai*s*ya, and six in the case of a
*S*ûdra.

<span id="fn_1226"></span>[252:28](sbe0278.htm#fr_1227) Haradatta
asserts that m*ri*teshu, 'have died,' must be understood. But as both
the preceding and the following Sûtras. refer to <span id="page_253">p.
253</span> the carrying out of corpses, it is impossible to agree with
him. It seems to me that Gautama's rule means, that, if a man has
carried out the corpse of a teacher, &c., he becomes impure for ten,
eleven, or twelve days, or for three days only. See also Manu V, 91,
103; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 15.

<span id="fn_1227"></span>[253:30](sbe0278.htm#fr_1228) Âpastamba II, 2,
2, 8-9; Manu V, 85; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 30.

<span id="fn_1230"></span>[253:34](sbe0278.htm#fr_1231) Âpastamba II, 6,
15, 9; Manu V, 70. Haradatta observes that most G*ri*hya-sûtras
prescribe the performance of the *K*aula-karman in the third year,

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[254:44](sbe0278.htm#fr_1235) Yâ*gñ*avalkya
III, 23, Haradatta remarks that the rule refers to those Sapi*nd*as
residing in foreign countries only, of whose death one may hear a year
after their decease, and to remoter relations of whose death one hears
after the lapse of ten days; see Manu V, 75-76.

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[254:45](sbe0278.htm#fr_1236) Manu V, 93-94;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 27. Haradatta add: that the plural 'kings' is used in
order to include all rulers and governors, and such persons as the king
wishes to be pure.
