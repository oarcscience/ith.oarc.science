### Footnotes

<span id="fn_374"></span>[61:1](sbe0220.htm#fr_375) **17**. 'Some say,
that this Sûtra indicates that the touch of a *S*ûdra does not defile at
any other time but at dinner, whilst others hold that a *S*ûdra's touch
defiles always, and that the Sûtra is intended to indicate an excess of
impurity, if it happens at dinnertime.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[61:2](sbe0220.htm#fr_376) 'Unworthy people are
those who are neither of good family, nor possess learning and
virtue.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[61:3](sbe0220.htm#fr_377) According to
Haradatta a person who misbehaves thus, is called 'a dinner-thorn.' This
point of etiquette is strictly observed in our days also. Manu IV, 2 12.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[61:4](sbe0220.htm#fr_378) Manu IV, 212;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 167.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[62:5](sbe0220.htm#fr_379) 'As the text has
avaghrâta, "smelt at," it does not matter if they smell the food from a
distance.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[62:11](sbe0220.htm#fr_380) 'It must be
understood from other Sm*ri*tis, that brass is to be cleaned with ashes,
copper with acids, silver with cowdung, and gold with
water.'--Haradatta. Manu V, I 14.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[62:12](sbe0220.htm#fr_381) Manu V, 115.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[62:16](sbe0220.htm#fr_382) 'Having sprinkled
them with water and purified them by boiling; or, according to others,
mixing them with so much water as will not spoil them.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[62:17](sbe0220.htm#fr_383) The Sanskrit has
two terms for 'eating;' the first 'khâd' <span id="page_63">p. 63</span>
applies to hard substances, the second 'ad' to soft substances. Manu I,
V, 211; Yâ*gñ*. I, 16 7.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[63:18](sbe0220.htm#fr_384) Manu IV, 211; V, 9;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 167.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[63:19](sbe0220.htm#fr_385) Manu V, 10, 24 and
25.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[63:20](sbe0220.htm#fr_386) According to
Haradatta, Âpastamba returns once more to the question about sour food,
in order to teach that dishes prepared with curds and other sour
substances may be eaten.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[63:22](sbe0220.htm#fr_387) Manu V, 8; Yâ*gñ*.
I, 170.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[63:23](sbe0220.htm#fr_388) Manu V, 8, 9;
Yâ*gñ*. I 170. 'Sandhinî, translated by "females that give milk while
big with young," means, according to others, "female animals that give
milk once a day."--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[63:24](sbe0220.htm#fr_389) Manu V, 8.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[63:26](sbe0220.htm#fr_390) Manu V, 5; Yâ*gñ*.
I, 176.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[64:27](sbe0220.htm#fr_391) Haradatta observes
that Âpastamba, finding the list of forbidden vegetables too long,
refers his pupils to the advice of the *S*ish*t*as. The force of this
Sûtra is exactly the same as that of I, 3, 11, 38.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[64:28](sbe0220.htm#fr_392) Yâ*gñ*. I, 171.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[64:29](sbe0220.htm#fr_393) The camel, Gayal,
and *S*arabha are mentioned as 'forbidden animals,' *S*atapatha-br. I,
2, 1, 8; Aitareya-br. II, 1, 8; see also Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 62; Manu
V, 11, 18; Yâ*gñ*. I, 172, 176.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[64:32](sbe0220.htm#fr_394) Yâ*gñ*. I, 176.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[64:33](sbe0220.htm#fr_395) Manu V, 12. Yâ*gñ*.
I, 172.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[64:34](sbe0220.htm#fr_396) Manu V, 11; Yâ*gñ*.
I, 172.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[64:35](sbe0220.htm#fr_397) Yâ*gñ*. I, 172.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[64:36](sbe0220.htm#fr_398) Manu V, 12; Yâ*gñ*.
I, 172. Other commentators take the whole Sûtra as one compound, and
explain it as an exception to Sûtra 34. In that case the translation
runs thus: ('Carnivorous birds are forbidden) except the Kru*ñk*a,
Krau*ñk*a, Vârdhrâ*n*asa, <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> and
Lakshma*n*a.'--Haradatta. This translation is objectionable, because
both the Kru*ñk*a, now called Kulam or Kû*ñk*, and the Krau*ñk*a, the
red-crested crane, now called Sâras (Cyrus), feed on grain.
Kru*ñk*akrau*ñk*a is a Vedic dual and stands for kru*ñk*akrau*ñk*â or
kru*ñk*akrau*ñk*au.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[65:37](sbe0220.htm#fr_399) Manu V, 18; Yâ*gñ*.
I, 77. Pûtikhasha is, according to Haradatta, an animal resembling a
hare, and found in the Himâlayas.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[65:39](sbe0220.htm#fr_400) Haradatta closes
this chapter on flesh-eating by quoting Manu V, 56, which declares
flesh-eating, drinking spirituous liquor, and promiscuous intercourse to
be allowable, but the abstinence therefrom of greater merit. He states
that the whole chapter must be understood in this sense.
