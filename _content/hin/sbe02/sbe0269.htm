As the oblations to the gods and the other (Mah&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as) are mentioned before the kindling of the domestic fire, they must be performed by a person who has not yet kindled the domestic fire with the aid of the common (kitchen) fire.'--Haradatta.</P>

But the opinion of the teacher (Gautama) is that he shall use the sacred fire which has been kindled on that occasion.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_947"></A><A HREF="sbe0269.htm#fr_948">201:9</A> Haradatta states that the Mah&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as are again enumerated in order to show that a person who has kindled the sacred fire shall use this for them, not a common fire. He also states that a passage of U<I>s</I>anas, according to which some teachers prescribe the performance of the daily recitation near the sacred fire, shows that this rite too has a connection with the sacred fire.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_948"></A><A HREF="sbe0269.htm#fr_949">202:10</A> &Acirc;pastamba II, 2, 3, 16, where, however, as in all other works, the order of the offerings differs. Haradatta adds that the word 'oblations' is used in the S&ucirc;tra in order to indicate that the word sv&acirc;h&acirc; must be pronounced at the end of each Mantra, and that the expression 'in the fire' indicates that the Bali-offerings described in the following S&ucirc;tra must be thrown on the ground.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_949"></A><A HREF="sbe0269.htm#fr_950">202:11</A> Compare &Acirc;pastamba II, 2, 3, 20-II, 2, 4, 8; Manu III, 87-90, where, as elsewhere, the order of the offerings differs. According to Haradatta the deities intended are, Indra, Agni, Yama, Nir<I>ri</I>ti, Varu<I>n</I>a, V&acirc;yu, Soma, and &Icirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;na. The first offering must be placed to the east, the next to the south-east, south, &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_950"></A><A HREF="sbe0269.htm#fr_951">202:12</A> At all the doors, as many as there are, a Bali must be offered with the Mantra, 'To the Maruts, sv&acirc;h&acirc;.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_951"></A><A HREF="sbe0269.htm#fr_952">202:13</A> 'As he says "inside" (pravi<I>s</I>ya, literally "entering") he must stand outside while offering the Balis at the doors. At this occasion some require the following Mantra, "To the deities of the dwelling, sv&acirc;h&acirc;," because that is found in the &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana (G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra I, 2, 4). Others consider it necessary to mention the deities by name, and to present as many offerings as there are deities, while pronouncing the required words.'--Haradatta. The commentator then goes on to quote a passage from U<I>s</I>anas, which he considers applicable, because it contains the names of the G<I>ri</I>hadevat&acirc;s. I doubt, however, if the 'others' are right, and still more if, in case they should be right, it would be advisable to supply the names of the G<I>ri</I>hadevat&acirc;s from U<I>s</I>anas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_952"></A><A HREF="sbe0269.htm#fr_953">203:14</A> 'Because the word "and" occurs in S&ucirc;tra 11 after the word "to the deities presiding over the points of the horizon" a Bali-offering must be presented to the deities mentioned by the author in S&ucirc;tra 10, viz. to the earth, wind, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and to all the gods, after a Bali has been offered to Brahman.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_953"></A><A HREF="sbe0269.htm#fr_954">203:16</A> 'The Bali presented to &Acirc;k&acirc;<I>s</I>a, "the ether," must be thrown up into the air, as Manu says, III, 90.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_954"></A><A HREF="sbe0269.htm#fr_955">203:17</A> 'Because of the word "and," he must, also, present Balis to the deities mentioned above.'--Haradatta. The commentator means to say that in the evening not only the 'Beings walking about at night' (nakta<I>m</I><I>k</I>ara) are to receive a portion, but all the other deities too, and that the Balikarma must be offered twice a day.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_956"></A><A HREF="sbe0269.htm#fr_957">203:20</A> According to Haradatta the term <I>S</I>rotriya here denotes one who has studied one Veda, (but see also &Acirc;pastamba II, 3, 6, 4; II, 4, 8, 5.) Vedap&acirc;raga is a man who has studied one Veda, together with the A&#7749;gas, Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras, and Upanishads.</P>
