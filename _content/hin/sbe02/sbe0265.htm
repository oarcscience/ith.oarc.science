Haradatta explains the term 'avara,' translated by 'men of later ages,' to mean 'men like ourselves' (asmad&acirc;di). In his comment on the parallel passage of &Acirc;pastamba be renders it by id&acirc;n&icirc;ntana, 'belonging to our times;' and in his notes on &Acirc;pastamba I, 2, 5, 4, he substitutes arv&acirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;na kaliyugavartin, 'men of modern times living in the Kaliyuga.' The last explanation seems to me the most accurate, if it is distinctly kept in mind that in the times of Gautama the Kaliyuga was not a definite period of calculated duration, but the Iron Age of sin as opposed to the happier times when justice still dwelt on earth.</P>

It must, however, be understood that the arrangement of the hair is not regulated by the individual choice of the student, but by the custom of his family, school, or country. In the commentary, as given by one of my MSS., it is stated the custom of shaving the whole head prevailed among the <I>Kh</I>andogas.

<P><A NAME="fn_814"></A><A HREF="sbe0265.htm#fr_815">178:28</A> The above translation agrees with Professor Stenzler's text and Manu V, 143. But according to Haradatta the meaning of. the S&ucirc;tra is not so simple. His explanation is as follows: 'If while holding things in his hands he becomes impure, i.e. he is defiled by urine, f&aelig;ces, leavings of food, and the like (impurities) which are causes for sipping water, then he shall sip water after placing those things on the ground. This refers to uncooked food, intended to be eaten. And thus Vasish<I>th</I>a (III, 4, 3, Benares edition) declares: "If he who is occupied with eatables touches any impure substance, then he shall place that thing on the ground, sip water, and afterwards again use it." But the following text of another Sm<I>ri</I>ti, "A substance becomes pure by being sprinkled with water after having been placed on the ground," refers to cooked food, such as boiled rice and the like. Or (the above S&ucirc;tra may mean), "If he becomes impure while holding things in his hands, then he shall sip water without laying them on the ground." And thus Manu (V, 143) says: "He who carries in any manner anything in his hands and is touched by an impure substance shall cleanse himself by sipping water without laying his burden down." This rule refers to things not destined to be eaten, such as garments. And in the (above) S&ucirc;tra the words, "He who becomes impure shall sip water," must be taken as one sentence, and (the whole), " If while holding things in his hands he becomes impure, <A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A> he shall sip water without laying (them) down," must be taken as a second.'</p>  
<p>Though it may be doubted if the yogavibh&acirc;ga, or ' division of the construction,' proposed by Haradatta, is admissible, still it seems to me not improbable that Gautama intended his S&ucirc;tra to be taken in two different ways. For, if according to the ancient custom it is written without an Avagraha and without separating the words joined by Sandhi, dravyabasta u<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ish<I>t</I>onidh&acirc;y&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;met, the latter group may either stand for u<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ish<I>t</I>o nidh&acirc;ya &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;met or for u<I>k</I><I>kh</I>is<I>t</I>o anidh&acirc;ya &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;met. As the S&ucirc;tra-k&acirc;ras aim before all things at brevity, the S&ucirc;tra may have to be read both ways. If that had to be done, the correct translation would be: 'If while holding things in his hands, be becomes impure, he shall (purify himself by) sipping water, either laying (his burden) down (or) not laying it down, (as the case may require.)'</P>

The purification of these two is the same as that of wood, i.e. by scraping (or planing). How is it proper that, since the author has declared (S&ucirc;tra 29) that objects made of wood shall be purified by planing, the expression "like wood" should be substituted (in this S&ucirc;tra)? (The answer is that), as the author uses the expression "like wood," when he ought to have said "like objects made of wood," he indicates thereby that the manner of purification is the same for the material as for the object made thereof.'--Haradatta. The <A NAME="page_180"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 180</FONT></A> S&ucirc;tra is, therefore, a so-called <I>G</I><I>&ntilde;</I>apaka, intended to reveal the existence of a general rule or paribh&acirc;sh&acirc; which has not been given explicitly.</P>

<p>What Haradatta and probably Gautama mean, is that the mud floors of houses, verandahs, and spots of ground selected for sitting on, if defiled, should be scraped, and that afterwards fresh earth should be scattered over the spot thus cleansed. See, however, Manu V, 125, who recommends earth for the purification of other things also. The S&ucirc;tra may also be interpreted so as to agree with his rule. </P>
