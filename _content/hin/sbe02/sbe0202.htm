<p>FOR all students of Sanskrit philology and Indian history &Acirc;pastamba's aphorisms on the sacred law of the Aryan Hindus possess a special interest beyond that attaching to other works of the same class. Their discovery enabled Professor Max M&uuml;ller, forty-seven years ago, to dispose finally of the Brahmanical legend according to which Hindu society was supposed to be governed by the codes of ancient sages, compiled for the express purpose of tying down each individual to his station, and of strictly regulating even the smallest acts of his daily life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It enabled</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_x"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. x</FONT></A></p>  
<p>him not only to arrive at this negative result, but also to substitute a sounder theory the truth of which subsequent investigations have further confirmed, and to show that the sacred law of the Hindus has its source in the teaching of the Vedic schools, and that the so-called revealed law codes are, in most cases, but improved metrical editions of older</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>prose works which latter, in the first instance, were destined to be committed to memory by the young Aryan students, and to teach them their duties. This circumstance, as well as the fact that &Acirc;pastamba's work is free from any suspicion of having been tampered with by sectarians or modern editors, and that its intimate connection with the manuals teaching the performance of the great and small sacrifices, the <I>S</I>rauta and G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, which are attributed to the same author, is perfectly clear and indisputable, entitle it, in spite of its comparatively late origin, to the first place in a collection of Dharma-s&ucirc;tras.</p>  
<p>The &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya Dharma-s&ucirc;tra forms part of an enormous Kalpa-s&ucirc;tra or body of aphorisms, which digests the teaching of the Veda and of the ancient <I>Ri</I>shis regarding the performance of sacrifices and the duties of twice-born men, Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, Kshatriyas, and Vai<I>s</I>yas, and which, being chiefly based on the second of the four Vedas, the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda in the Taittir&icirc;ya recension, is primarily intended for the benefit of the Adhvaryu priests in whose families the study of the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda is hereditary.</p>  
<p>The entire Kalpa-s&ucirc;tra of &Acirc;pastamba is divided into</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thirty sections, called Pra<I>s</I>nas, literally questions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The first twenty-four of these teach the performance of the so-called <I>S</I>rauta or Vait&acirc;nika sacrifices, for which several sacred fires are required, beginning with the simplest rites, the new and full moon offerings, and ending with the complicated Sattras or sacrificial sessions, which last a whole year or even longer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The twenty-fifth Pra<I>s</I>na contains the Paribh&acirc;sh&acirc;s or general rules of interpretation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, which are valid for the whole Kalpa-s&ucirc;tra, the Pravara-kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, the chapter enumerating the patriarchs of the various Brahmanical tribes, and finally the Hautraka, prayers to be recited by the Hotraka priests. The twenty-sixth section gives the Mantras or Vedic prayers and formulas for the G<I>ri</I>hya rites, the ceremonies for which the sacred domestic or G<I>ri</I>hya fire is required, and the twenty-seventh the rules for the performance of the latter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The aphorisms on the sacred law fill the next two Pra<I>s</I>nas; and the <I>S</I>ulva-s&ucirc;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, teaching the geometrical principles, according to which the altars necessary for the <I>S</I>rauta sacrifices must be constructed, concludes the work with the thirtieth Pra<I>s</I>na.</p>  
<p>The position of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra in the middle of the collection at once raises the presumption that it originally formed an integral portion of the body of S&ucirc;tras and that it is not a later addition. Had it been added later, it would either stand at the end of the thirty Pra<I>s</I>nas or altogether outside the collection, as is the case with some other treatises attributed to &Acirc;pastamba&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. The Hindus are, no doubt, unscrupulous in adding to the works of famous teachers. But such additions, if of considerable extent, are usually not embodied in the works themselves which they are intended to supplement. They are mostly given</p>

<p>as <I>s</I>eshas or parisi<I>s</I>h<I>t</I>as, tacked on at the end, and generally marked as such in the MSS.</p>  
<p>In the case of the &Acirc;pastamba Dharma-s&ucirc;tra it is, however, not necessary to rely on its position alone, in order to ascertain its genuineness. There are unmistakable indications that it is the work of the same author who wrote the remainder of the Kalpa-s&ucirc;tra. One important argument in favour of this view is furnished by the fact that Pra<I>s</I>na XXVII, the section on the G<I>ri</I>hya ceremonies has evidently been made very short and concise with the intention of saving matter for the subsequent sections on the sacred law. The &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra contains nothing beyond a bare outline of the domestic ceremonies, while most of the other G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, e.g. those of &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana, <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana, Gobhila, and P&acirc;raskara, include a great many rules which bear indirectly only on the performance of the offerings in the sacred domestic fire. Thus on the occasion of the description of the initiation of Aryan students, &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana inserts directions regarding the dress and girdle to be worn, the length of the studentship, the manner of begging, the disposal of the alms collected, and other similar questions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The exclusion of such incidental remarks on subjects that are not immediately connected with the chief aim of the work, is almost complete in &Acirc;pastamba's G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, and reduces its size to less than one half of the extent of the shorter ones among the works enumerated above. It seems impossible to explain this restriction of the scope of Pra<I>s</I>na XXVII otherwise than by assuming that &Acirc;pastamba wished to reserve all rules bearing rather on the duties of men than on the performance of the domestic offerings, for his sections on the sacred law.</p>  
<p>A second and no less important argument for the unity of the whole Kalpa-s&ucirc;tra may be drawn from the cross-references which occur in several Pra<I>s</I>nas. In the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra we find that on various occasions, where the performance</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xiv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xiv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of a ceremony is prescribed, the expressions yathoktam, 'as has been stated,' yathopade<I>s</I>am, 'according to the injunction,' or yath&acirc; purast&acirc;t, 'as above,' are added. In four of these passages, Dh. I, 1, 4, 16; II, 2, 3, 17; 2, 5, 4; and 7, 17, 16, the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra is doubtlessly referred to, and the commentator Haradatta has pointed out this fact. On the other hand, the G<I>ri</I>hya-S&ucirc;tra refers to the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, employing the same expressions which have been quoted from the latter. Thus we read in the beginning of the chapter on funeral oblations, G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra VIII, 21, 1, m&acirc;si<I>s</I>r&acirc;ddhasy&acirc;parapakshe yathopade<I>s</I>a<I>m</I> k&acirc;l&acirc;<I>h</I>, 'the times for the monthly funeral sacrifice (fall) in the latter (dark) half of the month according to the injunction.' Now as neither the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra itself nor any preceding portion of the Kalpa-s&ucirc;tra contains any injunction on this point, it, follows that the long passage on this subject which occurs in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra II, 7, 16, 4-22 is referred to. The expression yathopade<I>s</I>am is also found in other passages of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, and must be explained there in a like manner&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. There are further a certain number of S&ucirc;tras which occur in the same words both in the Pra<I>s</I>na on domestic rites, and in that on the sacred law, e.g. Dh. I, 1, A; I, 1, 2, 38; I, 1, 4, 14. It seems that the author wished to call special attention to these rules by repeating them. Their recurrence and literal agreement may be considered an additional proof of the intimate connection of the two sections.</p>  
<p>Through a similar repetition of, at least, one S&ucirc;tra it is possible to trace the connection of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra with the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra. The rule <I>ri</I>tve v&acirc; <I>g</I>&acirc;y&acirc;m, 'or (he may have conjugal intercourse) with his wife in the proper season', is given, Dh. II, 2, 5, 17, with reference to a householder who teaches the Veda. In the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra it occurs twice, in the sections on the new and full moon sacrifices III, 17, 8, and again in connection with the <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;sya offerings, VIII, 4, 6, and it refers both times</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to the sacrificer. In the first passage the verb, upey&acirc;t, is added, which the sense requires; in the second it has the abbreviated form, which the best MSS. of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra offer. The occurrence of the irregular word, ritve for <I>ri</I>tvye, in all the three passages, proves clearly that we have to deal with a self-quotation of the same author. If the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra were the production of a different person and a later addition, the Pseudo-&Acirc;pastamba would most probably not have hit on this peculiar irregular form. Finally, the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, too, contains several cross-references to the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra, and the close agreement of the S&ucirc;tras on the Vedic sacrifices, on the domestic rites, and on the sacred, both in language and style, conclusively prove that they are the compositions of one author&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Who this author really was, is a problem which cannot be solved for the present, and which probably will. always remain unsolved, because we know his family name only. For the form of the word itself shows that the name &Acirc;pastamba, just like those of most founders of Vedic schools, e.g. Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a, &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana, Gautama, is a patronymic. This circumstance is, of course, fatal to all attempts at an identification of the individual who holds so prominent a place among the teachers of the Black Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda.</p>  
<p>But we are placed in a somewhat better position with respect to the history of the school which has been named after &Acirc;pastamba and of the works ascribed to him. Regarding both, some information has been preserved by tradition, and a little more can be obtained from inscriptions and later works, while some interesting details regarding the time when, and the place where the S&ucirc;tras were composed, may be elicited from the latter themselves. The data, obtainable from these sources, it is true, do not enable us to determine with certainty the year when the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school was founded, and when its S&ucirc;tras were composed. But they make it possible to ascertain the position of the school and of its S&ucirc;tras in Vedic literature,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>their relative priority or posteriority as compared with other Vedic schools and works, to show with some amount of probability in which part of India they had their origin, and to venture, at least, a not altogether unsupported conjecture as to their probable antiquity.</p>  
<p>As regards the first point, the <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>avy&ucirc;ha, a supplement of the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda which gives the lists of the Vedic schools, informs us that the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school formed one of the five branches of the Kh&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&icirc;ya school, which in its turn was a subdivision of the Taittir&icirc;yas, one of the ancient sections of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as who study, the Black Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda. Owing to the very unsatisfactory condition of the text of the <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>avy&ucirc;ha it is unfortunately not possible to ascertain what place that work really assigns to the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas among the five branches of the, Kh&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&icirc;yas. Some MSS. name them first, and others, last. They give either the following list, 1. K&acirc;leyas (K&acirc;letas), 2. S&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;vanins, 3. Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>ins, 4. Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>ins, and 5. &Acirc;pastambins, or, 1. &Acirc;pastambins, 2. Baudh&acirc;yanins or Bodh&acirc;yanins, 3. Saty&acirc;sh&acirc;<I>dh</I>ins, 4. Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>ins, 5. Aukheyas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But this defect is remedied to, a certain extent by the now generally current, and probably ancient tradition that the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas are younger than, the school of Baudh&acirc;yana, and. older than that of Saty&acirc;sh&acirc;<I>dh</I>a Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in. Baudh&acirc;yana, it is alleged, composed the first set of S&ucirc;tras connected with the Black Ya<I>g</I>ur-Veda, which bore the special title 'prava<I>k</I>ana,' and he was succeeded by Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a, &Acirc;pastamba, and Saty&acirc;sh&acirc;<I>dh</I>a Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in, who all founded schools which bear their names&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>This tradition has preserved two important pieces of in-formation. First, the &Acirc;pastamba school is what Professor Max M&uuml;ller appropriately calls a S&ucirc;tra<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>a, i.e. a school whose founder did not pretend to have received a revelation of Vedic Mantras or of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a text, but merely gave a new systematic arrangement of the precepts regarding sacrifices and the sacred law. Secondly, the S&ucirc;tras of &Acirc;pastamba occupy an intermediate position between the works of Baudh&acirc;yana and Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in. Both these statements are perfectly true, and capable of being supported by proofs, drawn from &Acirc;pastamba's own and from other works.</p>  
<p>As regards the first point, Professor Max M&uuml;ller has already pointed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> out that, though we sometimes find a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas mentioned, the title &Acirc;pastamba-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is nothing but another name of the Taittir&icirc;ya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and that this Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, in reality, is always attributed to Tittiri or to the pupils of Vai<I>s</I>amp&acirc;yana, who are said to have picked up the Black Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda in the shape of partridges (tittiri). The same remark applies to the collection of the Mantras of the Black Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, which, likewise, is sometimes named &Acirc;pastamba-Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;. The <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>avy&ucirc;ha states explicitly that the five branches of the Kh&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&icirc;k&icirc;ya school, to which the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas belong, possess one and the same recension of the revealed texts, consisting of 7 K&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 44 Pra<I>s</I>nas, 651 Anuv&acirc;kas, 2198 Pann&acirc;s&icirc;s, 19290 Padas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and 253,868 syllables, and indicates thereby that all these five schools were S&ucirc;tra<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>as.</p>  
<p>If we now turn to &Acirc;pastamba's own works, we find still</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xviii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xviii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>clearer proof that he laid no claim to the title <I>Ri</I>shi, or inspired seer of Vedic texts. For (Dharma-s&ucirc;tra I, 2, 5, 4-5 says distinctly that on account of the prevalent transgression of the rules of studentship no <I>Ri</I>shis are born, among the Avaras, the men of later ages or of modern times, but that some, by virtue of a residue of the merit which they acquired in former lives, become similar to <I>Ri</I>shis by their knowledge of the Veda. A man who speaks in this manner, shows that he considers the holy ages during which the great saints saw with their mind's eye the uncreated and eternal texts of the Veda to be past, and that all he claims is a thorough acquaintance with the scriptures which had been handed down to him. The same spirit which dictated this passage is also observable in other portions of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. For &Acirc;pastamba repeatedly contrasts the weakness and sinfulness of the Avaras, the men of his own times, with the holiness of the ancient sages, who, owing to the greatness of their 'lustre,' were able to commit various forbidden acts without diminishing their spiritual merit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. These utterances prove that &Acirc;pastamba considered himself a child of the Kali Yuga, the age of sin, during which, according to Hindu notions, no <I>Ri</I>shis can be born. If, therefore, in spite of this explicit disclaimer, the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; and the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the Black Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda are sometimes called &Acirc;pastamba or &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya, i.e. belonging to &Acirc;pastamba, the meaning of this expression can only be, that they were and are studied and handed down by the school of &Acirc;pastamba, not that its founder was their author, or, as the Hindus would say, saw them.</p>  
<p>The fact that &Acirc;pastamba confined his activity to the composition of S&ucirc;tras is highly important for the determination of the period to which he belonged. It clearly shows that in his time the tertiary or S&ucirc;tra period of the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda had begun. Whether we assume, with Professor Max M&uuml;ller, that the S&ucirc;tra period was one and the same for all the four Vedas, and fix its limits with him</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xix"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xix</FONT></A></p>  
<p>between 600-200 B.C., or whether we believe, as I am inclined to do, that the date of the S&ucirc;tra period differed for each Veda, still the incontestable conclusion is that the origin of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school cannot be placed in the early times of the Vedic period, and probably falls in the last six or seven centuries before the beginning of the Christian era.</p>  
<p>The correctness of the traditional statement that &Acirc;pastamba is younger than Baudh&acirc;yana may be made very probable by the following considerations. First, Baudh&acirc;yana's and &Acirc;pastamba's works on Dharma have a considerable number of S&ucirc;tras in common. Thus in the chapter on Penances not less than seven consecutive S&ucirc;tras, prescribing the manner in which outcasts are to live and to obtain readmission into the Brahmanical community for their children, occur in both treatises&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Besides this passage, there are a number of single S&ucirc;tras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> which agree literally. Taken by itself this agreement does not prove much, as it may be explained in various ways. It may show either that Baudh&acirc;yana is older than &Acirc;pastamba, and that the latter borrowed from the former, or that the reverse was the case. It may also indicate that both authors drew from one common source. But if it is taken together with two other facts, it gains a considerable importance. First, &Acirc;pastamba holds in several cases doctrines which are of a later origin than those held by Baudh&acirc;yana. With respect to this point the puritan opinions which &Acirc;pastamba puts forward regarding the substitutes for legitimate sons and regarding the appointment of widows (niyoga), and his restriction of the number of marriage-rites, may be adduced as examples. Like many other ancient teachers, Baudh&acirc;yana permits childless &Acirc;ryans to satisfy their craving for representatives bearing their name, and to allay their fears of falling after death into the regions of torment through a failure of the funeral oblations, by the affiliation</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xx"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xx</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of-eleven kinds of substitutes for a legitimate son. Illegitimate sons, the illegitimate sons of wives, the legitimate -and illegitimate offspring of daughters, and the children of relatives, or even of strangers who may be solemnly adopted, or received as members of the family without any ceremony, or be acquired by purchase, are all allowed to take the place and the rights of legitimate sons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. &Acirc;pastamba declares his dissent from this doctrine. He allows legitimate sons alone to inherit their father's estate and to follow the occupations of his caste, and he explicitly forbids the sale and gift of children&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>In like manner he protests against the custom of making over childless widows to brothers-in-law or other near relatives in order to obtain sons who are to offer the funeral oblations to the deceased husband's manes, while Baudh&acirc;yana has as yet no scruple on the subject&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Finally, he omits from his list of the marriage-rites the Pai<I>s</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>a viv&acirc;ha, where the bride is obtained by fraud&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; though it is reluctantly admitted by Baudh&acirc;yana and other ancient teachers. There can be no doubt that the law which placed the regular continuance of the funeral oblations above all other considerations, and which allowed, in order to secure this object, even a violation of the sanctity of the marriage-tie and other breaches of the principles of morality, belongs to an older order of ideas than the stricter views of &Acirc;pastamba. It is true that, according to Baudh&acirc;yana's own statement&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, before his time an ancient sage named Aupa<I>g</I>a&#7749;ghani, who is also mentioned in the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, had opposed the old practice of taking substitute's for a legitimate son. It is also very probable that for a long time the opinions of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a teachers, who lived in different parts of India and belonged to different schools, may have been divided on this subject. Still it seems very improbable that of two authors who both belong to the same Veda and to the same school, the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>earlier one should hold the later doctrine, and the later one the earlier opinion. The contrary appears the more probable assumption. The same remarks apply to the cases of the Niyoga and of the Pai<I>s</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>a marriage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The second fact, which bears on the question how the identity of so many S&ucirc;tras in the two Dharma-s&ucirc;tras is to be explained, affords a still stronger proof of &Acirc;pastamba's posteriority to Baudh&acirc;yana. For on several occasions, it appears, &Acirc;pastamba controverts opinions which Baudh&acirc;yana holds, or which may be defended with the help of the latter's S&ucirc;tras. The clearest case of this kind occurs in the chapter on Inheritance, where the treatment of the eldest son on the division of the estate by the father is discussed. There &Acirc;pastamba gives it as his own opinion that the father should make an equal division of his property 'after having gladdened the eldest son by some (choice portion of his) wealth,' i.e. after making him a present which should have some value, but should not be so valuable as to materially affect the equality of the shares&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Further on he notices the opinions of other teachers on this subject, and states that the practice advocated by some, of allowing the eldest alone to inherit, as well as the custom prevailing in some countries, of allotting to the eldest all the father's gold, or the black cows, or the black iron and grain, is not in accordance with the precepts of the Vedas. In order to prove the latter assertion he quotes a passage of the Taittir&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, in which it is declared that 'Manu divided his wealth among his sons,' and no difference in the treatment of the eldest son is prescribed. He adds that a second passage occurs in the same Veda, which declares that 'they distinguish the eldest son by (a larger portion of) the heritage,' and which thus apparently countenances the partiality for the first-born. But this second passage, he contends, appealing to the</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>opinion of the M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>sists, is, like many similar ones, merely a statement of a fact which has not the authority of an injunction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. If we now turn to Baudh&acirc;yana, we find that he allows of three different methods for the distribution of the paternal estate. According to him, either an equal share may be given to each son, or the eldest may receive the best part of the wealth, or, also, a preferential share of one tenth of the whole property. He further alleges that the cows, horses, goats, and sheep respectively go to the eldest sons of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, Kshatriyas, Vai<I>s</I>yas and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras. As authority for the equal division he gives the first of the two Vedic passages quoted above; and for the doctrine that the eldest is to receive the best part of the estate, he quotes the second passage which &Acirc;pastamba considers to be without the force of an injunction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The fact that the two authors' opinions clash is manifest, and the manner in which &Acirc;pastamba tries to show that the second Vedic passage possesses no authority, clearly indicates that before his time it had been held to contain an injunction. As no other author of a Dharma-s&ucirc;tra but Baudh&acirc;yana is known to have quoted it, the conclusion is that &Acirc;pastamba's remarks are directed against him. If &Acirc;pastamba does not mention Baudh&acirc;yana by name, the reason probably is that in olden times, just as in the present day, the Brahmanical etiquette forbad a direct opposition against doctrines propounded by an older teacher who belongs to the same spiritual family (vidy&acirc;va<I>m</I>sa) as oneself.</p>  
<p>A similar case occurs in the chapter on Studentship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> where &Acirc;pastamba, again appealing to the M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>sists, combats the doctrine that pupils may eat forbidden food, such as honey, meat, and pungent condiments, if it is given to them as leavings by their teacher. Baudh&acirc;yana gives no explicit rule on this point, but the wording of his S&ucirc;tras is not opposed to the doctrine and practice, to which &Acirc;pastamba objects. Baudh&acirc;yana says that students</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxiii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxiii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>shall avoid honey, meat, pungent condiments, &amp;c.; he further enjoins that pupils are to obey their teachers except when ordered to commit crimes which cause loss of caste (patan&icirc;ya); and he finally directs them to eat the fragments of food given to them by their teachers. As the eating of honey and other forbidden substances is not a crime causing loss of caste, it is possible that Baudh&acirc;yana himself may have considered it the duty of a pupil to eat any kind of food given by the teacher, even honey and meat. At all events the practice and doctrine which &Acirc;pastamba blames, may have been defended by the wording of Baudh&acirc;yana's rules&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The three points which have been just discussed, viz. the identity of a number of S&ucirc;tras in the works of the two authors, the fact that &Acirc;pastamba advocates on some points more refined or puritan opinions, and, especially, that he labours to controvert doctrines contained in Baudh&acirc;yana's S&ucirc;tras, give a powerful support to the traditional statement that he is younger than that teacher. It is, however, difficult to say how great the distance between the two really is. Mah&acirc;deva, as stated above, places between them only Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a, the author of a set of S&ucirc;tras, which as yet have not been completely recovered. But it seems to me not likely that the latter was his immediate predecessor in the vidy&acirc;va<I>m</I>sa or spiritual family to which both belonged. For it cannot be expected that two successive heads of the school should each have composed a S&ucirc;tra and thus founded a new branch-school. It is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxiv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxiv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>more probable that Baudh&acirc;yana and Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a, as well as the latter and &Acirc;pastamba, were separated by several intervening generations of teachers, who contented themselves with explaining the works of their predecessors. The distance in years between the first and the last of the three S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ras must, therefore, I think, be measured rather by centuries than by decades&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>As regards the priority of &Acirc;pastamba to the school of Saty&acirc;sh&acirc;<I>dh</I>a Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in, there can be no doubt about the correctness of this statement. For either Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in himself, or, at least, his immediate successors have appropriated &Acirc;pastamba's Dharma-s&ucirc;tra and have inserted it with slight modifications in their own collection. The alterations consist chiefly in some not very important additions, and in the substitution of more intelligible and more modern expressions for difficult and antiquated words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. But they do not extend so far as to make the language of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra fully agree with that of the other sections of the collection, especially with the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra. Numerous discrepancies between these two parts are observable. Thus we read in the Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>i</p>

<p><A NAME="page_xxv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxv</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra that a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a must, ordinarily, be initiated in his seventh year, while the rule of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, which is identical with &Acirc;p. Dh. I, 1, 1, 18, prescribes that the ceremony shall take place in the eighth year after conception. The commentators, M&acirc;t<I>ri</I>datta on the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra and Mah&acirc;deva on the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, both state that the rule of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra refers to the seventh year after birth, and, therefore, in substance agrees with the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. They are no doubt right. But the difference in the wording shows that the two sections do not belong to the same author. The same inference may be drawn from the fact that the Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>i G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, which is much longer than &Acirc;pastamba's, includes a considerable amount of matter which refers to the sacred law, and which is repeated in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. According to a statement which I have heard from several learned Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, the followers of Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in, when pronouncing the sa<I>m</I>kalpa or solemn pledge to perform a ceremony, declare themselves to be members of the Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>i school that forms a subdivision of &Acirc;pastamba's (&acirc;pastamb&acirc;ntargatahira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>i<I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;dhy&acirc;y&icirc; . . . aham). But I have not been able to find these words in the books treating of the ritual of the Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>ins, such as the Mahesabha<I>t</I><I>t</I>&icirc;. If this assertion could be further corroborated, it would be an additional strong proof of the priority of &Acirc;pastamba, which, however, even without it may be accepted as a fact&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The distance in time between the two teachers is probably not so great as that between &Acirc;pastamba and Baudh&acirc;yana, as Mah&acirc;deva mentions no intermediate S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra between them. Still it is probably not less than 100, or 150 years.</p>  
<p>The results of the above investigation which show that the origin of the &Acirc;pastamba school falls in the middle of the S&ucirc;tra period of the Black Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, and that its S&ucirc;tras belong to the later, though not to the latest products of Vedic literature, are fully confirmed by an</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>examination of the quotations from and references to Vedic and other books contained in &Acirc;pastamba's S&ucirc;tras, and especially in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. We find that all the four Vedas are quoted or referred to. The three old ones, the <I>Ri</I>k, Ya<I>g</I>us, and S&acirc;man, are mentioned both separately and collectively by the name tray&icirc; vidy&acirc;, i.e. threefold sacred science, and the fourth is called not Atharv&acirc;&#7749;girasa<I>h</I>, as is done in most ancient S&ucirc;tras, but Atharva-veda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The quotations from the <I>Ri</I>k and S&acirc;man are not very numerous. But a passage from the ninth Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala of the former, which is referred to Dh. I, 1, 2, 2, is of some extent, and shows that the recension which &Acirc;pastamba knew, did not differ from that which still exists. As &Acirc;pastamba was an adherent of the Black Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, he quotes it, especially in the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra, very frequently, and he adduces not only texts from the Mantra-Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, but also from the Taittir&icirc;ya-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka. The most important quotations from the latter work occur Dh. II, 2, 3, 16-II, 2, 4, 9, where all the Mantras to be recited during the performance of the Bali-offerings are enumerated. Their order agrees exactly with that in which they stand in the sixty-seventh Anuv&acirc;ka of the tenth Prap&acirc;<I>th</I>aka of the recension of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka which is current among the &Acirc;ndhra Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. This last point is of considerable importance, both for the history of the text of that book and, as we shall see further on, for the history of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school.</p>  
<p>The White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, too, is quoted frequently in the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra and once in the section on Dharma by the title V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyaka, while twice its Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyi-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, is cited. The longer one of the two passages, taken from the latter work, Dh. I, 4, 12, 3, does, however, not fully agree with the published text of the M&acirc;dhyandina recension. Its wording possesses just sufficient resemblance to allow us to identify the passage which &Acirc;pastamba meant, but differs from the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a</p>  
<p>

<p>in many details&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The cause of these discrepancies remains doubtful for the present&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. As regards the Atharva-veda, &Acirc;pastamba gives, besides the reference mentioned above and a second to the &Acirc;&#7749;girasa-pavitra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, an abstract of a long passage from Atharva-veda XV, 10-13, regarding the treatment of a Vr&acirc;tya, i.e. a learned mendicant Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, who really deserves the title of an atithi, or guest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. It is true that &Acirc;pastamba, in the passage referred to, does not say that his rule is based on the Atharva-veda. He merely says that a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is his authority. But it seems, nevertheless, certain that by the expression a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a-like fifteenth book of the Atharva-veda is meant, as the sentences to be addressed by the host to his guest agree literally with those which the Atharva-veda prescribes for the reception of a Vr&acirc;tya. Haradatta too, in his commentary, expresses the same opinion. Actual quotations from the Atharva-veda are not frequent in Vedic literature, and the fact that &Acirc;pastamba's Dharma-s&ucirc;tra contains one, is, therefore, of some interest.</p>  
<p>Besides these Vedic texts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, &Acirc;pastamba mentions, also, the A&#7749;gas or auxiliary works, and enumerates six classes, viz. treatises on the ritual of the sacrifices, on grammar, astronomy, etymology, recitation of the Veda, and metrics&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. The number is the same as that which is considered the correct one in our days&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>As the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra names no less than nine teachers in connection with various topics of the sacred law, and frequently appeals to the opinion of some (eke), it follows that a great many such auxiliary treatises must have existed in &Acirc;pastamba's time. The &Acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ryas mentioned are Eka, Ka<I>n</I>va, K&acirc;<I>n</I>va, Ku<I>n</I>ika, Kutsa, Kautsa, Pushkaras&acirc;di,</p>

Some of these persons, like H&acirc;rita and K&acirc;<I>n</I>va, are known to have composed S&ucirc;tras on the sacred law, and fragments or modified versions of their works are still in existence, while K&acirc;<I>n</I>va, Kautsa, Pushkaras&acirc;di or Paushkaras&acirc;di, as the grammatically correct form of the name is, and V&acirc;rshy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>i are quoted in the Nirukta, the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khyas, and the V&acirc;rttikas on P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini as authorities on phonetics, etymology, and grammar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. K&acirc;<I>n</I>va, finally, is considered the author of the still existing Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras of the K&acirc;<I>n</I>va school connected with the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda. It seems not improbable that most of these teachers were authors of complete sets of A&#7749;gas. Their position in Vedic literature, however, except as far as K&acirc;<I>n</I>va, H&acirc;rita, and <I>S</I>vetaketu are concerned, is difficult to define, and the occurrence of their names throws less light on the antiquity of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school than might be expected. Regarding H&acirc;rita it must, however, be noticed that he is one of the oldest authors of S&ucirc;tras, that he was an adherent of the Maitr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and that he is quoted by Baudh&acirc;yana, &Acirc;pastamba's predecessor. The bearing of the occurrence of <I>S</I>vetaketu's name will be discussed below.</p>  
<p>Of even greater interest than the names of the teachers are the indications which &Acirc;pastamba gives, that he knew two of the philosophical schools which still exist in India, viz. the P&ucirc;rv&acirc; or Karma M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>s&acirc; and the Ved&acirc;nta. As regards the former, he mentions it by its ancient name, Ny&acirc;ya, which in later times and at present is usually applied to the doctrine of Gautama Akshap&acirc;da. In two passages&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> he settles contested points on the authority of those who know the Ny&acirc;ya, i.e. the P&ucirc;rv&acirc; M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>s&acirc;, and</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxix"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxix</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in several other cases he adopts a line of reasoning which fully agrees with that followed in <I>G</I>aimini's M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras. Thus the arguments&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, that 'a revealed text has greater weight than a custom from which a revealed text may be inferred,' and that 'no text can be inferred from a custom for which a worldly motive is apparent,' exactly correspond with the teaching of <I>G</I>aimini's M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras I, 3, 3-4. The wording of the passages in the two works does not agree so closely that the one could be called a quotation of the other. But it is evident, that if &Acirc;pastamba did not know the M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras of <I>G</I>aimini, he must have possessed some other very similar work. As to the Ved&acirc;nta, &Acirc;pastamba does not mention the name of the school. But Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as 22, 23 of the first Pa<I>t</I>ala of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra unmistakably contain the chief tenets of the Ved&acirc;ntists, and recommend the acquisition of the knowledge of the &Acirc;tman as the best means for purifying the souls of sinners. Though these two Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as are chiefly filled with quotations, which, as the commentator states, are taken from an Upanishad, still the manner of their selection, as well as &Acirc;pastamba's own words in the introductory and concluding S&ucirc;tras, indicates that he knew not merely the unsystematic speculations contained in the Upanishads and &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas, but a well-defined system of Ved&acirc;ntic philosophy identical with that of B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's Brahma-s&ucirc;tras. The fact that &Acirc;pastamba's Dharma-s&ucirc;tra contains indications of the existence of these two schools of philosophy, is significant as the P&ucirc;rv&acirc; M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>s&acirc; occurs in one other Dharma-s&ucirc;tra only, that attributed to Vasish<I>th</I>a, and as the name of the Ved&acirc;nta school is not found in any of the prose treatises on the sacred law.</p>  
<p>Of non-Vedic works &Acirc;pastamba mentions the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a. The Dharma-s&ucirc;tra not only several times quotes passages from 'a Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a' as authorities for its rules&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, but names in one case the Bhavishyat-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a as the particular Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a from which the quotation is taken&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.

<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a in general are not unfrequent in other S&ucirc;tras on the sacred law, and even in older Vedic works. But &Acirc;pastamba, as far as I know, is the only S&ucirc;rak&acirc;ra who specifies the title of a particular Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a, and names one which is nearly or quite identical with that of a work existing in the present day, and he is the only one, whose quotations can be shown to be, at least in part, genuine Paur&acirc;<I>n</I>ic utterances.</p>  
<p>Among the so-called Upa-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as we find one of considerable extent which bears the title Bhavishya-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a or also Bhavishyat-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is true that the passage quoted in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra from the Bhavishyat-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a is not to be found in the copy of the Bhavishya-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a which I have seen. It is, therefore, not possible to assert positively that &Acirc;pastamba knew the present homonymous work. Still, considering the close resemblance of the two titles, and taking into account the generally admitted fact that most if not all Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as have been remodelled and recast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, it seems to me not unlikely that &Acirc;pastamba's</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>authority was the original on which the existing Upa-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a is based. And in favour of this view it may be urged that passages, similar to &Acirc;pastamba's quotation, actually occur in our Paur&acirc;<I>n</I>ic texts. In the <I>G</I>yotishpra<I>k</I>&acirc;ra section of several of the chief Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as we find, in connection with the description of the Path of the Manes (pit<I>ri</I>y&acirc;<I>n</I>a)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the assertion that the pious sages, who had offspring and performed the Agnihotra, reside there until the general destruction of created things (&acirc; bh&ucirc;tasa<I>m</I>plav&acirc;t), as well as, that in the beginning of each new creation they are the propagators of the world (lokasya sa<I>m</I>t&acirc;nakar&acirc;<I>h</I>) and, being re-born, re-establish the sacred law. Though the wording differs, these passages fully agree in sense with &Acirc;pastamba's Bhavishyat-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a which says, 'They (the ancestors) live in heaven until the (next) general destruction of created things. At the new creation (of the world) they become the seed.' In other passages of the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as, which refer to the successive creations, we find even the identical terms used in the quotation. Thus the V&acirc;yup., Adhy. 8, 23, declares that those beings, which have gone to the <I>G</I>analoka, 'become the seed at the new creation' (puna<I>h</I> sarge . . . b&icirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;rtha<I>m</I> t&acirc; bhavanti hi).</p>  
<p>These facts prove at all events that &Acirc;pastamba took his quotation from a real Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a, similar to those existing. If it is literal and exact, it shows, also, that the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as of his time contained both prose and verse.</p>  
<p>Further, it is possible. to trace yet another of &Acirc;pastamba's quotations from 'a Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a.' The three Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as, mentioned above, give, immediately after the passages referred to, enlarged versions of the two verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> regarding the sages, who begot offspring and obtained 'burial-grounds,' and</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>regarding those who, remaining chaste, gained immortality&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. In this case &Acirc;pastamba's quotation can be restored almost completely, if certain interpolations are cut out. And it is evident that &Acirc;pastamba has preserved genuine Paur&acirc;<I>n</I>ic verses in their ancient form. A closer study of the unfortunately much neglected Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as, no doubt, will lead to further identifications of other quotations, which will be of considerable interest for the history of Indian literature.</p>  
<p>There is yet another point on which &Acirc;pastamba shows a remarkable agreement with a theory which is prevalent in later Sanskrit literature. He says (Dh. II, 11, 29, 11-12), 'The knowledge which <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras and women possess, is the completion of all study,' and 'they declare that this knowledge is a supplement of the Atharva-veda.' The commentator remarks with reference to these two S&ucirc;tras, that 'the knowledge which <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras and women possess,' is the knowledge of dancing, acting, music, and other branches of the so-called Artha<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, the science of useful arts and of trades, and that the object of the S&ucirc;tras is to forbid the study of such matters before the acquisition of sacred learning. His interpretation is, without doubt, correct, as similar sentiments are expressed by other teachers in parallel passages. But, if it is accepted, &Acirc;pastamba's remark that 'the knowledge of <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras and women is a supplement of the Atharva-veda,' proves that he knew the division of Hindu learning which is taught in Madhus&ucirc;dana Sarasvat&icirc;'s Prasth&acirc;nabheda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. For Madhus&ucirc;dana allots to each Veda an Upa-veda or supplementary Veda, and asserts that the Upa-veda of the Atharva-veda is the Artha<I>s</I>&acirc;stra. The agreement of &Acirc;pastamba with the modern writers on this point, furnishes, I think, an additional argument that he belongs to the later Vedic schoolmen.</p>  
<p>In addition to this information regarding the relative position of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school in ancient Sanskrit literature, we possess some further statements as to the</p>

<p>part of India to which it belongs, and these, as it happens, are of great importance for fixing approximately the period in which the school arose. According to the Brahmanical tradition, which is supported by a hint contained in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra and by, information derivable from inscriptions and the actual state of things in modern India, the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas belong to Southern India and their founder probably was a native of or resided in the &Acirc;ndhra country. The existence of this tradition, which to the present day prevails among the learned Brahmans of Western India and Benares, may be substantiated by a passage from the above-mentioned commentary of the <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>avy&ucirc;ha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,which,</p>

<p>though written in barbarous Sanskrit, and of quite modern origin, possesses great interest, because its description of the geographical distribution of the Vedas and Vedic schools is not mentioned elsewhere. The verses from a work entitled Mah&acirc;r<I>n</I>ava, which are quoted there, state that the earth, i.e. India, is divided into two equal halves by the river Narmad&acirc; (Nerbudda). and that the school of &Acirc;pastamba prevails in the southern half (ver. 2). It is further alleged (ver. 6) that the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda of Tittiri and the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school are established in the &Acirc;ndhra country and other parts of the south and south-east up to the mouth of the God&acirc;var&icirc; (god&acirc;s&acirc;gara-&acirc;vadhi). According to the Mah&acirc;r<I>n</I>ava the latter river marks, therefore, the northern frontier of the territory occupied by the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas. which comprises the Mar&acirc;<I>th</I>a and K&acirc;<I>n</I>ara districts of the Bombay Presidency, the greater part of the Niz&acirc;m's dominions, Berar, and the Madras Presidency with the exception of the northern Sirk&acirc;rs and the western coast. This assertion agrees, on the whole, with the actual facts which have fallen under my observation. A great number of the De<I>s</I>astha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as in the N&acirc;sik, Pu<I>n</I>a, Ahmadnagar, S&acirc;t&acirc;r&acirc;, Shol&acirc;pur, and Kolh&acirc;pur districts, and of the K&acirc;<I>n</I>ar&acirc; or Kar<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>t</I>aka-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as in the Belg&acirc;m, Dh&acirc;rv&acirc;<I>d</I>, Kal&acirc;<I>d</I>gh&icirc;, and Karv&acirc;<I>d</I> collectorates, as well as a smaller number among the <I>K</I>ittap&acirc;vanas of the Ko&#7749;ka<I>n</I>a are &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas. Of the Niz&acirc;m's dominions and the Madras Presidency I possess no local knowledge. But I can say that I have met many followers of &Acirc;pastamba among the Teli&#7749;gana-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as settled in Bombay, and that the frequent occurrence of MSS. containing the S&ucirc;tras of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school in the Madras Presidency proves that the <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>a there must count many adherents. On the other hand, I have never met with any &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas among the ancient indigenous subdivisions of the Brahmanical community dwelling north of the Mar&acirc;<I>th</I>&acirc; country and north of the Narmad&acirc;. A few Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as of this school, no doubt, are scattered over Gu<I>g</I>ar&acirc;t and Central India, and others are found in the great places of</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>pilgrimage in Hindustan proper. The former mostly have immigrated during the last century, following the Mar&acirc;<I>th</I>&acirc; chieftains who conquered large portions of those countries, or have been imported in the present century by the Mar&acirc;<I>th</I>&acirc; rulers of Gwalior, Indor, and Baroda. The settlers in Benares, Mathur&acirc;, and other sacred cities also, have chiefly come in modern times, and not unfrequently live on the bounty of the Mar&acirc;<I>th</I>&acirc; princes. But all of them consider themselves and are considered by the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, who are indigenous in those districts and towns, as aliens, with whom intermarriage and commensality are not permitted. The indigenous sections of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as of Gu<I>g</I>ar&acirc;t, such as the N&acirc;garas, Khe<I>d</I>&acirc;vals, Bh&acirc;rgavas, Kapilas, and Mot&acirc;l&acirc;s, belong, if they are adherents of the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, to the M&acirc;dhyandina or K&acirc;<I>n</I>va schools of the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda. The same is the case with the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as of Ra<I>g</I>put&acirc;na, Hindustan, and the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ab. In Central India, too, the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda prevails; but, besides the two schools mentioned above, there are still some colonies of Maitr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;yas or M&acirc;navas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It seems, also, that the restriction of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school to the south of India, or rather to those subdivisions of the Brahmanical community which for a long time have been settled in the south and are generally considered as natives of the south, is not of recent date. For it is a significant fact that the numerous ancient landgrants which have been found all over India indicate exactly the same state of things. I am not aware that in any grant issued by a king of a northern dynasty to Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as who are natives of the northern half of India, an &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya is mentioned as donee. But among the southern landgrants there are several on which the name of the school appears. Thus in a <I>s</I>&acirc;sana of king Harihara of Vidy&acirc;nagara, dated Sakasa<I>m</I>vat 1317 or 1395 A.D., one of the recipients of the royal bounty is 'the learned Ananta D&icirc;kshita, son of R&acirc;mabha<I>t</I><I>t</I>a, chief</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the &Acirc;pastambya (read &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya) <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;, a scion of the Vasish<I>th</I>a gotra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' Further, the eastern <I>K</I>&acirc;lukya king Vi<I>g</I>ay&acirc;ditya II&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, who ruled, according to Dr. Fleet, from A-D. 799-843, presented a village to six students of the Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>i-s&ucirc;tra and to eighteen students of the &Acirc;pastamba, <i>recte</i> the &Acirc;pastamba-s&ucirc;tra. Again, in the abovementioned earlier grant of the Pallava king Nandivarman, there are forty-two students of the &Acirc;pastamba-s&ucirc;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> among the 108 sharers of the village of Udaya<I>k</I>andrama&#7749;galam. Finally, on an ancient set of plates written in the characters which usually are called cave-characters, and issued by the Pallava king Si<I>m</I>havarman II, we find among the donees five &Acirc;pastambh&icirc;ya Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, who, together with a Haira<I>n</I>yakesa, a V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneya, and a S&acirc;ma-ved&icirc;, received the village of Ma&#7749;gad&ucirc;r, in Ve&#7749;g&#335;r&acirc;sh<I>t</I>ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. This inscription is, to judge from the characters, thirteen to fourteen hundred years old, and on this account a very important witness for the early existence of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas in Southern India.</p>  
<p>Under the circumstances just mentioned, a casual remark made by &Acirc;pastamba, in describing the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas or funeral oblations, acquires considerable importance. He says (Dh. II, 7, 17, 17) that the custom of pouring water into the hands of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as invited to a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha prevails among the northerners, and he indicates thereby that he himself does not belong to the north of India. If this statement is taken together with the above-stated facts, which tend to show that the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas were and are restricted to the south of India, the most probable construction which can be put on it is that &Acirc;pastamba declares himself to be a southerner. There is yet another indication to the same effect contained in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. It has been pointed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>out above that the recension of the Taittir&icirc;ya &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka which &Acirc;pastamba recognises is that called the &Acirc;ndhra text or the version current in the &Acirc;ndhra country, by which term the districts in the south-east of India between the God&acirc;var&icirc; and the K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>&acirc; have to be understood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now it seems exceedingly improbable that a Vedic teacher would accept as authoritative any other version of a sacred work except that which was current in his native country. it would therefore follow, from the adoption of an &Acirc;ndhra text by &Acirc;pastamba, that he was born in that country, or, at least, had resided there so long as to have become naturalised in it. With respect to this conclusion it must also be kept in mind that the above-quoted passage from the Mah&acirc;r<I>n</I>ava particularly specifies the &Acirc;ndhra country (&acirc;ndhr&acirc;di) as the seat of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas. It may be that this is due to an accident. But it seems to me more probable that the author of the Mah&acirc;r<I>n</I>ava wished to mark the &Acirc;ndhra territory as the chief and perhaps as the original residence of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas.</p>  
<p>This discovery has, also, a most important bearing on the question of the antiquity of the school of &Acirc;pastamba. It fully confirms the result of the preceding enquiry, viz. that the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas are one of the later <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>as. For the south of India and the nations inhabiting it, such as Kali&#7749;gas, Dravi<I>d</I>as, Andhras, <I>K</I>olas, and P&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>yas, do not play any important part in the ancient Brahmanical traditions and in the earliest history of India, the centre of both of which lies in the north-west or at least north of the Vindhya range. Hitherto it has not been shown that the south and the southern nations are mentioned in any of the Vedic Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s. In the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and in the S&ucirc;tras they do occur, though they are named rarely and in a not complimentary manner. Thus the Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a gives the names of certain degraded, barbarous tribes, and among them that of the Andhras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, in whose country, as</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxviii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxviii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>has been shown, the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas probably originated. Again, Baudh&acirc;yana, in his Dharma-s&ucirc;tra I, i, quotes song verses in which it is said that he who visits the Kali&#7749;gas must purify himself by the performance of certain sacrifices in order to become fit for again associating with Aryans. The same author, also, mentions distinctive forbidden practices (&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ra) prevailing in the south (loc. cit.). Further, P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini's grammatical S&ucirc;tras and K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana's V&acirc;rttikas thereon contain rules regarding several words which presuppose an acquaintance with the south and the kingdoms which flourished there. Thus P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini, IV, 2, 98, teaches the formation of d&acirc;kshi<I>n</I>&acirc;tya in the sense of 'belonging to or living in the south or the Dekhan,' and a V&acirc;rttika of K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana on P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini, IV, 1, 175, states that the words <I>K</I>ola and P&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya are used as names of the princes ruling over the Kola and P&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya countries, which, as is known from history, were situated in the extreme south of India. The other southern nations and a fuller description of the south occur first in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. While an acquaintance with the south can thus be proved only by a few books belonging to the later stages of Vedic literature, several of the southern kingdoms are named already in the oldest historical documents. A<I>s</I>oka in his edicts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, which date from the second half of the third century B.C., calls the <I>K</I>olas, P&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>yas, and the Keralaputra or Ketalaputra his pratyantas (pra<I>k</I>ant&acirc;) or neighbours. The same monarch informs us also that he conquered the province of Kali&#7749;ga and annexed it to his kingdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and his remarks on the condition of the province show that it was thoroughly imbued with the Aryan civilisation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The same fact is attested still more clearly by the annals of the <I>K</I>eta king of Kali&#7749;ga, whose thirteenth year fell in the 165th year of the Maurya era, or about 150 B.C.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> The early</p>

<p>spread of the Aryan civilisation to the eastern coast-districts between the God&acirc;var&icirc; and the K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>&acirc; is proved by the inscriptions on the Bha<I>t</I><I>t</I>iprolu relic caskets, which probably belong to the period of 200 B.C.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Numerous inscriptions in the Buddhist caves of Western India&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, as well as coins, prove the existence during the last centuries before, and the first centuries after, the beginning of our era of a powerful empire of the Andhras, the capital of which was probably situated near the modern Amar&acirc;vati an the lower K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>&acirc;. The princes of the latter kingdom, though great patrons of the Buddhist monks, appear to have been Brahmanists or adherents of the ancient orthodox faith which is founded on the Vedas. For one of them is called Vedisiri (vedi<I>s</I>r&icirc;), 'he whose glory is the Vedi,' and another Ya<I>&ntilde;</I>asiri (ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>asr&icirc;), 'he whose glory is the sacrifice,' and a very remarkable inscription on the N&acirc;n&acirc;gh&acirc;t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> contains a curious catalogue of sacrificial fees paid to priests (dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;) for the performance of <I>S</I>rauta sacrifices. For the third and the later centuries of our era the information regarding Southern India becomes fuller and fuller. Very numerous inscriptions, the accounts of the Buddhist chroniclers of Ceylon, of the Greek geographers, and of the Chinese pilgrims, reveal the existence and give fragments, at least, of the history of many kingdoms in the south, and show that their civilisation was an advanced one, and did not differ materially from that of Northern India.</p>  
<p>There can be no doubt that the south of India has been conquered by the Aryans, and has been brought within the pale of Brahmanical civilisation much later than India north of the Vindhya range. During which century precisely that conquest took place, cannot be determined for the present. But it would seem that it happened a considerable time before the Vedic period came to an end, and it certainly was an accomplished fact, long before the</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xl"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xl</FONT></A></p>  
<p>authentic history of India begins, about 500 B.C., with the Persian conquest of the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ab and Sindh. It may be added that a not inconsiderable period must have elapsed after the conquest of the south, before the Aryan civilisation had so far taken root in the conquered territory, that, in its turn, it could become a centre of Brahmanical activity, and that it could produce new Vedic schools.</p>  
<p>These remarks will suffice to show that a Vedic <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>a which had its origin in the south, cannot rival in antiquity those whose seat is in the north, and that all southern schools must belong to a comparatively recent period of Vedic history. For this reason, and because the name of &Acirc;pastamba and of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas is not mentioned in any Vedic work, not even in a Kalpa-s&ucirc;tra, and its occurrence in the older grammatical books, written before the beginning of our era, is doubtful&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, it might be thought advisable to fix the terminus a quo for the composition of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya-s&ucirc;tras about or shortly before the beginning of the era, when the Brahmanist &Acirc;ndhra kings held the greater part of the south under their sway. It seems to me, however, that such a hypothesis is not tenable, as there are several points which indicate that the school and its writings possess a much higher antiquity. For, first, the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra contains a remarkable passage in which its author states that <I>S</I>vetaketu, one of the Vedic teachers who is mentioned in the <I>S</I>atapatha-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and in the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya Upanishad, belongs to the Avaras, to the men of later, i.e. of his own times. The passage referred to, Dh. I, 2, 5, 4-6, has been partly quoted above in order to show that &Acirc;pastamba laid no claim to the title <I>Ri</I>shi, or seer of revealed texts. It has been stated that according to S&ucirc;tra 4, 'No <I>Ri</I>shis are born among the Avaras, the men of later ages, on account of the prevailing transgression of the rules of studentship;' and that according to S&ucirc;tra 5,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xli"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xli</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> 'Some in their new birth become similar to <I>Ri</I>shis by their knowledge of the Veda (<I>s</I>rutarshi) through a residue of merit acquired in former existences.' In order to give an illustration of the latter case, the author adds in S&ucirc;tra 6, 'Like <I>S</I>vetaketu.' The natural, and in my opinion, the only admissible interpretation of these words is that &Acirc;pastamba considers <I>S</I>vetaketu to be one of the Avaras, who by virtue of a residue of merit became a <I>S</I>rutarshi. This is also the view of the commentator Haradatta, who, in elucidation of S&ucirc;tra 6, quotes the following passage from the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya Upanishad (VI, 1, 1-2):</p>  
<p>'1. Verily, there lived <I>S</I>vetaketu, a descendant of Aru<I>n</I>a. His father spake unto him, "O <I>S</I>vetaketu, dwell as a student (with a, teacher); for, verily, dear child, no one in our family must neglect the study of the Veda and become, as it were, a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a in name only."</p>  
<p>'Verily, he (<I>S</I>vetaketu) was initiated at the age of twelve years, and when twenty-four years old be had learned all the Vedas; he thought highly of himself and was vain of his learning and arrogant.'</p>  
<p>There can be no doubt that this is the person and the story referred to in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. For the fact which the Upanishad mentions, that <I>S</I>vetaketu learned all the Vedas in twelve years, while, the Sm<I>ri</I>tis declare forty-eight years to be necessary for the accomplishment of that task, makes &Acirc;pastamba's illustration intelligible and appropriate. A good deal more is told in the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya Upanishad about this <I>S</I>vetaketu, who is said to have been the son of Udd&acirc;laka and the grandson of Aru<I>n</I>a (&acirc;ru<I>n</I>eya). The same person is also frequently mentioned in the <I>S</I>atapatha-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. In one passage of the latter work, which has been translated by Professor Max M&uuml;ller&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, it is alleged that he was a contemporary of Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, the promulgator of the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, and of the learned king <I>G</I>anaka of Videha, who asked him about the meaning of the Agnihotra sacrifice, Now, as has been shown above, &Acirc;pastamba knew and quotes the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xlii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xlii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. The passage of the latter work, which he quotes, is even taken from the same book in which the story about <I>S</I>vetaketu and <I>G</I>anaka occurs. The fact, therefore, that &Acirc;pastamba places a teacher whom he must have considered as a contemporary of the promulgator of the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda among the Avaras, is highly interesting and of some importance for the history of Vedic literature. On the one hand it indicates that &Acirc;pastamba cannot have considered the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, such as it has been handed down in the schools of the <I>K</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>vas and M&acirc;dhyandinas, to belong to a remote antiquity. On the other hand it makes the inference which otherwise might be drawn from the southern origin of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school and from the non-occurrence: of its name in the early grammatical writings, viz. that its founder lived not long before the beginning of our era, extremely improbable. For even if the term Avara is not interpreted very strictly and allowed to mean not exactly a contemporary, but a person of comparatively recent times, it will not be possible to place between <I>S</I>vetaketu and &Acirc;pastamba a longer interval than, at the utmost, two or three hundred years. <I>S</I>vetaketu and Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya would accordingly, at the best, find their places in the fourth or fifth century B.C., and the <I>S</I>atapatha-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a as well as all other Vedic works, which narrate incidents from their lives, must have been composed or at least edited still later. Though little is known regarding the history of the Vedic texts, still it happens that we possess some information regarding the texts in question. For we know from a statement made by K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana in a V&acirc;rttika on P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini IV, 3, 105, and from Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ali's commentary on his words that the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a proclaimed by Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, i.e. the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, was considered to have been promulgated by one of the Ancients, in the times of these two writers, i.e. probably in the fourth and second centuries B.C.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xliii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xliii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>These considerations will show that it is necessary to allow for &Acirc;pastamba a much higher antiquity than the first century B.C.</p>  
<p>The same inference may also be drawn from another series of facts, viz. the peculiarities of the language of his S&ucirc;tras. The latter are very considerable and very remarkable. They may be classed under four heads. In the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya Dharma-s&ucirc;tra we have, first, archaic words and forms either occurring in other Vedic writings or formed according to the analogy of Vedic usage; secondly, ancient forms and words specially prescribed by P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini, which have not been traced except in &Acirc;pastamba's S&ucirc;tras; thirdly, words and forms which are both against Vedic usage and against P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini's rules, and which sometimes find their analogies in the ancient Prakrits; and fourthly, anomalies in the construction of sentences. To the first class belong, kravy&acirc;das, I, 7, 21, 15, carnivorous, formed according to the analogy of <I>ri</I><I>s</I>&acirc;das; the frequent use of the singular d&acirc;ra, e.g. II, 1, 1, 17-18, a wife, instead of the plural d&acirc;r&acirc;<I>h</I>; sal&acirc;v<I>ri</I>k&icirc;, I, 3, 10, 19, for s&acirc;lav<I>ri</I>k&icirc;; the substitution of <i>l</i> for <i>r</i> in ple&#7749;kha, I, 11, 31, 14; occasional</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xliv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xliv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>offences against the rules of internal and external Sandhi, e.g. in ag<I>ri</I>hyam&acirc;nak&acirc;ra<I>n</I>a<I>h</I>, I, 4, 12, 8; in skuptv&acirc;, I, 11, 31, 22, the irregular absolutive of skubh or of sku; in p&acirc;d&ucirc;na, I, 1, 2, 13; in adh&acirc;<I>s</I>ana<I>s</I>&acirc;yin, I, 19, 2, 21 and in sarvatopeta, I, 6, 19, 8; the neglect of the rule requiring v<I>ri</I>ddhi in the first syllable of the name Pushkaras&acirc;di, I, 10, 28, 1; the irregular instrumentals vidy&acirc;, I, 11, 30, 3, for vidyay&acirc;, and ni<I>h</I><I>s</I>reyas&acirc;, II, 7, 16, 2, for ni<I>h</I><I>s</I>reyasena; the nominatives dual &acirc;vam, I, 7, 20, 6, for &acirc;v&acirc;m, and kru<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>akrau<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a, I, 5, 17, 36 for &deg;krau<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>au; and the potentials in &icirc;ta, such as praksh&acirc;lay&icirc;ta, I, 1, 2, 28; abhipras&acirc;ray&icirc;ta, I, 25 6, 3, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>Among the words mentioned by P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini, but not traced except in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, may be enumerated the verb st<I>ri</I>h, to do damage, I, 11, 31, 9; the verb s<I>ri</I>&#7749;kh, to sneeze, from which s<I>ri</I>&#7749;kh&acirc;nik&acirc;, I, 5, 16, 14, and ni<I>h</I><I>s</I><I>ri</I>&#7749;khana, II, 2, 5, 9, are derived; and the noun ved&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya, I, 9, 24, 6; II, 4, 8, 5, in the sense of a student of the Veda. Words offending against rules given by P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini, without being either archaic or Prakritic, are e.g. sarv&acirc;nnin, I, 6, 18, 33, one who eats anybody's food, which, according to P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini V, 2, 9, should be sarv&acirc;nn&icirc;na; sarpa<I>s</I>&icirc;rshin, I, 5, 17, 39; annasa<I>m</I>skart<I>ri</I>, a cook, II, 3, 6, 16; dh&acirc;rmya, righteous, for dharmya, I, 2, 7, 21, and elsewhere; d&icirc;vit<I>ri</I>, a gambler, II, 10, 2, 5, 13, for devit<I>ri</I>, the very remarkable form pr&acirc;<I>s</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ti, I, 1, 4, 1, for pr&acirc;<I>s</I>n&acirc;ti, finds an analogy in the Vedic <I>s</I>nyaptre for <I>s</I>naptre&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and in Pali, pa<I>&ntilde;</I>ha from pra<I>s</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a for pra<I>s</I><I>n</I>a; and the curious compounds av&acirc;&#7749;gagra, I, 1, 2, 38, par&acirc;&#7749;g&acirc;v<I>ri</I>tta, II, 5, 10, 11, where the first parts show the forms of the nominative instead of the base, and pratis&ucirc;ryamatsya<I>h</I>, I, 3, 11, 31, which as a copulative compound is wrong, though not without analogies in Prakrit and in later Sanskrit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Prakrit languages, are, aviprakrami<I>n</I>a, II, 2, 5, 2, for aviprakrama<I>n</I>a, where an <i>a</i> standing in thesi has been changed to <i>i</i>; s&acirc;<I>m</I>v<I>ri</I>tti<I>h</I>, II, 3, 6, 13, s&acirc;<I>m</I>vartete, II, 5, 11, 20, and pary&acirc;nta, I, 3, 9, 21, and I, 3, 11, 33 (compare Mar&acirc;<I>th</I>i &acirc;<I>m</I>t for anta<I>h</I>), in each of which a standing before a nasal has been lengthened; a<I>n</I>ika, I, 6, 19, 1, the initial <i>a</i> of which stands for <I>ri</I>, if it really has the meaning of <I>ri</I><I>n</I>ika, as some commentators asserted; anulepa<I>n</I>a, I, 3, 11, 13; I, 11, 32, 5, with the Prakritic change of na to <I>n</I>a; vyupa<I>g</I>&acirc;va, I, 2, 8, 15, with va for pa; <I>ri</I>tve for <I>ri</I>tvye, where <i>y</i> seems to have been absorbed by the following <i>e</i>; apa<I>s</I><I>s</I>ay&icirc;ta, I, 11, 32, 16, for ap&acirc;<I>s</I>rayita, and bhat<I>ri</I>vyatikrama, I, 10, 28, 20, where <i>r</i> has been assimilated to the preceding, or has been lost before the following consonant. The irregularities in the construction are less frequent. But in two S&ucirc;tras, I, 3, 10, 2, and I, 3, 11, 31, some words which ought to stand in the locative case have the terminations of the nominative, and it looks as if the author had changed his mind about the construction which he meant to use. In a third passage II, 10, 26, 20, <I>s</I>i<I>s</I>na<I>k</I><I>kh</I>edana<I>m</I> sav<I>ri</I>sha<I>n</I>asya, the adjective which is intended to qualify the noun <I>s</I>i<I>s</I>na has been placed in the genitive case, though the noun has been made the first part of a compound.</p>  
<p>The occurrence of so many irregularities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in so small a treatise as the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra is, proves clearly that the author did not follow P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini's grammar, and makes it very unlikely that he knew it at all. If the anomalous forms used by &Acirc;pastamba all agreed with the usage of the other S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ras, known to us, it might be contended that, though acquainted with the rules of the great grammarian, he had elected to adopt by preference the language of the Vedic schools. But this is by no means the case. The majority of the irregular forms are peculiar to &Acirc;pastamba. As it is thus not probable that &Acirc;pastamba employed his peculiar expressions- in obedience to the tradition of the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_xlvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xlvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Vedic schools or of his particular school, he must have either been unacquainted with P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini or have considered his teachings of no great importance. In other words, he must either have lived earlier than P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini or before P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini's grammar had acquired general fame throughout India, and become the standard authority for Sanskrit authors. In either case so late a date as 150 B. C. or the first century B.C. would not fit. For Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ali's Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;shya furnishes abundant proof that at the time of its composition, in the second century B.C., P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini's grammar occupied a position similar to that which it holds now, and has held since the beginning of our era in the estimation of the learned of India. On linguistic grounds it seems to me &Acirc;pastamba cannot be placed later than the third century B.C., and if his statement regarding <I>S</I>vetaketu is taken into account, the lower limit for the composition of his S&ucirc;tras must be put further back by 150-200 years.</p>  
<p>But sufficient space has already been allotted to these attempts to assign a date to the founder of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school, the result of which, in the present state of our knowledge of the ancient history of India, must remain, I fear, less certain and less precise than is desirable. It now is necessary to say, in conclusion, a few words about the history of the text of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, and about its commentary, the U<I>g</I><I>g</I>val&acirc; V<I>ri</I>tti of Haradatta. The oldest writer with a known date who quotes the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya Dharma-s&ucirc;tra is Sa&#7749;kar&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, c. 800 A.D. Even somewhat earlier Kum&acirc;rila, c. 750, refers repeatedly to a law-book by &Acirc;pastamba&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. But it is improbable that he had our Dharma-s&ucirc;tra before him. For he says, p. 138, that &Acirc;pastamba expressly sanctions local usages, opposed to the teaching of the Vedas, for the natives of those districts where they had prevailed since ancient times. Now, that is just an opinion, which our Dharma-s&ucirc;tra declares to be wrong and refutes repeatedly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. As it seems</p>

<p>hazardous to impute to a man, like Kum&acirc;rila, ignorance or spite against &Acirc;pastamba, I am inclined to assume that the great M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>saka refers to some other work, attributed to &Acirc;pastamba, perhaps the metrical &Acirc;pastamba-sm<I>ri</I>ti which Apar&acirc;rka quotes very frequently&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Among the commentators on Sm<I>ri</I>tis the oldest, who quote the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, are Medh&acirc;tithi, the author of the Manubh&acirc;shya, and Vi<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ne<I>s</I>vara, who composed the Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc;, the well-known commentary on Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya's Dharma-<I>s</I>&acirc;stra during the reign of the <I>K</I>&acirc;lukya king Vikram&acirc;ditya VI, of <I>K</I>&acirc;lukya towards the end of the eleventh century. From that time downwards &Acirc;pastamba is quoted by almost every writer on law. But the whole text, such as it is given in my edition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, is vouched for only by the commentator Haradatta, who wrote his U<I>g</I><I>g</I>val&acirc; V<I>ri</I>tti, at the latest, in the fifteenth century A.D. or possibly 100 years earlier&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> . Haradatta was, however, not the first commentator of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. He frequently quotes the opinions of several predecessors whom he designates by the general expressions anya<I>h</I> or apara<I>h</I>, i.e. another (writer). The fact that the U<I>g</I><I>g</I>val&acirc; was preceded by earlier commentaries which protected the text from corruption, also speaks in favour of the authenticity of the latter, which is further attested by the close agreement of the Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>i Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, mentioned above.</p>  
<p>As regards the value of the U<I>g</I><I>g</I>val&acirc; for the explanation of &Acirc;pastamba's text, it certainly belongs to the best commentaries</p>

<p>existing. Haradatta possessed in the older V<I>ri</I>ttis abundant and good materials on which he could draw; he himself apparently was, well versed in Hindu law and in Sanskrit grammar, and distinguished by sobriety and freedom from that vanity which induces many Indian commentators to load their works with endless and useless quotations. His explanations, therefore, can mostly be followed without hesitation, and, even when they appear unacceptable, they deserve careful consideration.</p>

<p>The following letter, addressed to the late W. H. Morley, and published by him in his Digest of Indian Cases, 1850, may be of interest as connected with the first discovery of the &Acirc;pastamba-s&ucirc;tras:--</p>  
<p align="right"><i>9, Park Place, Oxford, July 29, 1849.</i></p>  
<p>MY DEAR MORLEY,--I have been looking again at the law literature, in order to write you a note on the sources of Manu. I have treated the subject fully in my introduction to the Veda, where I have given an outline of the different periods of Vaidik literature, and analysed the peculiarities in the style and language of each class of Vaidik works. A hat I consider to be the sources of the M&acirc;nava-dharma-<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, the so-called Laws of Manu, are the S&ucirc;tras. These are works which presuppose the development of the prose literature of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as (like the Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, Taittirtya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, &amp;c.) These Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, again, presuppose, not only the existence, but the collection and arrangement of the old hymns of the four Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s. The S&ucirc;tras are therefore later than both these classes of Vaidik works, but they must be considered as belonging to the Vaidik period of literature, not only on account of their intimate connection with Vaidik subjects, but also because they still exhibit the irregularities of the old Vaidik language. They form indeed the last branch of Vaidik literature; and it will perhaps be possible to fix some of these works chronologically, as they are contemporary with the first spreading of Buddhism in India.</p>  
<p>Again, in the whole of Vaidik literature there is no work written (like the M&acirc;nava-dharma-<I>s</I>&acirc;stra) in the regular epic <I>S</I>loka, and the continuous employment of this metre is a characteristic mark of post-Vaidik writings.</p>  
<p>One of the principal classes of S&ucirc;tras is known by the name of Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras, <A NAME="page_x"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. x</FONT></A> or rules of ceremonies. These are avowedly composed by human authors, while, according to Indian orthodox theology, both the hymns and Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as are to be considered as revelation. The S&ucirc;tras generally bear the name of their authors, like the S&ucirc;tras of &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana, K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana, &amp;c., or the name of the family to which the S&ucirc;tras belonged. The great number of these writings is to be accounted for by the fact that there was not one body of Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras binding on all Brahmanic families, but that different old families had each their own Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras. These works are still very frequent in our libraries, yet there is no doubt that many of them have been lost. S&ucirc;tras are quoted which do not exist in Europe, and the loss of some is acknowledged by the Brahmans themselves. There are, however, lists of the old Brahmanic families which were in possession of their own redaction of Vaidik hymns (Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s), of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, and of S&ucirc;tras. Some-of these families followed the Rig-veda, some the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, the S&acirc;ma-veda, and Atharva-veda; and thus the whole Vaidik literature becomes divided into four great classes of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and S&ucirc;tras, belonging to one or the other of the four principal Vedas.</p>  
<p>Now one of the families following the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda was that of the M&acirc;navas (cf. <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>avy&ucirc;ha). There can be no doubt that that family, too, had its own S&ucirc;tras. Quotations from M&acirc;nava-s&ucirc;tras are to be met with in commentaries on other S&ucirc;tras; and I have found, not long ago, a MS. which contains the text of the M&acirc;nava-<I>s</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras, though in a very fragmentary state. But these S&ucirc;tras, the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras, treat only of a certain branch of ceremonies connected with the great sacrifices. Complete S&ucirc;tra works are divided into three parts: 1. the first (<I>S</I>rauta), treating on the great sacrifices; 2. the second (G<I>ri</I>hya), treating on the Sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ras, or the purificatory sacraments; 3. the third, (S&acirc;may&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rika or Dharma-s&ucirc;tras), treating on temporal duties, customs, and punishments. The last two classes of S&ucirc;tras seem to be lost in the M&acirc;nava-s&ucirc;tra. This loss is. however, not so great with regard to tracing the sources of the M&acirc;nava-dharma-<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, because whenever we have an opportunity of comparing S&ucirc;tras belonging to different families, but following the same Veda, and treating on the same subjects, the differences appear to be very slight, and only refer to less important niceties of the ceremonial. In the absence, therefore, of the M&acirc;nava- s&acirc;may&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rika-s&ucirc;tras, I have taken another collection of S&ucirc;tras, equally belonging to the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, the S&ucirc;tras of &Acirc;pastamba. In his family we have not only a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, but also &Acirc;pastamba <I>S</I>rauta, G<I>ri</I>hya, and S&acirc;may&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rika-s&ucirc;tras. Now it is, of course, the third class of S&ucirc;tras, on temporal duties, which are most likely to contain the sources of the later metrical Codes of Law, written in the classical <I>S</I>loka. On a comparison of different subjects, such as the duties of a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin, a G<I>ri</I>hastha, laws of inheritance, duties of a king, forbidden fruit, &amp;c., I find that the S&ucirc;tras contain generally almost the same words which have been brought into verse by the compiler of the M&acirc;nava-dharma-s&ucirc;tra. <A NAME="page_xi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xi</FONT></A> I consider, therefore, the S&ucirc;tras as the principal source of the metrical Sm<I>ri</I>tis, such as the M&acirc;nava-dharma-<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya-dharma-<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, &amp;c., though there are also many other verses in these works which may be traced to different sources. They are paraphrases of verses of the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s, or of passages of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, often retaining the same old words and archaic constructions which were in the original. This is indeed acknowledged by the author of the M&acirc;nava-dharma-<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, when he says (B. II, v. 6), 'The roots of the Law are the whole Veda (Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s and Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as), the customs and traditions of those who knew the Veda (as laid down in the S&ucirc;tras), the conduct of good men, and one's own satisfaction.' The M&acirc;nava-dharma-<I>s</I>&acirc;stra may thus be considered as the last redaction of the laws of the M&acirc;navas. Quite different is the question as to the old Manu from whom the family probably derived its origin, and who is said to have been the author of some very characteristic hymns in the Rig-veda-sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;. He certainly cannot be considered as the author of a M&acirc;nava-dharma-s&ucirc;tra, nor is there even any reason to suppose the author of this work to have had the same name. It is evident that the author of the metrical Code of Laws speaks of the old Manu as of a person different from himself, when he says (B. X, v. 63), 'Not to kill, not to lie, not to steal, to keep the body clean, and to restrain the senses, this was the short law which Manu proclaimed amongst the four castes.'--Yours truly, M. M.</P>

Dr. Burnell, Tanjore Catalogue, p. 34, too, considers Baudh&acirc;yana to be older than &Acirc;pastamba, because his style is so much simpler. With this remark may be compared Dr. Winternitz's very true assertion that Baudh&acirc;yana's style resembles sometimes, especially in the discussion of disputed points, that of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as. On the other hand, Dr. R. G.

This may be true, but it must not be forgotten that every portion of Baudh&acirc;yana's S&ucirc;tras, which has been subjected to a critical enquiry, has turned out to be much interpolated and enlarged by later hands.</P>

Though I fully subscribe to the opinion, held by the most illustrious Sanskritists, that, in general, the existing Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as are not identical with the works designated by that title in Vedic works, still I cannot believe that they are altogether independent of the latter. Nor can I agree to the assertion that the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as known to us, one and all, are not older than the tenth or eleventh century A.D. That is inadmissible, because B&ecirc;r&ucirc;n&icirc; (India, I, 131) enumerates them as canonical books. And his frequent quotations from them prove that in 1030 A. D. they did not differ materially from those known to us (see Indian Antiquary, 19, 382 seqq.). Another important fact bearing on this point may be mentioned here, viz. that the poet B&acirc;<I>n</I>a, who wrote shortly after 600 A.D., in the S<I>r&icirc;</I>hatsha<I>k</I>arita, orders his Paur&acirc;<I>n</I>ika to recite the Pavanaprokta-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a, i.e. the V&acirc;yu-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a (Harsha<I>k</I>arita, p. 61, Calcutta ed.). Dr. Hall, the discoverer of the life of Harsha, read in his copy Yavanaprokta-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a, a title which, as he remarks, might suggest the idea that B&acirc;<I>n</I>a knew the Greek epic poetry. But a comparison of the excellent Ahmad&acirc;b&acirc;d and Benares Devan&acirc;gar&icirc; MSS. and of the Ka<I>s</I>m&icirc;r <I>S</I>&acirc;rad&acirc; copies shows that the correct reading is the one given above. The earlier history of the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as, which as yet is a mystery, will only be cleared up when a real history of the orthodox Hindu sects, especially of the <I>S</I>ivites and Vish<I>n</I>uites, has been written. It will, then, probably become apparent that the origin of these sects reaches back far beyond the rise of Buddhism and Jainism. It will also be proved <A NAME="page_xxxi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxi</FONT></A> that the orthodox sects used Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as as text books for popular readings, the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>ap&acirc;<I>th</I>ana of our days, and that some, at least, of the now existing Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as are the latest recensions of those mentioned in Vedic books.</P>

As regards the explanation of K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana's and Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ali's words, I side with Kaiya<I>t</I>a and Professor Goldst&uuml;cker. But I am unable to follow the latter in the inferences which he draws from the fact, that K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana and Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ali declare Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya and other sages to be as ancient as those whose Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and Kalpas are designated by the plural of adjectives formed by the addition of the affix in to the names of the promulgators. Though P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini asserts, IV, 3, 105, that only those Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as which are known by appellations like Bh&acirc;llavina<I>h</I>, Kaush&icirc;takina<I>h</I>, &amp;c, have been proclaimed by ancient sages, and though K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana and the author of the Great Commentary add that this rule does not hold good in the case of the work called Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalk&acirc;ni Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>&acirc;ni, it does not necessarily follow, as Professor Goldst&uuml;cker thinks, that an extraordinarily long interval lies between P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini and K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana-so long a period that what P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini considered to be recent had become ancient in K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana's time. Professor Weber has rightly objected to this reasoning. The difference between the statements of the two grammarians may have been caused by different traditions prevailing in different schools, or by an oversight on the part of P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini, which, as the scene of Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya's activity seems to have been Videha in eastern India, while P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini belonged to the extreme north-west, is not at all improbable. As regards the two dates, I place, following, with Professor Max M&uuml;ller, the native tradition, K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana in the fourth century B.C., and Pata<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ali, with Professors Goldst&uuml;cker, Kern, and Bh&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>arkar, between 178-140 B.C.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_80"></A><A HREF="sbe0202.htm#fr_80">xlvii:3</A> It seems not doubtful that Haradatta, the author of the U<I>g</I><I>g</I>val&acirc;, is the same person who wrote the An&acirc;kula V<I>ri</I>tti on the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, an explanation of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya G<I>ri</I>hya-mantras (see Burnell, Ind. Ant. I, 6), and the Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc; V<I>ri</I>tti on the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra of Gautama. From the occurrence in the latter work of Tamil words, added in explanation of Sanskrit expressions, it follows that Haradatta was a native of the south of India. I am not in a position to decide if our author also wrote the Padama<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ar&icirc; V<I>ri</I>tti on the K&acirc;<I>s</I>ik&acirc; of V&acirc;mana and <I>G</I>ay&acirc;ditya. This is Professor Aufrecht's opinion, Catalogus Catalogorum, p. 715 seq. See also my remarks in the Introd. to the second ed., p. viii.</P>
