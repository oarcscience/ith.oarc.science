### CHAPTER IV.

1\. A householder shall take a wife (of) equal (caste), who has not
belonged to another man and is younger (than himself). <span
id="fr_911"></span>[1](#fn_910)

2\. A marriage (may be contracted) between persons who have not the same
Pravaras, <span id="fr_912"></span>[2](#fn_911)

3\. (And) who are not related within six degrees on the father's
side, <span id="fr_913"></span>[3](#fn_912)

4\. Or on the side of the begetter, <span
id="fr_914"></span>[4](#fn_913)

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

5\. (Nor) within four degrees on the mothers side. <span
id="fr_915"></span>[5](#fn_914)

6\. (If the father) gives (his daughter) dressed (in two garments) and
decked with ornaments to a person possessing (sacred) learning, of
virtuous conduct, who has relatives and a (good) disposition, (that is
a) Brâhma (wedding). <span id="fr_916"></span>[6](#fn_915)

7\. At the Prâ*g*âpatya (wedding) the marriage formula is, 'Fulfil ye
the law conjointly.' <span id="fr_917"></span>[7](#fn_916)

8\. At the Ârsha (wedding the bridegroom) shall present a cow and a bull
to him who has (authority over) the maiden. <span
id="fr_918"></span>[8](#fn_917)

9\. (If the bride) is given, decked with ornaments. to a priest at the
altar, that is a Daiva wedding. <span id="fr_919"></span>[9](#fn_918)

10\. The spontaneous union with a willing (maiden is called) a Gândharva
wedding. <span id="fr_920"></span>[10](#fn_919)

11\. If those who have (authority over) a female are propitiated by
money, (that is) an Âsura wedding. <span
id="fr_921"></span>[11](#fn_920)

12\. (If the bride) is taken by force, (that is) a Râkshasa
wedding. <span id="fr_922"></span>[12](#fn_921)

13\. If (a man) embraces a female deprived of consciousness, (that is) a
Pai*s*â*k*a wedding. <span id="fr_923"></span>[13](#fn_922)

14\. The first four (rites) are lawful; <span
id="fr_924"></span>[14](#fn_923)

15\. Some say, (the first) six. <span id="fr_925"></span>[15](#fn_924)

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

16\. (Children) born in the regular order of wives of the next, second
or third lower castes (become) Savar*n*as, Ambash*th*as, Ugras,
Nishâdas, Daushyantas or Pâra*s*avas. <span
id="fr_926"></span>[16](#fn_925)

17\. (Children born) in the inverted order (of wives of higher castes
become) Sûtas, Mâgadhas, Âyogavas, Kshatt*ri*s, Vaidehakas or
*K*a*nd*âlas. <span id="fr_927"></span>[17](#fn_926)

18\. Some declare, that a woman of the Brâhma*n*a caste has born
successively to (husbands of) the (four) castes, sons (who are)
Brâhma*n*as, Sûtas, Mâgadhas or *K*a*nd*âlas; <span
id="fr_928"></span>[18](#fn_927)

19\. (And that) a woman of the Kshatriya caste (has born) to the same,
Mûrdhâvasiktas, Kshatriyas, Dhîvaras, Pulkasas;

20\. Further, a woman of the Vai*s*ya caste to the same,
Bh*rig*yaka*nth*as, Mâhishyas, Vai*s*yas, and Vaidehas;

21\. (And) a woman of the *S*ûdra caste to the same, Pâra*s*avas,
Yavanas, *K*ara*n*as, and *S*ûdras.

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

22\. In the seventh (generation men obtain) a change of caste, either
being raised to a higher one or being degraded to a lower one. <span
id="fr_929"></span>[22](#fn_928)

23\. The venerable teacher declares (that this happens) in the fifth
(generation). <span id="fr_930"></span>[23](#fn_929)

24\. And (the same rule applies) to those born (from parents of
different classes that are) intermediate between (two of the castes
originally) created (by Brahman). <span id="fr_931"></span>[24](#fn_930)

25\. But those born in the inverse order (from fathers of a lower and
mothers of a higher caste stand) outside (the pale of) the sacred
law, <span id="fr_932"></span>[25](#fn_931)

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

26\. As well as (those born in the regular order) from a female of the
*S*ûdra caste. <span id="fr_933"></span>[26](#fn_932)

27\. But he whom a *S*ûdra (begets) on a female of unequal caste shall
be treated like an outcast. <span id="fr_934"></span>[27](#fn_933)

28\. The last (named, the Ka*nd*âla), is the foulest. <span
id="fr_935"></span>[28](#fn_934)

29\. Virtuous sons (born of wives of equal caste) and wedded according
to approved rites sanctify (their father's family).

30\. (A son born of a wife married) according to the Ârsha rite (saves)
three ancestors (from hell), <span id="fr_936"></span>[30](#fn_935)

31\. (A son born of a wife married) according to the Daiva rite
ten, <span id="fr_937"></span>[31](#fn_936)

32\. (A son born of a wife married) according to the Prâ*g*âpatya rite,
also ten. <span id="fr_938"></span>[32](#fn_937)

33\. (But) the son of a wife married according to the Brâhma rite
(saves) ten ancestors, ten descendants, and himself. <span
id="fr_939"></span>[33](#fn_938)

<span id="fn_924"></span>[197:15](sbe0268.htm#fr_925) Manu III, 23.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[198:16](sbe0268.htm#fr_926) I.e. from a
Brâhma*n*a and a Kshatriyâ springs a Savar*n*a, from a Brâhma*n*a and a
Vai*s*yâ a Nishâda, from a Brâhma*n*a and a *S*ûdrâ a Pâra*s*ava, from a
Kshatriya and a Vai*s*yâ an Ambash*th*a, and from a Kshatriya and a
*S*ûdrâ a Daushyanta, from a Vai*s*ya and a *S*ûdrâ an Ugra. Compare for
this and the following five Sûtras Manu X, 6-18; Yâ*gñ*. I, 91-95.

<span id="fn_926"></span>[198:17](sbe0268.htm#fr_927) I.e. from a
Kshatriya and a Brâhma*n*î springs a Sûta, from a Vai*s*ya and a
Kshatriya a Mâgadha, from a *S*ûdra and a Vai*s*yâ an Âyogava, from a
Vai*s*ya and a Brâhma*n*î a Kshatt*ri*, from a *S*ûdra and a Kshatriyâ a
Vaidehaka, from a *S*ûdra and a Brâhma*n*î a Ka*nd*âla.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[198:18](sbe0268.htm#fr_928) The words 'Some
declare' stand only at the end of Sûtra 21. But Haradatta rightly
declares that they refer to all the four Sûtras. The proof for the
correctness of his interpretation lies in the use of the form
a*g*î*g*anat, which refers to each of the Sûtras. The four Sûtras are,
however, probably spurious, as Sûtra 28 refers back to Sûtra 17 by
calling the Ka*nd*âla 'the last (named).'

<span id="fn_928"></span>[199:22](sbe0268.htm#fr_929) Âpastamba II, 5,
11, 10-11. 'That is as follows: If a Savar*n*â female, born of the
Kshatriya wife of a Brâhma*n*a, is married to a Brâhma*n*a, and her
female descendants down to the seventh likewise, then the offspring
which that seventh female descendant bears to her Brâhma*n*a husband is
equal in caste to a Brâhma*n*a. In like manner, if a Savar*n*a male, the
son of a Brâhma*n*a and of his Kshatriya wife, again marries a Kshatriya
wife and his male descendants down to the seventh likewise, then the
offspring of that seventh male descendant is equal in caste to a
Kshatriya. The same principle must be applied to the offspring of
Kshatriyas and wives of the Vai*s*ya caste as well as to Vai*s*yas and
wives of the *S*ûdra caste.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[199:23](sbe0268.htm#fr_930) '(The venerable)
teacher opines that the change of caste takes place in the fifth
generation. They declare that the plural may be used to denote one
teacher. This Sûtra refers to (cases of extraordinary merit acquired
through) virtuous conduct and study of the Veda.'--Haradatta. It is
clear that in this case Haradatta, too, has seen that the word
â*k*âryâ*h* has another force than the more common eke; see above, note
to III, 36.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[199:24](sbe0268.htm#fr_931) 'That is as
follows: If the daughter of a Savar*n*a, born of a wife of the
Ambash*th*a caste, is married again to a Savar*n*a, and her female
descendants down to the seventh likewise, then the offspring of that
seventh female descendant, begotten by a Savar*n*a husband, is equal in
caste to a Savar*n*a.'--Haradatta. Regarding the birth of the four
castes from Brahman, see Rig-veda X, 90, 12.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[199:25](sbe0268.htm#fr_932) Manu X, 41, 67-68.

<span id="fn_932"></span>[200:26](sbe0268.htm#fr_933) Manu X, 68.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[200:27](sbe0268.htm#fr_934) '"Shall be treated
like an outcast," i.e. one must avoid to look at him, &c., just as in
the case of an outcast.'--Haradatta.
