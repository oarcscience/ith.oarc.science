### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 10, KHA*ND*A 27.

1\. If (adulteresses) have performed (the prescribed penance), they are
to be treated as before (their fault). For the connection (of husband
and wife) takes place through the law.

2\. (A husband) shall not make over his (wife), who occupies the
position of a 'gentilis,' to others (than to his 'gentiles'), in order
to cause children to be begot for himself. <span

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

3\. For they declare, that a bride is given to the family (of her
husband, and not to the husband alone).

4\. That is (at present) forbidden on account of the weakness of (men's)
senses. <span id="fr_775"></span>[4](#fn_774)

5\. The hand (of a gentilis is considered in law to be) that of a
stranger, and so is (that of any other person except the husband).

6\. If the (marriage vow) is transgressed, both (husband and wife)
certainly go to hell.

7\. The reward (in the next world) resulting from obeying the
restrictions of the law is preferable to offspring obtained in this
manner (by means of Niyoga).

8\. A man of one of the first three castes (who commits adultery) with a
woman of the *S*ûdra caste shall be banished.

9\. A *S*ûdra (who commits adultery) with a woman of one of the first
three castes shall suffer capital punishment. <span
id="fr_776"></span>[9](#fn_775)

10\. And he shall emaciate a woman who has committed adultery with a
(*S*ûdra, by making her undergo penances and fasts, in case she had no
child).

11\. They declare, that (a Brâhma*n*a) who has <span
id="fr_777"></span>[11](#fn_776)

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

once committed adultery with a married woman of equal class, she perform
one-fourth of the penance prescribed for an outcast.

12\. In like manner for every repetition (of the crime), one-fourth of
the penance (must be added).

13\. (If the offence be committed) for the fourth time, the whole
(penance of twelve years must be performed).

14\. The tongue of a *S*ûdra who speaks evil of a virtuous person,
belonging to one of the first three castes, shall be cut out.

15\. A *S*ûdra who assumes a position equal (to that of a member of one
of the first three castes), in conversation, on the road, on a couch, in
sitting (and on similar occasions), shall be flogged. <span
id="fr_778"></span>[15](#fn_777)

16\. In case (a *S*ûdra) commits homicide or theft, appropriates land
(or commits similar heinous crimes), his property shall be confiscated
and he himself shall suffer capital punishment.

17\. But if these (offences be committed) by a Brâhma*n*a, he shall be
made blind (by tying a cloth over his eyes). <span
id="fr_779"></span>[17](#fn_778)

18\. He shall keep in secret confinement him who violates the rules (of
his caste or order), or any other sinner, until (he promises) amendment.

19\. If he does not amend, he shall be banished.

20\. A spiritual teacher, an officiating priest, a <span
id="fr_780"></span>[20](#fn_779)

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Snâtaka, and a prince shall be able to protect
(a criminal from punishment by their intercession), except in case of a
capital offence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_773"></span>[165:2](sbe0262.htm#fr_774) **27**. This Sûtra
refers to the begetting of a Kshetra*g*a son, and gives the usual rule,
that only the Sagotras in the order of the grade of relationship, a
brother-in-law, a Sapi*nd*a, &c., shall be employed for this purpose.

<span id="fn_774"></span>[166:4](sbe0262.htm#fr_775) 'For now-a-days the
senses of men are and therefore the peculiar (law formerly) in force
regarding gentiles is no longer, lest husbands should be set aside under
the pretended sanction of the *S*âstras.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[166:9](sbe0262.htm#fr_776) Manu VIII, 374;
Yâ*gñ*. II, 286. According to Haradatta, this refers to a *S*ûdra
servant who seduces a woman committed to his charge. In other cases the
punishment prescribed, II, 10, 26,10, is to take effect. The same
opinion is expressed by Gautama.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[166:11](sbe0262.htm#fr_777) This refers to the
wife of a *S*rotriya, as Haradatta states according to Gautama. The
penance is three years' chastity.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[167:15](sbe0262.htm#fr_778) In conversation,
i.e. addressing Âryas familiarly, with tvam, thou,' &c.

<span id="fn_778"></span>[167:17](sbe0262.htm#fr_779) Haradatta states
expressly that the eyes of a Brâhma*n*a must not be put out by any sharp
instrument. He should be kept blindfold all his life.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[167:20](sbe0262.htm#fr_780) The intercession
is to take effect in this manner: that mutilation is commuted to a fine,
a fine to a flogging, a flogging to a reprimand.'--Haradatta.
