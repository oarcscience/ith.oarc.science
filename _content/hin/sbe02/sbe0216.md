### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 4, KHA*ND*A 13.

1\. The oblation to the gods accompanied by the exclamation Svâhâ, which
may consist even of a piece of wood only; the offering to the Manes
accompanied by the exclamation Svadhâ, which may consist even of a
vessel with water only; the daily recitation. <span
id="fr_312"></span>[1](#fn_311)

2\. Respect must be shown to those who are superior by caste, <span
id="fr_313"></span>[2](#fn_312)

3\. And also to (persons of the same caste who are) venerable (on
account of learning, virtue, and the like).

4\. A man elated (with success) becomes proud, a proud man transgresses
the law, but through the transgression of the law hell indeed (becomes
his portion).

5\. It has not been declared, that orders (may be addressed by the
teacher) to a pupil who has returned home. <span
id="fr_314"></span>[5](#fn_313)

6\. The syllable 'Om' is the door of heaven. <span
id="fr_315"></span>[6](#fn_314)

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Therefore he who is about to study the Veda,
shall begin (his lesson) by (pronouncing) it.

7\. If he has spoken anything else (than what refers to the lesson, he
shall resume his reading by repeating the word 'Om'). Thus the Veda is
separated from profane speech.

8\. And at sacrifices the orders (given to the priests) are headed by
this word.

9\. And in common life, at the occasion of ceremonies performed for the
sake of welfare, the sentences shall be headed by this word, as, for
instance, '(Om) an auspicious day,' '(Om) welfare,' '(Om)
prosperity.' <span id="fr_316"></span>[9](#fn_315)

10\. Without a vow of obedience (a pupil) shall not study (nor a teacher
teach) a difficult (new book) with the exception of (the texts called)
Tri*h*srâva*n*a and Tr.ihsahava*k*ana. <span
id="fr_317"></span>[10](#fn_316)

11\. Hârita declares, that the (whole) Veda must be studied under a vow
of obedience until there is no doubt (regarding it in the mind of the
pupil). <span id="fr_318"></span>[11](#fn_317)

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

12\. No obedience is due (to the teacher for teaching) works which do
not belong to the Veda.

13\. (A student) shall embrace the feet of a person, who teaches him at
the request of his (regular teacher), as long as the instruction
lasts. <span id="fr_319"></span>[13](#fn_318)

14\. Some (declare, that he shall also) always, (if the substitute is) a
worthy person. <span id="fr_320"></span>[14](#fn_319)

15\. But obedience (as towards the teacher) is not required (to be shown
towards such a person).

16\. And (pupils) older (than their teacher need not show him
obedience). <span id="fr_321"></span>[16](#fn_320)

17\. If (two persons) teach each other mutually (different redactions
of) the Veda, obedience (towards each other) is not ordained for them.

18\. (For) the (wise) say, 'The Veda-knowledge (of either of them)
grows.'

19\. *S*vetaketu declares, 'He who desires to study more, after having
settled (as a householder), shall dwell two months every year, with
collected mind, in the house of his teacher,'

20\. (And he adds), 'For by this means I studied a larger part of the
Veda than before, (during my studentship.)'

21\. That is forbidden by the *S*âstras.

22\. For after the student has settled as a householder, he is ordered
by the Veda, to perform the daily rites,

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_311"></span>[48:1](sbe0216.htm#fr_312) **13**. Taitt. Âr.
II, 10, 2 and 3, and *S*atapatha-br. loc. cit. 2. Haradatta observes,
that some consider the Devaya*gñ*a, mentioned in the Sûtra, to be
different from the Vai*s*vadeva, but that he holds it to be the same.
Further he mentions, that some prescribe this Vai*s*vadeva to be
performed even if one has nothing to eat.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[48:2](sbe0216.htm#fr_313) 'Namely, by allowing
them to walk in front on the road and by giving them perfumed garlands
and the like at festive occasions.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[48:5](sbe0216.htm#fr_314) Haradatta gives as
an example the order to fetch water, and adds that a voluntary act on a
former pupil's part ought not to be forbidden.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[48:6](sbe0216.htm#fr_315) Compare also Taitt.
Âr. I, 2, 4, and Manu II, 74.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[49:9](sbe0216.htm#fr_316) The example given in
the Sûtra is that of the Pu*n*yâhavâ*k*ana, which precedes every
G*ri*hya ceremony, and at which the sacrificer requests a number of
invited Brâhma*n*as to wish him success. The complete sentences are, The
sacrificer: O*m* karma*n*a*h* pu*n*yâham bhavanto bruvantviti, 'Om, wish
that the day may be auspicious for the performance of the ceremony.' The
Brâhma*n*as: Om pu*n*yâha*m* karma*n*a itî, 'Om, may the day be
auspicious for the ceremony.' In the same manner the Brâhma*n*as
afterwards wish 'welfare,' svasti, 'prosperity,' v*ri*ddhi, to the
sacrificer.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[49:10](sbe0216.htm#fr_317) Manu II, 112.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[49:11](sbe0216.htm#fr_318) The meaning of
Hârita is, that the vow of obedience is required for the Tri*h*srâva*n*a
and Tr.ihsahava*k*ana, which Âpastamba exempted in the preceding Sûtra.
It follows from this rule that the Aṅgas or works explanatory of the
Veda need not be studied under a vow of obedience.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[50:13](sbe0216.htm#fr_319) This rule is a
Supplement to I, 2, 7, 29.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[50:14](sbe0216.htm#fr_320) '"A worthy person,"
i.e. on account of his learning, or character.'-- Haradatta.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[50:16](sbe0216.htm#fr_321) 'According to some,
this rule refers only to the time after instruction has been completed;
according to others, to the time of studentship.'--Haradatta. But see
Manu II, 151 seq.
