<P><A NAME="fn_244"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_245">32:1</A> <b>9</b>. The Up&acirc;karma is the ceremony which is performed every year at the beginning of the course of study. It is in fact the solemn opening of the Brahmanic term. 'Because &Acirc;pastamba uses the word evening (i.e. first part of the night) it is not sinful to study later in the night.'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 95; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 142, 143; Weber, Ind. Stud. X. 130 and 134.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_245"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_246">33:2</A> The term lasts therefore for five months; (i.e. latter half of, Sr&acirc;va<I>n</I>a, Bh&acirc;rapada, &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina, K&acirc;rttika, M&acirc;rgas&icirc;rsha, and the first half of Pausha.) The Rohin&icirc;-day of Pausha is meant.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_246"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_247">33:3</A> 'According to this latter opinion the Up&acirc;karma should be performed on the full moon of Bh&acirc;drapada, as has been taught in another work (Manu IV, 95); the (time of the) Utsargana, (the solemn closing of the term) should be advanced; and after the Utsargana has been performed, one may study the Veda during the light nights of each month until the full moon of Sr&acirc;va<I>n</I>a, in order to fix in one's mind the part learned already; and in the dark fortnight of each month one may study the Ved&acirc;&#7749;gas, i.e. grammar and the rest (Manu IV, 98). On the full moon of Sr&acirc;va<I>n</I>a the Up&acirc;karma should be performed once more, and that part of the Veda should be studied which has not yet been learned.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_247"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_248">33:4</A> Nigarn&acirc;h, 'high-roads,' are squares and the like.--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_248"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_249">33:6</A> The Samy&acirc; is either the pin in the bullock's yoke or the round stick, about a foot and a half in length, which is used for the preparation of the Vedi. Manu IV, 116; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 148.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_249"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_250">33:8</A> 'Nor anywhere near it within the throw of a Samyi.' This must be understood from. S&ucirc;tra 6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_250"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_251">34:9</A> Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 148.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_251"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_252">34:13</A> The last part of the S&ucirc;tra may also be interpreted: 'Thus she will be blessed with children.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_252"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_253">34:14</A> Manu IV, 108; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 148.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_253"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_254">34:18</A> Haradatta explains B&acirc;hya, 'outcasts,' by 'robbers, such as Ugras and Nish&acirc;das.' But, I think, it means simply such outcasts as live in the forest or outside the village in the V&acirc;d&icirc;, like the Dhers, Mah&acirc;rs, M&acirc;ngs of the present day. Most of these tribes however, are or were given to thieving. See Kull&ucirc;ka on Manu X, 2 9, and the Petersburg Dict. s. v.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_256"></A><A HREF="sbe0212.htm#fr_257">35:27</A> Manu IV, 120; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 151.</P>
