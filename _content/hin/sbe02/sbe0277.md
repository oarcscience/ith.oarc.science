### CHAPTER XIII.

1\. In disputed cases the truth shall be established by means of
witnesses. <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1](#fn_1193)

2\. The (latter) shall be many, faultless as regards the performance of
their duties, worthy to be trusted by the king, and free from affection
for, or hatred against either (party). <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[2](#fn_1194)

3\. (They may be) *S*ûdras even. <span id="fr_1196"></span>[3](#fn_1195)

4\. But a Brâhma*n*a must not be forced (to give evidence) at the word
of a non-Brâhma*n*a, except if he is mentioned (in the plaint). <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[4](#fn_1196)

5\. (Witnesses) shall not speak singly or without being asked, <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[5](#fn_1197)

6\. And if, (being asked,) they do not answer, they are guilty of a
crime. <span id="fr_1199"></span>[6](#fn_1198)

7\. Heaven is their reward, if they speak the <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[7](#fn_1199)

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

truth; in the contrary case hell (will be their portion).

8\. (Persons) not mentioned (in the plaint), must also give evidence.

9\. No objection (can be raised against witnesses) in a case of
(criminal) hurt, <span id="fr_1201"></span>[9](#fn_1200)

10\. Nor if they have spoken inadvertently. <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[10](#fn_1201)

11\. If the sacred law or the rules (referring to worldly matters) are
violated,. the guilt (falls) on the witnesses, the assessors, the king,
and on the offender. <span id="fr_1203"></span>[11](#fn_1202)

12\. Some (declare, that the witnesses) shall be charged on oath to
speak the truth. <span id="fr_1204"></span>[12](#fn_1203)

13\. In the case of others than Brâhma*n*as that (oath shall be sworn)
in the presence of the gods, of the king, and of Brâhma*n*as.

14\. By false evidence concerning small cattle a witness kills
ten, <span id="fr_1205"></span>[14](#fn_1204)

15\. (By false evidence) regarding cows, horses, men, or land, in each
succeeding case ten times as many (as in the one mentioned before),}

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

16\. Or (by false evidence) regarding land the whole (human race).

17\. Hell (is the punishment) for a theft of land.

18\. (By false evidence) concerning water (he incurs) the same (guilt)
as (for an untruth) about land,

19\. Likewise (by false evidence) regarding (criminal) intercourse.

20\. (By false evidence) regarding honey or clarified butter (he incurs)
the same (guilt) as (by an untruth) about small cattle,

21\. (By false evidence) about clothes, gold, grain, and the Veda, the
same as (by an untruth) about kine,

22\. (And by false evidence) regarding a carriage (or a beast of burden)
the same as (by an untruth) about horses.

23\. A witness must be reprimanded and punished for speaking an
untruth. <span id="fr_1206"></span>[23](#fn_1205)

24\. No guilt is incurred by giving false evidence, in case the life (of
a man) depends thereon. <span id="fr_1207"></span>[24](#fn_1206)

25\. But (this. rule does) not (hold good) if the life of a very wicked
(man depends on the evidence of a witness).

26\. The king, or the judge, or a Brâhma*n*a learned in the *S*âstras
(shall examine the witnesses). <span id="fr_1208"></span>[26](#fn_1207)

27\. (The litigant) shall humbly go to seek the judge. <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[27](#fn_1208)

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

28\. If (the defendant) is unable to answer (the plaint) at once, (the
judge) may wait for a year. <span id="fr_1210"></span>[28](#fn_1209)

29\. But (in an action) concerning kine, draught oxen, women, or the
procreation (of offspring), the defendant (shall answer)
immediately, <span id="fr_1211"></span>[29](#fn_1210)

30\. Likewise in a case that will suffer by delay.

31\. To speak the truth before the judge is more important than all
(other) duties.

I.e. *S*ûdras endowed with the qualities mentioned above.

<span id="fn_1196"></span>[246:4](sbe0277.htm#fr_1197) Manu VIII, 65. 'A
Brâhma*n*a means here a *S*rotriya. If a man other than a Brâhma*n*a
says: "This Brâhma*n*a is a witness of this fact," then the (*S*rotriya)
shall not be forced to become, i.e. not be taken as a witness, provided
he has not been mentioned, i.e. he has not been entered in the written
plaint (as one of the witnesses). But if he has been entered in the
plaint, he certainly becomes a witness.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[246:5](sbe0277.htm#fr_1198) Manu VIII, 79;
Macnaghten, Mitâksharâ VI, 1, 21. In the Mitâksharâ the Sûtra is read
nâsamavetâ*h* p*ri*sh*t*â*h* prabrûyu*h*, 'witnesses need not answer if
they are examined singly.' Mitrami*s*ra in the Vîramitrodaya says that
Haradatta's reading of the text is the same, and that his explanation
does not agree with it.

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[246:6](sbe0277.htm#fr_1199) Manu VIII, 107;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 76-77.

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[246:7](sbe0277.htm#fr_1200) Âpastamba II, 11,
29, 9-10.

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[247:9](sbe0277.htm#fr_1201) Manu VIII, 72;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 72.

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[247:10](sbe0277.htm#fr_1202) 'Negligence,
i.e. inadvertence. If anything has been spoken at random by a witness in
a conversation referring to something else (than the case), no blame
must be thrown on him for that reason.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1202"></span>[247:11](sbe0277.htm#fr_1203) Manu VIII, 18.
The translation follows Haradatta. Perhaps it would, however, be as well
to take dharmatantra, 'the sacred law and the rules referring to worldly
matters,' as a Tatpurusha, and to translate, 'If there is a miscarriage
of justice, the guilt,' &c.

<span id="fn_1203"></span>[247:12](sbe0277.htm#fr_1204)-13. Âpastamba
II, 11, 29, 7.

<span id="fn_1204"></span>[247:14](sbe0277.htm#fr_1205)-22. Manu VIII,
98-100. 'By speaking an untruth regarding them, the witness kills ten.
Ten what? Even ten (of that kind) regarding which he has lied. His guilt
is as great as if he actually killed ten of them, and the punishment.
(is the same). 'Equal penances must also be prescribed for both
cases.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1205"></span>[248:23](sbe0277.htm#fr_1206) Manu VIII,
119-123; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 81. 'Yâpya*h* (literally "must be turned
out") means "must be reprimanded" in the presence of the whole audience,
lest anybody have intercourse with him.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[248:24](sbe0277.htm#fr_1207)-25. Manu VIII,
104-105; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 83.

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[248:26](sbe0277.htm#fr_1208) Manu VIII, 8-9,
79; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 1, 3, 73.

<span id="fn_1208"></span>[248:27](sbe0277.htm#fr_1209) Manu VIII, 43.
The meaning of the Sûtra is that the judge shall not promote litigation,
and incite people to institute suits. If litigants do not humbly appear
before him, he is not to send for them.

<span id="fn_1209"></span>[249:28](sbe0277.htm#fr_1210) See also Nârada
I, 38, 41.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[249:29](sbe0277.htm#fr_1211) Yâ*gñ*avalkya
II, 12. Haradatta explains pra*g*anana, 'the procreation (of
offspring),' to mean 'marriage.'
