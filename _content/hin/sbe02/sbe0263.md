### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 11, KHA*ND*A 28.

1\. If a person who has taken (a lease of) land (for cultivation) does

that ought to have grown. <span id="fr_781"></span>[1](#fn_780)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_780"></span>[168:1](sbe0263.htm#fr_781) **28**. This Sûtra
shows that the system of leasing land against a certain share of the
crops, which now prevails generally in Native States, and is not
uncommon in private contracts on British territory, was in force in
Âpastamba's times.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[168:2](sbe0263.htm#fr_782) See Colebrooke,
Digest, Book III, Text lxviii, for this Sûtra and the following two.
Another commentator, quoted by Haradatta, connects this Sûtra with the
preceding, and refers it to a poor lessee of land, who cannot pay the
value of the crop which was lost through his negligence. A third
explanation refers the Sûtra to a cultivator who neglects to till his
land. *G*agannâtha's authorities, the *K*intâma*n*i and Ratnâkara, agree
with Haradatta's first explanation.
