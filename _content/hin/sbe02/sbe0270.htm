<P><A NAME="fn_977"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_978">207:3</A> 'Their blood relations, i.e. paternal and maternal uncles and the rest; elders, i.e. elder brothers; persons venerable on account of their learning, i.e. the teacher who has initiated him (&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya), the teacher who has instructed him (up&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya), and the rest.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_978"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_979">208:4</A> &Acirc;pastamba I, 2, 6, 29; 1, 2, 8, 19. 'on meeting his mother and other persons whose feet must be embraced, he shall first embrace the highest, i.e. the most excellent, afterwards the others. Who the most excellent is has been declared above, II, 50-51.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_979"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_980">208:5</A> &Acirc;pastamba I, 2, 5, 12-15. Professor Stenzler reads a<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>asamav&acirc;ye, while my copies and their commentary show that <I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>asamav&acirc;ye has to be read. Besides, it seems impossible to make any sense out of the former reading without assuming that the construction is strongly elliptical. 'On meeting, i.e. on corning together with him who knows the rule of returning a salute, he shall utter, i.e. loudly pronounce his name, i.e. the name which he has received on the tenth day (after his birth), and which is to be employed in saluting, and speak the word "I" as well as the word "this." They declare that instead of the word "this," which here is explicitly prescribed, the word "I am" must be used. Some salute thus, "I Haradatta by name" others, "I Haradatta<I>s</I>arman;" and the common usage is to say, "I Haradatta<I>s</I>arman by name." Thus the salutation must be made. Salutation means saluting. The affix a<I>k</I> is added to causatives and the rest. With reference to this matter the rule for returning salutes has been described by Manu II, 126. . . . As (in the above S&ucirc;tra) the expression "on meeting persons knowing" is used, those who are unacquainted with the manner of returning a salute must not be saluted in this manner. How is it then to be done? It is described by Manu III, 123.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_980"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_981">208:6</A> 'As Gautama says, "Some declare," the restrictive rule must, in his opinion, be followed.'--Haradatta.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_983"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_984">209:10</A> 'Old (p&ucirc;rva), i.e. of greater age. . A <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra even, who answers this description, must be honoured by rising, not, however, be saluted by one young enough to be his son, i.e. by a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who is very much younger. The <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra is mentioned as an instance of a man of inferior caste. Hence a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra must (under these circumstances) be honoured by rising, not be saluted by men of the three higher castes, a Vai<I>s</I>ya by those of the two higher castes, and a Kshatriya by a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_984"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_985">209:11</A> 'An &Acirc;rya, i.e. a man of the three twice-born castes, though he be inferior, i.e. younger, must be honoured by rising, not be saluted by a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra. The <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra is mentioned in order to give an instance of (a man of) inferior caste.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_985"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_986">209:12</A> 'An inferior shall avoid to take his name, i.e. that of a superior.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_986"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_987">210:14</A> Haradatta says that sam&acirc;nehani, 'on the same day,' means 'in the same year.' He is probably right in thinking that the expression must not be interpreted too strictly. But his assertion that aha<I>h</I> means also 'year' cannot be proved by his quotation from the Nigha<I>n</I><I>t</I>uka, abde sa<I>m</I>vatsaram ahar<I>g</I>aram.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_987"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_988">210:15</A> 'A person aged by ten years, i.e. at least ten years older, who lives in the same town as oneself, is to be addressed as bho<I>h</I>, bhavan, though he may be deficient in good qualities.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_988"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_989">210:16</A> 'The words "years older" must be understood. He who lives by the fine arts (kal&acirc;), i.e. the knowledge of music, painting leaf-cutting, and the like, and is at least five years older than oneself, must be addressed as bho<I>h</I> or bhavan.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_989"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_990">210:17</A> Haradatta notes that &Acirc;pastamba I, 4, 14, 13 gives a somewhat different rule.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_990"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_991">210:18</A> Haradatta adds that a person destitute of learning, be he ever so old, may still be treated as an equal, and addressed as bho<I>h</I>, bhavan, by a more learned man,</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_991"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_992">210:20</A> Manu II, 136. 'As wealth and the rest cannot be directly honoured, the persons possessing them are to be honoured . . . . . Respect (m&acirc;na) means honour shown by saluting and the like.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_992"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_993">211:21</A> Manu II, 154.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_993"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_994">211:23</A> Haradatta says that a passage to this effect occurs in the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. He also refers to Manu II, 151.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_994"></A><A HREF="sbe0270.htm#fr_995">211:24</A> &Acirc;pastamba II, 5, 11, 5, 7-9. 'A person requiring consideration, i.e. one afflicted by disease. A woman, i.e. a bride or a pregnant woman. A Sn&acirc;taka, i.e. a person who has bathed after completing his studies and after having kept the vow of studentship.'--Haradatta.</P>
