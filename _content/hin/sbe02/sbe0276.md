same fines) as a Brâhma*n*a and a Kshatriya. <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[14](#fn_1163)

15\. (The value of) property which a *S*ûdra unrighteously acquires by
theft, must be repaid eightfold. <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[15](#fn_1164)

16\. For each of the other castes (the fines must be) doubled. <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[16](#fn_1165)

17\. If a learned man offends, the punishment shall be very much
increased. <span id="fr_1167"></span>[17](#fn_1166)

18\. If fruits, green corn, and vegetables are appropriated in small

29\. The legal interest for money lent (is at the rate of) five Mâshas a

id="fr_1173"></span>[29](#fn_1172)

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

37\. The property of (a person who is) neither an idiot nor a minor,
having been used by strangers before his eyes for ten years, (belongs)
to him who uses it, <span id="fr_1181"></span>[37](#fn_1180)

38\. (But) not (if it is used) by *S*rotriyas, ascetics, or royal
officials. <span id="fr_1182"></span>[38](#fn_1181)

39\. Animals, land, and females are not lost (to the owner) by
(another's) possession. <span id="fr_1183"></span>[39](#fn_1182)

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

40\. The heirs shall pay the debts (of a deceased person). <span

42\. An (open) deposit, a sealed deposit, an object lent for use, an

id="fr_1193"></span>[51](#fn_1192)

52\. Or a pardon (may be given) in accordance with the opinion of an

id="page_239">p. 239</span> Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 215. Haradatta adds that
an abusive word or a blow given in jest must not be punished in the
manner prescribed above, as the word 'pârushya' presupposes criminal
intent.

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[239:2](sbe0276.htm#fr_1156) Âpastamba II, 10,
26, 20; Mayûkha XIX, 7, where, however, ârya has been altered to
â*k*ârya. Haradatta adds that the two punishments are cumulative in the
case of a Brâhma*n*î only. If the offence is committed with a Kshatriyâ,
the offender is liable to the first only; if he sins with a Vai*s*yâ, to
the second.

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[239:3](sbe0276.htm#fr_1157) Âpastamba II, 10,

27, 15; Manu VIII, 281.-The translation follows Haradatta, who is guided
by the parallel passages. But for the latter, one would translate 'he
shall be fined.'

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[239:8](sbe0276.htm#fr_1159) Manu VIII, 267;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 204-207. Manu VIII, 136 states one Kârshâpa*n*a or
copper Pa*n*a contains 80 Raktikâs, which would correspond to 97-60
grammes of the metrical system.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[240:13](sbe0276.htm#fr_1163) Manu VIII, 268.
Haradatta adds that, as a Brâhma*n*a is declared to pay nothing for
abusing a *S*ûdra, a Kshatriya and a Vai*s*ya are liable to be fined for
that offence, and that according to U*s*anas a Kshatriya shall pay
twenty-four Pa*n*as, and a Vai*s*ya thirty-six.

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[240:14](sbe0276.htm#fr_1164) I.e. a Vai*s*ya
shall pay one hundred Pa*n*as for abusing a Kshatriya, and a Kshatriya
fifty for abusing a Vai*s*ya.

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[240:15](sbe0276.htm#fr_1165) Manu VIII, 337.

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[240:16](sbe0276.htm#fr_1166) Manu VIII,
337-338. I.e. a Vai*s*ya is to pay sixteen times the value of the stolen
property, a Kshatriya thirty-two times, and a Brâhma*n*a sixty-four
times.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[240:17](sbe0276.htm#fr_1167) Manu VIII, 338.

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[240:18](sbe0276.htm#fr_1168) Manu VIII, 330.
K*ri*sh*n*ala is another name for Raktikâ, <span id="page_241">p.
241</span> used also by Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 362. It equals 0.122 grammes of
the metrical system, Prinsep, Useful Tables, p. 97.

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[241:20](sbe0276.htm#fr_1169)-21. Manu VIII,
240; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 162.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[241:22](sbe0276.htm#fr_1170)-26. Manu VIII,
241; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 159-161; Colebrooke III, Digest IV, 40.
Haradatta, relying on U*s*anas everywhere, reckons twenty Mâshas to the
Kârshâpa*n*a.

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[241:27](sbe0276.htm#fr_1171) Âpastamba II,
11, 27, 18.

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[241:28](sbe0276.htm#fr_1172) Âpastamba I, 10,
28, 3; Colebrooke III, Digest IV, 22.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[241:29](sbe0276.htm#fr_1173) Manu VIII, 140;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 37; Colebrooke I, Digest 25. Haradatta states that a
Kârshâpa*n*a contains twenty <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> Mâshas.
Thus the monthly interest for 400 Mâshas being five Mâshas, the rate is
1¼ per cent for the month, or 15 per cent per annum.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[242:30](sbe0276.htm#fr_1174) Colebrooke I,
Digest 40; Manu VIII, 153.

<span id="fn_1174"></span>[242:31](sbe0276.htm#fr_1175) Manu VIII, 151;
Colebrooke I, Digest 59.

<span id="fn_1175"></span>[242:32](sbe0276.htm#fr_1176) Manu VIII, 143;
Colebrooke I, Digest 79.

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[242:33](sbe0276.htm#fr_1177) Colebrooke I,
Digest 79. 'Likewise the debt of a debtor who, being desirous to pay, is
imprisoned by the king or others in a prison or the like, and who is
thus unable to pay, does not increase from that day.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1177"></span>[242:34](sbe0276.htm#fr_1178) For this and the
next Sûtra, see also Colebrooke I, Digest 35-45, in the notes on which
latter text the various explanations of these terms, found here, have
been fully discussed. 'If a large or a small interest is taken on
condition that the loan is to be repaid on a certain date, and that, in
case of non-payment, 'it is to be trebled or quadrupled, that is called
periodical interest'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1178"></span>[242:35](sbe0276.htm#fr_1179) 'Where the
lender and the borrower, having regard to the country, the time, the
object, and the condition (of the borrower), agree between themselves
(on a certain Tate), e.g. of ten per cent per mensem, that is called
stipulated interest. Corporal interest is that which is payable by
bodily labour. Thus B*ri*haspati says, "Corporal interest is that
connected with work." But Vyâsa explains it thus, "Corporal interest is
that which arises from the work (or use) of a (pledged female quadruped)
to be <span id="page_243">p. 243</span> milked, or of (a male) to carry
burdens." Kâtyâyana explains the daily interest (lit. the interest
resembling the growth of the lock on the head), "That which is taken
daily is called daily interest." . . . 'E.g. for a Prastha of grain lent
a handful of grain is taken daily.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1179"></span>[243:36](sbe0276.htm#fr_1180) Colebrooke I,
Digest 62. Haradatta mentions also another explanation of the Sûtra:
'Another (commentator) says, " If products of animals and the rest have
been bought, and the price is not paid at once, that may increase
fivefold by the addition of interest, but not, to a greater sum."'

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[243:37](sbe0276.htm#fr_1181) Manu VIII,
147-148; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 24.

<span id="fn_1181"></span>[243:38](sbe0276.htm#fr_1182) Haradatta adds
that in the case of a *S*rotriya and of an ascetic, the owner may allow
the use of his property for a long time, desiring to acquire merit by
doing so, and that fear may prevent him from opposing the king's
servants. Hence prolonged possession by such persons does not
necessitate the conclusion that the owner had given up his rights. As
ascetics cannot possess any property, the Sûtra must refer to their
occupying an empty house which has an owner.

<span id="fn_1182"></span>[243:39](sbe0276.htm#fr_1183) Manu VIII, 149;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 25. The translation given above agrees with an
explanation of the Sûtra which Haradatta mentions, but rejects. He
himself prefers the following: 'Animals, i.e. quadrupeds; land, i.e. a
field, a garden, and the like; females, i.e. female slaves and the like.
No long possession of animals and the rest is necessary in order to
acquire the rights of ownership over them. Even after a short period
they become the property of the possessor. For how (would it be possible
that) a person, who himself wants butter-milk and the like, should allow
a cow which he himself has bought, and which gives daily a Drona of
milk, to be milked in the house of another person?' &c. &c.

<span id="fn_1183"></span>[244:40](sbe0276.htm#fr_1184) Manu VIII, 162;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 51.

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[244:41](sbe0276.htm#fr_1185) Manu VIII,
159-160; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 47, 54; Colebrooke I, Digest 202. Taking into
account the parallel passages of Manu and Yâ*gñ*avalkya, Haradatta very
properly restricts this rule to a bail for the personal appearance of an
offender. In explanation of the expression 'a commercial debt' he gives
the following instance: 'If a person has borrowed money from somebody on
the condition that he is to repay the principal together with the gain
thereon, and if he dies in a foreign country, while travelling in order
to trade, then that money shall not be repaid by the son.' The instance
explaining the term 'fee' (*s*ulka) is as follows: 'If a person has
promised a fee (to the parents of a woman) and dies after the wedding,
then that fee does not involve his son, i.e. need not be paid by him.'
The word *s*ulka is, however, ambiguous, and may also mean 'a tax or
toll.'

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[244:42](sbe0276.htm#fr_1186) Manu VIII, 189;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 59-66; Colebrooke II, Digest I, 29. Haradatta declares
the meaning to be, that in case the bailee was guilty of no negligence
and took the same care of the deposits &c. as of his own property,
neither he nor his heirs need make good the value of those which were
lost or destroyed.

'preventing (a repetition of) the deed,' may also mean 'suspension from
(his priestly) functions.'
