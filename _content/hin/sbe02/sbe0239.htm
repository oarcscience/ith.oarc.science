<p>4. With the following (ten Mantras, addressed to Earth, Air, Heaven, Sun, Moon, the Constellations, Indra, B<I>ri</I>haspati, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Brahman, he offers ten Balis, each following one to the east of the preceding one), in (the part of the house called) the seat of Brahma.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_559"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p>15. Endless worlds are the portion (of those householders and wives) who act thus.</p>  
<p>16. To a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who has not studied the Veda, a seat, water, and food must be given. But (the giver) shall not rise (to do him honour).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>17. But if (such a man) is worthy of a salutation (for other reasons), he shall rise to salute him.</p>  
<p>18. Nor (shall a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a rise to receive) a Kshatriya or Vai<I>s</I>ya (though they may be learned).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_569"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_557"></A><A HREF="sbe0239.htm#fr_558">107:3</A> 'Others explain apidh&acirc;na, "the panels of the door;" to mean "the bolt of the door."'--Haradatta. The offering is made to N&acirc;ma, 'the name, or essence of things.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_558"></A><A HREF="sbe0239.htm#fr_559">108:4</A> Haradatta gives two explanations of the word Brahmasadana, 'the seat of Brahman.' According to some, it is an architectural term, designating the centre of the house; according to others, it denotes the place where, at the time of the burnt-oblations, the Brahman or superintending priest is seated, i.e. a spot to the south of the sacred fire.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_559"></A><A HREF="sbe0239.htm#fr_560">108:5</A> Balis and water for the Manes are placed or poured into the palm of the hand and thrown out between the thumb and forefinger. That part of the palm is, therefore, sometimes called 'the t&icirc;rtha sacred to the Manes.' See Manu II, 39.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_560"></A><A HREF="sbe0239.htm#fr_561">108:6</A> 'That is to say, the sacrificial cord shall not be suspended over the right shoulder, nor shall the Bali be thrown out between the thumb and forefinger.'--Haradatta</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_561"></A><A HREF="sbe0239.htm#fr_562">108:7</A> In sprinkling around an offering to the gods, the sacrificer turns his right hand towards the oblation and pours out the water, beginning in the south and ending in the east. In sprinkling around an offering to the Manes, exactly the opposite order is to be followed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_562"></A><A HREF="sbe0239.htm#fr_563">109:8</A> At night, i. e. before the evening meal. The Mantra is, 'To those beings which, being servants of Vituda, roam about day and night, desiring a Bali-offering, I offer this Bali, desirous of prosperity. May the Lord of prosperity grant me prosperity, sv&acirc;h&acirc;. Haradatta adds, that according to another commentator, no other Bali but this is to be offered in the evening, and that some modify the Mantra for each occasion, offering the Bali in the morning to the Bh&ucirc;tas that roam about during the day,' and in the evening 'to the night-walkers.' Compare for the whole section Manu III, 90-92; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 102-104.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_563"></A><A HREF="sbe0239.htm#fr_564">109:10</A> Manu III, 94 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_564"></A><A HREF="sbe0239.htm#fr_565">109:11</A> Manu III, 115; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 105.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_565"></A><A HREF="sbe0239.htm#fr_566">109:12</A> Manu III, 114; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 105.</P>

This irregularity would disappear if t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;, the Vedic form of the nom. ace. plural, were read for t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;ni, and it seems to me not improbable that t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;ni is a correction made by a Pandit who valued grammatical correctness higher than correctness of metre.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_571"></A><A HREF="sbe0239.htm#fr_572">111:24</A> Manu II, 241, 242. From here down to II, 3, 6, 2, &Acirc;pastamba again treats of the duties of students and teachers, a subject which appears to have in his eyes a greater importance than any other. The rules given now apply chiefly to householders. It would seem that they have been inserted in this particular place, because the reception of a former teacher is to be described II, 3, 5, 4-11, and that of a 'learned guest' II, 3, 6, 3 seq.</P>
