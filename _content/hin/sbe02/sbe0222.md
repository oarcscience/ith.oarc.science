### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 6, KHA*ND*A 19.

1\. A drunkard, a madman, a prisoner, he who learns the Veda from his
son, a creditor who sits with his debtor (hindering the fulfilment of
his duties), a debtor who thus sits (with his creditor, are persons
whose food must not be eaten) as long as they are thus engaged or in
that state. <span id="fr_424"></span>[1](#fn_423)

2\. Who (then) are those whose food may be eaten? <span
id="fr_425"></span>[2](#fn_424)

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

3\. Ka*n*va declares, that it is he who wishes to give.

4\. Kautsa declares, that it is he who is holy. <span
id="fr_426"></span>[4](#fn_425)

5\. Vârshyâya*n*i declares, that it is every giver (of food).

6\. For if guilt remains fixed on the man (who committed a crime, then
food given by a sinner) may be eaten (because the guilt cannot leave the
sinner). But if guilt can leave (the sinner at any time, then food given
by the sinner may be eaten because) he becomes pure by the gift (which
he makes).

7\. Offered food, which is pure, may be eaten, according to Eka,
Ku*n*ika, Kâ*n*va, Kutsa, and Pushkarasâdi.

8\. Vârshyâya*n*i's opinion is, that (food) given unasked (may be
accepted) from anybody.

9\. (Food offered) willingly by a holy man may be eaten.

10\. Food given unwillingly by a holy man ought not to be eaten. <span
id="fr_427"></span>[10](#fn_426)

11\. Food offered unasked by any person whatsoever may be eaten,

12\. 'But not if it be given after an express previous announcement;'
thus says Hârita.

13\. Now they quote also in a Purâ*n*a the following two verses: <span
id="fr_428"></span>[13](#fn_427)

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

'The Lord of creatures has declared, that food offered unasked and
brought by the giver himself, may be eaten, though (the giver be) a
sinner, provided the gift has not been announced beforehand. The Manes
of the ancestors of that man who spurns such food, do not eat (his
oblations) for fifteen years, nor does the fire carry his offerings (to
the gods).'

14\. (Another verse from a Purâ*n*a declares): 'The food given by a
physician, a hunter, a surgeon, a fowler, an unfaithful wife, or a
eunuch must not be eaten.' <span id="fr_429"></span>[14](#fn_428)

15\. Now (in confirmation of this) they quote (the following verse):
'The murderer of a Brâhma*n*a learned in the Veda heaps his guilt on his
guest, an innocent man on his calumniator, a thief set at liberty on the
king, and the petitioner on him who makes false promises.' <span
id="fr_430"></span>[15](#fn_429)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_423"></span>[69:1](sbe0222.htm#fr_424) **19**. Manu IV,
207; Yâ*gñ*. I, 161, 162. Another commentator explains a*n*ika,
translated above 'he who learns the Veda from his son,' by 'a
money-lender,' and combines pratyupavish*t*a*h* with this word, i.e. 'a
money-lender who sits with his debtor hindering him from fulfilling his
duties.' This manner of forcing a debtor to pay, which is also called
Â*k*arita (see Manu VIII, 49), is, though illegal, resorted to sometimes
even now.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[69:2](sbe0222.htm#fr_425) 'The object of this
Sûtra is to introduce the great variety of opinions quoted
below.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[70:4](sbe0222.htm#fr_426) 'Holy' means not
only 'following his lawful occupations,' but particularly 'practising
austerities, reciting prayers, and offering
burnt-oblations.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[70:10](sbe0222.htm#fr_427) Another commentator
explains this Sûtra thus: 'He need not eat the food offered by a
righteous man, if he himself does not wish to do so.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[70:13](sbe0222.htm#fr_428) See Manu IV, 248
and 249, where these identical verses occur.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[71:14](sbe0222.htm#fr_429) Manu IV, 211, 212.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[71:15](sbe0222.htm#fr_430) Regarding the
liberation of the thief, see Âpastamba I, 9, 25, 4. A similar verse
occurs Manu VIII, 317, which has caused the confusion observable in many
MSS., as has been stated in the critical notes to the text.
