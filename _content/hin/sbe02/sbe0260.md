which (must look) towards the south.

3\. The palace (shall stand) in the heart of the town. <span

4\. In front of that (there shall be) a hall. That is called the hall of
invitation.

5\. (At a little distance) from the town to the south, (he shall cause
to be built) an assembly-house with doors on the south and on the north
sides, so that one can see what passes inside and outside.

6\. In all (these three places) fires shall burn constantly. <span
id="fr_752"></span>[6](#fn_751)

7\. And oblations must be offered in these fires daily, just as at the
daily sacrifice of a householder. <span id="fr_753"></span>[7](#fn_752)

8\. In the hall he shall put up his guests, at least those who are
learned in the Vedas. <span id="fr_754"></span>[8](#fn_753)

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

9\. Rooms, a couch, food and drink should be given to them according to
their good qualities.

11\. And in his realm no (Brâhma*n*a) should suffer hunger, sickness,

id="fr_756"></span>[11](#fn_755)

12\. In the midst of the assembly-house, (the superintendent of the
house) shall raise a play-table and sprinkle it with water, turning his
hand downwards, and place on it dice in even numbers, made of Vibhîtaka
(wood), as many as are wanted.

13\. Men of the first three castes, who are pure and truthful, may be
allowed to play there. <span id="fr_757"></span>[13](#fn_756)

14\. Assaults of arms, dancing, singing, music, and the like
(performances) shall be held only (in the houses) of the king's
servants. <span id="fr_758"></span>[14](#fn_757)

15\. That king only takes care of the welfare of his subjects in whose
dominions, be it in villages or forests, there is no danger from
thieves. <span id="fr_759"></span>[15](#fn_758)
