Haradatta states that ata<I>h</I>, 'therefore,' means 'because the K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ras cannot be performed if they have not been described,' while S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, on the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na, asserts that it means 'because unpurified persons who are unable to offer sacrifices cannot gain heavenly bliss without performing austerities such as K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ras.' It is a remarkable fact that Haradatta does not seem to have been aware that the twenty-sixth chapter of Gautama is taken bodily from the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na.</P>

Regarding the S&acirc;mans and Mantras, see notes to Burnell's edition of the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na, and above, XXV, 7. Haradatta remarks that in the Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. (V, 6, 1) the Mantras beginning ' The golden-coloured' are ten in number, and adds that 'if in some other <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; eight are found, those must be taken.'</P>

The epithets given to the deity in the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na can all be referred to the Sun, provided he is identified with the universal soul, while in the above S&ucirc;tra, Rudra and Indra have been introduced. It cannot be doubtful that the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na gives an older and more authentic form of the prayer. My translation of the epithets, which are found in the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na also, follows S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's gloss. Haradatta does not explain them. About Sobhya in the twelfth Mantra, which possibly might mean, 'he who dwells in a mirage, i.e. the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra,' I feel doubtful. My MSS. read somya, and the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na has saumya in the second Mantra. But I am unwilling to alter the word, as Professor Stenzler's reading may have been derived from a South-Indian MS., where bhya and mya do not resemble each other so, much as in the Devan&acirc;gar&icirc; characters.</P>
