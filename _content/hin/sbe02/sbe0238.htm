<P><A NAME="fn_542"></A><A HREF="sbe0238.htm#fr_543">104:5</A> This S&ucirc;tra is a <I>G</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;paka, as it indicates that &Acirc;pastamba also recognises the different rules which are usually prescribed in the Sm<I>ri</I>tis for Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, Kshatriyas, Vai<I>s</I>yas, and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras. See above, I, 5, 16, 2.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_545"></A><A HREF="sbe0238.htm#fr_546">105:12</A> Balis are portions of food which are thrown before the door, or on the floor of the house. See below, S&ucirc;tra 16 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_546"></A><A HREF="sbe0238.htm#fr_547">105:13</A> Others explain this S&ucirc;tra thus: 'After having used for the first time these sacred formulas (which are to be recited in offering the burnt-oblation and the Balis, the householder and his wife) shall sleep,' &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_547"></A><A HREF="sbe0238.htm#fr_548">105:14</A> Regarding the use of ekar&acirc;tra in the sense of 'a (day and a) night,' see above. The 'last' Bali-offering is that described below, II ,2, 4, 5.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_548"></A><A HREF="sbe0238.htm#fr_549">105:15</A> 'They say that the word "afterwards" is used in order to indicate that perfumes, garlands, and other (Upa<I>k</I>&acirc;ras) must be, offered between (the last two acts).'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_549"></A><A HREF="sbe0238.htm#fr_550">106:16</A> It is a disputed point with the commentators whether every Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a may offer the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva in the common kitchen-fire, or those persons only who do not keep a sacred domestic fire. The six Mantras, which are given Taitt. &Acirc;r. X, 67, 1, are: 1. Agnaye sv&acirc;h&acirc;, 'to Agni sv&acirc;h&acirc;'; 2. Som&acirc;ya sv&acirc;h&acirc;, 'to Soma sv&acirc;h&acirc;'; 3. Vi<I>s</I>vebhyo devebhya<I>h</I> sv&acirc;h&acirc;, 'to all the gods sv&acirc;h&acirc;'; 4. Dhruv&acirc;ya bh&ucirc;maya sv&acirc;h&acirc;, 'to Dhruva Bh&ucirc;ma sv&acirc;h&acirc;'; 5. Dhruvakshitaye sv&acirc;h&acirc;, 'to Dhruvakshiti sv&acirc;h&acirc;'; 6. A<I>k</I>yutakshitaye sv&acirc;h&acirc;, 'to A<I>k</I>yutakshiti sv&acirc;h&acirc;.' Haradatta adds that some add a seventh formula, addressed to Agni svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t, 'to the fire which causes the proper performance of the sacrifice,' while others leave out the second Mantra and give that addressed to Agni svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t the sixth place. This latter is the order given in the Calcutta edition of the Taittir&icirc;ya &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka.</P>

The Mantras recited are: 1. at the first sprinkling, Adite &#8217;numanyasva, 'Aditi permit'; Anumate &#8217;numanyasva, 'Anumati permit'; Sarasvaty anumanyasva, 'Sarasvat&icirc; permit'; Deva Savita<I>h</I> prasuva, 'Divine Savit<I>ri</I> permit'; 2. at the second sprinkling, the same as above, anvama<I>m</I>sth&acirc;<I>h</I> and pr&acirc;s&acirc;v&icirc;<I>h</I>, 'thou hast permitted,' being substituted for anumanyasva and prasuva.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_551"></A><A HREF="sbe0238.htm#fr_552">106:18</A> This S&ucirc;tra is a restriction of S&ucirc;tra 15.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_552"></A><A HREF="sbe0238.htm#fr_553">106:20</A> The first six offerings constitute the Devaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a or Vai<I>s</I>vadeva, which is offered in the fire. Now follow the Bali-offerings, which are merely placed on the ground. 'Behind the fire' means to the east of the fire'; for the sacrificer must face the east.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_553"></A><A HREF="sbe0238.htm#fr_554">107:21</A> The Mantra is, Adbbya<I>h</I> sv&acirc;h&acirc;, 'to the Waters sv&acirc;h&acirc;.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_554"></A><A HREF="sbe0238.htm#fr_555">107:22</A> The Mantras are, Osbadhivanaspatibbya<I>h</I> sv&acirc;h&acirc;, 'to the herbs and trees sv&acirc;h&acirc;'; Raksbodeva<I>g</I>anebhya<I>h</I> sv&acirc;h&acirc;, 'to the R&acirc;kshasas and the servants of the gods sv&acirc;h&acirc;.'</P>
