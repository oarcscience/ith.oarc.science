remainder). If the wind does not blow too violently, he shall eat

the) same (direction)the first alternative is the skin of a
he-goat. <span id="fr_711"></span>[1](#fn_710)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_710"></span>[149:1](sbe0254.htm#fr_711) **19**. The
ceremony which is here described, may also be performed daily. If the
reading prâsya is adopted, the translation must run thus: 'and he shall
scatter (the remainder of the powder). If the wind,' &c.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[149:2](sbe0254.htm#fr_712) 'Therefore those
whose mothers are alive should not perform this ceremony.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[149:4](sbe0254.htm#fr_713) If the masculine
bhoktavya*h* is used instead of bhoktavyam, the participle must be
construed with *k*amasa*h*.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[149:5](sbe0254.htm#fr_714) The verbum finitum,
which according to the Sanskrit text ought to be taken with the
participle sa*m*nayan, is grasîta, Sûtra 9.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[149:8](sbe0254.htm#fr_715) 'Why is this second
alternative mentioned, as (the first Sûtra) suffices? True. But
according to the maxim that "restrictions are made on account of the
continuance of an action once begun," the meaning of this second Sûtra
is that he shall <span id="page_150">p. 150</span> continue to the end
to handle the vessel (in that manner in which) he has handled it when
eating for the first time.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[150:16](sbe0254.htm#fr_716) Haradatta remarks
that some allow, according to II, 2, 4, 22, the sacred thread to be
substituted, and others think that both the thread and the garment
should be worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm.
