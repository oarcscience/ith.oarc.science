far from his house.

4\. And as long as he is impure he (shall avoid) to pronounce the names
of the gods.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

5\. And he shall not speak evil of the gods or of the king. <span
id="fr_508"></span>[5](#fn_507)

6\. He shall not touch with his foot a Brâhma*n*a, a cow, nor any other
(venerable beings).

7\. (Nor shall he touch them) with his hand, except for particular
reasons.

8\. He shall not mention the blemishes of a cow, of sacrificial
presents, or of a girl. <span id="fr_509"></span>[8](#fn_508)

9\. And he shall not announce it (to the owner) if a cow does damage (by
eating corn or grass in a field).

10\. (Nor shall he call attention to it) if a cow is together with her
calf, except for a particular reason.

11\. And of a cow which is not a milch-cow he shall not say, 'She is not
a milch-cow.' He must say, 'This is a cow which will become a
milch-cow.'

12\. He shall not call 'lucky' that which is lucky. He shall call it 'a
mercy, a blessing.' <span id="fr_510"></span>[12](#fn_509)

15\. (In company) he shall not say, 'This person

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

is my enemy.' If he says, 'This person is my enemy,' he will raise for
himself an enemy, who will show his hatred.

16\. If he sees a rainbow, he must not say to others, 'Here is Indra's
bow.' <span id="fr_513"></span>[16](#fn_512)

18\. He shall avoid to look at the sun when he rises or sets. <span
id="fr_515"></span>[18](#fn_514)

19\. During the day the sun protects the creatures, during the night the
moon. Therefore let him eagerly strive to protect himself on the night
of the new moon by purity, continence, and rites adapted for the season.

20\. For during that night the sun and the moon dwell together.

21\. He shall not enter the village by a by path. If he enters it thus,
he shall mutter this *Ri*k-verse, 'Praise be to Rudra, the lord of the
dwelling,' or some other (verse) addressed to Rudra. <span
id="fr_516"></span>[21](#fn_515)

22\. He shall not (ordinarily) give the residue of his food to a person
who is not a Brâhma*n*a. When he gives it (to such a one), he shall
clean his teeth and give (the food) after having placed in it (the dirt
from his teeth). <span id="fr_517"></span>[22](#fn_516)

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

23\. And let him avoid the faults that destroy the creatures, such as
anger and the like. <span id="fr_518"></span>[23](#fn_517)
