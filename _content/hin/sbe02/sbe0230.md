### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 9, KHA*ND*A 27.

1\. After having eaten sesamum or having fasted on the full moon day of
the month Srâva*n*a July-August), he may on the following day bathe in
the water of a great river and offer (a burnt-oblation of) one thousand
pieces of sacred fuel, whilst. reciting the Gâyatrî, or he may mutter
(the Gâyatrî) as many times. <span id="fr_485"></span>[1](#fn_484)

2\. Or he may perform Ish*t*is and Soma-sacrifices for the sake of
purifying himself (from his sins), <span id="fr_486"></span>[2](#fn_485)

3\. After having eaten forbidden food, he must fast, until his entrails
are empty. <span id="fr_487"></span>[3](#fn_486)

4\. That is (generally) attained after seven days.

5\. Or he may during winter and during the dewy

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

season (November-March) bathe in cold water both morning and evening.

6\. Or he may perform a K*rikkh*ra penance, which lasts twelve days.

7\. The rule for the K*rikkh*ra penance of twelve days (is the
following): For three days he must not eat in the evening, and then for
three days not in the morning; for three days he must live on food which
has been given unasked, and three days he must not eat anything. <span
id="fr_488"></span>[7](#fn_487)

8\. If he repeats this for a year, that is called a K*rikkh*ra penance,
which lasts for a year.

9\. Now follows another penance. He who has committed even a great many
sins which do not cause him to fall, becomes free from guilt, if,
fasting, he recites the entire *S*âkhâ of his Veda three times
consecutively. <span id="fr_489"></span>[9](#fn_488)

10\. He who cohabits with a non-Aryan woman, he who lends money at
interest, he who drinks (other) spirituous liquors (than Surâ), he who
praises everybody in a manner unworthy of a Brâhma*n*a, shall sit on
grass, allowing his back to be scorched (by the sun).

11\. A Brâhma*n*a removes the sin which he committed by serving one day
and night (a man of) the black race, if he bathes for three years,
eating at every fourth meal-time. <span id="fr_490"></span>[11](#fn_489)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_484"></span>[86:1](sbe0230.htm#fr_485) **27**. 'The
oblations of sacred fuel (samidh) are not to be accompanied by the
exclamation Svâhâ'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[86:2](sbe0230.htm#fr_486) Ish*t*is are the
simplest forms of the *S*rauta-sacrifices, i.e. of those for which three
fires are necessary.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[86:3](sbe0230.htm#fr_487) For some particular
kinds of forbidden food the same penance is prescribed, Manu XI,
153-154.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[87:7](sbe0230.htm#fr_488) The same penance is
described, under the name Prâ*g*âpatya k*rikkh*ra, the K*rikkh*ra
invented by Pra*g*âpati, Manu XI, 212, and Yâ*gñ*. III, 320.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[87:9](sbe0230.htm#fr_489) Manu XI, 259.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[87:11](sbe0230.htm#fr_490) The expression
k*ri*sh*n*a var*n*a, 'the black race,' is truly Vedic. In the *Rig*-veda
it usually denotes the aboriginal races, and sometimes the demons.
Others explain the Sûtra thus: <span id="page_88">p. 88</span> A
Brâhma*n*a removes the sin, which he committed by cohabiting for one
night with a female of the *S*ûdra caste, &c.--Haradatta. The latter
explanation has been adopted by Kullûka on Manu XI. 179.
