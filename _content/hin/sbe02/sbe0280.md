1\. The annual (term for studying the Veda) begins on the full moon of

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

(the full moon of) Bhâdrapada (August-September) and study the Vedic

6\. Nor if it is audible at night,

7\. Nor if the sound of a Vâ*n*a, of a large or a small drum, the noise
of a chariot, and the wail of a person in pain (are heard), <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[7](#fn_1262)

8\. Nor if the barking of many dogs and jackals, or the braying of many
donkeys (is heard),

hoar-frost (lies on the ground), <span id="fr_1264"></span>[9](#fn_1263)

10\. Nor if clouds rise out of season. <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[10](#fn_1264)

11\. (Let him not study) when he feels the necessity to void urine or
excrements, <span id="fr_1266"></span>[11](#fn_1265)

12\. Nor at midnight, in the twilight, and (while standing) in the
water, <span id="fr_1267"></span>[12](#fn_1266)

13\. Nor while rain falls. <span id="fr_1268"></span>[13](#fn_1267)

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

14\. Some (declare, that the recitation of the Veda must be interrupted
only) when (the rain) is dripping from the edge of the roof.

15\. (Nor shall he study) when the teachers (of the gods and Âsuras,
i.e. the planets Jupiter and Venus) are surrounded by a halo, <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[15](#fn_1268)

moon), <span id="fr_1270"></span>[16](#fn_1269)

id="fr_1271"></span>[17](#fn_1270)

18\. (Nor) in a burial-ground, at the extremity of a village, on a
high-road, nor during impurity, <span id="fr_1272"></span>[18](#fn_1271)

19\. Nor while a foul smell (is perceptible), while a corpse or a
Ka*nd*âla (is) in (the village), nor in the neighbourhood of a
*S*ûdra, <span id="fr_1273"></span>[19](#fn_1272)

20\. Nor while (he suffers from) sour eructations. <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[20](#fn_1273)

21\. The *Rig*-veda and the Ya*g*ur-veda (shall not be studied) while
the sound of the Sâmans (is heard). <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[21](#fn_1274)

22\. The fall of a thunderbolt, an earthquake, an eclipse, and (the fall
of) meteors (are reasons for discontinuing the reading of the Veda)
until the same time (next day), <span id="fr_1276"></span>[22](#fn_1275)

23\. Likewise when it thunders and rains and <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[23](#fn_1276)

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

when lightning (flashes out of season) after the fires have become
visible (in the twilight).

24\. (If these phenomena appear) during the (rainy) season, (the reading
must be interrupted) for a day (or a night), <span
id="fr_1278"></span>[24](#fn_1277)

25\. And if lightning (is observed) during the night, (the recitation of

26\. If (lightning) flashes during the third part of the day or later,
(the Veda must not be read) during the entire (following night).

27\. (According to the opinion) of some, a fiery meteor (has the same
effect) as lightning,

28\. Likewise thunder (which is heard) during the last part of the day,

29\. (Or) also in the twilight.

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

be interrupted) during the whole night. <span

interruption must continue) as long as the sun shines,

32\. Likewise if the king of the country has died.

33\. If one (pupil) has gone on a journey (and) another (stays) with
(the teacher, the study of the Veda shall be interrupted until the
absentee returns). <span id="fr_1281"></span>[33](#fn_1280)

34\. When an attack (is made on the village), or a fire (breaks out),
when one Veda has been completed, after (an attack of) vomiting, when he
has partaken of a funeral repast or of a dinner on the occasion of a
sacrifice offered to men, (the study of the Veda shall be interrupted)
for a day and a night, <span id="fr_1282"></span>[34](#fn_1281)

35\. Likewise on the day of the new moon.

36\. (On the latter occasion it may also be interrupted) for two
days. <span id="fr_1283"></span>[36](#fn_1282)

37\. (The Veda shall not be studied for a day and a night) on the full
moon days of the months Kârttika, Phâlgu*n*a, and Âshâ*dh*a. <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[37](#fn_1283)

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

38\. On the three Ash*t*akâs (the Veda shall not be studied) for three
(days and) nights. <span id="fr_1285"></span>[38](#fn_1284)

39\. Some (declare, that the rule applies) to the last Ash*t*akâ (only).

40\. (On the occasion of) the annual (Upâkarman and Utsarga the reading
shall be interrupted) on the day (of the ceremony) and those preceding
and following it. <span id="fr_1286"></span>[40](#fn_1285)

41\. All (teachers declare, that the reading shall be interrupted for
three days) when rain, thunder, and lightning (are observed)
simultaneously, <span id="fr_1287"></span>[41](#fn_1286)

42\. When the rain is very heavy, (the reading shall be interrupted as
long as it lasts). <span id="fr_1288"></span>[42](#fn_1287)

43\. On a festive day (the reading shall be stopped) after the (morning)
meal, <span id="fr_1289"></span>[43](#fn_1288)

44\. And he who has begun to study (after the Upâkarman shall not read)
at night for four Muhûrtas. <span id="fr_1290"></span>[44](#fn_1289)

45\. Some (declare, that the recitation of the Veda is) always
(forbidden) in a town. <span id="fr_1291"></span>[45](#fn_1290)

46\. While he is impure (he shall) not even (recite the Veda)
mentally. <span id="fr_1292"></span>[46](#fn_1291)

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

47\. (The study) of those who offer a funeral sacrifice (must be

performed at the beginning of the course of study, and it is obligatory
on householders also; see Âpastamba II, 2, 5, 1. *Kh*andâ*m*si, 'the

<span id="fn_1277"></span>[262:24](sbe0280.htm#fr_1278) Âpastamba I, 3,
9, 22. The above translation follows the reading of my MSS., which
differ very much from Professor Stenzler's edition. According to them
the commentary on the latter part of Sûtra 23 and on Sûtra 24 runs as
follows: . . . pratyekam âlâlikâ anadhyâyahetava*h* \| apartâv idam \|
*ri*tâv âha \|\|

AHA *RI*TAU \|\| 24 \|\|

Varshartâv ete yadi bhaveyu*h* sandhyâyâ*m* tadaharmâtram anâdhyâya*h*
\| prâta*sk*et \| sâya*m* tu râtrâv anadhyâya ityarthasiddhatvâd anuktam
\|\| . . . 'are each reasons for discontinuing the recitation until the
same time next day. This (rule) refers to other times than the rainy
season. He now declares (the rule) for the rainy season:

24\. "During the (rainy) season for a day."

'If these (phenomena) happen in the twilight during the rainy season,
the interruption of the study lasts for that day only, provided (they
happen) in the morning. But if they happen in the evening, study is
forbidden during the night. As this is clear from the context, it has
not been declared specially.'--Haradatta. I suspect that Professor
Stenzler's reading apartau is a correction, made by an ingenious Pandit,
of an old varia lectio 'ahartau' for aha *ri*tau, which is found in one
of my MSS. (C) also.

<span id="fn_1278"></span>[262:25](sbe0280.htm#fr_1279) Âpastamba I, 3,
9, 21.

<span id="fn_1279"></span>[263:30](sbe0280.htm#fr_1280) Âpastamba I, 3,

<span id="fn_1280"></span>[263:33](sbe0280.htm#fr_1281) Âpastamba I, 3,
11, 11. Haradatta adds that others enjoin a stoppage of the Veda-study
from the hour of the departure until the same hour on the following day,
while another commentator gives the following explanation: 'All, indeed,
the teacher and the rest, shall, on that day, not even recite the Veda
in order to remember it.'

<span id="fn_1281"></span>[263:34](sbe0280.htm#fr_1282) Âpastamba I, 3,
9, 25; I, 3, 10, 22, 28-30; I, 3, 11, 6, 30; Manu IV, 118. Haradatta is
in doubt whether 'a sacrifice offered in honour of men' means a
Sa*m*skâra, or a sacrifice to gods, like Kumâra, who formerly were men;
see Âpastamba I, 3, 11, 3.

<span id="fn_1282"></span>[263:36](sbe0280.htm#fr_1283) Âpastamba I, 3,

10, 1.

<span id="fn_1284"></span>[264:38](sbe0280.htm#fr_1285) Âpastamba I, 3,
10, 2. Regarding the meaning of the word Ash*t*akâ, see above, VIII, 18
note.

<span id="fn_1285"></span>[264:40](sbe0280.htm#fr_1286) Âpastamba I, 3,

<span id="fn_1287"></span>[264:42](sbe0280.htm#fr_1288) Âpastamba I, 3,
11, 28.

<span id="fn_1288"></span>[264:43](sbe0280.htm#fr_1289) Haradatta
explains 'a festive day' to mean the day of the initiation and the like,
but see Âpastamba I, 3, 11, 20.

<span id="fn_1289"></span>[264:44](sbe0280.htm#fr_1290) Haradatta
explains this Sûtra as equivalent to Âpastamba I, 3, 9, 1. He adds that
another commentator reads prâdhîtasya *k*a as a separate Sûtra,
interpreting it to mean, 'And a person who has performed the Upâkarman
(shall not study after dinner),' and refers the words 'at night for four
Muhûrtas' to the prohibition to read on the evening of the thirteenth
day of the dark half of the month.

<span id="fn_1290"></span>[264:45](sbe0280.htm#fr_1291) Manu IV, 116.
