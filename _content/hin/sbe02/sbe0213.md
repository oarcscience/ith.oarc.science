### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 3, KHA*ND*A 10.

1\. (Nor shall he study) on the days of the full moons of those months
in which the Kâturmasya-sacrifice may be performed (nor on the days
preceding them). <span id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_258)

2\. At the time of the Vedotsarga, on the death of Gurus, at the
Ashlakâ-*S*râddha, and at the time of the Upâkarma, (he shall not study)
for three days; <span id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_259)

3\. Likewise if near relations have died. <span
id="fr_261"></span>[3](#fn_260)

4\. (He shall not study) for twelve days, if his mother, father, or
teacher have died.

5\. If these (have died), he must (also) bathe for the same number of
days.

6\. Persons who are younger (than the relation deceased), must shave
(their hair and beard), <span id="fr_262"></span>[6](#fn_261)

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

7\. Some declare, that students who have returned home on completion of
their studentship, shall never shave, except if engaged in the
initiation to a *S*rauta-sacrifice. <span
id="fr_263"></span>[7](#fn_262)

8\. Now a Brâhma*n*a also declares, 'Verily, an empty, uncovered (pot)
is he, whose hair is shaved off entirely; the top-lock is his
covering.' <span id="fr_264"></span>[8](#fn_263)

9\. But at sacrificial sessions the top-lock must be shaved off, because
it is so enjoined in the Veda. <span id="fr_265"></span>[9](#fn_264)

10\. Some declare, that, upon the death of the teacher, (the reading
should be interrupted) for three days and three nights. <span
id="fr_266"></span>[10](#fn_265)

11\. If (he hears of) the death of a learned Brâhma*n*a (*S*rotriya)
before a full year (since the death) has elapsed, (he shall interrupt
his reading) for one night (and day). <span
id="fr_267"></span>[11](#fn_266)

12\. Some declare, (that the deceased *S*rotriya must have been) a
fellow-student.

13-14. If a learned Brâhma*n*a (*S*rotriya) has arrived and he is
desirous of studying or is actually studying, (or if he is desirous of
teaching or is teaching,)

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

he may study or teach after having received permission (to do so from
the *S*rotriya).

15-16. He may likewise study or teach in the presence of his teacher, if
(the latter) has addressed him (saying), 'Ho, study! (or, Ho,
teach!)' <span id="fr_268"></span>[15](#fn_267)

17\. When a student desires to study or has finished his lesson, he
shall at both occasions embrace the feet of his teacher. <span
id="fr_269"></span>[17](#fn_268)

18\. Or if, whilst they study, another person comes in, he shall
continue his recitation, after those words, ('Ho, study!') have been
pronounced (by the newcomer). <span id="fr_270"></span>[18](#fn_269)

19\. The barking of (many) dogs, the braying of (many) asses, the cry of
a wolf or of a solitary jackal or of an owl, all sounds of musical
instruments, of weeping, and of the Sâman melodies (are reasons for
discontinuing the study of the Veda). <span
id="fr_271"></span>[19](#fn_270)

20\. If another branch of the Veda (is being recited in the
neighbourhood), the Sâman melodies shall not be studied.

21\. And whilst other noises (are being heard, the recitation of the
Veda shall be discontinued), if they mix (with the voice of the person
studying). <span id="fr_272"></span>[21](#fn_271)

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

22\. After having vomited (he shall not study) until he has slept. <span
id="fr_273"></span>[22](#fn_272)

23\. Or (he may study) having eaten clarified butter (after the attack
of vomiting).

24\. A foul smell (is a reason for the discontinuance of study). <span
id="fr_274"></span>[24](#fn_273)

25\. Food turned sour (by fermentation), which he has in his stomach,
(is a reason for the discontinuance of the recitation, until the sour
rising ceases). <span id="fr_275"></span>[25](#fn_274)

26\. (Nor shall he study) after having eaten in the evening, <span
id="fr_276"></span>[26](#fn_275)

27\. Nor as long as his hands are wet. <span
id="fr_277"></span>[27](#fn_276)

28\. (And he shall discontinue studying) for, a day and an evening,
after having eaten food prepared in honour of a dead person (for whom
the Sapi*nd*î-kara*n*a has not yet been performed), <span
id="fr_278"></span>[28](#fn_277)

29\. Or until the food (eaten on that occasion) is digested. <span
id="fr_279"></span>[29](#fn_278)

30\. But he shall (always) eat in addition (to the meal given in honour
of a dead person), food which has not been given at a sacrifice to the
Manes. <span id="fr_280"></span>[30](#fn_279)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_258"></span>[36:1](sbe0213.htm#fr_259) **10**. The three
full-moon days are Phâlgunî (February-March), Âshâdhî (June-July),
Kârttikî (October-November).

<span id="fn_259"></span>[36:2](sbe0213.htm#fr_260) The construction is
very irregular, the first noun standing in the nominative and the rest
in the locative. A similar irregularity occurs below, I, 3, 11, 3 1. The
Vedotsarga is the ceremony. which is performed at the end of the
Brahmanic term, in January. 'In the case of the death of a Guru, the
vacation begins with the day on which the death occurs. On the other
occasions mentioned he shall not study on the day preceding (the
ceremony), on the day (of the ceremony), nor on the day following
it.'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 119; Yâ*gñ*. I, 144. 'The Gurus' intended
here, are fathers-in-law, uncles, &c.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[36:3](sbe0213.htm#fr_261) 'This rule applies
to a student only. It is known from another work that those who have
been infected by impurity (on the death of a relation), must not study
whilst the impurity lasts. 'Haradatta. Yâ*gñ*. I, 144.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[36:6](sbe0213.htm#fr_262) The word
anubhâvinah, interpreted by Haradatta as 'persons who are younger than
the deceased,' is explained in different ways by others; firstly, as
'the mourners,' and secondly, as 'Samânodakas or gentiles beyond the
sixth degree.' In the latter case the Sûtra ought to be-translated thus:
'On the death of gentiles beyond the sixth degree, (the head) ought to
be shaved.'

<span id="fn_262"></span>[37:7](sbe0213.htm#fr_263) Regarding the Dikshâ
initiation,' see Aitareya-brâhma*n*a I, 1, and Max Müller's History of
Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 309 seq.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[37:8](sbe0213.htm#fr_264) Hence it follows
that the top-lock should not be shaved off, except in the case mentioned
in the following Sûtra.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[37:9](sbe0213.htm#fr_265) Sattras,
'sacrificial sessions,' are sacrifices which last longer than twelve
days.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[37:10](sbe0213.htm#fr_266) 'But in his opinion
it should be twelve days, as declared above, Sûtra 4.'--Haradatta. It
appears, therefore, that this Sûtra is to be connected with Sûtra 4.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[37:11](sbe0213.htm#fr_267) 'Because the word
"death "is used here, death only is the reason (for stopping, the
reading), in the case of Gurus and the rest (i.e. the word "died" must
be understood in Sûtra 2 and the following ones).' --Haradatta.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[38:15](sbe0213.htm#fr_268)-16. Manu II, 73.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[38:17](sbe0213.htm#fr_269) Manu II, 73.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[38:18](sbe0213.htm#fr_270) Haradatta states
rightly, that the plural ('they study') is useless. According to him,
the use of the verb in the singular may be excused thereby, that the
advice is addressed to each of the persons engaged in study. Manu IV,
122.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[38:19](sbe0213.htm#fr_271) The ekas*ri*ka,
'solitary jackal,' is now called Bâlu or Pheough, and is considered to
be the constant companion of a tiger or panther. Its unharmonious cry
is, in the present day also, considered to be an evil omen. Yâ*gñ*. I,
148; Manu IV, 108, 115 and 123.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[38:21](sbe0213.htm#fr_272) Manu IV, 121.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[39:22](sbe0213.htm#fr_273) Manu IV, 121.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[39:24](sbe0213.htm#fr_274) Manu IV, 107;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 150.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[39:25](sbe0213.htm#fr_275) Manu IV, 121.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[39:26](sbe0213.htm#fr_276) 'Therefore he shall
sup, after having finished his study.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[39:27](sbe0213.htm#fr_277) Manu IV, 121;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 149.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[39:28](sbe0213.htm#fr_278) Manu IV, 112;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 146.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[39:29](sbe0213.htm#fr_279) If that food has
not been digested by the end of that time (i.e. in the evening), he
shall not study until it has been digested.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[39:30](sbe0213.htm#fr_280) 'Because in this
Sûtra the expression "food not given at a *S*râddha" occurs, some think
that the preceding Sûtra refers to "food eaten at a
*S*râddha."'--Haradatta. This explanation is not at all improbable.
