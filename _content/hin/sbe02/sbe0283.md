### CHAPTER XIX.

1\. The law of castes and of orders has been declared. <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[1](#fn_1352)

2\. Now, indeed, man (in) this (world) is polluted by a vile action,
such as sacrificing for men unworthy to offer a sacrifice, eating
forbidden food, speaking what ought not to be spoken, neglecting what is
prescribed, practising what is forbidden. <span
id="fr_1354"></span>[2](#fn_1353)

3\. They are in doubt if he shall perform a penance for such (a deed) or
if he shall not do it. <span id="fr_1355"></span>[3](#fn_1354)

4\. (Some) declare, that he shall not do it,

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

5\. Because the deed does not perish. <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[5](#fn_1355)

6\. The most excellent (opinion is), that he shall perform (a
penance). <span id="fr_1357"></span>[6](#fn_1356)

7\. For it is declared in the Veda, that he who has offered a Punastoma
(may) again come to (partake of) the libations of Soma, <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[7](#fn_1357)

8\. Likewise he who has offered a Vrâtyastoma. <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[8](#fn_1358)

9\. (The Veda says) further: 'He who offers a horse-sacrifice, conquers
all sin, he destroys the guilt of the murder of a Brâhma*n*a; <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[9](#fn_1359)

10\. Moreover: 'He shall make an Abhi*s*asta perform an Agnish*t*ut
sacrifice.' <span id="fr_1361"></span>[10](#fn_1360)

11\. Reciting the Veda, austerity, a sacrifice, fasting, giving gifts
are the means for expiating such a (blamable act). <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[11](#fn_1361)

12\. The purificatory (texts are), the Upanishads, the Vedântas, the
Sa*m*hitâ-text of all the Vedas, the (Anuvâkas called) Madhu, the (hymn
of) <span id="fr_1363"></span>[12](#fn_1362)

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Aghamarsha*n*a, the Atharva*s*iras, the
(Anuvâkas called the) Rudras, the Purusha-hymn, the two Sâmans (called)
Râ*g*ana and Rauhi*n*eya, the B*ri*hat (Sâman) and the Rathantara, the
Purushagati (Sâman), the Mahânâmnîs, the Mahâvairâ*g*a (Sâman), the
Mahâdivâkîrtya (Sâman), any of the *G*yesh*th*a Sâmans, the
Bahishpavamâna (Sâman), the Kûshmâ*nd*as, the Pâvamânîs, and the
Sâvitrî.

13\. To live on milk alone, to eat vegetables only, to eat fruits only,
(to live on) barley-gruel prepared of a handful of grain, to eat gold,
to eat clarified butter, and to drink Soma (are modes of living) which
purify. <span id="fr_1364"></span>[13](#fn_1363)

14\. All mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the
dwellings of *Ri*shis, cow-pens, and temples of the gods (are) places
(which destroy sin). <span id="fr_1365"></span>[14](#fn_1364)

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

15\. Continence, speaking the truth, bathing morning, noon, and evening,
standing in wet clothes, sleeping on the ground, and fasting (are the
various kinds of) austerity. <span id="fr_1366"></span>[15](#fn_1365)

16\. Gold, a cow, a dress, a horse, land, sesamum, clarified butter, and
food are the gifts (which destroy sin).

17\. A year, six months, four (months), three (months), two (months),
one (month), twenty-four days, twelve days, six days, three days, a day
and a night are the periods (for penances).

18\. These (acts) may be optionally performed when no (particular
penance) has been prescribed, <span id="fr_1367"></span>[18](#fn_1366)

19\. (Viz.) for great sins difficult (penances), and for trivial faults
easy ones.

20\. The K*rikkh*ra and the Ati*k*r.ik*kh*ra, (as well as) the
*K*ândrâya*n*a, are penances for all (offences). <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1352"></span>[274:1](sbe0283.htm#fr_1353) **XIX**.
Haradatta, thinks that the object of this Sûtra is to assert that in the
following chapter the laws given above for castes and orders must be
kept in mind. Thus penances like offering a Punastoma are not intended
for *S*ûdras, who have no business with Vedic rites, but other penances
are. He also states that another commentator believes that the Sûtra is
meant to indicate that the following rules refer not merely to those men
who belong to castes and orders, but to the Pratilomas also, who have
been declared to stand outside the pale of the sacred law. Haradatta's
opinion appears to be preferable.

<span id="fn_1353"></span>[274:2](sbe0283.htm#fr_1354) 'Ayam purusha*h*,
"man (in) this (world)," indicates the universal soul which is dwelling
in the body. Yâpya, "vile," i.e. despicable (kutsita).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1354"></span>[274:3](sbe0283.htm#fr_1355) 'They, i.e. the
theologians (brahmavâdina*h*).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1355"></span>[275:5](sbe0283.htm#fr_1356) I.e. the guilt
(adharma) contracted by the deed is not effaced before it has produced
its result in the shape of punishment in hell and in other births, see
also Manu X1, 45.

<span id="fn_1356"></span>[275:6](sbe0283.htm#fr_1357) 'Apara, "most
excellent," means that which nothing surpasses, i.e. the settled
doctrine.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1357"></span>[275:7](sbe0283.htm#fr_1358) The Punastoma is
one of the *S*rauta-sacrifices belonging to the class called Ekâha.
Regarding its efficacy, see also Lâ*t*yâyana *S*rauta-sûtra IX, 4, 5.

<span id="fn_1358"></span>[275:8](sbe0283.htm#fr_1359) The Vrâtyastoma
is another Ekâha-sacrifice. Regarding its efficacy, see Yâ*gñ*avalkya I,
38; Lâ*t*yâyana *S*rautra-sûtra VIII 6, 29.

<span id="fn_1359"></span>[275:9](sbe0283.htm#fr_1360)
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a XIII, 3, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_1360"></span>[275:10](sbe0283.htm#fr_1361) The Agnish*t*ut
is an Ekâha-sacrifice. Regarding its efficacy, see Manu XI, 75.

<span id="fn_1361"></span>[275:11](sbe0283.htm#fr_1362) Manu XI, 46,
228; Âpastamba I, 9, 26, 12-I, 9, 27, 11.

<span id="fn_1362"></span>[275:12](sbe0283.htm#fr_1363) 'Those parts of
the Âra*n*yakas which are not (Upanishads) are called Vedântas. In all
the Vedas (*kh*andas), i.e. in all Sâkhâs (prava*k*ana), the
Sa*m*hitâ-text, not the Pada-text, nor the Krama-text. Another
commentator says, "One Sa*m*hitâ is to be made <span id="page_276">p.
276</span> with all the metres, i.e. the Gâyatrî and the rest, and to be
recited according to the manner of the Prâtaranuvâka."'--Haradatta.
According to the same authority, the Madhus are found Taittirîya
Âra*n*yaka X, 38, the hymn of Aghamarsha*n*a Rig-veda X, 190, the Rudras
Taittirîya-Sa*m*hitâ IV, 5, 1-11, and in the corresponding eleven
chapters of all other Ya*g*us-sâkhâs, the Purushasûkta Rig-veda X, 90,
the Kûshmâ*nd*as Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka X, 3-5, the Pâvamânîs Rig-veda
IX, while by Atharva*s*iras the Upanishad, known by that name, is meant.
As regards the Sâmans mentioned in the Sûtra it suffices to refer to
Professor Benfey's Index, Ind. Stud. III, 199, and to Dr. Burnell's
Index of the Ârsheya-brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_1363"></span>[276:13](sbe0283.htm#fr_1364) According to
Haradatta the word iti, which appears in the text at the end of the
enumeration, is intended to include other similar kinds of food, as 'the
five products of the cow.' Eating gold means eating small particles of
gold which have been thrown into clarified butter and the like.

<span id="fn_1364"></span>[276:14](sbe0283.htm#fr_1365) The word iti
used in the text is, according to Haradatta, again to be taken in the
sense of 'and so forth.' The translation of parishkanda, 'a temple,' not
parishkandha, as Professor Stenzler <span id="page_277">p. 277</span>
reads, is based on Haradatta's explanation. Etymologically it seems to
mean 'a place for circumambulation,' and to denote the platform on which
the temples usually stand, and which is used for the Pradakshi*n*a
ceremony.

<span id="fn_1365"></span>[277:15](sbe0283.htm#fr_1366) The word iti in
the text is explained as in the preceding Sûtras.

<span id="fn_1366"></span>[277:18](sbe0283.htm#fr_1367) These (acts),
i.e. the recitation of the Veda and so forth, which have been enumerated
above, Sûtras 11-16.

<span id="fn_1367"></span>[277:20](sbe0283.htm#fr_1368) Regarding these
penances, see chapters XXVI and XXVII. Haradatta again takes the word
iti, which occurs in the text, to include other difficult penances.
