<p><A NAME="page_xlix"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xlix</FONT></A></p>  <h1 align="center">INTRODUCTION TO GAUTAMA</h1>  
<p>COMPARED with the information collected above regarding the origin and the history of &Acirc;pastamba's Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, the facts which can be brought to bear on Gautama's Institutes are scanty and the conclusions deducible from them somewhat vague. There are only two points, which, it seems to me, can be proved satisfactorily, viz. the connection of the work with the S&acirc;ma-veda and a Gautama <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>a, and its priority to the other four Dharma-s&ucirc;tras which we still possess. To go further appears for the present impossible, because very little is known regarding the history of the schools studying the S&acirc;ma-veda, and because the Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra not only furnishes very few data regarding the works on which it is based, but seems also, though not to any great extent, to have been tampered with by interpolators.</p>  
<p>As regards its origin, it was again Professor Max M&uuml;ller, who, in the place of the fantastic statements of a fabricated tradition, according to which the author of the Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra is the son or grandson of the sage Utathya, and the grandson or great-grandson of U<I>s</I>anas or <I>S</I>ukra, the regent of the planet Venus, and the book possessed generally binding force in the second or Tret&acirc; Yuga&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, first put forward a rational explanation which, since, has been adopted by all other writers on Sanskrit literature. He says, Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 134, 'Another collection of Dharma-s&ucirc;tras, which, however, is liable to critical doubts, belongs</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_l"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. l</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to the Gautamas, a <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>a of the S&acirc;ma-veda.' This assertion agrees with Kum&acirc;rila's statement, that the Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra of Gautama and the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra of Gobhila were (originally) accepted (as authoritative) by the <I>Kh</I>andogas or S&acirc;mavedins alone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Kum&acirc;rila certainly refers to the work known to us. For he quotes in other passages several of its S&ucirc;tras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>That Kum&acirc;rila and Professor Max M&uuml;ller are right, may also be proved by the following independent arguments. Gautama's work, though called Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra or Institutes of the Sacred Law, closely resembles, both in form and contents, the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras or Aphorisms on the Sacred Law, which form part of the Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras of the Vedic schools of Baudh&acirc;yana, &Acirc;pastamba, and Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in. As we know from the <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>avy&ucirc;ha, from the writings of the ancient grammarians, and from the numerous quotations in the Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras and other works on the Vedic ritual, that in ancient times the number of Vedic schools, most of which possessed <I>S</I>rauta, G<I>ri</I>hya, and Dharma-s&ucirc;tras, was exceedingly great, and that the books of many of them have either been lost or been disintegrated, the several parts being torn out of their original connection, it is not unreasonable to assume that the aphoristic law-book, usually attributed to the <I>Ri</I>shi Gautama, is in reality a manual belonging to a Gautama <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>a. This conjecture gains considerably in probability, if the fact is taken into account that formerly a school of S&acirc;ma-ved&icirc;s, which bore the name of Gautama, actually existed. It is mentioned in one of the redactions of the <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>avy&ucirc;ha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> as a subdivision of the R&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;yan&icirc;ya school. The Va<I>m</I>sa-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the S&acirc;ma-veda, also, enumerates four members of the Gautama family among the teachers who handed down the third Veda, viz. G&acirc;t<I>ri</I> Gautama, Sumantra B&acirc;bhrava</p>

<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Gautama, Sa<I>m</I>kara Gautama, and R&acirc;dha Gautama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the existing <I>S</I>rauta and G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras frequently appeal to the opinions of a Gautama and of a Sthavira Gautama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. It follows, therefore, that at least one, if not several Gautama <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>as, studied the S&acirc;ma-veda, and that, at the time when the existing S&ucirc;tras of L&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yana and Gobhila were composed, Gautama <I>S</I>rauta and G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras formed part of the literature of the S&acirc;ma-veda. The correctness of the latter inference is further proved by Dr. Burnell's discovery of a Pit<I>ri</I>medha-s&ucirc;tra, which is ascribed to a teacher of the S&acirc;ma-veda, called Gautama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The only link, therefore, which is wanting in order to complete the chain of evidence regarding Gautama's Aphorisms on the sacred law, and to make their connection with the S&acirc;ma-veda perfectly clear, is the proof that they contain special references to the latter. This proof is not difficult to furnish, For Gautama has borrowed one entire chapter, the twenty-sixth, which contains the description of the K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ras or difficult penances from the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na, one of the eight Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as of the S&acirc;ma-veda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The agreement of the two texts is complete except in the Mantras (S&ucirc;tra 12) where invocations of several deities, which are not usually found in Vedic writings, have been introduced. Secondly, in the enumeration of the purificatory texts, XIX, 12, Gautama shows a marked partiality for the S&acirc;ma-veda. Among the eighteen special texts mentioned, we find not less than nine S&acirc;mans. Some of the latter, like the B<I>ri</I>hat, Rathantara, <I>G</I>yesh<I>th</I>a, and Mah&acirc;div&acirc;k&icirc;rtya chants, are mentioned also in works belonging to the <I>Ri</I><I>g</I>-veda and the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, and are considered by Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as of all schools to possess great efficacy. But others, such as the Purushagati, Rauhina, and Mah&acirc;vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a S&acirc;mans, have hitherto not been met with anywhere but in books belonging to the S&acirc;ma-veda, and</p>

<p>do not seem to have stood in general repute. Thirdly, in two passages, I, 50 and XXV, 8; the Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra prescribes the employment of five Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis, and mentions in the former S&ucirc;tra, that the last Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>ti is satyam, truth. Now in most Vedic works, three Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis only, bh&ucirc;<I>h</I>, bhuva<I>h</I>, sva<I>h</I>, are mentioned; sometimes, but rarely, four or seven occur. But in the Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>ti S&acirc;man, as Haradatta points out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, five such interjections are used, and satyam is found among them. It is, therefore, not doubtful, that Gautama in the above-mentioned passages directly borrows from the S&acirc;ma-veda. These three facts, taken together, furnish, it seems to me, convincing proof that the author of our Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra was a S&acirc;ma-vedi. If the only argument in favour of this conclusion were, that Gautama appropriated a portion of the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na, it might be met by the fact that he has also taken some S&ucirc;tras (XXV, 1-6), from the Taittir&icirc;ya &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka. But his partiality for S&acirc;mans as purificatory texts and the selection of the Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis from the Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>ti S&acirc;man as part of the Mantras for the initiation (1, 50), one of the holiest and most important of the Brahmanical sacraments, cannot be explained on any other supposition than the one adopted above.</p>  
<p>Though it thus appears that Professor Max M&uuml;ller is right in declaring the Gautama Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra to belong to the S&acirc;ma-veda, it is, for the present, not possible to positively assert, that it is the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra of that Gautama <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>a, which according to the <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>avy&ucirc;ha quoted in the Sabdakalpadruma of R&acirc;dh&acirc;kanta, formed a subdivision of the R&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;yas. The enumeration of four &Acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ryas, bearing the family-name Gautama, in the Va<I>m</I>sa-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and L&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yana's quotations from two Gautamas, make it not unlikely, that several Gautama <I>K</I>ara<I>n</I>as once existed among the S&acirc;ma-vedi Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, and we possess no means for ascertaining to which our Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra must be attributed. Further researches into the history of the schools of the S&acirc;ma-veda must be awaited until we can do more. Probably the living tradition of the S&acirc;ma-ved&icirc;s of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_liii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. liii</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Southern India and new books from the South will clear up what at present remains uncertain.</p>  
<p>In concluding this subject I may state that Haradatta seems to have been aware of the connection of Gautama's law-book with the S&acirc;ma-veda, though he does not say it expressly. But he repeatedly and pointedly refers in his commentary to the practices of the <I>Kh</I>andogas, and quotes the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra of the <I>G</I>aimin&icirc;yas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, who are a school of S&acirc;ma-ved&icirc;s, in explanation of several passages. Another southern author, Govindasv&acirc;min (if I understand the somewhat corrupt passage correctly), states directly in his commentary on Baudh&acirc;yana I, 1, 2, 6, that the Gautam&icirc;ya Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra was originally studied by the <I>Kh</I>andogas alone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>In turning now to the second point, the priority of Gautama to the other existing Dharma-s&ucirc;tras, I must premise that it is only necessary to take into account two of the latter, those of Baudh&acirc;yana and Vasish<I>th</I>a. For, as has been shown above in the Introduction to &Acirc;pastamba, the S&ucirc;tras of the latter and those of Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in Satydsh&acirc;<I>dh</I>a are younger than Baudh&acirc;yana's. The arguments which allow us to place Gautama before both Baudh&acirc;yana and Vasish<I>th</I>a are, that both those authors quote Gautama as an authority on law, and that Baudh&acirc;yana has transferred a whole chapter of the Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra to his work, which Vasish<I>th</I>a again has borrowed from him.</p>  
<p>As regards the case of Baudh&acirc;yana, his references to Gautama are two, one of which can be traced in our Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra. In the discussion on the peculiar customs prevailing in the South and in the North of India (Baudh. Dh. 1, 2, 1-8) Baudh&acirc;yana expresses himself as follows:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_liv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. liv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'1. There is a dispute regarding five (practices) both in the South and in the North.</p>  
<p>'2. We shall explain those (peculiar) to the South.</p>  
<p>'3. They are, to eat in the company of an uninitiated person, to eat in the company of one's wife, to eat stale food, to marry the daughter of a maternal uncle or of a paternal aunt.</p>  
<p>'4. Now (the customs peculiar) to the North are, to deal in wool, to drink rum, to sell animals that have teeth in the upper and in the lower jaws, to follow the trade of arms and to go to sea.</p>  
<p>'5. He who follows (these practices) in (any) other country than the one where they prevail commits sin.</p>  
<p>'6. For each of these practices (the rule of) the country should be (considered) the authority.</p>  
<p>'7, Gautama declares that this is false.</p>  
<p>'8. And one should not take heed of either (set of practices), because they are opposed to the tradition of those learned (in the sacred law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>).'</p>  
<p>From this passage it appears that the Gautama Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, known to Baudh&acirc;yana, expressed an opinion adverse to the authoritativeness of local customs which might be opposed to the tradition of the <I>S</I>ish<I>t</I>as, i.e. of those who really deserve to be called learned in the law. Our Gautama teaches the same doctrine, as he says, XI, 20, 'The laws of countries, castes, and families, which are not opposed to the (sacred) records, have also authority.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_lv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. lv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>As clear as this reference, is the case in which Baudh&acirc;yana has borrowed a whole chapter of our Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra. The chapter in question is the nineteenth, which in Gautama's work forms the introduction to the section on penances and expiation. It is reproduced with a number of various readings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the third Pra<I>s</I>na of Baudh&acirc;yana's Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, where it forms the tenth and last Adhy&acirc;ya. Its contents, and especially its first S&ucirc;tra which connects the section on penances with the preceding ones on the law of castes and orders, make it perfectly clear that its proper position can only be at the beginning of the rules on expiation, not in the middle of the discussion, as Baudh&acirc;yana places it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. This circumstance alone would be sufficient to prove that Baudh&acirc;yana is the borrower, not Gautama, even if the name of the latter did not occur in Baudh&acirc;yana's Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. But the character of many of Baudh&acirc;yana's readings, especially of those in S&ucirc;tras 2, 10, 5 11, 13, and 15, which, though supported by all the MSS. and Govindasv&acirc;min's commentary, appear to have arisen chiefly through clerical mistakes or carelessness, furnishes</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_lvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. lvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>even an additional argument in favour of the priority of Gautama's text. It must, however, be admitted that the value of this point is seriously diminished by the fact that Baudh&acirc;yana's third Pra<I>s</I>na is not above suspicion and may be a later addition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>As regards Baudh&acirc;yana's second reference to Gautama, the opinion which it attribute, to the latter is directly opposed to the teaching of our Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra. Baudh&acirc;yana gives II, 2, 4, 16 the rule that a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who is unable to maintain himself by teaching, sacrificing, and receiving gifts, may follow the profession of a Kshatriya, and then goes on as follows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:</p>  
<p>'17. Gautama declares that he shall not do it. For the duties of a Kshatriya are too cruel for a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.'</p>  
<p>As the commentator Govindasv&acirc;min also points out, exactly the opposite doctrine is taught in our Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, which (VII, 6) explicitly allows a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a to follow, in times of distress the occupations of a Kshatriya. Govindasv&acirc;min explains this contradiction by assuming that in this case Baudh&acirc;yana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> cites the opinion, not of the author of our Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, but of some other Gautama. According to what has been said above&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the existence of two or even more ancient Gautama Dharma-s&ucirc;tras is not very improbable, and the commentator may possibly be right. But it seems to me more likely that the S&ucirc;tra of Gautama (VII, 6) which causes the difficulty is an interpolation, though Haradatta takes it to be genuine. My reason for considering it to be spurious is that the permission to follow the trade of arms is opposed to the sense of two other rules of Gautama. For the author states at the end of the same chapter on times of distress, VII, 25, that 'even a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a may take up arms when his life is in danger.' The meaning of these words can only be, that a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a must not fight under any other circumstances.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_lvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. lvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> But according to S&ucirc;tra 6 he is allowed to follow the occupations of a Kshatriya, who lives by fighting. Again, in the chapter on funeral oblations, XV, 18, those Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as 'who live by the use of the bow' are declared to defile the company at a funeral dinner. It seems to me that these two S&ucirc;tras, taken together with Baudh&acirc;yana's assertion that Gautama does not allow Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as to become warriors, raise a strong suspicion against the genuineness, of VII. 6, and I have the less hesitation in rejecting the latter S&ucirc;tra, as there are several other interpolated passages in the text received by Haradatta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Among them I may mention here the Mantras in the chapter taken from the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na, XXVI, 12, where the three invocations addressed to Siva are certainly modern additions, as the old S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ras do not allow a place to that or any other Paur&acirc;<I>n</I>ic deity in their works. A second interpolation will be pointed out below.</p>  
<p>The V&acirc;sish<I>th</I>a Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. shows also two quotations from Gautama; and it is a curious coincidence that, just as in the case of Baudh&acirc;yana's references, one of them only can be traced in our Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra. Both the quotations occur in the section on impurity, V&acirc;s. IV, where we read as follows '&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:</p>  
<p>'33. If an infant aged less than two years, dies, or in the case of a miscarriage, the impurity of the Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as (lasts) for three (days and) nights.</p>  
<p>'34. Gautama declares that (they become) pure at once (after bathing).</p>  
<p>'35. If (a person) dies in a foreign country and (his Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as) hear (of his death) after the lapse of ten days, the impurity lasts for one (day and) night.</p>  
<p>'36. Gautama declares that if a person who has kindled the sacred fire dies on a journey, (his Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as) shall again</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_lviii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. lviii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>celebrate his obsequies, (burning a dummy made of leaves or straw,) and remain impure (during ten days) as (if they had actually buried) the corpse.'</p>  
<p>The first of these two quotations or references apparently points to Gautama Dh. XIV, 44, where it is said, that 'if an infant dies, the relatives shall be pure at once.' For, though Vasish<I>th</I>a's S&ucirc;tra 34, strictly interpreted, would mean, that Gautama declares the relatives to be purified instantaneously, both if an infant dies and if a miscarriage happens, it is also possible to refer the exception to one of the two cases only, which are mentioned in S&ucirc;tra 33. Similar instances do occur in the S&ucirc;tra style, where brevity is estimated higher than perspicuity, and the learned commentator of Vasish<I>th</I>a does not hesitate to adopt the same view. But, as regards the second quotation in S&ucirc;tra 36, our Gautama contains no passage to which it could possibly refer. Govindasv&acirc;min, in his commentary on the second reference to Gautama in Baudh&acirc;yana's Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra II, 2, 71, expresses the opinion that this S&ucirc;tra, too, is taken from the 'other' Gautama Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, the former existence of which he infers from Baudh&acirc;yana's passage. And curiously enough the regarding the second funeral -actually is found in the metrical V<I>ri</I>ddha-Gautama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or Vaish<I>n</I>ava Dharma-<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, which, according to Mr. V&acirc;man Sh&acirc;str&icirc; Isl&acirc;mpurkar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, forms chapters 94-115 of the A<I>s</I>vamedha-parvan of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata in a Malay&acirc;lam MS. Nevertheless, it seems to me very doubtful if Vasish<I>th</I>a did or could refer to this work. As the same rule occurs sometimes in the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, I think it more probable that the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra of the Gautama school is meant. And it is significant that the V<I>ri</I>ddha-Gautama declares its teaching to be kalpa<I>k</I>odita 'enjoined in the Kalpa or ritual.'</p>  
<p>Regarding Gautama's nineteenth chapter, which appears in the Vasish<I>th</I>a Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra as the twenty-second, I have</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_lix"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. lix</FONT></A></p>  
<p>already stated above that it is not taken directly from Gautama's work, but from Baudh&acirc;yana's. For it shows most of the characteristic readings of the latter. But a few new ones also occur, and some S&ucirc;tras have been left out, while one new one, a well-known verse regarding the efficacy of the Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara vratapati and of the Pavitresh<I>t</I>i, has been added. Among the omissions peculiar to Vasish<I>th</I>a, that of the first S&ucirc;tra is the most important, as it alters the whole character of the chapter, and removes one of the most convincing arguments as to its original position at the head of the section on penances. Vasish<I>th</I>a places it in the beginning of the discussion on penances which are generally efficacious in removing guilt, and after the rules on the special penances for the classified offences.</p>  
<p>These facts will, I think, suffice to show that the Gautama Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra may be safely declared to be the. oldest of the existing works on the sacred law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. This assertion must, however, not be taken to mean, that every single one of its S&ucirc;tras is older than the other four Dharma-s&ucirc;tras. Two interpolations have already been pointed out above&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and another one will be discussed presently. It is also not unlikely that the wording of the S&ucirc;tras has been changed occasionally. For it is a suspicious fact that Gautama's language agrees closer with P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini's rules than that of &Acirc;pastamba and Baudh&acirc;yana. If it is borne in mind that Gautama's work has been torn out of its original connection, and from a school-book has become a work of general authority, and that for a long time it has been studied by Pandits who were brought up in the traditions of classical grammar, it seems hardly likely that it could retain much of its ancient peculiarities of language. But I do not think that the interpolations and alterations can have affected the general character of the book very much. It is too methodically planned and too carefully arranged to admit of any very great changes. The fact, too, that in</p>

<p>the chapter borrowed by Baudh&acirc;yana the majority of the variae lectiones are corruptions, not better readings, favours this view. Regarding the distance in time between Gautama on the one hand, and Baudh&acirc;yana and Vasish<I>th</I>a on the other, I refer not to hazard any conjecture, as long as the position of the Gautamas among the schools of the S&acirc;ma-veda has not been cleared up. So much only can be said that Gautama probably was less remote from Baudh&acirc;yana than from Vasish<I>th</I>a. There are a few curious terms and rules in which the former two agree, while they, at the same time, differ from all other known writers on Dharma. Thus the term bhikshu, literally a beggar, which Gautama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> uses to denote an ascetic, instead of the more common yati or sanny&acirc;sin, occurs once also in Baudh&acirc;yana's S&ucirc;tra. The same is the case with the rule, III, 13, which orders the ascetic not to change his residence during the rains. Both the name bhikshu and the rule must be very ancient, as the <I>G</I>ainas and Buddhists have borrowed them, and have founded on the latter their practice of keeping the Vasso, or residence in monasteries during the rainy season.</p>  
<p>As the position of the Gautamas among the S&acirc;man schools is uncertain, it will, of course, be likewise inadvisable to make any attempt at connecting them with the historical period of India. The necessity of caution in this respect is so obvious that I should not point it out, were it not that the Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra contains one word, the occurrence of which is sometimes considered to indicate the terminus a quo for the dates of Indian works. The word to which I refer is Yavana. Gautama quotes, IV, 21, an opinion of 'some,' according to which a Yavana is the offspring of a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra male and a Kshatriya female. Now it is well known that this name is a corruption of the Greek &#7992;&#0945;&#0989;&#0969;&#0957;, an Ionian, and that in India it was applied, in ancient times, to the Greeks, and especially to the early Seleucids who kept up intimate relations with the first Mauryas, as well as later to the Indo-Bactrian and Indo-Grecian kings who from the beginning of the second century B. C. ruled</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_lxi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. lxi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>over portions of north-western India. And it has been occasionally asserted that an Indian work, mentioning the Yavanas, cannot have been composed before 300 B. C., because Alexander's invasion first made the Indians acquainted with the name of-the Greeks. This estimate is certainly erroneous, as there are other facts, tending to show that at least the inhabitants of north-western India became acquainted with the Greeks about 200 years earlier&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But it is not advisable to draw any chronological conclusions from Gautama's S&ucirc;tra, IV, 21. For, as, pointed out in the note to the translation of S&ucirc;tra IV, 18, the whole section with the second enumeration of the mixed castes, IV, 17-21, is probably spurious.</p>  
<p>The information regarding the state of the Vedic literature, which the Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra furnishes, is not very extensive. But some of the items are interesting, especially the proof that Gautama knew the Taittir&icirc;ya &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, from which he took the first six S&ucirc;tras of the twenty-fifth Adhy&acirc;ya; the S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, from which the twenty-sixth Adhy&acirc;ya has been borrowed; and the Atharva<I>s</I>iras, which is mentioned XIX, 12. The latter word denotes, according to Haradatta, one of the Upanishads of the Atharva-veda, which usually are not considered to belong to a high antiquity. The fact that Gautama and Baudh&acirc;yana knew it, will probably modify this opinion. Another important fact is that Gautama, XXI, 7, quotes Manu, and asserts that the latter declared it to be impossible to expiate the guilt incurred by killing a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, drinking spirituous liquor, or violating a Guru's bed. From this statement it appears that Gautama knew an ancient work on law which was attributed to Manu. It probably was the foundation of the existing M&acirc;nava Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. No other teacher on law, besides Manu, is mentioned by name. But the numerous references to the opinions of 'some' show that Gautama's work was not the first Dharma-s&ucirc;tra.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have to add a few words regarding the materials on which the subjoined translation is based. The text published by Professor Stenzler for the Sanskrit Text Society has been used as the basis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It has been collated with a rough edition, prepared from my own MSS. P and C, a MS. belonging to the Collection of the Government of Bombay, bought at Belg&acirc;m, and a MS. borrowed from a Pu<I>n</I>a <I>S</I>&acirc;str&icirc;. But the readings given by Professor Stenzler and his division of the S&ucirc;tras have always been followed in the body of the translation. In those cases, where the variae lectiones of my MSS. seemed preferable, they have been given and translated in the notes. The reason which induced me to adopt this course was that I thought it more advisable to facilitate references to the printed Sanskrit text than to insist on the insertion of a few alterations in the translation, which would have disturbed the order of the S&ucirc;tras. The notes have been taken from the above-mentioned rough edition and from my MSS. of Haradatta's commentary, called Gautam&icirc;y&acirc; Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc;, which are now deposited in the India Office Library, Sansk. MSS. B&uuml;hler, Nos. 165-67.</p>
