### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 1, KHA*ND*A 1.

1\. After marriage the rites prescribed for a householder and his wife
(must be performed). <span id="fr_527"></span>[1](#fn_526)

2\. He shall eat at the two (appointed) times, (morning and
evening) <span id="fr_528"></span>[2](#fn_527)

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

3\. And he shall not eat to repletion.

4\. And both (the householder and his wife) shall fast on (the days of)
the new, and full moon,

5\. To eat once (on those days in the morning) that also is called
fasting. <span id="fr_529"></span>[5](#fn_528)

6\. And they may eat (at that meal) until they are quite satisfied.

7\. And on (the anniversary of) that (wedding)-day they may eat that
food of which they are fond. <span id="fr_530"></span>[7](#fn_529)

8\. And (on the night of that day) they shall sleep on the ground (on a
raised heap of earth). <span id="fr_531"></span>[8](#fn_530)

9\. And they shall avoid connubial intercourse.

10\. And on the day after (that day) a Sthâlîpâka must be offered. <span
id="fr_532"></span>[10](#fn_531)

11\. The manner in which that offering must be <span
id="fr_533"></span>[11](#fn_532)

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

performed has been declared by (the description of the Sthâlîpâka) to be
performed on the days of the new and full moon (the Pârva*n*a).

12\. And they declare (that this rite which is known) amongst the people
(must be performed) every (year). <span id="fr_534"></span>[12](#fn_533)

13\. At every (burnt-offering), when he wishes to place the fire on the
altar (called Stha*nd*ila), let him draw on that (altar) three lines
from west to east and three lines from south to north, and sprinkle (the
altar) with water, turning the palm of the hand downwards, and let him
then make the fire burn brightly by adding (fuel). <span
id="fr_535"></span>[13](#fn_534)

14\. He shall pour out (the remainder of) this water used for
sprinkling, to the north or to the east (of the altar), and take other
(water into the vessel).

15\. The water-vessels in the house shall never be empty; that is the
duty to be observed by the householder and his wife. <span
id="fr_536"></span>[15](#fn_535)

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

16\. Let him not have connubial intercourse (with his wife) in the

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_526"></span>[99:1](sbe0236.htm#fr_527) **1**. According to
Haradatta, this rule is intended to refute the opinion of those who hold
that the sacred household-fire may be kept, and the prescribed offerings
therein may be performed, either from the time of the marriage, or after
the division of the family estate. He also states that the use of the
dual g*ri*hamedhino*h* indicates that husband and wife must perform the
rites conjointly. Manu III, 67.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[99:2](sbe0236.htm#fr_528) Haradatta thinks
that this Sûtra is intended to prevent householders from having more
than two meals a day, and to keep them from gluttony. Others are of
opinion that its object is to keep householders from excessive fasting,
and to make them perform the Prâ*n*âgnihotra at either meal. At the
Prâ*n*âgnihotra the sacrificer eats five mouthfuls invoking
successively, whilst he <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> eats, the five
vital airs. At the first mouthful he says, 'To Prâ*n*a svâhâ;' at the
second, 'To Apâna svâhâ,' &c.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[100:5](sbe0236.htm#fr_529) Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû.
I, 10, 2.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[100:7](sbe0236.htm#fr_530) Haradatta holds
that the words 'on that day' do not refer to the days of the new and
full moon, the Parvan-days, mentioned in Sûtra 4. His reasons are,
first, that the permission to eat food, of which the householder may be
particularly fond, has already been given in Sûtra 6, by the term
t*ri*pi*h*, 'satisfaction'; and, secondly, that the singular 'on this
day' does not agree with the plural 'on the Parvan-days.' Hence he comes
to the conclusion that the words 'on that day' must refer to the
wedding-day, mentioned in Sûtra 1, as well as to its anniversary.
Haradatta is, probably, right in his explanation, though the reasons
adduced here are very weak. A stronger reason for detaching this Sûtra
from Sûtra 4 will be brought forward below, under Sûtra 11. Mahâdeva,
the commentator of the Hira*n*yake*s*idharma, adopts the view rejected
by Haradatta.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[100:8](sbe0236.htm#fr_531) Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû.
I, 3, 10.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[100:10](sbe0236.htm#fr_532) A Sthâlîpâka is an
offering at which rice cooked in a pot, sthâlî, is offered in the fire.
A full description of this kind of sacrifice occurs, Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû.
I, 10, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[100:11](sbe0236.htm#fr_533) The Pârva*n*a
Sthâlîpâka has been described by Âpastamba <span id="page_101">p.
101</span> in the G*ri*hya-sûtra, III, 7. Again, Haradatta returns to
the question whether the words on that day (Sûtra 7) refer to the
Parvan-days, or the marriage-day and its anniversaries. He now adds, in
favour of the latter view, that the word Pârva*n*ena, 'by the rite to be
performed on Parvan-days,' by which the Sthâlîpâka on Parvan-days is
intended, clearly proves the impossibility to refer he preceding rules
to the Parvan-days. He adds that some, nevertheless, adopt the
explanation rejected by himself.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[101:12](sbe0236.htm#fr_534) They, i.e. the
*S*ish*t*as, those learned in the law. 'Another commentator says, the
rite which will be taught (in the following Sûtra), and which is known
from the usage of the learned, is constant, i.e. must be performed in
every case. That it is what the "learned" declare.'--Haradatta. The
latter explanation of the Sûtra is adopted by Mahâdeva.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[101:13](sbe0236.htm#fr_535) Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû.
I, 3, 1-3.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[101:15](sbe0236.htm#fr_536) Haradatta states
that the object of the repetition of the words 'the householder and his
wife' is to show that they themselves must fill the water-vessels, and
not employ others for this purpose. He adds that, according to another
commentator, the object of the repetition is to show that Sûtras 13 and
14 apply not only to householders, but also to students, and that hence
students, when they offer the daily oblations of sacred fuel (above, I,
1, 4, 14 seq.), should also perform the rites taught in the preceding
Sûtras.

46-48; Yâ*gñ*. I, 79, 80.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[102:18](sbe0236.htm#fr_538) Manu III, 45;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 81.
