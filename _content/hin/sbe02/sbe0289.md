### CHAPTER XXV.

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

1\. Now they say: 'How many (gods) does a student enter who violates the
vow of chastity?' <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1](#fn_1451)

2\. (And they answer): 'His vital spirits (go to) the Maruts (winds),
his strength to Indra, his eminence in sacred learning to B*ri*haspati,
all the remaining parts to Agni.' <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[2](#fn_1452)

3\. He kindles the fire in the night of the new moon, and offers, by way
of penance, two oblations of clarified butter, <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[3](#fn_1453)

4\. (Reciting these two sacred texts), 'Defiled by lust am I, defiled am
I, oh Lust; to Lust svâhâ;' 'Injured by lust am I, injured am I, oh
Lust; to Lust svâhâ.' (Next) he (silently) places one piece of sacred
fuel (on the fire), sprinkles water round the fire, offers the
Ya*gñ*avâstu (oblation), and approaching (the fire) worships it, thrice
(reciting the text), 'May the waters sprinkle me.' <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[4](#fn_1454)

5\. These worlds are three; in order to conquer

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

these worlds, in order to gain mastership over these worlds, (this rite
must be performed.)

6\. According to some, the above (described) rite is a penance (for all
hidden offences) in general, (and they say) regarding it, 'He who may be
impure, as it were, shall offer burnt-oblations in this manner, and
shall recite sacred texts in this manner; the fee (of the officiating
priest shall be) whatever he may choose.'

7\. He who has been guilty of cheating, of calumniating, of acting
contrary to the rule of conduct, of eating or drinking things forbidden,
of connection with a woman of the *S*ûdra caste, of an unnatural crime,
and even of performing magic rites with intent (to harm his enemies),
shall bathe and sprinkle himself with water, reciting the texts
addressed to the Waters, or those addressed to Varu*n*a, or other
purificatory texts. <span id="fr_1456"></span>[7](#fn_1455)

8\. For offences committed by speaking or thinking of forbidden things,
the five Vyâh*ri*tis (must be recited). <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[8](#fn_1456)

9\. Or for all (offences) he may sip water, (reciting) in the morning
(the text), 'May the day and the sun purify me;' and in the evening,
'The night and Varu*n*a.'

10\. Or he may offer eight pieces of sacred fuel, <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[10](#fn_1457)

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (reciting the texts beginning) 'Devak*ri*tasya.'
By merely offering them he becomes free from all sin.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1451"></span>[294:1](sbe0289.htm#fr_1452) **XXV**. For this
and the following five Sûtras, see Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka II, 18, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_1452"></span>[294:2](sbe0289.htm#fr_1453) 'All the
remaining parts, i.e. his sight and the other organs of sense, go to
Agni. Thus a student who has broken the vow of chastity becomes
short-lived, weak, destitute of eminence in sacred learning, and
destitute of sight, and so forth. Therefore a penance must be
performed.'--Haradatta. It must, of course, be understood that the
penance prescribed here, is a 'secret penance.'

<span id="fn_1453"></span>[294:3](sbe0289.htm#fr_1454) 'He, i.e. the
unchaste student, shall kindle the fire in the night of the new moon,
i.e. at midnight, in the manner declared in the
G*ri*hya-sûtra.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1454"></span>[294:4](sbe0289.htm#fr_1455) Haradatta says
that while sprinkling water the performer shall recite the texts 'Aditi,
thou hast permitted,' see Âpastamba II, 2, 3, 17 note. The Ya*gñ*avâstu
oblation, which follows after the Svish*t*ak*ri*t offering, is described
Gobhila G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 8, 26-29.

<span id="fn_1455"></span>[295:7](sbe0289.htm#fr_1456) Âpastamba I, 9,
26, 7. The verses addressed to the Waters are, Rv. X, 9, 1-3 = Taitt.
Sa*m*h. IV, 1, 5, 1, and Taitt. Sa*m*h. V, 6, 1. Regarding those
addressed to Varu*n*a, see above, XXIII, 28. As an instance of 'other
purificatory texts' Haradatta quotes Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a I, 4, 81, 1.

<span id="fn_1456"></span>[295:8](sbe0289.htm#fr_1457) Regarding the
five Vyâh*ri*tis, see above, I, 51.

<span id="fn_1457"></span>[295:10](sbe0289.htm#fr_1458) Haradatta gives
the following four Mantras: Devak*ri*tasyainasovaya*g*anam asi svâhâ,
'thou art the expiation for sin committed <span id="page_296">p.
296</span> by the gods,' svâhâ pit*ri*k*ri*tasyainaso . . . svâhâ,
manushyak*ri*tasyainaso . . . svâhâ, asmatk*ri*tasyainaso . . . svâhâ.
But see Vâ*g*asaneyi-Sa*m*hitâ VIII, 13, where eight Mantras are given,
and below, XXVII, 7.
