<p>A Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a declares: Since a devout student takes away from women, who refuse (to give him alms, the merit gained) by (<I>S</I>rauta)-sacrifices, by gifts, (and) by burnt-offerings (offered in the domestic fire), as well as their offspring, their cattle, the sacred learning (of their families), therefore, indeed, (a woman) should not refuse (alms) to the crowd of students; for amongst those (who come to beg), there might be one of that (devout) kind, one who thus (conscientiously) keeps his vow.</p>  
<p>27. Alms (shall) not (be considered) leavings (and be rejected) by inference from their appearance), but on the strength of ocular or oral testimony (only).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A></p>

<p>43. Alms are declared to be sacrificial food. In regard to them the teacher (holds the position which) a deity (holds in regard to food offered at a sacrifice).</p>  
<p>44. And (the teacher holds also the place which) the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire occupies (at a sacrifice, because a portion of the alms is offered in the fire of his stomach).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A></p>

Haradatta: 'Apap&acirc;tras are called those born from a high-caste mother and a low-caste father, such as washermen. For their cooking vessels &amp;c. are unfit for the use of the four castes. . . .

<P><A NAME="fn_161"></A><A HREF="sbe0206.htm#fr_162">12:28</A> The formula to be used by a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is, 'Lady, give alms;' that to be used by a Kshatriya, 'Give, lady, alms;' and that used by a Vai<I>s</I>ya, 'Give alms, lady.'

<P><A NAME="fn_165"></A><A HREF="sbe0206.htm#fr_166">13:35</A> 'The meaning of this S&ucirc;tra is, that the rule given, S&ucirc;tra 42 (below), for a pupil who is on a journey, shall hold good also for a pupil who is at home, if (in the absence of his teacher) no <I>S</I>rotriyas are to be found (from whom he can receive the permission to eat).'--Haradatta.</P>
