</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">PRA<I>S</I>NA I, PA<I>T</I>ALA 9, KHA<I>N</I><I>D</I>A 24.</h3>  
<p>1. He who has killed a Kshatriya shall give a thousand cows (to Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as) for the expiation of his sin.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_454"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. (He shall give) a hundred cows for a Vai<I>s</I>ya,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_455"></A><A HREF="#fn_454"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>3. Ten for a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_455"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. And in every one (of these cases) one bull (must be given) in excess (of the number of cows) for the sake of expiation.</p>  
<p>5. And if women of the (three castes mentioned have been slain) the same (composition must be paid).</p>  
<p>6. He who has slain a man belonging to the two (first-mentioned castes) who has studied the Veda, or had been initiated for the performance of a Soma-sacrifice, becomes an Abhi<I>s</I>asta.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>7. And (he is called an Abhi<I>s</I>asta) who has slain a man belonging merely to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a caste (though he has not studied the Veda or been initiated for a Soma-sacrifice),</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A></p>  
<p>8. Likewise he who has destroyed an embryo of a (Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, even though its sex be) undistinguishable,</p>  
<p>9. Or a woman (of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a caste) during her courses.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_458"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. (Now follows) the penance for him (who is an Abhi<I>s</I>asta).</p>  
<p>11. He (himself) shall erect a hut in the forest, restrain his speech, carry (on his stick) the skull (of the person slain) like a flag, and cover the space from his navel to his knees with a quarter of a piece of hempen cloth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_458"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>12. The path for him when he goes to a village, is the space between the tracks (of the wheels).</p>  
<p>13. And if he sees another (&Acirc;rya), he shall step out of the road (to the distance of two yards).</p>  
<p>14. He shall go to the village, carrying a broken tray of metal of an inferior quality.</p>  
<p>15. He may go to seven houses only, (crying,) 'Who will give alms to an Abhi<I>s</I>asta?'</p>  
<p>16. That is (the way in which he must gain) his livelihood.</p>  
<p>17. If he does not obtain anything (at the seven houses), he must fast.</p>  
<p>18. And (whilst performing this penance) he must tend cows.</p>  
<p>19. When they leave and enter the village, that is the second occasion (on which he may enter) the village.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></p>  
<p>20. After having performed (this penance) for twelve years, he must perform) the ceremony known (by custom), through which he is re-admitted into the society of the good.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>21. Or (after having performed the twelve years' penance), he may build a hut on the path of robbers, and live there, trying to take from them the cows of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as. He is free (from his sin), when thrice he has been defeated by them, or when he has vanquished them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_461"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>22. Or he is freed (from his sin), if (after the twelve years' penance) he bathes (with the priests) at the end of a horse-sacrifice.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_462"></A><A HREF="#fn_461"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>  
<p>23. This very same (penance is ordained) for him who, when his duty and love of gain come into conflict, chooses the gain.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A></p>  
<p>24. If he has slain a Guru or a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, who has studied the Veda and finished the ceremonies of a Soma-sacrifice, he shall live according to this very same rule until his last breath.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A></p>  
<p>25. He cannot be purified in this life. But his sin is removed (after death).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_453"></A><A HREF="sbe0227.htm#fr_454">78:1</A> <b>24</b>. Manu XI, 128; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. III, 266. Others explain the phrase vairay&acirc;tan&acirc;rtham, 'for the expiation of his sin,' thus: 'He, who is <A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A> slain by anybody, becomes, in dying, an enemy of his slayer (and thinks), "O that I might slay him in another life," for the removal of this enmity!'--Haradatta. I am strongly inclined to agree with the other commentator, and to translate vairay&acirc;tan&acirc;rtham, 'in order to remove the enmity.' I recognise in this fine a remnant of the law permitting compositions for murder which was in force in ancient Greece and among the Teutonic nations. With the explanation adopted by Haradatta, it is impossible to find a reasonable interpretation for pr&acirc;ya<I>s</I><I>k</I>ittirtha<I>h</I>, S&ucirc;tra 4. Haradatta, seduced by the parallel passage of Manu, takes it to be identical with vairay&acirc;tan&acirc;rtham. I propose to translate our S&ucirc;tra thus: 'He who has killed a Kshatriya shall give a thousand cows (to the relations of the murdered man) in order to remove the enmity.' According to Baudh&acirc;yana I, 10. 19. 1 (compare Zeitschr. d. D. Morg. Ges., vol. 41, pp. 672-76; Festgruss an Roth, pp. 44-52), the cows are to be given to the king.</P>

This S&ucirc;tra is to be construed with S&ucirc;tra 14, S&ucirc;tras 12 and 13 being inserted parenthetically.--Haradatta. Manu XI, 72-78; Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. III, 243.</P>
