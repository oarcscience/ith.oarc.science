This is a short guide to modern western Raja Yoga, illustrated by a
couple of dozen photos of yogic postures (asanas). This little book is a
surprisingly comprehensive introduction to the metaphysical background
of yogic practice, along with a host of related practical matters.

The exercises introduced here are all fairly easy and well-described.
When this was written, Yoga teachers were far and few between in the US,
so this was by necessity a self-help guide. While, strictly speaking, I
wouldn't recommend trying these exercises (particularly the mental ones)
without a teacher, at least it isn't hard to find Yoga classes any more.

In the [first chapter (p. 7)](rwy02.htm#page_7), Liebers traces
stereotypical misconceptions of Yoga by mid-century Americans to
sideshow performers and "supposedly esoteric literature." By the latter
one infers is meant the 'Yogi Publication Society' books, for instance,
[Raja Yoga](../../eso/ryo/index), which bears comparison with this book.
