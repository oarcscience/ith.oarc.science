<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Harih-Om</span>. Then&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> &#256;&#347;wal&#257;yana went to Lord Paramesht&#299; (Brahm&#257;) and addressed Him thus: "Please initiate me into Brahmavi&#7693;y&#257; (Divine Wisdom), which is the most excellent, which is ever enjoyed by the wise, which is mystic, and by which the learned, after having soon freed themselves from all sins, reach Purusha, the Supreme of the supreme."</p>  
<p>To him the Grandfather (thus);replied: "Know (It) through &#346;ra&#7693;&#7693;h&#257; (faith), Bhak&#7789;i (devotion), &#7692;hy&#257;na (meditation), and Yoga. Persons attain salvation not through Karma, progeny or wealth but through Sanny&#257;sa (renunciation) alone. Ascetics of pure mind through (the realisation of) the meaning well-ascertained by Ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;a-Vij&ntilde;&#257;na and through &#346;anny&#257;sa-Yoga enter into That which is above Swarga (heaven) and is in the cave (of the heart). They all attain Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the Brahma-world and are (finally) emancipated.</p>  
<p>"Being seated in a pleasant posture in an unfrequented place with a pure mind, and with his neck, head, and body erect, having given up the duties of the (four) orders of life, having subjugated all the organs, having saluted his Guru with devotion, having looked upon the heart (-lotus) as being free from Rajogu&#7751;a and as pure, and having contemplated in its (heart's) centre Parame&#347;wara who is always with His consort &#362;ma, who is pure and free from sorrow, who is unthinkable and invisible, who is of endless forms, who is of the nature of happiness,</p>

<p>who is very quiescent, who is of the form of emancipation, who is the source of M&#257;y&#257;, who has no beginning, middle or end, who is One, who is All-Pervading, who is Chi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a (Consciousness-Bliss), who is formless, who is wonderful, who is the Lord (of all), who has three eyes, who has a blue neck, (N&#299;laka&#7751;tha), and who is serenity (itself)&#8212;the Muni attains Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, the womb of all elements, the All-Witness, and above lamas. He only is Brahma. He only is &#346;iva. He only is In&#7693;ra. He only is the indestructible. He only is the Supreme. He only is the Self-Shining. He only is Vish&#7751;&#363;. He only is Pr&#257;&#7751;a. He only is Time. He only is Agni (fire). He only is the moon. He only is all things that exist or will hereafter exist. He only is eternal. Having known Him, one crosses death. There is no other path to salvation. He only attains Parabrahman who sees in himself all elements and himself in all elements. There is no other means. Having constituted his body an Ara&#7751;i (the lower attritional piece of wood) and Pra&#7751;ava (Om), the upper Ara&#7751;i, a wise man burns Aj&ntilde;&#257;na by the churning of meditation.</p>  
<p>"It is only He (Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;) who, deluded by M&#257;y&#257;, assumes a body with the internal organs and does everything. It is only He who in the waking state is gratified with women, food, drink, and other diverse enjoyments. In the dreaming state, the J&#299;va enjoys pleasures and pains in the several worlds which are created by His M&#257;y&#257;. In the dreamless sleeping state when all are absorbed, He, replete with &#7788;amas, attains the state of happiness. Then through the force of the Karmas of previous births, that J&#299;va again wakes up and goes to sleep. All the diversified objects (of the universe) emanate from the J&#299;va, who sports in the three bodies (gross, subtle and causal). The three bodies are finally absorbed in Him who is the source of all, who is Bliss, and who is Absolute Wisdom. From Him, arise Pr&#257;&#7751;a, Manas, all the organs of sense and action, &#256;k&#257;&#347;, V&#257;yu, Agni, water and the earth supporting all. Parabrahman, which is of all forms, which is the Supreme Abode of this universe, which is the most subtle of the subtle and which is eternal, is only yourself. You are</p>  
<p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></A></p>  
<p>only That. One who knows himself to be that Parabrahman that shines as the universe in the waking, dreaming, dreamless and other states, will be relieved from all bondage. I am that Sa&#7693;&#257;&#347;iva, (or the eternal happiness) who is other than the enjoyer, the enjoyed, and the enjoyment in the three seats (or bodies), and who is witness and Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. All emanate from Me alone. All exist in Me alone. All merge into Me alone. I am that non-dual Brahman. I am the atom of atoms; so am I the biggest (of all). I am this diversified universe. I am the oldest of all. I am Purusha. I am &#298;&#347;a (the Lord). I am of the form of Jyo&#7789;is (light) and of the form of happiness. I have neither hands nor feet. I have power unthinkable. I see without eyes. I hear without ears. I am omniscient. I have one kind of form only. None is able to know Me fully. I am always of the form of Chi&#7789;. I am the One that should be known through all the Ve&#7693;as. I am the Guru who revealed the Ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;a. I am only He who knows the true meaning of Ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;a. I have no sins or virtues. I have no destruction. I have no birth, body, organs of sense or action, or Bu&#7693;&#7693;hi. To Me there is no earth, water or fire. There is no V&#257;yu; there is no &#256;k&#257;&#347;. He who thinks Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; as being in the cave (of the heart), as having no form, as being secondless, as being the witness of all and as being neither Sa&#7789; nor Asa&#7789;, attains the pure form of Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;.</p>  
<p>"Whoever recites this Upanisha&#7693; belonging to Yajurve&#7693;a, he becomes as pure as Agni (fire). He becomes purified from the sins of theft of gold. He becomes purified from the sins of drinking alcohol. He becomes purified from the sins of murder of a Brahman. He becomes purified from the sins of commission (of those that ought not to be done) and the sins of omission (of those that ought to be done). Therefore he becomes a follower of Br&#257;hman. Were one who has stepped beyond the duties of the four orders of life to recite (this Upanisha&#7693;) always or even once, he acquires the wisdom that destroys the ocean of Sams&#257;ra. Therefore having known Him, he attains the Kaivalya State (or state of isolation or emancipation)&#8212;yea, he attains the Kaivalya State."</p>
