<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> One Aja (unborn) is ever located in the cave (of the heart) within the body. (P&#7771;&#7789;hiv&#299;) the earth is His body; though He pervades the earth, it does not know Him. The waters are His body; though He pervades the waters, they do not know Him. Agni is His body; though He pervades agni, it does not know Him. V&#257;yu is His body; though He pervades v&#257;yu, it does not know Him. &#256;k&#257;&#347; is His body; though He pervades &#257;k&#257;&#347;, it does not know Him. Manas is His body; though He pervades manas, it does not know Him. Bu&#7693;&#7693;hi is His body; though He pervades bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, it does not know Him. Aha&#7749;k&#257;ra is His body; though He pervades aha&#7749;k&#257;ra, it does not know Him. Chi&#7789;&#7789;a is His body; though He pervades chi&#7789;&#7789;a, it does not know Him. Avyak&#7789;a is His body; though He pervades avyak&#7789;a, it does not know Him. Akshara is His body; though He pervades akshara, it does not know Him. M&#7771;&#7789;yu is His body; though He pervades m&#7771;&#7789;yu, it does not know Him. He who is the inner soul of all creatures and the purifier of sins, is the one divine Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a.</p>  
<p>The wise should through the practice of deep meditation of Brahman leave off the (recurrent) conception of "I" and mine" in the body and the senses which are other than &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Having known himself as Pra&#7789;yag&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, the witness of bu&#7693;&#7693;hi and its actions, one should ever think "So&#8217;ham" ("I am That") and leave off the idea of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; in all others. Shunning the pursuits of the world, the body and the &#346;&#257;s&#7789;ras, set about removing the false attribution of self. In the case of a Yogin staying always in his own &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, his mind parishes having known his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as the &#256;&#7789;m&#257; of all, through inference, Ve&#7693;as</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></A></p>  
<p>and self-experience. Never giving the slightest scope to sleep, worldly talk, sounds, etc., think of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, (in yourself) to be the (supreme) &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Shun at a distance like a cha&#7749;d&#257;la (the thought of) the body, which is generated out of the impurities of parents and is composed of excreta and flesh. Then you will become Brahman and be (in a) blessed (state). O Sage, having dissolved (J&#299;va-) &#256;&#7789;m&#257; into Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; with the thought of its being partless, like the ether of a jar in the universal ether, be ever in a state of taciturnity. Having become that which is the seat of all &#256;&#7789;m&#257;s and the self-resplendent, give up the macrocosm and microcosm like an impure vessel. Having merged into Chi&#7693;&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, which is ever blissful, the conception of "I" which is rooted in the body, and having removed the (conception of) Li&#7749;ga (here the sign of separateness), become ever the Kevala (alone). Having known "I am that Brahman" in which alone the universe appears like a town in a mirror, become one that has performed (all) his duty, O sinless one. The ever-blissful and the self-effulgent One being freed from the grip of aha&#7749;k&#257;ra attains its own state, like the spotless moon becoming full (after eclipse).</p>  
<p>With the extinction of actions, there arises the extinction of chin&#7789;&#257;. From it arises the decay of v&#257;san&#257;s; and from the latter, arises moksha; and this is called J&#299;vanmuk&#7789;i. Looking upon everything in all places and times as Brahman brings about the destruction of v&#257;san&#257;s through the force of v&#257;san&#257;s of s&#257;&#7789;&#7789;vic nature. Carelessness in Brahmanishth&#257; by (or meditation of Brahman) should not in the least be allowed (to creep in). Knowers of Brahman style (this) carelessness, in Br&#257;hmic science, as death (itself). Just as the moss (momentarily) displaced (in a tank) again resumes its original position, in a minute, so M&#257;y&#257; envelops even the wise, should they be careless (even for a moment). He who attains the Kaivalya state during life becomes a Kevala even after death of his body. Ever devoted to sam&#257;&#7693;hi, become a nirvikalpa (or the changeless one), O sinless. one. The gran&#7789;hi (or knot) of the heart, full of aj&ntilde;&#257;na, is broken completely only when one sees his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as secondless through nirvikalpa sam&#257;&#7693;hi.</p>  
<p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></A></p>  
<p>Now, having strengthened the conception of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and well given up that of "I" in the body, one should be indifferent as he would be towards jars, cloth, etc. From Brahma down to a pillar, all the up&#257;&#7693;his are only unreal. Hence one should see (or cognize) his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as all-full and existing by itself (alone). Brahma is Swayam (&#256;&#7789;m&#257;); Vish&#7751;u is &#256;&#7789;m&#257;; Ru&#7693;ra is: &#256;&#7789;ma; In&#7693;ra is &#256;&#7789;m&#257;; all this universe is &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and there is nothing but &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. By expelling (from the mind) without any remainder all objects which are superimposed on one's &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, one becomes himself Parabrahman the full, the secondless and the actionless. How can there be the heterogeneity of the universe of sa&#7749;kalpa and vikalpa in that One Principle which is immutable, formless and homogeneous? When there is no difference between the seer, the seen, and sight, there being the decayless and Chi&#7693;&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, full like the ocean at the end of a Kalpa and effulgent, all darkness, the cause of false perception, merges in it. How can there be heterogeneity in that one supreme Principle which is alike? How can there be heterogeneity in the highest &#7788;a&#7789;&#7789;va which is One? Who has observed any heterogeneity in sushup&#7789;i (the dreamless sleep), where there is happiness only? This vikalpa has its root in chi&#7789;&#7789;a only. When chi&#7789;&#7789;a is not, there is nothing. Therefore unite the chi&#7789;&#7789;a with Param&#257;&#7789;man in its Pra&#7789;y&#257;g&#257;&#7789;mic state. If one knows &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as unbroken bliss in itself, then he drinks always the juice (or essence) of bliss in his &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, whether internally or externally.</p>  
<p>The fruit of vair&#257;gya is bo&#7693;ha (spiritual wisdom); the fruit of bo&#7693;ha is upara&#7789;i (renunciation); &#347;&#257;n&#7789;i (sweet patience) is attained out of the enjoyment of the bliss of one's Ming, and this &#347;&#257;n&#7789;i is the fruit of upara&#7789;i. If the latter in each of these is absent, the former is useless. Niv&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;i (or the return path) leads to the highest contentment and (spiritual) bliss is said to be beyond all analogy. That which has M&#257;y&#257; as its up&#257;&#7693;hi is the womb of the world; that true one which has the attribute of omniscience, etc., and has the variegated mystery is denoted by the word "&#7788;a&#7789;" (that). That is called Apara (the other or inferior) which shines through meditation upon the idea and the</p>  
<p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></A></p>  
<p>world asma&#7789;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the consciousness of which is developed by anta&#7717;kara&#7751;a. By separating the up&#257;&#7693;his M&#257;y&#257; and avi&#7693;y&#257; from Para and J&#299;va (cosmic and human &#256;&#7789;m&#257;s respectively), one realises Parabrahman which is partless and Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a. Making the mind dwell upon such sentences (or ideas) as the above constitutes &#347;rava&#7751;a (hearing). It becomes manana (contemplation) when such ideas are quieted (in one) through logical reasoning. When (their) meaning is confirmed through these (two processes), the concentration of the mind on it alone constitutes ni&#7693;i&#7693;hy&#257;sana. That is called sam&#257;&#7693;hi in which the chi&#7789;&#7789;a, rising above the conception of the contemplator and contemplation, merges gradually into the contemplated, like a light undisturbed by the wind. Even the mental states are not known (at the time when one is within the scope of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;). But they are only inferred from the recollection which takes place after sam&#257;&#7693;hi. Through this sam&#257;&#7693;hi are destroyed crores of karmas which have accumulated during cycles of births without beginning and pure &#7693;harma is developed. Knowers of Yoga call this sam&#257;&#7693;hi, &#7693;harma-megha (cloud), inasmuch as it showers nectarine drops of karma in great quantities, when all the hosts of v&#257;san&#257;s are destroyed entirely through this, and when the accumulated karmas, virtuous and sinful, are rooted out. Then that in which speech was hidden till now, appears no longer so, and shines as Sa&#7789;; and direct cognition reveals itself, like the myrobalan in the palm of the hand. Vair&#257;gya begins from where the v&#257;san&#257;s cease to arise towards objects of enjoyment. The cessation of the rising of the idea of "I" is the highest limit of bu&#7693;&#7693;hi; upara&#7789;i begins from where the mental states once destroyed do not again arise. That ascetic is said to possess S&#7789;hi&#7789;apraj&ntilde;&#257; who enjoys bliss always and whose mind is absorbed in Brahman that is formless and actionless. That state of mind is termed praj&ntilde;&#257; that realises the oneness of Brahman and &#256;&#7789;m&#257; after deep inquiry, and that has the v&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;i of nirvikalpa and chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. He who possesses this always is a Jivanmuk&#7789;a. He is a Jivanmuk&#7789;a who has, neither the conception of "I" in the body and the senses, nor</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></A></p>  
<p>the conception of another (different from himself) in everything else. He is a Jivanmuk&#7789;a who sees through his praj&ntilde;&#257; no difference between his own &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and Brahman as well as between Brahman and the universe. He is a Jivanmuk&#7789;a who preserves equanimity of mind, either when revered by the good or reviled by the vicious. One who has cognized the true nature of Brahman is not subject to rebirth as before. But were he so subjected, then he is not a true knower, the knowing of Brahman being external only. A man is subject to pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> so long as he is affected by pleasure, etc. The attainment of a result is always preceded by action; and nowhere is it without karma. Through the cognition "I am Brahman" are destroyed the karmas accumulated during hundreds of crores of previous births, like the actions in the dreaming state (that are destroyed) during the waking state.</p>  
<p>An ascetic having known himself as associateless and indifferent like ether, is not at all affected by any of his karmas at any time. Just as the ether is not affected by the alcoholic smell through its contact with a pot, so &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is not affected by the gu&#7751;as produced by its up&#257;&#7693;hi. The pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha karma that has begun to act before the dawn of j&ntilde;&#257;na is not checked by it; and one should reap its fruit, as in the case of an arrow discharged at a target. An arrow that is discharged towards an object with the idea that it is a tiger, does not stop when it (the tiger) is found to be a cow; but it (even) pierces the mark through its speed, without stopping. When one realises his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as free from old age and death, then how will pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha affect him? Pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha accomplishes (its work) only when one considers his body as At ma. This conception of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as body is not at all a desirable one; so it should be given up along with pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha, since it is simply a delusion to attribute pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha to this body. How can there be reality to that which is superimposed upon another? How can there be birth to that which is not real? How can there be death to that which is not born? How can there be pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha to that which is unreal? The Ve&#7693;a speaks of pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha in an external sense only, to satisfy those</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></A></p>  
<p>foolish persons that doubt, saying: "If j&ntilde;&#257;na can destroy all the results of aj&ntilde;&#257;na (such as body, etc.), then whence is the existence of this body to such a one?" but not to inculcate to the wise the existence of the body.</p>  
<p>&#256;&#7789;m&#257; is all-full, beginningless, endless, immeasurable, unchangeable, replete with Sa&#7789;, Chi&#7789;, and &#256;nan&#7693;a, decayless, the one essence, the eternal, the differentiated, the plenum, the endless, having its face everywhere, the one that can neither be given up nor taken up, the one that can neither be supported nor be made to support, the gu&#7751;aless, the actionless, the subtle, the changeless, the stainless, the indescribable, the true nature of one's &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, above the reach of speech and mind, the one full of Sa&#7789;, the self-existent, the immaculate, the enlightened, and the incomparable; such is Brahman, one only without a second. There are not in the least many. He who knows his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; himself through his own cognition, as the one who is not restricted by any, is a Si&#7693;&#7693;ha (one that has accomplished his object), who has identified his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; with the one changeless &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Whither is this world gone, then? How did it appear? Where is it absorbed? It was seen by me just now, but now it is gone. What a great miracle! What is fit to be taken in? and what to be rejected? What is other (than &#256;&#7789;m&#257;)? And what is different (from It)? In this mighty ocean of Brahman full of the nectar of undivided bliss, I do not see, hear, or know anything. I remain in my &#256;&#7789;m&#257; only and in my own nature of Sa&#7789;, &#256;nan&#7693;ar&#363;pa. I am an asa&#7749;ga (or the associateless). I am an asa&#7749;ga. I am without any attributes. I am Hari (the Lord taking away sin). I am the quiescent, the endless, the all-full and the ancient. I am neither the agent nor the enjoyer.</p>  
<p>I am the changeless and the decayless. I am of the nature of pure enlightenment. I am the one and the perpetual bliss.</p>  
<p>This science was imparted to Ap&#257;n&#7789;ara&#7789;ama who gave it to Brahma,. Brahma gave it to Ghora-A&#7749;giras. Ghora-A&#7749;giras gave it to Raikva, who gave it to R&#257;ma. And R&#257;ma gave it to all beings. This is the teaching of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a; and this is the teaching of the Ve&#7693;as; yea, this is the teaching of the Ve&#7693;as. Thus ends the Upanisha&#7693;.</p>
