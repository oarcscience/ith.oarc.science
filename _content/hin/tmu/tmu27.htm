<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gau&#7789;ama</span> addressed Sana&#7789;kum&#257;ra thus: "O Lord, thou art the knower of all &#7693;harmas and art well versed in all &#346;&#257;s&#7789;ras, pray tell me the means by which I may obtain a knowledge of Brahmavi&#7693;y&#257;. Sana&#7789;kum&#257;ra replied thus:</p>  
<p>"Hear, O Gau&#7789;ama, that &#7788;a&#7789;&#7789;va as expounded by P&#257;rva&#7789;&#299; after inquiring into all &#7693;harmas and ascertaining &#346;iva's opinion. This treatise on the nature of Hamsa which gives the fruit of bliss and salvation and which is like a treasure to the yogin, is (a) very mystic (science) and should not be revealed (to the public).</p>  
<p>"Now we shall explain the true nature of Hamsa and Paramahamsa for the benefit of a brahmach&#257;rin (a seeker after Brahman or celibate), who has his desires under control, is devoted to his guru and always contemplates (as) Hamsa, and realises thus: It (Hamsa) is permeating all bodies like fire (or heat) in all kinds of wood or oil in all kinds of gingelly seeds. Having known (It) thus, one does not meet with death.</p>  
<p>"Having contracted the anus (with the heels pressed against it), having raised the v&#257;yu (breath) from (M&#363;la)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> &#256;dh&#257;ra</p>

The &#346;isna&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (penis) has two sides (left and right from head to foot). This is that Paramahamsa (Supreme Hamsa or Higher Self) having the resplendence of crores of suns and by whom all this world is pervaded.</p>  
<p>"It (this Hamsa which has bu&#7693;&#7693;hi as vehicle)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> has eightfold v&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;i. (When it is) in the eastern&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> petal, there is the inclination (in a person) to virtuous actions; in the south-eastern petal, there arise sleep, laziness, etc.; in the southern, there is the inclination to cruelty; in the south-western, there is the inclination to sins; in the western, there is the inclination to sensual sport; in the north-western, there arise the desire of walking, and others; in the northern, there arises the desire of lust; in the north-eastern, there arises the desire of amassing money; in the middle (or the interspaces between the petals), there is the indifference to material pleasures. In the filament (of the lotus), there arises the waking state; in the pericarp, there arises the svapna (dreaming state); in the b&#299;ja (seed of pericarp), there arises the sushup&#7789;i (dreamless sleeping state); when leaving the lotus, there is the &#7789;urya (fourth state). When Hamsa is absorbed in N&#257;&#7693;a (spiritual sound), the state beyond the fourth is reached. N&#257;&#7693;a (which is at the end of sound and beyond speech and mind) is like a pure crystal extending from (M&#363;la) &#256;dh&#257;ra to Brahmaran&#7693;hra. It is that which is spoken of as Brahma and Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;.</p>

Then A&#7749;gany&#257;sas and Karany&#257;sas occur (or should be performed after the man&#7789;ras as they are performed before the man&#7789;ras) in the heart and other (seats). Having done so, one should contemplate upon Hamsa as the &#256;&#7789;m&#257; in his heart. Agni and Soma are its wings (right and left sides); Omk&#257;ra is its head; Uk&#257;ra and bin&#7693;u are the three eyes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and face respectively; Ru&#7693;ra and Ru&#7693;r&#257;&#7751;&#299; (or Ru&#7693;ra's wife) are the feet kantha&#7789;a (or the realisation of the oneness of j&#299;v&#257;&#7789;m&#257; or Hamsa, the lower self with Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; or Paramahamsa, the Higher Self) is done in two ways, (sampraj&ntilde;&#257;&#7789;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and asampraj&ntilde;&#257;&#7789;a).</p>  
<p>"After that, Unman&#299;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> is the end of the Ajap&#257; (man&#7789;ra). Having thus reflected upon manas by means of this (Hamsa), one hears N&#257;&#7693;a after the uttering of this japa (man&#7789;ra) a crore of times. It (N&#257;&#7693;a) is (begun to be heard as) of ten kinds. The first is chini (like the sound of that word); the second is chini-chini; the third is the sound of bell; the fourth is that of conch; the fifth is that of &#7789;an&#7789;ri (lute); the sixth is that sound of &#7789;&#257;la (cymbals); the seventh is that of flute; the eighth is that of bheri (drum); the ninth is that of m&#7771;&#7693;a&#7749;ga (double drum); and the tenth is that of clouds (<i>viz</i>., thunder). He may experience the tenth without the first nine sounds (through the initiation of</p>

<p>a guru). In the first stage, his body becomes chini-chini; in the second, there is the (bha&ntilde;jana) breaking (or affecting) in the body; in the third, there is the (bhe&#7693;ana) piercing; in the fourth, the head shakes; in the fifth, the palate produces saliva; in the sixth, nectar is attained; in the seventh, the knowledge of the hidden (things in the world) arises; in the eighth, Par&#257;v&#257;k is heard; in the ninth, the body becomes invisible and the pure divine eye is developed; in the tenth, he attains Parabrahman in the presence of (or with) &#256;&#7789;m&#257; which is Brahman. After that, when manas is destroyed, when it which is the source of sa&#7749;kalpa and vikalpa disappears, owing to the destruction of these two, and when virtues and sins are burnt away, then he shines as Sa&#7693;&#257;&#347;iva of the nature of &#346;ak&#7789;i pervading everywhere, being effulgence in its very essence, the immaculate, the eternal, the stainless and the most quiescent Om. Thus is the teaching of the Ve&#7693;as; and thus is the Upanisha&#7693;."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_154"></A><A HREF="tmu27.htm#fr_168">212:1</A> This word "Hamsa" is very mysterious and has manifold meanings according to different standpoints. It is composed of Ham (or Aham) and Sa (ha), which mean "I" (am) "that". In its highest sense, it is K&#257;lahamsa (or Parabrahman). It is also Brahm&#257; when he has Hamsa (or swan) as the vehicle or Hamsa-v&#257;hana. When Hamsa which is the manifestation of Pr&#257;&#7751;a is applied to the human breath, we are said to exhale with Ha and to inhale with Sa. It is also called Ajap&#257;-G&#257;ya&#7789;r&#299;.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_160"></A><A HREF="tmu27.htm#fr_174">214:1</A> One commentator gives the table for 21,600 thus: 60 breaths make one Pr&#257;&#7751;a; 6 Pr&#257;&#7751;as, one n&#257;di; and 60 n&#257;dis, one day and night.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_161"></A><A HREF="tmu27.htm#fr_175">214:2</A> The words are: S&#363;ry&#257;ya, Som&#257;ya, Nira&ntilde;jan&#257;ya, Nirabh&#257;s&#257;ya. It is with the pronunciation of these words that the different places in the body are touched, <i>viz</i>., A&#7749;gany&#257;sas and Karany&#257;sas are performed. The first word is pointed to the heart with the thumb; the second, to the head, and the third, to the hair of the head. With the last, a kavacha (armour) is made by circling the fingers round the head and then circling one hand over another. This process is carried on again after the pronunciation of Ajap&#257; man&#7789;ra which follows. Here Soma (moon) is that which is united with Thai or the emblem of the union of the lower and higher Selves. S&#363;rya or Sun is the causer of the state of one-ness.</P>
