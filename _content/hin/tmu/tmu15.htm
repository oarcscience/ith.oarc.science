<p>[This Upanisha&#7693; is intended to give a complete and clear idea of the nature of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, that has four avas&#7789;h&#257;s (states of consciousness) and four seats, for the better consummation of the nirgu&#7751;a &#7693;hy&#257;na.]</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>. &#346;aunaka Mah&#257;&#347;ala questioned the holy Sage Pippal&#257;&#7693;a of the A&#7749;giras go&#7789;ra thus: "In this beautiful Brahmapura of body, the fit residence of divine beings, how are (the deities of) v&#257;k, etc., located? How do they function? To whom belongs this power? He to whom this power belongs, what is He?"</p>  
<p>Pippal&#257;&#7693;a then having deeply considered, imparted to him the Brahmavi&#7693;y&#257; (divine wisdom), that most excellent of all things. "It is pr&#257;&#7751;a (<i>i.e.</i>,) &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. It is &#256;&#7789;m&#257; that exercises this power. It is the life of all &#7692;evas. It is their death and (their) life. Brahman that shines pure, nishkala, resplendent, and all-pervading, in this divine Brahmapura (of body), rules (all). The J&#299;va (identifying himself with) the in&#7693;riyas, rules them like a spider. The spider throws out from a single thread out of his body a whole web, and draws it into himself by that same thread; so pr&#257;&#7751;a, whenever it goes, draws after it the objects of its creation (v&#257;k, etc.). During sushup&#7789;i, (the pr&#257;&#7751;a) goes to its seat (Brahman) through the n&#257;dis of which is the &#7693;eva&#7789;&#257;, like an eagle, that making air as the means of communication, reaches his abode. They say, as &#7693;eva&#7693;a&#7789;&#7789;a, though beaten (during sushup&#7789;i) by a stick, etc., does not move, so also the actor does not suffer or enjoy for the</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></A></p>  
<p>merits or demerits of religious actions. Just as a child obtains happiness without desiring for it (in play), so also &#7693;eva&#7693;a&#7789;&#7789;a obtains happiness in sushup&#7789;i. He certainly knows, (being) Param-Jyo&#7789;is, and the person desiring jyo&#7789;is, enjoys bliss in the contemplation of jyo&#7789;is. Then he comes back to the dream-plane by the same way, like a caterpillar. It remaining on a blade of grass, first puts forward its foot on another blade in front, conveys its body to it, and having got a firm hold of it, then only leaves the former and not before. So this is the j&#257;gra&#7789;a state. As this (&#7693;eva&#7693;a&#7789;&#7789;a) bears at the same time eight skulls, so this j&#257;gra&#7789;a, the source of &#7692;evas and Ve&#7693;as, clings to a man like the breasts in a woman. During the j&#257;gra&#7789;a avas&#7789;h&#257;, merit and demerit are postulated of this Deva (power); he is capable of great expansion and is the inner mover. He is khaga (bird), karkata (crab), pushkara (&#257;k&#257;&#347;), pr&#257;&#7751;a, pain, par&#257;para, &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and Brahman. This deity causes to know. He who knows thus obtains Brahman, the supreme, the support of all things, and the Kshe&#7789;raj&ntilde;a. He obtains Brahman, the supreme, support of all things, and the Kshe&#7789;raj&ntilde;a.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> "The Pursuha has four seats&#8212;navel, heart, neck, and head. There Brahman with the four feet specially shines. Those feet are j&#257;gra&#7789;a, svapna, sushup&#7789;i, and &#7789;urya. In j&#257;gra&#7789;a he is Brahm&#257;, in svapna Vish&#7751;u, in sushup&#7789;i Ru&#7693;ra, and in &#7789;urya the supreme Akshara. He is A&#7693;i&#7789;ya, Vish&#7751;u, &#298;&#347;vara, Purusha, pr&#257;&#7751;a, j&#299;va, agni, the resplendent. The Para-Brahman shines in the midst of these. He is without manas, ear, hands, feet, and light. There the worlds are no worlds, &#7692;evas no &#7692;evas, Ve&#7693;as no Ve&#7693;as, sacrifices no sacrifices, mother no mother, father no father, daughter-in-law no daughter-in-law, cha&#7749;d&#257;la no cha&#7749;d&#257;la, paulkasa no paulkasa, &#347;rama&#7751;a no &#347;rama&#7751;a, hermits no hermits; so one only Brahman shines as different. In the H&#7771;&#7693;ay&#257;k&#257;&#347; (&#257;k&#257;&#347; in the heart) is the Chi&#7693;&#257;k&#257;&#347;. That is Brahman. It is extremely subtle. The H&#7771;&#7693;ay&#257;k&#257;&#347; can be known. This moves in it. In Brahman, everything is strung. Those who thus know the Lord know everything. In him the &#7692;evas, the worlds, the Pi&#7789;&#7771;s and the &#7770;shis do not rule. He who has awakened knows everything.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> All the &#7692;evas are in the heart; in the heart are all the pr&#257;&#7751;as: in the heart are pr&#257;&#7751;a, jyo&#7789;is and that three-plied holy thread. In the heart in Chai&#7789;anya, it (pr&#257;&#7751;a) is. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Put on the yaj&ntilde;opav&#299;&#7789;a (holy thread), the supreme, the holy, which came into existence along with the Praj&#257;pa&#7789;i, which gives long life and which is very excellent; let this give you strength and &#7789;ejas. The wise man having shaved his head completely, should throw away the external thread. He should wear, as the holy thread, the supreme and indestructible Brahman. It is called s&#363;&#7789;ra, because s&#363;chan&#257;&#7789; (indicating) (that the &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is in the heart). S&#363;&#7789;ra means the supreme abode. He who knows that s&#363;&#7789;ra is a vipra (br&#257;hma&#7751;a), he has crossed the ocean of the Ve&#7693;as. On that s&#363;&#7789;ra (thread), everything is strung, like the beads on the thread. The yogin, well versed in yoga and having a clear perception of Truth, should wear the thread. Practising the noble yoga, the wise man should abandon the external thread. He who wears the s&#363;&#7789;ra as Brahman, he is an intelligent being. By wearing the s&#363;&#7789;ra, he is not polluted. They whose s&#363;&#7789;ra is within, whose yaj&ntilde;opav&#299;&#7789;a is j&ntilde;&#257;na&#8212;they only know the s&#363;&#7789;ra, and, they only wear the yaj&ntilde;opav&#299;&#7789;a in this world. Those whose tuft of hair is j&ntilde;&#257;na, who are firmly grounded in j&ntilde;&#257;na and whose yaj&ntilde;opav&#299;&#7789;a is j&ntilde;&#257;na, consider j&ntilde;&#257;na only as supreme. J&ntilde;&#257;na is holy and excellent. He whose &#347;ikh&#257; (tuft of hair) is j&ntilde;&#257;na like the &#347;ikhi (flame of agni)&#8212;he, the wise one, only wears a true &#347;ikh&#257;; others wear a mere tuft of hair. Those br&#257;hma&#7751;as and others who perform the ceremonies prescribed in the Ve&#7693;as&#8212;they wear this thread only as a symbol of their ceremonies. Those who know the Ve&#7693;as say that he only is a true br&#257;hma&#7751;a who wears the &#347;ikh&#257; of j&ntilde;&#257;na and whose yaj&ntilde;opav&#299;&#7789;a is the same (j&ntilde;&#257;na). This yaj&ntilde;opav&#299;&#7789;a (Yaj&ntilde;a means Vish&#7751;u or sacrifice and Upav&#299;&#7789;a is that which surrounds; hence that which surrounds Vish&#7751;u) is supreme and is the supreme refuge. He who wears that really knows&#8212;he only wears the s&#363;&#7789;ra, he is Yaj&ntilde;a (Vish&#7751;u) and he only knows Yaj&ntilde;a (Vish&#7751;u). One God hidden in all things, pervades all things and is the Inner Life of all things. He awards the fruits</p>

<p>of karma, he lives in all things, he sees all things without any extraneous help, he is the soul of all, there is nothing like him, and he is without any gu&#7751;as (being secondless). He is the great wise one. He is the one doer among the many action-less objects. He is always making one thing appear as several (by m&#257;y&#257;). Those wise men who see him in bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, they only obtain eternal peace. Having made &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as the (upper) ara&#7751;i (attritional piece of wood) and Pra&#7751;ava the lower ara&#7751;i, by constant practice of &#7693;hy&#257;na one should see the concealed deity. As the oil in the sesamum seed, as the ghee in the curds, as the water in the rivers, and as the fire in the ara&#7751;i, so they who practise truth and austerities see Him in the bu&#7693;&#7693;hi. As the spider throws out and draws into itself the threads, so the j&#299;va goes and returns during the j&#257;gra&#7789;a and the svapna states. The heart is in the form of a closed lotus-flower, with its head hanging down; it has a hole in the top. Know it to be the great abode of All. Know that during j&#257;gra&#7789;a it (j&#299;va) dwells in the eye, and during svapna in the throat; during sushup&#7789;i, it is in the heart and during &#7789;urya in the head. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (Because bu&#7693;&#7693;hi unites) the Pra&#7789;yag&#257;&#7789;ma with the Param&#257;&#7789;ma, the worship of san&#7693;hy&#257; (union) arose. So we should perform san&#7693;hy&#257;van&#7693;ana (rites). The san&#7693;hy&#257;van&#7693;ana performed by &#7693;hy&#257;na requires no water. It gives no trouble to the body or the speech. That which unites all things is the san&#7693;hy&#257; of the one-staffed (sanny&#257;sins). Knowing That from which speech and mind turn back without being able to obtain it and That which is the bliss of j&#299;va, the wise one is freed. The secret of Brahmavi&#7693;y&#257; is to reveal the real nature of the &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, that is all-pervading, that is like ghee in the milk, that is the source of &#257;&#7789;mavi&#7693;y&#257; and &#7789;apas and to show that everything is in essence one.</p>  
<p>"So ends the Brahmopanisha&#7693;."</p>
