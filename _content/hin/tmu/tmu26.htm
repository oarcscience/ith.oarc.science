<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Even</span> if sin should accumulate to a mountain extending over many yojanas (distance), it is destroyed by &#7693;hy&#257;nayoga. At no time has been found a destroyer of sins like this. B&#299;j&#257;kshara (seed-letter) is the supreme bin&#7693;u. N&#257;&#7693;a (spiritual sound) is above it. When that n&#257;&#7693;a ceases along with letter, than the n&#257;&#7693;a-less is supreme state. That yogin who considers as the highest that which is above n&#257;&#7693;a, which is an&#257;ha&#7789;a,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> has all his doubts destroyed. If the point of a hair be divided into one-hundred thousand parts, this (n&#257;&#7693;a) is one-half of that still further divided; and when (even) this is absorbed, the yogin attains to the stainless Brahman. One who is of a firm mind and without the delusion (of sensual pleasures) and ever resting in Brahman, should see like the string (in a rosary of beads) all creatures (as existing) in &#256;&#7789;m&#257; like odour in flowers, ghee in milk, oil in gingelly seeds and gold in quartz. Again just as the oil depends for its manifestation upon gingelly seeds and odour upon flowers, so does the Purusha depend for its existence upon the body, both external and internal. The tree is with parts and its shadow is without parts but with and without parts, &#256;&#7789;m&#257; exists everywhere.</p>  
<p>The one akshara (letter <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>) should be contemplated upon as Brahman by all who aspire for emancipation. P&#7771;&#7789;hiv&#299;, agni, &#7771;gve&#7693;a, bh&#363;&#7717; and Brahm&#257;&#8212;all these (are absorbed) when Ak&#257;ra</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (A), the first am&#347;a (part) of pra&#7751;ava (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>) becomes absorbed. An&#7789;ariksha, yajurve&#7693;a, v&#257;yu, bhuva&#7717; and Vish&#7751;u, the Jan&#257;r&#7693;ana&#8212;all these (are absorbed) when Uk&#257;ra (U), the second am&#347;a of pra&#7751;ava becomes absorbed. &#7692;yur, sun, s&#257;mave&#7693;a, suva&#7717; and Mahe&#347;vara&#8212;all these (are absorbed) when Mak&#257;ra (M), the third am&#347;a of pra&#7751;ava becomes absorbed. Ak&#257;ra is of (p&#299;&#7789;a) yellow colour and is said to be of rajogu&#7751;a; Uk&#257;ra is of white colour and of sa&#7789;&#7789;vagu&#7751;a; Mak&#257;ra is of dark colour and of &#7789;amogu&#7751;a. He who does not know Omk&#257;ra as having eight a&#7749;gas (parts), four p&#257;&#7693;as (feet), three s&#7789;h&#257;nas (seats) and five &#7693;eva&#7789;&#257;s (presiding deities) is not a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. Pra&#7751;ava is the bow. &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is the arrow and Brahman is said to be the aim. One should aim at it with great care and then he, like the arrow, becomes one with It. When that Highest is cognised, all karmas return (from him, <i>viz</i>., do not affect him). The Ve&#7693;as have Omk&#257;ra as their cause. The swaras (sounds) have Omk&#257;ra as their cause. The three worlds with (all) the locomotive and the fixed (ones in them) have Omk&#257;ra as their cause. The short (accent of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>) burns all sins, the long one is decayless and the bestower of prosperity. United with ar&#7693;ham&#257;&#7789;r&#257; (half-metre of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>), the pra&#7751;ava becomes the bestower of salvation. That man is the knower of the Ve&#7693;as who knows that the end (<i>viz</i>., ar&#7693;ham&#257;&#7789;r&#257;) of pra&#7751;ava should be worshipped (or recited) as uninterrupted as the flow of oil and (resounding) as long as the sound of a bell. One should contemplate upon Omk&#257;ra as &#298;&#347;vara resembling an unshaken light, as of the size of a thumb and as motionless in the middle of the pericarp of the lotus of the heart. Taking in v&#257;yu through the left nostril and filling the stomach with it, one should contemplate upon Omk&#257;ra as being in the middle of the body and as surrounded by circling flames. Brahma is said to be inspiration; Vish&#7751;u is said to be cessation (of breath), and Ru&#7693;ra is said to be expiration. These are the &#7693;eva&#7789;&#257;s of pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma. Having made &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as the (lower) ara&#7751;i (sacrificial wood) and pra&#7751;ava as the upper ara&#7751;i, one should see the God in secret through the practice of churning which is &#7693;hy&#257;na. One should practise restraint of breath as much as it lies in his power along with (the uttering of)</p>  
<p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Omk&#257;ra sound, until it ceases completely. Those who look upon <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span> as of the form of Hamsa staying in all, shining like crores of suns, being alone, staying in gam&#257;gama (ever going and coming) and being devoid of motion&#8212;at last such persons are freed from sin. That manas which is the author of the actions (<i>viz</i>.), creation, preservation and destruction of the three worlds, is (then) absorbed (in the supreme One). That is the highest state of Vish&#7751;u.</p>  
<p>The lotus of the heart has eight petals and thirty-two filaments. The sun is in its midst: the moon is in the middle of the sun. Agni is in the middle of the moon: the prabh&#257; (spiritual light) is in the middle of agni. P&#299;tha (seat or centre) is in the midst of prabh&#257;, being set in diverse gems. One should meditate upon the stainless Lord V&#257;su&#7693;eva as being (seated) upon the centre of P&#299;tha, as having &#346;r&#299;va&#7789;sa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (black mark) and Kaus&#7789;ubha (garland of gems) on his chest and as adorned with gems and pearls resembling pure crystal in lustre and as resembling crores of moons in brightness. He should meditate upon Mah&#257;-Vish&#7751;u as above or in the following manner. (That is) he should meditate with inspiration (of breath) upon Mah&#257;-Vish&#7751;u as resembling the a&#7789;as&#299; flower and as staying in the seat of navel with four hands; then with restraint of breath, he should meditate in the heart upon Brahma, the Grandfather as being on the lotus with the gaura (pale-red) colour of gems and having four faces: then through expiration, he should meditate upon the three-eyed &#346;iva between the two eyebrows shining like the pure crystal, being stainless, destroying all sins, being in that which is like the lotus facing down with its flower (or face) below and the stalk above or like the flower of a plantain tree, being of the form of all Ve&#7693;as, containing one hundred petals and one hundred leaves and having the pericarp full-expanded. There he should meditate upon the sun, the moon and the agni, one above another. Passing above through the lotus which has the brightness of the sun, moon and agni, and taking its Hr&#299;m b&#299;ja (letter), one leads his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; firmly. He is the knower of Ve&#7693;as</p>

<p>who knows the three seats, the three m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s, the three Brahm&#257;s, the three aksharas (letters) and the three m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s associated with the ar&#7693;ham&#257;&#7789;r&#257;. He who knows that which is above bin&#7693;u, n&#257;&#7693;a and kal&#257; as uninterrupted as the flow of oil and (resounding) as long as the sound of a bell&#8212;that man is a knower of the Ve&#7693;as. Just as a man would draw up (with his mouth) the water through the (pores of the) lotus-stalk, so the yogin treading the path of yoga should draw up the breath. Having made the lotus-sheath of the form of ar&#7693;ham&#257;&#7789;r&#257;, one should draw up the breath through the stalk (of the n&#257;dis Sushumn&#257;, Id&#257; and Pi&#7749;gal&#257;) and absorb it in the middle of the eyebrows. He should know that the middle of the eyebrows in the forehead which is also the root of the nose is the seat of nectar. That is the great place of Brahman.</p>  
<p>Postures, restraint of breath, subjugation of the senses &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;, &#7693;hy&#257;na and sam&#257;&#7693;hi are the six parts of yoga. There are as many postures as there are living creatures; and Mahe&#347;vara (the great Lord) knows their distinguishing features. Si&#7693;&#7693;ha, bha&#7693;ra, simha and pa&#7693;ma are the four (chief) postures. M&#363;l&#257;&#7693;h&#257;ra is the first chakra. Sv&#257;&#7693;hishth&#257;na is the second. Between these two is said to be the seat of yoni (perineum), having the form of K&#257;ma (God of love). In the &#256;dh&#257;ra of the anus, there is the lotus of four petals. In its midst is said to be the yoni called K&#257;ma and worshipped by the si&#7693;&#7693;has. In the midst of the yoni is the Li&#7749;ga facing the west and split at its head like the gem. He who knows this, is a knower of the Ve&#7693;as. A four-sided figure is situated above agni and below the genital organ, of the form of molten gold and shining like streaks of lightning. Pr&#257;&#7751;a is with its sva (own) sound, having Sv&#257;&#7693;hishth&#257;na as its a&#7693;hishth&#257;na (seat), (or since sva or pr&#257;&#7751;a arises from it). The chakra Sv&#257;&#7693;hishth&#257;na is spoken of as the genital organ itself. The chakra in the sphere of the navel is called Ma&#7751;ip&#363;raka, since the body is pierced through by v&#257;yu like ma&#7751;is (gems) by string. The j&#299;va (ego) urged to actions by its past virtuous and sinful karmas whirls about in this great chakra of twelve&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> spokes, so long as it</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="green">p. 206</font></A></p>  
<p>does not grasp the truth. Above the genital organ and below the navel is kan&#7693;a of the shape of a bird's egg. There arise (from it) n&#257;dis seventy-two thousand in number. Of these seventy-two are generally known. Of these, the chief ones are ten and carry the pr&#257;&#7751;as. Id&#257;, Pi&#7749;gal&#257;, Sushumn&#257;, G&#257;n&#7693;h&#257;r&#299;, Has&#7789;ijihv&#257;, Pasha, Ya&#347;asvin&#299;, Alambus&#257;, Kuh&#363;&#7717; and &#346;&#257;&#7749;khin&#299; are said to be the ten. This chakra of the midis should ever be known by the yogins. The three n&#257;dis Ida, Pi&#7749;gal&#257; and Sushumn&#257; are said to carry pr&#257;&#7751;a always and have as their &#7693;eva&#7789;&#257;s, moon, sun and agni. Id&#257; is on the left side and Pi&#7749;gal&#257; on the right side, while the Sushumn&#257; is in the middle. These three are known to be the paths of pr&#257;&#7751;a. Pr&#257;&#7751;a, Ap&#257;na, Sam&#257;na, U&#7693;&#257;na, and Vy&#257;na; Naga, Karma, K&#7771;kara, &#7692;eva&#7693;a&#7789;&#7789;a and &#7692;hana&ntilde;jaya; of these, the first five are called pr&#257;&#7751;as, etc., and last five Naga, etc. are called v&#257;yus (or sub-pr&#257;&#7751;as). All these are situated (or run along) the one thousand n&#257;dis, (being) in the form of (or producing) life. J&#299;va which is under the influence of pr&#257;&#7751;a and ap&#257;na goes up and down. J&#299;va on account of its ever moving by the left and right paths is not visible. Just as a ball struck down (on the earth) with the bat of the hand springs up, so j&#299;va ever tossed by pr&#257;&#7751;a and ap&#257;na is never at rest. He is knower of yoga who knows that pr&#257;&#7751;a always draws itself from ap&#257;na and ap&#257;na draws itself from pr&#257;&#7751;a, like a bird (drawing itself from and yet not freeing itself) from the string (to which it is tied).</p>  
<p>The j&#299;va comes out with the letter <i>Ha</i> and gets in again with the letter <i>Sa</i>. Thus j&#299;va always utters the man&#7789;ra 'Ham-sa,' 'Hamsa'. The j&#299;va always utters the man&#7789;ra twenty-one thousand and six hundred times in one day and night. This is called Ajap&#257; G&#257;ya&#7789;r&#299; and is ever the bestower of nirv&#257;&#7751;a to the yogins. Through its very thought, man is freed from sins. Neither in the past nor in the future is there a science equal to this, a japa equal to this or a meritorious action equal to this. Parame&#347;var&#299; (<i>viz</i>., kun&#7693;alin&#299; &#347;ak&#7789;i) sleeps shutting with her mouth that door which leads to the decayless Brahma-hole. Being aroused by the contact of agni with manas and pr&#257;&#7751;a, she takes the form of a needle and pierces up through Sushumn&#257;. The</p>  
<p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="green">p. 207</font></A></p>  
<p>yogin should open with great effort this door which is shut. Then he will pierce the door to salvation by means of kun&#7693;alin&#299;. Folding firmly the fingers of the hands, assuming firmly the Pa&#7693;ma posture, placing the chin firmly on the breast and fixing the mind in &#7693;hy&#257;&#7751;a, one should frequently raise up the ap&#257;na, fill up with air and then leave the pr&#257;&#7751;a. Then the wise man gets matchless wisdom through (this) &#347;ak&#7789;i. That yogin who assuming Pa&#7693;ma posture worships (<i>i.e.</i>, controls) v&#257;yu at the door of the n&#257;dis and then performs restraint of breath is released without doubt. Rubbing off the limbs the sweat arising from fatigue, abandoning all acid, bitter and saltish (food), taking delight in the drinking of milk and rasa, practising celibacy, being moderate in eating and ever bent on yoga, the yogin becomes a si&#7693;&#7693;ha in little more than a year. No inquiry need be made concerning the result. Ku&#7751;dalin&#299; &#347;ak&#7789;i, when it is up in the throat, makes the yogi get si&#7693;&#7693;hi. The union of pr&#257;&#7751;a and ap&#257;na has the extinction of urine and f&aelig;ces.</p>  
<p>One becomes young even when old through performing m&#363;laban&#7693;ha always. Pressing the yoni by means of the heels and contracting the anus and drawing up the ap&#257;na&#8212;this is called m&#363;laban&#7693;ha. Uddiy&#257;&#7751;a ban&#7693;ha is so called because it is (like) a great bird that flies up always without rest. One should bring the western part of the stomach above the navel. This Uddiy&#257;&#7751;a ban&#7693;ha is a lion to the elephant of death, since it binds the water (or nectar) of the &#257;k&#257;&#347; which arises in the head and flows down. The J&#257;lan&#7693;hara ban&#7693;ha is the destroyer of all the pains of the throat. When this J&#257;lan&#7693;hara ban&#7693;ha which is destroyer of the pains of the throat is performed, then nectar does not fall on agni nor does the v&#257;yu move. When the tongue enters backwards into the hole of the skull, then there is the mu&#7693;r&#257; of vision latent in the eyebrow called khechar&#299;. He who knows the mu&#7693;r&#257;, khechar&#299; has not disease, death, sleep, hunger, thirst, or swoon. He who practises this mu&#7693;r&#257; is not affected by illness or karma; nor is he bound by the limitations of time. Since chi&#7789;&#7789;a moves in the kha (&#257;k&#257;&#347;) and since the tongue has entered (in the mu&#7693;r&#257;) kha (<i>viz</i>., the hole in the mouth), therefore the mu&#7693;r&#257; is called khechar&#299; and worshipped by</p>  
<p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="green">p. 208</font></A></p>  
<p>the si&#7693;&#7693;has. He whose hole (or passage) above the uvula is closed (with the tongue backwards) by means of khechar&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257; never loses his virility, even when embraced by a lovely woman. Where is the fear of death, so long as the bin&#7693;u (virility) stays in the body. Bin&#7693;u does not go out of the body, so long as the khechar&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257; is practised. (Even) when bin&#7693;u comes down to the sphere of the perineum, it goes up, being prevented and forced up by violent effort through yonimu&#7693;r&#257;. This bin&#7693;u is twofold, white and red. The white one is called &#347;ukla and the red one is said to contain much rajas. The rajas which stays in yoni is like the colour of a coral. The bin&#7693;u stays in the seat of the genital organs. The union of these two is very rare. Bin&#7693;u is &#346;iva and rajas is &#347;ak&#7789;i. Bin&#7693;u is the moon and rajas is the sun. Through the union of these two is attained the highest body; when rajas is roused up by agitating the &#347;ak&#7789;i through v&#257;yu which unites with the sun, thence is produced the divine form. &#346;ukla being united with the moon and rajas with the sun, he is a knower of yoga who knows the proper mixture of these two. The cleansing of the accumulated refuse, the unification of the sun and the moon and the complete drying of the rasas (essences), this is called mah&#257;mu&#7693;r&#257;. Placing the chin on the breast, pressing the anus by means of the left heel, and seizing (the toe of) the extended right leg by the two hands, one should fill his belly (with air) and should slowly exhale. This is called mah&#257;mu&#7693;r&#257;, the destroyer of the sins of men.</p>  
<p>Now I shall give a description of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. In the seat of the heart is a lotus of eight petals. In its centre is j&#299;v&#257;&#7789;m&#257; of the form of jyo&#7789;is and atomic in size, moving in a circular line. In it is located everything. It knows everything. It does everything. It does all these actions attributing everything to its own power, (thinking) I do, I enjoy, I am happy, I am miserable, I am blind, I am lame, I am deaf, I am mute, I am lean, I am stout, etc. When it rests on the eastern petal which is of &#347;ve&#7789;a (white) colour, then it has a mind (or is inclined) to &#7693;harma with bhak&#7789;i (devotion). When it rests on the southeastern petal, which is of rak&#7789;a (blood colour), then it is inclined</p>  
<p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="green">p. 209</font></A></p>  
<p>to sleep and laziness. When it rests on the southern petal, which is of k&#7771;sh&#7751;a (black) colour, then it is inclined to hate and anger. When it rests on the south-western petal which is of n&#299;la (blue) colour, then it gets desire for sinful or harmful actions. When it rests on the western petal which is of crystal colour, then it is inclined to flirt and amuse. When it rests on the north-western petal which is of ruby colour, then it has a mind to walk, rove and have vair&#257;gya (or be indifferent). When it rests on, the northern petal which is pita (yellow) colour, then it is inclined to be happy and to be loving. When it rests on the north-eastern petal which is of vaid&#363;rya (lapis lazuli) colour, then it is inclined to amassing money, charity and passion. When it stays in the interspace between any two petals, then it gets the wrath arising from diseases generated through (the disturbance of the equilibrium of) v&#257;yu, bile and phlegm (in the body). When it stays in the middle, then it knows everything, sings, dances, speaks and is blissful. When the eye is pained (after a day's work), then in order to remove (its) pain, it makes first a circular line and sinks in the middle. The first line is of the colour of ban&#7693;h&#363;ka flower (Bassia). Then is the state of sleep. In the middle of the state of sleep is the state of dream. In the middle of the state of dream, it experiences the ideas of perception, Ve&#7693;as, inference, possibility, (sacred) words, etc. Then there arises much fatigue. In order to remove this fatigue, it circles the second line and sinks in the middle. The second is of the colour of (the insect) In&#7693;ragopa (of red or white colour). Then comes the state of dreamless sleep.</p>  
<p>During the dreamless sleep, it has only the thought connected with Parame&#347;vara (the highest Lord) alone. This state is of the nature of eternal wisdom. Afterwards it attains the nature of the highest Lord (Parame&#347;vara). Then it makes a round of the third circle and sinks in the middle. The third circle is of the colour of pa&#7693;mar&#257;ga (ruby). Then comes the state of &#7789;urya (the fourth). In &#7789;urya, there is only the connection of Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;. It attains the nature of eternal wisdom. Then one should gradually attain the quiescence of bu&#7693;&#7693;hi with</p>  
<p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></A></p>  
<p>self-control. Placing the manas in &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, one should think of nothing else. Then causing the union of pr&#257;&#7751;a and ap&#257;na, he concentrates his aim upon the whole universe being of the nature of &#256;&#7789;ma. Then comes the state of tury&#257;&#7789;&#299;&#7789;a (<i>viz</i>., that state beyond the fourth). Then everything appears as bliss. He is beyond the pairs (of happiness and pains, etc.). He stays here as long as he should wear his body. Then he attains the nature of Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; and attains emancipation through this means. This alone is the means of knowing &#256;&#7789;m&#257;.</p>  
<p>When v&#257;yu (breath) which enters the great hole associated with a hall where four roads meet gets into the half of the well-placed triangle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> then is Achyu&#7789;a (the indestructible) seen. Above the aforesaid triangle, one should meditate on the five b&#299;ja (seed) letters of (the elements) p&#7771;&#7789;hiv&#299;, etc., as also on the five pr&#257;&#7751;as, the colour of the b&#299;jas and their position. The letter &#2351;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is the b&#299;ja of pr&#257;&#7751;a and resembles the blue cloud. The letter &#2352; is the b&#299;ja of agni, is of ap&#257;na and resembles the sun. The letter &#2354; is the b&#299;ja of p&#7771;&#7789;hiv&#299;, is of vy&#257;na and resembles ban&#7693;h&#363;ka flower. The letter &#2357; is the b&#299;ja of j&#299;va (or vayu), is of ud&#257;na and is of the colour of the conch. The letter &#2361; is the b&#299;ja of &#257;k&#257;&#347;, is of sam&#257;na, and is of the colour of crystal. Pr&#257;&#7751;a stays in the heart, navel, nose, ear, foot, finger, and other places, travels through the seventy-two thousand n&#257;dis, stays in the twenty-eight crores of hair-pores and is yet the same everywhere. It is that which is called j&#299;va. One should perform the three, expiration, etc., with a firm will and great control: and drawing in everything (with the breath) in slow degrees, he should bind pr&#257;&#7751;a and ap&#257;na in the cave of the lotus of the heart and utter pra&#7751;ava, having contracted his throat and the genital organ. From the M&#363;l&#257;&#7693;h&#257;ra (to the head) is the Sushumn&#257; resembling the shining thread of the lotus. The n&#257;&#7693;a is located in the V&#299;&#7751;&#257;&#7693;a&#7751;da, (spinal column); that sound from its middle resembles (that of) the conch, etc. When it goes to the hole of the &#257;k&#257;&#347;, it resembles that of the peacock.

Between the two bows in the Brahma-hole, one should see Purusha with &#347;ak&#7789;i as his own &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Then his manas is absorbed there. That man attains kaivalya who understands the gems, moonlight, n&#257;&#7693;a, bin&#7693;u, and the seat of Mahe&#347;vara (the great Lord).</p>
