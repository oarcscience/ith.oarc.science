That alone should be the &#7693;hy&#257;na of the Munis as well as of men, which is full of pains, which is difficult to meditate on, which is difficult to perceive, which is the emancipated one, which is decayless and which is difficult to attain. One whose food is moderate, whose anger has been controlled, who has given up all love for society, who has subdued his passions, who has overcome all pairs (heat and cold etc.), who has given up his egoism, who does not bless anyone nor take anything from others, and also who goes where they naturally ought not to go, and naturally would not go where they like to go&#8212;such persons also obtain three&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in the face. Hamsa is said to have three seats. Therefore know it is the greatest of mysteries, without sleep and without support. It is very subtle, of the form of Soma, and is the supreme seat of Vish&#7751;u. That seat has three faces, three gu&#7751;as and three &#7693;h&#257;&#7789;us, and is formless, motionless, changeless, sizeless, and supportless. That seat is without up&#257;&#7693;hi, and is above the reach of speech and</p>

<p>mind. It is Svabh&#257;va (Self or nature) reachable only by bh&#257;va (being). The indestructible seat is associateless, without bliss, beyond mind, difficult to perceive, emancipated and changeless. It should be meditated upon as the liberated, the eternal, the permanent and the indestructible. It is Brahman, is a&#7693;hy&#257;&#7789;ma (or the deity presiding as &#256;&#7789;m&#257;) and is the highest seat of Vish&#7751;u. It is inconceivable, of the nature of Chi&#7693;&#257;&#7789;m&#257; and above the &#257;k&#257;&#347;, is void and non-void, and beyond the void, and is abiding in the heart. There is (in It) neither meditation nor meditator, nor the meditated, nor the non-meditated. It is not the universe. It is the highest space; it is neither supreme nor above the supreme. It is inconceivable, unknowable, non-truth, and not the highest. It is realised by the Munis, but the &#7692;evas do not know the supreme One. Avarice, delusion, fear, pride, passion, anger, sin, heat, cold, hunger, thirst, thought and fancy&#8212;(all these do not exist in It). (In It) there is no pride of (belonging to) the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a caste, nor is there the collection of the knot of salvation. (In It) there is no fear, no happiness, no pains, neither fame nor disgrace. That which is without these states is the supreme Brahman.</p>  
<p>Yama,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (forbearance), niyama (religious observance), ty&#257;ga (renunciation), mouna (silence) according to time and place, &#257;sana (posture), m&#363;laban&#7693;ha, seeing all bodies as equal, the position of the eye, pr&#257;&#7751;a-samyamana (control of breath), pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra (subjugation of the senses), &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;a, &#257;&#7789;ma-&#7693;hy&#257;na and sam&#257;&#7693;hi&#8212;these are spoken of as the parts (of yoga) in order. That is called yama in which one controls all his organs (of sense and actions) through the vij&ntilde;&#257;na that all is Brahman; this should be practised often and often. Niyama, in which there is the supreme bliss enjoyed through the flowing (or inclination) of the mind towards things of the same (spiritual) kind, (<i>viz</i>., Brahman) and the abandoning of things differing from one another is practised by the sages as a rule. In ty&#257;ga (renunciation), one abandons the manifestations (or objects) of the universe through the cognition of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; that is Sa&#7789; and Chi&#7789;. This is practised by the great and is the giver of immediate salvation.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Mouna (the silence), in which, without reaching That, speech returns along with mind, is fit to be attained by the Yogins and should be ever worshipped by the ignorant (even). How is it possible to speak of "That", from which speech returns? How should it be described as the universe as there is no word to describe it? It is "That" which is (really) called silence, and which is naturally understood (as such). There is silence in children, but with words (latent); whereas the knowers of Brahman have it (silence) but without words. That should be known as "the lonely seat" in which there is no man in the beginning, middle, or end, and through which all this (universe) is fully pervaded. The illusion of Brahm&#257; and all other beings takes place within one twinkling (of His eye). That should be known as &#257;sana (posture), in which one has with ease and without fatigue (uninterrupted) meditation of Brahman; that is described by the word k&#257;la (time), that is endless bliss and that is secondless. Everything else is the destroyer of happiness. That is called si&#7693;&#7693;h&#257;sana (si&#7693;&#7693;ha-posture) in which the si&#7693;&#7693;has (psychical personages) have succeeded in realising the endless One as the support of the universe containing all the elements, etc. That is called the m&#363;laban&#7693;ha, which is the M&#363;la (root) of all worlds, and through which the root Chi&#7789;&#7789;a is (ba&#7751;dha) bound. It should be always practised by the R&#257;jayogins.</p>  
<p>One after having known the equality of the a&#7749;gas (or parts of yoga) point to one and the same Brahman, should be absorbed in that equal (or uniform) Brahman; if not, there is not that equality (attained). Then like a dry tree, there is straightness (or uniformity throughout). Making one's vision full of spiritual wisdom, one should look upon the world as full of Brahman. That vision is very noble. It is (generally) aimed at the tip of the nose; but it should be directed towards that seat (of Brahman) wherein the cessation of seer, the seen, and sight will take place, and not towards the tip of the nose. That is called pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma (the control of breath), in which there is the control of the modifications (of mind) through the cognition of Brahman in all the states of chi&#7789;&#7789;a, and others. The checking of</p>  
<p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (the conception of the reality of) the universe, is said to be expiration. The conception of "I am Brahman" is inspiration. The holding on (long) to this conception without agitation is cessation of breath. Such is the practice of the enlightened. The ignorant close their nose. That should be known as pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra, through which one sees &#256;&#7789;m&#257; (even) in the objects of sense, and pleases chi&#7789;&#7789;a through manas. It should be practised often and often. Through seeing Brahman wherever the mind goes, the &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;a of the mind is obtained. &#7692;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257; is thought of highly by the wise. By &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;a is meant that state where one indulges in the good thought, "I am Brahman alone," and is without any support. This &#7693;hy&#257;na is the giver of supreme bliss. Being first in a state of changelessness, and then thoroughly forgetting (even) that state owing to the cognition of the (true) nature of Brahman&#8212;this is called sam&#257;&#7693;hi. This kind of bliss should be practised (or enjoyed) by a wise person till his cognition itself united in a moment with the state of pra&#7789;yag (&#256;&#7789;m&#257;). Then this King of Yogins becomes a Si&#7693;&#7693;ha, and is without any aid (outside himself). Then he will attain a state, inexpressible and unthinkable.</p>  
<p>When sam&#257;&#7693;hi is practised, the following obstacles arise with great force&#8212;absence of right inquiry, laziness, inclination to enjoyment, absorption (in material object), &#7789;amas, distraction, impatience, sweat, and absent-mindedness. All these obstacles should be overcome by inquirers into Brahman. Through bh&#257;vav&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;is (worldly thoughts), one gets into them. Through &#347;&#363;nya-v&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;is (void or empty thoughts), one gets into them. But through the v&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;is of Brahman, one gets fullness. Therefore one should develop fullness through this means (of Brahman). He who abandons this v&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;i of Brahman, which is very purifying and supreme&#8212;that man lives in vain like a beast. But he who understands this v&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;i (of Brahman), and having understood it makes advances in it, becomes a good and blessed person, deserving to be worshipped by the three worlds. Those who are greatly developed through the ripening (of their past karmas) attain the state of Brahman; others are simply reciters of words.</p>  
<p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Those who are clever in arguments about Brahman, but are without the action pertaining to Brahman, and who are greatly attached to the world&#8212;those certainly are born again and again (in this world) through their aj&ntilde;&#257;na; (the former) never remain, even for half a moment&#8212;without the v&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;i of Brahman, like Brahma and others, Sanaka,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> etc., &#346;uka and others. When a cause is subject to changes, it (as an effect) must also have its cause. When the cause ceases to exist in truth, the effect perishes through right discrimination. Then that substance (or principle) which is beyond the scope of words, remains pure. After that, v&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;i j&ntilde;&#257;na arises in their purified mind; through meditation with transcendental energy, there arises a firm certitude. After reducing the visible into the invisible state, one should see everything as Brahman. The wise should ever stay in bliss with their understanding full of the essence of Chi&#7789;. Thus ends the first chapter of &#7788;ejobin&#7693;u.</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chapter</span> II</h5>  
<p>Then the Kum&#257;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> asked &#346;iva: "Please explain to me the nature of Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra, that is the partless non-dual essence." The great &#346;iva replied: "The partless non-dual essence is the visible. It is the world, it is the existence, it is the Self, it is man&#7789;ra, it is action, it is spiritual wisdom, it is water. It is the earth, it is &#257;k&#257;&#347;, it is the books, it is the three Ve&#7693;as, it is the Brahman, it is the religious vow, it is J&#299;va, it is Aja (the unborn), it is Brahma, it is Vish&#7751;u, it is Ru&#7693;ra; it is I, it is &#256;&#7789;ma, it is the Guru. It is the aim, it is sacrifice, it is the body, it is manas, it is chi&#7789;&#7789;a, it is happiness, it is vi&#7693;y&#257;; it is the undifferentiated, it is the eternal, it is the supreme, it is everything. O six-faced one, different from It there is nothing. None, none but It; It is I. It is gross, it is subtle, it is knowable, it is thou; it is the mysterious; it is the knower; it is existence, it is mother, it is father, it is brother, it is husband, it is S&#363;&#7789;ra (&#256;&#7789;m&#257;), it is Vir&#257;t.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> It is the body, it is the head, it is the internal, it is the external, it is full, it is nectar, it is go&#7789;ra (clan), it is g&#7771;ha (the house), it is the preservable, it is the moon, it is the stars, it is the sun, it is the holy seat. It is forgiveness, it is patience, it is the gu&#7751;as, it is the witness. It is a friend, it is a relative, it is an ally, it is the king, town, kingdom and subjects. It is Om, japa, meditation, the seat, the one worthy to be taken (in), the heart, the Jyo&#7789;is, Swarga (heaven) and Self."</p>  
<p>"All the partless and non-dual essence should be regarded as Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra alone is the Absolute Consciousness; and this partless non-dual essence alone is the (real) essence. All having consciousness alone except those having changes, are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. All this is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. He is Chinmaya; the state of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is known as Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra and the partless non-dual essence. The whole world is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Your state and my state are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. &#256;k&#257;&#347;, earth, water, v&#257;yu, agni, Brahm&#257;, Vish&#7751;u, &#346;iva and all else that exist or do not, are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. That which is the partless non-dual essence is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. All the past, present, and future are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Substance and time are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Knowledge and the knowable are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. The knower is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Everything is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Every speech is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Whatever else is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Asa&#7789; and Sa&#7789; are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. The beginning and end are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra; that which is in the beginning and end is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra ever. The Guru and the disciple are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. If the seer and the seen are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra, then they are always Chinmaya. All things wondrous are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. The (gross) body is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra, as also the subtle and causal bodies. There is nothing beyond Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. I and thou are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Form and non-form are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Virtue and vice are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. The body is a symbol of Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Sa&#7749;kalpa, knowing, man&#7789;ra, and others, the gods invoked in man&#7789;ras, the gods presiding over the eight quarters, the phenomenal and the supreme Brahman are nothing but Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. There is nothing without Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. M&#257;y&#257; is nothing without Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. P&#363;j&#257; (worship) is nothing without Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Meditation, truth, sheaths and others, the (eight) valus, silence, non-silence, and indifference to objects</p>  
<p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> &#8212;are nothing without Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Everything is from Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Whatever is seen and however seen&#8212;it is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra so far. Whatever exists and however distant, is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Whatever elements exist, whatever is perceived, and whatever is ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;a&#8212;all these are Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Without Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra, there is no motion, no Moksha and no goal aimed at. Everything is Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Brahman that is the partless non-dual essence is known to be nothing but Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. Thou, O Lord, art the partless non-dual essence (stated) in the books, in me, in Thee, and in the ruler. He who thus perceives 'I' as of one homogeneity (pervading everywhere) will at once be emancipated through this spiritual wisdom. He is his own Guru with this profound spiritual wisdom. Thus ends the second chapter of &#7788;ejobin&#7693;u."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chapter</span> III</h5>  
<p>The Kum&#257;ra addressed his father (again): "Please explain to me the realisation of &#256;&#7789;ma." To which the great &#346;iva said: "I am of the nature of the Parabrahman. I am the supreme bliss. I am solely of the nature of divine wisdom. I am the sole supreme, the sole quiescence, the sole Chinmaya, the sole unconditioned, the sole permanent and the sole Sa&#7789;&#7789;va. I am the 'I' that has given up 'I'. I am one that is without anything. I am full of Chi&#7693;&#257;k&#257;&#347;. I am the sole fourth one. I am the sole one above the fourth (state of &#7789;urya). I am of the nature of (pure) consciousness. I am ever of the nature of the bliss-consciousness. I am of the nature of the non-dual. I am ever of a pure nature, solely of the nature of divine wisdom, of the nature of happiness, without fancies, desires or diseases, of the nature of bliss, without changes or differentiations, and of the nature of the eternal one essence and Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra. My real nature is indescribable, of endless bliss, the bliss above Sa&#7789; and Chi&#7789; and the interior of the interior. I am beyond reach of manas and speech. I am of the nature of &#256;&#7789;mic bliss, true bliss and one who plays with (my) &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. I am &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and Sa&#7693;&#257;&#347;iva. My nature is &#256;&#7789;mic spiritual effulgence. I am the essence of the jyo&#7789;is of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. I am without beginning, middle, or end. I am like the</p>  
<p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></A></p>  
<p>sky. I am solely Sa&#7789;, &#256;nan&#7693;a, and Chi&#7789; which is unconditioned and pure. I am the Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a that is eternal, enlightened and pure. I am ever of the nature of the eternal &#346;esha (serpent-time). I am ever beyond all. My nature is beyond form. My form is supreme &#257;k&#257;&#347;. My nature is of the bliss of earth. I am ever without speech. My nature is the all-seat (foundation of all). I am ever replete with consciousness, without the attachment of body, without thought, without the modifications of chi&#7789;&#7789;a, the sole essence of Chi&#7693;&#257;&#7789;ma, beyond the visibility of all and of the form of vision. My nature is ever full. I am ever fully contented, the all, and Brahman, and the very consciousness; I am 'I'. My nature is of the earth. I am the great &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and the supreme of the supreme; I appear sometimes as different from myself; sometimes as possessing a body, sometimes as a pupil and sometimes as the basis of the worlds. I am beyond the three periods of time, am worshipped by the Ve&#7693;as, am determined by the sciences and am fixed in the chi&#7789;&#7789;a. There is nothing left out by me, neither the earth nor any other objects here. Know that there is nothing which is out of myself. I am Brahma, a Si&#7693;&#7693;ha, the eternally pure, non-dual one, Brahman, without old age or death. I shine by myself; I am my own &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, my own goal, enjoy myself, play in myself, have my own spiritual effulgence, am my own greatness, and am used to play in my own &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, look on my own &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and am in myself happily seated. I have my own &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as the residue, stay in my own consciousness, and play happily in the kingdom of my own &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Sitting on the real throne of my own &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, I think of nothing else but my own &#256;&#7789;ma. I am Chi&#7693;r&#363;pa alone, Brahman alone, Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a, the second-less, the one replete with bliss and the sole Brahman and ever without anything, have the bliss of my own &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, the unconditioned bliss, and am always &#256;&#7789;ma-&#256;k&#257;&#347;. I alone am in the heart like Chi&#7693;&#257;&#7693;i&#7789;ya (the consciousness-sun). I am content in my own &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, have no form, or no decay, am without the number one, have the nature of an unconditionod and emancipated one, and I am subtler than &#257;k&#257;&#347;; I am without the existence of beginning or end, of the nature of the</p>  
<p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></A></p>  
<p>all-illuminating, the bliss greater than the great, of the sole nature of Sa&#7789;, of the nature of pure Moksha, of the nature of truth and bliss, full of spiritual wisdom and bliss, of the nature of wisdom alone, and of the nature of Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a. All this is Brahman alone. There is none other than Brahman and that is 'I'.</p>  
<p>"I am Brahman that is Sa&#7789;, and bliss, and the ancient. The word 'thou' and the word 'that' are not different from me. I am of the nature of consciousness. I am alone the great &#346;iva. I am beyond the nature of existence. I am of the nature of happiness. As there is nothing that can witness me, I am without the state of witness. Being purely of the nature of Brahman, I am the eternal &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. I alone am the &#256;&#7693;i&#347;esha (the primeval &#346;esha).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I alone am the &#346;esha. I am without name and form, of the nature of bliss, of the nature of being unperceivable by the senses, and of the nature of all beings; I have neither bondage nor salvation. I am of the form of eternal bliss. I am the primeval consciousness alone, the partless and non-dual essence, beyond reach of speech and mind, of the nature of bliss everywhere, of the nature of fullness everywhere, of the nature of earthly bliss, of the nature of contentment everywhere, the supreme nectary essence, and the one and secondless Sa&#7789;, (<i>viz</i>.,) Brahman. There is no doubt of it. I am of the nature of all-void. I am the one that is given out by the Ve&#7693;as. I am of the nature of the emancipated and emancipation, of Nirv&#257;&#7751;ic bliss, of truth and wisdom, of Sa&#7789; alone and bliss, of the one beyond the fourth, of one without fancy, and ever of the nature of Aja (the unborn). I am without passion or faults. I am the pure, the enlightened, the eternal, the all-pervading and of the nature of the significance of Om, of the spotless, and of Chi&#7789;. I am neither existing nor non-existing. I am not of the nature of anything. I am of the nature of the actionless. I am without parts. I have no semblance, no manas, no sense, no bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, no change, none of the three bodies, neither the waking, dreaming, or dreamless sleeping states. I am neither of the nature of the three pains nor of the three desires. I have neither</p>

<p>"The nature of manas is unreal, the nature of bu&#7693;&#7693;hi is unreal, the nature of aham (the 'I') is unreal; but I am the unconditioned, the permanent and the unborn. The three bodies are unreal, the three periods of time are unreal, the three gu&#7751;as are unreal, but I am of the nature of the Real and the pure. That which is heard is unreal, all the Ve&#7693;as are unreal, the &#346;&#257;s&#7789;ras are unreal, but I am. the Real and of the nature of Chi&#7789;. The M&#363;r&#7789;is (Brahma, Vish&#7751;u, and Ru&#7693;ra having limitation) are unreal, all the creation is unreal, all the &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;vas are unreal, but know that I am the great Sa&#7693;&#257;&#347;iva. The master and the disciple are unreal, the man&#7789;ra of the Guru is unreal, that which is seen is unreal, but know me to be the Real. Whatever is thought of is unreal, whatever is lawful is unreal, whatever is beneficial is unreal, but know me to be the Real. Know the Purusha (ego) to be unreal, know the enjoyments to be unreal, know things seen and heard are unreal as also the one woven warp-wise and woof-wise, <i>viz</i>., this universe; cause and non-cause are unreal, things lost or obtained are unreal. Pains and happiness are unreal, all and non-all are unreal, gain and loss are unreal, victory and defeat are unreal.

<p>"One should cognize his own &#256;&#7789;m&#257; alone. One should always practise the man&#7789;ra of his &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. The man&#7789;ra (Ahambrahm&#257;smi) 'I am Brahman' removes all the sins of sight, destroys all other man&#7789;ras, destroys all the sins of body and birth, the noose of Yama, the pains of duality, the thought of difference, the pains of thought, the disease of bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, the bondage of chi&#7789;&#7789;a, all diseases, all griefs and passions instantaneously, the power of anger, the modifications of chi&#7789;&#7789;a, sa&#7749;kalpa, crores of sins, all actions and the aj&ntilde;&#257;na of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;.

<p>kills the demon of non-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;. The thunderbolt 'I am Brahman' clears all the hill of not-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;.

There are seven crores of great man&#7789;ras and there are vra&#7789;as (vows) of (or yielding) hundred crores of births. Having given up all other man&#7789;ras, one should ever practise this man&#7789;ra. He obtains at once salvation, and there is not even a particle of doubt about it. Thus ends the third chapter of the &#7788;ejobin&#7693;u-Upanisha&#7693;."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chapter</span> IV</h5>  
<p>The Kum&#257;ra asked the great Lord: "Please explain to me the nature of J&#299;vanmuk&#7789;i (embodied salvation) and vi&#7693;ehamu.kti (disembodied salvation)." To which the great &#346;iva replied: "I am Chi&#7693;&#257;&#7789;m&#257;. I am Para-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;. I am the Nirgu&#7751;a, greater than the great. One who will simply stay in &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is called a Jivanmuk&#7789;a. He who realises: 'I am beyond the three bodies, I am the pure consciousness and I am Brahman,' is said to be a Jivanmuk&#7789;a. He is said to be a Jivanmuk&#7789;a, who realises: 'I am of the nature of the blissful and of the supreme bliss, and I have neither body nor any other thing except the certitude "I am Brahman" only'. He is said to be a Jivanmuk&#7789;a who has not at all got the 'I' in myself, but who stays in Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra (absolute consciousness) alone, whose interior is consciousness alone, who is only of the nature of Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra, whose &#256;&#7789;ma is of the nature of the all-full, who has &#256;&#7789;m&#257; left over in all, who is devoted to bliss, who is undifferentiated, who is all-full of the nature of consciousness, whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is of the nature of pure consciousness, who has given up all affinities (for objects), who has unconditioned bliss, whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is tranquil, who has got no other thought (than Itself), and who is devoid of the thought of the existence of anything. He is said to be a Jivanmuk&#7789;a who realises: I have no chi&#7789;&#7789;a, no bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, no aha&#7749;k&#257;ra, no sense, no body at any time, no pr&#257;&#7751;as, no M&#257;y&#257;, no passion and no anger, I am the great, I have nothing of these objects or</p>  
<p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></A></p>  
<p>of the world, and I have no sin, no characteristics, no eye, no manas, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no hand, no waking, no dreaming, or causal state in the least or the fourth state.' He is said to be a Jivanmuk&#7789;a, who realises: 'All this is not mine, I have no time, no space, no object, no thought, no sn&#257;na (bathing), no san&#7693;hy&#257;s (junction-period ceremonies), no deity, no place, no sacred places, no worship, no spiritual wisdom, no seat, no relative, no birth, no speech, no wealth, no virtue, no vice, no duty, no auspiciousness, no J&#299;va, not even the three worlds; no salvation, no duality, no Ve&#7693;as, no mandatory rules, no proximity, no distance, no knowledge, no secrecy, no Guru, no disciple, no diminution, no excess, no Brahma, no Vish&#7751;u, no Ru&#7693;ra, no moon, no earth, no water, no v&#257;yu, no &#257;k&#257;&#347;, no agni, no clan, no lakshya (object aimed at), no mundane existence, no meditator, no object of meditation, no manas, no cold, no heat, no thirst, no hunger, no friend, no foe, no illusion, no victory, no past, present, or future, no quarters, nothing to be said or heard in the least, nothing to be gone (or attained) to, nothing to be contemplated, enjoyed or remembered, no enjoyment, no desire, no yoga, no absorption, no garrulity, no quietude, no bondage, no love, no joy, no instant joy, no hugeness, no smallness, neither length nor shortness, neither increase nor decrease, neither a&#7693;hy&#257;ropa (illusory attribution) nor apav&#257;&#7693;a (withdrawal of that conception) no oneness, no manyness, no blindness, no dullness, no skill, no flesh, no blood, no lymph, no skin, no marrow, no bone, no skin, none of the seven &#7693;h&#257;&#7789;us, no whiteness, no redness, no blueness, no heat, no gain, neither importance nor non-importance, no delusion, no perseverance, no mystery, no race, nothing to be abandoned or received, nothing to be laughed at, no policy, no religious vow, no fault, no bewailments, no happiness, neither knower nor knowledge nor the knowable, no Self, nothing belonging to you or to me, neither you nor I, and neither old age nor youth nor manhood; but I am certainly Brahman. "I am certainly Brahman. I am Chi&#7789;, I am Chi&#7789; "' He is said to be a Jivanmuk&#7789;a who cognizes: I am Brahman alone, I am Chi&#7789; alone, I am the supreme.' No doubt need be entertained about this; 'I am Hamsa itself, I remain of my own will, I can see</p>  
<p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></A></p>  
<p>myself through myself, I reign happy in the kingdom of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and enjoy in myself the bliss of my own &#256;&#7789;m&#257;.' He is a Jivanmuk&#7789;a who is himself, the foremost and the one undaunted person who is himself the lord and rests in his own Self.</p>  
<p>"He is a Vi&#7693;ehamuk&#7789;a who has become Brahman, whose &#256;&#7789;ma has attained quiescence, who is of the nature of Br&#257;hmic bliss, who is happy, who is of a pure nature, and who is a great mouni (observer of silence). He is a Vi&#7693;ehamuk&#7789;a who remains in Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra alone without (even) thinking thus: 'I am all &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, the &#256;&#7789;m&#257; that is equal (or the same) in all, the pure, without one, the non-dual, the all, the self only, the birth-less and the deathless&#8212;I am myself the undecaying &#256;&#7789;m&#257; that is the object aimed at, the sporting, the silent, the blissful, the beloved and the bondless salvation&#8212;I am Brahman alone&#8212;I am Chi&#7789; alone.' He is a Vi&#7693;ehamuk&#7789;a who having abandoned the thought: 'I alone am the Brahman' is filled with bliss. He is a Vi&#7693;ehamuk&#7789;a who having given up the certainty of the existence or non-existence of all objects is pure Chi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a (the consciousness-bliss), who having abandoned (the thought): 'I am Brahman' (or) 'I am not Brahman' does not mingle his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; with anything, anywhere or at any time, who is ever silent with the silence of Sa&#7789;ya, who does nothing, who has gone beyond gu&#7751;as, whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; has become the All, the great, and the purifier of the elements, who does not cognize the change of time, matter, place, himself or other differences, who does not see (the difference of) 'I,' 'thou,' 'this' or 'that,' who being of the nature of time is yet without it, whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is void, subtle and universal, but yet without (them), whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is divine and yet without &#7692;evas, whose &#256;&#7789;ma is measurable and yet without measure, whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is without inertness and within every one, whose Jima is devoid of any sa&#7749;kalpa, who thinks always: 'I am Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra, I am simply Param&#257;&#7789;man, I am only of the nature of spiritual wisdom, I am only of the nature of Sa&#7789;, I am afraid of nothing in this world,' and who is without the conception of &#7692;evas, Ve&#7693;as and sciences, 'All this is consciousness, etc.,' and regards all as void. He is a Vi&#7693;ehamuk&#7789;a who has realised himself to be Chai&#7789;anya alone, who is remaining at ease in the pleasure-garden</p>  
<p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></A></p>  
<p>of his own &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is of an illimitable nature, who is without the conception of the small and the great, and who is the fourth of the fourth state and the supreme bliss. He is a Vi&#7693;ehamuk&#7789;a whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is nameless and formless, who is the great spiritual wisdom of the nature of bliss, and of the nature of the state beyond &#7789;urya, who is neither auspicious nor inauspicious, who has yoga as his &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is associated with yoga, who is free from bondage or freedom, without gu&#7751;a or non-gu&#7751;a, without space, time, etc., without the witnessable and the witness, without the small or the great, and without the cognition of the universe or even the cognition of the nature of Brahman, but who finds his spiritual effulgence in his own nature, who finds bliss in himself, whose bliss is beyond the scope of words and mind, and whose thought is beyond the beyond. He is said to be a Vi&#7693;ehamuk&#7789;a who has gone beyond (or mastered quite) the modifications of chi&#7789;&#7789;a, who illumines such modifications, and whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is without any modifications at all. In that case, he is neither embodied nor disembodied. If such a thought is entertained (even), for a moment, then he is surrounded (in thought) by all. He is a Vi&#7693;ehamuk&#7789;a whose external &#256;&#7789;m&#257; invisible to others is the supreme bliss aiming at the highest ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;a, who drinks of the juice of the nectar of Brahman, who has the nectar of Brahman as medicine, who is devoted to the juice of the nectar of Brahman, who is immersed in that juice, who has the beneficent worship of the Br&#257;hmic bliss, who is not satiated with the juice of the nectar of Brahman, who realises Br&#257;hmic bliss, who cognizes the &#346;iva bliss in Br&#257;hmic bliss, who has the effulgence of the essence of Br&#257;hmic bliss, who has become one with it, who lives in the household of Br&#257;hmic bliss, has mounted the car of Br&#257;hmic bliss, who has an imponderable Chi&#7789; being one with it, who is supporting (all), being full of it, who associates with me having it, who stays in &#256;&#7789;m&#257; having that bliss and who thinks: 'All this is of the nature of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, there is nothing else beside &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, all is &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, I am &#256;&#7789;ma, the great &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, the supreme &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, and &#256;&#7789;m&#257; of the form of bliss.' He who thinks: 'My nature is full, I am the great &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, I am the all-contented and the permanent &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. I am</p>

He who does not think this is J&#299;v&#257;&#7789;m&#257; and that is Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is of the nature of the emancipated and the non-emancipated, but without emancipation or bondage, whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is of the nature of the dual and the non-dual one, but without duality and non-duality; whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is of the nature of the All and the non-All, but without them; whose &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is of the nature of the happiness arising from objects obtained and enjoyed, but without it; and who is devoid of any sa&#7749;kalpa&#8212;such a man is a Vi&#7693;ehamuk&#7789;a.

<p>The Sage named Ni&#7693;&#257;gha addressed the venerable &#7770;bhu: "O Lord please explain to me the discrimination of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; from non-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;." The Sage replied thus:</p>

Being devoid of all the difference of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and non-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;, of heterogeneity and homogeneity, and of quiescence and non-quiescence&#8212;that is the one Jyo&#7789;is at the end of n&#257;&#7693;a. Being remote from the conception of Mah&#257;-vaky&#257;r&#7789;ha (<i>i.e.</i>, the meaning of Maha-v&#257;kyas) as well of 'I am Brahman,' being devoid of or without the conception of the word and the meaning, and being devoid of the conception of the destructible and indestructible&#8212;that is the one Jyo&#7789;is at the end of n&#257;&#7693;a. Being without the conception 'I am the partless non-dual essence' or 'I am the blissful,' and being of the nature of the one beyond all&#8212;that is one Jyo&#7789;is at the end of n&#257;&#7693;a. He who is devoid of the significance of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; (<i>viz</i>. motion) and devoid of Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a&#8212;he is alone &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, the eternal. He who is undefinable and unreachable by the words of the Ve&#7693;as, who has neither externals nor internals, and whose symbol is either the universe or Brahman&#8212;he is undoubtedly &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. He who has no body, nor</p>

Rest assured that not-&#256;&#7789;m&#257; is a misnomer. There is no manas as not-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;. There is no world as not-&#256;&#7789;ma. Owing to the absence of all sa&#7749;kalpas and to the giving up of all actions, Brahman alone remains, and there is no not-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Being devoid of the three bodies, the three periods of time, the three gu&#7751;as of J&#299;va, the three pains and the three worlds, and following the saying 'All is Brahman,' know that there is nothing to be known through the absence of chi&#7789;&#7789;a; there is no old age through the absence of body; no motion through the absence of legs; no action through the absence of hands; no death through the absence of creatures; no happiness through the absence of bu&#7693;&#7693;hi; no virtue, no purity, no fear, no repetition of man&#7789;ras, no Guru nor disciple. There is no second in the absence of one. Where there is not the second, there is not the first. Where there is truth alone, there is no non-truth possible; where there is non-truth alone, there is no truth possible. If you regard a thing auspicious as inauspicious, then auspiciousness is desired (as separate) from inauspiciousness. If you regard fear as non-fear, then fear will arise out of non-fear. If bondage should become emancipation, then in the absence of bondage will be no emancipation. If birth should imply death, then in the absence of birth, there is no death. If 'thou' should imply 'I,' then in the absence of 'thou' there is no 'I'. If 'this' should be 'that,' 'this' does not exist in the absence of 'that'. If being should imply non-being, then non-being will imply being. If an effect implies a cause, then in the absence</p>

<p>of effect, there is no cause. If duality implies non-duality, then in the absence of duality, there is no non-duality. If there should be the seen, then there is the eye (or sight); in the absence of the seen, there is no eye. In the absence of the interior, there is no exterior. If there should be fullness, then non-fullness is possible. Therefore (all) this exists nowhere. Neither you nor I, nor this nor these exist. There exists no (object of) comparison in the true one. There is no simile in the unborn. There is (in it) no mind to think. I am the supreme Brahman. This world is Brahman only. Thou and I are Brahman only. I am Chinm&#257;&#7789;ra simply, and there is no not-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Rest assured of it. This universe is not (really at all). This universe is not (really) at all. It was nowhere produced and stays nowhere. Some say that chi&#7789;&#7789;a is the universe. Not at all. It exists not. Neither the universe nor chi&#7789;&#7789;a nor aha&#7749;k&#257;ra nor J&#299;va exists (really). Neither the creation of M&#257;y&#257; nor M&#257;y&#257; itself exists (really). Fear does not (really) exist. Actor, action, hearing, thinking, the two sam&#257;&#7693;his, the measurer, the measure, aj&ntilde;&#257;na and aviveka&#8212;none of these exists (truly) anywhere. Therefore the four moving&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> considerations and the three kinds of relationship exist not. There is no Ga&#7749;g&#257;, no Gaya, no Se&#7789;u (bridge), no elements or anything else, no earth, water, fire, v&#257;yu, and &#257;kas anywhere, no &#7692;evas, no guardians of the four quarters, no Ve&#7693;as, no Guru, no distance, no proximity, no time, no middle, no non-duality, no truth, no untruth, no bondage, no emancipation, no Sa&#7789;, no asa&#7789;, no happiness, etc., no class, no motion, no caste, and no worldly business. All is Brahman only and nothing else&#8212;all is Brahman only and nothing else. There exists then nothing (or statement) as that 'consciousness alone is'; there is (then) no saying such as 'Chi&#7789; is I'. The statement 'I am Brahman' does not exist (then); nor does exist (then) the statement: 'I am the eternally pure'. Whatever is uttered by the mouth, whatever is thought by manas, whatever is determined by bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, whatever is cognized by chi&#7789;&#7789;a&#8212;all these do not exist. There is no Yogin or</p>

<p>The Ve&#7693;as, Sciences, Pur&#257;&#7751;as, effect and cause, &#298;&#347;vara and the world and the elements and mankind&#8212;all these are unreal. There is no doubt of it. Bondage, salvation, happiness, relatives, meditation, chi&#7789;&#7789;a, the &#7692;evas, the demons, the secondary and the primary, the high and the low&#8212;all these are unreal. There is no doubt of it. Whatever is uttered by the mouth, whatever is willed by sa&#7749;kalpa, whatever is thought by manas&#8212;all these are unreal. Whatever is determined by the bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, whatever is cognized by chi&#7789;&#7789;a, whatever is discussed by the religious books, whatever is seen by the eye and heard by the ears, and whatever exists as Sa&#7789;, as also the ear, the eye, and the limbs&#8212;all these are unreal. Whatever is described as such and such, whatever is thought as so-and-so, all the existing thoughts such as 'thou art I', 'that is this,' and 'He is I,' and whatever happens in moksha, as also all sa&#7749;kalpas, delusion, illusory attribution, mysteries and all the diversities of enjoyment and sin&#8212;all these do not exist. So is also not-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Mine and thine, my and thy, for me and for thee, by me and by thee&#8212;all these are unreal. (The statement) that Vish&#7751;u is the preserver, Brahm&#257; is the creator, Ru&#7693;ra is the destroyer&#8212;know that these undoubtedly are false. Bathing, utterings of man&#7789;ras, japas (religious austerities) homa (sacrifice), study of the Ve&#7693;as, worship of the &#7692;evas, man&#7789;ra, &#7789;an&#7789;ra, association with the good, the unfolding of the faults of gu&#7751;as, the working of the internal organ, the result of avi&#7693;y&#257;, and the many crores of mundane eggs&#8212;all these are unreal. Whatever is spoken of as true according to the verdict of all teachers, whatever is seen in this world and whatever exists&#8212;all these are unreal. Whatever is uttered by words, whatever is ascertained, spoken, enjoyed, given or done by anyone, whatever action is done, good or bad, whatever is done as truth&#8212;know all these to be unreal. Thou alone art the transcendental &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and the supreme Guru of the form of &#257;k&#257;&#347;, which is devoid of fitness (for it) and of the nature of all creatures.</p>

Thou art everywhere, of all forms, and full of consciousness. Thou art the truth. Thou art one that has mastered the si&#7693;&#7693;his, and thou art the ancient, the emancipated, emancipation, the nectar of bliss, the God, the quiescent, the diseaseless, Brahman the full, and greater than the great. Thou art impartial, Sa&#7789; and the ancient knowledge, recognised by the words 'Truth, etc'. Thou art devoid of all parts.

There is not an atom which thou dost not penetrate; but yet thou art without it. Thou art devoid of existence and non-existence as also the aim and object aimed at. Thou art changeless, decayless, beyond all n&#257;&#7693;as, without k&#257;la or k&#257;shta (divisions of time) and without Brahm&#257;, Vish&#7751;u, and &#346;iva. Thou lookest into the nature of each and art above the nature of each. Thou art immersed in the bliss of Self. Thou art the monarch of the kingdom of Self, and yet without the conception of Self. Thou art of the nature of fullness and incompleteness. There is nothing that thou seest which is not in thyself. Thou dost not stir out of thy nature. Thou attest according to the nature of each. Thou art nothing but the nature of each. Have no doubt 'thou art I'.</p>

The conception 'I am the body' is spoken of as the knot of the heart, as non-wisdom, as the state of asa&#7789;, as nescience, as the dual, as the true J&#299;va and as with parts, is certainly the great sin, and is the disease generated by the fault of thirst after desires.

<p>&#7770;bhu continued again: "Know everything as Sachchinmaya (full of Sa&#7789; and consciousness). It pervades everything. Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a is non-dual, decayless, alone and other than all. It is 'I'. It alone is &#257;k&#257;&#347; and 'thou'. It is I. There is (in it) no manas, no bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, no aha&#7749;k&#257;ra, no chi&#7789;&#7789;a, or the collection of these&#8212;neither 'thou' nor I, nor anything else nor everything.

<p>"Everything being consciousness alone, there is no fault in anything. Everything being of the nature of Sa&#7789; alone, is Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a only. Brahman alone is everything and there is nothing else. So 'That' is 'I'. 'That' is 'I'. 'That' alone is 'I'. 'That' alone is 'I'. 'That' alone is 'I'. The eternal Brahman alone is 'I'. I am Brahman alone without being subject to mundane existence. I am Brahman alone</p>

<p>without any manas, any bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, organs or body. I am Brahman alone not perceivable. I am Brahman alone and not J&#299;va. I am Brahman alone and not liable to change. I am Brahman alone and not inert. I am Brahman alone and have no death. I am Brahman alone and have no pr&#257;&#7751;as. I am Brahman alone and greater than the great. This is Brahman. Great is Brahman. Truth is Brahman. It is all-pervading. Time is Brahman. K&#257;la is Brahman. Happiness is Brahman. It is self-shining. One is Brahman. Two is Brahman. Delusion is Brahman. K&#257;ma and others are Brahman. Badness is Brahman. Goodness is Brahman. It is of the form of restraint, quiescence, the all-pervading and the all-powerful. The Loka (world) is Brahman. Guru is Brahman. Disciple is Brahman. It is Sa&#7693;&#257;&#347;iva. (That which) is before is Brahman. (That which will be) hereafter is Brahman. Purity is Brahman. Auspiciousness and inauspiciousness are Brahman. J&#299;va always is Brahman. I am Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a. All are of the nature of Brahman. The universe is said to be of the nature of Brahman. Brahman is itself. There is no doubt of it. There is nothing out of itself. The letter Om of the form of consciousness is Brahman alone. Everything is itself. I alone am the whole universe and the highest seat, have crossed the gu&#7751;as and am greater than the great, the supreme Brahman, Guru of Gurus, the support of all and the bliss of bliss. There is no universe besides &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. The universe is of the nature of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. There is nowhere (or no place) without &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. There is not even grass different from &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. There is not husk different from Brahman. The whole universe is of the nature of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. All this is of the nature of Brahman. Asa&#7789; is not of the nature of Brahman. There is not a grass different from Brahman. There is not a seat different from Brahman; there is not a Guru different from Brahman; there is not a body different from Brahman. There is nothing different from Brahman like I-ness or you-ness. Whatever is seen in this world, whatever is spoken of by the people, whatever is enjoyed everywhere&#8212;all these are asa&#7789; (unreal) only. The differences arising from the actor, action, qualities, likes, taste and gender&#8212;all these arise from asa&#7789; and are (but) pleasurable.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The differences arising from time, objects, actions, success or defeat and whatever else&#8212;all these are simply asa&#7789;.

All the pr&#257;&#7751;as, the collections of all these, the five sheaths, the five deities, the six changes, the six enemies, the six seasons, and the six tastes, are asa&#7789;.

<p>"I am the secondless, having j&ntilde;&#257;na and bliss. I am of the nature of an illuminator of all things. I am of the nature of all non-being. I alone shine always. Therefore how can I with such a nature become asa&#7789;? That which is called 'thou' is the great Brahman of the nature of the bliss of consciousness and of the nature of chi&#7789; having chi&#7693;&#257;k&#257;&#347; and chi&#7789; alone as the great bliss. &#256;&#7789;m&#257; alone is 'I'. Asa&#7789; is not 'I'. I am K&#363;tas&#7789;ha, the great guru and Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a alone. I am this born universe. No time, no universe, no m&#257;y&#257;, no prak&#7771;&#7789;i (in me). I alone am the Hari. Personally, I alone am the Sa&#7693;&#257;&#347;iva. I am of the nature of pure consciousness. I am the enjoyer of pure sa&#7789;&#7789;va. I am the only essence full of chi&#7789;. Everything is Brahman and Brahman alone. Everything is Brahman and is chi&#7789; alone. I am of the nature of the all-latent and the all-witness. I am the supreme &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, the supreme Jyo&#7789;is, the supreme wealth, the supreme goal, the essence of all ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;as, the subject discussed in all the &#346;&#257;s&#7789;ras the nature of yogic bliss, the ocean of the chief bliss, the brightness of all wisdom, of the nature of chief wisdom, the brightness of the fourth state and the non-fourth but devoid of them, the indestructible chi&#7789;, truth, V&#257;su&#7693;eva, the birthless, and the deathless Brahm&#257;, Chi&#7693;&#257;k&#257;&#347;, the unconditioned, the stainless, the immaculate, the emancipated, the utterly emancipated, the soulless, the formless and of the nature of the non-created universe.</p>  
<p>"The universe which is assumed as truth and non-truth does not really exist. Brahman is of the nature of eternal bliss and</p>  
<p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></A></p>  
<p>is even by itself. It is endless, decayless, quiescent and of one nature only. If anything is other than myself, then it is as unreal as the mirage in an oasis. If one should be afraid of the son of a barren woman, or if a powerful elephant be killed by means of the horns of a hare, then the world (really is). If one (person) can quench his thirst by drinking the waters of the mirage, or if one should be killed by the horns of a man, then the universe really is. The universe exists always in the true Gan&#7693;harva city (merely unreal). When the blueness of the, sky really exists in it, then the universe really is. When the silver in mother-of-pearl can be used in making an ornament, when a man is bitten by (the conception of) a snake in a rope, when the flaming fire is quenched by means of a golden arrow, when milky food is obtained in the (barren) forest of Vindhya (mountains), when cooking can take place by means of the fuel of (wet) plantain trees, when a female (baby) just born begins to cook, when curds resume the state of milk, or when the milk (milked) goes back through the teats of a cow, then will the universe really be. When the dust of the earth shall be produced in the ocean, when the maddened elephant is tied by means of the hair of a tortoise, when (mountain) Meru is shaken by the thread in the stalk of a lotus, when the ocean is bound by its rows of tides, when the fire flames downwards, when flame shall become (really) cold, when the lotus shall grow out of flaming fire, when In&#7693;ran&#299;la (sapphire) arises in the great mountains, when Meru comes and sits in the lotus-eye, when a mountain can become the offspring of a black bee, when Meru shall shake, when a lion is killed by a gnat, when the three worlds can be found in the space of the hollow of an atom, when the fire which burns a straw shall last for a long time, when the objects seen in a dream shall come in the waking state, when the current of a river shall stand still (of itself), when the delivery of a barren woman shall be fruitful, when the crow shall walk like a swan, when the mule shall fight with a lion, when a great ass shall walk like an elephant, when the full moon shall become a sun, when R&#257;hu (one of the nodes) shall abandon the sun and the moon, when a good crop shall arise out of the</p>  
<p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></A></p>  
<p>waste (burnt) seeds, when the poor shall enjoy the happiness of the rich, when the lions shall be conquered by the bravery of dogs, when the heart of J&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;s is known by fools, when the ocean is drunk by the dogs without any remainder, when the pure &#257;k&#257;&#347; shall fall upon men, when heaven shall fall on the earth, when the flower in the sky shall emit fragrance, when a forest appearing in pure &#257;k&#257;&#347; shall move, and when reflection shall arise in a glass simply (without mercury or anything else in its back), then the world really is. There is no universe in the womb of Aja (the unborn Brahman)&#8212;there is no universe in the womb of &#256;&#7789;ma. Duality and non-duality, which are but the results of differentiation, are really not. All this is the result of m&#257;y&#257;. Therefore, there should be Brahma-Bh&#257;van&#257;. If misery should arise from the conception of 'I am the body,' then it is certain 'I am Brahman.' The knot of the heart is the wheel of Brahman, which cuts asunder the knot of existence. When doubt arises in one, he should have faith in Brahman. That non-dual Brahman, which is eternal and of the form of unconditioned bliss, is the guard of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; against the chief of the form of not-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Through instances like the above is established the nature of Brahman. Brahman alone is the all-abode. Abandon the name even of the universe. Knowing for certain 'I am Brahman,' give up the 'I'. Everything disappears as the flower from the hands of a sleeping person. There is neither body nor karma. Everything is Brahman alone. There are neither objects, nor actions, nor the four states. Everything which has the three characteristics of vij&ntilde;&#257;na is Brahman alone. Abandoning all action, contemplate 'I am Brahman,' 'I am Brahman'. There is no doubt of this. I am Brahman of the nature of chi&#7789;. I am of the nature of Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a.</p>  
<p>"This great science of &#346;a&#7749;kara should never be explained to any ordinary person, to an atheist or to a faithless, ill-behaved or evil-minded person. It should be, after due examination, given to the high-souled ones whose minds are purified with devotion to their gurus. It should be taught for a year and a half. Leaving off thoroughly and entirely the practice</p>  
<p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></A></p>  
<p>recommended by the (other) Upanisha&#7693;s, one should study the &#7788;ejobin&#7693;u-Upanisha&#7693; always with delight. By once studying it, he becomes one with Brahman. Thus ends the sixth chapter. Thus ends the Upanisha&#7693;."</p>
