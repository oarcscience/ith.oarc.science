<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Harih-Om</span>. I shall relate in the form of a catechism whatever should be known for the removal of all miseries that befall these ignorant creatures [men].</p>  
<p>What is Brahman? Who is &#298;&#347;wara? Who is J&#299;va? What is Prak&#7771;&#7789;i? Who is Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;? Who is Brahm&#257;? Who is Vish&#7751;u? Who is Ru&#7693;ra? Who is In&#7693;ra? Who is Yama? Who is S&#363;rya? Who is Chan&#7693;ra? Who are &#7692;evas? Who are R&#257;kshasas? Who are Pi&#347;&#257;chas? Who are Manushyas? Who are Women? Who are Pa&#347;us, etc.? What is S&#7789;h&#257;vara? Who are Brahmans and others? What is J&#257;&#7789;i (caste)? What is Karma? What is Akarma? What is J&ntilde;&#257;na? What is Aj&ntilde;&#257;na? What is Sukha? What is &#7692;u&#7717;kha? What is Swarga? What is Naraka? What is Ban&#7693;ha? What is Moksha? Who is Up&#257;sya? Who is Vi&#7693;w&#257;n? Who is M&#363;dha? What is &#256;sura? What is &#7788;apas? What is Paramapa&#7693;a? What is Gr&#257;hya? What is Agr&#257;hya? Who is Sanny&#257;si? Thus are the questions.</p>  
<p>1. What is Brahman?</p>  
<p>It is the Chai&#7789;anya that appears, through the aspects of Karma and J&ntilde;&#257;na, as this vast mundane egg composed of Maha&#7789;, Aha&#7749;k&#257;ra and the five elements, earth, water, fire, V&#257;yu and <A HREF="errata.htm#2">&#256;k&#257;&#347;</A>&#8212;that is secondless&#8212;that is devoid of all Up&#257;&#7693;his [vehicles], that is full of all &#346;ak&#7789;is [potencies], that is without beginning and end, that is described as pure, beneficial, peaceful, and Gu&#7751;a-less and that is indescribable.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></A></p>  
<p>2. Who is &#298;&#347;wara? and what are His characteristics?</p>  
<p><A HREF="errata.htm#3">Brahman</A> itself, having through His &#346;ak&#7789;i called Prak&#7771;&#7789;i (matter) created the worlds and being latent in them, becomes the ruler of Bu&#7693;&#7693;hi and In&#7693;riyas (organs of sense and action) as well as Brahma (the creator) and others. Hence he is named &#298;&#347;wara.</p>  
<p>3. Who is J&#299;va?</p>  
<p>&#298;&#347;wara Himself, subject to the false superimposition upon Himself [of the idea] "I am the gross" through the [assumption of the] names and forms of Brahm&#257;, Vish&#7751;u, Ru&#7693;ra, In&#7693;ra, and others is J&#299;va. Though one, he appears as many J&#299;vas, through the force of the different Karmas originating the bodies.</p>  
<p>4. What is Prak&#7771;&#7789;i (matter)?</p>  
<p>It is nothing else but the &#346;ak&#7789;i [potency] of Brahman which is of the nature of Bu&#7693;&#7693;hi that is able to produce the many motley worlds by virtue of the mere presence of Brahman.</p>  
<p>5. What is Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;?</p>  
<p>The supreme &#256;&#7789;m&#257; or soul. It is Brahman alone that is Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; as it (the former) is far superior to bodies and others.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">6. Who is Brahm&#257; [the creator]?<br> 7. Who is Vish&#7751;u [the preserver]?<br> 8. Who is Ru&#7693;ra [the destroyer]?<br> 9. Who is In&#7693;ra?<br> 10. Who is Yama [the angel of death]?<br> 11. Who is S&#363;rya [the Sun]?<br> 12. Who is Chan&#7693;ra [the Moon]?<br> 13. Who are &#7692;evas [the Angels]?<br> 14. Who are Asuras [the Demons]?<br> 15. Who are Pi&#347;&#257;chas [the evil spirits]?<br> 16. Who are Manushyas [the men]?<br> 17. Who are Women?<br> 18. What are beasts, etc.?<br> 19. What are the S&#7789;h&#257;varas [fixed ones]?<br> 20. Who are Brahmans and others?</div></p>  
<p>That Brahman is Brahm&#257;, Vish&#7751;u, Ru&#7693;ra and In&#7693;ra, Yama, Sun and Moon, &#7692;evas, Asuras, Pi&#347;&#257;chas, men, women, beasts, etc., the fixed ones, Brahmans and others. Here there is no manyness in the least degree: all this is verily Brahman.</p>  
<p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></A></p>  
<p>21. What is J&#257;&#7789;i (caste)</p>  
<p>It cannot refer to the skin, the blood, the flesh or the bone. There is no caste for &#256;&#7789;m&#257;; caste is only conventional.</p>  
<p>22. What is Karma?</p>  
<p>Karma is that action alone which is performed by the organs and ascribed to &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as "I do" (<i>viz</i>., agency being attributed to &#256;&#7789;m&#257;).</p>  
<p>23. What is Akarma [or non-Karma]?</p>  
<p>Akarma is the performance, without any desire for the fruits, of the daily and occasional rites, sacrifices, vows, austerities, gifts and other actions that are associated with the egoism of the actor and the enjoyer, and that are productive of bondage, rebirth, etc.</p>  
<p>24. What is J&ntilde;&#257;na?</p>  
<p>It is the realisation by direct cognition of the fact that in this changing universe there is nothing but Chai&#7789;anya [the one life] that is Consciousness, that is of the form of the seer and the seen, pervading all things, that is the same in all, and that is not subject to changes like pot, cloth, etc. This realisation is brought about by means of the subjugation of the body and the senses, the serving of a good Guru (teacher), the hearing of the exposition of Ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;ic doctrines and constant meditation thereon.</p>  
<p>25. What is Aj&ntilde;&#257;na?</p>  
<p>It is the illusory attribution, like the snake in the rope, of many &#256;&#7789;m&#257;s (souls) through the diverse Up&#257;&#7693;his [or vehicles] of the angels, beasts, men, the fixed ones, females, males, castes and orders of life, bondage and emancipation, etc., to Brahman that is secondless, all-permeating and of the nature of all.</p>  
<p>26. What is Sukha (happiness)?</p>  
<p>It is a state of being of the nature of bliss, having cognized through experience the Reality of Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a [or that which is be-ness, consciousness and bliss].</p>  
<p>27. What is &#7692;u&#7717;kha (pains)?</p>  
<p>It is the mere Sa&#7749;kalpa [or the thinking] of the objects of mundane existence [or of not-Self according to the Bombay Edition].</p>  
<p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></A></p>  
<p>28. What is Swarga (heaven)?</p>  
<p>It is the association with Sa&#7789; [either good men or Brahman which is Sa&#7789;, the true].</p>  
<p>29. What is Naraka (hell)?</p>  
<p>It is the association with that which brings about this mundane existence which is Asa&#7789; [the false].</p>  
<p>30. What is Ban&#7693;ha [bondage]?</p>  
<p>Such Sa&#7749;kalpas [thoughts] as "I was born," etc., arising from the affinities of beginningless Aj&ntilde;&#257;na form bondage.</p>  
<p>The thought obscuration [or mental ignorance] of the mundane existence of "mine" in such as father, mother, brother, wife, child, house, gardens, lands, etc., forms bondage.</p>  
<p>The thoughts of I-ness as actor, etc., are bondage.</p>  
<p>The thought of the development in oneself of the eight Si&#7693;&#7693;his (higher psychical powers) as Anima and others&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is bondage.</p>  
<p>The thought of propitiating the angels, men, etc., is bondage. The thought of going through the eight means of Yoga&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> practice, Yama, etc., is bondage.</p>  
<p>The thought of performing the duties of one's own caste and order of life is bondage.</p>  
<p>The thought that command, fear and doubt are the attributes of [or pertain to] &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is bondage.</p>  
<p>The thought of knowing the rules of performing sacrifices, vows, austerity and gift is bondage. Even the mere thought of desire for Moksha (emancipation) is bondage. By the very act of thought, bondage is caused.</p>  
<p>31. What is Moksha [emancipation]?</p>  
<p>Moksha is the (state of) the annihilation, through the discrimination of the eternal from the non-eternal, of all thoughts of bondage, like those of "mine" in objects of pleasure and pain, lands, etc., in this transitory mundane existence.</p>  
<p>32. Who is Up&#257;sya [or fit to be worshipped]?</p>  
<p>That Guru (or spiritual instructor) who enables (the disciple) to attain to Brahman, the Consciousness that is in all bodies.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></A></p>  
<p>33. Who is &#346;ishya (the disciple)?</p>  
<p>The disciple is that Brahman alone that remains after the consciousness of the universe has been lost (in him) through Br&#257;hmic wisdom.</p>  
<p>34. Who is Vi&#7693;w&#257;n (the learned)?</p>  
<p>It is he who has cognized the true form (or reality) of his own consciousness that is latent in all.</p>  
<p>35. Who is M&#363;dha [the ignorant]?</p>  
<p>He who has the egoistic conception of the body, caste, orders of life, actor, enjoyer and others.</p>  
<p>36. What is &#256;sura [the demoniacal]?</p>  
<p>It is the &#7788;apas [austerity] practised by one inflicting trouble on the &#256;&#7789;m&#257; within through Japa [or inaudible muttering of Man&#7789;ras], abstinence from food, Agniho&#7789;ra [the performance of the worship of fire], etc., attended with cruel desire, hatred, pain, hypocrisy and the rest for the purpose of acquiring the powers of Vish&#7751;u, Brahma, Ru&#7693;ra, In&#7693;ra and others.</p>  
<p>37. What is &#7788;apas?</p>  
<p>&#7788;apas is the act of burning&#8212;through the fire of direct cognition of the knowledge that Brahman is the truth and the universe, a myth&#8212;the seed of the deep-rooted desire to attain the powers of Brahma, etc.</p>  
<p>38. What is Paramapa&#7693;a [the supreme abode]?</p>  
<p>It is the seat of the eternal and emancipated Brahman which is far superior to Pr&#257;&#7751;as (the vital airs), the organs of sense and actions, the internal organs (of thought), the Gu&#7751;as and others, which is of the nature of Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a and which is the witness to all.</p>  
<p>39. What is Gr&#257;hya [or fit to be taken in]?</p>  
<p>Only that Reality of Absolute Consciousness which is not conditioned by space, time or substance.</p>  
<p>40. What is Agr&#257;hya?</p>  
<p>The thought that this universe is truth&#8212;this universe which is different from one's Self and which being subject to M&#257;y&#257; (or illusion) forms the object of (cognition of) Bu&#7693;&#7693;hi and the organs.</p>  
<p>41. Who is the Sanny&#257;si [ascetic]?</p>  
<p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></A></p>  
<p>A Sanny&#257;si is an ascetic who having given up all the duties of caste and orders of life, good and bad actions, etc., being freed from [the conceptions of] "I" and "mine" and having taken his refuge in Brahman alone, roams at large practising Nirvikalpa Sam&#257;&#7693;hi and being firmly convinced of "I am Brahman" through the realisation of the meaning of such sacred (Vedic) sentences as "Thou art That" "All this is verily Brahman" and "Here there is no manyness in the least". He only is an emancipated person. He only is fit to be adored. He only is a Yogin. He only is a Paramahamsa. He only is an Ava&#7693;h&#363;&#7789;a. He only is a Brahman. Whoever studies the Nir&#257;lamba-Upanisha&#7693; becomes, through the grace of Guru, pure like fire. Ho becomes pure like V&#257;yu (air). He does not return. He is not born again: nay he is not born again.</p>  
<p>Such is the Upanisha&#7693;.</p>
