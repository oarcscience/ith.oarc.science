<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> wise, having studied the &#346;&#257;s&#7789;ras and reflected on them again and again and having come to know Brahman, should abandon them all like a firebrand. Having ascended the car of Om with Vish&#7751;u (the Higher Self) as the charioteer, one wishing to go to the seat of Brahmaloka intent on the worship of Ru&#7693;ra, should go in the chariot so long as he can go. Then abandoning the car, he reaches the place of the Lord of the car. Having given up m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;, li&#7749;ga,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and pa&#7693;a,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> he attains the subtle pa&#7693;a (seat or word) without vowels or consonants by means of the letter M without the svara (accent). That is called pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra when one merely thinks of the five objects of sense, such as sound, etc., as also the very unsteady mind as the reins of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra (subjugation of the senses), &#7693;hy&#257;na (contemplation), pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma (control of breath), &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257; (concentration), t&#257;rka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and sam&#257;&#7693;hi are said to be the six parts of yoga. Just as the impurities of mountain-minerals are burnt by the blower, so the stains committed by the organs are burned by checking pr&#257;&#7751;a. Through pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;mas should be burnt the stains; through &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;, the sins; through pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra,</p>

<p>the (bad) associations; and through &#7693;hy&#257;na, the godless qualities. Having destroyed the sins, one should think of Ruchira (the shining). Ruchira (cessation), expiration and inspiration&#8212;these three are pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma of (rechaka, p&#363;raka and kumbhaka) expiration, inspiration and cessation of breath. That is called (one) pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma when one repeats with a prolonged (or elongated) breath three times the G&#257;ya&#7789;r&#299; with its vy&#257;h&#7771;&#7789;is and Pra&#7751;ava (before it) along with the &#347;iras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (the head) joining after it. Raising up the v&#257;yu from the &#257;k&#257;&#347; (region, <i>viz</i>., the heart) and making the body void (of v&#257;yu) and empty and uniting (the soul) to the state of void, is called rechaka (expiration). That is called p&#363;raka (inspiration) when one takes in v&#257;yu, as a man would take water into his mouth through the lotus-stalk. That is called kumbhaka (cessation of breath) when there is no expiration or inspiration and the body is motionless, remaining still in one state. Then he sees forms like the blind, hears sounds like the deaf and sees the body like wood. This is the characteristic of one that has attained much quiescence. That is called &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257; when the wise man regards the mind as sa&#7749;kalpa and merging sa&#7749;kalpa into &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, contemplates upon his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; (alone). That is called t&#257;rka when one makes inference which does not conflict with the Ve&#7693;as. That is called sam&#257;&#7693;hi in which one, on attaining it, thinks (all) equal.</p>  
<p>Seating himself on the ground on a seat of ku&#347;a grass which is pleasant and devoid of all evils, having protected himself mentally (from all evil influences), uttering ra&#7789;ha-ma&#7751;dala,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> assuming either pa&#7693;ma, svas&#7789;ika, or bha&#7693;ra posture or any other which can be practised easily, facing the north and closing the nostril with the thumb, one should inspire through the other nostril and retain breath inside and preserve the Agni (fire). Then he should think of the sound (Om) alone. Om, the one letter is Brahman; Om should not be breathed out. Through this divine man&#7789;ra (Om), it should be done many times to rid himself of</p>

<p>impurity. Then as said before, the man&#7789;ra-.knowing wise should regularly meditate, beginning with the navel upwards in the gross, the primary (or less) gross and subtle (states). The greatly wise should give up all (sight) seeing across, up or down, and should practise yoga always being motionless and without tremor. The union as stated (done) by remaining without tremor in the hollow stalk (<i>viz</i>., Sushumn&#257;) alone is &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;. The yoga with the ordained duration of twelve m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s is called (&#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;). That which never decays is Akshara (Om) which is without ghosha (third, fourth, and fifth letters from K), consonant, vowel, palatal, guttural, nasal, letter R and sibilants. Pr&#257;&#7751;a travels through (or goes by) that path through which this Akshara (Om) goes. Therefore it should be practised daily, in order to pass along that (course). It is through the opening (or hole) of the heart, through the opening of v&#257;yu (probably navel), through the opening of the head and through the opening of moksha. They call it bila (cave), sushira (hole), or ma&#7751;dala (wheel).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>(Then about the obstacles of yogi). A yogin should always avoid fear, anger, laziness, too much sleep or waking and too much food or fasting. If the above rule be well and strictly practised each day, spiritual wisdom will arise of itself in three months without doubt. In four months, he sees the &#7693;evas; in five months, he knows (or becomes) Brahmanishtha; and truly in six months he attains Kaivalya at will. There is no doubt.</p>  
<p>That which is of the earth is of five m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s (or it takes five m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s to pronounce P&#257;r&#7789;hiva-Pra&#7751;ava). That which is of water of four m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s; of agni, three m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s; of v&#257;yu, two; and of &#257;k&#257;&#347;, one. But he should think of that which is with no m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s. Having united &#256;&#7789;m&#257; with manas, one should contemplate upon &#256;&#7789;m&#257; by means of &#257;&#7789;m&#257;. Pr&#257;&#7751;&#257; is thirty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> digits long. Such is the position (or range) of pr&#257;&#7751;as. That is called Pr&#257;&#7751;a which is the seat of the external pr&#257;&#7751;as. The breaths by</p>

<p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></A></p>  
<p>day and night are numbered as 1,13,180.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (Of the pr&#257;&#7751;as) the first (<i>viz</i>.,) Pr&#257;&#7751;a is pervading the heart; Ap&#257;na, the anus; Sam&#257;na, the navel; U&#7693;&#257;na, the throat; and Vy&#257;na, all parts of the body. Then come the colours of the five pr&#257;&#7751;as in order. Pr&#257;&#7751;a is said to be of the colour of a blood-red gem (or coral); Ap&#257;na which is in the middle is of the colour of In&#7693;ragopa (an insect of white or red colour); Sam&#257;na is between the colour of pure milk and crystal (or oily and shining), between both (Pr&#257;&#7751;a and Ap&#257;na): U&#7693;&#257;na is ap&#257;&#7751;dara (pale white); and Vy&#257;na resembles the colour of archis (or ray of light). That man is never reborn wherever he may die, whose breath goes out of the head after piercing through this ma&#7751;dala (of the pineal gland). That man is never reborn.</p>
