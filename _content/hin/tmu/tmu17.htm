<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>. The body is a compound of p&#7771;&#7789;hiv&#299; (earth) and other mah&#257;bh&#363;&#7789;as (primordial elements, as pas or water, agni or fire, v&#257;yu or air, and &#257;k&#257;&#347;). (In the body), that which is hard is (of the essence of) earth; that which is liquid is (of the essence of) water; that which is hot is (of the essence of) fire; that which moves about is (of the essence of) v&#257;yu; that which is perforated is (of the essence of) &#257;k&#257;&#347;. The ear and others are the j&ntilde;&#257;nen&#7693;riyas (organs of sense). The ear is of the essence of &#257;k&#257;&#347;, the skin of the essence of v&#257;yu, the eye of the essence of fire, the tongue of the essence of water, and the nose of the essence of earth; sound, touch, form, taste, and odour being respectively the objects of perception for these organs. These arose respectively out of the primordial elements, beginning with earth. The mouth, the hands, the legs, the organs of excretion and the organs of generation are the karmen&#7693;riyas (or organs of action). Their functions are respectively talking, lifting, walking, excretion, and enjoyment. An&#7789;a&#7717;kara&#7751;a (or the internal organ) is of four kinds&#8212;manas, bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, aha&#7749;k&#257;ra, and chi&#7789;&#7789;a. Their functions are respectively sa&#7749;kalpa-vikalpa, (or will-thought and doubt), determination, egoism, and memory. The seat of manas is the end of the throat, that of bu&#7693;&#7693;hi the face, that of aha&#7749;k&#257;ra the heart, and that of chi&#7789;&#7789;a the navel. The bone, skin, n&#257;dis, nerves, hair, and flesh are of the essence of earth. Urine,</p>

<p>phlegm, blood, &#347;ukla (or sperm), and sweat are of the essence of water. Hunger, thirst, sloth, delusion, and (desire of) copulation are of the essence of fire. Walking, scratching, opening and closing the gross eyes, etc., are of the essence of v&#257;yu. Desire, anger, avarice, delusion, and fear are of the essence of &#257;k&#257;&#347;. Sound, touch, form, taste, and odour are the properties of earth: sound, touch, form, and taste are the properties of water: sound, touch, and form, are the properties of fire: sound and touch are the properties of v&#257;yu: sound alone is the property of &#257;k&#257;&#347;. There are three gu&#7751;as (or qualities), s&#257;&#7789;&#7789;vika, r&#257;jasa, and &#7789;&#257;masa. Non-killing, veracity, not stealing, continence, non-covetousness, refraining from anger, serving the guru, purity (in mind and body), contentment, right conduct, abstinence from self-praise, freedom from pompousness, firm conviction in the existence of God, and not causing any injury to others&#8212;all these are to be known as s&#257;&#7789;&#7789;vika-gu&#7751;as chiefly. I am the actor, I am the enjoyer, I am the speaker, and I am the egoistic&#8212;such are said by knowers of Brahman to be r&#257;jasa-gu&#7751;as. Sleep, sloth, delusion, desire, copulation, and theft are said by expounders of the Ve&#7693;as to be &#7789;&#257;masa-gu&#7751;as. Those having sa&#7789;&#7789;va-gu&#7751;a (go) up (<i>viz</i>., to higher spheres)&#8212;those having r&#257;jasa-gu&#7751;a (stay) in the middle (<i>viz</i>., the sphere of earth)&#8212;those having &#7789;&#257;masa-gu&#7751;a (go) down (<i>viz</i>., to hell, etc.). Perfect (or divine) knowledge is of s&#257;&#7789;&#7789;vika-gu&#7751;a; knowledge of &#7693;harma is of r&#257;jasa-gu&#7751;a, and mental darkness is of &#7789;&#257;masa. J&#257;gra&#7789;a (waking state), svapna (dreaming state), sushup&#7789;i (dreamless sleeping state), and &#7789;urya (the fourth state beyond these three) are the four states. J&#257;gra&#7789;a is (the state) having (the play of) the fourteen organs, the organs of sense (five), the organs of action (five), and the four internal organs. Svapna is (the state) associated with the four internal organs. Sushup&#7789;i is (the state) where the chi&#7789;&#7789;a is the only organ. &#7788;urya is that state having j&#299;va alone. Regarding j&#299;v&#257;&#7789;m&#257; and Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; (enjoying the three states) of a person with opened eyes, with closed eyes, and with eyes in an intermediate state with neither, j&#299;va is said to be the Kshe&#7789;raj&ntilde;a (the lord of the body). The organs of sense</p>  
<p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (five), the organs of action (five), pr&#257;&#7751;as (five), manas, and bu&#7693;&#7693;hi&#8212;all these seventeen are said to constitute the s&#363;kshma or li&#7749;ga (<i>viz</i>., subtle) body. Manas, bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, aha&#7749;k&#257;ra, &#257;k&#257;&#347;, v&#257;yu, fire, water, and earth&#8212;these are the eight prak&#7771;&#7789;is (or matter): ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose the fifth, the organs of excretion, the organs of secretion, hands, legs, speech the tenth, sound, form, touch, taste, and odour are the fifteen modifications (of the above eight prak&#7771;&#7789;is). Therefore the &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;vas are twenty-three. The twenty-fourth is avyak&#7789;a (the undifferentiated matter) or pra&#7693;h&#257;na. Purusha is other than (or superior to) this. Thus is the Upanisha&#7693;.</p>
