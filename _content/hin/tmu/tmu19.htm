<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>. B&#7771;haspa&#7789;i asked Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya: "That which is called Kurukshe&#7789;ra is the place of the sacrifice of the &#7692;evas and the spiritual seat of all beings. Therefore where should one go in order that he may cognize Kurukshe&#7789;ra, the place of the sacrifice of the &#7692;evas and the spiritual seat of all beings?" (To which Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya replied:) "Avimuk&#7789;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is Kurukshe&#7789;ra, the place of the sacrifice of the &#7692;evas and of the study of Brahman, because it is there that Ru&#7693;ra initiates one into the &#7788;&#257;raka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Brahman when pr&#257;&#7751;a (life) goes out. Through this, one becomes immortal and the enjoyer of moksha. Therefore one should always be in the midst of that place avimuk&#7789;a, and should never leave, O reverend sir, avimuk&#7789;a." Thus said Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya.</p>  
<p>Then Bh&#257;ra&#7693;v&#257;ja asked Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya: "What is &#7789;&#257;raka? what is that which causes one to cross (this mundane existence)." To which Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya replied: "Om-Nam&#333;-N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;&#257;ya is the &#7789;&#257;raka. It should be worshipped as Chi&#7693;&#257;&#7789;ma. Om is a single syllable and of the nature of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. N amah is of two syllables and is of the nature of prak&#7771;&#7789;i (matter). N&#257;r&#257;yar&#7751;&#257;ya is of five syllables and is of the nature of Parabrahman. He who knows this becomes immortal. Through Om, is Brahma produced; through <i>Na</i> is Vish&#7751;u produced; through <i>Ma</i> is Ru&#7693;ra produced; through <i>N&#257;</i> is &#298;&#347;vara produced; through <i>R&#257;</i> is the A&#7751;da-Vir&#257;t (or Vir&#257;t of the universe) produced; through <i>Ya</i> is</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Purusha produced; through <i>N&#257;</i> is Bhagav&#257;n (Lord) produced; and through <i>Ya</i> is Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; produced. This Asht&#257;kshara (eight syllables) of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is the supreme and the highest Purusha. Thus is the &#7770;gve&#7693;a with the first foot (or half). That which is Om is the indestructible, the supreme, and Brahman. That alone should be worshipped. It is this that is of the eight subtle syllables. And this becomes eight, being of eight forms. A is the first letter; U is the second; M is the third; Bin&#7693;u is the fourth; N&#257;&#7693;a is the fifth; Kal&#257; is the sixth; Kal&#257;&#7789;&#299;&#7789;a (that beyond kal&#257;) is the seventh; and that which is beyond these is the eighth. It is called &#7788;&#257;raka, because it enables one to cross this mundane existence. Know that &#7788;&#257;raka alone is Brahman and it alone should be worshipped." The (following) verses may be quoted here: "From the letter A came Brahm&#257; named J&#257;mbav&#257;n (the bear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>). From the letter U came Upen&#7693;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, named Hari. From the letter M came &#346;iva, known as Hanum&#257;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Bin&#7693;u is named &#298;&#347;vara and is &#346;a&#7789;rughna, the Lord of the discus itself. N&#257;&#7693;a should be known as the great Lord named Bhara&#7789;a and the sound of the conch itself. From Kal&#257; came the Purusha himself as Lakshma&#7751;a and the bearer of the earth. Kal&#257;&#7789;&#299;&#7789;a is known as the goddess S&#299;&#7789;&#257; Herself. That which is beyond is the Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; named &#346;r&#299;-R&#257;ma and is the highest Purusha. All this is the explanation of the letter Om, which is the past, the present, and future, and which is other than these (<i>viz</i>.,) &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;va, man&#7789;ra, var&#7751;a, (colour), &#7693;eva&#7789;&#257; (deity), chhan&#7693;as (metre), &#7771;k, k&#257;la, &#347;ak&#7789;i, and s&#7771;shti (creation). He who knows this becomes immortal. (Thus is) Yajurve&#7693;a with the second foot."</p>  
<p>Then Bh&#257;ra&#7693;v&#257;ja asked Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya: "Through what man&#7789;ra is Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; pleased and shows his own &#256;&#7789;m&#257; (to persons)? Please tell this." Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya replied:</p>  
<p>"(1st Man&#7789;ra:) Om. He who is &#346;r&#299;-Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and the Lord described by (the letter) A and is J&#257;mbav&#257;n (the bear) and Bh&#363;&#7717;, Bhuva&#7717;, and Suva&#7717;: Salutation to Him."</p>

<p>"(3rd Man&#7789;ra:) Om. He who is &#346;ri-Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and the Lord described by (the letter) M and is of the form of &#346;iva (or), Hanum&#257;n and Bh&#363;&#7717;, Bhuva&#7717;, and Suva&#7717;: Salutation to Him.</p>

<p>"(8th Man&#7789;ra:) Om.

I am R&#257;ma and the Bh&#363;&#7717;, Bhuva&#7717;, and Suva&#7717;: Salutation to Him."</p>  
<p>He who has mastered this eightfold man&#7789;ra is purified by Agni; he is purified by V&#257;yu; he is purified by the sun; he is purified by &#346;iva; he is known by all the &#7692;evas. He attains the fruit of reciting I&#7789;ih&#257;sas, Pur&#257;&#7751;as, Ru&#7693;ra (Man&#7789;ras), a hundred thousand times. He who repeatedly remembers (or recites) the Asht&#257;kshara (the eight-syllabled man&#7789;ra) of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a gains the fruit of the recitation of G&#257;ya&#7789;r&#299; a hundred thousand times or of Pra&#7751;ava (Om) a myriad of times. He purifies (his ancestors) ten (degrees) above and (his descendants) ten</p>

<p>Like the eye (which sees without any obstacle) the things spread (in the sky), the wise ever see this supreme seat of Vish&#7751;u. Br&#257;hma&#7751;as who are spiritually awake praise in diverse ways and illuminate the supreme abode of Vish&#7751;u. Thus is the Upanisha&#7693;. (Thus is) the S&#257;mave&#7693;a with the third foot.</p>
