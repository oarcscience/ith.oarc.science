<p>The Bh&#363;rloka is situated in its feet; the Bhuvarloka, in its knees; the Suvarloka, in its loins; and the Maharloka, in its navel.</p>  
<p>In its heart is situate the Janoloka; the &#7789;apoloka in its throat, and the Sa&#7789;yaloka in the centre of the forehead between the eyebrows.</p>  
<p>Then the m&#257;&#7789;r&#257; (or man&#7789;ra) beyond the Sahasr&#257;ra (thousand-rayed) is explained (<i>viz</i>.,) should be explained.</p>  
<p>An adept in yoga who bestrides the Hamsa (bird) thus (<i>viz</i>., contemplates on Om) is not affected by karmic influences or by tens of crores of sins.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p>The first m&#257;&#7789;r&#257; has agni as its &#7693;eva&#7789;&#257; (presiding deity); the second, vayu as its &#7693;eva&#7789;&#257;; the next m&#257;&#7789;r&#257; is resplendent like the sphere of the sun and the last, the Ar&#7693;ham&#257;&#7789;r&#257; the wise know as belonging to Varu&#7751;a (the presiding deity of water) .</p>  
<p>Each of these m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s has indeed three kal&#257;s (parts). This is called Omk&#257;ra. Know it by means of the &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;s, <i>viz</i>., concentration on each of the twelve kal&#257;s, or the variations of the m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s produced by the difference of svaras or intonation). The first m&#257;&#7789;r&#257; is called ghoshi&#7751;&#299;; the second, vi&#7693;yunm&#257;li (or vi&#7693;yunm&#257;&#7789;r&#257;); the third, pa&#7789;a&#7749;gin&#299;; the fourth, v&#257;yuvegin&#299;; the fifth, n&#257;ma&#7693;heya; the sixth, ain&#7693;r&#299;; the seventh, vaish&#7751;av&#299;; the eighth, &#347;&#257;&#7749;kar&#299;; the ninth, maha&#7789;&#299;; the tenth, &#7693;h&#7771;&#7789;i (&#7693;hruva, Calcutta ed.); the eleventh, n&#257;r&#299; (mauni, Calcutta ed.); and the twelfth, br&#257;hm&#299;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>If a person happens to die in the first m&#257;&#7789;r&#257; (while contemplating on it), he is born again as. a great emperor in Bh&#257;ra&#7789;avarsha.</p>  
<p>If in the second m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;, he becomes an illustrious yaksha; if in the third m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;, a vi&#7693;y&#257;&#7693;hara; if in the fourth, a gan&#7693;harva (these three being the celestial hosts).</p>  
<p>If he happens to die in the fifth, <i>viz</i>., ar&#7693;ham&#257;&#7789;r&#257;, he lives in the world of the moon, with the rank of a &#7693;eva greatly glorified there.</p>  
<p>If in the sixth, he merges into In&#7693;ra; if in the seventh, he reaches the seat of Vish&#7751;u; if in the eighth, Ru&#7693;ra, the Lord of all creatures.</p>  
<p>If in the ninth, in Maharloka; if in the tenth, in Janoloka (&#7692;hruvaloka, Calcutta ed.); if in the eleventh, &#7788;apoloka, and if in the twelfth, he attains the eternal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> state of Brahma.</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></A></p>  
<p>That which is beyond these, (<i>viz</i>.,) Parabrahman which is beyond (the above m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s), the pure, the all-pervading, beyond kal&#257;s, the ever resplendent and the source of all jyo&#7789;is (light) should be known.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> When the mind goes beyond the organs and the gu&#7751;&#257;s and is absorbed, having no separate existence and no mental action, then (the guru) should instruct him (as to his further course of development).</p>  
<p>That person always engaged in its contemplation and always absorbed in it should gradually leave off his body (or family) following the course of yoga and avoiding all intercourse with society.</p>  
<p>Then he, being freed from the bonds of karma and the existence as a j&#299;va and being pure, enjoys the supreme bliss by his attaining of the state of Brahm&#257;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>O intelligent man, spend your life always in the knowing of the supreme bliss, enjoying the whole of your pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha (that portion of past karma now being enjoyed) without making ally complaint (of it).</p>  
<p>Even after &#257;&#7789;maj&ntilde;&#257;na (knowledge of Mind or Self) has awakened (in one), pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha does not leave (him); but he does not feel pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha after the dawning of &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;vaj&ntilde;&#257;na&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (knowledge of &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;va or truth) because the body and other things are asa&#7789; (unreal), like the things seen in a dream to one on awaking from it.</p>  
<p>That (portion of the) karma which is done in former births, and called pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha does not at all affect the person (&#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;vaj&ntilde;&#257;n&#299;), as there is no rebirth 'to him.</p>  
<p>As the body that exists in the dreaming state is untrue, so is this body. Where then is rebirth to a thing that is illusory? How can a thing have any existence, when there is no birth (to it)?</p>  
<p>As the clay is the material cause of the pot, so one learns from Ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;a that aj&ntilde;&#257;na is the material cause of the</p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="green">p. 257</font></A></p>  
<p>universe: and when aj&ntilde;&#257;na ceases to exist, where then is the cosmos?</p>  
<p>As a person through illusion mistakes a rope for a serpent, so the fool not knowing Sa&#7789;ya (the eternal truth) sees the world (to be true.)</p>  
<p>When he knows it to be a piece of rope, the illusory idea of a serpent vanishes.</p>  
<p>So when he knows the eternal substratum of everything and all the universe becomes (therefore) void (to him), where then is pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha to him, the body being a part of the world? Therefore the word pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha is accepted to enlighten the ignorant (only).</p>  
<p>Then as pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha has, in course of time, worn out, he who is the sound resulting from the union of Pra&#7751;ava with Brahman who is the absolute effulgence itself, and who is the bestower of all good, shines himself like the sun at the dispersion of the clouds.</p>  
<p>The yogin being in the si&#7693;&#7693;h&#257;sana (posture) and practising the vaish&#7751;av&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257;, should always hear the internal sound through the right ear.</p>  
<p>The sound which he thus practises makes him deaf to all external sounds. Having overcome all obstacles, he enters the &#7789;urya state within fifteen days.</p>  
<p>In the beginning of his practice, he hears many loud sounds. They gradually increase in pitch and are heard more and more subtly.</p>  
<p>At first, the sounds are like those proceeding from- the ocean, clouds, kettle-drum, and cataracts: in the middle (stage) those proceeding from mar&#7693;ala (a musical instrument), bell, and horn.</p>  
<p>At the last stage, those proceeding from tinkling bells, flute, v&#299;&#7751;&#257; (a musical instrument), and bees. Thus he hears many such sounds more and more subtle.</p>  
<p>When he comes to that stage when the sound of the great kettle-drum is being heard, he should try to distinguish only sounds more and more subtle.</p>  
<p>He may change his concentration from the gross sound to the subtle, or from the subtle to the gross, but he should not allow his mind to be diverted from them towards others.</p>  
<p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="green">p. 258</font></A></p>  
<p>The mind having at first concentrated itself on any one sound fixes firmly to that and is absorbed in it.</p>  
<p>It (the mind) becoming insensible to the external impressions, i becomes one with the sound as milk with water, and then becomes rapidly absorbed in chi&#7693;&#257;k&#257;&#347; (the ak&#257;&#347; where Chi&#7789; prevails).</p>  
<p>Being indifferent towards all objects, the yogin having controlled his passions, should by continual practice concentrate his attention upon the sound which destroys the mind.</p>  
<p>Having abandoned all thoughts and being freed from all actions, he should always concentrate his attention on the sound, and (then) his chi&#7789;&#7789;a becomes absorbed in it.</p>  
<p>Just as the bee drinking the honey (alone) does not care for the odour, so the chi&#7789;&#7789;a which is always absorbed in sound, does not long for sensual objects, as it is bound by the sweet smell of n&#257;&#7693;a and has abandoned its flitting nature.</p>  
<p>The serpent chi&#7789;&#7789;a through listening to the n&#257;&#7693;a is entirely absorbed in it, and becoming unconscious of everything concentrates itself on the sound.</p>  
<p>The sound serves the purpose of a sharp goad to control the maddened elephant&#8212;chi&#7789;&#7789;a which roves in the pleasure-garden of the sensual objects.</p>  
<p>It serves the purpose of a snare for binding the deer&#8212;chi&#7789;&#7789;a. It also serves the purpose of a shore to the ocean waves of chi&#7789;&#7789;a.</p>  
<p>The sound proceeding from Pra&#7751;ava which is Brahman is of the nature of effulgence; the mind becomes absorbed in it; that is the supreme seat of Vish&#7751;u.</p>  
<p>The sound exists till there is the &#257;k&#257;&#347;ic conception (&#257;k&#257;&#347;asa&#7749;kalpa). Beyond this, is the (a&#347;ab&#7693;a) soundless Parabrahman which is Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;.</p>  
<p>The mind exists so long as there is sound, but with its (sound's) cessation, there is the state called unman&#299; of manas (<i>viz</i>., the state of being above the mind).</p>  
<p>This sound is absorbed in the Akshara (indestructible) and the soundless state is the supreme seat.</p>  
<p>The mind which along with Pr&#257;&#7751;a (V&#257;yu) has (its) karmic affinities destroyed by the constant concentration upon n&#257;&#7693;a is absorbed in the unstained One. There is no doubt of it.</p>  
<p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="green">p. 259</font></A></p>  
<p>Many myriads of n&#257;&#7693;as and many more of bin&#7693;us&#8212;(all) become absorbed in the Brahma-Pra&#7751;ava sound.</p>  
<p>Being freed from all states and all thoughts whatever, the yogin remains like one dead. He is a muk&#7789;a. There is no doubt about this.</p>  
<p>After that, he does not at any time hear the sounds of conch or &#7693;un&#7693;ubhi (large kettle-drum).</p>  
<p>The body in the state of unman&#299; is certainly like a log and does not feel heat or cold, joy or sorrow.</p>  
<p>The yogin's chi&#7789;&#7789;a having given up fame or disgrace is in sam&#257;&#7693;hi above the three states.</p>  
<p>Being freed from the waking and the sleeping states, he attains to his true state.</p>  
<p>When the (spiritual) sight becomes fixed without any object to be seen, when the v&#257;yu (pr&#257;&#7751;a) becomes still without any effort, and when the chi&#7789;&#7789;a becomes firm without any support, he becomes of the form of the internal sound of Brahma-Pra&#7751;ava.</p>  
<p>Such is the Upanisha&#7693;.</p>
