<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>. &#346;&#257;&#7751;dilya questioned A&#7789;harvan thus: "Please tell me about the eight a&#7749;gas (parts) of Yoga which is the means of attaining to &#256;&#7789;m&#257;."</p>  
<p>A&#7789;harvan replied: "The eight a&#7749;gas of yoga are yama, niyama, &#257;sana, pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma, pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra, &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;, &#7693;hy&#257;na, and sam&#257;&#7693;hi. Of these, yama is of ten kinds: and so is niyama. There are eight &#257;sanas. Pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma is of three kinds; pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra is of five kinds: so also is &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;. &#7692;hy&#257;na is of two kinds, and sam&#257;&#7693;hi is of one kind only.</p>  
<p>"Under yama (forbearance) are ten:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> ahims&#257;, sa&#7789;ya, as&#7789;eya brahmacharya, &#7693;ay&#257;, &#257;rjava, ksham&#257;, &#7693;h&#7771;&#7789;i, mi&#7789;&#257;h&#257;ra, and &#347;aucha. Of these, ahims&#257; is the not causing of any pain to any living being at any time through the actions of one's mind, speech, or body. Sa&#7789;ya is the speaking of the truth that conduces to the well-being of creatures, through the actions of one's mind, speech, or body. As&#7789;eya is not coveting of another's property through the actions of one's mind, speech, or body. Brahmacharya is the refraining from sexual intercourse in all places and in all states in mind, speech or body. &#7692;ay&#257; is kindliness towards all creatures in all places. &#256;rjava is the preserving of equanimity of mind, speech, or body in the performance or non-performance of the actions ordained or forbidden to be done. Ksham&#257; is the bearing patiently of all pleasant or unpleasant things, such as praise or blow. Dh&#7771;&#7789;i is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></A></p>  
<p>the preserving of firmness of mind during the period of gain or loss of wealth or relatives. Mi&#7789;&#257;h&#257;ra is the taking of oily and sweet food, leaving one-fourth of the stomach empty. &#346;aucha is of two kinds, external and internal. Of these, the external is the cleansing of the body by earth and water; the internal is the cleansing of the mind. This (the latter) is to be obtained by means of the a&#7693;hy&#257;&#7789;ma-vi&#7693;y&#257; (science of Self).</p>  
<p>"Under niyama (religious observances), are ten, <i>viz</i>., &#7789;apas, san&#7789;osha, &#257;s&#7789;ikya, &#7693;&#257;na, &#298;&#347;varap&#363;jana, si&#7693;&#7693;h&#257;n&#7789;a-&#347;rava&#7751;a, hr&#299;&#7717;, ma&#7789;i, japa, and vra&#7789;a. Of these &#7789;apas, is the emancipation of the body through the observances of such penances as k&#7771;chchhra, ch&#257;n&#7693;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, etc., according to rules. San&#7789;osha is being satisfied with whatever comes to us of its own accord. &#256;s&#7789;ikya is the belief in the merits or demerits of actions as stated in the Ve&#7693;as. &#7692;&#257;na is the giving with faith to deserving persons, money, grains, etc., earned lawfully. &#298;&#347;varap&#363;jana is the worshipping of Vish&#7751;u, Ru&#7693;ra, etc., with pure mind according to one's power. Si&#7693;&#7693;h&#257;n&#7789;a-&#347;rava&#7751;a is the inquiry into the significance of Ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;a. Hr&#299;&#7717; is the shame felt in the performance of things contrary to the rules of the Ve&#7693;as and of society. Ma&#7789;i is the faith in the paths laid down by the Ve&#7693;as. Japa is the practising of the man&#7789;ras into which one is duly initiated by his spiritual instructor, and which is not against (the rules of) the Ve&#7693;as. It is of two kinds&#8212;the spoken and the mental. The mental is associated with contemplation by the mind. The spoken is of two kinds&#8212;the loud and the low. The loud pronunciation gives the reward as stated (in the Ve&#7693;as): (while) the low one (gives) a reward thousand times (that). The mental (gives) a reward a crore (of times that). Vra&#7789;a is the regular observance of or the refraining from the actions enjoined or prohibited by the Ve&#7693;as.</p>  
<p>"&#256;sanas (the postures) are (chiefly) eight, <i>viz</i>., svas&#7789;ika, gomukha, pa&#7693;ma, v&#299;ra, simha, bha&#7693;ra, muk&#7789;a, and may&#363;ra.</p>  
<p>"Svas&#7789;ika is the sitting at ease with the body erect, placing each foot between the thighs and knees of the other. Gomukha is (the sitting at ease with the body erect,) placing the hollow</p>  
<p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></A></p>  
<p>of the left foot under the side of the right posteriors and the hollow of the right foot under the side of the left posteriors, resembling Gomukha (cow's face). Pa&#7693;ma is (the sitting at ease with the body erect) placing the back of each foot in the thigh of the other, the right hand grasping the right toe and the left hand the left toe. This, O &#346;&#257;&#7751;dilya, is praised by all. V&#299;ra is the sitting at ease (with the body erect), placing one foot (on the thigh of the other and the other foot underneath the corresponding (opposite thigh.) Simha is (the sitting at ease with the body erect,) pressing the right side (of the thigh) with the hollow of left heel and <i>vice versa</i>. Rest your hands on the knees, spread out the fingers, open your mouth and carefully fix your gaze on the tip of your nose. This is always praised by the yogins. Si&#7693;&#7693;ha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is (the sitting at ease with the body erect), pressing the perineum with the left heel and placing the heel of the right foot above the genital organ, concentrating the mind between the two eyebrows. Bha&#7693;ra is (the sitting at ease with the body erect,)pressing the two ankles of the two feet firmly together against the S&#299;vin&#299; (<i>viz</i>., lower part of the seed) and binding the knees firmly with the hands. This is the bha&#7693;ra which destroys all diseases and poisons. Muk&#7789;a is (the sitting at ease with the body erect,) pressing with the left heel the right side of the tender part of the S&#299;vin&#299;, and with the right heel the left side of the tender part of the S&#299;vin&#299;. May&#363;ra&#8212;(lit., peacock). Rest your body upon the ground with both palms and place your elbows on the sides of the navel, lift up the head and feet and remain like a stick in the air, (like the plant balance in gymnastics). This is the may&#363;ra posture which destroys all sins. By these, all the diseases within the body are destroyed; all the poisons are digested. Let the person who is unable to practise all these postures betake himself to any one (of these) which he may find easy and pleasant. He who conquers (or gets mastery over) the postures&#8212;he conquers the three worlds. A person who has the practice of yama and niyama should practise pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma; by that the n&#257;dis become purified."</p>  
<p>Then &#346;&#257;&#7751;dilya questioned A&#7789;harvan thus: "By what means are the n&#257;dis purified? How many are they in number?</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> How do they arise? What v&#257;yus (vital airs) are located in them? What are their seats? What are their functions? Whatever is worthy of being known in the body, please tell me." To that A&#7789;harvan replied (thus): "This body is ninety-six digits in length. Pr&#257;&#7751;a extends twelve digits beyond the body. He who through the practice of yoga reduces his pr&#257;&#7751;a within his body to make it equal to or not less than the fire in it becomes the greatest of the yogins. In men, the region of fire which is triangular in form and brilliant as the molten gold is situated in the middle of the body. In four-footed animals, it (fire) is quadrangular. In birds, it is round. In its (the region of fire's) centre, the purifying, beneficial, and subtle flame is situate. Two digits above the anus and two digits below the sexual organ is the centre of the body for men. For four-footed animals, it is the middle of the heart. For birds, it is the middle of the body. Nine digits from (or above) the centre of the body and four digits in length and breadth is situated an oval form. In its midst is the navel. In it, is situated the chakra (<i>viz</i>., wheel) with twelve spokes. In the middle of the chakra, the j&#299;va (&#256;&#7789;m&#257;) wanders, driven by its good and bad deeds. As a spider flies to and fro within a web of fine threads, so pr&#257;&#7751;a moves about here. In this body, the j&#299;va rides upon pr&#257;&#7751;a. Lying in the middle of the navel and above it, is the seat of kun&#7693;alin&#299;. The kun&#7693;alin&#299; &#347;ak&#7789;i is of the form of eight prak&#7771;&#7789;is (matter) and coils itself eight ways or (times). The movement of v&#257;yus (vital airs) checks duly the food and drink all round by the side of skan&#7693;ha.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> It closes by its head (the opening of) the brahmaran&#7693;hra, and during the time of (the practice of) yoga is awakened by the fire (in the ap&#257;na); then it shines with great brilliancy in the &#257;k&#257;&#347; of the heart in the shape of wisdom. Depending upon kun&#7693;alin&#299; which is situated in the centre, there are fourteen principal n&#257;dis (<i>viz</i>.,) Id&#257;, Pi&#7749;gal&#257;, Sushumn&#257;, Sarasva&#7789;&#299;, V&#257;ru&#7751;&#299;, P&#363;sh&#257;, Has&#7789;ijihv&#257;, Ya&#347;asvin&#299;, Vi&#347;vo&#7693;har&#299;, Kuh&#363;&#7717;, &#346;&#257;&#7749;khin&#299;, Payasvin&#299;, Alambus&#257;, and G&#257;n&#7693;h&#257;r&#299;. Of them, Sushumn&#257; is said to be the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="green">p. 177</font></A></p>  
<p>sustainer of the universe and the path of salvation. Situated at the back of the anus, it is attached to the spinal column and extends to the brahmaran&#7693;hra of the head and is invisible and subtle and is vaish&#7751;av&#299; (or has the &#347;ak&#7789;i force of Vish&#7751;u). On the left of Sushumn&#257; is situated Id&#257;, and on the right is Pi&#7749;gal&#257;. The moon moves in Id&#257; and the sun in Pi&#7749;gal&#257;. The moon is of the nature of &#7789;amas and the sun of rajas. The poison share is of the sun and the nectar of the moon. They both direct (or indicate) time and Sushumn&#257; is the enjoyer (or consumer) of time. To the back and on the side of Sushumn&#257; are situate Sarasva&#7789;&#299; and Kuh&#363;&#7717; respectively. Between Ya&#347;asvin&#299; and Kuh&#363;&#7717; stands V&#257;ru&#7751;&#299;. Between Pasha and Sarasva&#7789;&#299; lies Payasvin&#299;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Between G&#257;n&#7693;h&#257;r&#299; and Sarasva&#7789;&#299; is situated Ya&#347;asvin&#299;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> In the centre of the navel is Alambus&#257;. In front of Sushumn&#257; there is Kuh&#363;&#7717;, which proceeds as far as the genital organ. Above and below kun&#7693;alin&#299; is situated V&#257;ru&#7751;&#299;, which proceeds everywhere. Ya&#347;asvin&#299; which is beautiful (or belonging to the moon), proceeds to the great toes. Pi&#7749;gal&#257; goes upwards to the right nostril. Payasvin&#299; goes to right ear. Sarasva&#7789;&#299; goes to the upper part or the tongue and &#346;&#257;&#7749;khin&#299; to the left ear, (while) G&#257;n&#7693;h&#257;r&#299; goes from the back of Id&#257; to the left eye. Alambus&#257; goes upwards and downwards from the root of the anus. From these fourteen n&#257;dis, other (minor) n&#257;dis spring; from them springing others, and from them springing others; so it should be known. As the leaf of the a&#347;va&#7789;&#7789;ha tree (<i>ficus religiosa</i>) etc., is covered with minute fibres so also is this body permeated with n&#257;dis.</p>  
<p>"Pr&#257;&#7751;a, Ap&#257;na, Sam&#257;na, U&#7693;&#257;na, Vy&#257;na, Naga, Karma, K&#7771;kara, Deva&#7693;a&#7789;&#7789;a, and &#7692;hana&ntilde;jaya&#8212;these ten v&#257;yus (vital airs) move in all the n&#257;dis. Pr&#257;&#7751;a moves in the nostrils, the throat, the navel, the two great toes and the lower and the upper parts of kun&#7693;alin&#299;. Vy&#257;na moves in the ear, the eye, the loins, the ankles, the nose, the throat and the buttocks. Ap&#257;na moves in the anus, the genitals, the thighs, the knees. the stomach, the seeds, the loins, the calves, the navel, and the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="green">p. 178</font></A></p>  
<p>seat of the anus of fire. U&#7693;&#257;na lives in all the joints and also in the hands and legs. Sam&#257;na lives, permeating in all parts of the body. Along with the fire in the body, it causes the food and drink taken in, to spread in the body. It moves in the seventy-two thousand n&#257;dis and pervades all over the body along with the fire. The five v&#257;yus beginning with Naga go towards the skin, the bones, etc. The Pr&#257;&#7751;a which is in the navel separates the food and drink which is there and brings about the rasas (juices) and others.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Placing the water above the fire and the food above (or in) the water, it goes to the Ap&#257;na and along with it, fans up the fire in the centre of the body. The fire thus fanned up by the Ap&#257;na gradually increases in brightness in the middle of the body. Then it causes through its flames the water which is brought in the bowels by the Pr&#257;&#7751;a to grow hot. The fire with the water causes the food and condiments, which are placed above, to be boiled to a proper degree. Then Pr&#257;&#7751;a separates these into sweat, urine, water, blood, semen, the f&aelig;ces and the like. And along with the Samaria, it takes the juice (or essence) to all the n&#257;dis and moves in the body in the shape of breath. The v&#257;yus excrete the urine, the f&aelig;ces, etc., through the nine openings in the body which are connected with the outside air. The functions of Pr&#257;&#7751;a are inspiration, expiration, and cough. Those of Ap&#257;na are the excretion of the f&aelig;ces and the urine. Those of Vy&#257;na are (such actions as) giving and taking. Those of U&#7693;&#257;na are keeping the body straight, etc. Those of Sam&#257;na are nourishing the body. Those of N&#257;ga are vomiting, etc.; of K&#363;rma, the movement of the eyelids; of K&#7771;kara, the causing of hunger, etc., of &#7692;eva&#7693;a&#7789;&#7789;a, idleness, etc., and &#7692;hana&ntilde;jaya, phlegm.</p>  
<p>"Having thus acquired a thorough knowledge of the seat of the n&#257;dis and of the v&#257;yus with their functions, one should begin with the purification of the n&#257;dis. A person possessed of yama and niyama, avoiding all company, having finished his course of study, delighting in truth and virtue, having conquered (his) anger, being engaged in the service of his spiritual instructor and having been obedient to his parents</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="green">p. 179</font></A></p>  
<p>and well instructed in all the religious practices and the knowledge of his order of life, should go to a sacred grove abounding in fruits, roots, and water. There he should select a pleasant spot always resounding with the chanting of the Ve&#7693;as, frequented by the knowers of Brahman that persevere in the duties of their orders of life and filled with fruits, roots, flowers, and water. (Else) either in a temple or on the banks of a river or in a village or in a town, he should build a beautiful monastery. It should be neither too long nor too high, should have a small door, should be besmeared well with cow-dung and should have every sort of protection.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> There listening to the exposition of ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;a, he should begin to practise yoga, In the beginning having worshipped Vin&#257;yaka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (Ga&#7751;e&#347;a), he should salute his Ishta-&#7692;eva&#7789;&#257; (tutelary deity) and sitting in any of the above-mentioned postures on a soft seat, facing either the east or the north and having conquered them, the learned man keeping his head and neck erect and fixing his gaze on the tip of his nose, should see the sphere of the moon between his eyebrows and drink the nectar (flowing therefrom through his eyes. Inhaling the air through Id&#257;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> for the space of twelve m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> he should contemplate on the sphere of fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> situated in the belly as surrounded with flames and having as its seed &#2352; (ra); then he should exhale it through Pi&#7749;gal&#257;. Again inhaling it through Pi&#7749;gal&#257;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and retaining it (within), he should exhale it through Id&#257;. For the period of twenty-eight months,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> he should practise six times at every sitting through the three san&#7693;hy&#257;s (morning, noon, and evening)</p>

<p>and during the intervals. By this, the n&#257;dis become purified. Then the body becomes light and bright, the (gastric) fire is increased (within) and there is the manifestation of n&#257;&#7693;a (internal sound).</p>  
<p>"Pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma is said to be the union of Pr&#257;&#7751;a and Ap&#257;na. It is of three kinds&#8212;expiration, inspiration, and cessation. They are associated with the letters of the (Samsk&#7771;&#7789;) alphabet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (for the right performance of pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma). Therefore Pra&#7751;ava (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>) only is said to be Pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma. Sitting in the pa&#7693;ma posture, the person should meditate that there is at the tip of his nose G&#257;ya&#7789;r&#299;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> a girl of red complexion surrounded by the numberless rays of the image of the moon and mounted on a hamsa (swan) and having a mace in her hand. She is the visible symbol of the letter A. The letter U has as its visible symbol S&#257;vi&#7789;r&#299;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> a young woman of white colour having a disk in her hand and riding on a garuda (eagle). The letter M has as its visible symbol Sarasva&#7789;&#299;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> an aged woman of black colour riding on a bull, having a trident in her hand. He should meditate that the single letter&#8212;the supreme light&#8212;the pra&#7751;ava (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>)&#8212;is the origin or source of these three letters A, U, and M. Drawing up the air through Id&#257; for the space of sixteen m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s, he should meditate on the letter A during that time; retaining the inspired air for the space of sixty-four m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s, he should meditate on the letter U during the time; he should then exhale the inspired air for the space of thirty-two m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s, meditating on the letter M during that time. He should practise this in the above order over and over again.</p>  
<p>"Then having become firm in the posture and preserved perfect self-control, the yogin should, in order to clear away the impurities of the Sushumn&#257;, sit in the pa&#7693;m&#257;sana (pa&#7693;ma posture), and having inhaled the air through the left nostril, should retain it as long as he can and should exhale it through the right. Then drawing it again through the right and having retained it, he should exhale it through the left in the order</p>

<p>that he should draw it through the same nostril by which he exhaled it before and retained it. In this context, occur (to memory) the following verses: "In the beginning having inhaled the breath (Pr&#257;&#7751;a) through the left nostril, according to the rule, he should exhale it through the other; then having inhaled the air through the right nostril, should retain it and exhale it through the other." To those who practise according to these rules through the right and left nostrils, the n&#257;dis become purified within three months. He should practise cessation of breath at sunrise, in the midday, at sunset and at midnight slowly till eighty (times a day) for four weeks. In the early stages, perspiration is produced; in the middle stage the tremor of the body, and in the last stage levitation in the air. These (results) ensue out of the repression of the breath, while sitting in the pa&#7693;ma posture. When perspiration arises with effort, he should rub his body well. By this, the body becomes firm and light. In the early course of his practice, food with milk and ghee is excellent. One sticking to this rule becomes firm in his practice and gets no &#7789;&#257;pa (or burning sensation in the body). As lions, elephants and tigers are gradually tamed, so also the breath, when rightly managed (comes under control); else it kills the practitioner.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"He should (as far as is consistent with his health and safety) properly exhale it, properly inhale it or retain it properly. Thus (only) will he attain success. By thus retaining the breath in an approved manner and by the purification of the n&#257;dis, the brightening of the (gastric) fire, the hearing distinctly of (spiritual) sounds and (good) health result. When the nervous centres have become purified through the regular practice of Pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma, the air easily forces its way up through the mouth of the Sushumn&#257; which is in the middle. By the contraction of the muscles of the neck and by the contraction of the one below (<i>viz</i>.,) Ap&#257;na, the Pr&#257;&#7751;a (breath) goes into the Sushumn&#257; which is in the middle from the west n&#257;di.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Drawing</p>

<p>up the Ap&#257;na and forcing down the Pr&#257;&#7751;a from the throat, the yogin free from old age becomes a youth of sixteen.</p>  
<p>"Seated in a pleasant posture and drawing up the air through the right nostril and retaining it inside from the top of the hair to the toe nails, he should exhale it through the same nostril. Through it, the brain becomes purified and the diseases in the air n&#257;dis are destroyed. Drawing up the air through the nostrils with noise (so as to fill the space) from the heart to the neck, and having retained it (within) as long as possible, he should exhale it through the nose. Through this, hunger, thirst, idleness and sleep do not arise.</p>  
<p>"Taking in the air through the mouth (wide open) and having retained it as long as possible, he should expel it through the nose. Through this, (such diseases as) gulma, pleeha (both being splenetic diseases), bile and fever as also hunger, etc., are destroyed.</p>  
<p>"Now we shall proceed to kumbhaka (restraint of breath). It is of two kinds&#8212;sahi&#7789;a and kevala. That which is coupled with expiration and inspiration is called sahi&#7789;a. That which is devoid of these is called kevala (alone). Until you become perfect in kevala, practise sahi&#7789;a. To one who has mastered kevala, there is nothing unattainable in the three worlds. By kevala-restraint of breath, the knowledge of kun&#7693;alin&#299; arises. Then he becomes lean in body, serene in face and clear-eyed, hears the (spiritual) sounds distinctly, becomes free from all diseases and conquers his (bin&#7693;u) seminal fluid,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> his gastric fire being increased.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> &#7789;&#257;n&#7789;ric works. With his mind and breath absorbed in an internal object, the yogin, though he does not really see the objects outside and under him, still (appears to) see them with eyes in which the pupils are motionless. This is called Khechar&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257;. It has as its sphere of extension one object and is very beneficial. (Then) the real seat of Vish&#7751;u, which is void and non-void, dawns on him. With eyes half closed and with a firm mind, fixing his eyes on the tip of his nose and becoming absorbed in the sun and moon, he after remaining thus unshaken (becomes conscious of) the thing which is of the form of light, which is free from all externals, which is resplendent, which is the supreme truth and which is beyond. O &#346;&#257;&#7751;dilya, know this to be &#7788;a&#7789; (That). Merging the sound in the light and elevating the brows a little, this is of the way of (or is a part of) the former practice. This brings about the state of Unmani which causes the destruction of the mind. Therefore he should practise the Khechar&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257;. Then he attains to the state of Unman&#299; and falls into the yoga sleep (trance). To one who obtains this yoga sleep, time does not exist. Placing the mind in the midst of &#347;ak&#7789;i and &#347;ak&#7789;i&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the midst of the mind and looking on the mind with the mind, O &#346;&#257;ndilya be happy. Place the &#256;&#7789;ma in the midst of &#257;k&#257;&#347; and &#257;k&#257;&#347; in the midst of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, and having reduced everything to &#257;k&#257;&#347;, do not think of anything else. You should not (then) entertain thoughts, either external or internal. Abandoning all thoughts, become abstract thought itself. As camphor in fire and salt in water become absorbed, so also the mind becomes absorbed in the &#7788;a&#7789;&#7789;va (Truth). What is termed manas (mind) is the knowledge of everything that is known and its clear apprehension. When the knowledge and the object cognised are lost alike, there is no second path (or that is the only path). By its giving up all cognition of objects, it (the mind) is absorbed and when the mind is absorbed, kaivalya (isolation) alone remains.</p>  
<p>"For the destruction of the chi&#7789;&#7789;a, there are two ways&#8212;yoga and j&ntilde;&#257;na. O prince of sages! yoga is the (forcible)</p>

<p><a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="green">p. 184</font></A></p>  
<p>repression of the modifications of the mind, and j&ntilde;&#257;na is the thorough inquiry into them. When the modifications of the mind are repressed, it (the mind) verily obtains peace. Just as the actions of the people cease with the stopping of the fluctuations of the sun (<i>viz</i>., with sunset), so when the fluctuations of the mind cease, this cycle of births and deaths comes to an end. (Then) the fluctuations of pr&#257;&#7751;a are prevented, when one has no longing for this mundane existence or when he has gratified his desires therein&#8212;through the study of religious books, the company of good men, indifference (to enjoyments), practice and yoga or long contemplation with intentness on any desired (higher) object or through practising one truth firmly.</p>  
<p>"By the repression of the breath through inhalation, etc., by continual practice therein which does not cause fatigue, and by meditating in a secluded place, the fluctuations of the mind are arrested. Through the right realisation of the true nature of the sound which is at the extreme end of the pronunciation of the syllable <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span> (<i>viz</i>., Ar&#7693;ham&#257;&#7789;r&#257;), and when sushup&#7789;i (dreamless sleeping state) is rightly cognised through consciousness, the fluctuations of pr&#257;&#7751;a are repressed. When the passage at the root of the palate which is like the bell, <i>viz</i>., uvula, is closed by the tongue with effort and when the breath goes up through (the upper hole), then the fluctuations of pr&#257;&#7751;a are stopped. When the consciousness (samvi&#7789;) is merged in pr&#257;&#7751;a, and when through practice the pr&#257;&#7751;a goes through the upper hole into the &#7693;v&#257;&#7693;as&#257;n&#7789;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (the twelfth centre) above the palate, then the fluctuations of pr&#257;&#7751;a are stopped. When the eye of consciousness (<i>viz</i>., the spiritual or third eye) becomes calm and clear so as to be able to distinctly see in the transparent &#257;k&#257;&#347; at a distance of twelve digits from the tip of his nose, then the fluctuations of pr&#257;&#7751;a are stopped. When the thoughts arising in the mind are bound up in the calm contemplation of the world of &#7789;&#257;raka (star or eye) between one's eyebrows and are (thus) destroyed, then the fluctuations cease. When the <A HREF="errata.htm#12">knowledge</A> which is of the form of the knowable,</p>

<p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="green">p. 185</font></A></p>  
<p>which is beneficent and which is untouched by any modifications arises in one and is known as OM only and no other, then the fluctuations of pr&#257;&#7751;a cease. By the contemplation for a long time of the &#257;k&#257;&#347; which is in the heart, and by the contemplation of the mind free from v&#257;s&#257;n&#257;s, then the fluctuations of pr&#257;&#7751;a cease. By these methods and various others suggested by (one's) thought and by means of the contact of the many (spiritual) guides, the fluctuations cease.</p>  
<p>"Having by contraction opened the door of kun&#7693;alin&#299;, one should force open the door of moksha. Closing with her mouth the door through which one ought to go, the ku&#7751;dalin&#299; sleeps spiral in form and coiled up like a serpent. He who causes this kun&#7693;alin&#299; to move&#8212;he is an emancipated person. If this kun&#7693;alin&#299; were to sleep in the upper part of the neck of any yogin, it goes towards his emancipation. (If it were to sleep) in the lower part (of the body), it is for the bondage of the ignorant. Leaving the two n&#257;dis, Id&#257; and the other (Pi&#7749;gal&#257;), it (pr&#257;&#7751;a) should move in the Sushumn&#257;. That is the supreme seat of Vish&#7751;u. One should practise control of breath with the concentration of the mind. The mind should not be allowed by a clever man to rest on any other thing. One should not worship Vish&#7751;u during the day alone. One should not worship Vish&#7751;u during the night alone; but should always worship Him, and should not worship Him merely during day and night. The wisdom-producing opening (near uvula) has five passages. O &#346;&#257;&#7751;dilya this is the khechar&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257;; practise it. With one who sits in the khechar&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257;, the v&#257;yu which was flowing before through the left and right n&#257;dis now flows through the middle one (Sushumn&#257;). There is no doubt about it. You should swallow the air through the void (Sushumn&#257;) between Id&#257; and Pi&#7749;gal&#257;. In that place is khechar&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257; situated, and that is the seat of Truth. Again that is khechar&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257; which is situated in the &#257;k&#257;&#347;a-chakra (in the head) in the nir&#257;lamba (supportless) seat between the sun and moon (<i>viz</i>., Id&#257; and Pi&#7749;gal&#257;). When the tongue has been lengthened to the length of a kal&#257; (digit) by the incision (of the fr&aelig;num lingum) and by rubbing and milking it (<i>viz</i>., the tongue), fix the gaze between the two eyebrows and close the hole in the skull with</p>  
<p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="green">p. 186</font></A></p>  
<p>the tongue reversed. This is khechar&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257;. When the tongue and the chi&#7789;&#7789;a (mind) both move in the &#257;k&#257;&#347; (khechar&#299;), then the person with his tongue raised up becomes immortal. Firmly pressing the yoni (perineum) by the left heel, stretching out the right leg, grasping the feet with both hands and inhaling the air through the nostrils, practise ka&#7751;tha-ban&#7693;ha,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> retaining the air upwards. By that, all afflictions are destroyed; then poison is digested as if it were nectar. Asthma, splenetic disease, the turning up of the anus and the numbness of the skin are removed. This is the means of conquering pr&#257;&#7751;a and destroying death. Pressing the yoni by the left heel, place the other foot over the left thigh: inhale the air, rest the chin on the chest, contract the yoni and contemplate, (as far as possible), your &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as situated within your mind. Thus is the direct perception (of truth) attained.</p>  
<p>"Inhaling the pr&#257;&#7751;a from outside and filling the stomach with it, centre the pr&#257;&#7751;a with the mind in the middle of the navel, at the tip of the nose and at the toes during the san&#7693;hy&#257;s (sunset and sunrise) or at all times. (Thus) the yogin is freed from all diseases and fatigue. By centring his pr&#257;&#7751;a at the tip of his nose, he obtains mastery over the element of air; by centring it at the middle of his navel, all diseases are destroyed; by centring it at the toes, his body becomes light. He who drinks the air (drawn) through the tongue destroys fatigue, thirst and diseases. He who drinks the air with his mouth during the two san&#7693;hy&#257;s and the last two hours of the night, within three months the auspicious Sarasva&#7789;&#299; (goddess of speech) is present in his v&#257;k (speech) <i>viz</i>., (he becomes eloquent and learned in his speech). In six months, he is free from all diseases. Drawing the air by the tongue, retain the air at the root of the tongue. The wise man thus drinking nectar enjoys all prosperity. Fixing the &#256;&#7789;m&#257; in the &#256;&#7789;m&#257; itself in the middle of the eyebrows, (having inhaled) through Id&#257; and breaking through that (centre) thirty times, even a sick man is freed from disease. He who draws the air through the n&#257;dis and retains it for twenty-four minutes in the navel and in</p>

<p>the sides of the stomach becomes freed from disease. He who for the space of a month during the three san&#7693;hy&#257;s (sunset, sunrise, and midnight or noon) draws the air through the tongue, pierces thirty times and retains his breath in the middle of his navel, becomes freed from all fevers and poisons. He who retains the pr&#257;&#7751;a together with the mind at the tip of his nose even for the space of a muh&#363;r&#7789;a (forty-eight minutes), destroys all sins that were committed by him during one hundred births.</p>

<p>animal is produced. By centring it on the sa&ntilde;chi&#7789;a-karma (past karma yet to be enjoyed), a knowledge of one's previous births arises in him. By centring it on the mind of another, a knowledge of the mind (or thoughts) of others is induced. By centring it on the k&#257;ya-r&#363;pa (or form of the body), other forms are seen. By fixing it on the bala (strength), the strength of persons like Han&#363;m&#257;n is obtained. By fixing it on the sun, a knowledge of the worlds arises. By fixing it on the moon, a knowledge of the constellation is produced. By fixing it on the &#7692;hruva (Polar star) a perception of its motion is induced. By fixing it on his own (Self), one acquires the knowledge of Purusha; on the navel, he attains a knowledge of the k&#257;ya-vy&#363;ha (mystical arrangement of all the particles of the body so as to enable a person to wear out his whole karma in one life): on the well of the throat, freedom from hunger and thirst arises: on the K&#363;rma n&#257;di (which is situated in the well of the throat), a firmness (of concentration) takes place. By fixing it on the t&#257;r&#257; (pupil of the eye), he obtains the sight of the si&#7693;&#7693;has (spiritual personages). By conquering the &#257;k&#257;&#347; in the body, he is able to soar in the &#257;k&#257;&#347;: (in short) by centring the mind in any place, he conquers the si&#7693;&#7693;his appertaining to that place.</p>  
<p>"Then comes pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra, which is of five kinds. It is the drawing away of the organs from attaching themselves to the objects of senses. Contemplating upon everything that one sees as &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra. Renouncing the fruits of one's daily actions is pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra. Turning away from all objects of sense is pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra. &#7692;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257; in the eighteen important places (mentioned below) is pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra, (<i>viz</i>.,) the feet, the toes, the ankles, the calves, the knees, the thighs, the anus, the penis, the navel, the heart, the well of the throat, the palate, the nose, the eyes, the middle of the brows, the forehead, and the head in ascending and descending orders.</p>  
<p>"Then (comes) &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;.

<p>"Then comes &#7693;hy&#257;na. It is of two kinds, sagu&#7751;a (with gu&#7751;as or quality) and nirgu&#7751;a (without quality). Sagu&#7751;a is the meditation of a m&#363;r&#7789;i. Nirgu&#7751;a is on the reality of Self.</p>  
<p>"Sam&#257;&#7693;hi is the union of the J&#299;v&#257;&#7789;m&#257; (individual self) and the Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; (higher self) without the threefold state, (<i>viz</i>., the knower, the known, and the knowledge). It is of the nature of extreme bliss and pure consciousness.</p>

<p>Then the B&#7771;ahmarshi &#346;&#257;&#7751;dilya not obtaining the knowledge of Brahman in the four Ve&#7693;as, approached the Lord A&#7789;harvan and asked him: "What is it? Teach me the science of Brahman by which I shall obtain that which is most excellent."</p>  
<p>A&#7789;harvan replied: "O &#346;&#257;&#7751;dilya, Brahman is sa&#7789;ya, vij&ntilde;&#257;na and anan&#7789;a in which all this (world) is interwoven, warp-wise and woof-wise, from which all originated and into which all are absorbed, and which being known makes everything else known. It is without hands and feet, without eyes and ears, without tongue or without body, and is unreachable and undefinable. From which, v&#257;k (speech) and mind return, being unable to obtain (or reach) It.

That is Brahman. Thou art That. Know That by wisdom. He who is the one, the shining, the giver of the power of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, the omniscient, the lord of all, and the inner soul of all beings, who lives in all beings, who is hidden in all beings and the source of all beings, who is reachable only through yoga and who creates, supports and destroys everything&#8212;He is &#256;&#7789;m&#257;.

<p>Then &#346;&#257;&#7751;dilya questioned A&#7789;harvan thus: "From the Brahman that is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>, imperishable, actionless, beneficial, sa&#7789; (be-ness) only and supreme, how did this universe arise? How does it exist in It? And how is it absorbed in It? Please solve me this doubt."</p>  
<p>A&#7789;harvan replied: The Supreme Brahman, the Truth, is the imperishable and the actionless. Then from the formless Brahman, three forms (or aspects) arose, (<i>viz</i>.,) nishkal&#257; (partless,) sakal&#257; (with parts), and sakal&#257;-nishkal&#257; (with and without parts). That which is sa&#7789;ya, vij&ntilde;&#257;na and &#257;nan&#7693;a, That which is actionless, without any impurity, omnipresent, extremely subtle, having faces in every direction, undefinable and immortal&#8212;that is His nishkal&#257; aspect. Mahe&#347;vara (the great Lord) who is black and yellow rules, with avi&#7693;y&#257;, m&#363;laprak&#7771;&#7789;i or m&#257;y&#257; that is red, white, and black, and that is co-existent with Him. This is his sakal&#257;-nishkal&#257; aspect. Then the Lord desired (or willed) by his spiritual wisdom (thus): May I become many?; may I bring forth? Then from this Person who was contemplating and whose desires are fulfilled, three letters sprang up. Three vy&#257;h&#7771;&#7789;is,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the three-footed G&#257;ya&#7789;r&#299;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the three Ve&#7693;as, the three &#7693;evas, the three var&#7751;as (colours or castes) and the three fires sprang. That Supreme Lord who is endowed with all kinds of wealth, who is all pervading, who is situated in the hearts of all beings, who is the Lord of m&#257;y&#257; and whose form is m&#257;y&#257;&#8212;He is Brahma. He is Vish&#7751;u: He is Ru&#7693;ra: He is In&#7693;ra: He is all the &#7693;evas: He is all the bh&#363;&#7789;as (elements or beings): He only is before: He only is behind: He only is on our left: He only is on our right: He only is below: He only is above: He only is the all. That form of him as &#7692;a&#7789;&#7789;&#257;&#7789;reya,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who sports with his &#346;ak&#7789;i, who is kind to his devotees, who is brilliant as fire, resembling the petals or a red lotus and is of four hands, who is mild and shines sinlessly&#8212;this is His sakal&#257; form."</p>

<p>Then &#346;&#257;&#7751;dilya questioned A&#7789;harvan, "O Lord, that which is Sa&#7789; only and the essence of the bliss of consciousness&#8212;why is He called Parabrahman?"</p>  
<p>A&#7789;harvan replied: "Because He increases <i>b&#7771;ha&#7789;i</i> and causes to increase everything (<i>b&#7771;han&#7789;i</i>); so he is called Parabrahman. Why is He called &#256;&#7789;m&#257;? Since He obtains (<i>&#257;pno&#7789;i</i>) everything, since He takes back everything and since He is everything, so he is called &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Why is He called Mahe&#347;vara (the great Lord)? Since by the sound of the words Maha&#7789;-&#298;&#347;a (the great Lord) and by His own power, the great Lord governs everything. Why is He called &#7692;a&#7789;&#7789;&#257;&#7789;reya? Because the Lord being extremely pleased with A&#7789;ri (&#7770;shi) who was performing a most difficult penance and who had expressed his desire to see Him who is light itself, offered Himself (&#7693;a&#7789;&#7789;a) as their son, and because the woman Anas&#363;y&#257; was his mother and A&#7789;ri was his father. Therefore he who knows the (secret) meaning knows everything. He who always contemplates on the supreme that It is himself becomes a knower of Brahman. Here these &#347;lokas (stanzas) occur (to memory). 'He who contemplates always the Lord of Lords and the ancient thus&#8212;as &#7692;a&#7789;&#7789;&#257;&#7789;reya, the beneficent, the calm, of the colour of sapphire, one who delights in his own m&#257;y&#257; and the Lord who has shaken off everything, as naked and as one whose whole body is besmeared with the holy ashes, who has matted hair, who is the Lord of all, who has four arms, who is bliss in appearance, whose eyes are like full-blown lotus, who is the store of j&ntilde;&#257;na and yoga, who is the spiritual instructor of all the worlds and who is dear to all the yogins, and one who is merciful towards His devotees, who is the witness of all and who is worshipped by all the si&#7693;&#7693;has is freed from all sins and will attain (the Spirit).'</p>
