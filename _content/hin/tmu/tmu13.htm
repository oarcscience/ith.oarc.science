<p>"There was neither Sa&#7789;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> nor asa&#7789; nor Sa&#7789;-asa&#7789;. From it, &#7789;amas (darkness) was evolved.

He entered Brahma himself and evolved mentally the seven sons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and these Havir&#257;ts (or sons) as well as the seven praj&#257;pa&#7789;is (progenitors).

The moon was born from His manas (mind), the sun from His eyes, v&#257;yu from (His) ears and pr&#257;&#7751;as from (His) heart. Thus all things were born."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kha&#7751;da</span> II</h5>  
<p>"From ap&#257;na came Nish&#257;&#7693;as, Yakshas, R&#257;kshasas, and Gan&#7693;harvas. From (His) bones, arose the mountains. From His hairs arose the herbs and the trees. From His forehead, Ru&#7693;ra was born through His anger. The breath of this great Being became the &#7770;gve&#7693;a, Yajurve&#7693;a, S&#257;mave&#7693;a, A&#7789;harvave&#7693;a, &#346;&#299;ksh&#257; (the science of the proper pronunciation and articulation of sounds), Kalpa (the science of methodology), Vy&#257;kara&#7751;a (grammar), Niruk&#7789;a (glossarial explanation of obsolete and other terms in Ve&#7693;as), Chhan&#7693;as (prosody or ve&#7693;ic metre), Jyo&#7789;isha (astronomy), Ny&#257;ya (logic), M&#299;m&#257;ms&#257; (including rituals and ve&#7693;&#257;n&#7789;a), Dharma&#347;&#257;s&#7789;ras, commentaries, glosses and all beings. This &#256;&#7789;m&#257; (or the Self of Purusha) is Hira&#7751;yajyo&#7789;is (or golden or effulgent Light) into which all the universe is absorbed. He divided &#256;&#7789;m&#257; (his Self) into two moieties; out of one moiety, the woman was created; and out of the other, man. Having become a &#7692;eva, He created the &#7692;evas. Having become a &#7770;shi, He created the &#7770;shis; also He created Yakshas, R&#257;kshasas, Gan&#7693;harvas, wild and domestic beasts and others such as cows, bulls, mares and horses, she-asses and asses and Vi&#347;vambhara (the Supporter) and Vi&#347;vambhar&#257; (the earth). Becoming Vai&#347;v&#257;nara (fire) at the end (of creation), He burnt up all objects. Then (in dissolution), p&#7771;&#7789;hiv&#299; was absorbed in &#257;pas, &#257;pas in agni, agni in v&#257;yu, v&#257;yu in &#257;ka&#347;, &#257;ka&#347; in in&#7693;riyas (organs),</p>

<p>in&#7693;riyas into &#7789;anm&#257;&#7789;ras (rudimentary properties), &#7789;anm&#257;&#7789;ras into bh&#363;&#7789;&#257;&#7693;i, bh&#363;&#7789;&#257;&#7693;i into maha&#7789;, maha&#7789; into avyak&#7789;a, avyak&#7789;a into akshara (the indestructible), akshara into Lamas (darkness). And Lamas becomes one with the supreme Lord. And then there is neither Sa&#7789; nor asa&#7789;, nor Sa&#7789;-asa&#7789;. This is the teaching of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a and this is the teaching of the Ve&#7693;as. Yea, This is the teaching of the Ve&#7693;as."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kha&#7751;da</span> III</h5>  
<p>"At first, there was Asa&#7789;, unborn, non-existent, unsupported, soundless, touchless, formless, tasteless, odourless, and decayless. The undaunted man never grieves, as he knows &#256;&#7789;m&#257; to be great, all-pervading and unborn. It (&#256;&#7789;ma) is pr&#257;&#7751;aless, mouthless, earless, tongueless, manas-less, &#7789;ejas-less, eyeless, nameless, go&#7789;raless (or clanless), headless, handless, feetless, non-unctuous, bloodless, non-measurable, neither long nor short, neither gross nor atomic, neither great nor small, endless, indescribable, nonreturnable, non-luminous, not hidden, having neither inside nor outside, neither eating anything nor being eaten by others. Some one (out of many) attains to this (&#256;&#7789;m&#257;) by the six means of sa&#7789;ya (truth), &#7693;&#257;na (charity), &#7789;apas (religious austerities), non-injury to any creature, celibacy and complete indifference to worldy objects;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and there are no other means. Whoever feels happy with the thought 'I know That', that learned person's pr&#257;&#7751;a will never get out of his body at the moment of death, but will become absorbed in Brahman; and being absorbed in Brahman, he attains the state of Brahman Itself as he who knows this."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kha&#7751;da</span> IV</h5>  
<p>"In the middle of the heart is a red fleshy mass in which is the &#7693;ahara-lotus. Like the lotus, it opens into many (petals). There are ten openings in the heart. The (different kinds of) pr&#257;&#7751;as are located there. Whenever he (&#256;&#7789;m&#257;) is united with</p>

<p>pr&#257;&#7751;a, he sees cities with rivers and other variegated things; when united with vy&#257;na, he sees &#7692;evas and &#7770;shis; when united with ap&#257;na, he sees Yakshas, R&#257;kshasas and Gan&#7693;harvas; when united with ud&#257;na, he perceives the celestial world, &#7692;evas, Skan&#7693;a (K&#257;r&#7789;ikeya or the six-faced Mars), and Jayan&#7789;a (In&#7693;ra's son); when united with sam&#257;na, he sees the celestial world and the treasures (of Kubera); when united with rambh&#257; (a n&#257;di hereafter given out), he sees whatever is seen or not seen, heard or not heard, eaten or not eaten, asa&#7789; or Sa&#7789; and all else.</p>  
<p>"There are ten midis; in each of these are seventy-one. And these become 72,000 branch n&#257;dis. When &#256;&#7789;m&#257; sleeps therein, it produces sound; but when &#256;&#7789;m&#257; sleeps in the second ko&#347;a (or sheath) then it sees this world and the higher as also knows all the sounds. This is spoken of as sampras&#257;&#7693;a (deep sleep rest). Then pr&#257;&#7751;a protects the body. The n&#257;dis are full of blood, of the colours green, blue, yellow, red, and white. Now this &#7693;ahara-lotus has many petals like a lily. Like a hair divided into 1,000 parts, the n&#257;dis called hi&#7789;a are. The divine &#256;&#7789;m&#257; sleeps in the &#257;k&#257;&#347; of the heart, in the supreme ko&#347;a (or &#257;nan&#7693;amaya sheath); sleeping there, it has no desires, no dreams, no &#7693;eva-worlds, no yaj&ntilde;as or sacrificer, no mother or father, no relative, no kinsman, no thief, or no Brahman-slayer. Its body is &#7789;ejas (resplendent effulgence) and of the nature of nectar (or the immortal). It is as if in sport, a water-lotus. When he returns again to the waking state by the same way (he quitted or went in before to the heart), he is Samr&#257;t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

<p>"That which joins one place (or centre) with another is the n&#257;dis which bind them. The eye is a&#7693;hy&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, (pertaining to the body); the visible objects are &#257;&#7693;hibh&#363;&#7789;a (pertaining to the</p>

<p>"The wise man should conduct himself like a lad, with the nature of a child, without company, blameless, silent and wise and without exercising any authority. This description of Kaivalya is stated by Praj&#257;pa&#7789;i. Having found with certitude the supreme seat, one should dwell under a tree with torn cloths, unaccompanied, single and engaged in sam&#257;&#7693;hi. He should be longing after the attaining of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and having attained this object, he is desireless, his desires have decayed. He fears none, though he finds the cause of death in such as elephants, lions, gadflies, musquitoes, ichneuma, serpents, Yakshas, R&#257;kshasas, and Gan&#7693;harvas. He will stand like a tree. Though cut down, he will neither get angry nor tremble. He will stand (or remain) like a lotus. Though pierced, he will neither get angry nor tremble. He will stand like &#257;k&#257;&#347;; though struck, he will neither get angry nor tremble. He will stand by Sa&#7789;ya (truth), since &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is Sa&#7789;ya.</p>  
<p>"P&#7771;&#7789;hiv&#299; is the heart (or centre) of all odours; &#257;pas is the heart of all tastes; &#7789;ejas is the heart of all forms; v&#257;yu is the heart of all touch; &#257;k&#257;&#347; is the heart of all sounds; avyak&#7789;a is the heart of g&#299;&#7789;&#257;s (or sounds); m&#7771;&#7789;yu is the heart of all Sa&#7789;&#7789;vas; and m&#7771;&#7789;yu becomes one with the Supreme. And beyond Him, there is neither Sa&#7789; nor asa&#7789;, nor Sa&#7789;-asa&#7789;. Thus is the exposition of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a; thus is the exposition of the Ve&#7693;as; yea, thus is the exposition of the Ve&#7693;as."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kha&#7751;da</span> XIV&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></h5>

<p>Again Raikva asked: "O Lord, when this Vij&ntilde;&#257;na-ghana goes out (of the body or the universe), what does it burn and how?" To which He replied: "When it goes away, it burns pr&#257;&#7751;a, ap&#257;na, vy&#257;na, u&#7693;&#257;na, sam&#257;na, vairambha, mukhya, an&#7789;ary&#257;ma, prabha&ntilde;jana, kum&#257;ra, &#347;yena, k&#7771;sh&#7751;a, &#347;ve&#7789;a, and n&#257;ga. Then it burns p&#7771;&#7789;hiv&#299;, &#257;pas, &#7789;ejas, v&#257;yu, and &#257;k&#257;&#347;; then it burns the waking, the dreaming, the dreamless sleeping and the fourth states as well as the maharlokas and worlds higher; then it burns the lok&#257;loka (the highest world forming a limit to the other worlds). Then it burns &#7693;harma and a&#7693;harma. Then it burns that which is beyond, is sunless, limitless, and worldless. Then it burns maha&#7789;; it burns avyak&#7789;a; it burns akshara; it burns m&#7771;&#7789;yu; and m&#7771;&#7789;yu becomes one with the great Lord. Beyond Him, there is neither Sa&#7789; nor asa&#7789;, nor Sa&#7789;-asa&#7789;. Thus is the exposition of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a, and thus is the exposition of the Ve&#7693;as; yea, thus is the exposition of the Ve&#7693;as."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kha&#7751;da</span> XVI</h5>  
<p>"This Sub&#257;la-B&#299;ja-Brahma-Upanisha&#7693; should neither be given out nor taught to one who has not controlled his passions, who has no sons, who has not gone to a Guru, and having become his disciple has not resided with him for a year, and whose family and conduct are not known. These doctrines should be taught to him who has supreme devotion to the Lord and as much to his Guru. Then these truths shine in his great soul. Thus is the exposition of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a; thus is the exposition of the Ve&#7693;as; yea, thus is the exposition of the Ve&#7693;as."</p>
