<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_4a"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN><I>a</I>.</FONT> For there are not physicians, &amp;c., in every place and at all times; and [to rely on physicians, &amp;c., would not be advisable], even if there were the possibility,&#8212;i.e., even if these <I>were</I> [always at hand], since physicians are not <I>perfect</I> [in their art];&#8212;for pain cannot with certainty be got rid of by means of physicians, &amp;c., with their drugs, &amp;c.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_5a"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN><I>a</I>.</FONT> One ought not to endeavour after the removal of this or that pain by these and those expedients [<A HREF="#pp_1c">&sect; 1. <I>c</I>.</A>]; since Liberation (<I>moksha</I>), by being eternal, is transcendent as a remover of all pains. Moreover, one ought to endeavour only after the knowledge of truth, which is the means thereof [i.e., of Liberation]; because the Scripture tells its preeminence above all [other objects of endeavour], in the text: 'There is nothing beyond the gaining of Soul, [with the utter exclusion of pain].'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_7a"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN><I>a</I>.</FONT> Since Liberation has been stated [<A HREF="#pp_1">&sect; 1</A>] to result from the complete cessation of pain, [it follows that] Bondage is the junction of pain; and this is not <I>essential</I> in man. For, if that were the case, then there would be no rule, i.e., no fitness, in the Scriptural or legal injunction of means for liberation: such is what must be supplied, [to complete the aphorism]. Because, to explain our meaning [by an illustration], <I>fire</I> cannot be liberated from its <I>heat</I>, which is eseential to it; since that which is <I>essential</I> exists as long as the substance exists.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_8a"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN><I>a</I>.</FONT> That is to say: since the essential nature of anything is imperishable, i.e., endures as long as the thing itself, it would follow [on the supposition that pain is essential to humanity], that, since Liberation is <I>impossible</I>, the Scripture which enjoins the means for its attainment is a false authority, inasmuch as it is impracticable [in its injunctions.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_9a"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN><I>a</I>.</FONT> There can be no fitness, or propriety, in an injunction with a view to an impossible fruit; seeing that, though something be enjoined, or ordered [to be effected] by means that are impracticable, this is no injunction at all, but only the <I>semblance</I> of an injunction; because it stands to reason, that not even the <I>Veda</I> can make one see sense in an absurdity: such is the meaning.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_10a"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN><I>a</I>.</FONT> But then [the doubter is supposed to argue], the destruction even of what is essential [in spite of what is stated under <A HREF="#pp_7">&sect; 7</A>] <I>is</I> seen; as, for example, the essential whiteness of white cloth is removed by dyeing, and the essential power of germination in a seed is removed by

fire. Therefore, according to the analogy of the white cloth and the seed, it is possible that there should be the removal of the bondage of the soul, even though it <I>were</I> essential. So, too, there may be [without any impropriety] the enjoinment of the means thereof. Well, <I>if</I> [any one argues thus], such is the meaning [of the aphorism, to which he proceeds to reply].</P>

instances of the perceptibleness and non-perceptibleness of a power [the powers, namely, of appearing white and of germinating (see <A HREF="#pp_10a">&sect; 10. <I>a</I>.</A>)], there are merely the manifestation and [afterwards] the <I>hiding</I> of the whiteness, &amp;c., but not the <I>removal</I> of the whiteness, or of the power of germination; because, that is to say, the whiteness of the dyed cloth and the germinating power of the roasted seed can again be brought out by the processes of the bleacher, &amp;c., [in the case of the dyed cloth], and by the will of the <I>Yog&iacute;</I>, [the possessor of supernatural powers, in the case of the roasted seed], &amp;c.</P>

The substance of this is, that, only in the eyes of the mistaken man who is influenced by the notorious cause of bondage, or in other words, who is unable to discriminate, is the essential condition of souls multeity, a condition the reverse of the one before referred to, unity; and that is inconclusive. The Aphorism, thus undertood, must be assumed to proceed from a Ved&aacute;ntic disputant against the S&aacute;nkhya.
