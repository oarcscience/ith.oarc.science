## BOOK IV.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Now, by means of a collection of narratives, recognized in the
Institutes, the means of discriminative knowledge are to be displayed:
so, for this purpose the Fourth Book is commenced.

 

|                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul set right by hearing the truth.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_1"></span>*Aph*. 1.[\*](#pp_1) As in the case of the
king's son, from instruction as to the truth \[comes discrimination
between soul and Nature\].

   <span id="pp_1a"></span>*a*. 'Discrimination' is supplied from the
concluding aphorism of the preceding section. The meaning is: as, in the
case of the king's son, discrimination is produced by instruction as to
the truth. The story, here, is as follows: A certain king's son, in
consequence of his being born under the \[unlucky\] star of the tenth
portion<span id="page_284_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_284_note_2) \[of the
twenty-seven portions into which the ecliptic is divided\], having been
expelled from his city, and reared by a certain forester, remains under
the idea, that 'I am a forester.' Having learned that he is alive, a
certain minister informs him: 'Thou art not a forester; thou art a
king's son.' <span id="page_285">p. 285</span> As he, immediately,
having abandoned the idean of his being an outcast, betakes himself to
his true royal state, saying, 'I am a *king*,' so, too, it \[the Soul\],
in consequence of the instruction of some kind person, to the effect
that 'Thou, who didst originate from the First Soul, which manifests
itself merely as pure Thought, art \[thyself,\] a portion thereof,'
having abandoned the idea of its being Nature \[or of being something
material or phenomenal\], rests simply upon its own nature, saying,
'Since I am the son of Brahmá, I am, myself, Brahmá, and not something
mundane, different therefrom:' such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_1b"></span>*b*. He exhibits another story, to prove that
even women, <span id="page_286">p. 286</span> *Śúdras*, &c., may gain
the \[one desirable\] end, through a Bráhman, by hearing the
instructions of a Bráhman:

 

|                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Even when the instruction is not addressed to the hearer.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_2"></span>*Aph*. 2.[\*](#pp_2) As in the case of the
goblin, even when the instruction was for the sake of another, \[the
chance hearer may be benefited\].

   <span id="pp_2a"></span>*a*. That is to say: though the instruction
in regard to the truth was being delivered, by the venerable Kṛishṉa,
for Arjuna's benefit, knowledge of the distinction \[between Soul and
Nature\] was produced in the case of a goblin standing near \[and
overhearing the discourse\]: and so it may happen in the case of others,
too.

   <span id="pp_2b"></span>*b*. And, if knowledge is not produced from
*once* instructing, then a repetition of the instruction is to be made;
to which effect he adduces another story:

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Necessity of inculcation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_3"></span>*Aph*. 3.[\*](#pp_3) Repetition \[is to be
made\], if not, from once instructing, \[the end be gained\].

   <span id="pp_3a"></span>*a*. That is to say: a repetition of
instruction, also, is to be made; because, in the *Chhándogya*
\[*Upanishad*\],<span id="page_287_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_287_note_1)
and the like; there is mention of Áruṉi, and others, as having more than
once instructed Śwetaketu and others.

   <span id="pp_3b"></span>*b*. With a view to the removal of desire, he
sets forth, with an illustration, the fragility, &c., of Soul's
accompaniments:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Transitoriness of mundane things.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_4"></span>*Aph*. 4.[\*](#pp_4) As in the case of father
and son; since both are seen; \[to one, to die, and the other, to be
born\].

   <span id="pp_4a"></span>*a*. That is to say: Discrimination takes
place, through dispassion, in consequence of its being inferred, in
respect of one's own self, also, that there is death and birth; since
these are seen in the case of father and son. This has <span
id="page_288">p. 288</span> been stated as follows: 'The coming into
being, and the departure, of Soul \[entangled in Nature\],<span
id="page_288_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_288_note_1) may be inferred from
\[the case of\] father and son.'

   <span id="pp_4b"></span>*b*. He next explains, by illustrative
stories, the subservients to the *perfecting* of knowledge in him in
whom knowledge has arisen, and who is devoid of passion:

 

|                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Voluntary abandonment distinguished from involuntary.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_5"></span>*Aph*. 5.[\*](#pp_5) One experiences pleasure
or pain \[alternatively\], from \[voluntary\] abandonment or
\[forcible\] separation; as in the case of a hawk.

   <span id="pp_5a"></span>*a*. That is to say: since people become
happy by the abandonment of things, and unhappy by \[forcible\]
separation from them, acceptance of them ought not to be made; 'as in
the case of a hawk.'<span
id="page_288_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_288_note_4) For a hawk, when he has
food \[before him\], if he be driven away<span
id="page_288_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_288_note_5) by any one, is grieved
<span id="page_289">p. 289</span> at being separated from the food;
\[but\] if, of his own accord, he leaves it, then he is free from grief.

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How Soul ought to abandon Nature.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_6"></span>*Aph*. 6.[\*](#pp_6) As in the case of a snake
and its skin.

   <span id="pp_6a"></span>*a*. That is to say: as a snake readily
abandons its old skin, from knowing that it ought to be quitted, just so
he who desires liberation should abandon Nature, experienced through a
long period, and effete, when he knows that it ought to be quitted. Thus
it has been said: 'As a snake . . . its old skin,' &c.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

   <span id="pp_6b"></span>*b*. And, when abandoned, he should not again
accept Nature and the rest. So, in regard to this, he says:

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Its resumption prohibited.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_7"></span>*Aph*. 7.[\*](#pp_7) Or as an amputated hand.

   <span id="pp_7a"></span>*a*. As no one takes back again an amputated
hand, just so this \[Nature\], when abandoned, he should not readmit:
such is the meaning. The word 'Or' is used in the sense of moreover;'
\[the import of the conjunction being superadditive, not alternative\].

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Duty to be sacrificed to salvation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_8"></span>*Aph*. 8.[\*](#pp_8) What is not a means \[of
liberation is\] not to be thought about, \[as this conduces only\] to
bondage; as in the case of Bharata.

   <span id="pp_8a"></span>*a*. That which is not an immediate cause of
Discrimination, even though it may be a duty, still is 'not to be
thought about;' i.e., intention of the mind towards the performance
thereof is not to be made; since it tends to Bondage, from its making us
forget Discrimination. 'As in the case of Bharata:' that is to say, as
was the case <span id="page_291">p. 291</span> with the royal sage
Bharata's cherishing Dínánátha's<span
id="page_291_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_291_note_1) fawn, though \[this
was\] in accordance with duty.

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Company to be avoided.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_9"></span>*Aph*. 9.[\*](#pp_9) From \[association with\]
many there is obstruction to concentration, through passion, &c.; as in
the case of a girl's shells.<span
id="page_291_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_291_note_4)

   <span id="pp_9a"></span>*a*. Association is not to be made with many;
because, when there is association with many, there is disturbance,
through the manifestation of Passion, &c., which destroys concentration;
as a jingling is produced by the mutual <span id="page_292">p.
292</span> contact of the shells on a girl's wrist: such is the meaning.

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Even that of one.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_10"></span>*Aph*. 10.[\*](#pp_10) Just so, from \[the
company of\] two, also.

   <span id="pp_10a"></span>*a*. Just so, even from two there is
obstruction to concentration; therefore one ought to abide quite
*alone*: such is the meaning.

 

|                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Blessedness of those who expect nothing.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_11"></span>*Aph*. 11.[\*](#pp_11) He who is without hope
is happy; like Pingalá.<span
id="page_292_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_292_note_3)

   <span id="pp_11a"></span>*a*. Having abandoned hope, let a man become
possessed of the happiness called contentment; 'like Pingalá;' that is
to say, as the courtesan called Pingalá, desiring a lover, having found
no lover, being despondent, became happy, when she had left off hoping.

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

   <span id="pp_11b"></span>*b*. But then, granting that Pain may cease,
on the cessation of hope, yet how can there be *happiness*, in the
absence of causes thereof? It is replied: That natural happiness,
resulting from the predominance of Purity in the mind, which remains
obscured by hope, itself resumes its influence, on the departure of
hope; as is the case with the coolness of water which \[supposed natural
coolness\] had been hindered \[from manifesting itself,\] by heat: there
is not, in this case, any need of *means*. And it is laid down that
precisely this is happiness of Soul.

   <span id="pp_11c"></span>*c*. Since it is an obstructer of
Concentration, exertion with a view to experience is not to be made,
since this will be effected quite otherwise; as he states:

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

 

|                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Exertion needless.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_12"></span>*Aph*. 12.[\*](#pp_12) \[One may be happy,\]
even without exertion; like a serpent happy in another's house.

   <span id="pp_12a"></span>*a*. Supply, 'he may be happy.' The rest is
simple. So it has been said:<span
id="page_294_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_294_note_1) 'The building of a house
is, assuredly, painful, and in no way pleasant. A serpent, having
entered the dwelling made by another \[e.g., a rat\], does find
confort.'

   <span id="pp_12b"></span>*b*.From Institutes, and from preceptors,
only the essence is to be accepted; since, otherwise, it may be
impossible to concentrate the attention, from there being, by reason of
implications,<span id="page_294_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_294_note_3)
discussions, &c., discrepancies in declared unessential parts, and from
the multiplicity of topics. So he says:

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A bee-like eclecticism recommended.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_13"></span>*Aph*. 13.[\*](#pp_13) Though he devote
himself to many Institutes and teachers, a taking of the essence \[is to
be made\]; as is the case with the bee.

   <span id="pp_13a"></span>*a*. Supply 'is to be made.' The rest is
simple. Thus it has been said: 'From small Institutes, and from great,
the intelligent man should take, from all quarters, the essence; as the
bee does from the flowers.'

   <span id="pp_13b"></span>*b*. Be the other means what they may, the
direct possession of Discrimination is to be effected only by
intentness, through maintaining Meditation; as he tells us:

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Intentness on one object.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_14"></span>*Aph*. 14.[\*](#pp_14) The Meditation is not
interrupted of him whose mind is intent on one object; like the maker of
arrows.<span id="page_295_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_295_note_3)

   <span id="pp_14a"></span>*a*. As, in the case of a maker of arrows,
with his mind intent solely on the making of an arrow, the exclusion of
<span id="page_296">p. 296</span> other thoughts is not interrupted even
by a king's passing at his side, so, too, of him whose mind is intent on
one point there is in no way an 'interruption of meditation,' i.e., a
failure to exclude other thoughts.

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Rules not to be transgressed with impunity.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_15"></span>*Aph*. 15.[\*](#pp_15) Through transgression
of the enjoined rules there is failure in the aim; as in the world.

   <span id="pp_15a"></span>*a*. Whatever rule, for the practisers of
Concentration, has been laid down in the Institutes, if it be
transgressed, then the end, viz., the effecting of knowledge, is not
attained. 'As in the world.' That is to say: just as, in ordinary life,
if the enjoined procedures, &c., in regard to a medicine, or the like,
be neglected, this or that effect thereof will not be obtained.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

   <span id="pp_15b"></span>*b*. He states, further, that, if the rules
be *forgotten*, the end will not be gained:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Rules must not be forgotten.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_16"></span>*Aph*. 16.[\*](#pp_16) Moreover, if they be
forgotten; as in the case of the female frog.

   <span id="pp_16a"></span>*a*. This is plain. And the story of the
female frog is this: A certain king, having gone to hunt, saw a
beautiful damsel in the forest. And she, being solicited in marriage by
the king, made this stipulation: 'When water shall be shown to me by
thee, then I must depart.' But, on one occasion, when wearied with
sport, she asked the king, 'Where is water?' The king, too, forgetting
his agreement, showed her the water. Then she, having become the
she-frog *Kámarúpiṇí*,<span
id="page_297_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_297_note_2) daughter of the king of
the frogs, entered the water. And then the king, though he sought her
with nets, &c., did not regain her.

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

   <span id="pp_16b"></span>*b*. He mentions a story with reference to
the necessity of reflecting on the words of the teacher, as well as
hearing them:

 

|                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Reflexion necessary, as well as hearing.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_17"></span>*Aph*. 17.[\*](#pp_17) Not even though
instruction be heard is the end gained, without reflexion; as in the
case of Virochana.<span id="page_298_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_298_note_4)

   <span id="pp_17a"></span>*a*. By 'reflexion' is meant such
consideration as determines the import of the teacher's words. Without
this, though the instruction be heard, knowledge of the truth does not
necessarily follow; for it is written, that, though hearing the
instruction of Prajápati, Virochana, as <span id="page_299">p.
299</span> between Indra and Virochana, wanted discrimination, from want
of reflexion:

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Of this further.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_18"></span>*Aph*. 18.[\*](#pp_18) Of those two, it
\[reflexion,\] was seen in the case of Indra \[only\].

   <span id="pp_18a"></span>*a*. Of those two who are mentioned,
\[indicated\] by the expression 'of those two,' reflexion \[was seen,
&c.\]. And, as between those two, viz., Indra and Virochana, reflexion
was seen in the case of Indra: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_18b"></span>*b*. And he tells us, that, by him who
desires to understand thoroughly, attendance on the teacher should be
practised for a long time:

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The process requires time.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_19"></span>*Aph*. 19.[\*](#pp_19) Having performed
reverence, the duties of a student, and attendance, one has success
after a long time; as in his case.

   <span id="pp_19a"></span>*a*. 'As in his case.' That is to say: as in
the case of Indra, so in the case of another, too, only after having
practised, under a preceptor, reverence, study of the *Vedas*, service,
&c., is there 'success,' i.e., the revelation of truth; not otherwise.

 

|                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The time for the process may embrace successive states of being.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_20"></span>*Aph*. 20.[\*](#pp_20) There is no
determination of the time; as in the Case of Vámadeva.<span
id="page_300_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_300_note_3)

   <span id="pp_20a"></span>*a*. In the arising of knowledge, there is
'no determination of the time,' as, for instance, in its taking place
only from causes dependent on the senses. 'As in the Case of Vámadeva.'
That is to say: as, in consequence of causes pertaining to a previous
life, knowledge arose, in the case of Vámadeva, even when in embryo, so
it may in the case of another.

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

   <span id="pp_20b"></span>*b*. But then, since it is written, that the
means of knowledge need be nothing other than devotion to those \[viz.,
Brahmá, &c.,\] who \[unlike the Absolute,\] have Qualities, knowledge
may result from *this*. Why, then, a hard and subtle process of
Concentration? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Inferior means not altogether unprofitable.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_21"></span>*Aph*. 21.[\*](#pp_21) Through devotion to
something under a superinduced form, \[attainment to, or approach
towards, knowledge takes place\] *by degrees*; as in the case of those
who devote themselves to sacrifices.

   <span id="pp_21a"></span>*a*. Supply 'there is attainment.' Through
devotion to Souls, e.g., Brahmá, Vishṉu, Śiva, under the forms
superinduced on them, the effecting of knowledge takes place 'by
degrees,' i.e., by the successive attainment of <span id="page_302">p.
302</span> the worlds of Brahmá, &c., or else through the purification
or the Good principle, &c., but not *directly*; as is the case with
sacrificers \[whose slaughter of animals, requiring to be expiated,
throws them back, so far, in the road to emancipation\]: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_21b"></span>*b*. He tells us, that, moreover, there is
no certainty that successive rise to the worlds of Brahmá, &c., would
effect knowledge:

 

|                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Scriptural proof that heaven gives not liberation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_22"></span>*Aph*. 22.[\*](#pp_22) Moreover, after the
attainment of what \[like the world of Brahmá,\] is other \[than the
state of emancipated soul\], there is return \[to mundane existence\];
because it is written \[in the 5th *Prapáṭhaka* of the *Chhándogya
Upanishad*<span id="page_302_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_302_note_4)\]: 'From
conjunction with the five fires there is birth,' &c.

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

   <span id="pp_22a"></span>*a*. He exhibits an illustration, to the
effect that the effecting of knowledge takes place only in the case of
him who is free from passion:

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Discrimination illustrated.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_23"></span>*Aph*. 23.[\*](#pp_23) By him who is free
from passion what is to be left is left, and what is to be taken is
taken; as in the case of the swan and the milk.

   <span id="pp_23a"></span>*a*. That is to say: only by him who is free
from passion is there a quitting 'of what is to be left,' i.e., of
Nature, &c., and a taking 'of what is to be taken,' i.e., of Soul; as it
is only the swan,—and not the crow, or the like,—that, out of milk and
water mingled, by means of leaving the unimportant water, takes the
valuable milk, \[as the Hindus insist that it does\].

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

   <span id="pp_23b"></span>*b*. He tells us that both of these also
take place in consequence of association with a perfect<span
id="page_304_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_304_note_1) man:

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Benefit of good society.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_24"></span>*Aph*. 24.[\*](#pp_24) Or through association
with one who has obtained excellence;<span
id="page_304_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_304_note_4) as in the case thereof.

   <span id="pp_24a"></span>*a*. That is to say: moreover, from
association with him by whom 'excellence,' i.e., excellence in
knowledge, has been obtained, the aforesaid \[discrimination\] takes
place; just as in the case of the swan, \[[§ 23](#pp_23)\]; as, in the
case of Alarka, Discrimination manifested itself spontaneously, merely
through simple association with Dattátreya.

   <span id="pp_24b"></span>*b*. He tells us that we ought not to
associate with those who are infected with desire:

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

 

|                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Danger of unsuitable society.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_25"></span>*Aph*. 25.[\*](#pp_25) Not of his own accord
should he go near one who is infected with desire; like the parrot.

   <span id="pp_25a"></span>*a*. Association is not to be made,
voluntarily, with a person infected with desire. 'Like the parrot.' That
is to say: just as the bird \[called a\] parrot, by reason of its being
exceedingly beautiful, does not \[by going near people,\] act in a rash
manner, through fear of being imprisoned by those who covet it for its
beauty.

   <span id="pp_25b"></span>*b*. And he states the harm of association
with those who labour under desire:

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Of this further.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_26"></span>*Aph*. 26.[\*](#pp_26) \[Else he may become\]
bound, by conjunction with the cords; as in the case of the parrot.

   <span id="pp_26a"></span>*a*. And, in the case of associating with
those persons, he may become bound, 'by conjunction with the cords,'
i.e., by conjunction with their Desire, &c., \[the Qualities, punningly
compared to cords\]; just 'as in the case of the <span id="page_306">p.
306</span> parrot;' that is to say, just as the bird \[called a\] parrot
becomes bound by the cords, i.e., the ropes, of the hunter.

   <span id="pp_26b"></span>*b*. He determines, by two \[aphorisms\].
the means of \[effecting\] dispassion:

 

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Means of dispassion.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_27"></span>*Aph*. 27.[\*](#pp_27) Not by enjoyment is
desire appeased; as in the case of the saint.

   <span id="pp_27a"></span>*a*. That is to say: as, in the case of the
saint, Saubhari,<span id="page_306_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_306_note_3)
desire was not appeased by enjoyment, so, also in the case of others, it
is not.

   <span id="pp_27b"></span>*b*. But, further:

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Of this further.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_28"></span>*Aph*. 28.[\*](#pp_28) From seeing the fault
of both.

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

   <span id="pp_28a"></span>*a*. That is to say: only 'from seeing the
fault,' e.g., of being changeable, of consisting of pain, &c., 'of
both,' i.e., of Nature and her productions, does the appeasing of desire
take place; just as in the case of the saint \[[§ 27](#pp_27)\]. For it
is written, that Saubhari, just from seeing the evil of society, was
afterwards dispassionate.

   <span id="pp_28b"></span>*b*. He tells us that incompetency even to
accept instruction attaches to him who is infected with the fault of
desire, &c:

 

|                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Agitation excludes instruction.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_29"></span>*Aph*. 29.[\*](#pp_29) Not in the case of him
whose mind is disturbed does the seed of instruction sprout; as in the
case of Aja.

   <span id="pp_29a"></span>*a*. In him whose mind is disturbed by
desire, &c., not even does a sprout spring up from that seed of the tree
of knowledge which is in the shape of instruction. 'As in the case of
Aja.' That is to say: as not a sprout from <span id="page_308">p.
308</span> the seed of instruction, though delivered to him by
Vasishṭha, sprang up in the king named Aja, whose mind was disturbed by
grief for his wife.<span id="page_308_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_308_note_2)

   <span id="pp_29b"></span>*b*. What need of more?

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Of this further.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_30"></span>*Aph*. 30.[\*](#pp_30) Not even a mere
semblance \[of this true knowledge arises in him whose mind is
disturbed\]; as in the case of a foul mirror.

   <span id="pp_30a"></span>*a*. Even superficial knowledge does not
arise, from instruction, in one whose mind is disturbed, through the
obstruction caused by its wandering away, e.g., to other objects; as an
object is not reflected in a foul mirror, through the obstruction caused
by the impurities: such is the meaning.

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

   <span id="pp_30b"></span>*b*. Or, if knowledge should spring up in
any kind of way, still it may not, he tells us, be in accordance with
the instruction:

 

|                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Knowledge not necessarily perfect knowledge.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_31"></span>*Aph*. 31.[\*](#pp_31) Nor, even though
sprung therefrom, is that \[knowledge, necessarily,\] in accordance
therewith; like the lotus.

   <span id="pp_31a"></span>*a*. Though sprung 'therefrom,' i.e., from
instruction, knowledge is not \[necessarily,\] in accordance with the
instruction, in case this has not been entirely understood. 'Like the
lotus.' That is to say: just as the lotus, though the seed be of the
best, is not in accordance with the seed, when the mud is faulty. The
mind of the student is compared to the mud \[in which the lotus-seed was
sown\].

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

   <span id="pp_31b"></span>*b*. But then, since the Soul's end is,
indeed, gained by \[the attainment of\] supernatural power in the worlds
\[[§ 21. *a*.](#pp_21a)\] of Brahmá, &c., to what purpose is the
effecting of knowledge, with so much toil, for liberation? To this he
replies:

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Heaven not perfect bliss.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_32"></span>*Aph*. 32.[\*](#pp_32) Not even on the
attainment of glorification has that been done which was to be done; as
is the case with the perfection<span
id="page_310_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_310_note_4) of the objects
worshipped, as is the case with the perfection of the objects
worshipped.

   <span id="pp_32a"></span>*a*. Even though one attain to supernatural
power, 'that has not been done which was to be done,' i.e., the end has
not been gained; because it is attended by the grief of deficiency and
excess. 'As is the case with the perfection of the objects worshipped.'
That is to say: as, though the possession of perfection \[so called,\]
belongs to 'the objects <span id="page_311">p. 311</span> worshipped,'
i.e., to Brahmá, &c., \[still\] that has not been done which was to be
done; since it is written, that even *these*, while in the sleep of
Concentration, &c., \[still\] *practise* Concentration, \[from fear of
losing what they have attained to\]. Just in like manner is the case
with him who, by the worship of these, has attained to their
supernatural power. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_32b"></span>*b*. So much for the Fourth Book, that of
Tales, in the Commentary, composed by Vijnána Bhikshu, on Kapila's
Declaration of the Sánkhya.
