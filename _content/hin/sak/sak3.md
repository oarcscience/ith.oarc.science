## BOOK III.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   <span id="pp_0a"></span>*a*. In the next place, the gross product of
Nature, viz., the great elements and the dyad of bodies, is to be
described; and, after that, the going into various wombs, and the like;
\[this description being given\] with a view to that less perfect degree
of dispassionateness which is the cause of one's engaging upon the means
of knowledge; and, after that, with a view to perfect freedom from
passion, all the means of knowledge are to be told: so the Third
\[Book\] commences:

 

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The elements whence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_1"></span>*Aph*. 1.[\*](#pp_1) The origination of the
diversified \[world of sense\] is from that which has no difference.

   <span id="pp_1a"></span>*a*. '\[Which\] has no difference,' i.e.,
that in which there exists not a distinction, in the shape of calmness,
fierceness, dulness, &c., viz., the Subtile Elements, called 'the five
somethings, simply;' from this \[set of five\] is the origination <span
id="page_225">p. 225</span> of 'the diversified,' \[so called\] from
their possessing a difference, in the shape of the calm, &c., viz., the
gross, the great Elements: such is the meaning. For, the fact of
consisting of pleasure, or the like, in the shape of the calm, and the
rest, is manifested, in the degrees of greater, and less, &c., in the
gross Elements only, not in the Subtile; because *these*, since they
have but the one form of the calm, are manifest to the concentrated,
\[practitioners of meditation, but to no others\].

   <span id="pp_1b"></span>*b*. So then, having stated, by composing the
preceding Book, the origin of the twenty-three Principles, he states the
origination, therefrom, of the dyad of bodies:

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Body whence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_2"></span>*Aph*. 2.[\*](#pp_2) Therefrom, of the Body.

   <span id="pp_2a"></span>*a*. 'Therefrom,' i.e., from the twenty-three
Principles, <span id="page_226">p. 226</span> there is the origination
of the pair of Bodies, the Gross \[Body\] and the Subtile: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_2b"></span>*b*. Now he proves that mundane existence
could not be accounted for otherwise than on the ground of the
twenty-three Principles.

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Mundane existence whence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_3"></span>*Aph*. 3.[\*](#pp_3) From the seed thereof is
mundane existence.

   <span id="pp_3a"></span>*a*. 'Thereof,' i.e., of the Body; 'from the
seed,' i.e., from the Subtile one, as its cause, in the shape of the
twenty-three Principles, is 'mundane existence,' i.e., do the going and
coming of Soul take place; for it is impossible that, of itself, there
should be a going, &c., of that which, in virtue of \[its\]
all-pervadingness, is immovable: such is the meaning. For Soul, being
conditioned by the twenty-three Principles, only by means of that
investment migrates from Body to Body, with a view to experiencing the
fruits of previous works.

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

   <span id="pp_3b"></span>*b*. He states, also, the limit of mundane
existence.

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Mundane existence till when.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_4"></span>*Aph*. 4.[\*](#pp_4) And, till there is
discrimination, there is the energizing of these, which have no
differences.

   <span id="pp_4a"></span>*a*. The meaning is, that, of all Souls
whatever, void of the differences of being Lord, or not Lord, &c.,
\[though, seemingly, possessed of such differences,\] 'energizing,'
i.e., mundane existence, is inevitable, even till there is
discrimination \[of Soul from its seeming investments\]; and it does not
continue after that.

   <span id="pp_4b"></span>*b*. He states the reason of this:

 

|                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The reason of this.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_5"></span>*Aph*. 5.[\*](#pp_5) Because of \[the
necessity of\] the other's experiencing.

   <span id="pp_5a"></span>*a*. The meaning is: because of the necessity
that the <span id="page_228">p. 228</span> other, i.e., that that very
\[Soul\], which does not discriminate, should experience the fruit of
its own \[reputed\] acts.

   <span id="pp_5b"></span>*b*. He states, that, even while there is a
Body, during the time of mundane existence, fruition \[really\] is not:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul's bondage only seeming.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_6"></span>*Aph*. 6.[\*](#pp_6) It \[Soul,\] is now quite
free from both.

   <span id="pp_6a"></span>*a*. 'Now,' i.e., during the time of mundane
existence. Soul is quite free 'from both,' i.e., from the pairs, viz.,
cold and heat, pleasure and pain, &c.: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_6b"></span>*b*. He next proceeds to describe,
separately, the dyad of Bodies:

 

|                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Gross and the Subtile Bodies distinguished.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_7"></span>*Aph*. 7.[\*](#pp_7) The Gross \[Body\]
usually arises from father and mother; the other one is not so.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

   <span id="pp_7a"></span>*a*. The Gross one arises from father and
mother, 'usually,' i.e., for the most part; for there is mention also of
a Gross Body *not* born of a womb: and 'the other,' i.e., the Subtile
Body, is 'not so,' i.e., does not arise from a father and mother;
because *it* arises from creation, &c.: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_7b"></span>*b*. He decides \[the question\], through
disguise by which one of the Bodies, Gross and Subtile, the conjunction
of the pairs \[pleasure and pain, &c.,\] with Soul takes place.

 

|                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Which of the bodies is the cause of Soul's bondage.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_8"></span>*Aph*. 8.[\*](#pp_8) To that which arose
antecedently it belongs to be that whose result is this; because it is
to the one that there belongs fruition, not to the other.

   <span id="pp_8a"></span>*a*. 'To be that whose result is this,' i.e.,
to have pleasure and pain as its effect \[reflected in Soul\], belongs
to that Subtile Body alone whose origin was 'antecedent,' i.e., at the
commencement of the creation \[or annus magnus\]. Why? Because the
fruition of what is called pleasure and pain belongs only to 'the one,'
i.e., the Subtile Body, but not to 'the other,' i.e., the Gross Body;
because all are <span id="page_230">p. 230</span> agreed that there is
neither pleasure nor pain, &c., in a body of *earth*: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_8b"></span>*b*. He tells the nature of the Subtile Body
just mentioned:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Subtile Body how constituted.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_9"></span>*Aph*. 9.[\*](#pp_9) The seventeen, as one,
are the Subtile Body.

   <span id="pp_9a"></span>*a*. The Subtile Body, further, through its
being container and contained, is twofold. Here the seventeen,
\[presently mentioned,\] mingled, are the Subtile Body; and that, at the
beginning of a creation, is but one, in the shape of an aggregate; \[as
the forest, the aggregate of many trees, is but one\]: such is the
meaning. The seventeen are the eleven organs, the five Subtile Elements,
and Understanding. Self-consciousness is included under Understanding.

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

   <span id="pp_9b"></span>*b*. But \[one may ask,\] if the Subtile Body
be *one*, how can there be diverse experiences accordingly as Souls are
\[numerically\] distinct, \[one from another\]? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How there come to be individuals.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_10"></span>*Aph*. 10.[\*](#pp_10) There is distinction
of individuals, through diversity of desert.

   <span id="pp_10a"></span>*a*. Although, at the beginmng of the
creation \[or annus magnus\], there was but one Subtile Body, in the
shape of that investment \[of Soul (see *Vedánta-sára*, § 62.) named\]
*Hiraṉyagarbha*, still, subsequently, moreover, there becomes a division
of it into individuals,—a plurality, partitively, in the shape of
individuals;—as, at present, there is, of the one Subtile Body of a
father, a plurality, partitively, in the shape of the Subtile Body of
son, daughter, &c. He tells the cause of this, saying, 'through
diversity of desert;' meaning, through actions, &c., which are causes of
the experiences of other animal souls.<span
id="page_230_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_230_note_3)

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

   <span id="pp_10b"></span>*b*. But then, on this showing, since the
Subtile one alone, from its being the site of fruition, is \[what ought
to be denoted by the term\] *Body*, how is the term Body applied to the
Gross one? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Why the Gross Body is called a Body.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_11"></span>*Aph*. 11.[\*](#pp_11) From its being applied
to *it*, \[viz., to the Subtile one\], it is applied to the Body, which
is the tabernacle of the abiding thereof.

   <span id="pp_11a"></span>*a*. But then, what proof is there of
another body,—other than the one consisting of the six sheaths,—serving
as a tabernacle for the Subtile Body? With reference to this, he says:

 

|                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Subtile Body dependent on the Gross Body.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_12"></span>*Aph*. 12.[\*](#pp_12) Not independently
\[can the Subtile Body exist\], without that \[Gross Body\]; just like a
shadow and a picture.

   <span id="pp_12a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the Subtile Body does
not stand independently, 'without that,' i.e., without a support; as a
shadow, or as a picture, does not stand without a support. And so,
having abandoned a Gross Body, in order to go <span id="page_233">p.
233</span> to another world, it is settled that the Subtile Body takes
another body, to serve as its tabernacle: such is the import.

   <span id="pp_12b"></span>*b*. But then \[it may be said\], of the
Subtile Body, since it is limited substance, as the Air, or the like,
let the *Ether* \[or *Space*\], without \[its\] being attached \[to
anything\], be the site: it is purposeless to suppose \[its\] attachment
to anything else. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   For it must have a material support.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_13"></span>*Aph*. 13.[\*](#pp_13) No, even though it be
limited; because of \[its\] association with masses; just like the sun.

   <span id="pp_13a"></span>*a*. Though it be limited, it does not abide
independently, without association; for, since, just like the sun, it
consists of *light*, it is inferred to be associated with a mass: such
is the meaning, All lights, the sun and the rest, are seen only under
the circumstances of association \[of the luminiferous imponderable\]
with earthy subtances; and the Subtile Body <span id="page_234">p.
234</span> consists of 'Purity,' which is Light: therefore it must be
associated with the Elements.

   <span id="pp_13b"></span>*b*. He determines the magnitude of the
Subtile Body:

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Size of the Subtile Body.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_14"></span>*Aph*. 14.[\*](#pp_14) It is of atomic
magnitude; for there is a Scripture for its acting.

   <span id="pp_14a"></span>*a*. 'It,' the Subtile Body, is 'of atomic
magnitude,' i.e., limited, but not absolutely an *atom*; because it is
declared to have parts. Wherefore? 'For there is Scripture for its
acting;' i.e., because there is Scripture about its acting. When a thing
is all-prevading, it cannot act; \[action being motion\]. But the proper
reading is, 'because there is Scripture for its *moving*.'

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

   <span id="pp_14b"></span>*b*. He states another argument for its
being limited:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another proof of this.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_15"></span>*Aph*. 15.[\*](#pp_15) And because there is
Scripture for its being formed of food.

   <span id="pp_15a"></span>*a*. That is to say: it, viz., the Subtile
Body, cannot be all-pervading; because there is a Scripture for its
being partially formed of food; for, if it were all-pervading, it would
be eternal. Although Mind, &c., are not formed of the Elements, still it
is to be understood that they are spoken of as formed of food, &c.;
because they are filled with homogeneous particles, through contact with
food; \[as the light of a lamp is supplied by contact with the oil\].

   <span id="pp_15b"></span>*b*. For what purpose is the mundane
existence, the migrating from one body to another \[Gross\] body, of
Subtile <span id="page_236">p. 236</span> Bodies, which are
*unintelligent*? With reference to this, he says:

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Why the Subtile Body migrates.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_16"></span>*Aph*. 16.[\*](#pp_16) The mundane existence
of is for the sake of Soul; just like a king's cooks.

   <span id="pp_16a"></span>*a*. That is to say: as the cooks of a king
frequent the kitchens for the sake of the king, so the Subtile Bodies
transmigrate for the sake of Soul.

   <span id="pp_16b"></span>*b*. The Subtile Body has been discussed in
respect of all its peculiarities. He now likewise discusses the Gross
Body, also:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Gross Body whence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_17"></span>*Aph*. 17.[\*](#pp_17) The Body consists of
the five elements.

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

   <span id="pp_17a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the Body is a
modification of the five elements mingled.

   <span id="pp_17b"></span>*b*. He mentions another opinion:

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another opinion.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_18"></span>*Aph*. 18.[\*](#pp_18) Some say it consists
of *four* elements.

   <span id="pp_18a"></span>*a*. This \[is alleged\] with the import
that the *Ether* does not originate \[anything\].

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another opinion.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_19"></span>*Aph*. 19.[\*](#pp_19) Others say that it
consists of *one* element.

   <span id="pp_19a"></span>*a*. The import is, that the body is of
Earth only, and the other elements are merely supporters. Or 'of one
element' means, of one or other element: \[see the Rosicrucian doctrine
in the *Tarka-sangraha*, § 13., &c\].

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

   <span id="pp_19b"></span>*b*. He tells us what is proved by the fact
that the Body consists of the Elements:

 

|                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Intellect not the result of organization.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_20"></span>*Aph*. 20.[\*](#pp_20) Intellect is not
natural \[a natural result of organization\]; because it is not found in
them severally.

   <span id="pp_20a"></span>*a*. That is to say: since we do not find
intellect in the separated Elements, intellect is not natural to the
Body,— which consiste of the Elements,—but is adventitious.

   <span id="pp_20b"></span>*b*. He states another refutation \[of the
notion that Intellect is a property of the Body\]:

 

|                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A further argument.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_21"></span>*Aph*. 21.[\*](#pp_21) And \[if the Body had
intellect natural to it,\] there would not be the death, &c., of
anything.

   <span id="pp_21a"></span>*a*. That is to say: and, if the Body had
intellect natural to it, there would not be the death, the profound
sleep, &c., 'of anything,' of all things. For death, profound sleep,
&c., imply the body's being non-intelligent; and this, if it were, by
its own nature, intelligent, would not take <span id="page_239">p.
239</span> place; because the essential nature of a thing remains as
long as the thing remains.

   <span id="pp_21b"></span>*b*. Pondering a doubt, as to the assertion
\[in [§ 20](#pp_20)\], viz., 'because it is not found in them
severally,' he repels it:

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An illustrative objection disposed of.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_22"></span>*Aph*. 22.[\*](#pp_22) If \[you say that
Intellect results from organization, and that\] it is like the power of
something intoxicating, \[the ingredients of which, separately, have no
intoxicating power, we reply, that\] this might arise, on conjunction,
if we had seen, in each \[element, something conducive to the result\].

   <span id="pp_22a"></span>*a*. But then, as an intoxicating power,
though not residing in the substances severally, resides in the mixed
substance, so may Intellect, also, be; if any one say this, it is not
so. If it *had been* seen in each \[constituent\], its appearance in the
compound might have had place; but, in the case in question, it is not
the case that it is seen in each. <span id="page_240">p. 240</span>
Therefore, in the illustration \[of something intoxicating resulting
from mixture\], it being established, by the Institutes, &c., that there
is, in each ingredient, a *subtile* tendency to intoxicate, it is
settled only that, at the time when these combine, there will be a
*manifestation* of the \[latent\] power of intoxicating; but, in the
thing illustrated, it is not established, by any proof whatsoever, that
there is intelligence, in a subtile \[or undeveloped\] state, in the
elements separately: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_22b"></span>*b*. It was stated \[[§ 16](#pp_16),\] that
the Subtile Bodies transmigrate for the sake of Soul. In regard to this,
he tells, in two aphorisms, by what operation, dependent on the birth of
the Subtile Bodies, which means their transmigrations into Gross Bodies,
what aims of Soul are accomplished:

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

 

|                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Purpose of the Subtile Body's taking a gross one.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_23"></span>*Aph*. 23.[\*](#pp_23) From knowledge
\[acquired during mundane existence, comes\] salvation, \[Soul's *chief*
end\].

   <span id="pp_23a"></span>*a*. That is to say: by the transmigration
of the Subtile Body, through birth, there takes place the direct
operation of discrimination \[between Soul and Non-soul\]; \[and\]
thence, in the shape of emancipation, Soul's \[chief\] End.

 

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Bondage whence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_24"></span>*Aph*. 24.[\*](#pp_24) Bondage \[which may be
viewed as one of the ends which Soul could arrive at only through the
Subtile Body,\] is from Misconception.

   <span id="pp_24a"></span>*a*. Through the transmigration of the
subtile body, from misconception, there is that \[less worthy\] end of
soul, in the shape of bondage, consisting of pleasure and pain: such is
the meaning.

   <span id="pp_??b"></span>*b*. Liberation and Bondage, \[resulting\]
from knowledge and misconception \[respectively\], have been mentioned.
Of these, in the first place, he explains Liberation \[arising\] from
knowledge:

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

 

|                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Knowledge has neither cooperator nor substitute, in liberating Soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_25"></span>*Aph*. 25.[\*](#pp_25) Since this \[viz.,
knowledge,\] is the precise cause \[of liberation\], there is neither
association \[of anything else with it, e.g., good works,\] nor
alternativeness, \[e.g., of good works, in its stead\].

   <span id="pp_25a"></span>*a*. In respect of there being neither
association nor alternativeness, he states an illustration:

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This illustrated.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_26"></span>*Aph*. 26.[\*](#pp_26) The emancipation of
Soul does not depend on both \[knowledge and works, or the like\]; as
\[any end that one aims at is not obtained\] from dreams and from the
waking state, \[together, or alternatively, which are, severally,\]
illusory and not illusory.

   <span id="pp_26a"></span>*a*. But, even if it be so, \[some one may
say,\] there may be association, or alternativeness, of knowledge of the
truth with that knowledge which is termed Worship of \[the One,
all-constitutive, divine\] Soul; since there is no *illusoriness* in
*this* object of Worship. To this he replies:

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Man's conception of the All is faulty.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_27"></span>*Aph*. 27.[\*](#pp_27) Even of that other it
is not complete.

   <span id="pp_27a"></span>*a*. Even of 'that other,' i.e., of the
\[just-mentioned\] object of worship, the non-illusoriness is not
complete; because imaginary things, also, enter into \[our conception
of, and overlie, and disguise,\] the object of worship, the \[One,
all-constitutive\] Soul: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_27b"></span>*b*. He states in what *part* \[of it\] is
the illusoriness of the \[object of\] Worship, \[just referred to\]:

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Where the fault applies.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_28"></span>*Aph*. 28.[\*](#pp_28) Moreover, it is in
what is *fancied* that it is thus \[illusory\].

   <span id="pp_28a"></span>*a*. That is to say: 'moreover, it is thus,'
i.e., moreover, there is illusoriness, in that portion of the thing
meditated which \[portion of it\] is fancied by the Mind, \[while it
does not exist in reality\]; for, the object of worship having been
declared in such texts as, 'All this, indeed, is Brahma,'<span
id="page_243_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_243_note_3) the illusoriness belongs
entirely to that portion \[of the impure conception of 'the All' which
presents itself, to the undiscriminating, under the aspect\] of the
world.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

   <span id="pp_28b"></span>*b*. Then what profit is there in Worship?
With reference to this, he declares \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The fruit of Worship.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_29"></span>*Aph*. 29.[\*](#pp_29) From the achievement
of \[the worship termed\] meditation there is, to the pure \[Soul\], all
\[power\]; like Nature.

   <span id="pp_29a"></span>*a*. Through the effecting of the worship
which is termed meditation, there becomes, to the 'pure,' i.e., the
sinless, Soul, all power; as belongs to Nature: such is the meaning.
That is to say: as Nature creates, sustains, and destroys, so also the
Purity of the understanding of the worshipper, by instigating Nature,
creates, &c. \[But this is not Liberation, or Soul's chief end.\]

   <span id="pp_29b"></span>*b*. It has been settled that Knowledge
alone is the means of Liberation. Now he mentions the *means* of
Knowledge:

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

 

|                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Removal of obstacles to knowledge.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_30"></span>*Aph*. 30.[\*](#pp_30) Meditation is \[the
cause of\] the removal of Desire.

   <span id="pp_30a"></span>*a*. That is to say: Meditation is the cause
of the removal of that affection of the mind by objects, which is a
hinderer of knowledge.

   <span id="pp_30b"></span>*b*. With advertence to the fact that
knowledge arises from the effectuation of Meditation, and not from
merely commencing upon it, he characterizes the effectuation of
Meditation:

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Meditation at what point perfected.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_31"></span>*Aph*. 31.[\*](#pp_31) It \[Meditation,\] is
perfected by the repelling of the modifications \[of the Mind, which
ought to be abstracted from all thoughts of anything\].

   <span id="pp_31a"></span>*a*. He mentions also the means of
Meditation:

 

|                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Practices conducive to meditation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_32"></span>*Aph*. 32.[\*](#pp_32) This \[Meditation,\]
is perfected by Restraint, Postures, and one's Duties.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

   <span id="pp_32a"></span>*a*. That is to say: Meditation results from
the triad, which shall be mentioned, viz., Restraint, &c.

   <span id="pp_32b"></span>*b*. By means of a triad of aphorisms he
characterizes, in order, Restraint, &c.:

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Restraint of the breath.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_33"></span>*Aph*. 33.[\*](#pp_33) Restraint \[of the
breath\] is by means of expulsion and retention.<span
id="page_246_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_246_note_3)

   <span id="pp_33a"></span>*a*. That it is 'of the breath' is gathered
from the notoriousness \[of its being so\].

   <span id="pp_33b"></span>*b*. He characterizes Postures, which come
next in order:

 

|                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Postures.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_34"></span>*Aph*. 34.[\*](#pp_34) Steady and
\[promoting\]<span id="page_246_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_246_note_*) ease
is a \[suitable\] Posture.

   <span id="pp_34a"></span>*a*. That is to say: that is a Posture
which, being steady, is a cause of pleasure; such as the crossing of the
arms.

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

   <span id="pp_34b"></span>*b*. He characterizes one's Duty:

 

|                                             |
|---------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   One's duty.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_35"></span>*Aph*. 35.[\*](#pp_35) One's Duty is the
performance of the actions prescribed for one's religious order.

   <span id="pp_35a"></span>*a*. Simple.

 

|                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Knowledge by Concentrantion how attained.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_36"></span>*Aph*. 36.[\*](#pp_36) Through Dispassion and
Practice.

   <span id="pp_36a"></span>*a*. Simply through mere Practice, in the
shape of Meditation, accompanied by Dispassion, Knowledge, with its
instrument, Concentration, takes place in the case of those who are most
competent \[to engage in the matter\]: such is the meaning. Thus has
liberation through knowledge been expounded.

   <span id="pp_36b"></span>*b*. After this, the cause of Bondage, viz.,
Misconception, declared in \[the assertion,\] 'Bondage is from
Misconception,' \[[§ 24](#pp_24)\], is to be expounded. Here he first
states the nature of Misconception:

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Misconception defined.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_37"></span>*Aph*. 37.[\*](#pp_37) The kinds of
Misconception are five.

   <span id="pp_37a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the subdivisions of
Misconception, which is the cause of Bondage, are Ignorance, Egoism,
Desire, Aversion, and Fear of Dissolution; the five mentioned in the
*Yoga*, \[see *Yoga Aphorisms*, Book II., § 3<span
id="page_248_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_248_note_2)\].

   <span id="pp_37b"></span>*b*. Having stated the nature of
Misconception, he states also the nature of its cause, viz., Disability:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The varieties of Disability.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_38"></span>*Aph*. 38.[\*](#pp_38) But Disability is of
twenty-eight sorts.<span id="page_248_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_248_note_5)

   <span id="pp_38a"></span>*a*. Simple; \[as explained in the *Yoga*\].

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

   <span id="pp_38b"></span>*b*. In a couple of aphorisms he mentions
\[those\] two. Acquiescence and Perfection, on the prevention of which
come two sorts of Disability of the Understanding:

 

|                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Acquiescence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_39"></span>*Aph*. 39.[\*](#pp_39) Acquiescence is of
nine sorts.

   <span id="pp_39a"></span>*a*. He will, himself, explain how it is of
nine sorts.

 

|                                              |
|----------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Perfections.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_40"></span>*Aph*. 40.[\*](#pp_40) Perfection is of eight
sorts.

   <span id="pp_40a"></span>*a*. This, also, he will, himself, explain.

   <span id="pp_40b"></span>*b*. Of the aforesaid, viz., Misconception,
Disability, Acquiescence, and Perfection, since there may be a desire to
know the particulars, there is, in order, a quaternion of aphorisms:

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

 

|                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Their subdivisions.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_41"></span>*Aph*. 41.[\*](#pp_41) The subdivisions \[of
Misconception\] are as \[declared\] aforetime.

   <span id="pp_41a"></span>*a*. The subdivisions of Misconception,
which, in a general way, have been stated as five, are to be understood
to be particularized 'as aforetime,' i.e., just as they have been
declared by preceding teachers: they are not explained here, for fear of
prolixity: such is the meaning.

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Of this further.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_42"></span>*Aph*. 42.[\*](#pp_42) So of the other
\[viz., Disability\].

   <span id="pp_42a"></span>*a*. That is to say: 'so,' i.e., just as
aforetime \[[§ 41](#pp_41)\], the divisions 'of the other,' viz., of
Disability, also, which are twenty-eight, are to be understood, as
regards their particularities.

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Acquiescence divided.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_43"></span>*Aph*. 43.[\*](#pp_43) Acquiescence is
ninefold, through the divisions of 'the internal and the rest.'

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

   <span id="pp_43a"></span>*a*. This aphorism is explained by a
memorial verse \[No. 50<span
id="page_251_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_251_note_2)\].

 

|                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Perfection divided.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_44"></span>*Aph*. 44.[\*](#pp_44) Through Reasoning,
&c., \[which are its subdivisions,\] Perfection \[is eightfold\].

   <span id="pp_44a"></span>*a*. That is to say: Perfection is of eight
kinds, through its divisions, viz., Reasoning, &c. This aphorism, also,
'has been explained in a memorial verse,' \[No. 51<span
id="page_251_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_251_note_4)\].

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

   <span id="pp_44b"></span>*b*. But then, how is it said that
Perfection consists only of 'Reasoning, &c.,' seeing that it is
determined, in all the Institutes, that the eight Perfections, viz.,
\[the capacity of assuming\] atomic bulk, &c., result from recitations,
austerity, meditation, &c.? To this he replies:

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The enumeration defended.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_45"></span>*Aph*. 45.[\*](#pp_45) Not from any other
\[than what we have just stated does real Perfection arise; because what
does arise therefrom, e.g., from austerities, is\] without abandonment
of something else, \[viz., Misconception\].

   <span id="pp_45a"></span>*a*. 'From any other,' i.e., from anything.
different from the pentad, 'Reasoning, &c.,' e.g., from Austerity, &c.,
there is no real Perfection. Why? 'Without abandonment of something
else;' i.e., because *that* Perfection \[which you choose to call such\]
takes place positively without abandonment of something else, i.e., of
Misconception: therefore \[*that* Perception\], since it is no
antagonist to mundane existence, is only a *semblance* of a Perfection,
and not a real Perfection: such is the meaning.

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

   <span id="pp_45b"></span>*b*. Now the individuated creation, which
was mentioned concisely in the assertion, 'There is distinction of
individuals through diversity of desert,' \[[§ 10](#pp_10)\], is set
forth diffusely:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The creation viewed in its parts.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_46"></span>*Aph*. 46.[\*](#pp_46) \[The creation is
that\] of which the subdivisions are the demons, &c.

   <span id="pp_46a"></span>*a*. Supply, such is that creation, of which
'the subdivisions,' the included divisions, are the demons, &c. This is
explained in a memorial verse, \[No. 53<span
id="page_253_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_253_note_3)\].

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

   <span id="pp_46b"></span>*b*. He states that the aforesaid subdivided
creation, also, is for the sake of Soul:

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This creation, also, for Soul's sake.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_47"></span>*Aph*. 47.[\*](#pp_47) From Brahmá down to a
post, for its \[Soul's,\] sake is creation, till there be discrimination
\[between Soul and Nature\].

   <span id="pp_47a"></span>*a*. He mentions, further, the division of
the subdivided creation, in three aphorisms:

 

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The celestial world.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_48"></span>*Aph*. 48.[\*](#pp_48) Aloft, it \[the
creation,\] abounds in \[the quality of\] Purity.

   <span id="pp_48a"></span>*a*. That is to say: 'aloft,' above the
world of mortals, the creation has chiefly \[the Quality of\] Purity.

 

|                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The infernal world.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_49"></span>*Aph*. 49.[\*](#pp_49) Beneath, it \[the
creation,\] abounds in Darkness.

   <span id="pp_49a"></span>*a*. 'Beneath,' that is to say, under the
world of mortals.

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The world of mortals.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_50"></span>*Aph*. 50.[\*](#pp_50) In the midst, it \[the
creation,\] abounds in Passion.

   <span id="pp_50a"></span>*a*. 'In the midst,' that is to say, in the
world of mortals.

   <span id="pp_50b"></span>*b*. But then, for what reason are there,
from one single Nature, creations diverse in having, affluently, purity
and the rest? With reference to this, he says:

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Why Nature operates diversely.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_51"></span>*Aph*. 51.[\*](#pp_51) By reason of diversity
of desert is Nature's \[diverse\] behaviour; like a born-slave.

   <span id="pp_51a"></span>*a*. Just by reason of diverse desert is the
behaviour of Nature, as asserted, in the shape of diversity of
operation. An illustration of the diversity is \[offered in the
example\], 'like a born-slave.' That is to say: as, of him who is a
slave from the embryo-state upwards, there are, through the aptitude
arising from the habit<span
id="page_255_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_255_note_3) of being a dependant,
various sorts of behaviour, i.e., of service, for the sake of his
master, so \[does Nature serve soul in various ways\].

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

   <span id="pp_51b"></span>*b*. But then, if the creation aloft is
abundant in Purity \[the element of joy\], since Soul's object is really
thereby effected, what need is there of *Liberation*? To this he
replies:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Why Heaven is to be shunned.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_52"></span>*Aph*. 52.[\*](#pp_52) Even there there is
return \[to miserable states of existence\]: it is to be shunned, by
reason of the successive subjections to birth, \[from which the
inhabitants of Heaven enjoy no immunity\].

   <span id="pp_52a"></span>*a*. Moreover:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Transitoriness of heavenly bliss.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_53"></span>*Aph*. 53.[\*](#pp_53) Alike \[belongs to
all\] the sorrow produced by decay and death.

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

   <span id="pp_53a"></span>*a*. Common to all alike, those that are
aloft and those beneath, beginning with Brahmá and ending with a stock,
is the 'sorrow produced by decay and death'; therefore, moreover, it
\[heaven,\] is to be shunned: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_53b"></span>*b*. What need of more? The end is not
effected by absorption into the cause, either; as he tells us:

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Absorption into Nature ineffectual.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_54"></span>*Aph*. 54.[\*](#pp_54) Not by absorption into
the cause is there accomplishment of the end; because, as in the case of
one who has dived, there is a rising again.

   <span id="pp_54a"></span>*a*. In the absence of knowledge of the
distinction \[between Soul and Nature\], when indifference towards Mind,
&c., has resulted from worship of Nature, then absorption into Nature
takes place; for it is declared: 'Through Dispassion there is absorption
into Nature.' Even through this, i.e., the absorption into the cause,
the end is not gained; 'because there is a rising again; as in the case
of one who has dived.' As a man who has dived under water rises again,
exactly so do Souls which have been absorbed into Nature reappear, \[at
the commencement of a new annus magnus\], in the condition of Lords;
because it is <span id="page_258">p. 258</span> impossible that one's
Faults should be consumed, without a familiarity with the distinction
\[between Soul and Nature\], in consequence of the reappearance of
Passion, by reason of the non-destruction of habits,<span
id="page_258_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_258_note_1) &c.: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_54b"></span>*b*. But then, the cause is not by anyone
caused to act. Being independent, then, why does she \[Nature,\] make
that grief-occasioning resurrection of her own worshipper? To this he
replies:

 

|                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature free to act, yet guided by an end.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_55"></span>*Aph*. 55.[\*](#pp_55) Though she be not
constrained to act, yet this is fitting; because of her being devoted to
another.

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

   <span id="pp_55a"></span>*a*. Though Nature is 'not constrained to
act,' not instigated, not subject to the will of another, yet 'this is
fitting;' it is proper that he who is absorbed in her should rise again.
Why? 'Because of her being devoted to another;' i.e., because she seeks
Soul's end. The meaning is that he who is absorbed in her is again
raised up, by Nature, for the sake of Soul's end, which consists in
knowledge of the distinction \[between Nature and Soul\]. And Soul's
end, and the like, are not *constrainers* of Nature, but occasions for
the energizing of her whose very being is to energize; so that there is
nothing detracted from her independence.

   <span id="pp_55b"></span>*b*. He mentions, further, a proof that Soul
rises from absorption into Nature:

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The gain of absorption into Nature.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_56"></span>*Aph*. 56.[\*](#pp_56) \[He who is absorbed
into Nature must rise again;\] for he becomes omniscient and omnipotent
\[in a subsequent creation\].

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

   <span id="pp_56a"></span>*a*. For 'he,' viz., he who, in a previous
creation, was absorbed into the Cause, in a subsequent creation becomes
'omniscient and omnipotent;' the Lord, the First Spirit.

   <span id="pp_56b"></span>*b*. But then, if that be so, it is
impossible to deny<span id="page_260_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_260_note_2)
a *Lord*, \[which, nevertheless, the *Sánkhyas* seem to do\]. To this he
replies.

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   In what sense there is a Lord.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_57"></span>*Aph*. 57.[\*](#pp_57) The existence of
*such* a Lord is a settled point.

   <span id="pp_57a"></span>*a*. It is quite agreed, by all, that there
is an emergent Lord, he who had been absorbed into Nature; for the
ground of dispute \[between *Sánkhyas* and the rest,\] is altogether
about an *eternal* Lord: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_57b"></span>*b*. He expounds diffusely the motive for
Nature's creating, which was mentioned only indicatorily in the first
aphorism of the Second Book:

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature's disinterestedness.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_58"></span>*Aph*. 58.[\*](#pp_58) Nature's creating is
for the sake of another, though it be spontaneous;—for she is not the
experiencer;—like a cart's carrying saffron \[for the sake of its
master\].

   <span id="pp_58a"></span>*a*. But then, it is quite impossible that
Nature, being unintelligent, should be, spontaneously, a creator; for we
see that a cart, or the like, operates only by reason of the efforts of
another. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature's spontaneous action illustrated.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_59"></span>*Aph*. 59.[\*](#pp_59) Though she be
unintelligent, yet Nature acts; as is the case with milk.

   <span id="pp_59a"></span>*a*. That is to say: as milk, without
reference to men's efforts, quite of itself changes into the form of
curd, so Nature, although she be unintelligent, changes into the form of
Mind, &c., even without the efforts of any other.

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

   <span id="pp_59b"></span>*b*. This is not rendered tautological by
this aphorism, 'As the cow for the calf,' \[[Book II., §
37](sak2.htm#pp_37)\]; because there the question was only of the
operation of *instruments*, and because cows *are* intelligent.

   <span id="pp_59c"></span>*c*. By means of the exhibition of another
illustration, he mentions the cause of the thing asserted as aforesaid:

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another illustration.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_60"></span>*Aph*. 60.[\*](#pp_60) Or as is the case with
the acts \[or on-goings\]—for we see them—of Time, &c.

   <span id="pp_60a"></span>*a*. Or as is the case with the acts \[or
on-goings,\] of Time, &c., the spontaneous action of Nature is proved
from what is seen. The action of Time, for example, takes place quite
spontaneously, in the shape of one season's now departing and another's
coming on: let the behaviour of Nature, also, be thus; for the
supposition conforms to observed facts: such is the meaning.

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

   <span id="pp_60b"></span>*b*. But, still, a senseless Nature would
never energize, or would energize the wrong way; because of there being
\[in her case,\] no such communing as, 'This is my means of producing
experience, &c.' To this he replies:

 

|                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature acts from habit.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_61"></span>*Aph*. 61.[\*](#pp_61) From her own nature
she acts, not from thought; like a servant.

   <span id="pp_61a"></span>*a*. That is to say: as, in the case of an
excellent servant, naturally, just from habit,<span
id="page_263_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_263_note_2) the appointed and
necessary service of the master is engaged in, and not with a view to
his own enjoyment, just so does Nature energize from habit alone.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Or through the influence of Desert.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_62"></span>*Aph*. 62.[\*](#pp_62) Or from attraction by
Deserts, which have been from eternity.

   <span id="pp_62a"></span>*a*. Here the word 'or' is for connecting
\[this aphorism with the preceding one\]. Since Desert has been from
eternity, therefore, moreover, through attraction by Deserts, the
energizing of Nature is necessary and rightly distributed: such is the
meaning.<span id="page_264_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_264_note_3)

   <span id="pp_62b"></span>*b*. It being thus settled, then, that
Nature is creative for the sake of another, he tells us, in the
following section,<span id="page_264_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_264_note_4)
that, on the completion of that other's purpose, Liberation takes place
through Nature's quite spontaneously ceasing to act:

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature desists when the end is gained.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_63"></span>*Aph*. 63.[\*](#pp_63) From discriminative
knowledge there is a cessation of Nature's creating; as is the case with
a cook, when the cooking has been performed.

   <span id="pp_63a"></span>*a*. When Soul's aim has been accomplished,
by means of indifference to all else, through discriminative knowledge
of Soul, Nature's creating ceases; as, when the cooking is completed,
the labour of the cook ceases: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_63b"></span>*b*. But, at that rate, since Nature's
creating ceases through the production of discriminative knowledge in
the case of a single Soul, we should find *all* liberated. To this he
replies:

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Liberation of one involves not that of all.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_64"></span>*Aph*. 64.[\*](#pp_64) Another remains like
another, through her fault.

   <span id="pp_64a"></span>*a*. But 'another,' i.e., one *devoid* of
discriminative knowledge, remains 'like another,' i.e., just like one
bound by <span id="page_266">p. 266</span> Nature. Why? 'Through her
fault,' i.e., through the fault which may be described as her not
accomplishing that soul's aim: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_64b"></span>*b*. He mentions the fruit of Nature's
ceasing to act:

 

|                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Liberation constists of what.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_65"></span>*Aph*. 65.[\*](#pp_65) \[The fruit of
Nature's ceasing to act\], the solitariness of both \[Nature and Soul\],
or \[which comes to the same thing,\] of either, is liberation.

   <span id="pp_65a"></span>*a*. 'Of both,' i.e., of Nature and Soul,
the 'solitariness,' i.e., the being alone, the mutual disjunction, in
short, this is liberation.

   <span id="pp_65b"></span>*b*. But then, how would Nature, having
attained indifference, through the mood in the shape of discrimination,
on the liberation of a single Soul, again engage in creation, for the
sake of another Soul? And you are not to say that this is no objection,
because Nature consists of different portions, \[it is not *another*
Nature, but the same\]; because we see, that, even out of the \[mortal\]
constituents of the <span id="page_267">p. 267</span> liberated person,
viz., his dust, &c., things are created for the experience of another.
To this he replies:

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

 

|                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How Nature affects one, and not the other.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_66"></span>*Aph*. 66.[\*](#pp_66) Moreover, \[when
Nature has left off distressing the emancipated,\] she does not desist,
in regard to her creative influence on another; as is the case with the
snake, \[which ceases to be a terror,\] in respect of him who is aware
of the truth in regard to the rope \[which another mistakes for a
snake\].<span id="page_267_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_267_note_5)

   <span id="pp_66a"></span>*a*. Nature, though, in respect of one Soul,
she have desisted, in consequence of discriminative knowledge, does not
desist as regards her creative influence on another Soul, but *does*
create in respect of *that* one; as the snake \[so to speak,\] does not
produce fear, &c., in the case of him who is aware of the truth in
regard to the rope, but *does* produce it, in respect of him who is
ignorant \[that what <span id="page_269">p. 269</span> he looks upon is
a rope, and not a snake\]: such is the meaning. And Nature is likened to
a snake, because of her disguising Soul, which is likened to a rope.
Certain unintelligent persons, calling themselves *Vedántís*, having
quite failed to understand that such is the drift of such examples as
those of the rope, the snake, &c., suppose that Nature is an absolute
nothing, or something merely imaginary. The matters of Scripture and of
the legal institutes are to be *elucidated* by means of this \[or that\]
example offered by the *Sánkhyas*, who assert the reality of Nature: it
is not the case that the matter is simply *established* to be as is the
example; \[the analogy of which is not to be overstrained, as if the
cases were parallel throughout\].

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

 

|                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another consideration why Nature should act.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_67"></span>*Aph*. 67.[\*](#pp_67) And from connexion
with Desert, which is the cause.

   <span id="pp_67a"></span>*a*. 'Desert,' which is the cause of
creation, in consequence of the conjunction of this, also, she creates,
for the sake of another Soul \[than the emancipated one\]: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_67b"></span>*b*. But then, since all Souls are alike
indifferent, inasmuch as they do not desire \[Nature's interference\],
what is it that here determines Nature to act only in regard to this
one, and to desist in regard to that one? And *Desert* is not the
determiner; because here, too, there is nothing to determine of which
Soul what is the Desert; \[Desert being inferrible only from, and,
therefore, not cognizable antecendently to, its *fruits*\]. To this he
replies:

 

|                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature's selection how determined.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_68"></span>*Aph*. 68.[\*](#pp_68) Though there is \[on
Soul's part, this\] indifference, yet want of discrimination is the
cause of Nature's service.

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

   <span id="pp_68a"></span>*a*. That is to say: although Souls *are*
indifferent, yet Nature, just through \[her own\] non-discrimination,
saying, 'This is my master,' 'This is I myself,' serves Souls, \[towards
their eventual emancipation\], by creation, &c. And so, to what Soul,
not having discriminated herself \[therefrom\], she has the habit<span
id="page_271_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_271_note_1) of showing herself, in
respect just of that one does Nature energize; and this it is that
determines her: such is the import.

   <span id="pp_68b"></span>*b*. Since it is her *nature* to energize,
how can she desist, even when discrimination has taken place? To this he
replies:

 

|                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature energizes only till the end is attained.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_69"></span>*Aph*. 69.[\*](#pp_69) Like a dancer does
she, though she had been energizing, desist; because of the end's having
been attained.

   <span id="pp_69a"></span>*a*. Nature's disposition to energize is
only for the sake of Soul, and not universally. Therefore is it fitting
that <span id="page_272">p. 272</span> Nature should desist, though she
has been energizing, when the end has been attained, in the shape of the
effectuation of Soul's aim; as a dancer, who has been performing, with
the view of exhibiting a dance to the spectators, desists, on the
accomplishment of this: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_69b"></span>*b*. He states another reason for the
cessation:

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This illustrated.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_70"></span>*Aph*. 70.[\*](#pp_70) Moreover, when her
fault is known, Nature does not approach \[Soul\]; like a woman of good
family.

   <span id="pp_70a"></span>*a*. That is to say: Nature, moreover,
ashamed at Soul's having seen her fault,—in her transformations, and her
taking the shape of pain, &c.,—does not again approach Soul; 'like a
woman of good family;' i.e., as a \[frail\] woman of good family,
ashamed at ascertaining that her fault <span id="page_273">p. 273</span>
has been seen by her husband, does not approach her husband.<span
id="page_273_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_273_note_2)

   <span id="pp_70b"></span>*b*. But then, if Nature's energizing be for
the sake of Soul, Soul must be *altered* by Bondage and Liberation,
\[and not remain the unalterable entity which you allege it to be\]. To
this he replies:

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul's relation to Bondage.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_71"></span>*Aph*. 71.[\*](#pp_71) Bondage and Liberation
do not actually belong to Soul, \[and would not even appear to do so,\]
but for non-discrimination.

   <span id="pp_71a"></span>*a*. Bondage and Liberation, consisting in
the conjunction of Pain, and its disjunction, do not 'actually,' i.e.,
really, belong to Soul; but, in the way mentioned in the fourth
aphorism, they result only from non-discrimination: such is the meaning.

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

   <span id="pp_71b"></span>*b*. But, in reality, Bondage and
Liberation, as declared, belong to Nature alone: so he asserts:

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Bondage is really Nature's.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_72"></span>*Aph*. 72.[\*](#pp_72) They really belong to
Nature, through consociation; like a beast.

   <span id="pp_72a"></span>*a*. Bondage and Liberation, through Pain,
really belong to Nature,<span
id="page_274_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_274_note_2) 'through consociation,'
i.e., through her being hampered by the habits, &c., which are the
causes of Pain; as a beast, through its being hampered by a rope,
experiences Bondage and Liberation: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_72b"></span>*b*. Here, by what causes is there Bondage?
Or by what is there Liberation? To this he replies:

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How Nature binds and liberates herself.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_73"></span>*Aph*. 73.[\*](#pp_73) In seven ways does
Nature bind herself; like the silk-worm: in one way does she liberate
herself.

   <span id="pp_73a"></span>*a*. By Merit, Dispassion, Supernatural
Power, Demerit, Ignorance, Non-dispassion, and Want of Power, viz., by
habits, causes of Pain, in the shape of these seven, 'does Nature bind
herself' with Pain; 'like the silk-worm;' i.e., as the worm that makes
the cocoon binds itself by means of the dwelling which itself
constructs. And that same Nature liberates herself from Pain 'in one
way,' i.e., by Knowledge alone: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_73b"></span>*b*. But then, that which you assert, viz.,
that Bondage and Liberation result from Non-discrimination alone, is
improper; because Non-discrimination can neither be <span
id="page_276">p. 276</span> quitted nor assumed, and because, in the
world, Pain, and its negative, Pleasure, &c., can, themselves, be
neither quitted nor assumed: otherwise, \[if you still insist on
retaining the opinion objected to\], there is disparagement of
sense-evidence. Having pondered this, he himself \[not leaving it to a
commentator,\] explains what was asserted in the fourth aphorism:

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An objection met.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_74"></span>*Aph*. 74.[\*](#pp_74) Non-discrimination is
the cause \[not the thing itself\]; \[so that\] there is no
disparagement of sense-evidence.

   <span id="pp_74a"></span>*a*. What was asserted before was this, that
Non-discrimination is only the *occasion* of Bondage and Liberation in
souls, and not that Non-discrimination itself is these two; therefore
'there is no disparagement of sense-evidence;' \[for, though we see that
Pain and Pleasure cannot be directly assumed or quitted, yet we also see
that causes of them *can* be assumed or quitted\]: such is the meaning.

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

   <span id="pp_74b"></span>*b*. He mentions, among the means conducive
to Discrimination, Study, which is the essence of them:

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Means of Discrimination.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_75"></span>*Aph*. 75.[\*](#pp_75) Discrimination is
perfected through abandonment \[of everything\], expressed by a 'No,
No,' through study of the \[twenty-five\] Principles.

   <span id="pp_75a"></span>*a*. Discrimination is effected through
study of the Principles, in the shape of abandoning, by a 'No, No,' in
regard to things unintelligent, ending with Nature, the conceit \[that
Nature, or any of her products, is Soul\]. All the others \[enumerated
in the list of means\] are only supplemental to Study: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_75b"></span>*b*. He states a speciality in regard to the
perfecting of Discrimination:

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The means not efficacious everywhere.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_76"></span>*Aph*. 76.[\*](#pp_76) Through the difference
of those competent \[to engage in the matter at all\], there is no
necessity \[that each and every one should at once be successful\].

   <span id="pp_76a"></span>*a*. Since there is a division, among those
competent, into the sluggish, &c., though study be made, there is no
certainty that, in this very birth, Discrimination will be accomplished:
such is the meaning. Therefore, every one should, by strenuousness in
study, acquire for himself the *highest* degree of competency: such is
the import.

   <span id="pp_76b"></span>*b*. He states that Liberation takes place
solely through the effecting of Discrimination, and not otherwise:

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Imperfect Discrimination inefficacious.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_77"></span>*Aph*. 77.[\*](#pp_77) Since what \[Pain\]
has been repelled returns again, there comes, even from medium \[but
imperfect,\] Discrimination, experience, \[which it is desired to get
entirely rid of\].

   <span id="pp_77a"></span>*a*. But sluggish Discrimination \[lower
even than the <span id="page_279">p. 279</span> middling variety\],
antecedently to direct intuition, consists only of Hearing, Pondering,
and Meditating: such is the division \[of Discrimination\].

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Of Liberation during life.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_78"></span>*Aph*. 78.[\*](#pp_78) And he who, living, is
liberated.

   <span id="pp_78a"></span>*a*. That is to say: he, also, who, while
living, is liberated is just in the condition of medium Discrimination.

   <span id="pp_78b"></span>*b*. He adduces evidence for there being
some one liberated, though still living:

 

|                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Proof that this may be.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_79"></span>*Aph*. 79.[\*](#pp_79) It is proved by the
fact of instructed and instructor.

   <span id="pp_79a"></span>*a*. That is to say: it is proved that there
are such as are liberated during life, by the mention, in the
Institutes, on the subject of Discrimination, of the relation of
preceptor <span id="page_280">p. 280</span> and pupil; i.e., because it
is only one liberated during life that can be an instructor \[in this
matter\].

 

|                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Further proof.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_80"></span>*Aph*. 80.[\*](#pp_80) And there is
Scripture.<span id="page_280_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_280_note_2)

   <span id="pp_80a"></span>*a*. There is also Scripture for there being
persons liberated during life.

   <span id="pp_80b"></span>*b*. But then, merely through hearing, too,
one might become \[qualified to be\] an instructor. To this he replies:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A suggestion repelled.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_81"></span>*Aph*. 81.[\*](#pp_81) \[And not through
merely hearing is one qualified to become an instructor\]: otherwise,
there were blind tradition.

   <span id="pp_81a"></span>*a*. That is to say: otherwise, since even a
person of sluggish Discrimination \[but who, yet, had *heard*,\] would
be an instructor, we should have a blind handing down \[of doctrines
which would speedily become corrupted or lost\].

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

   <span id="pp_81b"></span>*b*. But then, when, through Knowledge,
one's works \[which are the cause of mundane existence,\] have perished
how can there \[still\] be life? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How life is compatible with Liberation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_82"></span>*Aph*. 82.[\*](#pp_82) Possessed of a body,
\[the emancipated sage goes on living\]; like the whirling of a wheel.

   <span id="pp_82a"></span>*a*. Even on the cessation of the action of
the potter, the wheel, of itself, revolves for some time, in consequence
of the motal inertia resulting from the previous action. So, after
knowledge, though actions do not arise, yet, through the
\[self-continuant\] action of antecedent acts, possessing an energizing
body, he remains living, yet liberated;<span
id="page_281_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_281_note_2) \[and, if he did not,
but if every one who gained true knowledge were, on gaining it, to
disappear, true knowledge would cease to be handed down orally; and
Kapila, probably, did not contemplate books, or did not think these a
secure depository of the doctrine\]: such is the meaning.

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

   <span id="pp_82b"></span>*b*. But then, since the continuance<span
id="page_282_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_282_note_1) of experience, &c., is
put an end to by that 'Meditation with distinct recognition of the
object,' which \[see *Yoga Aphorisms*, Book I., § 17,<span
id="page_282_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_282_note_2)\] is the cause of
knowledge, how can one retain a body? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Difficulty of shuffling off this mortal coil.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_83"></span>*Aph*. 83.[\*](#pp_83) This \[retention of a
body\] is occasioned by the least vestige of impression.

   <span id="pp_83a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the retention of a body
is caused by even the least remains of those impressions<span
id="page_282_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_282_note_4) of objects which are the
causes of having a body.

   <span id="pp_83b"></span>*b*. He recapitulates the sense of the
declarations of the Institute:

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

 

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Recapitulation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_84"></span>*Aph*. 84.[\*](#pp_84) That which was to be
done has been done, when entire Cessation of Pain has resulted from
Discrimination; not otherwise, not otherwise.

   <span id="pp_84a"></span>*a*. So much for the Third Book, on
Dispassion.

<span id="footnotes_page_253">p. 253</span>

<span id="page_253_note_3"></span>[3](#page_253_fr_3) It here follows,

<span id="footnotes_page_267">p. 267</span>

<span id="page_267_note_5"></span>[5](#page_267_fr_5) Of this Aphorism,
and of the comment on it, MSS. of Vijnána's treatise afford a much
better text than that here reprinted. In one of its more approved forms,
that which Vijnána seems to elect, the original enunciation runs thus:
'Furthermore, she \[Nature,\] does not give over effecting creation,
with reference to another, \[i.e., another soul than that of the
spiritual sage, though she creates for such a sage no longer; and she
acts, in so doing,\] analogously to a snake, with reference to him who
is unenlightened as to the real <span id="footnotes_page_268">p.
268</span> character of the rope' \[which is mistaken for it; this
illusory snake keeping him constantly in a state of alarm, though it
ceases to affect him who has discovered that it is nothing more
formidable than a yard or two of twisted hemp\]. More closely, so far as
regards the construction of the original: 'Furthermore, in like manner
as a snake goes on influencing him who . . . . . \[Nature persists\] in
effecting creation.' &c.

That *uparága*, as embodied in the expression *sṛishṭyuparága*,
signifies 'causing,' 'effecting,' in the view of both Aniruddha and
Vedánti Mahádeva, who define it by *karaṇa*.

The Aphorism in question, mainly as just exhibited, together with
preferable deviations from the comment as given by Dr. Ballantyne, will
be found at p. 13 of the variants appended to my edition of the
*Sánkkya-pravachana-bháshya*. *Ed*.

<span id="page_274_note_2"></span>[2](#page_274_fr_2) Read: 'Bondage and
Liberation belong to Nature alone; because to it, in truth, belongs
misery.' *Ed*.

<span id="footnotes_page_280">p. 280</span>

<span id="page_280_note_2"></span>[2](#page_280_fr_2) None of the
commentators but Vijnána recognizes an Aphorism in these words; and it
is very doubtful whether even he does so. *Ed*.

<span id="page_282_note_2"></span>[2](#page_282_fr_2) Which here
follows, with Dr. Ballantyne's translation: '\[Meditation, of the kind
called\] that in which there is distinct recognition \[arises, in its
fourfold shape,\] from the attendance of (1) argumentation (*vitarka*).
(2) deliberation (*vichára*), (3) beatitude (*ánanda*), and (4) egotism
