<p>"Bhishma said, 'That subjugator of hostile cities, Sikhandin, the son of the king of the Panchalas, is, O king, in my judgment, one of the foremost of Yudhishthira's <i>Rathas</i>. Having divested himself on his former</p>

<p>sex, he will fight in battle and earn great fame, O Bharata, among thy troops! He hath a large number of troops,--Panchalas and Prabhadrakas,--to support him. With those hosts of cars he will achieve great feats. Dhrishtadyumna also, O Bharata, the leader of all Yudhishthira's army, that mighty car-warrior who is also a disciple of Drona, is, O king, in my judgment, an <i>Atiratha</i>. Afflicting all foes in battle, he will singly sweep the field, like <i>Pinaka</i>,--bearing God himself in rage on the occasion of the universal dissolution. Even great warriors will speak of his car-divisions, so multitudinous are they, as resembling the very ocean or that of the gods, in battle! Kshattradharman, the son of Dhrishtadyumna, owing to his immature years, as also in consequence of his want of exercise in arms, is, in my judgment, O king, only half a <i>Ratha</i>. That relative of the Pandavas, the mighty bowman Dhrishtaketu, the heroic son of Sisupala, the king of the Chedis, is a <i>Maharatha</i>. That brave ruler of the Chedis will, O king, with his son, achieve feats such as are difficult for even a <i>Maharatha</i>. Kshattradeva, that subjugator of hostile cities, who is devoted to Kshatriya virtues, is, O great king, in my judgment, one of the best Rathas among the Pandavas. Those brave warriors among the Panchalas, <i>viz</i>., Jayanta and Amitaujas and the great car-warrior Satyajit are all, O king, high-souled Maharathas. They will all, O sire, fight in battle like furious elephants. Aja and Bhoja, both endued with great prowess, are both Maharathas. Possessed of great might, those two heroes will fight for the Pandavas. Both of them are endued with great lightness of hand in the use of weapons. Both of them are conversant with all the modes of warfare, both are well-skilled and possessed of firm prowess. The five Kshatriya brothers, O king, who are difficult of being vanquished, and all of whom have blood red banners, are foremost of the Rathas. Kasika, and Sukumara, and Nila, and that other one, <i>viz</i>., Suryadatta, and Sankha, otherwise called Madiraswa, are all in my judgment, the foremost of Rathas. Possessed of every qualification that renders them fit for battle, they are acquainted with all weapons, and all of them are endued with high souls. Vardhakshemi, O king, is in my judgment, a Maharatha. King Chitrayudha is, in my judgment, one of the best of Rathas. He is, besides, an asset in battle and devotedly attached to the diadem-decked (Arjuna). Those mighty car-warriors, those tigers among men, Chekitana, and Satyadhriti, are two of the best Rathas of the Pandavas in my judgment. Vyaghradatta, O monarch, and Chandrasena also, O Bharata, are without doubt two of the best Rathas, as I think, of the Pandavas. Senavindu, O king, otherwise called Krodhahantri by name, who, O lord, is regarded as equal of Vasudeva and of Bhimasena, will contend with great prowess in battle against your warriors. Indeed, that best of kings, ever boasting of his feats in battle, should be regarded by thee, precisely as myself, Drona and Kripa are regarded by thee! That best of men, worthy of praise, <i>viz</i>., Kasya, is endued with great lightness of hand in the use of weapons. Indeed, that subjugator of hostile cities is known to me as equal to one</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_333"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 333</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Ratha. Drupada's son, Satyajit, young in years and displaying great prowess in battle, should be regarded as equal to eight Rathas. Indeed being Dhrishtadyumna's equal, he is an <i>Atiratha</i>. Desirous of spreading the fame of the Pandavas, he will achieve great feats. Devoted to the Pandavas and endued with great bravery, there is another great Ratha of the Pandavas, <i>viz</i>., king Pandya, that bowman of mighty energy. The mighty bowman Dhridadhanwan is another <i>Maharatha</i> of the Pandavas. O subjugator of hostile cities, that foremost of Kurus, <i>viz</i>., Srenimat and king Vasudeva are both, in my judgment, <i>Atirathas</i>.'"</p>
