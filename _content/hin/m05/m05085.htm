<p>"Vaisampayana said, 'Meanwhile, understanding from his spies that the slayer of Madhu had set out, Dhritarashtra, with his hair standing erect, respectfully addressing the mighty-armed Bhishma and Dorna and Sanjaya and the illustrious Vidura, said these words unto Duryodhana and his counsellors, 'O scion of Kuru's race, strange and wonderful is the news that we hear. Men, women and children, are talking of it. Others are <A HREF="errata.htm#84">speaking</A> of it respectfully, and others again assembled together. Within houses where men <A HREF="errata.htm#85">congregate</A> and in open spots, people and discussing it. All say that Dasarha of great prowess will come hither for the sake of Pandavas. The slayer of Madhu is, by all means, deserving of honour and worship at our hands. He is the Lord of all creatures, and on him resteth the course of every thing in the universe. Indeed, intelligence and prowess and wisdom and energy, all reside in Madhava. Worthy of honour at the hands of all righteous persons he is the foremost of all men, and is, indeed, eternal Virtue. If worshipped he is sure</p>

<p>to bestow happiness; and if not worshipped fie is sure to inflict misery. If that smiter of foes, Dasarha be gratified with our offerings, all our wishes may be obtained by us, through his grace, in the midst of the kings. O chastiser of foes, make without loss of time every arrangement for his reception. Let pavilions be set up on the road, furnished with every object of enjoyment. O mighty-armed son of Gandhari, make such arrangements that he may be gratified with thee. What doth Bhishma think in this matter?' At this, Bhishma and others, all applauding those words of king Dhritarashtra, said,--'Excellent.' King Duryodhana then, understanding their wishes, ordered delightful sites to be chosen for the erection of pavilions. Many pavilions were thereupon constructed abounding with gems of every kind, at proper intervals and at delightful spots. And the king sent thither handsome seats endued with excellent qualities, beautiful girls, and scents and ornaments, and fine robes, and excellent viands, and drink of diverse qualities, and fragrant garlands of many kinds. And the king of the Kurus took especial care to erect, for the reception of Krishna, a highly beautiful pavilion at Vrikasthala, full of precious gems. And having made all these arrangements that were god-like and much above the capacity of human beings, king Duryodhana informed Dhritarashtra of the same. Kesava, however, of Dasarha's race, arrived at the capital of the Kurus, without casting a single glance at all those pavilions and all those gems of diverse kinds.'"</p>
