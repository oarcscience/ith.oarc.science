<p>"Narada said, 'Seeing Galava, Vinata's son smilingly addressed him, saying, 'By good luck it is, O Brahmana, that I behold thee successful.' Galava, however, hearing the words spoken by Garuda informed him that a fourth part of the task was still un-finished.' Garuda then, that foremost of all speakers, said unto Galava, 'Do not make any <A HREF="errata.htm#94">endeavour</A> (to obtain the remaining two hundred), for it will not succeed. In days of yore, Richika sought at Kanyakuyja Gadhi's daughter, Satyavati, for making her his wife.' Thereupon Gadhi, O Galava, addressing the Rishi, said, 'O holy one, let a thousand steeds of lunar brightness, each with one ear black of hue, be presented to me.' Thus requested, Richika said, 'So be it'. And then wending his way to the great mart of steeds (<i>Aswatirtha</i>) in Varuna's abode, the Rishi obtained what he sought and gave them unto the king. Performing a sacrifice then of the name of <i>Pundarika</i>, that monarch gave away those steeds (as <i>Dakshina</i>) unto the Brahmanas. The three kings to whom thou hadst applied had purchased those horses from the Brahmanas, each to the number of two hundred. The remaining four hundred, O best of Brahmanas, while being transported over the river, were taken by the <i>Vitasta</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>Therefore, O Galava,</p>

<p><A NAME="page_232"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 232</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thou canst never have that which is not to be had. Do thou then, O virtuous one, present unto Viswamitra this maiden as an equivalent for two hundred steeds, along with the six hundred thou hast already obtained. Thou wilt then, O best of Brahmanas, be freed from thy grief and crowned with success. Galava then, saying, 'So be it,' and taking with him both the maiden and the steeds, went with Garuda in his company unto Viswamitra. And arrived in his presence, Galava said, 'Here are six hundred steeds of the kind demanded by thee. And this maiden is offered as an equivalent for the remaining two hundred. Let all these be accepted by thee. Upon this maiden have been begotten three virtuous sons by three royal sages. Let a fourth, foremost of all, be begotten upon her by thee. And thus let the number of steeds, eight hundred, be regarded by thee as full, and let me also, being freed from thy debt, go and practise ascetic penances as I list.' Viswamitra then, beholding Galava in the company of the bird, and that highly beautiful maiden, said, 'Why, O Galava, didst thou not give me this maiden before? Four sons then, sanctifiers of my race, would all have been mine alone. I accept this maiden of thine for begetting upon her one son. As regards the steeds, let them graze in my asylum.' Saying this, Viswamitra of great effulgence began to pass his time happily with her, And Madhavi bore him a son of the name of Ashtaka. And as soon as that son was born, the great Muni Viswamitra addressed him to both virtue and profit, and gave him those six hundred steeds. Ashtaka then went to a city, bright as the city of Soma. And Kusika's son Viswamitra also having made over the damsel to his disciple, himself went into the Woods. And Galava also, with his friend Suparna, having in this way <A HREF="errata.htm#95">succeeded</A> in giving his preceptor the fee he had demanded, with a cheerful heart addressed that maiden and said, 'Thou hast borne a son who is exceedingly charitable, and another who is exceedingly brave, and a third who is devoted to truth and righteousness, and yet another who is a performer of great sacrifices. O beautiful maiden, thou hast, by these sons, saved not only thy father, but four kings and myself, also. Go now, O thou of <A HREF="errata.htm#96">slender waist</A>.' Saying this, Galava dismissed Garuda that devourer of snakes, and returning the maiden unto her father himself went into the woods.'"</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_16"></A><A HREF="m05119.htm#fr_16">231:1</A> The latter half of this Sloka is variously read. The correct reading, I apprehend, is Niyamanani Santare Hritanyasan Vitastaya, <i>i.e.</i>, 'while transported across, were taken (down) by the (river) Vitasta'--the latter being one of the five rivers of the Punjab.</P>
