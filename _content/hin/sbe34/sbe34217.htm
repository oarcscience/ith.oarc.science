<p>41. And (there would follow from that doctrine) either finite duration or absence of omniscience (on the Lord's part).</p> 
<p>The hypothesis of the argumentative philosophers is invalid, for the following reason also.--They teach that the Lord is omniscient and of infinite duration, and likewise that the pradh&acirc;na, as well as the individual souls, is of infinite duration. Now, the omniscient Lord either defines the measure of the pradh&acirc;na, the souls, and himself, or does not define it. Both alternatives subvert the doctrine under discussion. For, on the former alternative, the pradh&acirc;na, the souls, and the Lord, being all of them of definite measure, must necessarily be of finite duration; since ordinary experience teaches that all things of definite extent, such as jars and the like, at some time cease to exist. The numerical measure of pradh&acirc;na, souls, and Lord is</p> 
<p><A NAME="page_439"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 439</FONT></A></p> 
<p>defined by their constituting a triad, and the individual measure of each of them must likewise be considered as defined by the Lord (because he is omniscient). The number of the souls is a high one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_422"></A><A HREF="#fn_422"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. From among this limited number of souls some obtain release from the sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra, that means their sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra comes to an end, and their subjection to the sams&acirc;ra comes to an end. Gradually all souls obtain release, and so there will finally be an end of the entire sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra and the sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra state of all souls. But the pradh&acirc;na which is ruled by the Lord and which modifies itself for the purposes of the soul is what is meant by sa<i>m</i>s&acirc;ra. Hence, when the latter no longer exists, nothing is left for the Lord to rule, and his omniscience and ruling power have no longer any objects. But if the pradh&acirc;na, the souls, and the Lord, all have an end, it follows that they also have a beginning, and if they have a beginning as well as an end, we are driven to the doctrine of a general void.--Let us then, in order to avoid these untoward conclusions, maintain the second alternative, i.e. that the measure of the Lord himself, the pradh&acirc;na, and the souls, is not defined by the Lord.--But that also is impossible, because it would compel us to abandon a tenet granted at the outset, viz. that the Lord is omniscient.</p> 
<p>For all these reasons the doctrine of the argumentative philosophers, according to which the Lord is the operative cause of the world, appears unacceptable.</p>
