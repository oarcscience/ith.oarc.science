*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3\. Not (i.e. the abode of heaven, earth, &c. cannot be) that which is
inferred, (i.e. the pradhâna), on account of the terms not denoting it.

While there has been shown a special reason in favour of Brahman (being
the abode), there is no such special reason in favour of anything else.
Hence he (the sûtrakâra) says that that which is inferred, i.e. the
pradhâna assumed by the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sm*ri*ti, is not to be accepted
as the abode of heaven, earth, &c.--Why?--On account of the terms not
denoting it. For the sacred text does not contain any term intimating
the non-intelligent pradhâna, on the ground of which we might understand
the latter to be the general cause or abode; while such terms as 'he who
perceives all and knows all' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9) intimate an intelligent
being opposed to the pradhâna in nature.--For the same reason the air
also cannot be accepted as the abode of heaven, earth, and so on.
