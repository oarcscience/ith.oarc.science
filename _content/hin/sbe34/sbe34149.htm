<p>10. And because the objections (raised by the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya against the Ved&acirc;nta doctrine) apply to his view also.</p> 
<p>The doctrine of our opponent is liable to the very same objections which he urges against us, viz. in the following manner.--The objection that this world cannot have sprung from Brahman on account of its difference of character applies no less to the doctrine of the pradh&acirc;na being the cause of the world; for that doctrine also assumes that from a pradh&acirc;na devoid of sound and other qualities a world is produced which possesses those very qualities. The beginning of an effect different in character being thus admitted, the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya is equally driven to the doctrine that before the actual beginning the effect was non-existent. And, moreover, it being admitted (by the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya also) that at the time of reabsorption the effect passes back into the state of non-distinction from the cause, the case of the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya here also is the same as ours.--And, further, if</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (as the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya also must admit) at the time of reabsorption the differences of all the special effects are obliterated and pass into a state of general non-distinction, the special fixed conditions, which previous to reabsorption were the causes of the different worldly existence of each soul, can, at the time of a new creation, no longer be determined, there being no cause for them; and if you assume them to be determined without a cause, you are driven to the admission that even the released souls have to re-enter a state of bondage, there being equal absence of a cause (in the case of the released and the non-released souls). And if you try to avoid this conclusion by assuming that at the time of reabsorption some individual differences pass into the state of non-distinction, others not, we reply that in that case the latter could not be considered as effects of the pradh&acirc;na&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.--It thus appears that all those difficulties (raised by the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya) apply to both views, and cannot therefore be urged against either only. But as either of the two doctrines must necessarily be accepted, we are strengthened-&#151;by the outcome of the above discussion--in the opinion that the alleged difficulties are no real difficulties&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>
