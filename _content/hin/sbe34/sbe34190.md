14\. And on account of the permanent existence (of activity or
non-activity).

Moreover, the atoms would have to be assumed as either

essentially active (moving) or essentially non-active, or both or
neither; there being no fifth alternative. But none of the four
alternatives stated is possible. If they were essentially active, their
activity would be permanent so that no pralaya could take place. If they
were essentially non-active, their non-activity would be permanent, and
no creation could take place. Their being both is impossible because
self-contradictory. If they were neither, their activity and
non-activity would have to depend on an operative cause, and then the
operative causes such as the ad*ri*sh*t*a being in permanent proximity
to the atoms, permanent activity would result; or else the ad*ri*sh*t*a
and so on not being taken as operative causes, the consequence would be
permanent non-activity on the part of the atoms.--For this reason also
the atomic doctrine is untenable.
