<p>7. And if you say (that the soul may move the pradh&acirc;na) as the (lame) man (moves the blind one) or as the magnet (moves the iron); thus also (the difficulty is not overcome).</p> 
<p>Well then--the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya resumes, endeavouring to defend his position by parallel instances--let us say that, as some lame man devoid of the power of motion, but possessing the power of sight, having mounted the back of a blind man who is able to move but not to see, makes the latter move; or as the magnet not moving itself, moves the iron, so the soul moves the pradh&acirc;na.--Thus also, we reply, you do not free your doctrine from all shortcomings; for this your new position involves an abandonment of your old</p>

<p>position, according to which the pradh&acirc;na is moving of itself, and the (indifferent, inactive) soul possesses no moving power. And how should the indifferent soul move the pradh&acirc;na? A man, although lame, may make a blind man move by means of words and the like; but the soul which is devoid of action and qualities cannot possibly put forth any moving energy. Nor can it be said that it moves the pradh&acirc;na by its mere proximity as the magnet moves the iron; for from the permanency of proximity (of soul and pradh&acirc;na) a permanency of motion would follow. The proximity of the magnet, on the other hand (to the iron), is not permanent, but depends on a certain activity and the adjustment of the magnet in a certain position; hence the (lame) man and the magnet do not supply really parallel instances.--The pradh&acirc;na then being non-intelligent and the soul indifferent, and there being no third principle to connect them, there can be no connexion of the two. If we attempted to establish a connexion on the ground of capability (of being seen on the part of the pradh&acirc;na, of seeing on the part of the soul), the permanency of such capability would imply the impossibility of final release.--Moreover, here as well as before (in the preceding S&ucirc;tra) the different alternatives connected with the absence of purpose (on the pradh&acirc;na's part) have to be considered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.--The highest Self, on the other hand (which is the cause of the world, according to the Ved&acirc;ntins), is characterised by non-activity inherent in its own nature, and, at the same time, by moving power inherent in M&acirc;y&acirc; and is thus superior (to the soul of the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khyas).</p>
