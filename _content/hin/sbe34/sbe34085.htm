<p>And also on account of the 'supporting' the small ether can be the highest Lord only.--How?--The text at first introduces the general subject of discussion in the passage, 'In it is that small ether;' declares thereupon that the small one is to be compared with the universal ether, and that everything is contained in it; subsequently applies to it the term 'Self,' and states it to possess the qualities of being free from sin, &amp;c.; and, finally, declares with reference to the same general subject of discussion, 'That Self is a bank, a limitary support (vidh<i>ri</i>ti), that these worlds may not be confounded.'

Up. IV, 4, 12)--Hence, on account of the 'supporting,' also the small (ether) is nothing else but the highest Lord.</p>
