15\. Moreover (the ânandamaya is Brahman because)

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

the same (Brahman) which had been referred to in the mantra is sung,
(i.e. proclaimed in the Brâhma*n*a passage as the ânandamaya.)

The Self, consisting of joy, is the highest Brahman for the following
reason also <span id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111). On the introductory
words 'he who knows Brahman attains the highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1),
there follows a mantra proclaiming that Brahman, which forms the general
topic of the chapter, possesses the qualities of true existence,
intelligence, infinity; after that it is said that from Brahman there
sprang at first the ether and then all other moving and non-moving
things, and that, entering into the beings which it had emitted, Brahman
stays in the recess, inmost of all; thereupon, for its better
comprehension, the series of the different Selfs ('different from this
is the inner Self,' &c.) are enumerated, and then finally the same
Brahman which the mantra had proclaimed, is again proclaimed in the
passage under discussion, 'different from this is the other inner Self,
which consists of bliss.' To assume that a mantra and the Brâhma*n*a
passage belonging to it have the same sense is only proper, on account
of the absence of contradiction (which results therefrom); for otherwise
we should be driven to the unwelcome inference that the text drops the
topic once started, and turns to an altogether new subject.

Nor is there mentioned a further inner Self different from the Self
consisting of bliss, as in the case of the Self consisting of food,
&c. <span id="fr_112"></span>[2](#fn_112) On the same (i.e. the Self
consisting of bliss) is founded, 'This same knowledge of Bh*ri*gu and
Varu*n*a; he understood that bliss is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 6).
Therefore the Self consisting of bliss is the highest Self.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_111"></span>[68:1](sbe34021.htm#fr_111) The previous proofs
were founded on li<u>n</u>ga; the argument which is now propounded is
founded on prakara*n*a.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[68:2](sbe34021.htm#fr_112) While, in the case
of the Selfs consisting of food and so on, a further inner Self is duly
mentioned each time. It cannot, therefore, be concluded that the Selfs
consisting of food, &c., are likewise identical with the highest Self
referred to in the mantra.
