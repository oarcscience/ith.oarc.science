*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

36\. And on account of the permanency of the final (size of the soul)
and the resulting permanency of the two (preceding sizes) there is no
difference (of size, at any time).

Moreover, the *G*ainas themselves admit the permanency of the final size
of the soul which it has in the state of release. From this it follows
also that its initial size and its intervening sizes must be permanent

there is no difference between the three sizes. But this would involve
the conclusion that the different bodies of the soul have one and the
same size, and that the soul cannot enter into bigger and smaller
bodies.--Or else (to explain the Sûtra in a somewhat different way) from
the fact that the final size of the soul is permanent, it follows that
its size in the two previous conditions also is permanent. Hence the
soul must be considered as being always of the same size--whether minute
or infinite--and not of the varying size of its bodies.--For this reason
also the doctrine of the Arhat has to be set aside as not in any way
more rational than the doctrine of Buddha.

being that the initial and intervening sizes of the soul must be
permanent because they are sizes of the soul, like its final size.
