17\. And on account of the declaration of the difference (of the two,
the ânandamaya cannot be the transmigrating soul).

The Self consisting of bliss cannot be identical with the transmigrating
soul, for that reason also that in the section treating of the Self of
bliss, the individual soul and the Self of bliss are distinctly
represented as different; Taitt. Up. II, 7, 'It (i.e. the Self
consisting of bliss) is a flavour; for only after perceiving a flavour
can this (soul) perceive bliss.' For he who perceives cannot be that
which is perceived.--But, it may be asked, if he who perceives or
attains cannot be that which is perceived or attained, how about the
following *S*ruti- and Sm*ri*ti-passages, 'The Self is to be sought;'
'Nothing higher is known than the attainment of the Self <span
id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113)?'--This objection, we reply, is
legitimate (from the point of view of absolute truth). Yet we see that
in ordinary life, the Self, which in reality is never anything

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

but the Self, is, owing to non-comprehension of the truth, identified
with the Non-Self, i.e. the body and so on; whereby it becomes possible
to speak of the Self in so far as it is identified with the body, and so
on, as something not searched for but to be searched for, not heard but
to be heard, not seized but to be seized, not perceived but to be
perceived, not known but to be known, and the like. Scripture, on the
other hand, denies, in such passages as 'there is no other seer but he'
(B*ri*. Up. III, 7, 23), that there is in reality any seer or hearer
different from the all-knowing highest Lord. (Nor can it be said that
the Lord is unreal because he is identical with the unreal individual
soul; for) <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114) the Lord differs from
the soul (vi*gñ*ânâtman) which is embodied, acts and enjoys, and is the
product of Nescience, in the same way as the real juggler who stands on
the ground differs from the illusive juggler, who, holding in his hand a
shield and a sword, climbs up to the sky by means of a rope; or as the
free unlimited ether differs from the ether of a jar, which is
determined by its limiting adjunct, (viz. the jar.) With reference to
this fictitious difference of the highest Self and the individual Self,
the two last Sûtras have been propounded.
