*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

31\. On the ground of imaginative identification (the highest Lord may
be called prâde*s*amâtra), *G*aimini thinks; for thus (Scripture)
declares.

Or else the passage about him who is measured by a span may be
considered to rest on imaginative combination.--Why?--Because the
passage of the Vâ*g*asaneyi-brâhma*n*a

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

which treats of the same topic identifies heaven, earth, and so
on--which are the members of Vai*s*vânara viewed as the Self of the
threefold world--with certain parts of the human frame, viz. the parts
comprised between the upper part of the head and the chin, and thus
declares the imaginative identity of Vai*s*vânara with something whose
measure is a span. There we read, 'The Gods indeed reached him, knowing
him as measured by a span as it were. Now I will declare them (his
members) to you so as to identify him (the Vai*s*vânara) with that whose
measure is a span; thus he said. Pointing to the upper part of the head
he said: This is what stands above (i.e. the heavenly world) as
Vai*s*vânara (i.e. the head of Vai*s*vânara <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166)). Pointing to the eyes he said: This is
he with good light (i.e. the sun) as Vai*s*vânara (i.e. the eye of V.).
Pointing to the nose he said: This is he who moves on manifold paths
(i.e. the air) as Vai*s*vânara (i.e. the breath of V.). Pointing to the
space (ether) within his mouth he said: This is the full one (i.e. the
ether) as Vai*s*vânara. Pointing to the saliva within his mouth he said:
This is wealth as Vai*s*vânara (i.e. the water in the bladder of V.).
Pointing to the chin he said: This is the base as Vai*s*vânara (i.e. the
feet of V.).'--Although in the Vâ*g*asaneyi-brâhma*n*a the heaven is
denoted as that which has the attribute of standing above and the sun as
that which has the attribute of good light, while in the *Kh*ândogya the
heaven is spoken of as having good light and the sun as being multiform;
still this difference does not interfere (with the unity of the
vidyâ) <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_167), because both texts equally
use the term 'measured by a span,' and because all *s*âkhâs intimate the
same.--The above explanation of the term 'measured by a span,' which
rests on imaginative identification, the teacher *G*aimini considers the
most appropriate one.
