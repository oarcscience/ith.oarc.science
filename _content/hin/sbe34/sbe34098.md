*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

29\. And from this very reason there follows the eternity of the Veda.

As the eternity of the Veda is founded on the absence of the remembrance
of an agent only, a doubt with regard to it had been raised owing to the
doctrine that the gods and other individuals have sprung from it. That
doubt has been refuted in the preceding Sûtra.--The present Sûtra now
confirms the, already established, eternity of the Veda. The eternity of
the word of the Veda has to be assumed for this very reason, that the
world with its definite (eternal) species, such as gods and so on,
originates from it.--A mantra also ('By means of the sacrifice they
followed the trace of speech; they found it dwelling in the *ri*shis,'
*Ri*g-veda Sa*m*h. X, 71, 3) shows that the speech found (by the
*ri*shis) was permanent.--On this point Vedavyâsa also speaks as
follows: 'Formerly the great *ri*shis, being allowed to do so by
Svayambhû, obtained, through their penance, the Vedas together with the
itihâsas, which had been hidden at the end of the yuga.'
