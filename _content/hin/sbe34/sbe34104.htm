<p>35. And because the kshattriyahood (of <i>G</i>&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti) is understood from the inferential mark (supplied by his being mentioned) later on with <i>K</i>aitraratha (who was a kshattriya himself).</p> <i>
<p>G</i>&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti cannot have been a <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra by birth for that reason also that his being a kshattriya is understood from an inferential sign, viz. his being mentioned together (in one chapter) with the kshattriya <i>K</i>aitraratha Abhiprat&acirc;rin. For, later on, i.e. in the passage complementary to the sa<i>m</i>varga-vidy&acirc;, a kshattriya <i>K</i>aitrarathi Abhiprat&acirc;rin is glorified, 'Once while <i>S</i>aunaka K&acirc;peya and Abhiprat&acirc;rin K&acirc;kshaseni were being waited on at their meal a religious student begged of them' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. IV, 3, 5). That this Abhiprat&acirc;rin was a <i>K</i>aitrarathi (i.e. a descendant of <i>K</i>itraratha) we have to infer from his connexion with a K&acirc;peya. For we know (from <i>S</i>ruti) about the connexion of <i>K</i>itraratha himself with the K&acirc;peyas ('the K&acirc;peyas made <i>K</i>itraratha perform that sacrifice;' T&acirc;<i>nd</i>ya. Br. XX, 12, 5), and as a rule sacrificers of one and the same family employ officiating priests of one and the same family. Moreover, as we understand from Scripture ('from him a <i>K</i>aitrarathi descended who was a prince&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>') that he (<i>K</i>aitraratha) was a prince, we must</p>

<p>understand him to have been a kshattriya. The fact now of <i>G</i>&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti being praised in the same vidy&acirc; with the kshattriya Abhiprat&acirc;rin intimates that the former also was a kshattriya. For as a rule equals are mentioned together with equals. That <i>G</i>&acirc;na<i>s</i>ruti was a kshattriya we moreover conclude from his sending his door-keeper and from other similar signs of power (mentioned in the text).--Hence the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras are not qualified (for the knowledge of Brahman).</p>
