<p>36. On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications (in the case of the higher castes) and on account of their absence being declared (in the case of the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras).</p> 
<p>That the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras are not qualified, follows from that circumstance also that in different places of the vidy&acirc;s such ceremonies as the upanayana and the like are referred to. Compare, for instance, <i>S</i>at. Br. XI, 5, 3, 13, 'He initiated him as a pupil;' <i>Kh</i>. Up. VII, 1, 1, 'Teach me, Sir! thus he approached him;' Pra. Up. I, 1, 'Devoted to Brahman, firm in Brahman, seeking for the highest Brahman they, carrying fuel in their hands, approached the venerable Pippal&acirc;da, thinking that he would teach them all that.'--Thus the following passage also, 'He without having made them undergo the upanayana (said) to them' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. V, 11, 7), shows that the upanayana is a well-established ceremony&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.--With reference to the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dras, on the other hand, the absence of ceremonies is frequently mentioned; so, for instance, Manu X, 4, where they are spoken of as 'once born' only ('the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra is the fourth caste, once-born'), and Manu X, 126, 'In the <i>S</i>&ucirc;dra there is not any sin, and he is not fit for any ceremony.'</p>
