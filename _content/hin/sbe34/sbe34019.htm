<p>13. If (it be objected that the term &acirc;nandamaya, consisting of bliss, can) not (denote the highest Self) on account of its being a word denoting a modification</p> 
<p><A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A></p> 
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (or product); (we declare the objection to be) not (valid) on account of abundance, (the idea of which may be expressed by the affix maya.)</p> 
<p>Here the p&ucirc;rvapakshin raises the objection that the word &acirc;nandamaya (consisting of bliss) cannot denote the highest Self.--Why?--Because the word &acirc;nandamaya is understood to denote something different from the original word (i.e. the word &acirc;nanda without the derivative affix maya), viz. a modification; according to the received sense of the affix maya. '&Acirc;nandamaya' therefore denotes a modification, just as annamaya (consisting of food) and similar words do.</p> 
<p>This objection is, however, not valid, because 'maya' is also used in the sense of abundance, i.e. denotes that where there is abundance of what the original word expresses. So, for instance, the phrase 'the sacrifice is annamaya' means 'the sacrifice is abounding in food' (not 'is some modification or product of food'). Thus here Brahman also, as abounding in bliss, is called &acirc;nandamaya. That Brahman does abound in bliss follows from the passage (Taitt. Up. II, 8), where, after the bliss of each of the different classes of beings, beginning with man, has been declared to be a hundred times greater than the bliss of the immediately preceding class, the bliss of Brahman is finally proclaimed to be absolutely supreme. Maya therefore denotes abundance.</p>
