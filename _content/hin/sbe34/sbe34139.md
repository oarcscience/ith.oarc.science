*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

28\. Hereby all (the doctrines concerning the origin of the world which
are opposed to the Vedânta) are explained, are explained.

The doctrine according to which the pradhâna is the cause of the world
has, in the Sûtras beginning with I, 1, 5, been again and again brought
forward and refuted. The chief reason for the special attention given to
that doctrine is that the Vedânta-texts contain some passages which, to
people deficient in mental penetration, may appear to contain
inferential marks pointing to it. The

doctrine, moreover, stands somewhat near to the Vedânta doctrine since,
like the latter, it admits the non-difference of cause and effect, and
it, moreover, has been accepted by some of the authors of the
Dharma-sûtras, such as Devala, and so on. For all these reasons we have
taken special trouble to refute the pradhâna doctrine, without paying
much attention to the atomic and other theories. These latter theories,
however, must likewise be refuted, as they also are opposed to the
doctrine of Brahman being the general cause, and as slow-minded people
might think that they also are referred to in some Vedic passages. Hence
the Sûtrakâra formally extends, in the above Sûtra, the refutation
already accomplished of the pradhâna doctrine to all similar doctrines
which need not be demolished in detail after their great protagonist,
the pradhâna doctrine, has been so completely disposed of. They also
are, firstly, not founded on any scriptural authority; and are,
secondly, directly contradicted by various Vedic passages.--The
repetition of the phrase 'are explained' is meant to intimate that the
end of the adhyâya has been reached.
