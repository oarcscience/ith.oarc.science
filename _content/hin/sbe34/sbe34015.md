9\. On account of (the individual Soul) going to the Self (the Self
cannot be the pradhâna).

With reference to the cause denoted by the word 'Sat,' Scripture says,
'When a man sleeps here, then, my dear, he becomes united with the Sat,
he is gone to his own (Self). Therefore they say of him, "he sleeps"
(svapiti), because he is gone to his own (svam apîta).' (*Kh*. Up. VI,
8, 1.) This passage explains the well-known verb 'to sleep,' with
reference to the soul. The word, 'his own,' denotes the Self which had
before been denoted by the word Sat; to the Self he (the individual
soul) goes, i.e. into it it is resolved, according to the acknowledged
sense of api-i, which means 'to be resolved into.' The individual soul
(*g*îva) is called awake as long as being connected with the various
external objects by means of the modifications of the mind--which thus
constitute limiting adjuncts of the soul--it apprehends those external
objects, and identifies itself with the gross body, which is one of
those external objects <span id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102). When,
modified by the impressions which the external objects have left, it
sees dreams, it is denoted by the term 'mind <span
id="fr_103"></span>[2](#fn_103).' When, on the cessation of the two
limiting adjuncts (i.e. the subtle and the gross bodies), and the
consequent absence of the modifications due to the adjuncts, it is, in
the state of deep sleep, merged in the Self as it were, then it is said
to be asleep (resolved into the Self). A similar etymology of the word
'h*ri*daya' is given by *s*ruti, 'That Self abides in the heart. And
this is the etymological explanation: he is in the heart (h*ri*di
ayam).' (*Kh*. Up. VIII, 3, 3.) The words a*s*anâya and udanyâ are
similarly etymologised: 'water is carrying away what has been eaten by
him;' 'fire carries away what has been drunk by him' (*Kh*. Up. VI, 8,
3; 5). Thus the passage quoted above explains the resolution (of the
soul) into the Self, denoted by the term 'Sat,' by means of the
etymology of the word 'sleep.' But the intelligent

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Self can clearly
not resolve itself into the non-intelligent pradhâna. If, again, it were
said that the pradhâna is denoted by the word 'own,' because belonging
to the Self (as being the Self's own), there would remain the same
absurd statement as to an intelligent entity being resolved into a
non-intelligent one. Moreover another scriptural passage (viz. 'embraced
by the intelligent--prâ*gñ*a--Self he knows nothing that is without,
nothing that is within,' B*ri*. Up. IV, 3, 21) declares that the soul in
the condition of dreamless sleep is resolved into an intelligent entity.
Hence that into which all intelligent souls are resolved is an
intelligent cause of the world, denoted by the word 'Sat,' and not the
pradhâna.--A further reason for the pradhâna not being the cause is
subjoined.

commentators, not to accept whose guidance in the translation of
scholastic definitions is rather hazardous. A simpler translation of the
clause might however be given.
