*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

24\. On account of the term, (viz. the term 'lord' applied to it) the
(person) measured (by a thumb) (is the highest Lord).

We read (Ka. Up. II, 4, 12), 'The person of the size of a thumb stands
in the middle of the Self,' &c., and (II, 4, 13), 'That person, of the
size of a thumb, is like a light without smoke, lord of the past and of
the future, he is the same to-day and to-morrow. This is that.'--The
question here arises whether the person of the size of a thumb mentioned
in the text is the cognitional (individual) Self or the highest Self.

The pûrvapakshin maintains that on account of the declaration of the
person's size the cognitional Self is meant. For to the highest Self
which is of infinite length and breadth Scripture would not ascribe the
measure of a span; of the cognitional Self, on the other hand, which is
connected with limiting adjuncts, extension of the size of a span may,
by means of some fictitious assumption, be predicated. Sm*ri*ti also
confirms this, 'Then Yama drew forth, by force, from the body of
Satyavat the person of the size of a thumb tied to Yama's noose and
helpless' (Mahâbh. III, 16763). For as Yama could not pull out by force
the highest Self, the passage is clearly seen to refer to the
transmigrating (individual soul) of the size of a thumb, and we thence
infer that the same Self is meant in the Vedic passage under discussion.

To this we reply that the person a thumb long can only

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

be the highest Lord.--Why?--On account of the term 'lord of the past and
of the future.' For none but the highest Lord is the absolute ruler of
the past and the future.--Moreover, the clause 'this is that' connects
the passage with that which had been enquired about, and therefore forms
the topic of discussion. And what had been enquired about is Brahman,
'That which thou seest as neither this nor that, as neither effect nor
cause, as neither past nor future, tell me that' (I, 2, l4).--'On
account of the term,' i.e. on account of the direct statement, in the
text, of a designation, viz. the term 'Lord,' we understand that the
highest Lord is meant  <span id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_195).--But still
the question remains how a certain extension can be attributed to the
omnipresent highest Self.--The reply to this is given, in the next
Sûtra.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_195"></span>[196:1](sbe34093.htm#fr_195) This last sentence
is directed against the possible objection that '*s*abda,' which the
Sûtra brings forward as an argument in favour of the highest Lord being
meant, has the sense of 'sentence' (vâkya), and is therefore of less
force than li<u>n</u>ga, i.e. indicatory or inferential mark which is
represented in our passage by the a<u>n</u>gush*th*amâtratâ of the
purusha, and favours the *g*îva interpretation. *S*abda, the text
remarks, here means *s*ruti, i.e. direct enunciation, and *s*ruti ranks,
as a means of proof, higher than li<u>n</u>ga.
