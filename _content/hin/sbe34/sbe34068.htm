<p>31. On the ground of imaginative identification (the highest Lord may be called pr&acirc;de<i>s</i>am&acirc;tra), <i>G</i>aimini thinks; for thus (Scripture) declares.</p> 
<p>Or else the passage about him who is measured by a span may be considered to rest on imaginative combination.--Why?--Because the passage of the V&acirc;<i>g</i>asaneyi-br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a</p>

<p>which treats of the same topic identifies heaven, earth, and so on--which are the members of Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara viewed as the Self of the threefold world--with certain parts of the human frame, viz. the parts comprised between the upper part of the head and the chin, and thus declares the imaginative identity of Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara with something whose measure is a span. There we read, 'The Gods indeed reached him, knowing him as measured by a span as it were. Now I will declare them (his members) to you so as to identify him (the Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara) with that whose measure is a span; thus he said. Pointing to the upper part of the head he said: This is what stands above (i.e. the heavenly world) as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara (i.e. the head of Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>). Pointing to the eyes he said: This is he with good light (i.e. the sun) as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara (i.e. the eye of V.). Pointing to the nose he said: This is he who moves on manifold paths (i.e. the air) as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara (i.e. the breath of V.). Pointing to the space (ether) within his mouth he said: This is the full one (i.e. the ether) as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara. Pointing to the saliva within his mouth he said: This is wealth as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara (i.e. the water in the bladder of V.). Pointing to the chin he said: This is the base as Vai<i>s</i>v&acirc;nara (i.e. the feet of V.).'--Although in the V&acirc;<i>g</i>asaneyi-br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a the heaven is denoted as that which has the attribute of standing above and the sun as that which has the attribute of good light, while in the <i>Kh</i>&acirc;ndogya the heaven is spoken of as having good light and the sun as being multiform; still this difference does not interfere (with the unity of the vidy&acirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, because both texts equally use the term 'measured by a span,' and because all <i>s</i>&acirc;kh&acirc;s intimate the same.--The above explanation of the term 'measured by a span,' which rests on imaginative identification, the teacher <i>G</i>aimini considers the most appropriate one.</p>
