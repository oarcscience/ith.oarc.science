<p>22. Cessation dependent on a sublative act of the mind, and cessation not so dependent cannot be established, there being no (complete) interruption.</p> 
<p>The Bauddhas who maintain that universal destruction is going on constantly, assume that 'whatever forms an object of knowledge and is different from the triad is produced (sa<i>m</i>sk<i>ri</i>ta) and momentary.' To the triad there mentioned they give the names 'cessation dependent on a sublative act of the mind,' 'cessation not dependent on such an act,' and 'space.' This triad they hold to be non-substantial, of a merely negative character (abh&acirc;vam&acirc;tra), devoid of all positive characteristics. By 'cessation dependent on a sublative act of the mind,' we have to understand such destruction of entities as is preceded by an act of thought &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_401"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; by 'cessation not so dependent' is meant destruction of the opposite kind &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_402"></A><A HREF="#fn_402"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; by 'space' is meant absence in general of something covering (or occupying space). Out of these three non-existences 'space' will be refuted later on (S&ucirc;tra 24), the two other ones are refuted in the present S&ucirc;tra.</p> 
<p>Cessation which is dependent on a sublative act of the mind, and cessation which is not so dependent are both impossible, 'on account of the absence of interruption.' For both kinds of cessation must have reference either to the series (of momentary existences) or to the single members constituting the series.--The former alternative is impossible, because in all series (of momentary existences) the members of the series stand in an unbroken relation of cause and effect so that the series cannot be interrupted &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.--The latter</p>

<p>alternative is likewise inadmissible, for it is impossible to maintain that any momentary existence should undergo complete annihilation entirely undefinable and disconnected (with the previous state of existence), since we observe that a thing is recognised in the various states through which it may pass and thus has a connected existence &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And in those cases also where a thing is not clearly recognised (after having undergone a change) we yet infer, on the ground of actual observations made in other cases, that one and the same thing continues to exist without any interruption.--For these reasons the two kinds of cessation which the Bauddhas assume cannot be proved.</p>

In the former case the series is continued; the latter alternative would imply that the last link does not really <A NAME="page_411"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 411</FONT></A> exist, since the Bauddhas define the satt&acirc; of a thing as its causal efficiency (cp.
