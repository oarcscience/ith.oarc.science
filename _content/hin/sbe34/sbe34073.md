Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

4\. (Nor) also the individual soul (prâ*n*abh*ri*t).

Although to the cognitional (individual) Self the qualities of Selfhood
and intelligence do belong, still omniscience and similar qualities do
not belong to it as its knowledge is limited by its adjuncts; thus the
individual soul also cannot be accepted as the abode of heaven, earth,
&c., for the same reason, i.e. on account of the terms not denoting
it.--Moreover, the attribute of forming the abode of heaven, earth, and
so on, cannot properly be given to the individual soul because the
latter is limited by certain adjuncts and therefore non-pervading (not
omnipresent) <span id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_172).--The special
enunciation (of the individual soul) is caused by what follows <span

accepted as the abode of heaven, earth, &c. for the following reason
also.

been requisite to introduce a special Sûtra <span id="page_159">p.

excluded by the preceding Sûtra--if it were not for the new argument
brought forward in the following Sûtra which applies to the individual
soul only.
