<p>17. And as the (atomic theory) is not accepted (by any authoritative persons) it is to be disregarded altogether.</p> 
<p>While the theory of the pradh&acirc;na being the cause of the world has been accepted by some adherents of the Veda--as, for instance, Manu--with a view to the doctrines of the effect existing in the cause already, and so on, the atomic doctrine has not been accepted by any persons of authority in any of its parts, and therefore is to be disregarded entirely by all those who take their stand on the Veda.</p> 
<p>There are, moreover, other objections to the Vai<i>s</i>eshika doctrine.--The Vai<i>s</i>eshikas assume six categories, which constitute the subject-matter of their system, viz. substance, quality, action, generality, particularity, and inherence. These six categories they maintain to be absolutely different from each other, and to have different characteristics;</p> 
<p><A NAME="page_395"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 395</FONT></A></p> 
<p>just as a man, a horse, a hare differ from one another. Side by side with this assumption they make another which contradicts the former one, viz. that quality, action, &amp;c. have the attribute of depending on substance. But that is altogether inappropriate; for just as ordinary things, such as animals, grass, trees, and the like, being absolutely different from each other do not depend on each other, so the qualities, &amp;c. also being absolutely different from substance, cannot depend on the latter. Or else let the qualities, &amp;c. depend on substance; then it follows that, as they are present where substance is present, and absent where it is absent, substance only exists, and, according to its various forms, becomes the object of different terms and conceptions (such as quality, action, &amp;c.); just as Devadatta, for instance, according to the conditions in which he finds himself is the object of various conceptions and names. But this latter alternative would involve the acceptation of the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya doctrine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the abandonment of the Vai<i>s</i>eshika standpoint.--But (the Vai<i>s</i>eshika may say) smoke also is different from fire and yet it is dependent on it.--True, we reply; but we ascertain the difference of smoke and fire from the fact of their being apperceived in separation. Substance and quality, on the other hand, are not so apperceived; for when we are conscious of a white blanket, or a red cow, or a blue lotus, the substance is in each case cognised by means of the quality; the latter therefore has its Self in the substance. The same reasoning applies to action, generality, particularity, and inherence.</p> 
<p>If you (the Vai<i>s</i>eshika) say that qualities, actions, &amp;c. (although not non-different from substances) may yet depend on the latter because substances and qualities stand in the relation of one not being able to exist without the other (ayutasiddhi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>); we point out that things which are</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><A NAME="page_396"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 396</FONT></A></p> 
<p>ayutasiddha must either be non-separate in place, or non-separate in time, or non-separate in nature, and that none of these alternatives agrees with Vai<i>s</i>eshika principles. For the first alternative contradicts your own assumptions according to which the cloth originating from the threads occupies the place of the threads only, not that of the cloth, while the qualities of the cloth, such as its white colour, occupy the place of the cloth only, not that of the threads. So the Vai<i>s</i>eshika-s&ucirc;tras say (I, 1, 10), 'Substances originate another substance and qualities another quality.' The threads which constitute the causal substance originate the effected substance, viz. the cloth, and the qualities of the threads, such as white colour, &amp;c., produce in the cloth new corresponding qualities. But this doctrine is clearly contradicted by the assumption of substance and quality being non-separate in place--If, in the second place, you explain ayutasiddhatva as non-separation in time, it follows also that, for instance, the right and the left horn of a cow would be ayutasiddha.--And if, finally, you explain it to mean 'non-separation in character,' it is impossible to make any further distinction between the substance and the quality, as then quality is conceived as being identical with substance.</p> 
<p>Moreover, the distinction which the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas make between conjunction (sa<i>m</i>yoga) as being the connexion of things which can exist separately, and inherence (samav&acirc;ya) as being the connexion of things which are incapable of separate existence is futile, since the cause which exists before the effect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> cannot be said to be incapable of separate existence. Perhaps the Vai<i>s</i>eshika will say that his definition refers to one of the two terms only, so that samav&acirc;ya is the connexion, with the cause, of the effect which is incapable of separate existence. But this also is of no avail; for as a connexion requires two terms, the effect as long as it has not yet entered into being cannot be connected with the cause. And it would be equally unavailing to say that the effect enters into the connexion after it has begun to exist; for if the Vai<i>s</i>eshika admits that the effect</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><A NAME="page_397"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 397</FONT></A></p> 
<p>may exist previous to its connexion with the cause, it is no longer ayutasiddha (incapable of separate existence), and thereby the principle that between effect and cause conjunction and disjunction do not take place is violated.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_379"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_380"></A><A HREF="#fn_380"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> just as conjunction, and not samav&acirc;ya, is the connexion in which every effected substance as soon as it has been produced stands with the all-pervading substances as ether, &amp;c.--although no motion has taken place on the part of the effected substance--so also the connexion of the effect with the cause will be conjunction merely, not samav&acirc;ya.</p> 
<p>Nor is there any proof for the existence of any connexion, samav&acirc;ya or sa<i>m</i>yoga, apart from the things which it connects. If it should be maintained that sa<i>m</i>yoga and samav&acirc;ya have such an existence because we observe that there are names and ideas of them in addition to the names and ideas of the things connected, we point out that one and the same thing may be the subject of several names and ideas if it is considered in its relations to what lies without it. Devadatta although being one only forms the object of many different names and notions according as he is considered in himself or in his relations to others; thus he is thought and spoken of as man, Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a learned in the Veda, generous, boy, young man, old man, father, son, grandson, brother, son-in-law. &amp;c. So, again, one and the same stroke is, according to the place it is connected with, spoken of and conceived as meaning either ten, or hundred, or thousand, &amp;c. Analogously, two connected things are not only conceived and denoted as connected things, but in addition constitute the object of the ideas and terms 'conjunction' or 'inherence' which however do not prove</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><A NAME="page_398"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 398</FONT></A></p> 
<p>themselves to be separate entities.--Things standing thus, the non-existence of separate entities (conjunction, &amp;c.), which entities would have to be established on the ground of perception, follows from the fact of their non- perception.</p> 
<p>Nor, again &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_381"></A><A HREF="#fn_381"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, does the circumstance of the word and idea of connexion having for its object the things connected involve the connexion's permanent existence, since we have already shown above that one thing may, on account of its relations to other things, be conceived and denoted in different ways.</p> 
<p>Further &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, conjunction cannot take place between the atoms, the soul, and the internal organ, because they have no parts; for we observe that conjunction takes place only of such substances as consist of parts. If the Vai<i>s</i>eshika should say that parts of the atoms, soul and mind may be assumed (in order to explain their alleged conjunction), we remark that the assumption of actually non-existing things would involve the result that anything might be established; for there is no restrictive rule that only such and such non-existing things--whether contradictory to reason or not--should be assumed and not any other, and assumptions depend on one's choice only and may be carried to any extent. If we once allow assumptions, there is no reason why there should not be assumed a further hundred or thousand things, in addition to the six categories assumed by the Vai<i>s</i>eshikas. Anybody might then assume anything, and we could neither stop a compassionate man from assuming that this transmigratory world which is the cause of so much misery to living beings is not to be, nor a malicious man from assuming that even the released souls are to enter on a new cycle of existences.</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><A NAME="page_399"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 399</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Further, it is not possible that a binary atomic compound, which consists of parts, should be connected with the simple indivisible atoms by an intimate connexion (sa<i>ms</i>lesha) any more than they can thus be connected with ether; for between ether and earth, &amp;c. there does not exist that kind of intimate connexion which exists, for instance, between wood and varnish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p> 
<p>Let it then be said (the Vai<i>s</i>eshika resumes) that the samav&acirc;ya relation must be assumed, because otherwise the relation of that which abides and that which forms the abode--which relation actually exists between the effected substance and the causal substance--is not possible.--That would, we reply, involve the vice of mutual dependence; for only when the separateness of cause and effect is established, the relation of the abode and that which abides can be established; and only when the latter relation is established, the relation of separateness can be established. For the Ved&acirc;ntins acknowledge neither the separateness of cause and effect, nor their standing to each other in the relation of abode and thing abiding, since according to their doctrine the effect is only a certain state of the cause&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_384"></A><A HREF="#fn_384"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.--Moreover, as the atoms are limited (not of infinite extension), they must in reality consist of as many parts as we acknowledge regions of space&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_385"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, whether those be six or eight or ten, and consequently they cannot be permanent; conclusions contrary to the Vai<i>s</i>eshika doctrine of the indivisibility and permanency of the atoms.--If the Vai<i>s</i>eshika replies that those very parts which are owing to the existence of the different regions of space are his (indestructible)</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><A NAME="page_400"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 400</FONT></A></p> 
<p>atoms; we deny that because all things whatever, forming a series of substances of ever-increasing minuteness, are capable of dissolution, until the highest cause (Brahman) is reached. Earth--which is, in comparison with a binary compound, the grossest thing of all--undergoes decomposition; so do the substances following next which belong to the same class as earth; so does the binary compound; and so does, finally, the atom which (although the minutest thing of all) still belongs to the same general class (i.e. matter) with earth, &amp;c. The objection (which the Vai<i>s</i>eshika might possibly raise here again) that things can be decomposed only by the separation of their parts &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_386"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, we have already disposed of above, where we pointed out that decomposition may take place in a manner analogous to the melting of ghee. Just as the hardness of ghee, gold, and the like, is destroyed in consequence of those substances being rendered liquid by their contact with fire, no separation of the parts taking place all the while; so the solid shape of the atoms also may be decomposed by their passing back into the indifferenced condition of the highest cause. In the same way the origination of effects also is brought about not merely in the way of conjunction of parts; for we see that milk, for instance, and water originate effects such as sour milk and ice without there taking place any conjunction of parts.</p> 
<p>It thus appears that the atomic doctrine is supported by very weak arguments only, is opposed to those scriptural passages which declare the Lord to be the general cause, and is not accepted by any of the authorities taking their stand on Scripture, such as Manu and others. Hence it is to be altogether disregarded by highminded men who have a regard for their own spiritual welfare.</p>
