<p>6. Even if we admit (the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya position refuted in what precedes, it is invalidated by other objections) on account of the absence of a purpose (on the part of the pradh&acirc;na).</p> 
<p>Even if we, accommodating ourselves to your (the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya's) belief, should admit what has been disproved in the preceding S&ucirc;tra, viz. that the pradh&acirc;na is spontaneously active, still your opinion would lie open to an objection 'on account of the absence of a purpose.' For if the spontaneous activity of the pradh&acirc;na has, as you say, no reference to anything else, it will have no reference not only to any aiding principle, but also to any purpose or motive, and consequently your doctrine that the pradh&acirc;na is active in order to effect the purpose of man will become untenable. If you reply that the pradh&acirc;na does not indeed regard any aiding principle, but does regard a purpose, we remark that in that case we must distinguish between the different possible purposes, viz. either enjoyment (on the part of the soul), or final release, or both. If enjoyment, what enjoyment, we ask, can belong to the soul which is naturally incapable of any accretion (of pleasure or pain)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>? Moreover, there would in that case be no opportunity for release&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.--If release, then the activity of the pradh&acirc;na would be purposeless, as even antecedently to it the soul is in the</p>

<p>state of release; moreover, there would then be no occasion for the perception of sounds, &amp;c.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--If both, then, on account of the infinite number of the objects of pradh&acirc;na to be enjoyed (by the soul)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, there would be no opportunity for final release. Nor can the satisfaction of a desire be considered as the purpose of the activity of the pradh&acirc;na; for neither the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na nor the essentially pure soul can feel any desire.--If, finally, you should assume the pradh&acirc;na to be active, because otherwise the power of sight (belonging to the soul on account of its intelligent nature) and the creative power (belonging to the pradh&acirc;na) would be purposeless; it would follow that, as the creative power of the pradh&acirc;na does not cease at any time any more than the soul's power of sight docs, the apparent world would never come to an end, so that no final release of the soul could take place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.--It is, therefore, impossible to maintain that the pradh&acirc;na enters on its activity for the purposes of the soul.</p>
