*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

8\. And, again, (the pradhâna cannot be active) because the relation of
principal (and subordinate matter) is impossible (between the three
gu*n*as).

For the following reason also activity on the part of the pradhâna is
not possible.--The condition of the pradhâna

consists in the three gu*n*as, viz. goodness, passion, and darkness,
abiding in themselves in a state of equipoise without standing to one
another in the relation of mutual superiority or inferiority. In that
state the gu*n*as cannot possibly enter into the relation of mutual
subserviency because thereby they would forfeit their essential
characteristic, viz. absolute independence. And as there exists no
extraneous principle to stir up the gu*n*as, the production of the great
principle and the other effects--which would acquire for its operative
cause a non-balanced state of the gu*n*as--is impossible.
