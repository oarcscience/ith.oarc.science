<p>5. Nor (can it be said that the pradh&acirc;na modifies itself spontaneously) like grass, &amp;c. (which turn into milk); for (milk) does not exist elsewhere (but in the female animal).</p> 
<p>Let this be (the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya resumes). Just as grass, herbs, water, &amp;c. independently of any other instrumental cause transform themselves, by their own nature, into milk; so, we assume, the pradh&acirc;na also transforms itself into the great principle, and so on. And, if you ask how we know that grass transforms itself independently of any instrumental cause; we reply, 'Because no such cause is observed.' For if we did perceive some such cause, we certainly should apply it to grass, &amp;c. according to our liking, and thereby produce milk. But as a matter of fact we do no such thing. Hence the transformation of grass and the like must be considered to be due to its own nature merely; and we may infer therefrom that the transformation of the pradh&acirc;na is of the same kind.</p> 
<p>To this we make the following reply.--The transformation of the pradh&acirc;na might be ascribed to its own nature merely if we really could admit that grass modifies itself in the manner stated by you; but we are unable to admit that, since another instrumental cause is observed. How? 'Because it does not exist elsewhere.' For grass becomes milk only when it is eaten by a cow or some other female animal, not if it is left either uneaten or is eaten by a bull. If the transformation had no special cause, grass would become milk even on other conditions than that of entering a cow's body. Nor would the circumstance of men not being able to produce milk according to their liking prove that there is no instrumental cause; for while some effects can be produced by men, others result from divine action only &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The fact, however, is that men also are able, by</p>

<p>applying a means in their power, to produce milk from grass and herbs; for when they wish to procure a more abundant supply of milk they feed the cow more plentifully and thus obtain more milk from her.--For these reasons the spontaneous modification of the pradh&acirc;na cannot be proved from the instance of grass and the like.</p>
