*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George

6\. And on account of Sm*ri*ti.

Sm*ri*ti also declares the difference of the embodied Self

and the highest Self, viz. Bha. Gîtâ XVIII, 61, 'The Lord, O Ar*g*una,
is seated in the heart of all beings, driving round by his magical power
all beings (as if they were) mounted on a machine.'

But what, it may be asked, is that so-called embodied Self different
from the highest Self which is to be set aside according to the
preceding Sûtras? *S*ruti passages, as well as Sm*ri*ti, expressly deny
that there is any Self apart from the highest Self; compare, for
instance, B*ri*. Up. 111, 7, 23, 'There is no other seer but he; there
is no other hearer but he;' and Bha. Gîtâ XIII, 2, 'And know me also, O
Bhârata, to be the kshetra*gñ*a in all kshetras.'

True, we reply, (there is in reality one universal Self only.) But the
highest Self in so far as it is limited by its adjuncts, viz. the body,
the senses, and the mind (mano-buddhi), is, by the ignorant, spoken of
as if it were embodied. Similarly the ether, although in reality
unlimited, appears limited owing to certain adjuncts, such as jars and
other vessels. With regard to this (unreal limitation of the one Self)
the distinction of objects of activity and of agents may be practically
assumed, as long as we have not learned--from the passage, 'That art
thou'--that the Self is one only. As soon, however, as we grasp the
truth that there is only one universal Self, there is an end to the
whole practical view of the world with its distinction of bondage, final
release, and the like.
