*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

35\. And because the kshattriyahood (of *G*âna*s*ruti) is understood
from the inferential mark (supplied by his being mentioned) later on
with *K*aitraratha (who was a kshattriya himself).

Gâna*s*ruti cannot have been a *S*ûdra by birth for that reason also
that his being a kshattriya is understood from an inferential sign, viz.
his being mentioned together (in one chapter) with the kshattriya
*K*aitraratha Abhipratârin. For, later on, i.e. in the passage
complementary to the sa*m*varga-vidyâ, a kshattriya *K*aitrarathi
Abhipratârin is glorified, 'Once while *S*aunaka Kâpeya and Abhipratârin
Kâkshaseni were being waited on at their meal a religious student begged
of them' (*Kh*. Up. IV, 3, 5). That this Abhipratârin was a
*K*aitrarathi (i.e. a descendant of *K*itraratha) we have to infer from
his connexion with a Kâpeya. For we know (from *S*ruti) about the
connexion of *K*itraratha himself with the Kâpeyas ('the Kâpeyas made
*K*itraratha perform that sacrifice;' Tâ*nd*ya. Br. XX, 12, 5), and as a
rule sacrificers of one and the same family employ officiating priests
of one and the same family. Moreover, as we understand from Scripture
('from him a *K*aitrarathi descended who was a prince <span
id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_228)') that he (*K*aitraratha) was a prince,
we must

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

understand him to have been a kshattriya. The fact now of *G*âna*s*ruti
being praised in the same vidyâ with the kshattriya Abhipratârin
intimates that the former also was a kshattriya. For as a rule equals
are mentioned together with equals. That *G*âna*s*ruti was a kshattriya
we moreover conclude from his sending his door-keeper and from other
similar signs of power (mentioned in the text).--Hence the *S*ûdras are
not qualified (for the knowledge of Brahman).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_228"></span>[226:2](sbe34104.htm#fr_228) I translate this
passage as I find it in all MSS. of *S*a<u>n</u>kara consulted by me
(noting, however, that some MSS. read *k*aitrarathinâmaika*h*). Ânanda
Giri expressly explains tasmâd by *k*aitrarathâd ity artha*h*.--The text
of the Tâ*nd*ya Br. runs: tasmâ*k* *k*aitrarathînâm eka*h* kshatrapatir
gâyate, and the commentary explains: tasmât kâra*n*âd adyâpi
*k*itrava*ms*otpannânâ*m* madhye eka eva râ*g*â kshatrapatir <span
id="page_227">p. 227</span> balâdhipatir bhavati.--Grammar does not
authorise the form *k*aitraratha used in the Sûtra.
