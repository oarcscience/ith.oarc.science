*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

31\. And on account of the momentariness (of the âlayavi*gñ*âna, it
cannot be the abode of mental impressions).

If you maintain that the so-called internal cognition
(âlayavi*gñ*âna <span id="fr_414"></span>[1](#fn_414)) assumed by you
may constitute the abode

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

of the mental impressions, we deny that, because that cognition also
being admittedly momentary, and hence non-permanent, cannot be the abode
of impressions any more than the quasi-external cognitions
(prav*ri*tti-vi*gñ*âna). For unless there exists one continuous
principle equally connected with the past, the present, and the future
 <span id="fr_415"></span>[1](#fn_415), or an absolutely unchangeable
(Self) which cognises everything, we are unable to account for
remembrance, recognition, and so on, which are subject to mental
impressions dependent on place, time, and cause. If, on the other hand,
you declare your âlayavi*gñ*âna to be something permanent, you thereby
abandon your tenet of the âlayavi*gñ*âna as well as everything else
being momentary.--Or (to explain the Sûtra in a different way) as the
tenet of general momentariness is characteristic of the systems of the
idealistic as well as the realistic Bauddhas, we may bring forward
against the doctrines of the former all those arguments dependent on the
principle of general momentariness which we have above urged against the
latter.

We have thus refuted both nihilistic doctrines, viz. the doctrine which
maintains the (momentary) reality of the external world, and the
doctrine which asserts that ideas only exist. The third variety of
Bauddha doctrine, viz. that everything is empty (i. e. that absolutely
nothing exists), is contradicted by all means of right knowledge, and
therefore requires no special refutation. For this apparent world, whose
existence is guaranteed by all the means of knowledge, cannot be denied,
unless some one should find out some new truth (based on which he could
impugn its existence)--for a general principle is proved by the absence
of contrary instances.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_414"></span>[426:1](sbe34207.htm#fr_414) The
vi*gñ*ânaskandha comprises vi*gñ*ânas of two different kinds, the
âlayavi*gñ*âna and the prav*ri*ttivi*gñ*âna. The âlayavi*gñ*âna
comprises the series of cognitions or ideas which refer to the ego; the
prav*ri*ttivi*gñ*âna comprises those ideas which refer to apparently
external objects, such as colour and the like. The ideas of the <span
id="page_427">p. 427</span> latter class are due to the mental
impressions left by the antecedent ideas of the former class.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[427:1](sbe34207.htm#fr_415) Viz. in the
present case the principle that what presents itself to consciousness is
not non-existent.
