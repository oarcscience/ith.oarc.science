<p><A NAME="img_tinit"></A>
<TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/tinit.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"></TD></TR></TABLE>THE Self-Being pierced the openings outward; hence one looks outward, not within himself. A wise man looked towards the Self with reverted sight, seeking deathlessness.</p>  
<p>Children seek after outward desires; they come to the net of widespread death. But the wise, beholding deathlessness, seek not for the enduring among unenduring things.</p>  
<p>By that which perceives form, taste, smell, sounds, and embraces; by this verily he discerns, for what else is there? This is that.</p>  
<p>The wise man, thinking that that by which he perceives both waking and dreaming life, is the great, the. lord, the Self, grieves not.</p>  
<p>He who perceives the living Self, the honey-eater, close at hand, the lord of what has been and what shall be, he is no longer seeking for refuge. This is that.</p>  
<p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></A></p>  
<p>He who knows the first-born of radiance, born of old of the waters, standing hid in secret, who looked forth through creatures. This is that.</p>  
<p>And the great mother, full of divinity, who comes forth through life, standing hid in secret, who was born through creatures. This is that.</p>  
<p>The fire hidden in the fire-sticks&#8212;like a germ, well concealed by the mothers&#8212;that fire is day by day to be praised by men who wake, with the oblation. This is that.</p>  
<p>Whence the sun rises, and whither he goes to setting; that all the bright ones rest on, nor does any go beyond it. This is that.</p>  
<p>What is here, that is there; what is there, that also is here. He goes from death to death who sees a difference between them.</p>  
<p>This is to be received by the mind, that there is no difference here. From death to death he goes, who sees a difference.</p>  
<p>The spirit of the measure of a finger stands in the midst, in the Self; lord of what has been, and what shall be. Thereafter one is no longer seeking for refuge. This is that.</p>  
<p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></A></p>  
<p>The spirit of the measure of a finger is like a light without smoke; lord of what has been and what shall be, the same to-day and to-morrow. This is that.</p>  
<p>As water rained on broken ground runs away among the mountains; so he who beholds separate natures runs hither and thither after them.</p>  
<p>As pure water poured in pure remains the same, so is the Self of the discerning sage, O descendant of Gotama.</p>  
<p>Understanding the eleven-doored dwelling of the unborn seer of truth, he grieves not; and, freed, he is set free. This is that.</p>  
<p>This is the Swan in the pure world, the radiant in the middle world, the fire here on the altar; as a guest in a dwelling.</p>  
<p>This is the essence of man, the essence of the best, the essence of the deep and the ether; those born of the water, of earth, of the deep, of the mountains, are that true great one.</p>  
<p>He leads upward the forward-life, and casts back the downward-life. All the bright powers bow to the dwarf seated in their midst.</p>  
<p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></A></p>  
<p>When this lord of the body, standing within the body, departs; when he goes forth free from the body, what is left? This is that.</p>  
<p>No mortal lives by the forward-life, nor by the downward-life. But by another they live, in whom these two rest.</p>  
<p>This secret immemorial Eternal, I shall declare to thee; and how the Self is, on attaining death, O descendant of Gotama.</p>  
<p>Some come to the womb, for the embodying of that lord of the body. Others reach the resting-place, according to deeds, according to what they have understood.</p>  
<p>The spirit that wakes in those that dream, moulding desire after desire, is that bright one, that Eternal; that they call the immortal one. In this all the worlds rest, nor does any go beyond it. This is that.</p>  
<p>As fire, being one, on entering the world, is assimilated to form after form; so the inner Self of all being is assimilated to form after form, and yet remains outside them.</p>  
<p>As the air, being one, on entering the world, is assimilated to form after</p>  
<p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></A></p>  
<p>form; so the inner Self of all being is assimilated to form after form, and yet remains outside them.</p>  
<p>As the sun, the eye of all the world, is not smeared by visible outer stains; so the inner Self of all being is not smirched by sorrow of the world, but remains outside it.</p>  
<p>The one ruler, the inner Self of all being, who makes one form manifold; the wise who behold him within themselves, theirs is happiness, and not others'.</p>  
<p>The durable among undurables; the soul of souls, who though one, disposes the desires of many; the wise who behold him within themselves, theirs is peace everlasting, and not others'.</p>  
<p>This is that, they think, the ineffable supreme joy. How then may I know, whether this shines or borrows its light? No sun shines there, nor the moon and stars; nor lightnings, nor fire like this. All verily shines after that shining. From the shining of that, all this borrows light.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Rooted above, with branches below,</p>  
<p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></A></p>  
<p>is this immemorial Tree. It is that bright one, that Eternal; it is called the immortal. In it all the worlds rest; nor does any go beyond it. This is that.</p>  
<p>All that the universe is, moves in life, emanated from it. It is the great fear, the upraised thunderbolt. They who have seen it, become immortal.</p>  
<p>Through fear of this, Fire glows; through fear of this, the Sun glows; through fear of it, the King and Breath; and Death runs, as fifth.</p>  
<p>If one has been able to understand it here, before the body's falling away, he builds for embodiment in the creative worlds.</p>  
<p>As in a mirror, this is seen in the Self; as in a dream, it is seen in the world; as in 'the waters around, it is seen in the world of sylphs; as in the fire and the shadow, it is seen in the world of the Evolver.</p>  
<p>Considering the life of the powers as apart, and their rising and setting as they grow up apart, the wise man grieves not.</p>  
<p>Mind is higher than the powers, the real is higher than mind; than this real, the great Self is higher;</p>  
<p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></A></p>  
<p>and than the great, the unmanifest is higher.</p>  
<p>Than the unmanifest, spirit is higher, the universal and formless; knowing which a being is released, and goes to immortality.</p>  
<p>The form of this does not stand visible, nor does anyone behold it with the eye., By the heart, the soul, the mind, it is grasped; and those who know it become immortal.</p>  
<p>When the five perceptions and mind are steadied; and when the soul struggles not, this, they say, is the highest way.</p>  
<p>This they think to be anion, the firm holding of the powers. Unperturbed is this union, though there be ebb and flow.</p>  
<p>Nor by speech, nor by mind can it be gained; nor by sight. It is gained by him who can affirm "It is"; how else could it be gained?</p>  
<p>It is to be gained by affirming "It is"; and as the real in what is and is not. In him who obtains it by affirming "It is" its reality is perfected.</p>  
<p>When all desires that dwell in his heart are let go, the mortal becomes immortal, and reaches the Eternal.</p>  
<p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></A></p>  
<p>When all the knots of his heart are untied here, the mortal becomes immortal. So far is the teaching.</p>  
<p>A hundred and one are the heart's channels; of these one passes to the crown. Going up by this, he comes to the immortal. The others lead hither and thither. .</p>  
<p>The spirit of the measure of a finger, the inner Self, ever dwells in the hearts of men. Let him draw forth this spirit from his body, firmly, like the pith from a reed.</p>  
<p>Let him know that this is the bright one, the immortal. Let him know it is the bright one, the immortal.</p>  
<p>Nachiketas thus having received the knowledge declared by Death, and the whole law of union, became a passionless dweller in the Eternal, and deathless; and so may another who thus knows the union with the Self.</p>
