<p>"Vaisampayana said, 'When the Brahma-weapon was withdrawn by Krishna, at that time, the laying-in room was illumined by thy father with his energy. All the Rakshasas (that had come there) were forced to leave the room and many of them met with destruction. In the welkin a voice was heard, saying, 'Excellent, O Kesava, Excellent!'--The blazing Brahma-weapon then returned to the Grandsire (of all the worlds). Thy sire got back his life-breaths, O king. The child began to move according to his energy and might. The Bharata</p>

<p>ladies became filled with joy. At the command of Govinda, the Brahmanas were made to utter benedictions. All the ladies, filled with joy, praised Janarddana. Indeed, the wives of those Bharata lions, <i>viz.</i>, Kunti and Drupada's daughter and Subhadra, and Uttara, and the wives of other lions among men, like (ship-wrecked) persons who have reached the shore after having obtained a boat, became exceedingly glad. Then wrestlers and actors and astrologers and those who enquire after the slumbers (of princes), and bands of bards and eulogists all uttered the praises of Janarddana, while uttering benedictions fraught with the praises of the Kuru race, O chief of the Bharatas. Uttara, rising up at the proper time, with a delighted heart and bearing her child in her arms, reverentially saluted the delighter of the Yadus. Rejoicing greatly, Krishna made gifts unto the child of many valuable gems. The other chiefs of the Vrishni race, did the same. Then the puissant Janarddana, firmly adhering to truth, bestowed a name on the infant who was thy sire, O monarch.--'Since this child of Abhimanyu has been born at a time when this race has become nearly extinct, let his name be Parikshit!' Even this is what he said. Then thy father, O king, began to grow, and gladden all the people, O Bharata. When thy father was a month old, O hero, the Pandavas came back to their capital, bringing with them a profusion of wealth. Hearing that the Pandavas were near, those foremost ones of the Vrishni race went out. The citizens decked the city called after the elephant with garlands of flowers in profusions, with beautiful pennons and standards of diverse kinds. The citizens also, O king, adorned their respective mansions. Desirous of doing what was beneficial to the sons of Pandu, Vidura ordered diverse kinds of worship to be offered to the deities established in their respective temples. The principal streets of the city were adorned with flowers. Indeed, the city was filled with the hum of thousands of voices which resembled the softened roar of distant ocean waves. With dancers all engaged in their vocation, and with the voice of singers, the (Kuru) city then resembled the mansion of Vaisravana himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Bards and eulogists, O king, accompanied by beautiful women were seen to adorn diverse retired spots in the city. The pennons were caused by the wind to float gaily on every part of the city, as if bent upon showing the Kurus the southern and the northern points of the compass. All the officers also of the government loudly proclaimed that that was to be a day of rejoicing for the entire kingdom as an indication of the success of the enterprise for bringing a profusion of gems and other valuables.'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>
