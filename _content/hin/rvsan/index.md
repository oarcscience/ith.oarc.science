# The Rig Veda

### in Sanskrit

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an experimental Sanskrit version of the Rig Veda; each verse
occupies a separate file and is encoded in UTF-8 Unicode Devanagari and
standard romanization. This version is derived from an ITRANS
transcription which has been published at several different locations on
the Internet. This version has some minor defects originating in the
source files, which we hope to fix at some point. These files were
posted in June 2004, and have not as of yet been vetted by any Sanskrit
scholars. We welcome feedback about these files, see the site [contact
page](../../contact). Also refer to the [notes on the ITRANS
source](notes).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: To view the Sanskrit and Romanization of the Rig
Veda, you need to set up your browser to view Unicode content. If you
don't do this, you will see lots of boxes or question marks on these
pages. This is not a problem with the site, it is a problem with your
browser. For step by step instructions on how to set up your browser to
view these pages properly, read the [Unicode page](../../unicode).
