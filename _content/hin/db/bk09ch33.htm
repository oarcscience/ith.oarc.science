Dharmar&acirc;jan said :-- Those that are in Hari&#146;s service, pure, the Siddhas in Yoga (those that have attained success in Yoga), the performers of Vratas (vows), the chaste, the ascetics, the Brahmach&acirc;ris never go to hells. There is no doubt in this. Those persons that are proud of their strong positions and who use very harsh burning words to their friends, they go to Vah<u>n</u>i Ku<u>nd</u>a and live there for as many years as&#160; there are hairs on his body; next they attain animal births for three births and get themselves scorched under the strong heat of the Sun.

He lives there for as many years as there are hairs on his body and he has to sleep on a bed of fire, very tormenting. Then he will have to be born for seven births as birds. If anybody washes any clothing with any salt on Sunday, or on the day of Samkr&acirc;nti (when the Sun enters another sign), or on any new-moon day or on any S&#146;r&acirc;ddha day (when funeral ceremonies are performed), he will have to go to the K<u>s</u>&acirc;ra Ku<u>nd</u>a hell where he remains for as many years as there are threads in that clothing and finally he becomes born for seven births as a veritable washerman. The wretch that abuses M&ucirc;la Prakriti, the Vedas, the S&#146;&acirc;stras, Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>as, Brahm&acirc;, Vi<u>sn</u>u, S&#146;iva and the other Devas, Gaur&icirc;, Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;, Sarasvat&icirc; and the other Dev&icirc;s, goes to the hell named Bhay&acirc;naka Narakaku<u>nd</u>a. There is no other hell more tormenting than this. The sinners live here for many Kalpas and ultimately become serpents. There is no sin greater than the abuse of the Dev&icirc;. There is no expiation for it. So one ought never to abuse the Dev&icirc;. If one discontinues the allowances given by oneself or other persons to the Devas or Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>as, one goes to Vi<u>st</u>h&acirc; Ku<u>nd</u>a and has to eat the faeces there for sixty thousand years and finally to be born in Bh&acirc;rata as worms in faeces the same number of years. If any person without the owner&#146;s permission digs another&#146;s tank dried of water, or makes water in the water of any tank, he goes to M&ucirc;tra Ku<u>nd</u>a and drinks urine for as many years as there are the particles in that tank. Then he becomes born in this Bh&acirc;rata its an ox for one hundred years. If any person eats good things himself without giving any portion thereof to the member of his family, he goes to S&#146;le<u>s</u>ma Ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats phlegm, for full one hundred years. Then he becomes born as Preta (disembodied spirits) in this Bh&acirc;rata for hundred years and drinks phlegm, urine and pus; then he becomes pure. He who does not support his father, mother, spiritual teacher, wife, sons, daughters and the helpless persons, goes to Gara Ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats poison for full one hundred years. Finally he becomes born and wanders as Bh&ucirc;tas (disembodied spirits). Then he becomes pure.</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">20-50. He who becomes angry and shrinks his eyes at the sight of a guest who has come to his house offends the Devas or Pitris, who do not accept the water offered to them by that villain. On the contrary, he earns all the sins of Brahmahaty&acirc; (murder of a Br&acirc;hmi<u>n</u> and so forth) and finally goes to D&ucirc;<u>s</u>ik&acirc;ku<u>nd</u>a where he remains for one hundred years and eats polluted things. Then wandering as Bh&ucirc;tas for one hundred years he becomes purified.

Then he has to roam about in India for seven births as a Krikal&acirc;sa (lizard) and finally he becomes born as a very poor man with a very short life. If any woman or any man makes another of a different sex eat semen, out of passion, he goes to S&#146;ukra Ku<u>nd</u>a where he drinks semen for one hundred years. Then he crawls about as worms for one hundred years. And then he gets purified. If anybody beats a Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>a who is a family preceptor and causes his blood to come out, he will have to go to Rakta Ku<u>nd</u>a where he has to drink blood for one hundred years. Finally he has to roam about for seven births in India as tigers; then he becomes pure by degrees. If anybody mocks and laughs at any devotee of Kri<u>sn</u>a who sings with rapt consciousness and sheds tears of joy, he will have to go to As&#146;ru Ku<u>nd</u>a where he drinks tears for one hundred years. Then he has to roam as Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la for three births and then he becomes pure. He who always cheats his friends, lives for one hundred years in G&acirc;tramala Ku<u>nd</u>a. Then roaming about for three births as an ass and for three births as a fox concurrently, he becomes purified. Out of vanity, if anybody jests at a deaf person, he goes to Kar<u>n</u>amalaku<u>nd</u>a where he eats for one hundred years the wax of the ear. Next he comes to the earth as a deaf and very poor man for seven births, when at last he gets purified. If anybody commits murder out of greed to support his family, he goes to the hell Majj&acirc;ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats marrow for one lakh years. Next he becomes a fish for seven births, for seven births he becomes a mosquito, for three births he becomes a boar, for seven births he becomes a cock, deer and other animals concurrently; at last he gets purified. If any stupid person sells the daughter whom he has supported, out of greed for money, he goes to M&acirc;<u>n</u>saku<u>nd</u>a and lives there for as many years as there are hairs on her body. The Yama&#146;s servants beat him with their clubs. His head becomes overloaded with the burden of the flesh; and, out of hunger, he licks the blood coming out of his head. Next that sinner comes to Bh&acirc;rata and for sixty years becomes a worm in any daughter&#146;s faeces, for seven births he becomes a hunter; for three births, a boar; for seven births, cock; for seven births, frog; for seven births, leech; and for seven births, crow; when he gets purified. One who shaves on the day of observing vows, fasting and funeral ceremony day, becomes impure and unfit to do any action, and, in the end, he goes to the Nakha Ku<u>nd</u>a where he receives blows of clubs and eats nails for one hundred Deva years. If anybody worships, out of carelessness, the earthen S&#146;iva phallic symbol with any hairs on it, he goes to the hell Kes&#146;a Ku<u>nd</u>a where he remains for as many years as there are particles in that hair; then he gets to the yoni (womb) a Y&acirc;van&acirc;n&icirc; (a Mlechcha woman) out of Hara&#146;s wrath.

He who does not offer Pi<u>nd</u>as to the Vi<u>sn</u>up&acirc;da in honour of his Pitris at Gay&acirc; goes to the hell Asthiku<u>nd</u>a where he remains for as many years as there are dirts on his body. Then he becomes a man; but for seven births he becomes lame and poor. Then he gets purified. The stupid man who commits outrage and violence on his pregnant wife, resides for one hundred years in the hot T&acirc;mra Ku<u>nd</u>a (where coppers are in a molten condition). He who takes the food of a childless widow and the same of any woman that has just bathed after menstruation goes for one hundred years to the hot Lauha Ku<u>nd</u>a (where iron is in a molten condition). For seven births he becomes then a crow and for seven births he becomes born of a washerwoman, full of sores and boils, and poor. Then he gets purified.</p>

If any Br&acirc;hmi<u>n</u> eats a S&#146;&ucirc;dra&#146;s food, requested by him, he lives for one hundred years in the hot Sur&acirc; Ku<u>nd</u>a. Then for seven births he performs, the funeral rites for a S&#146;&ucirc;dra; at last he becomes pure. If any foul-mouthed person uses always harsh and filthy language to his master, he will have to go to T&icirc;k<u>sn</u>a Kan<u>t</u>aka Ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats thorns. Besides, the Yama&#146;s servants give severe beatings to him with their clubs. For seven births he will have to become horses when he gets purified. If any man ministers poison to another and so takes away his life, he will have to remain for endless years in Vi<u>s</u>aku<u>nd</u>a, where he will have to eat poison. Then he will have to pass for one hundred years as a murderer Bhilla, full of sores and boils, and for seven births he will have to be a leper when at last he gets purified. Being born in this holy land Bh&acirc;ratavar<u>s</u>a, if any man strikes a cow with a rod or any driver does so whether by himself or by his servant, he will have to dwell certainly in the hot Lauha Ku<u>nd</u>a for four yugas. He will have to pass as many years as a cow as there are hairs on that cow when ultimately he gets purified. If anybody strikes any other body with a red-hot iron dart (Kunta weapon), he will have to dwell in the Kunta Ku<u>nd</u>a for ayuta years.

If any Br&acirc;hmi<u>n</u> performs the S&#146;r&acirc;dh of a S&#146;&ucirc;dra, eats the food pertaining to a S&#146;r&acirc;dh of a S&#146;&ucirc;dra or burns the dead body of a S&#146;&ucirc;dra, he will have to dwell certainly in P&ucirc;ya Ku<u>nd</u>a, where, being beaten by the rod of Yama, he eats the pus, etc., for as many years as there are hairs on his body. Then he becomes reborn in this Bh&acirc;rata as one greatly diseased, poor, deaf and dumb and ultimately he will have to roam for seven births as a S&#146;&ucirc;dra. He who kills a black serpent on whose hood there is the lotus mark, lives in Sarpa Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs on his body and he is bitten by serpents there and beaten by the servants of Yama and eats the excrescences of snakes and finally becomes born as a serpent. Then he becomes a man shortlived and having the cuticaneous disease and ringworm. And his death also comes out of snake-bite. He who kills mosquitoes and other small fanged-animals, that earn their substance rightly and pass so their lives, goes to Dams&#146;a mas&#146;a Ku<u>nd</u>a where he is eaten by mosquitoes and other fanged-creatures and lives there without food and crying, weeping, for as many years as the numbers of lives destroyed. Besides the Yama&#146;s servants tie his hands and feet and beat him. Then he becomes born as flies when ultimately he becomes purified. He who beats and chastises any man not fit to be chastised and beaten and as well as a Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>a, goes to Vajra Dam<u>st</u>ra Ku<u>nd</u>a, full of worms, and lives there day and night for as many years as there are the number of hairs on the chastised person. When he is bitten by the worms and beaten by Yama&#146;s servants, he cries sometimes, weeps sometimes, and becomes very miserable. Next he is reborn as a crow for seven births when ultimately he gets purified. If any foolish king punishes and gives trouble to his subjects out of greed of money, he goes to Vri<u>s</u>chika Ku<u>nd</u>a where he lives for as many years as there are hairs on the bodies of his subjects. There is no doubt in this. Finally he becomes born in this Bh&acirc;rata as a scorpion; then a man diseased and defective in limbs, when ultimately he becomes freed of his sins. If any Br&acirc;hmi<u>n</u> carries or raises weapons, washes the clothes of others who do not perform Sandhy&acirc;s and abandons his devotion to Hari, he lives in Sar&acirc;di Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs on his body; he is, then, pierced by arrows.

If any man, overpowered with lust, sees another&#146;s wife&#146;s uncovered breast, loins, and face, he will have to remain in K&acirc;ka Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs in his own body.

He who steals in India the gold of the Devas and the Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>as, dwells certainly in Manth&acirc;na Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs on his body. My servants give him good beatings, and cudgellings; his eyes are covered by Manth&acirc;na Danda insects (or animals) and he eats their dirty faeces. Then he is reborn as a man but for three births he becomes blind and for seven births he becomes very poor, cruel, and a sinful goldsmith and then he is born a Svar<u>n</u>ava<u>n</u>ik (Son&acirc;r bene). O Fair One! He who steals in India copper or iron, silver or gold, dwells in V&icirc;ja Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs on his body.

If anybody steals in India any Devat&acirc; or the articles of a Devat&acirc;, he dwells in Vajra Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs on his body. There his body gets burnt up.

When, at last, he gets purified. If anybody steals any Br&acirc;hmi<u>n&#146;</u>s property and thereby does chakra p&ucirc;j&acirc; (the famous chakra circle worship in Tantra), or prepares a potter&#146;s wheel or any other wheels, he will have to go to Chakra Ku<u>nd</u>a and remain there for one hundred years, tormented by My messengers.

For seven births he becomes born emitting a nasty smell, for three births he becomes musk (mriga-n&acirc;bhi); for seven births, as a Manth&acirc;na insect. Then he becomes born as a man. If, out of envy, a powerful man appropriates to his purpose another&#146;s ancestral property by cheating, by using force, he goes to the hot S&ucirc;ch&icirc; Ku<u>nd</u>a, being tormented there like a J&icirc;va dropped in the midst of a very hot oil tank, full of boiling oil.

Thus that villain, getting a fresh lease of human birth, begins again to do fresh good acts.</p>
