In days of yore, from the Lotus Face of the Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavata came out S&#146;r&icirc; Mad Bh&acirc;gavatam in the form of half a S&#146;loka, as the decided conclusion of the Vedas. About what She gave instructions to Vi<u>sn</u>u, sleeping on a leaf of a Banyan tree, that same thing, the seed of the S&#146;r&icirc; Mad Bh&acirc;gavata, Brahm&acirc; Himself expanded into</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">one hundred Ko<u>t</u>i s&#146;lokas. Then, Veda Vy&acirc;sa, in order to teach his own son S&#146;uka Deva, condensed them into eighteen thousand s&#146;lokas, in Twelve Books and named it S&#146;r&icirc; Mad Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam, the present volume. That voluminous book comprising one hundred Ko<u>t</u>i s&#146;lokas compiled by Brahm&acirc; are still extant in the Deva loka. There is no Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>a like the Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam, so merit-giving, holy and capable to destroy all the sins. The reading of every line yields the fruits of performing many As&#146;vamedha sacrifices. Human beings addicted to worldly affairs will get the merit of giving lands to the Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>as and they will enjoy also all the pleasures of the world and in the end will go to the region of the Dev&icirc;, if they can hear, after they have fasted and controlled their passions, the recitation of this Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>am from the mouth of a Paur&acirc;<u>n</u>ik Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>a, who has been worshipped and given clothings and ornaments and is considered as a second Veda Vy&acirc;sa. Or, if anybody writes the whole of the Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam with his own hand or gets it written by a writer from the beginning to the end and gives to a Paur&acirc;<u>n</u>ik Br&acirc;hmi<u>n</u> the book placed in a box of the form of a lion made up of gold and a cow yielding milk with her calf with gold as his sacrificial fee; or if he feeds as many Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>as as there are the number of chapters of the Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam and worship as many Kum&acirc;r&icirc;s (virgin girls) with saffron, sandalpaste and ornaments and feeds them with P&acirc;ys&acirc;nna, he gets the merits of giving lands and enjoys all the pleasures of the world and goes in the end to the region of the Dev&icirc;. He has no want of anything who daily hears with rapt devotion this Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam. One who has no wealth gets abundance of wealth, those who are students get knowledge, one who has no sons, gets sons if one hears this Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam with true devotion. A barren woman, or one who bears still-born children or whose offsprings never live long or who bears only a single child, gets all her defects removed, if she hears this Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam with a steadfast devotion. The house where this Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>a is worshipped, Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc; and Sarasvat&icirc; dwell there, leaving their animosities towards each other. By the influence of this Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam the D&acirc;kin&icirc;s, Vet&acirc;las, R&acirc;k<u>s</u>asas, and other ghosts cannot cast a glance even on its devotee. If anybody gets fever and if the S&#146;r&icirc; Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam be read touching him with a concentrated attention, all the complaints disappear. By reading this Bh&acirc;gavatam, one hundred times even more difficult than the severe disease pthisis is cured.</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">18-20. If after performing the Sandhy&acirc;, one reads only one chapter of this Bh&acirc;gavatam with a collected mind, he soon acquires the Real Knowledge. O Muni S&#146;aunaka! While going to read this Bh&acirc;gavatam, first examine omens and then read. I have spoken already on this subject. If during the S&#146;&acirc;rad&icirc;ya P&ucirc;j&acirc; (the autumnal Durg&acirc; P&ucirc;j&acirc;), at the</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">Navar&acirc;tra period, one reads with devotion this Bh&acirc;gavatam, the Dev&icirc; Bhagavat&icirc; becomes greatly pleased and awards him results more than his desires.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">21-31. During the Navar&acirc;tri period all can read well this book for the satisfaction of his &Icirc;<u>st</u>a Deva (his own deity) whether he be a Vai<u>sn</u>ava, S&#146;aiva, Saura, G&acirc;<u>n</u>apatya or a S&#146;&acirc;kta. All can read this for the satisfaction of Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;, Um&acirc; and other S&#146;aktis. The Vaidik Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>as are to recite this daily for the satisfaction of the Dev&icirc; G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. This Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>am is not contradictory to any sectarian belief. The reason of this being that to whatever deity he pays his worship, he must worship some S&#146;akti or other, this is stated everywhere. So for the satisfaction of one&#146;s own S&#146;akti, all can read this, without contradicting each other. Never any woman nor any S&#146;&ucirc;dra, is to read this herself or himself, even out of ignorance; rather they should hear this from the mouth of a Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>a. This is the rule of the S&#146;&acirc;stras. (The vibrations and the consequent results would be truer then.) O Ri<u>s</u>is! What more to say on this book than this, that this Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>am is the most excellent of all and yields great merits. It is the essence of the Vedas. This I tell you with great certainty. There is not the least doubt in this. Reading or hearing this yields results equivalent to reading or hearing the Vedas. I now bow to the Dev&icirc; of the nature of Hr&icirc;m and established by G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, of the nature of Everlasting Existence, Intelligence and Bliss, Who stimulates our activities to the understanding of various subjects. Thus hearing the excellent words of S&ucirc;ta, the great Paur&acirc;<u>n</u>ik, all the Munis of Naimi<u>s</u>&acirc;ra<u>n</u>ya worshipped him specially and as the result of hearing this Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>am glady became the servants of the Lotus Feet of the Dev&icirc; and they attained the Highest Rest. The Munis expressed their humility and gratitude to S&ucirc;ta frequently and bowed down to him again and again. And they said :-- &#147;O S&ucirc;ta! It is you that have saved us from this ocean of world.&#148; Thus (the great Bh&acirc;gavata) S&ucirc;ta, the bee drinking the honey of the Lotus Feet of the Dev&icirc;, recited before the assemblage of the best of the Munis this Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>am from the beginning to the end, the Secret of all the Nigamas and full of the Glories of the Dev&icirc; Bhagavat&icirc;. After this the Ri<u>s</u>is bowed down to him and he blessed and honoured them.</p>
