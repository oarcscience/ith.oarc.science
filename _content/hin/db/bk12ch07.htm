Now I want to hear about how initiations in Mantrams are performed, without which nobody, be he a Br&acirc;hmi<u>n</u>, a K<u>s</u>attriya, a Vais&#146;ya or a S&#146;&ucirc;dra, is entitled to have the Dev&icirc; Mantra.

I am now telling you about the rules of initiation (D&icirc;k<u>s</u>&acirc;) of the disciples, pure in heart. When they are initiated, they become entitled then and not before that, to worship the Devas, the Fire and the Guru. That method of instruction, and religious act and ceremony is called the D&icirc;k<u>s</u>&acirc; (initiation) by which the Divine Knowledge is imparted; and at once flashes in the heart and mind of the initiated that Knowledge and all his sins are then destroyed. So the Pundits of the Vedas and the Tantras, say. (The Divine Knowledge is like lightning, fire, arising and permeating the body, mind, and spirit.) This D&icirc;k<u>s</u>&acirc; ought to be taken by all means. This gives excellent merits and pure results. Both the Guru and the S&#146;i<u>s</u>ya (disciple) ought to be very pure and true. (This is the first essential requisite. Then the results are instantaneous). First of all, the Guru is to perform all the morning duties, he is to take his bath and perform his Sandhy&acirc; Vandanams. He is to return home from the banks of the river with his Kama<u>nd</u>alu and observe maunam (silence). Then, in order to give D&icirc;k<u>s</u>&acirc;, he is to enter into the assigned room (Y&acirc;ga Ma<u>nd</u>apa) and take his seat on an &Acirc;sana that is excellent and calculated to please all. He is to perform &Acirc;chanara and do Pr&acirc;<u>n</u>&acirc;y&acirc;ma. Then he should take water in his Arghya vessel and putting scents and flowers in that, charge that water with Pha<u>t</u>k&acirc;ra mantra (that is, condense electricity Spirit in that). Then uttering the Pha<u>t</u> mantra, he is to sprinkle the water on the doorways of the worshiproom and begin his P&ucirc;j&acirc;. Firstly, on the top of the door at one end invoke the Deity Ga<u>n</u>an&acirc;th&acirc; by His mantra, at the other end invoke Sarasvat&icirc; by Her mantra and at the middle, invoke Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc; Dev&icirc; by Her mantra duly and worship them, with flowers. Then, on the right side worship Gang&acirc; and Bigh<u>n</u>es&#146;a; and on the left side worship K<u>s</u>ettrap&acirc;la and Yamun&acirc;, the daughter of the Sun. Similarly, on the bottom of the door, worship the Astra Devat&acirc; by the</p>

Then consider the whole Ma<u>nd</u>apa as inspired with the presence of the Dev&icirc;, and see the whole place as pervaded by Her through and through. Then, repeat the Pha<u>t</u> mantra and destroy the Celestial obstacles as well as those from the middle space (Antar&icirc;k<u>s</u>a); strike the ground thrice with the left heel and thus destroy the Terrene obstacles. Then touching the left branch on the left side of the chouk&acirc;<u>t</u>, put the right foot forward and enter into the Ma<u>nd</u>apa. Then instal the S&#146;&acirc;nti Kumbha (the peace jar) and offer the ordinary Arghya (S&acirc;m&acirc;ny&acirc;rgha). Next worship the V&acirc;stun&acirc;tha and Padmayoni with flowers and &Acirc;tapa rice and the Arghya water, on the south-west and then purify the Pa<u>n</u>cha Gavya. Next sprinkle all the Ma<u>nd</u>apa and the entrance gate with that Arghya water. And, while sprinkling with Arghya water, consider the whole space right through as inspired with the presence of the Dev&icirc; and repeat the M&ucirc;la Mantra with devotion and sprinkle with Pha<u>t</u> mantra. The Kart&acirc;, then, uttering the mantra &#147;Pha<u>t</u>,&#148; is to drive away all the evils from the Ma<u>nd</u>apa and uttering the mantra &#147;H&ucirc;m&#148; sprinkle water, all around, thus pacifying the atmosphere and bringing peace into the hearts of all present.</p>

Then he should bow down to his own Guru and take his seat humbly on the soft &Acirc;sanam allotted to him with his face eastwards and meditate on the Deity (&Icirc;<u>st</u>a Deva) of the mantra that is to be imparted to the disciple. After meditating thus, he is to do the Bh&ucirc;ta s&#146;&ucirc;ddhi (purification of elements) and perform Ny&acirc;sa, etc., of the Deya mantra (the mantra that is to be imparted to the disciple) according to the rules stated below, i.e., the Ri<u>s</u>i on the head; the chhandas in the mouth, the &Icirc;<u>st</u>a Devat&acirc; in the heart, B&icirc;ja on the anus and S&#146;akti Ny&acirc;sa on the two legs.

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">107-134. O N&acirc;rada! Next purify the sacrificial ladles, etc., sruk, sruva, etc., and ghee; then, taking ghee by sruva, go on with the Homa ceremony. Divide the ghee of the &Acirc;jyasth&acirc;l&icirc; (the vessel in which the ghee for the Homa purposes is kept) in three parts; take ghee from the right side and saying &#147;O<u>m</u> Agnaye Sv&acirc;h&acirc;&#148; offer oblations on the right eye of the Ag<u>n</u>i; take ghee from the left side and saying &#147;Om Som&acirc;ye Sv&acirc;h&acirc;&#148; offer oblations on the left eye of the Ag<u>n</u>i; take ghee from the centre and saying, &#147;O<u>m</u> Agni<u>s</u>om&acirc;bhy&acirc;<u>m</u> Sv&acirc;h&acirc;,&#148; offer oblations on the central eye of the Agni. Take ghee again from the right side and saying &#147;O<u>m</u> Agnaye Svi<u>st</u>ak<u>r</u>ite Sv&acirc;h&acirc;&#148; offer oblations to the mouth of the Ag<u>n</u>i. Then the devotee is to repeat &#147;O<u>m</u> Bhu<u>h</u> Sv&acirc;h&acirc;,&#148; &#147;O<u>m</u> Bhuva<u>h</u> Sv&acirc;h&acirc;,&#148; &#147;O<u>m</u> Sva<u>h</u> Sv&acirc;h&acirc;&#148; and offer thrice the oblations; next he is to offer oblations thrice with the Ag<u>n</u>i mantra. After this, O Muni! for impregnation and each of the ten Samsk&acirc;ras, natal-ceremony, tonsure, etc., he is to repeat the Pra<u>n</u>ava Mantra and offer the eight oblations of ghee on each occasion. Now hear of the tenfold Sa<u>m</u>sk&acirc;ras :-- (1) Impregnation, (2) Pu<u>m</u>savan (a ceremony performed as soon as a woman perceives the foetus to be quick), (3) S&icirc;mantonnayana (a ceremony observed by women in the fourth, sixth or the eighth month of pregnancy), (4) J&acirc;ta Karma (ceremony at the birth of a child), (5) N&acirc;makara<u>n</u>a, (naming the child), (6) Ni<u>s</u>kr&acirc;ma<u>n</u>a (a ceremony performed when a new-born child is first taken out of the house into the open air usually in the fourth month), (7) Annapr&acirc;s&#146;ana (when the rice is put in the mouth of the child), (8) Ch&ucirc;<u>d</u>&acirc;kara<u>n</u>a (the ceremony of the first tonsure), (9) Upanayana (holding the sacrificial thread; (10) God&acirc;na and Udv&acirc;ha (gift of cows and marriage). These are stated in the Vedas. Next worship S&#146;iva P&acirc;rvat&icirc;, the Father and the Mother of Ag<u>n</u>i and take leave of them. Next in the name of Ag<u>n</u>i, offer five Samidhas (fuel) soaked in ghee and offer one oblation of ghee to each of the &Acirc;vara<u>n</u>a Devat&acirc;s.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">Then take the ghee by the S&#146;ruk and covering it with the S&#146;ruva, offer ten oblations to Ag<u>n</u>i, and Mah&acirc; Ganes&#146;a with mantras ending in Vau<u>s</u>a<u>t</u>,</p>

Next offer twenty-five oblations to his face, repeating the M&ucirc;la Mantra. Then think of that and Ag<u>n</u>i Deva as one and the same, and then again as one with &Acirc;tman. Then offer oblations to each of the <u>S</u>a<u>d</u>a<u>m</u>ga Devat&acirc;s separately. Then search for the N&acirc;dis (veins) of Vah<u>n</u>i and &Icirc;<u>st</u>a Devat&acirc; and offer twenty one oblations. Then offer oblations to each of the two Devat&acirc;s separately. Next offer one thousand and eight oblations to the &Icirc;<u>st</u>a Deva with Til soaked in ghee or with the materials enumerated in the Kalpa. O Muni! Thus finishing the Homa ceremony, consider that the &Icirc;<u>st</u>a Deva (the Dev&icirc;), Ag<u>n</u>i and the &Acirc;vara<u>n</u>a Deities are all satisfied. Then, by the command of the Guru, the disciple is to take his bath and perform his Sandhy&acirc;, etc., and put on new clothes (cloth and ch&acirc;dar) and golden ornaments. He is to come then, to the Ku<u>nd</u>a with Kama<u>nd</u>alu in his hand and with a pure heart. He is to bow down to the elders and superiors seated in the assembly and take his seat in his &Acirc;sana. S&#146;r&icirc; Guru Deva then would look at the disciple with kind eyes and think the Chaitanya of the disciple within his own (the Guru&#146;s) body. Then the Guru Deva would perform the Homa and look at the disciple with a divine gaze, so that the disciple becomes pure-hearted and able to get the favours of the Devas. Thus the Guru must purify all the Adhvas (the passages) of the body of the disciple.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">Then the Guru is to touch respectively the feet, generative organ, navel, heart, forehead, and the head of the disciple with K&ucirc;rcha (a bundle of Kus&#146;a grass) and til soaked in ghee, in his left hand and offer at each touch eight oblations, repeating the mantra &#147;O<u>m</u> adya S&#146;i<u>s</u>yasya Kal&acirc;dhv&acirc;nam S&#146;odhay&acirc;mi Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, etc.&#148; Thus the Guru would purify Kal&acirc;dhva (in the feet) Tattv&acirc;dhva (in the generative organ), Bh&ucirc;van&acirc;dhva (in the navel), Var<u>n</u>&acirc;dhva (in the heart), Pad&acirc;dhva (in the fore-head) and Mantr&acirc;dhva (on the head), the six Adhv&acirc;s and think these all to be dissolved in Brahm&acirc; (Brahmal&icirc;na).</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">135-155. Then, again, the Guru would think all these to be re-born from Brahm&acirc; and transfer the Chaitanya of the disciple that was in him to the disciple. Then the Guru must offer P&ucirc;r<u>n</u>&acirc;huti and consider</p>

He is to perform again the Vy&acirc;rhiti Homa and offer all the A<u>m</u>g&acirc;hutis (oblations to all the limbs) of the fire and take leave of the fire withdrawing the Deity from the jar, into his own body. Uttering then the Vau<u>s</u>a<u>t</u> Mantra he would tie the eyes of the disciple with a piece of cloth and would bring him from the Ku<u>nd</u>a to the ma<u>nd</u>ala and make the disciple offer pu<u>s</u>p&acirc;<u>n</u>jali (flowers in his palm) to the &Icirc;<u>st</u>a deva. Then he would take away the bandage or piece of cloth from his eyes and ask him to take his seat in the seat Kus&acirc;sana. Thus the Guru, after having purified the elements of the body of the disciple and performed the Ny&acirc;sa of the Deya Mantra, would make the disciple sit in another ma<u>nd</u>ala. Then he would touch the head of the disciple with the twigs (Pallavas) of the Ku<u>nd</u>a and repeat the M&acirc;trik&acirc; Mantra and make him have his bath with the water of the jar which is considered as the seat of the &Icirc;<u>st</u>a Deva. Then, for the protection of the disciple, he would sprinkle (abhi<u>s</u>eka) him with the water of the Vardhani vessel placed already in the north-east corner. Then the disciple would get up and put on the pair of new clothes and besmear his whole body with ashes and sit close by the Guru. When the merciful Guru would consider that the S&#146;iva S&#146;akti has now passed out of his own body and that Divine Force, the Dev&icirc;, has entered into the body of the disciple, i.e., charged the disciple with the pass. Thinking now the disciple and the Devat&acirc; to be one and the same, the Guru would now worship the disciple with flowers and scents. The Guru would then place his right hand on the head of the disciple and repeat clearly in his right ear the Mah&acirc; Mantra of the Mah&acirc; Dev&icirc; . The disciple is to repeat also the Mah&acirc; Mantra one hundred and eight times and fall prostrate on the ground before the Guru and thus bow down to the Guru, whom the disciple now thinks as the incarnate of the Deva.</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">The disciple, the devotee of the Guru, would now give as a Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>&acirc; all his wealth and property for his whole life to the Guru. Then he would give Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>&acirc; to the priests and make charities to the virgins; the Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>as, the poor and the destitute and the orphans. Here he is not to be miserly in any way in the expenditure. O N&acirc;rada! Thus the disciple would consider himself blessed and he would daily remain engaged in repeating the Mah&acirc; Mantra. Thus I have described to you above</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">The most excellent D&icirc;k<u>s</u>&acirc;. Thinking all these, you are to remain ever engaged in worshipping the lotus feet of the Great Dev&icirc;.

Thus all the S&#146;&acirc;stras say. And this is the San&acirc;tan Creed. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<u>n</u>a said :-- O N&acirc;rada! I have described all about the ordinary D&icirc;k<u>s</u>&acirc; that you questioned me. Now the essence in brief is this that you would remain always merged in worshipping the Par&acirc; S&#146;akti, the Highest Force, the Mah&acirc; Dev&icirc;. What more shall I say than this that I have got the highest pleasure and the Nirv&acirc;na, the peace, that passeth all understanding, from my daily worshipping That Lotus Feet duly.

After having said this D&icirc;k<u>s</u>&acirc;tattva, the highest Yogi Bhagav&acirc;n N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<u>n</u>a, meditated by the Yogis, closed his eyes and remained merged in Sam&acirc;dhi, in the meditation of the Lotus Feet of the Dev&icirc;.</p>
