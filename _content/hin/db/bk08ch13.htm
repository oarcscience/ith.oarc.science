<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">2-36. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<u>n</u>a spoke thus :-- The very vast Ghrita S&acirc;gara (the ocean of clarified butter) is encircling the Kus&#146;a Dv&icirc;pa. Next to it is the Krau<u>n</u>cha Dv&icirc;pa. It is twice as large as Kus&#146;a. The K<u>s</u>&icirc;ra S&acirc;gara (the ocean of milk) is surrounding this Dv&icirc;pa. The Krau<u>n</u>cha mountain is standing here. The name of this Dv&icirc;pa is derived from this mountain. In days gone by, the highly intelligent K&acirc;rtikeya burst this mountain by his own prowess. This Dv&icirc;pa is washed by the K<u>s</u>&icirc;ra S&acirc;gara; and Varu<u>n</u>a is its Regent. The son of Priyavrata, Ghritapri<u>st</u>ha, respected by all and whose prosperity knows no end, is the Lord of this Dv&icirc;pa. He divided this Dv&icirc;pa into the seven parts and distributed them to his sons and named the Var<u>s</u>as after the names of his sons. He made his sons the rulers of those places and he himself took the refuge of the Bhagav&acirc;n N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<u>n</u>a The names of the seven Var<u>s</u>as are respectively :-- &Acirc;ma, Madhuruha, Meghapri<u>st</u>ha, Sudh&acirc;maka, Bhr&acirc;ji<u>st</u>ha, Lohit&acirc;r<u>n</u>a, and Vanaspati. O N&acirc;rada! The seven mountains and the rivers there are very celebrated throughout the worlds. The names of the mountains are :-- S&#146;&ucirc;kla, Vardham&acirc;na, Bhojana, Upavarha<u>n</u>a, Nanda, Nandana, and Sarvatobhadra. The names of the rivers are :-- Abhay&acirc;, Amritaugh&acirc;, &Acirc;ryak&acirc;, T&icirc;rthavat&icirc;, Vrittir&ucirc;pavat&icirc;, S&#146;ukl&acirc;, and Pavitravatik&acirc;. The inhabitants there drink</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">the highly pure water of these rivers. The people there are divided into four colours Puru<u>s</u>a, Ri<u>s</u>abha, Dravi<u>n</u>a, and Vedaka and they worship the Bhagav&acirc;n Varu<u>n</u>a, of the form of water. Then they become very discriminative, and, with great devotion, and holding full within their folded palms the water, repeat the following mantra :-- &#147;O Water! Thou art the essence V&icirc;rya of the Person Bhagav&acirc;na and Thou sanctifiest the Bh&ucirc;rloka, Bhuvarloka, and Svarloka. Thou destroyest the sins of all. We all are touching it; purify our bodies.&#148; After finishing their mantrams, they sing various hymns to Varu<u>n</u>a. Next to the K<u>s</u>iroda S&acirc;gara, is the S&#146;aka Dv&icirc;pa, thirty two lakh yoyanas wide, surrounded by the Dadhi S&acirc;gara (the ocean of curds), of similar dimensions. Here the most excellent tree named the S&#146;aka tree exists. O N&acirc;rada! The Dv&icirc;pa is named so after the tree. Medh&acirc;tithi, the son of Priyavrata is the Lord of this Dv&icirc;pa. He divided this land into the seven Var<u>s</u>as and distributed each to his seven sons respectively; and ultimately he took refuge to the path of Yoga. The names of the seven Var<u>s</u>as are Purojava, Manojava, Pavam&acirc;naka, Dh&ucirc;mr&acirc;n&icirc;ka, Chitrarepha, Bahur&ucirc;pa, and Vis&#146;vadhrik. In these Var<u>s</u>as there are seven mountains, one in each Var<u>s</u>a, as forming their boundaries; and there are seven rivers also. The names of the mountains are :-- &Icirc;s&#146;ana, &Ucirc;rus&#146;ri<u>n</u>ga, Valabhadra, S&#146;ata Kes&#146;ara, Sahasra-srotaka, Devap&acirc;la, and Mah&acirc;sana; the names of the rivers are :-- Anagh&acirc;, &Acirc;yurd&acirc;, Ubhayaspri<u>st</u>i, Apar&acirc;jit&acirc;, Pa&ntilde;chapad&icirc;, and Sahasras&#146;ruti and Nijadhriti. These seven rivers are all very big and resplendent with lustre. The people are divided into four classes :-- Var<u>s</u>as, Satyavrata, Kratuvrata, D&acirc;navrata, and A<u>n</u>uvrata. They all take the Pr&acirc;<u>n</u>ay&acirc;ma exercise and thereby bring the R&acirc;jas, and Tamo Gu<u>n</u>a under their subjection and they worship Hari, of the nature of Pr&acirc;<u>n</u>a Vayu, Higher than the Highest. Their mantra is this :-- &#147;He has entered into all the living beings and nourishes them by the Pr&acirc;<u>n</u>a and other faculties; He is the Internal Ruler of all and the Supreme Controller; this Universe is under His control; let Him protect and nourish us.&#148; O N&acirc;rada! Next to this Dadhi S&acirc;gara is Pu<u>s</u>kara Dv&icirc;pa; it is twice as large as S&#146;&acirc;ka Dv&icirc;pa. It is surrounded by the Dudha S&acirc;gar (the ocean of milk) all twice as large. The leaves of Pu<u>s</u>kara tree that shines in the Pu<u>s</u>kara Dv&icirc;pa, are fiery like golden flames; they are as clean and pure. Crores and crores of leaves, golden in colour ornament this Tree. V&acirc;sudeva, the Guru of all the Lokas, has created this Pu<u>s</u>kara Dv&icirc;pa as the seat of Parame<u>st</u>h&icirc; Brahm&acirc;, possessed of six extraordinary powers, for the purpose of creation. There is one mountain in this Dv&icirc;pa; it is divided into two parts, named Arv&acirc;ch&icirc;na and Par&acirc;ch&icirc;na. These form the boundaries of the two Var<u>s</u>as. The</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">mountain is one Ayuta Yoyana high and one Ayuta Yoyana wide. There are four cities on the four sides. Indra and the three other Lokap&acirc;las are the lords of these cities. The Sun God comes out from their top and circumambulating Meru, goes there again. The whole year is his Chakram, circle of circuit; His path is Uttr&acirc;ya<u>n</u>am and Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>&acirc;ya<u>n</u>am. V&icirc;tihotra, the son of Priyavrata is the lord of this island. He distributed the two Var<u>s</u>as amongst his two sons, Rama<u>n</u>a and Dh&acirc;tak&icirc;. They rule over the two Var<u>s</u>as named also after them. Like the inhabitants of the above Var<u>s</u>as, the people also get powers of themselves and worship devotedly the God seated on the lotus and follow such path of the Yoga as leads them to the Brahm&acirc; S&acirc;loky&acirc;, etc. The mantra runs thus :-- &#147;We bow down to that One God, without a Second, of the nature of Peace, Who is the Fruit of all the Karmas, Who is the seat of illumination of Brahm&acirc;, Who is established in Unity, and Who is worshipped by all the Lokas.&#148;</p>

<p>Here ends the Thirteenth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the description of the remaining Dv&icirc;pas in the Mah&acirc;pur&acirc;<u>n</u>am S&#146;r&icirc; Mad Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vy&acirc;sa.</p>
