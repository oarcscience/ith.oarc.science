I have heard about the glories of Hari, about the Tattvaj&ntilde;&acirc;nam (the True Knowledge) and the story of Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;. Now tell me Her Dhy&acirc;nam (meditation) and Stotram (recitation of hymns) of Her. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<u>n</u>a said :-- O N&acirc;rada! Indra then, bathed first in the T&icirc;rath (holy place) and, wearing a cleansed cloth, installed, first of all, an earthen jar (gha<u>t</u>a) on the beach of the K<u>s</u>iroda Ocean. Then he worshipped with devotion Ganes&#146;a, S&ucirc;rya, Fire, Vi<u>sn</u>u, S&#146;iva, and S&#146;iv&acirc;, the six deities with scents and flowers. Next Indra invoked Mah&acirc; Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;, of the nature of the highest powers and greatest prosperity, and began to worship Her as Brahm&acirc;, who was acting as an officiating priest in the presence of the Munis, Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>as, Brihaspati, Hari and the other Devas, had dictated him. He first smeared one P&acirc;rij&acirc;ta flower with sandal paste and reciting the meditation mantra of Mah&acirc; Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc; offered it to Her feet. The meditation mantra that was recited by Devendra, was what Bhagav&acirc;n Hari first gave to Brahm&acirc;. I am now telling you that. Listen.</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&#147;O Mother! Thou residest on the thousand-petalled lotus. The beauty of Thy face excels the beauty of ko<u>t</u>i autumnal Full Moons. Thou art shining with Thy own splendour. Thou art very beautiful and lovely; Thy colour is like the burnished gold; Thou art with form, chaste, ornamented all over with jewel ornaments; Thou art wearing the yellow cloth and look! What beauty is coming out of it! Always a sweet smile reigns on Thy lips. Thy beauty is constant; Thou art the bestower of prosperity to all. O Mah&acirc; Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;! I meditate on Thee.&#148; Thus meditating on Her endowed with various attributes with this mantra, Indra worshipped devotedly with sixteen upach&acirc;ras (articles offered). Every upach&acirc;ra (article) was offered with the repetition of mantra. All the things were very excellent, right and commendable. &#147;O Mah&acirc; Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;!</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">cept. O Dev&icirc;! I am presenting to Thee these pure garlands of flowers which blossom in different seasons, which look very beautiful and which give satisfaction to the Devas and to the kings. Accept. O Dev&icirc;! I am presenting to Thee this nice scent, this very holy thing to Thee by which both the body and mind become pure, which is most auspicious and which is prepared of many fragrant herbs and plants; accept.

I am presenting to Thee all those things that are extraordinary, very rare in this earth and fit to be enjoyed by the Devas and worthy of their ornaments; accept.&#148; O Devar<u>s</u>i! Uttering those mantras, the Devendra offered those articles, with intense devotion according to the rules. He, then, made Japam of the M&ucirc;la Mantra (the Radical Seed Mantra) ten lakhs of times. Thus his Mantra revealed the Deity thereof and thus came to a successful issue. The lotus born Brahm&acirc; gave this Mantra &#147;S&#146;r&icirc;m Hr&icirc;m Kl&icirc;m Aim Kamal&acirc;v&acirc;sinyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;&#148; to the Devendra. This is like a Kalpavrik<u>s</u>a (the tree in Indra&#146;s garden yielding whatever may be desired). This Vaidik mantra is the chief of the mantras. The word &#147;Sv&acirc;h&acirc;&#148; is at the end of the mantra. By virtue of this Mantra, Kuvera got his highest prosperity. By the power of this Mantra, the King-Emperor Dak<u>s</u>a S&acirc;var<u>n</u>i Manu and Mangala became the lords of the earth with seven islands. Priyavrata, Utt&acirc;nap&acirc;da, and Ked&acirc;rar&acirc;ja all these became Siddhas (were fructified with success) and became King-Emperors. O N&acirc;rada! When Indra attained success in this Mantra, there appeared before him Mah&acirc; Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;, seated in the celestial car, decked with excellent gems and jewels. The Great Halo, coming out of Her body made manifest the earth with seven islands. Her colour was white like the white champaka flower and Her whole body was decked with ornaments. Her face was always gracious and cheerful with sweet smiles. She was ever ready to shew Her kindness to the Bhaktas. On Her neck there was a garland of jewels and gems, bright as ten million Moons. O Devar<u>s</u>i! No sooner did Indra see that World Mother Mah&acirc; Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;, of a peaceful appearance, than his body was filled with joy and the hairs of the body stood on ends. His eyes were filled with tears; and, with folded palms, he began to recite stotras to Her, the Vaidik stotras, yielding all desires, that was communicated to him by Brahm&acirc;.</p>

Thou art the wealth of all; Thou art worshipped by all; Thou bestowest to all the bliss and devotion to S&#146;r&icirc; Hari. I bow down to Thee. O Dev&icirc;! Thou always dwellest on the breast of Kri<u>sn</u>a and exercisest Thy powers over Him. Thou art the beauty of the Moon; Thou takest Thy seat on the beautiful Jewel Lotus. Obeisance to Thee! O Dev&icirc;! Thou art the Presiding Deity of the riches; Thou art the Great Dev&icirc;; Thou increasest always Thy gifts and Thou art the bestower of increments. So I bow down to Thee. O Dev&icirc;! Thou art the Mah&acirc; Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc; of Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha, the Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc; of the K<u>s</u>iroda Ocean; Thou art Indra&#146;s Heavenly Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;; Thou art the R&acirc;ja Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc; of the Kings; Thou art the Griha Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc; of the householders; Thou art the household Deity of them; Thou art the Surabh&icirc;, born of the Ocean; Thou art the Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>&acirc;, the wife of the Sacrifices; Thou art Aditi, the Mother of the Devas; Thou art the Kamal&acirc;, always dwelling in the Lotus; Thou art the Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, in the offerings with clarified butter in the sacrificial ceremonies; Thou art the Svadh&acirc; Mantra in the K&acirc;vyas (an offering of food to deceased ancestors). So obeisance to Thee! O Mother Thou art of the nature of Vi<u>sn</u>u; Thou art the Earth that supports all; Thou art of pure S&#146;uddha Sattva and Thou art devoted to N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<u>n</u>a. Thou art void of anger, jealousy. Rather Thou grantest boons to all. Thou art the auspicious S&acirc;rad&acirc;; Thou grantest the Highest Reality and the devotional service to Hari. Without Thee all the worlds are quite stale, to no purpose like ashes, always dead while existing. Thou art the Chief Mother, the Chief Friend of all; Thou art the source of Dharma, Artha, K&acirc;ma and Mok<u>s</u>a! As a mother nourishes her infants with the milk of her breasts, so Thou nourishest all as their mother! A child that sucks the milk might be saved by the Daiva (Fate), when deprived of its mother; but men can never be saved, if they be bereft of Thee! O Mother! Thou art always gracious. Please be gracious unto me. O Eternal One! My possessions are now in the hands of the enemies. Be kind enough to restore my kingdoms to me from my enemies&#146; hands. O Beloved of Hari! Since Thou hast forsaken me, I am wandering abroad, friendless, like a beggar, deprived of all prosperities. O Dev&icirc;! Give me J&ntilde;&acirc;nam, Dharma, my desired fortune, power, influence and my possessions.&#148; O N&acirc;rada! Indra and all the other Devas bowed down frequently to Mah&acirc; Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc; with their eyes filled with tears. Brahm&acirc;, S&#146;ankara, Ananta Deva, Dharma and Kes&#146;ava all asked pardon again and again from Mah&acirc; Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;. Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc; then granted boons to the Devas and before</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">the assembly gladly gave the garland of flowers on the neck of Ke&#146;sava. The Devas, satisfied, went back to their own places. The Dev&icirc;, Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;, too, becoming very glad went to S&#146;r&icirc; Hari sleeping in the K<u>s</u>iroda  Ocean. Brahm&acirc; and Mahes&#146;vara, both became very glad and, blessing the Devas, went respectively to their own abodes. Whoever recites this holy Stotra three times a day, becomes the King Emperor and gets prosperity and wealth like the God Kuvera. Siddhi (success) comes to him who recites this stotra five lakhs of times. If anybody reads regularly and always this Siddha Stotra for one month, he becomes very happy and he turns out a R&acirc;jar&acirc;jendra.</p>
