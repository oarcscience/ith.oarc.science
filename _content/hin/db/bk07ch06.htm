<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">1-3. Janamejaya said :-- &#147;O Muni! How did Mahar<u>s</u>i Chyavana make these twin Devas drink Soma and how his words came out to be true. Human strength is insignificant compared to Indra's strength. Indra forbade the physicians, the As'vins, to drink the Soma juice. How then could the Muni give the right thereof. This is very wonderful. Therefore, O Thou, devoted to Dharma! O Lord! Describe in detail the doings of this Mahar<u>s</u>i Chyavana. I am very anxious to hear it.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">4-10. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! In that famous sacrifice of the King S&#146;ary&acirc;ti, Chyavana Ri<u>s</u>i did wonderful feats. O Bharata! I am now</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">narrating to you his entirely wonderful character. Hear it attentively. Mahar<u>s</u>i Chyavana, illustrious like the Devas, began to enjoy with a cheerful mind and gladdened heart, with his beautiful wife Sukany&acirc; who was like a Deva Kany&acirc;. Now, once on an occasion, the wife of S'aryati became very anxious and trembling said to her husband weeping :-- &#147;O King! You have betrothed your daughter to the blind Muni Chyavana; now it is your duty to go and enquire whether the daughter is living or is dead. O Lord! What is my beautiful daughter doing with that husband. Please go just now to the Muni's &Acirc;s'rama and see about it. O R&acirc;jar<u>s</u>i! I always burn in pain and agony when I think of her. She must have become very lean and thin due to the troubles of Tapasy&acirc;; please bring her quickly here to my presence. She is suffering an everlasting pain from having an aged blind husband; and it is quite likely she has become very lean and thin, I am anxious, therefore, to see my daughter lean and thin who is wearing barks of trees as her dress.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">11. S'ary&acirc;ti said :-- &#147;O broad-eyed One! I am going gladly just now to see my dear daughter and that Muni of severe vows.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">12-25. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! Thus saying to his wife, distressed with sorrow, the King S'ary&acirc;ti mounted on his chariot and quickly went towards the &Acirc;s&#146;rama of the Chyavana Muni. On reaching there, he saw the Mahar<u>s</u>i Chyavana like a Deva's son. Seeing his body like that of Deva, the King became bewildered and began to think thus :-- &#147;What! Has my daughter done such an ugly act, blameable in the society! That Muni was very calm and quiet, penniless and very old; my daughter, perhaps, being overpowered with passion, killed him and has taken, no doubt, another husband. It is indeed difficult to control the God of Love, armed with his flowery bow: the period of youth is moreover very hard to conquer. So this daughter impelled by lust has thrown a dreadful stigma on the clear name of the family of the great Manu. Fie on him whose daughter in this world is of a vicious character! It seems that daughters are born for the expiation of all the sins committed by their fathers. But what an unjust act have I committed for my own selfish ends? It is highly incumbent on every father to betroth his daughter with every care possible to a bridegroom suitable in every respect; but I did not do it and now have got&#160; the fruits equivalent to my doing. If I kill my daughter, vicious and unchaste, I will incur sin due to killing a woman and moreover my daughter. I am the cause of this stain on Muni's line of descent. On the one hand, the scandal on one is very powerful; and the affection for a daughter is strong on</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">the other. What am I to do now?&#148; The King became merged in deep thoughts. At this time Sukany&acirc; accidentally saw her father thus drowned in anxious thoughts. Seeing him, Sukany&acirc; instantly came to her father's side and asked the King in sweet affectionate words. O King! How is it that your face has become so pale with anxious thoughts, seeing the Muni sitting in front of you, a young man with lotus-eyes. O Father! What are you thinking? You belong to the famous Manu's family; besides, you are a high-minded man; you ought not to be sad so suddenly; come quickly and bow your head down before my husband.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">26. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the daughter's words, the King became impatient with anger and began to speak to her :-- </p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">27-36. O Daughter! Where is that aged blind ascetic Muni Chyavana and who is this youth intoxicated with lust? A great doubt has arisen in my mind. O Vicious Soul! Have you slain that Chyavana Muni and engaged yourself in such a sinful act? O You, a Disgrace to your family! Have you accepted another husband out of your desire of lust? My mind has became very much troubled on not seeing that Muni in this &Acirc;s'rama. O vicious One! Now I don't see the Muni; but instead of him, I see this bright person. And thus it is on account of your sinful behaviour that my mind is drowned in the ocean of cares. Then hearing her father's words, Sukany&acirc; smiled and gladly took him at once to her husband and said :-- &#147;O Father! He is your son-in-law; He is the same Chyavana Muni; there is no doubt here. The twin As'vins have given him this beautiful lustre and lotus-like eyes. The two As'vini Kum&acirc;ras came accidentally to my &Acirc;srama and out of mercy no doubt they have made Chyavana such a nice young man. O King! I am not your that daughter that will do a vicious act as you think, beguiled by this beautiful form of the Muni. Father! Bow down before the Chyavana Muni. Ask him and he will tell you everything.&#148; Hearing thus the daughter's words, the King went instantly to the Muni and bowed down before him and asked him affectionately thus :-- </p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">37-38. The King said :-- &#147;O Son of Bhrigu! How have you got your eyes back? Where has your old age gone? Kindly narrate all your details as early as possible. O Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>a! Seeing your exquisitely beautiful form, a great doubt has arisen in me; so tell me everything in detail; I will be very glad, no doubt.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">39-45. Chyavana said :-- &#147;O King! The two As'vins, the physicians of the Gods, came here on their own account and have done me</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'"><A NAME="page_615"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 615</FONT></A></p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">this good out of their mercy. Owing to the benefit thus received, I have granted them the boon that I will make them drink the Soma juice in the Agni<u>st</u>oma Yaj&ntilde;a of the King S'ary&acirc;ti. Thus I have got these beautiful eyes and the new youth; therefore, O King! Collect yourself and sit in the holy sacrificial seat.&#148; When the Br&acirc;hmi<u>n</u> Chyavana Muni spoke thus, the King S'ary&acirc;ti and his dear wife sat with greatest pleasure and began to talk on auspicious topics with the high-souled Muni. Then the Bh&acirc;rgava consoled the King and said I will perform your sacrifice; please collect all the necessary materials. I have promised to the As'vins that certainly I will make them drink the Soma juice. Therefore, O King! I will have to carry that out in your sacrifice. O King! If Indra be angry, I will stop him by my Tapas force and in the Agni<u>st</u>oma Yaj&ntilde;a I will make the As'vins drink Soma.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">46-58. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! S'ary&acirc;ti, the lord of the earth, then gladly approved the proposals of Chyavana Muni. The King then shewed respects to the Muni and, with a pleasant attitude of mind, returned to his city with his wife, all the while talking of the Muni on the way. On a good auspicious day he, possessed of enormous wealth and prosperity prepared an excellent place for the performance of the sacrifice. The Muni Chyavana then invited Vas'i<u>st</u>ha and other respectable Munis and initiated the King S'ary&acirc;ti for the performance of the sacrifice. At the commencement of the sacrifice, Indra and the other Devas and the two As'vins all came to the sacrifice to drink Soma. Seeing the As'vins, Indra became afraid and asked the other Devas, &#147;Why have the As'vins come here?&#148; They are the physicians and, therefore, never fit to drink Soma. Who has brought them hither at this great Agni<u>st</u>oma Sacrifice? The Devas remained all silent. Chyavana Muni then became ready to offer Soma to the As'vins and Indra immediately stopped him saying :-- They are already prohibited to drink Soma as a sacrificial share; so do not accept the vessel of Soma for them. Chyavana then said :-- &#147;O Lord of S'ach&icirc;! These are the S&ucirc;rya's sons; tell, then, truly why these are rendered unfit to drink Soma. They are not of mixed blood; they are born of the legal wife of S&ucirc;rya Deva. O Lord of the Devas! What is the fault then, of the As'vins, the physicians, that they be prohibited to drink Soma juice. Please reply. O Indra! This point must be settled by all the Devas here. I have promised to make them drink the Soma juice in this sacrifice. To keep my word I have initiated the King in this sacrifice. I will have my word fulfilled; there is no doubt in this. O Indra! They have given me my youth and bestowed my eyes and have done me great good. I will also do good to them to my best.&#148;</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">59. Indra said :-- &#147;The Devas have appointed these Devas their Physicians; therefore they are looked down upon in the society; so they are unfit to drink Soma. You need not make them drink Soma.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">60-61. Chyavana spoke :-- &#147;O Indra! You have adulterated yourself with Ahaly&acirc;; why are you, then, giving vent to your anger thus in vain. You have treacherously murdered Vritr&acirc;sura; it is quite inappropriate for a vicious person like you to say that the As'vins cannot have the right to drink Soma. This is quite impossible.&#148; O King! On the springing of this dispute, no body spoke to Indra. The illustrious Bh&acirc;rgava, then, made them accept the Soma juice.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p>Here ends the Sixth Chapter of the Seventh Book on granting the As'vins the right to drink the Soma juice in S'r&icirc; Mad Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam, the Mah&acirc; Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>am, of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vy&acirc;sa.</p>
