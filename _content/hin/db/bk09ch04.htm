Now may I ask you which Dev&icirc; of these five Prakritis has been worshipped by what Mantra? and by whom? How has each of them been praised? and by whom? How has the worship of their M&ucirc;rtis (form) become prevalent in this world? What are the Stotram (hymn of praise), the Dhy&acirc;n (meditation) glory and life of these? Also what sort of boon do each of the Dev&icirc;s grant? and to whom? Kindly describe all these in detail.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">4-29. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Child! Durg&acirc;, the mother of Ga<u>n</u>es'a, R&acirc;dh&acirc;, Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc;, Sarasvat&icirc; and S&acirc;vitr&icirc;, these are the five Prakritis sprung directly from M&ucirc;la Prakriti. The methods of their worship, wonderful glorious acts, excellent stotrams, and their lives, inculcating good to all, and sweet like nectar are all widely written in the Vedas, Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>as, Tantras and other S'&acirc;stras. So there is no need to describe them here again. Now I am describing in detail the auspicious character of these that are sprung from the parts and Kal&acirc;s of the Prakriti. Hear attentively. K&acirc;l&icirc;, Vasundhar&acirc;, Gang&acirc;, <u>S</u>a<u>st</u>h&icirc;, Mangal Cha<u>nd</u>ik&acirc;, Tulas&icirc;, Manas&acirc;, Nidr&acirc;, Svadh&acirc;, Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, and Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>&acirc;, these are the parts of Prakriti. By and by I will describe, briefly, the merit-giving characters and pleasant to hear. Along with these I will describe the Karmas of the J&icirc;vas, and the great exalted lives of Durg&acirc; and R&acirc;dh&acirc;. I am now describing Sarasvat&icirc;'s character. Hear, O Muni! S'r&icirc; Kri<u>sn</u>a introduced first in this Bh&acirc;rata, the worship of the Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc;, the holder of V&icirc;<u>n</u>&acirc; in Her hands, under whose influence, the hearts of illiterate stupid persons become illumined with knowledge. The amorous Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc; sprang from the end of the lips of R&acirc;dh&acirc; and so she desired to marry Kri<u>sn</u>a out of amorous feelings. S'ri Kri<u>sn</u>a, the controller of the hearts of all, knew it instantly and addressed the Mother of the people in true words proper to Her and beneficial to Her in the end. O Chaste One! The four-armed N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<u>n</u>a is born from My parts; He is young, of good</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">features and endowed with all qualifications; so much so, he is like Me. He is a Knower of amorous sentiments of women and He fulfils those desires; what to speak of His beauty, ten millions of the God of love are playing in His body. O Beloved! And if you desire to marry and remain with Me, that will not be of any good to you. For R&acirc;dh&acirc; is near to Me; She is more powerful than you. If a man be stronger than another, he can rescue one who takes his shelter; but if he be weaker, how can he then, himself weak, protect his dependant from others. Though I am the Lord of all, and rule all, yet I cannot control R&acirc;dh&acirc;. For She is equal to me in power, in beauty, in qualifications, equal to Me in every respect. Again it is impossible for Me to quit R&acirc;dh&acirc; for She is the presiding Deity of My life. Who can relinquish life? Though a son is very dear to his father, still it may be questioned, is he dearer than his father's life? So, O Auspicious One! Go to the abode Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha; you will get your desires fulfilled there. You will get for your husband the Lord of Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha and you will live ever in peace and enjoy happiness. Though Lak<u>s</u>m&icirc; is residing there yet like you she is not under the control of lust, anger, greed, delusion and vanity. She is also equal to you in beauty, qualities, and power. So you will live with her in great delight and Hari, the Lord of Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha, will treat both of you equally. Moreover, I say this in particular that in every universe, on the fifth day of the bright fortnight of the month of M&acirc;gha, every year, the day when the learning is commenced, a great festival will be held and men, Manus, Devas, and the Munis desirous of liberation, Vasus, Yogis, N&acirc;gas, Siddhas, Gandarbhas, R&acirc;k<u>s</u>asas, all will perform your worship with devotion in every Kalpa till the time of Mah&acirc; Pralaya comes. All are required to be Jitendriya (having their senses under control) and Samyam&icirc; (concentrating his mind, and with a religious vow) and they will invoke Thee on a jar or on books and then meditate according to what is stated in the Ka<u>n</u>va S'&acirc;kh&acirc; of Yajurveda and then worship and sing hymns to Thee. Thy Kavacha (an armour; a mystical syllable ** considered as a preservative like armour) is written on the bark of the Bh&ucirc;rja tree and then with eight kinds of scents mingled with it is placed within a golden nut or ring named M&acirc;duli and then held on the neck or on the right arm. The learned should recite Thy Stotras during worship. Thus saying, the Pura<u>n</u> Brahm&acirc; S'r&icirc; Kri<u>sn</u>a Himself worshipped the Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc;. Since then, Brahm&acirc;, Vi<u>sn</u>u, Mahes'a, Ananta Deva, Dharma, Sanaka and other Mun&icirc;ndras, all the Devas, Munis, all the kings and all the human beings are worshipping the Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc;. O N&acirc;rada! Thus the worship of the Eternal Dev&icirc; is made extant in the three worlds.</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">appropriate offerings of the P&ucirc;j&acirc; flowers, sandalpaste and other good things necessary in these worships and which are so sweet to hear. I am ever very eager and anxious to hear these.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">32-59. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<u>n</u>a said :-- O N&acirc;rada! I am now stating the method of worship of the Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc;, the Mother of the Worlds, according to Ka<u>n</u>va S'&acirc;kh&acirc; of the Yajurveda. Hear. On the day previous to the fifth day of the bright fortnight of the month of M&acirc;gh or the day of commencement of education, the devotee should control his senses, concentrate his mind and take his bath. Then he is to perform his daily duties and install the jar (Gha<u>t</u>a) with devotion and according to the Mantras of the Ka<u>n</u>va S'&acirc;kh&acirc; or the Tantra, as the case may be. He is to worship first on that Ghata (jar) Ga<u>n</u>apati (Ganes'a), then meditate the Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc; as described below, invoke Her and again read the Dhy&acirc;n and then worship with So<u>d</u>as'opach&acirc;ra (sixteen good articles offered in the worship). O Good One! Now I am speaking, according to my knowledge, about the offerings as ordained in the Vedas or Tantras. Hear. Fresh butter, curd, thickened milk, rice freed from the husk by frying, sweetmeats (Til Laddu) prepared of Til, sugar cane, sugarcane juice, nice Gu<u>d</u> (molasses), honey, svastik, sugar, rice (not broken) out of white Dh&acirc;n, chipi<u>t</u>ak of table rice (&Acirc;lo ch&acirc;l), white Modak, Harbi<u>s</u>y&acirc;nna prepared of boiled rice with clarified butter and salt, Pi<u>st</u>aka of jao&acirc; or wheaten flour, Param&acirc;nna with ghee, nectar like sweetmeats, cocoanut, cocoanut water, Svastik Pi<u>st</u>aka, Svastik and ripe plantain Pi<u>st</u>aka, Kaseru (root), M&ucirc;l&acirc;, ginger, ripe plantains, excellent Bel fruit, the jujube fruit, and other appropriate white purified fruits of the season and peculiar to the place are to be offered in the Pooj&acirc;. O N&acirc;rada! White flowers of&#160; good scent, white sandalpaste of good scent, new white clothes, nice conchshell, nice garlands of white flowers, nice white necklaces, and beautiful ornament are to be given to the Dev&icirc;. I say now the Dhy&acirc;nam sweet to hear, of the Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc; according to the Vedas, capable to remove errors! Hear. I hereby bow down to the Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc;, of a white colour, of a smiling countenance and exceedingly beautiful, the lustre of whose body overpowers that of the ten millions of Moons, whose garment is purified by fire, in whose hands there are V&icirc;<u>n</u>&acirc; and books, who is decorated with new excellent ornaments of jewels and pearls and whom Brahm&acirc;, Vi<u>sn</u>u, Mahes'vara and the other Devas, Munis, Manus and men constantly worship. Thus meditating the Dev&icirc;, the intelligent persons should offer all articles, after pronouncing the root Mantra. Then he is to hymn and hold Kavacha and make S&acirc;<u>st</u>&acirc;<u>n</u>ga pra<u>n</u>&acirc;ms before the Dev&icirc;. O Muni! Those whose Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc; is the presiding Deity, are not to be spoken of at all (i.e., they</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'"><A NAME="page_822"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 822</FONT></A></p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">will naturally do all these things and with a greater fervour). Besides all should worship the Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc; on the day of commencement of education and every year on the S'&ucirc;kla Pancham&icirc; day of the month of M&acirc;gh. The eight-lettered Mantra, as mentioned in the Vedas is the root Mantra of Sarasvat&icirc;. (Aim Kl&icirc;m Sarasvatyai nama<u>h</u>). Or the Mantra to which each worshipper is initiated is his M&ucirc;lmantra (not Mantra). Or uttering the Mantra &#147;S'r&icirc;m Hr&icirc;m Sarasvatyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;&#148; one is to offer everything to the Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc;. This Mantra is the Kalpa Vrik<u>s</u>a (i. e., the tree which yields all desires). N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<u>n</u>a, the ocean of mercy, gave in ancient times, this very Mantra to V&acirc;lmik&icirc; in the holy land Bh&acirc;rata Var<u>s</u>a on the banks of the Ganges; next Bhr&icirc;gu gave this Mantra on the occasion of solar eclipse to Mahar<u>s</u>i Sukr&acirc;charya on the Pu<u>s</u>kara T&icirc;rtha; M&acirc;r&icirc;cha gave to Brihaspati on a lunar eclipse; Brahm&acirc; gave to Bhr&icirc;gu in the Vadarik&acirc; &Acirc;s'rama; Jaratkar&acirc; gave to &Acirc;stika on the shore of the K<u>s</u>iroda ocean; Bibh&acirc;n<u>d</u>aka gave this to the intelligent Ri<u>s</u>yasri<u>n</u>ga on the Sumeru mountain, S'iva gave this to Ka<u>n</u>&acirc;da and Gotama, S&ucirc;rya gave to Y&acirc;j&ntilde;avalkya and K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana, Ananta Deva gave to P&acirc;<u>n</u>ini, to the intelligent Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;ja and to S'&acirc;ka<u>t</u>&acirc;yana in Bali's assembly in the P&acirc;t&acirc;la. If this Mantra be repeated four lakhs of times, all men attain success. And when they become Siddhas with this Mantra, they become powerful like Brihaspati. In past times, the Creator Brahm&acirc; gave a Kavacha named Vis'vajaya to Bhr&icirc;gu on the Gandham&acirc;dana Mountain. I now speak of that. Hear.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">60-61. Once on a time Bhr&icirc;gu asked Brahm&acirc; the Lord of all, and adored by all, thus :-- &#147;O Brahm&acirc;n! Thou art the foremost of those that know the Vedas; there is none equal to thee in matters regarding the knowledge of the Vedas (so much so that there is nothing that is not known to thee; for all these have sprung from thee). Now say about the Vis'vajaya Kavacha of the Dev&icirc; Sarasvat&icirc;, that is excellent, without any faults and embodying in it all the properties of all the Mantras.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">62-91. Brahm&acirc; said :-- &#147;O Child! What you have asked about the Kavacha of Sarasvat&icirc; that is sweet to hear, ordained and worshipped by the Vedas, and the giver of all desired fruits, now hear of that. In the very beginning, the all-pervading S'r&icirc; Kri<u>sn</u>a, the Lord of the R&acirc;sa circle, mentioned this Kavacha to me in the holy Brind&acirc;vana forest in the abode Goloka at the time of R&acirc;sa in R&acirc;sa Mandala. This is very secret; it is full of holy unheard, wonderful Mantras. Reading this Kavacha and holding it (on one's arm) Brihaspati has become foremost in matters of intelligence; by the force of this Kavacha S'ukr&acirc;ch&acirc;rya</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">has got his ascendancy over the Daityas; the foremost Muni V&acirc;lmik&icirc; has become eloquent and skilled in language and has become Kav&icirc;ndra and Sv&acirc;yambhuva Manu; holding this Kavacha he has become honoured everywhere. Ka<u>n</u>&acirc;da, Gotama, Ka<u>n</u>va, Pa<u>n</u>ini, S'akat&acirc;yana, Dak<u>s</u>a, and K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana all have become great authors by virtue of this Kavacha; Kri<u>sn</u>a Dvaip&acirc;yana Veda Vy&acirc;sa made the classification of the Vedas and composed the eighteen Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>as. S'&acirc;t&acirc;tapa, Samvarta, Vas'i<u>st</u>ha, Par&acirc;sara and Y&acirc;j&ntilde;avalkya had become authors by holding and reading this Sarasvat&icirc; Kavacha. Ri<u>s</u>yas'ri<u>n</u>ga, Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;ja, &Acirc;stika, Devala, Jaigi<u>s</u>avya, and Y&acirc;y&acirc;ti all were honoured everywhere by virtue of this Kavacha. O Dvija! The Praj&acirc;pati Himself is the Ri<u>s</u>i of this Kavacha; Brihat&icirc; is its Chha<u>nd</u>a; and S'&acirc;rad&acirc; Ambik&acirc; is its presiding Deity. Its application (Viniyoga) is in the acquisition of spiritual knowlege, in the fruition of any desires or necessities, in composing poems or anywhere wheresoever success is required. May S'r&icirc;m Hr&icirc;m Sarasvatyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; protect fully my head; S&#146;r&icirc;m V&acirc;gdevat&acirc;yai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, my forehead; Om Hr&icirc;m Sarasvatyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, my ears always; Om S&#146;r&icirc;m Hr&icirc;m Bhagabatyai Sarasvatyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; always my eyes; Aim Hr&icirc;m V&acirc;gv&acirc;dinyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, always my nose; Om Hr&icirc;m Vidyadhi<u>st</u>h&acirc;tr&icirc; Devyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, my lips always; Om S&#146;r&icirc;m Hr&icirc;m Brahmyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; my rows of teeth; Aim, this single letter protect my neck; Om S&#146;r&icirc;m Hr&icirc;m my throat; S'r&icirc;m, my shoulders, Om Hr&icirc;m Vidy&acirc;dhi<u>st</u>h&acirc;tr&icirc; Devyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, always my chest; Om Hr&icirc;m Vidyadhisvar&ucirc;p&acirc;yai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; my navel; &#160;Om Hr&icirc;m Kl&icirc;m V&acirc;<u>n</u>yai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; my hands; Om Svarva v&acirc;rnatm&icirc; K&acirc;yai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; my feet; and let Om V&acirc;gadhis<u>t</u>h&acirc;tridevyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; protect all my body. Let Om Sarvakan<u>t</u>hav&acirc;sinyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; protect my east; Let Om Svarvajibh&acirc;gra v&acirc;sinyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, the South-east; Om Aim Hr&icirc;m S&#146;r&icirc;m Kl&icirc;m Sarasvatyai budhajananyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, my South; Aim Hr&icirc;m S&#146;r&icirc;m, this three lettered Mantra my South-west; Om Aim Jhibhagrav&acirc;sinyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, my West; Om Svarvam bik&acirc;yai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, my North west; Om Aim S&#146;r&icirc;m Kl&icirc;m Gadyav&acirc;sinyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; my North; Aim Sarvas'&acirc;stra vasinyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, my North-east; Om Hr&icirc;m Sarvapujitayai Sv&acirc;h&acirc;, my top; Hr&icirc;m Pustakavasinyai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; my below and let Om Grantha v&icirc;jasvarup&acirc;yai Sv&acirc;h&acirc; protect all my sides. O N&acirc;rada! This Vis'vajaya Kavacha of the nature of Brahm&acirc; and its embodied Mantra I have now spoken to you. I heard this before from the mouth of Dharma Deva in the Ga<u>n</u>dh&acirc;m&acirc;dana mountain. Now I speak this to you out of my great affection for you. But never divulge this to anybody. One is worship one's spiritual Teacher (Guru Deva) according to due rites and ceremonies with clothings, ornaments, and sandalpaste and then fall down prostrate to him and then hold this Kavacha. Repeating this</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">five lakhs of times, one gets success and becomes a Siddha. The holder of this Kavacha becomes intelligent like Brihaspati, eloquent, Kav&icirc;ndras, and the conqueror of the three worlds, no sooner one becomes a Siddlha in this. In fact, he can conquer everything by virtue of this Kavacha. O Muni! Thus I have described to you this Kavacha according to K&acirc;<u>n</u>va S'&acirc;kh&acirc;. Now I am speaking about the method of worship, Dhy&acirc;na and the praise of this Kavacha. Hear.</p>

<p>Here ends the Fourth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the hymn, worship and Kavacha of Sarasvat&icirc; Dev&icirc; in S'r&icirc; Mad Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vy&acirc;sa.</p>
