Of these, the Vah<u>n</u>iku<u>nd</u>a has the fire lit at its bottom, by the help of various kinds of stones. This Ku<u>nd</u>a will not be destroyed till Mah&acirc;pralaya comes. Here the sinners are tormented severely. It looks like a blazing coke. The flames are rising from it one hundred hands high. In circumference those flames are two miles. This is named Vah<u>n</u>iku<u>nd</u>a. It is full of sinners crying loudly. It is constantly watched by My messengers who are chastising and punishing the sinners. Next comes the Tapta Ku<u>nd</u>a. It is filled with hot water and full of rapacious animals. The sinners there are severely beaten by My messengers and they are always crying out very loudly, which is being echoed and re-echoed all around terribly. It extends for one mile. This Ku<u>nd</u>a is filled with hot salt water and the abode of many crows. Then there is the Bhay&acirc;naka Ku<u>nd</u>a. It extends for two miles and it is filled with sinners. They are being punished by My messengers and they are incessantly crying, &#147;Save us, save us.&#148;</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">Next comes the Vi<u>st</u>h&acirc; Ku<u>nd</u>a. It is filled with faeces and excrements where the sinners are moving without any food and with their palate and throats dry. Its size is two miles and it is very bad and ugly with foetid and nasty smell. It is always filled with sinners, who are being chastised by My D&ucirc;tas (messengers) and eat those faeces and excrements. The worms therein are constantly biting and stinging them and they are crying, &#147;deliver us, deliver us.&#148; Then comes the hot M&ucirc;ttra Ku<u>nd</u>a. It is filled with the hot urine and the worms thereof. The great sinners always dwell here. It measures four miles; and it is quite dark. My D&ucirc;tas always beat them and their throats, lips, palates are all dry. Then comes the S&#146;le<u>s</u>ma Ku<u>nd</u>a. It is filled with phlegm and the insects thereof. The sinners dwell in phlegm and eat that phlegm. Then comes the Gara Ku<u>nd</u>a. It is filled with (factitious) poison. It measures one mile. The sinners eat this poison and dwell here. The worms thereof bite them. They tremble at the chastisement of My D&ucirc;tas and cry aloud.

Numberless sinners live there, and as they move, the insects immediately bite and sting them. Next comes the Vas&acirc; Ku<u>nd</u>a. It is filled with the serum or marrow of the flesh and it measures one-half mile. The sinners dwell there, chastised and punished by My messengers. Then comes the S&#146;ukra Ku<u>nd</u>a. It measures two miles in diameter. The insects, born in the semen, bite the sinners, and they move on and on. Then comes the Rakta Ku<u>nd</u>a, with very offensive, foetid smell. It is deep like a well and filled with blood. The sinners dwell here, drinking blood. The insects therein are always biting them. Then follows the As&#146;ru Ku<u>nd</u>a. It measures in size one fourth the measure of the well (above-mentioned). It is always filled with hot tears of the eyes; and many sinners are seen there living weeping and crying and being bitten by the snakes. Then there is the G&acirc;tra Mala Ku<u>nd</u>a.

Then come in succession the four Ku<u>nd</u>as Nakha, Loma and others. They also measure each one-fourth that of a V&acirc;p&icirc;. The sinners dwell there, always chastised by My messengers. Next comes the very hot T&acirc;mra Ku<u>nd</u>a. Burning cokes exist on the top of very hot coppers. There are lakhs and lakhs of very hot copper figures in that Ku<u>nd</u>a. The sinners, being compelled by My messengers, are made to embrace each of these hot copper figures and they cry loudly and live there. It measures four miles. Then come the burning Ang&acirc;ra Ku<u>nd</u>a and the hot Lauha Dh&acirc;ra Ku<u>nd</u>a. Here the sinners are made to embrace the hot iron figures and, feeling themselves burnt, cry out of fear and agony. Whenever My messengers punish them, they immediately cry out, &#147;Save us, save us.&#148; It measures eight miles; and it is pitch dark and very awful. This is named the hot Lauha Ku<u>nd</u>a.

Millions and millions of great sinners are made by My men to fall from the tops of those trees down below where their bodies get pierced by very sharp thorns, six feet long; and thus they dwell there, beaten by My men. Out of thirst, their palates get dried up; and they cry out repeatedly, &#147;Water, water.&#148; Out of fear, they get very anxious and then their heads get broken by the clubs brought down on them by My men. So they move there like the beings burnt in very hot oil. Then comes the Vi<u>s</u>oda Ku<u>nd</u>a. It measures two miles in diameter and is filled with the poison of the serpent called Tak<u>s</u>akas. My men punish the sinners and they drink the poison thereof and dwell there. Then comes the hot Taila Ku<u>nd</u>a. There are no insects here. Only the great sinners dwell. All around burning coals are flaring and when My men beat the sinners, they run hither and thither. It is filled with horrible intense darkness and it is exceedingly painful. It looks dreadful and measures two miles. Then comes the Kunta Ku<u>nd</u>a. Sharp pointed iron weapons like tridents are placed in order all round. The sinners, pierced by those weapons, are seen encircling the Ku<u>nd</u>a. It measures one-half mile.

The sinners dwell and eat the pus thereof and, are beaten by My men. Then comes the Sarpa Ku<u>nd</u>a. Millions and millions of snakes of the length of a T&acirc;l tree are existing there. These serpents encircle the sinners and as they bite them, My men also beat them at the same time. So there arises a general hue and cry, &#147;Save us, save us; we are done for.&#148; Then come in order the Dams&#146;a Ku<u>nd</u>a, Mas&#146;aka Ku<u>nd</u>a, and the Garala Ku<u>nd</u>a. These are filled with gad-flies, mosquitoes, and poison respectively. Each of them measures one mile. The sinners&#146; hands and feet are tied up. So when the gad-flies and mosquitoes fiercely sting them, and My men violently beat them simultaneously, they raise a loud uproar and are made to move on, in their tied states by My persons. Their bodies get thoroughly reddened and covered with blood by the stinging of the flies, etc. Then come the Vajra Ku<u>nd</u>a and the Vris&#146;chika Ku<u>nd</u>a filled respectively with Vajra insects and the scorpions.

On the top surface of the Ku<u>nd</u>a there is a very big T&acirc;l tree very high. The edges of the leaves of this tree are sharp like the edge of a sword. One mile below this T&acirc;l tree is situated the Ku<u>nd</u>a.
