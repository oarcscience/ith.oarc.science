<p align="none;">1-8. The Ri<u>s</u>is said :-- &#147;O Sinless S&ucirc;ta! You have described to us in detail<b> </b>the birth of Vy&acirc;sa, of unrivalled fire, and of Satyavat&icirc;; but we have one great doubt in our minds though, O Knower of Dharma! which is not being removed by your words. O Sinless one! First, as regards the mother of Vy&acirc;sa, the all auspicious Satyavat&icirc;, we have this doubt how she came to be united to the virtuous S&#146;antanu? The king S&#146;antanu, of the family of Puru is a greatly religious man; how could he have married Satyavat&icirc;<b> </b>knowing her to be a fisherman's daughter and born of a low family? Now say who was the first wife<i> </i>of S&#146;antanu and how Bh&icirc;sma, the intelligent son of S&#146;antanu came to be born of the parts of Vasu? O S&ucirc;ta! You have told before that Bh&icirc;sma, of indomitable valour, made the Satyavat&icirc;'s son, the brave Chitr&acirc;ngada, king; and subsequent to his death made his younger brother Vich&icirc;trav&icirc;rya king. But when the elder brother Bh&icirc;sma, the greatly religious and beautiful was present, how was it that Chitr&acirc;ngada and Vich&icirc;trav&icirc;rya<b> </b>having been installed by Bh&icirc;sma himself could have reigned.&#148; </p>   
<p align="none;">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;">9-12. Again on the demise of Vich&icirc;trav&icirc;rya,<b> </b>Satyavat&icirc;<b> </b>became very<i> </i>much grieved and got two sons born of her two son's wives by Vedavy&acirc;sa? How can we explain this fact? Why did she do this? Why did she not give to Bh&icirc;sma the kingdom? Why did Bh&icirc;sma not marry? And how was it that the elder brother Vy&acirc;sa Deva, of indomitable valour, did such an irreligious act as to beget two (Goloka) sons from the wives of the brothers? Vy&acirc;sa composed the Pur&acirc;<u>n</u>as and knew everything of religion; how then did he go to other's wives, especially, of his brother's wives?</p>   
<p align="none;">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;">13-14. O S&ucirc;ta! Why did Vy&acirc;sa Deva do such a hateful act, in spite of his being a Muni? The actions of Vedas are inferred from their subsequent good conducts; how can this act of Vy&acirc;sa be calculated as one amongst them? O Intelligent one! You are the disciple of Vy&acirc;sa; therefore you are the best man to solve our doubts. We all of this Dharmakshettra<b> </b>Naimi<u>s</u>&acirc;ra<u>n</u>ya<b> </b>are very eager to hear this.</p>   
<p align="none;">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;">15-39. At this S&ucirc;ta said :-- In ancient days there reigned a king named Mah&acirc;bhi<u>s</u>a<b>, </b>in the family of Ik<u>s</u>&acirc;ku endowed with all the qualities of a great king; he was the foremost of all the kings, truthful and religious. That highly intelligent king performed thousand<b> </b>horse-sacrifices (Asva</p>

<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;">medhas)<b> </b>one hundred V&acirc;japeya<b> </b>sacrifices and thereby satisfied Indra, the king of the Devas<b> </b>and went to Heavens. Once, on an occasion, that king went to the abode of Brahm&acirc;; the other gods also went there to serve Praj&acirc;pati.<b> </b>The great river, Gang&acirc; Dev&icirc;, too, assuming the feminine form, went to Brahm&acirc; to serve him. Now, in the interval, violent winds arose and the clothing of Gang&acirc; Dev&icirc; went off; at this the Devas did not look at her; rather kept their faces downwards; but the king Mah&acirc;bhi<u>s</u>a continued gazing at her. Gang&acirc; also came to know the king and that he had become attached to her. Brahm&acirc;, seeing that both of them are love-stricken and are shameless, became angry and cursed them immediately :-- O king! you better take your birth again in the human world and practise great meritorious deeds and come again to this Heaven. Thus saying, Brahm&acirc; looked at Gang&acirc;, who was attached to the king, and addressed her :-- &#147;You too better go to the human world and become his wife.&#148; Both of them, the king as well as Gang&acirc;, came out of Brahm&acirc;'s abode, very much grieved in their hearts. The king Mah&acirc;bhi<u>s</u>a thought of coming to this world and reflected on the kings thereof and settled to make<b> </b>the king Prat&icirc;pa of Puru's family his father. At this time the eight Vasus with their wives wandering in various places and enjoying<b> </b>as they<b> </b>liked came to the hermitage of Vas'i<u>st</u>ha.<b> </b>Amongst the aforesaid<b> </b>eight Vasus Prithu and others, one Vasu Dyau's wife seeing Nandini, the sacrificial cow (K&acirc;madhenu)<b> </b>of Vas'i<u>st</u>ha asked her husband :-- &#147;Whose is this excellent cow that I see?&#160; Vasu then replied as follows :-- &#147; O Beautiful<b> </b>one! This is Vas'i<u>st</u>ha's<b> </b>cow. Whoever, be he a man or woman drinks<b> </b>her milk gets his longevity extended to ten thousand years and his youth never ends.&#148; Hearing this, the Vasu's wife said :-- &#147;There is a very<b> </b>beautiful comrade (Sakh&icirc;) of mine, the daughter of the Rajars&icirc;-Us'&icirc;na in the world, of auspicious qualities. O Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;ga! Kindly bring to me from Vas'i<u>st</u>ha's hermitage that auspicious sacrificial milch cow Nandini together with her calf that yields all desires; my Sakh&icirc; will then<b> </b>drink her milk and be thereby<b> </b>free from disease, old age and become the chief amongst all mankind.<b> </b>Hearing<b> </b>thus, his wife's word, the Vasu<b> </b>Dyau, though sinless, stole away<b> </b>together with Prithu and the other Vasus the cow Nandini in utter defiance to the self-controlled Muni Vas'i<u>st</u>ha. When the cow Nandini had been stolen, the great ascetic Vas'is<u>t</u>ha came quickly to the hermitage with <b>a</b>bundance<b> </b>of fruits.</p>   
<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;">The ascetic Muni Vas'i<u>st</u>ha,<b> </b>not finding, in his hermitage, his cow with her calf, searched for her in many forests and caves; but he, the son of Varu<u>n</u>a,<b> </b>could not find out his cow even<b> </b>after prolonged searches; he, then, took recourse to meditation<b> </b>and came to know<b> </b>that the Vasus had<b> </b>stolen the cow and became angry. He expressed :-- &#147;When the Vasus have<b> </b>stolen this my cow in utter defiance to my self, they must be born</p>   
<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>   
<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:">amongst men.&#148; When the religious Varu<u>n</u>a's son Vas'i<u>st</u>ha thus cursed the Vasus, they<i> </i>became very sorry and absent-minded; all of them went to Vas'i<u>st</u>ha's hermitage and saw him there; they began to supplicate him as much as they could; and took refuge under him. Seeing the Vasus standing before him in an extremely distressed condition, the virtuous Muni Vas'i<u>st</u>ha said :-- &#147;You all will be free from the curse within one year; but the Vasu Dyau will dwell amongst men for a long, long period as he had stolen direct my Nandini with her calf.&#148;</p>   
<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:">40-60. While the Vasus, thus cursed, were returning, they saw on the way the chief river Gang&acirc; Dev&icirc; also cursed and therefore distressed; all of them bowed down to her simultaneously and said: &#147;O Dev&icirc;! A serious thought is troubling our minds, how can we, who live on nectar, take our birth in human wombs; so, O best river! You better be a woman and give birth to us. O Sinless one! You better be the wife of the sage King S&#146;antanu and no sooner we be born of your womb, kindly throw us in the river Gang&acirc; (your water). If you do thus, O Gang&acirc; we will certainly be freed of our curse.&#148; Gang&acirc; Dev&icirc; replied &#147;Well; that will be.&#148; Thus spoken, the Vasus went to their respective places; and Gang&acirc; Dev&icirc;, too, thinking on the subject again and again, went out of that place. At this time Mah&acirc;bhi<u>s</u>a became born as a son of the king Prat&icirc;pa and became known as S&#146;antanu. He was exceedingly religious and true to his promise. One day<i> </i>while the King Prat&icirc;pa was praising the S&ucirc;rya Dev&icirc; (the sun) of unequalled energy, Gang&acirc; Dev&icirc; assumed an extraordinarily beautiful feminine form and came out of the waters and sat on the right thigh, resembling like a s&acirc;l tree, of the king Prat&icirc;pa. The sage king Prat&icirc;p spoke out to the lady sitting on his right thigh, thus :-- &#147;O beautiful faced one! Why, unasked, have you sat on my auspicious right thigh?&#148; The lovely Gang&acirc; then replied :-- &#147;Hear why I have sat here. O best of Kurus! O king! Becoming attached to you, I have sat on your thigh; so please accept me.&#148; At this the king Prat&icirc;pa spoke to the beautiful lady, full of youth and beauty, &#147;I never go, simply out of passion to another's wife. There is another point; you have sat on my right thigh; that is the seat of sons and son's wives; so, when my desired son will be born, you will then, be my son's wife. And certainly, by your good will, my son will be born.&#148; The lady, of divine form, said, Well; that will be done! and went away. The king returned to his palace, thinking of the lady. After some time, he had <b>a </b>son born to him and when the son attained his teens, the king desired to lead a forest life and communicated this matter to his son. He said also, if the aforesaid beautifully smiling girl comes to you to marry, then marry her. And I am also ordering you not to question her anything &#147;who are you&#148; and so forth. If you take her as your legal wife, you will certainly be happy. Thus</p>

<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;">saying to his son, the king Prat&icirc;pa handed over all his kingdom to his son and gladly retired into the forest. The king practised tapasy&acirc; in the forest and<b> </b>worshipped Ambik&acirc;; on quitting his mortal coil, he went by his sheer merit to the Heavens<b>. </b>The<b> </b>highly<b> </b>energetic king S&#146;antanu, on getting his kingdom, began to administer justice according to the laws of Dharma and governed his subjects.</p>

<p align="justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;">Thus ends the third Chapter of the Second Skandha<b> </b>on the description of the curse on Gang&acirc;, Mah&acirc;bhi<u>s</u>a<b> </b>and Vasus in the<b> </b>M&acirc;hapur&acirc;<u>n</u>am<b> </b>S<b>&#146;</b>r&icirc; Mad Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam<b> </b>of 18,000 verses.</p>
