<P>8. The particle <I>k</I>a is used here, according to Nand., who argues from a passage of Y&acirc;<I>g</I>&ntilde;avalkya (II, 68), in. order to include liberality among the qualities required in a witness.]</P>

<P>12. An appointed witness having died or gone abroad, those who have heard his deposition may give evidence.</P>
<P>13. (The evidence of) witnesses is (of two kinds): either of what was seen, or of what was heard.</P>
<P>14. Witnesses are free from blame if they give true evidence.</P>
<P>15. Whenever the death of a member of any of the four castes (would be occasioned by true evidence, they are free from blame) if they give false evidence.</P>
<P>16. In order to expiate the sin thus committed, such a witness), if he belongs to a twice-born caste, must pour an oblation in the fire, consecrating it with the texts called K&ucirc;shm&acirc;<I>nd</I>&icirc;.</P>

<P>25. 'Whatever places (of torture) await (the killer of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and other) great criminals and (the killer of a cow and other) minor offenders, those places of abode are ordained for a witness who gives false evidence;</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[22, 23. Nand.'s interpretation of these two S&ucirc;tras, which has been followed above, does not agree with Kull&ucirc;ka's, of M. VIII, 88. But in another passage of Manu (VIII, 113), where the same terms recur, he interprets them like Nand.</P>
<P>36. This Sloka is also found in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata I, 3095 &amp;c., in the M&acirc;rka<I>nd</I>eya-pur&acirc;&ntilde;a VIII, 42, in the Hitopade<I>s</I>a IV, 129, and, in a somewhat modified form, in the R&acirc;m&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a II, 61, 10.

<P>are weighed against each other, (it is found that) truth ranks even higher than a thousand horse-sacrifices.</P>
<P>37. 'Those who, though acquainted with the facts, and appointed to give evidence, stand mute, are equally criminal with, and deserve the same punishment as, false witnesses.' (After having addressed them) thus, let. the king examine the witnesses in the order of their castes.</P>
<P>38. That plaintiff whose statement the witnesses declare to be true, shall win his suit; but he whose statement they declare to be wrong, shall certainly lose it.</P>
<P>39. If there is contradictory evidence, let the king decide by the plurality of witnesses; if equality in number, by superiority in virtue; if parity in virtue, by the evidence of the best among the twice-born.</P>
<P>40. Whenever a perjured witness has given false evidence in a suit, (the king) must reverse the judgment; and whatever has been done, must be considered as undone.</P>
