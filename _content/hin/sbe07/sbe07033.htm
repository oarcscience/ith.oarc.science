<P>1. A man has three Atigurus (or specially venerable superiors):</P>
<P>2. His father, his mother, and his spiritual teacher.</P>
<P>3. To them he must always pay obedience.</P>
<P>4. What they say, that he must do.</P>
<P>5. And he must do what is agreeable and serviceable to them.</P>
<P>6. Let him never do anything without their leave.</P>
<P>7. Those three are equal to the three Vedas (<I>Ri</I>g-veda, S&acirc;ma-veda, and Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda), they are equal to the three gods (Brahman, Vish<I>n</I>u, and Siva), they are equal to the three worlds (of men, of gods, and of Brahman), they are equal to the three fires.</P>
<P>8. The father is the G&acirc;rhapatya (or household) fire, the mother is the Dakshi<I>n</I>a (or ceremonial) fire, and the spiritual teacher is the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya (or sacrificial) fire.</P>
<P>9. He pays regard to all his duties, who pays regard to those three; he who shows no regard to</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[XXXI. 1-6. M. II, 225, 226, 228, 229; &Acirc;past. I, 4, 14, 6; Gaut. II, 50, 51.--7. M. II, 230.--8. M. II, 231; &Acirc;past. I, 1, 3, 44.--9. M. II, 234.--10. M. II, 233.</P>
<P>9. 'The father is said to be of the same nature as the G&acirc;rhapatya fire, because the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya is produced from it; the mother is said to be of the same nature as the Dakshi<I>n</I>a fire, because it {footnote p. 129} has a separate origin, or because she has the sacrificial implements, such as the pestle and mortar and the like, in her charge; and the spiritual teacher is said to be of the same nature as the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire, because all oblations fall to his share, as the Sm<I>ri</I>ti says (Y. I, 27), "Let him (the pupil) deliver to him (the teacher) the collected alms."' (Nand.)]</P>

<P>them, derives no benefit from any religious observance.</P>
<P>10. By honouring his mother, he gains the present world; by honouring his father, the world of gods; and by paying strict obedience to his spiritual teacher, the world of Brahman.</P>
