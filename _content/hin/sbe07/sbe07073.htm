<P>8. The use of the particle <I>k</I>a implies, according to Nand., that his frame of mind and his speech should also be in conformity with his age, &amp;c., as ordained by Manu IV, 18.</P>
<P>13-16. Nand., arguing from texts of Baudh&acirc;yana and of Manu (IV, 36), takes the use of the particle <I>k</I>a in S&ucirc;tras 13 and 14 to {footnote p. 226} imply that a Sn&acirc;taka must wear three garments, an under garment, an upper garment, and a mantle, and in S&ucirc;tra 16, that he must carry about him a bushel of Ku<I>s</I>a grass.]</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[19. This rule appears to refer, likewise, to the custom of suspending, by a tree or a post, an upper garment or a piece of cloth, in order to ward off the rays of the sun.</P>
<P>20. The particle <I>k</I>a here is used, according to Nand., in order to include 'the sun, while it is eclipsed,' as mentioned by Manu IV, 37.</P>
<P>29. 'As, shown by <I>k</I>a, a place where arrows, spears, or other missiles are falling down, is also intended here.' (Nand.)]</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[46. Besides the above interpretation of the term b&acirc;l&acirc;tapa, which is proposed by Kull&ucirc;ka also (on M.

<P>88. He must adorn himself (with garlands, sandal, and the like).</P>
<P>89. Thus he must observe established customs.</P>
