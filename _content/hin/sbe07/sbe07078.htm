<P>1. The (twelve) days of new moon, the three Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc;s, the three Anvash<I>t</I>ak&acirc;s, a M&acirc;gha day (i.e. 'day on which the moon enters the lunar asterism Magh&acirc;'), which falls on the thirteenth of the dark half of the month Praush<I>th</I>apada, and the two seasons when rice and barley grow ripe (or autumn and spring):</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[7. The Mantras are those quoted above, in Chapters LXXIII and LXXIV. They have to be modified, i. e. the names of the maternal ancestors must be put in, and the verb &amp;c. of the sentence be altered accordingly. (Nand.)</P>
<P>LXXVI. I. M. III, 122, 273, 281; IV, 150; Y. I, 217, 260; Gaut. XV, 2; &Acirc;past. II, 7, 16, 4-6.</P>
<P>1. Nand. infers from a passage of &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana (G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra II, 4, 3) that <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas to be offered on the day before each Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc; are also intended here. See, however, note on LXXIII, 9. The same proposes two explanations of the term M&acirc;gh&icirc;: 1. It has to be separated from the following words, and refers directly to the day of full moon in the month M&acirc;gha, and indirectly to the days of full moon in &Acirc;sh&acirc;<I>dh</I>a, K&acirc;rttika, and Vai<I>s</I>&acirc;kha as well, as indicated in a passage of the Br&acirc;hma-pur&acirc;na. 2. It has to be connected with the clause following it. This latter interpretation, on which the rendering given above is based, is supported by Mann (III, 273,274), {footnote p. 241} Y&acirc;<I>g</I>&ntilde;avalkya, (I, 260), according to the interpretations of Kull&ucirc;ka and Vig&ntilde;&acirc;ne<I>s</I>vara, and by the Vish<I>n</I>u-s&ucirc;tra itself (LXXVIII, 52).]</P>

<P>2. Thus have the regular times for a Sr&acirc;ddha been declared by the lord of creatures. He who fails to perform a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha on those days, goes to hell.</P>
