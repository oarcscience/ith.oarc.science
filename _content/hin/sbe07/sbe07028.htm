<P>1. If a man has several wives of his own caste,</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[14. Nand. states that the self-immolation of widows (Sattee) is a specially meritorious act, and not obligatory. Besides, he quotes several passages from other Smritis and from the B<I>ri</I>hann&acirc;rad&icirc;yapur&acirc;<I>n</I>a, to the effect that in case the husband should have died abroad, a widow of his, who belongs to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a caste, may not commit herself to the flames, unless she can reach the place, where his corpse lies, in a day; and that one who is in her courses, or pregnant, or whose pregnancy is suspected, or who has an infant child, is also forbidden to burn herself with her dead husband. English renderings of all the texts quoted by Nand. may he found in Colebrooke's Essay on the Duties of a Faithful Hindu Widow. See also above, XX, 39. Nand., arguing from a passage of Baudh&acirc;yana, takes the particle v&acirc;, 'or,' to imply that the widow is at liberty to become a female ascetic instead of burning herself.</P>
<P>XXVI. 2. M. IX, 86.--4. M. IX; 87.--1-4. Colebrooke, Dig. {footnote p. 112} IV, 1, XLIX.--5-7. M. III, 12, 14, 15, 18; Y. I, 56; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 74.--7. Colebrooke, Dig. IV, 1, LII.]</P>

<P>he shall perform his religious duties together with the eldest (or first-married) wife.</P>
<P>2. (If he has several) wives of divers castes (he shall perform them) even with the youngest wife if she is of the same caste as himself.</P>
<P>3. On failure of a wife of his own caste (he shall perform them) with one belonging to the caste next below his own; so also in cases of distress (i.e. when the wife who is equal in caste to him happens to be absent, or when she has met with a calamity);</P>
<P>4. But no twice-born man ever with a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra wife.</P>
<P>5. A union of a twice-born man with a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra wife can never produce religious merit; it is from carnal desire only that he marries her, being blinded by lust.</P>
<P>6. Men of the three first castes, who through folly marry a woman of the lowest caste, quickly degrade their families and progeny to the state of <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras.</P>
<P>7, If his oblations to the gods and manes and (his hospitable attentions) to guests are offered principally through her hands, the gods and manes (and the guests) will not eat such offerings, and he will not go to heaven.</P>
