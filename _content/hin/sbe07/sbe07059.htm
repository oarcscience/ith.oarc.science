<P>2. Vr&acirc;tyas (i. e. those for whom the ceremony of initiation has not been performed)</P>
<P>3. Outcasts;</P>
<P>4. Descendants within the third degree' of an outcast mother or father, if they (or their outcast ancestors) have not been purified (by a penance).</P>
<P>5. (As a rule) the food of all such persons must not be eaten, nor gifts be accepted from them,<SUP>[1]</SUP>.</P>
<P>6. He must avoid accepting repeated gifts from those whose presents must not be accepted<SUP>[1]</SUP>.</P>
<P>7. By accepting such gifts, Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as lose their divine lustre.</P>
<P>8. And he who, not knowing the law regarding acceptance of gifts, accepts (illicit) gifts, sinks, to hell together with the giver.</P>
<P>9. He who, being worthy to receive gifts, does not accept them, obtains that world which is destined for the liberal-minded (after death).</P>
<P>10. Firewood, water, roots, fruits, protection, meat, honey, a bed, a seat, a house, flowers, sour</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. <SUP>1</SUP> 'There are two classes of sinners, the repentant and the unrepenting. The penances to be performed by the former having been enumerated, he goes on in the present chapter to state that the latter must be avoided.' (Nand.)</P>
<P>3. See XXXV, 1-5.</P>
<P>4. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. refers the term 'in the third degree' to the three ascendants of the parents. The same infers from a passage of Gautama (XX, 1) that the particle <I>k</I>a is used in order to include a murderer of a king also.</P>
<P>5. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. infers from another text of Gautama (XX, 8) that it is also forbidden to converse with them.</P>
<P>6. <SUP>1</SUP> 'It is no sin then, in one who is in distress, to accept a present once from them.' (Nand.) See 14.]</P>

<P>milk, and vegetables he must not disdain to accept when they are offered to him.</P>
<P>11. Even if an offender (but not a mortal sinner) has beckoned and offered alms to him, which had been brought previously for the purpose, the lord of creatures has declared that they may be accepted from him.</P>
<P>12. Neither will the manes eat (his funeral oblations offered to them) for fifteen years, nor will the fire convey his burnt-offerings (to the gods) if he rejects such alms.</P>
<P>13. If he wishes to provide for his (parents or other) Gurus or for (his wife or other) such persons as he is bound to maintain, or if he wants to worship the manes or the gods, he may accept gifts from any one; but he must not satisfy himself with them.</P>
<P>14. But even in those cases, and though he be worthy to receive presents, let him not accept them from a dissolute woman, from a eunuch, from an outcast, or from an enemy.</P>
<P>15. And if his parents are dead, or if he is living apart from them in a house of his own, he must never, while seeking to obtain food for himself, accept alms from any other persons but those who are of respectable descent (and belong to a twice-born caste).</P>
<P>16. One who ploughs the ground for half the crop (and gives the other half to the king or a private person, who is the owner), a friend of the family, a (house-)slave, a herdsman, a barber, and</P>

<P>16, The reason of this rule, according to Nand., lies in this, that {footnote p. 189} all the castes mentioned in this S&ucirc;tra are not properly S&ucirc;dras, but the offspring of unions between parents of a different caste, herdsmen being, according to Par&acirc;<I>s</I>ara, the offspring of a Kshatriya with a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra damsel, &amp;c. The same considers the use of the particle <I>k</I>a to imply that potters are also intended. See Gaut. XVII, 6.]</P>
