# XXXIII.

1\. Now man has three most dangerous enemies, called carnal desire,
wrath, and greed.

\[17. <sup>1</sup> I. e. a Brâhma*n*a for whom the ceremony of
initiation has been performed (Nand.) This proverb is also found in the
Nîti*s*âstra 1,55, in the Mahâbhârata II, 1385 seq., &c., and in other
works. See Böhtlingk, Ind. Sprüche, 6163, 2456, &c.

XXXIII\. 1. Âpast. I, 8, 23, 4, 5.

1\. The mention which has been made in the preceding section, that on or
rules of conduct, of the breach of the vow of {footnote p. 132} chastity
and the penance for it (see XXVIII, 48, 49), causes him (Vish*n*u) to
discuss the law of penance (Prâya*sk*itta). This is done in the
following section, to which Chapter XXXIV serves as Introduction.
(Nand.) The section on Prâya*sk*itta extends as far as Chapter LVII.\]

2\. They are specially dangerous to the order of householders, because
they have (houses, wives, and other) property.

3\. Man, being overcome by those (three enemies), commits crimes in the
highest degree, high crimes, minor crimes, and crimes in the fourth
degree;

4\. Also crimes effecting loss of caste, crimes degrading to a mixed
caste, and crimes rendering the perpetrator unworthy (to receive alms
and the like);

5\. And crimes causing defilement, and miscellaneous offences.

6\. This is the threefold path to hell, destructive of self: carnal
desire, wrath, and greed: therefore must a man shun those three vices.
