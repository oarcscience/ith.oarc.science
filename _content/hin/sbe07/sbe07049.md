# XLVII.

1\. Now follows the *K*ândrâya*n*a (lunar penance).

2\. Let a man eat single mouthfuls (of food) unchanged in size;

\[XLVII. 1-10. M. XI, 217-222.--1-3. 9. Y. III, 324, 325.--1-4. Gaut.
XXVII, 12-15.

2\. 'Unchanged in size' means of that size precisely which the law
prescribes.' Yâ*g*ñavalkya (III, 324) states that each daily {footnote
p. 151} portion must have the size of a peacock's egg, and Gautama
(XXVII, 10) prescribes that the size of a mouthful shall be such as not
to cause a distortion of the mouth in swallowing it. (Nand.)\]

3\. And let him during the moon's increase add (successively) one
mouthful (every day, so as to eat one mouthful on the first day of the
moon's increase, two mouthfuls on the second day, and so on; fifteen
mouthfuls on the day of full moon), and during the wane of the moon let
him take off one mouthful (every day, so as to eat fourteen mouthfuls on
the first day of the moon's wane, thirteen mouthfuls on the second, and
one mouthful on the fourteenth day of the moon's wane), and on the day
of new moon let him fast entirely: thus has the barley-shaped
*K*ândrâya*n*a been described.

4\. Or the ant-shaped *K*ândrâya*n*a (may be performed).

5\. That *K*ândrâya*n*a is called 'ant-shaped' in which the day of new
moon is placed in the middle.

6\. That one is, called 'barley-shaped' in which the day of full moon is
placed in the middle.

7\. If a man eats for a month eight mouthfuls a day, it is (the penance
called) Yati*k*ândrâya*n*a (an hermit's *K*ândrâya*n*a).

8\. Eating (for a month) four mouthfuls each morning and evening is (the
penance called) *S*î*s*u*k*ândrâya*n*a (a child's *K*ândrâya*n*a).

9\. Eating anyhow<sup>\[1\]</sup> three hundred minus sixty mouthfuls a
month is the penance called Sâmânya*k*ândrâyâ*n*a (general
*K*ândrâya*n*a).

\[9. <sup>1</sup> 'Anyhow,' i. e, otherwise than ordained above, as e.
g. eating four mouthfuls on one day, and twelve on the next day; or
fasting on one day, and eating sixteen mouthfuls on the following day;
or fasting for two days, and eating twenty-four mouthfuls on the third
{footnote p. 153} day; or fasting for three days, and eating thirty-two
mouthfuls on the fourth day. (Nand.)\]

10\. After having performed this penance, in a former age, the seven
holy *Ri*shis, Brahman, and Rudra acquired a splendid abode, O Earth.
