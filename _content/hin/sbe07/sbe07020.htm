<P>1. If there are four sons of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (springing from four different wives) of the four castes, they shall divide the whole estate of their father into ten parts.</P>
<P>2. Of these, let the soil of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a wife take four parts;</P>
<P>3. The son of the Kshatriya wife, three parts;</P>
<P>4. The son of the Vai<I>s</I>ya wife, two parts;</P>
<P>5. The son of the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra wife, a single part.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[22. My rendering of this Sloka is based upon Kull&ucirc;ka's interpretation of the identical passage of Manu (IX, 200), which is supported by Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;nesvara (Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc; I, 4, 19 in Colebrooke's version), M&acirc;dhava (Burnell, D&acirc;ya-Vibh&acirc;ga 51), Varadar&acirc;<I>g</I>a (Burnell, Varadar&acirc;<I>g</I>a's Vyavah&acirc;ran&icirc;r<I>n</I>aya 49), and others. Nand. proposes a different interpretation, on which rests Dr. B&uuml;hler's rendering, 'Those ornaments, which the wives usually wear, should not be divided by the heirs whilst the husbands are alive.'</P>

<P>6. Again, if there are three sons of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (by wives of different castes), but no son by a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra (wife) among them, they shall divide the estate into nine parts.</P>
<P>7. (Of these) let them take, each in the order of his caste, shares amounting to four, three, and two parts of the whole respectively.</P>
<P>8. (If there are three sons by wives of different castes, but) no Vai<I>s</I>ya among them, they shall divide the estate into eight parts, and take four parts, three parts, and one part respectively.</P>
<P>9. (If there are three sons, but) no Kshatriya among them, they shall divide it into seven parts, and take four parts, two parts, and a single part respectively.</P>
<P>10. If there is no Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, among them, they hall divide it into six parts, and take three parts, two parts, and a single part respectively.</P>
<P>11. If there are sons of a Kshatriya by a Kshatriya, a Vai<I>s</I>ya, and a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra wife, the mode of division shall be the same (i.e. the estate shall be divided into six parts, &amp;c.)</P>
<P>12. Again, if there are two sons of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, the one belonging to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and the other to the Kshatriya caste, they shall divide the estate into seven parts; and of these the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a son shall take four parts;</P>
<P>13. The Kshatriya son, three parts.</P>
<P>14. Again, if there are two sons of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and the one belongs to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and the other to the Vai<I>s</I>ya caste, the estate shall be divided into six parts; and of these, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a shall take four parts;</P>
<P>15. The Vai<I>s</I>ya, two parts.</P>

<P>10. Again, if there are two sons of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and the one belongs to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and the other to the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra caste, they shall divide the estate into five parts;</P>
<P>17. And of these, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a shall take four parts;</P>
<P>18. The <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra, a single part.</P>
<P>19. Again, if there are two sons of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a or a Kshatriya, and the one belongs to the Kshatriya and the other to the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra caste, they shall divide the estate into five parts;</P>
<P>90. And of these, the Kshatriya shall take three parts;</P>
<P>21. The <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra, one part.</P>
<P>22. Again, if there are two sons of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a or a Kshatriya, and the one belongs to the Kshatriya, the other to the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra caste, they shall divide the estate into four parts;</P>
<P>23. And of these, the Kshatriya shall take three parts;</P>
<P>24. The <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra, a single part.</P>
<P>25. Again, if there are two sons of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a or a Vai<I>s</I>ya or a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra, and the one belongs to the Vai<I>s</I>ya, the other to the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra caste, they shall divide the estate into three parts;</P>
<P>26. And of these, the Vai<I>s</I>ya shall take two parts;</P>
<P>27. The <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra, a single part,</P>
<P>28. If a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a has an only son, he shall take the whole estate, provided he be a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, Kshatriya, or Vai<I>s</I>ya.</P>
<P>29. If a Kshatriya has (an only son who is) either a Kshatriya or a Vai<I>s</I>ya, (the rule shall be the same.)</P>
<P><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></P>
<P>30. If a Vai<I>s</I>ya has (an only son who is) Vai<I>s</I>ya, (the rule shall also be the same);</P>
<P>31. (And so shall the only) son of a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra (be sole heir) to his <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra (father).</P>
<P>32. A <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra, who is the only son of a father belonging to a twice-born caste, shall inherit one-half of his property;</P>
<P>33. The other half shall devolve in the same way as the property of one who died without leaving issue.</P>
<P>34. Mothers shall receive shares proportionate to their son's shares;</P>
<P>35. And so shall unmarried daughters.</P>
<P>36. Sons, who are equal in caste (to their father), shall receive equal shares.</P>
<P>37. A best part (the twentieth part of the inheritance, &amp;c.) shall be given to the eldest, as his additional share.</P>
<P>38. If there are two sons by a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and one by a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra wife, the estate shall be divided into nine parts; and of these, the two sons of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a wife shall take two parts, the one son of the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra wife, a single part.</P>
<P>39. If there are two sons by a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra, and one son by a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a wife, the estate shall be divided into six parts; and of these, the son of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a wife shall take four parts, and the two sons of the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra wife together shall take two parts.</P>
<P>40. Upon the same principles the shares have to be adjusted in other cases also.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[33. See XVII, 4 seq.</P>
<P>34. 'That is to say, a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a wife shall take four parts, a Kshatriya wife, three parts,' &amp;c. (Nand.)</P>
<P>37. See Gaut. XXVIII, 5.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></P>
<P>41. If (brothers), who after a previous division of the estate live again together as parceners, should make a second partition, the shares must be equal in that case, and the eldest has no right to an additional share.</P>
<P>42. What a brother has acquired by, his own efforts, without using the patrimony, he must not give up (to his brothers or other co-heirs), unless by his own free will; for it was gained by his own exertion.</P>
<P>43. And if a man recovers (a debt or other property), which could not before be recovered by his father, he shall not, unless by his own free will, divide it with his sons; for it is an acquisition made by himself.</P>
<P>44. Apparel, vehicles<SUP>[1]</SUP> (carriages or riding-horses), and ornaments (such as are usually worn according to the custom of the caste), prepared food, water (in a well or pool), females (slaves or mistresses of the deceased), property destined for pious uses or sacrifices, a common pasture-ground<SUP>[2]</SUP>, and a book, are indivisible.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[42. The term svayam&icirc;hitalabdham has been translated according to Kull&ucirc;ka (on M. IX, 208). Nand. interprets this <I>S</I>loka thus, 'What a brother has acquired by his own efforts, and what has been given to him, at his desire (by friends or others), he must not give up,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>43. Here again I have followed Kull&ucirc;ka (on M. IX, 209), and deviated from Nand.'s interpretation, who renders this Sloka as follows, 'If a man recovers property, &amp;c., or if he gains property by himself (by his learning or valour, &amp;c.) . . . '</P>
<P>44. <SUP>1</SUP> The term pattra has been rendered above in accordance with the first interpretation proposed by Nand., and with Kull&ucirc;ka's interpretation (on M. IX, 219). Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;ne<I>s</I>vara (in his comment upon the same passage of Manu) refers it to written documents, such especially as relate to a debt to be paid to the deceased; and {footnote p. 75} this interpretation is mentioned by Nand. also. But there is no reason why an unliquidated demand should not be divided; and written documents are only twice referred to in the code of Manu (VIII, 168, and IX, 232).--<SUP>2</SUP> in translating the term pra<I>k</I>&acirc;ra I have again followed Kull&ucirc;ka loc. cit.; see also Petersburg Dictionary s. v. Nand. interprets this term as denoting 'a path leading to or from the house.']</P>
