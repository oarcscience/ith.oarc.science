<P>9. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. thinks that the word iti, 'thus,' has a double meaning {footnote p. 150} here, and refers to another kind of Aghamarshana penance at the same time, which is described by <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kha, and consists simply in fasting for three days and muttering the Aghamarsha<I>n</I>a hymn three times.]</P>
