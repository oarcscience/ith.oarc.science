<P>1. What is given to another than a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a produces the same fruit in the world to come.</P>
<P>2. (What is given) to one who calls himself a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (because he was born and initiated as such, but who does not perform his daily duties) produces twice the same fruit.</P>
<P>3. (What is given) to one who has studied the main portions of the Veda produces a thousand times the same fruit.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[XCIII. 1-4. M. VII, 85; Gaut. V, 20.--7. M. IV, 192.--8. M. IV, 195.--9-13. M. IV, 196-200.</P>
<P>1. 'The term abr&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (one not a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a) refers to Kshatriyas and the like. Kull&ucirc;ka on M. VII, 85. Dr. B&uuml;hler's rendering of Gautama V, 20 agrees with this interpretation. Nand., on the other hand, refers the term abr&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a to six kinds of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as enumerated by <I>S</I>&acirc;t&acirc;tapa, who have infringed the rule of their caste by taking their substance from a king, or by selling or buying forbidden articles, or by sacrificing for a multitude of persons, &amp;c. The term 'the same fruit' means that a person shall receive in a future world what he has given in this. (Nand.)]</P>

<P>4. (What is given) to one who has mastered the whole Veda, produces infinite fruit.</P>
<P>5. A domestic priest may claim gifts from his own employer (but from no one else).</P>
<P>6. And so may a sister, a daughter and sons-in-law (or other connections claim gifts from their. brother, father, &amp;c., but not from a stranger).</P>
<P>7. One who knows his duty must not give even water to a twice-born man who acts like a cat, or to a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who acts like a crane, or to one who has not studied the Veda.</P>
<P>8. One who constantly hoists the flag of religion, and who is avaricious, crafty, deceitful, pitiless, and a calumniator of everybody, such a man is said to act like a cat.</P>
<P>9. One who hangs his head, who is bent upon, injuring others and upon his own gain, artful, and falsely demure, such a man is said to act like, a crane.</P>
<P>10. Those who act like cranes in this world, and those who act like cats, fall into (the hell called) Andhat&acirc;misra<SUP>[1]</SUP> on account . of their wickedness.</P>
<P>11. If a man has committed an offence and does penance for it, he must not do so under pretext of performing an act of piety, covering his crime under a (fictitious) vow, and imposing on women and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras.</P>
<P>12. A Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who acts thus, is despised in the next life and in this by those who know the Veda, and the penance performed by him under such false pretence goes to the (demons called) R&acirc;kshasas.</P>

<P>14. He must not give (to a panegyrist) from vain-glory, or from fear, or to a friend (from whom he hopes to obtain benefit), nor (must he bestow gifts), with a view to acquire religious merit, upon dancers or singers:, that is a fixed rule.</P>
