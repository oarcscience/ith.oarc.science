<P>uncle, and a priest he must honour by rising to meet and saluting them, even though they be younger than himself.</P>
<P>5. The wives of Gurus (superiors), who are of a lower class than their husbands (such as Kshatriya or Vai<I>s</I>ya or M&ucirc;rdh&acirc;vasikta wives), shall be honoured by (rising to meet and) saluting them from far; but he must not embrace their feet.</P>
<P>6. He should avoid to rub and anoint the limbs of Guru's wives, or to anoint their eyes, or to arrange their hair, or to wash their feet, or to do other such services for them.</P>
<P>7. To the wife of another, even though he does not know her, he must either say 'sister' (if she is of equal age with himself), or 'daughter' (if she is younger than himself), or 'mother' (if she is older than himself).</P>
<P>8. Let him not say 'thou<SUP>[1]</SUP>' to his Gurus (superiors).</P>
<P>9. If he has offended one of them (by saying 'thou' to him, or in some other manner), he must keep a fast and not eat again till the end of the day, after having obtained his forgiveness.</P>
<P>10. He must avoid to quarrel with his spiritual teacher and to argue with him (from emulation).</P>
<P>11. And he must not censure him;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[5. <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra wives are exempt from this rule; he should rise to meet, but not salute them. (Nand.)</P>
<P>8. <SUP>1</SUP> Other insulting language, as e. g. if he says hush or pish to them, is also included in this term. The use of the particle <I>k</I>a indicates that other persons entitled to respect are also intended in this S&ucirc;tra. (Nand.)</P>
<P>10. 'The particle <I>k</I>a is used in order to include Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as in general in this prohibition.' (Nand.)</P>

<P>12. Nor act so as to displease him.</P>
<P>13. (A pupil) must not embrace the feet of a Guru's young wife, if he has completed his twentieth year, or can distinguish virtue from vice.</P>
<P>14. But a young student may at pleasure prostrate himself before a young wife of his Guru, (stretching out both hands) as ordained (see XXVIII, 15), 'I, N. N. (ho! salute thee).'</P>
<P>15. On returning from a journey he shall (once) embrace the feet of the wives of his Gurus (superiors), and daily, salute them, remembering the practice of the virtuous.</P>
<P>16. Wealth, kindred, age, the performance of religious observances, and, fifthly, sacred knowledge are titles to respect; each subsequent one is superior to the one preceding in order.</P>
<P>17. A Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, though only ten years old<SUP>[1]</SUP>, and a member of the kingly caste, though a hundred years old, must be considered as father and son; and of these two, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is the father.</P>
<P>18. The seniority of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as is founded upon sacred knowledge; of Kshatriyas, upon valour in arms; of Vaisyas, upon grain and (other) wealth; of <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras, upon (priority of) birth.</P>
