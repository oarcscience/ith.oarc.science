<P>1. A <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha offered at the (T&icirc;rtha or place of pilgrimage called) Pushkaras confers eternal bliss upon the giver;</P>
<P>2. And so does the muttering of prayers, the offering of burnt-oblations, and the practice of austerities in that place.</P>
<P>3. Even by merely bathing at Pushkara he is purified from all his sins.</P>
<P>4. The same effect may be produced at <I>G</I>ay&acirc;<I>s</I>&icirc;rsha;</P>
<P>5. And near Va<I>t</I>a (Akshayava<I>t</I>a);</P>
<P>6. And on the Amaraka<I>nt</I>aka mountain;</P>
<P>7. And on the Var&acirc;ha mountain;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[LXXXV. 1. Pushkara, according to the common acceptation of the term, is the name of a celebrated place of pilgrimage near A<I>g</I>m&icirc;r, the modern Pokur. See Lassen, Indian Antiquities, I, 113. Nand. quotes a Smriti passage to the effect that there are three Pushkaras, and a passage of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, in which it is stated that one Pushkara is sacred to Brahman, another to Vish<I>n</I>u, and a third to Rudra.</P>
<P>3. Nand. asserts with regard to the use of the name Pushkara in the singular number in this S&ucirc;tra, that it means even a single bath has the consequence here mentioned.</P>
<P>4. Gay&acirc;<I>s</I>&icirc;rsha is the name of a mountain near Gay&acirc; in Bih&acirc;r, a celebrated place of pilgrimage. Compare Y&acirc;<I>g</I>&ntilde;avalkya I, 260.</P>
<P>5. There exists one Akshayava<I>t</I>a in Bih&acirc;r (Nand.) and another in Pray&acirc;ga (Allahabad). The 'undecaying banyan-tree' (Aksbay Ba<I>t</I>) is an object of worship at Allahabad even now, and was so already in the times of Hwen Thsang. See Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 389; St. Julien, Voyages des P&egrave;lerins Bouddhistes, II, 278.</P>
<P>6. Nand. states that both the T&icirc;rtha called Amaraka<I>nt</I>aka on the Mekal&acirc; mountain in the Vindhya range and the whole mountain of that name are meant.</P>
<P>7. 'This is a certain boar shaped mountain.' (Nand.) It seems very probable that the T&icirc;rtha of B&acirc;ram&ucirc;la, the ancient Var&acirc;ham&ucirc;la {footnote p. 257} in Ka<I>s</I>m&icirc;r, is meant. See B&uuml;hler, Ka<I>s</I>m&icirc;r Report, p. 12, where a 'Var&acirc;ha hill' is mentioned as adjacent to that town.]</P>
