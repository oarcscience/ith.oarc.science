<P>1. The month K&acirc;rttika is sacred to the god Agni.</P>
<P>2. Agni is the first of all gods.</P>
<P>3. Therefore is that man purified from every sin committed during the past year, who persists during the month K&acirc;rttika in bathing (daily) out of the village, in muttering the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, and in taking a single meal each day, consisting of food fit for oblations.</P>
<P>4. He who bathes (at the prescribed time, early in the morning) constantly, during the whole month K&acirc;rttika, who keeps his organs of sense under control, who mutters (the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;), who eats food fit for oblations only, and who governs his passions, is purified from every sin.</P>
