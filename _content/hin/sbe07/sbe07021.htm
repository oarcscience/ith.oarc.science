<P>4. But <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras must never carry out a member of a twice-born caste, even though he be their father.</P>
<P>5. Those Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as who carry out (or follow the corpse of) a (deceased) Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who has no relatives shall attain a mansion in heaven.</P>
<P>6. Those who have carried out a dead relative and burnt his corpse, shall walk round the pile from left to right, and then plunge into water, dressed in their clothes.</P>
<P>7. After having offered a libation of water to the deceased, they must place one ball of rice on blades of Kusa grass, (and this ceremony has to be repeated on each subsequent day, while the period of impurity lasts.)</P>

<P>9. Then they must throw unbroken grains into the fire.</P>
<P>10. On the fourth day they must collect the bones that have been left.</P>
<P>11. And they must throw them into water from the Ganges.</P>
<P>12. As many bones of a man are contained in the water of the Ganges, so many thousands of years will he reside in heaven.</P>
<P>13. While the term of impurity lasts, they must continually offer a libation of water and a ball of rice to the deceased.</P>
<P>14. And they must eat food which has been bought, or which they have received unsolicited.</P>
<P>15. And they, must eat no meat.</P>
<P>16. And they must sleep on the ground.</P>
<P>17. And they must sleep apart.</P>
<P>18. When the impurity is over, they must walk forth from the village, have their beards shaved, and having cleansed themselves with a paste of sesamum, or with a paste of mustard-seed, they must change their dress and re-enter the house.</P>
<P>19. There, after reciting a propitiatory prayer, they must honour the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as.</P>

<P>20. The gods are invisible deities, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as are visible deities.</P>
<P>21. The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as sustain the world.</P>
<P>22. It is by the favour of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as that the gods reside in heaven; a speech uttered by Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as (whether a curse or a benediction) never fails to come true.</P>
<P>23. What the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as pronounce, when highly pleased (as, if they promise sons, cattle, wealth, or some other boon to a man), the gods will ratify; when the visible gods are pleased, the invisible gods are surely pleased as well.</P>
<P>24. The mourners, who lament the loss of a relative, shall be addressed by men gifted with a tranquil frame of mind with such consolatory speeches as I shall now recite to thee, O Earth, who art cherished to my, mind.</P>
