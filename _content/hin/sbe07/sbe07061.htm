Y. I, 102; &Acirc;past. I, 4, 12, 16; I, 4, 13, 1; Gaut. V, 3, 9; &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. III, 1, 1-3; P&acirc;r. II, 9, 1.--26. M. III, 72.--27-30. M. III, 77, 78, 80, 81.</P>
<P>1. <SUP>1</SUP> The term P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I>&ntilde;a is used in a more restricted sense here than above (LV, 20). Nand. interprets it by 'Vai<I>s</I>vadeva, {footnote p. 191} Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka, Srav<I>n</I>&acirc;karmen, and similar sacrifices,' i. e. all the sacrifices which have to be performed in the one household fire, as opposed to those for which a Tret&acirc; or triad of sacred fires is required (see Stenzler, note on &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. I, 1, 2). Gautama (VIII, 18) enumerates seven P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I>&ntilde;as, among which, however, the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva is not included. The Vai<I>s</I>vadeva is described in LXVII. Regarding the other P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I>&ntilde;as, see the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras.--<SUP>2</SUP> 'Or in the fire kindled at the division of the family estate, or in the fire kindled on his becoming master of the house.' (Nand.) See S&acirc;<U>n</U>kh. I, 1, 3-5.]</P>

<P>(small or domestic offerings) in the fire kindled at the time of marriage<SUP>[2]</SUP>.</P>
<P>2. He must offer the Agnihotra (or daily oblations of clarified butter) every morning and evening (in the Tret&acirc; fires).</P>
<P>3. He must offer burnt-oblations to the gods (in case the Agnihotra cannot be performed).</P>
<P>4. Let him offer the two Dar<I>s</I>apur<I>n</I>am&acirc;sas on the days of conjunction and opposition of the sun</P>
<P>and moon.</P>
<P>5. Once in each half of the year, (at the two solstices, let him offer) the Pa<I>s</I>ubandha (animal sacrifice).</P>
<P>6. In autumn and summer let him offer the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a (oblation of first-fruits);</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[2. The three Tret&acirc; fires have been enumerated above (XXXI, 8). Regarding the Agnihotra and the sacrifices mentioned in 4-8, see Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 328-337, 343-349, 352-396.</P>
<P>4. 'One who has performed the ceremony of Agny&acirc;dh&acirc;na (kindling the sacred fires) must perform these two offerings in the Tret&acirc; fires, one who has not done so, in the household or nuptial fire.' (Nand.) This remark applies equally to the sacrifices mentioned in 5-7.</P>
<P>6. 'If the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a is offered in the household fire, it must consist of a Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka (cooked offering of grain).' (Nand.) See the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras above cited. Nand. further explains that in autumn the first-fruits of rice, and in summer the firstlings of {footnote p. 192} barley, or, according to &Acirc;pastamba, of Ve<I>n</I>uyava, have to be offered, and he infers from another text of the same author that the particle <I>k</I>a here refers to an oblation of Sy&acirc;m&acirc;ka grain, which has to be offered in the rainy season. The two passages in question are not found in &Acirc;pastamba's Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, but Weber, loc. cit., quotes them from K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana.]</P>

<P>7. Or when rice and barley are ripening (in winter and spring).</P>
<P>8. He who has a sufficient supply of food for more than three years (shall perform the Soma-sacrifice)<SUP>[1]</SUP>.</P>
<P>9. (He shall perform) the Soma-sacrifice once a year (in spring).</P>
<P>10. If he has not wealth (sufficient to defray the expenses of the Pa<I>s</I>ubandha, Soma, <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;sya, and other <I>S</I>rauta sacrifices), he shall perform the Ish<I>t</I>i Vaisv&acirc;nar&icirc;.</P>
<P>11. Let him not make an offering of food obtained as alms from a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra.</P>
<P>12. If he has begged articles for a sacrifice (and obtained them), let him employ them all for that purpose (and never for himself).</P>
<P>13. Every evening and morning let him offer up the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva;</P>
<P>14. And<SUP>[1]</SUP> let him give alms to an Ascetic (afterwards).</P>
<P>15. For giving alms and showing due honour to the recipient (by pouring water on his hands both before and afterwards) he obtains the same reward as for giving a cow.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[8. <SUP>1</SUP> According to Nand., the Soma-sacrifices here referred to are of the k&acirc;mya species (offered in order to obtain the gratification of a special desire).</P>
<P>14. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. infers from the use of the particle <I>k</I>a, and from a text of Par&acirc;<I>s</I>ara, that an injunction to give alms to a student is also intended here.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_193"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 193</FONT></A></P>
<P>16. If there is no ascetic (or other person worthy to receive alms), he must give a mouthful to cows;</P>
<P>17. Or he must cast it into fire.</P>
<P>18. If there is food in the house, he must not reject a mendicant, (who arrives) after he has taken his meal himself.</P>
<P>19. A householder has five places where animals are liable to be destroyed: his wooden mortar, his slab to grind wheat or condiments upon, his fireplace, his water-pot, and his broom.</P>
<P>20. For the sake of expiating offences committed (by ignorantly destroying life) in those places, he must perform the (five) sacrifices addressed to the Veda, to the gods, to all created beings (or 'to the goblins'), to the manes, and to men.</P>
<P>21. Privately reciting (and teaching) the Veda is the sacrifice addressed to the Veda.</P>
<P>22. The regular burnt-oblation (Vaisvadeva) is the sacrifice addressed to the gods.</P>
<P>23. The Pit<I>ri</I>tarpana (refreshing the manes with food and water) is the sacrifice addressed to the manes.</P>
<P>24. The Bali-offering is the sacrifice addressed to all creatures (or 'to the goblins').</P>
<P>25. The sacrifice addressed to men consists in honouring a guest.</P>
<P>26. He who does not give their share to these five, the gods, his guests, (his wife and children and others,) whom he is bound to maintain, his manes, and himself, is not alive, though he breathes.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[18. 'The expression, "if there is food in the house," indicates that he is not bound to cook a fresh meal for his guest.' (Nand.)]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_194"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 194</FONT></A></P>
<P>27. These (three), the student, the hermit, and the ascetic, derive their existence from the order of householders; therefore must a householder not treat them with disdain, when they have arrived (at his house at the proper time for begging alms).</P>
<P>28. The householder offers sacrifices, the householder practises austerities, the householder distributes gifts; therefore is the order of householders, the first of all.</P>
<P>29. The <I>Ri</I>shis<SUP>[1]</SUP>, the manes, the gods, all creatures (dogs, &amp;c.), and guests beg householders for support; therefore is the order of householders the best of all.</P>
<P>30. If a householder is intent upon pursuing the three objects of life (virtue, love, and wealth), upon constantly distributing presents of food, upon worshipping the gods, upon honouring the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, upon discharging his duty of privately reciting (and teaching) the Veda, and upon refreshing the manes (with oblations of balls of rice, water, and the like), he will attain the world of Indra.</P>
