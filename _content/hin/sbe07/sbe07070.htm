Then he must sprinkle water all around it, with the Mantra, "Forsooth, I sprinkle righteousness around thee" After that he must sip water with the Mantra, "Thou art an imperishable basis" (Taitt. &Acirc;ra<I>ny</I>. X, 32, rendered according to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's Commentary), and offer up five oblations to Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, &amp;c. (see Dr. B&uuml;hler's note on &Acirc;past. II, 1, 1, 2). Finally he must eat in silence, without blaming the food, and taking care to leave some remnant of it in the dish, and sip water again, with the Mantra, "Thou art an imperishable covering"' (Taitt. &Acirc;ra<I>ny</I>. X, 35, according to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a).]</P>
