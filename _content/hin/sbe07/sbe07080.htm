<FONT SIZE=2><P>[LXXVIII. 8-35. M. III, 277; Y. I, 264-267.--36-50. M. III, 276; Y. I, 261-263; &Acirc;past. II, 7, 16, 8-22; Gaut. XV, 4.--52, 53. M. III, 273, 274. Regarding S&ucirc;tras 1-7, see the Introduction.</P>
<P>1. Nand. states that the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas mentioned in this chapter are of the k&acirc;mya sort, i.e. 'offered for the gratification of a special desire.'</P>
<P>2. <SUP>1</SUP> This is Nand.'s interpretation of the term saubh&acirc;gyam. It might also be taken in its usual acceptation, as meaning 'happiness.'</P>
<P>8-35. Those names of the twenty-eight Nakshatras or lunar asterisms, which I have included in parentheses, are from Nand.'s Commentary. Most of the objects which are said to be gained by the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas mentioned in S&ucirc;tras 8-35 are connected etymologically, or through their import, with the names of the particular Nakshatras under which they are performed. Thus the term push<I>t</I>i, 'prosperity,' in S&ucirc;tra 13, is etymologically connected with Pushya; the term mitra, 'friend,' in 22, is connected with Maitra; the term r&acirc;<I>g</I>yam, 'royalty,' in 23, is connected with <I>S</I>&acirc;kra, the name of that Nakshatra being derived from <I>S</I>akra, a name of Indra, the king of the gods, &amp;c.]</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[44. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. infers from a passage of Y&acirc;<I>g</I>&ntilde;avalkya (I, 266) that the term 'cattle' here refers to horses and other one-hoofed animals. See, however, the next S&ucirc;tra.</P>
<P>48. The term saubh&acirc;gyam is stated by Nand. (with reference to Y. I, 2 64) to denote 'superiority among his kindred,' in this S&ucirc;tra. But there is no cogent reason for deviating here from that interpretation of the term which he proposes in his Commentary on S&ucirc;tras 2 and 16. See above.]</P>
