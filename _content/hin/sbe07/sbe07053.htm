<P>30. Likewise, for eating (unawares the flesh of) animals whose hoof is not cloven (such as horses),</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[26. Nand. argues from a passage of Pra<I>k</I>etas, that the flesh of the following other animals, dogs, jackals, cocks, boars, carnivorous animals in general, Gangetic porpoises, apes, elephants, horses, tame hogs, cows, and human beings, is also implied here. But if that were the case, S&ucirc;tra 26 would be partly a mere repetition of, and partly opposed to, the rules laid down in S&ucirc;tras 33 and 22.</P>
<P>27. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. infers from a passage of the Br&acirc;hma-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a, that the use of the particle <I>k</I>a further implies a prohibition to eat the flesh on the back, or flesh which had been interred in the ground, or covered with earth, fried meat, and the flesh of the uterus.]</P>

<P>34. For eating (unawares the mushroom called) <I>Kh</I>attr&acirc;ka, or (the mushroom called) Kavaka, he must perform the S&acirc;ntapana penance.</P>
<P>35. For eating (unawares) stale food, other than a mess prepared with barley (such as cakes), or with wheat (such as, gruel), or with milk (boiled with rice, or mixed with coagulated milk, or otherwise dressed), and dishes sprinkled with fat (such as clarified butter), sour gruel, and sweetmeats, he must fast (for one day).</P>
<P>36. Likewise, (for eating unawares) the juice flowing from an incision in a tree, (plants raised in) unclean substances (such as excrements and the like), and the red exudation of trees.</P>
<P>37. Also, (for eating unawares) the root of the water-lily; (and for eating) rice boiled with sesamum. or with beans, Sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;va<SUP>[1]</SUP>, rice boiled in milk with sugar, pastry, <I>S</I>ashkul&icirc; (cakes), or food destined for</P>

<P>37. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. interprets this term by utkarik&acirc;, which, according to Wilson, is a sort of sweetmeat made with milk, treacle, and clarified butter. Kull&ucirc;ka (on M. V, 7) has a somewhat different interpretation.]</P>

<P>the gods, if those dishes have not been announced to the gods first; and (for eating) food destined for burnt-oblations.</P>
<P>38. Also, for tasting the milk of any animal, save the milk of cows, goats, and buffalos (and for tasting any eatables made of such milk)<SUP>[1]</SUP>.</P>
<P>39. Also, (for tasting the milk) of those animals (cows and the rest) within ten days after their giving birth to a young one.</P>
<P>40. And (for tasting) the milk of a cow whose milk flows of itself, of one that has just taken the bull<SUP>[1]</SUP>, or of one whose calf is dead<SUP>[2]</SUP>.</P>
<P>41. And (for tasting the milk of a cow) that has been feeding upon ordures.</P>
<P>42. And (for tasting) any such food as has turned sour (but not that which is sour by nature, like sorrel), except sour milk (and what is made with it).</P>
<P>43. A student, who partakes (unawares) of a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha repast, must fast for three days.</P>
<P>44. And he must remain in water for a whole day (afterwards).</P>
<P>45. If he eats honey or meat (at any time), he must perform the Pr&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;patya penance.</P>

<P>40. <SUP>1</SUP> Sandhin&icirc; means 'a cow that has just taken the bull,' or 'a female animal that gives milk once a day,' or 'a cow that is milked by the calf of another cow.' (Nand.) Haradatta (see &Acirc;past. I, 5, 17, 23; Gaut. XVII, 25) interprets it by 'an animal giving milk while big with young.' For other interpretations, see the Petersburg Dictionary.--<SUP>2</SUP> 'The particle <I>k</I>a indicates that animals bearing twins have also to be included in this prohibition.' (Nand.) See Gaut. loc. cit.]</P>

<P>food of a cat, of a crow, of an ichneumon, or of a rat, he must drink water in which the Brahmasuvar<I>k</I>al&acirc; plant has been boiled.</P>
<P>47. For eating (unawares) what has been left by a dog, he must fast for one day, and drink Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>agavya (afterwards).</P>
<P>48. For tasting (knowingly) the excrements of five-toed animals (excepting human excrements), he must (fast) for seven days (and drink Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>agavya on the eighth).</P>
<P>49. If one (not a student) eats (unawares) of a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha repast consisting of raw food, he must subsist on milk for seven days.</P>
<P>50. If a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a eats what has been left by a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra, (he must also subsist on milk) for seven days.</P>
<P>51. If he eats what has been left by a Vai<I>s</I>ya, (he must subsist upon milk) for five days.</P>
<P>52. If he eats what has been left by a Kshatriya, (he must subsist upon milk) for three days.</P>
<P>53. If he eats what has been left by another Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, (he must subsist upon milk) for one day.</P>
<P>54. If a Kshatriya eats what has been left by a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra, (he must undergo the same penance) for five days.</P>
<P>55. If he eats what has been left by a Vai<I>s</I>ya, (he must undergo it) for three days;</P>
<P>56. And so must a Vai<I>s</I>ya, if he eats what has been left by a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[50. Nand. explains that he should drink Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>agavya alternately with milk. This explanation extends to the following S&ucirc;tras also (up to S&ucirc;tra 56). He further argues from another Smriti text that the term <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra means '<I>S</I>&ucirc;dras and women' here.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A></P>
<P>57. For (knowingly) eating (undressed) food, which has been left by a <I>K</I>a<I>nd</I>&acirc;la (or Svapa<I>k</I>a or other member of the seven lowest castes), he must fast for three days.</P>
<P>58. For (unawares) eating dressed food (left by such), the Par&acirc;ka penance is ordained.</P>
<P>59. Let no Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a ever eat (the flesh of) beasts which has not been consecrated with Mantras; but if it has been consecrated with Mantras, he may eat it, following the eternal rule (laid down in the Veda).</P>
<P>60. As many hairs as the beast has, which he has slain in this world, for so many days will the killer of a beast for other purposes than a (<I>S</I>rauta or Sm&acirc;rta) sacrifice, suffer terrible pangs in this world and in the next<SUP>[1]</SUP>.</P>
<P>61. It is for sacrifices that beasts have been created by the Self-existent (Brahman) himself. Sacrificing causes the whole universe to prosper; therefore is the slaughter (of beasts) for a sacrifice no slaughter.</P>
<P>62. The sin of him who kills deer for the sake of gain, is not so great (and visited less heavily) in the world to come, than the sin of him who eats meat which has not been offered to the gods.</P>
<P>63. Plants, cattle, trees, amphibious animals, and birds, which have been destroyed for the purposes of sacrifice, obtain exaltation in another existence (in which they are born as Gandharvas, or other beings of a high rank).</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[60. <SUP>1</SUP> My translation follows Nand. It is, however, doubtful, whether the reading is correct; see Manu V, 38.</P>
<P>62. This is because the former kills animals in order to support his family, whereas the latter eats meat merely in order to tickle his palate. (Nand.)]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A></P>
<P>64. When honouring a guest, at a sacrifice, or when worshipping the manes, or the gods, a man may slay cattle, but not otherwise on any account.</P>
<P>65. That twice-born man who, knowing the exact truth (promulgated) in the Veda, slays cattle for the sacrifices (ordained in the Veda), will convey himself and the cattle (slain by him) to a blissful abode.</P>
<P>66. A self-controlled<SUP>[1]</SUP> man of a twice-born caste, whether he be a householder, or be dwelling with his spiritual teacher, or in the forest, must never slay an animal in opposition to the precepts of the Veda, even in cases of distress.</P>
<P>67. That slaughter which is in accordance with the precepts of the Veda, and has been fixed for this world of movable and immovable creatures, should be considered as no slaughter at all; because it is from the Veda that law shines forth.</P>
<P>68. He who hurts animals that do not hurt any one, merely in order to afford pleasure to himself, will never obtain happiness, whether living or dead<SUP>[1]</SUP>.</P>
<P>69. He who gives no living creature intentionally the pain of confining or killing (or hurting) it, from benevolence towards all (creatures), will enjoy everlasting happiness.</P>
<P>70. Whatever he thinks of, whatever he strives for, and whatever he desires in his heart, all that is easily obtained by him who does not injure any created being.</P>
<P>71. Meat cannot be obtained without injuring an</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[66. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. interprets the term &acirc;tmav&acirc;n by sa<I>m</I>ny&acirc;s&icirc;, 'an ascetic, or member of the fourth order,' apparently because the first three orders are mentioned in this <I>S</I>loka. I have followed Kull&ucirc;ka's interpretation (on M.V, 43).</P>
<P>68. <SUP>1</SUP> 'But it is no sin to kill tigers or other beasts of prey.' (Nand.)]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A></P>
<P>animal, and the murder of animals excludes the murderer from heaven, therefore must meat be avoided.</P>
<P>72. Reflecting upon the origin of flesh<SUP>[1]</SUP> and upon the (sin of) hurting or confining animated creatures, he must abstain from animal food of any kind.</P>
<P>73. He who transgresses not the law and eats not flesh like a Pis&acirc;<I>k</I>a, is beloved by men and remains free from disease.</P>
<P>74. He who gives his consent to the killing of an animal, he who cuts it up, he who kills it, the purchaser and the seller, he who prepares it, he who serves it up, and he who eats it, all these are denominated slaughterers of an animal.</P>
<P>75. There is no greater sinner than he who, without giving their share to the manes and to the gods, wants to increase his own flesh with the flesh of another creature.</P>
<P>76. Those two, he who performs a horse-sacrifice annually for a hundred years and he who does not eat meat, shall both obtain the same recompense for their virtue.</P>
<P>77. By eating (wild rice or other) sacred fruits or roots, and by living upon such grains as are the food of hermits, a man does not reap so high a reward as by avoiding meat</P>
