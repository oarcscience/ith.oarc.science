<P>29. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. thinks that hermits or members of the third order are meant by this term. But it seems preferable to refer it to the <I>Ri</I>shi authors of the Veda, to whom the first of the five sacrifices, the study of the Veda, is more immediately addressed. See &Acirc;past. I, 4, 13, 1; Gaut. V, 3.</P>
