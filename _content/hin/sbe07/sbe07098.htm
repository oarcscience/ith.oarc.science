<P>21. He must not pronounce a benediction.</P>
<P>22. He must not salute any one reverentially.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[10. 'Empty' means 'inhabited by no one else,' and implies that the house in question should be situated in a dark place, difficult of access. (Nand.)</P>
<P>11. 'The article v&acirc; implies that he must live there alone.' (Nand.)</P>
<P>14, 15. Nand. assigns as the reason of both these rules, 'lest he should not kill some insect.' Kull&ucirc;ka (on M. VI, 46) gives the same reason for the second rule, but the looking down, according to him, is ordained in. order that be may not accidentally tread upon a hair or other impure substance.</P>
<P>17. The sense of this S&ucirc;tra is, that in doubtful cases he must act as his mind prompts him to do. (Nand.)</P>
<P>21. 'The meaning is, that he must not utter a benediction when he has been reverentially saluted by any one. He must confine himself to saying, "O N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a." Others explain, that he must not utter a benediction in begging food.' (Nand.)</P>
<P>22. 'The sense is, that he must not salute any one reverentially who has reverentially saluted him, nor return his greeting {footnote p. 281} otherwise than by saying, "O N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a." Others explain, that he must not make an obeisance in begging food.' (Nand.)]</P>

<P>29. And upon (the pain arising from) the (five) naturally inherent (affections).</P>
<P>30. On his having to dwell in an embryo, covered with everlasting darkness;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[24. Nand. quotes a passage of the Yoga<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, which states that one Dh&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; = three Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;y&acirc;mas (stoppings or regulations of the breath). A passage of the G&acirc;ru<I>d</I>a-pura<I>n</I>a quoted in the Petersburg Dictionary) states that one Dh&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; = sixteen Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;y&acirc;mas. I have taken the term dh&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; in its ordinary acceptation of 'retention of an idea' (cf. Wilson, Vish<I>n</I>u-pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a V, 237) with regard to an analogous passage of Y&acirc;<I>g</I>&ntilde;avalkya (III, 201), which is also quoted by Nand.,</P>
<P>28. According to Nand,, the particle <I>k</I>a is used to include other diseases, love, anxiety or wrath, caused by enemies, and other mental pangs.</P>
<P>29. They are, ignorance, egotism, love, wrath, and dread of temporal suffering (Nand., according to Pata&ntilde;<I>g</I>ali). The particle <I>k</I>a, according to Nand., is used in order to imply meditation upon the thousand births which man has to pass through, as stated by Y&acirc;<I>g</I>&ntilde;avalkya (III, 64).]</P>

<P>41. '(And that) even what is called pleasure, on account of the absence of pain, is of a transient nature;</P>
<P>42. (And that) he who is unable to enjoy such pleasures (from sickness or some such cause), or who is unable to procure them (from poverty), suffers severe pangs.</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[46. The particle <I>k</I>a, according to Nand., refers to the fact that the human body is defiled by the touch of impure objects.</P>
