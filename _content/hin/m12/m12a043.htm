<p>thee under innumerable names.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Salutations to thee, O Creator of the Universe! Thou art the soul of the Universe and the Universe hath sprung from thee. Thou art Vishnu, thou art Jishnu, thou art Hari, thou art Krishna, thou art Vaikuntha, and thou art the foremost of all beings. Thou hast, as said in the <i>Puranas</i>, taken thy birth seven times in the womb of Aditi. It was thou that tookest birth in the womb of Prishni.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The learned say that thou art the three <i>Yugas</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> All thy achievements are sacred. Thou art the lord of our senses. Thou art the great Lord worshipped in sacrifices. Thou art called the great swan. Thou art three-eyed Sambhu. Thou art One, though known as Vibhu and Damodara. Thou art the great Boar, thou art Fire, thou art the Sun, thou hast the bull for the device on thy banner, and thou hast Garuda also as thy device. Thou art the grinder of hostile hosts, thou art the Being that pervadest every form in the universe and thou art of irresistible prowess. Thou art the foremost of all things, thou art fierce, thou art the generalissimo in battle, thou art the Truth, thou art the giver of food, and thou art Guha (the celestial generalissimo); Thyself unfading, thou causest thy foes to fade and waste. Thou art the Brahmana of pure blood, and thou art those that have sprung from intermixture. Thou art great. Thou walkest on high, thou art the mountains, and thou art called <i>Vrishadarbha</i> and <i>Vrishakapi</i>. Thou art the Ocean, thou art without attributes, thou hast three humps, thou hast three abodes, and thou takest human forms on earth, descending from heaven. Thou art Emperor, thou art <i>Virat</i>, and thou art <i>Swarat</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Thou art the Chief of the celestials, and thou art the cause whence the Universe has sprung. Thou art Almighty, thou art existence in every form, thou art without form, thou art Krishna, and thou art fire. Thou art the Creator, thou art the sire of the celestial physicians, thou art (the sage) Kapila, and thou art the Dwarf.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Thou art Sacrifice embodied, thou art Dhruva,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> thou art Garuda, and thou art called <i>Yajnasena</i>. Thou art Sikhandin, thou art Nahusha, and thou art Vabhru. Thou art the constellation <i>Punarvasu</i> extended in the firmament, Thou art exceedingly tawny in hue, thou art the sacrifice known by the name of <i>Uktha</i>, thou art Sushena, thou art the drum (that sends forth its sound on every side). The track of thy car-wheels is light. Thou art the lotus of Prosperity, thou art the cloud called <i>Pushkara</i>, and thou art decked with floral wreaths. Thou art affluent, thou art puissant, thou art the most subtle, and it is thou whom the <i>Vedas</i> describe. Thou art the great receptacle of waters, thou art Brahman, thou art the sacred refuge, and thou knowest the abodes of all. Thou art called <i>Hiranyagarbha</i>, thou art the sacred mantras <i>swadha</i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and <i>swaha</i>, thou art Kesava. Thou art the cause whence all this hath sprung, and thou art its dissolution. In the beginning it is thou that createst the universe. This universe is under thy control, O Creator of the universe! Salutations to thee, O wielder of <i>Sarnga</i>, discus and sword!' Thus hymned by king Yudhishthira the just in the midst of the court, the lotus-eyed Krishna became pleased. That foremost one of the Yadavas then began to gladden the eldest son of Pandu with many agreeable speeches."</p>
