<p align="center">(<i>Enter the clown</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>sighing</i>). Damn! Damn! Damn! I'm tired of being friends with this sporting king. "There's a deer!" he shouts, "There's a boar!" And off he chases on a summer noon through woods where shade is few and far between. We drink hot, stinking water from the mountain streams, flavoured with leaves--nasty! At odd times we get a little tepid meat to eat. And the horses and the elephants make such a noise that I can't even be comfortable at night. Then the hunters and the bird-chasers--damn &#8217;em--wake me up bright and early. They do make an ear-splitting rumpus when they start for the woods. But even that isn't the whole misery. There's a new pimple growing on the old boil. He left us behind and went hunting a deer. And there in a hermitage they say he found--oh, dear! oh, dear! he found a hermit-girl named Shakuntala. Since then he hasn't a thought of going back to town. I lay awake all night, thinking about it. What can I do? Well, I'll see my friend when he is dressed and beautified. (<i>He walks and looks about</i>.) Hello! Here he comes, with his bow in his hand, and his girl in his heart. He is wearing a wreath of wild flowers! I'll pretend to be all knocked up. Perhaps I can get a rest that way. (<i>He stands, leaning on his stag. Enter the king, as described</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (<i>to himself</i>).</p>  
<p><DIR>Although my darling is not lightly won,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;She seemed to love me, and my hopes are bright;<br> Though love be balked ere joy be well begun,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A common longing is itself delight.</DIR></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> (<i>Smiling</i>.) Thus does a lover deceive himself. He judges his love's feelings by his own desires.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>Her glance was loving--but 'twas not for me;<br> Her step was slow--'twas grace, not coquetry;<br> Her speech was short--to her detaining friend.<br> In things like these love reads a selfish end!</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>standing as before</i>). Well, king, I can't move my hand. I can only greet you with my voice.</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (<i>looking and smiling</i>). What makes you lame?</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Good! You hit a man in the eye, and then ask him why the tears come.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. I do not understand you. Speak plainly.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. When a reed bends over like a hunchback, do you blame the reed or the river-current?</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. The river-current, of course.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. And you are to blame for my troubles.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. How so?</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. It's a fine thing for you to neglect your royal duties and such a sure job--to live in the woods! What's the good of talking? Here I am, a Brahman, and my joints are all shaken up by this eternal running after wild animals, so that I can't move. Please be good to me. Let us have a rest for just one day.</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (<i>to himself</i>). He says this. And I too, when I remember Kanva's daughter, have little desire for the chase. For</p>  
<p><DIR>The bow is strung, its arrow near;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I cannot bend<br> That bow against the fawns who share<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Soft glances with their friend.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>observing the king</i>). He means more than he says. I might as well weep in the woods.</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (<i>smiling</i>). What more could I mean? I have been thinking that I ought to take my friend's advice.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>cheerfully</i>). Long life to you, then. (<i>He unstiffens</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Wait. Hear me out.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Well, sir?</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. When you are rested, you must be my companion in another task--an easy one.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Crushing a few sweetmeats?</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. I will tell you presently.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Pray command my leisure.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Who stands without? (<i>Enter the door-keeper</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>Door-keeper</i>. I await your Majesty's commands.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Raivataka, summon the general.</p>  
<p><i>Door-keeper</i>. Yes, your Majesty. (<i>He goes out, then returns with the general</i>.) Follow me, sir. There is his Majesty, listening to our conversation. Draw near, sir.</p>  
<p><i>General</i> (<i>observing the king, to himself</i>). Hunting is declared to be a sin, yet it brings nothing but good to the king. See!</p>  
<p><DIR>He does not heed the cruel sting<br> Of his recoiling, twanging string;<br> The mid-day sun, the dripping sweat<br> Affect him not, nor make him fret;<br> His form, though sinewy and spare,<br> Is most symmetrically fair;<br> No mountain-elephant could be<br> More filled with vital strength than he.</DIR></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> (<i>He approaches</i>.) Victory to your Majesty! The forest is full of deer-tracks, and beasts of prey cannot be far off. What better occupation could we have?</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Bhadrasena, my enthusiasm is broken. Madhavya has been preaching against hunting.</p>  
<p><i>General</i> (<i>aside to the clown</i>). Stick to it, friend Madhavya. I will humour the king a moment. (<i>Aloud</i>.) Your Majesty, he is a chattering idiot. Your Majesty may judge by his own case whether hunting is an evil. Consider:</p>  
<p><DIR>The hunter's form grows sinewy, strong, and light;<br> He learns, from beasts of prey, how wrath and fright<br> Affect the mind; his skill he loves to measure<br> With moving targets. &#8217;Tis life's chiefest pleasure.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>angrily</i>). Get out! Get out with your strenuous life! The king has come to his senses. But you, you son of a slave-wench, can go chasing from forest to forest, till you fall into the jaws of some old bear that is looking for a deer or a jackal.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Bhadrasena, I cannot take your advice, because I am in the vicinity of a hermitage. So for to-day</p>  
<p><DIR>The horn&egrave;d buffalo may shake<br> The turbid water of the lake; <A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A><br> Shade-seeking deer may chew the cud,<br> Boars trample swamp-grass in the mud;<br> The bow I bend in hunting, may<br> Enjoy a listless holiday.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>General</i>. Yes, your Majesty.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Send back the archers who have gone ahead. And forbid the soldiers to vex the hermitage, or even to approach it. Remember:</p>  
<p><DIR>There lurks a hidden fire in each<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Religious hermit-bower;<br> Cool sun-stones kindle if assailed<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;By any foreign power.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>General</i>. Yes, your Majesty.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Now will you get out with your strenuous life? (<i>Exit genera</i>l.)</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (<i>to his attendants</i>). Lay aside your hunting dress. And you, Raivataka, return to your post of duty.</p>  
<p><i>Raivataka</i>. Yes, your Majesty. (<i>Exit</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. You have got rid of the vermin. Now be seated on this flat stone, over which the trees spread their canopy of shade. I can't sit down till you do.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Lead the way.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Follow me. (<i>They walk about and sit down</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Friend Madhavya, you do not know what vision is. You have not seen the fairest of all objects.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. I see you, right in front of me.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Yes, every one thinks himself beautiful. But I was speaking of Shakuntala, the ornament of the hermitage.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I mustn't add fuel to the flame. (<i>Aloud</i>.) But you can't have her because she is a hermit-girl. What is the use of seeing her?</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Fool!</p>  
<p><DIR>And is it selfish longing then,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That draws our souls on high<br> Through eyes that have forgot to wink,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As the new moon climbs the sky?</DIR></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Besides, Dushyanta's thoughts dwell on no forbidden object.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Well, tell me about her.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>King</i>.</p>  
<p><DIR>Sprung from a nymph of heaven<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Wanton and gay,<br> Who spurned the blessing given,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Going her way;</p>  
<p>By the stern hermit taken<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In her most need:<br> So fell the blossom shaken,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Flower on a weed.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>laughing</i>). You are like a man who gets tired of good dates and longs for sour tamarind. All the pearls of the palace are yours, and you want this girl!</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. My friend, you have not seen her, or you could not talk so.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. She must be charming if she surprises you.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Oh, my friend, she needs not many words.</p>  
<p><DIR>She is God's vision, of pure thought<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Composed in His creative mind;<br> His reveries of beauty wrought<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The peerless pearl of womankind.<br> So plays my fancy when I see<br> How great is God, how lovely she.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. How the women must hate her!</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. This too is in my thought.</p>  
<p><DIR>She seems a flower whose fragrance none has tasted,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A gem uncut by workman's tool,<br> A branch no desecrating hands have wasted,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh honey, beautifully cool.</p>  
<p>No man on earth deserves to taste her beauty,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Her blameless loveliness and worth,<br> Unless he has fulfilled man's perfect duty--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And is there such a one on earth?</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Marry her quick, then, before the poor girl falls into the hands of some oily-headed hermit.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. She is dependent on her father, and he is not here.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. But how does she feel toward you?</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>King</i>. My friend, hermit-girls are by their very nature timid. And yet</p>  
<p><DIR>When I was near, she could not look at me;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled--but not to me--and half denied it;<br> She would not show her love for modesty,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet did not try so very hard to hide it.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Did you want her to climb into your lap the first time she saw you?</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. But when she went away with her friends, she almost showed that she loved me.</p>  
<p><DIR>When she had hardly left my side,<br> "I cannot walk," the maiden cried,<br> And turned her face, and feigned to free<br> The dress not caught upon the tree.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. She has given you some memories to chew on. I suppose that is why you are so in love with the pious grove.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. My friend, think of some pretext under which we may return to the hermitage.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. What pretext do you need? Aren't you the king?</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. What of that?</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Collect the taxes on the hermits' rice.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Fool! It is a very different tax which these hermits pay--one that outweighs heaps of gems.</p>  
<p><DIR>The wealth we take from common men,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Wastes while we cherish;<br> These share with us such holiness<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As ne&#8217;er can perish.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Voices behind the scenes</i>. Ah, we have found him.</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (<i>listening</i>). The voices are grave and tranquil. These must be hermits. (<i>Enter the door-keeper</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>Door-keeper</i>. Victory, O King. There are two hermit-youths at the gate.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Bid them enter at once.</p>  
<p><i>Door-keeper</i>. Yes, your Majesty. (<i>He goes out, then returns with the youths</i>.) Follow me.</p>  
<p><i>First youth</i> (<i>looking at the king</i>). A majestic presence, yet it inspires confidence. Nor is this wonderful in a king who is half a saint. For to him</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_23"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 23</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>The splendid palace serves as hermitage;<br> His royal government, courageous, sage,<br> Adds daily to his merit; it is given<br> To him to win applause from choirs of heaven<br> Whose anthems to his glory rise and swell,<br> Proclaiming him a king, and saint as well.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Second youth</i>. My friend, is this Dushyanta, friend of Indra?</p>  
<p><i>First youth</i>. It is.</p>  
<p><i>Second youth</i>.</p>  
<p><DIR>Nor is it wonderful that one whose arm<br> Might bolt a city gate, should keep from harm<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The whole broad earth dark-belted by the sea;<br> For when the gods in heaven with demons fight,<br> Dushyanta's bow and Indra's weapon bright<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Are their reliance for the victory.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>The two youths</i> (<i>approaching</i>). Victory, O King!</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (<i>rising</i>). I salute you.</p>  
<p><i>The two youths</i>. All hail! (<i>They offer fruit</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (<i>receiving it and bowing low</i>). May I know the reason of your coming?</p>  
<p><i>The two youths</i>. The hermits have learned that you are here, and they request------</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. They command rather.</p>  
<p><i>The two youths</i>. The powers of evil disturb our pious life in the absence of the hermit-father. We therefore ask that you will remain a few nights with your charioteer to protect the hermitage.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. I shall be most happy to do so.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>to the king</i>). You rather seem to like being collared this way.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Raivataka, tell my charioteer to drive up, and to bring the bow and arrows.</p>  
<p><i>Raivataka</i>. Yes, your Majesty. (<i>Exit</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>The two youths</i>.</p>  
<p><DIR>Thou art a worthy scion of<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The kings who ruled our nation<br> And found, defending those in need,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Their truest consecration.</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Pray go before. And I will follow straightway.</p>  
<p><i>The two youths</i>. Victory, O King! (<i>Exeunt</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Madhavya, have you no curiosity to see Shakuntala?</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. I did have an unending curiosity, but this talk about the powers of evil has put an end to it.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Do not fear. You will be with me.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. I'll stick close to your chariot-wheel. (<i>Enter the door-keeper</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>Door-keeper</i>. Your Majesty, the chariot is ready, and awaits your departure to victory. But one Karabhaka has come from the city, a messenger from the queen-mother.</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (respectfully). Sent by my mother?</p>  
<p><i>Door-keeper</i>. Yes.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. Let him enter.</p>  
<p><i>Door-keeper</i> (<i>goes out and returns with</i> KARABHAKA). Karabhaka, here is his Majesty. You may draw near.</p>  
<p><i>Karabhaka</i> (<i>approaching and bowing low</i>). Victory to your Majesty. The queen-mother sends her commands------</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. What are her commands?</p>  
<p><i>Karabhaka</i>. She plans to end a fasting ceremony on the fourth day from to-day. And on that occasion her dear son must not fail to wait upon her.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. On the one side is my duty to the hermits, on the other my mother's command. Neither may be disregarded. What is to be done?</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Stay half-way between, like Trishanku.</p>  
<p>King. In truth, I am perplexed.</p>  
<p><DIR>Two inconsistent duties sever<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;My mind with cruel shock,<br> As when the current of a river<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is split upon a rock.</DIR></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> (<i>He reflects</i>.) My friend, the queen-mother has always felt toward you as toward a son. Do you return, tell her what duty keeps me here, and yourself perform the offices of a son.</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. You don't think I am afraid of the devils?</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (<i>smiling</i>). O mighty Brahman, who could suspect it?</p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. But I want to travel like a prince.</p>  
<p><i>King</i>. I will send all the soldiers with you, for the pious grove must not be disturbed.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Clown</i> (<i>strutting</i>). Aha! Look at the heir-apparent!</p>  
<p><i>King</i> (<i>to himself</i>). The fellow is a chatterbox. He might betray my longing to the ladies of the palace. Good, then! (<i>He takes the clown by the hand. Aloud</i>.) Friend Madhavya, my reverence for the hermits draws me to the hermitage. Do not think that I am really in love with the hermit-girl. Just think:</p>  
<p><DIR>A king, and a girl of the calm hermit-grove,<br> Bred with the fawns, and a stranger to love!<br> Then do not imagine a serious quest;<br> The light words I uttered were spoken in jest.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Clown</i>. Oh, I understand that well enough.</p>  
<p align="right">(<i>Exeunt ambo</i>.)</p>
