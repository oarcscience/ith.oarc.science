<p><i>The Seasons</i> is an unpretentious poem, describing in six short cantos the six seasons into which the Hindus divide the year. The title is perhaps a little misleading, as the description is not objective, but deals with the feelings awakened by each season in a pair of young lovers. Indeed, the poem might be called a Lover's Calendar. Kalidasa's authorship has been doubted, without very cogent argument. The question is not of much interest, as <i>The Seasons</i> would neither add greatly to his reputation nor subtract from it.</p>  
<p>The whole poem contains one hundred and forty-four stanzas, or something less than six hundred lines of verse. There follow a few stanzas selected from each canto.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">SUMMER</h3>  
<p><DIR>Pitiless heat from heaven pours<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;By day, but nights are cool;<br> Continual bathing gently lowers<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The water in the pool;<br> The evening brings a charming peace:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For summer-time is here<br> When love that never knows surcease,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is less imperious, dear.</p>  
<p>Yet love can never fall asleep;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For he is waked to-day<br> By songs that all their sweetness keep<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And lutes that softly play,<br> By fans with sandal-water wet<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That bring us drowsy rest,<br> By strings of pearls that gently fret<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Full many a lovely breast.</p>  
<p>The sunbeams like the fires are hot<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That on the altar wake; <A NAME="page_212"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 212</FONT></A><br> The enmity is quite forgot<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of peacock and of snake;<br> The peacock spares his ancient foe,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For pluck and hunger fail;<br> He hides his burning head below<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of his tail.</p>  
<p>Beneath the garland of the rays<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That leave no corner cool,<br> The water vanishes in haze<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And leaves a muddy pool;<br> The cobra does not hunt for food<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor heed the frog at all<br> Who finds beneath the serpent's hood<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A sheltering parasol.</p>  
<p>Dear maiden of the graceful song,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To you may summer's power<br> Bring moonbeams clear and garlands long<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And breath of trumpet-flower,<br> Bring lakes that countless lilies dot,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Refreshing water-sprays,<br> Sweet friends at evening, and a spot<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Cool after burning days.</DIR></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE RAINS</h3>  
<p><DIR>The rain advances like a king<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In awful majesty;<br> Hear, dearest, how his thunders ring<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like royal drums, and see<br> His lightning-banners wave; a cloud<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For elephant he rides,<br> And finds his welcome from the crowd<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of lovers and of brides.</p>  
<p>The clouds, a mighty army, march<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With drumlike thundering<br> And stretch upon the rainbow's arch<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning's flashing string; <A NAME="page_213"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 213</FONT></A><br> The cruel arrows of the rain<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Smite them who love, apart<br> From whom they love, with stinging pain,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And pierce them to the heart.</p>  
<p>The forest seems to show its glee<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In flowering nipa plants;<br> In waving twigs of many a tree<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Wind-swept, it seems to dance;<br> Its ketak-blossom's opening sheath<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is like a smile put on<br> To greet the rain's reviving breath,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Now pain and heat are gone.</p>  
<p>To you, dear, may the cloudy time<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bring all that you desire,<br> Bring every pleasure, perfect, prime,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To set a bride on fire;<br> May rain whereby life wakes and shines<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is power of life,<br> The unchanging friend of clinging vines,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Shower blessings on my wife.</DIR></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">AUTUMN</h3>  
<p><DIR>The autumn comes, a maiden fair<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In slenderness and grace,<br> With nodding rice-stems in her hair<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And lilies in her face.<br> In flowers of grasses she is clad;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And as she moves along,<br> Birds greet her with their cooing glad<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like bracelets' tinkling song.</p>  
<p>A diadem adorns the night<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of multitudinous stars;<br> Her silken robe is white moonlight,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set free from cloudy bars;<br> And on her face (the radiant moon)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bewitching smiles are shown: <A NAME="page_214"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 214</FONT></A><br> She seems a slender maid, who soon<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Will be a woman grown.</p>  
<p>Over the rice-fields, laden plants<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Are shivering to the breeze;<br> While in his brisk caresses dance<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The blossom-burdened trees;<br> He ruffles every lily-pond<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where blossoms kiss and part,<br> And stirs with lover's fancies fond<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The young man's eager heart.</DIR></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">WINTER</h3>  
<p><DIR>The bloom of tenderer flowers is past<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And lilies droop forlorn,<br> For winter-time is come at last,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Rich with its ripened corn;<br> Yet for the wealth of blossoms lost<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Some hardier flowers appear<br> That bid defiance to the frost<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of sterner days, my dear.</p>  
<p>The vines, remembering summer, shiver<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In frosty winds, and gain<br> A fuller life from mere endeavour<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To live through all that pain;<br> Yet in the struggle and acquist<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They turn as pale and wan<br> As lonely women who have missed<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Known love, now lost and gone.</p>  
<p>Then may these winter days show forth<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To you each known delight,<br> Bring all that women count as worth<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pure happiness and bright;<br> While villages, with bustling cry,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bring home the ripened corn,<br> And herons wheel through wintry sky,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Forget sad thoughts forlorn.</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_215"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">EARLY SPRING</h3>  
<p><DIR>Now, dearest, lend a heedful ear<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And listen while I sing<br> Delights to every maiden dear,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The charms of early spring:<br> When earth is dotted with the heaps<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of corn, when heron-scream<br> Is rare but sweet, when passion leaps<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And paints a livelier dream.</p>  
<p>When all must cheerfully applaud<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A blazing open fire;<br> Or if they needs must go abroad,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is their desire;<br> When everybody hopes to find<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The frosty chill allayed<br> By garments warm, a window-blind<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Shut, and a sweet young maid.</p>  
<p>Then may the days of early spring<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For you be rich and full<br> With love's proud, soft philandering<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And many a candy-pull,<br> With sweetest rice and sugar-cane:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And may you float above<br> The absent grieving and the pain<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of separated love.</DIR></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">SPRING</h3>  
<p><DIR>A stalwart soldier comes, the spring,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who bears the bow of Love;<br> And on that bow, the lustrous string<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is made of bees, that move<br> With malice as they speed the shaft<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of blossoming mango-flower<br> At us, dear, who have never laughed<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;At love, nor scorned his power. <A NAME="page_216"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 216</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Their blossom-burden weights the trees; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The winds in fragrance move;<br> The lakes are bright with lotuses,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The women bright with love;<br> The days are soft, the evenings clear<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And charming; everything<br> That moves and lives and blossoms, dear,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is sweeter, in the spring.</p>  
<p>The groves are beautifully bright<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For many and many a mile<br> With jasmine-flowers that are as white<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As loving woman's smile:<br> The resolution of a saint<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Might well be tried by this;<br> Far more, young hearts that fancies paint<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With dreams of loving bliss.</DIR></p>
