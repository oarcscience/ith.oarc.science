<P>
Still on the ground where R&aacute;ma slept<BR>
Their faithful watch the V&aacute;nars kept.<BR>
There Angad stood o'erwhelmed with grief<BR>
And many a lord and warrior chief;<BR>
And, ranged in densest mass around,<BR>
Their tree-armed legions held the ground.<BR>
Far ranged each V&aacute;nar's eager eye,<BR>
Now swept the land, now sought the sky,<BR>
All fearing, if a leaf was stirred,<BR>
A R&aacute;kshas in the sound they heard.<BR>
The lord of Lank&aacute; in his hall,<BR>
Rejoicing at his foeman's fall,<BR>
Commanded and the warders came<BR>
Who ever watched the Maithil dame.<BR>
'Go,' cried the R&aacute;kshas king, 'relate<BR>
To Janak's child her husband's fate.<BR>
Low on the earth her R&aacute;ma lies,<BR>
And dark in death are Lakshman's eyes.<BR>
Bring forth my car and let her ride<BR>
To view the chieftains side by side.<BR>
The lord to whom her fancy turned<BR>
For whose dear sake my love she spurned,<BR>
Lies smitten, as he fiercely led<BR>
The battle, with his brother dead.<BR>
Lead forth the royal lady: go<BR>
Her husband's lifeless body show.<BR>
Then from all doubt and terror free<BR>
Her softening heart will turn to me.'<BR>
They heard his speech: the car was brought;<BR>

<P>
That shady grove the warders sought<BR>
Where, mourning R&aacute;ma night and day,<BR>
The melancholy lady lay.<BR>
They placed her in the car and through<BR>
The yielding air they swiftly flew.<BR>
The lady looked upon the plain,<BR>
Looked on the heaps of V&aacute;nar slain,<BR>
Saw where, triumphant in the fight,<BR>
Thronged the fierce rovers of the night,<BR>
And V&aacute;nar chieftains, mournful-eyed,<BR>
Watched by the fallen brothers' side.<BR>
There stretched upon his gory bed<BR>
Each brother lay as lie the dead,<BR>
With shattered mail and splintered bow<BR>
Pierced by the arrows of the foe.<BR>
When on the pair her eyes she bent,<BR>
Burst from her lips a wild lament<BR>
Her eyes o'erflowed, she groaned and sighed<BR>
And thus in trembling accents cried:<BR>
