<P>
There breathing still with slow faint sighs<BR>
Lay B&aacute;li on the ground: his eyes,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Damp with the tears of death, he raised,<BR>
On conquering Sugr&iacute;va gazed,<BR>
And then in clearest speech expressed<BR>
The tender feelings of his breast;<BR>
'Not to my charge, Sugr&iacute;va, lay<BR>
Thine injuries avenged to-day;<BR>
But rather blame resistless Fate<BR>
That urged me on infuriate.<BR>
Fate ne'er agreed our lives to bless<BR>
With simultaneous happiness:<BR>
To dwell like brothers side by side<BR>
In tender love was still denied.<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' realm is thine to-day:<BR>
Begin, O King, thy rightful sway; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_605"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
for I must go at Yama's call<BR>
To sojourn in his gloomy hall;<BR>
Must part and leave this very hour<BR>
My life, my realm, my kingly power,<BR>
And go instead of these to gain<BR>
Bright glory free from spot and stain.<BR>
Now at thy hands one boon I seek<BR>
With the last words my lips shall speak,<BR>
And, though it be no easy thing,<BR>
perform the task I give thee, King.<BR>
This son of mine, no foolish boy,<BR>
Worthy of bliss and nursed in joy,--<BR>
See, prostrate on the ground he lies,<BR>
The hot tears welling from his eyes--<BR>
The child I love so well, more sweet<BR>
Than life itself, for woe unmeet,--<BR>
To him be kindly favour shown:<BR>
O guard and keep him as thine own.<BR>
Retain him ever by thy side,<BR>
His father, helper, friend, and guide.<BR>
From fear and woe his young life save,<BR>
And give him all his father gave.<BR>
Then T&aacute;r&aacute;'s son in time shall be<BR>
Brave, resolute, and famed like thee,<BR>
And march before thee to the fight<BR>
Where stricken fiends shall own his might.<BR>
While yet a tender stripling, fame<BR>
Shall bruit abroad his warrior name,<BR>
And brigbtlv shall his glory shine<BR>
For exploits worthy of his line.<BR>
Child of Sushen,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_606"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> my T&aacute;r&aacute; well<BR>
Obscurest lore can read and tell;<BR>
And, trained in wondrous art, divines<BR>
Each mystery of boding signs.<BR>
Her solemn warning ne'er despise,<BR>
Do boldly what her lips advise;<BR>
For things to come her eye can see,<BR>
And with her words events agree.<BR>
And for the son of Raghu's sake<BR>
The toil and danger undertake:<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
For breach of faith were grievous wrong,<BR>
Nor wouldst thou be unpunished long.<BR>
Now, brother, take this chain of gold,<BR>
Gift of celestial hands of old,<BR>
Or when I die its charm will flee,<BR>
And all its might be lost with me.'<BR>

<P>
The loving speech Sugr&iacute;va heard.<BR>
And all his heart with woe was stirred.<BR>
Remorse and gentle pity stole<BR>
Each thought of triumph from his soul:<BR>
Thus fades the light when R&aacute;hu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_607"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> mars<BR>
The glory of the Lord of Stars.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
All angry thoughts were staved and stilled<BR>
And kindly love his bosom filled.<BR>
His brother's word the chief obeyed<BR>
And took the chain as B&aacute;li prayed.<BR>
On little Angad standing nigh<BR>
The dying hero fixed his eye,<BR>
And, ready from this world to part,<BR>
Spoke the fond utterance of his heart:<BR>

<P>
'Let time and place thy thoughts employ:<BR>
In woe be strong, he meek in joy.<BR>
Accept both pain and pleasure, still<BR>
Obedient to Sugr&iacute;va's will.<BR>
Thou hast, my darling, from the first<BR>
With tender care been softly nursed;<BR>
But harder days, if thou wouldst win<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va's love, must now begin.<BR>
To those who hate him ne'er incline,<BR>
Nor count his foe a friend of thine.<BR>
In all thy thoughts his welfare seek,<BR>
Obedient, lowly, faithful, meek.<BR>
Let no rash suit his bosom pain,<BR>
Nor yet from due requsts abstain. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_609"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>
Each is a grievous fault, between<BR>
The two is round the happy mean.'<BR>

<P>
Then B&aacute;li ceased: his eyeballs rolled<BR>
In stress of anguish uncontrolled<BR>
His massive teeth were bared to view,<BR>
And from the frame the spirit flew.<BR>
Their lord and leader dead, the crowd<BR>
Of noblest V&aacute;nars shrieked aloud:<BR>
'Since thou, O King, hast sought the skies<BR>
All desolate Kishkindh&aacute; lies.<BR>
Her woods, where V&aacute;nars loved to rove,<BR>
Are empty now, and hill and grove.<BR>
From every eye the light is fled,<BR>
Since thou, our mighty lord, art dead.<BR>
Thine was the unwearied arm that bore<BR>
The brunt of deadly fight of yore<BR>
With Golabh the Gandharva, when,<BR>
Lasting through five long years and ten,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_352"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 352</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The dreadful conflict knew no stay<BR>
In gloom of night, in glare of day;<BR>
And when the fifteenth year had past<BR>
Thy dire opponent fell at last.<BR>
If such a foeman fell beneath<BR>
Our hero's arm and awful teeth<BR>
Who freed us from our terror, how<BR>
Is conquering B&aacute;li fallen now?'<BR>

<P>
Then when they saw their leader slain<BR>
Great anguish seized the V&aacute;nar train,<BR>
Weeping their mighty chief, as when<BR>
In pastures near a lion's den<BR>
The cows by sudden fear are stirred,<BR>
Slain the bold bull who led the herd.<BR>
And hapless T&aacute;r&aacute; sank below<BR>
The whelming waters of her woe,<BR>
Looked upon B&aacute;li's face and fell<BR>
Beside him whom she loved go well,<BR>
Like a young creeper clinging round<BR>
A tall tree prostrate on the ground.<BR>
