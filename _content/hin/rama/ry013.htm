The Dewy Season &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> came and went;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The spring returned again:<BR>
Then would the king, with mind intent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His sacrifice ordain.<BR>

He came to Rishyas'ring, and bowed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To him of look divine,<BR>
And bade him aid his offering vowed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  For heirs, to save his line.<BR>
Nor would the youth his aid deny:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spake the monarch fair,<BR>
And prayed him for that rite so high<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  All requisites prepare.<BR>
The king to wise Sumantra cried<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Who stood aye ready near;<BR>
'Go summon quick each holy guide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To counsel and to hear.'<BR>
Obedient to his lord's behest<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Away Sumantra sped,<BR>
And brought Vas'ishtha and the rest,<BR>
In Scripture deeply read.<BR>
Suyajna, V&aacute;madeva came,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  J&aacute;vali, Kas'yap's son,<BR>
And old Vas'ishtha, dear to fame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Obedient every one.<BR>
King Das'aratha met them there<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And duly honoured each,<BR>
And spoke in pleasant words his fair<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And salutary speech:<BR>
'In childless longing doomed to pine,<BR>
No happiness, O lords, is mine.<BR>
So have I for this cause decreed<BR>
To slay the sacrificial steed.<BR>
Fain would I pay that offering high<BR>
Wherein the horse is doomed to die,<BR>
With Rishyas'ring his aid to lend,<BR>
And with your glory to befriend.'<BR>

<P>
With loud applause each holy man<BR>
Received his speech, approved the plan,<BR>
And, by the wise Vas'ishtha led,<BR>
Gave praises to the king, and said:<BR>
'The sons thou cravest shalt thou see,<BR>
Of fairest glory, born to thee,<BR>
Whose holy feelings bid thee take<BR>
This righteous course for offspring's sake.'<BR>
Cheered by the ready praise of those<BR>
Whose aid he sought, his spirits rose,<BR>
And thus the king his speech renewed<BR>
With looks of joy and gratitude:<BR>
'Let what the coming rites require<BR>
Be ready as the priests desire,<BR>
And let the horse, ordained to bleed,<BR>
With fitting guard and priest, be freed, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Yonder on Sarj&uacute;'s northern side<BR>
The sacrificial ground provide;<BR>
And let the saving rites, that naught<BR>
Ill-omened may occur, be wrought.<BR>
The offering I announce to-day<BR>
Each lord of earth may claim to pay,<BR>
Provided that his care can guard<BR>


<P>


<P>
the holy rite by flaws unmarred.<BR>
For wandering fiends, whose watchful spite<BR>
Waits eagerly to spoil each rite,<BR>
Hunting with keenest eye detect<BR>
The slightest slip, the least neglect;<BR>
And when the sacred work is crossed<BR>
The workman is that moment lost.<BR>
Let preparation due be made:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Your powers the charge can meet:<BR>
That so the noble rite be paid<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In every point complete.'<BR>
And all the Br&aacute;hmans answered, Yea,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His mandate honouring,<BR>
And gladly promised to obey<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The order of the king.<BR>
They cried with voices raised aloud:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Success attend thine aim!'<BR>
Then bade farewell, and lowly bowed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And hastened whence they came.<BR>
King Das'aratha went within,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His well loved wives to see:<BR>
And said: 'Your lustral rites begin,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  For these shall prosper me.<BR>
A glorious offering I prepare<BR>
That precious fruit of sons may bear.'<BR>
Their lily faces brightened fast<BR>
Those pleasant words to hear,<BR>
As lilies, when the winter's past,<BR>
In lovelier hues appear.<BR>
