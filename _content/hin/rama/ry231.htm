<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXIII.: S&Uacute;RPANAKH&Aacute;'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Burning with anger, in the ring<BR>
Of counsellors who girt their king,<BR>
To R&aacute;van, ravener of man,<BR>
With bitter words she thus began:<BR>

<P>
'Wilt thou absorbed in pleasure, still<BR>
Pursue unchecked thy selfish will:<BR>
Nor turn thy heedless eyes to see<BR>
The coming fate which threatens thee?<BR>
The king who days and hours employs<BR>
In base pursuit of vulgar joys<BR>
Must in his people's sight be vile<BR>
As fire that smokes on funeral pile.<BR>
He who when duty calls him spares<BR>
No time for thought of royal cares,<BR>
Must with his realm and people all<BR>
Involved in fatal ruin fall.<BR>
As elephants in terror shrink<BR>
From the false river's miry brink,<BR>
Thus subjects from a monarch flee<BR>
Whose face their eyes may seldom see,<BR>
Who spends the hours for toil ordained<BR>
In evil courses unrestrained.<BR>
He who neglects to guard and hold<BR>
His kingdom by himself controlled,<BR>
Sinks nameless like a hill whose head<BR>
Is buried in the ocean's bed.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Thy foes are calm and strong and wise,<BR>
Fiends, Gods, and warriors of the skies,--<BR>
How, heedless, wicked, weak, and vain,<BR>
Wilt thou thy kingly state maintain?<BR>
Thou, lord of giants, void of sense,<BR>
Slave of each changing influence,<BR>
Heedless of all that makes a king.<BR>
Destruction on thy head wilt bring.<BR>
O conquering chief, the prince, who boasts,<BR>
Of treasury and rule and hosts,<BR>
By others led, though lord of all,<BR>
Is meaner than the lowest thrall.<BR>
For this are monarchs said to be<BR>
Long-sighted, having power to see<BR>
Things far away by faithful eyes<BR>
Of messengers and loyal spies.<BR>
But aid from such thou wilt not seek:<BR>
Thy counsellors are blind and weak,<BR>
Or thou from these hadst surely known<BR>
Thy legions and thy realm o'erthrown.<BR>
Know, twice seven thousand, fierce in might,<BR>
Are slain by R&aacute;ma in the fight,<BR>
And they, the giant host who led,<BR>
Khara and D&uacute;shan, both are dead.<BR>
Know, R&aacute;ma with his conquering arm<BR>
Has freed the saints from dread of harm,<BR>
Has smitten Janasth&aacute;n and made<BR>
Asylum safe in Dandak's shade.<BR>
Enslaved and dull of blinded sight,<BR>
Intoxicate with vain delight,<BR>
Thou closest still thy heedless eyes<BR>
To dangers in thy realm that rise.<BR>
A king besotted, mean, unkind,<BR>
Of niggard hand and slavish mind.<BR>
Will find no faithful followers heed<BR>
Their master in his hour of need.<BR>
The friend on whom he most relies,<BR>
In danger, from a monarch flies,<BR>
Imperious in his high estate,<BR>
Conceited, proud, and passionate;<BR>
Who ne'er to state affairs attends<BR>
With wholesome fear when woe impends<BR>
Most weak and worthless as the grass,<BR>
Soon from his sway the realm will pass.<BR>
For rotting wood a use is found,<BR>
For clods and dust that strew the ground,<BR>
But when a king has lost his sway,<BR>
Useless he falls, and sinks for aye.<BR>
As raiment by another worn,<BR>
As faded garland crushed and torn,<BR>
So is, unthroned, the proudest king,<BR>
Though mighty once, a useless thing.<BR>
But he who every sense subdues<BR>
And each event observant views,<BR>
Rewards the good and keeps from wrong,<BR>
Shall reign secure and flourish long.<BR>
Though lulled in sleep his senses lie<BR>
He watches with a ruler's eye,<BR>
Untouched by favour, ire, and hate,<BR>
And him the people celebrate.<BR>
O weak of mind, without a trace<BR>

<P>

<P>
Of virtues that a king should grace,<BR>
Who hast not learnt from watchful spy<BR>
That low in death the giants lie.<BR>
Scorner of others, but enchained<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    By every base desire,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By thee each duty is disdained<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Which time and place require.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Soon wilt thou, if thou canst not learn,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Ere yet it be too late,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The good from evil to discern,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Fall from thy high estate.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As thus she ceased not to upbraid<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The king with cutting speech,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And every fault to view displayed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Naming and marking each,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The monarch of the sons of night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of wealth and power possessed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And proud of his imperial might,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Long pondered in his breast.   <BR>
