### CANTO L.: THE HALT UNDER THE INGUDÍ. <span id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_321)

So through the wide and fair extent  
Of Kosala the hero went.  
Then toward Ayodmá back he gazed,  
And cried, with supple hands upraised:  

'Farewell, dear city, in this place,  
Protected by Kakutatlm's race  <span id="fr_322"></span>[2](#fn_322)  
And Gods, who in thy temples dwell,  
And keep thine ancient citadel!  
I from his debt my sire will free,  
Thy well-loved towers again will see,  

And, coming from my wild retreat,  
My mother and my father meet.'  

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>  

Then burning grief inflamed his eye,  
As his right arm he raised on high,  
And, while hot tears his check bedewed,  
Addressed the mournful multitude:  
'By love and tender pity moved,  
Your love for me you well have proved;  
Now turn again with joy, and win  
Success in all your hands begin'  

Before the high souled chief they bent,  
With circling steps around him went,  
And then with bitter wailing, they  
Departed each his several way.  
Like the great sun engulfed by night,  
The hero sped beyond their sight,  
While still the people mourned his fate  
And wept aloud disconsolate.  

The car-borne chieftain passed the bound  
Of Kos'ala's delightful ground.  
Where grain and riches bless the land,  
And people give with liberal hand:  
A lovely realm unvexed by fear,  
Where countless shrines and stakes  <span
id="fr_323"></span>[1](#fn_323) appear:  
Where mango-groves and gardens grow,  
And streams of pleasant water flow:  
Where dwells content a well-fed race,  
And countless kine the meadows grace:  
Filled with the voice of praise and prayer:  
Each hamlet worth a monarch's care.  
Before him three-pathed Gangá rolled  
Her heavenly waters bright and cold;  
O'er her pure breast no weeds were spread,  
Her banks were hermit-visited.  
The car-borne hero saw the tide  
That ran with eddies multiplied,  
And thus the charioteer addressed:  
'Here on the bank to-day we rest.  
Not distant from the river, see!  
There grows a lofty Ingudí  
With blossoms thick on every spray:  
There rest we, charioteer, to-day.  
I on the queen of floods will gaze,  
Whose holy stream has highest praise,  
Where deer, and bird, and glittering snake,  
God, Daitya, bard their pastime take."  

Sumantra, Lakshman gave assent,  
And with the steeds they thither went.  
When Ráma reached the lovely tree,  
With Sítá and with Lakshman, he  
Alighted from the car: with speed  
Sumantra loosed each weary steed,  
And hand to hand in reverence laid,  
Stood near to Ráma in the shade.  
Ráma's dear friend, renowned by fame,  
Who of Nisháda lineage came,  
Guha, the mighty chief, adored  
Through all the land as sovereign lord,  
Soon as he heard that prince renowned  

Was resting on Nisháda ground,  
Begirt by counsellor and peer  
And many an honoured friend drew near.  
Soon as the monarch came in view,  
Ráma and Lakshman toward him flew.  
Then Guha, at the sight distressed,  
His arms around the hero pressed,  
Laid both his hands upon his head  
Bowed to those lotus feet, and said:  
'O Ráma, make thy wishes known,  
And be this kingdom as thine own.  
Who, mighty-armed, will ever see  
A guest so dear as thou to me?'  

He placed before him dainty fare  
Of every flavour, rich and rare,  
Brought forth the gift for honoured guest,  
And thus again the chief addressed  
'Welcome, dear Prince, whose arms are strong;  
These lands and all to thee belong.  
Thy servants we, our lord art thou;  
Begin, good king, thine empire now.  
See, various food before thee placed,  
And cups to drink and sweets to taste  
For thee soft beds are hither borne,  
And for thy horses grass and corn.'  

To Guha as he pressed and prayed,  
Thus Raghu's son his answer made:  
''Twas aye thy care my heart to please  
With honour, love, and courtesies,  
And friendship brings thee now to greet  
Thy guest thus humbly on thy feet.'  

Again the hero spake, as round  
The king his shapely arms he wound:  
'Guha, I see that all is well  
With thee and those who with thee dwell;  
That health and bliss and wealth attend  
Thy realm, thyself, and every friend.  
But all these friendly gifts of thine,  
Bound to refuse, I must decline.  
Grass, bark, and hide my only wear,  
And woodland roots and fruit my fare,  
On duty all my heart is set;  
I seek the woods, an anchoret.  
A little grass and corn to feed  
The horses--this is all I need.  
So by this favour, King, alone  
Shall honour due to me be shown.  
For these good steeds who brought me here  
Are to my sire supremely dear;  
And kind attention paid to these  
Will honour me and highly please,'  
Then Guha quickly bade his train  
Give water to the steeds, and grain,  
And Ráma, ere the night grew dark,  
Paid evening rites in dress of bark,  
And tasted water, on the strand,  
Drawn from the stream by Lakshman's hand.  
And Lakshman with observance meet  
Bathed his beloved brother's feet,  

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>  

Who rested with his Maithil spouse:  
Then sat him down 'neath distant boughs.  
And Guha with his bow sat near  
To Lakshman and the charioteer,  
And with the prince conversing kept  
His faithful watch while Rama slept.  
As Das'aratha's glorious heir,  
Of lofty soul and wisdom rare,  
Reclining with his Sítá there  
   Beside the river lay--  
He who no troubles e'er had seen,  
Whose life a life of bliss had been--  
That night beneath the branches green  
   Passed pleasantly away.
