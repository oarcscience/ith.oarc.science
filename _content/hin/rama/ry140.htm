<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXII.: DAS'ARATHA CONSOLED.</H3>
<P>
The queen's stern speech the monarch heard,<BR>
As rage and grief her bosom stirred,<BR>
And by his anguish sore oppressed<BR>
Reflected in his secret breast.<BR>
Fainting and sad, with woe distraught.<BR>
He wandered in a maze of thought;<BR>
At length the queller of the foe<BR>
Grew conscious, rallying from his woe.<BR>
When consciousness returned anew<BR>
Long burning sighs the monarch drew.<BR>
Again immersed in thought he eyed<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; standing by his side.<BR>
Back to his pondering soul was brought<BR>
The direful deed his hand had wrought,<BR>
When, guiltless of the wrong intent,<BR>
His arrow at a sound was sent.<BR>
Distracted by his memory's sting,<BR>
And mourning for his son, the king<BR>
To two consuming griefs a prey,<BR>
A miserable victim lay.<BR>
The double woe devoured him fast,<BR>
As on the ground his eyes he cast,<BR>
Joined suppliant hands, her heart to touch.<BR>
And spake in the answer, trembling much:<BR>
'Kaus'aly&aacute;, for thy grace I sue,<BR>
Joining these hands as suppliants do.<BR>
Thou e'en to foes hast ever been<BR>
A gentle, good, and loving queen.<BR>
Her lord, with noble virtues graced,<BR>
Her lord, by lack of all debased,<BR>
Is still a God in woman's eyes,<BR>
If duty's law she hold and prize.<BR>
Thou, who the right hast aye pursued,<BR>
Life's changes and its chances viewed,<BR>
Shouldst never launch, though sorrow-stirred,<BR>
At me distressed, one bitter word.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She listened, as with sorrow faint<BR>
He murmured forth his sad complaint:<BR>
Her brimming eyes with tears ran o'er,<BR>
As spouts the new fallen water pour;<BR>

His suppliant hands, with fear dismayed<BR>
She gently clasped in hers, and laid,<BR>
Like a fair lotus, on her head,<BR>
And faltering in her trouble said:<BR>
'Forgive me; at thy feet I lie,<BR>
With low bent head to thee I cry.<BR>
By thee besought, thy guilty dame<BR>
Pardon from thee can scarcely claim.<BR>
She merits not the name of wife<BR>
Who cherishes perpetual strife<BR>
With her own husband good and wise,<BR>
Her lord both here and in the skies.<BR>
I know the claims of duty well,<BR>
I know thy lips the truth must tell.<BR>
All the wild words I rashly spoke,<BR>
Forth from my heart, through anguish, broke;<BR>
For sorrow bends the stoutest soul,<BR>
And cancels Scripture's high control.<BR>
Yea, sorrow's might all else o'erthrows<BR>
The strongest and the worst of foes.<BR>
'Tis thus with all: we keenly feel,<BR>
Yet bear the blows our foemen deal,<BR>
But when a slender woe assails<BR>
The manifest spirit bends and quails.<BR>
The fifth long night has now begun<BR>
Since the wild woods have lodged my son:<BR>
To me whose joy is drowned in tears,<BR>
Each day a dreary year appears.<BR>
While all my thoughts on him are set<BR>
Grief at my heart swells wilder yet:<BR>
With doubled might thus Ocean raves<BR>
When rushing floods increase his waves.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As from Kaus'aly&aacute; reasoning well<BR>
The gentle words of wisdom fell,<BR>
The sun went down with dying flame,<BR>
And darkness o'er the landscape came.<BR>
His lady's soothing words in part<BR>
Relieved the monarch's aching heart,<BR>
Who, wearied out by all his woes,<BR>
Yielded to sleep and took repose.<BR>
