### CANTO XXXIV.: SÛRPANAKHÁ'S SPEECH.

Then forth the giant's fury broke  
As Súrpanakhá harshly spoke.  
Girt by his lords the demon king  
Looked on her, fiercely questioning:  

'Who is this Ráma, whence, and where?  
His form, his might, his deeds declare.  
His wandering steps what purpose led  
To Dandak forest, hard to tread?  
What arms are his that he could smite  
In fray the rovers of the night  
And Tris'iras and Dúshan lay  
Low on the earth, and Khara slay?  
Tell all, my sister, and declare  
Who maimed thee thus, of form most fair.'  

Thus by the giant king addressed,  
While burnt her fury unrepressed,  
The giantess declared at length  
The hero's form and deeds and strength:  

'Long are his arms and large his eyes:  
A black deer's skin his dress supplies.  
King Das'aratha's son is he,  
Fair as Kandarpa's self to see.  
Adorned with many a golden band,  
A bow, like Indra's, arms his hand,  
And shoots a flood of arrows fierce  
As venomed snakes to burn and pierce.  
I looked, I looked, but never saw  
His mighty hand the bowstring draw  
That sent the deadly arrows out,  
While rang through air his battle-shout.  
I looked, I looked, and saw too well  
How with that hail the giants fell,  
As falls to earth the golden grain,  
Struck by the blows of Indra's rain.  
He fought, and twice seven thousand, all  
Terrific giants, strong and tall,  
Fell by the pointed shafts o'erthrown  
Which Ráma shot on foot, alone.  
Three little hours had scarcely fled,--  
Khara and Dúshan both were dead,  
And he had freed the saints and made  
Asylum sure in Dandak's shade.  
Me of his grace the victor spared,  
Or I the giants' fate had shared.  
The high-souled Ráma would not deign  
His hand with woman's blood to stain.  
The glorious Lakshman, justly dear,  
In gifts and warrior might his peer,  
Serves his great brother with the whole  
Devotion of his faithful soul:  
Impetuous victor, bold and wise,  
First in each hardy enterprise,  
Still ready by his side to stand,  
A second self or better hand.  
And Ráma has a large-eyed spouse,  
Pure as the moon her cheek and brows,  
Dearer than life in Ráma's sight,  
Whose happiness is her delight.  
With beauteous hair and nose the dame  
From head to foot has naught to blame.  
She shines the wood's bright Goddess, Queen  
Of beauty with her noble mien.  
First in the ranks of women placed  
Is Sítá of the dainty waist.  
In all the earth mine eyes have ne'er  
Seen female form so sweetly fair.  
Goddess nor nymph can vie with her,  
Nor bride of heavenly chorister.  
He who might call this dame his own,  
Her eager arms about him thrown,  
Would live more blest in Sítá's love  
Than Indra in the world above.  
She, peerless in her form and face  
And rich in every gentle grace,  
Is worthy bride, O King, for thee,  
As thou art meet her lord to be.  
I even I, will bring the bride  
In triumph to her lover's side--  
This beauty fairer than the rest,  
With rounded limb and heaving breast.  
Each wound upon my face I owe  
To cruel Lakshman's savage blow.  
But thou, O brother, shalt survey  
Her moonlike loveliness to-day,  
And Ráma's piercing shafts shall smite  
Thine amorous bosom at the sight.  
If in thy breast the longing rise  
To make thine own the beauteous prize.  
Up, let thy better foot begin  
The journey and the treasure win.  
If, giant Lord, thy favouring eyes  
Regard the plan which I advise.  
Up, cast all fear and doubt away  
And execute the words I say  
Come, giant King, this treasure seek,  
For thou art strong and they are weak.  

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>  

Let Sítá of the faultless frame  
Be borne away and be thy dame.  
Thy host in Janasthán who dwelt  
   Forth to the battle hied.  
And by the shafts which Ráma dealt  
   They perished in their pride.  
Dúshan and Khara breathe no more,  
   Laid low upon the plain.  
Arise, and ere the day be o'er  
   Take vengeance for the slain.'
