RAVAN DOOMED.

SECTION XIII.

<P>
Afterwards Rishya-shringa said again to the King "I will perform another sacrificial act to secure thee a son." Then the son of Vibhanduka, of subdued passions, seeking the happiness of the king, proceeded to perform the sacrifice for the accomplishment of his wishes. Hither were previously collected the gods, with the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the sages, for the sake of receiving their
respective shares, Brahma too, the sovereign of the gods, with Sthanoo, and Narayana, chief of beings and the four supporters of the universe, and the divine,mothers of all the celestials, met together there. To the Ushwa-medha, the great sacrifice of the magnanimous monarch, came also Indra the glorious one, surrounded by the Muroots. Rishya-shringi then supplicated the gods assembled for their share of the sacrifice (saying), "This devout king Dusha-rutha, who, through
the desire of offspring, confiding in you, has performed sacred austerities, and who has offered to you the sacrifice called Ushwa-medha, is about to perform, another sacrifice for the sake of obtaining sons. To him thus desirous of offspring be pleased to grant the blessing: I supplicate you all with joined hands. May
he have four sons, renowned through the universe." The gods replied to the sage's son supplicating with joined hands, "Be it so: thou, O brahman, art ever to be regarded by us, as the king is in a peculiar manner. The lord of men by this sacrifice shall obtain the great   object of his desires. Having thus said, the
gods preceded by Indra, disappeared.

<P>
They all then having seen that (sacrifice) performed by the great sage
according to the ordinance went to Prajapati the lord of mankind, and with joined hands addressed Br&aacute;hma the giver of blessings, "O Brh&aacute;ma, the Rakshas Ravana by name, to whom a blessing was awarded by thee, through pride troubleth all of us the gods, and even the great sages, who perpetually practise sacred austerities. We, O glorious one, regarding the promise formerly granted by thy kindness that he should be invulnerable to the gods, the Danuvas and the Yukshas
have born (sic) all, (his oppression); this lord of Rakshases therefore distresses the universe; and, inflated by this promise unjustly vexes the divine sages, the Yukshas, and Gandhavras, the Usooras, and men: where Ravana remains there the sun loses his force, the winds through fear of him do not blow, the fire ceases to burn; the rolling ocean, seeing him, ceases to move its waves. Vishruvna,
distressed by his power, has abandoned Lanka and fled. O divine one save us from Ravana, who fills the world with noise and tumult. O giver of desired things, be pleased to contrive a way for his destruction."

<P>
Bruhma thus informed by the devas, reflecting, replied, Oh! I have devised the method for slaying this outrageous tyrant. Upon his requesting, "May I be invulnerable to the divine sages, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas

<P>
and the serpents," I replied "Be it so."This Raksh<I>u</I>s, through contempt,
said nothing respecting man; therefore this wicked one shall be destroyed by
man. The gods, preceded by Sh<I>u</I>kr<I>a</I>, hearing these words spoken by Br<I>u</I>hm<I>&aacute;</I>,
were filled with joy.

<P>
At this time V<I>i</I>shn<I>oo</I> the glorious, the lord of the world, arrayed in yellow,
with hand ornaments of glowing gold, riding on Vin<I>u</I>tey<I>a</I>, as the sun on a cloud,
arrived with his conch, his discus, and his club in his hand. Being adored by
the excellent celestials, and welcomed by Br<I>u</I>hm<I>a</I>, he drew near and stood before
him. All the gods then addressed V<I>i</I>shn<I>oo</I>, "O M<I>u</I>dh<I>oo</I>-s<I>oo</I>d<I>u</I>na, thou art able
to abolish the distress of the distressed. We intreat thee, be our sanctuary, 0
<I>U</I>chy<I>oo</I>ta." Vishn<I>oo</I> replied, "Say, what shall I do?" The celestials hearing these
his words added further. "The virtuous, the encourager of excellence, eminent
for truth, the firm observer of his vows, being childless, is performing an <I>U</I>shwamedh<I>a</I>
for the purpose of obtaining offspring. For the sake of the good of the
universe, we intreat thee, O V<I>i</I>shn<I>oo</I>, to become his son. Dividing thyself into
four parts, in the wombs of his three consorts equal to H<I>u</I>r<I>i</I>, Shree, and
Keertee, assume the sonship of king D<I>u</I>sha-r<I>u</I>th<I>a</I>, the lord of <I>U</I>yodhya, eminent
in the knowledge of duty, generous and illustrious, as the great sages. Thus
becoming man, O Vishn<I>oo</I>, conquer in battle Rav<I>u</I>n<I>a</I>, the terror of the universe, who
is invulnerable to the gods. This ignorant Raksh<I>u</I>s Rav<I>u</I>n<I>a</I>, by the exertion of
his power, afflicts the gods, the G<I>u</I>ndhurv<I>a</I>s, the S<I>i</I>ddh<I>a</I>s, and the most excellent
sages; these sages, the G<I>u</I>ndh<I>u</I>rv<I>a</I>s, and the <I>U</I>ps<I>a</I>r<I>a</I>s, sporting in the forest
N<I>u</I>nd<I>u</I>n<I>a</I> have been destroyed by that furious one. We, with the sages, are
come to thee seeking his destruction. The S<I>i</I>ddh<I>a</I>s, the G<I>u</I>ndh<I>u</I>rv<I>a</I>s, and the
Y<I>a</I>ksh<I>a</I>s betake themselves to thee, thou art our only refuge; O Dev<I>a</I>, afflicter of
enemies, regard the world of men, and destroy the enemy of the gods."

<P>
Vishn<I>oo</I>, the sovereign of the gods, the chief of the celestials, adored by all
beings, being thus supplicated, replied to all the assembled gods (standing) before
Br<I>u</I>hm<I>a</I>, "Abandon fear; peace be with you; for your benefit having killed
Rav<I>u</I>n<I>a</I> the cruel, destructively active, the cause of fear to the divine sages,
together with all his posterity, his courtiers and counsellors, and his relations,
and friends, protecting the earth, I will remain incarnate among men for the
space of eleven thousand years."

<P>
Having given this promise to the gods, the divine Vishn<I>oo</I>, ardent in the
work, sought a birth-place among men. Dividing himself into four parts, he
whose eyes resemble the lotos and the p<I>u</I>las<I>a</I>, the lotos petal-eyed, chose for his
father D<I>u</I>sha-r<I>a</I>th<I>a</I> the sovereign of men. The divine sages then with the
G<I>u</I>ndh<I>u</I>rv<I>a</I>s, the R<I>oo</I>dr<I>a</I>s, and the (different sorts of) <I>U</I>psar<I>a</I>s, in the most excellent
strains, praised the destroyer of M<I>u</I>dh<I>oo</I>, (saying) "Root up Rav<I>u</I>n<I>a</I>,
of fervid energy, the devastator, the enemy of <I>I</I>ndra swollen with pride.
Destroy him, who causes universal lamentation, the annoyer of the holy ascetics,
terrible, the terror of the devout T<I>u</I>p<I>u</I>swees. Having destroyed Rav<I>u</I>n<I>a</I>, tremendously powerful, who causes universal weeping, together with his army and
friends, dismissing all sorrow, return to heaven, the place free from stain and
sin, and protected by the sovereign of the celestial powers."

CAPUT XIV.

<P>
RATIO NECANDI RAVANAE EXCOGITATA.

<P>
Prudens ille, voluminum sacrorum gnarus, responsum quod dederat aliquamdiu meditatus, mente ad se revocata regem deuno est effatus: Parabo tibi
aliud sacrum, genitale, prolis masculae adipiscendae gratia, cum carminibus in
ATHARVANIS exordio expressis rite peragendum. Tum coepit modestus Vibh&acirc;ndaci filius, regis commodis intentus, parare sacrum, quo eius desiderium expleret.
Lam'antea* eo convenerant, ut suam quisque portionem acciperent, Di cum fidicinum
coelestium choris, Beatique cum Sapientibus; Brachman Super&ucirc;m regnator,
Sth&acirc;nus nee non augustus N&acirc;r&acirc;yanus, Indrasque alraus, coram visendus Ventorum
cohorte circumdatus, in magno isto sacrificio equino regis magnanimi.
Ibidem vates ille deos, qui portiones suas accipiendi gratia advenerant, apprecatus,
En!* inquit, hicce--ex Dasarathus filiorum desiderio castimoniis adstrictus, fidei
plenus, vestrum numen adoravit sacrificio equino. Nunc iterum accingit se ad
aliud sacrum peragendum: quamobrem aequum est, ut filios cupienti vos faveatis.
Ille ego, qui manus supplices tendo, vos universos pro eo apprecor: nascantur ei
filii quatuor, faina per triplicem mundum clari. Divi supplicem vatis filium invicem
affari: Fiat quod petis! Tu nobis, virsancte, imprimis es venerandus, nec
minus rex ille; compos fiet voti sui egregii hominum princeps. Ita locuti D&icirc;
Indra duce, ex oculis evanuerunt.

<P>
Superi vero, legitime in concilio congregati. BRACHMANEM mundi creatorem
his verbis compellarunt: Tuo munere auctus, O Brachman! gigas nomine R&acirc;vanas,
prae superbia nos omnes vexat, pariterque Sapientes castimoniis gaudentes.
A te propitio olim ex voto ei hoc munus concessum fuit, ut ne a diis, Danuidis,
Geniisve necari posset. Nos, oraculum tuum reveriti, facinora eius qualiacunque
toleramus. At ille gigantum tyrannus ternos mundos gravibus iniuriis vexat
Deos, Sapientes, Genios, Fidicines coelestes, Titanes, mortales denique, exsuperat
ille aegre cohibendus, tuoque munere demens. Non ibi calet sol, neque Ventus
prae timore spirat, nec flagrat ignis, ubi R&acirc;vanas versatur. Ipse oceanus, vagis
fluctibus redimitus, isto viso stat immotus; eiectus fuit e sede sua Cuv&ecirc;rus, huius
robore vexatus. Ergo ingens nobis periculum imminet ab hoc gigante visu horribili;
tuum est, alme Parens! auxilium parare, quo hic deleatur. Ita admonitus
ille a diis universis, paulisper meditatus, Ehem!* inquit, hancce inveni rationem
nefarium istum necandi. Petierat is a me, ut a Gandharvis, a Geniis, a Divis,
Danuibus Gigantibusque necari non posset et me annuente voto suo potitus est.
Prae contemptu vero monstrum illud homines non commemoravit: ideo ab homine
est necandus: nullum aliud exstat leti genus, quod ei sit &pound;atale. Postquam
audiverant gratum hunc sermonem BRACHMANIS ore prolatum, Di cum duce suo Indra summopere gaudio erecti sunt. Eodem temporis momento Vishnus,
istuc accessit, splendore insignis, concham, discum et clavum manibus gestans,
croceo vestitu, mundi dominus, vulturis Vinateii dorso, sicuti sol nimbo, vectus,
armillas ex auro candente gerens, salutatus a Super&ucirc;m primoribus. Quem laudibus
celebratum reverenter D&icirc; universi compellarunt. Tu animantium afflictorum
es vindex, Madh&ucirc;s interfector! quamobrem nos afflicti te apprecamur. Sis praesidio
nobis numine tuo inconcusso. Dicite, inquit Vishnus, quid pro vobis facere

me oporteat. Audito eius sermone, Di hunc in modum respondent: Rex quidam,
nomine Dasarathus, austeris castimoniis sese castigavit, litavit sacrificio equino,
prolis cupidus et prole carens. Nostro hortatu tu, Vishnus, conditionem natorum
eius subeas: ex tribus eius uxoribus, Pudicitiae, Venustatis et Famae similibus,
nasci velis, temetipsum quadrifariam dividens. Ibi tu in humanam naturam
conversus R&acirc;vanam, gravissimam mundi pestem, diis insuperabilem, O Vishnus!
proelio caede. Gigas ille vecors R&acirc;vanas Deos cum Fidicinum choris, Beatos et
Sapientes praestantisslmos vexat, audacia superbiens. Etenim ab hoc furioso
Sapientes Fidicines et nymphae, ludentes in Nandano viridario, sunt proculcati.
Tu es nostrum omnium summa salus, divine bellator! Ut deorum hostes extinguas,
ad sortem humanam animum converte. Augustus ille N&acirc;r&acirc;yanus, diis hunc
in modum coram hortantibus, eosdem apto hoc sermone compellavit: Quare,
quaeso, hac in renegotium vestrum a me potissimum, corporea specie palam facto,
est peragendum *? *aut unde tantus vobis terror fuit iniectus? His verbis a Vishn&ucirc;
interrogati D&icirc; talia proferre: Terror nobis instat, O Vishnus! a R&acirc;vana mundi
direptore; a quo nos vindicare, corpore humano assumpto, tuum est. Nemo alius
coelicoiarum praeter te hunc scelestum enecare potis est. Nimirum ille, O hostium
domitor! per diuturnum tempus sese excruciaverat severissima abstinentia,
qua magnus hicce rerum Parens propitius ipsi redditus est, Itaque almus votorum
sponsor olim ei concessit securitatem ab ommibus animantibus. hominibus tamen
exceptis. Hinc ilium, voti compotem, non aliunde quam ab homine necis per&iacute;culum
urget: tu ergo, humanitate assumpta eum intertice. Sic monitus Vishnus,
Super&ucirc;m princeps, quem mundus univerans adorat, magnum Parentem oeterosque
deos, in concilio congregatos, recti auctores, affatur: Mittite timorem; bene
bob&iacute;s eveniat! Vestrae salutis gratia, postquam praelio necavero R&acirc;vanam cum
filiis nepotibusque, cum amicis, ministris, cognatis socusque, crudelem istum aegre
cohibendum, qui divinis Sapientibus terrorem *incutit, per decem millia annorum
decies centenis additis, commorabor in mortalium sedibus, orbem terrarum imperio
regens. Tum divini sapientes et Fidicines conjuncti cum Rudris nympha,
rumque choris celebravere Madh&ucirc;s interfectorem hymnis, quales sedem aetheriam
decent.

<P>
"R&acirc;vanam ilium insolentem, acri impetu actum, superbia elatum, Super&ucirc;m

Ma Riscyasringo soggiunse poscia al re: T'apprester&ograve; io un altro rito santissimo,
genitale, onde tu conseguisca la prole che tu bram&iacute;. E in quel punto
stesso il saggio figliulo di Vibh&acirc;ndaco, iutento alia prosperit&agrave; del re, pose mano
al sacro rito per condurre ad effetto il suo desiderio. Gi&agrave; erano prima, per ricevere
ciascuno la sua parte, qu&iacute; convenuti al gran sacrifizio del re magnanimo
l'Asvamedha, &iacute; Devi coi Gandharvi, i Siddhi e i Muni, Brahma Signor dei Sari,
Sth&acirc;nu e l' Augusto N&acirc;r&acirc;yana, i quattio custudi dell' universo e le Madri degli
Iddn, i Yacsi insieme cogli Dei, e il sovrano, venerando Indra, visibile, circondato

dalla schiera dei Maruti. Quivi cos&igrave; parl&ograve; Riscyasr'ingo agli Dei venuti a partecipare
del sacrifizio: Questo &egrave; il re Dasaratha, che per desiderio di progenie gi&agrave;
s' astrinse ad osservanze auster&eacute;, e test&egrave; pieno di fede ha a voi, O eccelsi, sacrificato
con un Asvamedha. Ora egli, sollecito d' aver figli, si dispone ad adempiere
un nuovo rito; vogliate essere favorevole a lui che sospira progenie. lo alzo a
voi supplici le mani, e voi tutti per lui implor'o: nascano a lui quattro figli
degni d'essere celebrati per tre mondi. Risposero gli Dei al supplichevole tigliuolo
del Risci: Sia fatto ci&ograve; che chiedi; a te ed al re parimente si debbe da noi, O
Brahmano, sommo pregio; canseguir&agrave; il re per questo sacro rito il suo suppremo
desiderio. Ci&ograve; detto disparvero i Numi preceduti da Indra.

<P>
Poich&egrave; videro gli Dei compiersi debitamente dal gran Risci l'oblazione,
venuti al cospetto di Brahma facitor del mondo, signor delle creature, cos&igrave; parlarono
reverenti a lui dator di grazie: O Brahma, un Racs&aacute;so per nome R&acirc;vano,
cui tu fosti largo del tuo favore, &egrave; per superbia infesto a noi tutti e ai grandi Saggi
penitenti. Un di, O Nume, augusto, tu propizio a lui gli accordasti il favore, ch'
egli bramava, di non poter essere ucciso dagli Dei, dai D&acirc;navi n&egrave; dai Yacsi: noi
venerando i tuoi oracoli, ogni cosa sopportiamo da costui. Quindi il signor dei
Racsasi infesta con perpetue offese i tre mondi, i Devi, i Risci, i Yacsi ed i Gandharvi,
gli Asuri e gli uomini: tutti egli opprime indegnamente inorgoglito pel
tuo dono. Col&agrave; dove si trova R&acirc;vano, pi&ugrave; non isfavilla per timore il sole, pi&ugrave;
non spira il vento, pi&ugrave; non fiammeggia il fuoco: l' oceano stesso cui fan corona
i vasti flutti, veggendo costui, tutto si turba e si commuove. Stretto dalla forza
di costui e ridotto allo stremo dovette Vaisravano abbandonare Lanc&acirc;. Da questo
R&acirc;vano, terror del mondo, tu ne proteggi, O almo Nume: degna, O dator
d'ogni bene, trovar modo ad estirpar costui. Fatto di queste cose conscio dai
Devi, stette alquanto meditando, poi rispose Brahma: Ors&ugrave;! &egrave; stabilito il modo
onde distruggere questo iniquo. Egli a me chiese, ed io glie&igrave; concessi, di non poter
essere ucciso dai Devi, dai Risci, dai Gandharvi, dai Yacsi, dai Racsasi n&egrave; dai
Serpenti; ma per disprezzo non fece menzione degli uomini quel Racso: or bene,
sar&agrave; quell' empio ucciso da un uomo. Udite le fauste parole profferte da Brahma,
furono per ogni parte liete gli Iddii col loro duce Indra. In questo mezzo qui
sopravvenne raggiante d'immensa luce il venerando Visnu, pensato da Brahma
nell' immortal sua mente, siccome atto ad estirpar colui; Allora Brahma colla
schiera de' Celesti cos&igrave; parl&ograve; a Visnu: Tu sei il conforto delle gente oppresse, O
distruttor di Madhu: noi quindi a te supplichiamo afflitti: sia tu nostro sostegno,
O Aciuto. Dite, loro rispose Visnu, quale cosa io debba far per voi; e gli
Dei, udite queste parole, cosi soggiunsero: Un re per nome Dasaratha, giusto,
virtuoso, veridico e pio, non ha progenie e la desidera: ei gi&agrave; s' impose durissime
penitenze, ed ora ha sacrificato con un Asvamedha: tu, per nostro consiglio, O
Visnu, consenti a divenir suo figlio: fatte di te quattro parti, ti manifesta, O
invocato dalle genti, nel seno delle quattro sue consorti, simili alla venusta
Dea. Cos&igrave; esortato dagli Dei quivi presenti, l'augusto N&acirc;r&acirc;yana loro rispose
queste opportune parole: Quale opra s'ha da me, fatto visible nel mondo, a
compiere per voi, O Devi? e d'onde in voi cotal terrore? Intese le parole di
Visnu, cos&igrave; risposero gli Dei: ll nostro terrore, O Visnu, nasce da un Racsaso per
nome R&acirc;vano, spavento dell' universo. Vestendo umano corpo, tu debhi esterminar
costui. Nessuno fra i Celesti, fuorch&egrave; tu solo, &egrave; valevole ad uccidere
quell' iniquo. Egli, O domator de' tuoi nemici, sostenne per lungo tempo acerbissime

<P>
<A NAME="page_514"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 514</FONT></A>

<P>
macerazioni: per esse fu di lui contento l'augusto sommo Genitore:  a
un di gli accord&ograve; propizio la sicurezza da tutti gli esseri, eccettutine gli nomini.
Per questo favore a lui concesso non ha egli a temere offesa da alcuna parte,
fuorch&egrave; dall' uomo, perci&ograve;, assumendo la natura umana, costui tu uccidi. Egli,
il peggior di tutti i Racsasi, insano per la forza che gli infonde il dono avuto, da
travaglio ai Devi ed ai Gaudharvi, ai Risci, ai Muni ed ai mortali. Egli, sicuro
da morte pel favore ottenuto, &egrave; turbatore dei sacrifizj, nemico ed uccisor dei
Brahmi, divoratore degli uomini, peste del mondo. Da lui furono assaliti re coi
loro carri ed elefanti; altri percossi e fugati si dispersero per ogni dove. Da lui
furono divorati Risci ed Apsarase: egli insomma oltracotato continuamente e
quasi per ischerzo tutti travaglia i sette mondi. Perci&ograve;, O terribile ai nemici &egrave;
stabilita la morte di costui per opra d'un uomo; poich' un di per superbia del
dono tutti sprezz&ograve; gli uomini. Tu, O supremo fra i Numi, dei, umanandoti,
estirpare questo tremendo, superbo Ravano, oltracotato, a noi nemico, terrore e
flagello dei penitenti.

De nouveau Rishya&ccedil;ringa tint ce langage au Monarque: "Je vais c&eacute;l&eacute;brer
un autre sacrifice, afin que le ciel accorde &agrave; tes voeux les enfants que tu souhaites."
Cela dit, cherchant le bonheur du roi et pour l'accomplissement de son d&eacute;sir, le
fils puissant de Vibh&aacute;ndaka se mit &agrave; c&eacute;l&eacute;brer ce nouveau sacrifice.

<P>
L&agrave; auparavant, &eacute;taient venus d&eacute;j&agrave; recevoir une part de l'offrande les
Dieux, accompagn&eacute;s des Gaudharvas, et les Siddhas avec les Mounis divins,
Brahma, le monarque des Souras, l'immuable S'iva, et l'auguste N&aacute;r&aacute;yana, et les
quatre gardiens vigilants du monde, et les m&egrave;res des Immortels, et tous les Dieux,
escort&eacute;s des Yakshas, et le ma&icirc;tre &eacute;minent du ciel, Indra, qui se manifestait aux
yeux, environn&eacute; par l'essaim des Maroutes. Alors ce jeune anachor&egrave;te avait
suppli&eacute; tous les Dieux, que le desir d'une part dans l'offrande avait conduits &agrave; l'
a&ccedil;wam&eacute;dha, cette grande c&eacute;r&eacute;monie de ce roi magnanime; <I>et, dans ce moment, l'
&eacute;poux de S'&aacute;nt&aacute; les conjurait ainsi pour la seconde fois</I>: "Cet homme <I>en pri&egrave;res</I>,
c'est le roi Da&ccedil;aratha, qui est priv&eacute; de fils. Il est rempli d' une foi vive; il s'est
inflig&eacute; de p&eacute;nibles aust&eacute;rit&eacute;s; il vous a d&eacute;j&agrave; servi, divinit&eacute;s augustes, le sacrifice
d'un a&ccedil;wa-m&eacute;dha, et maintenant il s'&eacute;tudie encore &agrave; vous plaire avec ce nouveau
sacrifice dans l'esp&eacute;rance que vous lui donnerez les fils, o&ugrave; tendent ses d&eacute;sirs.
Versez donc sur lui votre bienveillance et daignez sourire &agrave; son voeu pour des fils.
C'est pour lui que moi ici, les mains jointes, je vous adresse &agrave; tous mes supplications:
envoyez-lui quatre fils, qui soient vant&eacute;s dans les trois mondes!"

<P>
"Oui! r&eacute;pondirent les Dieux au fils suppliant du rishi; tu m&eacute;rites que nous
t'&eacute;coutions avec faveur, toi, brahme saint, et m&ecirc;me, en premier lieu, ce roi.
Comme r&eacute;compense de ces diff&eacute;rents sacrifices, le monarque obtendra cet objet
le plus cher de ses d&eacute;sirs."

<P>
Ayant aussi parl&eacute; et vu que le grand saint avait mis fin suivant les rites &agrave;
son <I>pieux</I> sacrifice, les Dieux, Indra &agrave; leur t&ecirc;te, s'&eacute;vanouissent dans le vide des
airs et se rendent vers l'architecte des mondes, le souverain des cr&eacute;atures, le
donateur des biens, vers Brahma enfin, auquel tous, les mains jointes, ils adressent
les paroles suivantes: "O Brahma, un rakshasa, nomm&eacute; R&aring;vana, tourne au

opprime avec nous les grands anchor&egrave;tes, qui se font un bonheur des mac&eacute;rations:
car jadis, ayant su te plaire, O Bhagavat, il a re&ccedil;u de toi ce don incomparable.
"Oui, as-tu dit, exau&ccedil;ant le voeu du mauvais G&eacute;nie; Dieu. Yaksha ou D&eacute;mon
ne pourra jamais causer ta mort!" Et nous, par qui ta parole est respect&eacute;e, nous
avons tout support&eacute; de ce roi des rakshasas, qui &eacute;crase de sa tyrannie les trois
mondes, ou il prom&egrave;ne l'injure impun&eacute;ment. Enorgueilli de ce don victorieux,
il opprime indignement les Dieux, les rishis, les Yakshas, les Gandharvas, les
Asouras et les enfants de Manon. L&agrave; ou se tient R&acirc;vana, la peur emp&eacute;che le
soleil d'&eacute;chauffer, le vent craint de souffler, et le feu n'ose flamboyer. A son
aspect, la guirlande m&ecirc;me des grands flots tremble au sein de la mer. Aceabl&eacute;
par sa vigueur indomptable, Kouv&eacute;ra d&eacute;fait lui a c&eacute;d&eacute; Lank&aacute;. Suave-nous donc,
&ocirc; toi, qui reposes dans le bonheur absolu; sauve-nous de R&acirc;vana, le fl&eacute;au des
mondes. Daigne, &ocirc; toi, qui souris aux voeux du suppliant, daigne imaginer un
expedient pour &ocirc;ter la vie &agrave; ce cruel D&eacute;mon." Les Dieux ayant ainsi d&eacute;nonc&eacute;
leurs maux &agrave; Brahma, il r&eacute;fl&eacute;chit un instant et leur tint ce langage: "Bien, voici
que j'ai d&eacute;couvert un moyen pour tuer ce G&eacute;nie sc&eacute;l&eacute;rat. Que ni les Dieux,
a-t-il dit, ni les rishis, ni les Gandharvas ni les Yakshas, ni les rakshasas, ni les
N&aacute;gas m&ecirc;me ne puissent me donner la mort! Soit lui ai-je r&eacute;pondu. Mais, par
d&eacute;dain pour la force humaine, les hommes n'ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; compris dans sa demande.
C'est donc par la main d' un homme, qu'il faut immoler ce m&eacute;chant." Ainsi
tomb&eacute;e de la bouche du cr&eacute;ateur, cette parole salutaire satisfit pleinement le roi
des habitants du ciel et tous les Dieux avec lui. L&aacute;, dans ce m&ecirc;me instant, survint
le fortun&eacute; Visnou, rev&ecirc;tu d' une splendeur infinie; car c'&eacute;tait a lui, que
Brahma avait pens&eacute; dans son &acirc;me pour la mort du tyran. Celui-ci donc avec
l'essaim des Immortels adresse &agrave; Vishnou ces paroles: "Meurtrier de Madhou,
comrae tu aimes &aacute; tirer de l' affliction les &ecirc;tres malheureux, nous te supplions,
nous qui sommes plong&eacute;s dans la tristesse, Divinit&eacute; auguste, sois notre asyle!"
"Dites! reprit Vishnou; que dois-je faire? "Ayant oui les paroles de l' ineffable,
tous les Dieux repondirent: "Il est un roi nomm&eacute; Da&ccedil;aratha; il a embrass&eacute; une
tr&egrave;s-dur&eacute; p&eacute;nitence; il a c&eacute;l&eacute;br&eacute; m&ecirc;me le sacrifice d'un a&ccedil;wa-medha, parce qu'il
n'a point de fils et qu'il veut en obtenir du ciel. Il est in&eacute;branlable dans sa pi&eacute;te,
il est vant&eacute; pour ses vertus; la justice est son caract&egrave;re, la verite est sa parole.
Acquiesce donc &agrave; notre demande, &ocirc; toi, Vishnou, et consens &agrave; na&icirc;tre comme son
fils. Divis&eacute; en quatre portions de toi-m&ecirc;me, daigne, &ocirc; toi qui foules aux pieds
tes ennemis, daigne t' incarner dans le sein de ses trois &eacute;pouses, belles comme la
d&eacute;esse de la beaut&eacute;." N&aacute;r&aacute;yana, le ma&icirc;tre, <I>non, perceptible aux sens, mais qui
alors s' &eacute;tait rendu</I> visible, N&aacute;r&aacute;yana r&eacute;pondit cette parole salutaire aux Dieux,
qui i invitaient &agrave; cet <I>heroique av&aacute;tara</I>. Quelle chose, une fois rev&ecirc;tu de cette
incarnation, faudra-t-il encore que je fasse pour vous, et de quelle part vient la
terreur, qui vous trouble ainsi?' A ces mots du grand Vishnou: "C'est le
d&eacute;mon R&aacute;vana, reprirent les Dieux; c'est lui, Vishnou, cette d&eacute;solation des
mondes, qui nous inspire un tel effroi. Enveloppe-toi d' un corps, humain, et
qu'il te plaise arr&acirc;cher du monde cette blessante epine; car nul autre que toi
parmi les habitants du ciel n'est capable d'immoler ce p&eacute;cheur. <I>Sache que</I>

The R&aacute;m&aacute;yan ends, epically complete, with the triumphant return of
R&aacute;ma and his rescued queen to Ayodhy&aacute; and his consecration and coronation in
the capital of his forefathers. Even if the story were not complete, the conclusion
of the last Canto of the sixth Book, evidently the work of a later hand than V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki's, which speaks of R&aacute;ma's glorious and happy reign and promises blessings
to those who read and hear the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan, would be sufficient to show that, when
these verses were added, the poem was considered to be finished. The Uttarak&aacute;nda
or Last Book is merely an appendix or a supplement and relates only events antecedent
and subsequent to those described in the original poem. Indian scholars
however, led by reverential love of tradition, unanimously ascribe this Last Book
to V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki, and regard it as part of the R&aacute;am&aacute;yan.

Signor Gorresio has published an excellent translation of the Uttarak&aacute;nda,
in Italian prose, from the recension current in Bengal;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1053"></A><A HREF="#fn_1053"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and Mr. Muir has epitomized
a portion of the book in the Appendix to the Fourth Part of his Sanskrit
Texts (1862). From these scholars I borrow freely in the following pages, and
give them my hearty thanks for saving me much wearisome labour.

"After R&aacute;ma had returned to Ayodhy&aacute; and taken possession of the throne,
the rishis [saints} assembled to greet him, and &Aacute;gastya, in answer to his questions
recounted many particulars regarding his old enemies. In the Krita Yuga (or
Golden Age) the austere and pious Brahman rishi Pulastya, a son of Brahm&aacute;,
being teased with the visits of different damsels, proclaimed that any one of them
whom he again saw near his hermitage should become pregnant. This had not
been heard by the daughter of the royal rishi Trinavindu, who one day came into
Pulastya's neighbourhood, and her pregnancy was the result (Sect. 2, vv. 14 ff.).
After her return home, her father, seeing her condition, took her to Pulastya, who
accepted her as his wife, and she bore a son who received the name of Vis'ravas.
This son was, like his father, an austere and religious sage. He married the
daughter of the muni Bharadv&aacute;ja, who bore him a son to whom Brahm&aacute; gave the
name of Vais'ravan--Kuvera (Sect. 3, vv. I ff). He performed austerities for
thousands of years, when he obtained from Brahm&aacute; as a boon that he should be
one of the guardians of the world (along with Indra, Varuna, and Y&aacute;ma) and
the god of riches. He afterwards consulted his father Vis'ravas about an abode,
and at his suggestion took possession of the city of Lank&aacute;, which had formerly
been built by Vis'vakarman for the R&aacute;xasas, but had been abandoned by them
through fear of Vishnu, and was at that time unoccupied. R&aacute;ma then (Sect. 4)
says he is surprised to hear that Lank&aacute; had formerly belonged to the R&aacute;xasas, as
he had always understood that they were the descendants of Pulastya, and now
he learns that they had also another origin. He therefore asks who was their
ancestor, and what fault they had committed that they were chased away by
Vishnu. &Agrave;gastya replies that when Brahm&aacute; created the waters, he formed certain beings,--some of whom received the name of R&aacute;xasas,--to guard them. The
first R&aacute;xasa kings were Heti and Praheti. Heti married a sister of K&aacute;la (Time).
She bore him a son Vidyutkes'a, who in his turn took for his wife Lankatankat&aacute;,
the daughter of Sandhy&aacute; (V. 21). She bore him a son Sukes'a, whom she abandoned,
but he was seen by S'iva as he was passing by with his wife P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, who
made the child as old as his mother, and immortal, and gave him a celestial city.
Sukes'a married a Gandharv&iacute; called Devavat&iacute; who bore three sons, M&aacute;lyavat,
Sum&aacute;li and M&aacute;li. These sons practised intense austerities, when Brahm&aacute; appeared
and conferred on them invincibility and long life. They then harassed the gods.
Vis'vakarman gave them a city, Lank&aacute;, on the mountain Trik&uacute;ta, on the shore of

<P>
<A NAME="page_518"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 518</FONT></A>

<P>
the southern ocean, which he had built at the command of Indra....The three
R&aacute;xasas, M&aacute;lyavat and his two brothers, then began to oppress the gods, rishis,
etc.; who (Sect. 6, v.1 ff.) in consequence resort for aid to Mah&aacute;deva, who having regard to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Sukes'a the father of M&aacute;lyavat, says that he cannot kill
the R&aacute;xasas. but advises the suppliants [*supplicants?*} to go to Vishnu, which they do, and
receive from him a promise that he will destroy their enemies. The three R&aacute;xasa
kings, hearing of this, consult together, and proceed to heaven to attack the gods.
Vishnu prepares to meet them. The battle is described in the seventh section.
The R&aacute;xasas are defeated by Vishnu with great slaughter, and driven back to
Lank&aacute;, one of their leaders, M&aacute;li, being slain. M&aacute;lyavat remonstrates with.
Vishnu, who was assaulting the rear of the fugitives, for his unwarrior-like conduct, and wishes to renew the combat (Sect. 8, v. 3 ff.). Vishnu replies that he
must fulfil his promise to the gods by slaying the R&aacute;xasas, and that he would
destroy them even if they fled to P&aacute;t&aacute;la. These R&aacute;xasas, Agastya says, were
more powerful than R&aacute;vana, and, could only be destroyed by N&aacute;r&aacute;yana, <I>i.e.</I> by
R&aacute;ma himself, the eternal, indestructible god. Sum&aacute;li with his family lived for
along time in P&aacute;t&aacute;la, while Kuvera dwelt in Lank&aacute;. In section 9 it is related
that Sum&aacute;li once happened to visit the earth, when he observed Kuvera going in
his chariot to see his father Vis'ravas. This leads him to consider how he might
restore his own fortunes. He consequently desires his daughter Kaikas&iacute; to go and
woo Vis'ravas, who receives her graciously. She becomes the mother of the dreadful R&aacute;vana, of the huge Kumbhakarna, of S&uacute;rpanakh&aacute;, and of the righteous
Vibh&iacute;shana, who was the last son. These children grow up in the forest. Kumbhakarna goes about eating rishis. Kuvera comes to visit his father, when Kaikas&iacute;
takes occasion to urge her son R&aacute;vana to strive to become like his brother (Kuvera)
in splendour. This R&aacute;vana promises to do. He then goes to the hermitage of
Gokarna with his brothers to perform austerity. In section 10 their austere observances are described: after a thousand years' penance R&aacute;vana throws his head
into the fire. He repeats this oblation nine times after equal intervals, and is
about to do it the tenth time, when Brahm&aacute; appears, and offers a boon. R&aacute;vana
asks immortality, but is refused. He then asks that he may be indestructible by
all creatures more powerful than men; which boon is accorded by Brahm&aacute;
together with the recovery of all the heads he had sacrificed and the power of
assuming any shape he pleased. Vibh&iacute;shana asks as his boon that "even amid
the greatest calamities he may think only of righteousness, and that the weapon
of Brahm&aacute; may appear to him unlearnt, etc. The god grants his request, and
adds the gift of immortality. When Brahm&aacute; is about to offer a boon to Kumbhakarna, the gods interpose, as, they say, he had eaten seven Apsarases and ten
followers of Indra, besides rishis and men; and beg that under the guise of a
boon stupefaction may be inflicted on him. Brahm&aacute; thinks on Sarasvat&iacute;, who
arrives and, by Brahm&aacute;'s command, enters into Kumbhakarna's mouth that she
may speak for him. Under this influence he asks that he may receive the boon
of sleeping for many years, which is granted. When however Sarasvat&iacute; has left
him, and he recovers his own consciousness, he perceives that he has been deluded.
Kuvera by his father's advice, gives up the city of Lank&aacute; to R&aacute;vana."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1054"></A><A HREF="#fn_1054"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> R&aacute;vana

name has several times occurred in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan as that of an artist of wonderful
skill. She bears a son Meghan&aacute;da or the Roaring Cloud who was afterwards
named Indrajit from his victory over the sovereign of the skies. The conquest
of Kuvera, and the acquisition of the magic self-moving chariot which has done
much service in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan, form the subject of sections XIII., XIV. and XV.
"The rather pretty story of Vedavat&iacute; is related in the seventeenth section, as follows: R&aacute;vana in the course of his progress through the world, comes to the
forest on the Him&aacute;laya, where he sees a damsel of brilliant beauty, but in ascetic
garb, of whom he straightway becomes enamoured. He tells her that such an
austere life is unsuited to her youth and attractions, and asks who she is and why
she is leading an ascetic existence. She answers that she is called Vedavat&iacute;, and
is the vocal daughter of Vrihaspati's son, the rishi Kus'adhv&aacute;ja, sprung from him
during his constant study of the Veda. The gods, gandharvas, etc., she says,
wished that she should choose a husband, but her father would give her to no one
else than to Vishnu, the lord of the world, whom he desired for his son-in-law.
Vedavati then proceeds: "In order that I may fulfil this desire of my father in
respect of N&aacute;r&aacute;yana, I wed him with my heart. Having entered into this engagement I practise great austerity. N&aacute;r&aacute;yana and no other than he, Purushottama,
is my husband. From the desire of obtaining him, I resort to this severe observance.
R&aacute;vana's passion is not in the least diminished by this explanation and
he urges that it is the old alone who should seek to become distinguished by
accumulating merit through austerity, prays that she who is so young and beautiful
shall become his bride; and boasts that he is superior to Vishnu. She rejoins
that no one but be would thus contemn that deity. On receiving this reply he
touches the hair of her head with the tip of his finger. She is greatly incensed,
and forthwith cuts off her hair and tells him that as he has so insulted her, she
cannot continue to live, but will enter into the fire before his eyes. She goes on
"Since I have been insulted in the forest by thee who art wicked-hearted, I shall
be born again for thy destruction. For a man of evil desire cannot be slain by a
woman; and the merit of my austerity would be lost if I were to launch a curse
against thee. But if I have performed or bestowed or sacrificed aught may I be
born the virtuous daughter, not produced from the womb, of a righteous man."
Having thus spoken she entered, the blazing fire. Then a shower of celestial
flowers fell (from every part of the sky). It is she, lord, who, having been Vedavat&iacute;
in the Krita age, has been born (in the Treta age) as the daughter of the
king of the Janakas, and (has become) thy [R&aacute;ma's] bride; for thou art the
eternal Vishnu. The mountain-like enemy who was [virtually] destroyed before
by her wrath, has now been slain by her having recourse to thy superhuman
energy." On this the commentator remarks: "By this it is signified that S&iacute;t&aacute;
was the principal cause of R&aacute;vana's death; but the function of destroying him
is ascribed to R&aacute;ma." On the words,"thou art Vishnu," in the preceding verse
the same commentator remarks: "By this it is clearly affirmed that S&iacute;t&aacute; was
Laxm&iacute;. This is what Par&aacute;s'ara says: "In the god's life as R&aacute;ma, she became
S&iacute;t&aacute;, and in his birth as Krishna [she became] Rukmin&iacute;."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1055"></A><A HREF="#fn_1055"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>

In the following section (XVIII.) "R&aacute;vana is described as violently interrupting
a sacrifice which is being performed by king Marutta, and the assembled

gods in terror assume different shapes to escape; Indra becomes a peacock, Yama a crow, Kuvera a lizard, and Varuna a swan; and each deity bestows a boon on the animal he had chosen. The peacock's tail recalls Indra's thousand eyes; the swan's colour becomes white, like the foam of the ocean (Varuna being its lord); the lizard obtains a golden colour; and the crow is never to die except when
killed by a violent death, and the dead are to enjoy the funeral oblations when they have been devoured by the crows." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1056"></A><A HREF="#fn_1056"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>

R&aacute;van then attacks Arjuna or K&aacute;rttav&iacute;rya the mighty king of M&aacute;hishmati
on the banks of the Narmad&aacute;, and is defeated, captured and imprisoned by
Arjuna. At the intercession of Pulastya (Sect. XXII.) he is released from his
bonds. He then visits Kishkindh&aacute; where he enters into alliance with B&aacute;li the
King of the V&aacute;nars: "We will have all things in common," says R&aacute;van, "dames,
sons, cities and kingdoms, food, vesture, and all delights." His next exploit is
the invasion of the kingdom of departed spirits and his terrific battle with the
sovereign Yama. The poet in his description of these regions with the detested
river with waves of blood, the dire lamentations, the cries for a drop of water,
the devouring worm, all the tortures of the guilty and the somewhat insipid pleasures
of the just, reminds one of the scenes in the under world so vividly described
by Homer, Virgil, and Dante. Yama is defeated (Sect. XXVI.) by the giant, not
so much by his superior power as because at the request of Brahm&aacute; Yama refrains
from smiting with his deadly weapon the R&aacute;kshas enemy to whom that God had
once given the promise that preserved him. In the twenty-seventh section R&aacute;van
goes "under the earth into P&aacute;t&aacute;la the treasure-house of the waters inhabited by
swarms of serpents and Daityas, and well defended by Varun." He subdues
Bhogavati the city ruled by V&aacute;suki and reduces the N&aacute;gas or serpents to subjection.
He penetrates even to the imperial seat of Varun. The God himself is
absent, but his sons come forth and do battle with the invader. The giant is
victorious and departs triumphant. The twenty-eighth section gives the details
of a terrific battle between R&aacute;van and M&aacute;ndh&aacute;t&aacute; King of Ayodhya, a distinguished
ancestor of R&aacute;ma. Supernatural weapons are employed on both sides and the
issue of the conflict is long doubtful. But at last M&aacute;ndh&aacute;t&aacute; prepares to use the
mighty weapon "acquired by severe austerities through the grace and favour of
Rudra." The giant would inevitably have been slain. But two pre-eminent
Munis Pulastya and G&aacute;lava beheld the fight through the power given by contemplation,
and with words of exhortation they parted King M&aacute;ndh&aacute;t&aacute; and the
sovereign of the R&aacute;kshases. R&aacute;van at last (Sect. XXXII.) returns homeward
carrying with him in his car Pushpak the virgin daughters of kings, of Rishis,
of Daityas, and Gandharvas whom he has seized upon his way. The thirty-sixth
section describes a battle with Indra. in which the victorious Meghan&aacute;da son of
the giant, makes the King of the Gods his prisoner, binds him with his magic art,
and carries him away (Sect. XXVII.) in triumph to Lank&aacute;. Brahm&aacute; intercedes
(Sect. XXXVIII.) and Indrajit releases his prisoner *** obtaining in return the
boon that sacrifice to the Lord of Fire shall always make him invincible in the
coming battle. In sections XXXIX, XL, "we have a legend related to R&aacute;ma
by the sage Agastya to account for the stupendous strength of the monkey Hanumat,
as it had been described in the <I>R&aacute;m&aacute;yana</I>. Rama naturally wonders (as

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_521"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 521</FONT></A>

<P>
perhaps many readers of the <I>R&aacute;m&aacute;yana</I> have done since) why a monkey of such
marvellous power and prowess had not easily overcome B&aacute;li and secured the throne
for his friend Sugr&iacute;va. Agastya replies that Hanumat was at that time under
a curse from a Rishi, and consequently was not conscious of his own might." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1057"></A><A HREF="#fn_1057"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>
The whole story of the marvellous V&aacute;nar is here given at length, but nothing else
of importance is added to the tale already given in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana. The Rishis
or saints then (Sect. XL.) return to their celestial seats, and the V&aacute;nars, R&aacute;kshases
and bears also (Sect. XLIII.) take their departure. The chariot Pushpak is restored to its original owner Kuvera, as has already been related in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan.

<P>
The story of R&aacute;ma and Sit&aacute; is then continued, and we meet with matter
of more human interest. The winter is past and the pleasant spring-time is come,
and R&aacute;ma and Sit&aacute; sit together in the shade of the As'oka trees happy as Indra
and S'ach&iacute; when they drink in Paradise the nectar of the Gods. "Tell me, my
beloved," says R&aacute;ma, "for thou wilt soon be a mother, hast thou a wish in thy
heart for me to gratify?" And Sit&aacute; smiles and answers: "I long, O son of Raghu,
to visit the pure and holy hermitages on the banks of the Ganges and to venerate
the feet of the saints who there perform their rigid austerities and live on roots
and berries. This is my chief desire, to stand within the hermits' grove were it
but for a single day," And R&aacute;ma said: "Let not the thought trouble thee: thou
shalt go to the grove of the ascetics," But slanderous tongues have been busy in
Ayodhy&aacute;, and Sit&aacute; has not been spared. R&aacute;ma hears that the people are lamenting his blind folly in taking back to his bosom the wife who was so long a captive
in the palace of R&aacute;van. R&aacute;ma well knows her spotless purity in thought, word,
and deed, and her perfect love of him; but he cannot endure the mockery and
the shame and resolves to abandon his unsuspecting wife. He orders the sad but
still obedient Lakshman to convey her to the hermitage which she wishes to visit
and to leave her there, for he will see her face again no more. They arrive at the
hermitage, and Lakshman tells her all. She falls fainting on the ground, and
when she recovers her consciousness sheds some natural tears and bewails her
cruel and undeserved lot. But she resolves to live for the sake of R&aacute;ma and her
unborn son, and she sends by Lakshman a dignified message to the husband who
has forsaken her: "I grieve not for myself," she says " because I have been
abandoned on account of what the people say, and not for any evil that I have
done, The husband is the God of the wife, the husband is her lord and guide;
and what seems good unto him she should do even at the cost of her life."

<P>
Sit&aacute; is honourably received by the saint V&aacute;lmiki himself, and the holy
women of the hermitage are charged to entertain and serve her. In this calm
retreat she gives birth to two boys who receive the names of Kus'a and Lava.
They are carefully brought up and are taught by V&aacute;lmiki himself to recite the
R&aacute;m&aacute;yan. The years pass by: and R&aacute;ma at length determines to celebrate the
As'vamedha or Sacrifice of the Steed. V&aacute;lmiki, with his two young pupils,
attends the ceremony, and the unknown princes recite before the delighted father
the poem which recounts his deeds. R&aacute;ma inquires into their history and recognizes them as his sons. Sit&aacute; is invited to return and solemnly affirm her innocence before the great assembly.

<P>
"But Sit&aacute;'s heart was too full; this second ordeal was beyond even her.
power to submit to, and the poet rose above the ordinary Hindu level of women

<P>

<A NAME="page_522"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 522</FONT></A>

<P>
when be ventured to paint her conscious purity as rebelling: "Beholding all the
spectators, and clothed in red garments, S&iacute;t&aacute; clasping her hands and bending low
her face, spoke thus in a voice choked with tears: 'as I, even in mind, have never
thought of any other than R&aacute;ma, so may M&aacute;dhav&iacute; the goddess of Earth, grant
me a hiding-place.' As S&iacute;t&aacute; made this oath, lo! a marvel appeared. Suddenly
cleaving the earth, a divine throne of marvellous beauty rose up, borne by resplendent
dragons on their heads: and seated on it, the goddess of Earth, raising

"Both the great Hindu epics thus end in disappointment and sorrow. In
the <I>Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata</I> the five victorious brothers abandon the hardly won throne to
die one by one in a forlorn pilgrimage to the Him&aacute;laya; and in the same way
R&aacute;ma only regains his wife, after all his toils, to lose her. It is the same in the
later Homeric cycle-the heroes of the <I>Iliad</I> perish by ill-fated deaths. And even
Ulysses, after his return to Ithaca, sets sail again to Thesprotia, and finally falls
by the hand of his own son. But in India and Greece alike this is an afterthought
of a self-conscious time, which has been subsequently added to cast a
gloom on the strong cheerfulness of the heroic age." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1059"></A><A HREF="#fn_1059"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>

"The termination of R&aacute;ma's terrestrial career is thus told in Sections 116
ff. of the Uttarak&aacute;nda. Time, in the form of an ascetic, comes to his palace gate,
and asks, as the messenger of the great rishi (Brahm&aacute;) to see R&aacute;ma. He is admitted
and received with honour, but says, when he is asked what he has to
communicate, that his message must be delivered in private, and that any one
who witnesses the interview is to lose his life. R&aacute;ma informs Laxmana of all
this, and desires him to stand outside. Time then tells R&aacute;ma that he has been
sent by Brahm&aacute;, to say that when he (R&aacute;ma, i.e. Vishnu) after destroying the
worlds was sleeping on the ocean, he had formed him (Brahm&aacute;) from the lotus
springing from his navel, and committed to him the work of creation; that he
(Brahm&aacute;) had then entreated R&aacute;ma to assume the function of Preserver, and
that the latter had in consequence become Vishnu, being born as the son of Aditi,
and had determined to deliver mankind by destroying R&aacute;vana, and to live on
earth ten thousand and ten hundred years; that period, adds Time, was now on
the eve of expiration, and R&aacute;ma could either at his pleasure prolong his stay on
earth, or ascend to heaven and rule over the gods, R&aacute;ma replies, that he had
been born for the good of the three worlds, and would now return to the place
whence he had come, as it was his function to fulfil the purposes of the gods.
While they are speaking the irritable rishi Durv&aacute;sas comes, and insists on seeing
R&aacute;ma immediately, under a threat, if refused, of cursing R&aacute;ma and all his
family.

<P>
Laxmana, preferring to save his kinsman, though knowing that his own
death must he the consequence of interrupting the interview of R&aacute;ma with Time,
enters the palace and reports the rishi's message to R&aacute;ma. R&aacute;ma comes out, and

<P>
when Durv&aacute;sas has got the food he wished, and departed, R&aacute;ma reflects with
great distress on the words of Time, which require that Laxmana should die.
Laxmana however exhorts R&aacute;ma not to grieve, but to abandon him and not break
his own promise. The counsellors concurring in this advice, R&aacute;ma abandons
Laxmana, who goes to the river Saray&uacute;, suppresses all his senses, and is conveyed
bodily by Indra to heaven. The gods are delighted by the arrival of the fourth
part of Vishnu. R&aacute;ma then resolves to install Bharata as his successor and retire
to the forest and follow Laxmana. Bharata however refuses the succession, and
determines to accompany his brother. R&aacute;ma's subjects are filled with grief, and
say they also will follow him wherever he goes. Messengers are sent to S'atrughna,
the other brother, and he also resolves to accompany R&aacute;ma; who at length sets
out in procession from his capital with all the ceremonial appropriate to the
"great departure," silent, indifferent to external objects, joyless, with S'r&iacute; on his
right, the goddess Earth on his left, Energy in front, attended by all his weapons
in human shapes, by the Vedas in the forms of Brahmans, by the G&aacute;yatri, the
Omk&aacute;ra, the Vashatk&aacute;ra, by rishis, by his women, female slaves, eunuchs, and
servants. Bharata with his family, and S'atrughna, follow together with Brahmans
bearing the sacred fire, and the whole of the people of the country, and
even with animals, etc., etc. R&aacute;ma, with all these attendants, comes to the banks
of the Saray&uacute;. Brahm&aacute;, with all the gods and innumerable celestial cars, now
appears, and all the sky is refulgent with the divine splendour, Pure and fragrant
breezes blow, a shower of flowers falls. R&aacute;ma enters the waters of the
Saray&uacute;; and Brahm&aacute; utters a voice from the sky, saying: "Approach, Vishnu;
R&aacute;ghava, thou hast happily arrived, with thy godlike brothers. Enter thine own
body as Vishnu or the eternal ether. For thou art the abode of the worlds: no
one comprehends thee, the inconceivable and imperishable, except the large-eyed
M&aacute;y&aacute; thy primeval spouse." Hearing these words, R&aacute;ma enters the glory of
Vishnu with his body and his followers. He then asks Brahm&aacute; to find an abode
for the people who had accompanied him from devotion to his person, and Brahm&aacute;
appoints them a celestial residence accordingly." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1060"></A><A HREF="#fn_1060"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>

'A curious festival is celebrated in honour of this divinity (Lakshm&iacute;) on the
fifth lunar day of the light half of the month M&acirc;gha (February), when she is
identified with Saraswat&iacute; the consort of Brahm&aacute;, and the goddess of learning. In
his treatise on festivals, a great modern authority, Raghunandana, mentions, on
the faith of a work called <I>Samvatsara-sandipa</I>, that Lakshm&iacute; is to be worshipped
in the forenoon of that day with flowers, perfumes, rice, and water; that due
honour is to be paid to inkstand and writing-reed, and no writing to be done.
Wilson, in his essay on the <I>Religious Festivals of the Hindus</I> (works, vol. ii, p.
188. ff.). adds that on the morning of the 2nd February, the whole of the pens and
inkstands, and the books, if not too numerous and bulky, are collected, the pens
or reeds cleaned, the inkstands scoured, and the books wrapped up in new cloth,
are arranged upon a platform, or a sheet, and strewn over with flowers and blades
of young barley, and that no flowers except white are to be offered. After performing
the necessary rites,.........all the members of the family assemble and
make their prostrations; the books, the pens, and ink having an entire holiday;

<A NAME="page_525"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 525</FONT></A>

<P>
I. The Matsya, or fish. In this avat&aacute;r Vishnu descended in the form of a
fish to save the pious king Satyavrata, who with the seven Rishis and their wives
had taken refuge in the ark to escape the deluge which then destroyed the
earth. 2, The K&uacute;rma, or Tortoise. In this he descended in the form of a tortoise,
for the purpose of restoring to man some of the comforts lost during the flood.
To this end he stationed himself at the bottom of the ocean, and allowed the
point of the great mountain Mandara to be placed upon his back, which served
as a hard axis, whereon the gods and demons, with the serpent V&aacute;suki twisted
round the mountain for a rope, churned the waters for the recovery of the amrita
or nectar, and fourteen other sacred things. 3. The Var&aacute;ha, or Boar. In this he
descended in the form of a boar to rescue the earth from the power of a demon
called 'golden-eyed,' Hirany&aacute;ksha. This demon had seized on the earth and
carried it with him into the depths of the ocean. Vishnu dived into the abyss,
and after a contest of a thousand years slew the monster. 4 The Narasinha, or
Man-lion. In this monstrous shape of a creature half-man, half-lion, Vishnu
delivered the earth from the tyranny of an insolent demon called Hiranyakas'ipu.
5. V&aacute;mana, or Dwarf. This avat&aacute;r happened in the second age of the Hind&uacute;s
or Tret&aacute;yug, the four preceding are said to have occurred in the first or Satyayug;
the object of this avat&aacute;r was to trick Bal&iacute; out of the dominion of the three worlds.
Assuming the form of a wretched dwarf he appeared before the king and asked,
as a boon, as much land as he could pace in three steps. This was granted; and
Vishnu immediately expanding himself till he filled the world, deprived Bal&iacute; at
two steps of heaven and earth, but in consideration of some merit, left P&aacute;t&aacute;la
still in his dominion. 6. Parasur&aacute;ma. 7. R&aacute;mchandra, 8. Krishna, or according
to some Balar&aacute;ma. 9. Buddha. In this avat&aacute;r Vishnu descended in the form
of a sage for the purpose of making some reform in the religion of the Brahmins,
and especially to reclaim them from their proneness to animal sacrifice. Many
of the Hind&uacute;s will not allow this to have been an incarnation of their favourite
god. 10. Kalki, or White Horse. This is yet to come. Vishnu mounted on a
white horse, with a drawn scimitar, blazing like a comet, will, according to
prophecy, end this present age, viz. the fourth or Kaliyug, by destroying the
world, and then renovating creation by an age of purity.'

S'IVA.

<P>
A celebrated Hind&uacute; God, the Destroyer of creation, and therefore the most
formidable of the Hind&uacute; Triad. He also personifies reproduction, since the
Hind&uacute; philosophy excludes the idea of total annihilation without subsequent regeneration.
Hence he is sometimes confounded with Brahm&aacute;, the creator or
first person of the Triad. He is the particular God of the T&aacute;ntrikas, or followers
of the books called Tantras. His worshippers are termed S'aivas, and although
not so numerous as the Vaishnavas, exalt their god to the highest place in the
heavens, and combine in him many of the attributes which properly belong to the
other deities. According to them S'iva is Time, Justice, Fire, Water, the Sun, the
Destroyer and Creator. As presiding over generation, his type is the Linga, or
Phallus, the origin probably of the Phallic emblem of Egypt and Greece. As
the God of generation and justice, which latter character he shares with the god
Yama, he is represented riding a white bull. His own colour, as well as that of
the bull, is generally white, referring probably to the unsullied purity of Justice,

His throat is dark-blue; his hair of alight reddish colour, and thickly matted
together, and gathered above his head like the hair of an ascetic. He is sometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with four, eight, or ten, and with five faces. He has three eyes, one being in the centre of his forehead, pointing up and down. These are said to denote his view of the three divisions of time, past, present, and future. He holds a trident in his hand to denote, as some say, his relationship to water, or according to others, to show that the three great attributes of Creator, Destroyer, and Regenerator are combined in him. His loins are enveloped in a tiger's skin. In his character of Time, he not only presides over its extinction, but also its astronomical regulation. A crescent or half-moon on his forehead indicates the measure of time by the phases of the moon; a serpent forms one of his necklaces to denote the measure of time by years, and a second necklace of human skulls marks the lapse and revolution of ages, and the extinction and succession of the generations of mankind. He is often represented as entirely covered with serpents, which are the emblems of immortality. They are bound in his hair, round his neck, wrists, waist, arms and legs; they serve as rings for his fingers, and earrings for his ears, and are his constant companions, S'iva has more than a thousand names which are detailed at length in the sixty-ninth chapter of the S'iva Pur&aacute;n'a.--WILLIAMS'S DICTIONARY, S'iva.

APSARASES.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Originally these deities seem to have been personifications of the vapours
which are attracted by the sun, and form into mist or clouds: their character
may be thus interpreted in the few hymns of the Rigveda where mention is made
of them. At a subsequent period when the Gandharva of the Rigveda who personifies there especially the Fire of the Sun, expanded into the Fire of Lightning, the rays of the moon and other attributes of the elementary life of heaven as well as into pious acts referring to it, the Apsarasas become divinities which represent phenomena or objects both of a physical and ethical kind closely associated with that life; thus in the <I>Yajurveda</I> Sunbeams are called the Apsarasas associated with the Gandharva who is the Sun; Plants are termed the Apsarasas connected with the Gandharva Fire: Constellations are the Apsarasas of the Gandharva Moon: Waters the Apsarasas of the Gandharva Wind, etc. etc.................... In the last Mythological epoch when the Gandharvas have saved from their elementary nature merely so much as to be musicians in the paradise of Indra, the Apsarasas appear among other subordinate deities which share in the merry life of Indra's heaven, as the wives of the Gandharvas, but more especially as wives of a licentious sort, and they are promised therefore, too, as a reward to heroes fallen in battle when they are received in the paradise of Indra; and while, in the Rigveda, they assist Soma to pour down his floods, they descend in the epic literature on earth merely to shake the virtue of penitent Sages and to deprive them of the power they would otherwise have acquired through unbroken austerities.'--GOLDST&Uuml;CKER'S Sanskrit Dictionary.

<P>
and appeared upon earth in the corporeal form of R&aacute;ma, the hero of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana,
is the seventh in the series of Indian avatars. Much has been said before
now of these avatars, and through deficient knowledge of the ideas and doctrines
of India, they have been compared to the sublime dogma of the Christian Incarnation.
This is one of the grossest errors that ignorance of the ideas and beliefs
of a people has produced. Between the avatars of India and the Christian Incarnation
there is such an immensity of difference that it is impossible to find any
reasonable analogy that can approximate them. The idea of the avatars is intimately
united with that of the Trim&uacute;rti; the bond of connection between these
two ideas is an essential notion common to both, the notion of Vishnu. What
is the Trimurti? I have already said that it is composed of three Gods, Brahma
(masculine), Vishnu the God of <I>avat&aacute;rs</I>, and S'iva. These three Gods, who when
reduced to their primitive and most simple expression are but three cosmogonical
personifications, three powers or forces of nature, these Gods, I say, are here
found, according to Indian doctrines, entirely external to the true God of India,
or Brahma in the neuter gender. Brahma is alone, unchangeable in the midst of
creation: all emanates from him, he comprehends all, but he remains extraneous
to all: he is Being and the negation of beings. Brahma is never worshipped;
the indeterminate Being is never invoked; he is inaccessible to the prayers as
the actions of man; humanity, as well as nature, is extraneous to him. External
to Brahma rises the Trimurti, that is to say, Brahm&aacute; (masculine) the power
which creates, Vishnu the power which preserves, and S'iva the power which destroys:
theogony here commences at the same time with cosmogony. The three
divinities of the Trimurti govern the phenomena of the universe and influence
all nature. The real God of India is by himself without power; real efficacious
power is attributed only to three divinities who exist externally to him. Brahm&aacute;,
Vishnu, and S'iva, possessed of qualities in part contradictory and attributes
that are mutually exclusive, have no other accord or harmony than that which
results from the power of things itself, and which is found external to their own
thoughts. Such is the Indian Trimurti. What an immense difference between
this Triad and the wonderful Trinity of Christianity! Here there is only one
God, who created all, provides for all, governs all. He exists in three Persons
equal to one another, and intimately united in one only infinite and eternal
substance. The Father represents the eternal thought and the power which
created, the Son infinite love, the Holy Spirit universal sanctification. This one
and triune God completes by omnipotent power the great work of creation which,
when it has come forth from His hands, proceeds in obedience to the laws which
He has given it, governed with certain order by His infinite providence.

<P>
The immense difference between the Trimurti of India and the Christian
Trinity is found again between the avatars of Vishnu and the Incarnation of
Christ. The avatar was effected altogether externally to the Being who is in
India regarded as the true God, The manifestation of one essentially cosmogonical
divinity wrought for the most part only material and cosmogonical
prodigies. At one time it takes the form of the gigantic tortoise which sustains
Mount Mandar from sinking in the ocean; at another of the fish which raises the
lost Veda from the bottom of the sea, and saves mankind from the waters. When
these avatars are not cosmogonical they consist in some protection accorded to

<P>
<A NAME="page_528"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 528</FONT></A>

<P>
men or Gods, a protection which is neither universal nor permanent. The very
manner in which the <I>avat&aacute;r</I> is effected corresponds to its material nature, for instance the mysterious vase and the magic liquor by means of which the <I>avat&aacute;r</I> here spoken of takes place. What are the forms which Vishn'u takes in his descents? They are the simple forms of life; he becomes a tortoise, a boar, a fish, but he is not obliged to take the form of intelligence and liberty, that is to say, the form of man, In the avat&aacute;r of Vishn'u is discovered the inpress of pantheistic ideas which have always more or less prevailed in India. Does the avat&aacute;r produce a permanent and definitive result in the world? By no means. It is renewed at every catastrophe either of nature or man, and its effects are only transitory........... To sum up then, the Indian <I>avat&aacute;r</I> is effected externally to the true God of India, to Brahma; it has only a cosmogonical or historical mission which is neither lasting nor decisive; it is accomplished by means of strange prodigies and magic transformations; it may assume promiscuously all the forms of life; it may be repeated indefinitely. Now let the whole of this Indian idea taken from primitive tradition be compared with the Incarnation of Christ and it will be seen that there is between the two an irreconcilable difference. According to the doctrines of Christianity the Everlasting Word, Infinite Love, the Son of God, and equal to Him, assumed a human body, and being born as a man accomplished by his divine act the great miracle of the spiritual redemption of man. His coming had for its sole object to bring erring and lost humanity back to Him; this work being accomplished, and the divine union of men with God being re-established, redemption is complete and remains eternal.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The superficial study of India produced in the last century many erroneous
ideas, many imaginary and false parallels between Christianity and the Brahmanical religion. A profounder knowledge of Indian civilization and religion,
and philological studies enlarged and guided by more certain principles have
dissipated one by one all those errors. The attributes of the Christian God, which by one of those intellectual errors, which Vico attributes to the vanity
of the learned, had been transferred to Vishnu, have by a better inspired philosophy been reclaimed for Christianity, and the result of the two religions, one immovable and powerless, the other diffusing itself with all its inherent force and energy, has shown further that there is a difference, a real opposition, between the two principles.'--GORRESIO.

Rains from its labouring womb a stony shower.<BR>
She heard, she swooned, she fell upon the earth,<BR>
Fell on that bosom whence she sprang to birth.<BR>
As, when the tempest in its fury flies,<BR>
Low in the dust the prostrate creeper lies,<BR>
So, struck with terror sank she on the ground,<BR>
And all her gems, like flowers, lay scattered round.<BR>
But Earth, her mother, closed her stony breast.<BR>
And, filled with doubt, denied her daughter rest.<BR>
She would not think the Chief of Raghu's race<BR>
Would thus his own dear guiltless wife disgrace.<BR>
Stunned and unconscious, long the lady lay,<BR>
And felt no grief, her senses all astray.<BR>
But gentle Lakshman, with a brother's care,<BR>
Brought back her sense, and with her sense, despair.<BR>
But not her wrongs, her shame, her grief, could wring<BR>
One angry word against her lord the King:<BR>
Upon herself alone the blame she laid.<BR>
For tears and sighs that would not yet be stayed.<BR>
To soothe her anguish Lakshman gently strove;<BR>
He showed the path to Saint V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki's grove;<BR>
And craved her pardon for the share of ill<BR>
He wrought, obedient to his brother's will.<BR>
'O, long and happy, dearest brother, live!<BR>
I have to praise', she cried,' and not forgive:<BR>
To do his will should be thy noblest praise;<BR>
As Vishn'u ever Indra's will obeys.<BR>
Return, dear brother: on each royal dame<BR>
Bestow a blessing in poor S&iacute;t&aacute;'s name,<BR>
And bid them, in their love, kind pity take<BR>
Upon her offspring, for the father's sake.<BR>
And speak my message in the monarch's ear,<BR>
The last last words of mine that he shall hear:<BR>
'Say, was it worthy of thy noble race<BR>
Thy guiltless queen thus lightly to disgrace?<BR>
For idle tales to spurn thy faithful bride,<BR>
Whose constant truth the searching fire had tried?<BR>
Or may I hope thy soul refused consent,<BR>
And but thy voice decreed my banishment?<BR>
Hope that no care could turn, no love could stay<BR>
The lightning stroke that falls on me to-day?<BR>
That sins committed in the life that's fled<BR>
Have brought this evil on my guilty head?<BR>
Think not I value now my widowed life,<BR>
Worthless to her who once was R&aacute;ma's wife.<BR>
I only live because I hope to see<BR>
The dear dear babe that will resemble thee.<BR>
And then my task of penance shall be done,<BR>

With eyes uplifted to the scorching sun;<BR>
So shall the life that is to come restore<BR>
Mine own dear husband, to be lost no more.'<BR>
And Lakshman swore her every word to tell,<BR>
Then turned to go, and bade the queen farewell.<BR>
Alone with all her woes, her piteous cries<BR>
Rose like a butchered lamb's that struggling dies.<BR>
The reverend sage who from his dwelling came<BR>
For sacred grass and wood to feed the flame,<BR>
Heard her loud shrieks that rent the echoing wood,<BR>
And, quickly following, by the mourner stood.<BR>
Before the sage the lady bent her low,<BR>
Dried her poor eyes, and strove to calm her woe.<BR>
With blessings on her hopes the blameless man<BR>
In silver tones his soothing speech began:<BR>
'First of all faithful wives, O Queen, art thou;<BR>
And can I fail to mourn thy sorrows now?<BR>
Rest in this holy grove, nor harbour fear<BR>
Where dwell in safety e'en the timid deer.<BR>
Here shall thine offspring safely see the light,<BR>
And be partaker of each holy rite.<BR>
Here, near the hermits' dwellings, shall thou lave<BR>
Thy limbs in *Tonse's* sin-destroying wave,<BR>
And on her isles, by prayer and worship, gain<BR>
Sweet peace of mind, and rest from care and pain.<BR>
Each hermit maiden with her sweet soft voice,<BR>
Shall soothe thy woe, and bid thy heart rejoice:<BR>
With fruit and early flowers thy lap shall fill,<BR>
And offer grain that springs for us at will.<BR>
And here, with labour light, thy task shall be<BR>
To water carefully each tender tree,<BR>
And learn how sweet a nursing mother's joy<BR>
Ere on thy bosom rest thy darling boy.'<BR>

'He cleared the earth thrice seven times of the Kshatriya caste, and filled with their blood the five large lakes of Samanta, from which he offered libations to the race of Bhrigu. Offering a solemn sacrifice to the King of the Gods Paras'ur&aacute;ma presented the earth to the ministering priests. Having given the earth to Kas'vapa, the hero of immeasurable prowess retired to the Mahendra mountain, where he still resides; and in this manner was there enmity between him and the race of the Kshatriyas, and thus was the whole earth conquered by
Paras'ur&aacute;ma.' The destruction of the Kshatriyas by Paras'ur&aacute;ma had been provoked by the cruelty of the Kshatriyas. <I>Chips from a German Workshop</I>, Vol. II. p.334.

The scene in which he appears is probably interpolated for the sake of
making him declare R&aacute;ma to be Vishnu. 'Herr von Schlegel has often remarked to me,' says Lassen,'that without injuring the connexion of the story all the chapters [of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan} might be omitted in which R&aacute;ma is regarded as an incarnation of Vishn'u. In fact, where the incarnation of Vishn'u as the four sons of Das'aratha is described, the great sacrifice is already ended, and all the priests remunerated at the termination, when the new sacrifice begins at which the Gods appear, then withdraw, and then first propose the incarnation to Vishnu,

If it had been an original circumstance of the story, the Gods would certainly

have continued without interruption.' LASSEN, <I>Indische Alterthumskunde, Vol. I.</I>

'The idea of fate was different in India from that which prevailed in
Greece. In Greece fate was a mysterious, inexorable power which governed
men and human events, and from which it was impossible to escape. In India
Fate was rather an inevitable consequence of actions done in births antecedent
to one's present state of existence, and was therefore connected with the doctrine
of metempsychosis. A misfortune was for the most part a punishment, an expiation
of ancient faults not yet entirely cancelled.' GORRESIO.

VIS'V&Aacute;MITRA. PAGE 76.

'Though of royal extraction, Vis'v&aacute;mitra conquered for himself and his
family the privileges of a Brahman. He became a Brahman, and thus broke through all the rules of caste. The Brahmans cannot deny the fact, because it
forms one of the principal subjects of their legendary poems. But they have
spared no pains to represent the exertions of Vis'v&aacute;mitra, in his struggle for
Brahmanhood, as so superhuman that no one would easily be tempted to follow
his example. No mention is made of these monstrous penances in the Veda,
where the struggle between Vis'v&aacute;mitra, the leader of the Kus'ikas or Bharatas,
and the Brahman Vas'ishtha, the leader of the white-robed Tritsus, is represented
as the struggle of two rivals for the place of Purohita or chief priest and minister
at the court of King Sud&aacute;s, the son of Pijavana.' <I>Chips from a German Workshop,

HOUSEHOLD GODS, PAGE 102.

<P>
'No house is supposed to be without its tutelary divinity, but the notion
attached to this character is now very far from precise. The deity who is the
object of hereditary and family worship, the <I>Kuladev&aacute;ta</I>, is always one of the
leading personages of the Hindu mythology, as S'iva, Vishnu or Durg&aacute;, but the
<I>Grihadevat&aacute;</I> rarely bears any distinct appellation. In Bengal, the domestic god
is sometimes the <I>S&aacute;bagr&aacute;m</I> stone, sometimes the <I>tulasi</I> plant, sometimes a
basket with a little rice in it, and sometimes a water-jar--to either of which a
brief adoration is daily addressed, most usually by the females of the family.
Occasionally small images of Lakshmi or Chandi fulfil the office, or should a
snake appear, he is venerated as the guardian of the dwelling. In general,
however, in former times, the household deities were regarded as the unseen
spirits of ill, the ghosts and goblins who hovered about every spot, and claimed
some particular sites as their own. Offerings were made to them in the open air,
by scattering a little rice with a short formula at the close of all ceremonies to
keep them in good humour.

<P>
The household gods correspond better with the genii locorum than with the
lares or penates of autiquity.'

<I>S'aivya, a king whom earth obeyed,<BR>
Once to a hawk a promise made.</I><BR>
</DIR>

<P>
The following is a free version of this very ancient story which occurs more
than once in the <I>Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rat</I>:


<P>
THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.<BR>

<P>
Chased by a hawk there came a dove<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With worn and weary wing,<BR>
And took her stand upon the hand<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of K&aacute;s'&iacute;'s mighty king.<BR>
The monarch smoothed her ruffled plumes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And laid her on his breast,<BR>
And cried, 'No fear shall vex thee here,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rest, pretty egg-born, rest!<BR>
Fair K&aacute;s'i's realm is rich and wide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With golden harvests gay,<BR>
But all that's mine will I resign<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ere I my guest betray.'<BR>
But panting for his half won spoil<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hawk was close behind.<BR>
And with wild cry and eager eye<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Came swooping down the wind:<BR>
'This bird', he cried, 'my destined prize,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Tis not for thee to shield:<BR>
'Tis mine by right and toilsome flight<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  O'er hill and dale and field.<BR>
Hunger and thirst oppress me sore,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And I am faint with toil:<BR>
Thou shouldst not stay a bird of prey<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Who claims his rightful spoil.<BR>
They say thou art a glorious king,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And justice is thy care:<BR>
Then justly reign in thy domain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nor rob the birds of air.'<BR>
Then cried the king: 'A cow or deer<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  For thee shall straightway bleed,<BR>
Or let a ram or tender lamb<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be slain, for thee to feed.<BR>
Mine oath forbids me to betray<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My little twice-born guest:<BR>
See how she clings with trembling wings<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To her protector's breast.'<BR>
'No flesh of lambs,' the hawk replied,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'No blood of deer for me;<BR>
The falcon loves to feed on doves<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And such is Heaven's decree.<BR>
But if affection for the dove<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_536"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 536</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thy pitying heart has stirred,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Let thine own flesh my maw refresh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Weighed down against the bird.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He carved the flesh from off his side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And threw it in the scale,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  While women's cries smote on the skies<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With loud lament and wail.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He hacked the flesh from side and arm,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    From chest and back and thigh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But still above the little dove<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The monarch's scale stood high.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He heaped the scale with piles of flesh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With sinews, blood and skin,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And when alone was left him bone<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He threw himself therein.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then thundered voices through the air;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The sky grew black as night;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And fever took the earth that shook<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To see that wondrous sight.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The blessed Gods, from every sphere,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    By Indra led, came nigh:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  While drum and flute and shell and lute<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Made music in the sky.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They rained immortal chaplets down,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Which hands celestial twine,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And softly shed upon his head<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Pure Amrit, drink divine.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then God and Seraph, Bard and Nymph<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Their heavenly voices raised,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And a glad throng with dance and song<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The glorious monarch praised.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They set him on a golden car<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That blazed with many a gem;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then swiftly through the air they flew,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And bore him home with them.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus K&aacute;s'&iacute;'s lord, by noble deed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Won heaven and deathless fame:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And when the weak protection seek<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    From thee, do thou the same.<BR>

The ceremonies that attended the consecration of a king (<I>Abhisheka lit.
Sprinkling over</I>) are fully described in Goldst&uuml;cker's Dictionary, from which the
following extract is made: 'The type of the inauguration ceremony as practised
at the Epic period may probably be recognized in the history of the inauguration
of <I>R&aacute;ma</I>, as told in the <I>R&aacute;m&aacute;yana</I>, and in that of the inauguration
of <I>Yudhishtira</I>,
as told in the <I>Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;ratha</I>. Neither ceremony is described in these poems

<P>
<A NAME="page_537"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 537</FONT></A>

<P>
with the full detail which is given of the vaidik rite in the <I>Aitareya-Br&aacute;hmanam</I>;
but the allusion that R&aacute;ma was inaugurated by <I>Vasishtha</I> and the other Br&aacute;hmanas
in the same manner as Indra by the Vasus...and the observation which
is made in some passages that a certain rite of the inauguration was performed
'according to the sacred rule'...admit of the conclusion that the ceremony
was supposed to have taken place in conformity with the vaidik injunction....
As the inauguration of <I>R&aacute;ma</I> was intended and the necessary preparations for it
were made when his father Das'aratha was still alive, but as the ceremony itself,
through the intrigues of his step-mother <I>Kaikey&iacute;</I>, did not take place then, but
fourteen years later, after the death of <I>Das'aratha</I>, an account of the preparatory
ceremonies is given in the <I>Ayodhy&aacute;k&aacute;nda</I> (Book II) as well as in the <I>Yuddha-K&aacute;nda</I>
(Book VI.) of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana, but an account of the complete ceremony
in the latter book alone. According to the <I>Ayodhy&aacute;k&aacute;nda</I>, on the day preceding
the intended inauguration <I>R&aacute;ma</I> and his wife <I>S&iacute;t&aacute;</I> held a fast, and in the
night they performed this preliminary rite: <I>R&aacute;ma</I> having made his ablutions,
approached the idol of <I>N&aacute;r&aacute;yana</I>, took a cup of clarified butter, as the
religious law prescribes, made a libation of it into the kindled fire, and drank
the remainder while wishing what was agreeable to his heart. Then, with his
mind fixed on the divinity he lay, silent and composed, together with <I>S&iacute;t&aacute;</I>, on a
bed of Kus'a-grass, which was spread before the altar of Vishnu, until the last
watch of the night, when he awoke and ordered the palace to be prepared for
the solemnity. At day-break reminded of the time by the voices of the bards,
he performed the usual morning devotion and praised the divinity. In the
meantime the town Ayodhy&aacute; had assumed a festive appearance and the inauguration
implements had been arranged...golden water-jars, an ornamented
throne-seat, a chariot covered with a splendid tiger-skin, water taken
from the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna, as well as from other sacred
rivers, tanks, wells, lakes, and from all oceans, honey, curd, clarified butter,
fried grain, Kus'a-grass, flowers, milk; besides, eight beautiful damsels, and a
splendid furious elephant, golden and silver jars, filled with water, covered with
<I>Udumbara</I> branches and various lotus flowers, besides a white jewelled <I>chourie</I>,
a white splendid parasol, a white bull, a white horse, all manner of musical
instruments and bards....In the preceding chapter...there are mentioned
<I>two</I> white <I>chouries</I> instead of one, and all kinds of seeds, perfumes and jewels, a
scimitar, a bow, a litter, a golden vase, and a blazing fire, and amongst the
living implements of the pageant, instead of the bards, gaudy courtesans, and
besides the eight damsels, professors of divinity, Br&aacute;hmanas, cows and pure
kinds of wild beasts and birds, the chiefs of town and country-people and the
citizens with their train.'

<I>Such blessings as the Gods o'erjoyed<BR>

</DIR>

<P>
Mythology regards Vritra as a demon or Asur, the implacable enemy of
Indra, but this is not the primitive idea contained in the name of Vritra. In
the hymns of the Veda Vritra appears to be the thick dark cloud which Indra
the God of the firmament attacks and disperses with his thunderbolt.' GORRESIO.

<P>
'In that class of Rig-veda hymns which there is reason to look upon as
the oldest portion of Vedic poetry, the character of Indra is that of a mighty
ruler of the firmament, and his principal feat is that of conquering the demon
<I>Vritra</I>, a symbolical personification of the cloud which obstructs the clearness
of the sky, and withholds the fructifying rain from the earth. In his battles
with Vritra he is therefore described as 'opening the receptacles of the waters,'
as 'cleaving the cloud' with his 'far-whirling thunderbolt,' as 'casting the waters
down to earth.' and 'restoring the sun to the sky.' He is in consequence 'the
upholder of heaven, earth, and firmament,' and the god 'who has engendered
the sun and the dawn.' CHAMBERS'S CYCLOP&AElig;DIA, <I>lndra</I>.

<P>
'Throughout these hymns two images stand out before us with overpowering
distinctness. On one side is the bright god of the heaven, as beneficent as
he is irresistible: on the other the demon of night and of darkness, as false and
treachorous as he is malignant... The latter (as his name Vritra, from var, to
veil, indicates) is pre-eminently the thief who hides away the rain-clouds... But
the myth is yet in too early a state to allow of the definite designations which are
brought before us in the conflicts of Zeus with Typh&ocirc;n and his monstrous
progeny, of Apoll&ocirc;n with the Pyth&ocirc;n, of Belleroph&ocirc;n with Chimaira of Oidipous
with the Sphinx, of Hercules with Cacus, of Sigurd with the dragon Fafnir; and
thus not only is Vritra known by many names, but he is opposed sometimes by
Indra, sometimes by Agni the fire-god, sometimes by Trita, Brihaspati, or other
deities; or rather these are all names of one and the same god:

&nbsp;&nbsp;  <I>Who of Nish&aacute;da lineage came.</I><BR>
</DIR>

<P>
The following account of the origin of the Nish&aacute;das is taken from Wilson's
<I>Vishnu Pur&aacute;na</I>, Book I. Chap. 15. 'Afterwards the Munis beheld a great dust
arise, and they said to the people who were nigh: "What is this?" And the
people answered and said: "Now that the kingdom is without a king, the dishonest
men have begun to seize the property of their neighbours. The great
dust that you behold, excellent Munis, is raised by troops of clustering robbers,
hastening to fall upon their prey." The sages, hearing this, consulted, and
together rubbed the thigh of the king (Vena), who had left no offspring, to
produce a son. From the thigh, thus rubbed, came forth a being of the complexion
of a charred stake, with flattened features like a negro, and of dwarfish
stature. "What am I to do," cried he eagerly to the Munis. "Sit down (nish&iacute;da),"
said they. And thence his name was Nish&aacute;da. His descendants, the inhabitants
of the Vindhy&aacute; mountain, great Muni, are still called Nish&aacute;das and are characterized
by the exterior tokens of depravity.' Professor Wilson adds, in his note on
the passage: 'The Matsya says that there were born outcast or barbarous races,
Mlechchhas, as black as collyrium. The Bh&aacute;gavata describes an individual of
dwarfish stature, with short arms and legs, of a complexion as black as a crow,
with projecting chin, broad flat nose, red eyes, and tawny hair, whose descendants
were mountaineers and foresters. The Padma (Bh&uacute;mi Khanda) has a
similar deccription; adding to the dwarfish stature and black complexion, a
wide mouth, large ears, and a protuberant belly. It also particularizes his posterity
as Nish&aacute;das, Kir&aacute;tas, Bhillas, and other barbarians and Mlechchhas, living
in woods and on mountains. These passages intend, and do not much exaggerate,
the uncouth appearance of the Gonds, Koles, Bhils, and other uncivilized tribes,
scattered along the forests and mountains of Central India from Behar to Khandesh,
and who are, not improbably, the predecessors of the present occupants of
the cultivated portions of the country. They are always very black, ill-shapen,
and dwarfish, and have countenances of a very African character.'

'The punishment which the Code of Manu awards to the slayer of a
Brahman was to be branded in the forehead with the mark of a headless corpse,
and entirely banished from society; this being apparently commutable for a fine.
The poem is therefore in accordance with the Code regarding the peculiar guilt
of killing Brahmans; but in allowing a hermit who was not a <I>Divija</I> (twice-born)
to go to heaven, the poem is far in advance of the Code. The youth in the poem
is allowed to read the Veda, and to accumulate merit by his own as well as his

'Compare this magnificent eulogium of kings and kingly government with
what Samuel says of the king and his authority: And Samuel told all the words
of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.

<P>
And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you:
He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to
be his horsemen: and some shall run before his chariots.

<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties, and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instrument of war, and instruments of his chariots.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And he will take your fields, and your vineyards and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.

<P>
'Two routes from Ayodhy&aacute; to R&aacute;jagriha or Girivraja are described. That taken by the envoys appears to have been the shorter one, and we are not told why Bharath returned by a different road. The capital of the Kekeyas lay to the west of the Vip&aacute;s'&aacute;. Between it and the S'atadru stretched the country of the Bahikas. Upon the remaining portion of the road the two recensions differ. According to that of Bengal there follow towards the east the river Indamat&iacute;,
then the town Ajak&aacute;la belonging to the Bodhi, then Bhuling&aacute;, then the river S'aradand&aacute;. According to the other instead of the first river comes the Ikshumat&iacute;...instead of the first town Abhik&aacute;la, instead of the second Kuling&aacute;, then the second river. According to the direction of the route both the above-mentioned rivers must be tributaries of the S'atadr&uacute;...The road then crossed the Yamnun&aacute; (Jumna), led beyond that river through the country of the Panch&aacute;las, and reached the Ganges at H&aacute;stinapura, where the ferry was. Thence it led over the R&aacute;magang&aacute; and its eastern tributaries, then over the Gomati, and then in a
southern direction along the M&aacute;lini, beyond which it reached Ayodhy&aacute;*. In Bharath's journey the following rivers are passed from west to east: <I>Kutikeshtik&aacute;</I>, <I>Utt&aacute;nik&aacute;</I>, <I>Kutik&aacute;</I>, <I>Kap&iacute;vat&iacute;</I>, <I>Gomat&iacute;</I> according to Schlegel, and <I>Hiranyairat&iacute;</I>, <I>Utt&aacute;rik&aacute;</I>, <I>Kvtil&aacute;</I>, <I>Kapivati</I>, <I>Gomat&iacute;</I> according to Gorresio. As these rivers are to be looked for on the east of the Ganges, the first must be the modern <I>K*oh</I>,
a small affluent of the R&aacute;magang&aacute;, over which the highway cannot have gone as it bends too far to the north. The Utt&aacute;nik&aacute; or Utt&aacute;rik&aacute; must be the R&aacute;magang&aacute;,the Kutik&aacute; or Kutil&aacute; its eastern tributary Kos'il&aacute;, the Kap&iacute;vat&iacute; the next tributary which on the maps has different names, <I>Gurra</I> or above Kailas,

"The narrative of R&aacute;ma's exile in the jungle is one of the most
obscure
portions of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana, inasmuch as it is difficult to discover any trace of the
original tradition, or any illustration of actual life and manners, beyond the
artificial life of self-mortification and selfdenial said to have been led by the
Brahman sages of olden time. At the same time, however, the story throws some
light upon the significance of the poem, and upon the character in which the
Brahmanical author desired to represent R&aacute;ma; and consequently it deserves
more serious consideration than the nature of the subject-matter would otherwise
seem to imply.

<P>
According to the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana, the hero R&aacute;ma spent more than thirteen
years of his exile in wandering amongst the different Brahmanical settlements,
which appear to have been scattered over the country between the Ganges and
the God&aacute;veri; his wanderings extending from the hill of Chitra-k&uacute;ta in Bundelkund,
to the modern town of Nasik on the western side of India, near the source
of the God&aacute;veri river, and about seventy-five miles to the north-west of Bombay.
The appearance of these Brahmanical hermitages in the country far away to the
south of the Raj of Kasala, seems to call for critical inquiry. Each
hermitage is
said to have belonged to some particular sage, who is famous in Brahmanical
tradition. But whether the sages named were really contemporaries of R&aacute;ma, or
whether they could possibly have flourished at one and the same period, is open
to serious question. It is of course impossible to fix with any degree of certainty
the relative chronology of the several sages, who are said to have been
visited by
R&aacute;ma; but still it seems tolerably clear that some belonged to an age far anterior
to that in which the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana was composed, and probably to an age anterior
to that in which R&aacute;ma existed as a real and living personage; whilst, at
least, one sage is to be found who could only have existed in the age during
which the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana was produced in its present form. The main proofs of these
inferences are as follows. An interval of many centuries seems to have elapsed
between the composition of the Rig-Veda and that of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana: a conclusion

<P>
<A NAME="page_544"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 544</FONT></A>

<P>
which has long been proved by the evidence of language, and is generally accepted
by Sanskrit scholars. But three of the sages, said to have been contemporary
with R&aacute;ma, namely, Vis'v&aacute;mitra, Atri and Agastya, are frequently mentioned in
the hymns of the Rig-Veda; whilst V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki, the sage dwelling at Chitra-k&uacute;ta,
is said to have been himself the composer of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana. Again, the sage Atri,
whom R&aacute;ma visited immediately after his departure from Chitra-k&uacute;ta, appears
in the genealogical list preserved in the Mah&aacute; Bh&aacute;rata, as the progenitor of the
Moon, and consequently as the first ancestor of the Lunar race: whilst his grandson
Buddha [Budha} is said to have married Il&aacute;, the daughter of Ikhs'v&aacute;ku
who was himself the remote ancestor of the Solar race of Ayodhy&aacute;, from whom
R&aacute;ma was removed by many generations. These conclusions are not perhaps based
upon absolute proof, because they are drawn from untrustworthy authorities;
but still the chronological difficulties have been fully apprehended by the Pundits,
and an attempt has been made to reconcile all contradictions by representing
the sages to have lived thousands of years, and to have often re-appeared upon
earth in different ages widely removed from each other. Modern science refuses
to accept such explanations; and consequently it is impossible to escape the conclusion
that if V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki composed the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana in the form of Sanskrit in which
it has been preserved, he could not have flourished in the same age as the sages
who are named in the Rig-Veda." WHEELER'S <I>History of India, Vol.</I> II, 229.

URVAS&Icirc;, PAGE 286.

<P>
"The personification of Urvas&icirc; herself is as thin as that of E&ocirc;s or Sel&ecirc;n&ecirc;.
Her name is often found in the Veda as a mere name for the morning, and in the
plural number it is used to denote the dawns which passing over men bring them
to old age and death. Urvas&icirc; is the bright flush of light overspreading the heaven
before the sun rises, and is but another form of the many mythical beings of
Greek mythology whose names take us back to the same idea or the same root.
As the dawn in the Vedic hymns is called Ur&ucirc;k&icirc;, the far-going (T&ecirc;lephassa, T&ecirc;lephos),
so is she also Uruas&icirc;, the wide-existing or wide-spreading; as are Eur&ocirc;p&ecirc;,
Euryanassa, Euryphassa, and many more of the sisters of Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; and Aphrodit&ecirc;.
As such she is the mother of Vasishtha, the bright being, as Oidipous is the son
of Iokast&ecirc;; and although Vasishtha, like Oidipous, has become a mortal bard or
sage, he is still the son of Mitra and Varuna, of night and day. Her lover Pur&ucirc;ravas
is the counterpart of the Hellenic Polydeuk&ecirc;s; but the continuance of her
union with him depends on the condition that she never sees him unclothed. But
the Gandharvas, impatient of her long sojourn among mortal men resolved to
bring her back to their bright home; and Pur&ucirc;ravas is thus led unwitingly to disregard
her warning. A ewe with two lambs was tied to her couch, and the Gandharvas
stole one of them; Urvas&icirc; said, "They take away my darling, as if I lived in a
land where there is no hero and no man." They stole the second, and she upbraided
her husband again. Then Pur&ucirc;ravas looked and said, "How can that be a land
without heroes or men where I am?" And naked he sprang up; he thought it
was too long to put on his dress. Then the Gandharvas sent a flash of lighting,
and Urvas&icirc; saw her husband naked as by daylight. Then she vanished. "I come
back," she said, and went. 'Then he bewailed his vanished love in bitter grief.'
Her promise to return was fulfilled, but for a moment only, at the Lotos-lake,
and Pur&ucirc;ravas in vain beseeches her to tarry longer. 'What shall I do with thy

<P>
<A NAME="page_547"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 547</FONT></A>

<P>
speech?' is the answer of Urvas&icirc;. 'I am gone like the first of the dawns. Pur&ucirc;ravas,
go home again. I am hard to be caught like the winds.' Her lover is in utter
despair; but when he lies down to die, the heart of Urvas&icirc; was melted, and she
bids him come to her on the last night of the year. On that night only he might
be with her; but a son should be born to him. On that day he went up to the
golden seats, and there Urvas&icirc; told him that the Gandharvas would grant him
one wish, and that he must make his choice. 'Choose thou for me,' he said: and
she answered, 'Say to them, Let me be one of you.'

"V&aacute;nar is one of the most frequently occurring names by which the poem
calls the monkeys of R&aacute;ma's army. Among the two or three derivations of which
the word V&aacute;nar is susceptible, one is that which deduces it from [Sanskrit: **} which signifies
a wood, and thus V&aacute;nar would mean a forester, an inhabitant of the wood. I
have said elsewhere that the monkeys, the V&aacute;nars, whom R&aacute;ma led to the conquest
of Ceylon were fierce woodland tribes who occupied the mountainous
regions of the south of India, where their descendants may still be seen. I shall

fierce combatants of R&aacute;ma's army." GORRESIO.

R&Aacute;MA'S ALLIANCE WITH SUGR&Iacute;VA.

<P>
"The literal interpretation of this portion of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana is indeed deeply
rooted in the mind of the Hindu. He implicitly believes that R&aacute;ma is Vishnu,
who became incarnate for the purpose of destroying the demon R&aacute;vana: that he
permitted his wife to be captured by R&aacute;vana for the sake of delivering the gods
and Br&aacute;hmans from the oppressions of the R&aacute;kshasa; and that he ultimately
assembled an army of monkeys, who were the progeny of the gods, and led them
against the strong-hold of R&aacute;vana at Lank&aacute;, and delivered the world from the
tyrant R&aacute;kshasa, whilst obtaining ample revenge for his own personal wrongs.

<P>
<A NAME="page_548"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 548</FONT></A>

<P>
One other point seems to demand consideration, namely, the possibility of
such an alliance as that which R&aacute;ma is said to have concluded with the monkeys.
This possibility will of course be denied by modern critics, but still it is interesting
to trace out the circumstances which seem to have led to the acceptance, of such a
wild belief by the dreamy and marvel loving Hindi. The south of India swarms
with monkeys of curious intelligence and rare physical powers. Their wonderful
instinct for organization, their attachment to particular localities, their occasional
journeys in large numbers over mountains and across rivers, their obstinate
assertion of supposed rights, and the ridiculous caricature which they exhibit of
all that is animal and emotional in man, would naturally create a deep impression....
Indeed the habits of monkeys well deserve to be patiently studied;
not as they appear in confinement, when much that is revolting in their nature is
developed, but as they appear living in freedom amongst the trees of the forest,
or in the streets of crowded cities, or precincts of temples. Such a study would
not fail to awaken strange ideas; and although the European would not be prepared
to regard monkeys as sacred animals he might be led to speculate as to their
origin by the light of data, which are at present unknown to the naturalist whose
observations have been derived from the menagerie alone.

<P>
Whatever, however, may have been the train of ideas which led the Hind&uacute;
to regard the monkey as a being half human and half divine, there can be little
doubt that in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana the monkeys of southern India have been confounded
with what may be called the aboriginal people of the country. The origin of
this confusion may be easily conjectured. Perchance the aborigines of the country
may have been regarded as a superior kind of monkeys; and to this day the features
of the Marawars, who are supposed to be the aborigines of the southern
part of the Carnatic, are not only different from those of their neighbours, but
are of a character calculated to confirm the conjecture. Again, it is probable
that the army of aborigines may have been accompanied by outlying bands of
monkeys impelled by that magpie-like curiosity and love of plunder which are
the peculiar characteristics of the monkey race; and this incident may have
given rise to the story that the army was composed of Monkeys."

THE FALL OF B&Aacute;LI, PAGE 342.

<P>
"As regards the narrative, it certainly seems to refer to some real event
amongst the aboriginal tribes: namely, the quarrel between an elder and younger
brother for the possession of a R&aacute;j; and the subsequent alliance of R&aacute;ma with
the younger brother. It is somewhat remarkable that R&aacute;ma appears to have
formed an alliance with the wrong party, for the right of B&aacute;li was evidently
superior to that of Sugr&iacute;va; and it is especially worthy of note that R&aacute;ma compassed
the death of B&aacute;li by an act contrary to all the laws of fair fighting. Again,
R&aacute;ma seems to have tacitly sanctioned the transfer of T&aacute;r&aacute; from B&aacute;li to Sugr&iacute;va,
which was directly opposed to modern rule, although in conformity with the
rude customs of a barbarous age; and it is remarkable that to this day the
marriage of both widows and divorced women is practised by the Marawars, or
aborigines of the southern Carnatic, contrary to the deeply-rooted prejudice
which exists against such unions amongst the Hind&uacute;s at large."

THE V&Aacute;NAR HOST, PAGE 370.

<P>
"The splendid Marutas form the army of Indras, the red-haired monkeys
and bears that of R&acirc;mas; and the mythical and solar nature of the monkeys
and bears of the R&acirc;m&acirc;yanam manifests itself several times. The king of the
monkeys is a sun-god. Thc ancient king was named B&acirc;lin, and was the son of
Indras. His younger brother Sugr&iacute;vas, he who changes his shape at pleasure
(K&acirc;mar&uacute;pas), who, helped by R&acirc;mas, usurped his throne, is said to be own child
of the sun. Here it is evident that the Vedic antagonism between Indras and
Vishnus is reproduced in a zoological and entirely apish form. The old Zeus must
give way to the new, the moon to the sun, the evening to the morning sun, the
sun of winter to that of spring; the young son betrays and overthrows the old
one.... R&acirc;mas, who treacherously kills the old king of the monkeys, B&acirc;lin, is
the equivalent of Vishnus, who hurls his predecessor Indras from his throne;
and Sugr&iacute;vas, the new king of the monkeys resembles Indras when he promises
to find the ravished S&iacute;t&aacute;, in the same way as Vishnus in one of his incarnations
finds again the lost ved&aacute;s. And there are other indications in the R&acirc;m&acirc;yanam
of opposition between Indras and the monkeys who assist R&acirc;mas. The great
monkey Hanumant, of the reddish colour of gold, has his jaw broken, Indras
having struck him with his thunderbolt and caused him to fall upon a mountain,
because, while yet a child, he threw himself off a mountain into the air in order to
arrest the course of the sun, whose rays had no effect upon him. (The cloud rises
from the mountain and hides the sun, which is unable of itself to disperse it;
the tempest comes, and brings flashes of lightning and thunder-bolts, which tear
the cloud in pieces.)

<P>
The whole legend of the monkey Hanumant represents the sun entering
into the cloud or darkness, and coming out of it. His father is said to be now
the wind, now the elephant of the monkeys (Kapikunjaras), now Kes'arin, the
long-haired sun, the sun with a mane, the lion sun (whence his name of <I>Kes'arinak
putrah</I>). From this point of view, Hanumant would seem to be the brother of
Sugr&iacute;vas, who is also the offspring of the sun....

<P>
All the epic monkeys of the <I>R&acirc;m&acirc;yanam</I> are described in the twentieth
canto of the first book by expressions which very closely resemble those applied
in the Vedic hymns to the Marutas, as swift as the tempestuous wind, changing
their shape at pleasure, making a noise like clouds, sounding like thunder,
battling, hurling mountain-peaks, shaking great uprooted trees, stirring up the
deep waters, crushing the earth with their arms, making the clouds fall. Thus
B&acirc;lin comes out of the cavern as the sun out of the cloud....

<P>
But the legend of the monkey Hanumant presents another curious resemblance
to that of Samson. Hanumant is bound with cords by Indrajit, son of
R&aacute;vanas; he could easily free himself, but does not wish to do so. R&aacute;vanas to
put him to shame, orders his tail to be burned, because the tail is the part most
prized by monkeys....

<P>
The tail of Hanumant, which sets fire to the city of the monsters, is probably
a personification of the rays of the morning or spring sun, which sets fire to
the eastern heavens, and destroys the abode of tne nocturnal or winter monsters."

NORTHERN KURUS, PAGE 378.

<P>
Professor Lassen remarks in the Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Kunde des Morgenlandes,
ii. 62: "At the furthest accessible extremity of the earth appears
Harivarsha with the northern Kurus. The region of Hari or Vishnu belongs to
the system of mythical geography; but the case is different with the Uttara
Kurus. Here there is a real basis of geographical fact; of which fable has only
taken advantage, without creating it. The Uttara Kurus were formerly quite independent
of the mythical system of <I>dv&iacute;pas</I>, though they were included in it at an
early date." Again the same writer says at p. 65: "That the conception of the
Uttara Kurus is based upon an actual country and not on mere invention, is
proved (1) by the way in which they are mentioned in the Vedas; (2) by the

<P>
existence of Uttara Kuru in historical times as a real country; and (3) by the
way in which the legend makes mention of that region as the home of primitive
customs. To begin with the last point the Mahabharata speaks as follows of the
freer mode of life which women led in the early world, Book I. verses 4719-22:
'Women were formerly unconfined and roved about at their pleasure, independent.
Though in their youthful innocence they abandoned their husbands, they
were guilty of no offence; for such was the rule in early times. This ancient
custom is even now the law for creatures born as brutes, which are free from lust
and anger. This custom is supported by authority and is observed by great rishia,
and it is <I> still practiced among the northern Kurus</I>.'

<P>
"The idea which is here conveyed is that of the continuance in one part of
the world of that original blessedness which prevailed in the golden age. To
afford a conception of the happy condition of the southern Kurus it is said in
another place M.-Bh, i. 4346. "The southern Kurus vied in happiness with the
northern Kurus and with the divine rishis and bards."

<P>
Professor Lassen goes on to say: "Ptolemy (vi. 16.) is also acquainted
with <I>Uttara Kuru</I>. He speaks of a mountain, a people, and a city called <I>Ottorakorra</I>.
Most of the other ancient authors who elsewhere mention this name, have
it from him. It is a part of the country which he calls Serica; according to him
the city lies twelve degrees west from the metropolis of Sera, and the mountain
extends from thence far to the eastward. As Ptolemy has misplaeed the whole of
eastern Asia beyond the Ganges, the relative position which he assigns will guide
us better that the absolute one, which removes Oitorakorra so far to the east
that a correction is inevitable. According to my opinion the Ottorakorra of
Ptolemy must be sought for to the east of Kashgar." Lassen also thinks that
Magasthenes had the Uttara Kurus in view when he referred to the Hyperboreans
who were fabled by Indian writers to live a thousand years. In his Indian antiquities,
(Ind. Alterthumskunde, i. 511, 512. and note,) the same writer concludes
that though the passages above cited relative to the Uttara Kurus indicate a
belief in the existence of a really existing country of that name in the far north,
yet that the descriptions there given are to be taken as pictures of an ideal paradise,
and not as founded on any recollections of the northern origin of the
Kurus. It is probable, he thinks, that some such reminiscences originally existed,
and still survived in the Vedic era, though there is no trace of their existence in
latter times." Muia's <I>Santkrit Texts</I>, Vol. II. pp. 336, 337.

The corresponding passage in the Bengal recension has "these silvans in

says Gorresio, "that these hosts of combatants whom Rama led to the coitqnest
of Lanka (Ceylon) the kingdom and seat of the Hamitic race, and whom the
poem calls monkeys, were in fact as I have elsewhere observed, inhabitants of the
mountainous and southen regions of India, who were wild-looking and not altogether
unlike monkeys. They were perhaps the remote ancestors of the Malay
races."

day. They were regarded as celestial musicians enlivening with their melodies

Indra's heaven and the banquets of the Gods. But the Gandharvas before becoming
celestial musicians in popular tradition, were in the primitive and true
signification of the name heroes, spirited and ardent warriors, followers of Indra,
and combined the heroical character with their atmospherical deity. Under this
aspect the dance of the Gandharvas may be a very different thing from what the
commentator means, and may signify the horrid dance of war." GORRESIO.

"The Muni or saint Agastya, author of several Vedic hymns, was celebrated
in Indo-Sanskrit tradition for having directed the first brahmanical settlements
in the southern regions of India; and the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata gives him the
credit of having subjected those countries, expelled the R&aacute;kshases. and given
security to the solitary ascetics, who were settled there. Hence Agastya was
regarded in ancient legend as the conqueror and ruler of the southern country.
This tradition refers to the earliest migrations made by the Sanskrit Indians
towards the south of India. To Agastya are attributed many marvellous mvthic
deeds which adumbrate and veil ancient events; some of which are alluded to
here and there in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana." GORRESIO.

The following is the literal translation of the Canto, text and commentary,

<P>
Having found R&aacute;ma weary with fighting and buried in deep thought,
and R&aacute;van standing before him ready to engage in battle, the holy Agastya,
who had come to see the battle, approached R&aacute;ma and spoke to him thus:
"O mighty R&aacute;ma, listen to the old mystery by which thou wilt conquer all thy
foes in the battle. Having daily repeated the &Aacute;dityahridaya (the delighter
of the mind of the Sun) the holy prayer which destroys all enemies (of him who
repeats it) gives victory, removes all sins, sorrows and distress, increases life,
and which is the blessing of all blessings, worship the rising and splendid sun
who is respected by both the Gods and demons, who gives light to all bodies and
who is the rich lord of all the worlds, (To the question why this prayer claims so
great reverence; the sage answers) Since yonder&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1096"></A><A HREF="#fn_1096"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> sun is full of glory and all gods
reside in him (he being their material cause) and bestows being and the active
principle on all creatures by his rays; and since he protects all deities, demons
and men with his rays.

under control, being pleased, committed the hymn to memory, recited it facing

and become pure took his bow, and seeing R&aacute;vana, was delighted, and meditated
on the sun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;  <I>His horses poured their burning tears.</I><BR>
</DIR>

<P>
I have omitted the Canto from which this line is taken because it describes
signs and portents similar to those which have occurred in preceding books. But
the weeping of the horses is new and is too Homeric to be passed by unnoticed.
I borrow the following extract from De Quincey: "The old Homeric superstition
which connects horses by the closest sympathy, and even by prescience, with their
masters--that superstition which Virgil has borrowed from Homer in his beautiful
episode of Mezentins (<I>Rhaebe diu</I>, res si qua diu mortalibus ulla est, Viximus)--
still lingers unbroken in Crete. Horses foresee the fates of riders who are doomed,
and express their prescience by weeping in a human fashion. The horses of
Achilles weep in "Iliad" xvii, on seeing Automedon their beloved driver prostrate
on the ground. With this view of the horse's capacity, it is singular, that
in Crete this animal by preference should be called &#0964&#0959 &#0945&#0955&#0959&#0947&#0959&#0965, the brute, or
irrational creature. But the word &#7985&#0960&#0960&#0959&#0962 has, by some accident, been lost in the
modern Greek. As an instance both of the disparaging name, and of the ennobling
superstition, take the following stanza from a Cretan ballad of 1825,
written in the modern Greek:--

R&Aacute;VAN'S FUNERAL.

<P>
"In the funeral ceremonies of India the fire was placed on three sides of the
pyre; the <I>Dakshina</I> on the south, the <I>G&aacute;rhapatya</I> on the west, and the <I>&Aacute;havan&iacute;ya</I>
on the east. The funeral rites are not described in detail here, and it is therefore
difficult to elucidate and explain them. The poem assigns the funeral ceremonies
of Aryan Brahmans to the R&aacute;kshases, a race different from them in origin and
religion, in the same way as Homer sometimes introduces into Troy the rites of
the Grecian cult." GORRESIO.

<P>
Mr. Muir translates the description of the funeral from the Calcutta edition,
as follows: "They formed, with Vedic rites, a funeral pile of faggots of sandal
wood, with <I>padmaka</I> wood, <I>us'ira</I> grass, and sandal, and covered with a quilt of
deer's hair. They then performed an unrivalled obsequial ceremony for the
R&aacute;xasa prince, placing the sacrificial ground to the S.E. and the fire in the proper
situation. They cast the ladle filled with curds and ghee on the shoulder&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1180"></A><A HREF="#fn_1180"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the
deceased; he (?) placed the car on the feet, and the mortar between the thighs.
Having deposited all the wooden vessels, the [upper] and lower fire-wood, and the
other pestle, in their proper places, they departed. The R&aacute;xasas having then slain
a victim to their prince in the manner prescribed in the S'&aacute;stras, and enjoined by
great rishis, cast [into the fire] the coverlet of the king saturated with ghee. They
then, Vibh&iacute;shana included, with afflicted hearts, adorned R&aacute;vana with perfumes
and garlands, and with various vestments, and besprinkled him with fried grain.
Vibh&iacute;shana having bathed, and having, with his clothes wet, scattered in proper
form <I>tila</I> seeds mixed with <I>darbha</I> grass, and moistened with water, applied the
fire [to the pile]."

"O R&aacute;ma, how dost thou, being the creator of all the world, best of all
those who have profound knowledge of the Upanishads and all-powerful as thou
art, suffer Sit&aacute; to fall in the fire? How dost thou not know thyself as the best
of the gods? Thou art one of the primeval Vasus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1181"></A><A HREF="#fn_1181"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and also their lord and creator.

(The poet describes R&aacute;ma as made of the following gods) The As'vinikum&aacute;ras
(the twin divine physicians of the gods) are thy ears; the sun and the moon are thy
eyes; and thou hast been seen in the beginning and at the end of creation. How
dost thou neglect the daughter of Videha (Janaka like a man whose actions are

the other gods, R&aacute;ma the descendant of Raghu, lord of the world and the best of
the virtuous, spoke to the chief of the gods. "As I take myself to be a man of
the name of R&aacute;ma and son of Das'aratha, therefore, sir, please tell me who I am
and whence have I come." "O thou whose might is never failing," said Brahm&aacute;
to K&aacute;kutstha the foremost of those who thoroughly know Brahm&aacute;, "Thou art

THE MEETING, PAGE 503.

<P>
The <I>Bharat-Mil&aacute;p</I> or meeting with Bharat, is the closing scene of the
dramatic representation of R&aacute;ma's great victory and triumphant return which
takes place annually in October in many of the cities of Northern India. The
R&aacute;m-Lal&aacute; or Play of R&aacute;ma, as the great drama is called, is performed in the open
air and lasts with one day's break through fifteen successive days. At Benares
there are three nearly simultaneous performances, one provided by H. H. the
Maharajah of Benares near his palace at Ramnaggur, one by H. H. the Maharajah
of Vizianagram near the Missionary settlement at Sigra and at other places in
the city, and one by the leading gentry of the city at Chowk&aacute; Gh&aacute;t near the
College. The scene especially on the great day when the brothers meet is most
interesting: the procession of elephants with their gorgeous howdahs of silver and
gold and their magnificently dressed riders with priceless jewels sparkling in their
turbans, the enthusiasm of the thousands of spectators who fill the streets and
squares, the balconies and the housetops, the flowers that are rained down upon
the advancing car, the wild music, the shouting and the joy, make an impression
that is not easily forgotten.

I end these notes with an extract which I translate from Signor Gorreslo's
Preface to the tenth volume of his R&aacute;m&aacute;yan, and I take this opportunity of again
thankfully acknowledging my great obligations to this eminent S'anskritist from
whom I have so frequently borrowed. As Mr. Muir has observed, the Bengal recension
which Signor Gorresio has most ably edited is throughout an admirable
commentary on the genuine R&aacute;m&aacute;yan of northern India, and I have made constant
reference to the faithful and elegant translation which accompanies the text
for assistance and confirmation in difficulties:

<P>
"Towards the southern extremity and in the island of Lank&aacute; (Ceylon) there
existed undoubtedly a black and ferocious race, averse to the Aryans and hostile
to their mode of worship: their ramifications extended through the islands of the
Archipelago, and some traces of them remain in Java to this day.

<P>
The Sanskrit-Indians, applying to this race a name expressive of hatred
which occurs in the Vedas as the name of hostile, savage and detested beings,
called it the R&aacute;kshas race: it is against these R&aacute;kshases that the expedition of
R&aacute;ma which the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan celebrates is directed. The
Sanskrit-Indians certainly
altered in their traditions the real character of this race: they attributed to it
physical and moral qualities not found in human nature; they transformed it
into a race of giants; they represented it as monstrous, hideous, truculent, changing
forms at will, blood-thirsty and ravenous, just as the Semites represented the
races that opposed them as impious, horrible and of monstrous size. But notwithstanding
these mythical exaggerations, which are partly due to the genius of the
Aryans so prone to magnify everything without measure, the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan in the
course of its epic narration has still preserved and noted here and there some traits
and peculiarities of the race which reveal its true character. It represents the
R&aacute;kshases as black of hue, and compares them with black clouds and masses of
black collyrium; it attributes to them curly woolly hair and thick lips, it depicts
them as loaded with chains, collars and girdles of gold, and the other bright ornaments
which their race has always loved, and in which the kindred races of the
Soudan still delight. It describes them as worshippers of matter and force.
They are hostile to the religion of the Aryans whose rites and sacrifices they
disturb and ruin...Such is the R&aacute;kshas race as represented in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan; and
the war of the Aryan R&aacute;ma forms the subject of the epic, a subject certainly real
and historical as far as regards its substance, but greatly exaggerated by the
ancient myth. In Sanskrit-Indian tradition are found traces of another struggle
of the Aryans with the R&aacute;kshas races, which preceded the war of R&aacute;ma. According
to some pauranic legends, K&aacute;rttav&iacute;rya a descendant of the royal tribe of tha
Y&aacute;davas, contemporary with Parasurama and a little anterior to R&aacute;ma, attacked
Lank&aacute; and took R&aacute;van prisoner. This well shows how ancient and how deeply
rooted in the Aryan race is the thought of this war which the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan celebrates.

"But," says an eminent Indianist &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1204"></A><A HREF="#fn_1204"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> whose learning I highly appreciate,
"the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan if an allegorical epic, and no precise and historical value can be
assigned to it. S&iacute;t&aacute; signifies the furrow made by the plough, and under this
symbolical aspect has already appeared honoured with worship in the hymns of
the Rig-veda; R&aacute;ma is the bearer of the plough (this assertion is entirely gratuitous;
these two allegorical personages represented agriculture introduced to
the southern regions of India by the race of the Kosalas from whom R&aacute;ma was
descended; the R&aacute;kshases on whom he makes war are races of demons and giants
who have little or nothing human about them; allegory therefore predominates
in the poem, and the exact reality of an historical event must not be looked for
in it." Such is Professor Weber's opinion. If he means to say that mythical
fictions are mingled with real events,

<P>
Forsan in alcun vero suo arco percuote,

<P>
as Dante says, and I fully concede the point. The interweaving of the myth with
the historical truth belongs to the essence, so to speak, of the primitive epopeia.
If S&iacute;t&aacute; is born, as the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan feigns, from the furrow which King Janak opened
when he ploughed the earth, not a whit more real is the origin of Helen and
Aeneas as related in Homer and Virgil, and if the characters in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan
exceed human nature, and in a greater degree perhaps than is the case in analogous
epics, this springs in part from the nature of the subject and still more from
the symbol-loving genius of the orient. Still the characters of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan,
although they exceed more or less the limits of human nature, act notwithstanding
in the course of the poem, speak, feel, rejoice and grieve according to the natural
impulse of human passions. But if by saying that the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan is an allegorical
epic, it is meant that its fundamental subject is nothing but allegory, that the war
of the Aryan R&aacute;ma against the R&aacute;kshas race is an allegory, that the conquest of
the southern region and of the island of Lank&aacute; is an allegory, I do not hesitate
to answer that such a presumption cannot be admitted and that the thing is in my
opinion impossible. Father Paol&iacute;no da S. Bartolommeo,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1205"></A><A HREF="#fn_1205"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> had already, together
with other strange opinions of his own on Indian matters, brought forward a
similar idea, that is to say that the exploit of R&aacute;ma which is the subject of the
R&aacute;m&aacute;yan was a symbol and represented the course of the sun: thus he imagined
that Brahm&aacute; was the earth, Vishnu the water, and that his avat&aacute;rs were the
blessings brought by the fertilizing waters, etc. But such ideas, born at a time
when Indo-sanskrit antiquities were enveloped in darkness, have been dissipated
by the light of new studies. How could an epic so dear in India to the memory
of the people, so deeply rooted for many centuries in the minds of all, so propagated
and diffused through all the dialects and languages of those region,
which had become the source of many dramas which are still represented in
India, which is itself represented every year with such magnificence and to such
crowds of people in the neighbourhood of Ayodhy&aacute;, a poem welcomed at its very
birth with such favour, as the legend relates, that the recitation of it by the first
wandering Rhapsodists has consecrated and made famous all the places celebrated

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_565"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 565</FONT></A>

<P>
by them, and where R&aacute;ma made a shorter or longer stay, how, I ask, could such
an epic have been purely allegorical? How, upon a pure invention, upon a simple
allegory, could a poem have been composed of about fifty thousand verses, relating
with such force and power the events, and giving details with such exactness?
On a theme purely allegorical there may easily be composed a short mythical
poem, as for example a poem on Proserpine or Psyche: but never an epic so full
of traditions and historical memories, so intimately connected with the life of
the people, as the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1206"></A><A HREF="#fn_1206"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> 
Excessive readiness to find allegory whenever some
traces of symbolism occur, where the myth partly veils the historical reality, may
lead and often has led to error. What poetical work of mythical times could
stand this mode of trial? could there not be made, or rather has there not been
made a work altogether allegorical, out of the Homeric poems? We have all
heard of the ingenious idea of the anonymous writer, who in order to prove how
easily we may pass beyond the truth in our wish to seek and find allegory everywhere,
undertook with keen subtlety to prove that the great personality of
Napoleon I. was altogether allegorical and represented the sun. Napoleon was
born in an island, his course was from west to east, his twelve marshals were the
twelve signs of the zodiac, etc.

<P>
I conclude then, that the fundamental theme of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan, that is to
say the war of the Aryan R&aacute;ma against the R&aacute;kshases, an Hamitic race settled
in the south, ought to be regarded as real and historical as far as regards its substance,
although the mythic element intermingled with the true sometimes alters
its natural and genuine aspect.

<P>
How then did the Indo-Sanskrit epopeia form and complete itself? What
elements did it interweave in its progress? How did it embody, how did it clothe
the naked and simple primitive datum? We must first of all remember that the
Indo-European races possessed the epic genius in the highest degree, and that
they alone in the different regions they occupied produced epic poetry...But other
causes and particular influences combined to nourish and develop the epic germ
of the Sanskrit-Indians. Already in the Rig-veda are found hymns in which the
Aryan genius preluded, so to speak, to the future epopeia, in songs that celebrated
the heroic deeds of Indra, the combats and the victories of the tutelary Gods
of the Aryan races over enemies secret or open, human or superhuman, the exploits
and the memories of ancient heroes. More recently, at certain solemn
occasions, as the very learned A. Weber remarks, at the solemnity, for example
of the As'vamedha of sacrifice of the horse, the praises of the king who ordained
the great rite were sung by bards and ministrels in songs composed for the purpose,
the memories of past times were recalled and honourable mention was made
of the just and pious kings of old. In the <I>Br&aacute;hmanas</I>, a sort of prose commentaries
annexed to the Vedas, are found recorded stories and legends which allude
to historical events of the past ages, to ancient memories, and to mythical events.
Such popular legends which the <I>Br&aacute;hmanas</I> undoubtedly gathered from tradition
admirably suited the epic tissue with which they were interwoven by successive
hands......Many and various mythico-historical traditions suitable for epic development, 
were diffused among the Aryan races, those for example which are related

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_566"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 566</FONT></A>

<P>
in the four chapters containing the description of the earth, the Descent of the
Ganges, etc. The epic genius however sometimes created beings of its own and
gave body and life to ideal conceptions. Some of the persons in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan
must be, in my opinion, either personifications of the forces of nature like those
which are described with such vigour in the <I>Sh&aacute;hn&aacute;mah</I>, or if not exactly created,
exaggerated beyond human proportions; others, vedic personages much more ancient
than R&aacute;ma, were introduced into the epic and woven into its narrations, to
bring together men who lived in different and distant ages, as has been the case
in times nearer to our own, in the epics, I mean, of the middle ages.

<P>
In the introduction I have discussed the antiquity of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan;
and by means of those critical and inductive proofs which are all that an
antiquity without precise historical dates can furnish I have endeavoured to
establish with all the certainy that the subject admitted, that the original
composition of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan is to be assigned to about the twelfth century before
the Christian era. Not that I believe that the epic then sprang to life in the
form in which we now possess it; I think, and I have elsewhere expressed the
opinion, that the poem during the course of its rhapsodical and oral propagation
appropriated by way of episodes, traditions, legends and ancient myths......But
as far as regards the epic poem properly so called which celebrates the expedition
of R&aacute;ma against the R&aacute;kshases I think that I have sufficiently shown that
its origin and first appearance should be placed about the twelfth century B C.;
nor have I hitherto met with anything to oppose this chronological result, or to
oblige me to rectify or reject it......But an eminent philologist already quoted,
deeply versed in these studies, A. Weber, has expressed in some of his writings a
totally different opinion; and the authority of his name, if not the number and
cogency of his arguments, compels me to say something on the subject. From
the fact or rather the assumption that Megasthenes &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1207"></A><A HREF="#fn_1207"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who lived some time in
India has made no mention either of the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rat or the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan Professor
Weber argues that neither of these poems could have existed at that time; as regards
the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan, the unity of its composition, the chain that binds together
its different parts, and its allegorical character, show it, says Professor Weber, to
be much more recent than the age to which I have assigned it, near to our own
era, and according to him, later than the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rat. As for Megasthenes it
should be observed, that he did not write a history of India, much less a literary
history or anything at all resembling one, but a simple description, in great part
physical, of India: whence, from his silence on literary matters to draw inferences
regarding the history of Sanskrit literature would be the same thing as
from the silence of a geologist with respect to the literature of a country whose
valleys, mountains, and internal structure he is exploring, to conjecture that such
and such a poem or history not mentioned by him did not exist at his time. We
have only to look at the fragments of Megasthenes collected and published by
Schwanbeck to see what was the nature and scope of his <I>Indica</I>.................. But
only a few fragments of Megasthenes are extant; and to pretend that they
should be argument and proof enough to judge the antiquity of a poem is to press
the laws of criticism too far. To Professor Weber's argument as to the more or

<P>
less recent age of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan from the unity of its composition, I will make
one sole reply, which is that if unity of composition were really a proof of a more
recent age, it would be necessary to reduce by a thousand years at least the age
of Homer and bring him down to the age of Augustus and Virgil; for certainly
there is much more unity of composition, a greater accord and harmony of parts
in the Iliad and the Odyssey than in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan. But in the fine arts perfection
is no proof of a recent age: while the experience and the continuous labour
of successive ages are necessary to extend and perfect the physical or natural
sciences, art which is spontaneous in its nature can produce and has produced in
remote times works of such perfection as later ages have not been able to equal."

this work from the pen of the Professor of Sanskrit in the University of Cambridge:
'The <I>Uttarak&aacute;nda</I>.' Mr. Cowell remarks, 'bears the same relation to the
<I>R&aacute;m&aacute;yana</I>, as the Cyclic poems to the <I>Iliad</I>. Just as the <I>Cypria</I> of Stasinus, the
<I>Aethiopis</I> of Arctinus, and the little <I>Iliad</I> of Lesches completed the story of the <A NAME="page_517"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 517</FONT></A>
<I>Iliad</I>, and not only added the series of events which preceded and followed it,
but also founded episodes of their own on isolated allusions in Homer, so the
<I>Uttarak&aacute;nda</I> is intended to complete the <I>R&aacute;m&aacute;yana</I>, and at the same time to
supplement it by intervening episodes to explain casual allusions or isolated incidents
which occur in it. Thus the early history of the giant R&aacute;vana and his
family fills nearly forty Chapters, and we have a full account of his wars with
the gods and His conquest of Lank&aacute;, which all happened long before the action
of the poem commences, just as the <I>Cypria</I> narrated the birth and earlv history
of Helen, and the two expeditions of the Greeks against Troy; and the latter
chapters continue the history of the hero R&aacute;ma after his triumphant return to
his paternal kingdom, and the poem closes with his death and that of his brothers,
and the founding by their descendants of various kingdoms in different parts
of India.'</P>
