<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLVII.: THE RETURN.</H3>
<P>
Thus forth in quest of Sit&aacute;<BR>
The legions King Sugr&iacute;va.<BR>
To many a distant town they hied<BR>
By many a lake and river's side.<BR>
As their great sovereign's order taught,<BR>
Through valleys, plains, and groves they sought.<BR>
They toiled unresting through the day:<BR>
At night upon the ground they lay<BR>
Where the tall trees, whose branches swayed<BR>
Beneath their fruit, gave pleasant shade.<BR>
Then, when a weary month was spent,<BR>
Back to Prasravan's hill they went,<BR>
And stood with faces of despair<BR>
Before their king Sugr&iacute;vae.<BR>
Thus, having wandered through the east,<BR>
Great Vinata his labours ceased,<BR>
And weary of the fruitless pain<BR>
Returned to meet the king again,<BR>
Brave S'atabali to the north<BR>
Had led his V&aacute;narons forth.<BR>
Now to Sugr&iacute;va he sped<BR>
With all his host dispirited.<BR>
Sushen the western realms had sought.<BR>
And homeward now his legions brought.<BR>
All to Sugriva came, where still<BR>
He sat with R&aacute;ma on the hill.<BR>
Before their sovereign humbly bent<BR>
And thus addressed him reverent:<BR>
'On every hill our steps have been,<BR>
By wood and cave and deep ravine;<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And all the wandering brooks we know<BR>
throughout the land that seaward flow,<BR>
Our feet by thy command have traced<BR>
the tangled thicket and the waste,<BR>
and dens and dingles hard to pass<BR>
for creeping plants and matted grass<BR>
Well have we searched with toil and pain,<BR>
And monstrous creatures have we slain<BR>
But Hanum&aacute;noblest mind<BR>
The Maithil lady yet will find;<BR>
For to his quarter of the sky &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_751"></A><A HREF="ry322.htm#fn_751"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
