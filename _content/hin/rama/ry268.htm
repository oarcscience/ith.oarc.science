<P>
When every rite was duly paid<BR>
The princely brothers onward strayed,<BR>
An eager in the lady's quest<BR>
They turned their footsteps to the west.<BR>
Through lonely woods that round them lay<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's children made their way,<BR>


<P>
And armed with bow and shaft and brand<BR>
Pressed onward to the southern land.<BR>
Thick trees and shrubs and creepers grew<BR>
In the wild grove they hurried through.<BR>
'Twas dark and drear and hard to pass<BR>
For tangled thorns and matted grass.<BR>
Still onward with a southern course<BR>
They made their way with vigorous force<BR>
And passing through the mazes stood<BR>
Beyond that vast and fearful wood.<BR>
With toil and hardship yet unspent<BR>
Three leagues from Janasth&aacute;n they went,<BR>
And speeding on their way at last<BR>
Within the wood of Krauncha &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> passed:<BR>
A fearful forest wild and black<BR>
As some huge pile of cloudy rack,<BR>
Filled with all birds and beasts, where grew<BR>
Bright blooms of every varied hue.<BR>
On S&iacute;t&aacute; bending every thought<BR>
Through all the mighty wood they sought,<BR>
And at the lady's loss dismayed<BR>
Here for a while and there they stayed.<BR>
Then turning farther eastward they<BR>
Pursued three leagues their weary way,<BR>
Passed Krauncha's wood and reached the grove<BR>
Where elephants rejoiced to rove.<BR>
The chiefs that awful wood surveyed<BR>
Where deer and wild birds filled each glade,<BR>
Where scarce a step the foot could take<BR>
For tangled shrub and tree and brake.<BR>
There in a mountain's woody side<BR>
A cave the royal brothers spied,<BR>
With dread abysses deep as hell,<BR>
Where darkness never ceased to dwell.<BR>
When, pressing on, the lords of men<BR>
Stood near the entrance of the den,<BR>
They saw within the dark recess<BR>
A huge misshapen giantess;<BR>
A thing the timid heart that shook<BR>
With fearful shape and savage look.<BR>
Terrific fiend, her voice was fierce,<BR>
Long were her teeth to rend and pierce.<BR>
The monster gorged her horrid feast<BR>
Of flesh of many a savage beast,<BR>
While her long locks, at random flung,<BR>
Dishevelled o'er her shoulders hung.<BR>
Their eyes the royal brothers raised,<BR>
And on the fearful monster gazed.<BR>
Forth from her den she came and glanced<BR>
At Lakshman as he first advanced,<BR>
Her eager arms to hold him spread,<BR>
And 'Come and be my love' she said,<BR>
Then as she held him to her breast,<BR>
The prince in words like these addressed:<BR>
'Behold thy treasure fond and fair:<BR>
Ayomukhi &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the name I bear.<BR>

<P>

<P>
In thickets of each lofty hill,<BR>
On islets of each brook and rill,<BR>
With me delighted shalt thou play,<BR>
And live for many a lengthened day.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Enraged he heard the monster woo;<BR>
His ready sword he swiftly drew,<BR>
And the sharp steel that quelled his foes<BR>
Cut through her breast and ear and nose.<BR>
Thus mangled by his vengeful sword<BR>
In rage and pain the demon roared,<BR>
And hideous with her awful face<BR>
Sped to her secret dwelling place.<BR>
Soon as the fiend had fled from sight,<BR>
The brothers, dauntless in their might,<BR>
Beached a wild forest dark and dread<BR>
Whose tangled ways were hard to tread.<BR>
Then bravest Lakshman, virtuous youth,<BR>
The friend of purity and truth,<BR>
With reverent palm to palm applied<BR>
Thus to his glorious brother cried:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'My arm presaging throbs amain,<BR>
My troubled heart is sick with pain,<BR>
And cheerless omens ill portend<BR>
Where'er my anxious eyes I bend.<BR>
Dear brother, hear my words: advance<BR>
Resolved and armed for every chance,<BR>
For every sign I mark to-day<BR>
Foretells a peril in the way.<BR>
This bird of most ill-omened note,<BR>
Loud streaming with discordant throat,<BR>
Announces with a warning cry<BR>
That strife and victory are nigh.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then as the chiefs their search pursued<BR>
Throughout the dreary solitude,<BR>
They heard amazed a mighty sound<BR>
That broke the very trees around.<BR>
As though a furious tempest passed<BR>
Crashing the wood beneath its blast.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma raised his trusty sword,<BR>
And both the hidden cause explored.<BR>
There stood before their wondering eyes<BR>
A fiend broad-chested, huge of size.<BR>
A vast misshapen trunk they saw<BR>
In height surpassing nature's law.<BR>
It stood before them dire and dread<BR>
Without a neck, without a head.<BR>
Tall as some hill aloft in air,<BR>
Its limbs were clothed with bristling hair,<BR>
And deep below the monster's waist<BR>
His vast misshapen mouth was placed.<BR>
His form was huge, his voice was loud<BR>
As some dark-tinted thunder cloud,<BR>
Forth from his ample chest there came<BR>
A brilliance as of gushing flame.<BR>
Beneath long lashes, dark and keen<BR>
The monster's single eye was seen.<BR>
Deep in his chest, long, fiercely bright,<BR>
It glittered with terrific light.<BR>
He swallowed down his savage fare<BR>
Of lion, bird, and slaughtered bear,<BR>
Aud with huge teeth exposed to view<BR>

<P>
O'er his great lips his tongue he drew.<BR>
His arms unshapely, vast and dread,<BR>
A league in length, he raised and spread.<BR>
He seized with monstrous hands a herd<BR>
Of deer and many a bear and bird.<BR>
Among them all he picked and chose,<BR>
Drew forward these, rejected those.<BR>
Before the princely pair he stood<BR>
Barring their passage through the wood.<BR>
A league of shade the chiefs had passed<BR>
When on the fiend their eyes they cast.<BR>
A monstrous shape without a head<BR>
With mighty arms before him spread,<BR>
They saw that hideous trunk appear<BR>
That struck the trembling eye with fear.<BR>
Then, stretching to their full extent<BR>
His awful arms with fingers bent,<BR>
Bound Raghu's princely sons he cast<BR>
Each grasping limb and held them fast.<BR>
Though strong of arm and fierce in fight,<BR>
Each armed with bow and sword to smite,<BR>
The royal brothers, brave and bold,<BR>
Were helpless in the giant's hold.<BR>
Then Raghu's son, heroic still,<BR>
Felt not a pang his bosom thrill;<BR>
But young, with no protection near,<BR>
His brother's heart was sad with fear,<BR>
And thus with trembling tongue he said<BR>
To R&aacute;ma, sore disquieted:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Ah me, ah me, my days are told:<BR>
O see me in the giant's hold.<BR>
Fly, son of Raghu, swiftly flee,<BR>
And thy dear self from danger free.<BR>
Me to the fiend an offering give;<BR>
Fly at thine ease thyself and live.<BR>
Thou, great Katkutstha's son, I ween,<BR>
Wilt find ere long thy Maithil queen,<BR>
And when thou holdest, throned again,<BR>
Thine old hereditary reign,<BR>
With servants prompt to do thy will,<BR>
O think upon thy brother still.'<BR>
As thus the trembling Lakshman cried,<BR>
The dauntless R&aacute;ma thus replied:<BR>
'Brother, from causeless dread forbear.<BR>
A chief like thee should scorn despair.'<BR>
He spoke to soothe his wild alarm:<BR>
Then fierce Kabandha &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> long of arm,<BR>
Among the D&aacute;navs &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_519"></A><A HREF="#fn_519"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> first and best,<BR>
The sons of Raghu thus addressed:<BR>
'What men are you, whose shoulders show<BR>
Broad as a bull's, with sword and bow,<BR>
Who roam this dark and horrid place.<BR>
Brought by your fate before my face?<BR>
Declare by what occasion led<BR>
These solitary wilds you tread,<BR>
With swords and bows and shafts to pierce,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_312"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 312</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Like bulls whose horns are strong and fierce.<BR>
Why have you sought this forest land<BR>
Where wild with hunger's pangs I stand?<BR>
Now as your steps my path have crossed<BR>
Esteem your lives already lost?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The royal brothers heard with dread<BR>
The words which fierce Kabandha said.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to his brother cried,<BR>
Whose cheek by blanching fear was dried.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Alas, we fall, O valiant chief,<BR>
From sorrow into direr grief,<BR>
Still mourning her I hold so dear<BR>
We see our own destruction near.<BR>
Mark, brother, mark what power has time<BR>
O'er all that live, in every chime<BR>
Now, lord of men, thyself and me<BR>
Involved in fatal danger see.<BR>
'Tis not, be sure, the might of Fate<BR>
That crushes all with deadly weight.<BR>
Ne'er can the brave and strong, who know<BR>
The use of spear and sword and bow,<BR>
The force of conquering time withstand,<BR>
But fall like barriers built of sand.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus in calm strength which naught could shake<BR>
The son of Das'aratha spake,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With glory yet unstained<BR>
Upon Sumitr&aacute;'s son he bent<BR>
His eyes, and firm in his intent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His dauntless heart maintained.<BR>
