<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXI.: THE V&Aacute;NARS' ALARM.</H3>
<P>
The son of Raghu near the wall<BR>
Saw, proudly towering over all,<BR>
The mighty giant stride along<BR>
Attended by the warrior throng;<BR>
Heard Kumbhakarna's heavy feet<BR>
Awake the echoes of the street;<BR>
And, with the lust of battle fired,<BR>
Turned to  and inquired:<BR>
'Vibh&iacute;shan, tell that chieftain's name<BR>
Who rears so high his mountain frame;<BR>
With glittering helm and lion eyes,<BR>
Preeminent in might and size<BR>
Above the rest of giant birth,<BR>
He towers the standard of the earth;<BR>
And all the V&aacute;nars when they see<BR>
The mighty warrior turn and flee.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'In him,' Vibh&iacute;shan answered, 'know<BR>
Vis'ravas' son, the Immortals' foe,<BR>
Fierce Kumbhakaiiia, mightier far<BR>
Than Gods and fiends and giants are.<BR>
He conquered Yama in the fight,<BR>
And Indra trembling owned his might.<BR>
His arm the Gods and fiends subdued,<BR>
Gandharvas and the serpent brood.<BR>
The rest of his gigantic race<BR>
Are wonderous strong by God-given grace;<BR>

<P>
But nature at his birth to him<BR>
Gave matchless power and strength of limb.<BR>
Scarce was he born, fierce monster, when<BR>
He killed and ate a thousand men.<BR>
The trembling race of men, appalled,<BR>
On Indra for protection called;<BR>
And he, to save the suffering world,<BR>
His bolt at Kumbhakarna hurled.<BR>
So awful was the monster's yell<BR>
That fear on all the nations fell,<BR>
He, rushing on with furious roar,<BR>
A tusk from huge Air&aacute;vat tore,<BR>
And dealt the God so dire a blow<BR>
That Indra reeling left his foe,<BR>
And with the Gods and mortals fled<BR>
To Brahm&aacute;'s throne dispirited.<BR>
'O Brahm&aacute;,' thus the suppliants cried,<BR>
'Some refuge for this woe provide.<BR>
If thus his maw the giant sate<BR>
Soon will the world be desolate.'<BR>
The Self-existent calmed their woe,<BR>
And spake in anger to their foe:<BR>
'As thou wast born, Paulastya's son,<BR>
That worlds might weep by thee undone,<BR>
Thou like the dead henceforth shalt be:<BR>
Such is the curse I lay on thee.'<BR>
Senseless he lay, nor spoke nor stirred;<BR>
Such was the power of Brahm&aacute;'s word.<BR>
But R&aacute;van, troubled for his sake,<BR>
Thus to the Self-existent spake:<BR>
'Who lops the tree his care has reared<BR>
When golden fruit has first appeared?<BR>
Not thus, O Brahm&aacute;, deal with one<BR>
Descended from thine own dear son.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_988"></A><A HREF="#fn_988"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Still thou, O Lord, thy word must keep<BR>
He may not die, but let him sleep.<BR>
Yet fix a time for him to break<BR>
The chains of slumber and awake.'<BR>
He ceased: and Brahm&aacute; made reply;<BR>
'Six months in slumber shall he lie<BR>
And then arising for a day<BR>
Shall cast the numbing bonds away.'<BR>
Now R&aacute;van in his doubt and dread<BR>
Has roused the monster from his bed,<BR>
Who comes in this the hour of need<BR>
On slaughtered V&aacute;nars flesh to feed.<BR>
Each V&aacute;nar, when his awe-struck eyes<BR>
Behold the monstrous chieftain, flies.<BR>
With hopeful words their minds deceive,<BR>
And let our trembling hosts believe<BR>
They see no giant, but, displayed,<BR>
A lifeless engine deftly made.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma called to Nila: 'Haste,<BR>
Let troops near every gate be placed,<BR>
And, armed with fragments of the rock<BR>
And trees, each lane and alley block.'<BR>

<P>
Thus Rama spoke: the chief obeyed,<BR>
And swift the V&aacute;nars stood arrayed,<BR>
As when the black clouds their battle form,<BR>
The summit of a hill to storm<BR>
