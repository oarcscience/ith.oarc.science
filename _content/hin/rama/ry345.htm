<P>
The glorious sight a while he viewed,<BR>
Then to the town his way pursued.<BR>
Around the Vanar as he went<BR>
Breathed from the wood delicious scent,<BR>
And the soft grass beneath his feet<BR>
With gem-like flowers was bright and sweet.<BR>
Still as the Vanar nearer drew<BR>
More clearly rose the town to view<BR>
The palm her fan-like leaves displayed,<BR>
Priy&aacute;las &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_804"></A><A HREF="#fn_804"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> lent their pleasant shade,<BR>
And mid the lower greenery far<BR>
Conspicuous rose the Kovid&aacute;r &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_805"></A><A HREF="#fn_805"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.<BR>
A thousand trees mid flowers that glowed<BR>
Hung down their fruit's delicious load &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_806"></A><A HREF="#fn_806"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,<BR>
And in their crests that rocked and swayed<BR>
Sweet birds delightful music made.<BR>
And there were pleasant pools whereon<BR>
The glories of the lotus shone;<BR>
And gleams of sparkling fountains, stirred<BR>
By many a joyous water-bird.<BR>

Around, in lovely gardens grew<BR>
Blooms sweet of scent and bright of hue,<BR>
And Lank&aacute;, seat of R&aacute;van's sway,<BR>
Before the wondering V&aacute;nar lay:<BR>
With stately domes and turrets tall,<BR>
Encircled by a golden wall,<BR>
And moats whose waters were aglow<BR>
With lily blossoms bright below:<BR>
For Sit&aacute;'s sake defended well<BR>
With bolt and bar and sentinel,<BR>
And Rakshases who roamed in bands<BR>
With ready bows in eager hands.<BR>
He saw the stately mansions rise<BR>
Like pale-hued clouds in autumn skies;<BR>
Where noble streets were broad and bright,<BR>
And banners waved on every height.<BR>
Her gates were glorious to behold<BR>
Rich with the shine of burnished gold:<BR>
A lovely city planned and decked<BR>
By heaven's creative arhitect &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_807"></A><A HREF="#fn_807"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A>,<BR>
Fairest of earthly cities meet<BR>
To be the Gods' celestial seat.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar by the northern gate<BR>
Thus in his heart began debate<BR>
'Our mightiest host would strive in vain<BR>
To take this city on the main:<BR>
A city that may well defy<BR>
The chosen warriors of the sky;<BR>
A city never to be won<BR>
E'en by the arm of Raghu's son.<BR>
Here is no hope by guile to win<BR>
The hostile hearts of those within.<BR>
'Twere vain to war, or bribe, or sow<BR>
Dissension mid the V&aacute;nar foe.<BR>
But now my search must I pursue<BR>
Until the Maithil queen I view:<BR>
And, when I find the captive dame,<BR>
Make victory mine only aim.<BR>
But, if I wear my present shape,<BR>
How shall I enter and escape<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas troops, their guards and spies,<BR>
And sleepless watch of cruel eyes?<BR>
The fiends of giant race who hold<BR>
This mighty town are strong and bold;<BR>
And I must labour to elude<BR>
The fiercely watchful multitude.<BR>
I in a shape to mock their sight<BR>
Must steal within the town by night,<BR>
Blind with my art the demons' eyes,<BR>
And thus achieve my enterprise.<BR>
How may I see, myself unseen<BR>
Of the fierce king, the captive queen.<BR>
And meet her in some lonely place,<BR>
With none beside her, face to face?'<BR>

<P>
When the bright sun had left the skies<BR>
The V&aacute;nar dwarfed his mighty size,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_398"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 398</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And, in the straitest bounds restrained,<BR>
The bigness of a cat retained. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_808"></A><A HREF="ry346.htm#fn_808"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Then, when the moon's soft light was spread,<BR>
Within the city's walls he sped.<BR>
