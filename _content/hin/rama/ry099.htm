<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXI.: KAUS'ALY&Aacute; CALMED.</H3>
<P>
While thus Kaus'aly&aacute; wept and sighed.<BR>
With timely words sad Lakshman cried:<BR>
'O honoured Queen I like it ill<BR>
That, subject to a woman's will,<BR>
R&aacute;ma his royal state should quit<BR>
And to an exile's doom submit.<BR>
The aged king, fond, changed, and week,<BR>
Will as the queen compels him speak.<BR>
But why should R&aacute;ma thus be sent<BR>
To the wild woods in banishment?<BR>
No least offence I find in him,<BR>
I see no fault his fame to dim.<BR>
Not one in all the world I know,<BR>
Not outcast wretch, not secret foe,<BR>
Whose whispering lips would dare assail<BR>
His spotless life with slanderous tale.<BR>
Godlike and bounteous, just, sincere,<BR>
E'en to his very foemen dear:<BR>
Who would without a cause neglect<BR>
The right, and such a son reject?<BR>
And if a king such order gave,<BR>
In second childhood, passion's slave,<BR>
What son within his heart would lay<BR>
The senseless order, and obey?<BR>
Come, R&aacute;ma, ere this plot be known<BR>
Stand by me and secure the throne.<BR>
Stand like the King who rules below,<BR>
Stand aided by thy brother's bow:<BR>
How can the might of meaner men<BR>
Resist thy royal purpose then!<BR>
My shafts, if rebels court their fate,<BR>
Shall lay Ayodhy&aacute; desolate.<BR>
Then shall her streets with blood be dyed<BR>
Of those who stand on Bharat's side:<BR>
None shall my slaughtering hand exempt,<BR>
For gentle patience earns contempt.<BR>
If, by Kaikey&iacute;s counsel changed,<BR>
Our father's heart be thus estranged,<BR>
No mercy must our arm restrain,<BR>
But let the foe be slain, be slain.<BR>
For should the guide, respected long,<BR>
No more discerning right and wrorg,<BR>
Turn in forbidden paths to stray,<BR>
'Tis meet that force his steps should stay.<BR>
What power sufficient can he see,<BR>
What motive for the wish has he,<BR>
That to Kaikey&iacute; would resign<BR>
The empire which is justly thine?<BR>
Can he, O conqueror of thy foes,<BR>
Thy strength and mine in war oppose?<BR>
Can he entrust, in our despite,<BR>
To Bharat's hand thy royal right!<BR>
I love this brother with the whole<BR>
Affection of my faithful soul.<BR>
Yea Queen, by bow and truth I swear,<BR>
By sacrifice, and gift, and prayer,<BR>
If R&aacute;ma to the forest goes,<BR>
Or where the burning furnace glows,<BR>
First shall my feet the forest tread,<BR>
The flames shall first surround my head.<BR>
My might shall chase thy grief and tears,<BR>
As darkness flies when morn appears.<BR>
Do thou, dear Queen, and R&aacute;ma too<BR>
Behold what power like mine can do.<BR>
My aged father I will kill,<BR>
The vassal of Kaikey&iacute;'s will,<BR>
Old, yet a child, the woman's thrall,<BR>
Infirm, and base, the scorn of all.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Lakshman cried,the mighty-souled:<BR>
Down her sad cheeks the torrents rolled,<BR>
As to her son Kaus'aly?spake:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Now thou hast heard thy brother, take<BR>
His counsel if thou hold it wise,<BR>
And do the thing his words advise.<BR>
Do not, my son, with tears I pray,<BR>
My rival's wicked word obey,<BR>
Leave me not here consumed with woe,<BR>
Nor to the wood, an exile, go.<BR>
If thou, to virtue ever true,<BR>
Thy duty's path would still pursue,<BR>
The highest duty bids thee stay<BR>
And thus thy mother's voice obey.<BR>
Thus Kas'yap's great ascetic son<BR>
A seat among the Immortals won:<BR>
In his own home, subdued, he stayed,<BR>
And honour to his mother paid.<BR>
If reverence to thy sire be due,<BR>
Thy mother claims like honour too,<BR>
And thus I charge thee, O my child,<BR>
Thou must not seek the forest wild.<BR>
Ah, what to me were life and bliss,<BR>
Condemned my darling son to miss?<BR>
But with my R&aacute;ma near, to eat<BR>
The very grass itself were sweet.<BR>
But if thou still wilt go and leave.<BR>
Thy hapless mother here to grieve,<BR>
I from that hour will food abjure,<BR>
Nor life without my son endure.<BR>
Then it will be thy fate to dwell<BR>
In depth of world-detested hell.<BR>
As Ocean in the olden time<BR>
Was guilty of an impious crime<BR>
That marked the lord of each fair flood<BR>
As one who spills a Br?maa'a blood.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spake the queen, and wept, and sighed:<BR>
Then righteous R&aacute;ma thus replied:<BR>
'I have no power to slight or break<BR>
Commandments which my father spake.<BR>
I bend my head, dear lady, low,<BR>
Forgive me, for I needs must go.<BR>
Once Kaudu, mighty saint, who made<BR>
His dwelling in the forest shade,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
A cow--and duty's claims he knew--<BR>
Obedient to his father, slew.<BR>
And in the line from which we spring,<BR>
When ordered by their sire the king,<BR>
Through earth the sons of Sagar cleft,<BR>
And countless things of life bereft. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
So Jamadagn&iacute;'s son &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_290"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> obeyed<BR>
His sire, when in the wood he laid<BR>
Hia hand upon his axe, and smote<BR>
Through Renuk&aacute; his mother's throat.<BR>
The deeds of these and more beside.<BR>
Peers of the Gods, my steps shall guide,<BR>
And resolute will I fulfil<BR>
My father's word, my father's will,<BR>
Nor I, O Queen, unsanctioned tread<BR>
This righteous path, by duty led:<BR>
The road my footsteps journey o'er<BR>
Was traversed by the great of yore.<BR>
This high command which all accept<BR>
Shall faithfully by me be kept,<BR>
For duty ne'er will him forsake<BR>
Who fears his sire's command to break.'<BR>

<P>
Thus to his mother wild with grief:<BR>
Then thus to Lakshman spake the chief<BR>
Of those by whom the bow is bent,<BR>
Mid all who speak, most eloquent:<BR>
'I know what love for me thou hast,<BR>
What firm devotion unsurpassed:<BR>
Thy valour and thy worth I know,<BR>
And glory that appals the foe.<BR>
Blest youth, my mother's woe is great.<BR>
It bends her 'neath its matchless weight:<BR>
No claims will she, with blinded eyes,<BR>
Of truth and patience recognize,<BR>
For duty is supreme in place,<BR>
And truth is duty's noblest base.<BR>
Obedient to my sire's behest<BR>
I serve the cause of duty best.<BR>
For man should truly do whate'er<BR>
To mother, Br&aacute;hman, sire, he sware:<BR>
He must in duty's path remain,<BR>
Nor let his word be pledged in vain.<BR>
And, O my brother, how can I<BR>
Obedience to this charge deny?<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;'s tongue my purpose spurred,<BR>
But 'twas my sire who gave the word.<BR>
Cast these unholy thoughts aside<BR>
Which smack of war and Warriors' pride;<BR>
To duty's call, not wrath attend,<BR>
And tread the path which I commend,'<BR>

<P>
R&aacute;ma by fond affection moved<BR>
His brother Lakshman thus reproved;<BR>
Then with joined hands and reverent head<BR>
Again to Queen Kaus&aacute;ly&aacute; said:<BR>

<P>
'I needs must go--do thou consent--<BR>
To the wild wood in banishment.<BR>
O give me, by my life I pray,<BR>
Thy blessing ere I go away.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
I, when the promised years are o'er,<BR>
Shall see Ayodhy&aacute;'s town once more.<BR>
Then, mother dear, thy tears restrain,<BR>
Nor let thy heart be wrung by pain:<BR>
In time, my father's will obeyed,<BR>
Shall I return from greenwood shade.<BR>
My dear Videhan, thou, and I,<BR>
Lakshman, Sumitr&aacute;, feel this tie,<BR>
And must my father's word obey,<BR>
As duty bids that rules for aye.<BR>
Thy preparations now forgo,<BR>
And lock within thy breast thy woe,<BR>
Nor be my pious wish withstood<BR>
To go an exile to the wood."<BR>
Calm and unmoved the prince explained<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His duty's claim and purpose high.<BR>
The mother life and sense regained,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Looked on her son and made reply:<BR>
'If reverence be thy father's due,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The same by right and love is mine:<BR>
Go not, my charge I thus renew,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nor leave me here in woe to pine,<BR>
What were such lonely life to me,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rites to the shades, or deathless lot?<BR>
More dear, my son, one hour with thee<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Than all the world where thou art not.<BR>
As bursts to view, when brands blaze high,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Some elephant concealed by night,<BR>
So, when he heard his mother's cry,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Burnt R&aacute;ma's grief with fiercer might.<BR>
Thus to the queen, half senseless still,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And Lakshman, burnt with heart-felt pain,<BR>
True to the right, with steadfast will,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His duteous speech he spoke again:<BR>
'Brother, I know thy loving mind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy valour and thy truth I know,<BR>
But now to claims of duty blind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thou and my mother swell my woe.<BR>
The fruits of deeds in human life<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Make love, gain, duty, manifest,<BR>
Dear when they meet as some fond wife<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With her sweet babes upon her breast.<BR>
But man to duty first should turn<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Whene'er the three are not combined:<BR>
For those who heed but gain we spurn,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And those to pleasure all resigned.<BR>
Shall then the virtuous disobey<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hosts of an aged king and sire,<BR>
Though feverous joy that father sway,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Or senseless love or causeless ire?<BR>
I have no powcr, commanded thus,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To slight his promise and decree:<BR>
The honoured sire of both of us,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My mother's lord and life is he.<BR>
Shall she, while yet the holy king<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is living, on the right intent,--<BR>
Shall she, like some poor widowed thing,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Go forth with me to banishment?<BR>
Now, mother, speed thy parting son,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And let thy blessing soothe my pain,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
That I may turn, mine exile done,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like King Yay&aacute;ti, home again.<BR>
Fair glory and the fruit she gives,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  For lust of sway I ne'er will slight:<BR>
What, for the span a mortal lives.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Were rule of earth without the right?'<BR>
He soothed her thus, firm to the last<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His counsel to his brother told:<BR>
Then round the queen in reverence passed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And held her in his loving hold.<BR>
