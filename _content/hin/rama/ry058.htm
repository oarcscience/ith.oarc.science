<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LVIII.: TRIS'ANKU CURSED.</H3>
<P>
Tris'anku's speech the hundred heard,<BR>
And thus replied, to anger stirred:<BR>
'Why foolish King, by him denied,<BR>
Whose truthful lips have never lied,<BR>
Dost thou transgress his prudent rule,<BR>
And seek, for aid, another school?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's sons have aye relied<BR>
Most surely on their holy guide:<BR>
Then how dost thou, fond Monarch, dare<BR>
Transgress the rule his lips declare?<BR>
'Thy wish is vain,' the saint replied,<BR>
And bade thee cast the plan aside.<BR>
Then how can we, his sons, pretend<BR>
In such a rite our aid to lend?<BR>
O Monarch, of the childish heart,<BR>
Home to thy royal town depart.<BR>
That mighty saint, thy priest and guide,<BR>
At noblest rites may well preside:<BR>
The worlds for sacrifice combined<BR>
A worthier priest could never find.'<BR>

<P>
Such speech of theirs the monarch heard,<BR>
Though rage distorted every word,<BR>
And to the hermits made reply:<BR>
'You, like your sire, my suit deny.<BR>
For other aid I turn from you:<BR>
So, rich in penance, Saints, adieu!'<BR>

<P>
Vas'ishtha's children heard, and guessed<BR>
His evil purpose scarce expressed,<BR>
And cried, while rage their bosoms burned,<BR>
'Be to a vile Chand&aacute;la&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> turned!'<BR>

<P>

<P>
This said, with lofty thoughts inspired,<BR>
Each to his own retreat retired.<BR>

<P>
That night Tris'anku underwent<BR>
Sad change in shape and lineament.<BR>
Next morn, an outcast swart of hue,<BR>
His dusky cloth he round him drew.<BR>
His hair had fallen from his head,<BR>
And roughness o'er his skin was spread.<BR>
Such wreaths adorned him as are found<BR>
To flourish on the funeral ground.<BR>
Each armlet was an iron ring:<BR>
Such was the figure of the king,<BR>
That every counsellor and peer,<BR>
And following townsman, fled in fear.<BR>

<P>
Alone, unyielding to dismay,<BR>
Though burnt by anguish night and day,<BR>
Great Vis'v&aacute;mitra's side he sought,<BR>
Whose treasures were by penance bought.<BR>

<P>
The hermit with his tender eyes<BR>
Looked on Tris'anku's altered guise,<BR>
And grieving at his ruined state<BR>
Addressed him thus, compassionate:<BR>
'Great King,' the pious hermit said,<BR>
'What cause thy steps has hither led,<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;'s mighty Sovereign, whom<BR>
A curse has plagued with outcast's doom?'<BR>
In vile Chand&aacute;la's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> shape, the king<BR>
Heard Vis'v&aacute;mitra's questioning,<BR>
And, suppliant palm to palm applied,<BR>
With answering eloquence he cried:<BR>
'My priest and all his sons refused<BR>
To aid the plan on which I mused.<BR>
Failing to win the boon I sought,<BR>
To this condition I was brought.<BR>
I, in the body, Saint, would fain<BR>
A mansion in the skies obtain.<BR>
I planned a hundred rites for this,<BR>
But still was doomed the fruit to miss.<BR>
Pure are my lips from falsehood's stain,<BR>
And pure they ever shall remain,--<BR>
Yea, by a Warrior's faith I swear,--<BR>
Though I be tried with grief and care.<BR>
Unnumbered rites to Heaven I paid,<BR>
With righteous care the sceptre swayed;<BR>
And holy priest and high-souled guide<BR>
My modest conduct gratified.<BR>
But, O thou best of hermits, they<BR>
Oppose my wish these rites to pay;<BR>
They one and all refuse consent,<BR>
Nor aid me in my high intent.<BR>
Fate is, I ween, the power supreme,<BR>
Plan's effort but an idle dream,<BR>
Fate whirls our plans, our all away;<BR>


<P>


<P>
Fate is our only hope and stay;<BR>
Now deign, O blessed Saint, to aid<BR>
Me, even me by Fate betrayed,<BR>
Who come, a suppliant, sore distressed,<BR>
One grace, O Hermit, to request.<BR>
No other hope or way I see:<BR>
No other refuge waits for me.<BR>
Oh, aid me in my fallen state,<BR>
And human will shall conquer Fate.'<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_235"></A><A HREF="ry058.htm#fr_235">69:1b</A>  "It does not appear how Tris'anku, in
asking the aid of Vas'ishtha's sons after
applying in vain to their father, could be
charged with resorting to another <I>s'&aacute;kh&aacute;</I>
(School) in the ordinary sense of that
word; as it is not conceivable that the
sons should have been of another S'&aacute;kh&aacute;
from the father, whose cause they espouse
with so much warmth. The commentator
in the Bombay edition explains the word
<I>S'&aacute;kh&aacute;ntaram</I> as Y&aacute;jan&aacute;din&aacute; raksh&aacute;ntaram,
'one who by sacrificing for thee, etc.,
will be another protector.' Gorresio's
Gauda*? text, which may often be used as a
commentary on the older one, has the
following paraphrase of the words in
question, ch. 60, 3. M&uacute;lam utsrijya*? kasm&aacute;t
tvam s'&aacute;k&aacute;sv ichhasi lambitum*?. 'Why,
forsaking the root, dost thou desire to
hang upon the branches?'"  MUIR, Sanskrit
Texts, Vol. I., p. 401.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_236"></A><A HREF="ry058.htm#fr_236">69:2b</A> A Chand&aacute;la was a man born of the
illegal and impure union of a S'&uacute;dra with
a woman of one of the three higher castes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_237"></A><A HREF="ry058.htm#fr_237">70:1</A>  The Chand&aacute;la was regarded as the vilest
and most abject of the men sprung from
wedlock forbidden by the law (M&aacute;navadharmas'&aacute;stra,
Lib. X. 12.); a kind of social
malediction weighed upon his head
and rejected him from human society.'
