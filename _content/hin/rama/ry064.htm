<P>
'A great emprise, O lovely maid,<BR>
To save the Gods, awaits thine aid:<BR>
To bind the son of Kus'ik sure,<BR>
And take his soul with love's sweet lure.'<BR>
Thus orderd by the Thousand-eyed<BR>
The suppliant nymph in fear replied:<BR>
'O Lord of Gods, this mighty sage<BR>
Is very fierce and swift to rage.<BR>
I doubt not, he so dread and stern<BR>
On me his scorching wrath will turn.<BR>
Of this, my lord, am I afraid:<BR>
Have mercy on a timid maid.'<BR>
Her suppliant hands began to shake,<BR>
When thus again Lord Indra spake:<BR>
'O Rambh&aacute;, drive thy fears away,<BR>
And as I bid do thou obey.<BR>
In Ko&iuml;l's form, who takes the heart<BR>
When trees in spring to blossom start,<BR>
I, with Kandarpa for my friend,<BR>
Close to thy side mine aid will lend.<BR>

<P>
Do thou thy beauteous splendour arm<BR>
With every grace and winsome charm,<BR>
And from his awful rites seduce<BR>
This Kus'ik's son, the stern recluse.'<BR>

<P>
Lord Indra ceased. The nymph obeyed;<BR>
In all her loveliest charms arrayed,<BR>
With winning ways and witching smile<BR>
She sought the hermit to beguile.<BR>
The sweet note of that tuneful bird<BR>
The saint with ravished bosom heard,<BR>
And on his heart a rapture passed<BR>
As on the nymph a look he cast.<BR>
But when he heard the bird prolong<BR>
His sweet incomparable song,<BR>
And saw the nymph with winning smile,<BR>
The hermit's heart perceiv'd the wile.<BR>
And straight he knew the Thousand-eyed<BR>
A plot against his peace had tried.<BR>
Then Kus'ik's son indignant laid<BR>
His curse upon the heavenly maid:<BR>
'Because thou wouldst my soul engage<BR>
Who fight to conquer love and rage,<BR>
Stand, till ten thousand years have flown,<BR>
Ill-fated maid, transformed to stone.<BR>
A Br&aacute;hman then, in glory strong,<BR>
Mighty through penance stern and long,<BR>
Shall free thee from thine altered shape;<BR>
Thou from my curse shalt then escape.'<BR>
But when the saint had cursed her so,<BR>
His breast was burnt with fires of woe,<BR>
Grieved that long effort to restrain<BR>
His mighty wrath was all in vain.<BR>
Cursed by the angry sage's power,<BR>
She stood in stone that selfsame hour.<BR>
Kandarpa heard the words he said,<BR>
And quickly from his presence fled.<BR>
His fall beneath his passion's sway<BR>
Had reft the hermit's meed away.<BR>
Unconquered yet his secret foes,<BR>
The humbled saint refused repose:<BR>
'No more shall rage my bosom till,<BR>
Sealed be my lips, my tongue be still.<BR>
My very breath henceforth I hold<BR>
Until a thousand years are told:<BR>
Victorious o'er each erring sense,<BR>
I'll dry my frame with abstinence,<BR>
Until by penance duly done<BR>
A Br&aacute;hman's rank be bought and won.<BR>
For countless yearn, as still as death.<BR>
I taste no food, I draw no breath,<BR>
And as I toil my frame shall stand<BR>
Unharmed by time's destroying hand.'<BR>
