<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXII.: AMBARESHA'S SACRIFICE.</H3>
<P>
As thus the king that youth conveyed,<BR>
His weary steeds at length he stayed<BR>
At height of noon their rest to take<BR>
Upon the bank of Pushkar's lake.<BR>
There while the king enjoyed repose<BR>
The captive S'unahs'epha rose,<BR>
And hasting to the water's side<BR>
His uncle Visvamitra spied,<BR>
With many a hermit 'neath the trees<BR>
Engaged in stern austerities.<BR>

<P>
Distracted with the toil and thirst,<BR>
With woeful mien, away he burst,<BR>
Swift to the hermit's breast he flew,<BR>
And weeping thus began to sue:<BR>
'No sire nave I, no mother dear,<BR>
No kith or kin my heart to cheer:<BR>
As justice bids, O Hermit, deign<BR>
To save me from the threatened pain.<BR>
O thou to whom the wretched flee,<BR>
And find a saviour, Saint, in thee,<BR>
Now let the king obtain his will,<BR>
And me my length of days fulfil,<BR>
That rites austere I too may share,<BR>
May rise to heaven and rest me there.<BR>
With tender soul and gentle brow<BR>
Be guardian of the orphan thou,<BR>
And as a father pities, so<BR>
Preserve me from my fear and woe.'<BR>

<P>
When V&iacute;sv&aacute;mitra, glorious saint,<BR>
Had heard the boy's heart-rending plaint.<BR>
He soothed his grief, his tears he dried,<BR>

<P>
Then called his sons to him, and cried:<BR>
'The time is come for you to show<BR>
The duty and the aid bestow<BR>
For which, regarding future life,<BR>
A man gives children to his wife.<BR>
This hermit's son, whom here you see<BR>
A suppliant, refuge seeks with me.<BR>
O sons, the friendless youth befriend,<BR>
And, pleasing me, his life defend.<BR>
For holy works you all have wrought,<BR>
True to the virtuous life I taught.<BR>
Go, and as victims doomed to bleed,<BR>
Die, and Lord Agni's hunger feed,<BR>
So shall the rite completed end,<BR>
This orphan gain a saving friend,<BR>
Due offerings to the Gods be paid,<BR>
And your own father's voice obeyed.'<BR>

<P>
Then Madhushyand and all the rest<BR>
Answered their sire with scorn and jest:<BR>
'What! aid to others' sons afford,<BR>
And leave thine own to die, my lord!<BR>
To us it seems a horrid deed,<BR>
As 'twere on one's own flesh to feed.'<BR>

<P>
The hermit heard his sons' reply,<BR>
And burning rage inflamed his eye.<BR>
Then forth his words of fury burst:<BR>
'Audacious speech, by virtue cursed!<BR>
It lifts on end each shuddering hair--<BR>
My charge to scorn! my wrath to dare!<BR>
You, like Vas'ishtha's evil brood,<BR>
Shall make the flesh of dogs your food<BR>
A thousand years in many a birth,<BR>
And punished thus shall dwell on earth.'<BR>

<P>
Thus on his sons his curse he laid.<BR>
Then calmed again that youth dismayed,<BR>
And blessed him with his saving aid;<BR>
'When in the sacred fetters bound,<BR>
And with a purple garland crowned,<BR>
At Vishnu's post thou standest tied,<BR>
With lauds be Agni glorified.<BR>
And these two hymns of holy praise<BR>
Forget not, Hermit's son, to raise<BR>
In the king's rite, and thou shalt be<BR>
Lord of thy wish, preserved, and free.'<BR>

<P>
He learnt the hymns with mind intent,<BR>
And from the hermit's presence went.<BR>
To Ambar&iacute;sha thus he spake:<BR>
'Let us our onward journey take.<BR>
Haste to thy home, O King, nor stay<BR>
The lustral rites with slow delay.'<BR>

<P>
The boy's address the monarch cheered,<BR>
And soon the sacred ground he neared.<BR>
The convocation's high decree<BR>
Declared the youth from blemish free;<BR>
Clothed in red raiment he was tied<BR>
A victim at the pillar's side.<BR>
There bound, the Fire-God's hymn he raised,<BR>
And Indra and Upendra praised.<BR>
Thousand-eyed Vishnu, pleased to hear<BR>
The mystic laud, inclined his ear,<BR>
And won by worship, swift to save,<BR>
Long life to S'unahs'epha gave.<BR>
The King in bounteous measure gained<BR>
The fruit of sacrifice ordained,<BR>
By grace of Him who rules the skies,<BR>
Lord Indra of the thousand eyes.<BR>

<P>
And Vis'v&aacute;mitra evermore.<BR>
Pursued his task on Pushkar's shore<BR>
Until a thousand years had past<BR>
In fierce austerity and fast.<BR>
