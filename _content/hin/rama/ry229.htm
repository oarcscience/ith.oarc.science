<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXI.: R&Aacute;VAN</H3>
<P>
But of the host of giants one,<BR>
Akampan, from the field had run<BR>
And sped to Lank&aacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to relate<BR>
In R&aacute;van's ear the demons' fate:<BR>

<P>
'King, many a giant from the shade<BR>
Of Janasth&aacute;n in death is laid:<BR>
Khara the chief is slain, and I<BR>
Could scarcely from the battle fly.'<BR>

<P>
Fierce anger, as the monarch heard,<BR>
Inflamed his look, his bosom stirred,<BR>
And while with scorching glance he eyed<BR>
The messenger, he thus replied:<BR>

<P>
'What fool has dared, already dead,<BR>
*Strike* Janasth&aacute;n, the general dread?<BR>

<P>

<P>
Who is the wretch shall vainly try<BR>
In earth, heaven, hell, from me to fly?<BR>
Vais'ravan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A>,Indra, Vishnu, He<BR>
Who rules the dead, must reverence me;<BR>
For not the mightiest lord of these<BR>
Can brave my will and live at ease.<BR>
Fate finds in me a mightier fate<BR>
To burn the fires that devastate.<BR>
With unresisted influence I<BR>
Can force e'en Death himself to die,<BR>
With all-surpassing might restrain<BR>
The fury of the hurricane,<BR>
And burn in my tremendous ire<BR>
The glory of the sun and fire.'<BR>

<P>
As thus the fiend's hot fury blazed,<BR>
His trembling hands Akampan raised,<BR>
And with a voice which fear made weak,<BR>
Permission craved his tale to speak.<BR>
King R&aacute;van gave the leave he sought,<BR>
And bade him tell the news he brought.<BR>
His courage rose, his voice grew bold,<BR>
And thus his mournful tale he told:<BR>

<P>
'A prince with mighty shoulders, sprung<BR>
From Das'aratha, brave and young,<BR>
With arms well moulded, bears the name<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma with a lion's frame.<BR>
Renowned, successful, dark of limb,<BR>
Earth has no warrior equals him.<BR>
He fought in Janasth&aacute;n and slew<BR>
D&uacute;shan the fierce and Khara too.'<BR>

<P>
R&aacute;van the giants' royal chief.<BR>
Received Akampan's tale of grief.<BR>
Then, panting like an angry snake,<BR>
These words in turn the monarch spake:<BR>

<P>
'Say quick, did R&aacute;ma seek the shade<BR>
Of Janasth&aacute;n with Indra's aid,<BR>
And all the dwellers in the skies<BR>
To back his hardy enterprise?'<BR>

<P>
Akampan heard, and straight obeyed<BR>
His master, and his answer made.<BR>
Then thus the power and might he told<BR>
Of Raghu's son the lofty-souled:<BR>

<P>
'Best is that chief of all who know<BR>
With deftest art to draw the bow.<BR>
His are strange arms of heavenly might,<BR>
And none can match him in the fight.<BR>
His brother Lakshman brave as he,<BR>
Fair as the rounded moon to see,<BR>
With eyes like night and voice that comes<BR>
Deep as the roll of beaten drums,<BR>
By R&aacute;ma's side stands ever near,<BR>
Like wind that aids the flame's career.<BR>
That glorious chief, that prince of kings,<BR>
On Janasth&aacute;n this ruin brings.<BR>
No Gods were there,--dismiss the thought<BR>
No heavenly legions came and fought.<BR>
His swift-winged arrows R&aacute;ma sent,<BR>
Each bright with gold and ornament.<BR>
To serpents many-faced they turned:<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The giant hosts they ate and burned.<BR>
Where'er these fled in wild dismay<BR>
R&aacute;ma was there to strike and slay.<BR>
By him O King of high estate,<BR>
Is Janasth&aacute;n left desolate.'<BR>

<P>
Akampan ceased: in angry pride<BR>
The giant monarch thus replied:<BR>
'To Janasth&aacute;n myself will go<BR>
And lay these daring brothers low.'<BR>

<P>
Thus spoke the king in furious mood;<BR>
Akampan then his speech renewed:<BR>
'O listen while I tell at length<BR>
The terror of the hero's strength.<BR>
No power can check, no might can tame<BR>
R&aacute;ma, a chief of noblest fame.<BR>
He with resistless shafts can stay<BR>
The torrent foaming on its way.<BR>
Sky, stars, and constellations, all<BR>
To his fierce might would yield and fall.<BR>
His power could earth itself uphold<BR>
Down sinking as it sank of old.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Or all its plains and cities drown,<BR>
Breaking the wild sea's barrier down;<BR>
Crush the great deep's impetuous will,<BR>
Or bid the furious wind be still.<BR>
He glorious in his high estate<BR>
The triple world could devastate,<BR>
And there, supreme of men, could place<BR>
His creatures of a new-born race.<BR>
Never can mighty R&aacute;ma be<BR>
O'vercome in fight, my King, by thee.<BR>
Thy giant host the day might win<BR>
From him, if heaven were gained by sin.<BR>
If Gods were joined with demons, they<BR>
Could ne'er, I ween, that hero slay,<BR>
But guile may kill the wondrous man;<BR>
Attend while I disclose the plan.<BR>
His wife, above all women graced,<BR>
Is S&iacute;t&aacute; of the dainty waist,<BR>
With limbs to fair proportion true,<BR>
And a soft skin of lustrous hue,<BR>
Round neck and arm rich gems are twined:<BR>
She is the gem of womankind.<BR>
With her no bright Gandharv&iacute; vies,<BR>
No nymph or Goddess in the skies;<BR>
And none to rival her would dare<BR>
'Mid dames who part the long black hair.<BR>
That hero in the wood beguile,<BR>
And steal his lovely spouse the while.<BR>
'Reft of his darling wife, be sure,<BR>
Brief days the mourner will endure.'<BR>

<P>
With flattering hope of triumph moved<BR>
The giant king that plan approved,<BR>
Pondered the counsel in his breast,<BR>
And then Akampan thus addressed:<BR>
'Forth in my car I go at morn,<BR>
None but the driver with me borne,<BR>
And this fair S&iacute;t&aacute; will I bring<BR>
Back to my city triumphing.'<BR>

<P>

<P>
Forth in his car by asses drawn<BR>
The giant monarch sped at dawn,<BR>
Bright as the sun, the chariot cast<BR>
Light through the sky as on it passed.<BR>
Then high in air that best of cars<BR>
Traversed the path of lunar stars,<BR>
Sending a fitful radiance pale<BR>
As moonbeams shot through cloudy veil.<BR>
Far on his airy way he flew:<BR>
Near T&aacute;dakeya's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_484"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> grove he drew,<BR>
M&aacute;richa welcomed him, and placed<BR>
Before him food which giants taste,<BR>
With honour led him to a seat,<BR>
And brought him water for his feet;<BR>
And then with timely words addressed<BR>
Such question to his royal guest:<BR>

<P>
'Speak, is it well with thee whose sway<BR>
The giant multitudes obey?<BR>
I know not all, and ask in fear<BR>
The cause, O King, why thou art here.'<BR>

<P>
R&aacute;van, the giants' mighty king,<BR>
Heard wise M&aacute;richa's questioning,<BR>
And told with ready answer, taught<BR>
In eloquence, the cause he sought:<BR>
'My guards, the bravest of my band.<BR>
Are slain by R&aacute;ma's vigorous hand,<BR>
And Janasth&aacute;n, that feared no hate<BR>
Of foes, is rendered desolate.<BR>
Come, aid me in the plan I lay<BR>
To steal the conqueror's wife away.'<BR>

<P>
M&aacute;richa heard the king's request,<BR>
And thus the giant chief addressed:<BR>

<P>
'What foe in friendly guise is he<BR>
Who spoke of S&iacute;t&aacute;'s name to thee?<BR>
Who is the wretch whose thought would bring<BR>
Destruction on the giants' king?<BR>
Whose is the evil counsel, say,<BR>
That bids thee bear his wife away,<BR>
And careless of thy life provoke<BR>
Earth's loftiest with threatening stroke?<BR>
A foe is he who dared suggest<BR>
This hopeless folly to thy breast,<BR>
Whose ill advice would bid thee draw<BR>
The venomed fang from serpent's jaw.<BR>
By whose unwise suggestion led<BR>
Wilt thou the path of ruin tread?<BR>
Whence falls the blow that would destroy<BR>
Thy gentle sleep of ease and joy?<BR>
Like some wild elephant is he<BR>
That rears his trunk on high,<BR>
Lord of an ancient pedigree,<BR>
Huge tusks, and furious eye.<BR>
R&aacute;van, no rover of the night<BR>
With bravest heart can brook,<BR>
Met in the front of deadly fight,<BR>
On Raghu's son to look.<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_267"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 267</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The giant hosts were brave and strong,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Good at the bow and spear:<BR>
But R&aacute;ma slew the routed throng,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A lion 'mid the deer.<BR>
No lion's tooth can match his sword,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Or arrows fiercely shot:<BR>
He sleeps, he sleeps--the lion lord;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be wise and rouse him not.<BR>
O Monarch of the giants, well<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon my counsel think,<BR>
Lest thou for ever in the hell<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of R&aacute;ma's vengeance sink:<BR>
A hell, where deadly shafts are sent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  From his tremendous-bow,<BR>
While his great arms all flight prevent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like deepest mire below:<BR>
Where the wild floods of battle rave<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Above the foeman's head,<BR>
And each with many a feathery wave<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of shafts is garlanded.<BR>
O, quench the flames that in thy breast<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With raging fury burn;<BR>
And pacified and self-possessed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To Lank&aacute;'s town return.<BR>
Rest thou in her imperial bowers<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With thine own wives content,<BR>
And in the wood let R&aacute;ma's hours<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With Sit&aacute; still be spent.'<BR>

<P>
The lord of Lank&aacute;'s isle obeyed<BR>
The counsel, and his purpose stayed.<BR>
Borne on his car he parted thence<BR>
And gained his royal residence.<BR>
