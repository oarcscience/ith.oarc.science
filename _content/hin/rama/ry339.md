### CANTO LXIV.: THE SEA.

Shouts of triumphant joy outrang  
As to their feet the Vánars sprang:  
And, on the mighty task intent,  
Swift to the sea their steps they bent.  
They stood and gazed upon the deep,  
Whose billows with a roar and leap  
On the sea banks ware wildly hurled,--  
The mirror of the mighty world.  
There on the strand the Vánars stayed  
And with sad eyes the deep surveyed,  
Here, as in play, his billows rose,  
And there he slumbered in repose.  
Here leapt the boisterous waters, high  
As mountains, menacing the sky,  
And wild infernal forms between  
The ridges of the waves were seen.

They saw the billows rave and swell,  
And their sad spirits sank and fell;  
For ocean in their deep despair  
Seemed boundless as the fields of air.  
Then noble Angad spake to cheer  
The Vánars and dispel their fear:  
'Faint not: despair should never find  
Admittance to a noble mind.  
Despair, a serpent's mortal bite,  
Benumbs the hero's power and might.'  
   Then passed the weary night, and all  
Assembled at their prince's call,  
And every lord of high estate  
Was gathered round him for debate.  
Bright was the chieftains' glorious band  
Round Angad on the ocean strand,  
As when the mighty Storm-Gods meet  
Round Indra on his golden seat.  
Then princely Angad looked on each,  
And thus began his prudent speech:  
'What chief of all our host will leap  
A hundred leagues across the deep?  
Who, O illustrious Vánars, who  
Will make Sugriva's promise true,  
And from our weight of fear set free  
The leaders of our band and me!  
To whom, O warriors, shall we owe  
A sweet release from pain and woe,  
And proud success, and happy lives  
With our dear children and our wives,  
Again permitted by his grace  
To look with joy on Ráma's face,  
And noble Lakshman, and our lord  
The king, to our sweet homes restored?'  
   Thus to the gathered lords he spoke;  
But no reply the silence broke.  
Then with a sterner voice he cried:  
'O chiefs, the nation's boast and pride,  
Whom valour strength and power adorn,  
Of most illustrious lineage born,  
Where'er you wilt you force a way,  
And none your rapid course can stay.  
Now come, your several powers declare.  
And who this desperate leap will dare?
