<P>
R&aacute;ma went foremost of the three,<BR>
Next S&iacute;t&aacute;, followed, fair to see,<BR>
And Lakshman with his bow in hand<BR>
Walked hindmost of the little band.<BR>
As onward through the wood they went,<BR>
With great delight their eyes were bent<BR>
On rocky heights beside the way<BR>
And lofty trees with blossoms gay;<BR>
And streamlets running fair and fast<BR>
The royal youths with S&iacute;t&aacute; passed.<BR>
They watched the s&aacute;ras and the drake<BR>
On islets of the stream and lake,<BR>
And gazed delighted on the floods<BR>
Bright with gay birds and lotus buds.<BR>
They saw in startled herds the roes,<BR>
The passion-frenzied buffaloes,<BR>
Wild elephants who fiercely tore<BR>
The tender trees, and many a boar.<BR>
A length of woodland way they passed,<BR>
And when the sun was low at last<BR>
A lovely stream-fed lake they spied,<BR>
Two leagues across from side to side.<BR>
Tall elephants fresh beauty gave<BR>
To grassy bank and lilied wave,<BR>

<P>
By many a swan and s&aacute;ras stirred,<BR>
Mallard, and gay-winged water-bird.<BR>
From those sweet waters, loud and long,<BR>
Though none was seen to wake the song,<BR>
Swelled high the singer's music blent<BR>
With each melodious instrument.<BR>
R&aacute;ma and car-borne Lakshman heard<BR>
The charming strain, with wonder stirred,<BR>
Turned on the margent of the lake<BR>
To Dharmabhait * &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_424"></A><A HREF="#fn_424"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the sage, and spake:<BR>
&nbsp; 'Our longing souls, O hermit, burn<BR>
This music of the lake to learn:<BR>
We pray thee, noblest sage, explain<BR>
The cause of the mysterious strain.'<BR>
He, as the son of Raghu prayed,<BR>
With swift accord his answer made,<BR>
And thus the hermit, virtuous-souled,<BR>
The story of the fair lake told:<BR>
&nbsp; 'Through every age 'tis known to fame,<BR>
Panch&aacute;psaras &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_425"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> its glorious name,<BR>
By holy M&aacute;ndakarni wrought<BR>
With power his rites austere had bought.<BR>
For he, great votarist, intent<BR>
On strictest rule his stern life spent.<BR>
Ten thousand years the stream his bed,<BR>
Ten thousand years on air he fed.<BR>
Then on the blessed Gods who dwell<BR>
In heavenly homes great terror fell:<BR>
They gathered all, by Agni led,<BR>
And counselled thus disquieted:<BR>
'The hermit by ascetic pain<BR>
The seat of one of us would gain.'<BR>
Thus with their hearts by fear oppressed<BR>
In full assembly spoke the Blest,<BR>
And bade five loveliest nymphs, as fair<BR>
As lightning in the evening air,<BR>
Armed with their winning wiles, seduce<BR>
From his stern vows the great recluse.<BR>
Though lore of earth and heaven he knew,<BR>
The hermit from his task they drew,<BR>
And made the great ascetic slave<BR>
To conquering love, the Gods to save.<BR>
Bach of the heavenly five became,<BR>
Bound to the sage, his wedded dame;<BR>
And he, for his beloved's sake,<BR>
Formed a fair palace neath the lake.<BR>
Under the flood the ladies live,<BR>
To joy and ease their days they give,<BR>
And lap in bliss the hermit wooed<BR>
From penance rites to youth renewed.<BR>
So when the sportive nymphs within<BR>
Those secret bowers their play begin,<BR>
You hear the singers' dulcet tones<BR>
Blend sweetly with their tinkling zones.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   'How wondrous are these words of thine!'<BR>
Cried the famed chiefs of Raghu's line,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
As thus they heard the sage unfold<BR>
The marvels of the tale he told.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As R&aacute;ma spake, his eyes were bent<BR>
Upon a hermit settlement<BR>
With light of heavenly lore endued,<BR>
With sacred grass and vesture strewed.<BR>
His wife and brother by his side,<BR>
Within the holy bounds he hied,<BR>
And there, with honour entertained<BR>
By all the saints, a while remained.<BR>
In time, by due succession led,<BR>
Each votary's cot he visited,<BR>
And then the lord of martial lore,<BR>
Returned where he had lodged before.<BR>
Here for the months, content, he stayed,<BR>
There for a year his visit paid:<BR>
Here for four months his home would fix,<BR>
There, as it chanced, for five or six.<BR>
Here for eight months and there for three<BR>
The son of Raghu's stay would be:<BR>
Here weeks, there fortnights, more or less,<BR>
He spent in tranquil happiness.<BR>
As there the hero dwelt at ease<BR>
Among those holy devotees,<BR>
In days untroubled o'er his head<BR>
Ten circling years of pleasure fled.<BR>
So Raghu's son in duty trained<BR>
A while in every cot remained,<BR>
Then with his dame retraced the road<BR>
To good Sut&iacute;kshna's calm abode.<BR>
Hailed by the saints with honours due<BR>
Near to the hermit's home he drew,<BR>
And there the tamer of his foes<BR>
Dwelt for a time in sweet repose.<BR>
One day within that holy wood<BR>
By saint Sut&iacute;kstma R&aacute;ma stood,<BR>
And thus the prince with reverence meek<BR>
To that high sage began to speak:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'In the wide woodlands that extend<BR>
Around us, lord most reverend,<BR>
As frequent voice of rumour tells,<BR>
Agastya, saintliest hermit, dwells.<BR>
So vast the wood, I cannot trace<BR>
The path to reach his dwelling place,<BR>
Nor, searching unassisted, find<BR>
That hermit of the thoughtful mind.<BR>
I with my wife and brother fain<BR>
Would go, his favour to obtain,<BR>
Would seek him in his lone retreat<BR>
And the great saint with reverence greet.<BR>
This one desire, O Master, long<BR>
Cherished within my heart, is strong,<BR>
That I may pay of free accord<BR>
My duty to that hermit lord.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As thus the prince whose heart was bent<BR>
On virtue told his firm intent,<BR>
The good Sut&iacute;kshna's joy rose high,<BR>
And thus in turn he made reply:<BR>
The very thing, O Prince, which thou<BR>
Hast sought, I wished to urge but now,<BR>
Bid thee with wife and brother see<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_241"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 241</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Agastya, glorious devotee.<BR>
I count this thing an omen fair<BR>
That thou shouldst thus thy wish declare,<BR>
And I, my Prince, will gladly teach<BR>
The way Agastya's home to reach.<BR>
Southward, dear son, direct thy feet<BR>
Eight leagues beyond this still retreat:<BR>
Agastya's hermit brother there<BR>
Dwells in a home most bright and fair.<BR>
'Tis on a knoll of woody ground,<BR>
With many a branching Pippal &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_426"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> crowned:<BR>
There sweet birds' voices ne'er are mute,<BR>
And trees are gay with flower and fruit.<BR>
There many a lake gleams bright and cool,<BR>
And lilies deck each pleasant pool,<BR>
While swan, and crane, and mallard's wings<BR>
Are lovely in the water-springs.<BR>
There for one night, O R&aacute;ma, stay,<BR>
And with the dawn pursue thy way.<BR>
Still farther, bending southward, by<BR>
The thicket's edge the course must lie,<BR>
And thou wilt see, two leagues from thence<BR>
Agastya's lovely residence,<BR>
Set in the woodland's fairest spot,<BR>
All varied foliage decks the cot:<BR>
There Si'ta', Lakshman thou, at ease<BR>
May spend sweet hours neath shady trees,<BR>
For all of noblest growth are found<BR>
Luxuriant on that *bosky ground,<BR>
If it be still thy firm intent<BR>
To see that saint pree*minent,<BR>
O mighty counsellor, this day<BR>
Depart upon thine onward way.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hermit spake, and R&aacute;ma bent<BR>
His head, with Lakshman, reverent,<BR>
And then with him and Janak's child<BR>
Set out to trace the forest wild.<BR>
He saw dark woods that fringed the road,<BR>
And distant hills like clouds that showed,<BR>
And, as the way he followed, met<BR>
With many a lake and rivulet.<BR>
So passing on with ease where led<BR>
The path Sutikshna bade him tread,<BR>
The hero with exulting breast<BR>
His brother in these words addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Here, surely, is the home, in sight,<BR>
Of that illustrious anchorite:<BR>
Here great Agastya's brother leads<BR>
A life intent on holy deeds.<BR>
Warned of each guiding mark and sign,<BR>
I see them all herein combine:<BR>
I see the branches bending low<BR>
Beneath the flowers and fruit they show.<BR>
A soft air from the forest springs,<BR>
Fresh from the odorous grass, and brings<BR>
A spicy fragrance as it flees<BR>
O'er the ripe fruit of Pippal trees.<BR>
See, here and there around us high<BR>
Piled up in heaps cleft billets lie,<BR>

<P>

<P>
And holy grass is gathered, bright<BR>
As strips of shining lazulite.<BR>
Full in the centre of the shade<BR>
The hermits' holy fire is laid:<BR>
I see its smoke the pure heaven streak<BR>
Dense as a big cloud's dusky peak.<BR>
The twice-born men their steps retrace<BR>
From each sequestered bathing place,<BR>
And each his sacred gift has brought<BR>
Of blossoms which his hands have sought.<BR>
Of all these signs, dear brother, each<BR>
Agrees with good Sutikshna's speech,<BR>
And doubtless in this holy bound<BR>
Agastya's brother will be found.<BR>
Agastya once, the worlds who viewed<BR>
With love, a Deathlike fiend subdued,<BR>
And armed with mighty power, obtained<BR>
By holy works, this grove ordained<BR>
To be a refuge and defence<BR>
From all oppressors' violence.<BR>
In days of yore within this place<BR>
Two brothers fierce of demon race,<BR>
Va'ta'pi* dire and Ilval, dwelt,<BR>
And slaughter mid the Bra'hmans dealt.<BR>
A Bra'hman's form, the fiend to cloak,<BR>
Fierce Ilval wore, and Sanskrit spoke,<BR>
And twice-born sages would invite<BR>
To solemnize some funeral rite.<BR>
His brother's flesh, concealed within<BR>
A ram's false shape and borrowed skin,--<BR>
As men are wont at funeral feasts,--<BR>
He dressed and fed those gathered priests.<BR>
The holy men, unweeting ill,<BR>
Took of the food and ate their fill.<BR>
Then Ilval with a mighty shout<BR>
Exclaimed 'Vatapi, issue out.'<BR>
Soon as his brother's voice he heard,<BR>
The fiend with ram-like bleating stirred:<BR>
Bending in pieces every frame,<BR>
Forth from the dying priests he came.<BR>
So they who changed their forms at will<BR>
Thousands of Brahmans dared to kill,-<BR>
Fierce fiends who loved each cruel deed,<BR>
And joyed on bleeding flesh to feed.<BR>
Agastya, mighty hermit, pressed<BR>
To funeral banquet like the rest,<BR>
Obedient to the Gods' appeal<BR>
Ate up the monster at a meal.<BR>
'Tis done,'tis done,' fierce Ilval cried,<BR>
And water for his hands supplied:<BR>
Then lifting up his voice he spake:<BR>
'Forth, brother, from thy prison break.'<BR>
Then him who called the fiend, who long<BR>
Had wrought the suffering Bra'hmans wrong,<BR>
Thus thoughtful-souled Agastya, best<BR>
Of hermits, with a smile addresed:<BR>
'How, Ra'kshas, is the fiend empowered<BR>
To issue forth whom I devoured?<BR>
Thy brother in a ram's disguise-<BR>
Is gone where Yama's kingdom lies.'<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_242"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 242</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
When from the words Agastya said<BR>
He knew his brother fiend was dead,<BR>
His soul on fire with vengeful rage,<BR>
Rushed the night-rover at the sage.<BR>
One lightning glance of fury, hot<BR>
As fire, the glorious hermit shot,<BR>
As the fiend neared him in his stride,<BR>
And straight, consumed to dust, he died.<BR>
In pity for the Brahmans' plight<BR>
Agastya wrought this deed of might:<BR>
This grove which lakes and fair trees grace<BR>
In his great brother's dwelling place.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As R&aacute;ma thus the tale rehearsed,<BR>
And with Sumitr&aacute;'s son conversed,<BR>
The setting sun his last rays shed,<BR>
And evening o'er the land was spread.<BR>
A while the princely brothers stayed<BR>
And even rites in order paid,<BR>
Then to the holy grove they drew<BR>
And hailed the saint with honour due.<BR>
With courtesy was Rama met<BR>
By that illustrious anchoret,<BR>
And for one night he rested there<BR>
Regaled with fruit and hermit fare.<BR>
But when the night had reached its close,<BR>
And the sun's glorious circle rose,<BR>
The son of Raghu left his bed<BR>
And to the hermit's brother said:<BR>
'Well rested in thy hermit cell,<BR>
I stand, O saint, to bid farewell;<BR>
For with thy leave I journey hence<BR>
Thy broher saint to reverence.'<BR>
'Go, R&aacute;ma go,' the sage replied:<BR>
Then from the cot the chieftain hied.<BR>
And while the pleasant grove he viewed,<BR>
The path the hermit showed, pursued.<BR>
Of every leaf, of changing hue.<BR>
Plants, trees by hundreds round him grew,<BR>
With joyous eyes he looked on all,<BR>
Then Jak, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_427"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the wild rice, and Sal;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
He saw the red Hibiscus glow,<BR>
He saw the flower-tipped creeper throw<BR>
The glory of her clusters o'er<BR>
Tall trees that loads of blossom bore.<BR>
Some, elephants had prostrate laid,<BR>
In some the monkeys leapt and played,<BR>
And through the whole wide forest rang<BR>
The charm of gay birds as they sang.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma of the lotus eye<BR>
To Lakshman turned who followed nigh,<BR>
And thus the hero youth impressed<BR>
With Fortune's favouring signs, addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'How soft the leaves of every tree,<BR>
How tame each bird and beast we see!<BR>
Soon the fair home shall we behold<BR>
Of that great hermit tranquil-souled.<BR>
The deed the good Agastya wrought<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
High fame throughout the world has bought:<BR>
I see, I see his calm retreat<BR>
That balms the pain of weary feet.<BR>
Where white clouds rise from flames beneath,<BR>
Where bark-coats lie with many a wreath,<BR>
Where silvan things, made gentle, throng,<BR>
And every bird is loud in song.<BR>
With ruth for suffering creatures filled,<BR>
A deathlike fiend with might he killed,<BR>
And gave this southern realm to be<BR>
A refuge, from oppression free.<BR>
There stands his home, whose dreaded might<BR>
Has put the giant crew to flight,<BR>
Who view with envious eyes afar<BR>
The peaceful shades they cannot mar.<BR>
Since that most holy saint has made<BR>
His dwelling in this lovely shade,<BR>
Checked by his might the giant brood<BR>
Have dwelt in peace with souls subdued.<BR>
And all this southern realm, within<BR>
Whose bounds no fiend may entrance win,<BR>
Now bears a name which naught may dim,<BR>
Made glorious through the worlds by him.<BR>
When Vindhya, best of hills, would stay<BR>
The journey of the Lord of Day,<BR>
Obedient to the saint's behest<BR>
He bowed for aye his humbled crest.<BR>
That hoary hermit, world-renowned<BR>
For holy deeds, within this ground<BR>
Has set his pure and blessed home,<BR>
Where gentle silvan creatures roam.<BR>
Agastya, whom the worlds revere,<BR>
Pure saint to whom the good are dear,<BR>
To us his guests all grace will show,<BR>
Enriched with blessings ere we go.<BR>
I to this aim each thought will turn,<BR>
The favour of the saint to earn,<BR>
That here in comfort may be spent<BR>
The last years of our banishment.<BR>
Here sanctities and high saints stand,<BR>
Gods, minstrels of the heavenly band;<BR>
Upon Agastya's will they wait,<BR>
And serve him, pure and temperate.<BR>
The liar's tongue, the tyrant's mind<BR>
Within these bounds no home may find:<BR>
No cheat, no sinner here can be:<BR>
So holy and so good is he.<BR>
Here birds and lords of serpent race,<BR>
Spirits and Gods who haunt the place,<BR>
Content with scanty fare remain,<BR>
As merit's meed they strive to gain.<BR>
Made perfect here, the paints supreme,<BR>
On cars that mock the Day-God's gleam,--<BR>
Their mortal bodies cast aside,--<BR>
Sought heaven transformed and glorified,<BR>
Here Gods to living things, who win<BR>
Their favour, pure from cruel sin,<BR>
Give royal rule and many a good,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_243"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 243</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Immortal life and spirithood. I<BR>
Now, Lakshman, we are near the place:<BR>
Do thou precede a little space,<BR>
And tell the mighty saint that I<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; at my side am nigh,"<BR>
