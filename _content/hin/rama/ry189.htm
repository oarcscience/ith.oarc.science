<P>
Thus said Vas'ishtha, and again.<BR>
To R&aacute;ma spake in duteous strain:<BR>
' All men the light of life who see<BR>
With high respect should look on three:<BR>
High honour ne'er must be denied<BR>
To father, mother, holy guide.<BR>
First to their sires their birth they owe,<BR>
Nursed with maternal love they grow:<BR>
Their holy guides fair knowledge teach:<BR>
So men should love and honour each.<BR>
Thy sire and thou have learned of me,<BR>
The sacred guide of him and thee,<BR>
And if my word thou wilt obey<BR>
Thou still* wilt keep the virtuous way.<BR>
See, with the chiefs of every guild<BR>
And all thy friends, this place is filled:<BR>
All these, as duty bids, protect;<BR>
So still the righteous path respect.<BR>
O, for thine aged mother feel,<BR>
Nor spurn the virtuous dame's appeal:<BR>
Obey, O Prince, thy mother dear,<BR>
And still to virtue's path adhere.<BR>
Yield thou to Bharat's fond request,<BR>
With earnest supplication pressed,<BR>
So wilt thou to thyself be true,<BR>
And faith and duty still pursue.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus by his saintly guide addressed<BR>
With pleas in sweetest tones expressed.<BR>
The lord of men in turn replied<BR>
To wise Vas'ishtha by his side:<BR>
'The fondest son's observance ne'er<BR>
Repays the sire and mother's care:<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The constant love that food provides.<BR>
And dress, and every need besides:<BR>
Their pleasant words still soft and mild,<BR>
Their nurture of the helpless child:<BR>
The words which Das'aratha spake,<BR>
My king and sire, I ne'er will break.'<BR>

<P>
Then Bharat of the ample chest<BR>
The wise Sumantra thus addressed;<BR>
'Bring sacred grass, O charioteer,<BR>
And strew it on the level here.<BR>
For I will sit and watch his face<BR>
Until I win my brother's grace.<BR>
Like a robbed Br&aacute;hman will I lie, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_393"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Nor taste of food nor turn my eye,<BR>
In front of R&aacute;ma's leafy cot,<BR>
And till he yield will leave him not.'<BR>

<P>
When Bharat saw Sumantra's eye<BR>
Looked up to R&aacute;ma for reply,<BR>
The Prince himself in eager haste<BR>
The sacred grass in order placed.<BR>
Him great and mighty R&aacute;ma, best<BR>
Of royal saints, in turn addressed:<BR>
'What, Bharat, have I done, that thou<BR>
Besiegest me, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_394"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> a suppliant now?<BR>
Thus streched, to force redress for wrongs<BR>
To men of Br&aacute;hman birth belongs,<BR>
Not those upon whose kingly head<BR>
The consecrating drops are shed.<BR>
Up, lord of men! arise, and quit<BR>
This fearful vow for thee unfit.<BR>
Go, brother, seek Ayodhy&aacute;'s town,<BR>
Fair city ot supreme renown.'<BR>

<P>
But Bharat, as his seat he took.<BR>
Cast all around an eager look:<BR>
'O people, join your prayers with mine,<BR>
And so his stubborn heart incline.'<BR>

<P>
And all the people answered thus:<BR>
'Full well is R&aacute;ma known to us.<BR>
Right is the word he speaks and he<BR>
Is faithful to his sire's decree:<BR>
Nor can we rushly venture now<BR>
To turn him from his purposed vow.'<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma spoke: 'O Bharat, heed<BR>
Thy virtuous friends, and mark their rede.<BR>
Mark well what I and these advise,<BR>
And duty view with clearer eyes.<BR>
Thy hand on mine, O hero, place,<BR>
Touch water, and thy sin efface.'<BR>

<P>
Then Bharat rose: his hand he dipped,<BR>
And purifying water sipped:<BR>
'Each citizen,' he cried, 'give ear,<BR>
Attend, each counsellor and peer.<BR>
My mother planned, by me untaught,<BR>
To win the sway I never sought:<BR>


<P>

<P>


<P>
Ne'er Raghu's son could I despise,<BR>
In duty's lore supremely wise.<BR>
Now if obedience to our sire<BR>
This dwelling in the woods require,<BR>
I, till the destined years he spent,<BR>
Will dwell alone in banishment.'<BR>

<P>
The virtuous R&aacute;ma, wonder-stirred.<BR>
The faithful speech of Bharat heard,<BR>
And thus the hero's feelings found<BR>
Due utterance, as he gazed around:<BR>

<P>
'Still to my father's word I hold,<BR>
Whate'er he bought, or pledged, or sold:<BR>
Ne'er shall his living promise be<BR>
Annulled by Bharat or by me.<BR>
Not thus my task will I evade,<BR>
My exile on another laid:<BR>
Most wise was Queen Kaikey&iacute;'s rede,<BR>
And just and good my father's deed.<BR>
Dear Bharat's patient soul I know,<BR>
How reverence due he loves to show;<BR>
In him, high-souled and faithful found,<BR>
Must each auspicious grace abound.<BR>
When from the woods I turn again<BR>
I with his aid shall nobly reign,<BR>
With one so good, of peerless worth,<BR>
A glorious lord of happy earth.<BR>
Her boon Kaikey&iacute; sought and won.<BR>
I, as my father swore, have done:<BR>
And O, do thou, my brother dear,<BR>
The monarch's name from falsehood clear.<BR>
