### CANTO LXXIII.: THE NUPTIALS.

On that same day that saw the king  
His gift of kine distributing,  
The lord of Kekaya's son, by name  
Yudhájit, Bharat's uncle, came,  
Asked of the monarch's health, and then  
Addressed the reverend king of men:  
'The lord of Kekaya's realm by me  
Sends greeting, noble King, to thee:  
Asks if the friends thy prayers would bless  
Uninterrupted health possess.  
Right anxious, mighty King, is he  
My sister's princely boy to see.  
For this I sought Ayodhyá fair  
The message of my sire to bear.  
There learning, O my liege, that thou  
With sons and noble kinsmen now  
Wast resting here, I sought the place  
Longing to see my nephew's face.'  
The king with kind observance cheered  
His friend by tender ties endeared,  
And every choicest honour pressed  
Upon his honourable guest.  

That night with all his children spent,  
At morn King Das'aratha went,  
Behind Vas'ishtha and the rest,  
To the fair ground for rites addressed.  
Then when the lucky hour was nigh  
Called Victory, of omen high,  
Came Ráma, after vow and prayer  
For nuptial bliss and fortune fair,  
With the three youths in bright attire,  
And stood beside his royal sire.  
To Janak then Vas'ishtha sped,  
And to Videha's monarch said:  
'O King, Ayodhyá's ruler now  
Has breathed the prayer and vowed the vow,  
And with his sons expecting stands  
The giver of the maidens' hands.  
The giver and the taker both  
Must ratify a mutual oath.  
Perform the part for which we wait,  
And rites of marriage celebrate.'  

Skilled in the laws which Scriptures teach,  
He answered thus Vas'ishtha's speech:  
'O Saint, what warder bars the gate?  
Whose bidding can the king await?  
In one's own house what doubt is shown?  
This kingdom, Sage, is all thine own.  
E'en now the maidens may he found  
Within the sacrificial ground:  
Each vow is vowed and prayed each prayer,  
And they, like fire, are shining there.  
Here by the shrine my place I took  
Expecting thee with eager look.  
No bar the nuptial rites should stay:  
What cause have we for more delay?'  
When Janak's speech the monarch heard  
To sons and saints he gave the word,  
And set them in the holy ring.  
Then to Vas'ishtha spoke the king  
Of Mithilá: 'O mighty Sage,  
Now let this task thy care engage,  
And lend thine aid and counsel wise  
The nuptial rites to solemnize.'  

The saint Vas'ishtha gave assent,  
And quickly to the task he went.  
With Vis'vámitra, nothing both,  
And S'atánanda aiding both.  
Then, as the rules prescribe, they made  
An altar in the midst, and laid  
Fresh wreaths of fragrant flowers thereon.  
The golden ladles round it shone;  
And many a vase, which branches hid  
Fixed in the perforated lid,  
And sprays, and cups, and censers there  
Stood filled with incense rich and rare;  
Shell-bowls,and spoons, and salvers dressed  
With gifts that greet the honoured guest;  
Piles of parched rice some dishes bore,  
Others with corn prepared ran o'er;  
And holy grass was duly spread  
In equal lengths, while prayers were said.  
Next chief of saints, Vas'ishtha came  
And laid the offering in the flame.  
Then by the hand King Janak drew  
His Sítá, beautiful to view,  
And placed her, bright in rich attire,  
Ráma to face, before the fire,  
Thus speaking to the royal boy  
Who filled Kaus'alyá's heart with joy:  
'Here Sítá stands, my daughter fair,  
The duties of thy life to share.  
Take from her father, take thy bride,  
Join hand to hand, and bliss betide!  
A faithful wife, most blest is she,  
And as thy shade will follow thee.'  

Thus as he spoke the monarch threw  
O'er her young limbs the holy dew,  
While Gods and saints were heard to swell  
The joyous cry, 'Tis well! 'Tis well!  
His daughter Sítá thus bestowed,  
O'er whom the sacred drops had flowed.  
King Janak's heart with rapture glowed.  
Then to Prince Lakshman thus he cried'.  
'Take Urmilá thine offered bride,  
And clasp her hand within thine own  
Ere yet the lucky hour be flown.'  
Then to Prince Bharat thus cried he;  
'Come, take the hand of Mándavi.'  
Then to S'atrughna: 'In thy grasp  
The hand of S'rutakirti clasp.  
Now, Raghu's sons, may all of you  
Be gentle to your wives and true;  

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>  

Keep well the vows you make to-day,  
Nor let occasion slip away.'  

King Janak's word the youths obeyed;  
The maidens' hands in theirs they laid.  
Then with their brides the princes went  
With ordered steps and reverent  
Bound both the tire and Janak, round  
The sages and the sacred ground.  

A flowery flood of lucid dyes  
In rain descended from the skies,  
While with celestial voices blent  
Sweet strains from many an instrument,  
And the nymphs danced in joyous throng  
Responsive to the minstrel's song.  
Such signs of exultation they  
Saw on the princes' wedding day.  
Still rang the heavenly music's sound  
When Raghu's sons thrice circled round  
The fire, each one with reverent head,  
And homeward then their brides they led.  
They to the sumptuous palace hied  
That Janak's care had seen supplied.  
The monarch girt with saint and peer  
Still fondly gazing followed near.
