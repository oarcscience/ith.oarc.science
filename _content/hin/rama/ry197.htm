<P>
When Anas&uacute;y&aacute;, virtuous-souled,<BR>
Had heard the tale by S&iacute;t&aacute; told,<BR>
She kissed the lady's brow and laced<BR>
Her loving arms around her waist.<BR>
'With sweet-toned words distinct and clear<BR>
Thy pleasant tale has charmed mine ear,<BR>
How the great king thy father held<BR>
That Maiden's Choice unparalleled.<BR>
But now the sun has sunk from sight,<BR>
And left the world to holy Night.<BR>
Hark! how the leafy thickets sound<BR>
With gathering birds that twitter round:<BR>
They sought their food by day, and all<BR>
Flock homeward when the shadows fall.<BR>
See, hither comes the hermit band,<BR>
Each with his pitcher in his hand:<BR>
Fresh from the bath, their locks are wet,<BR>
Their coats of bark are dripping yet.<BR>
Here saints their fires of worship tend,<BR>
And curling wreaths of smoke ascend:<BR>
Borne on the flames they mount above,<BR>
Dark as the brown wings of the dove.<BR>
The distant trees, though well-nigh bare,<BR>
Gloom thickenend by the evening air,<BR>
And in the faint uncertain light<BR>
Shut the horizon from our sight.<BR>
The beasts that prowl in darkness rove<BR>
On every side about the grove,<BR>
And the tame deer, at ease reclined<BR>
Their shelter near the altars find.<BR>
The night o'er all the sky is spread,<BR>
With lunar stars engarlanded,<BR>
And risen in his robes of light<BR>
The moon is beautifully bright,<BR>
Now to thy lord I bid thee go:<BR>
Thy pleasant tale has charmed me so:<BR>
One thing alone I needs must pray,<BR>
Before me first thyself array:<BR>
Here in thy heavenly raiment shine,<BR>
And glad, dear love, these eyes of mine.'<BR>

<P>
Then like a heavenly Goddess shone<BR>
Fair S&iacute;t&aacute; with that raiment on.<BR>
She bowed her to the matron's feet,<BR>
Then turned away her lord to meet.<BR>
The hero prince with joy surveyed<BR>
His S&iacute;t&aacute;, in her robes arrayed,<BR>
As glorious to his arms she came<BR>
With love-gifts of the saintly dame.<BR>
She told him how the saint to show<BR>
Her fond affection would bestow<BR>
That garland of celestial twine,<BR>
Those ornaments and robes divine.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma's heart, nor Lakshman's less,<BR>
Was filled with pride and happiness,<BR>
For honours high had S&iacute;t&aacute; gained,<BR>
Which mortal dames have scarce obtained.<BR>
There honoured by each pious sage<BR>
Who dwelt within the hermitage,<BR>
Beside his darling well content<BR>
That sacred night the hero spent.<BR>

<P>
The princes, when the night had fled,<BR>
Farewell to all the hermits said,<BR>
Who gazed upon the distant shade,<BR>
Their lustral rites and offerings paid.<BR>
The saints who made their dwelling there<BR>
In words like these addressed the pair:<BR>
'O Princes, monsters fierce and fell<BR>
Around that distant forest dwell:<BR>
On blood from human veins they feed,<BR>
And various forms assume at need,<BR>
With savage beasts of fearful power<BR>
That human flesh and blood devour.<BR>
Our holy saints they rend and tear<BR>
When met alone or unaware,<BR>
And eat them in their cruel joy:<BR>
These chase, O R&aacute;ma, or destroy.<BR>
By this one path our hermits go<BR>
To fetch the fruits that yonder grow:<BR>
By this, O Prince, thy feet should stray<BR>
Through pathless forests far away.'<BR>

<P>
Thus by the reverent saints addressed,<BR>
And by their prayers auspicious blessed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He left the holy crowd:<BR>
His wife and brother by his side,<BR>
Within the mighty wood he hied.<BR>
So sinks the Day-God in his pride<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Beneath a bank of cloud.<BR>
