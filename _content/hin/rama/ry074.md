### CANTO LXXIV.: RÁMA WITH THE AXE. <span id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_254)

Soon as the night had reached its close  
The hermit Vis'vámitra rose;  
To both the kings he bade adieu  
And to the northern hill withdrew.  
Ayodhyá's lord of high renown  
Received farewell, and sought his town.  
Then as each daughter left her bower  
King Janak gave a splendid dower,  
Bugs, precious silks, a warrior force,  
Cars, elephants, and foot, and horse,  
Divine to see and well arrayed;  
And many a skilful tiring-maid,  
And many a young and trusty slave  
The father of the ladies gave.  
Silver and coral, gold and pearls  
He gave to his beloved girls.  
These precious gifts the king bestowed  
And sped his guest upon his road.  
The lord of Mithilá's sweet town  
Rode to his court and lighted down.  

Ayodhyá's monarch, glad and gay,  
Led by the seers pursued his way  
With his dear sons of lofty mind:  
The royal army marched behind.  
As on he fared the voice he heard  
Around of many a dismal bird,  
And every beast in wild affright  
Began to hurry to the right.  
The monarch to Vas'ishtha cried:  
'What strange misfortune will betide?  
Why do the beasts in terror fly,  
And birds of evil omen cry?  
What is it shakes my heart with dread?  
Why is my soul disquieted?'  

Soon as he heard, the mighty saint  
Thus answered Das'aratha's plaint  
In sweetest tone: 'Now, Monarch, mark,  
And learn from me the meaning dark.  
The voices of the birds of air  
Great peril to the host declare:  
The moving beasts the dread allay,  
So drive thy whelming fear away,'  

As he and Das'aratha spoke  
A tempest from the welkin broke,  
That shook the spacious earth amain  
And hurled high trees upon the plain.  
The sun grew dark with murky cloud,  
And o'er the skies was cast a shroud,  
While o'er the army, faint with dread,  
A veil of dust and ashes spread.  
King, princes, saints their sense retained,  
Fear-stupefied the rest remained.  
At length, their wits returning, all  
Beneath the gloom and ashy pall  
Saw Jamadagni's son with dread,  
His long hair twisted round his head,  
Who, sprung from Bhrigu, loved to beat  
The proudest kings beneath his feet.  
Firm as Kailása's hill he showed,  
Fierce as the fire of doom he glowed.  
His axe upon his shoulder lay,  
His bow was ready for the fray,  
With thirsty arrows wont to fly  
Like Lightnings from the angry sky.  
A long keen arrow forth he drew,  
Invincible like those which flew  
From S'iva's ever-conquering bow  
And Tripurá in death laid low.  

When his wild form, that struck with awe,  
Fearful as ravening flame, they saw,  
Vas'ishtha and the saints whose care  
Was sacrifice and muttered prayer,  
Drew close together, each to each,  
And questioned thus with bated speech:  
'Indignant at his father's fate  
Will he on warriors vent his hate,  
The slayers of his father slay,  
And sweep the loathed race away?  
But when of old his fury raged  
Seas of their blood his wrath assuaged:  

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>  

So doubtless now he has not planned  
To slay all warriors in the land.'  

Then with a gift the saints drew near  
To Bhrigu's son whose look was fear,  
And Ráma! Ráma! soft they cried.  
The gift he took, no word replied.  
Then Bhrigu's son his silence broke  
And thus to Ráma Ráma spoke:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_254"></span>[85:1](ry074.htm#fr_254) This is another Ráma,
son of Jamadagni, called Paras'uráma, or Ráma with the axe, from the
weapon which he carried. He was while he lived the terror ot the Warrior
caste, and his name recalls long and fierce struggles between the
sacerdotal and military order in which tne latter suffered severely at
the hands of their implacable enemy.
