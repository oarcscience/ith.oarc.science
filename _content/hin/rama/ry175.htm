<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XCVII.: LAKSHMAN'S ANGER.</H3>
<P>
Thus R&aacute;ma showed his love the rill<BR>
Whose waters ran beneath the hill,<BR>
Then resting on his mountain seat<BR>
Refreshed her with the choicest meat.<BR>
So there reposed the happy two:<BR>
Then Bharat's army nearer drew:<BR>
Rose to the skies a dusty cloud,<BR>
The sound of trampling feet was loud.<BR>
The swelling roar of marching men<BR>
Drove the roused tiger from his den,<BR>
And scared amain the serpent race<BR>
Flying to hole and hiding-place.<BR>
The herds of deer in terror fled,<BR>
The air was filled with birds o'erhead,<BR>
The bear began to leave his tree,<BR>
The monkey to the cave to flee.<BR>
Wild elephants were all amazed<BR>
As though the wood around them blazed.<BR>
The lion oped his ponderous jaw,<BR>
The buffalo looked round in awe.<BR>
The prince, who heard the deafening sound.<BR>
And saw the silvan creatures round<BR>
Fly wildly startled from their rest,<BR>
The glorious Lakshman thus addressed:<BR>
'Sumitr&aacute;'s noble son most dear,<BR>
Hark, Lakshman, what a roar I hear,<BR>
The tumult of a coming crowd.<BR>
Appalling, deafening, deep, and loud!<BR>
The din that yet more fearful grows<BR>
Scares elephants and buffaloes,<BR>
Or frightened by the lions, deer<BR>
Are flying through the wood in fear.<BR>
I fain would know who seeks this place:<BR>
Comes prince or monarch for the chase?<BR>
Or does some mighty beast of prey<BR>
Frighten the silvan herds away?<BR>
Tis hard to reach this mountain height,<BR>
Yea, e'en for birds in airy flight.<BR>
Then fain, O Lakshman, would I know<BR>
What cause disturbs the forest so.'<BR>

<P>
Lakshman in haste, the wood to view.<BR>
Climbed a high S&aacute;l that near him grew,<BR>
The forest all around he eyed,<BR>
First gazing on the eastern side.<BR>
Then northward when his eyes he bent<BR>
He saw a mighty armament<BR>
Of elephants, and cars, and horse,<BR>
And men on foot, a mingled force,<BR>
And banners waving in the breeze,<BR>
And spoke to R&aacute;ma words like these:<BR>
'Quick, quick, my lord, put out the fire,<BR>
Let S&iacute;t&aacute; to the cave retire.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Thy coat of mail around thee throw,<BR>
Prepare thine arrows and thy bow.'<BR>

<P>
In eager haste thus Lakshman cried,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, lion lord, replied:<BR>
'Still closer be the army scanned,<BR>
And say who leads the warlike band.'<BR>
Lakshman his answer thus returned,<BR>
As furious rage within him burned,<BR>
Exciting him like kindled fire<BR>
To scorch the army in his ire:<BR>
'Tis Bharat: be has made the throne<BR>
By consecrating rites his own:<BR>
To gain the whole dominion thus<BR>
He comes in arms to slaughter us.<BR>
I mark tree-high upon his car<BR>
His flagstaff of the Kov&iacute;d&aacute;r, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
I see his glittering banner glance,<BR>
I see his chivalry advance:<BR>
I see his eager warriors shine<BR>
On elephants in lengthened line.<BR>
Now grasp we each the shafts and bow,<BR>
And higher up the mountain go.<BR>
Or in this place, O hero, stand<BR>
With weapons in each ready hand.<BR>
Perhaps beneath our might may fall<BR>
This leader of the standard tall,<BR>
And Bharat I this day may see<BR>
Who brought this mighty woe on thee,<BR>
S&iacute;t&aacute;, and me, who drove away<BR>
My brother from the royal sway.<BR>
Bharat our foe at length is nigh,<BR>
And by this hand shall surely die:<BR>
Brother, I see no sin at all<BR>
If Bharat by my weapon fall.<BR>
No fault is his who slays the foe<BR>
Whose hand was first to strike the blow:<BR>
With Bharat now the crime begins<BR>
Who against thee and duty sins.<BR>
The queen athirst for royal sway<BR>
Will see her darling son to-day<BR>
Fall by this hand, like some fair tree<BR>
Struck by an elephant, slain by me.<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;'s self shall perish too<BR>
With kith and kin and retinue,<BR>
And earth by my avenging deed<BR>
Shall from this mass of sin be freed.<BR>
This day my wrath, too long restrained,<BR>
Shall fall upon the foe, unchained,<BR>
Mad as the kindled flame that speeds<BR>
Destroying through the grass and reeds.<BR>
This day mine arrows keen and fierce<BR>
The bodies of the foe shall pierce;<BR>
The woods on Chitrak&uacute;ta's side<BR>
Shall run with torrents crimson-dyed.<BR>
The wandering beasts of prey shall feed<BR>
On heart-cleft elephant and steed,<BR>
And drag to mountain caves away<BR>
The bodies that my arrows slay.<BR>
Doubt not that Bharat and his train<BR>


<P>


<P>
Shall in this mighty wood be slain:<BR>
So shall I pay the debt my bow<BR>
And these my deadly arrows owe.<BR>
