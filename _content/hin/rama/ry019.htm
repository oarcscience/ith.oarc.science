<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XVII.: RISHYAS'RING'S RETURN.</H3>
<P>
Now when the high-souled monarch's rite,<BR>
The As'vamedh, was finished quite,<BR>
Their sacrificial dues obtained,<BR>
The Gods their heavenly homes regained.<BR>
The lofty-minded saints withdrew,<BR>
Each to his place, with honour due,<BR>
And kings and chieftains, one and all,<BR>
Who came to grace the festival.<BR>
And Das'aratha, ere they went,<BR>
Addressed them thus benevolent:<BR>
'Now may you, each with joyful heart,<BR>
To your own realms, O Kings, depart.<BR>
Peace and good luck attend you there,<BR>
And blessing, is my friendly prayer;<BR>
Let cares of state each mind engage<BR>
To guard his royal heritage.<BR>
A monarch from his throne expelled<BR>
No better than the dead is held.<BR>


<P>

<P>
So he who cares for power and might<BR>
Must guard his realm and royal right.<BR>
Such care a meed in heaven will bring<BR>
Better than rites and offering.<BR>
Such care a king his country owes<BR>
As man upon himself bestows,<BR>
When for his body he provides<BR>
Raiment and every need besides.<BR>
For future days should kings foresee,<BR>
And keep the present error-free.<BR>

<P>
Thus did the king the kings exhort:<BR>
They heard, and turned them from the court<BR>
And, each to each in friendship bound,<BR>
Went forth to all the realms around.<BR>
The rites were o'er, the guests were sped:<BR>
The train the best of Br&aacute;hmans led,<BR>
In which the king with joyful soul,<BR>
With his dear wives, and with the whole<BR>
Of his imperial host and train<BR>
Of cars and servants turned again,<BR>
And, as a monarch dear to fame,<BR>
Within his royal city came.<BR>

<P>
Next, Rishyas'ring, well-honoured sage,<BR>
And S'&aacute;nt&aacute;, sought their hermitage.<BR>
The king himself, of prudent mind,<BR>
Attended him, with troops behind.<BR>
And all her men the town outpoured<BR>
With Saint Vas'ishtha and their lord.<BR>
High mounted on a car of state,<BR>
O'ercanopied fair S'&aacute;nt&aacute; sate,<BR>
Drawn by white oxen, while a band<BR>
Of servants marched on either hand.<BR>
Great gifts of countless price she bore,<BR>
With sheep and goats and gems in shore.<BR>
Like Beauty's self the lady shone<BR>
With all the jewels she had on,<BR>
As, happy in her sweet content.<BR>
Peerless amid the fair she went.<BR>
Not Queen Paulom&iacute;'s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> self could be<BR>
More loving to her lord than she.<BR>
She who had lived in happy ease,<BR>
Honoured with all her heart could please,<BR>
While dames and kinsfolk ever vied<BR>
To see her wishes gratified,<BR>
Soon as she knew her husband's will<BR>
Again to seek the forest, still<BR>
Was ready for the hermit's cot,<BR>
Nor murmured at her altered lot.<BR>
The king attended to the wild<BR>
That hermit and his own dear child,<BR>
And in the centre of a throng<BR>
Of noble courtiers rode along.<BR>
The sage's son had let prepare<BR>
A lodge within the wood, and there<BR>
While they lingered blithe and gay.<BR>
Then, duly honoured, went their way.<BR>
The glorious hermit Rishyas'ring<BR>
Drew near and thus besought the king:<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_30"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 30</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
'Return, my honoured lord, I pray,<BR>
Return, upon thy homeward way.'<BR>
The monarch, with the waiting crowd,<BR>
Lifted his voice and wept aloud,<BR>
And with eyes dripping still to each<BR>
Of his good queens he spake this speech:<BR>

<P>
'Kaus'aly&aacute; and Sumitr&aacute; dear,<BR>
And thou, my sweet Kaikey&iacute;, hear.<BR>
All upon S'&aacute;nt&aacute; feast your gaze,<BR>
The last time for a length of days.'<BR>
To S'&aacute;nt&aacute;'s arms the ladies leapt,<BR>
And hung about her neck and wept,<BR>
And cried, '0, happy be the life<BR>
Of this great Br&aacute;hman and his wife.<BR>
The Wind, the Fire, the Moon on high.<BR>
The Earth, the Streams, the circling sky,<BR>
Preserve thee in the wood, true spouse,<BR>
Devoted to thy husband's vows.<BR>
And O dear S'&aacute;nt&aacute;, ne'er neglect<BR>
To pay the dues of meek respect<BR>
To the great saint, thy husband's sire,<BR>
With all observance and with fire.<BR>
And, sweet one, pure of spot and blame,<BR>
Forget not thou thy husband's claim;<BR>
In every change, in good and ill,<BR>
Let thy sweet words delight him still,<BR>
And let thy worship constant be:<BR>
Her lord is woman's deity.<BR>
To learn thy welfare, dearest friend,<BR>
The king will many a Br&aacute;hman send.<BR>
Let happy thoughts thy spirit cheer.<BR>
And be not troubled, daughter dear.'<BR>


<P>
These soothing words the ladies said.<BR>
And pressed their lips upon her head.<BR>
Each gave with sighs her last adieu,<BR>
Then at the king's command withdrew.<BR>
The king around the hermit went<BR>
With circling footsteps reverent,<BR>
And placed at Rishyas'ring's command<BR>
Some soldiers of his royal band.<BR>
The Br&aacute;hman bowed in turn and cried,<BR>
'May fortune never leave thy side.<BR>
O mighty King, with justice reign,<BR>
And still thy people's love retain.'<BR>
He spoke, and turned away his face,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And, as the hermit went,<BR>
The monarch, rooted to the place,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pursued with eyes intent.<BR>
But when the sage had past from view<BR>
King Das'aratha turned him too,<BR>
Still fixing on his friend each thought.<BR>
With such deep love his breast was fraught.<BR>
Amid his people's loud acclaim<BR>
Home to his royal seat he came,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And lived delighted there,<BR>
Expecting when each queenly dame,<BR>
Upholder of his ancient fame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her promised son should bear.<BR>
The glorious sage his way pursued<BR>
Till close before his eyes he viewed<BR>
Sweet Champ&aacute;, Lomap&aacute;d's fair town,<BR>
Wreathed with her Champacs'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="ry020.htm#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> leafy crown.<BR>
Soon as the saint's approach he knew,<BR>
The king, to yield him honour due,<BR>
Went forth to meet him with a band<BR>
Of priests and nobles of the land:<BR>
'Hail, Sage,' he cried, 'O joy to me!<BR>
What bliss it is, my lord, to see<BR>
Thee with thy wife and all thy train<BR>
Returning to my town again.<BR>
Thy father, honoured Sage, is well,<BR>
Who hither from his woodland cell<BR>
Has sent full many a messenger<BR>
For tidings both of thee and her.'<BR>
Then joyfully, for due respect,<BR>
The monarch bade the town be decked.<BR>
The king and Rishyas'ring elate<BR>
Entered the royal city's gate:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In front the chaplain rode.<BR>
Then, loved and honoured with all care<BR>
By monarch and by courtier, there<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The glorious saint abode.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_123"></A><A HREF="ry018.htm#fr_123">29:1</A>  This Canto will appear ridiculous to
the European reader. But it should be
remembered that the monkeys of an
Indian forest, the 'bough-deer' as the
poets call them, are very different animals
from the 'turpissima bestia' that accompanies
the itinerant organ-grinder or grins
in the Zoological Gardens of London.
Milton has made his hero, Satan, assume
the forms of a cormorant, a toad, and a
serpent, and I cannot see that this creation
of semi-divine V&aacute;nars, or monkeys, is
more ridiculous or undignified.</P>
