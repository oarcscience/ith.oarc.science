### CANTO CXV.: SITÁ'S JOY.

The Vánar chieftain bowed his head.  
Within the walls of Lanká sped,  
Leave from the new-made king obtained,  
And Sítá's lovely garden gained.  
Beneath a tree the queen he found,  
Where Rákshas warders watched around.  
Her pallid cheek, her tangled hair,  
Her raiment showed her deep despair,  
Near and more near the envoy came  
And gently hailed the weeping dame.  
She started up in sweet surprise,  
And sudden joy illumed her eyes.  
For well the Vánar's voice she knew,  
And hope reviving sprang and grew.  

'Fair Queen,' he said, 'our task is done:  
The foe is slain and Lanká won.  
Triumphant mid triumphant friends  
Kind words of greeting Ráma sends.  
'Blest for thy sake, O spouse most true,  
My deadly foe I met and slew.  
Mine eyes are strangers yet to sleep:  
I built a bridge athwart the deep  
And crossed the sea to Lanká's shore  
To keep the mighty oath I swore.  
Now, gentle love, thy cares dispel,  
And weep no more, for all is well.  
Fear not in Rávan's house to stay  
For good Vibhíshan now bears sway,  
For constant truth and friendship known.  

Regard his palace as thine own.'  
He greets thee thus thy heart to cheer,  
And urged by love will soon be here.'  

Then flushed with joy the lady's cheek.  
Her eyes o'erflowed, her voice was weak;  
But struggling with her sobs she broke  
Her silence thus, and faintly spoke:  
'So fast the flood of rapture came,  
My trembling tongue no words could frame.  
Ne'er have I heard in days of bliss  
A tale that gave such joy as this.  
More precious far than gems and gold  
The message which thy lips have told.'  

His reverent hands the Vánar raised  
And thus the lady's answer praised:  
'Sweet are the words, O Queen, which thou  
True to thy lord, hast spoken now,  
Better than gems and pearls of price,  
Yea, or the throne of Paradise.  
But, lady, ere I leave this place,  
Grant me, I pray, a single grace.  
Permit me, and this vengeful hand  
Shall slay thy guards, this Rákshas band,  
Whose cruel insult threat and scorn  
Thy gentle soul too long has borne.'  

Thus, stern of mood, Hanumán cried:  
The Maithil lady thus replied:  
'Nay, be not wroth with servants: they,  
When monarchs bid must needs obey.  
And, vassals of their lords, fulfil  
Each fancy of their sovereign will.  
To mine own sins the blame impute,  
For as we sow we reap the fruit.  
The tyrant's will these dames obeyed  
When their fierce threats my soul dismayed.'  

She ceased: with admiration moved  
The Vánar chief her words approved:  
'Thy speech,' he cried, 'is worthy one  
Whom love has linked to Raghu's son.  
Now speak, O Queen, that I may know  
Thy pleasure, for to him I go.'  
The Vánar ceased: then Janak's child  
Made answer as she sweetly smiled:  
'My first, my only wish can be,  
O chief, my loving lord to see.'  
Again the Vánar envoy spoke,  
And with his words new rapture woke:  
'Queen, ere this sun shall cease to shine  
Thy Ráma's eyes shall look in thine.  
Again the lord of Raghu's race  
Shall turn to thee his moon-bright face.  
His faithful brother shall thou see  
And every friend who fought for thee,  
And greet once more thy king restored  
Like S'achí  <span id="fr_1037"></span>[1](#fn_1037) to her heavenly
lord.'  
To Raghu's son his steps he bent  
And told the message that she sent.
