The hermit thus with watchful heed<BR>
Received the poem's pregnant seed,<BR>
And looked with eager thought around<BR>
If fuller knowledge might be found.<BR>

His lips with water first bedewed, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
He sate, in reverent attitude<BR>
On holy grass, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the points all bent<BR>
Together toward the orient; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
And thus in meditation he<BR>
Entered the path of poesy.<BR>
Then clearly, through his virtue's might,<BR>
All lay discovered to his sight,<BR>
Whate'er befell, through all their life,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, his brother, and his wife:<BR>
And Das'aratha and each queen<BR>
At every time, in every scene:<BR>
His people too, of every sort;<BR>
The nobles of his princely court:<BR>
Whate'er was said, whate'er decreed,<BR>
Each time they sate each plan and deed:<BR>
For holy thought and fervent rite<BR>
Had so refined his keener sight<BR>
That by his sanctity his view<BR>
The present, past, and future knew,<BR>
And he with mental eye could grasp,<BR>
Like fruit within his fingers clasp,<BR>
The life of R&aacute;ma, great and good,<BR>
Roaming with Sit&aacute; in the wood.<BR>
He told, with secret piercing eyes,<BR>
The tale of R&aacute;ma's high emprise.<BR>
Each listening ear that shall entice,<BR>
A sea of pearls of highest price.<BR>
Thus good V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki, sage divine,<BR>
Rehearsed the tale of Raghu's line,<BR>
As N&aacute;rad, heavenly saint, before<BR>
Had traced the story's outline o'er.<BR>
He sang of R&aacute;ma's princely birth,<BR>
His kindness and heroic worth;<BR>
His love for all, his patient youth,<BR>
His gentleness and constant truth,<BR>
And many a tale and legend old<BR>
By holy Vis'v&aacute;mitra told.<BR>
How Janak's child he wooed and won,<BR>
Aud broke the bow that bent to none.<BR>
How he with every virtue fraught<BR>
His namesake R&aacute;ma &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> met and fought.<BR>
The choice of R&aacute;ma for the throne;<BR>
The malice by Kalsey&iacute; shown,<BR>
Whose evil counsel marred the plan<BR>
And drove him forth a banisht man.<BR>
How the king grieved and groaned,and cried,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And swooned away and pining died.<BR>
The subjects' woe when thus bereft;<BR>
And how the following crowds he left:<BR>
With Guha talked, and firmly stern<BR>
Ordered his driver to return.<BR>
How Gang&aacute;'s farther shore he gained;<BR>
By Bharadv&aacute;ja entertained,<BR>
By whose advice be journeyed still<BR>
And came to Chitrak&uacute;ta's hill.<BR>
How there he dwelt and built a cot;<BR>
How Bharat journeyed to the spot;<BR>
His earnest supplication made;<BR>
Drink-offerings to their father paid;<BR>
The sandals given by R&aacute;ma's hand,<BR>
As emblems of his right to stand:<BR>
How from his presence Bharat went<BR>
And years in Nandigr&aacute;ma spent.<BR>
How R&aacute;ma entered Dandak wood<BR>
And in Sut&iacute;khna's presence stood.<BR>
The favour Anas&uacute;y&aacute; showed,<BR>
The wondrous balsam she bestowed.<BR>
How S&aacute;rabhang&aacute;'s dwelling place<BR>
They sought; saw Indra face to face;<BR>
The meeting with Agastya gained;<BR>
The heavenly bow from him obtained.<BR>
How R&aacute;ma with Vir&aacute;dha met;<BR>
Their home in Panchavata set.<BR>
How S'&uacute;rpanakh&aacute; underwent<BR>
The mockery and disfigurement.<BR>
Of Tr&iacute;gir&aacute;'s and Khara's fall,<BR>
Of R&aacute;van roused at vengeance call,<BR>
M&aacute;richa doomed, without escape;<BR>
The fair Videhan &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> lady's rape.<BR>
How R&aacute;ma wept and raved in vain,<BR>
And how the Vulture-king was slain.<BR>
How R&aacute;ma fierce Kabandha slew;<BR>
Then to the side of Pamp&aacute; drew.<BR>
Met Hanum&aacute;n, and her whose vows<BR>
Were kept beneath the greenwood boughs.<BR>
How Raghu's son the lofty-souled,<BR>
On Pamp&aacute;'s bank wept uncontrolled,<BR>
Then journeyed, Rishyam&uacute;k to reach,<BR>
And of Sugr&iacute;va then had speech.<BR>
The friendship made, which both had sought:<BR>
How B&aacute;li and Sugr&iacute;va fought.<BR>
How B&aacute;li in the strife was slain,<BR>
And how Sugr&iacute;va came to reign.<BR>
The treaty, T&aacute;ra's wild lament;<BR>
The rainy nights in watching spent.<BR>
The wrath of Raghu's lion son;<BR>
The gathering of the hosts in one.<BR>
The sending of the spies about,<BR>
And all the regions pointed out.<BR>
The ring by R&aacute;ma's hand bestowed;<BR>
The cave wherein the bear abode.<BR>
The fast proposed, their lives to end;<BR>
Sampati gained to be their friend.<BR>

The scaling of the hill, the leap<BR>
Of Hanum&aacute;n across the deep.<BR>
Ocean's command that bade them seek<BR>
Main&aacute;ka of the lofty peak.<BR>
The death of Sinhik&aacute;, the sight<BR>
Of Lank&aacute; with her palace bright<BR>
How Hanuman stole in at eve;<BR>
His plan the giants to deceive.<BR>
How through the square he made his way<BR>
To chambers where the women lay,<BR>
Within the As'oka garden came<BR>
And there found R&aacute;ma's captive dame,<BR>
His colloquy with her he sought,<BR>
And giving of the ring he brought.<BR>
How S&iacute;t&aacute; gave a gem o'erjoyed;<BR>
How Hanum&aacute;n the grove destroyed,<BR>
How giantesses trembling fled,<BR>
And servant fiends were smitten dead.<BR>
How Hanum&aacute;n was seized; their ire<BR>
When Lank&aacute; blazed with hostile fire.<BR>
His leap across the sea once more;<BR>
The eating of the honey store,<BR>
How R&aacute;ma he consoled, and how<BR>
He showed the gem from S&iacute;t&aacute;'s brow,<BR>
With Ocean, R&aacute;ma's interview;<BR>
The bridge that Nala o'er it threw.<BR>
The crossing, and the sitting down<BR>
At night round Lank&aacute;'s royal town.<BR>
The treaty with Vibh&iacute;shan made:<BR>
The plan for R&aacute;van's slaughter laid.<BR>
How Kumbhakarna in his pride<BR>
And Meghan&aacute;da fought and died.<BR>
How R&aacute;van in the fight was slain,<BR>
And captive S&iacute;t&aacute; brought again.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan set upon the throne;<BR>
The flying chariot Pushpak shown.<BR>
How Brahm&aacute; and the Gods appeared,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute;'s doubted honour cleared.<BR>
How In the flying car they rode<BR>
To Bh&aacute;radv&aacute;ja's cabin abode,<BR>
The Wind-God's son sent on afar;<BR>
How Bharat met the flying car.<BR>
How R&aacute;ma then was king ordained;<BR>
The legions their discharge obtained.<BR>
How R&aacute;ma cast his queen away;<BR>
How grew the people's love each day.<BR>
Thus did the saint V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki tell<BR>
Whate'er in R&aacute;ma's life befell,<BR>
And in the closing verse all<BR>
That yet to come will once befall<BR>
