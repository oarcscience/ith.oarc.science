<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO X.: DAS'ARATHA'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
As Queen Kaikev&iacute; thus obeyed<BR>
The sinful counsel of her maid<BR>
She sank upon the chamber floor,<BR>
As sinks in anguish, wounded sore,<BR>
An elephant beneath the smart<BR>
Of the wild hunter's venomed dart.<BR>
The lovely lady in her mind<BR>
Resolved the plot her maid designed,<BR>
And prompt the gain and risk to scan<BR>
She step by step approved the plan.<BR>
Misguided by the hump back's guile<BR>
She pondered her resolve awhile,<BR>
As the fair path that bliss secured<BR>
The miserable lady lured,<BR>

<P>

<P>
Devoted to her queen, and swayed<BR>
By hopes of gain and bliss, the maid<BR>
Rejoiced her lady's purpose known,<BR>
And deemed the prize she sought her own.<BR>
Then bent upon her purpose dire,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; with her soul on fire,<BR>
Upon the floor lay, languid, down,<BR>
Her brows contracted in a frown.<BR>
The bright-hued wreath that bound her hair,<BR>
Chains, necklets, jewels rich and rare,<BR>
Stripped off by her own fingers lay<BR>
Spread on the ground in disarray,<BR>
And to the floor a lustre lent<BR>
As stars light up the firmament.<BR>
Thus prostrate in the mourner's cell,<BR>
In garb of woe the lady fell,<BR>
Her long hair in a single braid,<BR>
Like some fair nymph of heaven dismayed. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The monarch, R&aacute;ma to install,<BR>
With thoughtful care had ordered all,<BR>
And now within his home withdrew,<BR>
Dismissing first his retinue.<BR>
Now all the town has heard, thought he,<BR>
What joyful rite the morn will see.<BR>
So turned he to her bower to cheer<BR>
With the glad news his darling's ear.<BR>
Majestic, as the Lord of Night,<BR>
When threatened by the Dragon's might,<BR>
Bursts radiant on the evening sky<BR>
Pale with the clouds that wander by,<BR>
So Das'aratha, great in fame,<BR>
To Queen Kaikey&iacute;'s palace came.<BR>
There parrots flew from tree to tree,<BR>
And gorgeous peacocks wandered free,<BR>
While ever and anon was heard<BR>
The note of some glad water-bird.<BR>
Here loitered dwarf and hump-backed maid,<BR>
There lute and here sweet music played.<BR>
Here, rich in blossom, creepers twined<BR>
O'er grots with wondrous art designed,<BR>
There Champac and As'oka flowers<BR>
Hung glorious o'er the summer bowers,<BR>
And mid the waving verdure rose<BR>
Gold, silver, ivory porticoes.<BR>
Through all the months in ceaseless store<BR>
The trees both fruit and blossom bore.<BR>
With many a lake the grounds were graced;<BR>
Seats gold and silver, here were placed;<BR>
Here every viand wooed the taste,<BR>
It was a garden meet to vie<BR>
E'en with the home of Gods on high.<BR>


<P>


<P>
Within the mansion rich and vast<BR>
The mighty Das'aratha passed:<BR>
Not there was his beloved queen<BR>
On her fair couch reclining seen.<BR>
With love his eager pulses beat<BR>
For the dear wife he came to meet,<BR>
And in his blissful hopes deceived,<BR>
He sought his absent love and grieved.<BR>
For never had she missed the hour<BR>
Of meeting in her sumptuous bower,<BR>
And never had the king of men<BR>
Entered the empty room till then.<BR>
Still urged by love and anxious thought<BR>
News of his favourite queen he sought,<BR>
For never had his loving eyes<BR>
Found her or selfish or unwise.<BR>
Then spoke at length the warder maid,<BR>
With hands upraised and sore afraid:<BR>
'My Lord and King, the queen has sought<BR>
The mourner's cell with rage distraught.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The words the warder maiden said<BR>
He heard with soul disquieted,<BR>
And thus as fiercer grief assailed,<BR>
His troubled senses wellnigh failed.<BR>
Consumed by torturing fires of grief<BR>
The king, the world's imperial chief,<BR>
His lady lying on the ground<BR>
In most unqueenly posture, found.<BR>
The aged king, all pure within,<BR>
Saw the young queen resolved on sin,<BR>
Low on the ground, his own sweet wife,<BR>
To him far dearer than his life,<BR>
Like some fair creeping plant uptorn,<BR>
Or like a maid of heaven forlorn,<BR>
A nymph of air or Goddess sent<BR>
From Swarga down in banishment.<BR>
As some wild elephant who tries<BR>
To soothe his consort as she lies<BR>
Struck by the hunter's venomed dart,<BR>
So the great king disturbed in heart.<BR>
Strove with soft hand and fond caress<BR>
To soothe his darling queen's distress,<BR>
Aud in his love addressed with sighs<BR>
The lady of the lotus eyes:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'I know not, Queen, why thou shouldst be<BR>
Thus angered to the heart with me.<BR>
Say, who has alighted thee, or whence<BR>
Has come the cause of such offence<BR>
That in the dust thou liest low,<BR>
And rendest my fond heart with woe,<BR>
As if some goblin of the night<BR>
Had struck thee with a deadly blight,<BR>
And cast foul influence on her<BR>
Whose spells my loving bosom stir?<BR>
I have Physicians famed for skill,<BR>
Each trained to cure some special ill:<BR>
My sweetest lady, tell thy pain,<BR>
And they shall make thee well again.<BR>
Whom, darling, wouldst thou punished see?<BR>
Or whom enriched with lordly fee?<BR>

"Weep not, my lovely Queen, and stay<BR>
This grief that wears thy frame away<BR>
Speak, and the guilty shall be freed,<BR>
The guiltless be condemned to bleed.<BR>
The poor enriched, the rich abased.<BR>
The low set high, the proud disgraced.<BR>
Mv lords and I thy will obey,<BR>
All slaves who own thy sovereign sway;<BR>
And I can ne'er my heart incline<BR>
To check in aught one wish of thine.<BR>
Now by my life I pray thee tell<BR>
The thoughts that in thy bosom dwell,<BR>
The power and might thou knowest wel.<BR>
Should from thy breast all doubt expel,<BR>
I swear by all my merit won,<BR>
Speak, and thy pleasure shall be done.<BR>
Far as the world's wide bounds extend<BR>
My glorious empire knows no end.<BR>
Mine are the tribes in eastern lands,<BR>
And those who dwell on Sindhu's sands:<BR>
Mine is Sur&aacute;shtra, far away,<BR>
Suv&iacute;ra's realm admits my sway.<BR>
My best the southern nations fear,<BR>
The Angas and the Vaugas hear.<BR>
And as lord paramount I reign<BR>
O'er Magadh and the Matsyas' plain,<BR>
Kos'al, and K&aacute;si's wide domain:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="ry089.htm#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
All rich in treasures of the mine.<BR>
In golden corn, sheep, goats, and kine.<BR>
Choose what thou wilt. Kaikeyi, thence:<BR>
But tell me, O my darling, whence<BR>
Arose thy grief, and it shall fly<BR>
Like hoar-frost when the sun is high.'<BR>

<P>
She, by his loving words consoled,<BR>
Longed her dire purpose to unfold,<BR>
And sought with sharper pangs to wring<BR>
The bosom of her lord the king.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_272"></A><A HREF="ry088.htm#fr_272">101:1</A>  These verses are evidently an interpolation.
They contain nothing that has
not been already related: the words only
are altered. As the whole poem could not
be recited at once, the rhapsodists at the
beginning of a fresh recitation would naturally
remind their hearers of the events
immediately preceding.</P>
