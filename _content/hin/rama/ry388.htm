<P>
Then fierce the giant's fury blazed<BR>
As on Han&uacute;m&aacute;n's form he gazed,<BR>
And shaken by each wild surmise<BR>
He spake aloud with flashing eyes:<BR>
'Can this be Nandi &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> standing here,<BR>
The mighty one whom all revere?<BR>
Who once on high Kail&aacute;sa's hill<BR>
Pronounced the curse that haunts me still?<BR>
Or is the woodland creature one<BR>
Of Asur race, or Bali's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> son?<BR>
The wretch with searching question try:<BR>
Learn who he is, and whence; and why<BR>
He marred the glory of the grove,<BR>
And with my captains fiercely strove.'<BR>

Prahasta heard his lord's behest,<BR>
And thus the V&aacute;nar chief addressed:<BR>
'O monkey stranger, be consoled:<BR>
Fear not, and let thy heart be bold.<BR>
If thou by Indra's mandate sent<BR>
Thy steps to Lank&aacute;'s isle hast bent,<BR>
With fearless words the cause explain,<BR>
And freedom thou shalt soon regain.<BR>
Or if thou comest as a spy<BR>
Despatched by Vishnu in the sky,<BR>
Or sent by Yama, or the Lord<BR>
Of Riches, hast our town explored;<BR>
Proved by the prowess thou hast shown<BR>
No monkey save in form alone;<BR>
Speak boldly all the truth, and be<BR>
Released from bonds, unharmed and free.<BR>
But falsehood spoken to our king<BR>
Swift punishment of death will bring.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: the V&aacute;nar made reply;<BR>
'Not Indra's messenger am I,<BR>
Nor came I hither to fulfil<BR>
Kuvera's hest or Vishnu's will.<BR>
I stand before the giants here<BR>
A V&aacute;nar e'en as I appear.<BR>
I longed to see the king--'twas hard<BR>
To win my way through gate and guard.<BR>
And so to gain my wish I laid<BR>
In ruin that delightful shade<BR>
No fiend, no God of heavenly kind<BR>
With bond or chain these herbs may bind.<BR>
The Eternal Sire himself of old<BR>
Vouchsafed the boon that makes me bold,<BR>
From Brahm&aacute;'s magic shaft released &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="ry389.htm#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
I knew the captor's power had ceased,<BR>
The fancied bonds I freely brooked,<BR>
And thus upon the king have looked.<BR>
My way to Lank&aacute; have I won,<BR>
A messenger from Raghu's son.'<BR>
