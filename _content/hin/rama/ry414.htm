<P>
He ceased: and Indrajit the pride<BR>
Of R&aacute;kshas warriors thus replied:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Is this a speech our king should hear,<BR>
This counsel of ignoble fear?<BR>
A scion of our glorious race<BR>
Should ne'er conceive a thought so base,<BR>
But one mid all our kin we find.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan, whose degenerate mind<BR>
No spark of gallant pride retains.<BR>
Whose coward soul his lineage stains.<BR>
Against one giant what can two<BR>
Unhappy sons of Raghu do?<BR>
Away with idle fears, away!<BR>
Matched with our meanest, what are they?<BR>
Beneath my conquering prowess fell<BR>
The Lord of earth and heaven and hell, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_934"></A><A HREF="#fn_934"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Through every startled region dread<BR>
Of my resistless fury spread;<BR>
And Gods in each remotest sphere<BR>
Confessed the universal fear.<BR>
Rending the air with roar and groan,<BR>
Air&aacute;vt &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_935"></A><A HREF="#fn_935"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to the earth was thrown.<BR>
From his huge head the tusks I drew,<BR>
And smote the Gods with fear anew.<BR>
Shall I who tame celestials' pride,<BR>
By whom the fiends are terrified,<BR>
Now prove a weakling little worth,<BR>
And fail to slay those sons of earth?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: Vibh&iacute;shan trained and tried<BR>
In war and counsel thus replied<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Thy speech is marked with scorn of truth,<BR>
With rashness and the pride of youth.<BR>
Yea, to thy ruin like a child<BR>
Thou pratest, and thy words are wild.<BR>
Most dear, O Indrajit, to thee<BR>
Should R&aacute;van's weal and safety be,<BR>
For thou art called his son, but thou<BR>
Art proved his direst foeman now,<BR>
When warned by me thou hast not tried<BR>
To turn the coming woe aside.<BR>
Both thee and him 'twere meet to slay,<BR>
Who brought thee to this hall to-day,<BR>
And dared so rash a youth admit<BR>
To council where the wisest sit.<BR>
Presumptuous, wild, devoid of sense,<BR>
Filled full of pride and insolence,<BR>
Thv reckless tongue thou wilt not rule<BR>
That speaks the counsel of a fool.<BR>
Who in the fight may brook or shun<BR>
The arrows shot by Raghu's son<BR>
With flame and fiery vengeance sped,<BR>
Dire as his staff who rules the dead?<BR>
O R&aacute;van, let thy people live,<BR>
And to the son of Raghu give<BR>
Fair robes and gems and precious ore,<BR>
And Sit&aacute; to his arms restore.'<BR>
