<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LVII.: SUMANTRA'S RETURN.</H3>
<P>
When R&aacute;ma reached the southern bank,<BR>
King Guha's heart with sorrow sank:<BR>


<P>


<P>
He with Sumantra talked, and spent<BR>
With his deep sorrow, homeward went.<BR>
Sumantra, as the king decreed,<BR>
Yoked to the car each noble steed,<BR>
And to Ayodhy&aacute;'s city sped<BR>
With his sad heart disquieted.<BR>
On lake and brook and scented grove<BR>
His glances fell, as on he drove:<BR>
City and village came in view<BR>
As o'er the road his coursers flew.<BR>
On the third day the charioteer,<BR>
When now the hour of night was near,<BR>
Came to Ayodhy&aacute;'s gate, and found<BR>
The city all in sorrow drowned.<BR>
To him, in spirit quite cast down,<BR>
Forsaken seemed the silent town,<BR>
And by the rush of grief oppressed<BR>
He pondered in his mournful breast:<BR>
'Is all Ayodhy&aacute; burnt with grief,<BR>
Steed, elephant, and man, and chief?<BR>
Does her loved R&aacute;ma's exile so<BR>
Afflict her with the fires of woe?'<BR>
Thus as he mused, his steeds flew fast,<BR>
And swiftly through the gate he passed.<BR>
On drove the charioteer, and then<BR>
In hundreds, yea in thousands, men<BR>
Ran to the car from every side,<BR>
And, 'R&aacute;ma, where is R&aacute;ma?' cried.<BR>
Sumantra said: 'My chariot bore<BR>
The duteous prince to Gang&aacute;'s shore;<BR>
I left him there at his behest,<BR>
And homeward to Ayodhy&aacute; pressed.'<BR>
Soon as the anxious people knew<BR>
That he was o'er the flood they drew<BR>
Deep sighs, and crying, R&aacute;ma! all<BR>
Wailed, and big tears began to fall.<BR>
He heard the mournful words prolonged,<BR>
As here and there the people thronged:<BR>
'Woe, woe for us, forlorn, undone,<BR>
No more to look on Raghu's son!<BR>
His like again we ne'er shall see,<BR>
Of heart so true, of hand so free,<BR>
In gifts, in gatherings for debate,<BR>
When marriage pomps we celebrate,<BR>
What should we do? What earthly thing<BR>
Can rest, or hope, or pleasure bring?'<BR>

<P>
Thus the sad town, which R&aacute;ma kept<BR>
As a kind father, wailed and wept.<BR>
Each mansion, as the car went by,<BR>
Sent forth a loud and bitter cry,<BR>
As to the window every dame,<BR>
Mourning for banished R&aacute;ma, came.<BR>
As his sad eyes with tears o'erflowed,<BR>
He sped along the royal road<BR>
To Das'aratha's high abode.<BR>
There leaping down his car he stayed;<BR>
Within the gates his way he made;<BR>
Through seven broad courts he onward hied<BR>
Where people thronged on every side.<BR>
From each high terrace, wild with woe<BR>
The royal Indies flocked below:<BR>

<P>

<P>
He heard them talk in gentle tone,<BR>
As each for R&aacute;ma made her moan:<BR>
'What will the charioteer reply<BR>
To Queen Kaus'aly&aacute;'s eager cry?<BR>
With R&aacute;ma from the gates he went;<BR>
Homeward alone, his steps are bent.<BR>
Hard is a life with woe distressed!<BR>
But difficult to win is rest,<BR>
If, when her son is banished, still<BR>
She lives beneath her load of ill.'<BR>

<P>
Such was the speech Sumantra heard<BR>
From them whom grief unfeigned had stirred.<BR>
As fires of anguish burnt him through,<BR>
Swift to the monarch's hall he drew,<BR>
Past the eighth court; there met his sight,<BR>
The sovereign in his palace bright,<BR>
Still weeping for his son, forlorn,<BR>
Pale, faint, and all with sorrow worn.<BR>
As there he sat, Sumantra bent<BR>
And did obeisance reverent,<BR>
And to the king repeated o'er<BR>
The message he from R&aacute;ma bore.<BR>
The monarch heard, and well-nigh brake<BR>
His heart, but yet no word he spake:<BR>
Fainting to earth he fell, and dumb,<BR>
By grief for R&aacute;ma overcome,<BR>
Rang through the hall a startling cry,<BR>
And women's arms were tossed on high,<BR>
When, with his senses all astray,<BR>
Upon the ground the monarch lay.<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; with Sumitr&aacute;s aid,<BR>
Raised from the ground her lord dismayed:<BR>
'Sire, of high fate, she cried, O, why<BR>
Dost thou no single word reply<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's messenger who brings<BR>
News of his painful wanderings?<BR>
The great injustice done, art thou<BR>
Shame-stricken for thy conduct now?<BR>
Rise up, and do thy part: bestow<BR>
Comfort and help in this our woe.<BR>
Speak freely, King; dismiss thy fear,<BR>
For Queen Kaikey&iacute; stands not near,<BR>
Afraid of whom thou wouldst not seek<BR>
Tidings of R&aacute;ma: freely speak.'<BR>

<P>
When the sad queen had ended so,<BR>
She sank, insatiate in her woe,<BR>
And prostrate lay upon the ground,<BR>
While her faint voice by sobs was drowned.<BR>
When all the ladies in despair<BR>
Saw Queen Kaus'aly&aacute; wailing there,<BR>
And the poor king oppressed with pain,<BR>
They flocked around and wept again.<BR>
