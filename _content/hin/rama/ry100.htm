<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXII.: LAKSHMAN CALMED.</H3>
<P>
So R&aacute;ma kept unshaken still<BR>
His noble heart with iron will.<BR>
To his dear brother next he turned,<BR>
Whose glaring eyes with fury burned,<BR>
Indignant, panting like a snake,<BR>
And thus again his counsel spake:<BR>
'Thine anger and thy grief restrain,<BR>
And firm in duty's path remain.<BR>
Dear brother, lay thy scorn aside,<BR>
And be the right thy joy and pride.<BR>
Thy ready zeal and thoughtful care<BR>
To aid what rites should grace the heir,--<BR>
These 'tis another's now to ask;<BR>
Come, gird thee for thy noble task,<BR>
That Bharat's throning rites may he<BR>
Graced with the things prepared for me.<BR>
And with thy gentle care provide<BR>
That her fond heart, now sorely tried<BR>
With fear and longing for my sake,<BR>
With doubt and dread may never ache.<BR>
To know that thoughts of coming ill<BR>
One hour that tender bosom fill<BR>
With agony and dark despair<BR>
Is grief too great for me to bear.<BR>
I cannot, brother, call to mind<BR>
One wilful fault or undesigned,<BR>
When I have pained in anything<BR>
My mothers or my sire the king.<BR>
The right my father keeps in view,<BR>
In promise, word, and action true;<BR>
Let him then all his fear dismiss,<BR>
Nor dread the loss of future bliss.<BR>
He fears his truth herein will fail:<BR>
Hence bitter thoughts his heart assail.<BR>
He trembles lest the rites proceed,<BR>
And at his pangs my heart should bleed.<BR>
So now this earnest wish is mine,<BR>
The consecration to resign,<BR>
And from this city turn away<BR>
To the wild wood with no delay.<BR>
My banishment to-day will free<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; from her cares, that she,<BR>
At last contented and elate,<BR>
May Bharat's throning celebrate.<BR>

<P>
Then will the lady's trouble cease,<BR>
Then will her heart have joy and peace,<BR>
When wandering in the wood I wear<BR>
Deerskin, and bark, and matted hair.<BR>
Nor shall by me his heart be grieved<BR>
Whose choice approved, whose mind conceived<BR>
This counsel which I follow. No,<BR>
Forth to the forest will I go.<BR>
'Tis Fate, Sumitr&aacute;s son, confess,<BR>
That sends me to the wilderness.<BR>
'Tis Fate alone that gives away<BR>
To'other hands the royal sway<BR>
How could Kaikey&iacute;'s purpose bring<BR>
On me this pain and suffering,<BR>
Were not her change of heart decreed<BR>
By Fate whose will commands the deed?<BR>
I know my filial love has been<BR>
The same throughout for every queen,<BR>
And with the same affection she<BR>
Has treated both her son and me.<BR>
Her shameful words of cruel spite<BR>
To stay the consecrating rite,<BR>
And drive me banished from the throne,--<BR>
These I ascribe to Fate alone,<BR>
How could she, born of royal race,<BR>
Whom nature decks with fairest grace,<BR>
Speak like a dame of low degree<BR>
Before the king to torture me?<BR>
But Fate, which none may comprehend,<BR>
To which all life must bow and bend,<BR>
In her and me its power has shown,<BR>
And all my hopes are overthrown.<BR>
What man, Sumitr&aacute;'s darling, may<BR>
Contend with Fate's resistless sway,<BR>
Whose all-commanding power we find<BR>
Our former deeds alone can bind?<BR>
Our life and death, our joy and pain,<BR>
Anger and fear, and loss and gain,<BR>
Each thing that is, in every state,<BR>
All is the work of none but Fate.<BR>
E'en saints, inspired with rigid zeal.<BR>
When once the stroke of Fate they feel,<BR>
In sternest vows no more engage,<BR>
And fall enslaved by love and rage.<BR>
So now the sudden stroke whose weight<BR>
Descends unlooked for, comes of Fate,<BR>
And with unpitying might destroys<BR>
The promise of commencing joys.<BR>
Weigh this true counsel in thy soul:<BR>
With thy firm heart thy heart control;<BR>
Then, brother, thou wilt cease to grieve<BR>
For hindered rites which now I leave.<BR>
So cast thy needless grief away,<BR>
And strictly my commands obey.<BR>
Those preparations check with speed,<BR>
Nor let my throning rites proceed.<BR>
Those urns that stand prepared to shed<BR>
King-making drops upon my head,<BR>
Shall, with their pure lustrations now<BR>
Inaugurate my hermit's vow.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Yet what have I to do with things<BR>
That touch the state and pomp of kings?<BR>
These hands of mine shall water take<BR>
To sanctify the vow I make.<BR>
Now Lakshman, let thy heart no more<BR>
My fortune changed and lost deplore.<BR>
A forest life more joys may bring<BR>
Than those that wait upon a king,<BR>
Now though her arts successful mar<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    My consecrating rite,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Let not the youngest queen too far<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thy jealous fear excite.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nor let one thought suggesting ill<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Upon our father fall,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But let thy heart remember still<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That Fate is lord of all.'<BR>
