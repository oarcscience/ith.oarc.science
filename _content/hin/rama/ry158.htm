All they who knew the joiner's art,<BR>
Or distant ground in every part;<BR>
Each busied in his several trade,<BR>
To work machines or ply the spade;<BR>
Deft workmen skilled to frame the wheel,<BR>
Or with the ponderous engine deal;<BR>
Guides of the way, and craftsmen skilled,<BR>
To sink the well, make bricks, and build;<BR>
And those whose hands the tree could hew,<BR>
And work with slips of cut bamboo,<BR>
Went forward, and to guide them, they<BR>
Whose eyes before had seen the way.<BR>
Then onward in triumphant mood<BR>
Went all the mighty multitude.<BR>
Like the great sea whose waves leap high<BR>
When the full moon is in the sky.<BR>
Then, in his proper duty skilled,<BR>
Each joined him to his several guild,<BR>
And onward in advance they went<BR>
With every tool and implement.<BR>
Where bush and tangled creeper lay<BR>
With trenchant steel they made the way;<BR>
They felled each stump, removed each stone,<BR>
And many a tree was overthrown.<BR>
In other spots, on desert lands,<BR>
Tall trees were reared by busy hands.<BR>
Where'er the line of road they took,<BR>
They plied the hatchet, axe, and hook.<BR>

Others, with all their strength applied,<BR>
Cast vigorous plants and shrubs aside,<BR>
In shelving valleys rooted deep,<BR>
And levelled every dale and steep.<BR>
Each pit and hole that stopped the way<BR>
They filled with stones, and mud, and clay.<BR>
And all the ground that rose and fell<BR>
With busy care was levelled well.<BR>
They bridged ravines with ceaseless toil,<BR>
And pounded fine the flinty soil.<BR>
Now here, now there, to right and left,<BR>
A passage through the ground they cleft,<BR>
And soon the rushing flood was led<BR>
Abundant through the new-cut bed,<BR>
Which by the running stream supplied<BR>
With ocean's boundless waters vied.<BR>
In dry and thirsty spots they sank<BR>
Full many a well and ample tank,<BR>
And altars round about them placed<BR>
To deck the station in the waste.<BR>
With well-wrought plaster smoothly spread,<BR>
With bloomy trees that rose o'erhead,<BR>
With banners waving in the air,<BR>
And wild birds singing here and there,<BR>
With fragrant sandal-water wet,<BR>
With many a flower beside it set,<BR>
Like the Gods' heavenly pathway showed<BR>
That mighty host's imperial road.<BR>
Deft workmen, chosen for their skill<BR>
To do the high-souled Bharat's will,<BR>
In every pleasant spot where grew<BR>
Trees of sweet fruit and fair to view,<BR>
As he commanded, toiled to grace<BR>
With all delights his camping-place.<BR>
And they who read the stars, and well<BR>
Each lucky sign and hour could tell,<BR>
Raised carefully the tented shade<BR>
Wherein high-minded Bharat stayed.<BR>
With ample space of level ground,<BR>
With broad deep moat encompassed round;<BR>
Like Mandar in his towering pride,<BR>
With streets that ran from side to side;<BR>
Enwreathed with many a palace tall<BR>
Surrounded by its noble wall;<BR>
With roads by skilful workmen made.<BR>
Where many a glorious banner played;<BR>
With stately mansions, where the dove<BR>
Sat nestling in her cote above.<BR>
Rising aloft supremely fair<BR>
Like heavenly cars that float in air,<BR>
Each camp in beauty and in bliss<BR>
Matched Indra's own metropolis.<BR>
&nbsp; As shines the heaven on some fair night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With moon and constellations filled.<BR>
&nbsp; The prince's royal road was bright,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Adorned by art of workmen skilled.<BR>
