<P>
But dwelling in that lonely spot<BR>
Left by the hermits pleased him not.<BR>
'I met the faithful Bharat here,<BR>
The townsmen, and my mother dear:<BR>
The painful memory lingers yet,<BR>
And stings me with a vain regret.<BR>
And here the host of Bharat camped,<BR>
And many a courser here has stamped,<BR>
And elephants with ponderous feet<BR>
Have trampled through the calm retreat.'<BR>
So forth to seek a home he hied,<BR>
His spouse and Lakshman by his side.<BR>
He came to Atri's pure retreat.<BR>
Paid reverence to his holy feet,<BR>
And from the saint such welcome won<BR>
As a fond father gives his son.<BR>
The noble prince with joy unfeigned<BR>
As a dear guest he entertained,<BR>
And cheered the glorious Lakshman too<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; with observance due.<BR>
Then Anas&uacute;y&aacute; at the call<BR>
Of him who sought the good of all,<BR>
His blameless venerable spouse,<BR>
Delighting in her holy vows,<BR>
Came from her chamber to his side:<BR>
To her the virtuous hermit cried:<BR>
'Receive, I pray, with friendly grace<BR>
This dame of Maithil monarchs' race:<BR>
To R&aacute;ma next made known his wife,<BR>
The devotee of saintliest life:<BR>
'Ten thousand years this votaress bent<BR>
On sternest rites of penance spent;<BR>
She when the clouds withheld their rain,<BR>
And drought ten years consumed the plain,<BR>
Caused grateful roots and fruit to grow<BR>
And ordered Gang&aacute; here to flow:<BR>
So from their cares the saints she freed,<BR>
Nor let these checks their rites impede,<BR>
She wrought in Heaven's behalf, and made<BR>
Ten nights of one, the Gods to aid: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_400"></A><A HREF="#fn_400"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Let holy Anas&uacute;y&aacute; be<BR>
An honoured mother, Prince, to thee.<BR>
Let thy Videhan spouse draw near<BR>
To her whom all that live revere,<BR>
Stricken in years, whose loving mind<BR>
Is slow to wrath and ever kind.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: and R&aacute;ma gave assent,<BR>
And said, with eyes on S&iacute;t&aacute; bent:<BR>
'O Princess, thou hast heard with me<BR>
This counsel of the devotee:<BR>
Now that her touch thy soul may bless,<BR>
Approach the saintly votaress:<BR>


<P>

<P>
Come to the venerable dame,<BR>
Far known by Anas&uacute;y&aacute;'s name:<BR>
The mighty things that she has done<BR>
High glory in the world have won.'<BR>

<P>
Thus spoke the son of Raghu: she<BR>
Approached the saintly devotee,<BR>
Who with her white locks, old and frail,<BR>
Shook like a plantain in the gale.<BR>
To that true spouse she bowed her head,<BR>
And 'Lady, I am S&iacute;t&aacute;,' said:<BR>
Raised suppliant hands and prayed her tell<BR>
That all was prosperous and well.<BR>

<P>
The aged matron, when she saw<BR>
Fair S&iacute;t&aacute; true to duty's law,<BR>
Addressed her thus: ' High fate is thine<BR>
Whose thoughts to virtue still incline.<BR>
Thou, lady of the noble mind,<BR>
Hast kin and state and wealth resigned<BR>
To follow R&aacute;ma forced to tread<BR>
Where solitary woods are spread.<BR>
Those women gain high spheres above<BR>
Who still unchanged their husbands love,<BR>
Whether they dwell in town or wood,<BR>
Whether their hearts be ill or good.<BR>
Though wicked, poor, or led away<BR>
In love's forbidden paths to stray,<BR>
The noble matron still will deem<BR>
Her lord a deity supreme.<BR>
Regarding kin and friendship, I<BR>
Can see no better, holier tie,<BR>
And every penance-rite is dim<BR>
Beside the joy of serving him.<BR>
But dark is this to her whose mind<BR>
Promptings of idle fancy blind,<BR>
Who led by evil thoughts away<BR>
Makes him who should command obey.<BR>
Such women, O dear Maithil dame,<BR>
Their virtue lose and honest fame,<BR>
Enslaved by sin and folly, led<BR>
In these unholy paths to tread.<BR>
But they who good and true like thee<BR>
The present and the future see,<BR>
Like men by holy deeds will rise<BR>
To mansions in the blissful skies.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  So keep thee pure from taint of sin,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Still to thy lord be true,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And fame and merit shalt thou win,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To thy devotion due.'<BR>
