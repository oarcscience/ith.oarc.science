<P>
His words the Maithil lady heard<BR>
Oppressed by woe but undeterred.<BR>
Fear of the fiend she cast aside,<BR>
And thus in noble scorn replied:<BR>
'His word of honour never stained<BR>
King Das'aratha nobly reigned,<BR>
The bridge of right, the friend of truth.<BR>
His eldest son, a noble youth,<BR>
Is R&aacute;ma, virtue's faithful friend,<BR>
Whose glories through the worlds extend.<BR>
Long arms and large full eyes has he,<BR>
Mv husband, yea a God to me.<BR>
With shoulders like the forest king's,<BR>
From old Ikshv&aacute;ku's line he springs.<BR>
He with his brother Lakshman's aid<BR>
Will smite thee with the vengeful blade.<BR>
Hadst thou but dared before his eyes<BR>
To lay thine hand upon the prize,<BR>
Thou stretched before his feet hadst lain<BR>
In Janasth&aacute;n like Khara slain.<BR>
Thy boasted rovers of the night<BR>
With hideous shapes and giant might,--<BR>
Like serpents when the feathered king<BR>
Swoops down with his tremendous wing,--<BR>
Will find their useless venom fail<BR>
When R&aacute;ma's mighty arms assail.<BR>
The rapid arrows bright with gold.<BR>
Shot from the bow he loves to hold.<BR>
Will rend thy frame from flank to flank<BR>
As Gang&aacute;'s waves erode the bank.<BR>
Though neither God nor fiend have power<BR>
To slay thee in the battle hour,<BR>
Yet from his hand shall come thy fate,<BR>
Struck down before his vengeful hate.<BR>
That mighty lord will strike and end<BR>
The days of life thou hast to spend.<BR>
Thy days are doomed, thy life is sped<BR>
Like victim's to the pillar led.<BR>
Yea, if the glance of R&aacute;ma bright<BR>
With fury on thy form should light,<BR>
Thou scorched this day wouldst fall and die<BR>

<P>
Like K&aacute;ma slain by Rudra's eye.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
He who from heaven the moon could throw,<BR>
Or bid its bright rays cease to glow,--<BR>
He who could drain the mighty sea<BR>
Will set his darling S&iacute;t&aacute; free<BR>
Fled is thy life, thy glory, fled<BR>
Thy strength and power: each sense is dead.<BR>
Soon Lank&aacute; widowed by thy guilt<BR>
Will see the blood of giants spilt.<BR>
This wicked deed, O cruel King,<BR>
No triumph, no delight will bring.<BR>
Thou with outrageous might and scorn<BR>
A woman from her lord hast torn.<BR>
My glorious husband far away,<BR>
Making heroic strength his stay,<BR>
Dwells with his brother, void of fear,<BR>
In Dandak forest lone and drear.<BR>
No more in force of arms confide:<BR>
That haughty strength, that power and pride<BR>
My hero with his arrowy rain<BR>
From all thy bleeding limbs will drain.<BR>
When urged by fate's dire mandate, nigh<BR>
Comes the fixt hour for men to die.<BR>
Caught in Death's toils their eyes are blind,<BR>
And folly takes each wandering mind.<BR>
So for the outrage thou hast done<BR>
The fate is near thou canst not shun,--<BR>
The fate that on thyself and all<BR>
Thy giants and thy town shall fall.<BR>
I spurn thee: can the altar dight<BR>
With vessels for the sacred rite,<BR>
O'er which the priest his prayer has said,<BR>
Be sullied by an outcaste's tread?<BR>
So me, the consort dear and true<BR>
Of him who clings to virtue too,<BR>
Thy hated touch shall ne'er defile,<BR>
Base tyrant lord of Lank&aacute;'s isle.<BR>
Can the white swan who floats in pride<BR>
Through lilies by her consort's side,<BR>
Look for one moment, as they pass,<BR>
On the poor diver in the grass?<BR>
This senseless body waits thy will.<BR>
To torture, chain, to wound or kill.<BR>
I will not, King of giants, strive<BR>
To keep this fleeting soul alive<BR>
But never shall they join the name<BR>
Of S&iacute;t&aacute; with reproach and shame.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus as her breast with fury burned<BR>
Her bitter speech the dame returned.<BR>
Such words of rage and scorn, the last<BR>
She uttered, at the fiend she cast<BR>
Her taunting speech the giant heard,<BR>
And every hair with anger stired,<BR>
Then thus with fury in his eye<BR>
He made in threats his  fierce reply<BR>
'Hear Maithil lady, hear my speech<BR>
* to my words and ponder each<BR>
* thy head twelve months shall fly<BR>

<P>

<P>
And thou thy love wilt still deny,<BR>
My cooks shall mince thy flesh with steel<BR>
And serve it for my morning meal.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus with terrific threats to her<BR>
Spake R&aacute;van, cruel ravener.<BR>
Mad with the rage her answer woke<BR>
He called the fiendish train and spoke:<BR>
'Take her, ye R&aacute;kshas dames, who fright<BR>
With hideous form and mien the sight,<BR>
Who make the flesh of men your food,--<BR>
And let her pride be soon subdued.'<BR>
He spoke, and at his word the band<BR>
Of fiendish monsters raised each hand<BR>
In reverence to the giant king,<BR>
And pressed round S&iacute;t&aacute; in a ring.<BR>
R&aacute;van once more with stern behest<BR>
To those she-fiends his speech addressed:<BR>
Shaking the earth beneath his tread,<BR>
He stamped his furious foot and said:<BR>
'To the As'oka garden bear<BR>
The dame, and guard her safely there<BR>
Until her stubborn pride be bent<BR>
By mingled threat and blandishment.<BR>
See that ye watch her well, and tame,<BR>
Like some she-elephant, the dame.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They led her to that garden where<BR>
The sweetest flowers perfumed the air,<BR>
Where bright trees bore each rarest fruit,<BR>
And birds, enamoured, ne'er were mute.<BR>
Bowed down with terror and distress,<BR>
Watched by each cruel giantess,--<BR>
Like a poor solitary deer<BR>
When ravening tigresses are near,--<BR>
The hapless lady lay distraught<BR>
Like some wild thing but newly caught,<BR>
And found no solace, no relief<BR>
From agonizing fear and grief;<BR>
Not for one moment could forget<BR>
Each terrifying word and threat,<BR>
Or the fierce eyes upon her set<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By those who watched around.<BR>
She thought of R&aacute;ma far away,<BR>
She mourned for Lakshman as she lay<BR>
In grief and terror and dismay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Half fainting on the ground.<BR>
