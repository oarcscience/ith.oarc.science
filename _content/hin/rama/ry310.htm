<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXVI.: SUGR&Iacute;VA'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
She ceased: and Lakshman gave assent,<BR>
Won by her gentle argument.<BR>
So T&aacute;r&aacute;'s pleading, just and mild,<BR>
His softening heart had reconciled.<BR>
His altered mood Sugr&iacute;va saw,<BR>
And cast aside the fear and awe<BR>
Like raiment heavy with the rain<BR>
Which on his troubled soul had lain.<BR>
Then quickly to the ground he threw<BR>
His flowery garland, bright of hue,<BR>
Which round his royal neck he wore,<BR>
And, sobered, was himself once more.<BR>
Then turning to the princely man<BR>
In soothing words the king began:<BR>
'My glory, wealth, and royal sway<BR>
To other hands had passed away:<BR>
But R&aacute;ma to my rescue came,<BR>
And gave me back my power and fame.<BR>
O Lakshman, say, whose grateful heart<BR>

<P>
Could nurse the hope to pay in part,<BR>
By service of a life, the deed<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma sprung of heavenly seed?<BR>
His foeman R&aacute;van shall be slain,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; shall be his again.<BR>
The hero's side I will not leave,<BR>
But he the conquest shall achieve.<BR>
What need of help has he who drew<BR>
His bow, and one great arrow flew<BR>
Trough seven tall trees, a mountain rent,<BR>
And cleft the earth with force unspent?<BR>
What aid needs he who shook his bow,<BR>
And at the sound the earth below<BR>
With hill and wood and rooted rock<BR>
Quaked feverous with the thunder shock?<BR>
Yet all my legions will I bring.<BR>
And follow close the warrior king<BR>
Marching on his impetuous way<BR>
Fierce R&aacute;van and his hosts to slay.<BR>
If I be guilty of offence,<BR>
Careless through love or negligence,<BR>
Let him his loyal slave forgive;<BR>
For error cleaves to all who live.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus king Sugriva, good and brave,<BR>
In humble words his answer gave,<BR>
Softened was Lakshman's angry mood<BR>
Who thus his friendly speech renewed:<BR>
'My brother, V&aacute;nar King, will see<BR>
A champion and a friend in thee.<BR>
So strong art thou, so brave and bold,<BR>
So pure in thought, so humble-souled,<BR>
That thou deservest well to reign<BR>
And all a monarch's bliss to gain.<BR>
Lend thou my brother aid, and all<BR>
His foes beneath his arm will fall.<BR>
Full well the words thou speakest suit<BR>
A chieftain wise and resolute.<BR>
With grateful heart that loves the right,<BR>
And foot that never yields in tight.<BR>
O come, and my sad brother cheer<BR>
Who mourns the wife he holds so dear.<BR>
O pardon, friend, my harsh address,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's frantic bitterness.'<BR>
