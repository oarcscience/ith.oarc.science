### CANTO XV.: THE PREPARATIONS.

   There slept the Bráhmans, deeply read  
In Scripture, till the night had fled;  
Then, with the royal chaplains, they  
Took each his place in long array.  
There gathered fast the chiefs of trade,  
Nor peer nor captain long delayed,  
Assembling all in order due  
The consecrating rite to view.  
   The morning dawned with cloudless ray  
On Pushya's high auspicious day,  
And Cancer with benignant power  
Looked down on Ráma's natal hour.  
The twice-born chiefs, with zealous heed,  
Made ready what the rite would need.  
The well-wrought throne of holy wood  
And goldon urns in order stood.  
There was the royal chair whereon  
A tiger's skin resplendent shone;  
There water, brought for sprinkling thence  
When, in their sacred confluence,  
Blend. Jumná's waves with Gangá's tide,  
From many a holy flood beside,  
From brook and fountain far and near,  
From pool and river, sea and mere.  
And there were honey, curd, and oil,  
Parched rice and grass, the garden's spoil,  
Fresh milk, eight girls in bright attire,  
An elephant with eyes of tire;  
And urns of gold and silver made,  
With milky branches overlaid,  
All brimming from each sacred flood,  
And decked with many a lotus bud  

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>  

And dancing-women fair and free,  
Gay with their gems, were there to see,  
Who stood in bright apparel by  
With lovely brow and witching eye.  
White flashed the jewelled chouri there,  
And shone like moonbeams through the air;  
The white umbrella overhead  
A pale and moonlike lustre shed,  
Wont in pure splendour to precede,  
And in such rites the pomp to lead.  
There stood the charger by the side  
Of the great bull of snow-white hide;  
There was all music soft and loud,  
And bards and minstrels swelled the crowd.  
For now the monarch bade combine  
Each custom of his ancient line  
With every rite Ayodhyá's state  
Observed, her kings to consecrate.  

Then, summoned by the king's behest,  
The multitudes together pressed,  
And, missing still the royal sire,  
Began, impatient, to inquire:  
'Who to our lord will tidings bear  
That all his people throng the square?  
Where is the king? the sun is bright,  
And all is ready for the rite.'  

As thus they spoke, Sumantra, tried  
In counsel, to the chiefs replied,  
Gathered from lands on every side:  
'To Ráma's house I swiftly drave,  
For so the king his mandate gave.  
Our aged lord and Ráma too  
In honour high hold all of you:  
I in your words (be long your days!)  
Will ask him why he thus delays.'  

Thus spoke the peer in Scripture read,  
And to the ladies' bower he sped.  
Quick through the gates Sumantra hied,  
Which access ne'er to him denied.  
Behind the curtained screen he drew,  
Which veiled the chamber from the view.  
In benediction loud he raised  
His voice, and thus the monarch praised:  
'Sun, Moon, Kuvera, S'iva bless  
Kakutstha's son with high success!  
The Lords of air, flood, fire decree  
The victory, my King, to thee!  
The holy night has past away,  
Auspicious shines the morning's ray.  
Rise, Lord of men, thy part to take  
In the great rite. Awake! awake!  
Bráhmans and captains, chiefs of trade,  
All wait in festive garb arrayed;  
For thee they look with eager eyes:  
O Raghu's son, awake! arise.'  

To him in holy Scripture read,  
Who hailed him thus, the monarch said,  
Upraising from his sleep his head:  
'Go. Ráma hither lead as thou  
W (*illegible*) but now.  
Come, tell me why my mandate laid  
Upon thee thus is disobeyed.  
Away! and Ráma hither bring;  
I sleep not: make no tarrying.'  

Thus gave the king command anew:  
Sumantra from his lord withdrew;  
With head in lowly reverence bent,  
And filled with thoughts of joy, he went,  
The royal street he traversed, where  
Waved flag and pennon to the air,  
And, as with joy the car he drove,  
He let his eyes delighted rove.  
On every side, where'er he came,  
He heard glad words, their theme the same,  
As in their joy the gathered folk  
Of Ráma and the throning spoke.  
Then saw he Ráma's palace bright  
And vast as Mount Kailása's height,  
That glorious in its beauty showed  
As Indra's own supreme abode:  
With folding doors both high and wide;  
With hundred porches beautified:  
Where golden statues towering rose  
O'er gemmed and coralled porticoes  
Bright like a cave in Meru's side,  
Or clouds through Autumn's sky that ride:  
Festooned with length of bloomy twine,  
Flashing with pearls and jewels' shine,  
While sandal-wood and aloe lent  
The mingled riches of their scent;  
With all the odorous sweets that fill  
The breezy heights of Dardar's hill.  
There by the gate the Sáras screamed,  
And shrill-toned peacocks' plumage gleamed.  
Its floors with deftest art inlaid,  
Its sculptured wolves in gold arrayed,  
With its bright sheen the palace took  
The mind of man and chained the look,  
For like the sun and moon it glowed,  
And mocked Kuvera's loved abode.  
Circling the walls a crowd he viewed  
Who stood in reverent attitude,  
With throngs of countrymen who sought  
Acceptance of the gifts they brought.  
The elephant was stationed there,  
Appointed Ráma's self to bear;  
Adorned with pearls, his brow and cheek  
Were sandal-dyed in many a streak,  
While he, in stature, bulk, and pride,  
With Indra's own Airávat  <span id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_280) vied.  
Sumantra, borne by coursers fleet,  
Flashing a radiance o'er the street,  
   To Ráma's palace flew,  
And all who lined the royal road,  
Or thronged the prince's rich abode,  
   Rejoiced as near he drew.  
And with delight his bosom swelled  
As onward still his course he held  

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>  

   Through many a sumptuous court  
Like Indra's palace nobly made,  
Where peacocks revelled in the shade,  
   And beasts of silvan sort.  
Through many a hall and chamber wide,  
That with Kailása's splendour vied.  
   Or mansions of the Blest,  
While Ráma's friends, beloved and tried,  
Before his coming stepped aside,  
   Still on Sumantra pressed.  
He reached the chamber door, where stood  
Around his followers young and good,  
Bard, minstrel, charioteer,  
Well skilled the tuneful chords to sweep,  
With soothing strain to lull to sleep,  
   Or laud their master dear.  
Then, like a dolphin darting through  
Unfathomed depths of ocean's blue  
   With store of jewels decked,  
Through crowded halls that rock-like rose,  
Or as proud hills where clouds repose,  
   Sumantra sped unchecked--  
Halls like the glittering domes on high  
Reared for the dwellers of the sky  
   By heavenly architect.
