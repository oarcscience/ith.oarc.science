<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVII.: R&Aacute;MA ON THE HILL.</H3>
<P>
But when the solemn rite was o'er,<BR>
And bold Sugr&iacute;va reigned once more,<BR>
The sons of Rhaghu sought the hill,<BR>
Prasravan of the rushing rill,<BR>
Where roamed the tiger and the deer,<BR>
And lions raised their voice of fear;<BR>
Thick set with trees of every kind,<BR>
With trailing shrubs and plants entwined;<BR>
Home of the ape and monkey, lair<BR>
Of mountain cat and pard and bear,<BR>
In cloudy gloom against the sky<BR>
The sanctifying hills rose high.<BR>
Pierced in their crest, a spacious cave<BR>
To Raghu's sons a shelter gave.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, pure from every crime,<BR>
In words well suited to the time<BR>
To Lakshman spake, whose faithful zeal<BR>
Watched humbly for his brother's weal:<BR>
'I love this spacious cavern where<BR>
There breathes a fresh and pleasant air.<BR>
Brave brother, let us here remain<BR>
Throughout the season of the rain.<BR>
For in mine eyes this mountain crest<BR>
Is above all, the loveliest.<BR>
Where copper-hued and black and white<BR>
Show the huge blocks that face the height;<BR>
Where gleams the shine of varied ore,<BR>
Where dark clouds baog and torrents roar;<BR>
Where waving woods are fair to see,<BR>
And creepers climb from tree to tree;<BR>
Where the gay peacock's voice is shrill,<BR>
And sweet birds carol on the hill;<BR>
Where odorous breath is wafted far<BR>
From Jessamine and Sinduv&aacute;r; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_618"></A><A HREF="#fn_618"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And opening flowers of every hue<BR>
Give wondrous beauty to the view.<BR>
See, too, this pleasant water near<BR>
Our cavern home is fresh and clear;<BR>
And lilies gay with flower and bud<BR>
Are glorious on the lovely flood.<BR>
This cave that fares north and east<BR>
Will shelter us till rain has ceased;<BR>
And towering hills thut rise behind<BR>
Will screen us from the furious wind.<BR>
Close by the cavern's portal lies<BR>
And level stone of ample size<BR>
And sable hue, a mighty block<BR>
Long severed from the parent rock.<BR>
Now let thine eye bent northward rest<BR>

<P>

<P>
A while upon that mountain creat,<BR>
High as a cloud that brings the rain,<BR>
And dark as iron rent in twain.<BR>
Look southward, brother, now and view<BR>
A cloudy pile of paler hue<BR>
Like Mount Kail&aacute;sa's topmost height<BR>
Where ores of every tint are bright,<BR>
See, Lakshman, see before our cave<BR>
That clear brook eastward roll its wave<BR>
As though 'twere Ganga's infant rill<BR>
Down streaming from the three-peaked bill<BR>
See, by the water's gentle flow<BR>
As'oka, sal, and sandal grow.<BR>
And every lovely tree most fair<BR>
With leaf and bud and flower is there.<BR>
See there, beneath the bending trees<BR>
That fringe her bank, the river flees,<BR>
Clothed with their beauty like a maid<BR>
In all her robes and gems arrayed,<BR>
While from the sedgy banks are heard<BR>
The soft notes of each amorous bird.<BR>
O see what lovely islets stud<BR>
Like gems the bosom of the flood.<BR>
And s&aacute;rases and wild swans crowd<BR>
About her till she laughs aloud.<BR>
See, lotus blooms the brook o'erspread,<BR>
Some tender blue, some dazzling red,<BR>
And opening lilies white as snow<BR>
Their buds in rich profusion show.<BR>
There rings the joyous peacock's scream,<BR>
There stands the curlew by the stream,<BR>
And holy hermits love to throng<BR>
Where the sweet waters speed along.<BR>
Ranged on the grassy margin shine<BR>
Gay sandal trees in glittering line,<BR>
And all the wondrous verdure seems<BR>
The offspring of creative dreams,<BR>
O conquering Prince, there cannot be<BR>
A lovelier place than this we see.<BR>
Here sheltered on the beauteous height<BR>
Our days will pass in calm delight.<BR>

<P>
Nor is Kishkindh&aacute;'s city, gay<BR>
With grove and garden, far away.<BR>
Thence will the breeze of evening bring<BR>
Sweet music as the minstrels sing;<BR>
And, when the V&aacute;nars dance, will come<BR>
The sound of labour and of drum.<BR>
Again to spouse and realm restored.<BR>
Girt by his friends, the V&aacute;nar lord<BR>
Great glory has acquired; and how<BR>
Can he be less than happy now?'<BR>
This said, the son of Raghu made<BR>
His dwelling in that pleasant shade<BR>
Upon the mountain's shelving side<BR>
That sweetly all his wants supplied.<BR>
But still the hero's troubled mind<BR>
No comfort in his woe could find.<BR>
Yet mourning for his stolen wife<BR>
Dearer to R&aacute;ma than his life.<BR>
Chief when he saw the Lord of Night<BR>
Rise slowly o'er the eastern height,<BR>

<P>
He tossed upon his leafy  bed<BR>
With eyes by sleep unvisited.<BR>
Outwelled the tears in ceaseless flow,<BR>
And every sense was numbed by woe.<BR>
Each pang that pierced the mourner through<BR>
Smote Lakshman's faithful bosom too,<BR>
Who, troubled for his brother's sake,<BR>
With wisest words the prince bespake:<BR>
'Arise, my brother, and be strong:<BR>
Thy hero heart has mourned too long.<BR>
Thou knowest well that tears and sighs<BR>
Will mar the mightiest enterprise.<BR>
Thine was the soul that loved to dare:<BR>
To serve the Gods was still thy care;<BR>
And ne'er may sorrow's sting subdue<BR>
A heart so resolute and true.<BR>
How canst thou hope to slay in fight<BR>
The giant cruel in his might?<BR>
Unwearied must the champion be<BR>
Who strives with such a foe as he.<BR>
Tear out this sorrow by the root;<BR>
Again be bold and resolute.<BR>
Arise, my brother, and subdue<BR>
The demon and his wicked crew.<BR>
Thou canst destroy the earth, her seas,<BR>
Her rooted hills and giant trees<BR>
Unseated by thy furious hand:<BR>
And shall one fiend thy power withstand?<BR>
Wait through this season of the rain<BR>
Till suns of autumn dry the plain,<BR>
Then shall thy giant foe, and all<BR>
His host and realm, before thee fall.<BR>
I wake thy valour that has slept<BR>
Amid the tears thine eyes have wept;<BR>
As drops of oil in worship raise<BR>
The dormant flame to sudden blaze.'<BR>

<P>
The son of Raghu heard: he knew<BR>
His brother's rede was wise and true;<BR>
And, honouring his friendly guide,<BR>
In gentle words he thus replied:<BR>
'Whate'er a hero firm and bold,,<BR>
Devoted, true, and lofty-souled<BR>
Should speak by deep affection led,<BR>
Such are the words which thou hast said.<BR>
I cast away each pensive thought<BR>
That brings the noblest plans to naught,<BR>
And each uninjured power will strain<BR>
Until the purposed end we gain.<BR>
Thy prudent words will I obey,<BR>
And till the close of rain-time stay,<BR>
When King Sugr&iacute;va will invite<BR>
To action, and the streams be bright.<BR>
The hero saved in hour of need<BR>
Repays the debt with friendly deed:<BR>
But hated by the good are they<BR>
Who take the boon and ne'er repay.'<BR>
