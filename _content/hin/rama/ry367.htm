<P>
On the bare earth the lady sank,<BR>
And trembling from their presence shrank<BR>
Like a strayed fawn, when night is dark,<BR>
And hungry wolves around her bark.<BR>

Then to a shady tree she crept,<BR>
And thought upon her lord and wept.<BR>
By fear and bitter woe oppressed<BR>
She bathed the beauties of her breast<BR>
With her hot tears' incessant flow,<BR>
And found no respite from her woe.<BR>
As shakes a plantain in the breeze<BR>
She shook, and fell on trembling knees;<BR>
While at each demon's furious look<BR>
Her cheek its native hue forsook.<BR>
She lay and wept and made her moan<BR>
In sorrow's saddest undertone,<BR>
And, wild with grief, with fear appalled,<BR>
On R&aacute;ma and his brother called:<BR>
'O dear Kaus'aly&aacute;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_847"></A><A HREF="ry368.htm#fn_847"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> hear me cry!<BR>
Sweet Queen Sumitr&aacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_848"></A><A HREF="ry368.htm#fn_848"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, list my sigh!<BR>
True is the saw the wise declare:<BR>
Death comes not to relieve despair.<BR>
'Tis vain for dame or man to pray;<BR>
Death will not hear before his day;<BR>
Since I, from R&aacute;ma's sight debarred,<BR>
And tortured by my cruel guard,<BR>
Still live in hopeless woe to grieve<BR>
And loathe the life I may not leave.<BR>
Here, like a poor deserted thing,<BR>
My limbs upon the ground I fling,<BR>
And, like a bark beneath the blast,<BR>
Shall sink oppressed with woes at last.<BR>
Ah, blest are they, supremely blest,<BR>
Whose eyes upon my lord may rest;<BR>
Who mark his lion, port, and hear<BR>
His gentle speech that charms the ear.<BR>
Alas, what antenatal crime,<BR>
What trespass of forgotten time<BR>
Waighs on my soul, and bids me bow<BR>
Beneath this load of misery now?'<BR>
