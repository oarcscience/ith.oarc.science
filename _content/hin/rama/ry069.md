### CANTO LXIX.: DAS'ARATHA'S VISIT.

Soon as the shades of night had fled,  
Thus to the wise Sumantra said  
The happy king, while priest and peer,  
Each in his place, were standing near:  
'Let all my treasurers to-day,  
Set foremost in the long array,  
With gold and precious gems supplied  
In bounteous store, together ride.  
And send you out a mighty force,  
Foot, chariot, elephant, and horse.  
Besides, let many a car of state,  
And noblest steeds, my will await.  
Vas'ishtha, Vámadeva sage,  
And Márkandeya's reverend age,  
Jáváli, Kas'yap's godlike seed,  
And wise Kátyáyana, shall lead.  
Thy care, Sumantra, let it be  
To yoke a chariot now for me,  
That so we part without delay:  
These envoys hasten me away.'  

So fared he forth. That host, with speed,  
Quadruple, as the king decreed,  
With priests to head the bright array,  
Followed the monarch on his way.  
Four days they travelled on the road,  
And eve Videha's kingdom showed.  
Janak had left his royal seat  
The venerable king to greet,  
And, noblest, with these words addressed  
That noblest lord, his happy guest:  
'Hail, best of kings: a blessed fate  
Has led thee, Monarch, to my state.  
Thy sons, supreme in high emprise,  
Will gladden now their father's eyes.  
And high my fate, that hither leads  
Vas'ishtha, bright with holy deeds,  
Girt with these sages far-renowned,  
Like Indra with the Gods around.  
Joy! joy! for vanquished are my foes:  
Joy! for my house in glory grows,  
With Raghu's noblest sons allied,  
Supreme in strength and valour's pride.  
To-morrow with its early light  
Will shine on my completed rite.  
Then, sanctioned by the saints and thee,  
The marriage of thy Ráma see.'  

Then Das'aratha, best of those  
Whose speech in graceful order flows,  
With gathered saints on every side,  
Thus to the lord of earth replied:  
'A truth is this I long have known,  
A favour is the giver's own.  
What thou shalt bid, O good and true,  
We, as our power permits, will do.'  

That answer of the truthful lord,  
With virtuous worth and honour stored,  
Janak, Videha's noble king,  
Heard gladly, greatly marvelling.  
With bosoms filled with pleasure met  
Long-parted saint and anchoret,  
And linked in friendship's tie they spent  
The peaceful night in great content.  

Ráma and Lakshman thither sped,  
By sainted Vis'vámitra led,  
And bent in filial love to greet  
Their father, and embraced his feet.  
The aged king, rejoiced to hear  
And see again his children dear,  
Honoured by Janak's thoughtful care,  
With great enjoyment rested there.  
King Janak, with attentive heed,  
Consulted first his daughters' need,  
And ordered all to speed the rite;  
Then rested also for the night.
