<P>
There gleamed the car with wealth untold<BR>
Of precious gems and burnished gold;<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Nor could the Wind-God's son withdraw<BR>
His rapt gaze from the sight he saw,<BR>
By Vis'vakarm&aacute;'s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_817"></A><A HREF="ry351.htm#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> self proclaimed<BR>
The noblest work his hand had framed.<BR>
Uplifted in the air it glowed<BR>
Bright as the sun's diurnal road.<BR>
The eye might scan the wondrous frame<BR>
And vainly seek one spot to blame,<BR>
So fine was every part and fair<BR>
With gems inlaid with lavish care.<BR>
No precious stones so rich adorn<BR>
The cars wherein the Gods are borne,<BR>
Prize of the all-resistless might<BR>
That sprang from pain and penance rite, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_818"></A><A HREF="ry351.htm#fn_818"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Obedient to the master's will<BR>
It moved o'er wood and towering hill,<BR>
A glorious marvel well designed<BR>
By Vis'vakarm&aacute;'s artist mind,<BR>
Adorned with every fair device<BR>
That decks the cars of Paradise.<BR>
Swift moving as the master chose<BR>
It flew through air or sank or rose, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_819"></A><A HREF="ry351.htm#fn_819"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>
And in its fleetness left behind<BR>
The fury of the rushing wind:<BR>
Meet mansion for the good and great,<BR>
The holy, wise, and fortunate.<BR>
Throughout the chariot's vast extent<BR>
Were chambers wide and excellent,<BR>
All pure and lovely to the eyes<BR>
As moonlight shed from cloudless skies.<BR>
Fierce goblins, rovers of the night<BR>
Who cleft the clouds with swiftest flight<BR>
In countless hosts that chariot drew,<BR>
With earrings clashing as they flew.<BR>
