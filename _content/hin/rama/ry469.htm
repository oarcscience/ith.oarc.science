<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXIII.: INDRAJIT'S VICTORY.</H3>
<P>
But Indrajit the fierce and bold<BR>
With words like these his sire consoled:<BR>
'Dismiss, O King, thy grief and dread,<BR>
And be not thus disquieted.<BR>
Against this numbing sorrow strive,<BR>
For Indrajit is yet alive;<BR>
And none in battle may withstand<BR>
The fury of his strong right hand.<BR>
This day, O sire, thine eyes shall see<BR>
The sons of Raghu slain by me.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: he bade the king farewell:<BR>
Clear, mid the roar of drum and shell,<BR>
The clash of sword and harness rang<BR>
As to his car the warrior sprang.<BR>
Close followed by his R&aacute;kshas train<BR>
Through Lank&aacute;'s gate he reached the plain.<BR>
Then down he leapt, and bade a band<BR>
Of giants by the chariot stand:<BR>
Then with due rites, as rules require,<BR>
Did worship to the Lord of Fire.<BR>
The sacred oil, as texts ordain,<BR>
With wreaths of scented flowers and grain,<BR>
Within the flame in order due<BR>
That mightiest of the giants threw.<BR>
There on the ground were spear and blade<BR>
And arrowy leaves and fuel laid;<BR>
An iron ladle deep and wide,<BR>

<P>
And robes with sanguine colours dyed.<BR>
Beside him stood a sable goat:<BR>
The giant seized it by the throat,<BR>
And straight from the consuming flame<BR>
Auspicious signs of victory came.<BR>
For swiftly, curling to the right,<BR>
The fire leapt up with willing light<BR>
Undimmed by smoky cloud, and, red<BR>
Like gold, upon the offering fed.<BR>
They brought him, while the flame yet glowed,<BR>
The dart by Brahm&aacute;'s grace bestowed,<BR>
And all the arms he wielded well<BR>
Were charmed with text and holy spell.<BR>

<P>
Then fiercer for the fight he burned,<BR>
And at the foe his chariot turned,<BR>
While all his followers lifting high<BR>
Their maces charged with furious cry.<BR>
Dire, yet more dire the battle grew,<BR>
As rocks and trees and arrows flew.<BR>
The giant shot his shafts like rain,<BR>
And V&aacute;nars fell in myriads slain,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, Angad, N&iacute;la felt<BR>
The wounds his hurtling arrows dealt,<BR>
His shafts the blood of Gaya drank;<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n reeled and Mainda sank.<BR>
Bright as the glances of the sun<BR>
Came the swift darts they could not shun.<BR>
Caught in the arrowy nets he wove.<BR>
In vain the sons of Raghu strove;<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, by the darts oppressed,<BR>
His brother chieftain thus addressed:<BR>
'See, first this giant warrior sends<BR>
Destruction, mid our V&aacute;nar friends,<BR>
And now his arrows thick and fast<BR>
Their binding net around us cast.<BR>
To Brahm&aacute;'s grace the chieftain owes<BR>
The matchless power and might he shows;<BR>
And mortal strength in vain contends<BR>
With him whom Brahm&aacute;'s self befriends.<BR>
Then let us still with dauntless hearts<BR>
Endure this storm of pelting darts.<BR>
Soon must we sink bereaved of sense;<BR>
And then the victor, hurrying hence,<BR>
Will seek his father in his hall<BR>
And tell him of his foemen's fall.'<BR>
He ceased: o'erpowered by shaft and spell<BR>
The sons of Raghu reeled and fell.<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas on their bodies gazed;<BR>
And, mid the shouts his followers raised,<BR>
Sped back to Lank&aacute; to relate<BR>
In R&aacute;van's hall the princes' fate.<BR>
