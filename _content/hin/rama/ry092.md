### CANTO XIV.: RÁMA SUMMONED.

The wicked queen her speech renewed,  
When rolling on the earth she viewed  
Ikshváku's son, Ayodhyá's king,  
For his dear Ráma sorrowing:  
'Why, by a simple promise bound,  
Liest thou prostrate on the ground,  
As though a grievous sin dismayed  
Thy spirit! Why so sore afraid?  
Keep still thy word. The righteous deem  
That truth, mid duties, is supreme:  
And now in truth and honour's name  
I bid thee own the binding claim.  
S'aivya, a king whom earth obeyed,  
Onoe to a hawk a promise made,  
Gave to the bird his flesh and bone,  
And by his truth made heaven his own.  <span
id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_277)  
Alarka, when a Bráhman famed  
For Scripture lore his promise claimed,  
Tore from his head his bleeding eyes  
And unreluctant gave the prize.  
His narrow bounds prescribed restrain  
The Rivers' Lord, the mighty main,  
Who, though his waters boil and rave,  
Keeps faithful to the word he gave.  
Truth all religion comprehends,  
Through all the world its might extends:  
In truth alone is justice placed,  
On truth the words of God are based;  
A life in truth unchanging past  
Will bring the highest bliss at last  
If thou the right would still pursue,  
Be constant to thy word and true:  
Let me thy promise fruitful see,  
For boons, O King, proceed from thee.  
Now to preserve thy righteous fame,  
And yielding to my earnest claim--  
Thrice I repeat it--send thy child,  
Thy Ráma, to the forest wild.  
But if the boon thou still deny,  
Before thy face, forlorn, I die.'  

Thus was the helpless monarch stung  
By Queen Kaikeyí's fearless tongue,  
As Bali strove in vain to loose  
His limbs from Indra's fatal noose.  
Dismayed in soul and pale with fear,  
The monarch, like a trembling steer  
Between the chariot's wheel and yoke,  
Again to Queen Kaikeyí spoke,  
With sad eyes fixt in vacant stare,  
Gathering courage from despair:  
'That hand I took, thou sinful dame,  
With texts, before the sacred flame,  
Thee and thy son, I scorn and hate,  
And all at once repudiate.  

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>  

The night is fled: the dawn is near:  
Soon will the holy priests be here  
To bid me for the rite prepare  
That with my son the tnrone will share,  
The preparation made to grace  
My Ráma in his royal place--  
With this, e'en this, my darling for  
My death the funeral flood shall pour.  
Thou and thy son at least forbear  
In offerings to my shade to share,  
For by the plot thy guile has laid  
His consecration will be stayed.  
This very day how shall I brook  
To meet each subject's altered look?  
To mark each gloomy joyless brow  
That was so bright and glad but now?'  

While thus the high-souled monarch spoke  
To the stern queen, the Morning broke,  
And holy night had slowly fled,  
With moon and stars engarlanded.  
Yet once again the cruel queen  
Spoke words in answer fierce and keen,  
Still on her evil purpose bent,  
Wild with her rage and eloquent:  
'What speech is this? Such words as these  
Seem sprung from poison-sown disease.  
Quick to thy noble Ráma send  
And bid him on his sire attend.  
When to my son the rule is given;  
When Ráma to the woods is driven;  
When not a rival copes with me,  
From chains of duty thou art free.'  

Thus goaded, like a generous steed  
Urged by sharp spurs to double speed,  
'My senses are astray,' he cried,  
'And duty's bonds my hands have tied.  
I long to see mine eldest son,  
My virtuous, my beloved one.'  

And now the night had past away;  
Out shone the Maker of the Day,  
Bringing the planetary hour  
And moment of auspicious power.  
Vas'ishtha, virtuous, far renowned,  
Whose young disciples girt him round,  
With sacred things without delay  
Through the fair city took his way.  
He traversed, where the people thronged.  
And all for Ráma's coming longed,  
The town as fair in festive show  
As his who lays proud cities low.  <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_278)  
He reached the palace where he heard  
The mingled notes of many a bird,  
Where crowded thick high-honoured bands  
Of guards with truncheons in their hands.  
Begirt by many a sage, elate,  
Vas'ishtha reached the royal gate,  

And standing by the door he found  
Sumantra, for his form renowned,  
The king's illustrious charioteer  
And noble counsellor and peer.  
To him well skilled in every part  
Of his hereditary art  
Vas'ishtha said: 'O charioteer,  
Inform the king that I am here,  
Here ready by my side behold  
These sacred vessels made of gold,  
Which water for the rite contain  
From Gangá and each distant main.  
Here for installing I have brought  
The seat prescribed of fig-wood wrought,  
All kinds of seed and precious scent  
And many a gem and ornament;  
Grain, sacred grass, the garden's spoil,  
Honey and curds and milk and oil;  
Eight radiant maids, the best of all  
War elephants that feed in stall;  
A four-horse car, a bow and sword.  
A litter, men to bear their lord;  
A white umbrella bright and fair  
That with the moon may well compare;  
Two chouries of the whitest hair;  
A golden beaker rich and rare;  
A bull high-humped and fair to view,  
Girt with gold bands and white of hue;  
A four-toothed steed with flowing mane,  
A throne which lions carved sustain;  
A tiger's skin, the sacred fire,  
Fresh kindled, which the rites require;  
The best musicians skilled to play,  
And dancing-girls in raiment gay;  
Kine, Bráhmans, teachers fill the court,  
And bird and beast of purest sort.  
From town and village, far and near,  
The noblest men are gathered here;  
Here merchants with their followers crowd,  
And men in joyful converse loud,  
And kings from many a distant land  
To view the consecration stand.  
The dawn is come, the lucky day;  
Go bid the monarch haste away,  
That now Prince Ráma may obtain  
The empire, and begin his reign.'  

Soon as he heard the high behest  
The driver of the chariot pressed  
Within the chambers of the king,  
His lord with praises honouring.  
And none of all the warders checked  
His entrance for their great respect  
Of him well known, in place so high,  
Still fain their king to gratify.  
He stood beside the royal chief,  
Unwitting of his deadly grief,  
And with sweet words began to sing  
The praises of his lord and king:  
'As, when the sun begins to rise,  
The sparkling sea delights our eyes,  
Wake, calm with gentle soul, and thus  

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>  

Give rapture, mighty King, to us.  
As Mátali  <span id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_279) this selfsame hour  
Sang lauds of old to Indra's power,  
When he the Titan hosts o'erthrew,  
So hymn I thee with praises due.  
The Vedas, with their kindred lore,  
Brahma their soul-born Lord adore,  
With all the doctrines of the wise,  
And bid him, as I bid thee, rise.  
As, with the moon, the Lord of Day  
Wakes with the splendour of his ray  
Prolific Earth, who neath him lies,  
So, mighty King, I bid thee rise.  
With blissful words, O Lord of men,  
Rise, radiant in thy form, as when  
The sun ascending darts his light  
From Meru's everlasting height.  
May Œiva, Agni, Sun, and Moon  
Bestow on thee each choicest boon,  
Kuvera, Varun, Indra bless  
Kakutstha's son with all success.  
Awake, the holy night is fled,  
The happy light abroad is spread;  
Awake, O best of kings, and share  
The glorious task that claims thy care.  
The holy sage Vaœishtha waits,  
With all his Bráhmans, at the gate  
Give thy decree, without delay,  
To consecrate thy son today.  
As armies, by no captain led,  
As flocks that feed unshepherded,  
Such is the fortune of a state  
Without a king and desolate.'  
   Such were the words the bard addressed,  
With weight of sage advice impressed;  
And, as he heard, the hapless king  
Felt deeper yet his sorrow's sting.  
At length, all joy and comfort fled,  
He raised his eyes with weeping red,  
And, mournful for his Ráma's sake.  
The good and glorious monarch spake:  
'Why seek with idle praise to greet  
The wretch for whom no praise is meet!  
Thy words mine aching bosom tear,  
And plunge me deeper in despair.'  
   Sumantra heard the sad reply,  
And saw his master's tearful eye.  
With reverent palm to palm applied  
He drew a little space aside.  
Then, as the king, with misery weak,  
With vain endeavour strove to speak,  
Kaikeyí, skilled in plot and plan,  
To sage Sumantra thus began:  
'The king, absorbed in joyful thought  
For his dear son, no rest has sought:  
Sleepless to him the night has past,  
And now o'erwatched he sinks at last  
Then go, Sumantra, and with speed  

The glorious Ráma hither lead:  
Go, as I pray, nor longer wait;  
No time is this to hesitate.'  
   'How can I go, O Ladv fair,  
Unless my lord his will declare?'  
   'Fain would I see him,' cried the king,  
'Quick, quick, my beauteous Ráma bring.'  
   Then rose the happy thought to cheer  
The bosom of the charioteer,  
'The king, I ween, of pious mind.  
The consecration has designed.'  
Sumantra for his wisdom famed,  
Delighted with the thought he framed,  
From the calm chamber, like a bay  
Of crowded ocean, took his way.  
   He turned his face to neither side,  
    But forth he hurried straight;  
Only a little while he eyed  
The guards who kept the gate.  
He saw in front a gathered crowd  
  Of men of every class,  
Who, parting as he came, allowed  
  The charioteer to pass.
