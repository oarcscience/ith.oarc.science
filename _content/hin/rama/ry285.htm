<P>
'I doubt not, Prince, thy peerless might,<BR>
Armed with these shafts so keen and bright,<BR>
Like all-destroying fires of fate,<BR>
The worlds could burn and devastate.<BR>
But lend thou first thy mind and ear<BR>
Of B&aacute;li's power and might to hear.<BR>
How bold, how firm, in battle tried,<BR>
Is B&aacute;li's heart; and then decide.<BR>
From east to west, from south to north<BR>
On restless errand hunting forth,<BR>

<P>
From farthest sea to sea he flies<BR>
Before the sun has lit the skies.<BR>
A mountain top he oft will seek.<BR>
Tear from its root a towering peak.<BR>
Hurl it aloft, as 'twere a ball,<BR>
And catch it ere to earth it fall.<BR>
And many a tree that long has stood<BR>
In health and vigour in the wood,<BR>
His single arm to earth will throw,<BR>
The marvels of his might to show.<BR>
Shaped like a bull, a monster bore<BR>
The name of Dundubhi of yore:<BR>
He matched in size a mountain height,<BR>
A thousand elephants in might.<BR>
By pride of wondrous gifts impelled,<BR>
And strength he deemed unparalleled,<BR>
To Ocean, lord of stream and brook,<BR>
Athirst for war, his way he took.<BR>
He reached the king of rolling waves<BR>
Whose gems are piled in sunless caves,<BR>
And threw his challenge to the sea;<BR>
'Come forth, O King, and fight with me.'<BR>
He spoke, and from his ocean bed<BR>
The righteous &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> monarch heaved his head,<BR>
And gave, sedate, his calm reply<BR>
To him whom fate impelled to die:<BR>
'Not mine, not mine the power,' he cried,<BR>
'To cope with thee in battle tried;<BR>
But listen to my voice, and seek<BR>
The worthier foe of whom I speak.<BR>
The Lord of Hills, where hermits live<BR>
And love the home his forests give,<BR>
Whose child is S'ankar's darling queen, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_569"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The King of Snows is he I mean.<BR>
Deep caves has he, and dark boughs shade<BR>
The torrent and the wild cascade.<BR>
From him expect the fierce delight<BR>
Which heroes feel in equal fight.'<BR>
He deemed that fear checked ocean's king,<BR>
And, like an arrow from the string,<BR>
To the wild woods that clothe the side<BR>
Of Lord Him&aacute;laya's hills he hied.<BR>
Then Dundubhi, with hideous roar.<BR>
Huge fragments from the summit tore<BR>
Vast as Air&aacute;vat, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_570"></A><A HREF="#fn_570"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> white with snow,<BR>
And hurled them to the plains below.<BR>
Then like a white cloud soft, serene.<BR>
The Lord of Mountains' form was seen.<BR>
It sat upon a lofty crest.<BR>
And thus the furious fiend addressed:<BR>
'Beseems thee not, O virtue's friend,<BR>
My mountain tops to rive and rend;<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_336"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 336</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
For I, the hermit's calm retreat,<BR>
For deeds of war am all unmeet,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The demon's eye with rage grew red,<BR>
And thus in furious tone he said:<BR>
'If thou from fear or sloth decline<BR>
To match thy strength in war with mine,<BR>
Where shall I find a champion, say,<BR>
To meet me burning for the fray?'<BR>
He spoke: Him&aacute;laya, skilled in lore<BR>
Of eloquence, replied once more,<BR>
And, angered in his righteous mind,<BR>
Addressed the chief of demon kind:<BR>
'The V&aacute;nar B&aacute;li, brave and wise,<BR>
Son of the God who rules the sides,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_571"></A><A HREF="#fn_571"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Sways, glorious in his high renown,<BR>
Kishkindh&aacute; his imperial town.<BR>
Well may that valiant lord who knows<BR>
Each art of war his might oppose<BR>
To thine, in equal battle set,<BR>
As Namuehi &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_572"></A><A HREF="#fn_572"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and Indra met.<BR>
Go, if thy soul desire the fray;<BR>
To B&aacute;li's city speed away,<BR>
And that uoconquered hero meet<BR>
Whose fame is high for warlike feat.'<BR>
He listened to the Lord of Snow,<BR>
And, his proud heart with rage aglow,<BR>
Sped swift away and lighted down<BR>
By vast Kishkindh&aacute;, B&aacute;li's town.<BR>
With pointed horns to strike and gore<BR>
The semblance of a bull he bore,<BR>
Huge as a cloud that downward bends<BR>
Ere the full flood of rain descends.<BR>
Impelled by pride and rage and hate,<BR>
He thundered at Kishkindh&aacute;'s gate;<BR>
And with his bellowing, like the sound<BR>
Of pealing drums, he shook the ground,<BR>
He rent the earth and prostrate threw<BR>
The trees that near the portal grew.<BR>
King B&aacute;li from the bowers within<BR>
Indignant heard the roar and din.<BR>
Then, moonlike mid the stars, with all<BR>
His dames he hurried to the wall;<BR>
And to the fiend this speech, expressed<BR>
In clear and measured words, addressed:<BR>
'Know me for monarch. B&aacute;li styled,<BR>
Of V&aacute;nar tribes that roam the wild.<BR>
Say why dost thou this gate molest,<BR>
And bellowing thus disturb our rest?<BR>
I know thee, mighty fiend: beware<BR>
And guard thy life with wiser care.'<BR>
He spoke: and thus the fiend returned,<BR>
While red with rage his eyeballs burned:<BR>
'What! speak when all thy dames are nigh<BR>
And hero-like thy foe defy?<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Come, meet me in the fight this day,<BR>
And learn my strength by bold assay.<BR>
Or shall I spare tbee, and relent<BR>
Until the coming night be spent?<BR>
Take then the respite of a night<BR>
And yield thee to each soft delight.<BR>
Then, monarch of the V&aacute;nar race.<BR>
With loving arms thy friends embrace.<BR>
Gifts on thy faithful lords bestow,<BR>
Bid each and all farewell, and go.<BR>
Show in the streets once more thy face,<BR>
Instal thy son to fill thy place.<BR>
Dally a while with each dear dame;<BR>
And then my strength thy pride shall tame<BR>
For, should I smite thee drunk with wine<BR>
Enamoured of those dames of thine,<BR>
Beneath diseases bowed and bent,<BR>
Or weak, unarmed, or negligent,<BR>
My deed would merit hate and scorn<BR>
As his who slays the child unborn.'<BR>
Then B&aacute;li's soul with rage was tired,<BR>
Queen T&aacute;r&aacute; and the dames retired;<BR>
And slowly, with a laugh of pride,<BR>
The king of V&aacute;nars thus replied:<BR>
'Me, fiend, thou deemest drunk with wine:<BR>
Unless thy fear the fight decline,<BR>
Come, meet me in the fray, and test<BR>
The spirit of my valiant breast.'<BR>
He spoke in wrath and high disdain;<BR>
And, laying down his golden chain,<BR>
Gift of his sire Mahendra, dared<BR>
The demon, for the fray prepared;<BR>
Seized by the horns the monster, vast<BR>
As a huge hill, and held him fast,<BR>
Then fiercely dragged him round and round,<BR>
And, shouting, hurled him to the ground.<BR>
Blood streaming from his ears, he rose,<BR>
And wild with fury strove the foes.<BR>
Then B&aacute;li, match for Indra's might,<BR>
With every arm renewed the fight.<BR>
He fought with fists, and feet, and knees,<BR>
With fragments of the rock, and trees.<BR>
At last the monster's strength, assailed<BR>
By S'akra's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_573"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> conquering offspring, failed.<BR>
Him Bali raised with mighty strain.<BR>
And dashed upon the ground again;<BR>
Where, bruised and shattered, in a tide<BR>
Of rushing blood, the demon died.<BR>
King B&aacute;li saw the lifeless corse,<BR>
And bending, with tremendous force<BR>
Raised the huge bulk from where it lay,<BR>
And hurled it full a league away.<BR>
As through the air the body flew,<BR>
Some blood-drops, caught by gales that blew,<BR>
Welled from his shattered jaw and fell<BR>
By Saint Matanga's hermit cell:<BR>
Matanga saw, illustrious sage,<BR>
Those drops defile his hermitage,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_337"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 337</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And, as he marvelled whence they came,<BR>
Fierce anger filled his soul with flame:<BR>
'Who is the villain, evil-souled,<BR>
With childish thoughts unwise and bold,<BR>
Who is the impious wretch,' he cried,<BR>
'By whom my grove with blood is dyed?'<BR>

<P>
Thus spoke Matanga in his rage,<BR>
And hastened from the hermitage,<BR>
When lo, before his wondering eyes<BR>
Lay the dead bull of mountain size<BR>
His hermit soul was nothing slow<BR>
The doer of the deed to know,<BR>
And thus the V&aacute;nar in a burst<BR>
Of wild tempestuous wrath he cursed:<BR>
'Ne'er let that V&aacute;nar wander here,<BR>
For, if he come, his death is near.<BR>
Whose impious hand with blood has dyed<BR>
The holy place where I abide,<BR>
Who threw this demon corse and made<BR>
A ruin of the pleasant shade.<BR>
If e'er he plant his wicked feet<BR>
Within one league of my retreat;<BR>
Yea, if the villain come so nigh<BR>
That very hour he needs must die.<BR>
And let the V&aacute;nar lords who dwell<BR>
In the dark woods that skirt my cell<BR>
Obey my words, and speeding hence<BR>
Find them some meeter residence.<BR>
Here if they dare to stay, on all<BR>
The terrors of my curse shall fall.<BR>
They spoil the tender saplings, dear<BR>
As children which I cherish here,<BR>
Mar root and branch and leaf and spray,<BR>
And steal the ripening fruit away.<BR>
One day I grant, no further hour,<BR>
To-morrow shall my curse have power,<BR>
And then each V&aacute;nar I may see<BR>
A stone through countless years shall be.'<BR>
The V&aacute;nars heard the curse and hied<BR>
From sheltering wood and mountain side.<BR>
King B&aacute;li marked their haste and dread,<BR>
And to the flying leaders said:<BR>
'Speak, V&aacute;nar chiefs, and tell me why<BR>
From Saint Matanga's grove ye fly<BR>
To gather round me: is it well<BR>
With all who in those woodlands dwell?'<BR>
He spoke: the V&aacute;nar leaders told<BR>
King B&aacute;li with his chain of gold<BR>
What curse the saint had on them laid,<BR>
Which drove them from their ancient shade.<BR>
Then royal B&aacute;li sought the sage,<BR>
With reverent hands to soothe his rage.<BR>
The holy man his suppliant spurned,<BR>
And to his cell in anger turned.<BR>
That curse on B&aacute;li sorely pressed.<BR>
And long his conscious soul distressed.<BR>
Him still the curse and terror keep<BR>
Afar from Rishyam&uacute;ka's steep.<BR>
He dares not to the grove draw nigh,<BR>
Nay scarce will hither turn his eye.<BR>
We know what terrors warm him hence,<BR>
And roam these woods in confidence.<BR>
Look, Prince, before thee white and dry<BR>
The demon's bones uncovered lie,<BR>
Who, like a hill in bulk and length,<BR>
Fell ruind for his pride of strength.<BR>
See those high S&aacute;l trees seven in row<BR>
That droop their mighty branches low,<BR>
These at one grasp would B&aacute;li seize,<BR>
And leafless shake the trembling trees.<BR>
These tales I tell, O Prince, to show<BR>
The matchless power that arms the foe.<BR>
How canst thou hope to slay him? how<BR>
Meet B&aacute;li in the battle now?'<BR>

<P>
Sugr&iacute;va spoke and sadly sighed:<BR>
And Lakshman with a laugh replied:<BR>
'What show of power, what proof and test<BR>
May still the doubts that fill thy breast?'<BR>

<P>
He spoke. Sugr&iacute;va thus replied:<BR>
'See yonder S&aacute;l trees side by side.<BR>
King B&aacute;li here would take his stand<BR>
Grasping his bow with vigorous hand,<BR>
And every arrow, keen and true.<BR>
Would strike its tree and pierce it through<BR>
If R&aacute;ma now his bow will bend,<BR>
And through one trunk an arrow send;<BR>
Or if his arm can raise and throw<BR>
Two hundred measures of his bow,<BR>
Grasped by a foot and hurled through air,<BR>
The demon bull that moulders there,<BR>
My heart will own his might and fain<BR>
Believe my foe already slain.'<BR>

<P>
Sugr&iacute;va spoke inflamed with ire,<BR>
Scanned R&aacute;ma with a glance of fire,<BR>
Pondered a while in silent mood.<BR>
And thus again his speech renewed:<BR>
'All lands with B&aacute;li's glories ring,<BR>
A valiant, strong, and mighty king;<BR>
In conscious power unused to yield;<BR>
A hero first in every field.<BR>
His wondrous deeds his might declare,<BR>
Deeds Gods might scarcely do or dare;<BR>
And on this power reflecting still<BR>
I roam on Rishyam&uacute;ka's hill.<BR>
Awed by my brother's might I rove,<BR>
In doubt and fear, from grove to grove,<BR>
While Hanum&aacute;n, my chosen friend,<BR>
And faithful lords my steps attend;<BR>
And now, O true to friendship's tie,<BR>
I hail in thee my best ally.<BR>
My surest refuge from my foes,<BR>
And steadfast as the Lord of Snows.<BR>
Still, when I muse how strong and bold<BR>
Is cruel B&aacute;li, evil-souled,<BR>
But ne'er, O chief of Raghu's line,<BR>
Have seen what strength in war is thine,<BR>
Though in my heart I may not dare<BR>
Doubt thy great might, despise, compare,<BR>
Thoughts of his fearful deeds will rise<BR>
And fill my soul with sad surmise.<BR>
Speech, form, and trust which naught may move<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_338"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 338</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Thy secret strength and glory prove,<BR>
As smouldering ashes dimly show<BR>
The dormant fires that live below.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: and R&aacute;ma answered, while<BR>
Played o'er his lips a gracious smile:<BR>
'Not yet convinced? This clear assay<BR>
Shall drive each lingering doubt away.'<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma spoke his heart to cheer,<BR>
To Dundubhi's vast frame drew near:<BR>
He touched it with his foot in play<BR>
And sent it twenty leagues away.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va marked what easy force<BR>
Hurled through the air that demon's corse<BR>
Whose mighty bones were white and dried,<BR>
And to the son of Raghu cried:<BR>
'My brother B&aacute;li, when his might<BR>
Was drunk and weary from the fight,<BR>
Hurled forth the monster body, fresh<BR>
With skin and sinews, blood and flesh.<BR>
Now flesh and blood are dried away.<BR>
The crumbling bones are light as hay,<BR>
Which thou, O Raghu's son, hast sent<BR>
Flying through air in merriment.<BR>
This test alone is weak to show<BR>
If thou be stronger or the foe.<BR>
By thee a heap of mouldering bone,<BR>
By him the recent corse was thrown.<BR>
Thy strength, O Prince, is yet untried:<BR>
Come, pierce one tree: let this decide.<BR>
Prepare thy ponderous bow and bring<BR>
Close to thine ear the straining string.<BR>
On yonder S&aacute;l tree fix thine eye,<BR>
And let the mighty arrow fly,<BR>
I doubt not, chief, that I shall see<BR>
Thy pointed shaft transfix the tree.<BR>
Then come, assay the easy task,<BR>
And do for love the thing I ask.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Best of all lights, the Day-God fills<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With glory earth and sky:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Him&aacute;laya is the lord of hills<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That heave their heads on high.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The royal lion is the best<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of beasts that tread the earth;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And thou, O hero, art confessed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    First in heroic worth.'<BR>
