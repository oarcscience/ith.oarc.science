<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXIX.: NAR&Aacute;NTAK'S DEATH.</H3>
<P>
Pierced to the soul by sorrow's sting<BR>
Thus wailed the evil-hearted king.<BR>
Then Tris'iras stood forth and cried:<BR>
'Yea, father, he has fought and died,<BR>
Our bravest: and the loss is sore:<BR>
But rouse thee, and lament no more.<BR>
Hast thou not still thy coat of mail,<BR>
Thy bow and shafts which never fail?<BR>
A thousand asses draw thy car<BR>
Which roars like thunder heard afar.<BR>
Thy valour and thy warrior skill,<BR>
Thy God-given strength, are left thee still.<BR>
Unarmed, thy matchless might subdued<BR>
The Gods and Da'nav multitude.<BR>
Armed with thy glorious weapons, how<BR>
Shall Raghu's son oppose thee now?<BR>
Or, sire, within thy palace stay;<BR>
And I myself will sweep away<BR>
Thy foes, like Gar&uacute;d when he makes<BR>
A banquet of the writhing snakes<BR>
Soon Raghu's son shall press the plain,<BR>
As Narak &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1001"></A><A HREF="#fn_1001"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> fell by Vishnu slain,<BR>
Or S'ambar &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1002"></A><A HREF="#fn_1002"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in rebellious pride<BR>
Who met the King of Gods &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1003"></A><A HREF="#fn_1003"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and died.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The monarch heard: his courage grew,<BR>
And life and spirit came anew.<BR>
Dev&aacute;ntak and Nar&aacute;ntak heard,<BR>
And their fierce souls with joy were stirred;<BR>
And Atik&aacute;ya &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1004"></A><A HREF="#fn_1004"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> burned to fight,<BR>
And heard the summons with delight;<BR>
While from the rest loud rang the cry,<BR>
'I too will fight,' 'and I,' 'and I.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The joyous king his sons embraced,<BR>
With gold and chains and jewels graced,<BR>
And sent them forth with stirring speech<BR>
Of benison and praise to each.<BR>
Forth from the gate the princes sped<BR>
And ranged for war the troops they led.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar legions charged anew.<BR>
And trees and rocks for missiles flew.<BR>
They saw Nar&aacute;ntak's mighty form<BR>
Borne on a steed that mocked the storm.<BR>
To check his charge in vain they strove:<BR>
Straight through their host his way he clove,<BR>
As springs a dolphin through the tide:<BR>
And countless V&aacute;nars fell and died,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And mangled limbs and corpses lay<BR>
To mark the chief's ensanguined way,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;v&aacute; saw them fall or fly<BR>
When fierce Nar&aacute;ntak's steed was nigh,<BR>
And marked the giant where he sped<BR>
O'er heaps of dying or of dead.<BR>
He bade the royal Angad face<BR>
That bravest chief of giant race.<BR>
As springs the sun from clouds dispersed,<BR>
So Angad from the V&aacute;nars burst.<BR>
No weapon for the fight he bore<BR>
Save nails and teeth, and sought no more.<BR>
'Leave, giant chieftain,' thus he spoke,<BR>
'Leave foes unworthy of thy stroke,<BR>
And bend against a nobler heart<BR>
The terrors of thy deadly dart.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nar&aacute;ntak heard the words he spake:<BR>
Fast breathing, like an angry snake,<BR>
With bloody teeth his lips he pressed<BR>
And hurled his dart at Angad's breast.<BR>
True was the aim and fierce the stroke,<BR>
Yet on his breast the missile broke.<BR>
Then Angad at the giant flew.<BR>
And with a blow his courser slew:<BR>
The fierce hand crushed through flesh and bone,<BR>
And steed and rider fell o'erthrown.<BR>
Nar&aacute;ntak's eyes with fury blazed:<BR>
His heavy hand on high he raised<BR>
And struck in savage wrath the head<BR>
Of B&aacute;li's son, who reeled and bled,<BR>
Fainted a moment and no more:<BR>
Then stronger, fiercer than before<BR>
Smote with that fist which naught could stay,<BR>
And crushed to death the giant lay.<BR>
