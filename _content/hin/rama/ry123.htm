<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLV.: THE TAMAS&Aacute;.</H3>
<P>
Their tender love the people drew<BR>
To follow R&aacute;ma brave and true,<BR>
The high-souled hero, as he went<BR>
Forth from his home to banishment.<BR>
The king himself his friends obeyed,<BR>
And turned him homeward as they prayed.<BR>
But yet the people turned not back,<BR>
Still close on R&aacute;ma's chariot track.<BR>
For they who in Ayodhy&aacute; dwelt<BR>
For him such fond affection felt,<BR>
Decked with all grace and glories high,<BR>
The dear full moon of every eye.<BR>
Though much his people prayed and wept,<BR>
Kakutstha's son his purpose kept,<BR>
And still his journey would pursue<BR>
To keep the king his father true.<BR>
Deep in the hero's bosom sank<BR>
Their love, whose signs his glad eye drank.<BR>
He spoke to cheer them, as his own<BR>
Dear children, in a loving tone:<BR>
'If ye would grant my fond desire,<BR>
Give Bharat now that love entire<BR>
And reverence shown to me by all<BR>
Who dwell within Ayodhy&aacute;'s wall.<BR>
For he, Kaikey&iacute;'s darling son,<BR>
His virtuous career will run,<BR>
And ever bound by duty's chain<BR>
Consult your weal and bliss and gain.<BR>
In judgment old, in years a child,<BR>
With hero virtues meek and mild,<BR>
A fitting lord is he to cheer<BR>
His people and remove their fear.<BR>
In him all kingly gifts abound,<BR>
Wore noble than in me are found:<BR>
Imperial prince, well proved and tried--<BR>
Obey him as your lord and guide.<BR>
And grant, I pray, the boon I ask:<BR>
To please the king be still your task,<BR>
That his fond heart, while I remain<BR>
Far in the wood, may feel no pain.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The more he showed his will to tread<BR>
The path where filial duty led,<BR>
The more the people, round him thronged,<BR>
For their dear R&aacute;ma's empire longed.<BR>
Still more attached his followers grew,<BR>
As R&aacute;ma, with his brother, drew<BR>
The people with his virtues' ties,<BR>
Lamenting all with tear-dimmed eyes.<BR>
The saintly twice-born, triply old<BR>
In glory, knowledge, seasons told,<BR>
With hoary heads that shook and bowed,<BR>
Their voices raised and spake aloud:<BR>
'O steeds, who best and noblest are,<BR>
Who whirl so swiftly R&aacute;ma's car,<BR>
Go not, return: we call on you:<BR>
Be to your master kind and true.<BR>
For speechless things are swift to hear,<BR>
And naught can match a horse's ear.<BR>
O generous steeds, return, when thus<BR>
You hear the cry of all of us.<BR>
Each vow he keeps most firm and sure,<BR>
And duty makes his spirit pure.<BR>
Back with our chief! not wood-ward hence;<BR>
Back to his royal residence!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Soon as he saw the aged band.<BR>
Exclaiming in their misery, stand,<BR>
And their sad cries around him rang,<BR>
Swift from his chariot R&aacute;ma sprang.<BR>
Then, still upon his journey bent,<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; and with Lakshman went<BR>
The hero by the old men's side<BR>
Suiting to theirs his shortened stride.<BR>
He could not pass the twice-born throng<BR>
As weariedly they walked along:<BR>
With pitying heart, with tender eye,<BR>
He could not in his chariot fly.<BR>
When the steps of R&aacute;ma viewed<BR>
That still his onward course pursued.<BR>
Woe shook the troubled heart of each,<BR>
And burnt with grief they spoke this speech--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'With thee, O R&aacute;ma, to the wood<BR>
All Br&aacute;hmans go and Br&aacute;hmanhood:<BR>
Borne on our aged shoulders, see,<BR>
Our fires of worship go with thee.<BR>
Bright canopies that lend their shade<BR>
In Vajapeya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_319"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> rites displayed,<BR>
In plenteous store are borne behind<BR>
Like cloudlets in the autumn wind.<BR>
No shelter from the sun hast thou,<BR>
And, lest his fury burn thy brow,<BR>
These sacrificial shades we bear<BR>
Shall aid thee in the noontide glare.<BR>
Our hearts, who ever loved to pore<BR>
On sacred text and Vedic lore,<BR>
Now all to thee, beloved, turn,<BR>
And for a life in forests yearn.<BR>
Deep in our aged bosoms lies<BR>
The Vedas' lore, the wealth we prize,<BR>
There still, like wives at home, shall dwell,<BR>
Whose love and truth protect them well.<BR>

<P>
To follow thee our hearts are bent;<BR>
We need not plan or argument.<BR>
All else in duty's law we slight,<BR>
For following thee is following right.<BR>
O noble Prince, retrace thy way:<BR>
O, hear us, R&aacute;ma, as we lay,<BR>
With many tears and many prayers,<BR>
Our aged heads and swan-white hairs<BR>
Low in the dust before thy feet;<BR>
O, hear us, R&aacute;ma, we entreat.<BR>
Full many of these who with thee run,<BR>
Their sacred rites had just begun.<BR>
Unfinished yet those rites remain;<BR>
But finished if thou turn again.<BR>
All rooted life and things that move<BR>
To thee their deep affection prove.<BR>
To them, when warmed by love, they glow<BR>
And sue to thee, some favour show<BR>
Each lowly bush, each towering tree<BR>
Would follow too for love of thee.<BR>
Bound by its root it must remain;<BR>
But--all it can--its boughs complain,<BR>
As when the wild wind rushes by<BR>
It tells its woe in groan and sigh.<BR>
No more through air the gay birds flit,<BR>
But, foodless, melancholy sit<BR>
Together on the branch and call<BR>
To thee whose kind heart feels for all.'<BR>

<P>
As wailed the aged Br&aacute;hmans, bent<BR>
To turn him back, with wild lament,<BR>
Seemed Tamas&aacute; herself to aid,<BR>
Checking his progress, as they prayed.<BR>
Sumantra from the chariot freed<BR>
With ready hand each weary steed;<BR>
He groomed them with the utmost heed,<BR>

<P>
Their limbs he bathed and dried,<BR>
Then led them forth to drink and feed<BR>
At pleasure in the grassy mead<BR>
That fringed the river side.<BR>
