<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XL.: R&Aacute;VAN'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
But R&aacute;van soorned the rede he gave<BR>
In timely words to warn and save,<BR>
E'en as the wretch who hates to live<BR>
Rejects the herb the leeches give.<BR>
By fate to sin and ruin spurred,<BR>
That sage advice the giant heard,<BR>
Then in reproaches hard and stern<BR>
Thus to M&aacute;r&iacute;cha spoke in turn:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Is this thy counsel, weak and base,<BR>
Unworthy of thy giant race?<BR>
Thy speech is fruitless, vain, thy toil<BR>
Like casting seed on barren soil.<BR>
No words of thine shall drive me back<BR>
From R&aacute;ma and the swift attack.<BR>
A fool is he, inured to sin.<BR>
And more, of human origin.<BR>
The craven, at a woman's call<BR>
To leave his sire, his mother, all<BR>
The friends he loved, the power and sway.<BR>
And hasten to the woods away!<BR>
But now his anger will I rouse,<BR>
Stealing away his darling spouse.<BR>
I in thy sight will ravish her<BR>
From Khara's cruel murderer.<BR>
Upon this plan my soul is bent,<BR>
And naught shall move my firm intent,<BR>
Not if the way through demons led<BR>
And Gods with Indra at their head.<BR>
'Tis thine, when questioned, to explain<BR>
The hope and fear, the loss and gain,<BR>
And, when thy king thy thoughts would know,<BR>
The triumph or the danger show.<BR>
A prudent counsellor should wait,<BR>
And speak when ordered in debate,<BR>
With hands uplifted, calm and meek,<BR>
If honour and reward he seek.<BR>
Or, when some prudent course he sees<BR>
Which, spoken, may his king displease<BR>

<P>
He should by hints of dexterous art<BR>
His counsel to his lord impart.<BR>
But prudent words are said in vain<BR>
When the blunt speech brings grief and pain.<BR>
A high-souled king will scarcely thank<BR>
The man who shames his royal rank.<BR>
Five are the shapes that kings assume,<BR>
Of majesty, of grace, and gloom:<BR>
Like Indra now, or Agni, now<BR>
Like the dear Moon, with placid brow:<BR>
Like mighty Varun now they show,<BR>
Now fierce as He who rules below.<BR>
O giant, monarchs lofty-souled<BR>
Are kind and gentle, stern and bold,<BR>
With gracious love their gifts dispense<BR>
And swiftly punish each offence.<BR>
Thus subjects should their rulers view<BR>
With all respect and honour due.<BR>
But folly leads thy heart to slight<BR>
Thy monarch and neglect his right.<BR>
Thou hast in lawless pride addressed<BR>
With bitter words thy royal guest.<BR>
I asked thee not my strength to scan,<BR>
Or [*} and profit in the plan.<BR>
I only spoke to tell the deed<BR>
O mighty one, by me decreed,<BR>
And bid thee in the peril lend<BR>
Thy succour in support thy friend.<BR>
Hear me again, and I will tell<BR>
How thou canst aid my venture well.<BR>
In semblance of a golden deer<BR>
Adorned with silver drops, appear:<BR>
And near the cottage in the way<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma and his consort stray.<BR>
Draw nigh, and wandering through the brake<BR>
With thy strange form her fancy take.<BR>
The Maithil dame with wondering eyes<BR>
Will took upon thy fair disguise,<BR>
And quickly bid her husband go<BR>
And bring the deer that charms her so,<BR>
When Raghu's son has left the place,<BR>
Still pressing onward in the chase,<BR>
Cry out, 'O Lakshman! Ah, mine own!'<BR>
With voice resembling R&aacute;ma's tone.<BR>
When Lakshman hears his brother's cry,<BR>
Impelled by Sit&aacute; he will fly,<BR>
Restless with eager love, to aid<BR>
The hunter in the distant shade.<BR>
When both her guards have left her side,<BR>
Even as Indra, thousand-eyed,<BR>
Clasps Sachi, will I bear away<BR>
The Maithil dame an easy prey.<BR>
When thou, my friend, this aid hast lent,<BR>
Go where thou wilt and live content.<BR>
True servant, faithful to thy vow,<BR>
With [*half?} my realm I thee endow.<BR>
Go forth, may luck thy way attend<BR>
That leads thee to the happy end.<BR>
[I:ii m.,ir v}, will quickly be<BR>

<P>
In Dandak wood, and follow thee.<BR>
So will I cheat this R&aacute;ma's eyes<BR>
And win without a blow the prize;<BR>
And safe return to Lank&aacute;'s town<BR>
With thee, my friend, this day shall crown.<BR>
But if thou wilt not aid my will,<BR>
My band this day thy blood shall spill.<BR>
Yea, thou must share the destined task,<BR>
For force will take the help I ask.<BR>
No bliss that rebel's life attends<BR>
Whose stubborn will his lord offends.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy life, if thou the task assay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    jeopardy may stand;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Oppose me, and this very day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thou diest by this hand.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now ponder all that thou hast heard<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Within thy prudent breast:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Reflect with care on every word,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And do what seems the best.'<BR>
