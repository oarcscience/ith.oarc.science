<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIX.: R&Aacute;MA'S PROMISE.</H3>
<P>
Calm and unmoved by threatened woe<BR>
The noble conqueror of the foe<BR>
Answered the cruel words she spoke,<BR>
Nor quailed beneath the murderous stroke:<BR>

<P>
Yea, for my father's promise sake<BR>
I to the wood my way will take,<BR>
And dwell a lonely exile there<BR>
In hermit dress with matted hair.<BR>
One thing alone I fain would learn,<BR>
Why is the king this day so stern?<BR>
Why is the scourge of foes so cold,<BR>
Nor gives me greeting as of old?<BR>
Now let not anger flush thy cheek:<BR>
Before thy face the truth I speak,<BR>
In hermit's coat with matted hair<BR>
To the wild wood will I repair.<BR>
How can I fail his will to do,<BR>
Friend, master, grateful sovereign too?<BR>
One only pang consumes my breast.<BR>
That his own lips have not expressed<BR>
His will, nor made his longing known<BR>
That Bharat should ascend the throne.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
To Bharat I would yield my wife,<BR>
My realm and wealth, mine own dear life,<BR>
Unasked I fain would yield them all:<BR>
More gladly at my father's call,<BR>
More gladly when the gift may free<BR>
His honour and bring joy to thee.<BR>
Thus, lady, his sad heart release<BR>
From the sore shame, and give him peace.<BR>
But tell me, O, I pray thee, why<BR>
The lord of men, with downcast eye,<BR>
Lies prostrate thus, and one by one<BR>
Down his pale cheek the tear-drops run.<BR>
Let couriers to thy father speed<BR>
On horses of the swiftest breed,<BR>
And, by the mandate of the king,<BR>
Thy Bharat to his presence bring.<BR>
My father's words I will not stay<BR>
To question, but this very day<BR>
To Dandak's pathless wild will fare,<BR>
For twice seven years an exile there.'<BR>

<P>
When R&aacute;ma thus had made reply<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;'s heart with joy beat high.<BR>
She, trusting to the pledge she held,<BR>
The youth's departure thus impelled:<BR>
''Tis well. Be messengers despatched<BR>
On coursers ne'er for fleetness matched,<BR>
To seek my father's home and lead<BR>
My Bharat back with all their speed.<BR>
And, R&aacute;ma, as I ween that thou<BR>
Wilt scarce endure to linger now,<BR>
So surely it were wise and good<BR>
This hour to journey to the wood.<BR>
And if, with shame cast down and weak,<BR>
No word to thee the king can speak,<BR>
Forgive, and from thy mind dismiss<BR>
A trifle in an hour like this.<BR>
But till thy feet in rapid haste<BR>
Have left the city for the waste,<BR>
And to the distant forest fled,<BR>
He will not bathe nor call for bread.'<BR>

<P>
'Woe! woe!' from the sad monarch burst,<BR>
In surging floods of grief immersed;<BR>
Then swooning, with his wits astray,<BR>
Upon the gold-wrought couch he lay,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma raised the aged king:<BR>
But the stern queen, unpitying,<BR>
Checked not her needless words, nor spared<BR>
The hero for all speed prepared,<BR>
But urged him with her bitter tongue,<BR>
Like a good horse with lashes stung.<BR>
She spoke her shameful speech. Serene<BR>
He heard the fury of the queen,<BR>
And to her words so vile and dread<BR>
Gently, unmoved in mind, he said:<BR>
'I would not in this world remain<BR>
A grovelling thrall to paltry gain,<BR>
But duty's path would fain pursue,<BR>
True as the saints themselves are true.<BR>
From death itself I would not fly<BR>
My father's wish to gratify.<BR>
What deed soe'er his loving son<BR>
May do to please him, think it done.<BR>
Amid all duties, Queen, I count<BR>
This duty first and paramount,<BR>
That sons, obedient, aye fulfil<BR>
Their honoured fathers' word and will.<BR>
Without his word, if thou decree,<BR>
Forth to the forest will I flee,<BR>
And there shall fourteen years be spent<BR>
Mid lonely wilds in banishment.<BR>
Methinks thou couldst not hope to find<BR>
One spark of virtue in my mind,<BR>
If thou, whose wish is still my lord,<BR>
Hast for this grace the king implored.<BR>
This day I go, but, ere we part,<BR>
Must cheer my S&iacute;t&aacute;'s tender heart.<BR>
To my dear mother bid farewell;<BR>
Then to the woods, a while to dwell.<BR>
With thee, O Queen, the care must rest<BR>
That Bharat hear his sire's behest,<BR>
And guard the land with righteous sway,<BR>
For such the law that lives for aye.'<BR>

<P>
In speechless woe the father heard,<BR>
Wept with loud cries, but spoke no word.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma touched his senseless feet,<BR>
And hers, for honour most unmeet;<BR>
Round both his circling steps he bent,<BR>
Then from the bower the hero went.<BR>
Soon as he reached the gate he found<BR>
His dear companions gathered round.<BR>
Behind him came Sumitr&aacute;s child<BR>
With weeping eyes so sad and wild.<BR>
Then saw he all that rich array<BR>
Of vases for the glorious day.<BR>
Round them with reverent stops he paced,<BR>
Nor veiled his eye, nor moved in haste.<BR>
The loss of empire could not dim<BR>
The glory that encompassed him.<BR>
So will the Lord of Cooling Rays &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
On whom the world delights to gaze,<BR>
Through the great love of all retain<BR>
Sweet splendour in the time of wane.<BR>
Now to the exile's lot resigned<BR>
He left the rule of earth behind:<BR>
As though all worldly cares he spurned<BR>
No trouble was in him discerned.<BR>
The chouries that for kings are used,<BR>
And white umbrella, he refused,<BR>
Dismissed his chariot and his men,<BR>
And every friend and citizen.<BR>
He ruled his senses, nor betrayed<BR>
The grief that on his bosom weighed,<BR>
And thus his mother's mansion sought<BR>
To tell the mournful news he brought.<BR>
Nor could the gay-clad people there<BR>
Who flocked round R&aacute;ma true and fair,<BR>
One sign of altered fortune trace<BR>
Upon the splendid hero's face.<BR>
Nor had the chieftain, mighty-armed.<BR>
Lost the bright look all hearts that charmed,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
As e'en from autumn moons is thrown<BR>
A splendour which is all their own.<BR>
With his sweet voice the hero spoke<BR>
Saluting all the gathered folk,<BR>
Then righteous-souled and great in fame<BR>
Close to his mother's house he came.<BR>
Lakshman the brave, his brother's peer<BR>
In princely virtues, followed near,<BR>
Sore troubled, but resolved to show<BR>
No token of his secret woe.<BR>
Thus to the palace R&aacute;ma went<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where all were gay with hope and joy;<BR>
But well he knew the dire event<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That hope would mar, that bliss destroy.<BR>
So to his grief he would not yield<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lest the sad change their hearts might rend,<BR>
And, the dread tiding unrevealed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Spared from the blow each faithful friend.<BR>
