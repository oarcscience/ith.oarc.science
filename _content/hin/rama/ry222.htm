<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXIV.: THE HOST IN SIGHT.</H3>
<P>
While Khara urged by valiant rage,<BR>
Drew near that little hermitage,<BR>
Those wondrous signs in earth and sky<BR>
Smote on each prince's watching rye.<BR>
When Rama saw those signs of woe<BR>
Fraught with destruction to the foe,<BR>
With bold impatience scarce repressed<BR>
His brother chief he thus addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'These fearful signs, my brother bold,<BR>
Which threaten all our foes, behold:<BR>
All laden, as they strike the view,<BR>
With ruin to the fiendish crew.<BR>
The angry clouds are gathering fast,<BR>
Their skirts with dusty gloom o'ercast,<BR>
And harsh with loud-voiced thunder, rain<BR>
Thick drops of blood upon the plain.<BR>
See, burning for the coming light,<BR>
My shafts with wreaths of smoke are white,<BR>
And my great bow embossed with gold<BR>
Throbs eager for the master's hold.<BR>
Each bird that through the forest flies<BR>
Sends out its melancholy cries.<BR>
All signs foretell the dangerous strife,<BR>
The jeopardy of limb and life.<BR>
Each sight, each sound gives warning clear<BR>
That foemen meet and death is near.<BR>
But courage, valiant brother! well<BR>
The throbbings of mine arm foretell<BR>
That ruin waits the hostile powers,<BR>
And triumph in the fight is ours.<BR>
I hail the welcome omen: thou<BR>
Art bright of lace and clear of brow.<BR>
For Lakshman, when the eye can trace<BR>
A cloud upon the warrior's face<BR>
Stealing the cheerful light away,<BR>
His life is doomed in battle fray.<BR>
List, brother, to that awful cry:<BR>
With shout and roar the fiends draw nigh.<BR>
With thundering beat of many a drum<BR>
The savage-hearted giants come.<BR>
The wise who value safety know<BR>
To meet, prepared, the coming blow:<BR>
In paths of prudence trained aright<BR>
They watch the stroke before it smite.<BR>
Take thou thine arrows and thy bow,<BR>
Aud with the Maithil lady go<BR>
For shelter to the mountain cave<BR>
Where thickest trees their branches wave.<BR>
I will not have thee, Lakshman, say<BR>
One word in answer, but obey.<BR>
By all thy honour for these feet<BR>
Of mine, dear brother, I entreat.<BR>
Thy warlike arm, I know could, smite<BR>
To death these rovers of the night;<BR>
But I this day would fight alone<BR>
Till all the fiends be overthrown.'<BR>

<P>

<P>
He spake: and Lakshman answered naught:<BR>
His arrows and his bow he brought,<BR>
And then with S&iacute;t&aacute; following hied<BR>
For shelter to the mountain side.<BR>
As Lakshman and the lady through<BR>
The forest to'the cave withdrew,<BR>
'Tis well,' cried R&aacute;ma. Then he braced<BR>
His coat of mail around his waist.<BR>
When, bright as blazing fire, upon<BR>
His mighty limbs that armour shone,<BR>
The hero stood like some great light<BR>
Uprising in the dark of night.<BR>
His dreadful shafts were by his side;<BR>
His trusty bow he bent and plied.<BR>
Prepared he stood: the bowstring rang,<BR>
Filling the welkin with the clang.<BR>

<P>
The high-souled Gods together drew<BR>
The wonder of the fight to view,<BR>
The saints made free from spot and stain,<BR>
And bright Gandharvas' heavenly train.<BR>
Each glorious sage the assembly sought,<BR>
Each saint divine of loftiest thought,<BR>
And filled with zeal for R&aacute;ma's sake.<BR>
Thus they whose deeds were holy spake:<BR>

<P>
'Now be it well with Br&aacute;hmans, now<BR>
Well with the worlds and every cow!<BR>
Let R&aacute;ma in the deadly fray<BR>
The fiends who walk in darkness slay,<BR>
As He who bears the discus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_465"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> slew<BR>
The chieftains of the Asur crew.'<BR>

<P>
Then each with anxious glances viewed<BR>
His fellow and his speech renewed:<BR>
'There twice seven thousand giants stand<BR>
With impious heart and cruel hand:<BR>
Here R&aacute;ma stands, by virtue known:<BR>
How can the hero fight alone?'<BR>

<P>
Thus royal sage and Br&aacute;hman saint,<BR>
Spirit, and Virtue free from taint,<BR>
And all the Gods of heaven who rode<BR>
On golden cars, their longing showed.<BR>
Their hearts with doubt and terror rent,<BR>
They saw the giants' armament,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma clothed in warrior might,<BR>
Forth standing in the front of fight.<BR>
Lord of the arm no toil might tire,<BR>
He stood majestic in his ire,<BR>
Matchless in form as Rudra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_466"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> when<BR>
His wrath is fierce on Gods or men.<BR>

<P>
While Gods and saints in close array<BR>
Held converse of the coming fray,<BR>
The army of the fiends drew near<BR>
With sight and sound that counselled fear.<BR>
Long, loud and deep their war-cry pealed,<BR>
As on they rushed with flag and shield,<BR>
Each, of his proper valour proud,<BR>
Urging to fight the demon crowd.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
His ponderous bow each warrior tried,<BR>
And swelled his bulk with martial pride.<BR>
'Mid shout and roar and trampling feet.<BR>
And thunder of the drums they beat,<BR>
Loud and more loud the tumult went<BR>
Throughout the forest's vast extent,<BR>
And all the life that moved within<BR>
The woodland trembled at the din.<BR>
In eager haste all fled to find<BR>
Some tranquil spot, nor looked behind.<BR>

<P>
With every arm of war supplied,<BR>
On-rushing wildly like the tide<BR>
Of some deep sea, the giant host<BR>
Approached where R&aacute;ma kept his post.<BR>
Then he, in battle skilled and tried,<BR>
Bent his keen eye on every side,<BR>
And viewed the host of Khara face<BR>
To face before his dwelling-place.<BR>
He drew his arrows forth, and reared<BR>
And strained that bow which foemen feared,<BR>
And yielded to the vengeful sway<BR>
Of fierce desire that host to slay.<BR>
Terrific as the ruinous fire<BR>
That ends the worlds, he glowed in ire;<BR>
And his tremendous form dismayed<BR>
The Gods who roam the forest shade.<BR>
For in the furious wrath that glowed<BR>
Within his soul the hero showed<BR>
Like S'iva when his angry might<BR>
Stayed Daksha's sacrificial rite.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_467"></A><A HREF="ry223.htm#fn_467"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Like some great cloud at dawn of day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When first the sun upsprings,<BR>
And o'er the gloomy mass each ray<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A golden radiance flings:<BR>
Thus showed the children of the night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Whose mail and chariots threw,<BR>
With gleam of bows and armlets bright,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Flashes of flamy hue.<BR>
