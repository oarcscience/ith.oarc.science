<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XVIII.: THE SENTENCE.</H3>
<P>
With hopeless eye and pallid mien<BR>
There sat the monarch with the queen.<BR>
His father's feet with reverence due<BR>
He clasped, and touched Kaikey?s too.<BR>
The king, with eyes still brimming o'er,<BR>
Cried 'R&aacute;ma!' and could do no more.<BR>


<P>


<P>
His voice was choked, his eye was dim,<BR>
He could not speak or look on him.<BR>
Then sudden fear made R&aacute;ma shake<BR>
As though his foot had roused a snake,<BR>
Soon as his eyes had seen the change<BR>
So mournful, terrible, and strange.<BR>
For there his reason well-nigh fled,<BR>
Sighing, with soul disquieted,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To torturing pangs a prey,<BR>
Dismayed, despairing, and distraught,<BR>
In a fierce whirl of wildering thought<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hapless monarch lay,<BR>
Like Ocean wave-engarlanded<BR>
Storm-driven from his tranquil bed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Sun-God in eclipse,<BR>
Or like a holy seer, heart-stirred<BR>
With anguish, when a lying word<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Has passed his heedless lips.<BR>
The sight of his dear father, pained<BR>
With woe and misery unexplained<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Filled R&aacute;ma with unrest,<BR>
As Ocean's pulses rise and swell<BR>
When the great moon he loves so well<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Shines full upon his breast.<BR>
So grieving for his father's sake,<BR>
To his own heart the hero spake:<BR>
'Why will the king my sire to-day<BR>
No kindly word of greeting say?<BR>
At other times, though wroth he be,<BR>
His eyes grow calm that look on me.<BR>
Then why does anguish wring his brow<BR>
To see his well-beloved now?'<BR>
Sick and perplexed, distraught with woe,<BR>
To Queen Kaikey&iacute; bowing low,<BR>
While pallor o'er his bright cheek spread,<BR>
With humble reverence he said:<BR>
'What have I done, unknown, amiss<BR>
To make my father wroth like this?<BR>
Declare it, O dear Queen, and win<BR>
His pardon for my heedless sin.<BR>
Why is the sire I ever find<BR>
Filled with all love to-day unkind?<BR>
With eyes cast down and pallid cheek<BR>
This day alone he will not speak.<BR>
Or lies he prostrate 'neath the blow<BR>
Of fierce disease or sudden woe?<BR>
For all our bliss is dashed with pain,<BR>
And joy unmixt is hard to gain.<BR>
Does stroke of evil fortune smite<BR>
Dear Bharat, charming to the sight,<BR>
Or on the brave S'atrughna fall,<BR>
Or consorts, for he loves them all?<BR>
Against his words when I rebel,<BR>
Or fail to please the monarch well,<BR>
When deeds of mine his soul offend,<BR>
That hour I pray my life may end.<BR>
How should a man to him who gave<BR>
His being and his life behave?<BR>
The sire to whom he owes his birth<BR>
Should be his deity on earth.<BR>
Hast thou, by pride and folly moved,<BR>

<P>

<P>
With bitter taunt the king reproved?<BR>
Has scorn of thine or cruel jest<BR>
To passion stirred his gentle breast?<BR>
Speak truly, Queen, that I may know<BR>
What cause has changed the monarch so.'<BR>

<P>
Thus by the high-souled prince addressed,<BR>
Of Raghu's sons the chief and best,<BR>
She cast all ruth and shame aside,<BR>
And bold with greedy words replied:<BR>
'Not wrath, O R&aacute;ma, stirs the king,<BR>
Nor misery stabs with sudden sting;<BR>
One thought that fills his soul has he,<BR>
But dares not speak for fear of thee.<BR>
Thou art so dear, his lips refrain<BR>
From words that might his darling pain.<BR>
But thou, as duty bids, must still<BR>
The promise of thy sire fulfil.<BR>
He who to me in days gone by<BR>
Vouchsafed a boon with honours high,<BR>
Dares now, a king, his word regret,<BR>
And caitiff-like disowns the debt.<BR>
The lord of men his promise gave<BR>
To grant the boon that I might crave,<BR>
And now a bridge would idly throw<BR>
When the dried stream has ceased to flow.<BR>
His faith the monarch must not break<BR>
In wrath, or e'en for thy dear sake.<BR>
From faith, as well the righteous know,<BR>
Our virtue and our merits flow.<BR>
Now, be they good or be they ill,<BR>
Do thou thy father's words fulfil:<BR>
Swear that his promise shall not fail,<BR>
And I will tell thee all the tale.<BR>
Yes, R&aacute;ma, when I hear that thou<BR>
Hast bound thee by thy father's vow,<BR>
Then, not till then, my lips shall speak,<BR>
Nor will he tell what boon I seek.'<BR>

<P>
He heard, and with a troubled breast<BR>
This answer to the queen addressed:<BR>
'Ah me, dear lady, canst thou deem<BR>
That words like these thy lips beseem?<BR>
I, at the bidding of my sire,<BR>
Would cast my body to the fire,<BR>
A deadly draught of poison drink,<BR>
Or in the waves of ocean sink:<BR>
If he command, it shall be done,--<BR>
My father and my king in one.<BR>
Then speak and let me know the thing<BR>
So longed for by my lord the king.<BR>
It shall be done: let this suffice;<BR>
R&aacute;ma ne'er makes a promise twice.'<BR>

<P>
He ended. To the princely youth<BR>
Who loved the right and spoke the truth,<BR>
Cruel, abominable came<BR>
The answer of the ruthless dame:<BR>
'When Gods and Titans fought of yore,<BR>
Transfixed with darts and bathed in gore<BR>
Two boons to me thy father gave<BR>
For the dear life 'twas mine to save.<BR>
Of him I claim the ancient debt,<BR>
That Bharat on the throne be set,<BR>
And thou, O R&aacute;ma, go this day<BR>
To Dandak forest far away.<BR>
Now, R&aacute;ma, if thou wilt maintain<BR>
Thy father's faith without a stain,<BR>
And thine own truth and honour clear,<BR>
Then, best of men, my bidding hear.<BR>
Do thou thy father's word obey,<BR>
Nor from the pledge he gave me stray.<BR>
Thy life in Dandak forest spend<BR>
Till nine long years and five shall end.<BR>
Upon my Bharat's princely head<BR>
Let consecrating drops be shed,<BR>
With all the royal pomp for thee<BR>
Made ready by the king's decree.<BR>
Seek Dandak forest and resign<BR>
Rites that would make the empire thine,<BR>
For twice seven years of exile wear<BR>
The coat of bark and matted hair.<BR>
Then in thy stead let Bharat reign<BR>
Lord of his royal sire's domain,<BR>
Rich in the fairest gems that shine,<BR>
Cars, elephants, and steeds, and kine.<BR>
The monarch mourns thy altered fate<BR>
And vails his brow compassionate:<BR>
Bowed down by bitter grief he lies<BR>
And dares not lift to thine his eyes.<BR>
Obey his word: be firm and brave,<BR>
And with great truth the monarch save.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  While thus with cruel words she spoke,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    No grief the noble youth betrayed;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But forth the father's anguish broke,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    At his dear R&aacute;ma's lot dismayed.<BR>
