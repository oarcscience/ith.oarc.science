<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXVI.: THE EMBALMING.</H3>
<P>
Kaus'aly&aacute;'s eyes with tears o'erflowed.<BR>
Weighed down by varied sorrows's load;<BR>
On her dead lord her gaze she bent,<BR>
Who lay like fire whose might is spent,<BR>
Like the great deep with waters dry,<BR>
Or like the clouded sun on high.<BR>
Then on her lap she laid his head.<BR>
And on Kaikey&iacute; looked and said:<BR>
'Triumphant now enjoy thy reign<BR>
Without a thorn thy side to pain.<BR>
Thou hast pursued thy single aim,<BR>
And lulled the king, O wicked dame.<BR>
Far from my sight my R&aacute;ma flies,<BR>
My perished lord has sought the skies.<BR>
No friend, no hope my life to cheer,<BR>
I cannot tread the dark path here.<BR>
Who would forsake her husband, who<BR>
That God to whom her love is due,<BR>
And wish to live one hour, but she<BR>
Whose heart no duty owns, like thee?<BR>
The ravenous sees no fault: his greed<BR>
Will e'en on poison blindly feed.<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;, through a hump-back maid,<BR>
This royal house in death has laid.<BR>
King Janak, with his queen, will hear<BR>
Heart rent like me the tidings drear<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma banished by the king,<BR>
Urged by her impious counselling.<BR>
No son has he, his age is great,<BR>
And sinking with the double weight,<BR>
He for his darling child will pine,<BR>
And pierced with woe his life resign.<BR>
Sprung from Videha's monarch, she<BR>
A sad and lovely devotee,<BR>
Roaming the wood, unmeet for woe,<BR>
Will toil and trouble undergo.<BR>
She in the gloomy night with fear<BR>
The cries of beast and bird will hear,<BR>
And trembling in her wild alarm<BR>
Will cling to R&aacute;ma's sheltering arm.<BR>
Ah, little knows my duteous son<BR>
That I am widowed and undone--<BR>
My R&aacute;ma of the lotus eye,<BR>
Gone hence, gone hence, alas, to die.<BR>
Now, as a living wife and true,<BR>
I, e'en this day, will perish too:<BR>
Around his form these arms will throw.<BR>
And to the fire with him will go.'<BR>

<P>
Clasping her husband's lifeless clay<BR>
A while the weeping votaress lay,<BR>
Till chamberlains removed her thence<BR>

O'ercome by sorrow's violence.<BR>
Then in a cask of oil they laid<BR>
Him who in life the world had swayed,<BR>
And finished, as the lords desired,<BR>
All rites for parted souls required.<BR>
The lords, all-wise, refused to burn<BR>
The monarch ere his son's return;<BR>
So for a while the corpse they set<BR>
Embalmed in oil, and waited yet.<BR>
The women heard: no doubt remained,<BR>
And wildly for the king they plained.<BR>
With gushing tears that drowned each eye<BR>
Wildly they waved their arms on high,<BR>
And each her mangling nails impressed<BR>
Deep in her head and knee and breast:<BR>
'Of R&aacute;ma reft,--who ever spake<BR>
The sweetest words the heart to take,<BR>
Who firmly to the truth would cling,--<BR>
Why dost thou leave us, mighty King?<BR>
How can the consorts thou hast left<BR>
Widowed, of Raghu's son bereft,<BR>
Live with our foe Kaikey&iacute; near,<BR>
The wicked queen we hate and fear?<BR>
She threw away the king, her spite<BR>
Drove R&aacute;ma forth and Lakshman's might,<BR>
And gentle S&iacute;t&aacute;: how will she<BR>
Spare any, whosoe'er it be?'<BR>

<P>
Oppressed with sorrow, tear-distained,<BR>
The royal women thus complained.<BR>
Like night when not a star appears,<BR>
Like a sad widow drowned in tears,<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;'s city, dark and dim,<BR>
Reft of her lord was sad for him.<BR>
When thus for woe the king to heaven had fled,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And still on earth his lovely wives remained.<BR>
With dying light the sun to rest had sped,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And night triumphant o'er the landscape reigned.<BR>
