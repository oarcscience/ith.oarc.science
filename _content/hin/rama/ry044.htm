<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLIV.: THE DESCENT OF GANG&Agrave;.</H3>
<P>
The Lord of life the skies regained:<BR>
The fervent king a year remained<BR>
With arms upraised, refusing rest<BR>
While with one toe the earth he pressed,<BR>
Still as a post, with sleepless eye,<BR>
The air his food, his roof the sky.<BR>
Tho year had past. Then Um&aacute;'s lord, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>
King of creation, world adored,<BR>
Thus spoke to great Bhagirath: 'I<BR>
Well pleased thy wish will gratify,<BR>
And on my head her waves shalll fling<BR>
The daughter of the Mountains' King!<BR>
He stood upon the lofty crest<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That crowns the Lord of Snow,<BR>
And bade the river of the Blest<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Descend on earth below.<BR>
Him&aacute;laya's child, adored of all,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The haughty mandate heard,<BR>
And her proud bosom, at the call,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With furious wrath was stirred.<BR>
Down from her channel in the skies<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With awful might she sped<BR>
With a giant's rush, in a giant's size.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  On S'iva's holy head.<BR>
'He calls me,' in her wrath she cried,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'And all my flood shall sweep<BR>
And whirl him in its whelming tide<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To hell's profoundest deep.<BR>
He held tne river on his head,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And kept her wandering, where,<BR>
Dense as Himalaya's woods, were spread<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The tangles of his hair.<BR>

No way to earth she found, ashamed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Though long and sore she strove,<BR>
Condemned, until her pride were tamed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Amid his locks to rove.<BR>
There, many lengthening seasons through,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The wildered river ran:<BR>
Bhagirath saw it, and anew<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His penance dire began.<BR>
Then S'iva, for the hermit's sake,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bade her long wanderings end,<BR>
And sinking into Vindu's lake<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her weary waves descend.<BR>
From Gang&aacute;, by the God set free,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Seven noble rivers came;<BR>
Hl&aacute;din&iacute;, P&aacute;van&iacute;, and she<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Called Nalin&iacute; by name:<BR>
These rolled their lucid waves along<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And sought the eastern side.<BR>
Suchakshu, S&iacute;t&aacute; fair and strong,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And Sindhu's mighty tide-- &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
These to the region of the west<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With joyful waters sped:<BR>
The seventh, the brightest and the best,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Flowed where Bhag&iacute;rath led.<BR>
On S'iva's head descending first<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A rest the torrents found:<BR>
Then down in all their might they burst<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And roared along the ground.<BR>
On countless glittering scales the beam<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of rosy morning flashed,<BR>
Where flsh and dolphins through the stream<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fallen and falling dashed.<BR>
Then bards who chant celestial lays<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And nymphs of heavenly birth<BR>
Flocked round upon that flow to gaze<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That streamed from sky and earth.<BR>
The Gods themselves from every sphere,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Incomparably bright,<BR>
Borne in their golden cars drew near<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To see the wondrous sight.<BR>
The cloudless sky was all aflame<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With the light of a hundred suns<BR>
Where'er the shining chariots came<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That bore those holy ones.<BR>
So flashed the air with crested snakes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And fish of every hue<BR>
As when the lightning's glory breaks<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Through fields of summer blue.<BR>
And white foam-clouds and silver spray<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Were wildly tossed on high,<BR>
Like swans that urge their homeward way<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Across the autumn sky.<BR>
Now ran the river calm and clear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With current strong and deep:<BR>

<P>

<P>
Now slowly broadened to a mere,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Or scarcely seemed to creep.<BR>
Now o'er a length of sandy plain<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her tranquil course she held:<BR>
Now rose her waves and sank again,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By refluent waves repelled.<BR>
So falling first on S'iva's head,<BR>
Thence rushing to their earthly bed,<BR>
In ceaseless fall the waters streamed,<BR>
And pure with holy lustre gleamed.<BR>
Then every spirit, sage, and bard,<BR>
Condemned to earth by sentence hard,<BR>
Pressed eagerly around the tide<BR>
That S'iva's touch had sanctified.<BR>
Then they whom heavenly doom had hurled,<BR>
Accursed, to this lower world,<BR>
Touched the pure wave, and freed from sin<BR>
Resought the skies and entered in<BR>
And all the world was glad, whereon<BR>
The glorious water flowed and shone,<BR>
For sin and stain were banished thence<BR>
By the sweet river's influence.<BR>
First, in a car of heavenly frame,<BR>
The royal saint of deathless name,<BR>
Bhag&iacute;rath, very glorious rode,<BR>
And after him fair Gang&aacute; flowed.<BR>
God, sage, and bard, the chief in place<BR>
Of spirits and the N&aacute;ga race,<BR>
Nymph, giant, fiend, in long array<BR>
Sped where Bhag&iacute;rath led the way;<BR>
And all the hosts the flood that swim<BR>
Followed the stream that followed him.<BR>
Where'er the great Bhag&iacute;rath led,<BR>
There ever glorious Gang&aacute; fled,<BR>
The best of floods, the rivers' queen,<BR>
Whose waters wash the wicked clean.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  It chanced that Jahnu, great and good,<BR>
Engaged with holy offering stood;<BR>
The river spread her waves around<BR>
Flooding his sacrificial ground.<BR>
The saint in anger marked her pride,<BR>
And at one draught her stream he dried.<BR>
Then God, and sage, and bard, afraid,<BR>
To noble high-souled Jahnu prayed,<BR>
And begged that he would kindly deem<BR>
His own dear child that holy stream.<BR>
Moved by their suit, he soothed their fears<BR>
And loosed her waters from his ears.<BR>
Hence Gang&aacute; through the world is styled<BR>
Both J&aacute;hnavi and Jahnu's child.<BR>
Then onward still she followed fast,<BR>
And reached the great sea bank at last.<BR>
Thence deep below her way she made<BR>
To end those rites so long delayed.<BR>
The monarch reached the Ocean's side,<BR>
And still behind him Gang&aacute; hied.<BR>
He sought the depths which open lay<BR>
Where Sagar's sons had dug their way.<BR>
So leading through earth's nether caves<BR>
The river's purifying waves.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Over his kinsmen's dust the lord<BR>
His funeral libation poured.<BR>
Soon as the flood their dust bedewed,<BR>
Their spirits gained beatitude,<BR>
And all in heavenly bodies dressed<BR>
Rose to the skies' eternal rest.<BR>

<P>
Then thus to King Bhag&iacute;rath said<BR>
Brahm&aacute;, when, coming at the head<BR>
Of all his bright celestial train,<BR>
He saw those spirits freed from stain:<BR>
'Well done! great Prince of men, well done!<BR>
Thy kinsmen bliss and heaven have won.<BR>
The sons of Sagar mighty-souled,<BR>
Are with the Blest, as Gods, enrolled,<BR>
Long as the Ocean's flood shall stand<BR>
Upon the border of the land,<BR>
So long shall Sagar's sons remain,<BR>
And, godlike, rank in heaven retain.<BR>
Gang&aacute; thine eldest child shall be.<BR>
Called from thy name Bh&aacute;girath&iacute;;<BR>
Named also--for her waters fell<BR>
From heaven and flow through earth and hell--<BR>
Tripathag&aacute;, stream of the skies.<BR>
Because three paths she glorifies,<BR>
And, mighty King, 'tis given thee now<BR>
To free thee and perform thy vow.<BR>
No longer, happy Prince, delay<BR>
Drink-offerings to thy kin to pay,<BR>
For this the holiest Sagar sighed,<BR>
But mourned the boon he sought denied.<BR>
Then Ans'um&aacute;n, dear Prince! although<BR>
No brighter name the world could show,<BR>
Strove long the heavenly flood to gain<BR>
To visit earth, but strove in vain.<BR>
Nor was she by the sages' peer,<BR>
Blest with all virtues, most austere,<BR>
Thy sire Dilipa, hither brought,<BR>
Though with fierce prayers the boon he sought.<BR>
But thou, O King, earned success,<BR>
And won high fame which God will bless.<BR>
Through thee, O victor of thy foes,<BR>
On earth this heavenly Gang&aacute; flows,<BR>
And thou hast gained the meed divine<BR>
That waits on virtue such as thine.<BR>
Now in her ever holy wave<BR>
Thyself, O best of heroes, lave:<BR>
So shalt thou, pure from every sin,<BR>
The blessed fruit of merit win.<BR>
Now for thy kin who died of yore<BR>
The meet libations duly pour.<BR>
Above the heavens I now ascend:<BR>
Depart, and bliss thy steps attend.'<BR>

<P>
Thus to the mighty king who broke<BR>
Hie foemens' might, Lord Brahm&aacute; spoke,<BR>
And with his Gods around him rose<BR>
To his own heaven of blest repose.<BR>
The royal sage no more delayed,<BR>


<P>
But, the libation duly paid,<BR>
Home to his regal city hied<BR>
With water cleansed and purified.<BR>
There ruled he his ancestral state,<BR>
Best of all men, most fortunate.<BR>
And all the people joyed again<BR>
In good Bhag&iacute;rath's gentle reign.<BR>
Rich, prosperous, and blest were they,<BR>
And grief and sickness fled away.<BR>
Thus, R&aacute;ma, I at length have told<BR>
How Gang&aacute; came from heaven of old.<BR>
Now, for the evening passes swift,<BR>
I wish thee each auspicious gift.<BR>
This story of the flood's descent<BR>
Will give--for' tis most excellent--<BR>
Wealth, purity, fame, length of days,<BR>
And to the skies its hearers raise.'<BR>
