<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVIII.: THE CHIEFTAINS.</H3>
<P>
There S&aacute;ran ceased: then S'uka broke<BR>
The silence and to R&aacute;van spoke:<BR>
'O Monarch, yonder chiefs survey:<BR>
Like elephants in size are they,<BR>
And tower like stately trees that grow<BR>
Where Gang&aacute;'s nursing waters flow;<BR>
Yea, tall as mountain pines that fling<BR>
Long shadows o'er the snow-crowned king.<BR>
They all in wild Kishkindh&aacute; dwell<BR>
And serve their lord Sugr&iacute;va well.<BR>
The Gods' and bright Gandharvas' seed,<BR>
They take each form that suits their need.<BR>
Now farther look, O Monarch, where<BR>
Those chieftains stand, a glorious pair,<BR>
Conspicuous for their godlike frames;<BR>
Dwivid and Mainda are their names.<BR>
Their lips the drink of heaven have known,<BR>
And Brahm&aacute; claims them for his own.<BR>
That chieftain whom thine eyes behold<BR>
Refulgent like a hill of gold,<BR>
Before whose wrathful might the sea<BR>
Roused from his rest would turn and flee,<BR>
The peerless V&aacute;nar, he who came<BR>
To Lank&aacute; for the Maithil dame,<BR>
The Wind-God's son Ham&uacute;m&aacute;n; thou<BR>
Hast seen him once, behold him now.<BR>
Still nearer let thy glance be bent,<BR>
And mark that prince pre&euml;minent<BR>
Mid chieftains for his strength and size<BR>
And splendour of his lotus eyes.<BR>
Far through the worlds his virtues shine,<BR>
The glory of Ikshv&aacute;ku's line.<BR>
The path of truth he never leaves,<BR>
And still through all to duty cleaves.<BR>
Deep in the Vedas, skilled to wield<BR>
The mystic shafts to him revealed:<BR>
Whose flaming darts to heaven ascend,<BR>
And through the earth a passage rend:<BR>
In might like him who rules the sky;<BR>
Like Yama, when his wrath grows high:<BR>
Whose queen, the darling of his soul.<BR>
Thy magic art deceived and stole:<BR>
There royal R&aacute;ma stands and longs<BR>
For battle to avenge his wrongs.<BR>

<P>
Near on his right a prince, in hue<BR>
Like pure gold freshly burnished, view:<BR>
Broad is his chest, his eye is red,<BR>
His black hair curls about his head:<BR>
'Tis Lakshman, faithful friend, who shares<BR>
His brother's joys, his brother's cares.<BR>
By R&aacute;ma's side he loves to stand<BR>
And serve him as his better hand,<BR>
For whose dear sake without a sigh<BR>
The warrior youth would gladly die<BR>
On R&aacute;ma's left Vibh&iacute;shan view,<BR>
With giants for his retinue:<BR>
King-making drops have dewed his head,<BR>
Appointed monarch in thy stead.<BR>
Behold that chieftain sternly still,<BR>
High towering like a rooted hill,<BR>
Supreme in power and pride of place,<BR>
The monarch of the V&aacute;nar race.<BR>
Raised high above his woodland kind,<BR>
In might and glory, frame and mind,<BR>
His head above his host he shows<BR>
Conspicuous as the Lord of Snows.<BR>
His home is far from hostile eyes<BR>
Where deep in woods Kishkindh&aacute; lies.<BR>
A glistering chain which flowers bedeck<BR>
With burnished gold adorns his neck.<BR>
Queen Fortune, loved by Gods and kings,<BR>
To him her chosen favourite clings.<BR>
That chain he owes to R&aacute;ma's grace,<BR>
And T&aacute;r&aacute; and his kingly place.<BR>
In him the great Sugr&iacute;va know,<BR>
Whom R&aacute;ma rescued from his foe.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_952"></A><A HREF="ry428.htm#fn_952"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
