<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CXVI.: THE HERMIT'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
When Bharat took his homeward road<BR>
Still R&aacute;ma in the wood abode:<BR>
But soon he marked the fear and care<BR>
That darkened all the hermits there.<BR>
For all who dwelt before the hill<BR>
Were sad with dread of coming ill:<BR>
Each holy brow was lined by thought,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's side they often sought.<BR>
With gathering frowns the prince they eyed,<BR>
And then withdrew and talked aside.<BR>

<P>
Then Raghu's son with anxious breast<BR>
The leader of the saints addressed:<BR>
'Can aught that I have done displease,<BR>
O reverend Sage, the devotees?<BR>
Why are their loving looks, O say,<BR>
Thus sadly changed or turned away?<BR>
Has Lakshman through his want of heed<BR>
Offended with unseemly deed!<BR>
Or is the gentle S&iacute;t&aacute;, she<BR>
Who loved to honour you and me--<BR>
Is she the cause of this offence,<BR>
Failing in lowly reverence?'<BR>

<P>
One sage, o'er whom, exceeding old,<BR>
Had many a year of penance rolled,<BR>
Trembling in every aged limb<BR>
Thus for the rest replied to him:<BR>
'How could we, O beloved, blame<BR>
Thy lofty-souled Videhan dame,<BR>
Who in the good of all delights,<BR>
And more than all of anchorites?<BR>
But yet through thee a numbing dread<BR>
Of fiends among our band has spread;<BR>
Obstructed by the demons' art<BR>
The trembling hermits talk apart.<BR>
For R&aacute;van's brother, overbold,<BR>
Named Khara, of gigantic mould,<BR>
Vexes with fury fierce and fell<BR>
All those in Janasth&aacute;n &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_399"></A><A HREF="#fn_399"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who dwell.<BR>
Resistless in his cruel deeds,<BR>
On flesh of men the monster feeds:<BR>
Sinful and arrogant is he,<BR>
And looks with special hate on thee.<BR>
Since thou, beloved son, hast made<BR>
Thy home within this holy shade,<BR>
The fiends have vexed with wilder rage<BR>
The dwellers of the hermitage.<BR>
In many a wild and dreadful form<BR>
Around the trembling saints they swarm,<BR>
With hideous shape and foul disguise<BR>
They terrify our holy eyes.<BR>
They make our loathing souls endure<BR>
Insult and scorn and sights impure,<BR>
And flocking round the altars stay<BR>
The holy rites we love to pay.<BR>
In every spot throughout the grove<BR>
With evil thoughts the monsters rove,<BR>
Assailing with their secret might<BR>
Each unsuspecting anchorite.<BR>
Ladle and dish away they fling,<BR>
Our fires with floods extinguishing,<BR>
And when the sacred flame should burn<BR>
They trample on each water-urn.<BR>
Now when they see their sacred wood<BR>
Plagued by this impious brotherhood,<BR>
The troubled saints away would roam<BR>
And seek in other shades a home:<BR>
Hence will we fly, O R&aacute;ma, ere<BR>
The cruel fiends our bodies tear.<BR>
Not far away a forest lies<BR>
Rich in the roots and fruit we prize,<BR>
To this will I and all repair<BR>
And join the holy hermits there;<BR>
Be wise, and with us thither flee<BR>
Before this Khara injure thee.<BR>
Mighty art thou, O R&aacute;ma, yet<BR>
Each day with peril is beset.<BR>
If with thy consort by thy side<BR>
Thou in this wood wilt still abide.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: the words the hero spake<BR>
The hermit's purpose failed to break:<BR>
To Raghu's son farewell he said,<BR>
And blessed the chief and comforted;<BR>
Then with the rest the holy sage<BR>
Departed from the hermitage.<BR>

<P>
So from the wood the saints withdrew,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma bidding all adieu<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In lowly reverence bent:<BR>
Instructed by their friendly speech,<BR>
Blest with the gracious love of each,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To his pure home he went.<BR>
Nor would the son of Raghu stray<BR>
A moment from that grove away<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  From which the saints had fled.<BR>
And many a hermit thither came<BR>
Attracted by his saintly fame<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And the pure life he led.<BR>
