<P>
Pure, with glad cheer and joyful breast,<BR>
Of those mysterious arms possessed,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, now passing on his way,<BR>
Thus to the saint began to say:<BR>
'Lord of these mighty weapons, I<BR>
Can scarce be harmed by Gods on high;<BR>
Now, best of saints, I long to gain<BR>
The powers that can these arms restrain.'<BR>
Thus spoke the prince. The sage austere,<BR>
True to his vows, from evil clear,<BR>
Called forth the names of those great charms<BR>
Whose powers restrain the deadly arms,<BR>
Receive thou True and Truly famed,<BR>
And Bold and Fleet: the weapons named<BR>

<P>
Warder and Progress, swift of pace,<BR>
Averted-head and Drooping-face;<BR>
The Seen, and that which Secret flies;<BR>
The weapon of the thousand eyes;<BR>
Ten-headed, and the Hundred-faced,<BR>
Star-gazer and the Layer-waste:<BR>
The Omen-bird, the Pure-from-spot,<BR>
The pair that wake and slumber not:<BR>
The Fiendish, that which shakes amain,<BR>
The Strong-of-Hand, the Rich-in-Gain:<BR>
The Guardian, and the Close-allied,<BR>
The Gaper, Love, and Golden-side;<BR>
O Raghu's son receive all these,<BR>
Bright ones that wear what forms they please;<BR>
Kris'&aacute;sva's mystic sons are they,<BR>
And worthy thou their might to sway.'<BR>
With joy the pride of Raghu's race<BR>
Received the hermit's proffered grace,<BR>
Mysterious arms, to check and stay,<BR>
Or smite the foeman in the fray.<BR>
Then, all with heavenly forms endued,<BR>
Nigh came the wondrous multitude.<BR>
Celestial in their bright attire<BR>
Some shone like coals of burning fire;<BR>
Some were like clouds of dusky smoke;<BR>
And suppliant thus they sweetly spoke:<BR>
'Thy thralls, O R&aacute;ma, here we stand:<BR>
Command, we pray, thy faithful band'<BR>
'Depart,' he cried, 'where each may list,<BR>
But when I call you to assist,<BR>
Be present to my mind with speed,<BR>
And aid me in the hour of need.'<BR>

<P>
To R&aacute;ma then they lowly bent,<BR>
And round him in due reverence went.<BR>
To his command, they answered, Yea,<BR>
And as they came so went away.<BR>
When thus the arms had homeward flown,<BR>
With pleasant words and modest tone,<BR>
E'en as he walked, the prince began<BR>
To question thus the holy man:<BR>
'What cloudlike wood is that which near<BR>
The mountain's side I see appear?<BR>
O tell me, for I long to know;<BR>
Its pleasant aspect charms me so.<BR>
Its glades are full of deer at play,<BR>
And sweet birds sing on every spray,<BR>
Past is the hideous wild; I feel<BR>
So sweet a tremor o'er me steal,<BR>
And hail with transport fresh and new<BR>
A land that is so fair to view.<BR>
Then tell me all, thou holy Sage,<BR>
And whose this pleasant hermitage<BR>
In which those wicked ones delight<BR>
To mar and kill each holy rite.<BR>
And with foul heart and evil deed<BR>
Thy sacrifice, great Saint, impede.<BR>
To whom, O Sage, belongs this land<BR>
In which thine altars ready stand!<BR>
'Tis mine to guard them, and to slay<BR>
The giants who the rites would stay.<BR>
All this, O best of saints, I burn<BR>
From thine own lips, my lord, to learn.'<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_165"></A><A HREF="ry032.htm#fr_165">42:1</A>  In Sanskrit <I>Sank&aacute;ra</I>, a word which
has various significations but the primary
meaning of which is <I>the act of seizing</I>. A
magical power seems to be implied of employing
the weapons when and where
required. The remarks I have made on
the preceding Canto apply with still
greater force to this. The MSS. greatly
vary in the enumeration of these <I>Sank&aacute;ras</I>,
and it is not surprising that copyists have
incorrectly written the names which they
did not well understand. The commentators
throw no light upon the subject.'
SCHLEGEL. I have taken the liberty of
omitting four of these which Schlegel
translates 'Sclerom* balum, Euomphalium,
Cantiventrem, and Chrysomphalum.'</P>
