<P>
Vas'ishtha heard their speech and prayer,<BR>
And thus addressed the concourse there.<BR>
Friends, Br&aacute;mans, counsellors, and all<BR>
Assembled in the palace hall:<BR>
'Ye know that Bharat, free from care,<BR>
Still lives in R&aacute;magriha &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> where<BR>
The father of his mother reigns:<BR>
S'atrughna by his side remains.<BR>
Let active envoys, good at need,<BR>
Thither on fleetest horses speed,<BR>
To bring the hero youths away:<BR>
Why waste the time in dull delay?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Quick came from all the glad reply:<BR>
'Vas'ishtha, let the envoys fly'<BR>
He heard their speech, and thus renewed<BR>
His charge before the multitude:<BR>
'Nandan, As'ok, Siddh&aacute;rth, attend,<BR>
Your ears, Jayanta, Vijay, lend:<BR>
Be yours, what need requires, to do:<BR>
I speak these words to all of you.<BR>
With coursers of the fleetest breed<BR>
To R&aacute;jagriha's city speed.<BR>
Then rid your bosoms of distress,<BR>
And Bharat thus from me address:<BR>
'The household priest and peers by us<BR>
Send health to thee and greet thee thus:<BR>
Come to thy father's home with haste:<BR>
Thine absent time no longer waste.'<BR>
But speak no word of R&aacute;ma fled,<BR>
Tell not the prince his sire is dead,<BR>
Nor to the royal youth the fate<BR>
That ruins Raghu's race relate.<BR>
Go quickly hence, and with you bear<BR>
Fine silken vestures rich and rare.<BR>
And gems and many a precious thing<BR>
As gifts to Bharat and the king.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With ample stores of food supplied,<BR>
Bach to his home the envoys hied,<BR>
Prepared, with steeds of swiftest race,<BR>
lo Kekaya's land &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> their way to trace.<BR>
They made all due provision there,<BR>
And every need arranged with care,<BR>
Then ordered by Vas'ishtha. they<BR>
Went forth with speed upon their way.<BR>
Then northward of Pralamba, west<BR>
Of Apart&aacute;la, on they pressed,<BR>
Crossing the M'alin&iacute; that flowed<BR>
With gentle stream athwart the road.<BR>
They traversed Gang&aacute;s holy waves<BR>

Where she Hastinapura &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> lives,<BR>
Thence to Panchala &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> westward fast<BR>
Through Kurujangal's land &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> they passed.<BR>
On, on their course the envoys held<BR>
By urgency of task impelled.<BR>
Quick glancing at each lucid flood<BR>
And sweet lake gay with flower and bud.<BR>
Beyond, they passed unwearied o'er,<BR>
Where glad birds fill the flood and shore<BR>
Of Saradanda racing fleet<BR>
With heavenly water clear and sweet.<BR>
Thereby a tree celestial grows<BR>
Which every boon on prayer bestows:<BR>
To its blest shade they humbly bent,<BR>
Then to Kulinga's town they went.<BR>
Then, having passed the Warrior's Wood,<BR>
In Abhikala next they stood,<BR>
O'er sacred Ikshumati &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> came,<BR>
Their ancient kings' ancestral claim.<BR>
They saw the learned Brahmans stand,<BR>
Each drinking from his hollowed hand,<BR>
And through Bahika &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> journeying still<BR>
They reached at length Sudaman's hill:<BR>
There Vishnu's footstep turned to see,<BR>
Vipasa &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> viewed, and Salmali,<BR>
And many a lake and river met,<BR>
Tank, pool, and pond, and rivulet.<BR>
And lions saw, and tigers near,<BR>
And elephants and herds of deer,<BR>
And still, by prompt obedience led,<BR>
Along the ample road they sped.<BR>
Then when their course so swift and long,<BR>
Had worn their steeds though fleet and strong,<BR>
To Girivraja's splendid town<BR>
They came by night, and lighted down.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
To please their master, and to guard<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The royal race, the lineal right,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The envoys, spent with riding hard,<BR>
To that fair city came by night. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="ry147.htm#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
