<P>
Three nights upon the road they passed<BR>
To rest the steeds that bore them fast,<BR>
And reached Ayodhy&aacute;'s town at last.<BR>
Then straight at Das'aratha's call<BR>
They stood within the royal hall,<BR>
Where, like a God, inspiring awe,<BR>
The venerable king they saw.<BR>
With suppliant palm to palm applied,<BR>
And all their terror laid aside,<BR>
They spoke to him upon the throne<BR>
With modest words, in gentle tone:<BR>
'Janak, Videha's king, O Sire,<BR>
Has sent us hither to inquire<BR>
The health of thee his friend most dear,<BR>
Of all thy priests and every peer.<BR>
Next Kus'ik's son consenting, thus<BR>
King Janak speaks, dread liege, by us:<BR>
'I made a promise and decree<BR>
That valour's prize my child should be.<BR>
Kings, worthless found in worth's assay,<BR>
With mien dejected turned away.<BR>
Thy sons, by Vis'v&aacute;mitra led,<BR>
Unurged, my city visited,<BR>
And peerless in their might have gained<BR>
My daughter, as my vow ordained.<BR>
Full in a vast assembly's view<BR>
Thy hero R&aacute;ma broke in two<BR>
The gem of bows, of monstrous size,<BR>
That came a treasure from the skies.<BR>
Ordained the prize of hero's might,<BR>
Sit&aacute; my child is his by right.<BR>
Fain would I keep my promise made,<BR>
If thou, O King, approve and aid.<BR>
Come to my town thy son to see:<BR>
Bring holy guide and priest with thee.<BR>
O lord of kings, my suit allow,<BR>
And let me keep my promised vow.<BR>
So joying for thy children's sake<BR>
Their triumph too shalt thou partake,<BR>
With Vis'v&aacute;mitra's high consent.'<BR>
'Such words with friendship eloquent<BR>
Spoke Janak, fair Videha's king,<BR>
By S'at&aacute;nanda's counselling.'<BR>

<P>
The envoys thus the king addressed,<BR>
And mighty joy his heart possessed.<BR>
To V&aacute;madeva quick he cried,<BR>
Vas'ishtha, and his lords beside:<BR>
'Lakshman, and he, my princely hoy<BR>
Who fills Kaus'aly&aacute;'s soul with joy,<BR>
By Vis'v&aacute;mitra guarded well<BR>
Among the good Videhans dwell.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Their ruler Janak, prompt to own<BR>
The peerless might my child has shown,<BR>
To him would knit in holy ties<BR>
His daughter, valour's lovely prize.<BR>
If Janak's plan seem good to you,<BR>
Come, speed we to his city too,<BR>
Nor let occasion idly by.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased. There came a glad reply<BR>
From priest and mighty saint and all<BR>
The councillors who thronged the hall.<BR>
Then cried the king with joyous heart:<BR>
'To-morrow let us all depart.'<BR>

<P>
That night the envoys entertained<BR>
With honour and all care remained.<BR>
