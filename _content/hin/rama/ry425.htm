<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVI.: THE V&Aacute;NAR CHIEFS.</H3>
<P>
'Not if the Gods in heaven who dwell,<BR>
Gandharvas, and the fiends of hell<BR>
In banded opposition rise<BR>
Against me, will I yield my prize.<BR>
Still trembling from the ungentle toucb<BR>
Of V&aacute;nar hands ye fear too much,<BR>
And bid me, heedless of the shame,<BR>
Give to her lord the Maithil dame.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spoke the king in stern reproof;<BR>
Then mounted to his palace roof<BR>
Aloft o'er many a story raised,<BR>
And on the lands beneath him gazed.<BR>
There by his faithful spies he stood<BR>
And looked on sea and hill and wood.<BR>
There stretched before him far away<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' numberless array:<BR>
Scarce could the meadows' tender green<BR>
Beneath their trampling feet be seen.<BR>
He looked a while with furious eye,<BR>
Then questioned thus the nearer spy:<BR>
'Bend, S&aacute;ran, bend thy gaze, and show<BR>
The leaders of the V&aacute;nar foe<BR>
Tell me their heroes' names, and teach<BR>
The valour, power and might of each.'<BR>

<P>
Obedient S&aacute;ran eyed the van,<BR>
The leaders marked, and thus began:<BR>
That chief conspicuous at the head<BR>
Of warriors in the forest bred,<BR>
Who hither bends his ruthless eye<BR>
And shouts his fearful battle cry:<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_448"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 448</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Whose voice with pealing thunder shakes<BR>
All Lank&aacute;, with the groves and lakes<BR>
And hills that tremble at the sound,<BR>
Is Nila, for his might renowned:<BR>
First of the V&aacute;nar lords controlled<BR>
By King Sugr&iacute;va lofty-souled.<BR>
He who his mighty arm extends,<BR>
And his fierce eye on Lank&aacute; bends,<BR>
In stature like a stately tower,<BR>
In colour like a lotus flower,<BR>
Who with his wild earth-shaking cries<BR>
Thee, R&aacute;van, to the field defies,<BR>
Is Angad, by Sugr&iacute;va's care<BR>
Anointed his imperial heir:<BR>
In wondrous strength, in martial fire<BR>
Peer of King Bali's self, his sire;<BR>
For R&aacute;ma's sake in arms arrayed<BR>
Like Varun called to S'akra's aid.<BR>
Behind him, girt by warlike bands,<BR>
Nala the mighty V&aacute;nar stands,<BR>
The son of Vis'vakarm&aacute;, he<BR>
Who built the bridge athwart the sea.<BR>
Look farther yet, O King, and mark<BR>
That chieftain clothed in Sandal bark.<BR>
'Tis S'weta, famed among his peers,<BR>
A sage whom all his race reveres.<BR>
See, in Sugr&iacute;va's ear he speaks,<BR>
Then, hasting back, his post reseeks,<BR>
And turns his practised eye to view<BR>
The squadrons he has formed anew.<BR>
Next Kumud stands who roamed of yore<BR>
On Gomati's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_949"></A><A HREF="#fn_949"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> delightful shore,<BR>
Feared where the waving woods invest<BR>
His seat on Mount Sanrochan's crest.<BR>
Next him a chieftain strong and dread,<BR>
Comes Chanda at his legions' head;<BR>
Exulting in his warrior might<BR>
He hastens, burning for the fight.<BR>
And boasts that his unaided powers<BR>
Shall cast to earth thy walls and towers.<BR>
Mark, mark that chief of lion gait,<BR>
Who views thee with a glance of hate<BR>
As though his very eyes would burn<BR>
The city walls to which they turn:<BR>
'Tis Rambha, V&aacute;nar king; he dwells<BR>
In Krishnagiri's tangled dells,<BR>
Where Vindhya's pleasant slopes are spread<BR>
And fair Sudars'an lifts his head.<BR>
There, listening with erected ears,<BR>
S'arabha, mighty chief, appears.<BR>
His soul is burning for the strife,<BR>
Nor dreads the jeopardy of life.<BR>
He trembles as he moves, for ire,<BR>
And bends around his glance of fire.<BR>
Next, like a cloud that veils the sides,<BR>
A chieftain of terrific size,<BR>
Conspicuous mid the V&aacute;nars, comes<BR>
With battle shout like rolling drums,<BR>
'Tis Panas, trained in war and tried,<BR>

<P>

<P>
Who dwells on P&aacute;riy&aacute;tra's side.<BR>
He, far away, the chief who throws<BR>
A glory o'er the marshalled rows<BR>
That ranged behind their captain stand<BR>
Exulting on the ocean strand,<BR>
Is Vinata the fierce in fight.<BR>
Pre&euml;minent like Dardur's height.<BR>
That chieftain bending down to drink<BR>
On lovely Ven&aacute;'s verdant brink,<BR>
Is Krathan; now he lifts his eyes<BR>
And thee to mortal fray defies.<BR>
Next Gavaya comes, whose haughty mind<BR>
Scorns all the warriors of his kind.<BR>
He comes to trample - such his boast -<BR>
On Lank&aacute; with his single host.'<BR>
