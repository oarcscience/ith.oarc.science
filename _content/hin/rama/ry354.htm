<P>
Again the V&aacute;nar chief began<BR>
Each chamber, bower, and hall to scan.<BR>
In vain: he found not her he sought,<BR>
And pondered thus in bitter thought:<BR>
'Ah me the Maithil queen is slain:<BR>
She, ever true and free from stain,<BR>
The fiend's entreaty has denied.<BR>
And by his cruel hand has died.<BR>
Or has she sunk, by terror killed,<BR>
When first she saw the palace filled<BR>
With female monsters evil miened<BR>
Who wait upon the robber fiend?<BR>
No battle fought, no might displayed,<BR>
In vain this anxious search is made;<BR>
Nor shall my steps, made slow by shame,<BR>
Because I failed to find the dame,<BR>
Back to our lord the king be bent,<BR>
For he is swift to punishment.<BR>
In every bower my feet have been,<BR>
The dames of R&aacute;van I seen;<BR>
But R&aacute;ma's spouse I seek in vain,<BR>
And all my toil is fruitless pain.<BR>
How shall I meet the V&aacute;nar<BR>
I left upon the ocean strand?<BR>
How, when they bid me speak, proclaim<BR>
These tidings of defeat and shame?<BR>
How shall I look on Angad's eye?<BR>
What words will J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n<BR>
Yet dauntless hearts will never fail<BR>
To win success though foes assail,<BR>
And I this sorrow will subdue<BR>
And search the palace through and through,<BR>
Exploring with my cautious tread<BR>
Each spot as yet unvisited.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Again he turned him to explore<BR>
Each chamber, hall, and corridor,<BR>
And arbour bright with scented bloom.<BR>
And lodge and cell and picture-room.<BR>

With eager eye and noiseless feet<BR>
He passed through many a cool retreat<BR>
Where women lay in slumber drowned;<BR>
But S&iacute;t&aacute; nowhere found.<BR>
