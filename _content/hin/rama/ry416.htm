<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XVII.: VIBH&Iacute;SHAN'S FLIGHT.</H3>
<P>
Soon as his bitter words were said,<BR>
To Raghu's sons Vibh&iacute;shan fled.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_937"></A><A HREF="#fn_937"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Their eyes the V&aacute;nar leaders raised<BR>
And on the air-borne B&aacute;khshas gazed,<BR>
Bright as a thunderbolt, in size<BR>
Like Meru's peak that cleaves the skies,<BR>
In gorgeous panoply arrayed<BR>
Like Indra's self he stood displayed,<BR>
And four attendants brave and bold<BR>
Shone by their chief in mail and gold.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va then with dark surmise<BR>
Bent on their forms his wondering eyes,<BR>
And thus in hasty words confessed<BR>
The anxious doubt that moved his breast:<BR>
' Look, look ye V&aacute;nars, and beware:<BR>
That giant chief sublime in air<BR>
With other four in bright array<BR>
Comes armed to conquer and to slay.'<BR>

<P>

Soon as his warning speech they heard,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chieftains undeterred<BR>
Seized fragments of the rock and trees,<BR>
And made reply in words like these:<BR>
'We wait thy word: the order give,<BR>
And these thy foes shall cease to live.<BR>
Command us, mighty King, and all<BR>
Lifeless upon the earth shall fall.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Meanwhile Vibh&iacute;shan with the four<BR>
Stood high above the ocean shore.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va and the chiefs he spied,<BR>
And raised his mighty voice and cried:<BR>
'From R&aacute;van, lord of giants, I<BR>
His brother, named Vibh&iacute;shan, fly.<BR>
From Janasth&aacute;n he stole the child<BR>
Of Janak by his art beguiled,<BR>
And in his palace locked and barred<BR>
Surrounds her with a R&aacute;kshas guard,<BR>
I bade him, plied with varied lore,<BR>
His hapless prisoner restore.<BR>
But he, by Fate to ruin sent,<BR>
No credence to my counsel lent,<BR>
Mad as the fevered wretch who sees<BR>
And scorns the balm to bring him ease.<BR>
He scorned the sage advice I gave,<BR>
He spurned me like a base-born slave.<BR>
I left my children and my wife,<BR>
And fly to Raghu's son for life.<BR>
I pray thee, V&aacute;nar chieftain, speed<BR>
To him who saves in hour of need,<BR>
And tell him famed in distant lands<BR>
That, suppliant here Vibh&iacute;shan stands.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The R&aacute;kshas ceased: Sugriva hied<BR>
To Raghu's noble son and cried:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'A stranger from the giant host,<BR>
Borne o'er the sea, has reached the coast<BR>
A secret foe, he comes to slay,<BR>
As owls attack their heedless prey.<BR>
'Tis thine, O King, in time of need<BR>
To watch, to counsel, and to lead,<BR>
Our V&aacute;nar legions to dispose,<BR>
And guard us from our crafty foes.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan from the giants' isle.<BR>
King R&aacute;van's brother, comes with guile<BR>
And, feigning from his king to flee,<BR>
Seeks refuge Raghu's son, with thee.<BR>
Arise, O R&aacute;ma, and prevent<BR>
By bold attack his dark intent.<BR>
Who comes in friendly guise prepared<BR>
To slay thee by his arts ensnared.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus urged Sugr&iacute;va famed for lore<BR>
Of moving words, and spoke no more.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma thus in turn addressed<BR>
The bold Han&uacute;m&aacute;n and the rest:<BR>
'Chiefs of the Van&aacute;r legions each<BR>
Of you heard Sugr&iacute;va's speech.<BR>
What think ye now in time of fear,<BR>
When peril and distress are near,<BR>
In every doubt the wise depend<BR>
For counsel on a faithful friend'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They heard his gracious words, and then<BR>
Spake reverent to the lord of men:<BR>
'O Raghu's son, thou knowest well<BR>
All things of heaven and earth and hell.<BR>
'Tis but thy friendship bids us speak<BR>
The counsel R&aacute;ma need not seek.<BR>
So duteous, brave, and true art thou,<BR>
Heroic, faithful to thy vow.<BR>
Deep in the scriptures, trained and tried,<BR>
Still in thy friends wilt thou confide.<BR>
Let each of us in turn impart<BR>
The secret counsel of his heart,<BR>
And strive to win his chief's assent.<BR>
By force of wisest argument.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They ceased and Angad thus began:<BR>
'With jealous eye the stranger scan:<BR>
Not yet with trusting heart receive<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan, nor his tale believe.<BR>
These giants wandering far and wide<BR>
Their evil nature falsely hide,<BR>
And watching with malignant skill<BR>
Assail us when we fear no ill.<BR>
Well ponder every hope and fear<BR>
Until thy doubtful course be clear;<BR>
Then own his merit or detect<BR>
His guile, and welcome or reject.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Sarabhu the bold and brave<BR>
In turn his prudent sentence gave:<BR>
'Yea, R&aacute;ma, send a skilful spy<BR>
With keenest tact to test and try.<BR>
Then let the stranger, as is just,<BR>
Obtain or be refused thy trust.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then he whose heart was rich in store<BR>
Of scripture's life-directing lore.<BR>
King J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n, stood forth and cried:<BR>
'Suspect, suspect a foe allied<BR>
With R&aacute;van lord of Lank&aacute;'s isle,<BR>
And R&aacute;kshas sin and R&aacute;kshas guile."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Maiuda, wisest chief, who knew<BR>
The wrong, the right, the false, the true,<BR>
Pondered a while, then silence broke,<BR>
And thus his sober counsel spoke:<BR>
'Let one with gracious speech draw near<BR>
And gently charm Vibh&iacute;shan's ear,<BR>
Till he the soothing witchery feel<BR>
And all his secret heart reveal.<BR>
So thou his aims and hopes shalt know,<BR>
And hail the friend or shun the foe.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Not he,' Han&uacute;m&aacute;n cried, 'not he<BR>
Who taught the Gods,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_938"></A><A HREF="#fn_938"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>  may rival thee,<BR>
Supreme in power of quickest sense,<BR>
First in the art of eloquence.<BR>
But hear me soothly speak, O King,<BR>
And learn the hope to which I cling.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan comes no cratty spy:<BR>
Urged by his brother's fault to fly.<BR>
With righteous soul that loathes the sin,<BR>
He fled from Lank&aacute; and his kin.<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_440"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 440</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
If strangers question, doubt will rise<BR>
And chill the heart of one so wise.<BR>
Marred by distrust the parle will end,<BR>
And then wilt lose a faithful friend.<BR>
Nor let it seem so light a thing<BR>
To sound a stranger's heart, O King.<BR>
And he, I ween, whate'er he say,<BR>
Will ne'er an evil thought betray.<BR>
He comes a friend in happy time,<BR>
Loathing his brother for his crime.<BR>
His ear has heard thine old renown,<BR>
The might that struck King B&aacute;li down,<BR>
And set Sugr&iacute;va on the throne.<BR>
And looking now to thee alone<BR>
He comes thy matchless aid to win<BR>
And punish R&aacute;van for his sin.<BR>
Thus have I tried thy heart to move,<BR>
And thus Vibh&iacute;shan's truth to prove.<BR>
Still in his friendship I confide;<BR>
But ponder, wisest, and decide.'<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_937"></A><A HREF="ry416.htm#fr_937">438:1b</A>  This dessertion to the enemy is somewhat
abrupt, and is narrated with brevity
not usual with V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki. In the Bengal
recension the preceding speakers and
speeches differ considerably from those
given in the text which I follow. Vibhishan
is kicked from his seat by R&aacute;van, and
then, after telling his mother what has
happened, he flies to Mount Kail&aacute;sa
where he has an interview with Siva, and
by his advice seeks R&aacute;ma and the Vanar
army.</P>
