<P>
Soon as the shades of night had fled,<BR>
Thus to the wise Sumantra said<BR>
The happy king, while priest and peer,<BR>
Each in his place, were standing near:<BR>
'Let all my treasurers to-day,<BR>
Set foremost in the long array,<BR>
With gold and precious gems supplied<BR>
In bounteous store, together ride.<BR>
And send you out a mighty force,<BR>
Foot, chariot, elephant, and horse.<BR>
Besides, let many a car of state,<BR>
And noblest steeds, my will await.<BR>
Vas'ishtha, V&aacute;madeva sage,<BR>
And M&aacute;rkandeya's reverend age,<BR>
J&aacute;v&aacute;li, Kas'yap's godlike seed,<BR>
And wise K&aacute;ty&aacute;yana, shall lead.<BR>
Thy care, Sumantra, let it be<BR>
To yoke a chariot now for me,<BR>
That so we part without delay:<BR>
These envoys hasten me away.'<BR>

<P>
So fared he forth. That host, with speed,<BR>
Quadruple, as the king decreed,<BR>
With priests to head the bright array,<BR>
Followed the monarch on his way.<BR>
Four days they travelled on the road,<BR>
And eve Videha's kingdom showed.<BR>
Janak had left his royal seat<BR>
The venerable king to greet,<BR>
And, noblest, with these words addressed<BR>
That noblest lord, his happy guest:<BR>
'Hail, best of kings: a blessed fate<BR>
Has led thee, Monarch, to my state.<BR>
Thy sons, supreme in high emprise,<BR>
Will gladden now their father's eyes.<BR>
And high my fate, that hither leads<BR>
Vas'ishtha, bright with holy deeds,<BR>
Girt with these sages far-renowned,<BR>
Like Indra with the Gods around.<BR>
Joy! joy! for vanquished are my foes:<BR>
Joy! for my house in glory grows,<BR>
With Raghu's noblest sons allied,<BR>
Supreme in strength and valour's pride.<BR>
To-morrow with its early light<BR>
Will shine on my completed rite.<BR>
Then, sanctioned by the saints and thee,<BR>
The marriage of thy R&aacute;ma see.'<BR>

<P>
Then Das'aratha, best of those<BR>
Whose speech in graceful order flows,<BR>
With gathered saints on every side,<BR>
Thus to the lord of earth replied:<BR>
'A truth is this I long have known,<BR>
A favour is the giver's own.<BR>
What thou shalt bid, O good and true,<BR>
We, as our power permits, will do.'<BR>

<P>
That answer of the truthful lord,<BR>
With virtuous worth and honour stored,<BR>
Janak, Videha's noble king,<BR>
Heard gladly, greatly marvelling.<BR>
With bosoms filled with pleasure met<BR>
Long-parted saint and anchoret,<BR>
And linked in friendship's tie they spent<BR>
The peaceful night in great content.<BR>

<P>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman thither sped,<BR>
By sainted Vis'v&aacute;mitra led,<BR>
And bent in filial love to greet<BR>
Their father, and embraced his feet.<BR>
The aged king, rejoiced to hear<BR>
And see again his children dear,<BR>
Honoured by Janak's thoughtful care,<BR>
With great enjoyment rested there.<BR>
King Janak, with attentive heed,<BR>
Consulted first his daughters' need,<BR>
And ordered all to speed the rite;<BR>
Then rested also for the night.<BR>
