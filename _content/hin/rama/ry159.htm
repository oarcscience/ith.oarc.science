<P>
Ere yet the dawn had ushered in<BR>
The day should see the march begin,<BR>
Herald and bard who rightly knew<BR>
Each nice degree of honour due,<BR>
Their loud auspicious voices raised.<BR>
And royal Bharat blessed and praised.<BR>
With sticks of gold the drum they smote,<BR>
Which thundered out its deafening note,<BR>
Blew loud the sounding shell, and blent<BR>
Each high and low-toned instrument.<BR>
The mingled sound of drum and horn<BR>
Through all the air was quickly borne,<BR>
And as in Bharat's ear it rang,<BR>
Gave the sad prince another pang.<BR>
&nbsp; Then Bharat starting from repose,<BR>
Stilled the glad sounds that round him rose,<BR>
'I am not king--no more mistake:'<BR>
Then to S'atrughna thus he spake:<BR>
'O see what general wrongs succeed<BR>
Sprung from Kaikey&iacute;'s evil deed!<BR>
The king my sire has died and thrown<BR>
Fresh miseries on me alone.<BR>
The royal bliss, on duty based.<BR>
Which our just high-souled father graced,<BR>
Wanders in doubt and sore distress<BR>
Like a tossed vessel rudderless.<BR>
And he who was our lordly stay<BR>
Roams in the forest far away,<BR>
Expelled by this my mother, who<BR>
To duty's law is most untrue.'<BR>
&nbsp; As royal Bharat thus gave vent<BR>
To bitter grief in wild lament,<BR>
Gazing upon his face the crowd<BR>
Of pitying women wept aloud.<BR>
His lamentation scarce was o'er,<BR>
When Saint Vas'ishtha, skilled in lore<BR>
Of royal duty, dear to fame,<BR>
To join the great assembly came.<BR>
Girt by disciples ever true<BR>
Still nearer to that hall he drew,<BR>
Resplendent, heavenly to behold,<BR>
Adorned with wealth of gems and gold:<BR>
E'en so a man in duty tried<BR>
Draws near to meet his virtuous bride.<BR>
He reached his golden seat o'erlaid<BR>
With coverlet of rich brocade.<BR>
There sat, in all the Vedas read,<BR>
And called the messengers, and said:<BR>
'Go forth, let Br&aacute;hman, Warrior, peer,<BR>
And every captain gather here:<BR>
Let all attentive hither throng:<BR>
Go, hasten: we delay too long.<BR>
S'atrughna, glorious Bharat bring,<BR>
The noble children of the king, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

Yudh&aacute;jit &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="ry160.htm#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and Sumantra, all<BR>
The truthful and the virtuous call,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ended: soon a mighty sound<BR>
Of thickening tumult rose around,<BR>
As to the hall they bent their course<BR>
With car, and elephant, and horse,<BR>
The people all with glad acclaim<BR>
Welcomed Prince Bharat as he came:<BR>
E'en as they loved their king to greet,<BR>
Or as the Gods Lord Indra &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="ry160.htm#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> meet.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The vast assembly shone as fair<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With Bharat's kingly face<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As Das'aratha's self were there<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To glorify the place.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  It gleamed like some unruffled lake<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Where monsters huge of mould<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With many a snake their pastime take<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    O'er shells, sand, gems, and gold.<BR>
