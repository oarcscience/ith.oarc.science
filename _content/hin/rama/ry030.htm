<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVIII.: THE DEATH OF T&Aacute;DAK&Aacute;</H3>
<P>
Thus spoke the saint. Each vigorous word<BR>
The noble monarch's offspring heard,<BR>
And, reverent hands together laid,<BR>
His answer to the hermit made:<BR>
'My sire and mother bade me aye<BR>
Thy word, O mighty Saint, obey<BR>
So will I, O most glorious, kill<BR>
This T&aacute;dak&aacute; who joys in ill,<BR>
For such my sire's, and such thy will.<BR>
To aid with mine avenging hand<BR>
The Br&aacute;hmans, kine, and all the land,<BR>
Obedient, heart and soul, I stand.'<BR>

<P>
Thus spoke the tamer of the foe,<BR>
And by the middle grasped his bow.<BR>
Strongly he drew the sounding string<BR>
That made the distant welkin ring.<BR>
Scared by the mighty clang the deer<BR>
That roamed the forest shook with fear.<BR>
And T&aacute;dak&aacute; the echo heard,<BR>
And rose in haste from slumber stirred.<BR>
In wild amaze, her soul aflame<BR>
With fury toward the spot she came.<BR>
When that foul shape of evil mien<BR>
And stature vast as e'er was seen<BR>
The wrathful son of Raghu eyed,<BR>
He thus unto his brother cried:<BR>
'Her dreadful shape, O Lakshman, see,<BR>
A form to shudder at and flee.<BR>
The hideous monster's very view<BR>
Would cleave a timid heart in two.<BR>
Behold the demon hard to smite,<BR>
Defended by her magic might.<BR>
My hand shall stay her course to-day,<BR>
And shear her nose and ears away.<BR>
No heart have I her life to take:<BR>
I spare it for her sex's sake.<BR>
My will is but, with 'minished force,<BR>
To check her in her evil course.'<BR>
While thus he spoke, by rage impelled<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Roaring as she came nigh,<BR>
The fiend her course at R&aacute;ma held<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With huge arms tossed on high.<BR>
Her, rushing on, the seer assailed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With a loud cry of hate;<BR>
And thus the sons of Raghu hailed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Fight, and be fortunate.'<BR>
Then from the earth a horrid cloud<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of dust the demon raised,<BR>
And for awhile in darkling shroud<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wrapt Raghu's sons amazed.<BR>
Then calling on her magic power<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fearful fight to wage,<BR>
She smote him with a stony shower,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Till R&aacute;ma burned with rage.<BR>
Then pouring forth his arrowy rain<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That stony flood to stay,<BR>

<P>
With winged darts, as she charged amain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He shore her hands away.<BR>
As T&aacute;dak&aacute; still thundered near<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus maimed by R&aacute;ma's blows,<BR>
Lakshman in fury severed sheer<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The monster's ears and nose.<BR>
Assuming by her magic skill,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A fresh and fresh disguise,<BR>
She tried a thousand shapes at will,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then vanished from their eyes.<BR>
When G&aacute;dhi's son of high renown<BR>
Still saw the stony rain pour down<BR>
Upon each princely warrior's head,<BR>
With words of wisdom thus he said:<BR>
'Enough of mercy, R&aacute;ma, lest<BR>
This sinful evil-working pest,<BR>
Disturber of each holy rite,<BR>
Repair by magic arts her might.<BR>
Without delay the fiend should die,<BR>
For, see, the twilight hour is nigh.<BR>
And at the joints of night and day<BR>
Such giant foes are hard to slay.'<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, skilful to direct<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His arrow to the sound,<BR>
With shafts the mighty demon checked<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Who rained her stones around.<BR>
She sore impeded and beset<BR>
By R&aacute;ma and his arrowy net,<BR>
Though skilled in guile and magic lore,<BR>
Rushed on the brothers with a roar.<BR>
Deformed, terrific, murderous, dread,<BR>
Swift as the levin on she sped,<BR>
Like cloudy pile in autumn's sky,<BR>
Lifting her two vast arms on high,<BR>
When R&aacute;ma smote her with a dart,<BR>
Shaped like a crescent, to the heart.<BR>
Sore wounded by the shaft that came<BR>
With lightning speed and surest aim,<BR>
Blood spouting from her mouth and side.<BR>
She fell upon the earth and died.<BR>
Soon as the Lord who rules the sky<BR>
Saw the dread monster lifeless lie,<BR>
He called aloud, Well done! well done!<BR>
And the Gods honoured Raghu's son.<BR>
Standing in heaven the Thousand-eyed,<BR>
With all the Immortals, joying cried:<BR>
'Lift up thine eyes, O Saint, and see<BR>
The Gods and Indra nigh to thee.<BR>
This deed of R&aacute;ma's boundless might<BR>
Has filled our bosoms with delight,<BR>
Now, for our will would have it so,<BR>
To Raghu's son some favour show.<BR>
Invest him with the power which naught<BR>
But penance gains and holy thought,<BR>
Those heavenly arms on him bestow<BR>
To thee entrusted long ago<BR>
By great Kris&aacute;s'va best of kings,<BR>
Son of the Lord of living things,<BR>
More fit recipient none can be<BR>
Than he who joys it following thee<BR>
And for our sakes the monarch's seed<BR>
Has yet to do a mighty deed.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke; and all the heavenly train<BR>
Rejoicing sought their homes again,<BR>
While honour to the saint they paid.<BR>
Then came the evening's twilight shade,<BR>
The best of hermits overjoyed<BR>
To know the monstrous fiend destroyed,<BR>
His lips on R&aacute;ma's forehead pressed,<BR>
And thus the conquering chief addressed:<BR>
'O R&aacute;ma gracious to the sight.<BR>
Here will we pass the present night,<BR>
And with the morrow's earliest ray<BR>
Bend to my hermitage our way.'<BR>
The son of Das'aratha heard,<BR>
Delighted, Vis'v&aacute;mitra's word,<BR>
And as he bade, that night he spent<BR>
In T&aacute;dak&aacute;'s wild wood, content.<BR>
And the grove shone that happy day,<BR>
Freed from the curse that on it lay,<BR>
Like Chaitraratha &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="ry031.htm#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> fair and gay.<BR>
