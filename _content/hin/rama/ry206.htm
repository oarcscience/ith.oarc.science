<P>
So R&aacute;ma and Sumttr&aacute;'s son,<BR>
When every honour due was done,<BR>
Slept through the night. When morning<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  broke,<BR>
The heroes from their rest awoke.<BR>
Betimes the son of Raghu rose,<BR>
With gentle S&iacute;t&aacute;, from repose,<BR>
And sipped the cool delicious wave<BR>
Sweet with the scent the lotus gave,<BR>
Then to the Gods and sacred flame<BR>
The heroes and the lady came,<BR>
And bent their heads in honour meet<BR>
Within the hermit's pure retreat.<BR>
When every stain was purged away,<BR>
They saw the rising Lord of Day:<BR>
Then to Sut&iacute;khna's side they went,<BR>
And softly spoke, most reverent:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Well have we slept, O holy lord,<BR>
Honoured of thee by all adored:<BR>
Now leave to journey forth we pray:<BR>
These hermits urge us on our way.<BR>
We haste to visit, wandering by,<BR>
The ascetics' homes that round you lie,<BR>
And roaming Dandak's mighty wood<BR>
To view each saintly brotherhood,<BR>
For thy permission now we sue,<BR>
With these high saints to duty true,<BR>
By penance taught each sense to tame,--<BR>
In lustre like the smokeless flame.<BR>
Ere on our brows the sun can beat<BR>
With fierce intolerable heat.<BR>
Like some unworthy lord who wins<BR>
His power by tyranny and sins,<BR>
O saint, we fain would part.' The three<BR>
Bent humbly to the dovotee.<BR>
He raised the princes as they pressed<BR>
His feet, and strained them to his breast;<BR>
And then the chief of devotees<BR>
Bespake them both in words like these.<BR>
'Go with thy brother, R&aacute;ma, go,<BR>
Pursue thy path untouched by woe:<BR>
Go with thy faithful S&iacute;t&aacute;, she<BR>
Still like a shadow follows thee<BR>
Roam Dandak wood observing well<BR>
The pleasant homes where hermits dwell,--<BR>
Pure saints whose ordered souls adhere<BR>
To penance rites and vows austere.<BR>

<P>
There plenteous roots and berries grow,<BR>
And noble trees their blossoms show,<BR>
And gentle deer and birds of air<BR>
In peaceful troops are gathered there.<BR>
There see the full-blown lotus stud<BR>
The bosom of the lucid flood,<BR>
And watch the joyous mallard shake<BR>
The reeds that fringe the pool and lake.<BR>
See with delighted eye the rill<BR>
Leap sparkling from her parent hill,<BR>
And hear the woods that round thee lie<BR>
Re&euml;cho to the peacock's cry.<BR>
And as I bid thy brother, so,<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;'s child, I bid thee go.<BR>
Go forth, these varied beauties see,<BR>
And then once more return to me.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spake the sage Sutikshna: both<BR>
The chiefs assented, nothing loth.<BR>
Round him with circling steps they paced,<BR>
Then for the road prepared with haste.<BR>
Tnere S&iacute;t&aacute; stood, the dame long-eyed,<BR>
Fair quivers round their waists she tied,<BR>
And gave each prince his trusty bow,<BR>
And sword which ne*er a spot might know.<BR>
Each took his quiver from her *and.<BR>
And clanging bow and gleaming brand:<BR>
Then from the hermits' home the two<BR>
Went forth each woodland scene to view.<BR>
Eavh beauteous in the bloom of age,<BR>
Dismissed by that illustrious sage,<BR>
With bow and sword accoutred, hied<BR>
Away, and S&iacute;t&aacute; by their side.<BR>
