The hermit heard with high content<BR>
That speech so wondrous eloquent,<BR>
And while each hair with joy arose,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>

He thus made answer at the close:<BR>
'Good is thy speech O noble King,<BR>
And like thyself in everything.<BR>
So should their lips be wisdom-fraught<BR>
Whom kings begot, Vas'ishtha taught.<BR>
The favour which I came to seek<BR>
Thou grantest ere my tongue can speak.<BR>
But let my tale attention claim,<BR>
And hear the need for which I came,<BR>
O King, as Scripture texts allow,<BR>
A holy rite employs me now.<BR>
Two fiends who change their forms at will<BR>
Impede that rite with cursed skill.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Oft when the task is nigh complete,<BR>
These worst of fiends my toil defeat,<BR>
Throw bits of bleeding flesh, and o'er<BR>
The altar shed a stream of gore.<BR>
When thus the rite is mocked and stayed,<BR>
And all my pious hopes delayed,<BR>
Cast down in heart the spot I leave,<BR>
And spent with fruitless labour grieve.<BR>
Nor can I, checked by prudence, dare<BR>
Let loose my fury on them there:<BR>
The muttered curse, the threatening word,<BR>
In such a rite must ne'er be heard.<BR>
Thy grace the rite from check can free.<BR>
And yield the fruit I long to see.<BR>
Thy duty bids thee, King, defend<BR>
The suffering guest, the suppliant friend.<BR>
Give me thy son, thine eldest born,<BR>
Whom locks like raven's wings adorn,<BR>
That hero youth, the truly brave,<BR>
Of thee, O glorious King, I crave,<BR>
For he can lay those demons low<BR>
Who mar my rites and work me woe:<BR>
My power shall shield the youth from harm,<BR>
And heavenly might shall nerve his arm.<BR>
And on my champion will I shower<BR>
Unnumbered gifts of varied power,<BR>
Such gifts as shall ensure his fame<BR>
And spread through all the worlds his name.<BR>
Be sure those fiends can never stand<BR>
Before the might of R&aacute;ma's hand,<BR>
And mid the best and bravest none<BR>
Can slay that pair but Raghu's son.<BR>
Entangled in the toils of Fate<BR>
Those sinners, proud and obstinate,<BR>
Are, in their fury overbold,<BR>
No match for R&aacute;ma mighty-souled.<BR>
Nor let a father's breast give way<BR>
Too far to fond affection's sway.<BR>
Count thou the fiends already slain:<BR>
My word is pledged, nor pledged in vain.<BR>
I know the hero R&aacute;ma well<BR>


<P>


<P>
In whom high thoughts and valour dwell;<BR>
So does Vas'ishtha, so do these<BR>
Engaged in long austerities.<BR>
If thou would do the righteous deed,<BR>
And win high fame, thy virtue's meed,<BR>
Fame that on earth shall last and live,<BR>
To me. great King, thy R&aacute;ma give.<BR>
If to the words that I have said,<BR>
With Saint Vas'ishtha at their head<BR>
Thy holy men, O King, agree,<BR>
Then let thy R&aacute;ma go with me.<BR>
Ten nights my sacrifice will last,<BR>
And ere the stated time be past<BR>
Those wicked fiends, those impious twain,<BR>
Must fall by wondrous R&aacute;ma slain.<BR>
Let not the hours, I warn thee, fly,<BR>
Fixt for the rite, unheeded by;<BR>
Good luck have thou, O royal Chief,<BR>
Nor give thy heart to needless grief."<BR>

<P>
Thus in fair words with virtue fraught<BR>
The pious glorious saint besought.<BR>
But the good speech with poignant sting<BR>
Pierced ear and bosom of the king,<BR>
Who, stabbed with pangs too sharp to bear,<BR>
Fell prostrate and lay fainting there.<BR>
