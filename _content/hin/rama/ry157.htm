<P>
Now when the sun's returning ray<BR>
Had ushered in the fourteenth day,<BR>
The gathered peers of state addressed<BR>
To Bharat's ear their new request:<BR>
'Our lord to heaven has parted hence,<BR>
Long served with deepest reverence;<BR>
R&aacute;ma, the eldest, far from home,<BR>
And Lakshman, in the forest roam.<BR>
O Prince, of mighty fame, be thou<BR>
Our guardian and our monarch now,<BR>
Lest secret plot or foeman's hate<BR>
Assail our unprotected state<BR>
With longing eyes, O Lord of men,<BR>
To thee look friend and citizen,<BR>
And ready is each sacred thing<BR>
To consecrate our chosen king.<BR>
Come, Bharat, and accept thine own<BR>
Ancient hereditary throne.<BR>
Thee let the priests this day install<BR>
As monarch to preserve us all.'<BR>
&nbsp; Around the sacred gear he bent<BR>
His circling footsteps reverent,<BR>
And, firm to vows he would not break,<BR>
Thus to the gathered people spake:<BR>
'The eldest son is ever king:<BR>
So rules the house from which we spring:<BR>
Nor should ye, Lords, like men unwise,<BR>
With words like these to wrong advise.<BR>
R&aacute;ma is eldest born, and he<BR>
The ruler of the land shall be.<BR>
Now to the woods will I repair,<BR>
Five years and nine to lodge me there.<BR>
Assemble straight a mighty force,<BR>
Cars, elephants, and foot and horse,<BR>
For I will follow on his track<BR>
And bring my eldest brother back.<BR>
Whate'er the rites of throning need<BR>
Placed on a car the way shall lead:<BR>
The sacred vessels I will take<BR>
To the wild wood for R&aacute;ma's sake,<BR>
I o'er the lion prince's head<BR>
The sanctifying balm will shed,<BR>
And bring him, as the fire they bring<BR>
Forth from the shrine, with triumphing.<BR>
Nor will I let my mother's greed<BR>
In this her cherished aim succeed:<BR>
In pathless wilds will I remain,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma here as king shall reign.<BR>
To make the rough ways smooth and clear<BR>
Send workman out and pioneer:<BR>
Let skilful men attend beside<BR>
Our way through pathless spots to guide.'<BR>
As thus the royal Bharat spake,<BR>
Ordaining all for R&aacute;ma's sake,<BR>
The audience gave with one accord<BR>
Auspicious answer to their lord:<BR>
'Be royal Fortune aye benign<BR>
To thee for this good speech of thine,<BR>
Who wishest still thine elder's hand<BR>
To rule with kingly sway the land.'<BR>
&nbsp; Their glorious speech, their favouring cries<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Made his proud bosom swell:<BR>
&nbsp; And from the prince's noble eyes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The tears of rapture fell. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="ry158.htm#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
