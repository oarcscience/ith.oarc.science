With practiced eye the king reviewed<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' counties multitude,<BR>
And, joying that his hest was done,<BR>
Thus spake to Raghu's mighty son:<BR>
'See, all the V&aacute;nar hosts who fear<BR>
My sovereign might are gathered here.<BR>
Chiefs strong as Indra's self, who speed<BR>
Wher'er they list, these armies lead.<BR>
Fierce and terrific to the view<BR>

Famed in all lands for souls afire<BR>
With lofty thoughts, they never tire,<BR>
O'er hill and vale they wander free,<BR>
And islets of the distant sea.<BR>
And these gathered myriads, all<BR>
Will serve thee, R&aacute;ma, at thy call.<BR>
Whate'er thy heart advises, say:<BR>
Thy mandates will the host obey.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then answered R&aacute;ma, as he pressed<BR>
The V&aacute;nar monarch to his breast:<BR>
'O search for my lost S&iacute;t&aacute;, strive<BR>
To find her if she still survive:<BR>
And in thy wondrous wisdom trace<BR>
Fierce R&aacute;van to his dwelling-place.<BR>
And when by toil and search we know<BR>
Where S&iacute;t&aacute; lies and where the foe,<BR>
With thee, dear friend, will I devise<BR>
Fit means to end the enterprise.<BR>
Not mine, not Lakshman's is the power<BR>
To guide us in the doubtful hour.<BR>
Thou, sovereign of the *Vanars, thou<BR>
Must be our hope and leader now.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: at King Sugr&iacute;va's call<BR>
Near came a V&aacute;nar strong and tall.<BR>
Huge as a towering mountain, loud<BR>
As some tremendous thunder cloud,<BR>
A prince who warlike legions led:<BR>
To him his sovereign turned and said:<BR>
'Go, take ten thousand &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_662"></A><A HREF="#fn_662"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of our race<BR>
Well trained in lore of time and place,<BR>
And search the eastern region; through<BR>
Groves, woods, and hills thy way pursue,<BR>
There seek for S&iacute;t&aacute;, trace the spot<BR>
Where R&aacute;van hides, and weary not.<BR>

Search where the torrent floods that rend<BR>

Search dark abysses where they rave,<BR>
Search mountain slope and wood and cave<BR>
Then on with rapid feet and gain<BR>
The inlands of the fearful main<BR>
Where, tortured by the tempest's lash,<BR>
Against rude rocks the billows d*ash:<BR>
An ocean like a sable cloud,<BR>
Whose margent monstrous serpents crowd;<BR>

An ocean rising with a roar<BR>
To beat upon an iron shore.<BR>
On, onward still! your feet shall tread<BR>
Shores of the sea whose waves are red,<BR>
Where spreading wide your eyes shall see<BR>
The guilt-tormenting cotton tree &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And the wild spot where Garud &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> dwells<BR>
Which gems adorn and ocean shells,<BR>
High as Kall&aacute;sa, nobly decked,<BR>

In each foul shape they love to wear,<BR>
Numbing the soul with terror's chill,<BR>
Hang from the summit of the hill.<BR>
When darts the sun his earliest beam<BR>
They plunge them in the ocean stream,<BR>
New vigour from his rays obtain,<BR>
And hang upon the rocks again<BR>
Speed onward still: your steps shall be<BR>
At length beside the Milky Sea<BR>
Whose everv ripple as it curls<BR>
Gleams glorious with its wealth of pearls.<BR>
Amid that sea like pale clouds spread<BR>
The white Mount Rishabh &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_680"></A><A HREF="#fn_680"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> rears his head.<BR>
About the mountain's glorious waist<BR>
Woods redolent of bloom are braced.<BR>
A lake where lotuses unfold<BR>
Their silver buds with threads of gold,<BR>
Sudar*s'an ever bright and fair<BR>
Where white swans sport, lies gleaming there,<BR>
The wandering Kinnar's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_681"></A><A HREF="#fn_681"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> dear resort,<BR>

On! leave the Milky Sea behind:<BR>
Another flood your search shall find,<BR>
A waste of waters, wild and drear.<BR>
That chills each living heart with fear.<BR>
There see the horse's awful head,<BR>
Wrath-born, that flames in Ocean's bed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_683"></A><A HREF="#fn_683"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
There rises up a fearful cry<BR>
From the sea things that move thereby,<BR>
When, helpless, powerless for flight,<BR>
They gaze upon the horrid sight.<BR>
Past to the northern shore, and then<BR>
Beyond the flood three leagues and ten<BR>
Your wondering glances will behold<BR>
Mount J&aacute;tar&uacute;pa &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_684"></A><A HREF="#fn_684"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> bright with gold.<BR>
There like the young moon pale of hue<BR>
The monstrous serpent &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_685"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> will ye view,<BR>
The earth's supporter, whose bright eyes<BR>
Resemble lotus leaves in size.<BR>
He rests upon the mountain's brow,<BR>
And all the Gods before him bow.<BR>
Ananta with a thousand heads<BR>
His length in robes of azure spreads.<BR>
A triple-headed palm of gold--<BR>
Meet standard for the lofty-souled--<BR>
Springs towering from the mountain's crest<BR>
Beneath whose shade he loves to rest,<BR>
So that in eastern realms each God<BR>
May use it as a measuring-rod.<BR>
Beyond, with burning gold aglow,<BR>
The eastern steep his peaks will show,<BR>
Which in unrivalled glory rise<BR>
A hundred leagues to pierce the skies,<BR>
And all the neighbouring air is bright<BR>
With golden trees that clothe the height.<BR>
A lofty peak uprises there<BR>
Ten leagues in height and one league square<BR>
*Saumanas*, wrought of glistering gold,<BR>
Ne'er to be loosened from its hold.<BR>
There his first step Lord Vishnu placed<BR>
When through the universe he paced,<BR>
And with his second lightly pressed<BR>
The loftiest peak of Meru's crest.<BR>
When north of Jambudw&iacute;p &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_686"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A> the sun<BR>

A portion of his course has run.<BR>
And hangs above this mountain height,<BR>
Then creatures see the genial light.<BR>
Vaikh&aacute;nases,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> saints far renowned,<BR>
And B&aacute;laklulvas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_688"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> love the ground<BR>
Where in their glory half divine.<BR>
Touched by the morning glow, they shine<BR>
The light that flashes from that steep<BR>
Illumines all Sudars'andwip,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_689"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
And on each creature, as it glows,<BR>
The sight and strength of life bestows.<BR>
Search well that mountain's woody side<BR>
If R&aacute;van there his captive hide.<BR>
The rising sun, the golden hill<BR>
The air with growing splendours fill,<BR>
Till flashes from the east the red<BR>
Of morning with the light they shed.<BR>
This, where the sun begins his state,<BR>
Is earth and heaven's most eastern gate.<BR>
Through all the mountain forest seek<BR>
By waterfall and cave and peak.<BR>
Search every nook and bosky dell,<BR>
If R&aacute;van there with S&iacute;t&aacute; dwell.<BR>
There, V&aacute;nars, there your steps must stay:<BR>
No farther eastward can ye stray.<BR>
Beyond no sun, no moon given light,<BR>
But all is sunk in endless night.<BR>
Thus far, O V&aacute;nar lords, may you<BR>
O'er sea and land your search pursue.<BR>
But wild and dark and known to none<BR>
Is the drear space beyond the sun.<BR>
That mountain whence the sun ascends<BR>
Your long and weary journey ends.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_690"></A><A HREF="#fn_690"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><BR>
Now go, and in a month return,<BR>
And let success my praises earn,<BR>
He who beyond tho month shall stay<BR>
Will with his life the forfeit pay.'<BR>
