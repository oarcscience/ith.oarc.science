<P>
'Ah me I o'erwhelmed with shame and weak<BR>
With wounds,' I cried, 'I scarce can speak.<BR>
My hapless brother once and I<BR>
Our strength of flight resolved to try.<BR>

<P>

<P>
And by our foolish pride impelled<BR>
Our way through realms of ether held.<BR>
We vowed before the saints who tread<BR>
The wilds about Kail&aacute;sa's head,<BR>
That we with following wings would chase<BR>
The swift sun to his resting place.<BR>
Up on our soaring pinions through<BR>
The fields of cloudless air we flew.<BR>
Beneath us far, and far away,<BR>
Like chariot wheels bright cities lay,<BR>
Whence in wild snatches rose the song<BR>
Of women mid the gay-clad throng,<BR>
With sounds of sweetest music blent<BR>
And many a tinkling ornament.<BR>
Then as our rapid wings we strained<BR>
The pathway of the sun we gained,<BR>
Beneath us all the earth was seen<BR>
Clad in her garb of tender green,<BR>
And every river in her bed<BR>
Meandered like a silver thread.<BR>
We looked on Meru far below.<BR>
And Vindhya and the Lord of Snow,<BR>
Like elephants that bend to cool<BR>
Their fever in a lilied pool.<BR>
But fervent heat and toil o'ercame<BR>
The vigour of each yielding frame,<BR>
Our weary hearts began to quail,<BR>
And wildered sense to reel and fail.<BR>
We knew not, fainting and distressed,<BR>
The north or south or east or west.<BR>
With a great strain mine eyes I turned<BR>
Where the fierce sun before me burned,<BR>
And seemed to my astonished eyes<BR>
The equal of the earth in size. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_777"></A><A HREF="#fn_777"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
At length, o'erpowered, Jat&aacute;yus fell<BR>
Without a word to say farewell,<BR>
And when to earth I saw him hie<BR>
I followed headlong from the sky. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_778"></A><A HREF="#fn_778"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
With sheltering wings I intervened<BR>
And from the sun his body screened,<BR>
But lost, for heedless folly doomed,<BR>
My pinions which the heat consumed.<BR>
ln Janasth&aacute;n, I hear them say,<BR>
My hapless brother fell and lay.<BR>
I, pinionless and faint and weak,<BR>
Dropped upon Vindhya's woody peak.<BR>
Now with my swift wings burnt away,<BR>
Reft of my brother and my sway.<BR>
From this tall mountain's summit I<BR>
Will cast me headlong down and die.<BR>
