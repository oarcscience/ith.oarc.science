<P>
The Wind-God's son a temple &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_880"></A><A HREF="ry382.htm#fn_880"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> scaled<BR>
Which, by his fury unassailed,<BR>
High as the hill of Meru, stood<BR>
Amid the ruins of the wood;<BR>
And in his fury thundered out<BR>
Again his haughty battle-shout:<BR>
'I am the slave of Kosal's King<BR>
Whose wondrous deeds the minstrels sing.'<BR>
Forth hurried, by that shout alarmed,<BR>
The warders of the temple armed<BR>
With every weapon haste supplied,<BR>
And closed him in on every side,<BR>
With bands that strove to pierce and strike<BR>
With shaft and axe and club and pike.<BR>
Then from its base the V&aacute;nar tore<BR>
A pillar with the weight it bore.<BR>
Against the wall the mass he dashed,<BR>
And forth the flames in answer flashed,<BR>
That wildly ran o'er roofs and wall<BR>
In hungry rage consuming all.<BR>
He whirled the pillar round his head<BR>
And struck a hundred giants dead.<BR>
Then high upheld on air he rose<BR>
And called in thunder to his foes:<BR>
'A thousand V&aacute;nar chiefs like me<BR>
Roam at their will o'er land and sea,<BR>
Terrific might we all possess:<BR>
Our stormy speed is limitless.<BR>
And all, unconquered in the fray,<BR>
Our king Sugr&iacute;va's word obey.<BR>
Backed by his bravest myriads, he<BR>
Our warrior lord will cross the sea,<BR>
Then Lank&aacute;'s lofty towers, and all<BR>
Your hosts and R&aacute;van's self shall fall.<BR>
None shall be left unslaughtered; none<BR>
Who braves the wrath of Raghu's son.'<BR>
