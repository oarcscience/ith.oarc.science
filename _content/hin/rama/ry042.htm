<P>
Then to the prince his grandson, bright<BR>
With his own fame's unborrowed light,<BR>
King Sagar thus began to say,<BR>
Marvelling at his sons' delay:<BR>
'Thou art a warrior skilled and bold,<BR>
Match for the mighty men of old.<BR>
Now follow on thine uncles' course<BR>
And track the robber of the horse.<BR>

<P>
To guard thee take thy sword and bow,<BR>
for huge and strong are beasts below.<BR>
There to the reverend reverence pay,<BR>
And kill the foes who check thy way;<BR>
Then turn successful home and see<BR>
My sacrifice complete through thee.'<BR>

<P>
Obedient to the high-souled lord<BR>
Grasped Ans'um&aacute;n his bow and sword,<BR>
Aud hurried forth the way to trace<BR>
With youth and valour's eager pace.<BR>
On sped he by the path he found<BR>
Dug by his uncles underground,<BR>
The warder elephant he saw<BR>
Whose size and strength pass Nature's law,<BR>
Who bears the world's tremendous weight,<BR>
Whom God, fiend, giant venerate,<BR>
Bird, serpent, and each flitting shade.<BR>
To him the honour meet he paid<BR>
With circling steps and greeting due,<BR>
And further prayed him, if he knew,<BR>
To tell him of his uncles' weal,<BR>
And who had dared the horse to steal.<BR>
To him in war and council tried<BR>
The warder elephant replied:<BR>
'Thou, son of Asamanj, shalt lead<BR>
In triumph back the rescued steed.'<BR>

<P>
As to each warder beast he came<BR>
And questioned all, his words the same,<BR>
The honoured youth with gentle speech<BR>
Drew eloquent reply from each,<BR>
That fortune should his steps attend.<BR>
And with the horse he home should wend.<BR>
Cheered with the grateful answer, he<BR>
Passed on with step more light and free,<BR>
And reached with careless heart the place<BR>
Where lay in ashes Sagar's race.<BR>
Then sank the spirit of the chief<BR>
Beneath that shock of sudden grief,<BR>
And with a bitter cry of woe<BR>
He mourned his kinsmen fallen so.<BR>
He saw, weighed down by woe and care,<BR>
The victim charger roaming there.<BR>
Yet would the pious chieftain fain<BR>
Oblations offer to the slain:<BR>
But, needing water for the rite,<BR>
He looked and there was none in sight.<BR>
His quick eye searching all around<BR>
The uncle of his kinsmen found,<BR>
King Garud, best beyond compare<BR>
Of birds who wing the fields of air.<BR>
Then thus unto the weeping man<BR>
The son of Vinat&aacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> began:<BR>
Grieve not, O hero, for their fall<BR>
Who died a death approved of all.<BR>
Of mighty strength, they met their fate<BR>
By Kapil's hand whom none can mate.<BR>
Pour forth for them no earthly wave,<BR>


<P>


<P>
A holier flood their spirits crave.<BR>
If, daughter of the Lord of Snow,<BR>
Gang&aacute; would turn her stream below,<BR>
Her waves that cleanse all mortal stain<BR>
Would wash their ashes pure again.<BR>
Yea, when her flood whom all revere<BR>
Rolls o'er the dust that moulders here,<BR>
The sixty thousand, freed from sin,<BR>
A home in Indra's heaven shall win.<BR>
Go, and with ceaseless labour try<BR>
To draw the Goddess from the sky.<BR>
Return, and with thee take the steed;<BR>
So shall thy grandsire's rite succeed.'<BR>

<P>
Prince Ans'um&aacute;n the strong and brave<BR>
Followed the rede Suparna &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="ry043.htm#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> gave.<BR>
The glorious hero took the horse,<BR>
And homeward quickly bent his course.<BR>
Straight to the anxious king he hied,<BR>
Whom lustral rites had purified,<BR>
The mournful story to unfold<BR>
And all the king of birds had told.<BR>
The tale of woe the monarch heard,<BR>
Nor longer was the rite deterred:<BR>
With care and just observance he<BR>
Accomplished all, as texts decree.<BR>
The rites performed, with brighter fame,<BR>
Mighty in counsel, home he came.<BR>
He longed to bring the river down,<BR>
But found no plan his wish to crown.<BR>
He pondered long with anxious thought<BR>
But saw no way to what he sought.<BR>
Thus thirty thousand years he spent,<BR>
And then to heaven the monarch went.<BR>

Titans) fought in the east, the south, the
west, and the north, and the Devas were
defeated by the Asuras in all these directions.
They then fought in the north-eastern direction;
there the Devas did not
sustain defeat. This direction is <I>apar&aacute;jit&aacute;,
i. e.</I> unconquerable. Thence one should do
work in this direction, and have it done
there; for such a one '(alone) is able to
clear off his debts.' HAUG'S <I>Aitareyaya Br&aacute;hmanam</I>,
Vol. II, p. 33.
