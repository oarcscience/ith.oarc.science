<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO IV.: VIR&Aacute;DHA'S DEATH.</H3>
<P>
But S&iacute;t&aacute; viewed with wild affright<BR>
The heroes hurried from her sight.<BR>
She tossed her shapely arms on high,<BR>
And shrieked aloud her bitter cry:<BR>
'Ah, the dread giant bears away<BR>
The princely R&aacute;ma as his prey,<BR>
Truthful and pure, and good and great,<BR>
And Lakshman shares his brother's fate.<BR>
The brindled tiger and the bear<BR>
My mangled limbs for food will tear.<BR>
Take me, O best of giants, me,<BR>
And leave the sons of Raghu free.'<BR>

<P>
Then, by avenging fury spurred,<BR>
Her mournful cry the heroes heard,<BR>
And hastened, for the lady's sake,<BR>
The wicked monster's life to take.<BR>
Then Lakshman with resistless stroke<BR>
The foe's left arm that held him broke,<BR>
And Rama too, as swift to smite,<BR>
Smashed with his heavy hand the right.<BR>
With broken arms and tortured frame<BR>
To earth the fainting giant came,<BR>
Like a huge cloud, or mighty rock<BR>
Bent, sundered by the levin's shock.<BR>
Then rushed they  on, and crushed and bent<BR>
Their foe with arms and fists and feet,<BR>
And nerved each mighty limb to pound<BR>
And bray him on the level ground.<BR>
Keen arrows and each biting blade<BR>
Wide rents in breast and side had made;<BR>
But crushed and torn and mangled, still<BR>
The monster lived they could not kill.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma saw no arms might slay<BR>
The fiend who like a mountain lay,<BR>
The glorious hero, swift to save<BR>
In danger, thus his counsel gave:<BR>
' O Prince of men, his charmed life<BR>
No arms may take in battle strife:<BR>
Now dig we in this grove a pit<BR>
His elephantine bulk to fit,<BR>
And let the hollowed earth enfold<BR>
The monster of gigantic mould.'<BR>

<P>
This said, the son of Raghu pressed<BR>
His foot upon the giant's breast.<BR>
With joy the prostrate monster heard<BR>
Victorious R&aacute;ma's welcome word,<BR>
And straight Kakutstha's son, the best<BR>
Of men, in words like these addressed:<BR>
'I yield, O chieftain, overthrown<BR>
By might that vies with Indra's own.<BR>
Till now my folly-blinded eyes<BR>
Thee, hero, failed to recognize.<BR>
Happy Kaus'aly&aacute;! blest to be<BR>
The mother of a son like thee!<BR>
I know thee well, O chieftain, now:<BR>
R&aacute;ma, the prince of men, art thou.<BR>
There stands the high-born Maithil dame,<BR>
There Lakshman, lord of mighty fame.<BR>
My name was Tumburu &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_408"></A><A HREF="#fn_408"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for song<BR>
Renowned among the minstrel throng:<BR>
Cursed by Kuvera's stern decree<BR>
I wear the hideous shape you see.<BR>
But when I sued, his grace to crave,<BR>
The glorious God this answer gave:<BR>
'When R&aacute;ma, Das'aratha's son,<BR>
Destroys thee and the light is won,<BR>
Thy proper shape once more assume,<BR>
And heaven again shall give thee room.'<BR>
When thus the angry God replied,<BR>
No prayers could turn his wrath aside,<BR>
And thus on me his fury fell<BR>
For loving Rambh&aacute;'s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_409"></A><A HREF="#fn_409"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> charms too well.<BR>
Now through thy favour am I freed<BR>
From the stern fate the God decreed,<BR>
And saved, O tamer of the foe,<BR>


<P>

<P>
By thee, to heaven again shall go.<BR>
A league, O Prince, beyond this spot<BR>
Stands holy S'arabhanga's cot:<BR>
The very sun is not more bright<BR>
Than that most glorious anchorite:<BR>
To him, O R&aacute;ma, quickly turn,<BR>
And blessings from the hermit earn.<BR>
First under earth my body throw,<BR>
Then on thy way rejoicing go.<BR>
Such is the law ordained of old<BR>
For giants when their days are told:<BR>
Their bodies laid in earth, they rise<BR>
To homes eternal in the skies.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus, by the rankling dart oppressed,<BR>
Kakutstha's offspring he addressed:<BR>
In earth his mighty body lay,<BR>
His spirit fled to heaven away.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spake Vir&aacute;dha ere he died;<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to his brother cried:<BR>
'Now dig we in this grove a pit<BR>
His elephantine bulk to fit.<BR>
And let the hollowed earth enfold<BR>
This mighty giant fierce and bold.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  This said, the valiant hero put<BR>
Upon the giant's neck his foot.<BR>
His spade obedient Lakshman plied,<BR>
And dug a pit both deep and wide<BR>
By lofty souled Vir&aacute;dha's side.<BR>
Then Raghu's son his foot withdrew,<BR>
And down the mighty form they threw;<BR>
One awful shout of joy he gave<BR>
And sank into the open grave.<BR>
The heroes, to their purpose true,<BR>
In fight the cruel demon slew,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And radiant with delight<BR>
Deep in the hollowed earth they cast<BR>
The monster roaring to the last,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In their resistless might.<BR>
Thus when they saw the warrior's steel<BR>
No life-destroying blow might deal,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The pair, for lore renowned,<BR>
Deep in the pit their hands had made<BR>
The unresisting giant laid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And killed him neath the ground.<BR>
Upon himself the monster brought<BR>
From R&aacute;ma's hand the death he sought<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With strong desire to gain:<BR>
And thus the rover of the night<BR>
Told R&aacute;ma, as they strove in fight,<BR>
That swords might rend and arrows smite<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon his breast in vain.<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma, when his speech he heard,<BR>
The giant's mighty form interred,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Which mortal arms defied.<BR>
With thundering crash the giant fell,<BR>
And rock and cave and forest dell<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With echoing roar replied.<BR>
The princes, when their task was done<BR>
And freedom from the peril won,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rejoiced to see him die.<BR>
Then in the boundless wood they strayed,<BR>

<P>
Like the great sun and moon displayed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Triumphant in the sky.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_410"></A><A HREF="ry203.htm#fn_410"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
