<P>
Thus R&aacute;ma spoke, and Lakshman then<BR>
Made answer to the prince of men:<BR>
'Yea, if the V&aacute;nar, undeterred<BR>
By fear of vengeance, break his word,<BR>
Loss of his royal power ere long<BR>
Shall pay the traitor for the wrong,<BR>
Nor deem I him so void of sense<BR>
To brave the bitter consequence.<BR>
But if enslaved to joy he lie,<BR>
And scorn thy grace with blinded eye,<BR>
Then let him join his brother slain:<BR>
Unmeet were such a wretch to reign.<BR>
Quick rises, kindling in my breast,<BR>
The wrath that will not be repressed,<BR>
And bids me in my fury slay<BR>
The breaker of his faith to-day.<BR>
Let B&aacute;li's son thy consort trace<BR>
With bravest chiefs of V&aacute;nar race.'<BR>

<P>
Thus spoke the hero, and aglow<BR>
With rage of battle seized his bow.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma thus in gentler mood<BR>
With fitting words his speech renewed:<BR>
'No hero with a soul like thine<BR>
To paths of sin will e'er incline.<BR>
He who his angry heart can tame<BR>
Is worthiest of a hero's name.<BR>
Not thine, my brother, be the part<BR>
So alien from the tender heart,<BR>
Nor let thy feet by wrath misled<BR>
Forsake the path they loved to tread.<BR>
From harsh and angry words abstain:<BR>
With gentle speech a hearing gain,<BR>
And tax Sugr&iacute;va with the crime<BR>
Of failing faith and wasted time.'<BR>

<P>
Then Lakshman, bravest of the brave,<BR>
Obeyed the best that R&aacute;ma gave,<BR>
To whom devoting every thought<BR>
The V&aacute;nar's royal town he sought.<BR>
As Mandar's mountain heaves on high<BR>
His curved peak soaring to the sky,<BR>
So Lakshman showed, his dread bow bent<BR>
Like Indra's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_635"></A><A HREF="#fn_635"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the firmament.<BR>
His brother's wrath, his brother's woe<BR>
Inflamed his soul to fiercest glow.<BR>
The tallest trees to earth were cast<BR>
As furious on his way he passed,<BR>
And where he stepped, so fiercely fleet,<BR>
The stones were shivered by his feet.<BR>
He reached Kishkindh&aacute;'s city deep<BR>
Embosomed where the hills were steep,<BR>
Where street and open square were lined<BR>
With legions of the V&aacute;nar kind.<BR>
Then, as his lips with fury swelled,<BR>
The lord of Raghu's line beheld<BR>
A stream of V&aacute;nar chiefs outpoured<BR>
To do obeisance to their lord.<BR>
But when the mighty prince in view<BR>
Of the thick coming V&aacute;nars drew,<BR>
They turned them in amaze to seize<BR>
Crags of the rock and giant trees.<BR>
He saw, and fiercer waxed his ire,<BR>
As oil lends fury to the fire.<BR>
Scarce bad the V&aacute;nar chieftains seen<BR>
That wrathful eye, that troubled mien<BR>
Fierce as the God's who rules the dead,<BR>
When, turned in wild affright, they fled,<BR>
Speeding in breathless terror all<BR>
Sought King Sugr&iacute;va's council hall,<BR>
And there made known their tale of fear,<BR>
That Lakshman wild with rage, was near.<BR>
The king, untroubled by alarms,<BR>
Held T&aacute;ra in his amorous arms,<BR>
And in the distant bower with her<BR>
Heard not each clamorous messenger.<BR>
Then, summoned at the lords' behest<BR>
Forth from the city portals pressed.<BR>
Each like some elephant or cloud,<BR>
The V&aacute;nars in a trembling cloud:<BR>
Fierce warriors all with massive jaws<BR>
And terrors of their tiger claws.<BR>
Some matched ten elephants, and some<BR>
A hundred's strength could overcome.<BR>
Some chieftains, mightier than the rest,<BR>
Ten times a hundred's force possessed.<BR>
With eyes of fury Lakshman viewed<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' tree-armed multitude.<BR>
Thus garrisoned from side to side<BR>
The city walls assault defied.<BR>
Beyond the moat that girt the wall<BR>
Advanced the V&aacute;nar chiefs; and all<BR>
Upon the plain in *numbers *made,(?)<BR>
Impetuous warriors, stood arrayed.<BR>

Red at the sight flashed Lakshman's eyes,<BR>
His bosom heaved tumultuous sighs,<BR>
And forth the fire of fury broke<BR>
Like flame that flashes through the smoke.<BR>
Like some fierce snake the hero stood:<BR>
His bow recalled the expanded hood,<BR>
And in his shaft-head bright and keen<BR>
The flickering of its tongue was seen:<BR>
And in his own all-conquering might<BR>
The venom of its deadly bite.<BR>
Prince Angad marked his angry look,<BR>
And every hope his heart forsook.<BR>
Then, his large eyes with fury red,<BR>
To Angad Lakshman turned and said:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Go tell the king that Lakshman waits<BR>
For audience at the city gates,<BR>
Whose heart, O tamer of thy foes,<BR>
Is heavy with his brother's woes.<BR>
Bid him to R&aacute;ma's word attend,<BR>
And ask if he will aid his friend.<BR>
Go, let the king my message learn:<BR>
Then hither with all speed return.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Prince Angad heard and wild with grief<BR>
Cried as he looked upon the chief:<BR>
''Tis Lakshman's self: impelled by ire<BR>
He seeks the city of my sire.'<BR>
At the fierce words and furious look<BR>
Of Raghu'a son he quailed and shook,<BR>
Back through the city gates he sped,<BR>
And, laden with the tale of dread,<BR>
Sought King Sugr&iacute;va, filled his ears<BR>
And Rum&aacute;'s with his doubts and fears.<BR>
To Rum&aacute; and the king he bent,<BR>
And clasped their feet most reverent,<BR>
Clasped the dear feet of T&aacute;r&aacute;, too,<BR>
And told the startling tale anew.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But King Sugr&iacute;va's ear was dulled,<BR>
By love and wine and languor lulled,<BR>
Nor did the words that Angad spake<BR>
The slumberer from his trance awake.<BR>
But soon as Raghu's son came nigh<BR>
The startled V&aacute;nars raised a cry,<BR>
And strove to win his grace, while dread<BR>
Each anxious heart disquieted.<BR>
They saw, and, as they gathered round,<BR>
Rose from the mighty throng a sound<BR>
Like torrents when they downward dash,<BR>
Or thunder with the lightning's flash.<BR>
The shouting of the V&aacute;nars broke<BR>
Sugriva's slumber, and he woke:<BR>
Still with the wine his eyes were red,<BR>
His neck with flowers was garlanded.<BR>
Roused at the voice of Angad came<BR>
Two V&aacute;nar lords of rank and fame;<BR>
One Yaksha, one Prabhava hight,-<BR>
Wise counsellors of gain and right.<BR>
They came and raised their voices high,<BR>
And told that Raghu's son was nigh:<BR>
'Two brothers steadfast in their truth,<BR>
Each glorious in the bloom of youth,<BR>
Worthy of rule, have left the skies,<BR>

<P>
And clothed their forms in men's disguise.<BR>
One at thy gates, in warlike hands<BR>
Holding his mighty weapon, stands.<BR>
His message is the charioteer<BR>
That brings the eager envoy near,<BR>
Urged onward by his bold intent,<BR>
And by the hest of R&aacute;ma sent.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_636"></A><A HREF="ry306.htm#fn_636"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The gathered V&aacute;nars saw and fled,<BR>
And raised aloud their cry of dread.<BR>
Son of Queen T&aacute;r&aacute;, Angad ran<BR>
To parley with the godlike man.<BR>
Still fiery-eyed with rage and hate<BR>
Stands Lakshman at the city gate,<BR>
And trembling Vanars scarce can fly<BR>
Scathed by the lightning of his eye.<BR>
Go with thy son, thy kith and kin,<BR>
The favour of the prince to win,<BR>
And bow thy reverent head that so<BR>
His fiery wrath may cease to glow.<BR>
What righteous R&aacute;ma bids thee, do,<BR>
And to thy plighted word be true.'<BR>
