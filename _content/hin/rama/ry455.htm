<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LX.: KUMBHAKARNA ROUSED.</H3>
<P>
With humbled heart and broken pride<BR>
Through Lank&aacute;'s gate the giant hied,<BR>
Crushed, like an elephant beneath<BR>
A lion's spring and murderous teeth,<BR>
Or like a serpent 'neath the wing<BR>
And talons of the Feathered King.<BR>
Such was the giant's wild alarm<BR>
At arrows shot by R&aacute;ma's arm;<BR>
Shafts with red lightning round them curled,<BR>
Like Brahm&aacute;'s bolts that end the world.<BR>

<P>
Supported on his golden throne,<BR>
With failing eye and humbled tone,<BR>
'Giants,' he cried,' the toil is vain,<BR>
Fruitless the penance and the pain,<BR>
If I whom Indra owned his peer,<BR>
Secure from Gods, a mortal fear.<BR>
My soul remembers, now too late,<BR>
Lord Brahm&aacute;'s words who spoke my fate:<BR>
'Tremble, proud Giant,' thus they ran,<BR>
'And dread thy death from slighted man.<BR>
Secure from Gods and demons live,<BR>
And serpents, by the boon I give.<BR>
Against their power thy life is charmed,<BR>
But against man is still unarmed.'<BR>
This R&aacute;ma is the man foretold<BR>
By Anarama's* &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_976"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> lips of old:<BR>

<P>
Fear, R&aacute;van, basest of the base:<BR>
For of mine own imperial race<BR>
A prince in after time shall spring<BR>
And thee and thine to ruin bring.<BR>
And Vedavati,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_977"></A><A HREF="#fn_977"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> ere she died<BR>
Slain by my ruthless insult, cried:<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_471"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 471</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
'A scion of my royal line<BR>
Shall slay, vile wretch, both thee and thine.'<BR>
She in a later birth became<BR>
King Janak's child, now R&aacute;ma's dame.<BR>
Nand&iacute;s'vara &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_978"></A><A HREF="#fn_978"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> foretold this fate,<BR>
And Um&aacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_979"></A><A HREF="#fn_979"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> when I moved her hate,<BR>
And Rambh&aacute;, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_980"></A><A HREF="#fn_980"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the lovely child<BR>
Of Varun &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_981"></A><A HREF="#fn_981"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> by my touch defiled.<BR>
I know the fated hour is nigh:<BR>
Hence, captains, to your stations fly.<BR>
Let warders on the rampart stand:<BR>
Place at each gate a watchful band;<BR>
And, terror of immortal eyes,<BR>
Let mightiest Kumbhakarnna rise.<BR>
He, slumbering, free from care and pain,<BR>
By Brahm&aacute;'s curse, for months has lain.<BR>
But when Prahasta's death he hears,<BR>
Mine own defeat and doubts and fears,<BR>
The chief will rise to smite the foe<BR>
And his unrivalled valour show.<BR>
Then Raghu's royal sons and all<BR>
The V&aacute;nars neath his might will fall.'<BR>

<P>
The giant lords his hest obeyed,<BR>
They left him, trembling and afraid,<BR>
And from the royal palace strode<BR>
To Kumbhakarna's vast abode.<BR>
They carried garlands sweet and fresh,<BR>
And reeking loads of blood and flesh.<BR>
They reached the dwelling where he lay,<BR>
A cave that reached a league each way,<BR>
Sweet with fair blooms of lovely scent<BR>
And bright with golden ornament.<BR>
His breathings came to fierce and fast,<BR>
Scarce could the giants brook the blast.<BR>
They found him on a golden bed<BR>
With his huge limbs at length outspread.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
They piled their heaps of venison near,<BR>
Fat buffaloes and boars and deer.<BR>
With wreaths of flowers they fanned his face,<BR>
And incense sweetened all the place.<BR>
Each raised his mighty voice as loud<BR>
As thunders of an angry cloud,<BR>
And conches their stirring summons gave<BR>
That echoed through the giant's cave.<BR>
Then on his breast they rained their blows.<BR>
And high the wild commotion rose<BR>
When cymbal vied with drum and horn.<BR>
And war cries on the gale upborne<BR>
Through all the air loud discord spread,<BR>
And, struck with fear, the birds fell dead.<BR>
But still he slept and took his rest.<BR>
Then dashed they on his shaggy chest<BR>
Clubs, maces, fragments of the rock:<BR>
He moved not once, nor felt the shock.<BR>
The giants made one effort more<BR>
With shell and drum and shout and roar.<BR>
Club, mallet, mace, in fury plied,<BR>
Rained blows upon his breast and side.<BR>
And elephants were urged to aid,<BR>
And camels groaned and horses neighed.<BR>
They drenched him with a hundred pails,<BR>
They tore his ears with teeth and nails.<BR>
They bound together many a mace<BR>
And beat him on the head and face;<BR>
And elephants with ponderous tread<BR>
Stamped on his limbs and chest and head.<BR>
The unusual weight his slumber broke:<BR>
He started, shook his sides, and woke;<BR>
And, heedless of the wounds and blows,<BR>
Yawning with thirst and hunger rose,<BR>
His jaws like hell gaped fierce and wide,<BR>
Dire as the flame neath ocean's tide.<BR>
Red as the sun on Meru's crest<BR>
The giant's face his wrath expressed,<BR>
And every burning breath he drew<BR>
Was like the blast that rushes through<BR>
The mountain cedars. Up he raised<BR>
His awful head with eyes that blazed<BR>
Like comets, dire as Death in form<BR>
Who threats the worlds with fire and stcrm.<BR>
The giants pointed to their stores<BR>
Of buffaloes and deer and boars,<BR>
And straight he gorged him with a flood<BR>
Of wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood.<BR>
He ceased: the giants ventured near<BR>
And bent their lowly heads in fear.<BR>
Then Kumbhakarna glared with eyes<BR>
Still heavy in their first surprise,<BR>
Still drowsy from his troubled rest,<BR>
And thus the giant band addressed.<BR>
'How have ye dared my sleep to break?<BR>
No trifling cause should bid me wake.<BR>
Say, is all well? or tell the need<BR>
That drives you with unruly speed<BR>
To wake me. Mark the words I say,<BR>
The king shall tremble in dismay,<BR>

<P>
Of Vishn'u, he was firm in heart.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Wind-God's son the fight beheld,<BR>
And rushed at R&aacute;van, rage-impelled.<BR>
Down crashed his mighty hand the foe<BR>
Full in the chest received the blow.<BR>
His eyes grew dim, his knees gave way.<BR>
And senseless on the earth he lay.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Wind-God's son to R&aacute;ma bore<BR>
Deep-wounded Lakshman stained with gore.<BR>
He whom no foe might lift or bend<BR>
Was light as air to such a friend.<BR>
The dart that Lakshman's side had cleft,<BR>
Untouched, the hero's body left,<BR>
And flashing through the air afar<BR>
Resumed its place in R&aacute;van's car;<BR>
And, waxing well though wounded sore,<BR>
He felt the deadly pain no more.<BR>
And R&aacute;van, though with deep wounds pained,<BR>
Slowly his sense and strength regained,<BR>
And furious still and undismayed<BR>
On bow and shaft his hand he laid.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Hanum&aacute;n to R&aacute;ma cried:<BR>
'Ascend my back, great chief, and ride<BR>
Like Vishnu borne on Garud's wing,<BR>
To battle with the giant king.'<BR>
So, burning for the dire attack,<BR>
Rode R&aacute;ma on the V&aacute;nar's back,<BR>
And with fierce accents loud and slow<BR>
Thus gave defiance to the foe,<BR>
While his strained bowstring made a sound<BR>
Like thunder when it shakes the ground:<BR>
'Stay, Monarch of the giants, stay,<BR>
The penalty of sin to pay.<BR>
Stay; whither wilt thou fly, and how<BR>
Escape the death that waits thee now?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  No word the giant king returned:<BR>
His eyes with flames of fury burned.<BR>
His arm was stretched, his bow was bent,<BR>
And swift his fiery shafts were sent.<BR>
Red torrents from the V&aacute;nar flowed:<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma near to R&aacute;van' strode,<BR>
And, with keen darts that never failed,<BR>
The chariot of the king assailed.<BR>
With surest aim his arrows flew:<BR>
The driver and the steeds he slew,<BR>
And shattered with the pointed steel<BR>
Car, flag and pole and yoke and wheel.<BR>
As Indra hurls his bolt to smite<BR>
Mount Meru's heaven-ascending height,<BR>
So R&aacute;ma with a flaming dart<BR>
Struck Lank&aacute;'s monarch near the heart,<BR>
Who reeled and fell beneath the blow<BR>
And from loose fingers dropped his bow.<BR>
Bright as the sun, with crescent head,<BR>
From R&aacute;ma's bow an arrow sped,<BR>
And from his forehead, proud no more,<BR>
Cleft the bright coronet he wore.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma stood by R&aacute;van''s side<BR>
And to the conquered giant cried:<BR>
'Well hast thou fought: thine arm has slain<BR>
Strong heroes of the V&aacute;nar train.<BR>
I will not strike or slay thee now,<BR>
For weary, faint with fight art thou.<BR>
To Lank&aacute;'s town thy footsteps bend,<BR>
And there the night securely spend.<BR>
To-morrow come with car and bow,<BR>
And then my prowess shall thou know.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: the king in humbled pride<BR>
Rose from the earth and naught replied.<BR>
With wounded limbs and shattered crown<BR>
He sought again his royal town.<BR>
