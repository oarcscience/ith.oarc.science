<P>
The monarch with the prayer complied<BR>
Of suppliant hands, on every side<BR>
Uplifted like a lotus-bed:<BR>
And then these gracious words he said:<BR>
'Great joy and mighty fame are mine<BR>
Because your loving hearts incline,<BR>
In full assembly clearly shown<BR>
To place my R&aacute;ma on the throne.'<BR>
Then to Vas'ishtha, standing near,<BR>
And V&aacute;madeva loud and clear<BR>
The monarch spoke that all might hear:<BR>
''Tis pure and lovely Chaitra now<BR>
When flowers are sweet on every bough;<BR>
All needful things with haste prepare<BR>
That R&aacute;ma be appointed heir.'<BR>

<P>
Then burst the people's rapture out<BR>
In loud acclaim and joyful shout;<BR>
And when the tumult slowly ceased<BR>
The king addressed the holy priest:<BR>
'Give order, Saint, with watchful heed<BR>
For what the coming rite will need.<BR>
This day let all things ready wait<BR>
Mine eldest son to consecrate.'<BR>
Best of all men of second birth<BR>
Vas'ishtha heard the lord of earth,<BR>
And gave commandment to the bands<BR>
Of servitors with lifted hands<BR>
Who waited on their master's eye:<BR>
'Now by to-morrow's dawn supply<BR>
Rich gold and herbs and gems of price<BR>
And offerings for the sacrifice,<BR>
Wreaths of white flowers and roasted rice.<BR>
And oil and honey, separate;<BR>
New garments and a car of state,<BR>
An elephant with lucky signs,<BR>
A fourfold host in ordered lines,<BR>
The white umbrella, and a pair<BR>
Of chowries, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and a banner fair;<BR>
A hundred vases, row on row,<BR>
To shine like fire in splendid glow,<BR>
A tiger's mighty skin, a bull<BR>
With gilded horns most beautiful.<BR>
All these, at dawn of coming day,<BR>
Around the royal shrine array,<BR>
Where burns the fire's undying ray.<BR>
Each palace door, each city gate<BR>
With wreaths of sandal decorate.<BR>
And with the garlands' fragrant scent<BR>
Let clouds of incense-smoke be blent.<BR>
Let food of noble kind and taste<BR>
Be for a hundred thousand placed;<BR>
Fresh curds with streams of milk bedewed<BR>
To feed the Br&aacute;hman multitude.<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
With care be all their wants supplied.<BR>
And mid the twice-born chiefs divide<BR>
Rich largess, with the early morn,<BR>
And oil and curds and roasted corn.<BR>
Soon as the sun has shown his light<BR>
Pronounce the prayer to bless the rite,<BR>
And then be all the Br&aacute;hmans called<BR>
And in their ordered seats installed.<BR>
Let all musicians skilled to play,<BR>
And dancing-girls in bright array<BR>
Stand ready in the second ring<BR>
Within the palace of the king.<BR>
Each honoured tree, each holy shrine<BR>
With leaves and flowery wreaths entwine,<BR>
And here and there beneath the shade<BR>
Be food prepared and presents laid.<BR>
Then brightly clad, in warlike guise,<BR>
With long swords girt upon their thighs,<BR>
Let soldiers of the nobler sort<BR>
March to the monarch's splendid court.'<BR>

<P>
Thus gave command the twice-born pair<BR>
To active servants stationed there.<BR>
Then hastened to the king and said<BR>
That all their task was duly sped,<BR>
The king to wise Sumantra spake:<BR>
'Now quick, my lord, thy chariot take,<BR>
And hither with thy swiftest speed<BR>
My son, my noble R&aacute;ma lead.'<BR>

<P>
Sumantra, ere the word was given,<BR>
His chariot from the court had driven,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, best of all who ride<BR>
In cars, came sitting by his side.<BR>
The lords of men had hastened forth<BR>
From east and west and south and north,<BR>
&Aacute;ryan and stranger, those who dwell<BR>
In the wild wood and on the fell,<BR>
And as the Gods to Indra, they<BR>
Showed honour to the king that day.<BR>

<P>
Like V&aacute;sav, when his glorious form<BR>
Is circled by the Gods of storm,<BR>
Girt in his hall by kings he saw<BR>
His car-borne R&aacute;ma near him draw,<BR>
Like him who rules the minstrel band<BR>
Of heaven; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> whose valour tilled the land,<BR>
Of mighty arm and stately pride<BR>
Like a wild elephant in stride,<BR>
As fair in face as that fair stone<BR>
Dear to the moon, of moonbeams grown, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
With noble gifts and grace that took<BR>
The hearts of all, and chained each look,<BR>
World-cheering as the Lord of Rain<BR>
When floods relieve the parching plain.<BR>
The father, as the son came nigh,<BR>
Gazed with an ever-thirstier eye.<BR>
Sumantra helped the prince alight<BR>


<P>

<P>


<P>
From the good chariot passing bright,<BR>
And as to meet his sire he went<BR>
Followed behind him reverent.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma clomb, the king to seek<BR>
That terrace like Kail&aacute;sa's peak,<BR>
And reached the presence of the king,<BR>
Sumantra closely following.<BR>
Before his father's face he came,<BR>
Raised suppliant hands and named his name, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
And bowing lowly as is meet<BR>
Paid reverence to the monarch's feet.<BR>
But soon as Das'aratha viewed<BR>
The prince in humble attitude,<BR>
He raised him by the hand in haste<BR>
And his beloved son embraced,<BR>
Then signed him to a glorious throne,<BR>
Gem-decked and golden, near his own.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, best of Raghu's line,<BR>
Made the fair seat with lustre shine<BR>
As when the orient sun upsprings<BR>
And his pure beam on Meru flings.<BR>
The glory flashed on roof and wall,<BR>
And with strange sheen suffused the hall,<BR>
As when the moon's pure rays are sent<BR>
Through autumn's star-lit firmament.<BR>
Then swelled his breast with joy and pride<BR>
As his dear son the father eyed,<BR>
E'en as himeself more fair arrayed<BR>
In some clear mirror's face displayed.<BR>
The aged monarch gazed awhile,<BR>
Then thus addressed him with a smile,<BR>
As Kas'yap, whom the worlds revere,<BR>
Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear:<BR>
'O thou of all my sons most dear,<BR>
In virtue best, thy father's peer,<BR>
Child of my consort first in place,<BR>
Mine equal in her pride of race,<BR>
Because the people's hearts are bound<BR>
To thee by graces in thee found,<BR>
Be thou in Pushya's favouring hour<BR>
Made partner of my royal power.<BR>
I know that thou by nature's bent<BR>
Both modest art and excellent,<BR>
But though thy gifts no counsel need<BR>
My love suggests the friendly rede.<BR>
Mine own dear son, be modest still,<BR>
And rule each sense with earnest will.<BR>
Keep thou the evils far away<BR>
That spring from love and anger's sway.<BR>
Thy noble course alike pursue<BR>
In secret as in open view,<BR>
And every nerve, the love to gain<BR>
Of ministers and subjects, strain.<BR>
The happy prince who sees with pride<BR>
His thriving people satisfied;<BR>
Whose arsenals with arms are stored,<BR>
And treasury with golden hoard,--<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
His friends rejoice as joyed the Blest<BR>
When Amrit crowned their eager quest.<BR>
So well, my child, thy course maintain,<BR>
And from all ill thy soul refrain.'<BR>

<P>
The friends of R&aacute;ma, gathered nigh,<BR>
Longing their lord to gratify,<BR>
Ran to Kaus'aly&aacute;'s bower to tell<BR>
The tidings that would please her well.<BR>
She, host of dames, with many a gem,<BR>
And gold, and kine rewarded them.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma paid the reverence due,<BR>
Mounted the chariot, and withdrew,<BR>
And to his splendid dwelling drove<BR>
While crowds to show him honour strove.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The people, when the monarch's speech<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Their willing ears had heard,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Were wild with joy as though on each<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Great gifts had been conferred.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With meek and low salute each man<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Turned to his home away,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And there with happy heart began<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To all the Gods to pray.<BR>
