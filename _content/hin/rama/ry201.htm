<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO III.: VIR&Aacute;DHA ATTACKED.</H3>
<P>
Vir&aacute;dha with a fearful shout<BR>
That echoed through the wood, cried out:<BR>

<P>
'What men are ye, I bid you say,<BR>
And whither would ye bend your way?'<BR>

<P>
To him whose mouth shot fiery flame<BR>
The hero told his race and name:<BR>
'Two Warriors, nobly bred, are we,<BR>
And through this wood we wander free.<BR>
But who art thou, how born and styled,<BR>
Who roamest here in Dandak's wild?'<BR>

<P>
To R&aacute;ma, bravest of the brave,<BR>
His answer thus Vir&aacute;dha gave:<BR>
'Hear, Raghu's son, and mark me well,<BR>
And I my name and race will tell.<BR>
Of S'atahrad&aacute; born, I spring<BR>
From Java as my sire, O King:<BR>
Me, of this lofty lineage, all<BR>
Giants on earth Vir&aacute;dha call.<BR>
The rites austere I long maintained<BR>
From Brahm&aacute;'s grace the boon have gained<BR>
To bear a charmed frame which ne'er<BR>
Weapon or shaft may pierce or tear.<BR>
Go as ye came, untouched by fear,<BR>
And leave with me this woman here;<BR>
Go, swiftly from my presence fly,<BR>
Or by this hand ye both shall die.'<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma with his fierce eyes red<BR>
With fury to the giant said:<BR>
'Woe to thee, sinner, fond and weak,<BR>
Who madly thus thy death wilt seek!<BR>
Stand, for it waits thee in the fray:<BR>
With life thou ne'er shalt flee away.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke, and raised the cord whereon<BR>
A pointed arrow flashed and shone,<BR>
Then, wild with anger, from his bow,<BR>
He launched the weapon on the foe.<BR>
Seven times the fatal cord he drew,<BR>
And forth seven rapid arrows flew,<BR>
Shafts winged with gold that left the wind<BR>
And e'en Suparna's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_406"></A><A HREF="#fn_406"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> self behind.<BR>
Full on the giant's breast they smote,<BR>
And purpled like the peacock's throat,<BR>
Passed through his mighty bulk and came<BR>
To earth again like flakes of flame.<BR>
The fiend the Maithil dame unclasped;<BR>
In his fierce hand his spear he grasped,<BR>
And wild with rage, pierced through and through,<BR>
At R&aacute;ma and his brother flew.<BR>
So loud the roar which chilled with fear,<BR>
So massy was the monster's spear,<BR>
He seemed, like Indra's flagstaff, dread<BR>
As the dark God who rules the dead.<BR>
On huge Vir&aacute;dha fierce as He &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_407"></A><A HREF="#fn_407"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Who smites, and worlds have ceased to be,<BR>
The princely brothers poured amain<BR>
Their fiery flood of arrowy rain.<BR>
Unmoved he stood, and opening wide<BR>
His dire mouth laughed unterrified,<BR>
And ever as the monster gaped<BR>
Those arrows from his jaws escaped.<BR>
Preserving still his life unharmed,<BR>
By Brahm&aacute;'s saving promise charmed,<BR>
His mighty spear aloft in air<BR>
He raised, and rushed upon the pair.<BR>
From R&aacute;ma's bow two arrows flew<BR>
And cleft that massive spear in two,<BR>

<P>
Dire as the flaming levin sent<BR>
From out the cloudy firmament.<BR>
Cut by the shafts he guided well<BR>
To earth the giant's weapon fell:<BR>
As when from Meru's summit, riven<BR>
By fiery bolts, a rock is driven.<BR>
Then swift his sword each warrior drew,<BR>
Like a dread serpent black of hue,<BR>
And gathering fury for the blow<BR>
Rushed fiercely on the giant foe.<BR>
Around each prince an arm he cast,<BR>
And held the dauntless heroes fast:<BR>
Then, though his gashes gaped and bled,<BR>
Bearing the twain he turned and fled.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma saw the giant's plan,<BR>
And to his brother thus began:<BR>
'O Lakshman, let Vir&aacute;dha still<BR>
Hurry us onward as he will,<BR>
For look, Sumitra's son, he goes<BR>
Along the path we freely chose.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke: the rover of the night<BR>
Upraised them with terrific might,<BR>
Till, to his lofty shoulders swung,<BR>
Like children to his neck they clung.<BR>
Then sending far his fearful roar,<BR>
The princes through the wood he bore,--<BR>
A wood like some vast cloud to view,<BR>
Where birds of every plumage flew,<BR>
And mighty trees o'erarching threw<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dark shadows on the ground;<BR>
Where snakes and silvan creates made<BR>
Their dwelling, and the jackal strayed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Through tangled brakes around.<BR>
