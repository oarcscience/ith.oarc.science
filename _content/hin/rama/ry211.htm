<P>
'O R&aacute;ma, great delight I feel,<BR>
Pleased, Lakshman, with thy faithful zeal,<BR>
That you within these shades I see<BR>
Vith Sit&aacute; come to honour me.<BR>
But wandering through the rough rude wild<BR>

<P>
Has wearied Janak'a gentle child:<BR>
With labours of the way oppressed<BR>
The Maithil lady Iongs for rest.<BR>
Young, delicate, und soft, and fair,<BR>
Such toils as these untrained to bear,<BR>
Her wifely love the dame has led<BR>
The forest's troubled ways to tread.<BR>
Here, R&aacute;ma, see that naught annoy<BR>
Her easy hours of tranquil joy:<BR>
A glorious task has she assayed,<BR>
To follow thee through woodland shade.<BR>
Since first from Nature's hand she came,<BR>
A woman's mood is still the same,<BR>
When Fortune smiles, her love to show,<BR>
And leave her lord in want and woe.<BR>
No pity then her heart can feel,<BR>
She arms her soul with warrior's steel,<BR>
Swift as the storm or Feathered King,<BR>
Uncertain as the lightning's wing.<BR>
Not so thy spouse: her purer mind<BR>
Shrinks from the faults of womankind;<BR>
Like chaste Arundhat&iacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> above,<BR>
A paragon of faithful love.<BR>
Let these blest shades, dear R&aacute;ma, be<BR>
A home for Lakshman, her, and thee.'<BR>
With raised hands reverently meek<BR>
He heard the holy hermit speak,<BR>
And humbly thus addressed the sire<BR>
Whose glory shone like kindled fire:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'How blest am I, what thanks I owe<BR>
That our great Master deigns to show<BR>
His favour, that his heart can be<BR>
Content with Lakshman, Sit&aacute;, me.<BR>
Show me, I pray, some spot of ground<BR>
Where thick trees wave aud springs abound,<BR>
That I may raise my hermit cell<BR>
And there in tranquil pleasure dwell.'<BR>
Then thus replied Agaatya, best<BR>
Of hermits, to the chief's request:<BR>
When for a little he had bent<BR>
His thoughts, upon that prayer intent:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Beloved son, four leagues away<BR>
Is Panchavati bright and gay:<BR>
Thronged with its deer, most fair it looks<BR>
With berries, fruit, and water-brooks.<BR>
There build thee with thy brother's aid<BR>
A cottage in the quiet shade,<BR>
And faithful to thy sire's behest,<BR>
Obedient to the sentence, rest.<BR>
For well, O sinless chieftain, well<BR>
I know thy tale, how all befell:<BR>
Stern penance and the love I bore<BR>
Thy royal sire supply the lore.<BR>
To me long rites and fervid zeal<BR>
The wish that stirs thy heart reveal,<BR>
And hence my guest I bade thee be,<BR>
That this pure grove might shelter thee.<BR>

<P>

<P>
So now, thereafter, thus I speak:<BR>
The shades of Panchavat&iacute; seek;<BR>
That tranquil spot is bright and fair,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; will be happy there.<BR>
Not far remote from here it lies,<BR>
A grove to charm thy loving eyes,<BR>
God&aacute;var&iacute;'s pure stream is nigh:<BR>
There S&iacute;t&aacute;'s days will sweetly fly.<BR>
Pure, lovely, rich in many a charm,<BR>
O hero of the mighty arm,<BR>
'Tis gay with every plant and fruit,<BR>
And throngs of gay buds never mute.<BR>
Thou, true to virtue's path, hast might<BR>
To screen each trusting anchorite,<BR>
And wilt from thy new home defend<BR>
The hermits who on thee depend.<BR>
Now yonder, Prince, direct thine eyes<BR>
Where dense Madh&uacute;ka &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="ry212.htm#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> woods arise:<BR>
Pierce their dark shade, and issuing forth<BR>
Turn to a fig-tree on the north:<BR>
Then onward up a sloping mead<BR>
Flanked by a hill the way will lead:<BR>
There Panchavat&iacute;, ever gay<BR>
With ceaseless bloom, thy steps will stay,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hermit ceased: the princely two<BR>
With seemly honours bade adieu:<BR>
With reverential awe each youth<BR>
Bowed to the saint whose word was truth,<BR>
And then, dismissed with S&iacute;t&aacute;, they<BR>
To Panchavat&iacute; took their way.<BR>
Thus when each royal prince had grasped<BR>
His warrior's mighty bow, and clasped<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His quiver to his side,<BR>
With watchful eyes along the road<BR>
The glorious saint Agastya showed,<BR>
Dauntless in fight the brothers strode,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And S&iacute;t&aacute; with them hied.<BR>
