<P>
He looked upon that archer chief<BR>
Whose full eye mocked the lotus leaf,<BR>
Arid thus the noble V&aacute;nar spake:<BR>
'Now meet the queen for whose dear sake<BR>
Thy mighty task was first begun,<BR>
And now the glorious fruit is won.<BR>
Overwhelmed with woe thy lady lies,<BR>
The hot tears streaming from her eyes.<BR>
And still the queen must long and pine<BR>
Until those eyes be turned to thine.'<BR>

<P>
But R&aacute;ma stood in pensive mood,<BR>
And gathering tears his eyes bedewed.<BR>
His sad looks sought the ground: he sighed<BR>
And thus to King Vibh&iacute;shan cried:<BR>
'Let S&iacute;t&aacute; bathe and tire her head<BR>
And hither to my sight be led<BR>
In raiment sweet with precious scent,<BR>
And gay with golden ornament.'<BR>

<P>
The R&aacute;kshas king his palace sought,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; from her bower was brought.<BR>
Then R&aacute;kshas bearers tall and strong,<BR>
Selected from the menial throng,<BR>
Through Lank&aacute;'s gate the queen, arrayed<BR>
In glorious robes and gems, conveyed.<BR>
Concealed behind the silken screen,<BR>
Swift to the plain they bore the queen,<BR>
While V&aacute;nars, close on every side,<BR>
With eager looks the litter eyed.<BR>
The warders at Vibh&iacute;shan's hest<BR>
The onward rushing throng repressed,<BR>
While like the roar of ocean loud<BR>
Rose the wild murmur of the crowd.<BR>
The son of Raghu saw and moved<BR>
With anger thus the king reproved:<BR>
'Why vex with hasty blow and threat<BR>
The V&aacute;nars, and my rights forget?<BR>
Repress this zeal, untimely shown:<BR>
I count this people as mine own.<BR>
A woman's guard is not her bower,<BR>
The lofty wall, the fenced tower:<BR>
Her conduct is her best defence,<BR>
And not a king's magnificence.<BR>
At holy rites, in war and woe,<BR>
Her face unveiled a dame may show;<BR>
When at the Maiden's Choice &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1038"></A><A HREF="#fn_1038"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they meet,<BR>
When marriage troops parade the street.<BR>
And she, my queen, who long has lain<BR>

<P>

<P>
In prison racked with care and pain,<BR>
May cease a while her face to hide,<BR>
For is not R&aacute;ma by her side?<BR>
Lay down the litter: on her feet<BR>
Let S&iacute;t&aacute; come her lord to meet.<BR>
And let the hosts, of woodland race<BR>
Look near upon the lady's face.'<BR>

<P>
Then Lakshman and each V&aacute;nar chief<BR>
Who heard his words were filled with grief.<BR>
The lady's gentle spirit sank,<BR>
And from each eye in fear she shrank,<BR>
As, her sweet eyelids veiled for shame.<BR>
Slowly before her lord she came.<BR>
While rapture battled with surprise<BR>
She raised to his her wistful eyes.<BR>
Then with her doubt and fear she strove,<BR>
And from her breast all sorrow drove.<BR>
Regardless of the gathering crowd,<BR>
Bright as the moon without a cloud,<BR>
She bent her eyes, no longer dim,<BR>
In joy and trusting love on him.<BR>
