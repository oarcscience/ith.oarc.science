### CANTO LIV.: VAJRADANSHTRA'S DEATH.

The giant leader fiercely rained  
His arrows and thee fight maintained.  
Etime the clanging cord he drew  
His certain shaft a Vánar slew.  
Then, as the creatures he has made  
Fly to the Lord of Life for aid,  
To Angad for protection fled  
The Vánar hosts dispirited.  
Then raged the battle fiercer yet  
Then Angad and the giant met.  
A hundred thousand arrows, hot  
With flames of fire the giant shot;  
And every shaft he deftly sent  
His foeman's body pierced and rent.  
From Angad's limbs ran floods of gore:  
A stately tree from earth he tore,  
Which, maddened as his gashes bled,  
He hurled at his opponent's head.  
His bow the dauntless giant drew;  
To meet the tree swift arrows flew,  
Checked the huge missile's onward way,  
And harmless on the earth it lay.  
A while the Vánar chieftain gazed,  
Then from the earth a rock he raised  
Rent from a thunder-splitten height,  
And cast it with resistless might.  
The giant marked, and, mace in hand,  
Leapt from his chariot to the sand,  
Ere the rough mass descending broke  
The seat, the wheel, the pole and yoke.  

Then Angad seized a shattered hill,  
Whereon the trees were flowering still,  
And with full force the jagged peak  
Fell crashing on the giant's cheek.  
He staggered, reeled, and fell: the blood  
Gushed from the giant in a flood.  
Reft of his might, each sense astray,  
A while upon the sand he lay.  
But strength and wandering sense returned  
Again his eyes with fury burned,  
And with his mace upraised on high  
He wounded Angad on the thigh.  
Then from his hand his mace he threw,  
And closer to his foeman drew.  

Then with their fists they fought, and smote  
On brow and cheek and chest and throat.  
Worn out with toil, their limbs bedewed,  
With blood, the strife they still renewed,  
Like Mercury and fiery Mars  
Met in fierce battle mid the stars.  

A while the deadly fight was stayed:  
Each armed him with his trusty blade  
Whose sheath with tinkling bells supplied,  
And golden net, adorned his side;  
And grasped his ponderous leather shield  
To fight till one should fall or yield.  
Uunumbered wounds they gave and took:  
Their wearied bodies reeled and shook.  
At length upon the sand that drank  
Streams of their blood the warriors sank,  
But as a serpent rears his head  
Sore wounded by a peasant's tread,  
So Angad, fallen on his knees,  
Yet gathered strength his sword to seize;  
And, severed by the glittering blade,  
The giant's head on earth was laid. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_972"></span>[467:1](ry453.htm#fr_972) I omit Cantos LV.,
LVI., LVII., and LVIII. which relate how Akampan and Prahasta sally out
and fall. There is little novelty of incident in these Cantos and the
result are exactly the same as before. In Canto LV. Akampan, at the
command of Rávan, leads forth his troops. Evil omens are seen and heard.
The enemies meet, and many fall on each side, the Vánars transfixed with
arrows, the Rákshases crushed with rooks and trees.

In Canto LVI. Akampan sees that the Rákshases are worsted, and fights
with redoubled rage and vigour. The Vánars fall fast under his "nets of
arrows." Hanumán comes to the rescue. He throws mountain peaks at the
giant which are dexterously stopped with flights of arrows; and at last
beats him down and kills him with a tree.

In Canto LVII. Rávan is seriously alarmed. He declares that he himself,
Kumbhakarna or Prahasta, must go forth. Prahasta sallies out vaunting
that the fowls of the air shall eat their fill of Vánar flesh.

In Canto LVIII. the two armies meet. Dire is the conflict; ceaseless is
the rain of stones and arrows. At last Níla meets Prahasta and breaks
his bow. Prahasta leaps from his car, and the giant and the Vánar fight
on foot. Níla with a huge tree crushes his opponent who falls like a
tree when its roots are cut.
