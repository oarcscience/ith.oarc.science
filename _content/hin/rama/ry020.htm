<P>
The monarch called a Br&aacute;hman near<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And said, 'Now speed away<BR>
To Kas'yap's son, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the mighty seer,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And with all reverence say<BR>
The holy child he holds so dear,<BR>
The hermit of the noble mind.<BR>
Whose equal it were hard to find,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Returned, is dwelling here.<BR>
Go, and instead of me do thou<BR>
Before that best of hermits bow,<BR>
That still he may, for his dear son,<BR>
Show me the favour I have won.'<BR>
Soon as the king these words had said,<BR>
To Kas'yap's son the Br&aacute;hman sped.<BR>
Before the hermit low he bent<BR>
And did obeisance, reverent;<BR>
Then with meek words his grace to crave<BR>
The message of his lord he gave:<BR>
'The high-souled father of his bride<BR>
Had called thy son his rites to guide:<BR>
Those rites are o'er, the steed is slain;<BR>
Thy noble child is come again.'<BR>

<P>
Soon as the saint that speech had heard<BR>
His spirit with desire was stirred<BR>
To seek the city of the king<BR>
And to his cot his son to bring.<BR>

<P>
With young disciples at his side<BR>
Forth on his way the hermit hied,<BR>
While peasants from their hamlets ran<BR>
To reverence the holy man,<BR>
Each with his little gift of food,<BR>
Forth came the village multitude,<BR>
And, as they humbly bowed the head,<BR>
'What may we do for thee?' they said.<BR>
Then he, of Br&aacute;hmans first and best,<BR>
The gathered people thus addressed:<BR>
'Now tell me for I fain would know,<BR>
Why is it I am honoured so?'<BR>
They to the high-souled saint replied:<BR>
'Our ruler is with thee allied.<BR>
Our master's order we fulfil;<BR>
O Br&aacute;hman, let thy mind be still.'<BR>

<P>
With joy the saintly hermit heard<BR>
Each pleasant and delightful word,<BR>
And poured a benediction down<BR>
On king and ministers and town.<BR>
Glad at the words of that high saint<BR>
Some servants hastened to acquaint<BR>
Their king, rejoicing to impart<BR>
The tidings that would cheer his heart.<BR>
Soon as the joyful tale he knew<BR>
To meet the saint the monarch flew,<BR>
The guest-gift in his hand he brought,<BR>
And bowed before him and besought:<BR>
'This day by seeing thee I gain<BR>
Not to have lived my life in vain.<BR>
Now be not wroth with me, I pray,<BR>
Because I wiled thy son away.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The best of Br&aacute;hmans answer made:<BR>
'Be not, great lord of kings, afraid.<BR>
Thy virtues have not failed to win<BR>
My favour, O thou pure of sin.'<BR>
Then in the front the saint was placed,<BR>
The king came next in joyous haste,<BR>
And with him entered his abode,<BR>
Mid glad acclaim as on they rode.<BR>
To greet the sage the reverent crowd<BR>
Raised suppliant hands and humbly bowed.<BR>
Then from the palace many a dame<BR>
Following well-dressed S'&aacute;nt&aacute; came,<BR>
Stood by the mighty saint and cried:<BR>
'See, honour's source, thy son's dear bride.'<BR>
The saint, who every virtue knew,<BR>
His arms around his daughter threw,<BR>
And with a father's rapture pressed<BR>
The lady to his wondering breast.<BR>
Arising from the saint's embrace<BR>
She bowed her low before his face,<BR>
And then, with palm to palm applied,<BR>
Stood by her hermit father's side.<BR>
He for his son, as laws ordain,<BR>
Performed the rite that frees from stain, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And, honoured by the wise and good,<BR>
With him departed to the wood.<BR>
