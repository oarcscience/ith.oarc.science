<P>
He ceased: Vibh&iacute;shan ill at ease<BR>
Addressed the king in words like these:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  O R&aacute;van, O my lord, beware<BR>
Of Sit&aacute; dangerous as fair,<BR>
Nor on thy heedless bosom hang<BR>
This serpent with a deadly fang.<BR>
O King, the Maithil dame restore<BR>
To Raghu's matchlees son before<BR>
Those warriors of the woodlands, vast<BR>
As mountain peaks, approaching fast,<BR>
Armed with fierce teeth and claws, enclose<BR>
Thy city with unsparing foes.<BR>
O, be the Maithil dame restored<BR>
Ere loosened from the clanging cord<BR>

<P>
The vengeful shafts of R&aacute;ma fly,<BR>
And low in death thy princes lie.<BR>
In all thy legions hast thou one<BR>
A match in war for Raghu's son?<BR>
Can Kumbhakarna's self withstand,<BR>
Or Indrajit, that mighty hand?<BR>
In vain with R&aacute;ma wilt thou strive:<BR>
Thou wilt not save thy soul alive<BR>
Though guarded by the Lord of Day<BR>
And Storm-Gods' terrible array,<BR>
In vain to Indra wilt thou fly,<BR>
Or seek protection in the sky,<BR>
In Yama's gloomy mansion dwell,<BR>
Or hide thee in the depths of hell.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased; and when his lips were closed<BR>
Prahasta thus his rede opposed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O timid heart, to counsel thus!<BR>
What terrors have the Gods for us?<BR>
Can snake, Gandharva, fiend appal<BR>
The giants' sons who scorn them all?<BR>
And shall we now our birth disgrace,<BR>
And dread a king of human race?'<BR>
Thus fierce Prahasta counselled ill;<BR>
But sage Vibh&iacute;shan's constant will<BR>
The safety of the realm ensued;<BR>
Who thus in turn his speech renewed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Yes, when a soul defiled with sin<BR>
Shall mount to heaven and enter in,<BR>
Then, chieftain, will experience teach<BR>
The truth of thy disdainful speech.<BR>
Can I, or thou, or these or all<BR>
Our bravest compass R&aacute;ma's fall,<BR>
The chief in whom all virtues shine,<BR>
The pride of old Ikshv&aacute;ku'a line,<BR>
With whom the Gods may scarce compare<BR>
In skill to act, in heart to dare?<BR>
Yea, idly mayst thou vaunt thee, till<BR>
Sharp arrows winged with matchless skill<BR>
From R&aacute;ma's bowstring, fleet and fierce<BR>
As lightning's flame, thy body pierce.<BR>
Nikumbha shall not save thee then,<BR>
Nor R&aacute;van, from the lord of men.<BR>
O Monarch, hear my last appeal,<BR>
My counsel for thy kingdom's weal,<BR>
This sentence I again declare:<BR>
O giant King, beware, beware!<BR>
Save from the ruin that impends<BR>
Thy town, thy people, and thy friends;<BR>
O hear the warning urged once more:<BR>
To Raghu's son the dame restore.'<BR>
