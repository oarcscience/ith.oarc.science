<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXVIII.: JAT&Aacute;YUS.</H3>
<P>
Thus faithful Lakshman strove to cheer<BR>
The prince with counsel wise and clear.<BR>
Who, prompt to seize the pith of all,<BR>
Let not that wisdom idly fall.<BR>
With vigorous effort he restrained<BR>
The passion in his breast that reigned,<BR>
And leaning on his bow for rest<BR>
His brother Lakshman thus addressed:<BR>
'How shall we labour now, reflect;<BR>
Whither again our search direct?<BR>
Brother, what plan canst thou devise<BR>
To bring her to these longing eyes?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To him by toil and sorrow tried<BR>
The prudent Lakshman thus replied:<BR>
'Come, though our labour yet be vain,<BR>
And search through Janasth&aacute;n again,-<BR>
A realm where giant foes abound.<BR>
And trees and creepers hide the ground.<BR>
For there are caverns deep and dread,<BR>
By deer and wild birds tenanted,<BR>
And hills with many a dark abyss,<BR>
Grotto and rock and precipice.<BR>
There bright Gandharvas love to dwell,<BR>
And Kinnars in each bosky dell.<BR>
With me thy eager search to aid<BR>
Be every hill and cave surveyed.<BR>
Great chiefs like thee, the best of men,<BR>
Endowed with sense and piercing ken,<BR>
Though tried by trouble never fail.<BR>
Like rooted hills that mock the gale,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma, pierced by anger's sting,<BR>
Laid a keen arrow on his string,<BR>
And by the faithful Lakshman's side<BR>
Roamed through the forest far and wide.<BR>
Jat&aacute;yus there with blood-drops dyed,<BR>
Lying upon the ground he spied,<BR>
Huge as a mountain's shattered crest,<BR>
Mid all the birds of air the best.<BR>
In wrath the mighty bird he eyed,<BR>
And thus the chief to Lakshman cried:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Ah me, these signs the truth betray;<BR>
My darling was the vulture's prey.<BR>
Some demon in the bird's disguise<BR>
Roams through the wood that round us lies,<BR>
On large eyed S&iacute;t&aacute; he has fed.<BR>
And rest him now with wings outspread<BR>
But my keen * whose flight is true,<BR>
Shall *<BR>

<P>
An arrow on the string he laid,<BR>
And rushing near the bird surveyed,<BR>
While earth to ocean's distant side<BR>
Trembled beneath his furious stride.<BR>
With blood and froth on neck and beak<BR>
The dying bird essayed to speak,<BR>
And with a piteous voice, distressed,<BR>
Thus Das'aratha's son addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'She whom like some sweet herb of grace<BR>
Thou seekest in this lonely place,<BR>
Fair lady, is fierce R&aacute;van's prey,<BR>
Who took, beside, my life away.<BR>
Lakshman and thou had parted hence<BR>
And left the dame without defence,<BR>
I saw her swiftly borne away<BR>
By R&aacute;van's might which none could stay.<BR>
I hurried to the lady's aid,<BR>
I crushed his car and royal shade,<BR>
And putting forth my warlike might<BR>
Hurled R&aacute;van to the earth in fight.<BR>
Here, R&aacute;ma, lies his broken bow,<BR>
Here lie the arrows of the foe.<BR>
There on the ground before thee are<BR>
The fragments of his battle car.<BR>
There bleeds the driver whom my wings<BR>
Beat down with ceaseless buffetings<BR>
When toil my aged strength subdued,<BR>
His sword my weary pinions hewed.<BR>
Then lifting up the dame he bare<BR>
His captive through the fields of air.<BR>
Thy vengeful blows from me restrain,<BR>
Already by the giant slain.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When R&aacute;ma heard the vulture tell<BR>
The tale that proved his love so well,<BR>
His bow upon the ground he placed,<BR>
And tenderly the bird embraced:<BR>
Then to the earth he fell o'erpowered,<BR>
And burning tears both brothers showered,<BR>
For double pain and anguish pressed<BR>
Upon the patient hero's breast.<BR>
The solitary bird be eyed<BR>
Who in the lone wood gasped and sighed,<BR>
And as again his anguish woke<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma to his brother spoke:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Expelled from power the woods I tread,<BR>
My spouse is lost, the bird is dead.<BR>
A fate so sad. I ween, would tame<BR>
The vigour of the glorious flame.<BR>
If I to cool my fever tried<BR>
To cross the deep from side to side.<BR>
The sea,--so hard my fate,--would dry<BR>
His waters as my feet came nigh.<BR>
In all this world there lives not one<BR>
So cursed as I beneath the sun;<BR>
So strong a net of misery cast<BR>
Around me holds the captive fast,<BR>
Best of all birds that play the wing,<BR>
Loved, honoured by our sire the king,<BR>
The vulture, in my fate enwound,<BR>
Lies bleeding, dying on the ground.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma and his brother stirred<BR>

<P>
By pity mourned the royal bird,<BR>
And, as their hands his limbs caressed,<BR>
Affection for a sire expressed.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to his bosom strained<BR>
The bird with mangled wings distained,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With crimson blood-drops dyed.<BR>
He fell, and shedding many a tear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Where is my spouse than life more dear?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Where is my love?' he cried.<BR>
