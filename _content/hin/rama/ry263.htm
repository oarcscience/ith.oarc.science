<P>
With piteous voice, by woe subdued,<BR>
Thus Raghu's son his speech renewed:<BR>
'Thy steps, my brother, quickly turn<BR>
To bright God&aacute;var&iacute; and learn<BR>
If S&iacute;t&aacute; to the stream have hied<BR>
To cull the lilies on its side.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Obedient to the words he said,<BR>
His brother to the river sped.<BR>
The shelving banks he searched in vain,<BR>
And then to R&aacute;ma turned again.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'I searched, but found her not,' he cried;<BR>
'I called aloud, but none replied.<BR>
Where can the Maithil lady stray,<BR>
Whose sight would chase our cares away?<BR>
I know not where, her steps untraced,<BR>
Roams S&iacute;t&aacute; of the dainty waist.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When R&aacute;ma heard the words he spoke<BR>
Again he sank beneath the stroke,<BR>
And wiih a bosom anguish-fraught<BR>
Himself the lovely river sought.<BR>
There standing on the shelving side,<BR>
'O S&iacute;t&aacute;, where art thou?' he cried.<BR>

<P>
No spirit voice an answer gave,<BR>
No murmur from the trembling wave<BR>
Of sweet God&aacute;var&iacute; declared<BR>
The outrage which the fiend had dared<BR>
'O speak!' the pitying spirits cried,<BR>
But yet the stream their prayer denied,<BR>
Nor dared she, coldly mute, relate<BR>
To the sad chief his darling's fate<BR>
Of R&aacute;van's awful form she thought,<BR>
And the dire deed his arm had wrought,<BR>
And still withheld by fear dismayed,<BR>
The tale for which the mourner prayed.<BR>
When hope was none, his heart to cheer,<BR>
That the bright stream his cry would hear<BR>
While sorrow for his darling tore<BR>
His longing soul he spake once more:<BR>
'Though I have sought with tears and sighs<BR>
God&aacute;rvar&iacute; no word replies,<BR>
O say, what answer can I frame<BR>
To Janak father of my dame?<BR>
Or how before her mother stand<BR>
Leading no S&iacute;t&aacute; by the hand?<BR>
Where is my loyal love who went<BR>
Forth with her lord to banishment?<BR>
Her faith to me she nobly held<BR>
Though from my realm and home expelled,--<BR>
A hermit, nursed on woodland fare,--<BR>
She followed still and soothed my care.<BR>
Of all my friends am I bereft,<BR>
Nor is my faithful consort left.<BR>
How slowly will the long nights creep<BR>
While comfortless I wake and weep!<BR>
O, if my wife may yet be found,<BR>
With humble love I'll wander round<BR>
This Janasth&aacute;n, Pras'ravan's hill,<BR>
Mand&aacute;kini's delightful rill.<BR>
See how the deer with gentle eyes<BR>
Look on my face and sympathize.<BR>
I mark their soft expression: each<BR>
Would soothe me, if it could, with speech.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A while the anxious throng he eyed.<BR>
And 'Where is S&iacute;t&aacute;, where?' he cried.<BR>
Thus while hot tears his utterance broke<BR>
The mourning son of Raghu spoke.<BR>
The deer in pity for his woes<BR>
Obeyed the summons and arose.<BR>
Upon his right thy stood, and raised<BR>
Their sad eyes up to heaven and gazed<BR>
Each to that quarter bent her look<BR>
Which R&aacute;van with his captive took.<BR>
Then Raghu's son again they viewed,<BR>
And toward that point their way pursued.<BR>
Then Lakshman watched their looks intent<BR>
As moaning on their way they went,<BR>
And marked each sign which struck his sense<BR>
With mute expressive influence,<BR>
Then as again his sorrow woke<BR>
Thus to his brother chief he spoke:<BR>
'Those deer thy eager question heard<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_305"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 305</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And rose at once by pity stirred:<BR>
See, in thy search their aid they lend,<BR>
See, to the south their looks they bend.<BR>
Arise, dear brother, let us go<BR>
The way their eager glances show,<BR>
If haply sign or trace descried<BR>
Our footsteps in the search may guide.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The son of Raghu gave assent,<BR>
And quickly to the south they went;<BR>
With eager eyes the earth he scanned,<BR>
And Lakshman followed close at hand.<BR>
An each to other spake his thought,<BR>
And round with anxious glances sought,<BR>
Scattered before them in the way,<BR>
Blooms of a fallen garland lay.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma saw that flowery rain<BR>
He spoke once more with bitterest pain:<BR>
'O Lakshman every flower that lies<BR>
Here on the ground I recognize.<BR>
I culled them in the grove, and there<BR>
My darling twined them in her hair.<BR>
The sun, the earth, the genial breeze<BR>
Have spared these flowers my soul to please.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then to that woody hill he prayed,<BR>
Whence flashed afar each wild cascade:<BR>
'O best of mountains, hast thou seen<BR>
A dome of perfect form and mien<BR>
In some sweet spot with trees o'ergrown,-<BR>
My darling whom I left alone?'<BR>
Then as a lion threats a deer<BR>
He thundered with a voice of fear:<BR>
'Reveal her, mountain, to my view<BR>
With golden limbs and golden hue.<BR>
Where is my darling S&iacute;t&aacute;? speak<BR>
Before I rend thee peak from peak.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The mountain seemed her track to show,<BR>
But told not all he sought to know.<BR>
Then Das'aratha's son renewed<BR>
His summons as the mount he viewed:<BR>
'Soon as my flaming arrows fly,<BR>
Consumed to ashes shall thou lie<BR>
Without a herb or bud or tree,<BR>
And birds no more shall dwell in thee.<BR>
And if this stream my prayer deny,<BR>
My wrath this day her flood shall dry,<BR>
Because she lends no aid to trace<BR>
My darling of the lotus face.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma spake as though his ire<BR>
Would scorch them with his glance of fire;<BR>
Then searching farther on the ground<BR>
The footprint of a fiend he found,<BR>
And small light traces here and there,<BR>
Where S&iacute;t&aacute; in her great despair,<BR>
Shrieking for R&aacute;ma's help, had fled<BR>
Before the giant's mighty tread.<BR>
His careful eye each trace surveyed<BR>
Which S&iacute;t&aacute; and the fiend had made,--<BR>
The quivers and the broken bow<BR>
And ruined chariot of the foe,--<BR>
And told, distraught by fear and grief,<BR>
His tidings to his brother chief:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O Lakshman, here,' he cried 'behold<BR>
My S&iacute;t&aacute;'s earrings dropped with gold.<BR>
Here lie her garlands torn and rent,<BR>
Here lies each glittering ornament.<BR>
O look, the ground on every side<BR>
With blood-like drops of gold is dyed.<BR>
The fiends who wear each strange disguise<BR>
Have seized, I ween, the helpless prize.<BR>
My lady, by their hands o'erpowered,<BR>
Is slaughtered, mangled, and devoured.<BR>
Methinks two fearful giants came<BR>
And waged fierce battle for the dame.<BR>
Whose, Lakshman, was this mighty bow<BR>
With pearls and gems in glittering row<BR>
Cast to the ground the fragments lie,<BR>
And still their glory charms the eye.<BR>
A bow so mighty sure was planned<BR>
For heavenly God or giant's hand.<BR>
Whose was this coat of golden mail<BR>
Which, though its lustre now is pale,<BR>
Shone like the sun of morning, bright<BR>
With studs of glittering lazulite?<BR>
Whose, Lakshman, was this bloom-wreathed shade<BR>
With all its hundred ribs displayed?<BR>
This screen, most meet for royal brow,<BR>
With broken staff lies useless now.<BR>
And these tall asses, goblin-faced,<BR>
With plates of golden harness graced,<BR>
Whose hideous forms are stained with gore<BR>
Who is the lord whose yoke they bore?<BR>
Whose was this pierced and broken car<BR>
That shoots a flame-like blaze afar?<BR>
Whose these spent shafts at random spread,<BR>
Each fearful with its iron head,--<BR>
With golden mountings fair to see,<BR>
Long as a chariot's axle-tree?<BR>
These quivers see, which, rent in twain,<BR>
Their sheaves of arrows still contain.<BR>
Whose was this driver? Dead and cold,<BR>
His hands the whip and reins still hold.<BR>
See, Lakshman, here the foot I trace<BR>
Of man, nay, one of giant race.<BR>
The hatred that I nursed of old<BR>
Grows mightier now a hundred fold<BR>
Against these giants, fierce of heart,<BR>
Who change their forms by magic art.<BR>
Slain, eaten by the giant press,<BR>
Or stolen is the votaress,<BR>
Nor could her virtue bring defence<BR>
To S&iacute;t&aacute; seized and hurried hence.<BR>
O, if my love be slain or lost<BR>
All hope of bliss for me is crossed.<BR>
The power of all the worlds were vain<BR>
To bring one joy to soothe my pain.<BR>
The spirits with their blinded eyes<BR>
Would look in wonder, and despise<BR>
The Lord who made the worlds, the great<BR>
Creator when compassionate.<BR>
And so, I ween, the Immortals turn<BR>
Cold eyes upon me now, and spurn<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_306"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 306</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The weakling prompt at pity's call,<BR>
Devoted to the good of all.<BR>
But from this day behold me changed,<BR>
From every gentle grace estranged.<BR>
Now be it mine all life to slay,<BR>
And sweep these cursed fiends away.<BR>
As the great sun leaps up the sky,<BR>
And the cold moonbeams fade and die,<BR>
So vengeance rises in my breast.<BR>
One passion conquering all the rest.<BR>
Gandharvas in their radiant place,<BR>
The Yakshas, and the giant race,<BR>
Kinnars and men shall look in vain<BR>
For joy they ne'er shall see again.<BR>
The anguish of my great despair,<BR>
O Lakshman, fills the heaven and air;<BR>
And I in wrath all life will slay<BR>
Within the triple world to-day.<BR>
Unless the Gods in heaven who dwell<BR>
Restore my S&iacute;t&aacute; safe and well,<BR>
I armed with all the fires of Fate.<BR>
The triple world will devastate.<BR>
The troubled stars from heaven shall fall,<BR>
The moon be wrapped in gloomy pall,<BR>
The fire be quenched, the wind be stilled,<BR>
The radiant sun grow dark and chilled;<BR>
Crushed every mountain's towering pride,<BR>
And every lake and river dried,<BR>
Dead every creeper, plant, and tree,<BR>
And lost for aye the mighty sea.<BR>
Thou shalt the word this day behold<BR>
In wild disorder uncontrolled,<BR>
With dying life which naught defends<BR>
From the fierce storm my bowstring sends.<BR>
My shafts this day, for S&iacute;t&aacute;'s sake,<BR>
The life of every fiend shall take.<BR>
The Gods this day shall see the force<BR>
That wings my arrows on their course,<BR>
And mark how far that course is held,<BR>
By my unsparing wrath impelled.<BR>
No God, not one of Daitya strain,<BR>
Goblin or R&aacute;kshas shall remain.<BR>
My wrath shall end the worlds, and all<BR>
Demons and Gods therewith shall fall.<BR>
Each world which Gods, the D&aacute;nav race,<BR>
And giants make their dwelling place,<BR>
Shall fall beneath my arrows sent<BR>
In fury when my bow is bent.<BR>
The arrows loosened from my string<BR>
Confusion on the worlds shall bring.<BR>
For she is lost or breathes no more,<BR>
Nor will the Gods my love restore.<BR>
Hence all on earth with life and breath<BR>
This day I dedicate to death.<BR>
All, till my darling they reveal,<BR>
The fury of my shafts shall feel.'<BR>
&nbsp; Thus as he spake by rage impelled,<BR>
Red grew his eyes, his fierce lips swelled.<BR>
His bark coat round his form he drew<BR>
And coiled his hermit braids anew.<BR>
Like Rudra when he yearned to slay<BR>
The demon Tripur &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="ry264.htm#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the fray.<BR>
So looked the hero brave and wise,<BR>
The fury flashing from his eyes.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, conqueror of the foe,<BR>
From Lakshman's hand received his bow,<BR>
Strained the great string, and laid thereon<BR>
A deadly dart that flashed and shone,<BR>
And spake these words as fierce in ire<BR>
As He who ends the worlds with fire:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'As age and time and death and fate<BR>
All life with checkless power await,<BR>
So Lakshman in my wrath to-day<BR>
My vengeful might shall brook no stay,<BR>
Unless this day I see my dame<BR>
In whose sweet form is naught to blame,--<BR>
Yea, as before, my love behold<BR>
Fair with bright teeth and perfect mould,<BR>
This world shall feel a deadly blow<BR>
Destroyed with ruthless overthrow,<BR>
And serpent lords and Gods of air,<BR>
Gandharvas, men, the doom shall share.'<BR>
