<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVI.: THE FOREST OF T&Aacute;DAK&Aacute;.</H3>
<P>
When the fair light of morning rose<BR>
The princely turners of their foes<BR>
Followed, his morning worship o'er,<BR>
The hermit to the river's shore.<BR>
The high-souled men with thoughtful care<BR>
A pretty barge had stationed there.<BR>
All cried. 'O lord, this barge ascend,<BR>
And with thy princely followers bend<BR>
To yonder side thy prosperous way<BR>
With naught to check thee or delay.'<BR>

<P>
Nor did the saint their rede reject:<BR>
He bade farewell with due respect,<BR>
And crossed, attended by the twain,<BR>
That river rushing to the main.<BR>
When now the bark was half way o'er,<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman heard the roar,<BR>


<P>


<P>
That louder grew and louder yet,<BR>
Of waves by dashing waters met.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma asked the mighty seer:<BR>
'What is the tumult that I hear<BR>
Of waters cleft in mid career?'<BR>
Soon as the speech of R&aacute;ma, stirred<BR>
By deep desire to know, he heard,<BR>
The pious saint began to tell<BR>
What paused the waters' roar and swell:<BR>
'On high Kail&aacute;sa's distant hill<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  There lies a noble lake<BR>
Whose waters, born from Brahm&aacute;'s will,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The name of M&aacute;nas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> take.<BR>
Thence, hallowing where'er they flow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The streams of Sarj&uacute; fall,<BR>
And wandering through the plains below<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Embrace Ayodhy&aacute;'s wall.<BR>
Still, still preserved in Sarj&uacute;'s name<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sarovar's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> fame we trace.<BR>
The flood of Brahma whence she came<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To run her holy race.<BR>
To meet great Gang&aacute; here she hies<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With tributary wave:<BR>
Hence the loud roar ye hear arise,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of floods that swell and rave.<BR>
Here, pride of Raghu's line, do thou<BR>
In humble adoration bow.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke. The princes both obeyed,<BR>
And reverence to each river paid.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>
They reached the southern shore at last,<BR>
And gaily on their journey passed.<BR>
A little space beyond there stood<BR>
A gloomy awe-inspiring wood.<BR>
The monarch's noble son began<BR>
To question thus the holy man:<BR>
'Whose gloomy forest meets mine eye<BR>
Like some vast cloud that fills the sky?<BR>
Pathless and dark it seems to be,<BR>
Where birds in thousands wander free;<BR>
Where shrill cicadas' cries resound,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And fowl of dismal note abound,<BR>
Lion, rhinoceros, and bear,<BR>
Boar, tiger, elephant, are there,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  There shrubs and thorns run wild:<BR>
Dh&aacute;o, S&aacute;l, Bignonia, Bel,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are found,<BR>
And every tree that grows on ground.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  How is the forest styled?'<BR>
The glorious saint this answer made:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Dear child of Raghu, hear<BR>
Who dwells within the horrid shade<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That looks so dark and drear.<BR>
Where now is wood, long ere this day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Two broad and fertile lands,<BR>
Malaja and Kar&uacute;sha lay.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Adorned by heavenly hands.<BR>
Here, mourning friendship's broken ties,<BR>
Lord Indra of the thousand eyes<BR>
Hungered and sorrowed many a day,<BR>
His brightness soiled with mud and clay,<BR>
When in a storm of passion he<BR>
Had slain his dear friend Namuchi.<BR>
Then came the Gods and saints who bore<BR>
Their golden pitchers brimming o'er<BR>
With holy streams that banish stain,<BR>
And bathed Lord Indra pure again.<BR>
When in this land the God was freed<BR>
From spot and stain of impious deed<BR>
For that his own dear friend he slew,<BR>
High transport thrilled his bosom through.<BR>
Then in his joy the lands he blessed,<BR>
And gave a boon they long possessed:<BR>
'Because these fertile lands retain<BR>
The washings of the blot and stain,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Twas thus Lord Indra sware,<BR>
'Malaja and Kar&uacute;sha's name<BR>
Shall celebrate with deathless fame<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My malady and care.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
'So be it', all the Immortals cried,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Indra's speech they heard,<BR>
And with acclaim they ratified<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The names his lips conferred.<BR>
Long time, O victor of thy foes,<BR>
These happy lands had sweet repose,<BR>
And higher still in fortune rose.<BR>
At length a spirit, loving ill,<BR>
T&aacute;dak&aacute; , wearing shapes at will,<BR>


<P>

<P>


<P>
Whose mighty strength, exceeding vast<BR>
A thousand elephants, surpassed,<BR>
Was to fierce Sunda, lord and head<BR>
Of all the demon armies, wed.<BR>
From her, Lord Indra's peer in might<BR>
Giant M&aacute;richa sprang to light:<BR>
And she, a constant plague and pest,<BR>
These two fair realms has long distressed.<BR>
Now dwelling in her dark abode<BR>
A league away she bars the road:<BR>
And we, O R&aacute;ma, hence must go<BR>
Where lies the forest of the foe.<BR>
Now on thine own right arm rely,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And my command obey:<BR>
Smite the foul monster that she die.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And take the plague away.<BR>
To reach this country none may dare<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fallen from its old estate,<BR>
Which she, whose fury naught can bear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Has left so desolate.<BR>
And now my truthful tale is told<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  How with accursed sway<BR>
The spirit plagued this wood of old,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And ceases not to-day.'<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_157"></A><A HREF="ry028.htm#fr_157">38:1b</A>  'A celebrated lake regarded in India
as sacred. It lies in the lofty region between
the northern highlands of the Himalayas
and mount Kail&aacute;sa, the region of
the sacred lakes. The poem, following
the popular Indian belief, makes the river
Saray&uacute; (now Sarj&uacute;) flow from the M&aacute;nasa
lake; the sources of the river are a little to
the south about a day's journey from the
lake. See Lassen, <I>Indische Alterthumsbunde</I>,
page 34.' GORBESIO. <I>Manas</I> means
mind; <I>m&aacute;nasa</I>, mental, mind-born.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_158"></A><A HREF="ry028.htm#fr_158">38:2b</A>  <I>Sarovar</I> means best of lakes. This is
another of the poet's fanciful etymologies.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_159"></A><A HREF="ry028.htm#fr_159">38:3b</A>  The confluence of two or more rivers
is often a venerated and holy place. The
most famous is Pray&aacute;g or Allahabad,
where the Sarasvat&iacute; by an underground
course is believed to join the Jumna and
the Ganges.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_160"></A><A HREF="ry028.htm#fr_160">39:1</A>  The botanical names of the trees
mentioned in the text are Grislea Tormentosa,
Shorea Robusta, Echites Antidysenterica,
Bignonia Suaveolens, Aegle Marmelos,
and Diospyrus Glutinosa. I have
omitted the <I>Kutaja</I> (Echites) and the
<I>Tinduka</I> (Diospyrus).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_161"></A><A HREF="ry028.htm#fr_161">39:2</A>  Here we meet with a fresh myth to
account for the name of these regions.
<I>Malaja</I> is probably a non-Aryan word
signifying a hilly country: taken as a
Sanskrit compound it means <I>sprung from
defilement</I>. The word <I>Kar&uacute;sha</I> appears to
have a somewhat similar meaning.</P>
