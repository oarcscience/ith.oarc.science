### CANTO LXVI.: KOMBHAKARNA'S SALLY.

In pomp and pride of warlike state  
The giant passed the city gate.  
He raised his voice: the hills, the shore  
Of Lanka's sea returned the roar.  
The Vánars saw the chief draw nigh  
Whom not the ruler of the sky,  
Nor Yama, monarch of the dead,  
Might vanquish, and affrighted fled.  
When royal Angad, Báli's son,  
Saw the scared Vánars turn and run,  
Undaunted still he kept his ground,  
And shouted as he gazed around:  
'O Nala, Níla, stay nor let  
Your souls your generous worth forget,  
O Kumud and Gaváksha, why  
Like base-born Vánars will ye fly?  
Turn, turn, nor shame your order thus:  
This giant is no match for us'  
   They heard his voice: the flight was stayed;  
Again for war they stood arrayed,  
And hurled upon the foe a shower  
Of mountain peaks and trees in flower.  
Still on his limbs their missiles rained:  
Unmoved, their blows he still sustained,  
And seemed unconscious of the stroke  
When rocks against his body broke.  
Fierce as the flame when woods are dry  
He charged with fury in his eye.  
Like trees consumed with fervent heat  
They fell beneath the giant's feet.  
Some o'er the ground, dyed red with gore,  
Fled wild with terror to the shore,  
And, deeming that all hope was lost,  
Ran to the bridge they erst had crossed.  
Some clomb the trees their lives to save,  
Some sought the mountain and the cave;  
Some hid them in the bosky dell,  
And there in deathlike slumber fell.  

   When Angad saw the chieftains fly  
He called them with a mighty cry:  
'Once more, O Vánars, charge once more,  
On to the battle as before.  
In all her compass earth has not,  
To hide you safe, one secret spot.  
What! leave your arms? each nobler dame  
Will scorn her consort for the shame.  
This blot upon your names efface,  
And keep your valour from disgrace.  
Stay, chieftains; wherefore will ye run,  
A band of warriors scared by one?'  
   Scarce would they hear: they would not stay,  
And barely spoke in wild dismay:  
'Have we not fought, and fought in vain  
Have we not seen our mightiest slain?  
The giant's matchless force we fear,  
And fly because our lives are dear.'  
But Báli's son with gentle art  
Dispelled their dread and cheered each heart.  
They turned and formed and waited still  
Obedient to the prince's will.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_993"></span>[477:1](ry461.htm#fr_993) There is so much
commonplace repetition in these Sallies of the Rákshas chieftains that
omissions are frequently necessary. The usual ill omens attend the sally
of Kumbhakarna, and the Canto ends with a description of the terrified
Vánars' flight which is briefly repeated in different words at the
begining of the next Canto.
