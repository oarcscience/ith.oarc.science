### CANTO LXII.: SAMPÁTI'S STORY.

'As to the saint I thus complained  
My bitter tears fell unrestrained.  
He pondered for a while, then broke  
The silence, and thus calmly spoke:  
'Forth from thy sides again shall spring,  
O royal bird, each withered wing,  
And all thine ancient power and might  
Return to thee with strength of sight.  
A noble deed has been foretold  
In prophecy pronounced of old:  
Nor dark to me are future things,  
Seen by the light which penance brings.  
A glorious king shall rise and reign,  
The pride of old Ikshváku's strain.  
A good and valiant prince, his heir,  
Shall the dear name of Ráma bear.  
With his brave brother Lakshman he  
An exile in the woods shall be,  
Where Rávan, whom no God may slay,  <span
id="fr_779"></span>[1](ry338.htm#fn_779)  
Shall steal his darling wife away,  
In vain the captive will be wooed  
With proffered love and dainty food,  
She will not hear, she will not taste:  
But, lest her beauty wane and waste,  
Lord Indra's self will come to her  
With heavenly food, and minister.  
Then envoys of the Vánar race  
By Ráma sent will seek this place.  
To them, O roamer of the air,  
The lady's fate shalt thou declare.  
Thou must not move--so maimed thou art  
Thou canst not from this spot depart.  
Await the day and moment due,  
And thy burnt wings will sprout anew.  
I might this day the boon bestow  
And bid again thy pinions grow,  
But wait until thy saving deed  
The nations from their fear have freed.  
Then for this glorious aid of thine  
The princes of Ikshváku's line,  
And Gods above and saints below  
Eternal gratitude shall owe.  
Fain would mine aged eyes behold  
That pair of whom my lips have told,  
Yet wearied here I must not stay,  
But leave my frame and pass away.'
