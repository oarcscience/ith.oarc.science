The hermit ceased: the tale was done:<BR>
Then in a transport Raghu's son<BR>

<P>

<P>


<P>
Again addressed the ancient sire<BR>
Resplendent as a burning fire:<BR>
'O holy man, I fain would hear<BR>
The tale repeated full and clear<BR>
How he from whom my sires descend<BR>
Brought the great rite to happy end.'<BR>
The hermit answered with a smile:<BR>
'Then listen, son of Raghu, while<BR>
My legendary tale proceeds<BR>
To tell of high-souled Sagar's deeds.<BR>
Within the spacious plain that lies<BR>
From where Him&aacute;laya's heights arise<BR>
To where proud Vindhya's rival chain<BR>
Looks down upon the subject plain--<BR>
A land the best for rites declared--&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
His sacrifice the king prepared.<BR>
And Ans'um&aacute;n the prince--for so<BR>
Sagar advised--with ready bow<BR>
Was borne upon a mighty car<BR>
To watch the steed who roamed afar.<BR>
But Indra, monarch of the skies,<BR>
Veiling his form in demon guise,<BR>
Came down upon the appointed day<BR>
And drove the victim horde away.<BR>
Reft of the steed the priests, distressed,<BR>
The master of the rite addressed;<BR>
'Upon the sacred day by force<BR>
A robber takes the victim horse.<BR>
Haste, King! now let the thief be slain;<BR>
Bring thou the charger back again:<BR>
The sacred rite prevented thus<BR>
Brings scathe and woe to all of us.<BR>
Rise, monarch, and provide with speed.<BR>
That naught its happy course impede.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  King Sagar in his crowded court<BR>
Gave ear unto the priests' report.<BR>
He summoned straightway to his side<BR>
His sixty thousand sons, and cried:<BR>
'Brave sons of mine, I knew not how<BR>
These demons are so mighty now:<BR>
The priests began the rite so well<BR>
All sanctified with prayer and spell.<BR>
If in the depths of earth he hide,<BR>
Or lurk beneath the ocean's tide,<BR>

<P>
Pursue, dear sons, the robber's track;<BR>
Slay him and bring the charger back.<BR>
The whole of this broad earth explore,<BR>
Sea-garlanded, from shore to shore:<BR>
Yea, dig her up with might and main<BR>
Until you see the horse again.<BR>
Deep let your searching labour reach,<BR>
A league in depth dug out by each.<BR>
The robber of our horse pursue,<BR>
And please your sire who orders you.<BR>
My grandson, I, this priestly train,<BR>
Till the steed comes, will here remain.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Their eager hearts with transport burned<BR>
As to their task the heroes turned.<BR>
Obedient to their father, they<BR>
Through earth's recesses forced their way.<BR>
With iron arms' unflinching toil<BR>
Each dug a league beneath the soil.<BR>
Earth, cleft asunder, groaned in pain,<BR>
As emulous they plied amain<BR>
Sharp-pointed coulter, pick, and bar,<BR>
Hard as the bolts of Indra are.<BR>
Then loud the horrid clamour rose<BR>
Of monsters dying 'neath their blows,<BR>
Giant and demon, fiend and snake,<BR>
That in earth's core their dwelling make.<BR>
They dug, in ire that naught could stay,<BR>
Through sixty thousand leagues their way,<BR>
Cleaving the earth with matchless strength<BR>
Till hell itself they reached at length.<BR>
Thus digging searched they Jambudvip &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="ry041.htm#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
With all its hills and mountains steep.<BR>
Then a great fear began to shake<BR>
The heart of God, bard, fiend, and snake,<BR>
And all distressed in spirit went<BR>
Before the Sire Omnipotent.<BR>
With signs of woe in every face<BR>
They sought the mighty Father's grace,<BR>
And trembling still and ill at ease<BR>
Addressed their Lord in words like these:<BR>
'The sons of Sagar, Sire benign,<BR>
Pierce the whole earth with mine on mine,<BR>
And as their ruthless work they ply<BR>
Innumerable creatures die,<BR>
'This is the thief,' the princes say,<BR>
'Who stole our victim steed away.<BR>
This marred the rite, and caused us ill.<BR>
And so their guiltless blood they spill.'<BR>
