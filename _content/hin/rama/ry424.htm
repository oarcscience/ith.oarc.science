<P>
When R&aacute;ma and the host he led<BR>
Across the sea had safely sped.<BR>
Thus R&aacute;van, moved by wrath and pride.<BR>
To S'uka and to S&aacute;ran cried:<BR>
'O counsellors, the V&aacute;nar host<BR>
Has passed the sea from coast to coast,<BR>
And Das'aratha's son has wrought<BR>
A wondrous deed surpassing thought.<BR>
And now in truth I needs must know<BR>
The strength and number of the foe.<BR>
Go ye, to R&aacute;ma's host repair<BR>
And count me all the legions there.<BR>
Learn well what power each captain leads<BR>
His name and fame for warlike deeds.<BR>
Learn by what artist's wondrous aid<BR>
That bridge athwart the sea was made;<BR>
Learn how the V&aacute;nar hoat came o'er<BR>
And halted on the island shore.<BR>
Mark R&aacute;ma son of Raghu well;<BR>
His valour, strength, and weapons tell.<BR>
Watch his advisers one by one,<BR>
And Lakshman, Raghu's younger son.<BR>
Learn with observant eyes, and bring<BR>
Unerring tidings to your king.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: then swift in V&aacute;nar guise<BR>
Forth on their errand sped the spies.<BR>
They reached the V&aacute;nars, and, dismayed,<BR>
Their never-ending lines surveyd:<BR>
Nor would they try, in mere despair,<BR>
To count the countless legions there,<BR>

<P>

<P>
That crowded valley, plain and hill,<BR>
That pressed about each cave and rill.<BR>
Though sea-like o'er the land were spread<BR>
The endless hosts which R&aacute;ma led,<BR>
The bridge by thousands yet was lined,<BR>
And eager myriads pressed behind.<BR>
But sage Vibh&iacute;shan's watchful eyes<BR>
Had marked the giants in disguise.<BR>
He gave command the pair to seize,<BR>
And told the tale in words like these:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O  R&aacute;ma these, well known erewhile,<BR>
Are giant sons of Lank&aacute;'s isle.<BR>
Two counsellors of R&aacute;van sent<BR>
To watch the invading armament.'<BR>
&nbsp; Vibh&iacute;shan ceased: at R&aacute;ma's look<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas envoys quailed and shook;<BR>
Then suppliant hand to hand they pressed<BR>
And thus Ikshv&aacute;ku's son addressed:<BR>
'O R&aacute;ma, bear the truth we speak:<BR>
Our monarch R&aacute;van bade us seek<BR>
The V&aacute;nar legions and survey<BR>
Their numbers, strength, and vast array'.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma, friend and hope and guide<BR>
Of suffering creatures, thus replied:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Now giants, if your eyes have scanned<BR>
Our armies, numbering every band,<BR>
Marked lord and chief, and gazed their fill,<BR>
Return to R&aacute;van when ye will.<BR>
It aught remain, if aught anew<BR>
Ye fain would scan with closer view,<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan, ready at your call,<BR>
Will lead you forth and show you all.<BR>
Think not of bonds and capture; fear<BR>
No loss of life, no peril here:<BR>
For, captive, helpless and unarmed,<BR>
An envoy never should be harmed.<BR>
Again to Lank&aacute;'s town repair,<BR>
Speed to the giant monarch there,<BR>
And be these words to R&aacute;van told,<BR>
Fierce brother of the Lord of Gold:<BR>
'Now, tyrant, tremble for thy sin:<BR>
Call up thy friends, thy kith and kin,<BR>
And let the power and might be seen<BR>
Which made thee bold to steal my queen.<BR>
To-morrow shall thy mournful eye<BR>
Behold thy bravest warriors die,<BR>
And Lank&aacute;'s city, tower and wall,<BR>
Struck by my fiery shafts, will fall.<BR>
Then shall my vengeful blow descend<BR>
Its rage on thee and thine to spend,<BR>
Fierce as the fiery bolt that flew<BR>
From heaven against the D&aacute;nav crew,<BR>
Mid these rebellious demons sent<BR>
By him who rules the firmament.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spake Ikshv&aacute;ku's son, and ceased:<BR>
The giants from their bonds released<BR>
Lauded the King with glad accord,<BR>
And hasted homeward to their lord.<BR>
Before the tyrant side by side<BR>
S'uka and S&aacute;ran stood and cried:<BR>

<P>
'Vibh&iacute;shan seized us, King, and fain<BR>
His helpless captives would have slain.<BR>
But glorious R&aacute;ma saw us; he,<BR>
Great-hearted hero, made us free.<BR>
There in one spot our eyes beheld<BR>
Four chiefs on earth unparalleled,<BR>
Who with the guardian Gods may vie<BR>
Who rule the regions of the sky.<BR>
There R&aacute;ma stood, the boast and pride<BR>
Of Raghu's race, by Lakshman's side.<BR>
There stood the sage Vibh&iacute;shan, there<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va strong beyond compare.<BR>
These four alone can batter down<BR>
Gate, rampart, wall, and Lanka's town.<BR>
Nay, R&aacute;ma matchless in his form,<BR>
A single foe, thy town would storm:<BR>
So wondrous are his weapons, he<BR>
Needs not the succour of the three.<BR>
Why speak we of the countless train<BR>
That fills the valley, hill and plain,<BR>
The millions of the V&aacute;nar breed<BR>
Whom R&aacute;ma and Sugr&iacute;va lead?<BR>
O King, be wise, contend no more,<BR>
And Sit&aacute; to her lord restore.'<BR>
