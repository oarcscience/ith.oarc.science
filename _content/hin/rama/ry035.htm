<P>
Their task achieved, the princes spent<BR>
That night with joy and full content.<BR>
Ere yet the dawn was well displayed<BR>
Their morning rites they duly paid,<BR>
And sought, while yet the light was faint,<BR>
The hermits and the mighty saint.<BR>
They greeted first that holy sire<BR>
Resplendent like the burning fire,<BR>
And then with noble words began<BR>
Their sweet speech to the sainted man:<BR>
'Here stand, O Lord, thy servants true:<BR>
Command what thou wouldst have us do.'<BR>
The saints, by Vis'v&aacute;mitra led,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma thus in answer said:<BR>
'Janak the king who rules the land<BR>
Of fertile Mithil&aacute; has planned<BR>
A noble sacrifice, and we<BR>
Will thither go the rite to see.<BR>
Thou, Prince of men, with us shalt go,<BR>
And there behold the wondrous bow,<BR>
Terrific, vast, of matchless might,<BR>
Which, splendid at the famous rite,<BR>
The Gods assembled gave the king.<BR>
No giant, fiend, or God can string<BR>
That gem of bows, no heavenly bard:<BR>
Then, sure, for man the task were hard.<BR>
When lords of earth have longed to know<BR>
The virtue of that wondrous bow,<BR>
The strongest sons of kings in vain<BR>
Have tried the mighty cord to strain.<BR>
This famous bow thou there shalt view,<BR>
And wondrous rites shalt witness too.<BR>
The high-souled king who lords it o'er<BR>
The realm of Mithil&aacute; of yore<BR>
Gained from the Gods this bow, the price<BR>
Of his imperial sacrifice.<BR>
Won by the rite the glorious prize<BR>
Still in the royal palace lies,<BR>
Laid up in oil of precious scent<BR>
With aloe-wood and incense blent.'<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma answering, Be it so,<BR>
Made ready with the rest to go.<BR>
The saint himself was now prepared,<BR>
But ere beyond the grove he fared,<BR>
He turned him and in words like these<BR>
Addressed the sylvan deities:<BR>
'Farewell! each holy rite complete,<BR>
I leave the hermits' perfect seat:<BR>
To Gang&aacute;'s northern shore I go<BR>
Beneath Him&aacute;laya's peaks of snow.'<BR>
With reverent steps he paced around<BR>
The limits of the holy ground,<BR>
And then the mighty saint set forth<BR>
And took his journey to the north.<BR>
His pupils, deep in Scripture's page,<BR>
Followed behind the holy sage,<BR>
And servants from the sacred grove<BR>
A hundred wains for convoy drove.<BR>
The very birds that winged that air,<BR>
The very deer that harboured there,<BR>
Forsook the glade and leafy brake<BR>
And followed for the hermit's sake.<BR>
They travelled far, till in the west<BR>
The sun was speeding to his rest,<BR>
And made, their portioned journey o'er,<BR>
Their halt on S'ona's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> distant shore.<BR>
The hermits bathed when sank the sun,<BR>
And every rite was duly done,<BR>
Oblations paid to Fire, and then<BR>
Sate round their chief the holy men.<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman lowly bowed<BR>
In reverence to the hermit crowd,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, having sate him down<BR>
Before the saint of pure renown,<BR>

<P>
With humble palms together laid<BR>
His eager supplication made:<BR>
'What country, O my lord, is this,<BR>
Fair-smiling in her wealth and bliss?<BR>
Deign fully. O thou mighty Seer,<BR>
To tell me, for I long to hear.'<BR>
Moved by the prayer of R&aacute;ma, he<BR>
Told forth the country's history.<BR>
