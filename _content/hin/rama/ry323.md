### CANTO XLIX.: ANGAD'S SPEECH.

Then Angad spake: 'We Vánars  
Have searched each valley, cave, and dell,  
And hill, and brook, and dark recess,  
And tangled wood, and wilderness.  
But all in vain: no eye has seen  
The robber or the Maithil queen.  
A dreary time has passed away,  
And stern is he we all obey.  
Come, cast your grief and sloth aside:  
Again be every effort tried;  
So haply may our toil attain  
The sweet success that follows pain.  
Laborious effort, toil, and skill,  
The firm resolve, the constant will  
Secure at last the ends we seek:  
Hence, O my friends, I boldly speak.  
Once more then, noble hearts, once more  
Let us to-day this wood explore,  
And, languor and despair subdued,  
Purchase success with toil renewed.  

Sugríva king austere,  
And Ráma's wrath we needs must fear.  
Come, Vánarsye think it wise,  
And do the thing that I advise'  
   Then Gandhamádan replied  
With lips that toil and thirst had dried;  
'Obey his words, for wise and true  
Is all that he has counselled you.  
Come, let your hosts their toil renew  
And search each grove and desert through,  
Each towering hill and forest glade.  
By lake and brook and white cascade,  
Till every spot, as our great lord  
Commanded, be again explored.'  
   Uprose the Vánarsand all,  
Obedient to the chieftain's call,  
And over the southern region sped  
Where Vindhya's tangled forests spread.  
They clomb that hill that towers on high  
Like a huge cloud in autumn's sky,  
Where many a cavern yawns, and streaks  
Of radiant silver deck the peaks.  
In eager search they wandered through  
The forests where the Lodh trees grew,  
Where the dark leaves were thick and green,  
But found not Ráma's darling queen.  
Then faint with toil, their hearts depressed,  
Descending from the mountain's crest,  
Their weary limbs a while to ease  
They lay beneath the spreading trees.
