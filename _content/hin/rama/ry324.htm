Angad and T&aacute;ra by his side,<BR>
Again rose Hanum&aacute;ntried<BR>
Each mountain cavern, dark and deep,<BR>
And stony pass and wooded steep,<BR>
The lion's and the tiger's home,<BR>
By rushing torrents white with foam.<BR>
Then with new ardour, south and west,<BR>
O'er Vindhya's height the search they pressed.<BR>
The day prescribed was near and they<BR>
Still wandered on their weary way.<BR>
They reached the southern land beset<BR>
With woody mountains like a net.<BR>
At length a mighty cave they spied<BR>
That opened in a mountain's side.<BR>
Where many a verdant creeper grew<BR>
And o'er the mouth its tendrils threw.<BR>
Thence issued crane, and swan, and drake,<BR>
And trooping birds that love the lake.<BR>
The V&aacute;narsed within to cool<BR>
Their fevered lips in spring or pool.<BR>
Vast was the cavern dark and dread,<BR>
Where not a ray of light was shed;<BR>
Yet not the more their eyesight failed,<BR>

Their courage sank or valour quailed.<BR>
On through the gloom the V&aacute;narssed<BR>
With hunger, thirst, and toil distressed,<BR>
Poor helpless wanderers, sad, forlorn,<BR>
With wasted faces wan and worn.<BR>
At length, when life seemed lost for aye,<BR>
They saw a splendour as of day,<BR>
A wondrous forest, fair and bright,<BR>
Where golden trees shot flamy light.<BR>
And lotus-covered pools were there<BR>
With pleasant waters fresh and fair,<BR>
And streams their rippling currents rolled<BR>
By seats of silver and of gold.<BR>
Fair houses reared their stately height<BR>
Of burnished gold and lazulite,<BR>
And glorious was the lustre thrown<BR>
Through lattices of precious stone.<BR>
And there were flowers and fruit on stems<BR>
Of coral decked with rarest gems,<BR>
And emerald leaves on silver trees,<BR>
And honeycomb and golden bees.<BR>
Then as the V&aacute;narser drew,<BR>
A holy woman met their view.<BR>
Around her form was duly tied<BR>
A garment of the blackdeer's hide.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_753"></A><A HREF="ry325.htm#fn_753"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Pure votaress she shone with light<BR>
Of fervent zeal and holy rite.<BR>
Then Hanum&aacute;nre the rest<BR>
With reverent words the dame addressed:<BR>
'Who art thou? say: and who is lord<BR>
Of this vast cave with treasures stored?'<BR>
