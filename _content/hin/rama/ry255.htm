Soon as the fiend had set her down<BR>
Within his home in Lank&aacute;'s town<BR>
Triumph and joy filled Indra's breast,<BR>
Whom thus the Eternal Sire addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'This deed will free the worlds from woe<BR>
And cause the giants' overthrow.<BR>
The fiend has borne to Lank&aacute;'s isle<BR>
The body of the * smile,<BR>
True consort * to happy fate<BR>
W * and dedicate<BR>

She looks and longs for R&aacute;ma's face,<BR>
But sees a crowd of demon race,<BR>
And guarded by the giant's train<BR>
Pines for her lord and weeps in vain,<BR>
But Lank&aacute; founded on a steep<BR>
Is girdled by the mighty deep,<BR>
And how will R&aacute;ma know his fair<BR>
And blameless wife is prisoned there?<BR>
She on her woe will sadly brood<BR>
And pine away in solitude,<BR>
And heedless of herself, will cease<BR>
To live, despairing of release.<BR>
Yes, pondering on her fate, I see<BR>
Her gentle life in jeopardy.<BR>
Go, Indra, swiftly seek the place,<BR>
And look upon her lovely face.<BR>
Within the city make thy way:<BR>
Let heavenly food her spirit stay.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Brahma, spake: and He who slew<BR>
The cruel demon P&aacute;ka, flew<BR>
Where Lank&aacute;'s royal city lay,<BR>
And Sleep went with him on his way.<BR>
'Sleep,' cried the heavenly Monarch, 'close<BR>
Each giant's eye in deep repose.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Indra spoke, and Sleep fulfilled<BR>
With joy his mandate, as he willed,<BR>
To aid the plan the Gods proposed,<BR>
The demons' eyes in sleep she closed.<BR>
Then Sachi's lord, the Thousand-eyed,<BR>
To the Asoka garden hied.<BR>
He came and stood where Sit&aacute; lay,<BR>
And gently thus began to say:<BR>
'Lord of the Gods who hold the sky,<BR>
Dame of the lovely smile, am I.<BR>
Weep no more, lady, weep no more;<BR>
Thy days of woe will soon be o'er.<BR>
I come, O Janak's child, to be<BR>
The helper of thy lord and thee.<BR>
He through my grace, with hosts to aid,<BR>
This sea-girt land will soon invade.<BR>
'Tis by my art that slumbers close<BR>
The eyelids of thy giant foes.<BR>
Now I, with Sleep, this place have sought,<BR>
Videhau lady, and have brought<BR>
A gift of heaven's ambrosial food<BR>
To stay thee in thy solitude.<BR>
Receive it from my hand, and taste,<BR>
O lady of the dainty waist:<BR>
For countless ages thou shall be<BR>
From pangs of thirst and hunger free.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But doubt within her bosom woke<BR>
As to the Lord of Gods she spoke:<BR>
'How may I know for truth that thou<BR>
Whose form I see before me now<BR>
Art verily the King adored<BR>
By heavenly Gods, and S'achi's lord?<BR>
With Rhagu's sons I learnt to know<BR>
The certain signs which Godhead show.<BR>
These marks before mine eyes display<BR>
If o'er the Gods thou bear the sway.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The heavenly lord of S'achi heard.<BR>
And did according to her word,<BR>
Above the ground his feet were raised;<BR>
With eyelids motionless he gazed.<BR>
No dust upon his raiment lay,<BR>
And his bright wreath was fresh and gay.<BR>
Nor was the lady's glad heart slow<BR>
The Monarch of the Gods to know.<BR>
And while the tears unceasing ran<BR>
From her sweet eyes she thus began:<BR>
'My lord has gained a friend in thee,<BR>
And I this day thy presence see<BR>
Shown clearly to mine eyes, as when<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman, lords of men.<BR>
Beheld it, and their sire the king,<BR>
And Janak too from whom I spring.<BR>
Now I, O Monarch of the Blest,<BR>
Will eat this food at thy behest,<BR>
Which thou hast brought me, of thy grace,<BR>
To aid and strengthen Raghu's race.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She spoke, and by his words relieved,<BR>
The food from Indra's hand received,<BR>
Yet ere she ate the balm he brought.<BR>
On Lakshman and her lord she thought.<BR>
'If my brave lord be still alive,<BR>
If valiant Lakshman yet survive,<BR>
May this my taste of heavenly food<BR>
Bring health to them and bliss renewed!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    She ate, and that celestial food<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Stayed hunger, thirst, and lassitude,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And all her strength restored.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Great joy her hopeful spirit stirred<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  At the glad tidings newly heard<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Of Lakshman and her lord.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And Indra's heart was joyful too:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He bade the Maithil dame adieu,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His saving errand done.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With Sleep beside him parting thence<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He sought his heavenly residence<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To prosper Raghu's son.<BR>
