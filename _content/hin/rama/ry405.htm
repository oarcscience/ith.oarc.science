<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO VI.: R&Aacute;VAN'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
But when the giant king surveyed<BR>
His glorious town in ruin laid,<BR>
And each dire sign of victory won<BR>
By Hanum&aacute;n the Wind-God's son,<BR>
He vailed his angry eyes oppressed<BR>
By shame, and thus his lords addressed:<BR>
'The V&aacute;nar spy has passed the gate<BR>
Of Lank&aacute; long inviolate,<BR>
Eluded watch and ward, and seen<BR>
With his bold eyes the captive queen.<BR>
My royal roof with flames is red,<BR>
The bravest of my lords are dead,<BR>
And the fierce V&aacute;nar in his hate<BR>
Has left our city desolate.<BR>
Now ponder well the work that lies<BR>
Before us, ponder and advise.<BR>
With deep-observing judgment scan<BR>
The peril, and mature a plan.<BR>
From counsel, sages say, the root,<BR>
Springs victory, most glorious fruit.<BR>
First ranks the king, when woe impends<BR>
Who seeks the counsel of his friends,<BR>
Of kinsmen ever faithful found,<BR>
Or those whose hopes with his are bound,<BR>
Then with their aid his strength applies,<BR>
And triumphs in his enterprise.<BR>
Next ranks the prince who plans alone,<BR>
No counsel seeks to aid his own,<BR>
Weighs loss and gain and wrong and right,<BR>
And seeks success with earnest might.<BR>
Unwisest he who spurns delays,<BR>
Who counts no cost, no peril weighs,<BR>
Speeds to his aim, defying fate,<BR>
And risks his all, precipitate.<BR>
Thus too in counsel sages find<BR>
A best, a worst, a middle kind.<BR>
When gathered counsellors explore<BR>
The way by light of holy lore,<BR>
And all from first to last agree,<BR>
Is the best counsel of the three.<BR>
Next, if debate first waxes high,<BR>
And each his chosen plan would try<BR>
Till all agree at last, we deem<BR>
This counsel second in esteem.<BR>
Worst of the three is this, when each<BR>
Assails with taunt his fellow's speech;<BR>
When all debate, and no consent<BR>
Concludes the angry argument.<BR>
Consult then, lords; my task shall be<BR>
To crown with act your wise decree.<BR>
With thousands of his wild allies<BR>
The vengeful R&aacute;ma hither hies;<BR>
With unresisted might and speed<BR>
Across the flood his troops will lead,<BR>
Or for the V&aacute;nar host will drain<BR>
The channels of the conquered main.'<BR>
