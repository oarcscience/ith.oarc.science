### CANTO XLIV.: THE DESCENT OF GANGÀ.

The Lord of life the skies regained:  
The fervent king a year remained  
With arms upraised, refusing rest  
While with one toe the earth he pressed,  
Still as a post, with sleepless eye,  
The air his food, his roof the sky.  
Tho year had past. Then Umá's lord,  <span
id="fr_198"></span>[3b](#fn_198)  
King of creation, world adored,  
Thus spoke to great Bhagirath: 'I  
Well pleased thy wish will gratify,  
And on my head her waves shalll fling  
The daughter of the Mountains' King!  
He stood upon the lofty crest  
   That crowns the Lord of Snow,  
And bade the river of the Blest  
   Descend on earth below.  
Himálaya's child, adored of all,  
   The haughty mandate heard,  
And her proud bosom, at the call,  
   With furious wrath was stirred.  
Down from her channel in the skies  
   With awful might she sped  
With a giant's rush, in a giant's size.  
   On S'iva's holy head.  
'He calls me,' in her wrath she cried,  
   'And all my flood shall sweep  
And whirl him in its whelming tide  
   To hell's profoundest deep.  
He held tne river on his head,  
   And kept her wandering, where,  
Dense as Himalaya's woods, were spread  
   The tangles of his hair.  

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>  

No way to earth she found, ashamed,  
   Though long and sore she strove,  
Condemned, until her pride were tamed,  
   Amid his locks to rove.  
There, many lengthening seasons through,  
   The wildered river ran:  
Bhagirath saw it, and anew  
   His penance dire began.  
Then S'iva, for the hermit's sake,  
   Bade her long wanderings end,  
And sinking into Vindu's lake  
   Her weary waves descend.  
From Gangá, by the God set free,  
   Seven noble rivers came;  
Hládiní, Pávaní, and she  
   Called Naliní by name:  
These rolled their lucid waves along  
   And sought the eastern side.  
Suchakshu, Sítá fair and strong,  
   And Sindhu's mighty tide--  <span id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_199)  
These to the region of the west  
   With joyful waters sped:  
The seventh, the brightest and the best,  
   Flowed where Bhagírath led.  
On S'iva's head descending first  
   A rest the torrents found:  
Then down in all their might they burst  
   And roared along the ground.  
On countless glittering scales the beam  
   Of rosy morning flashed,  
Where flsh and dolphins through the stream  
   Fallen and falling dashed.  
Then bards who chant celestial lays  
   And nymphs of heavenly birth  
Flocked round upon that flow to gaze  
   That streamed from sky and earth.  
The Gods themselves from every sphere,  
   Incomparably bright,  
Borne in their golden cars drew near  
   To see the wondrous sight.  
The cloudless sky was all aflame  
   With the light of a hundred suns  
Where'er the shining chariots came  
   That bore those holy ones.  
So flashed the air with crested snakes  
   And fish of every hue  
As when the lightning's glory breaks  
   Through fields of summer blue.  
And white foam-clouds and silver spray  
   Were wildly tossed on high,  
Like swans that urge their homeward way  
   Across the autumn sky.  
Now ran the river calm and clear  
   With current strong and deep:  

Now slowly broadened to a mere,  
   Or scarcely seemed to creep.  
Now o'er a length of sandy plain  
   Her tranquil course she held:  
Now rose her waves and sank again,  
   By refluent waves repelled.  
So falling first on S'iva's head,  
Thence rushing to their earthly bed,  
In ceaseless fall the waters streamed,  
And pure with holy lustre gleamed.  
Then every spirit, sage, and bard,  
Condemned to earth by sentence hard,  
Pressed eagerly around the tide  
That S'iva's touch had sanctified.  
Then they whom heavenly doom had hurled,  
Accursed, to this lower world,  
Touched the pure wave, and freed from sin  
Resought the skies and entered in  
And all the world was glad, whereon  
The glorious water flowed and shone,  
For sin and stain were banished thence  
By the sweet river's influence.  
First, in a car of heavenly frame,  
The royal saint of deathless name,  
Bhagírath, very glorious rode,  
And after him fair Gangá flowed.  
God, sage, and bard, the chief in place  
Of spirits and the Nága race,  
Nymph, giant, fiend, in long array  
Sped where Bhagírath led the way;  
And all the hosts the flood that swim  
Followed the stream that followed him.  
Where'er the great Bhagírath led,  
There ever glorious Gangá fled,  
The best of floods, the rivers' queen,  
Whose waters wash the wicked clean.  
   It chanced that Jahnu, great and good,  
Engaged with holy offering stood;  
The river spread her waves around  
Flooding his sacrificial ground.  
The saint in anger marked her pride,  
And at one draught her stream he dried.  
Then God, and sage, and bard, afraid,  
To noble high-souled Jahnu prayed,  
And begged that he would kindly deem  
His own dear child that holy stream.  
Moved by their suit, he soothed their fears  
And loosed her waters from his ears.  
Hence Gangá through the world is styled  
Both Jáhnavi and Jahnu's child.  
Then onward still she followed fast,  
And reached the great sea bank at last.  
Thence deep below her way she made  
To end those rites so long delayed.  
The monarch reached the Ocean's side,  
And still behind him Gangá hied.  
He sought the depths which open lay  
Where Sagar's sons had dug their way.  
So leading through earth's nether caves  
The river's purifying waves.  

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>  

Over his kinsmen's dust the lord  
His funeral libation poured.  
Soon as the flood their dust bedewed,  
Their spirits gained beatitude,  
And all in heavenly bodies dressed  
Rose to the skies' eternal rest.  

Then thus to King Bhagírath said  
Brahmá, when, coming at the head  
Of all his bright celestial train,  
He saw those spirits freed from stain:  
'Well done! great Prince of men, well done!  
Thy kinsmen bliss and heaven have won.  
The sons of Sagar mighty-souled,  
Are with the Blest, as Gods, enrolled,  
Long as the Ocean's flood shall stand  
Upon the border of the land,  
So long shall Sagar's sons remain,  
And, godlike, rank in heaven retain.  
Gangá thine eldest child shall be.  
Called from thy name Bhágirathí;  
Named also--for her waters fell  
From heaven and flow through earth and hell--  
Tripathagá, stream of the skies.  
Because three paths she glorifies,  
And, mighty King, 'tis given thee now  
To free thee and perform thy vow.  
No longer, happy Prince, delay  
Drink-offerings to thy kin to pay,  
For this the holiest Sagar sighed,  
But mourned the boon he sought denied.  
Then Ans'umán, dear Prince! although  
No brighter name the world could show,  
Strove long the heavenly flood to gain  
To visit earth, but strove in vain.  
Nor was she by the sages' peer,  
Blest with all virtues, most austere,  
Thy sire Dilipa, hither brought,  
Though with fierce prayers the boon he sought.  
But thou, O King, earned success,  
And won high fame which God will bless.  
Through thee, O victor of thy foes,  
On earth this heavenly Gangá flows,  
And thou hast gained the meed divine  
That waits on virtue such as thine.  
Now in her ever holy wave  
Thyself, O best of heroes, lave:  
So shalt thou, pure from every sin,  
The blessed fruit of merit win.  
Now for thy kin who died of yore  
The meet libations duly pour.  
Above the heavens I now ascend:  
Depart, and bliss thy steps attend.'  

Thus to the mighty king who broke  
Hie foemens' might, Lord Brahmá spoke,  
And with his Gods around him rose  
To his own heaven of blest repose.  
The royal sage no more delayed,  

But, the libation duly paid,  
Home to his regal city hied  
With water cleansed and purified.  
There ruled he his ancestral state,  
Best of all men, most fortunate.  
And all the people joyed again  
In good Bhagírath's gentle reign.  
Rich, prosperous, and blest were they,  
And grief and sickness fled away.  
Thus, Ráma, I at length have told  
How Gangá came from heaven of old.  
Now, for the evening passes swift,  
I wish thee each auspicious gift.  
This story of the flood's descent  
Will give--for' tis most excellent--  
Wealth, purity, fame, length of days,  
And to the skies its hearers raise.'
