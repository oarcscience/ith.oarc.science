<P>
Sugr&iacute;va moved by wondering awe<BR>
The high-souled sons of Raghu saw,<BR>
In all their glorious arms arrayed;<BR>
And grief upon his spirit weighed.<BR>
To every quarter of the sky<BR>
He turned in fear his anxious eye,<BR>
And roving still from spot to spot<BR>
With troubled steps he rested not.<BR>
He durst not, as he viewed the pair,<BR>
Resolve to stand and meet them there:<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And drooping cheer and quailing breast<BR>
The terror of the chief confessed.<BR>
While the great fear his bosom shook,<BR>
Brief counsel with his lords he took;<BR>
Each gain and danger closely scanned,<BR>
What hope in flight, what power to stand,<BR>
While doubt and fear his bosom rent,<BR>
On Raghu's sons his eyes he bent,<BR>
And with a spirit ill at ease<BR>
Addressed his lords in words like these:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Those chiefs with wandering steps invade<BR>
The shelter of our pathless shade,<BR>
And hither come in fair disguise<BR>
Of hermit garb as B&aacute;li's spies.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each lord beheld with troubled heart<BR>
Those masters of the bowman's art,<BR>
And left the mountain side to seek<BR>
Sure refuge on a loftier peak.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chief in rapid flight<BR>
Found shelter on a towering height,<BR>
And all the band with one accord<BR>
Were closely gathered round their lord.<BR>
Their course the same, with desperate leap<BR>
Each made his way from steep to steep,<BR>
And speeding on in wild career<BR>
Filled every height with sudden fear.<BR>
Each heart was struck with mortal dread,<BR>
As on their course the V&aacute;nars sped,<BR>
While trees that crowned the steep were bent<BR>
And crushed beneath them as they went.<BR>
As in their eager flight they pressed<BR>
For safety to each mountain crest,<BR>
The wild confusion struck with fear<BR>
Tiger and cat and wandering deer.<BR>
The lords who watched Sugr&iacute;va's will<BR>
Were gathered on the royal hill,<BR>
And all with reverent hands upraised<BR>
Upon their king and leader gazed.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va feared some evil planned,<BR>
Some train prepared by B&aacute;li's hand.<BR>
But skilled in words that charm and teach,<BR>
Thus Hanum&aacute;n &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_539"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> began his speech:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dismiss, dismiss thine idle fear,<BR>
Nor dread the power of B&aacute;li here.<BR>
For this is Malaya's glorious hill &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_540"></A><A HREF="#fn_540"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Where B&aacute;l&iacute;'s might can work no ill.<BR>
I look around but nowhere see<BR>
The hated foe who made thee flee,<BR>
Fell B&aacute;li, fierce in form and face:<BR>
Then fear not, lord of V&aacute;nar race.<BR>
Alas, in thee I clearly find<BR>
The weakness of the V&aacute;nar kind,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
That loves from thought to thought to range,<BR>
Fix no belief and welcome change.<BR>
Mark well each hint and sign and scan,<BR>
Discreet aud wise, thine every plan.<BR>
How may a king, with sense denied,<BR>
The subjects of his sceptre guide?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Han&uacute;m&aacute;n, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_541"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> wise in hour of need,<BR>
Urged on the chief his prudent rede.<BR>
His listening ear Sugr&iacute;va bent,<BR>
And spake in words more excellent:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   'Where is the dauntless heart that free<BR>
From terror's chilling touch can see<BR>
Two stranger warriors, strong as those,<BR>
Equipped with swords and shafts and bows,<BR>
With mighty arms and large full eyes,<BR>
Like glorious children of the skies<BR>
B&aacute;li my foe, I ween, has sent<BR>
These chiefs to aid his dark intent.<BR>
Hence doubt and fear disturb me still,<BR>
For thousands serve a monarch's will,<BR>
In borrowed garb they come, and those<BR>
Who walk disguised are counted foes.<BR>
With secret thoughts they watch their time,<BR>
And wound fond hearts that fear no crime<BR>
My foe in state affairs is wise,<BR>
And prudent kings have searching eyes.<BR>
By other hands they strike the foe:<BR>
By meaner tools the truth they know.<BR>
Now to those stranger warriors turn,<BR>
And, less than king, their purpose learn.<BR>
Mark well the trick and look of each;<BR>
Observe his form and note his speech.<BR>
With care their mood and temper sound,<BR>
And, if their minds be friendly found,<BR>
With courteous looks and words begin<BR>
Their confidence and love to win.<BR>
Then as my friend and envoy speak,<BR>
And question where the strangers seek.<BR>
Ask why equipped with shaft and bow<BR>
Through this wild maze of wood they go.<BR>
If does, O chief, as first appear<BR>
Pure of all guile, in heart sincere,<BR>
Detect in speech and look the sin<BR>
And treachery that lurk within.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   He spoke: the Wind-God's son obeyed.<BR>
With ready zeal he sought the shade,<BR>
And reached with hasty steps the wood<BR>
Where Ragbu's son and Lakshman stood.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_542"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
The envoy in his faithful breast<BR>
Pondered Sugriv&aacute;'s high behest.<BR>
From Rishyam&uacute;ka's peak he hied<BR>
And placed him by the princes' side.<BR>
The Wind-God's son with cautious art<BR>
Had laid his V&aacute;nar form apart,<BR>
And wore, to cheat the strangers eyes,<BR>
A wandering mendicant's disguise. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_543"></A><A HREF="#fn_543"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Before the heroes' feet he bent<BR>
And did obeisance reverent,<BR>
And spoke, the gloirious pair to praise,<BR>
His words of truth in courteous phrase,<BR>
High honour duly paid, the best<BR>
Of all the V&aacute;nar kind addressed,<BR>
With free accord and gentle grace,<BR>
Those glories of their warrior race:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O hermits, blest in vows, who shine<BR>
Like royal saints or Gods divine,<BR>
O best of young ascetics, say<BR>
How to this spot you found your way,<BR>
Scaring the troops of wandering deer<BR>
And silvan things that harbour here<BR>
Searching amid the trees that grow<BR>
Where Pamp&aacute;'s gentle waters flow.<BR>
And lending from your brows a gleam<BR>
Of glory to the lovely stream.<BR>
Who are you, say, so brave and fair.<BR>
Clad in the bark which hermits wear?<BR>
I see you have the frequent sigh,<BR>
I see the deer before you fly.<BR>
While you, for strength and valour dread,<BR>
The earth, like lordly lions, tread,<BR>
Each bearing in his hand a bow,<BR>
Like Indra's own, to slay the foe,<BR>
With the grand paces of bull,<BR>
So bright and young and beautiful<BR>
The mighty arms you raise appear<BR>
Like trunks which elephants uprear,<BR>
And as you move this mountain-king &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_544"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Is glorious with the light you bring.<BR>
How have you reached, like Gods in face,<BR>
Best lords of earth, this lonely place,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
With tresses coiled in hermit guise,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_545"></A><A HREF="#fn_545"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And splendours of those lotus eyes?<BR>
As God's who leave their heavenly sphere,<BR>
Alike your beauteous forms appear.<BR>
Tne Lords of Day and Night&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_546"></A><A HREF="#fn_546"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> might thus<BR>
Stray from the skies to visit us.<BR>
Heroic youth, so broad of chest,<BR>
Fair with the beauty of the Blest,<BR>
With lion shoulders, tall and strong,<BR>
Like bulls who lead the lowing throng.<BR>
Your arms, unmatched for grace and length,<BR>
With massive clubs may vie in strength.<BR>
Why do no gauds those limbs adorn<BR>
Where priceless gems were meetly worn?<BR>
Each noble youth is fit, I deem,<BR>
To guard this earth, as lord supreme,<BR>
With all her woods and seas, to reign<BR>
From Meru's peak to Vindhya's chain.<BR>
Your smooth bows decked with dyes and gold<BR>
Are glorious in their masters' hold,<BR>
And with the arms of Indra &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_547"></A><A HREF="#fn_547"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> vie<BR>
Which diamond splendours beautify.<BR>
Your quivers glow with golden sheen,<BR>
Well stored with arrows fleet and keen,<BR>
Each gleaming like a flery snake<BR>
That joys the foeman's life to take.<BR>
As serpents cast their sloughs away<BR>
And all their new born sheen display,<BR>
So flash your mighty swords inlaid<BR>
With burning gold on hilt and blade.<BR>
Why are you silent, heroes? Why<BR>
My questions hear nor deign reply?<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, lord of virtuous mind.<BR>
The foremost of the V&aacute;nar kind.<BR>
An exile from his royal state,<BR>
Roams through the land disconsolate.<BR>
I Hanum&aacute;n, of V&aacute;nar race,<BR>
Sent by the king have sought this place,<BR>
For he, the pious, just, and true.<BR>
In friendly league would join with you.<BR>
Know, godlike youths, that I am one<BR>
Of his chief lords, the Wind-God's son.<BR>
With course unchecked I roam will,<BR>
And now from Rishyam&uacute;ka's hill.<BR>
To please his heart, his hope to speed,<BR>
I came disguised in beggar's weed.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Hanum&aacute;n, well trained in lore<BR>
Of language spoke, and said no more.<BR>
The son of Raghu joyed to hear<BR>
The envoy's speech, and bright of cheer<BR>
He turned to Lakshman by his side,<BR>
And thus in words of transport cried:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'The counselor we now behold<BR>
Of King Sugr&iacute;va righteous souled.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
His face I long have yearned to see,<BR>
And now his envoy comes to me<BR>
With sweetest words in courteous phrase<BR>
Answer this mighty lord who slays<BR>
His foemen, by Sugr&iacute;va sent.<BR>
This V&aacute;nar chief most eloquent.<BR>
For one whose words so sweetly flow<BR>
The whole Rig-veda &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_548"></A><A HREF="#fn_548"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> needs must know,<BR>
And in his well-trained memory store<BR>
The Yajush and the S&aacute;man's lore.<BR>
He must have bent his faithful ear<BR>
All grammar's varied rules to hear.<BR>
For his long speech how well he spoke!<BR>
In all its length no rule he broke.<BR>
In eye, on brow, in all his face<BR>
The keenest look no guile could trace.<BR>
No change of hue, no pose of limb<BR>
Gave sign that aught was false in him.<BR>
Concise, unfaltering, sweet and clear,<BR>
Without a word to pain the ear.<BR>
From chest to throat, nor high nor low,<BR>
His accents came in measured flow.<BR>
How well he spoke with perfect art<BR>
That wondrous speech that charmed the heart,<BR>
With finest skill and order graced<BR>
In words that knew nor pause nor haste!<BR>
That speech, with consonants that spring<BR>
From the three seats of uttering,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_549"></A><A HREF="#fn_549"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Would charm the spirit of a foe<BR>
Whose sword is raised for mortal blow.<BR>
How may a ruler's plan succeed<BR>
Who lacks such envoy good at need?<BR>
How fail, if one whose mind is stored<BR>
With gifts so rare assist his lord?<BR>
What plans can fail, with wisest speech<BR>
Of envoy's lips to further each?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma spoke: and Lakshman, taught<BR>
In all the art that utters thought,<BR>
To King S&uacute;gr&iacute;va's learned spy<BR>
Thus made his eloquent reply:<BR>
'Full well we know the gifts that grace<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, lord of V&aacute;nar race,<BR>
And hither turn our wandering feet<BR>
That we that high-souled king may meet<BR>
So now our pleasant task shall be<BR>
To do the words he speaks by thee.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His prudent speech the V&aacute;nar heard,<BR>
And all his heart with joy was stirred.<BR>
And hope that league with them would bring<BR>
Redress and triumph to his king.<BR>
