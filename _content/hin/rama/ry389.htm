<P>
My king Sugriva greets thee fair,<BR>
And bids me thus his rede declare.<BR>
Son of the God of Wind, by name<BR>
Hanum&aacute;n, to this isle I came.<BR>
To set the Maithil lady free<BR>
I crossed the barrier of the sea.<BR>
I roamed in search of her and found<BR>
Her weeping on that lovely ground.<BR>
Then in the lore of duty trained,<BR>
Who hast by stern devotion gained<BR>
This wondrous wealth and power and fame<BR>
Shouldst fear to wrong another's dame.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Hear thou my counsel, and be wise:<BR>
No fiend, no dweller in the skies<BR>
Can bear the shafts by Lakshman shot,<BR>
Or R&aacute;ma when his wrath is hot.<BR>
O Giant King, repent the crime<BR>
And soothe him while there yet is time.<BR>
Now be the Maithil queen restored<BR>
Uninjured to her sorrowing lord.<BR>
Soon wilt thou rue thy dire mistake:<BR>
She is no woman but a snake,<BR>
Whose very deadly bite will be<BR>
The ruin of thy house and thee.<BR>
Thy pride has led thy thoughts astray,<BR>
That fancy not a hand may slay<BR>
The monarch of the giants, screened<BR>
From mortal blow of God and fiend.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va still thy death may be:<BR>
No Yaksha, fiend, or God is he<BR>
And R&aacute;ma from a woman springs,<BR>
The mortal seed of mortal kings.<BR>
O think how B&aacute;li fell subdued;<BR>
Think on thy slaughtered multitude.<BR>
Respect those brave and strong allies;<BR>
Consult thy safety, and be wise.<BR>
I, even I, no helper need<BR>
To overthrow, with car and steed,<BR>
Thy city Lank&aacute; half divine:<BR>
The power but not the will is mine.<BR>
For Raghu's son, before his friend<BR>
Tne V&aacute;nar monarch, strove to end<BR>
With his own conquering arm the life<BR>
Of him who stole his darling wife.<BR>
Turn, and be wise, O R&aacute;van turn;<BR>
Or thou wilt see thy Lank&aacute; burn,<BR>
And with thy wives, friends, kith and kin<BR>
Be ruined for thy senseless sin.'<BR>
