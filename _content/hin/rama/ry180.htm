<P>
He spoke: and Bharat thus replied;<BR>
'If, false to every claim beside,<BR>
I ne'er in kingly duties fail,<BR>
What will my royal life avail?<BR>
Still should the custom be observed,<BR>
From which our line has never swerved,<BR>
Which to the younger son ne'er gives<BR>
The kingdom while the elder lives.<BR>
Now to Ayodhya rich and fair<BR>
With me, O Raghu's son, repair,<BR>
And to protect and gladden all<BR>
Our house, thyself as king install,<BR>
A king the world's opinion deems<BR>
A man: to me a God he seems,<BR>
Whose life in virtuous thoughts and deeds<BR>
The lives of other men exceeds.<BR>
When I in distant Kekaya stayed,<BR>
And thou hadst sought the forest shade,<BR>
Our father died, the saints' delight,<BR>
So constant in each holy rite.<BR>
Scarce with thy wife and Lakshman thou<BR>
Hadst journeyed forth to keep the vow,<BR>
When mourning for his son, forspent,<BR>
To heavenly rest the monarch went,<BR>
Then up, O lord of men, away!<BR>
His funeral rites of water pay:<BR>
I and S'atrughna, ere we came,<BR>
Neglected not the sacred claim.<BR>
But in the spirit-world, they say,<BR>
That gift alone is fresh for aye<BR>
Which best beloved hands have poured;<BR>
And thou his dearest art, my lord.<BR>
For thee he longed, for thee he grieved,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His every thought on thee was bent,<BR>
And crushed by woe, of thee bereaved,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He thought of thee as hence he went.'<BR>
