<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXVIII.: SUGR&Iacute;VA'S DEPARTURE.</H3>
<P>
Thus all the princely V&aacute;nars, true<BR>
To their appointed tasks, withdrew.<BR>
Suigr&iacute;va deemed already done<BR>
The work he planned for Raghu's son.<BR>
Then Lakshman gently spoke and cheered<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va for his valour feared:<BR>
' Now, chieftain, if thy will be so.<BR>
Forth from Kishkindh&aacute; let us go.'<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va's heart swelled high with pride<BR>
As to the prince he thus replied:<BR>
'Come, speed we forth without delay:<BR>
'Tis mine thy mandate to obey.'<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va bade the dames adieu,<BR>
And T&aacute;r&aacute; and the rest withdrew.<BR>
Then at their chieftain's summons came<BR>
The V&aacute;nars first in rank and fame,<BR>
A trusty brave and reverent band,<BR>
Meet e'en before a queen to stand.<BR>
They at his call made haste to bring<BR>
The litter of the glorious king.<BR>
' Mount, O my friend.' Sugr&iacute;va cried,<BR>
And straight Sumitr&aacute;'s son complied.<BR>
Then took by Lakshman's side his place<BR>
The sovereign of the woodland race,<BR>
Upraised by V&aacute;nars, fleet and strong.<BR>
Who bore the glittering load along.<BR>
On high above his royal head<BR>
A paly canopy was spread,<BR>
And chouries white in many a hand<BR>
The forehead of the monarch fanned,<BR>
And shell and drum and song and shout<BR>
Pealed round him as the king passed out.<BR>

About the monarch went a throng<BR>
Of V&aacute;nar warriors brave and strong,<BR>
As onward to the mountain shade<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma dwelt his way he made.<BR>
Soon as the lovely spot he viewed<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma lived in solitude,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar monarch, far-renowed,<BR>
With Lakshman, lightly stepped to ground,<BR>
And to the son of Raghu went<BR>
Joining his raised hands reverent.<BR>
As their great leader raised his hands,<BR>
So suppliant stood the V&aacute;nar bands.<BR>
Well pleased the son of Raghu saw<BR>
Those legions, hushed in reverent awe,<BR>
Stand silent like the tranquil floods<BR>
That raise their hands of lotus buds.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma, when the king, to greet<BR>
His friend, had bowed him at his feet,<BR>
Raised him who ruled the Vanar race,<BR>
And held him in a close embrace:<BR>
Then, when his arms he had unknit,<BR>
Besought him by his side to sit,<BR>
And thus with gentle words the best<BR>
Of men the V&aacute;nar king addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'The prince who well his days divides,<BR>
And knows aright the times and tides<BR>
To follow duty, joy, or gain,<BR>
He, only he, deserves to reign.<BR>
But he who wealth and virtue leaves,<BR>
And every hour to pleasure cleaves,<BR>
False from his bliss like him who wakes<BR>
From slumber on a branch that breaks.<BR>
True king is he who smites his foes,<BR>
And favour to his servants shows,<BR>
And of that fruit makes timely use<BR>
Which virtue, wealth, and joy produce.<BR>
The hour is come that bids thee rise<BR>
To aid me in my enterprise.<BR>
Then call thy nobles to debate,<BR>
And with their help deliberate.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Lost was my power,' the king replied,<BR>
'All strength had fled, all hope had died<BR>
The V&aacute;nars owned another lord,<BR>
But by thy grace was all restored.<BR>
All this, O conqueror of the foe,<BR>
To thee and Lakshman's aid I owe<BR>
And his should be the villain's shame<BR>
Who durst deny the sacred claim.<BR>
These V&aacute;nar chiefs of noblest birth<BR>
Have at my bidding roamed the earth,<BR>
And brought from distant regions all<BR>
Our legions at their monarch's call:<BR>
Fierce bears with monkey troops combined,<BR>
And apes of every varied kind,<BR>
Terrific in their forms, who dwell<BR>
In grove and wood and bosky dell:<BR>
The bright Gaudharvas' brood, the seed<BR>
Of Gods,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_651"></A><A HREF="#fn_651"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>  they change their shapes at need.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Each with his legions in array,<BR>
Hither, O Prince, they make their way,<BR>
They come: and tens of millions swell<BR>
To numbers that no tongue may tell.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_652"></A><A HREF="ry313.htm#fn_652"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
For thee their armies will unite<BR>
With chiefs, Mahendra's peers in might.<BR>
From Meru and from Vindhya's chain<BR>
They come like clouds that bring the rain.<BR>
These round thee to the war will go,<BR>
To smite to earth thy demon foe;<BR>
Will slay the R&aacute;kshas and restore<BR>
Thy consort when the fight is o'er."<BR>
