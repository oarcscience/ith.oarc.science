<P>
Guha the king, acquainted well<BR>
With all that in the wood befell,<BR>
To Bharat the unequalled told<BR>
The tale of Lakshman mighty-souled:<BR>
'With many an earnest word I spake<BR>
To Lakshman as he stayed awake,<BR>
And with his bow and shaft in hand<BR>
To guard his brother kept his stand:<BR>
'Now sleep a little, Lakshman, see<BR>
This pleasant bed is strewn for thee:<BR>
Hereon thy weary bodv lay,<BR>
And strengthen thee with rest, I pray,<BR>
Inured to toil are men like these,<BR>
But thou hast aye been nursed in ease.<BR>
Rest, duteous-minded! I will keep<BR>
My watch while R&aacute;ma lies asleep:<BR>
For in the whole wide world is none<BR>
Dearer to me than Raghu's son.<BR>
Harbour no doubt or jealous fear:<BR>
I speak the truth with heart sincere:<BR>
For from the grace which he has shown<BR>
Will glory on my name be thrown:<BR>
Great store of merit shall I gain,<BR>
And duteous, form no wish in vain.<BR>
Let me enforced by many a row<BR>
Of followers, armed with shaft and bow<BR>
For well-loved R&aacute;ma's weal provide<BR>
Who lies asleep by Sit&aacute;'s side.<BR>
For through this wood I often go,<BR>
And all its shades conceal I know:<BR>
And we with conquering arms can meet<BR>
A four-fold host arrayed complete.'<BR>
With words like these I spoke, designed<BR>
To move the high-souled Bharat's mind,<BR>
But he upon his duty bent,<BR>
Plied his persuasive argument:<BR>
'O, how can slumber close mine eyes<BR>
When lowly couched with Sit&aacute; lies<BR>
The royal R&aacute;ma? can I give<BR>
My heart to joy, or even live?<BR>
He whom no mighty demon, no,<BR>
Nor heavenly God can overthrow,<BR>
See, Guha, how he lies, alas,<BR>

With S&iacute;t&aacute; couched on gathered grass.<BR>
By varied labours, long, severe,<BR>
By many a prayer and rite austere,<BR>
He, Das'aratha's cherished son,<BR>
By Fortune stamped, from Heaven was won.<BR>
Now as his son is forced to fly,<BR>
The king ere long will surely die:<BR>
Reft of his guardian hand, forlorn<BR>
In widowed grief this land will mourn,<BR>
E'en now perhaps, with toil o'erspent,<BR>
The women cease their loud lament,<BR>
And cries of woe no longer ring<BR>
Throughout the palace of the king.<BR>
But ah for sad Kaus'aly&aacute;! how<BR>
Fare she and mine own mothef now?<BR>
How fares the king? this night, I think,<BR>
Some of the three in death will sink.<BR>
With hopes upon S'atrughna set<BR>
My mother may survive as yet,<BR>
But the sad queen will die who bore<BR>
The hero, for her grief is sore.<BR>
His cherished wish that would have made<BR>
Dear R&aacute;ma king, so long delayed,<BR>
'Too late! too late!' the king will cry,<BR>
And conquered by his misery die.<BR>
When Fate has brought the mournful day<BR>
Which sees my father pass away,<BR>
How happy in their lives are they<BR>
Allowed his funeral rites to pay.<BR>
Our exile o'er, with him who ne'er<BR>
Turns from the oath his lips may swear,<BR>
May we returning safe and well<BR>
Again in fair Ayodhy&aacute; dwell.'<BR>
Thus Bharat stood with many a sigh<BR>
Lamenting, and the night went by.<BR>
Soon as the morning light shone fair<BR>
In votive coils both bound their hair.<BR>
And then I sent them safely o'er<BR>
And left them on the farther shore.<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; then they onward passed,<BR>
Their coats of bark about them cast,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Their locks like hermits' bound,<BR>
The mighty tamers of the foe,<BR>
Each with his arrows and his bow,<BR>
Went over the rugged ground,<BR>
Proud in their strength and undeterred<BR>
Like elephants that lead the herd,<BR>
And gazing oft around.<BR>
