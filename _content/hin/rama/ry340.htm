<P>
But none of all the host was found<BR>
To clear the sea with desperate bound,<BR>
Though each, as Angad bade, declared<BR>
His proper power and what he dared. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_781"></A><A HREF="#fn_781"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Then spake good J&aacute;mbavan the sage,<BR>
Chief of them all for reverend age;<BR>

<P>


<P>
'I, V&aacute;nar chieftains, long ago<BR>
Limbs light to leap could likewise show,<BR>
But now on frame and spirit weighs<BR>
The burthen of my length of days.<BR>
Still task like this I may not slight,<BR>
When R&aacute;ma and our king unite.<BR>
So listen while I tell, O friends,<BR>
What lingering strength mine age attends.<BR>
If my poor leap may aught avail,<BR>
Of ninety leagues, I will not fail.<BR>
Far other strength in youth's fresh prime<BR>
I boasted, in the olden time,<BR>
When, at Prahl&aacute;da's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_782"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> solemn rite,<BR>
I circled in my rapid flight<BR>
Lord Vishnu, everlasting God,<BR>
When through the universe he trod.<BR>
But now my limbs are weak and old,<BR>
My youth is fled, its fire is cold,<BR>
And these exhausted nerves to strain<BR>
In such a task were idle pain,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Angad due obeisance paid,<BR>
And to the chief his answer made:<BR>
'Then I, ye noble V&aacute;nars, I<BR>
Mvself the mighty leap will try:<BR>
Although perchance the power I lack<BR>
To leap from Lank&aacute;'s island back'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus the impetuous chieftain cried,<BR>
And J&aacute;mbavan the sage replied:<BR>
'Whate'er thy power and might may be,<BR>
This task, O Prince, is not for thee.<BR>
Kings go not forth themselves, but send<BR>
The servants who their best attend.<BR>
Thou art the darling and the boast,<BR>
The honoured lord of all the host.<BR>
In thee the root, O Angad, lies<BR>
Of our appointed enterprise;<BR>
And thee, on whom our hopes depend,<BR>
Our care must cherish and defend.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then B&aacute;li's noble son replied:<BR>
'Needs must I go whate'er betide,<BR>
*** For, if no chief this exploit dare,<BR>
What waits us all save blank despair,--<BR>
Upon the ground again to lie<BR>
In hopeless misery, fast, and die?<BR>
For not a hope of life I see<BR>
If we neglect our king's decree*'<BR>
Then spoke the aged chief again:<BR>
'***Now your attempt shall not be in vain,<BR>
For to the task will I incite<BR>
A chieftain of sufficient might.'<BR>
