<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVI.: ALONE WITH SIT&Aacute;</H3>
<P>
So R&aacute;ma, to his purpose true,<BR>
To Queen Kaus'aly&aacute; bade adieu,<BR>
Received the benison she gave,<BR>
And to the path of duty clave.<BR>
As through the crowded street he passed,<BR>
A radiance on the way he cast,<BR>
And each fair grace, by all approved,<BR>
The bosoms of the people moved.<BR>

<P>
Now of the woeful change no word<BR>
The fair Videhan bride had heard;<BR>
The thought of that imperial rite<BR>
Still filled her bosom with delight.<BR>
With grateful heart and joyful thought<BR>
The Gods in worship she had sought,<BR>
And, well in royal duties learned,<BR>
Sat longing till her lord returned,<BR>
Not all unmarked by grief and shame<BR>
Within his sumptuous home he came,<BR>
And hurried through the happy crowd<BR>
With eye dejected, gloomy-browed.<BR>
Up Sit&aacute; sprang, and every limb<BR>
Trembled with fear at sight of him.<BR>
She marked that cheek where anguish fed,<BR>
Those senses care-disquieted.<BR>
For, when he looked on her, no more<BR>
Could his heart hide the load it bore,<BR>
Nor could the pious chief control<BR>
The paleness o'er his cheek that stole.<BR>
His altered cheer, his brow bedewed<BR>
With clammy drops, his grief she viewed,<BR>
And cried, consumed with fires of woe.<BR>
'What, O my lord, has changed thee so?<BR>

<P>
Vrihaspati looks down benign,<BR>
And the moon rests in Pushya's sign,<BR>
As Br&aacute;hmans sage this day declare:<BR>
Then whence, my lord, this grief and care?<BR>
Why does no canopy, like foam<BR>
For its white beauty, shade thee home,<BR>
Its hundred ribs spread wide to throw<BR>
Splendour on thy fair head below?<BR>
Where are the royal fans, to grace<BR>
The lotus beauty of thy face,<BR>
Fair as the moon or wild-swan's wing,<BR>
And waving round the new-made king?<BR>
Why do no sweet-toned bards rejoice<BR>
To hail thee with triumphant voice?<BR>
No tuneful heralds love to raise<BR>
Loud music in their monarch's praise?<BR>
Why do no Br&aacute;hmans, Scripture-read,<BR>
Pour curds and honey on thy head,<BR>
Anointed, as the laws ordain,<BR>
With holy rites, supreme to reign?<BR>
Where are the chiefs of every guild?<BR>
Where are the myriads should have filled<BR>
The streets, and followed home their king<BR>
With merry noise and triumphing?<BR>
Why does no gold-wrought chariot lead<BR>
With four brave horses, best for speed?<BR>
No elephant precede the crowd<BR>
Like a huge hill or thunder cloud,<BR>
Marked from his birth for happy fate,<BR>
Whom signs auspicious decorate?<BR>
Why does no henchman, young and fair,<BR>
Precede thee, and delight to bear<BR>
Entrusted to his reverent hold<BR>
The burthen of thy throne of gold?<BR>
Why, if the consecrating rite<BR>
Be ready, why this mournful plight?<BR>
Why do I see this sudden change,<BR>
This altered mien so sad and strange?'<BR>

<P>
To her, as thus she weeping cried,<BR>
Raghu's illustrious son replied:<BR>

<P>
'S&iacute;t&aacute;, my honoured sire's decree<BR>
Commands me to the woods to flee.<BR>
O high-born lady, nobly bred<BR>
In the good paths thy footsteps tread,<BR>
Hear, Janak's daughter, while I tell<BR>
The story as it all befell.<BR>
Of old my father true and brave<BR>
Two boons to Queen Kaikey&iacute; gave.<BR>
Through these the preparations made<BR>
For me today by her are stayed,<BR>
For he is bound to disallow<BR>
This promise by that earlier vow.<BR>
In Dandak forest wild and vast<BR>
Must fourteen years by me be passed.<BR>
My father's will makes Bharat heir,<BR>
The kingdom and the throne to share.<BR>
Now, ere the lonely wild I seek,<BR>
I come once more with thee to speak.<BR>
In Bharat's presence, O my dame,<BR>
Ne'er speak with pride of R&aacute;ma's name:<BR>
Another's eulogy to hear<BR>
Is hateful to a monarch's ear.<BR>
Thou must with love his rule obey<BR>
To whom my father yields the sway.<BR>
With love and sweet observance learn<BR>
His grace, and more the king's, to earn.<BR>
Now, that my father may not break<BR>
The words of promise that he spake,<BR>
To the drear wood my steps are bent:<BR>
Be firm, good S&iacute;t&aacute;, and content.<BR>
Through all that time, my blameless spouse,<BR>
Keep well thy fasts and holy vows,<BR>
Rise from thy bed at break of day,<BR>
And to the Gods due worship pay.<BR>
With meek and lowly love revere<BR>
The lord of men, my father dear,<BR>
And reverence to Kaus'aly&aacute; show,<BR>
My mother, worn with eld and woe:<BR>
By duty's law, O best of dames,<BR>
High worship from thy love she claims,<BR>
Nor to the other queens refuse<BR>
Observance, rendering each her dues:<BR>
By love and fond attention shown<BR>
They are my mothers like mine own.<BR>
Let Bharat and S'atrughna bear<BR>
In thy sweet love a special share:<BR>
Dear as my life, O let them be<BR>
Like brother and like son to thee.<BR>
In every word and deed refrain<BR>
From aught that Bharat's soul may pain:<BR>
He is Ayodhy&aacute;'s king and mine,<BR>
The head and lord of all our line.<BR>
For those who serve and love them much<BR>
With weariless endeavour, touch<BR>
And win the gracious hearts of kings.<BR>
While wrath from disobedience springs.<BR>
Great monarchs from their presence send<BR>
Their lawful sons who still offend,<BR>
And welcome to the vacant place<BR>
Good children of an alien race.<BR>
Then, best of women, rest thou here,<BR>
And Bharat's will with love revere.<BR>
Obedient to thy king remain,<BR>
And still thy vows of truth maintain.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To the wide wood my steps I bend:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Make thou thy dwelling here;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  See that thy conduct ne'er offend,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     And keep my words, my dear.'<BR>
