<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When S'avar&iacute; had sought the skies<BR>
And gained her splendid virtue's prize,<BR>
R&aacute;ma with Lakshman stayed to brood<BR>
O'er the strange scenes their eyes had viewed.<BR>
His mind upon those saints was bent,<BR>
For power and might preeminent<BR>
And he to musing Lakshman spoke<BR>
The thoughts that in his bosom woke:<BR>

<P>
'Mine eyes this wondrous home have viewed<BR>
Of those great saints with souls subdued,<BR>
Where peaceful tigers dwell and birds,<BR>
And deer abound in heedless herds.<BR>
Our feet upon the banks have stood<BR>
Of those seven lakes within the wood,<BR>
Where we have duly dipped, and paid<BR>
Libations to each royal shade.<BR>
Forgotten now are thoughts of ill<BR>
And joyful hopes my bosom fill.<BR>
Again my heart is light and gay<BR>
And grief and care have passed away.<BR>
Come, brother, let us hasten where<BR>
Bright Pamp&aacute;'s flood is fresh and fair,<BR>
And towering in their beauty near<BR>
Mount Rishyam&uacute;ka's heights appear,<BR>
When, offspring of the Lord of Light,<BR>
Still fearing B&aacute;li's conquering might,<BR>
With four brave chiefs of V&aacute;nar race<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va makes his dwelling-place.<BR>
I long with eager heart to find<BR>
That leader of the V&aacute;nar kind,<BR>
For on that chief my hopes depend<BR>
That this our quest have prosperous end.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma spoke, in battle tried,<BR>
And thus Sumitr&aacute;'s son replied:<BR>
'Come, brother, come, and speed away:<BR>
My spirit brooks no more delay.'<BR>
Thus spake Sumitr&aacute;'s son, and then<BR>
Forth from the grove the king of men<BR>
With his dear brother by his side<BR>
To Pamp&aacute;'s lucid waters hied.<BR>
He gazed upon the winds where grew<BR>
Trees rich in flowers of every hue.<BR>
From brake and dell on every side<BR>
The curlew and the peacock cried,<BR>
And flocks of screaming parrots made<BR>
Shrill music in the bloomy shade.<BR>
His eager eyes, as on he went,<BR>
On many a pool and tree were bent.<BR>
Inflamed with love he journeyed on<BR>
Till a fair flood before him shone.<BR>
He stood upon the water's side<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Which streams from distant hills supplied<BR>
Mataranga's * name that water bore:<BR>
There bathed he from the shelving shore.<BR>
Then, each on earnest thoughts intent,<BR>
Still farther on their way they went.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma's heart once more gave way<BR>
Beneath his grief and wild dismay.<BR>
Before him lay the noble flood<BR>
Adorned with many a lotus bud.<BR>
On its fair banks As'okas glowed,<BR>
And all bright trees their blossoms showed<BR>
Green banks that silver waves confined<BR>
With lovely groves--were ringed and lined<BR>
The crystal waters in their flow<BR>
Showed level sands that gleamed below.<BR>
There glittering fish and tortoise played,<BR>
And bending trees gave pleasant shade.<BR>

<P>
There creepers on the branches hung<BR>
With lover-like embraces clung,<BR>
There gay Gandharvas loved to meet,<BR>
And Kinnar sought the calm retreat.<BR>
There wandering Vakshas* found delight,<BR>
Snake gods and rovers of the night.<BR>
Cool were the pleasant waters, gay<BR>
Each tree with creeper, flower, and spray.<BR>
There flushed the lotus darkly red,<BR>
Here their white glory lilies spread,<BR>
Here sweet buds showed their tints of blue:<BR>
So carpets gleam with many a hue.<BR>
A grove of Mangoes blossomed nigh,<BR>
Echoing with the peacock's cry.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma by his brother's side<BR>
The lovely flood of Pamp&aacute; eyed,<BR>
Decked like a beauty, fair to see<BR>
With every charm of flower and tree,<BR>
His mighty heart with woe was rent<BR>
And thus he spoke in wild lament<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Here, Lakshman, on this beauteous shore,<BR>
Stands, dyed with tints of many an ore,<BR>
The mountain Rishyam&uacute;ka bright<BR>
With flowery trees that crown each height.<BR>
Sprung from the chief who, famed of yore,<BR>
The name of Rikshnrajas bore,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, chieftain strong and dread,<BR>
Dwells on that mountain's towering head.<BR>
Go to him, best of men, and seek<BR>
That prince of V&aacute;nars on the peak,<BR>
I cannot longer brook my pain,<BR>
Or, S&iacute;t&aacute; lost, my life retain.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus by the pangs of love distressed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His thoughts on S&iacute;t&aacute; bent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His faithful brother he addressed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And cried in wild lament.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He reached the lovely ground that lay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    On Pamp&aacute;'s wooded side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And told in anguish and dismay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The grief he could not hide.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With listless footsteps faint and slow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His way the chief pursued,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Till Pamp&aacute; with her glorious show<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of flowering woods he viewed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Through shades were every bird was found<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The prince with Lakshman passed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And Pamp&aacute; with her groves around<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Burst on his eyes, at last.<BR>
