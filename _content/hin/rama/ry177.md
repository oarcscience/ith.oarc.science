### CANTO XCIX.: BHARAT'S APPROACH.

Soon as the warriors took their rest  
Obeying Bharat's high behest,  
Thus Bharat to Satrughna spake:  
'A band of soldiers with thee take,  
And with these hunters o'er and o'er  
The thickets of the wood explore.  
With bow, sword, arrows in their hands  
Let Guba with his kindred bands  
Within this grove remaining trace  
The children of Kakutstha's race.  
And I meanwhile on foot will through  
This neighbouring wood my way pursue,  
With elders and the twice-born men,  
And every lord and citizen.  
There is, I feel, no rest for me  
Till Rama's face again I see,  
Lakshman, in arms and glory great,  
And Sita born to happy fate:  
No rest, until his cheek as bright  
As the fair moon rejoice my sight,  
No rest until I see the eye  
With which the lotus petals vie;  
Till on my head those dear feet rest  
With signs of royal rank impressed;  
None, till my kingly brother gain  
His old hereditary reign,  
Till o'er his limbs and noble head  
The consecrating drops be shed.  
How blest is Janak's daughter, true  
To every wifely duty, who  
Cleaves faithful to her husband's side  
Whose realm is girt by Ocean's tide!  
This mountain too above the rest  
E'en as the King of Hills is blest,--  
Whose shades Kakutstha's scion hold  
As Nandan charms the Lord of Gold.  
Yea, happy is this tangled grove  
Where savage beasts unnumbered rove,  
Where, glory of the Warrior race,  
King Rama finds a dwelling-place.'  
   Thus Bharat, strong-armed hero spake,  
And walked within the pathless brake.  
O'er plains where gay trees bloomed he went,  
Through boughs in tangled net-work bent,  
And then from Rama's cot appeared  
The banner which the flame upreared.  
And Bharat joyed with every friend  
To mark those smokv wreaths ascend:  
'Here Rama dwells,' he thought; 'at last  
The ocean of our toil is passed.'  
   Then sure that Rama's hermit cot  
     Was on the mountain's side  
   He stayed his army on the spot,  
     And on with Guha hied.
