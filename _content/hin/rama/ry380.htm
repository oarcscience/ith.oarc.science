<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLII.: THE GIANTS ROUSED.</H3>
<P>
The cries of startled birds, the sound<BR>
Of tall trees crashing to the ground,<BR>
Struck with amaze each giant's ear.<BR>
And filled the isle with sudden fear.<BR>
Then, wakened by the crash and cries,<BR>
The fierce shefiends unclosed their eyes,<BR>
And saw the V&aacute;nar where he stood<BR>
Amid the devastated wood.<BR>
The more to scare them with the view<BR>
To size immense the V&aacute;nar grew;<BR>
And straight the R&aacute;kshas warders cried<BR>
Janak's daughter terrified<BR>
Whose envoy, whence, and who is he,<BR>
Why has he come to talk with thee?<BR>
Speak, lady of the lovely eyes,<BR>
And let not fear thy joy disguise.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then thus replied the Maithil dame<BR>
Of noble soul and perfect frame.<BR>
'Can I discern, with scanty skill,<BR>
These fiends who change their forms at will?<BR>
'Tis yours to say: your kin you meet;<BR>
A serpent knows a serpent's feet.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  I weet not who he is: the sight<BR>
Has filled my spirit with affright.'<BR>
Some pressed round S&iacute;t&aacute; in a ring;<BR>
Some bore the story to their king:<BR>
'A mighty creature of our race,<BR>
In monkey form, has reached the place.<BR>
He came within the grove,' they cried,<BR>
'He stood and talked by S&iacute;t&aacute;'s side,<BR>
He comes from Indra's court to her,<BR>
Or is Kuvera's messenger;<BR>
Or R&aacute;ma sent the spy to seek<BR>
His consort, and her wrongs to wreak.<BR>
His crushing arm, his trampling feet<BR>
Have marred and spoiled that dear retreat,<BR>
And all the pleasant place which thou<BR>
So lovest is a ruin now.<BR>
The tree where S&iacute;t&aacute; sat alone<BR>
Is spared where all are overthrown.<BR>
Perchance he saved the dame from harm:<BR>
Perchance the toil had numbed his arm.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then flashed the giant's eye with fire<BR>
Like that which lights the funeral pyre.<BR>
He bade his bravest Kinkars &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_878"></A><A HREF="#fn_878"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> speed<BR>

<P>
And to his feet the spoiler lead.<BR>
Forth from the palace, at his hest,<BR>
Twice forty thousand warriors pressed.<BR>
Burning for battle, strong and fierce,<BR>
With clubs to crush and swords to pierce,<BR>
They saw Han&uacute;m&aacute;n near a porch,<BR>
And, thick as moths around a torch,<BR>
Rushed on the foe with wild attacks<BR>
Of mace and club and battle-axe.<BR>
As round him pressed the R&aacute;kshas crowd,<BR>
The wondrous monkey roared aloud,<BR>
That birds fell headlong from the sky:<BR>
Then spake he with a mighty cry:<BR>
'Long life to Das'aratha's heir,<BR>
And Lakshman, ever-glorious pair<BR>
Long life to him who rules our race,<BR>
Preserved by noblest R&aacute;ma's grace<BR>
I am the slave of Kosal's king,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_879"></A><A HREF="#fn_879"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Whose wondrous deeds the minstrels sing.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n I, the Wind-God's seed:<BR>
Beneath this arm the foemen bleed.<BR>
I fear not, unapproached in might,<BR>
A thousand R&aacute;vans ranged for fight,<BR>
Although in furious hands they rear<BR>
The hill and tree for sword and spear,<BR>
I will, before the giants' eyes,<BR>
Their city and their king chastise;<BR>
And, having communed with the dame,<BR>
Depart in triumph as I came.'<BR>
&nbsp; At that terrific roar and yell<BR>
The heart of every giant fell.<BR>
But still their king's command they feared<BR>
And pressed around with arms upreared.<BR>
Beside the porch a club was laid:<BR>
The V&aacute;nar caught it up, and swayed<BR>
The weapon round his head, and slew<BR>
The foremost of the R&aacute;kshas crew.<BR>
Thus Indra vanquished, thousand-eyed,<BR>
The Daityas who the Gods defied.<BR>
Then on the porch Han&uacute;m&aacute;n sprang,<BR>
And loud his shout of triumph rang.<BR>
The giants looked upon the dead,<BR>
And turning to their monarch fled.<BR>
And R&aacute;van with his spirit wrought<BR>
To frenzy by the tale they brought,<BR>
Urged to the fight Prahasta's son,<BR>
Of all his chiefs the mightiest one.<BR>
