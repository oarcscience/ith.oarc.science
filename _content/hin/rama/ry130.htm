<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LII.: THE CROSSING OF GANG&Aacute;.</H3>
<P>
Soon as the shades of night had fled,<BR>
Uprising from his lowly bed,<BR>
R&aacute;ma the famous, broad of chest,<BR>
His brother Lakshman thus addressed:<BR>
'Now swift upsprings the Lord of Light,<BR>
And fled, is venerable night,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
That dark-winged bird the Ko&iuml;l now<BR>
Is calling from the topmost bough,<BR>
And sounding from the thicket nigh<BR>
Is heard the peacock's early cry,<BR>
Come, cross the flood that seeks the sea,<BR>
The swiftly flowing J&aacute;hnav&iacute;.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  King Guha heard his speech, agreed,<BR>
And called his minister with speed:<BR>
'A boat,' he cried, 'swift, strong, and fair,<BR>
With rudder, oars, and men, prepare,<BR>
And place it ready by the shore<BR>
To bear the pilgrims quickly o'er.'<BR>
Thus Guha spake: his followers all<BR>
Bestirred them at their master's call;<BR>
Then told the king that ready manned<BR>
A gay boat waited near the strand.<BR>
Then Guha, hand to hand applied.<BR>
With reverence thus to R&aacute;ma cried:<BR>
'The boat is ready by the shore:<BR>
How, tell me, can I aid thee more?<BR>
O lord of men, it waits for thee<BR>
To cross the flood that seeks the sea,<BR>
O godlike keeper of thy vow,<BR>
Embark: the boat is ready now.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma, lord of glory high,<BR>
Thus to King Guha. made reply:<BR>
'Thanks for thy gracious care, my lord:<BR>
Now let the gear be placed on board.'<BR>
Each bow-armed chief, in mail encased,<BR>
Bound sword and quiver to his waist,<BR>
And then with S&iacute;t&aacute; near them hied<BR>
Down the broad river's shelving side.<BR>
Then with raised palms the charioteer,<BR>
In lowly reverence drawing near,<BR>
Cried thus to R&aacute;ma good and true:<BR>
'Now what remains for me to do?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With his right hand, while answering<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The hero touched his friend:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Go back,' he said, 'and on the king<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With watchful care attend.<BR>
Thus far, Sumantra, thou wast guide;<BR>
Now to Ayodhy&aacute; turn,' he cried:<BR>
'Hence seek we leaving steeds and car,<BR>
On foot the wood that stretches far.'<BR>

<P>
Sumantra, when, with grieving heart,<BR>
He heard the hero bid him part,<BR>
Thus to the bravest of the brave,<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's son, his answer gave:<BR>
'In all the world men tell of naught,<BR>
To match thy deed, by heroes wrought--<BR>
Thus with thy brother and thy wife<BR>
Thrall-like to lead a forest life.<BR>
No meet reward of fruit repays<BR>
Thy holy lore, thy saintlike days,<BR>
Thy tender soul, thy love of truth,<BR>
If woe like this afflicts thy youth.<BR>
Thou, roaming under forest boughs<BR>


<P>


<P>
With thy dear brother and thy spouse<BR>
Shalt richer meed of glory gain<BR>
Than if three worlds confessed thy reign.<BR>
Sad is our fate, O R&aacute;ma: we,<BR>
Abandoned and repelled by thee,<BR>
Must serve as thralls Kaikey&iacute;'s will,<BR>
Imperious, wicked, born to ill.'<BR>

<P>
Thus cried the faithful charioteer,<BR>
As Raghu's son, in rede his peer,<BR>
Was fast departing on his road,--<BR>
And long his tears of anguish flowed.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma, when those tears were dried<BR>
His lips with water purified,<BR>
And in soft accents, sweet and clear,<BR>
Again addressed the charioteer:<BR>
'I find no heart, my friend, like thine,<BR>
So faithful to Ikshv&aacute;ku's line.<BR>
Still first in view this object keep,<BR>
That ne'er for me my sire may weep.<BR>
For he, the world's far-ruling king,<BR>
Is old, and wild with sorrow's sting;<BR>
With love's great burthen worn and weak:<BR>
Deem this the cause that thus I speak<BR>
Whate'er the high-souled king decrees<BR>
His loved Kaikey&iacute;'s heart to please,<BR>
Yea, be his order what it may,<BR>
Without demur thou must obey,<BR>
For this alone great monarchs reign,<BR>
That ne'er a wish be formed in vain.<BR>
Then, O Sumantra, well provide<BR>
That by no check the king be tried:<BR>
Nor let his heart in sorrow pine:<BR>
This care, my faithful friend, be thine<BR>
The honoured king my father greet,<BR>
And thus for me my words repeat<BR>
To him whose senses are controlled,<BR>
Untired till now by grief, and old;<BR>

<P>
I, S&iacute;t&aacute;, Lakshman sorrow not,<BR>
O Monarch, for our altered lot:<BR>
The same to us, if here we roam,<BR>
Or if Ayodhy&aacute; be our home,<BR>
The fourteen years will quickly fly,<BR>
The happy hour will soon be nigh<BR>
When thou, my lord, again shalt see<BR>
Lakshman, the Maithl&iacute; dame, and me.<BR>
Thus having soothed, O charioteer,<BR>
My father and my mother dear,<BR>
Let all the queens my message learn.<BR>
But to Kaikey&iacute; chiefly turn,<BR>
With loving blessings from the three,<BR>
From Lakshman, S&iacute;t&aacute;, and from me,<BR>
My mother, Queen Kausaly&aacute;, greet<BR>
With reverence to her sacred feet.<BR>
And add this prayer of mine: 'O King;<BR>
Send quickly forth and Bharat bring,<BR>
And set him on the royal throne<BR>
Which thy decree has made his own.<BR>
When he upon the throne is placed,<BR>
When thy fond arms are round him laced.<BR>
Thine aged heart will cease to ache<BR>
With bitter pangs for R&aacute;ma's sake.'<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And say to Bharat: 'See thou treat<BR>
The queens with all observance meet:<BR>
What care the king receives, the same<BR>
Show thou alike to every dame.<BR>
Obedience to thy father's will<BR>
Who chooses thee the throne to fill,<BR>
Will earn for thee a store of bliss<BR>
Both in the world to come and this.'<BR>

<P>
Thus R&aacute;ma bade Sumantra go<BR>
With thoughtful care instructed so.<BR>
Sumantra all his message heard,<BR>
And spake again, by passion stirred:<BR>
'O, should deep feeling mar in aught<BR>
The speech by fond devotion taught,<BR>
Forgive whate'er I wildly speak:<BR>
My love is strong, my tongue is weak.<BR>
How shall I, if deprived of thee,<BR>
Return that mournful town to see:<BR>
Where sick at heart the people are<BR>
Because their R&aacute;ma roams afar.<BR>
Woe will be theirs too deep to brook<BR>
When on the empty car they look,<BR>
As when from hosts, whose chiefs are slain,<BR>
One charioteer comes home again.<BR>
This very day, I ween, is food<BR>
Forsworn by all the multitude,<BR>
Thinking that thou, with hosts to aid,<BR>
Art dwelling in the wild wood's shade.<BR>
The great despair, the shriek of woe<BR>
They uttered when they saw thee go.<BR>
Will, when I come with none beside,<BR>
A hundred-fold be multiplied.<BR>
How to Kaus'aly&aacute; can I say:<BR>
'O Queen, I took thy son away,<BR>
And with thy brother left him well:<BR>
Weep not for him; thy woe dispel?'<BR>
So false a tale I cannot frame,<BR>
Yet how speak truth and grieve the dame?<BR>
How shall these horses, fleet and bold,<BR>
Whom not a hand but mine can hold,<BR>
Bear others, wont to whirl the car<BR>
Wherein Ikshv&aacute;ku's children are!<BR>
Without thee, Prince, I cannot, no,<BR>
I cannot to Ayodhy&aacute; go.<BR>
Then deign, O R&aacute;ma, to relent,<BR>
And let me share thy banishment.<BR>
But if no prayers can move thy heart,<BR>
If thou wilt quit me and depart,<BR>
The flames shall end my car and me,<BR>
Deserted thus and reft of thee.<BR>
In the wild wood when foes are near,<BR>
When dangers check thy vows austere,<BR>
Borne in my car will I attend.<BR>
All danger and all care to end.<BR>
For thy dear sake I love the skill<BR>
That guides the steed and curbs his will:<BR>
And soon a forest life will be<BR>
As pleasant, for my love of thee.<BR>
And if these horses near thee dwell,<BR>
And serve thee in the forest well,<BR>
They, for their service, will not miss<BR>
The due reward of highest bliss.<BR>
Thine orders, as with thee I stray.<BR>
Will I with heart and head obey,<BR>
Prepared, for thee, without a sigh,<BR>
To lose Ayodhy&aacute; or the sky.<BR>
As one denied with hideous sin,<BR>
I never more can pass within<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;, city of our king,<BR>
Unless beside me thee I bring.<BR>
One wish is mine, I ask no more,<BR>
That, when thy banishment is o'er<BR>
I in my car may bear my lord,<BR>
Triumphant, to his home restored.<BR>
The fourteen years, if spent with thee.<BR>
Will swift as light-winged moments flee;<BR>
But the same years, without thee told,<BR>
Were magnified a hundred-fold.<BR>
Do not, kind lord, thy servant leave,<BR>
Who to his master's son would cleave,<BR>
And the same path with him pursue,<BR>
Devoted, tender, just and true.'<BR>

<P>
Again, again Sumantra made<BR>
His varied plaint, and wept and prayed.<BR>
Him Raghu's son, whose tender breast<BR>
Felt for his servants, thus addressed:<BR>
O faithful servant, well my heart<BR>
Knows how attached and true thou art.<BR>
Hear thou the words I speak, and know<BR>
Why to the town I bid thee go.<BR>
Soon as Kaikey&iacute;, youngest queen,<BR>
Thy coming to the town has seen,<BR>
No doubt will then her mind oppress<BR>
That R&aacute;ma roams the wilderness.<BR>
And so the dame, her heart content<BR>
With proof of R&aacute;ma's banishment.<BR>
Will doubt the virtuous king no more<BR>
As faithless to the oath he swore.<BR>
Chief of my cares is this, that she,<BR>
Youngest amid the queens, may see<BR>
Bharat her son securely reign<BR>
O'er rich Ayodhy&aacute;'s wide domain.<BR>
For mine and for the monarch's sake<BR>
Do thou thy journey homeward take,<BR>
And, as I bade, repeat each word<BR>
That from my lips thou here hast heard.'<BR>

<P>
Thus spake the prince, and strove to cheer<BR>
The sad heart of the charioteer,<BR>
And then to royal Guha said<BR>
These words most wise and spirited:<BR>
'Guha, dear friend, it is not meet<BR>
That people throng my calm retreat:<BR>
For I must live a strict recluse,<BR>
And mould my life by hermits' use.<BR>
I now the ancient rule accept<BR>
By good ascetics gladly kept.<BR>
I go: bring fig-tree juice that I<BR>
In matted coils my hair may tie.'<BR>

<P>
Quick Guha hastened to produce,<BR>
For the king's son, that sacred juice.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma of his long locks made,<BR>
And Lakshman's too, the hermit braid.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And the two royal brothers there<BR>
With coats of bark and matted hair,<BR>
Transformed in lovely likeness stood<BR>
To hermit saints who love the wood.<BR>
So R&aacute;ma, with his brother bold,<BR>
A pious anchorite enrolled,<BR>
Obeyed the vow which hermits take,<BR>
And to his friend, King Guha, spake:<BR>
'May people, treasure, army share,<BR>
And fenced forts, thy constant care:<BR>
Attend to all: supremely hard<BR>
The sovereign's task, to watch and guard.'<BR>

<P>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's son, the good and brave,<BR>
This last farewell to Guha gave,<BR>
And then, with Lakshman and his bride,<BR>
Determined, on his way he hied.<BR>
Soon as he viewed, upon the shore,<BR>
The bark prepared to waft them o'er<BR>
Impetuous Gang&aacute;'s rolling tide,<BR>
To Lakshman thus the chieftain cried:<BR>
'Brother, embark; thy hand extend,<BR>
Thy gentle aid to S&iacute;t&aacute; lend:<BR>
With care her trembling footsteps guide,<BR>
And place the lady by thy side.'<BR>
When Lakshman heard, prepared to aid<BR>
His brother's words he swift obeyed.<BR>
Within the bark he placed the dame,<BR>
Then to her side the hero came.<BR>
Next Lakshman's elder brother, lord<BR>
Of brightest glory, when on board,<BR>
Breathing a prayer for blessings, meet<BR>
For priest or warrior to repeat,<BR>
Then he and car-borne Lakshman bent,<BR>
Well-pleased, their heads, most reverent,<BR>
Their hands, with S&iacute;t&aacute;, having dipped,<BR>
As Scripture bids, and water sipped,<BR>
Farewell to wise Sumantra said,<BR>
And Guha, with the train he led.<BR>
So R&aacute;ma took, on board, his stand,<BR>
And urged the vessel from the land.<BR>
Then swift by vigorous arms impelled<BR>
Her onward course the vessel held,<BR>
And guided by the helmsman through<BR>
The dashing waves of Gang&aacute; flew.<BR>
Half way across the flood they came,<BR>
When S&iacute;t&aacute;, free from spot and blame,<BR>
Her reverent hands together pressed,<BR>
The Goddess of the stream addressed:<BR>
'May the great chieftain here who springs<BR>
From Das'aratha, best of kings,<BR>
Protected by thy care, fulfil<BR>
His prudent father's royal will.<BR>
When in the forest he has spent<BR>
His fourteen years of banishment,<BR>
With his dear brother and with me<BR>
His home again my lord shall see,<BR>
Returning on that blissful day.<BR>
I will to thee mine offerings pay,<BR>
Dear Queen, whose waters gently flow,<BR>
Who canst all blessed gifts bestow.<BR>
For, three-pathed Queen, though wandering here,<BR>
Thy waves descend from Brahm&aacute;'s sphere,<BR>
Spouse of the God o'er floods supreme,<BR>
Though rolling here thy glorious stream.<BR>
To thee, fair Queen, my head shall bend,<BR>
To thee shall hymns of praise ascend,<BR>
When my brave lord shall turn again,<BR>
And, joyful, o'er his kingdom reign.<BR>
To win thy grace, O Queen divine,<BR>
A hundred thousand fairest kine,<BR>
And precious robes and finest meal<BR>
Among the Br&aacute;hmans will I deal.<BR>
A hundred jars of wine shall flow,<BR>
When to my home, O Queen, I go;<BR>
With these, and flesh, and corn, and rice,<BR>
Will I, delighted, sacrifice.<BR>
Each hallowed spot, each holy shrine<BR>
That stands on these fair shores of thine,<BR>
Each fane and altar on thy banks<BR>
Shall share my offerings and thanks.<BR>
With me and Lakshman, free from harm,<BR>
May he the blameless, strong of arm,<BR>
Reseek Ayodhy&aacute; from the wild,<BR>
O blameless Lady undefiled!'<BR>

<P>
As, praying for her husband's sake,<BR>
The faultless dame to Gang&aacute; spake,<BR>
To the right bank the vessel flew<BR>
With her whose heart was right and true.<BR>
Soon as the bark had crossed the wave,<BR>
The lion leader of the brave,<BR>
Leaving the vessel on the strand,<BR>
With wife and brother leapt to land.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma thus the prince addressed<BR>
Who filled with joy Sumitr&aacute;'s breast:<BR>
'Be thine alike to guard and aid<BR>
In peopled spot, in lonely shade.<BR>
Do thou, Sumitr&aacute;'s son, precede:<BR>
Let S&iacute;t&aacute; walk where thou shalt lead.<BR>
Behind you both my place shall be,<BR>
To guard the Maithil dame and thee.<BR>
For she, to woe a stranger yet,<BR>
No toil or grief till now has met;<BR>
The fair Videhan will assay<BR>
The pains of forest life to-day.<BR>
To-day her tender feet must tread<BR>
Rough rocky wilds around her spread:<BR>
No tilth is there, no gardens grow,<BR>
No crowding people come and go.'<BR>

<P>
The hero ceased: and Lakshman led<BR>
Obedient to the words he said:<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; followed him, and then<BR>
Came Raghu's pride, the lord of men.<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; walking o'er the sand<BR>
They sought the forest, bow in hand,<BR>
But still their lingering glances threw<BR>
Where yet Sumantra stood in view.<BR>
Sumantra, when his watchful eye<BR>
The royal youths no more could spy,<BR>
Turned from the spot whereon he stood<BR>
Homeward with Guha from the wood.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Still on the brothers forced their way<BR>
Where sweet birds sang on every spray,<BR>
Though scarce the eye a path could find<BR>
Mid flowering trees where creepers twined<BR>
Far on the princely brothers pressed,<BR>
And stayed their feet at length to rest<BR>
Beneath a fig tree's mighty shade<BR>
With countless pendent shoots displayed.<BR>
Reclining there a while at ease,<BR>
They saw, not far, beneath fair trees<BR>
A lake with many a lotus bright<BR>
That bore the name of Lovely Sight.<BR>
R&aacute;ma his wife's attention drew,<BR>
And Lakshman's, to the charming view:<BR>
'Look, brother, look how fair the flood<BR>
Glows with the lotus, flower and bud.'<BR>

<P>
They drank the water fresh and clear,<BR>
And with their shafts they slew a deer.<BR>
A fire of boughs they made in haste,<BR>
And in the flame the meat they placed.<BR>
So Raghu's sons with S&iacute;t&aacute; shared<BR>
The hunter's meal their hands prepared,<BR>
Then counselled that the spreading tree<BR>
Their shelter and their home should be.<BR>
