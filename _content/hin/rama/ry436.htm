<P>
Lords of the legions of the wood,<BR>
The chieftains with Vibh&iacute;shan stood,<BR>
And, strangers in the foeman's land,<BR>
Their hopes and fears in council scanned:<BR>
'See, see where Lank&aacute;'s towers ascend,<BR>
Which R&aacute;van's power and might defend,<BR>
Which Gods, Gandharvas, fiends would fail<BR>
To conquer, if they durst assail.<BR>
How shall our legions pass within,<BR>
The city of the foe to win,<BR>
With massive walls and portals barred<BR>
Which R&aacute;van keeps with surest guard?'<BR>
With anxious looks the walls they eyed:<BR>
And sage Vibh&iacute;shan thus replied:<BR>
'These lords of mine &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_956"></A><A HREF="#fn_956"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> can answer: they<BR>
Within the walls have found their way,<BR>
The foeman's plan and order learned,<BR>
And hither to my side returned.<BR>
Now, R&aacute;ma, let my tongue declare<BR>
How R&aacute;van's hosts are stationed there.<BR>
Prahasta heads, in warlike state,<BR>
His legions at the eastern gate.<BR>
To guard the southern portal stands<BR>
Mahodar, girt by R&aacute;kshas bands,<BR>
Where mighty Mah&aacute;p&aacute;rs'va, sent<BR>
By R&aacute;van's hest, his aid has lent.<BR>
Guard of the gate that fronts the west<BR>
Is valiant Indrajit, the best<BR>
Of warriors, R&aacute;van's joy and pride;<BR>
And by the youthful chieftain's side<BR>
Are giants, armed for fierce attacks<BR>
With sword and mace and battle-axe.<BR>
North, where approach is dreaded most,<BR>
The king, encompassed with a host<BR>
Of giants trained in war, whose hands<BR>
Wield maces, swords and lances, stands.<BR>

<P>
All these are chiefs whom R&aacute;van chose<BR>
As mightiest to resist his foes;<BR>
And each a countless army &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_957"></A><A HREF="ry437.htm#fn_957"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> leads<BR>
With elephants and cars and steeds.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma, while his spirit burned<BR>
For battle, words like these returned:<BR>
'The eastern gate be N&iacute;la's care.<BR>
Opponent of Prahasta there.<BR>
The southern gate, with troops arrayed<BR>
Let Angad, B&aacute;li's son, invade.<BR>
The gate that fronts the falling sun<BR>
Shall be by brave Han&uacute;m&aacute;n won;<BR>
Soon through its portals shall he lead<BR>
His myriads of V&aacute;nar breed.<BR>
The gate that fronts the north shall be<BR>
Assailed by Lakshman and by me.<BR>
For I myself have sworn to kill<BR>
The tyrant who delights in ill.<BR>
Armed with the boon which Brahm&aacute; gave,<BR>
The Gods of heaven he loves to brave.<BR>
And through the trembling worlds he flies,<BR>
Oppressor of the just and wise.<BR>
Thou, J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n, and thou, O King<BR>
Of V&aacute;nars, all your bravest bring,<BR>
And with your hosts in dense array<BR>
Straight to the centre force your way.<BR>
But let no V&aacute;nar in the storm<BR>
Disguise him in a human form.<BR>
Ye chiefs who change your shapes at will,<BR>
Retain your V&aacute;nar semblance still.<BR>
Thus, when we battle with the foe,<BR>
Both men and V&aacute;nars will ye know,<BR>
In human form will seven appear;<BR>
Myself, my brother Lakshman here;<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan, and the four he led<BR>
From Lank&aacute;'s city when he fled.'<BR>

<P>
Thus Raghu's son the chiefs addressed:<BR>
Then, gazing on Suvela's crest,<BR>
Transported by the lovely sight,<BR>
He longed to climb the mountain height.<BR>
