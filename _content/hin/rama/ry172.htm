<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XCIV.: CHITRAK&Uacute;TA.</H3>
<P>
There long the son of Raghu dwelt<BR>
And love for hill and wood he felt.<BR>
Then his Videhan spouse to please<BR>
And his own heart of woe to ease,<BR>
Like some Immortal--Indra so<BR>
Might Swarga's charms to S'achi show--<BR>
Drew her sweet eyes to each delight<BR>
Of Chitrak&uacute;ta's lovely height:<BR>
'Though reft of power and kingly sway,<BR>
Though friends and home are far away,<BR>
I cannot mourn my altered lot,<BR>
Enamoured of this charming spot.<BR>
Look, darling, on this noble hill<BR>
Which sweet birds with their music fill.<BR>
Bright with a thousand metal dyes<BR>
His lofty summits cleave the skies.<BR>
See, there a silvery sheen is spread,<BR>
And there like blood the rooks are red.<BR>
There shows a streak of emerald green,<BR>
And pink and yellow glow between.<BR>
There where the higher peaks ascend,<BR>
Crystal and flowers and topaz blend.<BR>
And others flash their light afar<BR>
Like mercury or some fair star:<BR>
With such a store of metals dyed<BR>
The king of hills is glorified.<BR>
There through the wild birds' populous home<BR>
The harmless bear and tiger roam:<BR>
Hyaenas range the woody slopes<BR>
With herds of deer and antelopes.<BR>
See, love, the trees that clothe his side<BR>
All lovely in their summer pride,<BR>
In richest wealth of leaves arrayed,<BR>
With flower and fruit and light and shade,<BR>
Look where the young Rose-apple glows;<BR>
What loaded boughs the Mango shows;<BR>
See, waving in the western wind<BR>
The light leaves of the Tamarind,<BR>
And mark that giant Peepul through<BR>
The feathery clump of tall bamboo. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

Look, on the level lands above,<BR>
Delighting in successful love<BR>
In sweet enjoyment many a pair<BR>
Of heavenly minstrels revels there,<BR>
While overhanging boughs support<BR>
Their swords and mantles as they sport:<BR>
Then see that pleasant shelter where<BR>
Play the bright Daughters of the Air.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The mountain seems with bright cascade<BR>
And sweet rill bursting from the shade,<BR>
Like some majestic elephant o'er<BR>
Whose burning head the torrents pour.<BR>
Where breathes the man who would not feel<BR>
Delicious languor o'er him steal,<BR>
As the young morning breeze that springs<BR>
From the cool cave with balmy wings,<BR>
Breathes round him laden with the scent<BR>
Of bud and blossom dew-besprent?<BR>
If many autumns here I spent<BR>
With thee, my darling innocent;<BR>
And Lakshman, I should never know<BR>
The torture of the fires of woe,<BR>
This varied scene so charms my sight,<BR>
This mount so fills me with delight,<BR>
Where flowers in wild profusion spring,<BR>
And ripe fruits glow and sweet birds sing.<BR>
My beauteous one, a double good<BR>
Springs from my dwelling in the wood:<BR>
Loosed is the bond my sire that tied<BR>
And Bharat too is gratified.<BR>
My darling, dost thou feel with me<BR>
Delight from every charm we see,<BR>
Of which the mind and every sense<BR>
Feel the enchanting influence?<BR>
My fathers who have passed away,<BR>
The royal saints, were wont to say<BR>

<P>


<P>
That life in woodland shades like this<BR>
Secures a king immortal bliss.<BR>
See, round the hill at random thrown.<BR>
Huge masses lie of rugged stone<BR>
Of every shape and many a hue,<BR>
Yellow and white and red and blue.<BR>
But all is fairer still by night:<BR>
Each rock reflects a softer light,<BR>
When the whole mount from foot to crest<BR>
In robes of lambent flame is dressed;<BR>
When from a million herbs a blaze<BR>
Of their own luminous glory plays,<BR>
And clothed in fire each deep ravine,<BR>
Each pinnacle and crag is seen.<BR>
Some parts the look of mansions wear,<BR>
And others are as gardens fair,<BR>
While others seem a massive block<BR>
Of solid undivided rock.<BR>
Behold those pleasant beds o'erlaid<BR>
With lotus leaves, for lovers made,<BR>
Where mountain birch and *costus throw<BR>
Cool shadows on the pair below.<BR>
See where the lovers in their play<BR>
Have cast their flowery wreaths away,<BR>
And fruit and lotus buds that crowned<BR>
Their brows lie trodden on the ground.<BR>
North Kuru's realm is fair to see,<BR>
Vasvaukas&aacute;r&aacute;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="ry173.htm#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> Nalin&iacute;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="ry173.htm#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
But rich in fruit and blossom still<BR>
More fair is Chitrak&uacute;ta's hill.<BR>
Here shall the years appointed glide<BR>
With thee, my beauty, by my side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And Lakshman ever near;<BR>
Here shall I live in all delight,<BR>
Make my ancestral fame more bright,<BR>
Tread in their path who walk aright,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And to my oath adhere.'<BR>
