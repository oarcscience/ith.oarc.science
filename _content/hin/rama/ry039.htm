<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXIX.: THE SONS OF SAGAR.</H3>
<P>
The saint in accents sweet and clear<BR>
Thus told his tale for R&aacute;ma's ear,<BR>
And thus anew the holy man<BR>
A legend to the prince began:<BR>
'There reigned a pious monarch o'er<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute; in the days of yore:<BR>
Sagar his name: no child bad he,<BR>
And children much he longed to see.<BR>
His honoured consort, fair of face,<BR>
Sprang from Vidarbha's royal race,<BR>
Kes'ini, famed from early youth<BR>
For piety and love of truth.<BR>
Arishtanemi's daughter fair,<BR>
With whom no maiden might compare<BR>
In beauty, though the earth is wide,<BR>
Sumati, was his second bride.<BR>
With his two queens afar he went,<BR>
And weary days in penance spent,<BR>
Fervent, upon Him&aacute;laya's hill<BR>
Where springs the stream called Bhrigu' rill.<BR>
Nor did he fail that saint to please<BR>
With his devout austerities,<BR>
And, when a hundred years had fled,<BR>
Thus the most truthful Bhrigu said:<BR>
'From thee, O Sagar, blameless King,<BR>
A mighty host of sons shall spring,<BR>
And thou shalt win a glorious name<BR>
Which none, O Chief, but thou shall claim.<BR>
One of thy queens a son shall bear,<BR>
Maintainer of thy race and heir;<BR>
And of the other there shall be<BR>
Sons sixty thousand born to thee.'<BR>

<P>
Thus as he spake, with one accord,<BR>
To win the grace of that high lord,<BR>
The queens, with palms together laid,<BR>
In humble supplication prayed:<BR>
'Which queen, O Br&aacute;hman, of the pair,<BR>
The many, or the one shall bear?<BR>
Most eager, Lord, are we to know,<BR>
And as thou sayest be it so.'<BR>

With his sweet speech the saint replied:<BR>
'Yourselves, O Queens, the choice decide.<BR>
Your own discretion freely use<BR>
Which shall the one or many choose:<BR>
One shall the race and name uphold,<BR>
The host be famous, strong, and bold.<BR>
Which will have which?' Then Kes'in&icirc;<BR>
The mother of one heir would be.<BR>
Sumati, sister of the king &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="ry040.htm#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Of all the birds that ply the wing,<BR>
To that illustrious Br&aacute;hman sued<BR>
That she might bear the multitude<BR>
Whose fame throughout the world should sound<BR>
For mighty enterprise renowned.<BR>
Around the saint the monarch went,<BR>
Bowing his head, most reverent.<BR>
Then with his wives, with willing feet,<BR>
Besought his own imperial seat.<BR>
Time passed. The elder consort bare<BR>
A son called Asamanj, the heir.<BR>
Then Sumati, the younger, gave<BR>
Birth to a gourd, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="ry040.htm#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> O hero brave,<BR>
Whose rind, when burst and cleft in two,<BR>
Gave sixty thousand babes to view.<BR>
All these with care the nurses laid<BR>
In jars of oil; and there they stayed,<BR>
Till, youthful age and strength complete,<BR>
Forth speeding from each dark retreat,<BR>
All peers in valour, years, and might,<BR>
The sixty thousand came to light.<BR>
Prince Asamanj, brought up with care,<BR>
Scourge of his foes, was made the heir.<BR>
But liegemen's boys he used to cast<BR>
To Sarj&ucirc;'s waves that hurried past,<BR>
Laughing the while in cruel glee<BR>
Their dying agonies to see.<BR>
This wicked prince who aye withstood<BR>
The counsel of the wise and good,<BR>
Who plagued the people in his hate,<BR>
His father banished from the state.<BR>
His son, kind-spoken, brave, and tall,<BR>
Was Ans'uman, beloved of all.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Long years flew by. The king decreed<BR>
To slay a sacrificial steed.<BR>
Consulting with his priestly band<BR>
He vowed the rite his soul had planned,<BR>
And, Veda skilled, by their advice<BR>
Made ready for the sacrifice.<BR>
