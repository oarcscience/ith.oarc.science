<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LV.: THE PASSAGE OF YAMUN&Aacute;.</H3>
<P>
The princely tamers of their foes<BR>
Thus passed the night in calm repose,<BR>
Then to the hermit having bent<BR>
With reverence, on their way they went.<BR>
High favour Rharadv&aacute;ja showed.<BR>
And blessed them ready for the road.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
With such fond looks as fathers throw<BR>
On their own sons, before they go.<BR>
Then spake the saint with glory bright<BR>
To R&aacute;ma peerless in his might:<BR>
'First, lords of men, direct your feet<BR>
Where Yamuna' and Gang&aacute; meet;<BR>
Then to the swift Kalindi &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> go,<BR>
Whose westward waves to Gang&aacute; flow.<BR>
When thou shalt see her lovely shore<BR>
Worn by their feet who hasten o'er,<BR>
Then, Raghu's son, a raft prepare.<BR>
And cross the Sun born river there.<BR>
Upon her farther bank a tree,<BR>
Near to the landing wilt thou see.<BR>
The blessed source of varied gifts,<BR>
There her green boughs that Eig tree lifts:<BR>
A tree where countless birds abide,<BR>
Bv Sy&aacute;ma's name known far and wide.<BR>
Sit&aacute;, revere that holy shade:<BR>
There be thy prayers for blessing prayed.<BR>
Thence for a league your way pursue,<BR>
And a dark wood shall meet your view,<BR>
Where tall bamboos their foliage show,<BR>
The Gum tree and the Jujube grow.<BR>
To Chitrak&uacute;ta have I oft<BR>
Trodden that path so smooth and soft,<BR>
Where burning woods no traveller scare,<BR>
But all is pleasant, green, and fair.'<BR>

<P>
When thus the guests their road had learned,<BR>
Back to his cot the hermit turned,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, Lakshman, Sit&aacute; paid<BR>
Their reverent thanks for courteous aid.<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma spake to Lakshman, when<BR>
The saint had left the lords of men:<BR>
'Great store of bliss in sooth is ours<BR>
On whom his love the hermit showers.'<BR>
As each to other wisely talked,<BR>
The lion lords together walked<BR>
On to K&aacute;lindi's woody shore;<BR>
And gentle Sita went before.<BR>
They reached that flood, whose waters flee<BR>
With rapid current to the sea;<BR>
Their minds a while to thought they gave<BR>
And counselled how to cross the wave.<BR>
At length, with logs together laid,<BR>
A mighty raft the brothers made.<BR>
Then dry bamboos across were tied,<BR>
And grass was spread from side to side.<BR>
And the great hero Lakshman brought<BR>
Cane and Rose Apple boughs and wrought,<BR>
Trimming the branches smooth and neat,<BR>
For Sit&aacute;'s use a pleasant seat.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma placed thereon his dame<BR>
Touched with a momentary shame,<BR>
Resembling in her glorious mien<BR>
All thought surpassing Fortune's Queen<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma hastened to dispose.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Each in its place, the skins and bows,<BR>
And by the fair Videhan laid<BR>
The coats, the ornaments, and spade.<BR>
When Sit&aacute; thus was set on board,<BR>
And all their gear was duly stored,<BR>
The heroes each with vigorous hand,<BR>
Pushed off the raft and left the land.<BR>
When half its way the raft had made,<BR>
Thus Sit&aacute; to K&aacute;lindi prayed:<BR>
'Goddess, whose flood I traverse now,<BR>
Grant that my lord may keep his vow.<BR>
For thee shall bleed a thousand kine,<BR>
A hundred jars shall pour their wine,<BR>
When R&aacute;ma sees that town again<BR>
Where old Ikshv&aacute;ku's children reign."<BR>

<P>
Thus to K&aacute;lindi's stream she sued<BR>
And prayed in suppliant attitude.<BR>
Then to the river's bank the dame,<BR>
Fervent in supplication, came.<BR>
They left the raft that brought them o'er,<BR>
And the thick wood that clothed the shore,<BR>
And to the Fig-tree Syama made<BR>
Their way, so cool with verdant shade.<BR>
Then Sit&aacute; viewed that best of trees,<BR>
And reverent spake in words like these:<BR>
'Hail,hail, O mighty tree! Allow<BR>
My husband to complete his vow;<BR>
Let us returning, I entreat,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; and Sumitr&aacute; meet.'<BR>
Then with her hands together placed<BR>
Around the tree she duly paced.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma saw his blameless spouse<BR>
A suppliant under holy boughs,<BR>
The gentle darling of his heart,<BR>
He thus to Lakshman spake apart:<BR>
'Brother, by thee our way be led;<BR>
Let Sit&aacute; close behind thee tread:<BR>
I, best of men, will grasp my bow,<BR>
And hindmost of the three will go.<BR>
What fruits soe'er her fancy take,<BR>
Or flowers half hidden in the brake,<BR>
For Janak's child forget not thou<BR>
To gather from the brake or bough."<BR>

<P>
Thus on they fared. The tender dame<BR>
Asked R&aacute;ma, as they walked, the name<BR>
Of every shrub that blossoms bore,<BR>
Creeper, and tree unseen before:<BR>
And Lakshman fetched, at Sit&aacute;'s prayer,<BR>
Boughs of each tree with clusters fair.<BR>
Then Janak's daughter joyed to see<BR>
The sand-discoloured river flee,<BR>
Where the glad cry of many a bird,<BR>
The sa'ras and the swan, was heard.<BR>
A league the brothers travelled through<BR>
The forest noble game they slew:<BR>
Beneath the trees their meal they dressed<BR>
And sat them down to eat and rest.<BR>
A while in that delightful shade<BR>
Where elephants unnumbered strayed.<BR>
Where peacocks screamed and monkeys played.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They wandered with delight.<BR>
Then by the river's side they found<BR>
A pleaaant spot of level ground,<BR>
Where all was smooth and fair around,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Their lodging for the night.<BR>
