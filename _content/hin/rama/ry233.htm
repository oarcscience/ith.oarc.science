<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXV.: R&Aacute;VAN'S JOURNEY.</H3>
<P>
When R&aacute;van, by her fury spurred,<BR>
That terrible advice had heard,<BR>
He bade his nobles quit his side,<BR>
And to the work his thought applied.<BR>
He turned his anxious mind to scan<BR>
On every side the hardy plan:<BR>
The gain against the risk he laid,<BR>
Each hope and fear with care surveyed,<BR>
And in his heart at length decreed<BR>
To try performance of the deed.<BR>
Then steady in his dire intent<BR>
The giant to the courtyard went.<BR>
There to his charioteer he cried,<BR>
'Bring forth the car whereon I ride.'<BR>
Aye ready at his master's word<BR>
The charioteer the order heard.<BR>
And yoked with active zeal the best<BR>
Of chariots at his lord's behest.<BR>
Asses with heads of goblins drew<BR>
That wondrous car where'er it flew.<BR>
Obedient to the will it rolled<BR>
Adorned with gems and glistering gold.<BR>
Then mounting, with a roar as loud<BR>
As thunder from a labouring cloud,<BR>
The mighty monarch to the tide<BR>
Of Ocean, lord of rivers, hied.<BR>
White was the shade above him spread,<BR>
White chouris waved around his head,<BR>
And he with gold and jewels bright<BR>
Shone like the glossy lazulite.<BR>
Ten necks and twenty arms had he:<BR>
His royal gear was good to see.<BR>
The heavenly Gods' insatiate foe.<BR>
Who made the blood of hermits flow,<BR>
He like the Lord of Hills appeared<BR>
With ten huge heads to heaven upreared.<BR>
In the great car whereon he rode,<BR>
Like some dark cloud the giant showed,<BR>
When round it in their close array<BR>
The cranes 'mid wreaths of lightning play.<BR>
He looked, and saw, from realms of air,<BR>
The rocky shore of ocean, where<BR>
Unnumbered trees delightful grew<BR>
With flower and fiuit of every hue.<BR>
He looked on many a lilied pool<BR>
With silvery waters fresh and cool,<BR>
And shores like spacious altars meet<BR>
For holy hermits' lone retreat,<BR>
The graceful palm adorned the scene,<BR>
The plantain waved her glossy green,<BR>
Where grew the s&aacute;l and betel, there<BR>
On bending boughs the flowers were fair.<BR>
There hermits dwelt who tamed each sense<BR>
By strictest rule of abstinence:<BR>
Gandharvas, Kinnars,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> thronged the place,<BR>
N&aacute;gas and birds of heavenly race.<BR>
Bright minstrels of the ethereal quire,<BR>
And saints exempt from low desire,<BR>
With &Aacute;jas, sons of Brahm&aacute;'s line,<BR>
Mar&iacute;chipas of seed divine,<BR>
Vaikh&aacute;nasas and M&aacute;shas strayed,<BR>
And B&aacute;lakhilyas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in the shade.<BR>
The lovely nymphs of heaven were there,<BR>
Celestial wreaths confined their hair,<BR>
And to each form new grace was lent<BR>
By wealth of heavenly ornament.<BR>
Well skilled was each in play and dance<BR>
And gentle arts of dalliance.<BR>
The glorious wife of many a God<BR>
Those beautiful recesses trod,<BR>
There Gods and D&aacute;navs, all who eat<BR>
The food of heaven, rejoiced to meet.<BR>
The swan and S&aacute;ras thronged each bay<BR>
With curlews, ducks, and divers gay,<BR>
Where the sea spray rose soft and white<BR>
O'er rocks of glossy lazulite.<BR>
As his swift way the fiend pursued<BR>
Pale chariots of the Gods he viewed,<BR>
Bearing each lord whose rites austere<BR>
Had raised him to the heavenly sphere.<BR>
Thereon celestial garlands hung,<BR>
There music played and songs were sung.<BR>
Then bright Gandharvas met his view,<BR>
And heavenly nymphs, as on he flew.<BR>
He saw the sandal woods below,<BR>
And precious trees of odorous flow,<BR>
That to the air around them lent<BR>
Their riches of delightful scent;<BR>
Nor failed his roving eye to mark<BR>
Tall aloe trees in grove and park.<BR>
He looked on wood with cassias filled,<BR>
And plants which balmy sweets distilled,<BR>
Where her fair flowers the betel showed<BR>
And the bright pods of pepper glowed.<BR>
The pearls in many a silvery heap<BR>
Lay on the margin of the deep.<BR>
And grey rocks rose amid the red<BR>
Of coral washed from ocean's bed.<BR>

High soared the mountain peaks that bore<BR>
Treasures of gold and silver ore,<BR>
And leaping down the rocky walls<BR>
Came wild and glorious waterfalls.<BR>
Fair towns which grain and treasure held,<BR>
And dames who every gem excelled,<BR>
He saw outspread beneath him far,<BR>
With steed, and elephant, and car.<BR>
That ocean shore he viewed that showed<BR>
Fair as the blessed Gods' abode<BR>
Where cool delightful breezes played<BR>
O'er levels in the freshest shade.<BR>
He saw a fig-tree like a cloud<BR>
With mighty branches earthward bowed.<BR>
It stretched a hundred leagues and made<BR>
For hermit bands a welcome shade.<BR>
Thither the feathered king of yore<BR>
An elephant and tortoise bore,<BR>
And lighted on a bough to eat<BR>
The captives of his taloned feet.<BR>
The bough unable to sustain<BR>
The crushing weight and sudden strain,<BR>
Loaded with sprays and leaves of spring<BR>
Gave way beneath the feathered king.<BR>
Under the shadow of the tree<BR>
Dwelt man, a saint and devotee,<BR>
&Aacute;jas, the sons of Brahm&aacute;'s line,<BR>
M&aacute;shas Mar&iacute;chipas divine.<BR>
Vaikh&aacute;nasas, and all the race<BR>
Of B&aacute;lakhilyas loved the place.<BR>
But pitying their sad estate<BR>
The feathered monarch raised the weight<BR>
Of the huge bough, and bore away<BR>
The loosened load and captured prey.<BR>
A hundred leagues away he sped,<BR>
Then on his monstrous booty fed,<BR>
And with the bough he smote the lands<BR>
Where dwell the wild Nish&aacute;da bands.<BR>
High joy was his because his deed<BR>
From jeopardy the hermits freed.<BR>
That pride for great deliverance wrought<BR>
A double share of valour brought.<BR>
His soul conceived the high emprise<BR>
To snatch the Amrit from the skies.<BR>
He rent the nets of iron first,<BR>
Then through the jewel chamber burst,<BR>
And bore the drink of heaven away<BR>
That watched in Indra's palace lay.<BR>

<P>
Such was the hermit-sheltering tree<BR>
Which R&aacute;van turned his eye to see.<BR>
Still marked where Garud sought to rest,<BR>
The fig-tree bore the name of Blest.<BR>

<P>
When R&aacute;van stayed his chariot o'er<BR>
The ocean's heart-enchanting shore,<BR>
He saw a hermitage that stood<BR>
Sequestered in the holy wood.<BR>
He saw the fiend Mar&iacute;cha there<BR>
With deerskin garb, and matted hair<BR>
Coiled up in hermit guise, who spent<BR>
His days by rule most abstinent.<BR>
As guest and host are wont to meet,<BR>

<P>
They met within that lone retreat.<BR>
Before the king M&aacute;r&iacute;cha placed<BR>
Food never known to human taste.<BR>
He entertained his guest with meat<BR>
And gave him water for his feet,<BR>
And then addressed the giant king<BR>
With timely words of questioning:<BR>

<P>
'Lord, is "it well with thee, and well<BR>
With those in Lank&aacute;'s town who dwell?<BR>
What sudden thought, what urgent need<BR>
Has brought thee with impetuous speed?<BR>

<P>
The fiend M&aacute;r&iacute;cha thus addressed<BR>
R&aacute;van the king, his mighty guest,<BR>
And he, well skilled in arts that guide<BR>
The eloquent, in turn replied:<BR>
