<P>
Then slept the tamer of his foes<BR>
And spent the night in calm repose.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan came when morning broke,<BR>
And hailed the royal chief, and spoke:<BR>
'Here wait thee precious oil and scents,<BR>
And rich attire and ornaments.<BR>
The brimming urns are newly filled,<BR>
And women in their duty skilled,<BR>
With lotus-eyes, thy call attend,<BR>
Assistance at thy bath to lend.'<BR>
'Let others,' R&aacute;ma cried,'desire<BR>
These precious scents, this rich attire,<BR>
I heed not such delights as these,<BR>
For faithful Bharat, ill at ease,<BR>
Watching for me is keeping now<BR>
Far far away his rigorous vow.<BR>
By Bharat's side I long to stand,<BR>
I long to see my fatherland.<BR>

<P>
Far is Ayodhv&aacute;: long, alas,<BR>
The dreary road and hard to pass.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'One day,' Vibh&iacute;shan cried, 'one day<BR>
Shall bear thee o'er that length of way.<BR>
Is not the wondrous chariot mine,<BR>
Named Pushpak, wrought by hands divine.<BR>
The prize which R&aacute;van seized of old<BR>
Victorious o'er the God of Gold<BR>
This chariot, kept with utmost care,<BR>
Will waft thee through the fields of air,<BR>
And thou shalt light unwearied down<BR>
In fair Ayodhy&aacute;'s royal town.<BR>
But yet if aught that I have done<BR>
Has pleased thee well, O Raghu's son;<BR>
If still thou carest for thy friend,<BR>
Some little time in Lank&aacute; spend;<BR>
There after toil of battle rest<BR>
Within my halls an honoured guest.'<BR>
Again the son of Raghu spake:<BR>
'Thy life was perilled for my sake.<BR>
Thy counsel gave me priceless aid:<BR>
All honours have been richly paid.<BR>
Scarce can my love refuse, O best<BR>
Of giant kind, thy last request.<BR>
But still I yearn once more to see<BR>
My home and all most dear to me;<BR>
Nor can I brook one hour's delay:<BR>
Forgive me, speed me on my way.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: the magic car was brought,<BR>
Of yore by Vis'vakarm&aacute; wrought.<BR>
In sunlike sheen it flashed and blazed;<BR>
And Raghu's sons in wonder gazed.<BR>
