<P>
Two sages, holy saints, had he,<BR>
His ministers and priests to be:<BR>
Vasishtha, faithful to advise.<BR>
And V&aacute;madeva, Scripture-wise.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

Eight other lords around him stood,<BR>
All skilled to counsel, wise and good;<BR>
Jayanta, Vijay, Dhrishti bold<BR>
In fight, affairs of war controlled:<BR>
Siddh&aacute;rth and Arthas&aacute;dhak true<BR>
Watched o'er expense and revenue,<BR>
And Dharmap&aacute;l and wise A&#156;ok<BR>
Of right and law and justice spoke.<BR>
With these the sage Sumantra, skilled<BR>
To urge the car, high station filled.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  All these in knowledge duly trained<BR>
Each passion and each sense restrained:<BR>
With modest manners, nobly bred<BR>
Each plan and nod and look they read,<BR>
Upon their neighbours' good intent,<BR>
Most active and benevolent:<BR>
As sit the Vasus &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> round their king.<BR>
They sate around him counselling.<BR>
They ne'er in virtue's loftier pride<BR>
Another's lowly gifts decried.<BR>
In fair and seemly garb arrayed,<BR>
No weak uncertain plans they made.<BR>
Well skilled in business, fair and just,<BR>
They gained the people's love and trust,<BR>
And thus without oppression stored<BR>
The swelling treasury of their lord,<BR>
Bound in sweet friendship each to each,<BR>
They spoke kind thoughts in gentle speech.<BR>
They looked alike with equal eye<BR>
On every caste, on low and high.<BR>
Devoted to their king, they sought,<BR>
Ere his tongue spoke, to learn his thought.<BR>
And knew, as each occasion rose,<BR>
To bide their counsel or disclose.<BR>
In foreign land--or in their own<BR>
Whatever passed, to them was known.<BR>
By secret spies they timely knew<BR>
What men were doing or would do.<BR>
Skilled in the grounds of war and peace<BR>
They saw the monarch's state increase,<BR>
Watching his weal with conquering eye<BR>
That never let occasion by,<BR>
While nature lent her aid to bless<BR>
Their labours with unbought success.<BR>
Never for anger, lust, or gain,<BR>
Would they their lips with falsehood stain.<BR>
Inclined to mercy they could scan<BR>
The weakness and the strength of man.<BR>
They fairly judged both high and low,<BR>
And ne'er would wrong a guiltless foe;<BR>
Yet if a fault were proved, each one<BR>
Would punish e'en his own dear son.<BR>
But there and in the kingdom's bound<BR>
No thief or man impure was found:<BR>
None of loose life or evil fame,<BR>
No temper of another's dame.<BR>
Contented with their lot each caste<BR>

Calm days in blissful quiet passed;<BR>
And, all in fitting tasks employed,<BR>
Country and town deep rest enjoyed,<BR>
With these wise lords around his throne<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The monarch justly reigned,<BR>
And making every heart his own<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The love of all men gained.<BR>
With trusty agents, as beseems,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each distant realm he scanned,<BR>
As the sun visits with his beams<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each corner of the land.<BR>
Ne'er would he on a mightier foe<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With hostile troops advance,<BR>
Nor at an equal strike a blow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In war's delusive chance.<BR>
These lords in council bore their part<BR>
With ready brain and faithful heart,<BR>
With skill and knowledge, sense and tact,<BR>
Good to advise and bold to act.<BR>
And high and endless fame he won<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With these to guide his schemes,<BR>
As, risen in his might, the sun<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wins glory with his beams.<BR>
