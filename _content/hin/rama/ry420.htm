<P>
His hands in reverence R&aacute;ma raised<BR>
And southwared o'er the ocean gazed:<BR>
Then on the sacred grass that made<BR>
His lowly couch* his limbs* he laid,<BR>
His head on that strong arm reclined<BR>
Which Sit&aacute;, best of womankind,<BR>
Had loved in happier days to hold<BR>
With soft arms decked* with pearls and gold.<BR>
Then rising from his bed of grass,<BR>
'This day,' he cried, 'the host shall pass<BR>
Triumphant to the southern shore,<BR>
Or Ocean's self shall be no more *.'<BR>
Thus vowing in his constant breast<BR>
Again he turned him to his rest,<BR>
And there, his eyes in slumber closed,<BR>
Silent beside the sea reposed.<BR>
Thrice rose the Day-God thrice he set,<BR>
The lord of Ocean came not yet,<BR>
Thrice came the night, but Raghu's son<BR>
No answer by his service won.<BR>
To Lakshman thus the hero cried,<BR>
His eyes aflame with wrath and pride:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'In vain the softer gifts that grace<BR>
The good are offered to the base.  *<BR>
Long-suffering, patience, gentle speech<BR>

<P>
Their thankless hearts can never reach.<BR>
The world to him its honour pays<BR>
Whose ready tongue himself can praise.<BR>
Who scorns the true, and hates the right,<BR>
Whose hand is ever raised to smite.<BR>
Each milder art is tried in vain:<BR>
It wins no glory, but disdain.<BR>
And victory owns no softer charm<BR>
Than might which nerves a warrior's arm.<BR>
My humble suit is still denied<BR>
By Ocean's overweening pride.<BR>
This day the monsters of the deep<BR>
In throes of death shall wildly leap.<BR>
My shafts shall rend the serpents curled<BR>
In caverns of the watery world,<BR>
Disclose each sunless depth and bare<BR>
The tangled pearl and coral there.<BR>
Away with mercy! at a time<BR>
Like this compassion is a crime.<BR>
Welcom, the battle and the foe! <BR>
My bow! my arrows and my bow!<BR>
This day the V&aacute;nars' feet shall tread<BR>
The conquered Sea's exhausted bed,<BR>
And he who never feared before<BR>
Shall tremble to his farthest shore."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Red flashed his eyes with angry glow;<BR>
He stood and grasped his mighty bow,<BR>
Terrific as the fire of doom<BR>
Whose quenchless flames the world consume.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His clanging cord the archer drew.<BR>
And swift the fiery arrows flew<BR>
Fierce as the flashing levin sent<BR>
By him who rules the firmament.<BR>
Down through the startled waters sped<BR>
Each missile with its flaming head.<BR>
The foamy billows rose and sank,<BR>
And dashed upon the trembling bank<BR>
Sea monsters of tremendous form<BR>
With crash and roar of thunder storm.<BR>
Still the wild waters rose and fell<BR>
Crowned with white foam and pearl and shell.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each serpent, startled from his rest,<BR>
Raised his fierce eyes and glowing crest.<BR>
And prisoned D&aacute;navs &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_943"></A><A HREF="#fn_943"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> where they dwelt<BR>
In depths below the terror felt.<BR>
Again upon his string he laid<BR>
A flaming shaft, but Lakshman stayed<BR>
His arm, with gentle reasoning tried<BR>
To soothe his angry mood, and cried:<BR>
'Brother, reflect: the wise control<BR>
The rising passions of the soul.<BR>
Let Ocean grant, without thy threat,<BR>
The boon on which thy heart is set.<BR>
That gracious lord will ne'er refuse<BR>
When R&aacute;ma son of Raghu sues.'<BR>
He ceased: and voices from the air<BR>
Fell clear and loud, Spare, R&aacute;ma, spare.<BR>
