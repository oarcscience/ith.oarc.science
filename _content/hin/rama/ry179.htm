<P>
Then Rama gazed, and scarcely knew<BR>
Bharat so worn and changed in hue.<BR>
He raised him, kissed him on the head,<BR>
Embraced him, and thus kindly said;<BR>
'Where was thy father, brother dear,<BR>
That thou art come to seek me here?<BR>
Unmeet, if he be living yet,<BR>
Thy feet within the wood to set.<BR>
I pray thee now the cause declare<BR>
Why thou hast left the kingdom there,<BR>
With matted locks and deerskin dress<BR>
To roam the distant wilderness.'<BR>

<P>
Thus questioned by the prince, at length<BR>
Kaikeyi's son regained his strength,<BR>
And hand to hand in reverence laid,<BR>
To Rama thus his answer made:<BR>
'The great-armed monarch, O my lard,<BR>
Has dared to do a thing abhorred,<BR>
Left us, and grieving for his son,<BR>
A home among the Gods has won.<BR>


<P>
My mother Queen Kaikeyf gave<BR>
The order to the king her slave,<BR>
And at the bidding of the dame<BR>
He wrought the sin which mars his fame.<BR>
Athirst for sway, her hopes are crossed,<BR>
She mourns her son, her husband lost,<BR>
And through her impious crime will go<BR>
For punishment to hell below.<BR>
Now O my lord, forgive me all;<BR>
Be gracious to thy lowly thrall:<BR>
Anointed king, accept to-day<BR>
Like Iudra's self, the royal sway.<BR>
Be gracious, Prince, to lord and peer,<BR>
And widowed queens who seek thee here<BR>
Accept the kingdom thine by right.<BR>
And so thy faithful friends delight.<BR>
Let the broad land no longer be<BR>
All widowed and forlorn of thee:<BR>
Let the full moon of autumn reign<BR>
Triumphant o'er the night again.<BR>
These lords and I before thee bend:<BR>
O Rama, to Our prayer attend.<BR>
O do not thou this grace deny:<BR>
Thy brother, pupil, slave am I.<BR>
Look on this venerable ring,<BR>
Advisers of our sire the king.<BR>
From age to age so honoured: thou<BR>
Shouldst grant their supplication now?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As weeping thus the hero prayed,<BR>
His head at Rama's feet he laid.<BR>
Like a mad elephant he sighed:<BR>
And Rama, gazed and thus replied:<BR>
'How, brother, Can a man of worth,<BR>
True to his vows, of noble birth-<BR>
A man like me, commit a sin<BR>
The lordship of the land to win?<BR>
No slightest shade of fault I see,<BR>
O tamer of thy foes, in thee.<BR>
But ne'er shouldst thou in childish thought<BR>
The queen thy mother blame in aught,<BR>
O brother wise and sinless, know<BR>
The sacred laws would have it so,<BR>
That from good wife and son require<BR>
Obedience to their lord and sire.<BR>
And we are all the king's, for thus<BR>
The virtuous ever reckon us:<BR>
Yea brother, be it known to thee,<BR>
His wives, and sons, and pupils we.<BR>
His is the right, if he deem fit,<BR>
To bid me, throned as monarch, sit,<BR>
Or in a coat of bark expel,<BR>
And deerskin, in the wood to dwell.<BR>
And O remember, best of all<BR>
Who act as claims of duty call,<BR>
As to a virtuous sire is due,<BR>
Such honour claims a mother too.<BR>
So they whose lives have ever been<BR>
By duty led, the king and queen,<BR>
Said,'Rama, seek the forest shade:'<BR>
And I (what could I else?) obeyed.<BR>
Thou must the royal power retain,<BR>

<P>
And o'er the famed Ayodhy&aacute; reign:<BR>
I dressed in bark my days will spent<BR>
Where Dandak'a forest wilds extend.<BR>
So Das'aratha spoke, our king,<BR>
His share to each apportioning<BR>
Before his honoured servants, eyes:<BR>
Then, heir of bliss, he sought the skies.<BR>
The righteous monarch's honoured will,<BR>
Whom all revered, must guide thee still,<BR>
And thou must still enjoy the share<BR>
Assigned thee by our father's care.<BR>
So I till twice seven years are spent<BR>
Will roam this wood in banishment,<BR>
Contented with the lot which he,<BR>
My high-souled sire, has given me.<BR>
The charge the monarch gave, endeared<BR>
To all mankind, by all revered,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Peer of the Lord Supreme,<BR>
Far better, richer far in gain<BR>
Of every blessing than to reign<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  O'er all the worlds I deem.'<BR>
