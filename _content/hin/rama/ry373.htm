<P>
Down from the tree Hanum&aacute;n came<BR>
And humbly stood before the dame.<BR>
Then joining reverent palm to palm<BR>
Addressed her thus with words of balm:<BR>
'Why should the tears of sorrow rise,<BR>
Sweet lady, to those lovely eyes,<BR>
As when the wind-swept river floods<BR>
Two half expanded lotus buds?<BR>
Who art thou, O most fair of face?<BR>
Of Asur,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_856"></A><A HREF="#fn_856"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or celestial race?<BR>
Did N&aacute;ga mother give thee birth?<BR>
For sure thou art no child of earth.<BR>
Do Rudras &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_857"></A><A HREF="#fn_857"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> claim that heavenly form?<BR>
Or the swift Gods &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_858"></A><A HREF="#fn_858"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> who ride the storm?<BR>
Or art thou Rohin&iacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_859"></A><A HREF="#fn_859"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the blest,<BR>
That star more lovely than the rest,--<BR>
Reft from the Moon thou lovest well<BR>
And doomed a while on earth to dwell?<BR>
Or canst thou, fairest wonder, be<BR>
The starry queen Arundhat&iacute;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_860"></A><A HREF="#fn_860"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><BR>
Fled in thy wrath or jealous pride<BR>
From her dear lord Vas'ishtha's side?<BR>
Who is the husband, father, son<BR>
Or brother, O thou loveliest one,<BR>
Gone from this world in heaven to dwell,<BR>
For whom those eyes with weeping swell?<BR>
Yet, by the tears those sweet eyes shed,<BR>
Yet, by the earth that bears thy tread,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_861"></A><A HREF="#fn_861"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A><BR>
By calling on a monarch's name,<BR>
No Goddess but a royal dame.<BR>
Art thou the queen, fair lady, say,<BR>
Whom R&aacute;van stole and bore away?<BR>
Yea, by that agony of woe,<BR>
That form unrivalled here below,<BR>
That votive garb, thou art, I ween,<BR>
King Janak's child and R&aacute;ma's queen.'<BR>

Hope at the name of R&aacute;ma woke,<BR>
And thus the gentle lady spoke:<BR>
'I am that S&iacute;t&aacute; wooed and won<BR>
By Das'aratha's royal son,<BR>
The noblest of Ikshv&aacute;ku's line;<BR>
And every earthly joy was mine.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma left his royal home<BR>
In Dandak's tangled wilds to roam.<BR>
Where with Sumitr&aacute;'s son and me,<BR>
He lived a saintly devotee.<BR>
The giant R&aacute;van came with guile<BR>
And bore me thence to Lank&aacute;'s isle.<BR>
Some respite yet the fiend allows,<BR>
Two months of life, to R&aacute;ma's spouse.<BR>
Two moons of hopeless woe remain.<BR>
And then the captive will be slain.'<BR>
