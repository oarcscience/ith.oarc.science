<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXIX.: THE DEATH OF JAT&Aacute;YUS.</H3>
<P>
As R&aacute;ma viewed with heart-felt yain<BR>
The vulture whom the fiend had slain,<BR>
In words with tender love impressed<BR>
His brother chief he thus addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'This royal bird with faithful thought<BR>
For my advantage strove and fought.<BR>
Slain by the fiend in mortal strife<BR>
For me he yields his noble life.<BR>
See, Lakshman, how his wounds have bled;<BR>
His struggling breath will soon have fled.<BR>
Faint is his voice, and near to die,<BR>
He scarce can lift his trembling eye.<BR>
Jat&aacute;yus, if thou still can speak,<BR>
Give, give the answer that I seek.<BR>
The fate of ravished S&iacute;t&aacute; tell,<BR>
And how thy mournful chance befell.<BR>
Say why the giant stole my dame:<BR>
What have I done that he could blame?<BR>
What fault in me has R&aacute;van seen<BR>
That he should rob me of my queen?<BR>
How looked the lady's moon-bright cheek?<BR>
What were the words she found to speak?<BR>
His strength, his might, his deeds declare:<BR>
And tell the form he loves to wear.<BR>
To all my questions make reply:<BR>
Where does the giant's dwelling lie?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The noble bird his glances bent<BR>
On R&aacute;ma as he made lament,<BR>
And in low accents faint and weak<BR>
With anguish thus began to speak.<BR>
'Fierce R&aacute;van, king of giant race,<BR>
Stole S&iacute;t&aacute; from thy dwelling-place.<BR>
He calls his magic art to aid<BR>
With wind and cloud and gloomy shade.<BR>
When in the fight my power was spent<BR>
My wearied wings he cleft and rent.<BR>
Then round the dame his arms he threw,<BR>
And to the southern region flew.<BR>
O Raghu's son. I gasp for breath,<BR>
My swimming sight is dim in death.<BR>
Even now before my vision pass<BR>
Bright trees of * with hair of grass,<BR>
*<BR>
Brings on the thief a flood of woe<BR>
The giant in his haste *<BR>

<P>
'Twas Vinda's hour, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_514"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or heeded not.<BR>
Those robbed at such a time obtain<BR>
Their plundered store and wealth again.<BR>
He, like a fish that takes the bait,<BR>
In briefest time shall meet his fate.<BR>
Now be thy troubled heart controlled<BR>
And for thy lady's loss consoled.<BR>
For thou wilt slay the fiend in fight<BR>
And with thy dame have new delight.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With senses clear, though sorely tried,<BR>
The royal vulture thus replied,<BR>
While as he sank beneath his pain<BR>
Forth rushed the tide of blood again.<BR>
'Him, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> brother of the Lord of Gold,<BR>
Vis'ravas' self begot of old.'<BR>
Thus spoke the bird, and stained with gore<BR>
Resigned the breath that came no more.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Speak, speak again!' thus R&aacute;ma cried,<BR>
With reverent palm to palm applied,<BR>
But from the frame the spirit fled<BR>
And to the skiey regions sped.<BR>
The breath of life had passed away.<BR>
Stretched on the ground the body lay.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Rama saw the vulture lie,<BR>
Hupe as a hill, with darksome eye,<BR>
With many a poignant woe distressed<BR>
His brother chief he thus addressed:<BR>
'Amid these haunted shades content<BR>
Full many a year this bird has spent.<BR>
His life in home of giants passed,<BR>
In Dandak wood he dies at last.<BR>
The years in lengthened course have fled<BR>
Untroubled o'er the vulture's head,<BR>
And now he lies in death, for none<BR>
The stern decrees of Fate may shun.<BR>
See, Lakshman, how the vulture fell<BR>
While for my sake he battled well.<BR>
And strove to free with onset bold<BR>
My S&iacute;t&aacute; from the giant's hold.<BR>
Supreme amid the vulture kind<BR>
His ancient rule the bird resigned.<BR>
And conquered in tho fruitless strife<BR>
Gave for my sake his noble life.<BR>
O Lakshman, many a time we see<BR>
Great souls who keep the law's decree,<BR>
With whom the weak sure refuge find,<BR>
In creatures of inferior kind.<BR>
The kiss of her, my darling queen,<BR>
Strikes with a pang less fiercely keen<BR>
Than now this slaughtered bird to see<BR>
Who nobly fought and died for me.<BR>
As Das'aratha, good and great,<BR>
Was glorious in his high estate,<BR>
Honoured by all to all endeared,<BR>
So was this royal bird revered.<BR>
Bring fuel for the funeral site:<BR>
These hands the solemn fire shall light<BR>

<P>
And on the burning pyre shall lay<BR>
The bird who died for me to-day.<BR>
Now on the gathered wood shall lie<BR>
The lord of all the birds that fly,<BR>
And I will burn with honours due<BR>
My champion whom the giant slew.<BR>
O royal bird of noblest heart,<BR>
Graced with all funeral rites depart<BR>
To bright celestial seats above,<BR>
Rewarded for thy faithful love.<BR>
Dwell in thy happy home with those<BR>
Whose constant fires of worship rose.<BR>
Live blest amid the unyielding brave,<BR>
And those who land in largess gave.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sore grief upon his bosom weighed<BR>
As on the pyre the bird he laid,<BR>
And bade the kindled flame ascend<BR>
To burn the body of his friend.<BR>
Then with his brother by his side<BR>
The hero to the forest hied.<BR>
There many a stately deer he slew.<BR>
The flesh around the bird to strew.<BR>
The venison into balls he made.<BR>
And on fair grass before him laid.<BR>
Then that the parted soul might rise<BR>
And find free passage to the skies,<BR>
Each solemn word and text he said<BR>
Which Brahmans utter o'er the dead.<BR>
Then hastening went the princely pair<BR>
To bright Godayan&iacute;, and there<BR>
Libations of the stream they poured<BR>
In honour of the vulture lord,<BR>
With solemn ritual to the slain,<BR>
As scripture's holy texts ordain.<BR>
Thus offerings to the bird they gave<BR>
And bathed their bodies in the wave,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The vulture monarch having wrought<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A hard and glorious feat,<BR>
Honoured by R&aacute;ma sage in thought,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Soared to his blissful seat.<BR>
The brothers, when each rite was paid<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To him of birds supreme,<BR>
Their hearts with new-found comfort stayed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And turned them from the stream.<BR>
Like soveriegns of celestial race<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Within the wood they came,<BR>
Each pondering the means to trace,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The captor of the dame.<BR>
