<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXIII.: THE PEOPLE'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
Thus Sit&aacute; and the princes brave<BR>
Much wealth to all the Br&aacute;hmans gave<BR>
Then to the monarch's house the three<BR>
Went forth the aged king to see.<BR>
The princes from two servants took<BR>
Those heavenly arms of glorious look,<BR>
Adorned with garland and with band<BR>
By Sit&aacute;'s beautifying hand.<BR>
On each high house a mournful throng<BR>
Had gathered ere they passed along,<BR>
Who gzed in pure unselfish woe<BR>
From turret, root, and portico.<BR>
So dense the crowd that blocked the ways,<BR>
The rest, unable there to gaze,<BR>
Were fain each terrace to ascend.<BR>
And thence their eyes on R&aacute;ma bend.<BR>
Then as the gathered multitude<BR>
On foot their well-loved R&aacute;ma viewed.<BR>
No royal shade to screen his head.<BR>
Such words, disturbed in grief they said:<BR>
'O look, our hero, wont to ride<BR>
Leading a host in perfect pride--<BR>
Now Lakshman, sole of all his friends,<BR>
With Sit&aacute; on his steps attends.<BR>
Though he has known the sweets of power,<BR>
And poured his gifts in liberal shower,<BR>
From duty's path he will not swerve,<BR>

<P>
But, still his father's truth preserve.<BR>
And she whose form so soft and fair<BR>
Was veiled from spirits of the air,<BR>
Now walks unsheltered from the day,<BR>
Seen by the crowds who throng the way.<BR>
Ah, for that gently-nurtured form!<BR>
How will it fade with sun and storm!<BR>
How will the rain, the cold, the heat<BR>
Mar fragrant breast and tinted feet!<BR>
Surely some demon has possessed<BR>
His sire, and speaks within his breast,<BR>
Or how could one that is a king<BR>
Thus send his dear son wandering?<BR>
It were a deed unkindly done<BR>
To banish e'en a worthless son:<BR>
But what, when his pure life has gained<BR>
The hearts of all, by love enchained?<BR>
Six sovereign virtues join to grace<BR>
R&aacute;ma the foremost of his race:<BR>
Tender and kind and pure is he,<BR>
Docile, religious, passion-free.<BR>
Hence misery strikes not him alone:<BR>
In bitterest grief the people moan,<BR>
Like creatures of the stream, when dry<BR>
In the great heat the channels lie.<BR>
The world is mournful with the grief<BR>
That falls on its beloved chief,<BR>
As, when the root is hewn away,<BR>
Tree, fruit, and flower, and bud decay.<BR>
The soul of duty, bright to see,<BR>
He is the root of you and me;<BR>
And all of us, who share his grief,<BR>
His branches, blossom, fruit, and leaf.<BR>
Now like the faithful Lakshman, we<BR>
Will follow and be true as he;<BR>
Our wives and kinsmen call with speed,<BR>
And hasten where our lord shall lead.<BR>
Yes, we will leave each well-loved spot,<BR>
The field, the garden, and the cot,<BR>
And, sharers of his weal and woe,<BR>
Behind the pious R&aacute;ma go.<BR>
Our houses, empty of their stores,<BR>
With ruined courts and broken doors,<BR>
With all their treasures borne away.<BR>
And gear that made them bright and gay:<BR>
O'errun by rats, with dust o'erspread,<BR>
Shrines, whence the deities have fled,<BR>
Where not a hand the water pours,<BR>
Or sweeps the long-neglected floors,<BR>
No incense loads the evening air,<BR>
No Br&aacute;hmans chant the text and prayer,<BR>
No fire of sacrifice is bright,<BR>
No gift is known, no sacred rite;<BR>
With floors which broken vessels strew,<BR>
As if our woes had crushed them too--<BR>
Of these be stern Kaikey&iacute; queen,<BR>
And rule o'er homes where we have been.<BR>
The wood where R&aacute;ma's feet may roam<BR>
Shall be our city and our home,<BR>
And this fair city we forsake,<BR>
Our flight a wilderness shall make.<BR>
Each serpent from his hole shall hie,<BR>
The birds and beasts from mountain fly,<BR>
Lions and elephants in fear<BR>
Shall quit the woods when we come near,<BR>
Yield the broad wilds for us to range,<BR>
And take our city in exchange.<BR>
With R&aacute;ma will we hence, content<BR>
If, where he is, our days be spent.'<BR>

<P>
Such were the varied words the crowd<BR>
Of all conditions spoke aloud.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma heard their speeches, yet<BR>
Changed not his purpose firmly set.<BR>
His father's palace soon he neared,<BR>
That like Kail&aacute;sa's hill appeared.<BR>
Like a wild elephant he strode<BR>
Right onward to the bright abode.<BR>
Within the palace court he stepped,<BR>
Where ordered bands their station kept,<BR>
And saw Sumantra standing near<BR>
With down-cast eye and gloomy cheer.<BR>
