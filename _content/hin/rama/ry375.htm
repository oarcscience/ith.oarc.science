<P>
With joyous heart she heard him tell<BR>
Of the great lord she loved so well,<BR>
And in sweet accents, soft and low,<BR>
Spoke, half forgetful of her woe:<BR>
'How didst thou stand by R&aacute;ma's side?<BR>
How came my lord and thou allied?<BR>
How met the people of the wood<BR>
With men on terms of brotherhood?<BR>
Declare each grace and regal sign<BR>
That decks the lords of Raghu's line.<BR>
Each circumstance and look relate<BR>
Tell R&aacute;ma's form and speech, and gait.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Thy fear and doubt,' he cried, 'dispelled,<BR>
Hear, lady, what mine eyes beheld.<BR>
Hear the imperial signs that grace<BR>
The glory of Ikshv&aacute;ku's race.<BR>
With moon-bright face and lotus eyes,<BR>
Most beautiful and good and wise,<BR>
With sun-like glory round his head,<BR>
Long-suffering as the earth we tread,<BR>
He from all foes his realm defends.<BR>
Yea, o'er the world his care extends.<BR>
He follows right in all his ways,<BR>
And ne'er from royal duty strays.<BR>

<P>

<P>
He knows the lore that strengthens kings;<BR>
His heart to truth and honour clings.<BR>
Each grace and gift of form and mind<BR>
Adorns that prince of human kind;<BR>
And virtues like his own endue<BR>
His brother ever firm and true.<BR>
O'er all the land they roamed distaught,<BR>
And thee with vain endeavour sought,<BR>
Until at length their wandering feet<BR>
Trod wearily our wild retreat.<BR>
Our banished king Sugr&iacute;va spied<BR>
The princes from the mountain side.<BR>
By his command I sought the pair<BR>
And led them to our monarch there.<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma and Sugr&iacute;va met,<BR>
And joined the bonds that knit them yet,<BR>
When each besought the other's aid,<BR>
And friendship and alliance made.<BR>
An arrow launched from R&aacute;ma's bow<BR>
Laid B&aacute;li dead, Sugr&iacute;va's foe.<BR>
Then by commandment of our lord<BR>
The V&aacute;nar hosts each land explored.<BR>
We reached the coast: I crossed the sea<BR>
And found my way at length to thee.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_864"></A><A HREF="ry376.htm#fn_864"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
