<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO L.: JAT&Aacute;YUS.</H3>
<P>
The vulture from his slumber woke<BR>
And heard the words which S&iacute;t&aacute; spoke.<BR>
He raised his eye and looked on her,<BR>
Looked on her giant ravisher.<BR>
That noblest bird with pointed beak,<BR>
Majestic as a mountain peak,<BR>
High on the tree addressed the king<BR>
Of giants, wisely counselling:<BR>
'O Ten-necked lord, I firmly hold<BR>
To faith and laws ordained of old,<BR>
And thou, my brother, shouldst refrain<BR>
From guilty deeds that shame and stain.<BR>
The vulture king supreme in air,<BR>
Jatayus is the name I bear.<BR>
Thy captive, known by S&iacute;t&aacute;'s name,<BR>
Is the dear consort and the dame<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma Das'aratha's heir,<BR>
Who makes the good of all his care.<BR>
Lord of the world in might he vies<BR>
With the great Gods of seas and skies.<BR>
The law he boasts to keep allows<BR>
No king to touch another's spouse,<BR>
And, more than all, a prince's dame<BR>
High honour and respect may claim.<BR>
Back to the earth thy way incline,<BR>
Nor think of one who is not thine.<BR>
Heroic souls should hold it shame<BR>
To stoop to deeds which others blame,<BR>
And all respect by them is shown<BR>
To dames of others as their own.<BR>
Not every case of bliss and gain<BR>
The Scripture's holy texts explain,<BR>
And subjects, when that light is dim,<BR>
Look to their prince and follow him.<BR>
The king is bliss and profit, he<BR>
Is store of treasures fair to see,<BR>
And all the people's fortunes spring,<BR>
Their joy and misery, from the king.<BR>
If, lord of giant race, thy mind<BR>
Be fickle, false, to sin inclined,<BR>
How wilt thou kingly place retain?<BR>
High thrones in heaven no sinners gain.<BR>
The soul which gentle passions sway<BR>
Ne'er throws its nobler part away,<BR>
Nor ill the mansion of the base<BR>
Long be the good man's dwelling-place.<BR>
Prince R&aacute;ma, chief of high renown,<BR>
Has wronged thee not in field or town.<BR>
Ne'er has he sinned against thee: how<BR>
Canst thou resolve to harm him now?<BR>
If moved by S'&uacute;rpankh&aacute;'s prayer<BR>
The giant Khara sought him there,<BR>
And fighting fell with baffled aim,<BR>
His and not R&aacute;ma's is the blame.<BR>
Say, mighty lord of giants, say<BR>
What fault on R&aacute;ma canst thou lay?<BR>
What has the world's great master done<BR>
That thou should steal his precious one?<BR>
Quick, quick the Maithil dame release;<BR>
Let R&aacute;ma's consort go in peace,<BR>
Lest scorched by his terrific eye<BR>
Beneath his wrath thou fall and die<BR>
Like Vritra when Lord Indra threw<BR>
The lightning flame that smote and slew.<BR>
Ah fool, with blinded eyes to take<BR>
Home to thy heart a venomed snake!<BR>
Ah foolish eyes, too blind to see<BR>
That Death's dire coils entangle thee!<BR>
The prudent man his strength will spare,<BR>
Nor lift a load too great to bear.<BR>
Content is he with wholsome food<BR>
Which gives him life and strength renewed<BR>
But who would dare the guilty deed<BR>
That brings no fame or glorious meed,<BR>
Where merit there is none to win<BR>
And vengeance soon o'ertakes the sin?<BR>
My course of life, Pulastya's son,<BR>
For sixty thousand years has run.<BR>
Lord of my kind I still maintain<BR>
Mine old hereditary reign.<BR>
I, worn by years, am older far<BR>
Than thou, young lord of bow and car,<BR>
In coat of glittering mail encased<BR>
And armed with arrows at thy waist,<BR>
But not unchallenged shalt thou go,<BR>
Or steal the dame without a blow.<BR>
Thou canst not, King, before mine eyes<BR>
Hear off unchecked thy lovely prize,<BR>
Safe as the truth of Scripture bent<BR>
By no close logic's argument.<BR>
Stay if thy courage let thee, stay<BR>
And meet me in the battle fray,<BR>
And thou shalt stain the earth with gore<BR>
Falling as Khara fell before.<BR>
Soon R&aacute;ma, clothed in bark shall smite.<BR>

<P>
Thee, his proud foe, in deadly fight,--<BR>
R&aacute;ma, from whom have oft times fled<BR>
The Daitya hosts discomfited.<BR>
No power have I to kill or slay:<BR>
The princely youths are far away,<BR>
But soon shalt thou with fearful eye<BR>
Struck down beneath their arrows lie,<BR>
But while I yet have life and sense,<BR>
Thou shalt not, tyrant, carry hence<BR>
Fair S&iacute;t&aacute;, Ram&aacute;'s honoured queen,<BR>
With lotus eyes and lovely mien.<BR>
Whate'er the pain, whate'er the cost,<BR>
Though in the struggle life be lost,<BR>
The will of Raghu's noblest son<BR>
And Das'aratha must be done.<BR>
Stay for a while, O R&aacute;van, stay,<BR>
One hour thy flying car delay,<BR>
And from that glorious chariot thou<BR>
Shalt fall like fruit from shaken bough,<BR>
For I to thee, while yet I live,<BR>
The welcome of a foe will give.'<BR>
