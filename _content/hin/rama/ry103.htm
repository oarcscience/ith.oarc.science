<P>
Her grief and woe she cast aside,<BR>
Her lips with water purified,<BR>
And thus her benison began<BR>
That mother of the noblest man:<BR>
'If thou wilt hear no words of mine,<BR>
Go forth, thou pride of Raghu's line.<BR>
Go, darling, and return with speed,<BR>
Walking where noble spirits lead.<BR>
May virtue on thy steps attend.<BR>
And be her faithful lover's friend.<BR>
May Those to whom thy vows are paid<BR>
In temple and in holy shade,<BR>
With all the mighty saints combine<BR>
To keep that precious life of thine.<BR>
The arms wise Vis'v?itra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> gave<BR>
Thy virtuous soul from danger save.<BR>
Long be thy life: thy sure defence<BR>
Shall b?thy truthful innocence,<BR>
And that obedience, naught can tire,<BR>
To me thy mother and thy sire.<BR>
May fanes where holy fires are fed,<BR>
Altars with grass and fuel spread,<BR>
Each sacrificial ground, each tree,<BR>
Rock, lake, and mountain, prosper thee.<BR>
Let old Vir?,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and Him who made<BR>
The universe, combine to aid;<BR>
Let Indra and each guardian Lord<BR>
Who keeps the worlds, their help afford,<BR>
And be thy constant friend the Sun,<BR>
Lord P?h? Bhaga, Aryaman.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
Fortnights and seasons, nights and days,<BR>
Years, months, and hours, protect thy ways,<BR>
Vrihaspati shall still be nigh,<BR>
The War-God, and the Moon on high,<BR>
And N?ad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and the sainted seven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_296"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><BR>
Shall watch thee from their starry heaven.<BR>
The mountains, and the seas which ring<BR>
The world, and Varuna the King,<BR>
Sky, ether, and the wind, whate'er<BR>
Moves not or moves, for thee shall care.<BR>
Each lunar mansion be benign,<BR>
With happier light the planets shine;<BR>
All gods, each light in heaven that glows,<BR>
Potect my child where'er he goes.<BR>
The twilight hours, the day and night,<BR>
Keep in the wood thy steps aright.<BR>
Watch, minute, instant, as they flee,<BR>
Shall all bring happiness to thee.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Celestials and the Titan brood<BR>
Protect thee in thy solitude,<BR>
And haunt the mighty wood to bless<BR>
The wanderer in his hermit dress.<BR>
Fear not, by mightier guardians screened,<BR>
The giant or night-roving fiend;<BR>
Nor let the cruel race who tear<BR>
Man's flesh for food thy bosom scare.<BR>
Far be the ape, the scorpion's sting,<BR>
Fly, gnat, and worm, and creeping thing.<BR>
Thee shall the hungry lion spare,<BR>
The tiger, elephant, and bear:<BR>
Safe, from their furious might repose,<BR>
Safe from the horned buffaloes.<BR>
Each savage thing the forests breed,<BR>
That love on human flesh to feed,<BR>
Shall for my child its rage abate,<BR>
When thus its wrath I deprecate.<BR>
Blest be thy ways: may sweet success<BR>
The valour of my darling bless.<BR>
To all that Fortune can bestow,<BR>
Go forth, my child, my R&aacute;ma, go.<BR>
Go forth, O happy in the love<BR>
Of all the Gods below, above;<BR>
And in those guardian powers confide<BR>
Thv paths who keep, thy steps who guide.<BR>
May S'ukra,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> Yama, Sun, and Moon,<BR>
And He who gives each golden boon,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_298"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Won by mine earnest pravers, be good<BR>
To thee, my son, in Dandak wood.<BR>
Fire, wind, and smoke, each text and spell<BR>
From mouths of holy seers that fell,<BR>
Guard R&aacute;ma when his limbs he dips,<BR>
Or with the stream makes pure his lips!<BR>
May the great saints and He, the Lord<BR>
Who made the worlds, by worlds adored,<BR>
And every God in heaven beside<BR>
My banished R&aacute;ma keep and guide.<BR>

<P>
Thus with due praise the long-eyed dame,<BR>
Ennobled by her spotless fame,<BR>
With wreaths of flowers and precious scent<BR>
Worshipped the Gods, most reverent.<BR>
A high-souled Br?man lit the fire,<BR>
And offered, at the queen's desire,<BR>
The holy oil ordained to burn<BR>
For R&aacute;ma's weal and safe return.<BR>
Kaus'aly? best of dames, with care<BR>
Set oil, wreaths, fuel, mustard, there.<BR>
Then when the rites of fire had ceased,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma's bliss and health, the priest,<BR>
Standing without gave what remained<BR>
In general offering,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_299"></A><A HREF="#fn_299"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> as ordained.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Dealing among the twice-horn train<BR>
Honey, and curds, and oil, and grain,<BR>
He bade each heart and voice unite<BR>
To bless. the youthful anchorite.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma's mother, glorious dame<BR>
Bestowed, to meet the Br&aacute;hman's claim,<BR>
A lordly fee for duty done:<BR>
And thus again addressed her son:<BR>

<P>
'Such blessings as the Gods o'erjoyed<BR>
Poured forth, when Vritra &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_300"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> was destroyed,<BR>
On Indra of the thousand eyes,<BR>
Attend, my child, thine enterprise!<BR>
Yea, such as Vinat&aacute; once gave<BR>
To King Suparna &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_301"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> swift and brave,<BR>
Who sought the drink that cheers the skies,<BR>
Attend, my child, thine enterprise!<BR>
Yea, such as, when the Amrit rose, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
And Indra slew his Daitya foes,<BR>
The royal Aditi bestowed<BR>
On Him whose hand with slaughter glowed<BR>
Of that dire brood of monstrous size,<BR>
Attend, my child, thine enterprise!<BR>
E'en such as peerless Vishnu graced,<BR>
When with his triple step he paced,<BR>
Outbursting from the dwarf's disguise, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_303"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><BR>
Attend, my child, thine enterprise!<BR>
Floods, isles, and seasons as they fly,<BR>
Worlds, Vedas, quarters of the sky,<BR>
Combine, O mighty-armed, to bless<BR>
Thee destined heir of happiness!'<BR>

<P>
The long-eyed lady ceased: she shed<BR>
Pure scent and grain upon his head.<BR>
And that prized herb whose sovereign power<BR>
Preserves from dark misfortune's hour,<BR>
Upon the hero's arm she set,<BR>
To be his faithful amulet.<BR>
While holy tunes she murmured low,<BR>
Aud spoke glad words though crushed by woe,<BR>
Concealing with obedient tongue<BR>
The pangs with which her heart was wrung.<BR>
She bent,she kissed his brow, she pressed<BR>
Her darling to her troubled breast:<BR>
'Firm in thy purpose, go,' she cried,<BR>
'Go R&aacute;ma, and my bliss betide.<BR>
Attain returning safe and well,<BR>
Triumphant in Ayodhy&aacute;, dwell.<BR>
Then shall my happy eyes behold<BR>
The empire by thy will controlled.<BR>
Then grief and care shall leave no trace,<BR>
Joy shall light up thy mother's face,<BR>
And I shall see my darling reign,<BR>
In moonlike glory come again.<BR>
These eyes shall fondly gaze on thee<BR>
So faithful to thy sire's decree,<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>


<P>
When thou the forest wild shalt quit<BR>
On thine ancestral throne to sit.<BR>
Yea, thou shalt turn from exile back,<BR>
Nor choicest blessings ever lack,<BR>
Then fill with rapture ever new<BR>
My bosom and thy consort's too.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To S'iva and the heavenly host<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    My worship has been paid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To mighty saint, to godlike ghost,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To every wandering shade.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Forth to the forest thou wilt hie,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Therein to dwell so long:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Let all the quarters of the sky<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Protect my child from wrong.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her blessings thus the queen bestowed;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Then round him fondly paced,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And often, while her eyes o'erflowed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Her dearest son embraced.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kaus'aly&aacute;'s honoured feet he pressed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    As round her steps she bent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And radiant with her prayers that blessed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To Sit&aacute;'s home he went.<BR>
