<P>
Sugr&iacute;va started from his rest<BR>
With doubt and terror in his breast.<BR>
He heard the prince's furious tread<BR>
He saw his eyes glow fiercely red.<BR>
Swift sprang the monarch to his feet<BR>
Upstarting from his golden seat.<BR>
Rose Rum&aacute; and her fellows, too,<BR>
And closely round Sugr&iacute;va drew,<BR>
As round the moon's full glory stand<BR>
Attendant stars in glittering band.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va glanced with reddened eyes,<BR>
Raised his joined hands in suppliant guise<BR>
Flew to the door, and rooted there<BR>
Stood like the tree that grants each prayer.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_640"></A><A HREF="#fn_640"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And Lakshman saw, and, fiercely moved,<BR>
With angry speech the king reproved:<BR>

<P>

<P>
'Famed is the prince who loves the truth,<BR>
Whose soul is touched with tender ruth,<BR>
Who, liberal, keeps each sense subdued,<BR>
And pays the debt of gratitude.<BR>
but all unmeet a king to be,<BR>
The meanest of the mean is he<BR>
Who basely breaks the promise made<BR>
To trusting friends who lent him aid.<BR>
He sins who for a steed has lied,<BR>
As if a hundred steeds had died:<BR>
Or if he lie, a cow to win,<BR>
Tenfold as heavy is the sin.<BR>
But if the lie a man betray,<BR>
Both he and his shall all decay.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_641"></A><A HREF="#fn_641"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
O V&aacute;nar King, the thankless man<BR>
Is worthy of the general ban.<BR>
Who takes assistance of his friends,<BR>
And in his turn no service lends.<BR>
This verse of old by Brahm&aacute; sung<BR>
Is echoed now by every tongue.<BR>
Hear what He cried in angry mood<BR>
Bewailing man's ingratitude:<BR>
'For draughts of wine for slaughtered cows,<BR>
For treacherous theft, for broken vows<BR>
A pardon is ordained: but none<BR>
For thankless scorn of service done.'<BR>
Ungrateful, V&aacute;nar King, art thou,<BR>
And faithless to thy plighted vow.<BR>
For R&aacute;ma brought thee help, and yet<BR>
Thou shunnest to repay the debt:<BR>
Or, grateful, thou hadst surely pressed<BR>
To aid the hero in his quest.<BR>
Thou art, in vulgar pleasures drowned,<BR>
False to thy bond in honour bound.<BR>
Nor yet has R&aacute;ma's guileless heart<BR>
Discerned thee for the thing thou art--<BR>
A snake who holds the frogs that cries<BR>
And lures fresh victims as it dies.<BR>
Brave R&aacute;ma, born for glorious fate,<BR>
Has set thee in thy high estate,<BR>
And to the V&aacute;nars' throne restored,<BR>
Great-souled himself, their mean-souled lord.<BR>
Now if thy pride disown what he,<BR>
High thoughted prince, has done for thee,<BR>
Struck by his arrows shalt thou fall,<BR>
And B&aacute;li meet in Yama's hall.<BR>
Still open, to the gloomy God,<BR>
Lies the sad path thy brother trod.<BR>
Then to thy plighted word be true,<BR>
Nor let thy steps that path pursue.<BR>
Me thinks the shafts of R&aacute;ma, shot<BR>
Like thunderbolts, thou heedest not,<BR>
Who canst, absorbed in sensual bliss,<BR>
Thy promise from thy mind dismiss.'<BR>

one of the trees of Svarga or Indra's Paradise:
it has the power of granting all
desires.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_641"></A><A HREF="ry308.htm#fr_641">366:1b</A>  The meaning is that if a man promises
to give a horse and then breaks his word he
commits a sin as great as if he had killed
a hundred horses.</P>
