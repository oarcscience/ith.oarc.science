<P>
With perfect skill and wisdom high<BR>
Thus to his speech made fit reply:<BR>
'Thy words that tempt to bliss are fair.<BR>
But virtue's garb they falsely wear.<BR>
For he from duty's path who strays<BR>
To wander in forbidden ways,<BR>
Allured by doctrine false and vain,<BR>
Praise from the good can never gain.<BR>
Their lives the true and boaster show,<BR>
Pure and impure, and high and low.<BR>
Else were no mark to judge between<BR>
Stainless and stained and high and mean;<BR>
They to whose lot fair signs may fall<BR>
Were but as they who lack them all,<BR>
And those to virtuous thouguts inclined<BR>
Were but as men of evil mind.<BR>
If in the sacred name of right<BR>
I do this wrong in duty's spite;<BR>
The path of virtue meanly quit,<BR>
And this polluting sin commit,<BR>
What man who marks the bounds between<BR>
Virtue and vice with insight keen,<BR>
Would rank me high in after time.<BR>
Stained with this soul destroying crime?<BR>
Whither could I, the sinner, turn,<BR>
How hope a seat in heaven to earn,<BR>
If I my plighted promise break,<BR>
And thus the righteous path forsake?<BR>
This world of ours is ever led<BR>
To walk the ways which others tread,<BR>
And as their princes they behold,<BR>
The subjects too their lives will mould.<BR>
That truth and mercy still must be<BR>
Beloved of kings, is Heaven's decree.<BR>
Upheld by truth the monarch reigns,<BR>
And truth the very world sustains.<BR>
Truth evermore has been the love<BR>
Of holy saints and Gods above,<BR>
And he whose lips are truthful here<BR>
Wins after death the highest sphere.<BR>
As from a serpent's deadly tooth,<BR>
We shrink from him who scorns the truth.<BR>
For holy truth is root and spring<BR>
Of justice and each holy thing,<BR>
A might that every power transcends,<BR>
Linked to high bliss that never ends.<BR>
Truth is all virtue's surest base,<BR>
Supreme in worth and first in place.<BR>
Oblations, gifts men offer here,<BR>
Vows, sacrifice, and rites austere,<BR>
And Holy Writ, on truth depend:<BR>
So men must still that truth defend.<BR>
Truth, only truth protects the land,<BR>
By truth unharmed our houses stand;<BR>
Neglect of truth makes men distressed,<BR>
And truth in highest heaven is blessed.<BR>
Then how can I, rebellious, break<BR>
Commandments which my father spake--<BR>
I ever* true and faithful found,<BR>
And by my word of honour bound?<BR>
My father's bridge of truth shall stand<BR>
Unharmed by my destructive hand:<BR>
Not folly, ignorance, or greed<BR>
My darkened soul shall thus mislead.<BR>
Have we not heard that God and shade<BR>
Turn from the hated offerings paid<BR>
By him whose false and fickle mind<BR>
No pledge can hold, no promise bind?<BR>
Truth is all duty: as the soul,<BR>
It quickens and supports the whole.<BR>
The good respect this duty: hence<BR>
Its sacred claims I reverence.<BR>
The Warrior's duty I despise<BR>
That seeks the wrong in virtue's guise:<BR>
Those claims I shrink from, which the base,<BR>
Cruel, and covetous embrace.<BR>
The heart conceives the guilty thought,<BR>
Then by the hand the sin is wrought,<BR>
And with the pair is leagued a third,<BR>
The tongue that speaks the lying word.<BR>
Fortune and land and name and fame<BR>
To man's best care have right and claim;<BR>
The good will aye to truth adhere,<BR>
And its high laws must men revere.<BR>
Base were the deed thy lips would teach,<BR>
Approved as best by subtle speech.<BR>
Shall I my plighted promise break,<BR>
That I these woods my home would make?*<BR>
Shall I, as Bharat's words advise,<BR>
My father's solemn charge despise?<BR>
Firm stands the oath which then before<BR>
My father's face I soothly swore,<BR>
Which Queen Kaikeyi's anxious ear<BR>
Bejoiced with highest joy to hear.<BR>
Still in the wood will I remain,<BR>
With food prescribed my life sustain,<BR>
And please with fruit and roots and flowers<BR>
Ancestral shades and heavenly powers.<BR>
Here every sense contented, still<BR>
Heeding the bounds of good and ill,<BR>
My settled course will I pursue,<BR>
Firm in my faith and ever true.<BR>
Here in this wild and far retreat<BR>
Will I my noble task complete;<BR>
And Fire and Wind and *Moon shall be<BR>
Partakers of its fruit with me.<BR>
A hundred offerings duly wrought<BR>
His rank o'er Gods for Indra bought,<BR>
And mighty saints their heaven secured<BR>
By torturing years on earth endured.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That scoffing plea the hero spurned,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And thus he spake once more,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Chiding, the while his bosom burned,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    J&aacute;v&aacute;li's impious lore:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Justice, and courage ne'er dismayed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Pity for all distressed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Truth, loving honour duly paid<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To Brahman, God, and guest--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In these, the true and virtuous say,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Should lives of men be passed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They form the right and happy way<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That leads to heaven at last.<BR>

<P>
My father's thoughtless act I chide<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That gave thee honoured place,<BR>
Whose soul, from virtue turned aside,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is faithless, dark, and base.<BR>
We rank the Buddhist with the thief,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_388"></A><A HREF="ry188.htm#fn_388"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And all the impious crew<BR>
Who share his sinful disbelief,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And hate the right and true.<BR>
Hence never should wise kings who seek<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To rule their people well,<BR>
Admit, before their face to speak,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The cursed infidel.<BR>
But twice-born men in days gone by,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of other sort than thou,<BR>
Have wrought good deeds, whose glories high<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Are fresh among us now:<BR>
This world they conquered, nor in vain<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They strove to win the skies:<BR>
The twice-born hence pure lives maintain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And fires of worship rise.<BR>
Those who in virtue's path delight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And with the virtuous live,--<BR>
Whose flames of holy zeal are bright,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Whose hands are swift to give,<BR>
Who injure none, and good and mild<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In every grace excel,<BR>
Whose lives by sin are undefiled,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  We love and honour well.'<BR>
Thus Rama spoke in righteous rage<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  *J'av'ali's speech to chide,<BR>
When thus again the virtuous sage<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In truthful words replied:<BR>
'The atheist's lore I use no more,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Not mine his impious creed:<BR>
His words and doctrine I abhor,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Assumed at time of need.<BR>
E'en as I rose to speak with thee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fit occasion came<BR>
That bade me use the atheist's plea<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To turn thee from thine aim.<BR>
The atheist creed I disavow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Unsay the words of sin,<BR>
And use the faithful's language now<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy favour, Prince, to win.<BR>
