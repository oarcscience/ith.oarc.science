### CANTO CIX.: THE BATTLE.

With wondrous power and might and skill  
The giant fought with Ráma still.  
Each at his foe his chariot drove,  
And still for death or victory strove.  
The warriors' steeds together dashed,  
And pole with pole reëchoing clashed.  
Then Ráma launching dart on dart  
Made Rávan's coursers swerve and start.  
Nor was the lord of Lanká slow  
To rain his arrows on the foe,  
Who showed, by fiery points assailed,  
No trace of pain, nor shook nor quailed.  
Dense clouds of arrows Ráma shot  
With that strong arm which rested not,  
And spear and mace and club and brand  
Fell in dire rain from Rávan's hand.  
The storm of missiles fiercely cast  
Stirred up the oceans with its blast,  
And Serpent-Gods and fiends who dwell  
Below were troubled by the swell.  
The earth with hill and plain and brook  
And grove and garden reeled and shook:  
The very sun grew cold and pale,  
And horror stiled the rising gale.  
God and Gandharva, sage and saint  
Cried out, with grief and terror faint:  
O may the prince of Raghu' line  
Give peace to Bráhmans and to kine,  
And, rescuing the worlds, o'erthrow  
The giant king our awful foe.'  

Then to his deadly string the pride  
Of Raghu's race a shaft applied.  
Sharp as a serpent's venomed fang  
Straight to its mark the arrow sprang,  
And from the giant's body shred  
With trenchant steel the monstrous head.  
There might the triple world behold  
That severed head adorned with gold.  
But when all eyes were bent to view,  
Swift in its stead another grew.  
Again the shaft was pointed well:  
Again the head divided fell;  
But still as each to earth was cast  
Another head succeeded fast.  
A hundred, bright with fiery flame,  
Fell low before the victor's aim,  
Yet Rávan by no sign betrayed  
That death was near or strength decayed.  
The doubtful fight he still maintained,  
And on the foe his missiles rained.  
In air, on earth, on plain, on hill,  
With awful might he battled still;  
And through the hours of night and day  
The conflict knew no pause or stay.
