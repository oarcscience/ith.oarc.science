'See, brother, see'  thus R&aacute;ma cried<BR>
On M&aacute;lyavat's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_619"></A><A HREF="#fn_619"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> dark-wooded side,<BR>
'A chain of clouds. like lofty hills,<BR>
The sky with gathering shadow fills.<BR>
Nine months those clouds have borne the load<BR>
Conceived from sunbeams as they glowed,<BR>
And, having drunk the seas, give birth,<BR>
And drop their offspring on the earth.<BR>
Easy it seems at such a time<BR>
That flight of cloudy stairs to climb,<BR>
And, from their summit, safely won,<BR>
Hang flowery wreaths about the sun.<BR>
Bee how the flash of evening's red<BR>
Fringes the fleecy clouds o'erhead<BR>
Till all the sky is streaked and lined<BR>
With bleeding wounds incarnadined,<BR>
Or the wide firmament above<BR>
Shows like a lover sick with love<BR>
And, pale with cloudlets, heaves a sigh<BR>
ln the soft breeze that wanders by.<BR>
See, by the fervent heat embrowned,<BR>
How drenched with recent showers, the ground<BR>
Pours out in floods her gushing tears,<BR>
Like S&iacute;t&aacute; wild with torturing fears.<BR>
So softly blows this cloud-borne breeze<BR>
Cool through the boughs of camphor trees<BR>
That one might hold it in the cup<BR>
Of hollowed hands and drink it up.<BR>
See, brother, where that rocky steep,<BR>
Where odorous shrubs in rain-drops weep,<BR>
Shows like Sugr&iacute;va when they shed<BR>
Tne royal balm upon his head.<BR>
Like students at their task appear<BR>
These hills whose misty peaks are near:<BR>
Black deerskin &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_620"></A><A HREF="#fn_620"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> garments wrought of cloud<BR>
Their forms with fitting mantles shroud,<BR>
Each torrent from the summit poured<BR>
Supplies the place of sacred cord. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_621"></A><A HREF="#fn_621"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
And winds that in their caverns moan.<BR>

Sound like the voice's undertone. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_622"></A><A HREF="#fn_622"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
From east to west red lightnings flash,<BR>
And, quivering neath the golden lash,<BR>
The great sky like a generous steed<BR>
Groans inly at each call to speed<BR>
Yon lightning, as it flashes through<BR>
The giant cloud of sable hue,<BR>
Recalls my votaress S&iacute;t&aacute; pressed<BR>
Mid struggles to the demon's breast.<BR>
See, on those mountain ridges stand<BR>
Sweet shrubs that bud and bloom expand.<BR>
The soft ram ends their pangs of grief.<BR>
And drops its pearls on flower and leaf.<BR>
But all their raptures stab me through<BR>
And wake my pining love anew. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_623"></A><A HREF="#fn_623"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Now through the air no wild bird flies,<BR>
Each lily shuts her weary eyes;<BR>
And blooms of opening jasmin show<BR>
The parting sun has ceased to glow<BR>
No captain now for conquest burns,<BR>
But homeward with his host returns;<BR>
For roads and kings' ambitious dreams<BR>
Have vanished neath descending streams.<BR>
This is the watery month&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_624"></A><A HREF="#fn_624"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> wherein<BR>
The S&aacute;man's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_625"></A><A HREF="#fn_625"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> sacred chants begin.<BR>
&Aacute;sh&aacute;dha &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_626"></A><A HREF="#fn_626"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> past, now Kosal's lord &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_627"></A><A HREF="#fn_627"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A><BR>
The harvest of the spring has stored, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_628"></A><A HREF="#fn_628"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A><BR>
And dwells within his palace freed<BR>

From every care of pressing need<BR>
Full is the moon, and fierce and strong<BR>
Impetuous Sarj&uacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_629"></A><A HREF="ry303.htm#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> roars along<BR>
As though Ayodhy&aacute;'s crowds ran out<BR>
To greet their king with echoing shout.<BR>
In this sweet time of ease and rest<BR>
No care disturbs Sugr&iacute;va's breast,<BR>
The foe that marred his peace o'erthrown,<BR>
And queen and realm once more his own.<BR>
Alas, a harder fate is mine,<BR>
Reft both of realm and queen to pine,<BR>
And, like the bank which floods erode,<BR>
I sink beneath my sorrow's load.<BR>
Sore on my soul my miseries weigh,<BR>
And these long rains our action stay,<BR>
While R&aacute;van seems a mightier foe<BR>
Than I dare hope to overthrow.<BR>
I saw the roads were barred by rain,<BR>
I knew the hopes of war were vain;<BR>
Nor could I bid Sugr&iacute;va rise,<BR>
Though prompt to aid my enterprise.<BR>
E'en now I scarce can urge my friend<BR>
On whom his house and realm depend,<BR>
Who, after toil and peril past,<BR>
Is happy with his queen at last.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va after rest will know<BR>
The hour is come to strike the blow,<BR>
Nor will his grateful soul forget<BR>
My succour, or deny the debt<BR>
I know his generous heart, and hence<BR>
Await the time with confidence<BR>
When he his friendly zeal will show,<BR>
And brooks again untroubled flow.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_630"></A><A HREF="ry303.htm#fn_630"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>

appears to me to be erroneous, and I
think that instead o&pound; M&aacute;lyavat should be

mountains situated exactly in that southern
part of India where R&aacute;ma now was.

east." GORRESIO.</P>

of the rainy season which (<I>is</I>?) not found in
the Bengal recension and appears to have
been interpolated by a far inferior and
much later hand than Valmiki's. It is
composed in a metre different from that
of the rest of the Canto, and contains
figures of poetical rhetoric and commonplaces
which are the delight of more recent poets.</P>
