<P>
Thus by the holy dame addressed<BR>
Who banished envy from her breast,<BR>
Her lowly reverence S&iacute;t&aacute; paid,<BR>
And softly thus her answer made:<BR>
'No marvel, best of dames, thy speech<BR>
The duties of a wife should teach;<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_227"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 227</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Yet I, O lady, also know<BR>
Due reverence to my lord to show.<BR>
Were he the meanest of the base,<BR>
Unhonoured with a single grace,<BR>
My husband still I ne'er would leave,<BR>
But firm through all to him would cleave:<BR>
Still rather to a lord like mine<BR>
Whose virtues high-exalted shine,<BR>
Compassionate, of lofty soul,<BR>
Vith every sense in due control,<BR>
True in his love, of righteous mind,<BR>
Like a dear sire and mother kind.<BR>
E'en as he ever loves to treat<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; with observance meet,<BR>
Has his behaviour ever been<BR>
To every other honoured queen.<BR>
Nay, more, a sonlike reverence shows<BR>
The noble R&aacute;ma e'en to those<BR>
On whom the king his father set<BR>
His eyes one moment, to forget.<BR>
Deep in my heart the words are stored,<BR>
Said by the mother of my lord,<BR>
When from my home I turned away<BR>
In the lone fearful woods to stray.<BR>
The counsel of my mother deep<BR>
Impressed upon my soul I keep,<BR>
When by the fire I took my stand,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma clasped in his my hand.<BR>
And in my bosom cherished yet,<BR>
My friends' advice I ne'er forget:<BR>
Woman her holiest offering pays<BR>
When she her husband's will obeys.<BR>
Good S&aacute;vitr&iacute; her lord obeyed,<BR>
And a high saint in heaven was made,<BR>
And for the self-same virtue thou<BR>
Hast heaven in thy possession now.<BR>
And she with whom no dame could vie,<BR>
Now a bright Goddess in the sky,<BR>
Sweet Rohin&iacute; the Moon's dear Queen,<BR>
Without her lord is never seen:<BR>
And many a faithful wife beside<BR>
For her pure love is glorified.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus S&iacute;t&aacute; spake: soft rapture stole<BR>
Through Anas&uacute;y&aacute;'s saintly soul:<BR>
Kisses on S&iacute;t&aacute;'s head she pressed,<BR>
And thus the Maithil dame addressed:<BR>
'I by long rites and toils endured<BR>
Rich store of merit have secured:<BR>
From this my wealth will I bestow<BR>
A blessing ere I let thee go.<BR>
So right and wise and true each word<BR>
That from thy lips mine ears have heard,<BR>
I love thee: be my pleasing task<BR>
To grant the boon that thou shalt ask.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then S&iacute;t&aacute; marvelled much, and while<BR>
Played o'er her lips a gentle smile,<BR>
'All has been done, O Saint, she cried,<BR>
And naught remains to wish beside.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She spake; the lady's meek reply<BR>
Swelled Anas&uacute;y&aacute;'s rapture high.<BR>
'S&iacute;t&aacute;,' she said,' my gift to-day<BR>
Thy sweet contentment shall repay.<BR>
Accept this precious robe to wear,<BR>
Of heavenly fabric, rich and rare,<BR>
These gems thy limbs to ornament,<BR>
This precious balsam sweet of scent.<BR>
O Maithil dame, this gift of mine<BR>
Shall make thy limbs with beauty shine,<BR>
And breathing o'er thy frame dispense<BR>
Its pure and lasting influence.<BR>
This balsam on thy fair limbs spread<BR>
New radiance on thy lord shall shed,<BR>
As Lakshm&iacute;'s beauty lends a grace<BR>
To Vishnu's own celestial face.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then S&iacute;t&aacute; took the gift the dame<BR>
Bestowed on her in friendship's name,<BR>
The balsam, gems, and robe divine,<BR>
And garlands wreathed of bloomy twine;<BR>
Then sat her down, with reverence meet,<BR>
At saintly Anas&uacute;y&aacute;'s feet.<BR>
The matron rich in rites and vows<BR>
Turned her to R&aacute;ma's Maithil spouse,<BR>
And questioned thus in turn to hear<BR>
A pleasant tale to charm her ear:<BR>
'S&iacute;t&aacute;, 'tis said that Raghu's son<BR>
Thy hand, mid gathered suitors, won.<BR>
I fain would hear thee, lady, tell<BR>
The story as it all befell:<BR>
Do thou repeat each thing that passed,<BR>
Reviewing all from first to last.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spake the dame to S&iacute;t&aacute;: she<BR>
Replying to the devotee,<BR>
'Then, lady, thy attention lend,'<BR>
Rehearsed the story to the end:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  King Janak, just and brave and strong.<BR>
Who loves the right and hates the wrong.<BR>
Well skilled in what the law ordains<BR>
For Warriors, o'er Videha reigns.<BR>
Guiding one morn the plough, his hand<BR>
Marked out, for rites the sacred land,<BR>
When, as the ploughshare cleft the earth,<BR>
Child of the king I leapt to birth.<BR>
Then as the ground he smoothed and cleared,<BR>
He saw me all with dust besmeared,<BR>
And on the new-found babe, amazed<BR>
The ruler of Videha gazed.<BR>
In childless love the monarch pressed<BR>
The welcome infant to his breast:<BR>
'My daughter,' thus he cried, 'is she:'<BR>
And as his child he cared for me.<BR>
Forth from the sky was heard o'erhead<BR>
As 'twere a human voice that said:<BR>
'Yea, even so: great King, this child<BR>
Henceforth thine own be justly styled.'<BR>
Videha's monarch, virtuous souled,<BR>
Rejoiced o'er me with joy untold,<BR>
Delighting in his new-won prize,<BR>
The darling of his heart and eyes.<BR>
To his chief queen of saintly mind<BR>
The precious treasure he consigned,<BR>
And by her side she saw me grow,<BR>
Nursed with the love which mothers know.'<BR>

<P>
Then as he saw the seasons fly,<BR>
And knew my marriage-time was nigh,<BR>
My sire was vexed with care, as sad<BR>
As one who mourns the wealth he had:<BR>
'Scorn on the maiden's sire must wait<BR>
From men of high and low estate:<BR>
The virgin's father all despise,<BR>
Though Indra's peer, who rules the skies.'<BR>
More near he saw, and still more near,<BR>
The scorn that filled his soul with fear,<BR>
On trouble's billowy ocean tossed,<BR>
Like one whose shattered bark is lost.<BR>
My father knowing how I came,<BR>
No daughter of a mortal dame.<BR>
In all the regions failed to see<BR>
A bridegroom meet to match with me.<BR>
Each way with anxious thought he scanned,<BR>
And thus at length the monarch planned:<BR>
'The Bride's Election will I hold,<BR>
With every rite prescribed of old.'<BR>
It pleased King Varun to bestow<BR>
Quiver and shafts and heavenly bow<BR>
Upon my father's sire who reigned,<BR>
When Daksha his great rite ordained.<BR>
Where was the man might bend or lift<BR>
With utmost toil that wondrous gift?<BR>
Not e'en in dreams could mortal king<BR>
Strain the great bow or draw the string.<BR>
Of this tremendous bow possessed,<BR>
My truthful father thus addressed<BR>
The lords of many a region, all<BR>
Assembled at the monarch's call:<BR>
'Whoe'er this bow can manage, he<BR>
The husband of my child shall be.'<BR>
The suitors viewed with hopeless eyes<BR>
That wondrous bow of mountain size,<BR>
Then to my sire they bade adieu,<BR>
And all with humbled hearts withdrew.<BR>
At length with Vis'v&aacute;mitra came<BR>
This son of Raghu, dear to fame,<BR>
The royal sacrifice to view.<BR>
Near to my father's home he drew,<BR>
His brother Lakshman by his side,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, in deeds heroic tried.<BR>
My sire with honour entertained<BR>
The saint in lore of duty trained,<BR>
Who thus in turn addressed the king:<BR>
'R&aacute;ma and Lakshman here who spring<BR>
From royal Das'aratha, long<BR>
To see thy bow so passing strong.'<BR>

<P>
Before the prince's eyes was laid<BR>
That marvel, as the Br&aacute;hman prayed.<BR>
One moment on the bow he gazed,<BR>
Quick to the notch the string he raised,<BR>
Then, in the wandering people's view,<BR>
The cord with mighty force he drew.<BR>
Then with an awful crash as loud<BR>
As thunderbolts that cleave the cloud,<BR>
The bow beneath the matchless strain<BR>
Of arms heroic snapped in twain.<BR>
Thus, giving purest water, he,<BR>
My sire, to R&aacute;ma offered me.<BR>
The prince the offered gift declined<BR>
Till he should learn his father's mind;<BR>
So horsemen swift Ayodhy&aacute; sought<BR>
And back her aged monarch brought.<BR>
Me then my sire to R&aacute;ma gave,<BR>
Self-ruled, the bravest of the brave.<BR>
And Urmil&aacute;, the next to me,<BR>
Graced with all gifts, most fair to see,<BR>
My sire with Raghu's house allied.<BR>
And gave her to be Lakshman's bride.<BR>
Thus from the princes of the land<BR>
Lord R&aacute;ma won my maiden hand,<BR>
And him exalted high above<BR>
Heroic chiefs I truly love.<BR>
