<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXV.: MALYAV&Aacute;N'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
The fearful notes of drum and shell<BR>
Upon the ear of R&aacute;van fell.<BR>
One moment quailed his haughty look,<BR>
One moment in his fear he shook,<BR>
But soon recalling wonted pride,<BR>
His counsellors he sternly eyed,<BR>
And with a voice that thundered through<BR>
The council had* began anew:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Lords, I have heard--your tongues have told--<BR>
How Raghu's son is fierce and bold.<BR>
To Lank&aacute;'s shore has bridged his way<BR>
And hither leads his wild array.<BR>
I know your might, in battle tried,<BR>
Fighting and conquering by my side.<BR>
Why now, when such a foe is near,<BR>
Looks eye to eye in silent fear?<BR>

<P>
He ceased, his mother's sire well known<BR>
For wisdom in the council shown,<BR>
Malyav&aacute;n *, sage and faithful guide.<BR>
Thus to the monarch's speech replied:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Long reigns the king in safe repose.<BR>
Unmoved by fear of vanquished foes,<BR>
Whose feet* by saving knowledge led<BR>
In justice's* path delight to tread:<BR>
Who knows to sheath the sword or wield,<BR>
To sue for peace*, to strike or yield:<BR>

<P>
Prefers, when foes are stronger, peace,<BR>
And bids a doubtful conflict cease.<BR>
Now, King, the choice before thee lies,<BR>
Make peace with R&aacute;ma, and be wise.<BR>
This day the captive queen restore<BR>
Who brings the foe to Lank&aacute;'s shore.<BR>
The Sire by whom the worlds are swayed<BR>
Of yore the Gods and demons made.<BR>
With these Injustice sided; those<BR>
Fair Justice for her champions chose.<BR>
Still Justice dwells with Gods above;<BR>
Injustice, fiends and giants love.<BR>
Thou, through the worlds that fear thee, long<BR>
Hast scorned the right and loved the wrong,<BR>
And Justice, with thy foes allied,<BR>
Gives might resistless to their side.<BR>
Thou, guided by thy wicked will,<BR>
Hast found delight in deeds of ill,<BR>
And sages in their holy rest*<BR>
Have trembled, by thy power oppressed.<BR>
But they, who check each vain desire,<BR>
Are clothed with might which burns like fire.<BR>
In them the power and glory live<BR>
Which zeal and saintly fervour give.<BR>
Their constant task, their sole delight<BR>
Is worship and each holy rite,<BR>
To chant aloud the Veda hymn,<BR>
Nor let the sacred fire grow dim.<BR>
Now through the air like thunder ring<BR>
The echoes of the chants they sing.<BR>
The vapours of their incense rise<BR>
And, veil with cloudy pall the skies,<BR>
And R&aacute;kshas might grows weak and faint<BR>
Killed by the power of sage and saint.<BR>
By Brahm&aacute;'s boon thy life was screened<BR>
From God, Gandharva, Yaksha *,  fiend;<BR>
But V&aacute;nars, men and bears* arrayed<BR>
Against thee now, thy shores invade.<BR>
Red meteors, heralds of despair<BR>
Flash* frequent through the humid* air,<BR>
Foretelling to my troubled mind<BR>
The ruin of the R&aacute;kshas kind<BR>
With awful thundering overhead<BR>
Clouds black as night are densely spread,<BR>
And oozing* from the gloomy pall<BR>
Great drops of blood on Lank&aacute; fall<BR>
Dogs roam through house and shrine to steal<BR>
The sacred oil * and curd  and meal.<BR>
Cats pair with tigers*, hounds with swine,<BR>
And asses' foals are born of kine.<BR>
In these and countless signs I trace<BR>
The ruin of the giant race,<BR>
'Tis Vishnu's self who comes to storm<BR>
Thy city, clothed in R&aacute;ma's form;<BR>
For, well I ween, no mortal hand<BR>
The ocean with a bridge has spanned.<BR>
O giant King, the dame release,<BR>
And sue to Raghu's son for peace'<BR>
