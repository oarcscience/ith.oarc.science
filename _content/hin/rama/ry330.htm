<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LV.: ANGAD'S REPLY</H3>
<P>
'What truth or justice canst thou find,'<BR>
Cried Angad, 'in Sugr&iacute;va's mind ?<BR>
Where is his high and generous soul,<BR>
His purity and self-control?<BR>
How is he worthy of our trust,<BR>
Righteous, and true, and wise, and just,<BR>
Who, shrinking not from sin and shame,<BR>
Durst take his living brother's dame?<BR>
Who, when, in stress of mortal strife<BR>
His noble brother fought for life,<BR>
Against the valiant warrior barred<BR>
The portal which he stood to guard?<BR>
Can he be grateful--he who took<BR>
The hand of R&aacute;ma, and forsook<BR>
That friend who saved him in his woes,<BR>
To whom his life and fame he owes?<BR>
Ah no! his heart is cold and mean,<BR>
What bids him search for R&aacute;ma's queen?<BR>
Not honour's law, not friendship's debt,<BR>
But angry Lakshman's timely threat.<BR>
No prudent heart will ever place<BR>
Its trust in one so false and base,<BR>
Who heeds not friendship, kith or kin,<BR>
Who scorns the law and cleaves to sin.<BR>
But true or false, whate'er he be,<BR>
One consequence I clearly see;<BR>
Me, in my youth anointed heir<BR>
Against his wish, he will not spare,<BR>
But strike with eager hand the blow<BR>
That rids him of a household foe.<BR>
Shall I of power and friends despoiled,<BR>
In all my purpose crossed and foiled,--<BR>
Shall I Kishkindh&aacute; seek, and wait,<BR>
Like some poor helpless thing, my fate?<BR>
The cruel wretch through lust of sway<BR>
Will seize upon his hapless prey,<BR>
And to a prison's secret gloom<BR>
The remnant of my years will doom.<BR>
'Tis better far to fast and die<BR>
Than hopeless bound in chains to lie,<BR>
Your steps, O V&aacute;nars, homeward bend<BR>
And leave me here my life to end.<BR>
Better to die of hunger here<BR>
Than meet at home the fate I fear<BR>
Go, bow you at Sugr&iacute;va's feet,<BR>
And in my name the monarch greet.<BR>
Before the sons of Raghu bend,<BR>
And give the greeting that I send<BR>
Greet kindly Rum&aacute; too, for she<BR>
A son's affection claims from me,<BR>
And gently calm with friendly care<BR>
My mother T&aacute;r&aacute;'s wild despair;<BR>
Or when she hears her darling's fate<BR>
The queen will die disconsolate.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Angad bade the chiefs adieu:<BR>
Then on the ground his limbs he threw<BR>
Where sacred Darbha &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_762"></A><A HREF="ry331.htm#fn_762"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> grass was spread,<BR>
And wept as every hope had fled.<BR>
The moving words of Augad drew<BR>
Down aged cheeks the piteous dew.<BR>
And, as the chieftains' eyes grew dim,<BR>
They swore to stay and die with him.<BR>
On holy grass whose every blade<BR>
Was duly, pointing southward, laid,<BR>
The V&aacute;nars sat them down and bent<BR>
Their faces to the orient,<BR>
While 'Here, O comrades, let us die<BR>
With Angad,' was the general cry.<BR>
