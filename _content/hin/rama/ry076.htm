<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXVI.: DEBARRED FROM HEAVEN.</H3>
<P>
The haughty challenge, undeterred<BR>
The son of Das'aratha heard,<BR>
And cried, while reverence for his sire<BR>
Checked the full torrent of his ire:<BR>
'Before this day have I been told<BR>
The deed that stained thy hands of old.<BR>
But pity bids my soul forget:<BR>
Thy father, murdered, claimed the debt.<BR>
My strength, O Chief, thou deemest slight,<BR>
Too feeble for a Warrior's might.<BR>
Now will I show thy wondering eyes<BR>
The prowess which they dare despise.'<BR>

<P>
He hastened then with graceful ease<BR>
Tbat mighty bow and shaft to seize.<BR>
His hand the weapon strung and swayed:<BR>
The arrow on the string was laid.<BR>
Then Jamadagni's son he eyed,<BR>
And thus in words of fury cried:<BR>
'Thou art a Br&aacute;hman, still to be<BR>
Most highly honoured, Chief, by me.<BR>
For Visv&aacute;mitra's sake beside<BR>
Shall reverence due be ne'er denied.<BR>
Though mine the power, I would not send<BR>
A dart at thee thy life to end.<BR>
But thy great power to wander free,<BR>
Which penance-rites have won for thee,<BR>
Or glorious worlds from thee to wrest,<BR>
Is the firm purpose of my breast,<BR>
And Vishnu's dart which now I strain<BR>
Can ne'er be shot to fall in vain:<BR>
It strikes the mighty, and it stuns<BR>
The madness of the haughty ones.<BR>

<P>
Then Gods, and saints and heavenly choir<BR>
Preceded by the General Sire,<BR>
Met in the air and gazed below<BR>
On R&aacute;ma with that wondrous bow.<BR>
Nymph, minstrel, angel, all were there,<BR>
Snake-God, and spirit of the air,<BR>
Giant, and bard, and gryphon, met,<BR>
Their eyes upon the marvel set.<BR>
In senseless hush the world was chained<BR>
While R&aacute;ma's hand the bow retained,<BR>
And Jamadagni's son amazed<BR>
And powerless on the hero gazed.<BR>
Then when his swelling heart had shrunk,<BR>
And his proud strength in torpor sunk,<BR>
Scarce his voice ventured, low and weak,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma lotus-eyed, to speak:<BR>
'When long ago I gave away<BR>
The whole broad land to Kas'yap's sway<BR>
He charged me never to remain<BR>
Within the limits of his reign.<BR>
Obedient to my guide's behest<BR>
On earth by night I never rest.<BR>
My choice is made. I will not dim<BR>
Mine honour and be false to him.<BR>
So, son of Raghu, leave me still<BR>
The power to wander where I will,<BR>
And swifter than the thought my flight<BR>
Shall place me on Mahendra's height.<BR>
My mansions of eternal joy.<BR>
By penance won, thou mayst destroy.<BR>
My path to these thy shaft may stay.<BR>
Now to the work! No more delay!<BR>
I know thee Lord of Gods; I know<BR>
Thy changeless might laid Madhu low.<BR>
All other hands would surely fail<BR>
To bend this bow. All hail! all hail!<BR>
See! all the Gods have left the skies<BR>
To bend on thee their eager eyes,<BR>
With whose achievements none compete.<BR>
Whose arm in war no God can meet.<BR>
No shame is mine. I ween, for thou,<BR>
Lord of the Worlds, hast dimmed my brow.<BR>
Now, pious R&aacute;ma, 'tis thy part<BR>
To shoot afar that glorious dart:<BR>
I, when the fatal shaft is shot,<BR>
Will seek that hill and tarry not.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased. The wondrous arrow flew,<BR>
And Jamadagni's offspring knew<BR>
Those glorious worlds to him were barred,<BR>
Once gained by penance long and hard.<BR>
Then straight the airy quarters cleared,<BR>
And the mid regions bright appeared,<BR>
While Gods and saints unnumbered praised<BR>
R&aacute;ma, the mighty bow who raised.<BR>
And Jamadagni's son, o'erawed.<BR>
Extolled his name with highest laud,<BR>

<P>
With reverent steps around him strode,<BR>
Then hastened on his airy road.<BR>
Far from the sight of all he fled,<BR>
And rested on Mahendra's head.<BR>
