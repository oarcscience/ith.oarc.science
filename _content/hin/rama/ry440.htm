<P>
When R&aacute;ma saw each bloody trace<BR>
On King Sugr&iacute;va's limbs and face,<BR>
He cried, while, sorrowing at the view,<BR>
His arms about his friend he threw:<BR>
'Too venturous chieftain, kings like us<BR>
Bring not their lives in peril thus;<BR>
Nor, save when counsel shows the need,<BR>
Attempt so bold, so rash a deed.<BR>
Remember. I, Vibh&iacute;shan all<BR>
Have sorrowed fearing for thy fall.<BR>
O do not--for us all I speak--<BR>
These desperate adventures seek,<BR>
'I could not,' cried Sugr&iacute;va, 'brook<BR>
Upon the giant king to look,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_458"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 458</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Nor challenge to the deadly strife<BR>
The fiend who robbed thee of thy wife.'<BR>
'Now Lakshman, marshal,' R&aacute;ma cried,<BR>
'Our legions where the woods are wide,<BR>
And stand we ready to oppose<BR>
The fury of our giant foes.<BR>
This day our armies shall ascend<BR>
The walls which R&aacute;van's powers defend,<BR>
And floods of R&aacute;kshas blood shall stain<BR>
The streets encumbered with the slain.'<BR>
Down from the peak he came, and viewed<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' ordered multitude.<BR>
Each captain there for battle burned,<BR>
Each fiery eye to Lank&aacute; turned.<BR>
On, where the royal brothers led<BR>
To Lank&aacute;'s walls the legions sped.<BR>
The northern gate, where giant foes<BR>
Swarmed round their monarch, R&aacute;ma chose<BR>
Where he in person might direct<BR>
The battle, and his troops protect.<BR>
What arm but his the post might keep<BR>
Where, strong as he who sways the deep, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_959"></A><A HREF="#fn_959"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Mid thousands armed with bow and mace,<BR>
Stood R&aacute;van mightiest of his race?<BR>
The eastern gate was N&iacute;la's post.<BR>
Where marshalled stood his V&aacute;nar host,<BR>
And Mainda with his troops arrayed,<BR>
And Dwivid stood to lend him aid.<BR>
The southern gate was Angad's care,<BR>
Who ranged his bold battalions there.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n by the port that faced<BR>
The setting sun his legions placed,<BR>
And King Sugr&iacute;va held the wood<BR>
East of the gate where R&aacute;van stood.<BR>
On every side the myriads met,<BR>
And Lank&aacute;'s walls of close beset<BR>
That scarce the roving gale could win<BR>
A passage to the hosts within.<BR>
Loud as the angry ocean's roar<BR>
When wild waves lash the rocky shore,<BR>
Ten thousand thousand throats upsent<BR>
A shout that tore the firmament,<BR>
And Lank&aacute; with each grove and brook<BR>
And tower and wall and rampart shook.<BR>
The giants heard, and were appalled:<BR>
Then Raghu's son to Angad called,<BR>
And, led by kingly duty, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_960"></A><A HREF="#fn_960"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> gave<BR>
This order merciful as brave:<BR>
'Go, Angad, R&aacute;van's presence seek,<BR>
And thus my words of warning speak:<BR>
'How art thou changed and fallen now,<BR>
O Monarch of the giants, thou<BR>
Whose impious fury would not spare<BR>
Saint, nymph, or spirit of the air;<BR>
Whose foot in haughty triumph trod<BR>
On Yaksha, king, and Serpent God:<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
How art thou fallen from thy pride<BR>
Which Brahm&aacute;'s favour fortified!<BR>
With myriads at thy Lank&aacute;'s gate<BR>
I stand my righteous ire to sate,<BR>
And punish thee with sword and flame,<BR>
The tyrant fiend who stole my dame.<BR>
Now show the might, employ the guile,<BR>
O Monarch of the giants' isle,<BR>
Which stole a helpless dame away:<BR>
Call up thy power and strength to-day.<BR>
Once more I warn thee, R&aacute;kshas King,<BR>
This hour the Maithil lady bring,<BR>
And, yielding while there yet is time,<BR>
Seek, suppliant, pardon for the crime,<BR>
Or I will leave beneath the sun<BR>
No living R&aacute;kshas, no, not one.<BR>
In vain from battle wilt thou fly,<BR>
Or borne on pinions seek the sky;<BR>
The hand of R&aacute;ma shall not spare;<BR>
His fiery shaft shall smite thee there.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: and Angad bowed his head;<BR>
Thence like embodied flame be sped,<BR>
And lighted from his airy road<BR>
Within the R&aacute;kshas king's abode.<BR>
There sate, the centre of a ring<BR>
Of counsellors, the giant king.<BR>
Swift through the circle Angad pressed,<BR>
And spoke with fury in his breast:<BR>
'Sent by the lord of Kosal's land,<BR>
His envoy here, O King, I stand,<BR>
Angad the son of B&aacute;li: fame<BR>
Has haply taught thine ears my name.<BR>
Thus in the words of R&aacute;ma I<BR>
Am come to warn thee or defy:<BR>
Come forth, and fighting in the van<BR>
Display the spirit of a man.<BR>
This arm shall slay thee, tyrant: all<BR>
Thy nobles, kith and kin shall fall:<BR>
And earth and heaven, from terror freed,<BR>
Shall joy to see the oppressor bleed,<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan, when his foe is slain,<BR>
Anointed king in peace shall reign.<BR>
Once more I counsel thee: repent,<BR>
Avoid the mortal punishment,<BR>
With honour due the dame restore,<BR>
And pardon for thy sin implore.'<BR>

<P>
Loud rose the king's infuriate cry:<BR>
'Seize, seize the V&aacute;nar, let him lie.'<BR>
Four of his band their lord obeyed,<BR>
And eager hands on Angad laid.<BR>
He purposing his strength to show<BR>
Gave no resistance to the foe,<BR>
But swiftly round his captors cast<BR>
His mighty arms and held them fast.<BR>
Fierce shout and cry around him rang:<BR>
Light to the palace roof he sprang,<BR>
There his detaining arms unwound.<BR>
And hurled the giants to the ground,<BR>
Then, smiting with a fearful stroke,<BR>
A turret from the roof he broke,--<BR>
As when the fiery levin sent<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_459"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 459</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
By Indra from the clouds has rent<BR>
The proud peak of the Lord of Snow,-<BR>
And flung the stony mass below.<BR>
Again with loud terrific cry<BR>
He sprang exulting to the sky,<BR>
And, joyous for his errand done,<BR>
Stood by the side of Raghu's son.<BR>
