<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIV.: R&Aacute;MA SUMMONED.</H3>
<P>
The wicked queen her speech renewed,<BR>
When rolling on the earth she viewed<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's son, Ayodhy&aacute;'s king,<BR>
For his dear R&aacute;ma sorrowing:<BR>
'Why, by a simple promise bound,<BR>
Liest thou prostrate on the ground,<BR>
As though a grievous sin dismayed<BR>
Thy spirit! Why so sore afraid?<BR>
Keep still thy word. The righteous deem<BR>
That truth, mid duties, is supreme:<BR>
And now in truth and honour's name<BR>
I bid thee own the binding claim.<BR>
S'aivya, a king whom earth obeyed,<BR>
Onoe to a hawk a promise made,<BR>
Gave to the bird his flesh and bone,<BR>
And by his truth made heaven his own. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Alarka, when a Br&aacute;hman famed<BR>
For Scripture lore his promise claimed,<BR>
Tore from his head his bleeding eyes<BR>
And unreluctant gave the prize.<BR>
His narrow bounds prescribed restrain<BR>
The Rivers' Lord, the mighty main,<BR>
Who, though his waters boil and rave,<BR>
Keeps faithful to the word he gave.<BR>
Truth all religion comprehends,<BR>
Through all the world its might extends:<BR>
In truth alone is justice placed,<BR>
On truth the words of God are based;<BR>
A life in truth unchanging past<BR>
Will bring the highest bliss at last<BR>
If thou the right would still pursue,<BR>
Be constant to thy word and true:<BR>
Let me thy promise fruitful see,<BR>
For boons, O King, proceed from thee.<BR>
Now to preserve thy righteous fame,<BR>
And yielding to my earnest claim--<BR>
Thrice I repeat it--send thy child,<BR>
Thy R&aacute;ma, to the forest wild.<BR>
But if the boon thou still deny,<BR>
Before thy face, forlorn, I die.'<BR>

<P>
Thus was the helpless monarch stung<BR>
By Queen Kaikey&iacute;'s fearless tongue,<BR>
As Bali strove in vain to loose<BR>
His limbs from Indra's fatal noose.<BR>
Dismayed in soul and pale with fear,<BR>
The monarch, like a trembling steer<BR>
Between the chariot's wheel and yoke,<BR>
Again to Queen Kaikey&iacute; spoke,<BR>
With sad eyes fixt in vacant stare,<BR>
Gathering courage from despair:<BR>
'That hand I took, thou sinful dame,<BR>
With texts, before the sacred flame,<BR>
Thee and thy son, I scorn and hate,<BR>
And all at once repudiate.<BR>


<P>

<P>
The night is fled: the dawn is near:<BR>
Soon will the holy priests be here<BR>
To bid me for the rite prepare<BR>
That with my son the tnrone will share,<BR>
The preparation made to grace<BR>
My R&aacute;ma in his royal place--<BR>
With this, e'en this, my darling for<BR>
My death the funeral flood shall pour.<BR>
Thou and thy son at least forbear<BR>
In offerings to my shade to share,<BR>
For by the plot thy guile has laid<BR>
His consecration will be stayed.<BR>
This very day how shall I brook<BR>
To meet each subject's altered look?<BR>
To mark each gloomy joyless brow<BR>
That was so bright and glad but now?'<BR>

<P>
While thus the high-souled monarch spoke<BR>
To the stern queen, the Morning broke,<BR>
And holy night had slowly fled,<BR>
With moon and stars engarlanded.<BR>
Yet once again the cruel queen<BR>
Spoke words in answer fierce and keen,<BR>
Still on her evil purpose bent,<BR>
Wild with her rage and eloquent:<BR>
'What speech is this? Such words as these<BR>
Seem sprung from poison-sown disease.<BR>
Quick to thy noble R&aacute;ma send<BR>
And bid him on his sire attend.<BR>
When to my son the rule is given;<BR>
When R&aacute;ma to the woods is driven;<BR>
When not a rival copes with me,<BR>
From chains of duty thou art free.'<BR>

<P>
Thus goaded, like a generous steed<BR>
Urged by sharp spurs to double speed,<BR>
'My senses are astray,' he cried,<BR>
'And duty's bonds my hands have tied.<BR>
I long to see mine eldest son,<BR>
My virtuous, my beloved one.'<BR>

<P>
And now the night had past away;<BR>
Out shone the Maker of the Day,<BR>
Bringing the planetary hour<BR>
And moment of auspicious power.<BR>
Vas'ishtha, virtuous, far renowned,<BR>
Whose young disciples girt him round,<BR>
With sacred things without delay<BR>
Through the fair city took his way.<BR>
He traversed, where the people thronged.<BR>
And all for R&aacute;ma's coming longed,<BR>
The town as fair in festive show<BR>
As his who lays proud cities low. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
He reached the palace where he heard<BR>
The mingled notes of many a bird,<BR>
Where crowded thick high-honoured bands<BR>
Of guards with truncheons in their hands.<BR>
Begirt by many a sage, elate,<BR>
Vas'ishtha reached the royal gate,<BR>


<P>


<P>
And standing by the door he found<BR>
Sumantra, for his form renowned,<BR>
The king's illustrious charioteer<BR>
And noble counsellor and peer.<BR>
To him well skilled in every part<BR>
Of his hereditary art<BR>
Vas'ishtha said: 'O charioteer,<BR>
Inform the king that I am here,<BR>
Here ready by my side behold<BR>
These sacred vessels made of gold,<BR>
Which water for the rite contain<BR>
From Gang&aacute; and each distant main.<BR>
Here for installing I have brought<BR>
The seat prescribed of fig-wood wrought,<BR>
All kinds of seed and precious scent<BR>
And many a gem and ornament;<BR>
Grain, sacred grass, the garden's spoil,<BR>
Honey and curds and milk and oil;<BR>
Eight radiant maids, the best of all<BR>
War elephants that feed in stall;<BR>
A four-horse car, a bow and sword.<BR>
A litter, men to bear their lord;<BR>
A white umbrella bright and fair<BR>
That with the moon may well compare;<BR>
Two chouries of the whitest hair;<BR>
A golden beaker rich and rare;<BR>
A bull high-humped and fair to view,<BR>
Girt with gold bands and white of hue;<BR>
A four-toothed steed with flowing mane,<BR>
A throne which lions carved sustain;<BR>
A tiger's skin, the sacred fire,<BR>
Fresh kindled, which the rites require;<BR>
The best musicians skilled to play,<BR>
And dancing-girls in raiment gay;<BR>
Kine, Br&aacute;hmans, teachers fill the court,<BR>
And bird and beast of purest sort.<BR>
From town and village, far and near,<BR>
The noblest men are gathered here;<BR>
Here merchants with their followers crowd,<BR>
And men in joyful converse loud,<BR>
And kings from many a distant land<BR>
To view the consecration stand.<BR>
The dawn is come, the lucky day;<BR>
Go bid the monarch haste away,<BR>
That now Prince R&aacute;ma may obtain<BR>
The empire, and begin his reign.'<BR>

<P>
Soon as he heard the high behest<BR>
The driver of the chariot pressed<BR>
Within the chambers of the king,<BR>
His lord with praises honouring.<BR>
And none of all the warders checked<BR>
His entrance for their great respect<BR>
Of him well known, in place so high,<BR>
Still fain their king to gratify.<BR>
He stood beside the royal chief,<BR>
Unwitting of his deadly grief,<BR>
And with sweet words began to sing<BR>
The praises of his lord and king:<BR>
'As, when the sun begins to rise,<BR>
The sparkling sea delights our eyes,<BR>
Wake, calm with gentle soul, and thus<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Give rapture, mighty King, to us.<BR>
As M&aacute;tali &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> this selfsame hour<BR>
Sang lauds of old to Indra's power,<BR>
When he the Titan hosts o'erthrew,<BR>
So hymn I thee with praises due.<BR>
The Vedas, with their kindred lore,<BR>
Brahma their soul-born Lord adore,<BR>
With all the doctrines of the wise,<BR>
And bid him, as I bid thee, rise.<BR>
As, with the moon, the Lord of Day<BR>
Wakes with the splendour of his ray<BR>
Prolific Earth, who neath him lies,<BR>
So, mighty King, I bid thee rise.<BR>
With blissful words, O Lord of men,<BR>
Rise, radiant in thy form, as when<BR>
The sun ascending darts his light<BR>
From Meru's everlasting height.<BR>
May &#140;iva, Agni, Sun, and Moon<BR>
Bestow on thee each choicest boon,<BR>
Kuvera, Varun, Indra bless<BR>
Kakutstha's son with all success.<BR>
Awake, the holy night is fled,<BR>
The happy light abroad is spread;<BR>
Awake, O best of kings, and share<BR>
The glorious task that claims thy care.<BR>
The holy sage Va&#156;ishtha waits,<BR>
With all his Br&aacute;hmans, at the gate<BR>
Give thy decree, without delay,<BR>
To consecrate thy son today.<BR>
As armies, by no captain led,<BR>
As flocks that feed unshepherded,<BR>
Such is the fortune of a state<BR>
Without a king and desolate.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Such were the words the bard addressed,<BR>
With weight of sage advice impressed;<BR>
And, as he heard, the hapless king<BR>
Felt deeper yet his sorrow's sting.<BR>
At length, all joy and comfort fled,<BR>
He raised his eyes with weeping red,<BR>
And, mournful for his R&aacute;ma's sake.<BR>
The good and glorious monarch spake:<BR>
'Why seek with idle praise to greet<BR>
The wretch for whom no praise is meet!<BR>
Thy words mine aching bosom tear,<BR>
And plunge me deeper in despair.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sumantra heard the sad reply,<BR>
And saw his master's tearful eye.<BR>
With reverent palm to palm applied<BR>
He drew a little space aside.<BR>
Then, as the king, with misery weak,<BR>
With vain endeavour strove to speak,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;, skilled in plot and plan,<BR>
To sage Sumantra thus began:<BR>
'The king, absorbed in joyful thought<BR>
For his dear son, no rest has sought:<BR>
Sleepless to him the night has past,<BR>
And now o'erwatched he sinks at last<BR>
Then go, Sumantra, and with speed<BR>

<P>

<P>
The glorious R&aacute;ma hither lead:<BR>
Go, as I pray, nor longer wait;<BR>
No time is this to hesitate.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'How can I go, O Ladv fair,<BR>
Unless my lord his will declare?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Fain would I see him,' cried the king,<BR>
'Quick, quick, my beauteous R&aacute;ma bring.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then rose the happy thought to cheer<BR>
The bosom of the charioteer,<BR>
'The king, I ween, of pious mind.<BR>
The consecration has designed.'<BR>
Sumantra for his wisdom famed,<BR>
Delighted with the thought he framed,<BR>
From the calm chamber, like a bay<BR>
Of crowded ocean, took his way.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He turned his face to neither side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   But forth he hurried straight;<BR>
Only a little while he eyed<BR>
The guards who kept the gate.<BR>
He saw in front a gathered crowd<BR>
&nbsp; Of men of every class,<BR>
Who, parting as he came, allowed<BR>
&nbsp; The charioteer to pass.<BR>
