<P>
'False are they all, proved false to-day,<BR>
The prophets of my fortune, they<BR>
Who in the tranquil time of old<BR>
A blessed life for me foretold,<BR>
Predicting I should never know<BR>
A childless dame's, a widow's woe,<BR>
False are they all, their words are vain.<BR>
For thou, my lord and life, art slain.<BR>
False was the priest and vain his lore<BR>
Who blessed me in those days of yore<BR>
By R&aacute;ma's side in bliss to reign:<BR>
For thou, my lord and life, art slain.<BR>
They hailed me happy from my birth,<BR>
Proud empress of the lord of earth.<BR>
They blessed me--but the thought is pain--<BR>
For thou, my lord and life, art slain.<BR>
Ah, fruitless hope! each glorious sign<BR>
That stamps the future queen is mine,<BR>
With no ill-omened mark to show<BR>
A widow's crushing hour of woe.<BR>
They say my hair is black and fine,<BR>
They praise my brows' continuous line;<BR>
My even teeth divided well.<BR>
My bosom for its graceful swell.<BR>
They praise my feet and fingers oft;<BR>
They say my skin is smooth and soft,<BR>
And call me happy to possess<BR>
The twelve fair marks that bring success. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_965"></A><A HREF="#fn_965"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
But ah, what profit shall I gain?<BR>
Thou, O my lord and life, art slain.<BR>
The flattering seer in former days<BR>
My gentle girlish smile would praise,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_463"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 463</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And swear that holy water shed<BR>
By Br&aacute;hman hands upon my head<BR>
Should make me queen, a monarch's bride:<BR>
How is the promise verified?<BR>
Matchless in might the brothers slew<BR>
In Janasth&aacute;n the giant crew,<BR>
And forced the indomitable sea<BR>
To let them pass to rescue me.<BR>
Theirs was the fiery weapon hurled<BR>
By him who rules the watery world; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_966"></A><A HREF="#fn_966"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Theirs the dire shaft by Indra sped;<BR>
Theirs was the mystic Brahm&aacute;'s Head. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_967"></A><A HREF="#fn_967"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
In vain they fought, the bold and brave:<BR>
A coward's hand their death-wounds gave.<BR>
By secret shafts and magic spell<BR>
The brothers, peers of Indra, fell.<BR>
That foe, if seen by R&aacute;ma's eye<BR>
One moment, had not lived to fly.<BR>
Though swift as thought, his utmost speed<BR>
Had failed him in the hour of need.<BR>
No might, no tear, no prayer may stay<BR>
Fate's dark inevitable day.<BR>
Nor could their matchless valour shield<BR>
These heroes on the battle field.<BR>
I sorrow for the noble dead,<BR>
I mourn my hopes for ever fled;<BR>
But chief my weeping eyes o'erflow<BR>
For Queen Kaus'aly&aacute;'s hopeless woe.<BR>
The widowed queen is counting now<BR>
Each hour prescribed by R&aacute;ma's vow,<BR>
And lives because she longs to see<BR>
Once more her princely sons and me.'<BR>

<P>
Then Trijat&aacute;, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_968"></A><A HREF="#fn_968"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of gentler mould<BR>
Though R&aacute;kshas born, her grief consoled:<BR>
'Dear Queen, thy causeless woe dispel:<BR>
Thy husband lives, and all is well.<BR>
Look round: in every V&aacute;nar face<BR>
The light of joyful hope I trace.<BR>
Not thus, believe me, shine the eyes<BR>
Of warriors when their leader dies.<BR>
An Army, when the chief is dead,<BR>
Flies from the field dispirited.<BR>
Here, undisturbed in firm array,<BR>
The V&aacute;nars by the brothers stay.<BR>
Love prompts my speech; no longer grieve;<BR>
Ponder my counsel, and believe.<BR>
These lips of mine from earliest youth<BR>
Have spoken, and shall speak, the truth.<BR>
Deep in my heart thy gentle grace<BR>
And patient virtues hold their place.<BR>
Turn, lady, turn once more thine eye:<BR>
Though pierced with shafts the heroes lie,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
On brows and cheeks with blood-drops wet<BR>
The light of beauty lingers yet.<BR>
Such beauty ne'er is found in death,<BR>
But vanishes with parting breath.<BR>
O, trust the hope these tokens give:<BR>
The heroes are not dead, but live.'<BR>

<P>
Then S&iacute;t&aacute; joined her hands, and sighed,<BR>
'O, may thy words be verified!'<BR>
The car was turned, which fleet as thought<BR>
The mourning queen to Lank&aacute; brought.<BR>
They led her to the garden, where<BR>
Again she yielded to despair,<BR>
Lamenting for the chiefs who bled<BR>
On earth's cold bosom with the dead.<BR>
