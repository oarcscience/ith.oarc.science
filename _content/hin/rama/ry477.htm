<P>
Then Raghu's son forgot his woe;<BR>
Again he grasped his fallen bow<BR>
And hurled at Lank&aacute;'s lord amain<BR>
The tempest of his arrowy rain.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Drawn by the steeds his lords had brought,<BR>
Again the giant turned and fought.<BR>
And drove his glittering chariot nigh<BR>
As springs the Day-God through the sky.<BR>
Then, as his sounding bow he bent,<BR>
Like thunderbolts his shafts were sent,<BR>
As when dark clouds in rain time shed<BR>
Fierce torrents on a mountain's head.<BR>
High on his car the giant rode,<BR>
On foot the son of Raghu strode.<BR>
The Gods from their celestial height<BR>
Indignant saw the unequal fight.<BR>
Then he whom heavenly hosts revere,<BR>
Lord Indra, called his charioteer:<BR>

<P>
'Haste, Matali,' he cried,'descend;<BR>
To Raghu's son my chariot lend.<BR>
With cheering words the chief address;<BR>
And all the Gods thy deed will bless.'<BR>

<P>
He bowed; he brought the glorious car<BR>
Whose tinkling bells were heard afar;<BR>
Fair as the sun of morning, bright<BR>
With gold and pearl and lazulite<BR>
He yoked the steeds of tawny hue<BR>
That swifter than the tempest flew.<BR>
Then down the slope of heaven he hied<BR>
And stayed the car by R&aacute;ma's side.<BR>
'Ascend, O Chief.' he humbly cried,<BR>
'The chariot which the Gods provide.<BR>
The mighty bow of Indra see,<BR>
Sent by the Gods who favour thee;<BR>
Behold this coat of glittering mail,<BR>
And spear and shafts which never fail.'<BR>

<P>
Cheered by the grace the Immortals showed<BR>
The chieftain on the chariot rode.<BR>
Then as the car-borne warriors met<BR>
The awful fight raged fiercer yet.<BR>
Each shaft that R&aacute;van shot became<BR>
A serpent red with kindled flame,<BR>
And round the limbs of R&aacute;ma hung<BR>
With fiery jaws and quivering tongue.<BR>
But every serpent fled dismayed<BR>
When Raghu's valiant son displayed<BR>
The weapon of the Feathered King, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1019"></A><A HREF="#fn_1019"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And loosed his arrows from the string.<BR>
But R&aacute;van armed his bow anew,<BR>
And showers of shafts at R&aacute;ma flew,<BR>
While the fierce king in swift career<BR>
Smote with a dart the charioteer.<BR>
An arrow shot by R&aacute;van's hand<BR>
Laid the proud banner on the sand,<BR>
And Indra's steeds of heavenly strain<BR>
Fell by the iron tempest slain.<BR>
On Gods and spirits of the air<BR>
Fell terror, trembling, and despair.<BR>
The sea's white billows mounted high<BR>

<P>

<P>
With froth and foam to drench the sky.<BR>
The sun by lurid clouds was veiled,<BR>
The friendly lights of heaven were paled;<BR>
And, fiercely gleaming, fiery Mars<BR>
Opposed the beams of gentler stars.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma's eyes with fury blazed<BR>
As Indra's heavenly spear he raised.<BR>
Loud rang the bells: the glistering head<BR>
Bright flashes through the region shed.<BR>
Down came the spear in swift descent:<BR>
The giant's lance was crushed and bent.<BR>
Then R&aacute;van's horses brave and fleet<BR>
Fell dead beneath his arrowy sleet.<BR>
Fierce on his foeman R&aacute;ma pressed,<BR>
And gored with shafts his mighty breast.<BR>
And spouting streams of crimson dyed<BR>
The weary giant's limbs and side. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1020"></A><A HREF="ry478.htm#fn_1020"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
