<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVII.: TRIJAT&Aacute;'S DREAM.</H3>
<P>
Their threats unfeared, their counsel spurned,<BR>
The demons' breasts with fury burned.<BR>
Some sought the giant king to bear<BR>
The tale of Sita's fixt despair.<BR>
With threats and taunts renewed the rest<BR>
Around the weeping lady pressed.<BR>
But Trijat&aacute;, of softer mould,<BR>
A R&aacute;kshas matron wife and old,<BR>
With pity for the captive moved,<BR>
In words like these the fiends reproved:<BR>
"Me, me,' she cried,'eat me, but spare<BR>
The spouse of Das'aratha's heir<BR>
Last night I dreamt a dream; and still<BR>
The fear and awe my bosom chill;<BR>
For in that dream I saw foreshown,<BR>
Our race by R&aacute;ma's hand o'erthrown.<BR>
I saw a chariot high in the air,<BR>
Of ivory exceeding fair.<BR>
A hundred steeds that chariot drew<BR>
As swiftly through the clouds it flew,<BR>
And, clothed in white, with wreaths that shone,<BR>
The sons of Raghu rode thereon,<BR>
I looked and saw this lady here,<BR>
Clad in the purest white, appear<BR>
High on the snow white hill whose feet<BR>
The angry waves of ocean beat.<BR>
And she and R&aacute;ma met at last<BR>
Like light and sun when night is past,<BR>
Again I saw them side by side.<BR>
On R&aacute;van's car they seemed to ride,<BR>
And with the princely Lakshman flee<BR>
To northern realms beyond the sea.<BR>

Then R&aacute;van, shaved and shorn, besmeared<BR>
With oil from head to foot, appeared.<BR>
He quaffed, he raved: his robes were red:<BR>
Fierce was his eye, and bare his head.<BR>
I saw him from his chariot thrust;<BR>
I saw him rolling in the dust.<BR>
A woman came and dragged away<BR>
The stricken giant where he lay,<BR>
And on a car which asses drew<BR>
The monarch of our race she threw,<BR>
He rose erect, he danced and laughed,<BR>
With thirsty lips the oil he quaffed,<BR>
Then with wild eyes and streaming mouth<BR>
Sped on the chariot to the south. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_849"></A><A HREF="ry370.htm#fn_849"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Then, dropping oil from every limb,<BR>
His sons the princes followed him,<BR>
And Kumbhakarna, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_850"></A><A HREF="ry370.htm#fn_850"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> shaved and shorn,<BR>
Was southward on a camel borne.<BR>
Then royal Lank&aacute; reeled and fell<BR>
With gate and tower and citadel,<BR>
This ancient city, far-renowned:<BR>
All life within her walls was drowned;<BR>
And the wild waves of ocean rolled<BR>
O'er Lank&aacute; and her streets of gold.<BR>
Warned by these signs I bid you fly;<BR>
Or by the hand of R&aacute;ma die,<BR>
Whose vengeance will not spare the life<BR>
Of one who vexed his faithful wife.<BR>
Your bitter taunts and threats forgo:<BR>
Comfort the lady in her woe,<BR>
And humbly pray her to forgive;<BR>
For so you may be spared and live,'<BR>
