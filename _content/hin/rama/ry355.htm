<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIII.: DESPAIR AND HOPE.</H3>
<P>
Then rapid as the lightning's flame<BR>
From R&aacute;van's halls the V&aacute;nar came<BR>
Each lingering hope was cold and dead,<BR>
And thus within his heart he said:<BR>
'Alas, my fruitless search is done:<BR>
Long have I toiled for Raghu's son;<BR>
And yet with all my care have seen<BR>
No traces of the ravished queen.<BR>
It may be, while the giant through<BR>
The lone air with his captive flew,<BR>
The Maithil lady, tender-souled,<BR>
Slipped struggling from the robber's hold,<BR>
And the wild sea is rolling now<BR>
O'er S&iacute;t&aacute; of the beauteous brow.<BR>
Or did she perish of alarm<BR>
When circled by the monster's arm?<BR>
Or crushed, unable to withstand<BR>
The pressure of that monstrous hand?<BR>
Or when she spurned his suit with scorn,<BR>
Her tender limbs were rent and torn.<BR>
And she, her virtue unsubdued,<BR>
Was slaughtered for the giant's food.<BR>
Shall I to Raghu's son relate<BR>
His well-beloved consort's fate,<BR>
My crime the same if I reveal<BR>
The mournful story or conceal?<BR>
If with no happier tale to tell<BR>
I seek our mountain citadel,<BR>
How shall I face our lord the king,<BR>
And meet his angry questioning?<BR>
How shall I greet my friends, and brook<BR>
The muttered taunt, the scornful look?<BR>
How to the son of Raghu go<BR>
And kill him with my tale of woe?<BR>
For sure the mournful tale I bear<BR>
Will strike him dead with wild despair.<BR>
And Lakshman ever fond and true,<BR>
Will, undivided, perish too.<BR>
Bharat will learn his brother's fate,<BR>
And die of grief disconsolate,<BR>
And sad Satrughna with a cry<BR>
Of anguish on his corpse will die.<BR>
Our king Sugr&iacute;var found;<BR>
True to each bond in honour bound.<BR>
Will mourn the pledge he vainly gave,<BR>
And die with him he could not save.<BR>
Then Rum&aacute; his devoted wife<BR>
For her dead lord will leave her life,<BR>
And T&aacute;ra, widowed and forlorn,<BR>
Will die in anguish, sorrow-worn.<BR>

<P>
On Angad too the blow will fall<BR>
Killing the hope and joy of all.<BR>
The ruin of their prince and king<BR>
The V&aacute;narsls with woe will wring,<BR>
And each, overwhelmed with dark despair,<BR>
Will beat his head and rend his hair.<BR>
Each, graced and honoured long, will miss<BR>
His careless life of easy bliss,<BR>
In happy troops will play no more<BR>
On breezy rock and shady shore,<BR>
But with his darling wife and child<BR>
Will seek the mountain top, and wild<BR>
With hopeless desolation, throw<BR>
Himself, his wife, and babe, below.<BR>
All no: unless the dame I find<BR>
I ne'er will meet my V&aacute;nar,<BR>
Here rather in some distant dell<BR>
A lonely hermit will I dwell,<BR>
Where roots and berries will supply<BR>
My humble wants until I die;<BR>
Or on the shore will raise a pyre<BR>
And perish in the kindled fire.<BR>
Or I will strictly fast until<BR>
With slow decay my life I kill,<BR>
And ravening dogs and birds of air<BR>
The limbs of Hanum&aacute;nl tear.<BR>
Here will I die, but never bring<BR>
Destruction on my race and king.<BR>
But still unsearched one grove I see<BR>
With many a bright As'oka tree.<BR>
There will I enter in, and through<BR>
The tangled shade my search renew.<BR>
Be glory to the host on high,<BR>
The Sun and Moon who light the sky,<BR>
The Vasus &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_822"></A><A HREF="ry356.htm#fn_822"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the Maruts' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_823"></A><A HREF="ry356.htm#fn_823"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> train,<BR>
&Aacute;dityas &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_824"></A><A HREF="ry356.htm#fn_824"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the As'vins &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_825"></A><A HREF="ry356.htm#fn_825"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> twain.<BR>
So may I win success, and bring<BR>
The lady back with triumphing,'<BR>
