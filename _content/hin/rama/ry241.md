### CANTO XLIII.: THE WONDROUS DEER.

She stooped, her hands with flowers to fill,  
But gazed upon the marvel still:  
Gazed on its back and sparkling side  
Where silver hues with golden vied.  
Joyous was she of faultless mould,  
With glossy skin like polished gold.  
And loudly to her husband cried  
And bow-armed Lakshman by his side:  
Again, again she called in glee:  
'O come this glorious creature see;  
Quick, quick, my lord, this deer to view.  
And bring thy brother Lakshman too.'  
As through the wood her clear tones rang,  
Swift to her side the brothers sprang.  
With eager eyes the grove they scanned,  
And saw the deer before them stand.  
But doubt was strong in Lakshman's breast,  
Who thus his thought and fear expressed:  
   'Stay, for the wondrous deer we see  
The fiend Márícha's self may be.  
Ere now have kings who sought this place  
To take their pastime in the chase,  
Met from his wicked art defeat,  
And fallen slain by like deceit.  
He wears, well trained in magio guile,  
The figure of a deer a while,  
Bright as the very sun, or place  
Where dwell the gay Gaudharya race.  
No deer, O Ráma, e'er was seen  
Thus decked with gold und jewels' sheen.  
'Tis magic, for the world has ne'er,  
Lord of the world, shown aught so fair.'  
   But Sítá of the lovely smile,  
A captive to the giant's wile,  
Turned Lakshman's prudent speech aside  
And thus with eager words replied:  
Mv honoured lord, this deer I see  
With beauty rare enraptures me.  
Go, chief of mighty arm, and bring  
For my delight this precious thing.  
Fair creatures ot the woodland roam  
Untroubled near our hermit home.  
The forest cow and stag are there,  
The fawn, the monkey, and the bear,  
Where spotted deer delight to play,

And strong and beauteous Kinnars  <span id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_495)
stray.  
But never, as they wandered by,  
Has such a beauty charmed mine eye  
As this with limbs so fair and slight,  
So gentle, beautiful and bright.  
O see, how fair it is to view  
With jewels of each varied hue:  
Bright as the rising moon it glows,  
Lighting the wood where'er it goes.  
Ah me, what form and grace are there!  
Its limbs how fine, its hues how fair!  
Transcending all that words express,  
It takes my soul with loveliness.  
O, if thou would, to please me, strive  
To take the beauteous thing alive,  
How thou wouldst gaze with wondering eyes  
Delighted on the lovely prize!  
And when our woodland life is o'er,  
And we enjoy our realm once more,  
The wondrous animal will grace  
The chambers of my dwelling-place,  
And a dear treasure will it be  
To Bharat and the queens and me,  
And all with rapture and amaze  
Upon its heavenly form will gaze.  
But if the beauteous deer, pursued,  
Thine arts to take it still elude,  
Strike it, O chieftain, and the akin  
Will be a treasure, laid within.  
O, how I long my time to pass  
Sitting upon the tender grass,  
With that soft fell beneath me spread  
Bright with its hair of golden thread!  
This strong desire, this eager will,  
Befits a gentle lady ill:  
But when I first beheld, its look  
My breast with fascination took.  
See, golden hair its flank adorns,  
And sapphires tip its branching horns.  
Resplendent as the lunar way,  
Or the first blush of opening day,  
With graceful form and radiant hue  
It charmed thy heart, O chieftain, too.'  
   He heard her speech with willing ear,  
He looked again upon the deer.  
Its lovely shape his breast beguiled  
Moved by the prayer of Janak's child,  
And yielding for her pleasure's sake,  
To Lakshman Ráma turned and spake:  
   'Mark, Lakshman, mark how Sítá's breast  
With eager longing is possessed.  
To-day this deer of wondrous breed  
Must for his passing beauty bleed,  
Brighter than e'er in Nandan strayed,  
Or Chaitraratha's heavenly shade.  

How should the groves of earth possess  
Such all-surpassing loveliness!  
The hair lies smooth and bright and fine,  
Or waves upon each curving line,  
And drops of living gold bedeck  
The beauty of his side and neck.  
O look, his crimson tongue between  
His teeth like flaming fire is seen,  
Flashing, whene'er his lips he parts,  
As from a cloud the lightning darts.  
O see his sunlike forehead shine  
With emerald tints and almandine,  
While pearly light and roseate glow  
Of shells adorn his neck below.  
No eye on such a deer can rest  
But soft enchantment takes the breast:  
No man so fair a thing behold  
Ablaze with light of radiant gold.  
Celestial, bright with jewels' sheen,  
Nor marvel when his eyes have seen,  
A king equipped with bow and shaft  
Delights in gentle forest craft,  
And as in boundless woods he strays  
The quarry for the venison slays.  
There as he wanders with his train  
A store of wealth he oft may gain.  
He claims by right the precious ore.  
He claims the jewels' sparkling store.  
Such gains are dearer in his eyes  
Than wealth that in his chamber lies.  
The dearest things his spirit knows,  
Dear as the bliss which Sukra chose.  
But oft the rich expected gain  
Which heedless men pursue in vain.  
The sage, who prudent counsels know,  
Explain and in a moment show.  
This best of deer, this gem of all,  
To yield his precious spoils must fall,  
And tender Sítá by my side  
Shall sit upon the golden hide.  
Ne'er could I find so rich a coat  
On spotted deer or sheep or goat.  
No buck or antelope has such,  
So bright to view, so soft to touch.  
This radiant deer and one on high  
That moves in glory through the sky,  
Alike in heavenly beauty are,  
One on the earth and one a star.  
But, brother, if thy fears be true,  
And this bright creature that we view  
Be fierce Márícha in disguise,  
Then by this hand he surely dies.  
For that dire fiend who spurns control  
With bloody hand and cruel soul,  
Has roamed this forest and dismayed  
The holiest saints who haunt the shade.  
Great archers, sprung of royal race.  
Pursuing in the wood the chase,  
Have fallen by his wicked art,  
And now my shaft shall strike his heart.  
Vatápi, by his magic power  

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>  

Made heedless saints his flesh devour,  
Then, from within their frames he rent  
Forth bursting from imprisonment,  
But once his art in senseless pride  
Upon the mightiest saint he tried,  
Agastya's self, and caused him taste  
The baited meal before him placed.  
Vátápi, when the rite\* was o'er,  
Would take the giant form he wore,  
But Saint Agastya knew his wile  
And checked the giant with smile  
'Vatápi, thou with cruel spite  
Hast conquered many an achorite  
The noblest of the Brahman ask\*--  
And now thy ruin comes at last'  
Now if my power he thus defies,  
This giant, like Vatápi dies,  
Daring to scorn a man like me,  
A self subduing devotee.  
Yea, as Agastya slew the foe,  
My hand shall lay Mancha low  
Clad in thine arms thy bow in hand,  
To guard the Maithil lady stand,  
With watchful eye and thoughtful breast  
Keeping each word of my behest  
I go, and hunting through the brake  
This wondrous deer will bring or take.  
Yea surely I will bring the spoil  
Returning from my hunter's toil  
See, Lakshman how my contort's eyes  
Are longing for the lovely prize  
This day it falls, that I may win  
The treasure of so fair a skin.  
Do thou and Sítá watch with care  
Lest danger seize you unaware.  
Swift from my bow one shaft will fly;  
The stricken deer will fall and die  
Then quickly will I stop the game  
And bring the trophy to my dame.  
   Jatavus, guardian good and wise,  
     Our old and faithful friend,  
   The best and strongest bird that flies,  
     His willing aid will lend  
   The Maithil lady well protect,  
     For every chance provide,  
   And in thy tender care suspect  
     A foe on every side.
