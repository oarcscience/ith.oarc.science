Then spake Vasishtha who perceived<BR>
That R&aacute;ma's soul was wroth and grieved:<BR>

<P>

<P>
' Well knows the sage J'av'ali all<BR>
The changes that the world befall;<BR>
And but to lead thee to revoke<BR>
Thy purpose were the words he spoke.<BR>
Lord of the world, now hear from me<BR>
How first this world began to be.<BR>
First water was, and naught beside;<BR>
There earth was formed that stretches wide.<BR>
Then with the Gods from out the same<BR>
The Self-existent Brahm'a came.<BR>
Then Brahm'a &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_390"></A><A HREF="#fn_390"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> in a boar's disguise<BR>
Bade from the deep this earth arise;<BR>
Then, with his sons of tranquil soul,<BR>
He made the world and framed the whole,<BR>
From subtlest ether Brahm'a rose:<BR>
No end, no loss, no change he knows.<BR>
A son had he, Mar'ichi styled,<BR>
And Ka'syap was Mar'ichi's child.<BR>
From him Vivasvat sprang: from him<BR>
Manu, whose fame shall ne'er be dim.<BR>
Manu, who life to mortals gave,<BR>
Begot Ikshv'aku good and brave:<BR>
First of Ayodhya's kings was he,<BR>
Pride of her famous dynasty.<BR>
From him the glorious Kukshi sprang,<BR>
Whose fame through all the regions rang,<BR>
Rival of Kukshi's ancient fame.<BR>
His heir the great Vikukshi came.<BR>
His son was V'ana, lord of might,<BR>
His Anaranya, strong in fight.<BR>
No famine marred his blissful reign,<BR>
No drought destroyed the kindly grain;<BR>
Amid the sons of virtue chief,<BR>
His happy realm ne'er held a thief,<BR>
His son was Prithn, glorious name,<BR>
From him the wise Tri'sanku came:<BR>
Embodied to the skies he went<BR>
For love of truth preeminent.<BR>
He left a son renowned afar,<BR>
Known by the name of Dhundhum'ar,<BR>
His son succeeding bore the name<BR>
Of Yuvan'as'va dear to fame.<BR>
He passed away. Him followed then<BR>
His son M'andh'at'a, king of men.<BR>
His son was blest in high emprise,<BR>
Susandhi, fortunate and wise.<BR>
Two noble sons had he, to wit<BR>
Dhruvasandhi and Prasenajit,<BR>
Bharat was Dhruvasandhi's son:<BR>
His glorious arm the conquest won,<BR>
Against his son King Asit, rose<BR>
In fierce array his royal foes,<BR>
Haihayas, T'alajanghas styled,<BR>
And S'as'ivindhus fierce and wild.<BR>

Long time he strove, but forced to yield<BR>
Fled from his kingdom and the field.<BR>
The wives he left had both conceived--<BR>
So is the ancient tale believed:--<BR>
One, of her rival's hopes afraid,<BR>
Fell poison in the viands laid.<BR>
It chanced that Chyavan, Bhrigu's child,<BR>
Had wandered to the pathless wild<BR>
Where proud Hima'laya's lovely height<BR>
Detained him with a strange delight.<BR>
Then came the other widowed queen<BR>
With lotus eyes and beauteous mien,<BR>
Longing a noble son to bear,<BR>
And wooed the saint with earnest prayer.<BR>
When thus Kal'indi', fairest dame<BR>
With reverent supplication came,<BR>
To her the holy sage replied:<BR>
'O royal lady, from thy side<BR>
A glorious son shall spring ere long,<BR>
Righteous and true and brave and strong;<BR>
He, scourge of foes and lofty-souled,<BR>
His ancient race shall still uphold.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then round the sage the lady went,<BR>
And bade farewell, most reverent.<BR>
Back to her home she turned once more,<BR>
And there her promised son she bore.<BR>
Because her rival mixed the bane<BR>
To render her conception vain,<BR>
And her unripened fruit destroy,<BR>
Sagar she called her rescued boy.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_391"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
He, when he paid that solemn rite,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Filled living creatures with affright:<BR>
Obedient to his high decree<BR>
His countless sons dug out the sea.<BR>
Prince Asamanj was Sagar's child:<BR>
But him with cruel sin defiled<BR>
And loaded with the people's hate<BR>
His father banished from the state.<BR>
To Asamanj his consort bare<BR>
Bright Ans'uma'n his valiant heir.<BR>
Ans'uma'n's son, Dili'pa famed,<BR>
Begot a son Bhagi'rath named.<BR>
From him renowned Kakutstha came:<BR>
Thou bearest still the lineal name,<BR>
Kakutstha's son was Raghu: thou<BR>
Art styled the son of Raghu now,<BR>
From him came Purusha'dak bold,<BR>
Fierce hero of gigantic mould:<BR>
Kalma'shapa'da s name he bore,<BR>
Because his feet were spotted o'er.<BR>
Sankhan his son, to manhood grown,<BR>
Died sadly with his host o'erthrown,<BR>
But ere he perished sprang from him<BR>
Sudars'an fair in face and limb.<BR>
From beautiful Sudarsa'n came<BR>
Prince Agnivarna, bright as flame.<BR>
His son was S'ighragn, for speed<BR>
Unmatched; and Maru was his seed.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Prasusruka was Maru's child:<BR>
His son was Ambari'sha styled.<BR>
Nahush was Ambari'sha's heir<BR>
With hand to strike and heart to dare.<BR>
His son was good Na'bha'g, from youth<BR>
Renowned for piety and truth.<BR>
From great Na'bha'g sprang children two<BR>
Aja and Suvrat pure and true.<BR>
From Aja Das'aratha came,<BR>
Whose virtuous life was free from blame<BR>
His eldest son art thou: his throne,<BR>
O famous Kama, is thine own.<BR>
Accept the sway so justly thine.<BR>
And view the world with eyes benign.<BR>
For ever in Iksava'ku's race<BR>
The eldest takes his father's place,<BR>
And while he lives no son beside<BR>
As lord and king is sanctified.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The rule by Raghu's children kept<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thou must not spurn to-day.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  This realm of peerless wealth accept,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And like thy father sway.'<BR>
