### CANTO XC.: THE HERMITAGE.

The prince of men a league away  
Saw where the hermit's dwelling lay,  
Then with his lords his path pursued,  
And left his warrior multitude.  
On foot, as duty taught his mind,  
He left his warlike gear behind:  
Two robes of linen cloth he wore,  
And bade Vas'ishtha walk before.  
Then Bharat from his lords withdrew  
When Bharadvája came in view,  
And toward the holy hermit went  
Behind Vas'ishtha, reverent.  
When Bharadvája, saint austere,  
Saw good Vis'ishtha drawing near,  
He cried, upspringing from his seat,  
'The grace-gift bring, my friend to greet.'  
When Saint Vas'ishtha near him drew,  
And Bharat paid the reverence due,  
The glorious hermit was aware  
That Das'aratha's son was there.  
The grace-gift, water for their feet  
He gave, and offered fruit to eat;  
Then, duty-skilled, with friendly speech  
In seemly order questioned each:  
'How fares it in Ayodhvá now  
With treasury and army? how  
With kith and kin and friends most dear,  
With councillor, and prince, and peer?'  
But, for be knew the king was dead,  
Of Das'aratha naught he said.  
Vas'ishtha and the prince in turn  
Would of the hermits welfare learn:  
Of holy fires they fain would hear,  
Of pupils, trees, and birds, and deer.  
The glorious saint his answer made  
That all was well in holy shade:  
Then love of Ráma moved his breast,  
And thus he questioned of his guest:  
Why art thou here, O Prince, whose band  
With kingly sway protects the land;  
Declare the cause, explain the whole.  
For yet some doubt disturbs my soul.  
He whom Kaus'alyá bare, whose might  
The foemen slays, his line's delight,  
He who with wife and brother sent  
Afar now roam in banishment.  
Famed prince, to whom his father spake  
This order for a woman's sake:  
'Away! and in the forest spend  
Thy life till fourteen years shall end'--  
Has thou the wish to harm him, bent  
On sin against the innocent?  
Wouldst thou thine elder's realm enjoy  
Without a thorn that can annoy?'  
   With sobbing voice and tearful eye  
Thus Bharat sadly made reply:  
'Ah lost am I, if thou, O Saint,  

Canst thus in thought my heart attaint:  
No warning charge from thee I need;  
Ne'er could such crime from me proceed.  
The words my guilty mother spake  
When fondly jealous for my sake--  
Think not that I, to triumph moved,  
Those words approve or e'er approved.  
O Hermit, I have sought this place  
To win the lordly hero's grace,  
To throw me at my brother's feet  
And lead him to his royal seat.  
To this, my journey's aim and end,  
Thou shouldst, O Saint, thy favour lend:  
Where is the lord of earth? do thou,  
Most holy, say, where roams he now?  
   Then, by the saint Vas'ishtha pressed,  
     And all the gathered priests beside,  
   To Bharat's dutiful request  
     The hermit graciously replied:  
'Worthy of thee, O Prince, this deed,  
True son of Raghu's ancient seed.  
I know thee reverent, well-controlled,  
The glory of the good of old.  
I grant thy prayer: in this pursuit  
I know thy heart is resolute.  
'Tis for thy sake those words I said  
That wider still thy fame may spread.  
I know where Ráma, duty-tried,  
His brother, and his wife abide.  
Where Chitrakúta's heights arise  
Thy brother Ráma's dwelling lies.  
Go thither with the morning's light,  
And stay with all thy lords tonight:  
For I would show thee honour high,  
And do not thou my wish deny.'
