### CANTO XIX.: RÁMA'S PROMISE.

Calm and unmoved by threatened woe  
The noble conqueror of the foe  
Answered the cruel words she spoke,  
Nor quailed beneath the murderous stroke:  

Yea, for my father's promise sake  
I to the wood my way will take,  
And dwell a lonely exile there  
In hermit dress with matted hair.  
One thing alone I fain would learn,  
Why is the king this day so stern?  
Why is the scourge of foes so cold,  
Nor gives me greeting as of old?  
Now let not anger flush thy cheek:  
Before thy face the truth I speak,  
In hermit's coat with matted hair  
To the wild wood will I repair.  
How can I fail his will to do,  
Friend, master, grateful sovereign too?  
One only pang consumes my breast.  
That his own lips have not expressed  
His will, nor made his longing known  
That Bharat should ascend the throne.  

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>  

To Bharat I would yield my wife,  
My realm and wealth, mine own dear life,  
Unasked I fain would yield them all:  
More gladly at my father's call,  
More gladly when the gift may free  
His honour and bring joy to thee.  
Thus, lady, his sad heart release  
From the sore shame, and give him peace.  
But tell me, O, I pray thee, why  
The lord of men, with downcast eye,  
Lies prostrate thus, and one by one  
Down his pale cheek the tear-drops run.  
Let couriers to thy father speed  
On horses of the swiftest breed,  
And, by the mandate of the king,  
Thy Bharat to his presence bring.  
My father's words I will not stay  
To question, but this very day  
To Dandak's pathless wild will fare,  
For twice seven years an exile there.'  

When Ráma thus had made reply  
Kaikeyí's heart with joy beat high.  
She, trusting to the pledge she held,  
The youth's departure thus impelled:  
''Tis well. Be messengers despatched  
On coursers ne'er for fleetness matched,  
To seek my father's home and lead  
My Bharat back with all their speed.  
And, Ráma, as I ween that thou  
Wilt scarce endure to linger now,  
So surely it were wise and good  
This hour to journey to the wood.  
And if, with shame cast down and weak,  
No word to thee the king can speak,  
Forgive, and from thy mind dismiss  
A trifle in an hour like this.  
But till thy feet in rapid haste  
Have left the city for the waste,  
And to the distant forest fled,  
He will not bathe nor call for bread.'  

'Woe! woe!' from the sad monarch burst,  
In surging floods of grief immersed;  
Then swooning, with his wits astray,  
Upon the gold-wrought couch he lay,  
And Ráma raised the aged king:  
But the stern queen, unpitying,  
Checked not her needless words, nor spared  
The hero for all speed prepared,  
But urged him with her bitter tongue,  
Like a good horse with lashes stung.  
She spoke her shameful speech. Serene  
He heard the fury of the queen,  
And to her words so vile and dread  
Gently, unmoved in mind, he said:  
'I would not in this world remain  
A grovelling thrall to paltry gain,  
But duty's path would fain pursue,  
True as the saints themselves are true.  
From death itself I would not fly  
My father's wish to gratify.  
What deed soe'er his loving son  
May do to please him, think it done.  
Amid all duties, Queen, I count  
This duty first and paramount,  
That sons, obedient, aye fulfil  
Their honoured fathers' word and will.  
Without his word, if thou decree,  
Forth to the forest will I flee,  
And there shall fourteen years be spent  
Mid lonely wilds in banishment.  
Methinks thou couldst not hope to find  
One spark of virtue in my mind,  
If thou, whose wish is still my lord,  
Hast for this grace the king implored.  
This day I go, but, ere we part,  
Must cheer my Sítá's tender heart.  
To my dear mother bid farewell;  
Then to the woods, a while to dwell.  
With thee, O Queen, the care must rest  
That Bharat hear his sire's behest,  
And guard the land with righteous sway,  
For such the law that lives for aye.'  

In speechless woe the father heard,  
Wept with loud cries, but spoke no word.  
Then Ráma touched his senseless feet,  
And hers, for honour most unmeet;  
Round both his circling steps he bent,  
Then from the bower the hero went.  
Soon as he reached the gate he found  
His dear companions gathered round.  
Behind him came Sumitrás child  
With weeping eyes so sad and wild.  
Then saw he all that rich array  
Of vases for the glorious day.  
Round them with reverent stops he paced,  
Nor veiled his eye, nor moved in haste.  
The loss of empire could not dim  
The glory that encompassed him.  
So will the Lord of Cooling Rays  <span
id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_286)  
On whom the world delights to gaze,  
Through the great love of all retain  
Sweet splendour in the time of wane.  
Now to the exile's lot resigned  
He left the rule of earth behind:  
As though all worldly cares he spurned  
No trouble was in him discerned.  
The chouries that for kings are used,  
And white umbrella, he refused,  
Dismissed his chariot and his men,  
And every friend and citizen.  
He ruled his senses, nor betrayed  
The grief that on his bosom weighed,  
And thus his mother's mansion sought  
To tell the mournful news he brought.  
Nor could the gay-clad people there  
Who flocked round Ráma true and fair,  
One sign of altered fortune trace  
Upon the splendid hero's face.  
Nor had the chieftain, mighty-armed.  
Lost the bright look all hearts that charmed,  

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>  

As e'en from autumn moons is thrown  
A splendour which is all their own.  
With his sweet voice the hero spoke  
Saluting all the gathered folk,  
Then righteous-souled and great in fame  
Close to his mother's house he came.  
Lakshman the brave, his brother's peer  
In princely virtues, followed near,  
Sore troubled, but resolved to show  
No token of his secret woe.  
Thus to the palace Ráma went  
   Where all were gay with hope and joy;  
But well he knew the dire event  
   That hope would mar, that bliss destroy.  
So to his grief he would not yield  
   Lest the sad change their hearts might rend,  
And, the dread tiding unrevealed,  
   Spared from the blow each faithful friend.
