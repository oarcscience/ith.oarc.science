### CANTO CXXIV.: THE DEPARTURE.

The giant lord the chariot viewed,  
And humbly thus his speech renewed:  
'Behold, O King, the car prepared:  
Now be thy further will declared.'  
He ceased: and Ráma spake once more:  
'These hosts who thronged to Lanká's shore  
Their faith and might have nobly shown,  
And set thee on the giants' throne.  
Let pearls and gems and gold repay  
The feats of many a desperate day,  
That all may go triumphant hence  
Proud of their noble recompense.'  
Vibhíshan, ready at his call,  
With gold and gems enriched them all.  
Ihen Ráma clomb the glorious car  
That shone like day's resplendent star.  
There in his lap he held his dame  
Vailing her eyes in modest shame.  
Beside him Lakshman took his stand,  
Whose mighty bow still armed his hand,  
'O King Vibhíshan,' Ráma cried,  
'O Vánar chiefs, so long allied,  

<span id="page_502">p. 502</span>  

My comrades till the foemen fell,  
List, for I speak a long farewell.  
The task, in doubt and fear begun,  
With your good aid is nobly done.  
Leave Lanká's shore, your steps retrace,  
Brave warriors of the Vánar race  
Thou, King Sugríva, true, through all,  
To friendship's bond and duty's call,  
Seek far Kishkindha with thy train  
And o'er thy realm in glory reign.  
Farewell, Vibhíshan, Lanká's throne  
Won by our arms is now thine own,  
Thou, mighty lord, hast nought to dread  
From heavenly Gods by Indra led.  
My last farewell, O King, receive,  
For Lanká's isle this hour I leave.'  

Loud rose their cry in answer: 'We,  
O Raghu's son, would go with thee.  
With thee delighted would we stray  
Where sweet Ayodhyá's groves are gay,  
Then in the joyous synod view  
King-making balm thy brows bedew;  
Our homage to Kaus'alyá pay,  
And hasten on our homeward way.'  

Their prayer the son of Raghu heard,  
And spoke, his heart with rapture stirred:  
'Sugríva, O my faithful friend,  
Vibhíshan and ye chiefs, ascend.  
A joy beyond all joys the best  
Will fill my overflowing breast,  
If girt by you, O noble band,  
I seek again my native land.'  
With Vánar lords in danger tried  
Sugríva sprang to Ráma's side,  
And girt by chiefs of giant kind  
Vibhíshan's step was close behind.  
Swift through the air, as Ráma chose,  
The wondrous car from earth arose.  
And decked with swans and silver wings  
Bore through the clouds its freight of kings.
