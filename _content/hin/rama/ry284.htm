<P>
'I strove to soothe and lull to rest<BR>
The fury of his troubled breast:<BR>
Well art thou come, dear lord,' I cried.<BR>
'By whose strong arm thy foe has died.<BR>
Forlorn I languished here, but now<BR>
My saviour and defence art thou.<BR>
Once more receive this regal shade &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_566"></A><A HREF="#fn_566"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Like the full moon in heaven displayed;<BR>
And let the chouries*, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_567"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> thus restored,<BR>
Wave glorious o'er the rightful lord.<BR>
I kept my watch, thy word obeyed,<BR>
And by the cave a year I stayed.<BR>
But when I saw that stream of blood<BR>
Rush from the cavern in a flood,<BR>
My sad heart broken with dismay.<BR>
And every wandering sense astray,<BR>
I barred the entrance with a stone,--<BR>
A crag from some high mountain thrown--<BR>
Turned from the spot I watched in vain.<BR>
And to Kishkindh&aacute; came again.<BR>
My deep distress and downcast mien<BR>
By citizen and lord were seen.<BR>
They made me king against my will:<BR>
Forgive me if the deed was ill.<BR>
True as I ever was I see<BR>
My honoured king once more in thee;<BR>
I only ruled a while the state<BR>
When thou hadst left us desolate.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
This town with people, lords, and lands,<BR>
Lay as a trust in guardian hands:<BR>
And now, my gracious lord, accept<BR>
The kingdom which thy servant kept.<BR>
Forgive me, victor of the foe,<BR>
Nor let thy wrath against me glow.<BR>
See joining suppliant hands I pray,<BR>
And at thy feet my head I lay.<BR>
Believe my words: against my will<BR>
The royal seat they made me fill.<BR>
Unkinged they saw the city, hence<BR>
They made me lord for her defence.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But B&aacute;li, though I humbly sued,<BR>
Reviled me in his furious mood:<BR>
'Out on thee, wretch!' in wrath he cried<BR>
With many a bitter taunt beside<BR>
He summoned every lord, and all<BR>
His subjects gathered at his call.<BR>
Then forth his burning anger broke,<BR>
And thus amid his friends he spoke:<BR>
'I need not tell, for well ye know,<BR>
How fierce M&aacute;y&aacute;v&iacute;, fiend and foe,<BR>
Came to Kishkindh&aacute;'s gate by night,<BR>
And dared me in his wrath to fight.<BR>
I heard each word the demon said:<BR>
Forth from my royal hall I sped;<BR>
And, foe in brother's guise concealed,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va followed to the field.<BR>
The mighty demon through the shade<BR>
Beheld me come with one to aid:<BR>
Then shrinking from unequal fight.<BR>
He turned his back in swiftest flight.<BR>
From vengeful foes his life to save<BR>
He sought the refuge of a cave.<BR>
Then when I saw the fiend had fled<BR>
Within that cavern dark and dread,<BR>
Thus to my brother cruel-eyed.<BR>
Impatient in my wrath, I cried:<BR>
'I seek no more my royal town<BR>
Till I have struck the demon down.<BR>
Here by the cavein's mouth remain<BR>
Until my hand the foe have slain.'<BR>
Upon his faith my heart relied,<BR>
And swift within the depths I hied.<BR>
A year went by: in every spot<BR>
I sought the fiend, but found him not.<BR>
At length my foe I saw and slew.<BR>
Whom long I feared when lost to view;<BR>
And all his kinsmen by his side<BR>
Beneath my vengeful fury died.<BR>
The monster, as he reeled and fell,<BR>
Poured forth his blood with roar and yell;<BR>
And, filling all the cavern, dyed<BR>
The portal with the crimson tide.<BR>
Upon my foeman slain at last<BR>
One look, one pitying look, I cast.<BR>
I sought again the light of day:<BR>
The cave was closed and left no way.<BR>
To the barred mouth I sadly came,<BR>
And called aloud Sugr&iacute;va's name.<BR>
But all was still: no voice replied,<BR>

<P>

And hope within my bosom died.<BR>
With furious efforts, vain at first,<BR>
Through bars of rock my way I burst.<BR>
Then, free once more, the path that brought<BR>
My feet in safety home I sought.<BR>
'Twas thus Sugr&iacute;va dared despise<BR>
The claim of brothers' friendly ties.<BR>
With crags of rock he barred me in,<BR>
And for himself the realm would win.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus B&aacute;li spoke in words severe;<BR>
And then, unmoved by ruth or fear,<BR>
Left me a single robe and sent<BR>
His brother forth in banishment.<BR>
He cast me out with scathe and scorn,<BR>
And from my side my wife was torn,<BR>
Now in great fear and ill at ease<BR>
I roam this land with woods and seas,<BR>
Or dwell on Rishyam&uacute;ka's hill,<BR>
And sorrow for my consort still.<BR>
Thou hast the tale how first arose<BR>
This bitter hate of brother foes.<BR>
Such are the griefs neath which I pine,<BR>
And all without a fault of mine.<BR>
O swift to save in hour of fear,<BR>
My prayer who dread this B&aacute;li, hear<BR>
With gracious love assistance deign,<BR>
And mine oppressor's arm restrain.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Raghu's son, the good and brave,<BR>
With a gay laugh his answer gate:<BR>
'These shafts of mine which ne'er can fail,<BR>
Before whose sheen the sun grows pale,<BR>
Winged by my fury, fleet and fierce,<BR>
The wicked B&aacute;li's heart shall pierce.<BR>
Yea, mark the words I speak, so long<BR>
Shall live that wretch who joys in wrong,<BR>
Until these angered eyes have seen<BR>
The robber of thy darling queen.<BR>
I, taught by equal suffering, know<BR>
What waves of grief above thee flow.<BR>
This hand thy captive wife shall free,<BR>
And give thy kingdom back to thee.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sugr&iacute;va joyed as R&aacute;ma spoke,<BR>
And valour in his breast awoke.<BR>
His eye grew bright, his heart grew bold,<BR>
And thus his wondrous tale he told:<BR>
