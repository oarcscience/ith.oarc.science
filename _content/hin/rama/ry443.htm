<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLIV.: THE NIGHT.</H3>
<P>
The lord of Light had sunk and set:<BR>
Night came; the foeman struggled yet;<BR>
And fiercer for the gloom of night<BR>
Grew the wild fury of the fight.<BR>
Scarce could each warrior's eager eye<BR>
The foeman from the friend descry.<BR>
'R&aacute;kshas or V&aacute;nar? say;' cried each,<BR>
And foe knew foeman by his speech.<BR>
'Why wilt thou fly? O warrior, stay:<BR>
'Turn on the foe, and rend and slay:'<BR>
Such were the cries, such words of fear<BR>
Smote through the gloom each listening ear.<BR>
Each swarthy rover of the night<BR>
Whose golden armour flashed with light,<BR>
Showed like a towering hill embraced<BR>
By burning woods about his waist.<BR>
The giants at the V&aacute;nars flew,<BR>
And ravening ate the foes they slew:<BR>
With mortal bite like serpent's fang,<BR>
The V&aacute;nars at the giants sprang,<BR>
And car and steeds and they who bore<BR>
The pennons fell bedewed with gore,<BR>
No serried band, no firm array<BR>
The fury of their charge could stay<BR>
Down went the horse and rider, down<BR>
Went giant lords of high renown.<BR>
Though midnight's shade was dense and dark,<BR>
With skill that swerved not from the mark<BR>

<P>

<P>
Their bows the sons of Raghu drew,<BR>
And each keen shaft a chieftain slew.<BR>
Uprose the blinding dust from meads<BR>
Ploughed by the cars and trampling steeds,<BR>
And where the warriors fell the flood<BR>
Was dark and terrible with blood.<BR>
Six giants &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_962"></A><A HREF="ry444.htm#fn_962"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> singled R&aacute;ma out,<BR>
And charged him with a furious shout<BR>
Loud as the roaring of the sea<BR>
When every wind is raging free.<BR>
Six times he shot: six heads were cleft;<BR>
Six giants dead on earth were left.<BR>
Nor ceased he yet: his bow he strained,<BR>
And from the sounding weapon rained<BR>
A storm of shafts whose fiery glare<BR>
Filled all the region of the air;<BR>
And chieftains dropped before his aim<BR>
Like moths that perish in the flame.<BR>
Earth glistened where the arrows fell,<BR>
As shines in autumn nights a dell<BR>
Which fireflies, flashing through the gloom,<BR>
With momentary light illume.<BR>

<P>
But Indrajit, when B&aacute;li's son &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_963"></A><A HREF="ry444.htm#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
The victory o'er the foe had won.<BR>
Saw with a fury-kindled eye<BR>
His mangled steeds and driver die;<BR>
Then, lost in air, he fled the fight,<BR>
And vanished from the victor's sight.<BR>
The Gods and saints glad voices raised,<BR>
And Angad for his virtue praised;<BR>
And Raghu's sons bestowed the meed<BR>
Of honour due to valorous deed.<BR>

<P>
Compelled his shattered car to quit,<BR>
Rage filled the soul of Indrajit,<BR>
Who brooked not, strong by Brahm&aacute;'s grace<BR>
Defeat from one of V&aacute;nar race.<BR>
In magic mist concealed from view<BR>
His bow the treacherous warrior drew,<BR>
And Raghu's sons were first to feel<BR>
The tempest of his winged steel.<BR>
Then when his arrows failed to kill<BR>
The princes who defied him still,<BR>
He bound them with the serpent noose, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_964"></A><A HREF="ry444.htm#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>
The magic bond which none might loose.<BR>

combats, as there is little variety in the
details and each duel results in the victory
of the V&aacute;nar or his ally.</P>
