<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO VIII.: R&Aacute;MA'S PROMISE.</H3>
<P>
Doubt from Sugr&iacute;va's heart had fled,<BR>
And thus to Raghu's son he said:<BR>
'No bliss the Gods of heaven deny.<BR>
Each views me with a favouring eye.<BR>
When thou, whom all good gifts attend,<BR>
Hast sought me and become my friend.<BR>
Leagued, friend, with thee in bold emprise<BR>
My arm might win the conquered skies;<BR>
And shall our banded strength be weak<BR>
To gain the realm which now I seek?<BR>
A happy fate was mine above<BR>
My kith and kin and all I love.<BR>
When, near the witness fire, I won<BR>
Thy friendship, Raghu's glorious son.<BR>
Thou too in ripening time shall see<BR>
Thy friend not all unworthy thee.<BR>
What gifts I have shall thus be shown:<BR>
Not mine the tongue to make them known.<BR>
Strong is the changeless bond that binds<BR>
The friendly faith of noble minds.<BR>
In woe, in danger, firm and sure<BR>
Their constancy and love endure.<BR>
Gold, silver, jewels rich and rare<BR>
They count as wealth for friends to share.<BR>

Yea, be they rich or poor and low,<BR>
Blest with all joys or sunk in woe,<BR>
Stained with each fault or pure of blame,<BR>
Their friends the nearest place may claim;<BR>
For whom they leave, at friendship's call,<BR>
Their gold, their bliss, their homes and all,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke by generous impulse moved,<BR>
And Raghu's son his speech approved<BR>
Glancing at Lakshman by his side,<BR>
Like Indra in his beauty's pride.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar monarch saw the pair<BR>
Of mighty brothers standing there,<BR>
And turned his rapid eye to view<BR>
The forest trees that near him grew.<BR>
He saw, not far from where he stood,<BR>
A S&aacute;l tree towering o'er the wood.<BR>
Amid the thick leaves many a bee<BR>
Graced the scant blossoms of the tree,<BR>
From whose dark shade a bough, that bore<BR>
A load of leafy twigs, he tore,<BR>
Which on the grassy ground he laid<BR>
And seats for him and R&aacute;ma made,<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n saw them sit, he sought<BR>
A S&aacute;l tree's leafy bough and brought<BR>
The burthen, and with meek request<BR>
Entreated Lakshman, too, to rest.<BR>
There on the noble mountain's brow,<BR>
Strewn with the young leaves of the bough,<BR>
Sat Raghu's son in placid ease<BR>
Calm as the sea when sleeps the breeze.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va's heart with rapture swelled,<BR>
And thus, by eager love impelled,<BR>
He spoke in gracious tone, that, oft<BR>
Checked by his joy, was low and soft:<BR>
'I, by my brother's might oppressed,<BR>
By ceaseless woe and fear distressed,<BR>
Mourning my consort far away,<BR>
On Rishyam&uacute;ka's mountain stray.<BR>
Expelled by B&aacute;li's cruel hate<BR>
I wander here disconsolate.<BR>
Do thou to whom all sufferers flee,<BR>
From his dread hand deliver me.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke, and Rama, just and brave,<BR>
Whose pious soul to virtue clave,<BR>
Smiled as in conscious might he eyed<BR>
The king of V&aacute;nars, and replied:<BR>
'Best fruit of friendship is the deed<BR>
That helps the friend in hour of need;<BR>
And this mine arm in death shall lay<BR>
Thy robber ere the close of day.<BR>
For see, these feathered darts of mine<BR>
Whose points so fiercely flash and shine,<BR>
And shafts with golden emblem, came<BR>
From dark woods known by Skanda's name,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_562"></A><A HREF="#fn_562"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

Winged from the pinion of the hern<BR>
Like Indra's bolts they strike and burn.<BR>
With even knots and piercing head<BR>
Each like a furious snake is sped;<BR>
With these, to-day, before thine eye<BR>
Shall, like a shattered mountain, lie<BR>
B&aacute;li, thy dread and wicked foe,<BR>
O'erwhelmed in hideous overthrow.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke: Sugr&iacute;va's bosom swelled<BR>
With hope and joy unparalleled.<BR>
Then his glad voice the V&aacute;nar raised,<BR>
And thus the son of Raghu praised:<BR>
'Long have I pined in depth of grief;<BR>
Thou art the hope of all, O chief.<BR>
Now, Raghu's son, I bail thee friend,<BR>
And bid thee to my woes attend;<BR>
For, by ray truth I swear it, now<BR>
Not life itself is dear as thou,<BR>
Since by the witness fire we met<BR>
And friendly hand in hand was set.<BR>
Friend communes now with friend, and hence<BR>
I tell with surest confidence,<BR>
How woes that on my spirit weigh<BR>
Consume me through the night and day.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  For sobs and sighs he scarce could speak,<BR>
And his sad voice came low and weak,<BR>
As, while his eyes with tears o'erflowed,<BR>
The burden of his soul he showed.<BR>
Then by strong effort, bravely made,<BR>
The torrent of his tears he stayed,<BR>
Wiped his bright eyes, his grief subdued,<BR>
And thus, more calm, his speech renewed:<BR>
'By B&aacute;li's conquering might oppressed,<BR>
Of power and kingship dispossessed,<BR>
Loaded with taunts of scorn and hate<BR>
I left my realm and royal state.<BR>
He tore away my consort: she<BR>
Was dearer than my life to me,<BR>
And many a friend to me and mine<BR>
In hopeless chains was doomed to pine.<BR>
With wicked thoughts, unsated still,<BR>
Me whom he wrongs he yearns to kill;<BR>
And spies of V&aacute;nar race, who tried<BR>
To slay me, by this hand have died.<BR>
Moved by this constant doubt and fear<BR>
I saw thee, Prince, and came not near.<BR>
When woe and peril gather rouud<BR>
A foe in every form is found.<BR>
Save Han&uacute;m&aacute;n, O Raghu's son,<BR>
And these, no friend is left me, none.<BR>
Through their kind aid, a faithful band<BR>
Who guard their lord from hostile hand,<BR>
Rest when their chieftain rests and bend<BR>
Their steps where'er he lists to wend,--<BR>
Through them alone, in toil and pain,<BR>
My wretched life I still sustain.<BR>

Enough, for thou hast heard in brief<BR>
The story of my pain and grief.<BR>
His mighty strength all regions know,<BR>
My brother, but my deadly foe.<BR>
Ah, if the proud oppressor fell,<BR>
His death would all my woe dispel.<BR>
Yea, on my cruel conqueror's fall<BR>
My joy depends, my life, my all.<BR>
This were the end and sure relief,<BR>
O R&aacute;ma, of my tale of grief.<BR>
Fair be his lot or dark with woe.<BR>
No comfort like a friend I know.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Rama spoke: 'O friend, relate<BR>
Whence sprang fraternal strife and hate,<BR>
That duly taught by thee, I may<BR>
Each foeman's strength and weakness weigh:<BR>
And skilled in every chance restore<BR>
The blissful state thou hadst before.<BR>
For, when I think of all the scorn<BR>
And bitter woe thou long hast borne.<BR>
My soul indignant swells with pain<BR>
Like waters flushed with furious rain.<BR>
Then, ere I string this bended bow,<BR>
Tell me the tale I long to know,<BR>
Ere from the cord my arrow fly,<BR>
And low in death thy foeman lie.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke: Sugr&iacute;va joyed to hear,<BR>
Nor less his lords were glad of cheer:<BR>
And thus to R&aacute;ma mighty-souled<BR>
The cause that moved their strife he told;<BR>
