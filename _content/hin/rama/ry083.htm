<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO V.: R&Aacute;MA'S FAST.</H3>
<P>
Then Saint Vas'ishtha to the king<BR>
Came ready at his summoning.<BR>
'Now go,' exclaimed the monarch, 'thou<BR>
Enriched by fervent rite and vow,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma and his wife ordain<BR>
The fast, that joy may bless his reign.'<BR>

<P>
The best of those who Scripture know<BR>
Said to the king, 'My lord, I go.'<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's house Vas'ishtha hied,<BR>
The hero's fast by rule to guide,<BR>
And skilled in sacred texts to tell<BR>
Each step to him instructed well.<BR>
Straight to Prince R&aacute;ma's high abode,<BR>
That like a cloud pale-tinted showed,<BR>
Borne in his priestly car he rode.<BR>
Two courts he passed, and in the third<BR>
He stayed his car. Then R&aacute;ma heard<BR>
The holy sage was come, and flew<BR>
To honour him with honour due.<BR>
He hastened to the car and lent<BR>
His hand to aid the priest's descent.<BR>
Then spoke Vas'ishtha words like these,<BR>
Pleased with his reverent courtesies,<BR>
With pleasant things his heart to cheer<BR>
Who best deserved glad news to hear:<BR>
'Prince, thou hast won thy father's grace,<BR>
And thine will be the Regent's place:<BR>
Now with thy S&iacute;t&aacute;, as is right,<BR>
In strictest fasting spend the night,<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
For when the morrow's dawn is fair<BR>
The king will consecrate his heir:<BR>
So Nahush,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>  as the wise relate,<BR>
Yay&aacute;ti joyed to consecrate.'<BR>

<P>
Thus having said, Vas'ishtha next<BR>
Ordained the fast by rule and text,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma faithful to his vows<BR>
And the Videhan dame his spouse.<BR>
Then from the prince's house he hied<BR>
With courteous honours gratified.<BR>
Round R&aacute;ma gathered every friend<BR>
In pleasant talk a while to spend.<BR>
He bade good night to all at last,<BR>
And to his inner chamber passed.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma's house shone bright and gay<BR>
With men and maids in glad array,<BR>
As in the morning some fair lake<BR>
When all her lotuses awake,<BR>
And every bird that loves the flood<BR>
Flits joyous round each opening bud.<BR>

<P>
Forth from the house Vas'ishtha drove,<BR>
That with the king's in splendour strove,<BR>
And all the royal street he viewed<BR>
Filled with a mighty multitude<BR>
The eager concourse blocked each square,<BR>
Each road and lane and thoroughfare,<BR>
And joyous shouts on every side<BR>
Rose like the roar of Ocean's tide,<BR>
As streams of men together came<BR>
With loud huzza and glad acclaim.<BR>
The ways were watered, swept and clean,<BR>
And decked with flowers and garlands green<BR>
And all Ayodhy&aacute; shone arrayed<BR>
With banners on the roofs that played.<BR>
Men, women, boys with eager eyes,<BR>
Expecting when the sun should rise,<BR>
Stood longing for the herald ray<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma's consecration day,<BR>
To see, a source of joy to all,<BR>
The people-*honoured festival.<BR>

<P>
The priest advancing slowly through<BR>
The mighty crowd he cleft in two,<BR>
Near to the monarch's palace drew.<BR>
He sought the terrace, by the stair,<BR>
Like a white cloud peak high in air,<BR>
The reverend king of men to meet<BR>
Who sate upon his splendid seat:<BR>
Thus will Vrihaspati arise<BR>
To meet the monarch of the skies.<BR>
But when the king his coming knew,<BR>
He left his throne and near him drew<BR>
Questioned by him Vas'ishtha said<BR>
That all his task was duly sped.<BR>
Then all who sate there, honouring<BR>
Vas'ishtha, rose as rose the king,<BR>
Vas'ishtha bade his lord adieu,<BR>
And all the peers, dismissed, withdrew.<BR>


<P>


<P>
Then as a royal lion seeks<BR>
His cave beneath the rocky peaks,<BR>
So to the chambers where abode<BR>
His consorts Das'aratha strode.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Full-thronged were those delightful bowers<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With women richly dressed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And splendid as the radiant towers<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Where Indra loves to rest.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then brighter flashed a thousand eyes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With the light his presence lent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As, when the moon begins to rise<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The star thronged firmament.<BR>
