<P>
Arrived at Panchavat&iacute;'s shade<BR>
Where silvan life and serpents strayed,<BR>
R&aacute;ma in words like these addressed<BR>
Lakshman of vigour unrepressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Brother, our home is here: behold<BR>
The grove of which the hermit told:<BR>
The bowers of Panchavat&iacute; see<BR>
Made fair by every blooming tree.<BR>
Now, brother, bend thine eyes around;<BR>
With skilful glance survey the grouud:<BR>
Here be some spot selected, best<BR>
Approved for gentle hermits' rest,<BR>
Where thou, the Maithil dame, and I<BR>
May dwell while seasons sweetly fly.<BR>
Some pleasant spot be chosen where<BR>
Pure waters gleam and trees are fair,<BR>
Some nook where flowers and wood are found<BR>
And sacred grass and springs abound.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Lakshman, Sit&aacute; standing by,<BR>
Raised reverent hands, and made reply:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'A hundred years shall flee, and still<BR>
Will I obey my brothers will:<BR>
Select thyself a pleasant spot;<BR>
Be mine the care to rear the cot.'<BR>
The glorious chieftain, pleased to hear<BR>
That loving speech that soothed his ear,<BR>
Selected with observant care<BR>
A spot with every charm most fair.<BR>
He stood within that calm retreat,<BR>
A shade for hermits' home most meet,<BR>
And thus Sumitr&aacute;'s son addressed,<BR>
While his dear hand in his he pressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'See, see this smooth and lovely glade<BR>
Which flowery trees encircling shade:<BR>
Do thou, beloved Lakshman rear<BR>
A pleasant cot to lodge us here.<BR>
I see beyond that feathery brake<BR>
The gleaming of a lilied lake,<BR>
Where flowers in sunlike glory throw<BR>
Fresh odours from the wave below.<BR>
Agastva's words now find we true,<BR>
He told the charms which here we view:<BR>

<P>
Here are the trees that blossom o'er<BR>
God&aacute;var&iacute;'s most lovely shore.<BR>
Whose pleasant flood from side to side<BR>
With swans and geese is beautified,<BR>
And fair banks crowded with the deer<BR>
That steal from every covert near.<BR>
The peacock's cry is loud and shrill<BR>
From many a tall and lovely hill,<BR>
Green-belted by the trees that wave<BR>
Full blossoms o'er the rock and cave.<BR>
Like elephants whose huge fronts glow<BR>
With painted streaks, the mountains show<BR>
Long lines of gold and silver sheen<BR>
With copper's darker hues between.<BR>
With every tree each hill is graced,<BR>
Where creepers blossom interlaced.<BR>
Look where the S&aacute;l's long branches sway,<BR>
And palms their fanlike leaves display;<BR>
The date-tree And the Jak are near,<BR>
And their long stems Tam&aacute;las rear.<BR>
See the tall Mango lift his head,<BR>
As'okas all their glory spread,<BR>
The Ketak her sweet buds unfold,<BR>
And Champacs hang their cups of gold. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_450"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The spot is pure and pleasant here<BR>
Are multitudes of birds and deer.<BR>
O Lakshman, with our father's friend<BR>
What happy hours we here shall spend!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke: the conquering Lakshman heard.<BR>
Obedient to his brother's word.<BR>
Raised by his toil a cottage stood<BR>
To shelter R&aacute;ma in the wood<BR>
Of ample size, with leaves o'erlaid,<BR>
Of hardened earth the walls were made.<BR>
The strong bamboos his hands had felled<BR>
For pillars fair the roof upheld,<BR>
And rafter, beam, and lath supplied<BR>
Well interwrought from side to side.<BR>
Then Sam&iacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> boughs he deftly spread<BR>
Enlaced with knotted cord o'erhead,<BR>
Well thatched above from ridge to eaves<BR>
With holy grass, and reed, and leaves.<BR>
The mighty chief with careful toil<BR>
Had cleared the ground and smoothed the soil<BR>

Where now, his loving labour done,<BR>
Rose a fair home for Raghu's son.<BR>
Then when his work was duly wrought,<BR>
God&aacute;var&iacute;s sweet stream he sought,<BR>
Bathed, plucked the lilies, and a store<BR>
Of fruit and berries homeward bore.<BR>
Then sacrifice he duly paid,<BR>
And wooed the Gods their hopes to aid,<BR>
And then to R&aacute;ma proudly showed<BR>
The cot prepared for his abode,<BR>
Then Raghu's son with S&iacute;t&aacute; gazed<BR>
Upon the home his hands had raised,<BR>
And transport thrilled his bosom through<BR>
His leafy hermitage to view.<BR>
The glorious son of Raghu round<BR>
His brother's neck his arms enwound,<BR>
And thus began his sweet address<BR>
Of deep-felt joy and gentleness:<BR>
'Well pleased am I, dear lord, to see<BR>
This noble work performed by thee.<BR>
For this,--sole grace I can bestow,--<BR>
About thy neck mine arms I throw.<BR>
So wise art thou, thy breast is filled<BR>
With grateful thoughts, in duty skilled,<BR>
Our mighty father, free from stain,<BR>
In thee, his offspring, lives again.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spoke the prince, who lent a grace<BR>
To fortune, pride of Raghu's race;<BR>
Then in that spot whose pleasant shade<BR>
Gave store of fruit, content he stayed.<BR>
With Lakshman and his Maithil spouse<BR>
He spent his day's neath sheltering boughs,<BR>
As happy as a God on high<BR>
Lives in his mansion in the sky.<BR>
