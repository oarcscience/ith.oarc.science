<P>
Now Das'aratha's pious mind<BR>
Meet wedlock for his sons designed;<BR>

<P>
With priests and friends the king began<BR>
To counsel and prepare his plan.<BR>
Such thoughts engaged his bosom, when,<BR>
To see Ayodhy&aacute;'s lord of men,<BR>
A mighty saint of glorious fame,<BR>
The hermit Vis'v&aacute;mitra &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> came.<BR>
For evil fiends that roam by night<BR>
Disturbed him in each holy rite.<BR>
And in their strength and frantic rage<BR>
Assailed with witcheries the sage.<BR>
He came to seek the monarch's aid<BR>
To guard the rites the demons stayed,<BR>
Unable to a close to bring<BR>
One unpolluted offering.<BR>
Seeking the king in this dire strait<BR>
He said to those who kept the gate:<BR>
'Haste, warders, to your master run,<BR>
And say that here stands G&aacute;dhi's son.'<BR>

<P>
Soon as they heard the holy man,<BR>
To the king's chamber swift they ran<BR>
With minds disordered all, and spurred<BR>
To wildest zeal by what they heard.<BR>
On to the royal hall they sped,<BR>
There stood and lowly bowed the head,<BR>
And made the lord of men aware<BR>
That the great saint was waiting there.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The king with priest and peer arose<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And ran the sage to meet,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As Indra from his palace goes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Lord Brahm&aacute;'s self to greet.<BR>
When glowing with celestial light<BR>
The pious hermit was in sight,<BR>
The king, whose mien his transport showed,<BR>
The honoured gift for guests bestowed.<BR>
Nor did the saint that gift despise,<BR>
Offered as holy texts advise;<BR>
He kindly asked the earth's great king<BR>
How all with him was prospering.<BR>
The son of Kus'ik &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> bade him tell<BR>
If all in town and field were well,<BR>
All well with friends, and kith and kin,<BR>
And royal treasure stored within:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Do all thy neighbours own thy sway?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thy foes confess thee yet?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dost thou continue still to pay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To Gods and men each debt?'<BR>
Then he of hermits first and best,<BR>
Vas'ishtha with a smile &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> addressed,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>


<P>
And asked him of his welfare too,<BR>
Showing him honour as was due.<BR>
Then with the sainted hermit all<BR>
Went joyous to the monarch's hall,<BR>
And sate them down by due degree,<BR>
Each one, of rank and dignity.<BR>
Joy filled the noble prince's breast<BR>
Who thus bespoke the honoured guest:<BR>
'As amrit &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="ry023.htm#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> by a mortal found,<BR>
As rain upon the thirsty ground,<BR>
As to an heirless man a son<BR>
Born to him of his precious one,<BR>
As gain of what we sorely miss,<BR>
As sudden dawn of mighty bliss,<BR>
So is thy coming here to me:<BR>
All welcome, mighty Saint, to thee.<BR>
What wish within thy heart hast thou?<BR>
If I can please thee, tell me how.<BR>
Hail, Saint, from whom all honours flow,<BR>
Worthy of all I can bestow.<BR>
Blest is my birth with fruit to-day,<BR>
Nor has my life been thrown away.<BR>
I see the best of Br&aacute;hman race<BR>
And night to glorious morn gives place.<BR>
Thou, holy Sage, in days of old<BR>
Among the royal saints enrolled,<BR>
Didst, penance glorified, within<BR>
The Br&aacute;hman caste high station win.<BR>
'Tis meet and right in many a way<BR>
That I to thee should honour pay.<BR>
This seems a marvel to mine eyes:<BR>
All sin thy visit purifies;<BR>
And I by seeing thee, O Sage,<BR>
Have reaped the fruit of pilgrimage.<BR>
Then say what thou wouldst have me do,<BR>
That thou hast sought this interview.<BR>
Favoured by thee, my wish is still,<BR>
O Hermit, to perform thy will.<BR>
Nor needest thou at length explain<BR>
The object that thy heart would gain.<BR>
Without reserve I grant it now:<BR>
My deity, O Lord, art thou.'<BR>

<P>
The glorious hermit, far renowned,<BR>
With highest fame and virtue crowned,<BR>
Rejoiced these modest words to hear<BR>
Delightful to the mind and ear.<BR>

remarks that the proficiency of the Indians

in this service that the name Indian was
