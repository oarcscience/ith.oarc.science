<P>
Each V&aacute;nar councillor and peer<BR>
In crowded numbers gathered near<BR>
Sugriva, mournful king, while yet<BR>
His vesture from the wave was wet,<BR>
Before the chief of Raghu's seed<BR>
Unwearied in each arduous deed,<BR>
They stood and raised the reverent hand<BR>
As saints before Lord Brahm&aacute; stand,<BR>
Then Hanum&aacute;n of massive mould,<BR>
Like some tall hill of glistering gold,<BR>
Son of the God whose wild blasts shake<BR>
The forest, thus to R&aacute;ma spake:<BR>
'By thy kind favour, O my lord,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, to his home restored<BR>
Triumphant, has regained to-day<BR>
His rank and power and royal sway.<BR>
He now will call each faithful friend,<BR>
Enter the city, and attend<BR>
With sage advice and prudent care<BR>
To every task that waits him there.<BR>
Then balm and unguent shall anoint<BR>
Our monarch, as the laws appoint,<BR>
And gems and precious wreaths shall be<BR>
His grateful offering, King, to thee.<BR>
Do thou, O R&aacute;ma, with thy friend<BR>
Thy steps within the city bend;<BR>
Our ruler on his throne install,<BR>
And with thy presence cheer us all.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, skilled in lore and arts that guide<BR>
The speaker, Raghu's son replied:<BR>
'For fourteen years I might not break<BR>
The mandate that my father spake;<BR>
Nor can I, till that time be fled,<BR>
The street of town or village tread.<BR>
Let King Sugr&iacute;va seek the town<BR>
Most worthy of her high renown,<BR>
There let him be without delay<BR>
Anointed, and begin his sway.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  This answered, to Sugr&iacute;va then<BR>
Thus spake anew the king of men:<BR>
'Do thou who knowest right ordain<BR>
Prince Angad consort of thy reign;<BR>
For he is noble, true, and bold,<BR>
And trained a righteous course to hold<BR>
Gifts like his sire's thait youth adorn<BR>
Born eldest to the eldest born.<BR>

This is the month of Sr&aacute;vana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>first<BR>
Of those that see the rain-clouds burst.<BR>
Four months, thou knowest well, extends<BR>
The season when the rain descends.<BR>
No time for deeds of war is this.<BR>
Seek thou thy fair metropolis,<BR>
And I with Lakshman, O my friend,<BR>
The time upon this hill will spend.<BR>
An ample cavern opens there<BR>
Made lovely by the mountain air,<BR>
And lotuses and lilies fill<BR>
The pleasant lake and murmuring rill.<BR>
When K&aacute;rtik's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> month shall clear the skies,<BR>
Then tempt the mighty enterprise.<BR>
Now, chieftain to thy home repair,<BR>
And be anointed sovereign there.'<BR>

<P>
Sugr&iacute;va heard: he bowed his head:<BR>
Within the lovely town he sped<BR>
Which  Bali's royal will had swayed,<BR>
Where thousand V&aacute;nar chiefs arrayed<BR>
Gathered in order round their king,<BR>
And led him on with welcoming.<BR>
Low on the earth the lesser crowd<BR>
Fell in prostration as they bowed.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va looked with grateful eyes,<BR>
Spake to them all and bade them rise.<BR>
Then through the royal bowers he strode<BR>
Wherein the monarch's wives abode.<BR>
Soon from the inner chambers came<BR>
The V&aacute;nar of exalted fame;<BR>
And joyful friends drew near and shed<BR>
King-making balm upon his head,<BR>
Like Gods anointing in the skies<BR>
Their sovereign of the thousand eyes. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_615"></A><A HREF="#fn_615"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
Then brought they, o'er their king to hold<BR>
The white umbrella decked with gold,<BR>
And chouries with their waving hair<BR>
In golden handles wondrous fair;<BR>
And fragrant herbs and seed and spice,<BR>
And sparkling gems exceeding price,<BR>
And every bloom from woods and leas,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And gum distilled from milky trees;<BR>
And precious ointment white as milk,<BR>
And spotless robes of cloth and silk,<BR>
Wreaths of sweet flowers whose glories gleam<BR>
In grassy grove, on lake or stream.<BR>
And fragrant sandal and each scent<BR>
That makes the soft breeze redolent;<BR>
Grain, honey, odorous seed, and store<BR>
Of oil and curd and golden ore;<BR>
A noble tiger's skin, a pair<BR>
Of sandals wrought with costliest care,<BR>
Eight pairs of damsels drawing nigh<BR>
Brought unguents stained with varied dye.<BR>
Then gems and cates and robes displayed<BR>
Before the twice-born priests were laid,<BR>
That they would deign in order due<BR>
To consecrate the king anew.<BR>
The sacred grass was duly spread<BR>
And sacrificial flame was fed,<BR>
Which Scripture-learned priests supplied<BR>
With oil which texts had sanctified.<BR>
Then, with all rites ordained of old,<BR>
High on the terrace bright with gold,<BR>
Whereon a glorious carpet lay,<BR>
And fresh-culled garlands sweet and gay,<BR>
Placed on his throne, Sugr&iacute;va bent<BR>
His looks toward the Orient.<BR>
In horns from forehead of the bull.<BR>
In pitchers bright and beautiful,<BR>
In urns of gold the V&aacute;nara took<BR>
Pure water brought from stream and brook,<BR>
From every consecrated strand<BR>
And every sea that beats the land.<BR>
Then, as prescribed by sacred lore<BR>
And many a mighty sage of yore, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_616"></A><A HREF="#fn_616"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
The leaders of the V&aacute;nars poured<BR>
The sacred water on their lord. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_617"></A><A HREF="#fn_617"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
From every V&aacute;nar at the close<BR>
Of that imperial rite arose<BR>
Shouts of glad triumph, loud and long<BR>
Repeated by the high-souled throng.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, when the rite was done,<BR>
Obeyed the hest of Raghu's son.<BR>
Prince Angad to his breast he strained.<BR>
And partner of his sway ordained.<BR>
Once more from all the host rang out<BR>
The loud huzza and jovful shout.<BR>
'Well done! well done!' each V&aacute;nar cried.<BR>
And good Sugr&iacute;va glorified.<BR>

<A NAME="page_357"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 357</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Then with glad voices loudly raised<BR>
Were R&aacute;ma and his brother praised;<BR>
And bright Kishkindha shone that day<BR>
With happy throngs and banners gay.<BR>
