<P>
As fury lit Kaikey&iacute;'s eyes<BR>
She spoke with long and burning sighs:<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
'This day my son enthroned shall see,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to the woods shall flee.<BR>
But tell me, damsel, if thou can,<BR>
A certain way, a skilful plan<BR>
That Bharat may the empire gain,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's hopes be nursed in vain.'<BR>

<P>
The lady ceased. The wicked maid<BR>
The mandate of her queen obeyed,<BR>
And darkly plotting R&aacute;ma's fall<BR>
Responded to Kaikey&iacute;'s call.<BR>

<P>
'I will declare, do thou attend,<BR>
How Bharat may his throne ascend.<BR>
Dost thou forget what things befell?<BR>
Or dost thou feign, remembering well?<BR>
Or wouldst thou hear my tongue repeat<BR>
A story for thy need so meet?<BR>
Gay lady, if thy will be so,<BR>
Now hear the tale of long ago,<BR>
And when my tongue has done its part<BR>
Ponder the story in thine heart.<BR>
When Gods and demons fought of old,<BR>
Thy lord, with royal saints enrolled,<BR>
Sued to the war with thee to bring<BR>
His might to aid the Immortals' King.<BR>
Far to the southern land he sped<BR>
Where Dandak's mighty wilds are spread,<BR>
To Vaijayanta's city swayed<BR>
By S'ambara, whose flag displayd<BR>
The hugest monster of the sea.<BR>
Lord of a hundred wiles was be;<BR>
With might which Gods could never blame<BR>
Against the King of Heaven he came.<BR>
Then raged the battle wild and dread,<BR>
And mortal warriors fought and bled;<BR>
The fiends by night with strength renewed<BR>
Charged, slew the sleeping multitude.<BR>
Thy lord, King Das'aratha, long<BR>
Stood fighting with the demon throng,<BR>
But long of arm, unmatched in strength,<BR>
Fell wounded by their darts at length.<BR>
Thy husband, senseless, by thine aid<BR>
Was from the battle field conveyed.<BR>
And wounded nigh to death thy lord<BR>
Was by thy care to health restored.<BR>
Well pleased the grateful monarch sware<BR>
To grant thy first and second prayer.<BR>
Thou for no favour then wouldst sue,<BR>
The gifts reserved for season due;<BR>
And he, thy high-souled lord, agreed<BR>
To give the boons when thou shouldst need.<BR>
Myself I knew not what befell,<BR>
But oft the tale have heard thee tell,<BR>
And close to thee in friendship knit<BR>
Deep in my heart have treasured it.<BR>
Remind thy husband of his oath,<BR>
Recall the boons and claim them both,<BR>
That Bharat on the throne be placed<BR>
With rites of consecration graced,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to the woods be sent<BR>
For twice seven years of banishment.<BR>
Go, Queen, the mourner's chamber &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> seek,<BR>
With angry eye and burning cheek;<BR>
And with disordered robes and hair<BR>
On the cold earth lie prostrate there.<BR>
When the king comes still mournful lie,<BR>
Speak not a word nor meet his eye,<BR>
But let thy tears in torrent flow,<BR>
And lie enamoured of thy woe.<BR>
Well do I know thou long hast been,<BR>
And ever art, his darling queen.<BR>
For thy dear sake, O well-loved dame,<BR>
The mighty king would brave the flame,<BR>
But ne'er would anger thee, or brook<BR>
To meet his favourite's wrathful look.<BR>
Thy loving lord would even die<BR>
Thy fancy, Queen, to gratify,<BR>
And never could he arm his breast<BR>
To answer nay to thy request.<BR>
Listen and learn, O dull of sense,<BR>
Thine all-resistless influence.<BR>
Gems he will offer, pearls and gold:<BR>
Refuse his gifts, be stern and cold.<BR>
Those proffered boons at length recall,<BR>
And claim them till he grants thee all.<BR>
And O my lady, high in bliss,<BR>
With heedful thought forget not this.<BR>
When from the ground his queen he lifts<BR>
And grants again the promised gifts,<BR>
Bind him with oaths he cannot break<BR>
And thy demands unflnching, make.<BR>
That R&aacute;ma travel to the wild<BR>
Five years and nine from home exiled,<BR>
And Bharat, best of all who reign.<BR>
The empire of the land obtain.<BR>
For when this term of years has fled<BR>
Over the banished R&aacute;ma's head,<BR>
Thy royal son to vigour grown<BR>
And rooted firm will stand alone.<BR>
The king, I know, is well inclined,<BR>
And this the hour to move his mind.<BR>
Be bold: the threatened rite prevent,<BR>
And force the king from his intent.'<BR>

<P>
She ceased. So counselled to her bane<BR>
Disguised beneath a show of gain,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; in her joy and pride<BR>
To Manthar&aacute; again replied:<BR>
'Thy sense I envy, prudent maid;<BR>
With sagest lore thy lids persuade.<BR>
No hump-back maid in all the earth,<BR>
For wise resolve, can match thy worth.<BR>
Thou art alone with constant zeal<BR>
Devoted to thy lady's weal.<BR>
Dear girl, without thy faithful aid<BR>
I had not marked the plot he laid.<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Full of all guile and sin and spite<BR>
Misshapen hump-backs shock the sight:<BR>
But thou art fair and formed to please,<BR>
Bent like a lily by the breeze.<BR>
I look thee o'er with watchful eye,<BR>
And in thy frame no fault can spy;<BR>
The chest so deep, the waist so trim,<BR>
So round the lines of breast and limb.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Thy cheeks with moonlike beauty shine,<BR>
And the warm wealth of youth is thine.<BR>
Thy legs, my girl, are long and neat,<BR>
And somewhat long thy dainty feet,<BR>
While stepping out before my face<BR>
Thou seemest like a crane to pace.<BR>
The thousand wiles are in thy breast<BR>
Which Sambara the fiend possessed,<BR>
And countless others all thine own,<BR>
O damsel sage, to thee are known.<BR>
Thy very hump becomes thee too,<BR>
O thou whose face is fair to view,<BR>
For there reside in endless store<BR>
Plots, wissard wiles, and warrior lore.<BR>
A golden chain I'll round it fling<BR>
When R&aacute;ma's flight makes Bharat king:<BR>
Yea, polished links of finest gold,<BR>
When once the wished for prize I hold<BR>
With naught to fear and none to hate,<BR>
Thy hump, dear maid, shall decorate.<BR>
A golden frontlet wrought with care,<BR>
And precious jewels shalt thou wear:<BR>
Two lovely robes around thee fold,<BR>
And walk a Goddess to behold,<BR>
Bidding the moon himself compare<BR>
His beauty with a face so fair.<BR>
With scent of precious sandal sweet<BR>
Down to the nails upon thy feet,<BR>
First of the household thou shalt go<BR>
And pay with scorn each battled foe.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kaikeyi's praise the damnel heard,<BR>
And thus again her lady stirred,<BR>
Who lay upon her beauteous bed<BR>
Like fire upon the altar fed:<BR>
'Dear Queen, they build the bridge in vain<BR>
When swollen streams are dry again.<BR>
Arise, thy glorious task complete,<BR>
And draw the king to thy retreat.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The large-eyed lady left her bower<BR>
Exulting in her pride of power,<BR>
And with the hump-back sought the gloom<BR>
And silence of the mourner's room.<BR>
The string of priceless pearls that huug<BR>
Around her neck to earth she flung,<BR>
With all the wealth and lustre lent<BR>
By precious gem and ornament.<BR>
Then, listening to her slave's advice,<BR>
Lay, like a nymph from Paradise.<BR>

<P>

<P>
As on the ground her limbs she laid<BR>
Once more she cried unto the maid:<BR>
'Soon must thou to the monarch say<BR>
Kaikeyi's soul has past away,<BR>
Or, R&aacute;ma banished as we planned,<BR>
My son made king shall rule the land.<BR>
No more for gold and gems I care,<BR>
For brave attire or dainty fare.<BR>
If R&aacute;ma should the throne ascend,<BR>
That very hour my life will end.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The royal lady wounded through<BR>
The bosom with the darts that flew<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Launched from the hump-back's tongue<BR>
Pressed both her hands upon her side,<BR>
And o'er and o'er again she cried<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With wildering fury stung:<BR>
'Yes, it shall be thy task to tell<BR>
That I have hurried hence to dwell<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In Yama's realms of woe,<BR>
Or happy Bharat shall be king,<BR>
And doomed to years of wandering<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kaus'aly&aacute;'s son shall go.<BR>
I heed not dainty viands now<BR>
Fair wreaths of flowers to twine my brow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Soft balm or precious scent:<BR>
My very life I count as naught,<BR>
Nothing on earth can claim my thought<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But R&aacute;ma's banishment.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She spoke these words of cruel ire;<BR>
Then stripping off her gay attire,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The cold bare floor she pressed.<BR>
So, falling from her home on high,<BR>
Some lovely daughter of the sky<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon the ground might rest.<BR>
With darkened brow and furious mien,<BR>
Stripped of her gems and wreath, the queen<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In spotless beauty lay,<BR>
Like heaven obscured with gathering cloud,<BR>
When shades of midnight darkness shroud<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each star's expiring ray.<BR>
