### CANTO CXVIII.: SÍTÁ'S REPLY.

Struck down with overwhelming shame  
She shrank within her trembling frame.  
Each word of Ráma's like a dart  
Had pierced the lady to the heart;  
And from her sweet eyes unrestrained  
The torrent of her sorrows, rained.  
Her weeping eyes at length she dried,  
And thus mid choking sobs replied:  
'Canst thou, a high-born prince, dismiss  
A hign-born dame with speech like this?  
Such words befit the meanest hind,  
Not princely birth and generous mind,  
By all my virtuous life I swear  
I am not what thy words declare.  
If some are faithless, wilt thou find  
No love and truth in womankind?  
Doubt others if thou wilt, but own  
The truth which all my life has shown.  
If, when the giant seized his prey,  
Within his hated arms I lay,  
And felt the grasp I dreaded, blame  
Fate and the robber, not thy dame.  
What could a helpless woman do?  
My heart was mine and still was true,  
Why when Hanúmán sent by thee  
Sought Lanká's town across the sea,  
Couldst thou not give, O lord of men,  
Thy sentence of rejection then?  
Then in the presence of the chief  
Death, ready death, had brought relief,  
Nor had I nursed in woe and pain  
This lingering life, alas in vain.  
Then hadst thou shunned the fruitless strife  
Nor jeopardied thy noble life,  
But spared thy friends and bold allies  
Their vain and weary enterprise.  
Is all forgotten, all? my birth,  
Named Janak's child, from fostering earth?  
That day of triumph when a maid  
My trembling hand in thine I laid?  
My meek obedience to thy will,  
My faithful love through joy and ill,  

That never failed at duty's call--  
O King, is all forgotten, all?'  

To Lakshman then she turned and spoke  
While sobs and sighs her utterance broke:  
'Sumitrá's son, a pile prepare,  
'My refuge in my dark despair.  
I will not live to bear this weight  
Of shame, forlorn and desolate.  
The kindled fire my woes shall end  
And be my best and surest friend.'  

His mournful eyes the hero raised  
And wistfully on Ráma gazed,  
In whose stern look no ruth was seen,  
No mercy for the weeping queen.  
No chieftain dared to meet those eyes,  
To pray, to question or advise.  

The word was passed, the wood was piled  
And fain to die stood Janak's child.  
She slowly paced around her lord.  
The Gods with reverent act adored,  
Then raising suppliant hands the dame  
Frayed humbly to the Lord of Flame;  
'As this fond heart by virtue swayed  
From Raghu's son has never strayed,  
So, universal witness, Fire  
Protect my body on the pyre,  
As Raghu's son has idly laid  
This charge on Sítá, hear and aid.'  

She ceased: and fearless to the last  
Within the flame's wild fury passed.  
Then rose a piercing cry from all  
Dames, children, men, who saw her fall  
Adorned with gems and gay attire  
Beneath the fury of the fire.
