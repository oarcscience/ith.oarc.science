<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO II.: VIR&Aacute;DHA.</H3>
<P>
Thus entertained he passed the night,<BR>
Then, with the morning's early light,<BR>
To all the hermits bade adieu<BR>
And sought his onward way anew.<BR>
He pierced the mighty forest where<BR>
Roamed many a deer and pard and bear:<BR>
Its ruined pools he scarce could see.<BR>
For creeper rent and prostrate tree,<BR>
Where shrill cicada's cries were heard,<BR>
And plaintive notes of many a bird.<BR>
Deep in the thickets of the wood<BR>
With Lakshman and his spouse he stood,<BR>
There in the horrid shade he saw<BR>
A giant passing nature's law:<BR>
Vast as some mountain-peak in size,<BR>
With mighty voice and sunken eyes,<BR>
Huge, hideous, tall, with monstrous face,<BR>
Most ghastly of his giant race.<BR>
A tiger's hide the R&aacute;kshas wore<BR>
Still reeking with the fat and gore:<BR>
Huge-faced, like Him who rules the dead,<BR>
All living things he struck with dread.<BR>
Three lions, tigers four, ten deer<BR>
He carried on his iron spear,<BR>
Two wolves, an elephant's head beside<BR>
With mighty tusks which blood-drops dyed.<BR>
When on the three his fierce eye fell,<BR>
He charged them with a roar and yell<BR>
As furious as the grisly King<BR>
When stricken worlds are perishing.<BR>
Then with a mighty roar that shook<BR>
The earth beneath their feet, he took<BR>
The trembling S&iacute;t&aacute; to his side.<BR>
Withdrew a little space, and cried:<BR>
'Ha, short lived wretches, ye who dare,<BR>
In hermit dress with matted hair,<BR>
Armed each with arrows, sword, and bow,<BR>
Through Dandak's pathless wood to go:<BR>
How with one dame, I bid you tell,<BR>
Can you among ascetics dwell?<BR>
Who are ye, sinners, who despise<BR>
The right, in holy men's disguise?<BR>
The great Vir&aacute;dha, day by day<BR>
Through this deep-tangled wood I stray,<BR>
And ever, armed with trusty steel,<BR>
I seize a saint to make my meal.<BR>
This woman young and fair of frame<BR>
Shall be the conquering giant's dame:<BR>
Your blood, ye things of evil life,<BR>
My lips shall quaff in battle strife.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke: and Janak's hapless child,<BR>
Scared by his speech so fierce and wild,<BR>

Trembled for terror, as a frail<BR>
Young plantain shivers in the gale.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma saw Vir&aacute;dha clasp<BR>
Fair S&iacute;t&aacute; in his mighty grasp,<BR>
Thus with pale lips that terror dried<BR>
The hero to his brother cried:<BR>
'O see Vir&aacute;dha's arm enfold<BR>
My darling in its cursed hold,--<BR>
The child of Janak best of kings,<BR>
My spouse whose soul to virtue clings,<BR>
Sweet princess, with pure glory bright,<BR>
Nursed in the lap of soft delight.<BR>
Now falls the blow Kaikey&iacute; meant,<BR>
Successful in her dark intent:<BR>
This day her cruel soul will be<BR>
Triumphant over thee and me.<BR>
Though Bharat on the throne is set,<BR>
Her greedy eyes look farther yet:<BR>
Me from my home she dared expel,<BR>
Me whom all creatures loved so well.<BR>
This fatal day at length, I ween,<BR>
Brings triumph to the younger queen.<BR>
I see with bitterest grief and shame<BR>
Another touch the Maithil dame.<BR>
Not loss of sire and royal power<BR>
So grieves me as this mournful hour.'<BR>

<P>
Thus in his anguish cried the chief:<BR>
Then drowned in tears, o'erwhelmed by grief,<BR>
Thus Lakshman in his anger spake,<BR>
Quick panting like a spell-bound snake:<BR>

<P>
'Canst thou, my brother, Indra's peer,<BR>
When I thy minister am near.<BR>
Thus grieve like some forsaken thing,<BR>
Thou, every creature's lord and king?<BR>
My vengeful shaft the fiend shall slay,<BR>
And earth shall drink his blood to-day.<BR>
The fury which my soul at first<BR>
Upon usurping Bharat nursed,<BR>
On this Vir&aacute;dha will I wreak<BR>
As Indra splits the mountain peak.<BR>
Winged by this arm's impetuous might<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My shaft with deadly force<BR>
The monster in the chest shall smite,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And fell his shattered corse.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       *        *        *        *        *<BR>
