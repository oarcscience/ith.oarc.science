<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLII.: M&Aacute;R&Iacute;CHA TRANSFORMED.</H3>
<P>
M&aacute;r&iacute;cha thus in wild unrest<BR>
With bitter words the king addressed.<BR>
Then to his giant lord in dread,<BR>
'Arise, and let us go,' he said.<BR>
'Ah, I have met that mighty lord<BR>
Armed with his shafts and bow and sword,<BR>
And if again that bow he bend<BR>
Our lives that very hour will end.<BR>

<P>
For none that warrior can provoke<BR>
And think to fly his deadly stroke.<BR>
Like Yama with his staff is he,<BR>
And his dread hand will slaughter thee.<BR>
What can I more? My words can find<BR>
No passage to thy stubborn mind.<BR>
I go, great King, thy task to share,<BR>
And my success attend thee there.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With that reply and bold consent<BR>
The giant king was well content.<BR>
He strained M&aacute;r&iacute;cha to his breast<BR>
And thus with joyful words addressed:<BR>
'There spoke a hero dauntless still,<BR>
Obedient to his master's will,<BR>
M&aacute;r&iacute;cha's proper self once more:<BR>
Some other took thy shape before.<BR>
Come, mount my jewelled car that flies.<BR>
Will-governed, through the yielding skies,<BR>
These asses, goblin-faced, shall bear<BR>
Us quickly through the fields of air.<BR>
Attract the lady with thy shape,<BR>
Then through the wood, at will, escape.<BR>
And I, when she has no defence,<BR>
Will seize the dame and bear her thence.<BR>
Again M&aacute;r&iacute;cha made reply,<BR>
Consent and will to signify.<BR>
With rapid speed the giants two<BR>
From the calm hermit dwelling flew,<BR>
Borne in that wondrous chariot, meet<BR>
For some great God's celestial seat.<BR>
They from their airy path looked down<BR>
On many a wood and many a town,<BR>
On lake and river, brook and rill,<BR>
City and realm and towering hill.<BR>
Soon he whom giant hosts obeyed,<BR>
M&aacute;r&iacute;cha by his side, surveyed<BR>
The dark expanse of Dandak wood<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma s hermit cottage stood.<BR>
They left the flying car, whereon<BR>
The wealth of gold and jewels shone,<BR>
And thus the giant king addressed<BR>
M&aacute;r&iacute;cha as his hand he pressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'M&aacute;r&iacute;cha, look! before our eyes<BR>
Round R&aacute;ma's home the plantains rise.<BR>
His hermitage is now in view:<BR>
Quick to the work we came to do!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;van spoke, M&aacute;r&iacute;cha heard<BR>
Obedient to his master's word,<BR>
Threw off his giant shape and near<BR>
The cottage strayed a beauteous deer.<BR>
With magic power, by rapid change.<BR>
His borrowed form was fair and strange.<BR>
A sapphire tipped each horn with light;<BR>
His face was black relieved with white.<BR>
The turkis and the ruby shed<BR>
A glory from his ears and head.<BR>
His arching neck was proudly raised,<BR>
And lazuares* beneath it blazed.<BR>
With roseate bloom his flanks were dyed,<BR>
And lotus tints adorned his hide.<BR>
His shape was fair*, compact*, and slight;<BR>

<P>
His hoofs--were carven lazulite.<BR>
His tail with every changing glow<BR>
Displayed the hues of Indra's bow.<BR>
With glossy skin so strangely flecked,<BR>
With tints of every gem bedecked.<BR>
A light o'er R&aacute;ma's home he sent,<BR>
And through the wood, where'er he went.<BR>
The giant clad in that strange dress<BR>
That took the soul with loveliness,<BR>
To charm the fair Videhan's eyes<BR>
With mingled wealth of mineral dyes,<BR>
Moved onward, cropping in his way,<BR>
The grass and grain and tender spray,<BR>
His coat with drops of silver bright,<BR>
A form to gaze on with delight,<BR>
He raised his fair neck as he went<BR>
To browse on bud and filament.<BR>
Now in the Cassia grove he strayed,<BR>
Now by the cot in plantains' shade.<BR>
Slowly and slowly on he came<BR>
To catch the glances of the dame,<BR>
And the tall deer of splendid hue<BR>
Shone full at length in S&iacute;t&aacute;'s view.<BR>
He roamed where'er his fancy chose<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma's leafy cottage rose.<BR>
Now near, now far, in careless ease,<BR>
He came and went among the trees.<BR>
Now with light feet he turned to fly,<BR>
Now, reassured, again drew nigh:<BR>
Now gambolled close with leap and bound,<BR>
Now lay upon the grassy ground:<BR>
Now sought the door, devoid of fear,<BR>
And mingled with the troop of deer;<BR>
Led them a little way, and thence<BR>
Again returned with confidence.<BR>
Now flying far, now turning back<BR>
Emboldened on his former track,<BR>
Seeking to win the lady's glance<BR>
He wandered through the green expanse.<BR>
Then thronging round, the woodland deer<BR>
Gazed on his form with wondering fear;<BR>
A while they followed where he led,<BR>
Then snuffed the tainted gale and fled.<BR>
The giant, though he longed to slay<BR>
The startled quarry, spared the prey,<BR>
And mindful of the shape he wore<BR>
To veil his nature, still forbore.<BR>
Then S&iacute;t&aacute; of the glorious eye,<BR>
Returning from her task drew nigh;<BR>
For she had sought the wood to bring<BR>
Each loveliest flower of early spring.<BR>
Now would the bright-eyed lady choose<BR>
Some gorgeous bud with blending hues,<BR>
Now plucked the mango's spray, and now<BR>
The bloom from an As'oka bough.<BR>
She with her beauteous form, unmeet<BR>
For woodland life and lone retreat,<BR>
That wondrous dappled deer beheld<BR>
Gemmed with rich pearls, unparalleled,<BR>
His silver hair the lady saw,<BR>
His radiant teeth and lips and jaw,<BR>

<P>
And gazed with rapture as her eyes<BR>
Expanded in their glad surprise.<BR>
And when the false deer's glances fell<BR>
On her whom R&aacute;ma loved so well,<BR>
He wandered here and there, and cast<BR>
A luminous beauty as be passed;<BR>
And Janak's child with strange delight<BR>
Kept gazing on the unwonted sight.<BR>
