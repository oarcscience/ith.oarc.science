<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LX.: KAUS'ALY&Aacute; CONSOLED.</H3>
<P>
As Queen Kaus'aly&aacute;, trembling much,<BR>
As blighted by a goblin's touch,<BR>
Still lying prostrate, half awoke<BR>
To consciousness,'twas thus she spoke:<BR>
'Bear me away, Sumantra, far,<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma, S&iacute;t&aacute;, Lakshman are.<BR>
Bereft of them I have no power<BR>
To linger on a single hour.<BR>

<P>
Again, I pray, thy steps retrace,<BR>
And me in Dandak forest place,<BR>
For after them I needs must go,<BR>
Or sink to Yama's realms below<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His utterance choked by tears that rolled<BR>
Down from their fountains uncontrolled,<BR>
With suppliant hands the charioteer<BR>
Thus spake, the lady's heart to cheer:<BR>
'Dismiss thy grief, despair, and dread<BR>
That fills thy soul, of sorrow bred,<BR>
For pain and anguish thrown aside.<BR>
Will Rama in the wood abide.<BR>
And Lakshman, with unfailing care<BR>
Will guard the feet of Rama there,<BR>
Earning, with governed sense, the prize<BR>
That waits on duty in the skies.<BR>
And Sita in the wild as well<BR>
As in her own dear home will dwell;<BR>
To Rama all her heart she gives,<BR>
And free from doubt and terror lives.<BR>
No faintest sign of care or woe<BR>
The features of the lady show:<BR>
Rethinks Videha's pride was made<BR>
For exile in the forest shade.<BR>
E'en as of old she used to rove<BR>
Delighted in the city's grove,<BR>
Thus, even thus she joys to tread<BR>
The woodlands uninhabited.<BR>
Like a young child, her face as fair<BR>
As the young moon, she wanders there.<BR>
What though in lonely woods she stray<BR>
Still Rama is her joy and stay:<BR>
All his the heart no sorrow bends,<BR>
Her very life on him depends.<BR>
For, if her lord she might not see,<BR>
Ayodhy'a like the wood would be.<BR>
She bids him, as she roams, declare<BR>
The names of towns and hamlets there,<BR>
Marks various trees that meet her eye,<BR>
And many a brook that hurries by,<BR>
And Janak's daughter seems home<BR>
When Rama or his brother spanks<BR>
And gives the answer that she seeks.<BR>
This, Lady, I remember well,<BR>
Nor angry words have to tell:<BR>
Reproaches at Kaikey'i shot,<BR>
Such, queen, my mind remembers not.'<BR>
The speech when Sita's wrath was high,<BR>
Sumantra passed in silence by,<BR>
That so his pleasant words might<BR>
With sweet report Kaulay'a's ear.<BR>
Her moonlike beauty suffers not<BR>
Though winds be rude and suns be hot:<BR>
The way, the danger, and the toil<BR>
Her gentle lustre may not soil.<BR>
Like the red liiy's leafy crown<BR>
Or as the fair full moon looks down,<BR>
So the Videhan lady's face<BR>
Still shines with undimmished grace.<BR>
What if the borrowed colours throw<BR>

<P>
O'er her fine feet no row glow,<BR>
Still with their natural tints they spread<BR>
A lotus glory where they tread.<BR>
In sportive grace she walks the ground<BR>
And sweet her chiming anklets sound.<BR>
No jewels clasp the faultless limb:<BR>
She leaves them all for love of him.<BR>
If in the woods her gentle eye<BR>
A lion sees, or tiger nigh,<BR>
Or elephant, she fears no ill<BR>
For Rama's arm supports her still,<BR>
No longer be their fate deplored,<BR>
Nor thine, nor that of Kosal's lord,<BR>
For conduct such as theirs shall buy<BR>
Wide glory that can never die.<BR>
For casting grief and care away,<BR>
Delighting in the forest, they<BR>
With joyful spirits, blithe and gay,<BR>
Set forward on the ancient way<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where mighty saints have led:<BR>
Their highest aim, their dearest care<BR>
To keep their father's honour fair,<BR>
Observing still the oath he sware,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They roam, on wild fruit fed.'<BR>
Thus with persuasive art he tried<BR>
To turn her from her grief aside,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By soothing fancies won.<BR>
But still she gave her sorrow vent:<BR>
'Ah Rama,' was her shrill lament,<BR>
'My love, my son, my son!'<BR>
