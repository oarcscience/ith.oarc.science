<P>
Like some proud tree before the blast<BR>
Brave B&aacute;li to the ground was cast,<BR>
Where prostrate in the dust he rolled<BR>
Clad in the sheen of glistening gold,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<A NAME="page_344"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 344</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
As when uptorn the standard lies<BR>
Of the great God who rules the skies.<BR>
When low upon the earth was laid<BR>
The lord whom V&aacute;nar tribes obeyed,<BR>
Dark as a moonless sky no more<BR>
His land her joyous aspect wore.<BR>
Though low in dust and mire was rolled<BR>
The form of B&aacute;li lofty-souled,<BR>
Still life and valour, might and grace<BR>
Clung to their well-loved dwelling-place.<BR>
That golden chain with rich gems set,<BR>
The choicest gift of S&aacute;kra, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> yet<BR>
Preserved his life nor let decay<BR>
Steal strength and beauty's light away.<BR>
Still from that chain divinely wrought<BR>
His dusky form a glory caught,<BR>
As a dark cloud, when day is done,<BR>
Made splendid by the dying sun.<BR>
As fell the hero, crushed in fight,<BR>
There beamed afar a triple light<BR>
From limbs, from chain, from shaft that drank<BR>
His life-blood as the warrior sank.<BR>
The never-failing shaft, impelled<BR>
By the great bow which R&aacute;ma held,<BR>
Brought bliss supreme, and lit the way<BR>
To Brahm&aacute;'s worlds which ne'er decay. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  R&aacute;ma and Lakshman nearer drew<BR>
The mighty fallen foe to view,<BR>
Mahendra's son, the brave and bold,<BR>
The monarch with his chain of gold,<BR>
With lustrous face and tawny eyes,<BR>
Broad chest, and arms of wondrous size,<BR>
Like Lord Mahendra fierce in fight,<BR>
Or Vishnu's never-conquered might,<BR>
Now fallen like Yay&aacute;il &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> sent<BR>
From heaven, his store of merit spent.<BR>
Like the bright flame that pales and dies,<BR>
Like the great sun who fires the skies,<BR>
Doomed in the general doom to fall<BR>
When time shall end and ruin all.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The wounded B&aacute;li, when he saw<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman nearer draw.<BR>
Keen words to Raghu's son, impressed<BR>
With justice' holy stamp, addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'What fame, from one thou hast not slain<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
In front of battle, canst thou gain,<BR>
Whose secret hand has laid me low<BR>
When madly fighting with my foe?<BR>
From every tongue thy glory rings,<BR>
A scion of a line of kings,<BR>
True to thy vows, of noblest race,<BR>
With every gentle gift and grace:<BR>
Whose tender heart for woe can feel,<BR>
And joy in every creature's weal:<BR>
Whose breast with high ambition swell--<BR>
Knows duty's claim and ne'er rebels.<BR>
They praise thy valour, patience, ruth,<BR>
Thy firmness, self-restrain, and truth<BR>
Thy hand prepared for sin's control.<BR>
All virtues of a princely soul.<BR>
I thought of all these gifts of thine,<BR>
And glories of an ancient line,<BR>
I set my T&aacute;r&aacute;'s tears at naught,<BR>
I met Sugr&iacute;va and we fought.<BR>
O R&aacute;ma, till this fatal morn<BR>
I held that thou wouldst surely scorn<BR>
To strike me as I fought my foe<BR>
And thought not of a stranger's blow,<BR>
But now thine evil heart is shown,<BR>
A yawning well with grass o'ergrown.<BR>
Thou wearest virtue's badge,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> but guile<BR>
And meanest sin thy soul defile.<BR>
I took thee not for treacherous fire,<BR>
A sinner clad in saint's attire;<BR>
Nor deemed thou idly wouldst profess<BR>
The show and garb of righteousness.<BR>
In fenced town, in open land,<BR>
Ne'er hast thou suffered at this hand,<BR>
Nor canst of proud contempt complain:<BR>
Then wherefore is the guiltless slain!<BR>
My harmless life in woods I lead,<BR>
On forest fruits and roots I feed.<BR>
My foeman in the field I sought,<BR>
And ne'er with thee, O R&aacute;ma, fought.<BR>
Upon thy limbs, O King, I see<BR>
The raiment of a devotee;<BR>
And how can one like thee, who springs<BR>
From a proud line of ancient kings.<BR>
Beneath fair virtue's mask, disgrace<BR>
His lineage by a deed so base?<BR>
From Raghu is thy long descent,<BR>
For duteous deeds pr&euml;eminent:<BR>
Why, sinner clad in saintly dress,<BR>
Roamest thou through the wilderness?<BR>
Truth, valour, justice free from spot,<BR>
The hand that gives and grudges not,<BR>
The might that strikes the sinner down,<BR>
These bring a prince his best renown.<BR>
Here in the woods, O King, we live<BR>
On roots and fruit which branches give.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>

Thus nature framed our harmless race:<BR>
Thou art a man supreme in place.<BR>
Silver and gold and land provoke<BR>
The fierce attack, the robber's stroke.<BR>
Canst thou desire this wild retreat,<BR>
The berries and the fruit we eat?<BR>
'Tis not for mighty kings to tread<BR>
The flowery path, by pleasure led.<BR>
Theirs be the arm that crushes sin,<BR>
Theirs the soft grace to woo and win:<BR>
The steadfast will that guides the state,<BR>
Wise favour to the good and great;<BR>
And for all time are kings renowned<BR>
Who blend these arts and ne'er confound,<BR>
But thou art weak and swift to ire,<BR>
Unstable, slave of each desire.<BR>
Thou tramplest duty in the dust,<BR>
And in thy bow is all thy trust.<BR>
Thou carest naught for noble gain,<BR>
And treatest virtue with disdain,<BR>
While every sense its captive draws<BR>
To follow pleasure's changing laws,<BR>
I wronged thee not in word or deed,<BR>
But by thy deadly dart I bleed.<BR>
What wilt thou, mid the virtuous, say<BR>
To purge thy lasting stain away?<BR>
All these, O King, must sink to hell,<BR>
The regicide, the infidel,<BR>
He who in blood and slaughter joys,<BR>
A Br&aacute;hman or a cow destroys,<BR>
Untimely weds in law's despite<BR>
Scorning an elder brother's right,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Who dares his Teacher's bed ascend,<BR>
The miser, spy, and treacherous friend.<BR>
These impious wretches, one and all,<BR>
Must to the hell of sinners fall<BR>
My skin the holy may not wear,<BR>
Useless to thee my bones and hair;<BR>
Nor may my slaughtered body be<BR>
The food of devotees like thee.<BR>
These five-toed things a man may slay<BR>
And feed upon the fallen prey;<BR>
The mailed rhinoceros may die,<BR>
And, with the hare his food supply.<BR>
Iguanas he may kill and eat,<BR>

<P>

<P>
With porcupine and tortoise meat.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
But all the wise account it sin<BR>
To touch my bones and hair and skin.<BR>
My flesh they may not eat; and I<BR>
A useless prey, O R&aacute;ma, die.<BR>
In vain my T&aacute;r&aacute; reasoned well,<BR>
On dull deaf ears her counsel fell.<BR>
I scorned her words though sooth and sweet,<BR>
And hither rushed my fate to meet,<BR>
Ah for the land thou rulest! she<BR>
Finds no protection, lord, from thee,<BR>
Neglected like some noble dame<BR>
By a vile husband dead to shame.<BR>
Mean-hearted coward, false and vile.<BR>
Whose cruel soul delights in guile,<BR>
Could Das'aratha, noblest king,<BR>
Beget so mean and base a thing?<BR>
Alas! an elephant, in form<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma, in a maddening storm<BR>
Of passion casting to the ground<BR>
The girth of law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> that clipped him round,<BR>
Too wildly passionate to feel<BR>
The prick of duty's guiding steel,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>
Has charged me unawares, and dead<BR>
I fall beneath his murderous tread<BR>
How, stained with this my base defeat.<BR>
How wilt thou dare, where good men meet,<BR>
To speak, when every tongue will blame<BR>
With keen reproach this deed of shame?<BR>
Such hero strength and valour, shown<BR>
Upon the innocent alone,<BR>
Thou hast not proved in manly strife<BR>
On him who robbed thee of thy wife.<BR>
Hadst thou but fought in open field<BR>
And met me boldly unconcealed,<BR>
This day had been thy fate to fall,<BR>
Slain by this hand, to Yama's hall.<BR>
In vain I strove, and struck by thee<BR>
Fell by a hand I could not see.<BR>
Thus bites a snake, for sins of yore,<BR>
A sleeping man who wakes no more.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va's foeman thou hast killed,<BR>
And thus his heart's desire fulfilled<BR>
But, R&aacute;ma, hadst thou sought me first,<BR>
And told the hope thy soul has nursed,<BR>
That very day had I restored<BR>
Tbe Maithil lady to her lord;<BR>
And, binding R&aacute;van with a chain,<BR>
Had laid him at thy feet unslain.<BR>

Yea, were she sunk in deepest hell,<BR>
Or whelmed beneath the ocean's swell,<BR>
I would have followed on her track<BR>
And brought the rescued lady back,<BR>
As Hayagr&iacute;va&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="ry292.htm#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> once set free<BR>
From hell the white As'vatar&iacute;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="ry292.htm#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
That when my spirit wings its flight<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va reign, is just and right.<BR>
But most unjust, O King, that I,<BR>
Slain by thy treacherous hand, should lie,<BR>
Be still, my heart: this earthly state<BR>
Is darkly ruled by sovereign Fate.<BR>
The realm is lost and won: defy<BR>
Thy questioners with apt reply.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="ry292.htm#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_590"></A><A HREF="ry291.htm#fr_590">344:2b</A>  There is much inconsistency in the
passages of the poem in which the V&aacute;nara
are spoken of, which seems to point to two
<A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A>: widely different legends. The V&aacute;nars are
generally represented as semi-divine beings
with preternatural powers, living in houses
and eating and drinking like men sometimes
as here, as monkeys pure and simple,
living is woods and eating fruit and roots.</P>
