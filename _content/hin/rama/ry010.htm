<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO VIII.: SUMANTRA'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
But splendid, just, and great of mind,<BR>
The childless king for offspring pined.<BR>
No son had he his name to grace,<BR>
Transmitter of his royal race.<BR>
Long had his anxious bosom wrought,<BR>
And as he pondered rose the thought:<BR>
'A votive steed 'twere good to slay,<BR>
So might a son the gift repay.'<BR>
Before his lords his plan he laid,<BR>
And bade them with their wisdom aid:<BR>
Then with these words Sumantra, best<BR>
Of royal counsellors, addressed:<BR>
'Hither, Vas'ishtha at their head,<BR>
Let all my priestly guides be led.'<BR>
To him Sumantra made reply:<BR>
'Hear, Sire, a tale of days gone by.<BR>
To many a sage in time of old,<BR>
Sanatkum&aacute;r, the saint, foretold<BR>
How from thine ancient line, O King,<BR>
A son, when years came round, should spring.<BR>
'Here dwells,' 'twas thus the seer began,<BR>
'Of Kas'yap's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> race, a holy man,<BR>
Vibh&aacute;ndak named: to him shall spring<BR>
A son, the famous Rishyas'ring.<BR>
Bred with the deer that round him roam,<BR>
The wood shall be that hermit's home.<BR>


<P>


<P>
To him no mortal shall be known<BR>
Except his holy sire alone.<BR>
Still by those laws shall he abide<BR>
Which lives of youthful Br&aacute;hmans guide,<BR>
Obedient to the strictest rule<BR>
That forms the young ascetic's school:<BR>
And all the wondering world shall hear<BR>
Of his stern life and penance drear;<BR>
His care to nurse the holy fire<BR>
And do the bidding of his sire.<BR>
Then, seated on the Angas' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> throne,<BR>
Shall Lomap&aacute;d to fame be known.<BR>
But folly wrought by that great king<BR>
A plague upon the land shall bring;<BR>
No rain for many a year shall fall<BR>
And grievous drought shall ruin all.<BR>
The troubled king with many a prayer<BR>
Shall bid the priests some cure declare:<BR>
'The lore of Heaven 'tis yours to know,<BR>
Nor are ye blind to things below:<BR>
Declare, O holy men, the way<BR>
This plague to expiate and stay.'<BR>
Those best of Br&aacute;hmans shall reply:<BR>
'By every art, O Monarch, try<BR>
Hither to bring Vibh&aacute;ndak's child,<BR>
Persuaded, captured, or beguiled.<BR>
And when the boy is hither led<BR>
To him thy daughter duly wed.'<BR>

<P>
But how to bring that wondrous boy<BR>
His troubled thoughts will long employ,<BR>
And hopeless to achieve the task<BR>
He counsel of his lords will ask,<BR>
And bid his priests and servants bring<BR>
With honour saintly Rishyas'ring.<BR>
But when they hear the monarch's speech,<BR>
All these their master will beseech,<BR>
With trembling hearts and looks of woe,<BR>
To spare them, for they fear to go.<BR>
And many a plan will they declare<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And crafty plots will frame,<BR>
And promise fair to show him there,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Unforced, with none to blame.<BR>
On every word his lords shall say,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The king will meditate,<BR>
And on the third returning day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Recall them to debate.<BR>
Then this shall be the plan agreed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That damsels shall be sent<BR>
Attired in holy hermits' weed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And skilled in blandishment,<BR>
That they the hermit may beguile<BR>
With every art and amorous wile<BR>


<P>
<A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Whose use they know so well,<BR>
And by their witcheries seduce<BR>
The unsuspecting young recluse<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To leave his father's cell.<BR>
Then when the boy with willing feet<BR>
Shall wander from his calm retreat<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And in that city stand,<BR>
The troubles of the king shall end,<BR>
And streams of blessed rain descend<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon the thirsty land.<BR>
Thus shall the holy Rishyas'ring<BR>
To Lomap&aacute;d, the mighty king,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By wedlock be allied;<BR>
For S'&aacute;nt&aacute;, fairest of the fair,<BR>
In mind and grace beyond compare,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Shall be his royal bride.<BR>
He, at the Offering of the Steed,<BR>
The flames with holy oil shall feed,<BR>
And for King Das'aratha gain<BR>
Sons whom his prayers have begged in vain.'<BR>
'I have repeated, Sire, thus far,<BR>
The words of old Sanatkum&aacute;r,<BR>
In order as he spoke them then<BR>
Amid the crowd of holy men.'<BR>
Then Das'aratha cried with joy,<BR>
'Say how they brought the hermit boy.'<BR>
