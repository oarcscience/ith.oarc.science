<P>
A while they sat, each lip compressed,<BR>
Then Bharat thus his chief addressed:<BR>
'My mother here was made content;<BR>
To me was given the government.<BR>
This now, my lord, I yield to thee:<BR>
Enjoy it, from all trouble free.<BR>
Like a great bridge the floods have rent,<BR>
Impetuous in their wild descent,<BR>
All other hands but thine in vain<BR>
Would strive the burthen to maintain.<BR>
In vain the ass with steeds would vie,<BR>
With T&aacute;rkshya, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_381"></A><A HREF="#fn_381"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> birds that wing the sky;<BR>
So, lord of men, my power is slight<BR>
To rival thine imperial might.<BR>
Great joys his happy days attend<BR>
On whom the hopes of men depend,<BR>
But wretched is the life he leads<BR>
Who still the aid of others needs.<BR>
And if the seed a man has sown,<BR>
With care and kindly nurture grown,<BR>
Rear its huge trunk and spring in time<BR>
Too bulky for a dwarf to climb,<BR>
Yet, with perpetual blossom gay,<BR>
No fruit upon its boughs display,<BR>
Ne'er can that tree, thus nursed in vain,<BR>
Approval of the virtuous gain.<BR>
The simile is meant to be<BR>
Applied, O mighty-armed, to thee,<BR>
Because, our lord and leader, thou<BR>
Protectest not thy people now.<BR>
O, be the longing wish fulfilled<BR>
Of every chief of house and guild,<BR>
To see again their sun-bright lord<BR>
Victorious to his realm restored!<BR>
As thou returnest through the crowd<BR>
Let roars of elephants be loud.<BR>
And each fair woman lift her voice<BR>
And in her new-found king rejoice.'<BR>
&nbsp; The people all with longing moved,<BR>
The words that Bharat spoke approved,<BR>
And crowding near to R&aacute;ma pressed<BR>
The hero with the same request.<BR>
The steadfast R&aacute;ma, when he viewed<BR>
His glorious brother's mournful mood,<BR>
With each ambitious thought controlled,<BR>
Thus the lamenting prince consoled:<BR>
'I cannot do the things I will,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma is but mortal still.<BR>
Fate with supreme, resistless law<BR>
This way and that its slave will draw,<BR>
All gathered heaps must waste away,<BR>
All lofty lore and powers decay.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Death is the end of life, and all,<BR>
Now firmly joined, apart must fall.<BR>
One fear the ripened fruit must know,<BR>
To fall upon the earth below;<BR>
So every man who draws his breath<BR>
Must fear inevitable death.<BR>
The pillared mansion, high, compact,<BR>
Must fall by Time's strong hand attacked;<BR>
So mortal men, the gradual prey<BR>
Of old and ruthless death, decay.<BR>
The night that flies no more returns:<BR>
Yamun&aacute; for the Ocean yearns:<BR>
Swift her impetuous waters flee,<BR>
But roll not backward from the sea.<BR>
The days and nights pass swiftly by<BR>
And steal our moments as they fly.<BR>
E'en as the sun's unpitying rays<BR>
Drink up the floods in summer blaze.<BR>
Then for thyself lament and leave<BR>
For death of other men to grieve,<BR>
For if thou go or if thou stay.<BR>
Thy life is shorter day by day.<BR>
Death travels with us; death attends<BR>
Our steps until our journey ends.<BR>
Death, when the traveller wins the goal,<BR>
Returns with the returning soul.<BR>
The flowing hair grown* white and thin,<BR>
And wrinkles mark the altered skin.<BR>
The ills of age man's strength assail:<BR>
Ah, what can mortal power avail?<BR>
Men joy to see the sun arise,<BR>
They watch him set with joyful eyes:<BR>
But ne'er reflect, too blind to see,<BR>
How fast their own brief moments flee.<BR>
With lovely change for ever new<BR>
The seasons' sweet return they view,<BR>
Nor think with heedless hearts the while<BR>
That lives decay as seasons smile.<BR>
As haply on the boundless main<BR>
Meet drifting logs and part again.<BR>
So wives and children, friends and gold,<BR>
Oures for a little time we hold:<BR>
Soon by resistless laws of fate<BR>
To meet no more we separate.<BR>
In all this changing world not one<BR>
The common lot of all can shun:<BR>
Then why with useless tears deplore<BR>
The dead whom tears can bring no more?<BR>
As one might stand upon the way<BR>
And to a troop of travellers say:<BR>
'If ye allow it, sirs, I too<BR>
Will travel on the road with you:'<BR>
So why should mortal man lament<BR>
When on that path his feet are bent<BR>
Which all men living needs must tread,<BR>
Where sire and ancestors have led?<BR>
Life flies as torrents downward fall<BR>
Speeding away without recall,<BR>
So virtue should our thoughts engage,<BR>
For bliss &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> is mortals' heritage,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_215"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
By ceaseless care and earnest zeal<BR>
For servants and for people's weal,<BR>
By gifts, by duty nobly done,<BR>
Our glorious sire the skies has won.<BR>
Our lord the king, o'er earth who reigned,<BR>
A blissful home in heaven has gained<BR>
By wealth in ample largess spent,<BR>
And many a rite magnificent:<BR>
With constant joy from first to last<BR>
A long and noble life he passed,<BR>
Praised by the good, no tears should dim<BR>
Our eyes, O brother dear, for him.<BR>
His human body, worn and tried<BR>
By length of days, he cast aside,<BR>
And gained the godlike bliss to stray<BR>
In Brahma's heavenly home for aye.<BR>
"For such the wise as we are, deep<BR>
In Veda lore, should never weep.<BR>
Those who are firm and ever wise<BR>
Spurn vain lament and idle sighs.<BR>
Be self-possessed: thy grief restrain:<BR>
Go, in that city dwell again.<BR>
Return, O best of men, and be<BR>
Obedient to our sire's decree,<BR>
While I with every care fulfil<BR>
Our holy father's righteous will,<BR>
Observing in the lonely wood<BR>
His charge approved by all the good,'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma of the lofty mind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To Bharat spoke his righteous speech,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By every argument designed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Obedience to his sire to teach,<BR>
