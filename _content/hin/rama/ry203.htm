<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, having slain in fight<BR>
Vir&aacute;dha of terrific might,<BR>
With gentle words his spouse consoled,<BR>
And clasped her in his loving hold.<BR>
Then to his brother nobly brave<BR>
The valiant prince his counsel gave:<BR>
'Wild are these woods around us spread;<BR>
And hard and rough the ground to tread:<BR>
We, O my brother, ne'er nave viewed<BR>
So dark and drear a solitude:<BR>
To S'arabhanga let us haste,<BR>
Whom wealth of holy works has graced.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma spoke, and took the road<BR>
To S'arabhanga's pure abode.<BR>
But near that saint whose lustre vied<BR>
With Gods, by penance purified,<BR>
With startled eyes the prince beheld<BR>
A wondrous sight unparalleled.<BR>
In splendour like the fire and sun<BR>
He saw a great and glorious one.<BR>
Upon a noble car he rode,<BR>
And many a God behind him glowed:<BR>
And earth beneath his feet unpressed &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_411"></A><A HREF="#fn_411"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The monarch of the skies confessed.<BR>
Ablaze with gems, no dust might dim<BR>
The bright attire that covered him.<BR>
Arrayed like him, on every side<BR>
High saints their master glorified.<BR>
Near, borne in air, appeared in view<BR>
His car which tawny coursers drew,<BR>
Like silver cloud, the moon, or sun<BR>
Ere yet the day is well begun.<BR>
Wreathed with gay garlands, o'er his head<BR>
A pure white canopy was spread,<BR>
And lovely nymphs stood nigh to hold<BR>
Fair chouris with their sticks of gold,<BR>
Which, waving in each gentle hand,<BR>
The forehead of their monarch fanned.<BR>
God, saint, and bard, a radiant ring,<BR>
5ang glory to their heavenly King:<BR>
Forth into joyful lauds they burst<BR>
As Indra with the sage conversed.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, when his wondering eyes<BR>
Beheld the monarch of the skies,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_234"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 234</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
To Lakshman quickly called, and showed<BR>
The car wherein Lord Indra rode:<BR>
'See, brother, see that air-borne car,<BR>
Whose wondrous glory shines afar:<BR>
Wherefrom so bright a lustre streams<BR>
That like a falling sun it seems<BR>
These are the steeds whose fame we know,<BR>
Of heavenly race through heaven they go:<BR>
These are the steeds who bear the yoke<BR>
Of S'akra, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_412"></A><A HREF="#fn_412"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Him whom all invoke.<BR>
Behold these youths, a glorious band,<BR>
Toward every wind a hundred stand:<BR>
A sword in each right hand is borne,<BR>
And rings of gold their arms adorn.<BR>
What might in every broad deep chest<BR>
And club-like arm is manifest!<BR>
Clothed in attire of crimson hue<BR>
They show like tigers fierce to view.<BR>
Great chains of gold each warder deck,<BR>
Gleaming like fire beneath his neck.<BR>
The age of each fair youth appears<BR>
Some score and five of human years:<BR>
The ever-blooming prime which they<BR>
Who live in heaven retain for aye:<BR>
Such mien these lordly beings wear,<BR>
Heroic youths, most bright and fair.<BR>
Now, brother, in this spot, I pray,<BR>
With the Videhan lady stay,<BR>
Till I have certain knowledge who<BR>
This being is, so bright to view.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke, and turning from the spot<BR>
Sought S'arabhanga's hermit cot.<BR>
But when the lord of S'ach&iacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_413"></A><A HREF="#fn_413"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> saw<BR>
The son of Raghu near him draw,<BR>
He hastened of the sage to take<BR>
His leave, and to his followers spake:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'See, R&aacute;ma bends his steps this way,<BR>
But ere he yet a word can say,<BR>
Come, fly to our celestial sphere;<BR>
It is not meet he see me here.<BR>
Soon victor and triumphant he<BR>
In fitter time shall look on me.<BR>
Before him still a great emprise,<BR>
A task too hard for others, lies.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then with all marks of honour high<BR>
The Thunderer bade the saint good-bye,<BR>
And in his car which coursers drew<BR>
Away to heaven the conqueror flew.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, Lakshman, and the dame,<BR>
To S'arabhanga nearer came,<BR>
Who sat beside the holy flame.<BR>
Before the ancient sage they bent,<BR>
And clasped his feet most reverent;<BR>
Then at his invitation found<BR>
A seat beside him on the ground.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma prayed the sage would deign<BR>
Lord Indra's visit to explain;<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And thus at length the holy man<BR>
In answer to his prayer began:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'This Lord of boons has sought me here<BR>
To waft me hence to Brahm&aacute;'s sphere,<BR>
Won by my penance long and stern,--<BR>
A home the lawless ne'er can earn.<BR>
But when I knew that thou wast nigh,<BR>
To Brahm&aacute;'s world I could not fly<BR>
Until these longing eyes were blest<BR>
With seeing thee, mine honoured guest.<BR>
Since thou, O Prince, hast cheered my sight,<BR>
Great-hearted lover of the right,<BR>
To heavenly spheres will I repair<BR>
And bliss supreme that waits me there.<BR>
For I have won, dear Prince, my way<BR>
To those fair worlds which ne'er decay,<BR>
Celestial seat of Brahm&aacute;'s reign:<BR>
Be thine, with me, those worlds to gain.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then master, of all sacred lore,<BR>
Spake R&aacute;ma to the saint once more:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'I, even I, illustrious sage,<BR>
Will make those worlds mine heritage:<BR>
But now, I pray, some home assign<BR>
Within this holy grove of thine.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma, Indra's peer in might,<BR>
Addressed the aged anchorite:<BR>
And he, with wisdom well endued,<BR>
To Raghu's son his speech renewed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Sut&iacute;kshna's woodland home is near,<BR>
A glorious saint of life austere,<BR>
True to the path of duty; he<BR>
With highest bliss will prosper thee.<BR>
Against the stream thy course must be<BR>
Of this fair brook Mand&aacute;kin&iacute;,<BR>
Whereon light rafts like blossoms glide;<BR>
Then to his cottage turn aside.<BR>
There lies thy path: but ere thou go,<BR>
Look on me, dear one, till I throw<BR>
Aside this mould that girds me in,<BR>
As casts the snake his withered skin.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke, the fire in order laid<BR>
With holy oil due offerings made,<BR>
And S'ar&aacute;bhanga, glorious sire,<BR>
Laid down his body in the fire.<BR>
Then rose the flame above his head,<BR>
On skin, blood, flesh, and bones it fed,<BR>
Till forth, transformed, with radiant hue<BR>
Of tender youth, he rose anew,<BR>
Far-shining in his bright attire<BR>
Came S'ar&aacute;bhanga from the pyre:<BR>
Above the home of saints, and those<BR>
Who feed the quenchless flame, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_414"></A><A HREF="#fn_414"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> he rose:<BR>
Beyond the seat of Gods he passed,<BR>
And Brahm&aacute;'s sphere was gained at last.<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_235"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 235</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The noblest of the twice-born race,<BR>
For holy works supreme in place,<BR>
The Mighty Father there beheld<BR>
Girt round by hosts unparalleled;<BR>
And Brahm&aacute; joying at the sight<BR>
Welcomed the glorious anchorite.<BR>
