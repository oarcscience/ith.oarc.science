<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLII.: DAS'ARATHA'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
While yet the dust was seen afar<BR>
That marked the course of R&aacute;ma's car,<BR>
The glory of Ikshv&aacute;ku's race<BR>
Turned not away his eager face.<BR>
While yet his duteous son he saw<BR>
He could not once his gaze withdraw,<BR>
But rooted to the spot remained<BR>
With eyes that after R&aacute;ma strained.<BR>
But when that dust no more he viewed,<BR>
Fainting he fell by grief subdued.<BR>


<P>

<P>


<P>
To his right hand Kaus'aly&aacute; went,<BR>
And ready aid the lady lent,<BR>
While Bharat's loving mother tried<BR>
To raise him on the other side.<BR>
The king, within whose ordered soul<BR>
Justice and virtue held control,<BR>
To Queen Kaikey&iacute; turned and said,<BR>
With every sense disquieted:<BR>
'Touch me not, thou whose soul can plot<BR>
All sin. Kaikey&iacute;, touch me not.<BR>
No loving wife, no friend to me,<BR>
I ne'er again would look on thee;<BR>
Ne'er from this day have aught to do<BR>
With thee and all thy retinue;<BR>
Thee whom no virtuous thoughts restrain,<BR>
Whose selfish heart seeks only gain.<BR>
The hand I laid in mine, O dame,<BR>
The steps we took around the flame, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
And all that links thy life to mine<BR>
Here and hereafter I resign.<BR>
If Bharat too, thy darling son,<BR>
Joy in the rule thy art has won,<BR>
Ne'er may the funeral offerings paid<BR>
By his false hand approach my shade.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then while the dust upon him hung,<BR>
The monarch to Kaus'aly&aacute; clung,<BR>
And she with mournful steps and slow<BR>
Turned to the palace, worn with woe.<BR>
As one whose hand has touched the fire,<BR>
Or slain a Br&aacute;hman in his ire,<BR>
He felt his heart with sorrow torn<BR>
Still thinking of his son forlorn.<BR>
Each step was torture, as the road<BR>
The traces of the chariot showed,<BR>
And as the shadowed sun grows dim<BR>
So cure and anguish darkened him.<BR>
He raised a cry, by woe distraught,<BR>
As of his son again he thought.<BR>
And judging that the car had sped<BR>
Beyond the city, thus he said:<BR>
'I still behold the foot-prints made<BR>
By the good horses that conveyed<BR>
My son afar: these marks I see,<BR>
But high-souled R&aacute;ma, where is he?<BR>
Ah me, my son! my first and best,<BR>
On pleasant conches wont to rest,<BR>
With limbs perfumed with sandal, fanned<BR>
By many a beauty's tender hand:<BR>
Where will he lie with log or stone<BR>
Beneath him for a pillow thrown,<BR>
To leave at morn his earthy bed,<BR>
Neglected, and with dust o'erspread,<BR>
As from the flood with sigh and pant<BR>
Comes forth the husband elephant?<BR>
The men who make the woods their home<BR>
Shall see the long-armed hero roam<BR>
Roused from his bed, though lord of all,<BR>
In semblance of a friendless thrall.<BR>
Janak's dear child who ne'er has met<BR>

<P>
With aught save joy and comfort yet,<BR>
Will reach to-day the forest, worn<BR>
And wearied with the brakes of thorn.<BR>
Ah, gentle girl, of woods unskilled,<BR>
How will her heart with dread be filled<BR>
At the wild beasts' deep roaring there,<BR>
Whose voices lift the shuddering hair!<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;, glory in thy gain,<BR>
And, widow queen, begin to reign:<BR>
No will, no power to live have I<BR>
When my brave son no more is nigh.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus pouring forth laments, the king,<BR>
Girt by the people's crowded ring,<BR>
Entered the noble bower like one<BR>
New-bathed when funeral rites are done.<BR>
Where'er he looked naught met his gaze<BR>
But empty houses, courts, and ways.<BR>
Closed were the temples: countless feet<BR>
No longer trod the royal street,<BR>
And thinking of his son he viewed<BR>
Men weak and worn and woe-subdued.<BR>
As sinks the sun into a cloud,<BR>
So passed he on, and wept aloud,<BR>
Within that house no more to be<BR>
The dwelling of the banished three,<BR>
Brave R&aacute;ma, his Videhan bride,<BR>
And Lakshman by his brother's side:<BR>
Like broad still waters, when the king<BR>
Of all the birds that ply the wing<BR>
Has swooped from heaven and borne away<BR>
The glittering snakes that made them gay.<BR>
With choking sobs and voice half spent<BR>
The king renewed his sad lament:<BR>
With broken utterance faint and low<BR>
Scarce could he speak these words of woe:<BR>
'My steps to R&aacute;ma's mother guide,<BR>
And place me by Kaus'aly&aacute;'s side:<BR>
There, only there my heart may know<BR>
Some little respite from my woe.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The warders of the palace led<BR>
The monarch, when his words were said,<BR>
To Queen Kaus'aly&aacute;'s bower, and there<BR>
Laid him with reverential care.<BR>
But while he rested on the bed<BR>
Still was his soul disquieted.<BR>
In grief he tossed his arms on high<BR>
Lamenting with a piteous cry:<BR>
'O R&aacute;ma, R&aacute;ma,' thus said he,<BR>
'My son, thou hast forsaken me.<BR>
High bliss awaits those favoured men<BR>
Left living in Ayodhy&aacute; then,<BR>
Whose eyes shall see my son once more<BR>
Returning when the time is o'er.'<BR>
Then came the night, whose hated gloom<BR>
Fell on him like the night of doom.<BR>
At midnight Das'aratha cried<BR>
To Queen Kaus'aly&aacute; by his side:<BR>
I see thee not, Kaus'aly&aacute;; lay<BR>
Thy gentle hand in mine, I pray.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma left his home my sight<BR>
Went with him, nor returns to-night.'<BR>
