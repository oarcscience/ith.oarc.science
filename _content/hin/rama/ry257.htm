<P>
When R&aacute;ma saw his brother stand<BR>
With none beside him, all unmanned,<BR>
Eager he questioned why he came<BR>
So far without the Ma&iacute;thil dame:<BR>
'Where is my wife, my darling, she<BR>
Who to the wild wood followed me?<BR>
Where hast thou left my lady, where<BR>
The dame who chose my lot to share?<BR>
Where is my love who balms my woe<BR>
As through the forest wilds I go,<BR>
Unkinged and banished and disgraced,--<BR>
My darling of the dainty waist?<BR>
She nerves my spirit for the strife,<BR>
She, only she gives zest to life,<BR>
Dear as my breath is she who vies<BR>
In charms with daughters of the skies.<BR>
If Janak's child be mine no more,<BR>
In splendour fair as virgin ore,<BR>
The lordship of the skies and earth<BR>
To me were prize of little worth.<BR>
Ah, lives she yet, the Ma&iacute;thil dame,<BR>
Dear as the soul within this frame?<BR>
O, let not all my toil be vain,<BR>
The banishment, the woe and pain!<BR>
O, let not dark Kaikey&iacute; win<BR>
The guerdon of her teacherous sin,<BR>
If, S&iacute;t&aacute; lost, my days I end,<BR>
And thou without me homeward wend!<BR>
O, let not good Kaus'aly&aacute; shed<BR>
Her bitter tears to mourn me dead,<BR>
Nor her proud rival's hest obey,<BR>
Strong in her son and queenly sway!<BR>
Back to my cot will I repair<BR>
If S&iacute;t&aacute; live to greet me there,<BR>

<P>
But if my wife have perished, I<BR>
Reft of ray love will surely die,<BR>
O Lakshman, if I seek my cot,<BR>
Look for my love and find her not<BR>
Sweet welcome with her smile to give,<BR>
I tell thee, I will cease to live.<BR>
O answer,--let thy words be plain,--<BR>
Lives Sita yet, or is she slain?'<BR>
Didst thou thy sacred trust betray<BR>
Till ravening giants seized the prey?<BR>
Ah me, so young, so soft and fair,<BR>
Lapped in all bliss, untried by care,<BR>
Rent from her own dear husband, how<BR>
Will she support her misery now?<BR>
That voice, O Lakshman smote thine ear,<BR>
And filled, I ween, thy heart with fear,<BR>
When on thy name for succour cried<BR>
The treacherous giant ere he died.<BR>
That voice too like mine own, I ween,<BR>
Was heard by the Videhan queen.<BR>
She bade thee seek my side to aid,<BR>
And quickly was the hest obeyed,<BR>
But ah, thy fault I needs must blame,<BR>
To leave alone the helpless dame,<BR>
And let the cruel giants sate<BR>
The fury of their murderous hate.<BR>
Those blood-devouring demons all<BR>
Grieve in their souls for Khara's fall,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute;, none to guard her side.<BR>
Torn by their cruel hands has died.<BR>
I sink, O tamer of thy foes,<BR>
Deep in the sea of whelming woes.<BR>
What can I now? I must endure<BR>
The mighty grief that mocks at cure.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus, all his thoughts on S&iacute;ta bent,<BR>
To Janasth&aacute;n the chieftain went,<BR>
Hastening on with eager stride,<BR>
And Lakshman hurried by his side.<BR>
With toil and thirst and hunger worn,<BR>
His breast with doubt and anguish torn,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He sought the well-known spot.<BR>
Again, again he turned to chide<BR>
With quivering lips which terror dried:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He looked, and found her not.<BR>
Within his leafy home he sped,<BR>
Each pleasant spot he visited<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where oft his darling strayed.<BR>
'Tis as I feared', he cried, and there,<BR>
Yielding to pangs too great to bear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He sank by grief dismayed.<BR>
