<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CXIII.: MANDODAR&Iacute;'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
While thus they wept, supreme in place,<BR>
The loveliest for form and face.<BR>
Mandodar&iacute; drew near alone,<BR>
Looked on her lord and made her moan:<BR>
'Ah Monarch, Indra feared to stand<BR>
In fight before thy conquering hand.<BR>
From thy dread spear the Immortals ran;<BR>
And art thou murdered by a man?<BR>
Ah,'twas no child of earth, I know,<BR>
That smote thee with that mortal blow.<BR>
'Twas Death himself in R&aacute;ma's shape,<BR>
That slew thee: Death whom none escape.<BR>
Or was it he who rules the skies<BR>
Who met thee, clothed in man's disguise?<BR>
Ah no, my lord, not Indra: he<BR>
In battle ne'er could look on thee.<BR>
One only God thy match I deem:<BR>
It was Vishnu's self, the Lord Supreme,<BR>
Whose days through ceaseless time extend<BR>
And ne'er began and ne'er shall end:<BR>
He with the discus, shell, and mace.<BR>
Brought ruin on the giant race.<BR>
Girt by the Gods of heaven arrayed<BR>
Like V&aacute;nar hosts his strength to aid,<BR>
He R&aacute;ma's shape and arms assumed<BR>

<P>
And slew the king whom Fate had doomed,<BR>
In Janasth&aacute;n when Khara died<BR>
With giant legions by his side,<BR>
No mortal was the unconquered foe<BR>
In R&aacute;ma's form who struck the blow.<BR>
When Hanum&aacute;n the Van&aacute;r came<BR>
And burnt thy town with hostile flame,<BR>
I counselled peace in anxious fear:<BR>
I counselled, but thou wouldst not hear.<BR>
Thy fancy for the foreign dame<BR>
Has brought thee death and endless shame.<BR>
Why should thy foolish fancy roam?<BR>
Hadst thou not wives as fair at home?<BR>
In beauty, form and grace could she,<BR>
Dear lord, surpass or rival me?<BR>
Now will the days of S&iacute;t&aacute; glide<BR>
In tranquil joy by R&aacute;ma's side:<BR>
And I--ah me, around me raves<BR>
A sea of woe with whelming waves.<BR>
With thee in days of old I trod<BR>
Each spot beloved by nymph and God;<BR>
I stood with thee in proud delight<BR>
On Mandar's side and Meru's height;<BR>
With thee, my lord, enchanted strayed<BR>
In Chaitraratha's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1036"></A><A HREF="#fn_1036"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> lovely shade,<BR>
And viewed each fairest scene afar<BR>
Transported in thy radiant car.<BR>
But source of every joy wast thou,<BR>
And all my bliss is ended now.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma to V&iacute;bh&iacute;shan cried:<BR>
'Whate'er the ritual bids, provide.<BR>
Obsequial honours duly pay,<BR>
And these sad mourners grief allay.'<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan answered, wise and true.<BR>
For duty's changeless law he knew:<BR>
'Nay one who scorned all sacred vows<BR>
And dared to touch another's spouse,<BR>
Fell tyrant of the human race,<BR>
With funeral rites I may not grace.'<BR>

<P>
Him Raghu's royal son, the best<BR>
Of those who love the law, addressed:<BR>
'False was the rover of the night,<BR>
He loved the wrong and scorned the right.<BR>
Yet for the fallen warrior plead<BR>
The dauntless heart, the valorous deed.<BR>
Let him who ne'er had brooked defeat,<BR>
The chief whom Indra feared to meet,<BR>
The ever-conquering lord, obtain<BR>
The honours that should grace the slain.'<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan bade his friends prepare<BR>
The funeral rites with thoughtful care.<BR>
Himself the royal palace sought<BR>
Whence sacred fire was quickly brought,<BR>
With sandal wood and precious scents<BR>
And pearl and coral ornaments.<BR>
Wise Br&aacute;hmans, while the tears that flowed<BR>
Down their wan cheeks their sorrow sowed,<BR>

<P>

<P>
Upon a golden litter laid<BR>
The corpse in finest ropes arrayed.<BR>
Thereon were flowers and pennons hung,<BR>
And loud the monarch's praise was sung.<BR>
Then was the golden litter raised,<BR>
While holy fire in order blazed.<BR>
And first in place Vibh&iacute;shan led<BR>
The slow procession of the dead,<BR>
Behind, their cheeks with tears bedewed,<BR>
Came sad the widowed multitude.<BR>
Where, raised as Br&aacute;hmans ordered, stood<BR>
Piled sandal logs, and scented wood,<BR>
The body of the king was set<BR>
High on a deerskin coverlet.<BR>
Then duly to the monarch's shade<BR>
The offerings for the dead they paid,<BR>
And southward on the eastern side<BR>
An altar formed and fire supplied.<BR>
Then on the shoulder of the dead<BR>
The oil and clotted milk were shed.<BR>
All rites were done as rules ordain:<BR>
The sacrificial goat was slain.<BR>
Next on the corpse were perfumes thrown<BR>
And many a flowery wreath was strown;<BR>
And with Vibh&iacute;shan's ready aid<BR>
Rich vesture o'er the king was laid.<BR>
Then while the tears their cheeks bedewed<BR>
Parched grain upon the dead they strewed;<BR>
Last, to the wood, as rules require,<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan set the kindling fire.<BR>

<P>
Then having bathed, as texts ordain,<BR>
To Lank&aacute; went the mourning train.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan, when his task was done,<BR>
Stood by the side of Raghu's son.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, freed from every foe,<BR>
Unstrung at last his deadly bow,<BR>
And laid the glittering shafts aside.<BR>
And mail by Indra's love supplied.<BR>
