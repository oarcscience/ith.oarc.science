<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CXII.: THE R&Aacute;KSHAS DAMES.</H3>
<P>
High rose the universal wail<BR>
That mourned the monarch's death, and, pale<BR>
With crushing woe, her hair unbound,<BR>
Her eyes in floods of sorrow drowned,<BR>
Forth from the inner chambers came<BR>
With trembling feet each royal dame,<BR>
Heedless of those who bade them stay<BR>
They reached the field where R&aacute;van lay;<BR>

<P>
There falling by their husband's side,<BR>
'Ah, King! ah dearest lord!' they cried.<BR>
Like creepers shattered by the storm<BR>
They threw them on his mangled form.<BR>
One to his bleeding bosom crept<BR>
And lifted up her voice and wept.<BR>
About his feet one mourner clung.<BR>
Around his neck another hung.<BR>
One on the giant's severed head.<BR>
Her pearly tears in torrents shed<BR>
Fast as the drops the summer shower<BR>
Pours down upon the lotus flower.<BR>
'Ah, he whose arm in anger reared<BR>
The King of Gods and Yama feared.<BR>
While panic struck their heavenly train,<BR>
Lies prostrate in the battle slain.<BR>
Thy haughty heart thou wouldst not bend,<BR>
Nor listen to each wiser friend.<BR>
Ah, had the dame, as they implored,<BR>
Been yielded to her injured lord,<BR>
We had not mourned this day thy fall,<BR>
And happy had it been for all.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma and thy friends content<BR>
In blissful peace their days had spent.<BR>
Thine injured brother had not fled.<BR>
Nor giant chiefs and V&aacute;nars bled.<BR>
Yet for these woes we will not blame.<BR>
Thy fancy for the Maithil dame,<BR>
Fate, ruthless Fate, vhom none may bend<BR>
Has urged thee to thy hapless end.'<BR>
