<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LI.: VIS'V&Aacute;MITRA.</H3>
<P>
Wise Vis'v&aacute;mitra's tale was done:<BR>
Then sainted Gautam's eldest son,<BR>
Great S'at&aacute;nanda, far-renowned,<BR>
Whom long austerities had crowned<BR>
With glory--as the news he heard<BR>
The down upon his bodv stirred,--<BR>
Filled full of wonder at the sight<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma, felt supreme delight.<BR>
When S'at&aacute;nanda saw the pair<BR>
Of youthful princes seated there,<BR>
He turned him to the holy man<BR>
Who sate at ease, and thus began:<BR>
'And didst thou, mighty Sage, in truth<BR>
Show clearly to this royal youth<BR>
My mother, glorious far and wide,<BR>
Whom penance-rites have sanctified?<BR>
And did my glorious mother--she,<BR>
Heiress of noble destiny--<BR>
Serve her great guest with woodland store,<BR>
Whom all should honour evermore?<BR>
Didst thou the tale to R&aacute;ma tell<BR>
Of what in ancient days befell,<BR>
The sin, the misery, and the shame<BR>
Of guilty God and faithless dame?<BR>
And, O thou best of hermits, say,<BR>
Did R&aacute;ma's healing presence stay<BR>
Her trial? was the wife restored<BR>
Again to him, my sire and lord?<BR>
Say, Hermit, did that sire of mine<BR>
Receive her with a soul benign,<BR>
When long austerities in time<BR>
Had cleansed her from the taint of crime?<BR>

<P>
And, son of Kus'ik, let me know,<BR>
Did my great-minded father show<BR>
Honour to R&aacute;ma, and regard,<BR>
Before he journeyed hitherward?'<BR>
The hermit with attentive ear<BR>
Marked all the questions ot the seer:<BR>
To him for eloquence far-famed,<BR>
His eloquent reply he framed:<BR>
'Yea, 'twas my care no task to shun,<BR>
And all I had to do was done;<BR>
As Renuk&aacute; and Bhrigu's child,<BR>
The saint and dame were reconciled.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When the great sage had thus replied,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma S'at&aacute;nanda cried:<BR>
'A welcome visit, Prince, is thine,<BR>
Thou scion of King Raghu's line.<BR>
With him to guide thy way aright,<BR>
This sage invincible in might,<BR>
This Br&aacute;hman sage, most glorious-bright,<BR>
By long austerities has wrought<BR>
A wondrous deed, exceeding thought:<BR>
Thou knowest well, O strong of arm,<BR>
This sure defence from scathe and harm.<BR>
None, R&aacute;ma, none is living now<BR>
In all the earth more blest than thou,<BR>
That thou hast won a saint so tried<BR>
In fervid rites thy life to guide.<BR>
Now listen, Prince, while I relate<BR>
His lofty deeds and wondrous fate.<BR>
He was a monarch pious-souled.<BR>
His foemen in the dust he rolled;<BR>
Most learned, prompt at duty's claim,<BR>
His people's good his joy and aim.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of old the Lord of Life gave birth<BR>
To mighty Kus'a, king of earth.<BR>
His son was Kus'an&aacute;bha, strong,<BR>
Friend of the right, the foe of wrong.<BR>
G&aacute;dhi, whose fame no time shall dim,<BR>
Heir of his throne was born to him,<BR>
And Vis'v&aacute;mitra, G&aacute;dhi's heir,<BR>
Governed the land with kingly care.<BR>
While years unnumbered rolled away<BR>
The monarch reigned with equal sway.<BR>
At length, assembling many a band,<BR>
He led his warriors round the land--<BR>
Complete in tale, a mighty force,<BR>
Cars, elephants, and foot, and horse.<BR>
Through cities, groves, and floods he passed,<BR>
O'er lofty hills, through regions vast.<BR>
He reached Vas'ishtha's pure abode,<BR>
Where trees, and flowers, and creepers glowed,<BR>
Where troops of sylvan creatures fed;<BR>
Which saints and angels visited.<BR>
Gods, fauns, and bards of heavenly race,<BR>
And spirits, glorified the place;<BR>
The deer their timid ways forgot,<BR>
And holy Br&aacute;hmans thronged the spot.<BR>
Bright in their souls, like fire, were these,<BR>
Made pure by long austerities,<BR>
Bound by the rule of vows severe,<BR>
And each in glory Brahm&aacute;'s peer.<BR>
Some fed on water, some on air,<BR>
Some on the leaves that withered there.<BR>
Roots and wild fruit were others' food;<BR>
All rage was checked, each sense subdued,<BR>
There B&aacute;lakhilyas &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="ry052.htm#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> went and came,<BR>
Now breathed the prayer, now fed the flame:<BR>
These, and ascetic bands beside,<BR>
The sweet retirement beautified.<BR>
Such was Vas'ishtha's blest retreat,<BR>
Like Brahm&aacute;'s own celestial seat,<BR>
Which gladdened Vis'vamitra's eyes,<BR>
Peerless for warlike enterprise.<BR>
