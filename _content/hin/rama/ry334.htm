<P>
They heard his counsel to the close,<BR>
Then swiftly to their feet they rose;<BR>
And Jambavan with joyous breast<BR>
The vulture king again addressed:<BR>
&nbsp; "Where, where is S&iacute;t&aacute;? who has seen,<BR>
Who borne away the Maithil queen?<BR>
Who would the lightning flight withstand<BR>
Of arrows shot by Lakshman's hand"<BR>
&nbsp; Again Samp&aacute;ti spoke to cheer<BR>
The V&aacute;nars as they bent to hear:<BR>
'Now listen, and my words shall show<BR>
What of the Maithil dame I know,<BR>
And in what distant prison lies<BR>
The lady of the long dark eyes.<BR>
Scorched by the fiery God of Day,<BR>
High on this mighty hill I lay.<BR>
A long and weary time had passed,<BR>
And strength and life were failing fast.<BR>
Yet, ere the breath had left my frame,<BR>
My son, my dear Sup&aacute;rs'va, came.<BR>
Each morn and eve he brought me food,<BR>
And filial care my life renewed.<BR>
But serpents still are swift to ire.<BR>
Gandbarvas slaves to soft desire.<BR>
And we, imperial vultures, need<BR>
A full supply our maws to feed.<BR>
Once he turned at close of day,<BR>
Stood by my side, but brought no prey.<BR>
He looked upon my ravenous eye,<BR>
Heard my complaint and made reply:<BR>

&nbsp; 'Borne on swift wings ere day was light<BR>
I stood upon Mahendra's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_775"></A><A HREF="ry335.htm#fn_775"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> height,<BR>
And, far below, the sea I viewed<BR>
And birds in countless multitude.<BR>
Before mine eyes a giant flew<BR>
Whose monstrous form was dark of hue<BR>
And struggling in his grasp was borne<BR>
A lady radiant as the morn.<BR>
Swift to the south his course he bent,<BR>
And cleft the yielding element.<BR>
The holy spirits of the air<BR>
Came round me as I marvelled there,<BR>
And cried as their bright legions met:<BR>
'O say, is S&iacute;t&aacute; living yet?'<BR>
Thus cried the saints and told the name<BR>
Of him who held the struggling dame.<BR>
Then while mine eye with eager look<BR>
Pursued the path the robber took,<BR>
I marked the lady's streaming hair,<BR>
And heard her cry of wild despair.<BR>
I saw her silken vesture rent<BR>
And stripped of every ornament,<BR>
Thus, O my father, fled the time:<BR>
Forgive, I pray, the heedless crime.'<BR>
In vain the mournful tale I heard<BR>
My pitying heart to fury stirred.<BR>
What could a helpless bird of air,<BR>
Reft of his boasted pinions, dare?<BR>
Yet can I aid with all that will<BR>
And words can do, and friendly skill.'<BR>
