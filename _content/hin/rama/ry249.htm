<P>
R&aacute;van's red eyes in fury rolled:<BR>
Bright with his armlets' flashing gold,<BR>
In high disdain, by passion stirred<BR>
He rushed against the sovereign bird.<BR>
With clash and din and furious blows<BR>
Of murderous battle met the foes:<BR>
Thus urged by winds two clouds on high<BR>
Meet warring in the stormy sky.<BR>
Then fierce the dreadful combat raged<BR>
As fiend and bird in war engaged,<BR>
As if two winged mountains sped<BR>
To dire encounter overhead.<BR>
Keen pointed arrows think and fast,<BR>
In never ceasing fury cast,<BR>
Rained hurtling on the vulture king<BR>
And smote him on the breast and wing.<BR>
But still that noblest bird sustained<BR>
The cloud of shafts which R&aacute;van rained,<BR>
And with strong beak and talons' bent<BR>
The body of his foeman rent.<BR>
Then wild with rage the ten-necked king<BR>
Laid ten swift arrows on his string,-<BR>
Dread as the staff of Death were they,<BR>
So terrible and keen to slay,<BR>
Straight to his ear the string he drew,<BR>
Straight to the mark the arrows flew,<BR>
And pierced by every iron head<BR>
The vulture's mangled body bled.<BR>
One glance upon the car he bent<BR>
Where S&iacute;t&aacute; wept with shrill lament,<BR>
Then heedless of his wounds and pain<BR>
Rushed at the giant king again.<BR>
Then the brave vulture with the stroke<BR>
Of his resistless talons broke<BR>
The giant's shafts and bow whereon<BR>
The fairest pearls and jewels shone.<BR>
The monster paused by rage unmanned:<BR>
A second bow soon armed his hand.<BR>
Whence pointed arrows swift and true<BR>
In hundreds, yea in thousands, flew.<BR>
The monarch of the vultures, plied<BR>
With ceaseless darts on every side.<BR>
Showed like bird that turns to rest<BR>
Close covered by the branch-built nest.<BR>
He shook his pinions to repel<BR>
The storm of arrows as it fell;<BR>
Then with his talons snapped in two<BR>
The mighty bow which R&aacute;van drew,<BR>
Next with terrific wing he smote<BR>
So fiercely on the giant's coat,<BR>
The harness, glittering with the glow<BR>
Of fire, gave way beneath the blow.<BR>
With storm of murderous strokes he beat<BR>
The harnessed asses strong and fleet,-<BR>
Each with a goblin's monstrous face<BR>
And plates of gold his neck to grace.<BR>
Then on the car he turned his ire,-<BR>
The will-moved car that shone like fire,<BR>
And broke the glorious chariot, broke<BR>
The golden steps and pole and yoke.<BR>
The chouris and the silken shade<BR>
Like the full moon to view displayed,<BR>
Together with the guards who held<BR>
Those emblems, to the ground he felled.<BR>
The royal vulture hovered o'er<BR>
The driver's head, and pierced and tore<BR>
With his strong beak and dreaded claws<BR>
His mangled brow and cheek and jaws.<BR>
With broken car and sundered bow,<BR>
His charioteer and team laid low,<BR>
One arm about the lady wound,<BR>
Sprang the fierce giant to the ground.<BR>
Spectators of the combat, all<BR>
The spirits viewed the monster's fall:<BR>
Lauding the vulture every one<BR>
Cried with glad voice, Well done! well done!<BR>
But weak with length of days, at last<BR>
The vulture's strength was failing fast.<BR>
The fiend again assayed to bear<BR>
The lady through the fields of air.<BR>
But when the vulture saw him rise<BR>
Triumphant with his trembling prize,<BR>
Bearing the sword that still was left<BR>
When other arms were lost or cleft,<BR>
Once more, impatient of repose,<BR>
Swift from the earth her champion rose,<BR>
Hung in the way the fiend would take,<BR>
And thus addressing R&aacute;van spake:<BR>
'Thou, King of giants, rash and blind,<BR>
Wilt be the ruin of thy kind,<BR>
Stealing the wife of R&aacute;ma, him<BR>
With lightning sears on chest and limb.<BR>
A mighty host obeys his will<BR>
And troops of slaves his palace fill;<BR>

His lords of state are wise and true,<BR>
Kinsmen has he and retinue.<BR>
As thirsty travellers drain the cup,<BR>
Thou drinkest deadly poison up.<BR>
The rash and careless fool who heeds<BR>
No coming fruit of guilty deeds,<BR>
A few short years of life shall see,<BR>
And perish doomed to death like thee.<BR>
Say whither wilt thou fly to loose<BR>
Thy neck from Death's entangling noose.<BR>
Caught like the fish that finds too late<BR>
The hook beneath the treacherous bait?<BR>
Never, O King--of this be sure--<BR>
Will Raghu's fiery sons endure,<BR>
Terrific in their vengeful rage,<BR>
This insult to their hermitage.<BR>
Thy guilty hands this day have done<BR>
A deed which all reprove and shun,<BR>
Unworthly of a noble chief,<BR>
The pillage loved by coward thief.<BR>
Stay, if thy heart allow thee, stay<BR>
And meet me in the deadly fray.<BR>
Soon shall thou stain the earth with gore,<BR>
And fall as Khara fell before.<BR>
The fruits of former deeds o'erpower<BR>
The sinner in his dying hour:<BR>
And such a fate on thee, O King,<BR>
Thy tyranny and madness bring.<BR>
Not e'en the Self-existent Lord,<BR>
Who reigns by all the worlds adored,<BR>
Would dare attempt a guilty deed<BR>
Which the dire fruits of crime succeed.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus brave Jatayus, best of birds,<BR>
Addressed the fiend with moving words,<BR>
Then ready for the swift attack<BR>
Swooped down upon the giant's back.<BR>
Down to the bone the talons went<BR>
With many a wound the flesh was rent:<BR>
Such blows infuriate drivers deal<BR>
Their elephants with pointed steel.<BR>
Fixed in his back the strong beak lay,<BR>
The talons stripped the flesh away.<BR>
He fought with claws and beak and wing.<BR>
And tore the long hair of the king.<BR>
Still as the royal vulture beat<BR>
The giant with his wings and feet,<BR>
Swelled the fiend's lips, his body shook<BR>
With furious rage too great to brook.<BR>
About the Maithil dame he cast<BR>
One huge left aim and held her fast.<BR>
In furious rage to frenzy fanned<BR>
He struck the vulture with his hand.<BR>
Jat&aacute;yus mocked the vain assay,<BR>
And rent his ten left arms away.<BR>
Down dropped the severed limbs: anew<BR>
Ten others from his body grew:<BR>
Thus bright with pearly radiance glide<BR>
Dread serpents from the hillock side,<BR>
Again in wrath the giant pressed<BR>
The lady closer to his breast,<BR>
And foot and fist sent blow on blow<BR>
In ceaseless fury at the foe.<BR>
So fierce and dire the battle, waged<BR>
Between those mighty champions, raged;<BR>
Here was the lord of giants, there<BR>
The noblest of the birds of air.<BR>
Thus, as his love of R&aacute;ma taught,<BR>
The faithful vulture strove and fought.<BR>
But R&aacute;van seized his sword and smote<BR>
His wings and side and feet and throat.<BR>
At mangled side and wing he bled;<BR>
He fell, and life was almost fled.<BR>
The lady saw her champion lie,<BR>
His plumes distained with gory dye,<BR>
And hastened to the vulture's side<BR>
Grieving as though a kinsman died.<BR>
The lord of Lank&aacute;'s island viewed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The vulture as he lay:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Whose back like some dark cloud was hued,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His breast a paly grey,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like ashes, when by none renewed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The flame has died away.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The lady saw with mournful eye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Her champion press the plain,--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The royal bird, her true ally<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Whom R&aacute;van's might had slain.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her soft arms locked in strict embrace<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Around his neck she kept.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And lovely with her moon-bright face<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Bent o'er her friend and wept,<BR>
