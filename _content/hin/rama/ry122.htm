<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLIV.: SUMITRA'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Kaus&acute;aly&aacute; ceased her sad lament,<BR>
Of beauteous dames most excellent.<BR>
Sumitr&aacute; who to duty clave,<BR>
In righteous words this answer gave:<BR>
'Dear Queen, all noble virtues grace<BR>
Thy son, of men the first in place.<BR>
Why dost thou shed these tears of woe<BR>
With bitter grief lamenting so?<BR>
If R&aacute;ma, leaving royal sway<BR>
Has hastened to the woods away,<BR>
'Tis for his high-souled father's sake<BR>
That he his promise may not break.<BR>
He to the path of duty clings<BR>
Which lordly fruit hereafter brings--<BR>
The path to which the righteous cleave--<BR>
For him, dear Queen, thou shouldst not grieve.<BR>
And Lakshman too. the blameless-souled,<BR>
The same high course with him will hold,<BR>
And mighty bliss on him shall wait,<BR>
So tenderly compassionate.<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute;, bred with tender care,<BR>
Well knows what toils await her there,<BR>
But in her love she will not part<BR>
From R&aacute;ma of the virtuous heart.<BR>
Now has thy son through all the world<BR>
The banner of his fame unfurled:<BR>
True, modest, careful of his vow,<BR>
What has he left to aim at now?<BR>
The sun will mark his mighty soul,<BR>
His wisdom, sweetness, self-control,<BR>
Will spare from pain his face and limb,<BR>
And with soft radiance shine for him.<BR>
For him through forest glades shall spring<BR>
A soft auspicious breeze, and bring<BR>
Its tempered heat and cold to play<BR>
Around him ever night and day.<BR>
The pure cold moonbeams shall delight<BR>
The hero as he sleeps at night,<BR>
And soothe him with the soft caress<BR>
Of a fond parent's tenderness.<BR>
To him, the bravest of the brave,<BR>
His heavenly arms the Br&aacute;hman gave,<BR>
When fierce Suv&aacute;hu dyed the plain<BR>
With his life-blood by R&aacute;ma slain.<BR>
Still trusting to his own right arm<BR>
Thy hero son will fear no harm:<BR>
As in his father's palace, he<BR>
In the wild woods will dauntless be.<BR>
Whene'er he lets his arrows fly<BR>
His stricken foemen fall and die:<BR>
And is that prince of peerless worth<BR>
Too weak to keep and sway the earth?<BR>
His sweet pure soul, his beauty's charm,<BR>
His hero heart, his warlike arm,<BR>
Will soon redeem his rightful reign<BR>
When from the woods he comes again.<BR>
The Br&aacute;hmans on the prince's head<BR>
King-making drops shall quickly shed,<BR>
And Sit&aacute;, Earth, and Fortune share<BR>
The glories which await the heir.<BR>
For him, when forth his chariot swept,<BR>
The crowd that thronged Ayodhy&aacute; wept,<BR>
With agonizing woe distressed.<BR>
With him in herm&iacute;t's mantle dressed<BR>
In guise of S&iacute;t&aacute; Lakshm&iacute; went,<BR>
And none his glory may prevent.<BR>
Yea, naught to him is high or hard,<BR>
Before whose steps, to be his guard,<BR>
Lakshman, the best who draws the bow,<BR>
With spear, shaft, sword rejoiced to go.<BR>
His wanderings in the forest o'er,<BR>
Thine eyes shall see thy son once more.<BR>
Quit thy faint heart, thy grief dispel,<BR>
For this, O Queen, is truth I tell.<BR>
Thy son returning, moonlike, thence,<BR>
Shall at thy feet do reverence,<BR>
And, blest and blameless lady, thou<BR>
Shalt see his head to touch them bow,<BR>
Yea, thou shalt see thy son made king<BR>
When he returns with triumphing,<BR>
And how thy happy eyes will brim<BR>
With tears of joy to look on him!<BR>
Thou, blameless lady, shouldst the whole<BR>
Of the sad people here console:<BR>
Why in thy tender heart allow<BR>
This bitter grief to harbour now?<BR>
As the long banks of cloud distil<BR>
Their water when they see the hill,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_147"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
So shall the drops of rapture run<BR>
From thy glad eyes to see thy son<BR>
Returning, as he lowly bends<BR>
To greet thee, girt by all his friends.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus soothing, kindly eloquent,<BR>
With every hopeful argument<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;'s heart by sorrow rent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fair Queen Sumitr&aacute; ceased.<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; heard each pleasant plea,<BR>
And grief began to leave her free,<BR>
As the light clouds of autumn flee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Their watery stores decreased.<BR>
