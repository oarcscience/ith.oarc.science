Then Jambum&aacute;li, pride and boast<BR>
For valour of the R&aacute;kshas host,<BR>
Prahasta's son supremely brave.<BR>
Obeyed the hest that R&aacute;van gave:<BR>
Fierce warrior with terrific teeth,<BR>
With saguine robes and brilliant wreath.<BR>
A bow like Indra's own &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_881"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A>, and store<BR>

Of glittering shafts the chieftain bore.<BR>
And ever as the string he **tried<BR>
The weapon with a roar replied,<BR>
Loud as the crashing thunder sent<BR>
By him who rules the firmament.<BR>
Soon as the foeman came in view<BR>
Borne on a car which asses drew.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chieftain mighty-voiced<BR>
Shouted in triumph and rejoiced.<BR>
Prahasta's son his bow-string drew,<BR>
And swift the winged arrows flew.<BR>
One in the face the V&aacute;nar smote,<BR>
Another quivered in his throat.<BR>
Ten from the deadly weapon sent<BR>
His brawny aims and shoulders rent.<BR>
Then as he felt each galling shot<BR>
The V&aacute;nar's rage waxed fiercely hot.<BR>
He looked, and saw a mass of stone<BR>
That lay before his feet o'erthrown.<BR>
The mighty block he raised and threw,<BR>
And crashing through the air it flew.<BR>
But Jambumah shunned the blow,<BR>
And rained fresh arrows from his bow.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar's limbs were red with gore:<BR>
A S&aacute;l tree from the earth he tore,<BR>
And, ere he hurled it undismayed,<BR>
Above his head the missile swayed.<BR>
But shafts from Jambumah's bow<BR>
Cut through it ere his hand could throw.<BR>
And thigh and arm and chest and side<BR>
With streams of rushing blood were dyed.<BR>
Still unsubdued though wounded oft<BR>
The shattered trunk he raised aloft,<BR>
And down with well-directed aim<BR>
On Jambumah's chest it came.<BR>
There crushed upon the trampled grass<BR>
He lay an undistinguished mass,<BR>
The foeman's eye no more could see<BR>
His head or chest or arm or knee.<BR>
And bow and car and steeds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="ry383.htm#fn_882"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and store<BR>
Of glittering; shafts were seen no more.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Jambumah's death he heard,<BR>
King R&aacute;van's heart with rage was stirred<BR>
And forth his general's sons he sent,<BR>
For power and might preeminent.<BR>
