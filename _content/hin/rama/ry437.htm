<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXVIII.: THE ASCENT OF SUVELA.</H3>
<P>
'Come let us scale,' the hero cried,<BR>
'This hill with various metals dyed.<BR>
This night upon the breezy crest<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, Lakshman, I, will rest,<BR>
With sage Vibh&iacute;shan, faithful friend,<BR>
His counsel and his lore to lend.<BR>
From these tall* peaks each eager eye<BR>
The foeman's city shall espy,<BR>
Who from the wood my darling stole<BR>
And brought long anguish on my soul.'<BR>

<P>

<P>
Thus spake the lord of men, and bent<BR>
His footsteps to the steep ascent,<BR>
And Lakshman, true in weal and woe,<BR>
Next followed with his shafts and bow.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan followed, next in place,<BR>
The sovereign of the V&aacute;nar race,<BR>
And hundreds of the forest kind<BR>
Thronged with impetuous feet, behind.<BR>
The chiefs in woods and mountains bred<BR>
Fast followed to Suvela's head,<BR>
And gazed on Lank&aacute; bright and fair<BR>
As some gay city in the air.<BR>
On glittering gates, on ramparts raised<BR>
By giant hands, the chieftains gazed.<BR>
They saw the mighty hosts that, skilled<BR>
In arts of war, the city filled,<BR>
And ramparts with new ramparts lined,<BR>
The swarthy hosts that stood behind.<BR>
With spirits burning for the fight<BR>
They saw the giants from the height,<BR>
And from a hundred throats rang out<BR>
Defiance and the battle shout.<BR>
Then sank the sun with dying flame,<BR>
And soft the shades of twilight came,<BR>
And the full moon's delicious light<BR>
Was shed upon the tranquil night.<BR>
