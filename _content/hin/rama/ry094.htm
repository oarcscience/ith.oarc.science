<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XVI.: R&Aacute;MA SUMMONED.</H3>
<P>
So through the crowded inner door<BR>
Sumantra, skilled in ancient lore,<BR>
On to the private chambers pressed<BR>
Which stood apart from all the rest.<BR>
There youthful warriors, true and bold,<BR>
Whose ears were ringed with polished gold,<BR>
All armed with trusty bows and darts,<BR>
Watched with devoted eyes and hearts.<BR>
And hoary men, a faithful train,<BR>
Whose aged hands held staves of cane,<BR>
The ladies' guard, apparelled fair<BR>
In red attire, were stationed there.<BR>
Soon as they saw Sumantra nigh,<BR>
Each longed his lord to gratify,<BR>
And from his seat beside the door<BR>
Up sprang each ancient servitor.<BR>
Then to the warders quickly cried<BR>
The skilled Sumantra, void of pride:<BR>
'Tell R&aacute;ma that the charioteer<BR>
Sumantra waits for audience here.'<BR>
The ancient men with one accord<BR>
Seeking the pleasure of their lord,<BR>
Passing with speed the chamber door<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's ear the message bore.<BR>
Forthwith the prince with duteous heed<BR>
Called in the messenger with speed,<BR>
For 'twas his sire's command, he knew,<BR>
That sent him for the interview.<BR>
Like Lord Kuvera, well arrayed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He pressed a couch of gold,<BR>
Wherefrom a covering of brocade<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hung down in many a fold.<BR>
Oil and the sandal's fragrant dust<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Had tinged his body o'er<BR>
Dark as the stream the spearman's thrust<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Drains from the wounded boar.<BR>
Him S&iacute;t&aacute; watched with tender care,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A chouri in her hand,<BR>
As Chitr&aacute;, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> ever fond in fair,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Beside the Moon will stand.<BR>
Him glorious with unborrowed light,<BR>
A liberal lord, of sunlike might,<BR>
Sumantra hailed in words like these,<BR>
Well skilled in gentle courtesies,<BR>
As, with joined hands in reverence raised,<BR>
Upon the beauteous prince he gazed:<BR>
'Happy Kaus'aly&aacute;! Blest is she,<BR>
The Mother of a son like thee.<BR>
Now rise, O R&aacute;ma, speed away.<BR>
Go to thy sire without delay:<BR>
For he and Queen Kaikey&iacute; seek<BR>
An interview with thee to speak.'<BR>

<P>
The lion-lord of men, the best<BR>
Of splendid heroes, thus addressed,<BR>
To S&iacute;t&aacute; spake with joyful cheer:<BR>
'The king and qneen, my lady dear,<BR>
Touching the throning, for my sake<BR>
Some salutary counsel take.<BR>
The lady ot the full black eye<BR>
Would fain her husband gratify,<BR>
And, all his purpose understood,<BR>
Counsels the monarch to my good.<BR>
A happy fate is mine, I ween,<BR>
When he, consulting with his queen,<BR>
Sumantra on this charge, intent<BR>
Upon my gain and good, has sent.<BR>
An envoy of so noble sort<BR>
Well suits the splendour of the court.<BR>
The consecration rite this day<BR>
Will join me in imperial sway.<BR>
To meet the lord of earth, for so<BR>
His order bids me, I will go.<BR>
Thou, lady, here in comfort stay,<BR>
And with thy maidens rest or play.'<BR>

<P>
Thus R&aacute;ma spake. For meet reply<BR>
The lady of the large black eye<BR>
Attended to the door her lord,<BR>
And blessings on his head implored:<BR>
'The majesty and royal state<BR>
Which holy Br&aacute;hmans venerate,<BR>
The consecration and the rite<BR>
Which sanctifies the ruler's might,<BR>
And all imperial powers should be<BR>
Thine by thy father's high decree,<BR>
As He, the worlds who formed and planned,<BR>
The kingship gave to Indra's hand.<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Then shall mine eyes my king adore<BR>
When lustral rites and fast are o'er,<BR>
And black deer's skin and roebuck's horn<BR>
Thy lordly limbs and hand adorn.<BR>
May He whose hands the thunder wield<BR>
Be in the east thy guard and shield;<BR>
May Yama's care the south befriend,<BR>
And Varun's arm the west defend;<BR>
And let Kuvera, Lord of Gold,<BR>
The north with firm protection hold.'<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma spoke a kind farewell,<BR>
And hailed the blessings as they fell<BR>
From S&iacute;t&aacute;'s gentle lips; and then,<BR>
As a young lion from his den<BR>
Descends the mountain's stony side,<BR>
So from the hall the hero hied.<BR>
First Lakshman at the door he viewed<BR>
Who stood in reverent attitude,<BR>
Then to the central court he pressed<BR>
Where watched the friends who loved him best.<BR>
To all his dear companions there<BR>
He gave kind looks and greeting fair.<BR>
On to the lofty car that glowed<BR>
Like fire the royal tiger strode.<BR>
Bright as himself its silver shone:<BR>
A tiger's skin was laid thereon.<BR>
With cloudlike thunder, as it rolled,<BR>
It flashed with gems and burnished gold,<BR>
And, like the sun's meridian blaze,<BR>
Blinded the eye that none could gaze.<BR>
Like youthful elephants, tall and strong,<BR>
Fleet coursers whirled the car along:<BR>
In such a car the Thousand-eyed<BR>
Borne by swift horses loves to ride.<BR>
So like Parjanya, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> when he flies<BR>
Thundering through the autumn skies,<BR>
The hero from the palace sped,<BR>
As leaves the moon some cloud o'erhead.<BR>
Still close to R&aacute;ma Lakshman kept,<BR>
Behind him to the car he leapt,<BR>
And, watching with fraternal care,<BR>
Waved the long chouri's silver hair,<BR>
As from the palace gate he came<BR>
Up rose the tumult of acclaim.<BR>
While loud huzza and jubilant shout<BR>
Pealed from the gathered myriads out.<BR>
Then elephants, like mountains vast,<BR>
And steeds who all their kind surpassed,<BR>
Followed their lord by hundreds, nay<BR>
By thousands, led in long array.<BR>
First marched a band of warriors trained,<BR>
With sandal dust and aloe stained;<BR>
Well armed was each with sword and bow,<BR>
And every breast with hope aglow,<BR>
And ever, as they onward went,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Shouts from the warrior train,<BR>
And every sweet-toned instrument<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Prolonged the minstrel strain.<BR>


<P>


<P>
On passed the tamer of his foes,<BR>
While well clad dames, in crowded rows,<BR>
Each chamber lattice thronged to view,<BR>
And chaplets on the hero threw.<BR>
Then all, of peerless face and limb,<BR>
Sang R&aacute;ma's praise for love of him,<BR>
And blent their voices, soft and sweet.<BR>
From palace high and crowded street:<BR>
'Now, sure, Kaus'aly&aacute;'s heart must swell<BR>
To see the son she loves so well,<BR>
Thee R&aacute;ma, thee, her joy and pride,<BR>
Triumphant o'er the realm preside.'<BR>
Then--for they knew his bride most fair<BR>
Of all who part the soft dark hair,<BR>
His love, his life, possessed the whole<BR>
Of her young hero's heart and soul:--<BR>
'Be sure the lady's fate repays<BR>
Some mighty vow of ancient days, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="ry095.htm#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
For blest with R&aacute;ma's love is she<BR>
As, with the Moon's, sweet Rohin&iacute;.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="ry095.htm#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Such were the witching words that came<BR>
From lips of many a peerless dame<BR>
Crowding the palace roofs to greet<BR>
The hero as he gained the street.<BR>
