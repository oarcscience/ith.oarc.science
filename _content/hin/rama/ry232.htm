<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXIV.: S&Ucirc;RPANAKH&Aacute;'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Then forth the giant's fury broke<BR>
As S&uacute;rpanakh&aacute; harshly spoke.<BR>
Girt by his lords the demon king<BR>
Looked on her, fiercely questioning:<BR>

<P>
'Who is this R&aacute;ma, whence, and where?<BR>
His form, his might, his deeds declare.<BR>
His wandering steps what purpose led<BR>
To Dandak forest, hard to tread?<BR>
What arms are his that he could smite<BR>
In fray the rovers of the night<BR>
And Tris'iras and D&uacute;shan lay<BR>
Low on the earth, and Khara slay?<BR>
Tell all, my sister, and declare<BR>
Who maimed thee thus, of form most fair.'<BR>

<P>
Thus by the giant king addressed,<BR>
While burnt her fury unrepressed,<BR>
The giantess declared at length<BR>
The hero's form and deeds and strength:<BR>

<P>
'Long are his arms and large his eyes:<BR>
A black deer's skin his dress supplies.<BR>
King Das'aratha's son is he,<BR>
Fair as Kandarpa's self to see.<BR>
Adorned with many a golden band,<BR>
A bow, like Indra's, arms his hand,<BR>
And shoots a flood of arrows fierce<BR>
As venomed snakes to burn and pierce.<BR>
I looked, I looked, but never saw<BR>
His mighty hand the bowstring draw<BR>
That sent the deadly arrows out,<BR>
While rang through air his battle-shout.<BR>
I looked, I looked, and saw too well<BR>
How with that hail the giants fell,<BR>
As falls to earth the golden grain,<BR>
Struck by the blows of Indra's rain.<BR>
He fought, and twice seven thousand, all<BR>
Terrific giants, strong and tall,<BR>
Fell by the pointed shafts o'erthrown<BR>
Which R&aacute;ma shot on foot, alone.<BR>
Three little hours had scarcely fled,--<BR>
Khara and D&uacute;shan both were dead,<BR>
And he had freed the saints and made<BR>
Asylum sure in Dandak's shade.<BR>
Me of his grace the victor spared,<BR>
Or I the giants' fate had shared.<BR>
The high-souled R&aacute;ma would not deign<BR>
His hand with woman's blood to stain.<BR>
The glorious Lakshman, justly dear,<BR>
In gifts and warrior might his peer,<BR>
Serves his great brother with the whole<BR>
Devotion of his faithful soul:<BR>
Impetuous victor, bold and wise,<BR>
First in each hardy enterprise,<BR>
Still ready by his side to stand,<BR>
A second self or better hand.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma has a large-eyed spouse,<BR>
Pure as the moon her cheek and brows,<BR>
Dearer than life in R&aacute;ma's sight,<BR>
Whose happiness is her delight.<BR>
With beauteous hair and nose the dame<BR>
From head to foot has naught to blame.<BR>
She shines the wood's bright Goddess, Queen<BR>
Of beauty with her noble mien.<BR>
First in the ranks of women placed<BR>
Is S&iacute;t&aacute; of the dainty waist.<BR>
In all the earth mine eyes have ne'er<BR>
Seen female form so sweetly fair.<BR>
Goddess nor nymph can vie with her,<BR>
Nor bride of heavenly chorister.<BR>
He who might call this dame his own,<BR>
Her eager arms about him thrown,<BR>
Would live more blest in S&iacute;t&aacute;'s love<BR>
Than Indra in the world above.<BR>
She, peerless in her form and face<BR>
And rich in every gentle grace,<BR>
Is worthy bride, O King, for thee,<BR>
As thou art meet her lord to be.<BR>
I even I, will bring the bride<BR>
In triumph to her lover's side--<BR>
This beauty fairer than the rest,<BR>
With rounded limb and heaving breast.<BR>
Each wound upon my face I owe<BR>
To cruel Lakshman's savage blow.<BR>
But thou, O brother, shalt survey<BR>
Her moonlike loveliness to-day,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's piercing shafts shall smite<BR>
Thine amorous bosom at the sight.<BR>
If in thy breast the longing rise<BR>
To make thine own the beauteous prize.<BR>
Up, let thy better foot begin<BR>
The journey and the treasure win.<BR>
If, giant Lord, thy favouring eyes<BR>
Regard the plan which I advise.<BR>
Up, cast all fear and doubt away<BR>
And execute the words I say<BR>
Come, giant King, this treasure seek,<BR>
For thou art strong and they are weak.<BR>

<P>
Let S&iacute;t&aacute; of the faultless frame<BR>
Be borne away and be thy dame.<BR>
Thy host in Janasth&aacute;n who dwelt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Forth to the battle hied.<BR>
And by the shafts which R&aacute;ma dealt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They perished in their pride.<BR>
D&uacute;shan and Khara breathe no more,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Laid low upon the plain.<BR>
Arise, and ere the day be o'er<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Take vengeance for the slain.'<BR>
