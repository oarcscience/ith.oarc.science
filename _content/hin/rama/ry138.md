### CANTO LX.: KAUS'ALYÁ CONSOLED.

As Queen Kaus'alyá, trembling much,  
As blighted by a goblin's touch,  
Still lying prostrate, half awoke  
To consciousness,'twas thus she spoke:  
'Bear me away, Sumantra, far,  
Where Ráma, Sítá, Lakshman are.  
Bereft of them I have no power  
To linger on a single hour.  

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>  

Again, I pray, thy steps retrace,  
And me in Dandak forest place,  
For after them I needs must go,  
Or sink to Yama's realms below  
   His utterance choked by tears that rolled  
Down from their fountains uncontrolled,  
With suppliant hands the charioteer  
Thus spake, the lady's heart to cheer:  
'Dismiss thy grief, despair, and dread  
That fills thy soul, of sorrow bred,  
For pain and anguish thrown aside.  
Will Rama in the wood abide.  
And Lakshman, with unfailing care  
Will guard the feet of Rama there,  
Earning, with governed sense, the prize  
That waits on duty in the skies.  
And Sita in the wild as well  
As in her own dear home will dwell;  
To Rama all her heart she gives,  
And free from doubt and terror lives.  
No faintest sign of care or woe  
The features of the lady show:  
Rethinks Videha's pride was made  
For exile in the forest shade.  
E'en as of old she used to rove  
Delighted in the city's grove,  
Thus, even thus she joys to tread  
The woodlands uninhabited.  
Like a young child, her face as fair  
As the young moon, she wanders there.  
What though in lonely woods she stray  
Still Rama is her joy and stay:  
All his the heart no sorrow bends,  
Her very life on him depends.  
For, if her lord she might not see,  
Ayodhy'a like the wood would be.  
She bids him, as she roams, declare  
The names of towns and hamlets there,  
Marks various trees that meet her eye,  
And many a brook that hurries by,  
And Janak's daughter seems home  
When Rama or his brother spanks  
And gives the answer that she seeks.  
This, Lady, I remember well,  
Nor angry words have to tell:  
Reproaches at Kaikey'i shot,  
Such, queen, my mind remembers not.'  
The speech when Sita's wrath was high,  
Sumantra passed in silence by,  
That so his pleasant words might  
With sweet report Kaulay'a's ear.  
Her moonlike beauty suffers not  
Though winds be rude and suns be hot:  
The way, the danger, and the toil  
Her gentle lustre may not soil.  
Like the red liiy's leafy crown  
Or as the fair full moon looks down,  
So the Videhan lady's face  
Still shines with undimmished grace.  
What if the borrowed colours throw  

O'er her fine feet no row glow,  
Still with their natural tints they spread  
A lotus glory where they tread.  
In sportive grace she walks the ground  
And sweet her chiming anklets sound.  
No jewels clasp the faultless limb:  
She leaves them all for love of him.  
If in the woods her gentle eye  
A lion sees, or tiger nigh,  
Or elephant, she fears no ill  
For Rama's arm supports her still,  
No longer be their fate deplored,  
Nor thine, nor that of Kosal's lord,  
For conduct such as theirs shall buy  
Wide glory that can never die.  
For casting grief and care away,  
Delighting in the forest, they  
With joyful spirits, blithe and gay,  
Set forward on the ancient way  
   Where mighty saints have led:  
Their highest aim, their dearest care  
To keep their father's honour fair,  
Observing still the oath he sware,  
   They roam, on wild fruit fed.'  
Thus with persuasive art he tried  
To turn her from her grief aside,  
   By soothing fancies won.  
But still she gave her sorrow vent:  
'Ah Rama,' was her shrill lament,  
'My love, my son, my son!'
