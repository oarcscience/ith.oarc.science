<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXVII.: THE GATHERING OF THE ASHES.</H3>
<P>
The tenth day passed: the prince again<BR>
Was free from every legal stain.<BR>
Ha bade them on the twelfth the great<BR>
Remaining honour celebrate.<BR>
Much gold he gave, and gems, and food,<BR>
To all the Br&aacute;hman multitude,<BR>
And goats whose hair was white and fine,<BR>
And many a thousand head of kine:<BR>
Slaves, men and damsels, he bestowed,<BR>
And many a car and fair abode:<BR>
Such gifts he gave the Br&aacute;hman race<BR>
His father's obsequies to grace.<BR>
Then when the morning's earliest ray<BR>
Appeared upon the thirteenth day,<BR>
Again the hero wept and sighed<BR>
Distraught and sorrow-stupefied;<BR>
Drew, sobbing in his anguish, near,<BR>
The last remaining debt to clear,<BR>
And at the bottom of the pyre,<BR>
He thus bespake his royal sire:<BR>
'O father, hast thou left me so,<BR>
Deserted in my friendless woe,<BR>
When he to whom the charge was given<BR>
To keep me, to the wood is driven?<BR>
Her only son is forced away<BR>
Who was his helpless mother's stay:<BR>

<P>

<P>
Ah, whither, father, art thou fled;<BR>
Leaving the queen uncomforted?'<BR>

<P>
He looked upon the pile where lay<BR>
The bones half-burnt and ashes grey,<BR>
And uttering a piteous moan,<BR>
Gave way, by anguish overthrown.<BR>
Then as his tears began to well,<BR>
Prostrate to earth the hero fell;<BR>
So from its seat the staff they drag,<BR>
And cast to earth some glorious flag.<BR>
The ministers approached again<BR>
The prince whom rites had freed from stain:<BR>
So when Yay&aacute;ti fell, each seer,<BR>
In pity for his fate, drew near.<BR>
S'atrughna saw him lying low<BR>
O'erwhelmed beneath the crush of woe,<BR>
And as upon the king he thought,<BR>
He fell upon the earth distraught.<BR>
When to his loving memory came<BR>
Those noble gifts, that kingly frame,<BR>
He sorrowed, by his woe distressed,<BR>
As one by frenzied rage possessed:<BR>
'Ah me, this surging sea of woe<BR>
Has drowned us with its overflow:<BR>
The source is Manthar&aacute;, dire and dark,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; is the ravening shark:<BR>
And the great boons the monarch gave<BR>
Lend conquering might to every wave.<BR>
Ah, whither wilt thou go, and leave<BR>
Thy Bharat in his woe to grieve,<BR>
Whom ever 'twas thy greatest joy<BR>
To fondle as a tender boy?<BR>
Didst thou not give with thoughtful care<BR>
Our food, our drink, our robes to wear?<BR>
Whose love will now for us provide,<BR>
When thou, our king and sire, hast died?<BR>
At such a time bereft, forlorn,<BR>
Why is not earth in sunder torn,<BR>
Missing her monarch's firm control,<BR>
His love of right, his lofty soul?<BR>
Ah me, for R&aacute;ma roams afar,<BR>
My sire is where the Blessed are;<BR>
How can I live deserted? I<BR>
Will pass into the fire and die.<BR>
Abandoned thus, I will not brook<BR>
Upon Ayodhy&aacute;'s town to look,<BR>
Once guarded by Ikshv&aacute;ku's race:<BR>
The wood shall be my dwelling place.'<BR>

<P>
Then when the princes' mournful train<BR>
Heard the sad brothers thus complain,<BR>
And saw their misery, at the view<BR>
Their grief burst wilder out anew.<BR>
Faint with lamenting, sad and worn,<BR>
Each like a bull with broken horn,<BR>
The brothers in their wild despair<BR>
Lay rolling, mad with misery, there.<BR>
Then old Vas'ishtha good and true,<BR>
Their father's priest, all lore who knew,<BR>
Raised weeping Bharat on his feet,<BR>
And thus bespake with counsel meet:<BR>
'Twelve days, my lord, have past away<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Since flames consumed thy father's clay:<BR>
Delay no more: as rules ordain,<BR>
Gather what bones may yet remain.<BR>
Three constant pairs are ever found<BR>
To hem all mortal creatures round: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="ry156.htm#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Then mourn not thus, O Prince, for none<BR>
Their close companionship may shun.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sumantra bade S'atrughna rise,<BR>
And soothed his soul with counsel wise,<BR>
And skilled in truth, his hearer taught<BR>
How all things are and come to naught,<BR>
When rose each hero from the ground,<BR>
A lion lord of men, renowned,<BR>
He showed like Indra's flag,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="ry156.htm#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> whereon<BR>
Fierce rains have dashed and suns have shone.<BR>
They wiped their red and weeping eyes,<BR>
And gently made their sad replies:<BR>
Then, urged to haste, the royal pair<BR>
Performed the rites that claimed their care.<BR>
