<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXVII.: THE COATS OF BARK.</H3>
<P>
Thus spake the virtuous sage: and then<BR>
R&aacute;ma addressed the king of men.<BR>
In laws of meek behaviour bred,<BR>
Thus to his sire he meekly said:<BR>

<P>
'King, I renounce all earthly care,<BR>
And live in woods on woodland fare.<BR>
What, dead to joys, have I to do<BR>
With lordly train and retinue!<BR>
Who gives his elephant and yet<BR>
Upon the girths his heart will set?<BR>
How can a cord attract his eyes<BR>
Who gives away the nobler prize?<BR>
Best of the good, with me he led<BR>
No host, my King with banners spread.<BR>
All wealth, all lordship I resign:<BR>
The hermit's dress alone be mine.<BR>
Before I go, have here conveyed<BR>
A little basket and a spade.<BR>
With these alone I go, content,<BR>
For fourteen years of banishment.'<BR>

<P>
With her own hands Kaikey&iacute; took<BR>
The hermit coats of bark, and, 'Look,'<BR>
She cried with bold unblushing brow<BR>
Before the concourse, 'Dress thee now.'<BR>
That lion leader of the brave<BR>
Took from her hand the dress she gave,<BR>
Cast his fine raiment on the ground,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And round his waist the vesture bound.<BR>
Then quick the hero Lakshman too<BR>
His garment from his shoulders threw,<BR>
And, in the presence of his sire,<BR>
Indued the ascetic's rough attire.<BR>
But S&iacute;t&aacute;, in her silks arrayed,<BR>
Threw glances, trembling and afraid,<BR>
On the bark coat she had to wear,<BR>
Like a shy doe that eyes the snare.<BR>
Ashamed and weeping for distress<BR>
From the queen's hand she took the dress.<BR>
The fair one, by her husband's side<BR>
Who matched heaven's minstrel monarch, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_312"></A><A HREF="#fn_312"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> cried:<BR>
'How bind they on their woodland dress,<BR>
Those hermits of the wilderness?'<BR>

<P>
There stood the pride of Janak's race<BR>
Perplexed, with sad appealing face.<BR>
One coat the lady's fingers grasped,<BR>
One round her neck she feebly clasped,<BR>
But failed again, again, confused<BR>
By the wild garb she ne'er had used.<BR>
Then quickly hastening R&aacute;ma, pride<BR>
Of all who cherish virtue, tied<BR>
The rough bark mantle on her, o'er<BR>
The silken raiment that she wore.<BR>

<P>
Then the sad women when they saw<BR>
R&aacute;ma the choice bark round her draw,<BR>
Rained water from each tender eye,<BR>
And cried aloud with bitter cry:<BR>
'O, not on her, beloved, not<BR>
On S&iacute;t&aacute; falls thy mournful lot.<BR>
If, faithful to thy father's will,<BR>
Thou must go forth, leave S&iacute;t&aacute; still.<BR>
Let S&iacute;t&aacute; still remaining here<BR>
Our hearts with her loved presence cheer.<BR>
With Lakshman by thy side to aid<BR>
Seek thou, dear son, the lonely shade.<BR>
Unmeet, one good and fair as she<BR>
Should dwell in woods a devotee.<BR>
Let not our prayers be prayed in vain:<BR>
Let beauteous S&iacute;t&aacute; yet remain;<BR>
For by thy love of duty tied<BR>
Thou wilt not here thyself abide.'<BR>

<P>
Then the king's venerable guide<BR>
Vas'ishtha, when he saw each coat<BR>
Enclose the lady's waist and throat,<BR>
Her zeal with gentle words repressed,<BR>
And Queen Kaikey&iacute; thus addressed:<BR>
'O evil-hearted sinner, shame<BR>
Of royal Kekaya's race and name;<BR>
Who matchless in thy sin couldst cheat<BR>
Thy lord the king with vile deceit;<BR>
Lost to all sense of duty, know<BR>
S&iacute;t&aacute; to exile shall not go.<BR>
S&iacute;t&aacute; shall guard, as 'twere her own,<BR>
The precious trust of R&aacute;ma's throne.<BR>


<P>


<P>
Those joined by wedlock's sweet control<BR>
Have but one self and common soul.<BR>
Thus S&iacute;t&aacute; shall our empress be,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma's self and soul is she.<BR>
Or if she still to R&aacute;ma cleave<BR>
And for the woods the kingdom leave:<BR>
If naught her loving heart deter,<BR>
We and this town will follow her.<BR>
The warders of the queen shall take<BR>
Their wives and go for R&aacute;ma's sake,<BR>
The nation with its stores of grain,<BR>
The city's wealth shall swell his train.<BR>
Bharat, S'atrughna both will wear<BR>
Bark mantles, and his lodging share,<BR>
Still with their elder brother dwell<BR>
In the wild wood, and serve him well.<BR>
Rest here alone, and rule thy state<BR>
Unpeopled, barren, desolate;<BR>
Be empress of the land and trees,<BR>
Thou sinner whom our sorrows please.<BR>
The land which R&aacute;ma reigns not o'er<BR>
Shall bear the kingdom's name no more:<BR>
The woods which R&aacute;ma wanders through<BR>
Shall be our home and kingdom too.<BR>
Bharat, be sure, will never deign<BR>
O'er realms his father yields, to reign.<BR>
Nay, if the king's true son he be,<BR>
He will not, sonlike, dwell with thee.<BR>
Nay, shouldst thou from the earth arise,<BR>
And send thy message from the skies,<BR>
To his forefathers' custom true<BR>
No erring course would he pursue.<BR>
So hast thou, by thy grievous fault,<BR>
Offended him thou wouldst exalt.<BR>
In all the world none draws his breath<BR>
Who loves not R&aacute;ma, true to death.<BR>
This day, O Queen, shalt thou behold<BR>
Birds, deer, and beasts from lea and fold<BR>
Turn to the woods in R&aacute;ma's train.<BR>
And naught save longing trees remain.'<BR>
