<P>
He ceased: and when his lips were closed<BR>
Mahodar thus his rede opposed:<BR>
'Why wilt thou shame thy noble birth<BR>
And speak like one of little worth?<BR>
Why boast thee thus in youthful pride<BR>
Rejecting wisdom for thy guide?<BR>
How will thy single arm oppose<BR>
The victor of a thousand foes,<BR>
Who proved in Janasth&aacute;n his might<BR>
And slew the rovers of the night?<BR>
The remnant of those legions, they<BR>
Who saw his power that fatal day.<BR>
Now in this leaguered city dread<BR>
The mighty chief from whom they fled.<BR>
And wouldst thou meet the lord of men,<BR>
Beard the great lion in his den,<BR>
And, when thine eyes are open, break<BR>
The slumber of a deadly snake?<BR>
Who may an equal battle wage<BR>
With him, so awful in his rage.<BR>
Fierce as the God of Death whom none<BR>
May vanquish, Das'aratha's son?<BR>
But, R&aacute;van, shall the lady still<BR>
Refuse compliance with thy will?<BR>
No, listen, King, to this design<BR>
Which soon shall make the captive thine.<BR>
This day through Lanka's streets proclaim<BR>
That four of us &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_991"></A><A HREF="#fn_991"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of highest fame<BR>
With Kumbhakarna at our head<BR>
Will strike the son of Raghu dead.<BR>
Forth to the battle will we go<BR>
And prove our prowess on the foe.<BR>
Then, if our bold attempt succeed,<BR>
No further plans thy hopes will need.<BR>
But if in vain our warriors strive,<BR>
And Raghu's son be left alive,<BR>
We will return, and, wounded sore,<BR>
Our armour stained with gouts of gore,<BR>
Will show the shafts that rent each frame,<BR>
Keen arrows marked with R&aacute;ma's name,<BR>
And say we giants have devoured<BR>
The princes whom our might o'erpowered.<BR>
Then let the joyful tidings spread<BR>
That Raghu's royal sons are dead.<BR>
To all around thy pleasure show,<BR>
Gold, pearls, and precious robes, bestow.<BR>
Gay garlands round the portals twine,<BR>
Enjoy the banquet and the wine.<BR>
Then go, the scornful lady seek,<BR>
And woo her when her heart is weak.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Rich robes and gold and gems display,<BR>
And gently wile her grief away.<BR>
Then will she feel her hopeless state,<BR>
Widowed, forlorn, and desolate;<BR>
Know that on thee her bliss depends,<BR>
Far from her country and her friends;<BR>
Then, her proud spirit overthrown,<BR>
The lady will be all thine own.'<BR>
