<P>
With amorous look and soft address<BR>
The fiend began his suit to press:<BR>
'Why wouldst thou, lady lotus-eyed,<BR>
From my fond glance those beauties hide?<BR>
Mine eager suit no more repel:<BR>
But love me, for I love thee well.<BR>
Dismiss, sweet dame, dismiss thy fear;<BR>
No giant and no man is near.<BR>
Ours is the right by force to seize<BR>
What dames soe'er our fancy please. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_833"></A><A HREF="#fn_833"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
But I with rude hands will not touch<BR>
A lady whom I love so much.<BR>
Fear not, dear queen: no fear is nigh:<BR>
Come, on thy lover's love rely.<BR>
Some little sign of favor show,<BR>
Nor lie enamoured of thy woe.<BR>
Those limbs upon that cold earth laid.<BR>
Those tresses twined in single braid, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_834"></A><A HREF="#fn_834"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
The fast and woe that wear thy frame,<BR>
Beseem not thee, O beauteous dame.<BR>
For thee the fairest wreaths were meant,<BR>
The sandal and the aloe's scent,<BR>
Rich ornaments and pearls of price,<BR>
And vesture meet for Paradise.<BR>
With dainty cates shouldst thou be fed,<BR>
And rest upon a sumptuous bed.<BR>
And festive joys to thee belong,<BR>
The music, and the dance and song.<BR>
Rise, pearl of women, rise and deck<BR>
With gems and chains thine arms and neck.<BR>
Shall not the dame I love be seen<BR>
In venture worthy of a queen?<BR>
Methinks when thy sweet form was made<BR>
His hand the wise Creator stayed;<BR>
For never more did he design<BR>
A beauty meet to rival thine.<BR>
Come, let, us love while we yet may,<BR>
For youth will fly and charms decay.<BR>
Come cast thy *** fear aside<BR>
And to my lo*e, my chosen bride.<BR>
The gem*s and jewels that my hands<BR>
Has reft from every plundered land,--<BR>
To thee I give th*** this day<BR>
And at thy feet my kingdom lay.<BR>

<P>
The broad rich earth will I o'errun,<BR>
And leave no town unconquered, none;<BR>
Then of the whole an offering make<BR>
To Janak,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_835"></A><A HREF="ry363.htm#fn_835"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> dear, for thy sweet sake.<BR>
In all the world no power I see<BR>
Of God or man can strive with me.<BR>
Of old the Gods and Asurs set<BR>
In terrible array I met:<BR>
Their scattered hosts to earth I beat,<BR>
And trod their flags beneath my feet.<BR>
Come, taste of bliss and drink thy fill,<BR>
And rule the slave who serves thy will.<BR>
Think not of wretched R&aacute;ma: he<BR>
Is less than nothing now to thee.<BR>
Stript of his glory, poor, dethroned,<BR>
A wanderer by his friends disowned,<BR>
On the cold earth he lays his head,<BR>
Or is with toil and misery dead.<BR>
And if perchance he lingers yet.<BR>
His eyes on thee shall ne'er be set.<BR>
Could he, that mighty monarch, who<BR>
Was named Hiranyakas'ipu.<BR>
Could he who wore the garb of gold<BR>
Win Glory back from Indra's hold? &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_836"></A><A HREF="ry363.htm#fn_836"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
O lady of the lovely smile,<BR>
Whose eyes the sternest heart beguile,<BR>
In all thy radiant beauty dressed<BR>
My heart and soul thou ravishest.<BR>
What though thy robe is soiled and worn,<BR>
And no bright gems thy limbs adorn,<BR>
Thou unadorned art dearer far<BR>
Than all my loveliest consorts are.<BR>
My royal home is bright and fair;<BR>
A thousand beauties meet me there.<BR>
But come, my glorious love, and be<BR>
The queen of all those dames and me.'<BR>
