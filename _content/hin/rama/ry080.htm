<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO II.: THE PEOPLE'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Then to the full assembly bowed<BR>
The monarch, and addressed the crowd<BR>
With gracious speech, in accents loud<BR>
As heavenly drum or thunder-cloud:<BR>

<P>
'Needs not to you who know declare<BR>
How ever with paternal care<BR>
My fathers of Ikshv&aacute;ku's line<BR>
Have ruled the realm which now is mine.<BR>
I too have taught my feet to tread<BR>
The pathway of the mighty dead,<BR>
And with fond care that never slept<BR>
Have, as I could, my people kept.<BR>
So toiling still, and ne'er remiss<BR>
For all my people's weal and bliss,<BR>
Beneath the white umbrella's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> shade.<BR>
Old age is come and strength decayed.<BR>
Thousands of years have o'er me flown,<BR>
And generations round me grown<BR>
And passed away. I crave at length<BR>
Repose and ease for broken strength.<BR>
Feeble and worn I scarce can bear<BR>
The ruler's toil, the judge's care,<BR>
With royal dignity, a weight<BR>
That tries the young and temperate.<BR>


<P>

<P>
I long to rest, my labour done,<BR>
And in my place to set my son,<BR>
If to the twice-born gathered here<BR>
My counsel wise and good appear.<BR>
For greater gifts than mine adorn<BR>
R&aacute;ma my son, my eldest-born.<BR>
Like Indra brave, before him fall<BR>
The foeman's cities, tower and wall.<BR>
Him prince of men for power and might,<BR>
The best maintainer of the right,<BR>
Fair as the moon when nothing bars<BR>
His glory close to Pushya's stars,<BR>
Him with to-morrow's light I fain<BR>
Would throne the consort of my reign,<BR>
A worthy lord for you, I ween,<BR>
Marked as her own by Fortune's Queen.<BR>
The triple world itself would be<BR>
Well ruled by such a king as he.<BR>
To such high bliss and happy fate<BR>
Will I the country dedicate,<BR>
And my sad heart will cease to grieve<BR>
If he the precious charge receive.<BR>
Thus is my careful plan matured,<BR>
Thus for myself is rest secured;<BR>
Lieges, approve the words I say,<BR>
Or point ye out some wiser way.<BR>
Devise your prudent plan. My mind<BR>
Is fondly to this thought inclined,<BR>
But men by keen debating move<BR>
Some middle course which all approve.'<BR>

<P>
The monarch ceased. In answer came<BR>
The joyous princes' glad acclaim.<BR>
So peacocks in the rain rejoice<BR>
And hail the cloud with lifted voice.<BR>
Murmurs of joy from thousands round<BR>
Shook the high palace with the sound.<BR>
Then when the gathered throng had learned<BR>
His will who right and gain discerned,<BR>
Peasant and townsman, priest and chief,<BR>
All met in consultation brief,<BR>
And soon agreed with one accord<BR>
Gave answer to their sovereign lord:<BR>
'King of the land, we know thee old:<BR>
Thousands of years have o'er thee rolled,<BR>
R&aacute;ma thy son, we pray, anoint.<BR>
And at thy side his place appoint<BR>
Our gallant prince, so brave and strong,<BR>
Riding in royal state along,<BR>
Our eyes with joyful pride will see<BR>
Screened by the shade that shelters thee.'<BR>
Then spake the king again, as though<BR>
Their hearts' true wish he sought to know:<BR>
'These prayers for R&aacute;ma's rule suggest<BR>
One question to my doubting breast.<BR>
This thing, I pray, with truth explain:<BR>
Why would ye, while I justly reign,<BR>
That he, mine eldest son, should bear<BR>
His part with me as ruling heir?'<BR>
Then all the people made reply,<BR>
Peasant and townsman, low and high:<BR>
' Each noblest gift of form and mind,<BR>

<P>

<P>
O Monarch, in thy son we find.<BR>
Do thou the godlike virtues hear<BR>
Which R&aacute;ma to our hearts endear.<BR>
So richly blest with graces, none<BR>
In all the earth excels thy son:<BR>
Nay, who to match with him may claim<BR>
In truth, in justice, and in fame?<BR>
True to his promise, gentle, kind,<BR>
Unenvious, of grateful mind,<BR>
Versed in the law and firm of soul,<BR>
He keeps each sense with strict control.<BR>
With duteous care he loves to sit<BR>
By Br&aacute;hmans skilled in Holy Writ.<BR>
Hence brightest glory, ne'er to end,<BR>
And matchless fame his youth attend.<BR>
Skilled in the use of spear and shield.<BR>
And arms which heavenly warriors wield,<BR>
Supreme in war, unconquered yet<BR>
Bv man, fiend, God in battle met,<BR>
Whene'er in pomp of war he goes<BR>
'Gainst town or city of the foes,<BR>
He ever comes with Lakshman back<BR>
Victorious from the fierce attack.<BR>
Returning homeward from afar<BR>
Borne on his elephant or car,<BR>
He ever to the townsmen bends<BR>
And greets them as beloved friends,<BR>
Asks how each son, each servant thrives,<BR>
How fare our pupils, offerings, wives;<BR>
And like a father bids us tell,<BR>
Each for himself, that all is well.<BR>
If pain or grief the city tries<BR>
His heart is swift to sympathize.<BR>
When festive scenes our thoughts employ<BR>
He like a father shares the joy.<BR>
High is the fate, O King, that gave<BR>
Thy R&aacute;ma born to bless and save,<BR>
With filial virtues fair and mild<BR>
Like Kas'yap old Mar&iacute;chi's child.<BR>
Hence to the kingdom's distant ends<BR>
One general prayer for him ascends.<BR>
Each man in town and country prays<BR>
For R&aacute;ma's strength, health, length of days.<BR>
With hearts sincere, their wish the same,<BR>
The tender girl, the aged dame,<BR>
Subject and stranger, peasant, hind,<BR>
One thought impressed on every mind,<BR>
At evening and at dawning day<BR>
To all the Gods for R&aacute;ma pray.<BR>
Do thou, O King, of grace comply,<BR>
And hear the people's longing cry,<BR>
And let us on the throne by thee<BR>
The lotus-tinted R&aacute;ma see.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  O thou who givest boons, attend;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A gracious ear, O Monarch, lend<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And for our weal install,<BR>
Consenting to our earnest prayer,<BR>
Thy godlike R&aacute;ma Regent Heir,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Who seeks the good of all.'<BR>

<P>
