<P>
King R&aacute;van, where he sat within,<BR>
Heard from his hall the deafening din,<BR>
And with a spirit ill at ease<BR>
Addressed his lords in words like these:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'That warlike shout, those joyous cries,<BR>
Loud as the thunder of the skies,<BR>
Upsent from every V&aacute;nar throat,<BR>
Some new-born confidence denote.<BR>
Hark, how the sea and trembling shore<BR>
Re-echo with the V&aacute;nars' roar.<BR>
Though arrowy chains, securely twined<BR>
Both R&aacute;ma and his brother bind,<BR>
Still must the fierce triumphant shout<BR>
Disturb my soul with rising doubt.<BR>
Swift envoys to the army send,<BR>
And learn what change these cries portend,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Obedient, at their master's call.<BR>
Fleet giants clomb the circling wall.<BR>
They saw the V&aacute;nars formed and led:<BR>
They saw Sugr&iacute;va at their head,<BR>
The brothers from their bonds released:<BR>
And hope grew faint and fear increased.<BR>
Their faces pale with doubt and dread,<BR>
Back to the giant king they sped,<BR>
And to his startled ear revealed<BR>
The tidings of the battle field.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The flush of rage a while gave place<BR>
To chilling fear that changed his face:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'What? cried the tyrant, 'are my foes<BR>
Freed from the binding snakes that close<BR>
With venomed clasp round head and limb,<BR>
Bright as the sun and fierce like him:<BR>
The spell a God bestowed of yore,<BR>
The spell that never failed before?<BR>
If arts like these be useless, how<BR>
Shall giant strength avail us now<BR>
Go forth, Dh&uacute;mr&aacute;ksha, good at need,<BR>
The bravest of my warriors lead:<BR>
Force through the foe thy conquering way,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma and the V&aacute;nars slay'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Before his king with reverence due<BR>
Dh&uacute;mr&aacute;ksha bowed him, and withdrew.<BR>
Around him at his summons came<BR>
Fierce legions led by chiefs of fame.<BR>
Well armed with sword and spear and mace,<BR>
They hurried to the gathering place,<BR>
And rushed to battle, borne at speed<BR>
By elephant and car and steed.<BR>
