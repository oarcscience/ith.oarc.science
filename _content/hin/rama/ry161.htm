<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXXIII.: THE JOURNEY BEGUN.</H3>
<P>
Then Bharat rose at early morn,<BR>
And in his noble chariot borne<BR>
Drove forward at a rapid pace<BR>
Eager to look on R&aacute;ma's face.<BR>
The priests and lords, a fair array,<BR>
In sun-bright chariots led the way.<BR>
Behind, a well appointed throng,<BR>
Nine thousand elephants streamed along.<BR>
Then sixty thousand cars, and then,<BR>
With various arms, came fighting men.<BR>
A hundred thousand archers showed<BR>

<P>
In lengthened line the steeds they rode--<BR>
A mighty host, the march to grace<BR>
Of Bharat, pride of Raghu's race.<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; and Sumitr&aacute; came,<BR>
And good Kaus'aly&aacute;, dear to fame:<BR>
By hopes of R&aacute;ma's coming cheered<BR>
They in a radiant car appeared.<BR>
On fared the noble host to see<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman, wild with glee,<BR>
And still each other's ear to please,<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma spoke in words like these:<BR>
'When shall our happv eyes behold<BR>
Our hero true, and pure, and bold,<BR>
So lustrous dark, so strong of arm,<BR>
Who keeps the world from woe and harm?<BR>
The tears that now our eyeballs dim<BR>
Will vanish at the sight of him,<BR>
As the whole world's black shadows fly<BR>
When the bright sun ascends the sky.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Conversing thus their way pursued<BR>
The city's joyous multitude,<BR>
And each in mutual rapture pressed<BR>
A friend or neighbour to his breast.<BR>
Thus every man of high renown,<BR>
And every merchant of the town,<BR>
And leading subjects, joyous went<BR>
Toward R&aacute;ma in his banishment.<BR>
And those who worked the potter's wheel,<BR>
And artists skilled in gems to deal;<BR>
And masters of the weaver's art,<BR>
And those who shaped the sword and dart;<BR>
And they who golden trinkets made,<BR>
And those who plied the fuller's trade;<BR>
And servants trained the bath to heat,<BR>
And they who dealt in incense sweet;<BR>
Physicians in their business skilled.<BR>
And those who wine and mead distilled;<BR>
And workmen deft in glass who wrought,<BR>
And those whose snares the peacock caught;<BR>
With them who bored the ear for rings,<BR>
Or sawed, or fashioned ivory things:<BR>
And those who knew to mix cement,<BR>
Or lived by sale of precious scent;<BR>
And men who washed, and men who sewed,<BR>
And thralls who mid the herds abode;<BR>
And fishers of the flood, and they<BR>
Who played and sang, and women gay;<BR>
And virtuous Br&aacute;hmans, Scripture-wise,<BR>
Of life approved in all men's eyes;<BR>
These swelled the prince's lengthened train,<BR>
Borne each in car or bullock wain.<BR>
Fair were the robes they wore upon<BR>
Their limbs where red-hued unguents shone.<BR>
These all in various modes conveyed<BR>
Their journey after Bharat made;<BR>
The soldiers' hearts with rapture glowed,<BR>
Following Bharat on his road,<BR>
Their chief whose tender love would fain<BR>
Bring his dear brother home again.<BR>
With elephant, and horse, and car,<BR>
The vast procession travelled far,<BR>

And came where Gang&aacute;'s waves below<BR>
The town of Sringavera &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="ry162.htm#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> flow.<BR>
There, with his friends and kinsmen nigh,<BR>
Dwelt Guha, R&aacute;ma's dear ally,<BR>
Heroic guardian of the land<BR>
With dauntless heart and ready hand.<BR>
There for a while the mighty force<BR>
That followed Bharat stayed its course,<BR>
Gazing on Gang&aacute;'s bosom stirred<BR>
By many a graceful water-bird.<BR>
When Bharat viewed his followers there,<BR>
And Gang&aacute;'s water, blest and fair,<BR>
The prince, who lore of words possessed,<BR>
His councillors and lords addressed:<BR>
'The captains of the army call:<BR>
Proclaim this day a halt for all,<BR>
That so to-morrow, rested, we<BR>
May cross this flood that seeks the sea.<BR>
Meanwhile, descending to the shore,<BR>
The funeral stream I fain would pour<BR>
From Gang&aacute;'s fair auspicious tide<BR>
To him, my father glorified.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Bharat spoke: each peer and lord<BR>
Approved his words with one accord,<BR>
And bade the weary troops repose<BR>
In separate spots where'er they chose.<BR>
There by the mighty stream that day,<BR>
Most glorious in its vast array<BR>
The prince's wearied army lay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In various groups reclined.<BR>
There Bharat's hours of night were spent,<BR>
While every eager thought he bent<BR>
On bringing home from banishment<BR>
His brother, great of mind.<BR>
