<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXVIII.: R&Aacute;VAN'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
They ran to R&aacute;van in his hall<BR>
And told him of his brother's fall:<BR>
'Fierce as the God who rules the dead,<BR>
Upon the routed foe he fed;<BR>
And, victor for a while, at length<BR>
Fell slain by R&aacute;ma's matchless strength,<BR>
Now like a mighty hill in size<BR>
His mangled trunk extended lies,<BR>
And where he fell, a bleeding mass,<BR>
Blocks Lank&aacute;'s gate tbat none may pass.'<BR>
The monarch heard: his strength gave way;<BR>
And fainting on the ground he lay.<BR>
Grieved at the giants' mournful tale,<BR>
Long, shrill was Atik&aacute;ya's wail;<BR>
Aud Tris'iras in sorrow bowed<BR>
His triple head, and wept aloud,<BR>
Mahodar, Mah&aacute;p&aacute;rs'va shed<BR>
Hot tears and mourned their brother dead.<BR>
At length, his wandering sense restored,<BR>
In loud lament cried Lank&aacute;'s lord:<BR>

<P>
Ah chief, for might and valour famed,<BR>
Whose arm the haughty foeman tamed,<BR>
Forsaking me, thy friends and all,<BR>
Why hast thou fled to Yama's hall?<BR>
Why hast thou fled to taste no more<BR>
The slaughtered foeman's flesh and gore?<BR>
Ah me, my life is done to-day:<BR>
My better arm is lopped away.<BR>
Whereon in danger I relied,<BR>
And, fearless, Gods and fiends defied.<BR>
How could a shaft from R&aacute;ma's bow<BR>
The matchless giant overthrow,<BR>
Whose iron frame so strong of yore<BR>
The crushing bolt of Indra bore?<BR>
This day the Gods and sages meet<BR>
And triumph at their foe's defeat.<BR>
This day the V&aacute;nar chiefs will boast<BR>
And, with new ardour fired, their host<BR>
In fiercer onset will assail<BR>
Our city, and the ramparts scale.<BR>
What care I for a monarch's name,<BR>
For empire, or the Maithil dame?<BR>
What joy can power and riches give,<BR>
Or life that I should care to live,<BR>
Unless this arm in mortal fray<BR>
The slayer of my brother slay?<BR>
For me, of Kumbhakarna reft,<BR>
Death is the only solace left;<BR>
And I will seek, o'erwhelmed with woes,<BR>
The realm to which my brother goes.<BR>
Ah me ill-minded, not to take<BR>
His counsel when Vibh&iacute;shan spake<BR>
When he this evil day foretold<BR>
My foolish heart was overbold:<BR>
I drove my sage adviser hence,<BR>
And reap the fruits of mine offence.'<BR>
