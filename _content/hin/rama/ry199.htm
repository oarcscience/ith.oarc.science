<P>
When R&aacute;ma, valiant hero, stood<BR>
In the vast shade of Dandak wood,<BR>
His eyes on every side he bent<BR>
And saw a hermit settlement,<BR>
Where coats of bark were hung around,<BR>
And holy grass bestrewed the ground.<BR>
Bright with Br&aacute;hmanic lustre glowed<BR>
That circle where the saints abode:<BR>
Like the hot sun in heaven it shone,<BR>
Too dazzling to be looked upon.<BR>
Wild creatures found a refuge where<BR>
The court, well-swept, was bright and fair:<BR>
And countless birds and roedeer made<BR>
Their dwelling in the friendly shade.<BR>
Beneath the boughs of well-loved trees<BR>
Oft danced the gay Apsarases. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_401"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Around was many an ample shed<BR>
Wherein the holy fire was fed;<BR>
With sacred grass and skins of deer,<BR>
Ladles and sacrificial gear,<BR>
And roots and fruit, and wood to burn,<BR>
And many a brimming water-urn.<BR>
Tall trees their hallowed branches spread,<BR>
Laden with pleasant fruit, o'erhead;<BR>
And gifts which holy laws require, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_402"></A><A HREF="#fn_402"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
And solemn offerings burnt with fire, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
And Veda chants on every side<BR>
That home of hermits sanctified.<BR>
There many a flower its odour shed,<BR>
And lotus blooms the lake o'erspred.<BR>
There, clad in coats of bark and hide,--<BR>
Their food by roots and fruit supplied,--<BR>
Dwelt many an old and reverend sire<BR>
Bright as the sun or Lord of Fire,<BR>
All with each worldly sense subdued,<BR>
A pure and saintly multitude.<BR>
The Veda chants, the saints who trod<BR>
The sacred ground and mused on God,<BR>
Made that delightful grove appear<BR>
Like Brahm&aacute;'s own most glorious sphere.<BR>
As Raghu's splendid son surveyed<BR>
That hermit home and tranquil shade,<BR>
He loosed his mighty bow-string, then<BR>
Drew nearer to the holy men.<BR>

With keen celestial sight endued<BR>
Those mighty saints the chieftain viewed,<BR>
With joy to meet the prince they came,<BR>
And gentle S&iacute;t&aacute; dear to fame.<BR>
They looked on virtuous R&aacute;ma, fair<BR>
As Soma &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the evening air,<BR>
And Lakshman by his brother's side,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; long in duty tried,<BR>
And with glad blessings every sage<BR>
Received them in the hermitage.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma's form and stature tall<BR>
Entranced the wondering eyes of all,--<BR>
His youthful grace, his strength of limb,<BR>
And garb that nobly sat on him.<BR>
To Lakshman too their looks they raised,<BR>
And upon S&iacute;t&aacute;'s beauty gazed<BR>
With eyes that closed not lest their sight<BR>
Should miss the vision of delight.<BR>
Then the pure hermits of the wood,<BR>
Rejoicing in all creatures' good,<BR>
Their guest, the glorious R&aacute;ma, led<BR>
Within a cot with leaves o'erhead.<BR>
With highest honour all the best<BR>
Of radiant saints received their guest,<BR>
With kind observance, as is meet,<BR>
And gave him water for his feet.<BR>
To highest pitch of rapture wrought<BR>
Their stores of roots and fruit they brought.<BR>
They poured their blessings on his head,<BR>
And 'All we have is thine,' they said.<BR>
Then, reverent hand to hand applied, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_405"></A><A HREF="#fn_405"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Each duty-loving hermit cried:<BR>
'The king is our protector, bright<BR>
In fame, maintainer of the right.<BR>
He bears the awful sword, and hence<BR>
Deserves an elder's reverence.<BR>
One fourth of Indra's essence, he<BR>
Preserves his realm from danger free,<BR>
Hence honoured by the world of right<BR>
The king enjoys each choice delight.<BR>
Thou shouldst to us protection give,<BR>
For in thy realm, dear lord, we live:<BR>
Whether in town or wood thou be,<BR>
Thou art our king, thy people we,<BR>
Our wordly aims are laid aside,<BR>
Our hearts are tamed and purified.<BR>
To thee our guardian, we who earn<BR>
Our only wealth by penance turn.'<BR>

<P>
Then the pure dwellers in the shade<BR>
To Raghu's son due honour paid,<BR>
And Lakshman, bringing store of roots,<BR>
And many a flower, and woodland fruits.<BR>


<P>

<P>


<P>
And others strove the prince to please<BR>
With all attentive courtesies.<BR>
