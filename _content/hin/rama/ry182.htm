<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CIV.: THE MEETING WITH THE QUEENS.</H3>
<P>
Vas'ishtha with his soul athirst<BR>
To look again on Rama, first<BR>
In line the royal widows placed,<BR>
And then the way behind them traced.<BR>
The ladies moving, faint and slow,<BR>
Saw the fair stream before them flow,<BR>
And by the bank their steps were led<BR>
Which the two brothers visited.<BR>
Kausalya with her faded cheek<BR>
Arid weeping eyes began to speak,<BR>
And thus in mournful tones addressed<BR>
The queen Sumitra and the rest:<BR>
'See in the wood the bank's descent,<BR>
Which the two orphan youths frequent,<BR>
Whose noble spirits never fall,<BR>
Though woes surround them, reft of all.<BR>
Thy son with love that never tires<BR>
Draws water hence which mine requires,<BR>
This day, for lowly toil unfit.<BR>
His pious task thy son should quit.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As on the long-eyed lady strayed,<BR>
On holy grass, whose points were laid<BR>
Directed to the southern sky,<BR>
When Rama's humble gift she spied<BR>
Thus to the queens Kausalya cried:<BR>
'The gift of Rama's hand behold,<BR>
His tribute to the king high-souled,<BR>
Offered to him, as texts require,<BR>
Lord of Ikshhvaku's line, his sire!<BR>
Not such I deem the funeral food<BR>
Of kings with godlike might endued.<BR>
Can he who knew all pleasuies, he<BR>
Who ruled the earth from sea to sea,<BR>
The mighty lord of monarchs, feed<BR>
On Ingudi's extracted seed?<BR>
In all the world there cannot be<BR>
A woe, I ween, more sad to see,<BR>
Than that my glorious son should make<BR>
His funeral gilt of such a cake.<BR>
The ancient text I oft have heard<BR>
This day is true in every word:<BR>
'Ne'er do the blessed Gods refuse<BR>
To eat the food their children use.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The ladies soothed the weeping dame:<BR>

<P>
To Rama's hermitage they came,<BR>
And there the hero met their eyes<BR>
Like a God fallen from the skies.<BR>
Him joyless, reft of all, they viewed,<BR>
And tears their mournful eyes bedewed.<BR>
The truthful hero left his seat,<BR>
And clasped the ladies' lotus feet,<BR>
And they with soft hands brushed away<BR>
The dust that on his shoulders lay.<BR>
Then Lakshman, when he saw each queen<BR>
With weeping eyes and troubled mien,<BR>
Near to the royal ladies drew<BR>
And paid them gentle reverence too.<BR>
He, Das'aratha's offspring, signed<BR>
The heir of bliss by Fortune kind,<BR>
Received from every dame no less<BR>
Each mark of love and tenderness.<BR>
And Sita came and bent before<BR>
The widows, while her eyes ran o'er,<BR>
And pressed their feet with many a tear.<BR>
They when they saw the lady dear<BR>
Pale, worn with dwelling in the wild.<BR>
Embraced her as a darling child:<BR>
Daughter of royal Janak, bride<BR>
Of Das'aratha's son, they cried,<BR>
'How couldst thou, offering of a king,<BR>
Endure this woe and suffering<BR>
In the wild forest? When I trace<BR>
Each sign of trouble on thy face-<BR>
That lotus which the sun has dried,<BR>
That lily by the tempest tried,<BR>
That gold whereon the dust is spread,<BR>
That moon whence all the light is fled--<BR>
Sorrow assails my heart, alas!<BR>
As fire consumes the wood and grass.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Rama, as she spoke distressed,<BR>
The feet of Saint Vas'ishtha pressed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Touched them with reverential love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Then near him took his seat:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Indra clasps in realms above<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The Heavenly Teacher's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_380"></A><A HREF="#fn_380"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> feet.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then with each counsellor and peer,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Bharat of duteous mind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With citizens and captains near,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Sat humbly down behind.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When with his hands to him upraised,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    In devotee's attire.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bharat upon his brother gazed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Whose glory shone like fire,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As when the pure Maheridra bends<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To the great Lord of Life,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Among his noble crowd of friends<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    This anxious thought was rife:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'What words to Raghu's son to-day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Will royal Bharat speak,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Whose heart has been so prompt to pay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Obeisance fond and meek?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then steadfast Rama, Lakshman wise,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Bharat for truth renowned,<BR>
