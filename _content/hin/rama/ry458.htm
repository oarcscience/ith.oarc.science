<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXII: R&Aacute;VAN'S REQUEST</H3>
<P>
Along bright Lank&aacute;'s royal road<BR>
The giant, roused from slumber, strode,<BR>
While from the houses on his head<BR>
A rain of fragrant flowers was shed.<BR>
He reached the monarch's gate whereon<BR>
Rich gems and golden fretwork shone.<BR>
Through court and corridor that shook<BR>
Beneath his tread his way he took,<BR>
And stood within the chamber where<BR>
His brother sat in dark despair.<BR>
But sudden, at the grateful sight<BR>
The monarch's eye again grew bright.<BR>
He started up, forgot his fear,<BR>
And drew his giant brother near.<BR>
The younger pressed the elder's feet<BR>
And paid the King observance meet,<BR>
Then cried: 'O Monarch, speak thy will,<BR>
And let my care thy word fulfil.<BR>
What sudden terror and dismay<BR>
Have burst the bonds in which I lay?'<BR>
Fierce flashed the flame from R&aacute;van's eye.<BR>
As thus in wrath he made reply:<BR>
' Fair time, I ween, for sleep is this,<BR>
To lull thy soul in tranquil bliss,<BR>
Unheeding, in oblivion drowned,<BR>
The dangers that our lives surround.<BR>
Brave R&aacute;ma, Das'aratha's son,<BR>
A passage o'er the sea has won,<BR>
And, with the V&aacute;nar monarch's aid.<BR>
Round Lank&aacute;'s walls his hosts arrayed.<BR>
Though never in the deadly field<BR>
My R&aacute;kshas troops were known to yield,<BR>
The bravest of the giant train<BR>
Have fallen by the V&aacute;nars slain.<BR>
Hence comes my fear. O fierce and brave,<BR>
Go forth, our threatened Lank&aacute;' save.<BR>
Go forth, a dreadful vengeance take:<BR>
For this, O chief, I bade thee wake.<BR>
The Gods and trembling fiends have felt<BR>
The furious blows thine arm has dealt.<BR>
Earth has no warrior, heaven has none<BR>
To match thy might, Paulastya's eon,'<BR>
