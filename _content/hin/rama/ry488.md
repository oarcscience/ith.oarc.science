### CANTO CXVII.: SÍTÁ'S DISGRACE.

He saw her trembling by his side,  
And looked upon her face and cried:  
'Lady, at length my task is done,  
And thou, the prize of war, art won,  
This arm my glory has retrieved,  
And all that man might do achieved;  
The insulting foe in battle slain  
And cleared mine honour from its stain.  
This day has made my name renowned  
And with success my labour crowned.  
Lord of myself, the oath I swore  
Is binding on my soul no more.  
If from my home my queen was reft,  
This arm has well avenged the theft,  
And in the field has wiped away  
The blot that on mine honour lay.  
The bridge that spans the foaming flood,  
The city red with giants' blood;  
The hosts by King Sugríva led  
Who wisely counselled, fought and bled;  
Vibhíshan's love, our guide and stay--  
All these are crowned with fruit to-day.  
But, lady,'twas not love for thee  
That led mine army o'er the sea.  
'Twas not for thee our blood was shed,  
Or Lanká filled with giant dead.  
No fond affection for my wife  
Inspired me in the hour of strife.  
I battled to avenge the cause  
Of honour and insulted laws.  
My love is fled, for on thy fame  
Lies the dark blot of sin and shame;  
And thou art hateful as the light

That flashes on the injured sight.  
The world is all before thee: flee:  
Go where thou wilt, but not with me.  
How should my home receive again  
A mistress soiled with deathless stain?  
How should I brook the foul disgrace,  
Scorned by my friends and all my race?  
For Rávan bore thee through the sky,  
And fixed on thine his evil eye.  
About thy waist his arms he threw,  
Close to his breast his captive drew,  
And kept thee, vassal of his power,  
An inmate of his ladies' bower.'
