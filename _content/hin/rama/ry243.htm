<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLV.: LAKSHMAN'S DEPARTURE.</H3>
<P>
But Sit&aacute; hearing as she thought,<BR>
Her husband's cry with anguish fraught.<BR>
Called to her guardian, 'Lakshman, run<BR>
And in the wood seek Raghu's son.<BR>
Scarce can my heart retain its throne,<BR>
Scarce can my life be called mine own,<BR>
Assail my powers and senses fail<BR>
At that long loud and bitter wail.<BR>
Haste to the wood with all thy speed<BR>
And save thy brother in his need<BR>
Go, save him in the distant glade<BR>
Where loud he calls, for timely aid.<BR>
He * beneath some giant foe,<BR>
A * whom * overthrown'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  * to her prayer,* step he stirred<BR>
Obedient to his mother's word<BR>
T * Janak's child, with inflamed,<BR>
* scorn *<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sumitr&aacute;'s son, a friend *<BR>
* they brother's foe<BR>
W* at such *<BR>
* and neglect *<BR>
* Lakshman, * of me<BR>
* couldst see,<BR>
* thy *<BR>
* thy feet so *<BR>

<P>
Thou hast no love for R&aacute;ma, no<BR>
Thy joy is vice thy thoughts are low<BR>
Hence thus unmoved thou yet canst stay<BR>
While my dear lord is far away.<BR>
If aught of ill my lord betide<BR>
Who led thee here, thy chief and guide<BR>
Ah what will be my hapless fate<BR>
Left in the wild wood desolate!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spoke the lady sad with fear.<BR>
With many a sigh and many a tear,<BR>
Still trembling like a captured doe:<BR>
And Lakshman spoke to calm her woe:<BR>
&nbsp; 'Videhan Queen, be sure of this,--<BR>
And at the thought thy fear dismiss,--<BR>
Thy husband's mightier power defies<BR>
All Gods and angels of the skies,<BR>
Gandharvas, and the sons of light,<BR>
Serpents, and rovers of the night<BR>
I tell thee, of the sons of earth,<BR>
Of Gods who boast celestial birth,<BR>
Of beasts and birds and giant hosts,<BR>
Of demigods, Gandharvas ghosts,<BR>
Of awful fiends, O thou most fair,<BR>
There lives not one whose heart would dare<BR>
To meet thy R&aacute;ma in the fight,<BR>
Like Indra's self unmatched in might.<BR>
Such idle words thou must not say<BR>
Thy R&aacute;ma lives whom none may slay.<BR>
I will not, cannot leave thee here<BR>
In the wild wood till he be near.<BR>
The mightiest strength can ne'er withstand<BR>
His eager force, his vigorous hand.<BR>
No, not the triple world allied<BR>
With all the immortal Gods beside.<BR>
Dismiss thy fear, again take heart,<BR>
Let all thy doubt and woe depart.<BR>
Thy lord, be sure, will soon be here<BR>
And bring thee back that best of deer,<BR>
Not his, not his that mournful cry,<BR>
Nor haply came it from the sky.<BR>
Some giant's art was busy there<BR>
And framed a castle based on air<BR>
A precious pledge art thou, consigned<BR>
To me by him of noblest mind,<BR>
Nor can I fairest dame, forsake<BR>
The pledge which R&aacute;ma bade me take.<BR>
Upon our heads, O Queen, we drew<BR>
The giants' hate when R&aacute;ma slew<BR>
Their chieftain Khara, and the shade<BR>
Of Janasth&aacute;n in ruin laid.<BR>
Through all this mighty wood they rove<BR>
With varied cries from grove to grove<BR>
On * bent they wander here.<BR>
But O dismiss thy causeless fear.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bright flashed her eye as Lashman spoke<BR>
And forth her words of fury broke<BR>
Upon her truthful guardian, flung<BR>
With bitter taunts that pierced and stung;<BR>
'Shame on such false compassion, base<BR>
* of thy glorious race!<BR>
* joyous sight I ween to thee<BR>

<P>
My lord in direst strait to see.<BR>
Thou knowest R&aacute;ma sore bested,<BR>
Or word like this thou ne'er hadst said.<BR>
No marvel if we find such sin<BR>
In rivals false to kith and kin.<BR>
Wretches like thee of evil kind,<BR>
Concealing crime with crafty mind.<BR>
Thou, wretch, thine aid wilt still deny,<BR>
And leave my lord alone to die.<BR>
Has love of me unnerved thy hand,<BR>
Or Bharat's art this ruin planned?<BR>
But be the treachery his or thine,<BR>
In vain, in vain the base design.<BR>
For how shall I, the chosen bride<BR>
Of dark-hued R&aacute;ma, lotus-eyed,<BR>
The queen who once called R&aacute;ma mine,<BR>
To love of other men decline?<BR>
Believe me, Lakshman, R&aacute;ma's wife<BR>
Before thine eyes will quit this life,<BR>
And not a moment will she stay<BR>
If her dear lord have passed away.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The lady's bitter speech, that stirred<BR>
Each hair upon his frame, he heard.<BR>
With lifted hands together laid,<BR>
His calm reply he gently made:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'No words have I to answer now:<BR>
My deity, O Queen, art thou.<BR>
But 'tis no marvel, dame, to find<BR>
Such lack of sense in womankind.<BR>
Throughout this world, O Maithil dame,<BR>
Weak women's hearts are still the same.<BR>
Inconstant, urged by envious spite,<BR>
They sever friends and hate the right.<BR>
I cannot brook, Videhan Queen,<BR>
Thy words intolerably keen.<BR>
Mine ears thy fierce reproaches pain<BR>
As boiling water seethes the brain.<BR>
And now to bear me witness all<BR>
The dwellers in the wood I call,<BR>
That, when with words of truth I plead,<BR>
This harsh reply is all my meed.<BR>
Ah, woe is thee! Ah, grief, that still<BR>
Eager to do my brother's will,<BR>
Mourning thy woman's nature, I<BR>
Must see thee doubt my truth and die.<BR>
I fly to R&aacute;ma's side, and Oh,<BR>
May bliss attend thee while I go!<BR>
May all attendant wood-gods screen<BR>
Thy head from harm, O large-eyed Queen<BR>
And though dire omens meet my sight<BR>
And fill my soul with wild affright,<BR>
May I return in peace and see<BR>
The son of Raghu safe with thee!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The child of Janak heard him speak,<BR>
And the hot tear-drops down her cheek,<BR>
Increasing to a torrent, ran,<BR>
Aa thus once more the dame began:<BR>
'O Lakshman, if I widowed be<BR>
God&aacute;van's** flood shall cover me,<BR>
Or I will die by cord, or leap,<BR>
Life weary, from yon rocky steep;<BR>

<P>
Or deadly poison will I drink,<BR>
Or 'neath the kindled flames will sink,<BR>
But never, reft of R&aacute;ma, can<BR>
Consent to touch a meaner man.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Maithil dame with many sighs,<BR>
And torrents pouring from her eyes,<BR>
The faithful Lakshman thus adressed,<BR>
And smote her hands upon her breast.<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;'s son, o'erwhelmed by fears,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Looked on the large-eyed queen:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He saw that flood of burning tears,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He saw that piteous mien.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He yearned sweet comfort to afford,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He strove to soothe her pain<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    But to the brother of her lord<BR>
&nbsp; She spoke no word again.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His reverent hands once more he raised,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His head he slightly bent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Upon her face he sadly gazed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And then toward R&aacute;ma went.<BR>
