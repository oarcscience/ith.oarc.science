### CANTO XXXVIII.: SUGRÍVA'S DEPARTURE.

Thus all the princely Vánars, true  
To their appointed tasks, withdrew.  
Suigríva deemed already done  
The work he planned for Raghu's son.  
Then Lakshman gently spoke and cheered  
Sugríva for his valour feared:  
' Now, chieftain, if thy will be so.  
Forth from Kishkindhá let us go.'  
Sugríva's heart swelled high with pride  
As to the prince he thus replied:  
'Come, speed we forth without delay:  
'Tis mine thy mandate to obey.'  
Sugríva bade the dames adieu,  
And Tárá and the rest withdrew.  
Then at their chieftain's summons came  
The Vánars first in rank and fame,  
A trusty brave and reverent band,  
Meet e'en before a queen to stand.  
They at his call made haste to bring  
The litter of the glorious king.  
' Mount, O my friend.' Sugríva cried,  
And straight Sumitrá's son complied.  
Then took by Lakshman's side his place  
The sovereign of the woodland race,  
Upraised by Vánars, fleet and strong.  
Who bore the glittering load along.  
On high above his royal head  
A paly canopy was spread,  
And chouries white in many a hand  
The forehead of the monarch fanned,  
And shell and drum and song and shout  
Pealed round him as the king passed out.  

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>  

About the monarch went a throng  
Of Vánar warriors brave and strong,  
As onward to the mountain shade  
Where Ráma dwelt his way he made.  
Soon as the lovely spot he viewed  
Where Ráma lived in solitude,  
The Vánar monarch, far-renowed,  
With Lakshman, lightly stepped to ground,  
And to the son of Raghu went  
Joining his raised hands reverent.  
As their great leader raised his hands,  
So suppliant stood the Vánar bands.  
Well pleased the son of Raghu saw  
Those legions, hushed in reverent awe,  
Stand silent like the tranquil floods  
That raise their hands of lotus buds.  
But Ráma, when the king, to greet  
His friend, had bowed him at his feet,  
Raised him who ruled the Vanar race,  
And held him in a close embrace:  
Then, when his arms he had unknit,  
Besought him by his side to sit,  
And thus with gentle words the best  
Of men the Vánar king addressed:  
   'The prince who well his days divides,  
And knows aright the times and tides  
To follow duty, joy, or gain,  
He, only he, deserves to reign.  
But he who wealth and virtue leaves,  
And every hour to pleasure cleaves,  
False from his bliss like him who wakes  
From slumber on a branch that breaks.  
True king is he who smites his foes,  
And favour to his servants shows,  
And of that fruit makes timely use  
Which virtue, wealth, and joy produce.  
The hour is come that bids thee rise  
To aid me in my enterprise.  
Then call thy nobles to debate,  
And with their help deliberate.'  
   'Lost was my power,' the king replied,  
'All strength had fled, all hope had died  
The Vánars owned another lord,  
But by thy grace was all restored.  
All this, O conqueror of the foe,  
To thee and Lakshman's aid I owe  
And his should be the villain's shame  
Who durst deny the sacred claim.  
These Vánar chiefs of noblest birth  
Have at my bidding roamed the earth,  
And brought from distant regions all  
Our legions at their monarch's call:  
Fierce bears with monkey troops combined,  
And apes of every varied kind,  
Terrific in their forms, who dwell  
In grove and wood and bosky dell:  
The bright Gaudharvas' brood, the seed  
Of Gods, <span id="fr_651"></span>[1](#fn_651) they change their shapes
at need.  

Each with his legions in array,  
Hither, O Prince, they make their way,  
They come: and tens of millions swell  
To numbers that no tongue may tell. <span
id="fr_652"></span>[1b](ry313.htm#fn_652)  
For thee their armies will unite  
With chiefs, Mahendra's peers in might.  
From Meru and from Vindhya's chain  
They come like clouds that bring the rain.  
These round thee to the war will go,  
To smite to earth thy demon foe;  
Will slay the Rákshas and restore  
Thy consort when the fight is o'er."
