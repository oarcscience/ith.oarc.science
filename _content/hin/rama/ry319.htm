<P>
Away, away the V&aacute;nars<BR>
Like locusts o'er the land outspread.<BR>
To northern realms where rising high<BR>
The King of Mountains cleaves the sky,<BR>
Fierce S'atabal with vast array<BR>
Of V&aacute;nariors led the way.<BR>
Far southward, as his lord decreed,<BR>
Wise Hanum&aacute;n Wind-God's seed,<BR>
With Angad his swift way pursued,<BR>
And T&aacute;ra's warlike multitude,<BR>
Strong Vinata with all his band<BR>
Betook him to the eastern land,<BR>
And brave Sushen in eager quest<BR>
Sped swiftly to the gloomy west.<BR>
Each V&aacute;narftain sought with speed<BR>
The quarter by his king decreed,<BR>
While from his legions rose on high<BR>
The shout and boast and battle cry:<BR>
'We will restore the dame and beat<BR>
The robber down beneath our feet.<BR>
My arm alone shall win the day<BR>
From R&aacute;vanin single fray,<BR>
Shall rob the robber of his life,<BR>
And rescue R&aacute;ma's captive wife<BR>
All trembling in her fear and woe.<BR>
Here, comrades, rest: no farther go:<BR>
For I will vanquish hell, and she<BR>
Shall by this arm again be free.<BR>
The rooted mountains will I rend,<BR>
The mightiest trees will break and bend.<BR>
Earth to her deep foundations cleave,<BR>
And make the calm sea throb and heave.<BR>
A hundred leagues from steep to steep<BR>
In desperate bound my feet shall leap.<BR>
My steps shall tread unchecked and free.<BR>
Through woods, o'er land and hill and sea,<BR>
Range as they list from flood to fell,<BR>
And wander through the depths of hell.<BR>
