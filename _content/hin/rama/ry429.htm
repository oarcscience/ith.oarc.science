<P>
They told their lord that R&aacute;ma still<BR>
Lay waiting by Suvela's hill.<BR>

<P>
The tyrant, flushed with angry glow,<BR>
Heard of the coming of the foe,<BR>
And thus with close inquiry pressed<BR>
S'&aacute;rd&uacute;la spokesman for the rest:<BR>
'Why art thou sad, night-rover? speak:<BR>
Has grief or terror changed thy cheek?<BR>
Have the wild V&aacute;nars' hostile bands<BR>
Assailed thee with their mighty hands?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  S'&aacute;rd&uacute;la heard, but scarce might speak;<BR>
His trembling tones were faint and weak;<BR>
'O Giant King, in vain we try<BR>
The purpose of the foe to spy.<BR>
Their strength and number none may tell,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma guards his legions well.<BR>
He leaves no hope to prying eyes,<BR>
And parley with the chiefs denies:<BR>
Each road and path a V&aacute;nar guard,<BR>
Of mountain size, has closed and barred.<BR>
Soon as my feet an entrance found<BR>
By giants was I seized and bound,<BR>
And wounded sore I fell beneath<BR>
Their fists and knees and hands and teeth.<BR>
Then trembling, bleeding, wellnigh dead<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's presence was I led.<BR>
He in his mercy stooped to save,<BR>
And freedom to the captive gave.<BR>
With rocks and shattered mountains he<BR>
Has bridged his way athwart the sea,<BR>
And he and all his legions wait<BR>
Embattled close to Lank&aacute;'s gate.<BR>
Soon will the host thy wall assail,<BR>
And, swarming on, the rampart scale,<BR>
Now, O my King, his consort yield,<BR>
Or arm thee with the sword and shield.<BR>
This choice is left thee: choose between<BR>
Thy safety and the Maithil queen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_953"></A><A HREF="ry430.htm#fn_953"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
