<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXVIII.: MANTHAR&Aacute; PUNISHED.</H3>
<P>
Satrughna thus to Bharat spake<BR>
Who longed the forest road to take:<BR>
'He who in woe was wont to give<BR>
Strength to himself and all that live--<BR>
Dear R&aacute;ma, true and pure in heart,<BR>
Is banished by a woman's art.<BR>
Yet here was Lakshman, brave and strong,<BR>
Could not his might prevent the wrong?<BR>
Could not his arm the king restrain,<BR>
Or make the banished free again?<BR>
One loving right and fearing crime<BR>
Had checked the monarch's sin in time,<BR>
When, vassal of a woman's will,<BR>
His feet approached the path of ill.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  While Lakshman's younger brother, dread<BR>
S'atrughna, thus to Bharat said,<BR>
Came to the fronting door, arrayed<BR>
In glittering robes, the hump-back maid.<BR>
There she, with sandal-oil besmeared,<BR>
In garments meet for queens appeared:<BR>
And lustre to her form was lent<BR>
By many a gem and ornament.<BR>
She girdled with her broidered zone,<BR>
And many a chain about her thrown,<BR>
Showed like a female monkey round<BR>
Whose body many a string is bound.<BR>
When on that cause of evil fell<BR>
The quick eye of the sentinel,<BR>

<P>

<P>
He grasped her in his ruthless hold,<BR>
And hastening in, S'atrughna told:<BR>
'Here is the wicked pest,' he cried,<BR>
'Through whom the king thy father died,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma wanders in the wood:<BR>
Do with her as thou deemest good.'<BR>
The warder spoke: and every word<BR>
S'atrughna's breast to fury stirred:<BR>
He called the servants all and each.<BR>
And spake in wrath his hasty speech:<BR>
'This is the wretch my sire who slew,<BR>
And misery on my brothers drew:<BR>
Let her this day obtain the meed,<BR>
Vile sinner, of her cruel deed.'<BR>
He spake; and moved by fury laid<BR>
His mighty hand upon the maid,<BR>
Who as her fellows ringed her round.<BR>
Made with her cries the hall resound,<BR>
Soon as the gathered women viewed<BR>
S'atrughna in his angry mood,<BR>
Their hearts disturbed by sudden dread,<BR>
They turned and from his presence fled.<BR>
'His rage,' they cried, 'on us will fall,<BR>
And ruthless, he will slay us all.<BR>
Come, to Kaus'aly&aacute; let us flee:<BR>
Our hope, our sure defence is she,<BR>
Approved by all, of virtuous mind,<BR>
Compassionate, and good, and kind.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His eyes with burning wrath aglow,<BR>
S'atrughna, shatterer of the foe,<BR>
Dragged on the ground the hump-back maid<BR>
Who shrieked aloud and screamed for aid.<BR>
This way and that with no remorse<BR>
He dragged her with resistless force,<BR>
And chains and glittering trinkets burst<BR>
Lay here and there with gems dispersed,<BR>
Till like the sky of Autumn shone<BR>
The palace floor they sparkled on.<BR>
The lord of men, supremely strong,<BR>
Haled in his rage the wretch along:<BR>
Where Queen Kaikey&iacute; dwelt he came,<BR>
And sternly then addressed the dame.<BR>
Deep in her heart Kaikey&iacute; felt<BR>
The stabs his keen reproaches dealt,<BR>
And of S'atrughna's ire afraid,<BR>
To Bharat flew and cried for aid.<BR>
He looked and saw the prince inflamed<BR>
With burning rage, and thus exclaimed:<BR>
'Forgive! thine angry arm restrain:<BR>
A woman never may be slain,<BR>
My hand Kaikey&iacute;'s blood would spill,<BR>
The sinner ever bent on ill,<BR>
But R&aacute;ma, long in duty tried,<BR>
Would hate the impious matricide:<BR>
And if he knew thy vengeful blade<BR>
Had slaughtered e'en this hump-back maid,<BR>
Never again, be sure, would he<BR>
Speak friendly word to thee or me."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Bharat's speech S'atrughna heard<BR>
He calmed the rage his breast that stirred,<BR>

<P>

<P>
Releasing from her dire constraint<BR>
The trembling wretch with terror faint.<BR>
Then to Kaikey&iacute;'s feet she crept,<BR>
And prostrate in her misery wept.<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; on the hump-back gazed,<BR>
&nbsp; And saw her weep and gasp.<BR>
Still quivering, with her senses dazed,<BR>
&nbsp; From fierce S'atrughna's grasp.<BR>
With gentle words of pity she<BR>
&nbsp; Assuaged her wild despair.<BR>
Even as a tender hand might free<BR>
&nbsp; A curlew from the snare.<BR>
