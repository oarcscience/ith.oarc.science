<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXV.: T&Aacute;R&Aacute;'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
He ceased: and T&aacute;r&aacute; starry-eyed<BR>
Thus to the angry prince replied:<BR>
'Not to my lord shouldst thou address<BR>
A speech so fraught with bitterness:<BR>
Not thus reproached my lord should be,<BR>
And least of all, O Prince, by thee.<BR>
He is no thankless coward--no--<BR>
With spirit dead to valour's glow.<BR>
From paths of truth he never strays,<BR>
Nor wanders in forbidden ways.<BR>
Ne'er will Sugr&iacute;va's heart forget,<BR>
By R&aacute;ma saved, the lasting debt.<BR>
Still in his grateful breast will live<BR>
The succour none but he could give.<BR>
Restored to fame by R&aacute;ma's grace,<BR>
To empire o'er the V&aacute;nar race,<BR>
From ceaseless dread and toil set free,<BR>
Restored to Rum&aacute; and to me:<BR>
By grief and care and exile tried,<BR>
New to the bliss so long denied,<BR>
Like Visv&aacute;mitra once, alas,<BR>
He marks not how the seasons pass.<BR>
That saint ten thousand years remained,<BR>
By sweet Ghrit&aacute;ch&iacute;s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_642"></A><A HREF="#fn_642"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> love enchained,<BR>
And deemed those years, that flew away<BR>
So lightly, but a single day.<BR>
O, if those years unheeded flew<BR>
By him who times and seasons knew,<BR>
Unequalled for his lofty mind.<BR>
What marvel meaner eyes are blind?<BR>
Then be not angry, Raghu's son,<BR>
And let thy brother feel for one<BR>
Who many a weary year has spent<BR>
Stranger to love and blandishment.<BR>
Let not this wrath thy soul inflame,<BR>
Like some mean wretch unknown to fame:<BR>
For high and noble hearts like thine<BR>
Love mercy and to truth incline,<BR>
Calm and deliberate, and slow<BR>
With anger's raging fire to glow.<BR>
At length, O righteous prince, relent,<BR>
Nor let my words in vain be spent.<BR>
This sudden blaze of fury slake,<BR>
I pray thee for Sugr&iacute;va's sake.<BR>
He would renounce at R&aacute;ma's call<BR>
Rum&aacute; and Angad, me and all<BR>
Who call him lord: his gold and grain,<BR>
The favour of his friend to gain.<BR>
His arm shall slay the fiend more base<BR>
In soul than all his impious race,<BR>
And happy R&aacute;ma reunite<BR>
To Sit&aacute;, rival in delight<BR>

<P>

<P>
Of the triumphant Moon when he<BR>
Rejoins his darling Rohin&iacute;. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_643"></A><A HREF="ry310.htm#fn_643"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Ten million million demons guard<BR>
The gates of Lank&aacute; firmly barred.<BR>
All hope until that host be slain,<BR>
To smite the robber king is vain.<BR>
Nor with Sugr&iacute;va's aid alone<BR>
May king and host be overthrown.<BR>
Thus ere he died--for well he knew--<BR>
Spake B&aacute;li, and his words are true.<BR>
I know not what his proofs might be,<BR>
But speak the words he spake to me.<BR>
Hence far and wide our lords are sent<BR>
To raise the mightiest armament.<BR>
For their return Sugr&iacute;va waits<BR>
Ere he can sally from his gates.<BR>
Still is the oath Sugr&iacute;va swore<BR>
Kept firmly even as before:<BR>
And the great host this day will be<BR>
Assembled by the king's decree,<BR>
Ten thousand thousand troops, who wear<BR>
The form of monkey and of bear,<BR>
Prepared for thee the war to wage:<BR>
Then let thy wrath no longer rage.<BR>
The matrons of the V&aacute;nar race<BR>
See marks of fury in thy face;<BR>
They see thine eyes like blood are red,<BR>
And will not yet be comforted.'<BR>
