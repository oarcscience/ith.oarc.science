<P>
That speech so noble which conveyed<BR>
His friendly wish, the chief obeyed.<BR>
With steps made swift by anxious thought<BR>
The wise Suyajna's home he sought,<BR>
Him in the hall of Fire &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he found.<BR>
And bent before him to the ground:<BR>
'O friend, to Rama's house return,<BR>
Who now performs a task most stern.'<BR>
He, when his noonday rites were done.<BR>
Went forth with fair Sumitra's son,<BR>
And came to R&aacute;ma's bright abode<BR>
Rich in the love which Lakshmi showed.<BR>
The son of Raghu with his dame.<BR>
With joined hands met him as he came,<BR>
Showing to him who Scripture knew<BR>
The worship that is Agni's due.<BR>


<P>


<P>
With armlets, bracelets, collars, rings,<BR>
With costly pearls on golden strings,<BR>
With many a gem for neck and limb<BR>
The son of Raghu honoured him.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, at his wife's request,<BR>
The wise Suyajna thus addressed;<BR>
'Accept a necklace too to deck<BR>
With golden strings thy spouse's neck.<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; here, my friend, were glad<BR>
A girdle to her gift to add.<BR>
And many a bracelet wrought with care,<BR>
And many an armlet rich and rare,<BR>
My wife to thine is fain to give,<BR>
Departing in the wood to live.<BR>
A bed by skilful workmen made,<BR>
With gold and various gems inlaid--<BR>
This too, before she goes, would she<BR>
Present, O saintly friend, to thee.<BR>
Thine be my elephant, so famed,<BR>
My uncle's present. Victor named;<BR>
And let a thousand coins of gold,<BR>
Great Brahman, with the gift be told.'<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma spoke: nor he declined<BR>
The noble gitts for him designed.<BR>
On R&aacute;ma, Lakshman, S&iacute;t&aacute; he<BR>
Invoked all high felicity.<BR>

<P>
In pleasant words then R&aacute;ma gave<BR>
His hest to Lakshman prompt and brave,<BR>
As Brahm&aacute; speaks for Him to hear<BR>
Who rules the Gods' celestial sphere:<BR>
'To the two best of Br&aacute;hmans run;<BR>
Agastya bring, and Kus'ik's son,<BR>
And precious gifts upon them rain,<BR>
Like fostering floods upon the grain.<BR>
O long-armed Prince of Raghu's line,<BR>
Delight them with a thousand kine,<BR>
And many a fair and costly gem,<BR>
With gold and silver, give to them.<BR>
To him, so deep in Scripture, who,<BR>
To Queen Kaus'aly&aacute;, ever true,<BR>
Serves her with blessing and respect,<BR>
Chief of the Taittiriya sect &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A>--<BR>
To him. with women-slaves, present<BR>
A chariot rich with ornament,<BR>
And costly robes of silk beside,<BR>
Until the sage be satisfied.<BR>
On Chitraratha. true aud dear,<BR>
My tuneful bard and charioteer,<BR>
Gems, robes, and plenteous wealth confer--<BR>
Mine ancient friend and minister.<BR>
And these who go with staff in hand,<BR>
Grammarians trained, a numerous band.<BR>
Who their deep study only prize,<BR>
Nor think of other exercise,<BR>
Who toil not, loving dainty fare,<BR>
Whose praises e'en the good declare--<BR>
On these be eighty cars bestowed,<BR>
And each with precious treasures load.<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
A thousand bulls for them suffice,<BR>
Two hundred elephants of price,<BR>
And let a thousand kine beside<BR>
The dainties of each meal provide.<BR>
The throng who sacred girdles wear,<BR>
And on K&aacute;usaly&aacute; wait with care--<BR>
A thousand golden coins shall please,<BR>
Son of Sumitr&aacute;, each of these.<BR>
Let all, dear Lakshman, of the train<BR>
These special gifts of honour gain;<BR>
My mother will rejoice to know<BR>
Her Br&aacute;hmans have been cherished so.'<BR>

<P>
Then Raghu's son addressed the crowd<BR>
Who round him stood and wept aloud,<BR>
When he to all who thronged the court<BR>
Had dealt his wealth for their support:<BR>
'In Lakshman's house and mine remain,<BR>
And guard them till I come again,'<BR>
To all his people sad with grief.<BR>
In loving ords thus spoke their chief,<BR>
Then bade his treasure-keeper bring<BR>
Gold, silver, and each precious thing.<BR>
Then straight the servants went and bore<BR>
Back to their chief the wealth in store,<BR>
Before the people's eyes it shone,<BR>
A glorious pile to look upon.<BR>
The prince of men with Lakshman's aid<BR>
Parted the treasuures there displaved,<BR>
Gave to the poor, the young, the old,<BR>
And twice-born men, the gems and gold.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A Br&aacute;hman, long in evil case.<BR>
Named Trijat, born of Garga's race,<BR>
Earned ever toiling in a wood<BR>
With spade and plough his livelihood.<BR>
The youthful wife, his babes who bore,<BR>
Their indigence felt more and more.<BR>
Thus to the aged man she spake:<BR>
'Hear this my word: my counsel take.<BR>
Come, throw thy spade and plough away;<BR>
To virtuous R&aacute;ma go to-day.<BR>
And somewhat of his kindness pray.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He heard the word she spoke: around<BR>
His limbs his ragged cloth he wound.<BR>
And took his journey by the road<BR>
That led to R&aacute;ma's fair abode.<BR>
To the fifth court be made his way;<BR>
Nor met the Br&aacute;hman check or stay.<BR>
Brighu, Angiras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_309"></A><A HREF="#fn_309"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> could not be<BR>
Brighter with saintly light than Vie,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's presence on he pressed.<BR>
And thus the noble chief addressed:<BR>
'O R&aacute;ma, poor and weak am I,<BR>
And many children round me cry.<BR>
Scant living in the woods I earn:<BR>
On me thine eye of pity turn.'<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, bent on sport and jest,<BR>
The suppliant Br&aacute;hman thus addressed:<BR>

<P>

<P>
'O aged man, one thousand kine,<BR>
Yet undistributed, are mine.<BR>
The cows on thee will I bestow<BR>
As far as thou thy staff canst throw.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Br&aacute;hman heard. In eager haste<BR>
He bound his cloth around his waist.<BR>
Then round his head his staff he whirled,<BR>
And forth with mightiest effort hurled.<BR>
Cast from his hand it flew, and sank<BR>
To earth on Sarj&uacute;'s farther bank,<BR>
Where herds of kine in thousands fed<BR>
Near to the well-stocked bullock shed.<BR>
And all the cows that wandered o'er<BR>
The meadow, far as Sarj&uacute;'s shore.<BR>
At R&aacute;ma's word the herdsmen drove<BR>
To Trijat's cottage in the grove.<BR>
He drew the Br&aacute;hman to his breast,<BR>
And thus with calming words addressed:<BR>
'Now be not angry, Sire. I pray:<BR>
This jest of mine was meant in play.<BR>
These thousand kine, but not alone.<BR>
Their herdsmen too, are all thine own.<BR>
And wealth beside I give thee: speak.<BR>
Thine shall be all thy heart can seek.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma spake. And Trijat prayed<BR>
For means his sacrifice to aid.<BR>
And Rama gave much wealth, required<BR>
To speed his offering as desired.<BR>
