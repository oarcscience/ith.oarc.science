<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXVII.: THE BREAKING OF THE BOW.</H3>
<P>
Then spoke again the great recluse:<BR>
'This mighty bow, O King, produce.'<BR>
King Janak, at the saint's request,<BR>
This order to his train addressed:<BR>
'Let the great bow be hither borne,<BR>
Which flowery wreaths and scents adorn.'<BR>
Soon as the monarch's words were said,<BR>
His servants to the city sped,<BR>
Five thousand youths in number, all<BR>
Of manly strength and stature tall,<BR>
The ponderous eight-wheeled chest that held<BR>
The heavenly bow, with toil propelled.<BR>
At length they brought that iron chest,<BR>
And thus the godlike king addressed:<BR>
'This best of bows, O lord, we bring,<BR>
Respected by each chief and king,<BR>
And place it for these youths to see,<BR>
If, Sovereign, such thy pleasure be.'<BR>

<P>
With suppliant palm to palm applied<BR>
King Janak to the strangers cried:<BR>
'This gem of bows, O Br&aacute;hman Sage,<BR>
Our race has prized from age to age.<BR>
Too strong for those who yet have reigned,<BR>
Though great in might each nerve they strained.<BR>

<P>
Titan and fiend its strength defies,<BR>
God, spirit, minstrel of the skies.<BR>
And bard above and snake below<BR>
Are baffled by this glorious bow.<BR>
Then how may human prowess hope<BR>
With such a bow as this to cope?<BR>
What man with valour's choicest gift<BR>
This bow can draw, or string, or lift?<BR>
Yet let the princes, holy Seer,<BR>
Behold it: it is present here.'<BR>

<P>
Then spoke the hermit pious-souled:<BR>
'R&aacute;ma, dear son, the bow behold.'<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma at his word unclosed<BR>
The chest wherein its might reposed,<BR>
Thus crying, as he viewed it: 'Lo!<BR>
I lay mine hand upon the bow:<BR>
May happy luck my hope attend<BR>
Its heavenly strength to lift or bend.'<BR>
'Good luck be thine,' the hermit cried:<BR>
'Assay the task!' the king replied.<BR>
Then Raghu's son, as if in sport,<BR>
Before the thousands of the court,<BR>
The weapon by the middle raised<BR>
That all the crowd in wonder gazed.<BR>
With steady arm the string he drew<BR>
Till burst the mighty bow in two.<BR>
As snapped the bow, an awful clang,<BR>
Loud as the shriek of tempests, rang.<BR>
The earth, affrighted, shook amain<BR>
As when a hill is rent in twain.<BR>
Then, senseless at the fearful sound,<BR>
The people fell upon the ground:<BR>
None save the king, the princely pair,<BR>
And the great saint, the shock could bear,<BR>

<P>
When woke to sense the stricken train,<BR>
And Janak's soul was calm again,<BR>
With suppliant hands and reverent head,<BR>
These words, most eloquent, he said:<BR>
'O Saint, Prince R&aacute;ma stands alone:<BR>
His peerless might he well has shown.<BR>
A marvel has the hero wrought<BR>
Beyond belief, surpassing thought.<BR>
My child, to royal R&aacute;ma wed,<BR>
New glory on our line will shed:<BR>
And true my promise will remain<BR>
That hero's worth the bride should gain.<BR>
Dearer to me than light and life,<BR>
My Sit&aacute; shall be R&aacute;ma's wife.<BR>
If thou, O Br&aacute;hman, leave concede,<BR>
My counsellors, with eager speed,<BR>
Borne in their flying cars, to fair<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;'s town the news shall bear,<BR>
With courteous message to entreat<BR>
The king to grace my royal seat.<BR>
This to the monarch shall they tell,<BR>
The bride is his who won her well:<BR>
And his two sons are resting here<BR>
Protected by the holy seer.<BR>
So, at his pleasure, let them lead<BR>
The sovereign to my town with speed.'<BR>

<P>
The hermit to his prayer inclined<BR>
And Janak, lord of virtuous mind,<BR>
With charges, to Ayodhy&aacute; sent<BR>
His ministers: and forth they went.<BR>
