<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, peerless in the skill<BR>
That marks each sign of good and ill,<BR>
Strained his dear brother to his breast,<BR>
And thus with prudent words addressed:<BR>
'Now, Lakshman, by the water's side<BR>
In fruitful groves the host divide,<BR>
That warriors of each woodland race<BR>
May keep their own appointed place.<BR>
Dire is the danger: loss of friends,<BR>
Of V&aacute;nars and of bears, impends.<BR>
Distained with dust the breezes blow,<BR>
And earth is shaken from below.<BR>
The tall hills rock from foot to crown,<BR>
And stately trees come toppling down.<BR>
In threatening shape, with voice of fear,<BR>
The clouds like cannibals appear,<BR>
And rain in fitful torrents, red<BR>
With sanguinary drops, is shed.<BR>
Long streaks of lurid light invest<BR>
The evening skies from east to west.<BR>
And from the sun at times a ball<BR>
Of angry fire is seen to fall.<BR>
From every glen and brake is heard<BR>
The boding voice of beast and bird:<BR>
From den and lair night-prowlers run<BR>
And shriek against the falling sun.<BR>
Up springs the moon, but hot and red<BR>
Kills the sad night with woe and dread;<BR>
No gentle lustre, but the gloom.<BR>
That heralds universal doom.<BR>
A cloud of dust and vapour mars<BR>
The beauty of the evening stars,<BR>
And wild and fearful is the sky<BR>
As though the wreck of worlds were nigh.<BR>
Around our heads in boding flight<BR>
Wheel hawk and vulture, crow and kite;<BR>
And every bird of happy note<BR>
Shrieks terror from his altered throat.<BR>
Sword, spear and shaft shall strew the plain<BR>
Dyed red with torrents of the slain.<BR>
To-day the V&aacute;nar troops shall close<BR>
Around the city of our foes.'<BR>
