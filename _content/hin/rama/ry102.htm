<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXIV.: KAUS'ALY&Aacute; CALMED.</H3>
<P>
But when Kaus'aly&aacute; saw that he<BR>
Resolved to keep his sire's decree,<BR>
While tears and sobs her utterance broke,<BR>
Her very righteous speech she spoke:<BR>
'Can he, a stranger yet to pain,<BR>
Whose pleasant words all hearts enchain,<BR>
Son of the king and me the queen,<BR>
Live on the grain his hands may glean;<BR>
Can he, whose slaves and menials eat<BR>
The finest cakes of sifted wheat--<BR>
Can R&aacute;ma in the forest live<BR>
On roots and fruit which woodlands give<BR>
Who will believe, who will not fear<BR>
When the sad story smites his ear,<BR>
That one so dear, so noble held,<BR>
Is by the king his sire expelled?<BR>
Now surely none may Fate resist,<BR>
Which orders all as it may list,<BR>
If, R&aacute;ma, in thy strength and grace,<BR>
The woods become thy dwelling-place.<BR>
A childless mother long I grieved,<BR>
And many a sigh for offspring heaved,<BR>
With wistful longing weak and worn<BR>
Till thou at last, my son, wast born.<BR>
Fanned by the storm of that desire<BR>
Deep in my soul I felt the fire,<BR>
Whose offerings flowed from weeping eyes,<BR>
With fuel fed of groans and sighs,<BR>

<P>

<P>
While round the flame the smoke grew hot<BR>
Of tears because thou earnest not.<BR>
Now reft of thee, too fiery fierce<BR>
The flame of woe my heart will pierce,<BR>
As, when the days of spring return,<BR>
The sun's hot beams the forest burn.<BR>
The mother cow still follows near<BR>
The wanderings of her youngling dear.<BR>
So close to thine my feet shall be,<BR>
Where'er thou goest following thee.'<BR>

<P>
R&aacute;ma, the noblest lord of men,<BR>
Heard his fond mother's speech, and then<BR>
In soothing words like these replied<BR>
To the sad queen who wept and sighed:<BR>
'Nay, by Kaikey&iacute;'s art beguiled,<BR>
When I am banished to the wild,<BR>
If thou, my mother, also fly,<BR>
The aged king will surely die.<BR>
When wedded dames their lords forsake,<BR>
Long for the crime their souls shall ache.<BR>
Thou must not e'en in thought within<BR>
Thy bosom frame so dire a sin.<BR>
Long as Kakutstha's son, who reigns<BR>
Lord of the earth, in life remains,<BR>
Thou must with love his will obey:<BR>
This duty claims, supreme for aye.<BR>
Yes, mother, thou and I must be<BR>
Submissive to my sire's decree,<BR>
King, husband, sire is he confessed,<BR>
The lord of all, the worthiest.<BR>
I in the wilds my days will spend<BR>
Till twice seven years have reached an end,<BR>
Then with great joy will come again,<BR>
And faithful to thy hests remain.'<BR>

<P>
Kaus'aly&aacute; by her son addressed,<BR>
With love and passion sore distressed,<BR>
Afflicted, with her eyes bedewed,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma thus her speech renewed:<BR>

<P>
'Nay, R&aacute;ma, but my heart will break<BR>
If with these queens my home I make.<BR>
Lead me too with thee; let me go<BR>
And wander like a woodland roe.'<BR>

<P>
Then, while no tear the hero shed.<BR>
Thus to the weeping queen he said:<BR>
'Mother, while lives the husband, he<BR>
Is woman's lord and deity.<BR>
O dearest lady, thou and I<BR>
Our lord and king must ne'er deny;<BR>
The lord of earth himself have we<BR>
Our guardian wise and friend to be.<BR>
And Bharat, true to duty's call,<BR>
Whose sweet words take the hearts of all,<BR>
Will serve thee well, and ne'er forget<BR>
The virtuous path before him set.<BR>
Be this, I pray, thine earnest care,<BR>
That the old king my father ne'er,<BR>
When I have parted hence, may know,<BR>
Grieved for his son, a pang of woe.<BR>
Let not this grief his soul distress,<BR>
To kill him with the bitterness.<BR>
With duteous care, in every thing,<BR>
Love, comfort, cheer the aged king.<BR>
Though, best of womankind, a spouse<BR>
Keeps firmly all her fasts and vows,<BR>
Nor yet her husband's will obeys, '<BR>
She treads in sin's forbidden ways.<BR>
She to her husband's will who bends,<BR>
Goes to high bliss that never ends,<BR>
Yea, though the Gods have found in her<BR>
No reverential worshipper.<BR>
Bent on his weal, a woman still<BR>
Must seek to do her husband's will:<BR>
For Scripture, custom, law uphold<BR>
This duty Heaven revealed of old.<BR>
Honour true Br&aacute;hmans for my sake,<BR>
And constant offerings duly make,<BR>
With fire-oblations and with flowers,<BR>
To all the host of heavenly powers.<BR>
Look to the coming time, and yearn<BR>
For the glad hour of my return.<BR>
And still thy duteous course pursue,<BR>
Abstemious, humble, kind, and true.<BR>
The highest bliss shall thou obtain<BR>
When I from exile come again,<BR>
If, best of those who keep the right,<BR>
The king my sire still see the light.'<BR>

<P>
The queen, by R&aacute;ma thus addressed,<BR>
Still with a mother's grief oppressed,<BR>
While her long eyes with tears were dim,<BR>
Began once more and answered him:<BR>
'Not by my pleading maybe stayed<BR>
The firm resolve thy soul has made.<BR>
My hero, thou wilt go; and none<BR>
The stern commands of Fate may shun.<BR>
Go forth, dear child whom naught can bend<BR>
And may all bliss thy steps attend.<BR>
Thou wilt return, and that dear day<BR>
Will chase mine every grief away.<BR>
Thou wilt return, thy duty done,<BR>
Thy vows discharged, high glory won;<BR>
From filial debt wilt thou be free,<BR>
And sweetest joy will come on me.<BR>
My son, the will of mighty Fate<BR>
At every time must dominate,<BR>
If now it drives thee hence to stray<BR>
Heedless of me who bid thee stay.<BR>
Go, strong of arm, go forth, my boy,<BR>
Go forth, again to come with joy,<BR>
And thine expectant mother cheer<BR>
With those sweet tones she loves to hear.<BR>
O that the blessed hour were nigh<BR>
When thou shalt glad this anxious eye,<BR>
With matted hair and hermit dress<BR>
returning from the wilderness.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kaus'aly&aacute;'s conscious soul approved,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    As her proud glance she bent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  On R&aacute;ma constant and unmoved,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Resolved on banishment.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Such words, with happy omens fraught<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To her dear son she said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Invoking with each eager thought<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A blessing on his head.<BR>
