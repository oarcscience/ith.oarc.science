<P>
Thus charged, O slayer of thy foes,<BR>
The cow from whom all plenty flows,<BR>
Obedient to her saintly lord,<BR>
Viands to suit each taste, outpoured.<BR>
Honey she gave, and roasted grain,<BR>
Mead sweet with flowers, and sugar-cane.<BR>
Each beverage of flavour rare,<BR>
And food of every sort, were there:<BR>
Hills of hot rice, and sweetened cakes,<BR>
And curdled milk and soup in lakes.<BR>
Vast beakers foaming to the brim<BR>
With sugared drink prepared for him,<BR>
And dainty sweetmeats, deftly made,<BR>
Before the hermit's guests were laid.<BR>
So well regaled, so nobly fed,<BR>
The mighty army banqueted,<BR>
And all the train, from chief to least,<BR>
Delighted in Vas'ishtha's feast.<BR>
Then Vis'v&aacute;mitra, royal sage,<BR>
Surrounded by his vassalage,<BR>
Prince, peer, and counsellor, and all<BR>
From highest lord to lowest thrall,<BR>
Thus feasted, to Vas'ishtha cried<BR>
With joy, supremely gratified:<BR>
'Richh honour I, thus entertained,<BR>
Most honourable lord, have gained:<BR>
Now hear, before I journey hence,<BR>
My words, O skilled in eloquence.<BR>
Bought for a hundred thousand kine,<BR>
Let Dapple-skin. O Saint, be mine.<BR>
A wondrous jewel is thy cow,<BR>
And gems are for the monarch's brow.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
To me her rightful lord resign<BR>
This Dapple-skin thou callest thine.'<BR>

<P>
The great Vas'ishtha, thus addressed,<BR>
Arch-hermit of the holy breast,<BR>
To Vis'vamitra answer made,<BR>
The king whom all the land obeyed:<BR>
Not for a hundred thousand,--nay,<BR>
Not if ten million thou wouldst pay,<BR>
With silver heaps the price to swell,--<BR>
Will I my cow, O Monarch, sell.<BR>
Unmeet for her is such a fate.<BR>
That I my friend should alienate.<BR>
As glory with the virtuous, she<BR>
For ever makes her home with me.<BR>
On her mine offerings which ascend<BR>
To Gods and spirits all depend:<BR>
My very life is due to her,<BR>
My guardian, friend, and minister.<BR>

The feeding of the sacred flame,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The dole which living creatures claim.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The mighty sacrifice by fire,<BR>
Each formula the rites require,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
And various saving lore beside,<BR>
Are by her aid, in sooth, supplied.<BR>
The banquet which thy host has shared,<BR>
Believe it, was by her prepared.<BR>
In her mine only treasures lie,<BR>
She cheers mine heart and charms mine eye.<BR>
And reasons more could I assign<BR>
Why Dapple-skin can ne'er be thine.'<BR>

<P>
The royal sage, his suit denied,<BR>
With eloquence more earnest cried:<BR>
'Tusked elephants, a goodly train,<BR>
Each with a golden girth and chain.<BR>
Whose goads with gold well fashioned shine--<BR>
Of these be twice seven thousand thine.<BR>
And four-horse cars with gold made bright,<BR>
With steeds most beautifully white,<BR>
Whose bells make music as they go,<BR>
Eight hundred, Saint, will I bestow.<BR>
Eleven thousand mettled steeds<BR>
From famous lands, of noble breeds--<BR>
These will I gladly give, O thou<BR>
Devoted to each holy vow.<BR>
Ten million heifers, fair to view,<BR>
Whose sides are marked with every hue--<BR>
These in exchange will I assign;<BR>
But let thy Dapple-skin be mine.<BR>
Ask what thou wilt, and piles untold<BR>
Of priceless gems and gleaming gold,<BR>
O best of Br&aacute;hmans, shall be thine;<BR>
But let thy Dapple-skin be mine.'<BR>

<P>
The great Vas'ishtha, thus addressed.<BR>
Made answer to the king's request:<BR>
'Ne'er will I give my cow away,<BR>
My gem, my wealth, my life and stay.<BR>
My worship at the moon's first show,<BR>
And at the full, to her I owe;<BR>
And sacrifices small and great,<BR>
Which largess due and gifts await.<BR>
From her alone, their root, O King,<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>


<P>
My rites and holy service spring.<BR>
What boots it further words to say?<BR>
I will not give my cow away<BR>
Who yields me what I ask each day.'<BR>
