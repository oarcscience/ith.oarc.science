<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIV.: R&Aacute;VAN DOOMED.</H3>
<P>
The saint, well read in holy lore,<BR>
Pondered awhile his answer o'er.<BR>
And thus again addressed the king,<BR>
His wandering thoughts regathering:<BR>
'Another rite will I begin<BR>
Which shall the sons thou cravest win,<BR>
Where all things shall be duly sped<BR>
And first Atharva texts be read.'<BR>

<P>
Then by Vibh&aacute;ndak's gentle son<BR>
Was that high sacrifice begun,<BR>
The king's advantage seeking still<BR>
And zealous to perform his will.<BR>
Now all the Gods had gathered there,<BR>
Each one for his allotted share:<BR>
Brahm&aacute;, the ruler of the sky,<BR>
Sthanu, N&aacute;r&aacute;yan, Lord most high<BR>
And holy Indra men might view<BR>
With Maruts &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> for his retinue;<BR>
The heavenly chorister, and saint,<BR>
And spirit pure from earthly taint,<BR>
With one accord had sought the place<BR>
The high-souled monarch's rite to grace.<BR>
Then to the Gods who came to take<BR>
Their proper share the hermit spake:<BR>
'For you has Das'aratha slain<BR>
The votive steed, a son to gain;<BR>
Stern penance-rites the king has tried,<BR>
And in firm faith on you relied,<BR>


<P>


<P>
And now with undiminished care<BR>
A second rite would fain prepare.<BR>
But, O ye Gods, consent to grant<BR>
The longing of your supplicant.<BR>
For him beseeching hands I lift,<BR>
And pray you all to grant the gift,<BR>
That four fair sons of high renown<BR>
The offerings of the king may crown.'<BR>
They to the hermit's son replied:<BR>
'His longing shall be gratified.<BR>
For, Br&aacute;hman, in most high degree<BR>
We love the king and honour thee.'<BR>

<P>
These words the Gods in answer said,<BR>
And vanished thence by Indra led.<BR>
Thus to the Lord, the worlds who made,<BR>
The Immortals all assembled prayed:<BR>
'O Brahm&aacute;, mighty by thy grace,<BR>
R&aacute;van, who rules the giant race,<BR>
Torments us in his senseless pride,<BR>
And penance-loving saints beside.<BR>
For thou well pleased in days of old<BR>
Gavest the boon that makes him bold,<BR>
That God nor demon e'er should kill<BR>
His charmed life, for so thy will.<BR>
We, honouring that high behest,<BR>
Bear all his rage though sore distressed.<BR>
That lord of giants fierce and fell<BR>
Scourges the earth and heaven and hell.<BR>
Mad with thy boon, his impious rage<BR>
Smites saint and bard and God and sage.<BR>
The sun himself withholds his glow.<BR>
The wind in fear forbears to blow;<BR>
The fire restrains his wonted heat<BR>
Where stand the dreaded R&aacute;van's feet,<BR>
And, necklaced with the wandering ware,<BR>
The sea before him fears to rave.<BR>
Kuvera's self in sad defeat<BR>
Is driven from his blissful seat.<BR>
We see, we feel the giant's might.<BR>
And woe comes o'er us and affright.<BR>
Tc thee, O Lord, thy suppliants pray<BR>
To find some cure this plague to stay.'<BR>

<P>
Thus by the gathered Gods addressed<BR>
He pondered in his secret breast,<BR>
And said: 'One only way I find<BR>
To slay this fiend of evil mind.<BR>
He prayed me once his life to guard<BR>
From demon, God, and heavenly bard,<BR>
And spirits of the earth and air,<BR>
And I consenting heard his prayer.<BR>
But the proud giant in Inn scorn<BR>
Recked not of man of woman born.<BR>
None else may take his life away,<BR>
But only man the fiend may slay.'<BR>
The Gods, with Indra at their head,<BR>
Rejoiced to hear the words he said.<BR>
Then crowned with glory like a flame,<BR>
Lord Vishnu to the council came;<BR>
His hands shell, mace, and discus bore,<BR>
Aud saffron were the robes he wore.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Riding his eagle through the crowd,<BR>
As the sun rides upon a cloud,<BR>
With bracelets of fine gold, he came<BR>
Loud welcomed by the Gods' acclaim.<BR>
His praise they sang with one consent,<BR>
And cried, in lowly reverence bent:<BR>
'O Lord whose hand fierce Madhu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> slew,<BR>
Be thou our refuge, firm and true;<BR>
Friend of the suffering worlds art thou,<BR>
We pray thee help thy suppliants now.'<BR>
Then Vishnu spake: 'Ye Gods, declare,<BR>
What may I do to grant your prayer?'<BR>

<P>
'King Das'aratha,' thus cried they,<BR>
'Fervent in penance many a day,<BR>
The sacrificial steed has slain,<BR>
Longing for sons, but all in vain.<BR>
Now, at the cry of us forlorn,<BR>
Incarnate as his seed be born.<BR>
Three queens has he: each lovely dame<BR>
Like Beauty, Modesty, or Fame.<BR>
Divide thyself in four, and be<BR>
His offspring by these noble three.<BR>
Man's nature take, and slay in fight<BR>
R&aacute;van who laughs at heavenly might:<BR>
This common scourge, this rankling thorn<BR>
Whom the three worlds too long have borne.<BR>
For R&aacute;van in the senseless pride<BR>
Of might unequalled has defied<BR>
The host of heaven, and plagues with woe<BR>
Angel and bard and saint below,<BR>
Crushing each spirit and each maid<BR>
Who plays in Nandan's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> heavenly shade.<BR>
O conquering Lord, to thee we bow;<BR>
Our surest hope and trust art thou.<BR>
Regard the world of men below,<BR>
And slay the Gods' tremendous foe.'<BR>

<P>
When thus the suppliant Gods had prayed,<BR>
His wise reply N&aacute;rayan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> made:<BR>
'What task demands my presence there,<BR>
And whence this dread, ye Gods declare.'<BR>

<P>
The Gods replied: 'We fear, O Lord,<BR>
Fierce R&aacute;van, ravener abhorred.<BR>
Be thine the glorious task, we pray,<BR>
In human form this fiend to slay.<BR>
By thee of all the Blest alone<BR>
This sinner may be overthrown.<BR>
He gained by penance long and dire<BR>
The favour of the mighty Sire.<BR>
Then He who every gift bestows<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>


<P>
Guarded the fiend from heavenly foes,<BR>
And gave a pledge his life that kept<BR>
From all things living, man except.<BR>
On him thus armed no other foe<BR>
Than man may deal the deadly blow.<BR>
Assume, O King, a mortal birth,<BR>
And strike the demon to the earth.'<BR>

<P>
Then Vishnu, God of Gods, the Lord<BR>
Supreme by all the worlds adored,<BR>
To Brahm&aacute; and the suppliants spake:<BR>
'Dismiss your fear: for your dear sake<BR>
In battle will I smite him dead,<BR>
The cruel fiend, the Immortal's dread,<BR>
And lords and ministers and all<BR>
His kith and kin with him shall fall.<BR>
Then, in the world of mortal men,<BR>
Ten thousand years and hundreds ten<BR>
I as a human king will reign,<BR>
And guard the earth as my domain.'<BR>

<P>
God, saint, aud nymph, and ministrel throng<BR>
With heavenly voices raised their song<BR>
In hymns of triumph to the God<BR>
Whose conquering feet on Madhu trod:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Champion of Gods, as man appear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    This cruel R&aacute;van slay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The thorn that saints and hermits fear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The plague that none can stay.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In savage fury uncontrolled<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His pride for ever grows:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He dares the Lord of Gods to hold<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Among his deadly foes.'<BR>
