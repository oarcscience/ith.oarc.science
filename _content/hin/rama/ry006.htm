<P>
When to the end the tale was brought,<BR>
Rose in the sage's mind the thought;<BR>
Now who throughout this earth will go,<BR>
And tell it forth that all may know?'<BR>

<P>
As thus he mused with anxious breast,<BR>
Behold, in hermit's raiment dressed,<BR>
Kus'a and Lava &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> came to greet<BR>
Their master and embrace his feet.<BR>
The twins he saw, that princely pair<BR>
Sweet-voiced, who dwelt beside him there<BR>
None for the task could be more fit,<BR>
For skilled were they in Holy Writ;<BR>
And so the great R&aacute;m&aacute;yan, fraught<BR>
With lore divine, to them he taught:<BR>
The lay whose verses sweet and clear<BR>
Take with delight the listening ear,<BR>
That tell of S&iacute;t&aacute;'s noble life<BR>
And R&aacute;van's fall in battle strife.<BR>
Great joy to all who hear they bring,<BR>
Sweet to recite and sweet to sing.<BR>
For music's sevenfold notes are there,<BR>
And triple measure, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> wrought with care<BR>
With melody and tone and time,<BR>
And flavours &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> that enhance the rime:<BR>
Heroic might has ample place,<BR>
And loathing of the false and base,<BR>
With anger, mirth, and terror, blent<BR>
With tenderness, surprise, content.<BR>
When, half the hermit's grace to gain,<BR>
And half because they loved the strain,<BR>
The youth within their hearts had stored<BR>
The poem that his lips outpoured,<BR>
V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki kissed them on the head,<BR>
As at his feet they bowed, and said<BR>
'Recite ye this heroic song<BR>
In tranquil shades where sages throng<BR>
Recite it where the good resort,<BR>
In lowly home and royal court,'<BR>
The hermit ceased. The tuneful pair<BR>
Like heavenly minstrels sweet and fair<BR>
In music's art divinely skilled,<BR>
Their saintly master's word fulfilled.<BR>
Like R&aacute;ma's self, from whom they came,<BR>
They shared their size in face and frame,<BR>

As though from some fair sculptured stone<BR>
Two selfsame images had grown.<BR>
Sometimes the pair rose up to sing,<BR>
Surrounded by a holy ring,<BR>
Where seated on the grass bad met<BR>
Full many a musing anchoret.<BR>
Then tears bedimmed those gentle eyes,<BR>
As transport took them and surprise,<BR>
And as they listened every one<BR>
Cried in delight, Well done! Well done!<BR>
Those sages versed in holy lore<BR>
Praised the sweet minstrels more and more:<BR>
And wondered at the singers' skill,<BR>
And the bard's verses sweeter still,<BR>
Which laid so clear before the eye<BR>
The glorious deeds of days gone by.<BR>
Thus by the virtuous hermits praised,<BR>
Inspirited their voice they raised.<BR>
Pleased with the song this holy man<BR>
Would give the youths a water-can;<BR>
One gave a fair ascetic dress,<BR>
Or sweet fruit from the wilderness.<BR>
One saint a black-deer's hide would bring,<BR>
And one a sacrificial string:<BR>
One, a clay pitcher from his hoard,<BR>
And one, a twisted munja cord. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
One in his joy an axe would find,<BR>
One, braid, their plaited locks to bind.<BR>
One gave a sacrificial cup,<BR>
One rope to tie their fagots up;<BR>
While fuel at their feet was laid,<BR>
Or hermit's stool of fig-tree made.<BR>
All gave, or if they gave not, none<BR>
Forgot at least a benison.<BR>
Some saints, delighted with their lays,<BR>
Would promise health and length of days;<BR>
Others with surest words would add<BR>
Some boon to make their spirit glad.<BR>
In such degree of honour then<BR>
That song was held by holy men:<BR>
That living song which life can give,<BR>
By which shall many a minstrel live.<BR>
In seat of kings, in crowded hall,<BR>
They sang the poem, praised of all.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma chanced to hear their lay,<BR>
While he the votive steed &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> would slay,<BR>
And sent fit messengers to bring<BR>
The minstrel pair before the king.<BR>
They came, and found the monarch high<BR>
Enthroned in gold, his brothers nigh;<BR>
While many a minister below,<BR>
And noble, sate in lengthened row.<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>
The youthful pair awhile he viewed<BR>
Graceful in modest attitude,<BR>
And then in words like these addressed<BR>
His brother Lakshman and the rest:<BR>
'Come, listen to the wondrous strain<BR>
Recited by these godlike twain.<BR>
Sweet singers of a story fraught<BR>
With melody and lofty thought.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The pair, with voices sweet and strong,<BR>
Rolled the full tide of noble song,<BR>
With tone and accent deftly blent<BR>
To suit the changing argument.<BR>
Mid that assembly loud and clear<BR>
Rang forth that lay so sweet to hear,<BR>
That universal rapture stole<BR>
Through each man's frame and heart and soul.<BR>
'These minstrels, blest with every sign<BR>
That marks a high and princely line,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In holy shades who dwell,<BR>
Enshrined in Saint V&aacute;lmiki's lay,<BR>
A monument to live for aye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My deeds in song shall tell.'<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma spoke: their breasts were fired,<BR>
And the great tale, as if inspired,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The youths began to sing,<BR>
While every heart with transport swelled,<BR>
And mute and rapt attention held<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The concourse and the king,<BR>
