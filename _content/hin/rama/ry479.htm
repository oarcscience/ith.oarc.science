<P>
He spoke, and vanished: R&aacute;ma raised<BR>
His eyes with reverence meet, and praised<BR>
The glorious Day-God full in view:<BR>
Then armed him for the fight anew.<BR>
Urged onward by his charioteer<BR>
The giant's foaming steeds came near,<BR>
And furious was the battle's din<BR>
Where each resolved to die or win.<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas host and V&aacute;nar bands<BR>
Stood with their weapons in their hands,<BR>
And watched in terror and dismay<BR>
The fortune of the awful fray.<BR>
The giant chief with rage inflamed<BR>
His darts at R&aacute;ma's pennon aimed;<BR>
But when they touched the chariot made<BR>
By heavenly hands their force was stayed.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma's breast with fury swelled;<BR>
He strained the mighty bow he held.<BR>
And straight at R&aacute;van's banner flew<BR>
An arrow as the string he drew--<BR>
A deadly arrow swift of flight,<BR>
Like some huge snake ablaze with light,<BR>
Whose fury none might e'er repel,--<BR>
And, split in twain, the standard fell.<BR>
At R&aacute;ma's steeds sharp arrows, hot<BR>
With flames of fire, the giant shot.<BR>
Unmoved the heavenly steeds sustained<BR>
The furious shower the warrior rained,<BR>
As though soft lotus tendrils smote<BR>
Each haughty crest and glossy coat,<BR>
Then volleyed swift by magic art,<BR>
Tree, mountain peak and spear and dart,<BR>
Trident and pike and club and mace<BR>
Flew hurtling straight at R&aacute;ma's face.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma with his steeds and car<BR>
Escaped the storm which fell afar<BR>
Where the strange missiles, as they rushed<BR>
To earth, a thousand V&aacute;nars crushed.<BR>
