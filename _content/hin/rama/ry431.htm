<P>
Again her eyes with tears o'erflowed.<BR>
She gazed upon the head he showed.<BR>
Gazed on the bow so famed of yore,<BR>
The glorious bow which R&aacute;ma bore.<BR>
She gazed upon his cheek and brows,<BR>
The eyes of her beloved spouse;<BR>
His lips, the lustre of his hair,<BR>
The priceless gem that glittered there.<BR>
The features of her Lord she knew,<BR>
And, pierced with anguish at the view,<BR>
She lifted up her voice and cried:<BR>
&nbsp; "Kaikey, are thou satisfied?'<BR>
Now all thy longings are fulfilled;<BR>
The joy of Rughu's race is killed,<BR>
And ruined is the ancient line,<BR>
Destroyer, by that hand of thine.<BR>
Ah, what offense, O cruel dame,<BR>
What fault in R&aacute;ma couldst thou blame,<BR>
To drive him clad in hermit dress<BR>
With Sit&aacute; to the wilderness?'<BR>
&nbsp; Great trembling seized her frame, and she<BR>
Fell like a stricken plantain tree.<BR>
As **** the     *********    lays at length<BR>
Slowly regaining sense and strength,<BR>
On the dear head she ********   her eye<BR>

<P>
And cried with very bitter cry:<BR>
'Ah, when thy cold dead cheek I view,<BR>
My hero, I am murdered too.<BR>
Then first a faithful woman's eyes<BR>
See sorrow, when her husband dies.<BR>
When thou, my lord, wast nigh to save,<BR>
Some stealthy hand thy death wound gave.<BR>
Thou art not dead: rise, hero, rise;<BR>
Long life was thine, as spake the wise<BR>
Whose words, I ween, are ever true,<BR>
For faith lies open to their view.<BR>
Ah lord, and shall thy head recline<BR>
On earth's cold breast, forsaking mine,<BR>
Counting her chill lap dearer far<BR>
Than I and my caresses are?<BR>
Ah, is it thus these eyes behold<BR>
Thy famous bow adorned with gold,<BR>
Whereon of yore I loved to bind<BR>
Sweet garlands that my bands had twined?<BR>
And hast thou sought in heaven a place<BR>
Amid the founders of thy race,<BR>
Where in the home deserved so well<BR>
Thy sires and Das'aratha dwell?<BR>
Or dost thou shine a brighter star<BR>
In skies where blest immortals are,<BR>
Forsaking in thy lofty scorn<BR>
The race wherein thy sires were born?<BR>
Turn to my gaze. O turn thine eye:<BR>
Why are thy cold lips silent, why?<BR>
When first we met as youth and maid.<BR>
When in thy hand my hand was laid,<BR>
Thy promise was thy steps should be<BR>
Through life in duty's path with me.<BR>
Remember, faithful still, thy vow,<BR>
And take me with thee even now.<BR>
Is that broad bosom where I hung,<BR>
That neck to which I fondly clung,<BR>
Where flowery garlands breathed their scent<BR>
By hungry dogs and vultures rent?<BR>
Shall no funereal honours grace<BR>
The parted lord of Raghu's race,<BR>
Whose bounty liberal fees bestowed.<BR>
For whom the fires of worship glowed?<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; wild with grief will see<BR>
One sole survivor of the three<BR>
Who in their hermit garments went<BR>
To the dark woods in banishment.<BR>
Then at her cry shall Lakshman tell<BR>
How, slain by night, the V&aacute;nars fell;<BR>
How to thy side the giants crept,<BR>
And slew the hero as he slept.<BR>
Thy fate and mine the queen will know,<BR>
And broken-hearted die of woe.<BR>
For my unworthy sake, for mine,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, the glory of his line,<BR>
Who bridged his way across the main,<BR>
Is basely in a puddle slain;<BR>
And I, the graceless wife he wed,<BR>
Have brought this ruin on his head.<BR>
Me, too, on him, O R&aacute;van, slay:<BR>

<P>
The wife beside her husband lay.<BR>
By his dear body let me rest,<BR>
Cheek close to cheek and breast to breast,<BR>
My happy eyes I then will close.<BR>
And follow whither R&aacute;ma goes.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus cried the miserable dame;<BR>
When to the king a warder came,<BR>
Before the giant monarch bowed<BR>
And said that, followed by a crowd<BR>
Of counsellors and lords of state,<BR>
Prahasta stood before the gate,<BR>
And, sent by some engrossing care,<BR>
Craved audience of his master there.<BR>
The anxious tyrant left his seat<BR>
And hastened forth the chief to meet:<BR>
Then summoning his nobles all,<BR>
Took counsel in his regal hall.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Lank&aacute;'s lord had left the queen,<BR>
The head and bow no more were seen.<BR>
The giant king his nobles eyed,<BR>
And, terrible as Yama, cried:<BR>
'O faithful lords, the time is come:<BR>
Gather our hosts with beat of drum.<BR>
Nigh to the town our foeman draws:<BR>
Be prudent, nor reveal the cause.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The nobles listened and obeyed:<BR>
Swift were the gathered troops arrayed,<BR>
And countless rovers of the night<BR>
Stood burning for the hour of tight.<BR>
