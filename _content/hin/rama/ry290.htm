<P>
Thus T&aacute;r&aacute; with the starry eyes &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Her counsel gave with burning sighs.<BR>
But B&aacute;li, by her prayers unmoved,<BR>
Spurned her advice, and thus reproved:<BR>
'How may this insult, scathe, aud scorn<BR>
By me, dear love, be tamely born?<BR>
My brother, yea my foe, comes nigh<BR>
Aud dares me forth with shout and cry.<BR>
Learn, trembler! that the valiant, they<BR>
Who yield no step in battle fray,<BR>
Will die a thousand deaths but ne'er<BR>
An unavenged dishonour bear.<BR>
Nor, O my love, be thou dismayed<BR>
Though R&aacute;ma lend Sugr&iacute;va aid,<BR>
For one so pure and duteous, one<BR>
Who loves the right, all sin will shun,<BR>
Release me from thy soft embrace,<BR>
And with thy dames thy steps retrace:<BR>
Enough already, O mine own,<BR>
Of love and sweet devotion shown.<BR>
Drive all thy fear and doubt away;<BR>
I seek Sugr&iacute;va in the fray<BR>
His boisterous rage and pride to still,<BR>
And tame the foe I would not kill.<BR>
My fury, armed with brandished trees,<BR>
Shall strike Sugr&iacute;va to his knees:<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_343"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 343</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Nor shall the humbled foe withstand<BR>
The blows of my avenging hand,<BR>
When, nerved by rage and pride, I beat<BR>
The traitor down beneath my feet.<BR>
Thou, love, hast lent thine own sweet aid,<BR>
And all thy tender care displayed;<BR>
Now by my life, by these who yearn<BR>
To serve thee well, I pray thee turn.<BR>
But for a while, dear dame, I go<BR>
To come triumphant o'er the foe.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus B&aacute;h spake in gentlest tone:<BR>
Soft arms about his neck were thrown;<BR>
Then round her lord the lady went<BR>
With sad steps slow and reverent.<BR>
She stood in solemn guise to bless<BR>
With prayers for safety and success,<BR>
Then with her train her chamber sought<BR>
By grief and racking fear distraught.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With serpent's pantings fierce and fast<BR>
King B&aacute;li from the city passed.<BR>
His glance, as each quick breath he drew,<BR>
Around to find the foe he threw,<BR>
And saw where fierce Sugr&iacute;va showed<BR>
His form with golden hues that glowed,<BR>
And, as a fire resplendent, stayed<BR>
To meet his foe in arms arrayed.<BR>
When B&aacute;li, long-armed chieftain, found<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va stationed on the ground,<BR>
Impelled by warlike rage he braced<BR>
His warrior garb about his waist,<BR>
And with his mighty arm raised high<BR>
Rushed at Sugr&iacute;va with a cry.<BR>
But when Sugr&iacute;va, fierce and bold,<BR>
Saw B&aacute;li with his chain of gold.<BR>
His arm he heaved, his hand he closed,<BR>
And face to face his foe opposed.<BR>
To him whose eyes with fury shone,<BR>
In charge imtpetuous rushing on,<BR>
Skilled in each warlike art and plan,<BR>
B&aacute;li with hasty words began:<BR>
'My ponderous hood, to fight addressed.<BR>
With fingers clenched and arm compressed.<BR>
Shall on thy death doomed brow descend<BR>
And, crashing down, thy life shall end.'<BR>
He spoke; and wild with rage and pride,<BR>
The fierce Sagr&iacute;va thus replied:<BR>
'Thus let my arm begin the strife<BR>
And from thy body crush the life.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then B&aacute;li, wounded aud enraged,<BR>
With furious blows the battle waged.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va seemed, with blood-streams dyed,<BR>
A hill with fountains in his side.<BR>
But with his native force unspent<BR>
A S&aacute;l tree from the earth he rent,<BR>
And like the bolt of Indra smote<BR>
On B&aacute;li's head and chest and throat.<BR>
Bruised by the blows he could not shield,<BR>
Half vanquished B&aacute;li sank and reeled,<BR>
As sinks a vessel with her freight<BR>
Borne down by overwhelming weight.<BR>

<P>
Swift as Suparna's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="ry291.htm#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> swiftest flight<BR>
In awful strength they rushed to fight:<BR>
So might the sun and moon on high<BR>
Encountering battle in the sky.<BR>
Fierce and more fierce, as fought the foes,<BR>
The furious rage of combat rose.<BR>
They warred with feet and arms and knees,<BR>
With nails and stones and boughs and trees,<BR>
And blows descending fast as rain<BR>
Dyed each dark form with crimson stain,<BR>
While like two thunder-clouds they met<BR>
With battle-cry and shout and threat.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma saw Sugr&iacute;va quail,<BR>
Marked his worn strength grow weak and fail.<BR>
Saw how he turned his wistful eye<BR>
To every quarter of the sky.<BR>
His friend's defeat he could not brook.<BR>
Bent on his shaft an eager look,<BR>
Then burned to slay the conquering foe,<BR>
And laid his arrow on the bow.<BR>
As to an orb the bow he drew<BR>
Forth from the string the arrow flew<BR>
Like Fate's tremendous discus hurled<BR>
By Yama &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_584"></A><A HREF="ry291.htm#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> forth to end the world.<BR>
So loud the din that every bird<BR>
The bow-string's clans with terror heard,<BR>
And wildly fled the affrighted deer<BR>
As though the day of doom were near,<BR>
So, deadly as the serpent's fang,<BR>
Forth from the string the arrow sprang.<BR>
Like the red lightning's flash and flame<BR>
It flew unerring to its aim,<BR>
And, hissing murder through the air,<BR>
Pierced B&aacute;li's breast, and quivered there.<BR>
Struck by the shaft that flew so well<BR>
The mighty V&aacute;nar reeled and fell,<BR>
As earthward Indra's flag they pull<BR>
When As'v&iacute;n&iacute;'s fair moon is full &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="ry291.htm#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
