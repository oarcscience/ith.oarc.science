### CANTO LI.: DHÚMRÁKSHA'S SALLY.

King Rávan, where he sat within,  
Heard from his hall the deafening din,  
And with a spirit ill at ease  
Addressed his lords in words like these:  
   'That warlike shout, those joyous cries,  
Loud as the thunder of the skies,  
Upsent from every Vánar throat,  
Some new-born confidence denote.  
Hark, how the sea and trembling shore  
Re-echo with the Vánars' roar.  
Though arrowy chains, securely twined  
Both Ráma and his brother bind,  
Still must the fierce triumphant shout  
Disturb my soul with rising doubt.  
Swift envoys to the army send,  
And learn what change these cries portend,'  
   Obedient, at their master's call.  
Fleet giants clomb the circling wall.  
They saw the Vánars formed and led:  
They saw Sugríva at their head,  
The brothers from their bonds released:  
And hope grew faint and fear increased.  
Their faces pale with doubt and dread,  
Back to the giant king they sped,  
And to his startled ear revealed  
The tidings of the battle field.  
   The flush of rage a while gave place  
To chilling fear that changed his face:  
   'What? cried the tyrant, 'are my foes  
Freed from the binding snakes that close  
With venomed clasp round head and limb,  
Bright as the sun and fierce like him:  
The spell a God bestowed of yore,  
The spell that never failed before?  
If arts like these be useless, how  
Shall giant strength avail us now  
Go forth, Dhúmráksha, good at need,  
The bravest of my warriors lead:  
Force through the foe thy conquering way,  
And Ráma and the Vánars slay'  
   Before his king with reverence due  
Dhúmráksha bowed him, and withdrew.  
Around him at his summons came  
Fierce legions led by chiefs of fame.  
Well armed with sword and spear and mace,  
They hurried to the gathering place,  
And rushed to battle, borne at speed  
By elephant and car and steed.
