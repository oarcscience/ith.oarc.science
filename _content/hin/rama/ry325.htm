'Assailed by thirst and hunger, dame,<BR>
Within a gloomy vault we came.<BR>
We saw the cavern opening wide,<BR>
And straight within its depths we hied.<BR>
But utterly amazed are we<BR>
At all the marvels that we see.<BR>
Whose are the golden trees that gleam<BR>
With splendour like the morning's beam?<BR>
These cates of noblest sort? these roots?<BR>
This wondrous store of rarest fruits?<BR>
Whose are these calm and cool retreats,<BR>
These silver homes and golden seats,<BR>
And lattices of precious stones?<BR>
Who is the happy lord that owns<BR>
The golden trees, of rarest scent,<BR>
Neath loads of fruit and blossom bent?<BR>
Who, strong in holy zeal, had power<BR>
To deck the streams with richest dower,<BR>
And bade the lilies bright with gold<BR>
The glory of their blooms unfold,<BR>

<P>

<P>
Where fish in living gold below<BR>
The sheen of changing colours show?<BR>
Thine is the holy power, I ween,<BR>
That beautified the wondrous scene;<BR>
But if another's, lady, deign<BR>
To tell us, and the whole explain.'<BR>
To him the lady of the cave<BR>
In words like, these her answer gave:<BR>
'Skilled Maya framed in days of old<BR>
This magic wood of growing gold.<BR>
The chief artificer in place<BR>
Was he of all the D&aacute;nav.<BR>
He, for his wise enchantments famed,<BR>
This glorious dwelling planned and framed<BR>
He for a thousand years endured<BR>
The sternest penance, and secured<BR>
From Brahm&aacute; of all boons the best,<BR>
The knowledge Us'anas &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_754"></A><A HREF="#fn_754"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> possessed.<BR>
Lord, by that boon, of all his will,<BR>
He fashioned all with perfect skill;<BR>
And, with his blissful state content,<BR>
In this vast grove a season spent.<BR>
By Indra's jealous bolt he fell<BR>
For loving Hem&aacute;'s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_755"></A><A HREF="#fn_755"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> charms too well.<BR>
And Brahm&aacute; on that nymph bestowed<BR>
The treasures of this fair abode,<BR>
Wherein her tranquil days to spend<BR>
In happiness that ne'er may end.<BR>
Sprung of a lineage old and high,<BR>
Merus&aacute;varni's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_756"></A><A HREF="#fn_756"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> daughter, I<BR>
Guard ever for that heavenly dame<BR>
This home, Svayamprabh&aacute;t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_757"></A><A HREF="#fn_757"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A> my name,-<BR>
For I have loved the lady long,<BR>
So skilled in arts of dance and song.<BR>
But say what cause your steps has led<BR>
The mazes of this grove to tread.<BR>

How, strangers did ye chance to spy<BR>
The wood concealed from wanderer's eye?<BR>
Tell clearly why ye come: but first<BR>
Eat of this fruit and quench your thirst.'<BR>
