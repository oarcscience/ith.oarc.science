### CANTO XXVII.: SÍTÁ'S SPEECH.

His sweetly-speaking bride, who best  
Deserved her lord, he thus addressed.  
Then tender love bade passion wake,  
And thus the fair Videhan spake:  
'What words are these that thou hast said?  
Contempt of me the thought has bred.  
O best of heroes, I dismiss  
With bitter scorn a speech like this:  

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>  

Unworthy of a warrior's fame  
It taints a monarch's son with shame,  
Ne'er to be heard from those who know  
The science of the sword and bow.  
My lord, the mother, sire, and son,  
Receive their lots by merit won;  
The brother and the daughter find  
The portions to their deeds aligned.  
The wife alone, whate'er await,  
Must share on earth her husband's fate.  
So now the king's command which sends  
Thee to the wild, to me extends.  
The wife can find no refuge, none,  
In father, mother, self, or son:  
Both here, and when they vanish hence,  
Her husband is her sole defence.  
If, Raghu's son, thy steps are led  
Where Dandak's pathless wilds are spread,  
My foot before thine own shall pass  
Through tangled thorn and matted grass.  
Dismiss thine anger and thy doubt:  
Like refuse water cast them out,  
And lead me, O my hero, hence--  
I know not sin--with confidence.  
Whate'er his lot,'tis far more sweet  
To follow still a husband's feet  
Than in rich palaces to lie,  
Or roam at pleasure through the sky.  
My mother and my sire have taught  
What duty bids, and trained each thought,  
Nor have I now mine ear to turn  
The duties of a wife to learn,  
I'll seek with thee the woodland dell  
And pathless wild where no men dwell,  
Where tribes of silvan creatures roam,  
And many a tiger makes his home.  
My life shall pass as pleasant there  
As in my father's palace fair.  
The worlds shall wake no care in me;  
My only care be truth to thee.  
There while thy wish I still obey,  
True to my vows with thee I'll stray,  
And there shall blissful hours be spent  
In woods with honey redolent.  
In forest shades thy mighty arm  
Would keep a stranger's life from harm,  
And how shall Sitá think of fear  
When thou, O glorious lord, art near?  
Heir of high bliss, my choice is made,  
Nor can I from my will be stayed.  
Doubt not; the earth will yield me roots,  
These will I eat, and woodland fruits;  
And as with thee I wander there  
I will not bring thee grief or care.  
I long, when thou, wise lord, art nigh,  
All fearless, with delighted eye  
To gaze upon the rocky hill,  
The lake, the fountain, and the hill;  
To sport with thee, my limbs to cool,  
In some pure lily-covered pool,  
While the white swan's and mallard's wings  

Are plashing in the water-springs.  
So would a thousand seasons flee  
Like one sweet day, if spent with thee.  
Without my lord I would not prize  
A home with Gods above the skies:  
Without my lord, my life to bless,  
Where could be heaven or happiness?  
   Forbid me not: with thee I go  
     The tangled wood to tread.  
   There will I live with thee, as though  
     This roof were o'er my head.  
   My will for thine shall be resigned;  
     Thy feet my steps shall guide.  
   Thou, only thou, art in my mind:  
     I heed not all beside.  
   Thy heart shall ne'er by me be grieved;  
     Do not my prayer deny:  
   Take me, dear lord; of thee bereaved  
     Thy Sitá swears to die.'  
   These words the duteous lady spake,  
     Nor would he yet consent  
   His faithful wife with him to take  
     To share his banishment.  
   He soothed her with his gentle speech;  
     To change her will he strove:  
   And much he said the woes to teach  
     Of those in wilds who rove.
