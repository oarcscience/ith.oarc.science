<P><A NAME="fn_0"></A><A HREF="ry001.htm#fr_0">1:1</A>  The MSS. vary very considerably in these
stanzas of invocation: many lines are
generally prefixed in which not only the
poet, but those who play the chief parts in
the poem are panegyrized. It is self-apparent
that they are not by the author
of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan himself.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1"></A><A HREF="ry001.htm#fr_1">1:2</A>  'V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki was the son of Varuna, the
regent of the waters, one of whose names
is Prachetas. According to the <I>Adhy&aacute;tm&aacute;
R&aacute;m&aacute;yana</I>, the sage, although a Br&aacute;hman
by birth, associated with foresters and
robbers. Attacking on one occasion the
seven Rishis, they expostulated with him
successfully, and taught him the <I>mantra</I>
of R&aacute;ma reversed, or <I>Mar&aacute;</I>, <I>Mar&aacute;</I>, in the
inaudible repetition of which he remained
immovable for thousands of years, so that
when the sages returned to the same spot
they found him still there, converted into
a <I>valmik</I> or ant-hill, by the nests of the
termites, whence his name of V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki.'

'V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki is said to have lived a solitary
life in the woods: he is called both a <I>muni</I>
and a <I>rishi</I>. The former word properly
signifies an anchorite or hermit; the latter
has reference chiefly to wisdom. The two
words are frequently used promiscuously,
and may both be rendered by the Latin
<I>cates</I> in its earliest meaning of <I>seer</I>:
V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki was both poet and seer, as he is
said to have sung the exploits of R&aacute;ma by
the aid of divining insight rather than of
knowledge naturally acquired.' SCHLEGEL.</P>

Cuckoo. Schlegel translates 'luscinium.'</P>
