<P>
Then Vis'v&aacute;mitra, when the Blest<BR>
Had sought their homes of heavenly rest,<BR>
Thus, mighty Prince, his counsel laid<BR>
Before the dwellers of the shade:<BR>
'The southern land where now we are<BR>
Offers this check our rites to bar:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
To other regions let us speed,<BR>
And ply our tasks from trouble freed.<BR>
Now turn we to the distant west.<BR>
To Pushkar's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> wood where hermits rest,<BR>
And there to rites austere apply,<BR>
For not a grove with that can vie.'<BR>

<P>
The saint, in glory's light arrayed,<BR>
In Pushkar's wood his dwelling made,<BR>
And living there on roots and fruit<BR>
Did penance stern and resolute.<BR>

<P>
The king who filled Ayodhy&aacute;'s throne,<BR>
By Ambar&iacute;sha's name far known,<BR>
At that same time, it chanced, began<BR>
A sacrificial rite to plan.<BR>
But Indra took by force away<BR>
The charger that the king would slay.<BR>
The victim lost, the Br&aacute;hman sped<BR>
To Ambar&iacute;sha's side, and said:<BR>
'Gone is the steed, O King, and this<BR>
Is due to thee, in care remiss.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Such heedless faults will kings destroy<BR>
Who fail to guard what they enjoy.<BR>
The flaw is desperate: we need<BR>
The charger, or a man to bleed.<BR>
Quick! bring a man if not the horse,<BR>
That so the rite may have its course.'<BR>

<P>
The glory of Ikshv&aacute;ku's line<BR>
Made offer of a thousand kine,<BR>
And sought to buy at lordly price<BR>
A victim for the sacrifice.<BR>
To many a distant land he drove,<BR>
To many a people, town, and grove,<BR>
And holy shades where hermits rest,<BR>
Pursuing still his eager quest.<BR>
At length on Bhrigu's sacred height<BR>
The saint Richika met his sight<BR>
Sitting beneath the holy boughs.<BR>
His children near him, and his spouse.<BR>

<P>
The mighty lord drew near, assayed<BR>
To win his grace, and reverence paid;<BR>
And then the sainted king addressed<BR>
The Br&aacute;hman saint with this request:<BR>
'Bought with a hundred thousand kine,<BR>
Give me, O Sage, a son of thine<BR>
To be a victim in the rite,<BR>
And thanks the favour shall requite.<BR>
For I have roamed all countries round,<BR>
Nor sacrificial victim found.<BR>
Then, gentle Hermit, deign to spare<BR>
One child amid the number there.'<BR>

<P>
Then to the monarch's speech replied<BR>
The hermit, penance-glorified:<BR>
'For countless kine, for hills of gold,<BR>
Mine eldest son shall ne'er be sold.'<BR>
But, when she heard the saint's reply,<BR>
The children's mother, standing nigh,<BR>
Words such as these in answer said<BR>
To Ambarisha, monarch dread:<BR>
'My lord, the saint, has spoken well:<BR>
His eldest child he will not sell.<BR>
And know, great Monarch, that above<BR>
Tht rest my youngest born I love.<BR>
'Tis ever thus: the father's joy<BR>
Is centred in his eldest boy.<BR>
The mother loves her darling best<BR>
Whom last she reeked upon her breast:<BR>
My youngest I will ne'er forsake.'<BR>

<P>
As thus the sire and mother spake,<BR>
Young S'unahs'epha, of the three<BR>
The midmost, cried unurged and free:<BR>
'My sire withholds his eldest son,<BR>
My mother keeps her youngest one:<BR>
Then take me with thee, King: I ween<BR>
The son is sold who comes between.'<BR>
The king with joy his home resought,<BR>
And took the prize his kine had bought.<BR>
He bade the youth his car ascend,<BR>
And hastened back the rites to end.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_240"></A><A HREF="ry061.htm#fr_240">72:1b</A>  'This cannot refer to the events just
related: for Vis'v&aacute;mitra was successful in
the sacrifice performed for Tris'anku. And
yet no other impediment is mentioned.
Still his restless mind would not allow
him to remain longer in the same spot.
So the character of Vis'v&aacute;mitra is ingeniously
and skilfully shadowed forth: as he
had been formerly a most warlike king,
loving battle and glory, bold, active,
sometimes unjust, and more frequently
magnanimous, such also he always shows
himself in his character of anchorite and
ascetic.' SCHLEGEL.</P>

place is sacred still, and the name is preserved
in the Hind&iacute;. Lassen, however, says
that this Pushkala or Pushkara, called
by the Grecian writers &#0928&#0949&#0965&#0954&#0949&#0955&#7936&#0943&#0964&#0953&#0962, the
earliest place of pilgrimage mentioned by
name, is not to be confounded with the
modern Pushkara in Ajmere.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_242"></A><A HREF="ry061.htm#fr_242">73:1</A>  Ambarisha is the twenty-ninth in
descent from Ikshv&aacute;ku, and is therefore
separated by an immense space of time
from Tris'anku in whose story Vis'v&aacute;mitra
had played so important a part. Yet
Rich&iacute;ka, who is represented as having
young sons while Ambar&iacute;sha was yet reigning,
being himself the son of Bhrigu and
to be numbered with the most ancient
sages, is said to have married the younger
sister of Vis'v&aacute;mitra. But I need not again
remark that there is a perpetual anachronism
in Indian mythology.' SCHLEGEL.

<P>
'In the mythical story related in this
and the following Canto we may discover,
I think, some indication of the epoch at
which the immolation of lower animals
was substituted for human sacrifice....

<P>
So when Iphigenia was about to be sacrificed
at Aulis, one legend tells us that a
hind was substituted for the virgin.'

So the ram caught in the thicket took
the place of Isaac, or, as the Musalm&aacute;ns
say, of Ishmael.</P>
