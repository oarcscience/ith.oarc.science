<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CXX.: S&Iacute;T&Aacute; RESTORED.</H3>
<P>
Thus spoke the Self-existent Sire:<BR>
Then swiftly from the blazing pyre<BR>
The circling flames were backward rolled,<BR>
And, raising in his gentle hold<BR>
Alive unharmed the Maithil dame,<BR>
The Lord of Fire embodied came.<BR>
Fair as the morning was her sheen,<BR>
And gold and gems adorned the queen.<BR>
Her form in crimson robes arrayed,<BR>
Her hair was bound in glossy braid.<BR>
Her wreath was fresh and sweet of scent,<BR>
Undimmed was every ornament.<BR>
Then, standing close to R&aacute;ma'a side,<BR>
The universal witness cried:<BR>
'From every blot and blemish free<BR>
Thy faithful queen returns to thee.<BR>
In word or deed, in look or mind<BR>
Her heart from thee has ne'er declined.<BR>
By force the giant bore away<BR>
From thy lone cot his helpless prey;<BR>
And in his bowers securely kept<BR>
She still has longed for thee and wept.<BR>
With soft temptation, bribe and threat,<BR>
He bade the dame her love forget:<BR>
But nobly faithful to her lord,<BR>
Her soul the giant's suit abhorred.<BR>
Receive, O King, thy queen again,<BR>
Pure, ever pure from spot and stain.'<BR>

<P>
Still stood the king in thoughtful mood<BR>
And tears of joy his eyes bedewed.<BR>
Then to the best of Gods the best<BR>
Of warrior chiefs his mind expressed:<BR>

<P>
'Twas meet that mid the thousands here<BR>
The searching fire my queen should clear;<BR>
For long within the giant's bower<BR>
She dwelt the vassal of his power.<BR>
For else had many a slanderous tongue<BR>
Reproaches on mine honour flung,<BR>
And scorned the king who, love-impelled,<BR>
His consort from the proof withheld.<BR>
No doubt had I, but surely knew<BR>
That Janak's child was pure and true,<BR>
That, come what might, in good and ill<BR>
Her faithful heart was with me still.<BR>
I knew that R&aacute;van could not wrong<BR>
Mv queen whom virtue made so strong.<BR>
I knew his heart would sink and fail,<BR>
Nor dare her honour to assail,<BR>
As Ocean, when he raves and roars.<BR>
Fears to o'erleap his bounding shores.<BR>
Now to the worlds her truth is shown,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; is again mine own.<BR>
Thus proved before unnumbered eyes,<BR>
On her pure fame no shadow lies.<BR>
As heroes to their glory cleave,<BR>
Mine own dear spouse I ne'er will leave.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: and clasped in fond embrace<BR>
On his dear breast she hid her face.<BR>
