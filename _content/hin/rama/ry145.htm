<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXVII.: THE PRAISE OF KINGS.</H3>
<P>
That night of sorrow passed away,<BR>
And rose again the God of Day.<BR>
Then all the twice-born peers of state<BR>
Together met for high debate.<BR>
J&aacute;v&aacute;l&iacute;, lord of mighty fame.<BR>
And Gautam, and K&aacute;ty&aacute;yan came,<BR>
And M&aacute;rkandeya's reverend age,<BR>
And V&aacute;madeva, glorious sage:<BR>
Sprung from Mudgalya's seed the one,<BR>
The other ancient Kas'yap's son.<BR>
With lesser lords these Br&aacute;hmans each<BR>
Spoke in his turn his several speech,<BR>
And turning to Vas'ishtha, best<BR>
Of household priests him thus addressed:<BR>
The night of bitter woe has past,<BR>
Which seemed a hundred years to last,<BR>
Our king, in sorrow for his son,<BR>
Reunion with the Five has won.<BR>
His soul is where the blessed are,<BR>
While R&aacute;ma roams in woods afar,<BR>
And Lakshman, bright in glorious deeds,<BR>
Goes where his well-loved brother leads.<BR>
And Bharat and S'atrughna, they<BR>
Who smite their foes in battle fray,<BR>
Far in the realm of Kekaya stay,<BR>
Where their maternal grandsire's care<BR>
Keeps R&aacute;jagriha's city fair.<BR>
Let one of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's race<BR>
Obtain this day the sovereign's place,<BR>
Or havoc and destruction straight<BR>
Our kingless land will devastate.<BR>
In kingless lands no thunder's voice,<BR>
No lightning wreaths the heart rejoice,<BR>
Nor does Parjanya's heavenly rain<BR>
Descend upon the burning plain.<BR>
Where none is king, the sower's hand<BR>
Casts not the seed upon the land;<BR>
The son against the father strives.<BR>
And husbands fail to rule their wives.<BR>
In kingless realms no princes call<BR>
Their friends to meet in crowded hall;<BR>
No joyful citizens resort<BR>
To garden trim or sacred court.<BR>
In kingless realms no Twice-born care<BR>
To sacrifice with text and prayer,<BR>
Nor Br&aacute;hmans, who their vows maintain,<BR>
The great solemnities ordain.<BR>
The joys of happier days have ceased:<BR>
No gathering, festival, or feast<BR>
Together calls the merry throng<BR>
Delighted with the play and song.<BR>
In kingless lands it ne'er is well<BR>
With sons of trade who buy and sell:<BR>
No men who pleasant tales repeat<BR>
Delight the crowd with stories sweet.<BR>
In kingless realms we ne'er behold<BR>
Young maidens decked with gems and gold,<BR>
Flock to the gardens blithe and gay<BR>
To spend their evening hours in play.<BR>
No lover in the flying car<BR>
Rides with his love to woods afar.<BR>
In kingless lands no wealthy swain<BR>
Who keeps the herd and reaps the grain,<BR>
Lies sleeping, blest with ample store,<BR>
Securely near his open door.<BR>
Upon the royal roads we see<BR>
No tusked elephant roaming free,<BR>
Of three-score years, whose head and neck<BR>
Sweet tinkling bells of silver deck.<BR>
We hear no more the glad applause<BR>
When his strong bow each rival draws,<BR>
No clap of hands, no eager cries<BR>
That cheer each martial exercise.<BR>
In kingless realms no merchant bands<BR>
Who travel forth to distant lands,<BR>
With precious wares their wagons load.<BR>

And fear no danger on the road,<BR>
No sage secure in self-control,<BR>
Brooding on God with mind and soul,<BR>
In lonely wanderings finds his home<BR>
Where'er at eve his feet may roam.<BR>
In kingless realms no man is sure<BR>
He holds his life and wealth secure.<BR>
In kingless lands no warriors smite<BR>
The foeman's host in glorious fight.<BR>
In kingless lands the wise no more.<BR>
Well trained in Scripture's holy lore.<BR>
In shady groves and gardens meet<BR>
To argue in their calm retreat.<BR>
No longer, in religious fear,<BR>
Do they who pious vows revere,<BR>
Bring dainty cates and wreaths of flowers<BR>
As offerings to the heavenly powers.<BR>
No longer, bright as trees in spring,<BR>
Shine forth the children of the king<BR>
Resplendent in the people's eyes<BR>
With aloe wood and sandal dyes.<BR>
A brook where water once has been,<BR>
A grove where grass no more is green,<BR>
Kine with no herdsman's guiding hand--<BR>
So wretched is a kingless land.<BR>
The car its waving banner rears,<BR>
Banner of fire the smoke appears:<BR>
Our king, the banner of our pride,<BR>
A God with Gods is glorified.<BR>
In kingless lands no law is known,<BR>
And none may call his wealth his own,<BR>
Each preys on each from hour to hour,<BR>
As fish the weaker fish devour.<BR>
Then fearless, atheists overleap<BR>
The bounds of right the godly keep,<BR>
And when no royal powers restrain,<BR>
Pre?inence and lordship gain.<BR>
As in the frame of man the eye<BR>
Keeps watch and ward, a careful spy,<BR>
The monarch in his wide domains<BR>
Protects the truth, the right maintains.<BR>
He is the right, the truth is he,<BR>
Their hopes in him the well-born see.<BR>
On him his people's lives depend,<BR>
Mother is he, and sire, nnd friend.<BR>
The world were veiled in blinding night,<BR>
And none could see or know aright,<BR>
Ruled there no king in any state<BR>
The good and ill to separate.<BR>
We will obey thy word and will<BR>
As if our king were living still:<BR>
As keeps his bounds the faithful sea,<BR>
So we observe thy high decree.<BR>
O best of Br&aacute;mans, first in place,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Our kingless land lies desolate:<BR>
Some scion of Ikshv&aacute;ku's race<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Do thou as monarch consecrate.'<BR>
