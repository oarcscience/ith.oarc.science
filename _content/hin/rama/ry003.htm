To every creature good and kind?<BR>
Bounteous, and holy, just, and wise,<BR>
Alone most fair to all men's eyes?<BR>
Devoid of envy, firm, and sage,<BR>
Whose tranquil soul ne'er yields to rage?<BR>
Whom, when his warrior wrath is high,<BR>
Do Gods embattled fear and fly?<BR>
Whose noble might and gentle skill<BR>
The triple world can guard from ill?<BR>

In Scripture versed, in glory bright,<BR>
His steps in virtue's paths are bent,<BR>
Obedient, pure, and eloquent.<BR>
In each emprise he wins success,<BR>

High destiny is clear impressed<BR>
On massive jaw and ample chest,<BR>
His mighty shafts he truly aims,<BR>
And foemen in the battle tames.<BR>
Deep in the muscle, scarcely shown,<BR>
Embedded lies his collar-bone.<BR>
His lordly steps are firm and free,<BR>
His strong arms reach below his knee;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

Graced with each high imperial mark,<BR>
His skin is soft and lustrous dark.<BR>
Large are his eyes that sweetly shine<BR>
With majesty almost divine.<BR>
His plighted word he ne'er forgets;<BR>
On erring sense a watch he sets.<BR>
By nature wise, his teacher's skill<BR>
Has trained him to subdue his will.<BR>
Good, resolute and pure, and strong,<BR>
He guards mankind from scathe and wrong,<BR>
And lends his aid, and ne'er in vain,<BR>
The cause of justice to maintain.<BR>
Well has he studied o'er and o'er<BR>

His kingdom as the Regent Heir.<BR>
But when Kaikey&iacute;, youngest queen,<BR>
With eyes of envious hate had seen<BR>
The solemn pomp and regal state<BR>
Prepared the prince to consecrate,<BR>
She bade the hapless king bestow<BR>
Two gifts he promised long ago,<BR>
That R&aacute;ma to the woods should flee,<BR>
And that her child the heir should be.<BR>

R&aacute;ma, to please Kaikey&iacute; went<BR>
Obedient forth to banishment.<BR>
Then Lakshman's truth was nobly shown,<BR>
Then were his love and courage known,<BR>
When for his brother's sake he dared<BR>
All perils, and his exile shared.<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute;, R&aacute;ma's darling wife,<BR>
Loved even as he loved his life,<BR>
Whom happy marks combined to bless,<BR>
A miracle of loveliness,<BR>
Of Janak's royal lineage sprung,<BR>
Most excellent of women, clung<BR>
To her dear lord, like Rohin&iacute;<BR>
Rejoicing with the Moon to be. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The King and people, sad of mood,<BR>
The hero's car awhile pursued.<BR>
But when Prince R&aacute;ma lighted down<BR>
At S'riugavera's pleasant town,<BR>
Where Gang&aacute;'s holy waters flow,<BR>
He bade his driver turn and go.<BR>
Guha, Nish&aacute;das' king, he met,<BR>
And on the farther bank was set.<BR>
Then on from wood to wood they strayed,<BR>
O'er many a stream, through constant shade,<BR>
As Bharadv&aacute;ja bade them, till<BR>
They came to Chitrak&uacute;ta's hill.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma there, with Lakshman's aid,<BR>
A pleasant little cottage made,<BR>
And spent his days with S&iacute;t&aacute;, dressed<BR>

<P>

<P>
In coat of bark and deerskin vest. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
And Chitrakuta grew to be<BR>
As bright with those illustrious three<BR>

With glory, when the Gods recline<BR>

The Lord of Gold and Beauty's Queen.<BR>

<P>
The aged king for Rama pined,<BR>
And for the skies the earth resigned,<BR>
Bharat, his son, refused to reign,<BR>
Though urged by all the twice-born &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A> train.<BR>
Forth to the woods he fared to meet<BR>
Hia brother, fell before his feet,<BR>
And cried, 'Thy <A HREF="errata.htm#0">claim</A> all men allow:<BR>
O come, our lord and king be thou.'<BR>
But Rama nobly chose to be<BR>
Observant of his sire's decree.<BR>
He placed his sandals &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">5b</FONT></A> in his hand<BR>
A pledge that he would rule the land:<BR>
And bade his brother turn again.<BR>
Then Bharat. finding prayer was vain,<BR>
The sandals took and went away;<BR>
Nor in Ayodhy&aacute; would he stay.<BR>
But turned to Nandigr&aacute;ma, where<BR>
He ruled the realm with watchful care,<BR>
Still longing eagerly to learn<BR>
Tidings of R&aacute;ma's safe return.<BR>

<P>
Then lest the people should repeat<BR>
Their visit to his calm retreat,<BR>
Away from Chitrak&uacute;ta's hill<BR>
Fared R&aacute;ma ever onward till<BR>

Beneath the shady trees he stood<BR>
Of Dandak&aacute;'s primeval wood,<BR>
Vir&aacute;dha, giant fiend, he slew,<BR>
And then Agastya's friendship knew.<BR>
Counselled by him he gained the sword<BR>
And bow of Indra, heavenly lord:<BR>
A pair of quivers too, that bore<BR>
Of arrows an exhaustless store.<BR>
While there he dwelt in greenwood shade<BR>
The trembling hermits sought his aid,<BR>
And bade him with his sword and bow<BR>
Destroy the fiends who worked them woe:<BR>
To come like Indra strong and brave,<BR>
A guardian God to help and save.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's falchion left its trace<BR>
Deep cut on S&uacute;rpanakh&aacute;'s face:<BR>
A hideous giantess who came<BR>
Burning for him with lawless flame.<BR>
Their sister's cries the giants heard.<BR>
And vengeance in each bosom stirred:<BR>
The monster of the triple head.<BR>
And D&uacute;shan to the contest sped.<BR>
But they and myriad fiends beside<BR>
Beneath the might of R&aacute;ma died.<BR>

<P>
When R&aacute;van, dreaded warrior, knew<BR>
The slaughter of his giant crew:<BR>
R&aacute;van, the king, whose name of fear<BR>
Earth, hell, and heaven all shook to hear:<BR>
He bade the fiend M&aacute;r&iacute;cha aid<BR>
The vengeful plot his fury laid.<BR>
In vain the wise M&aacute;r&iacute;cha tried<BR>
To turn him from his course aside:<BR>
Not R&aacute;van's self, he said, might hope<BR>
With R&aacute;ma and his strength to cope.<BR>
Impelled by fate and blind with rage<BR>
He came to R&aacute;ma's hermitage.<BR>
There, by M&aacute;r&iacute;cha's magic art,<BR>
He wiled the princely youths apart,<BR>
The vulture&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> slew, and bore away<BR>
The wife of R&aacute;ma as his prey.<BR>
The son of Raghu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> came and found<BR>
Jat&aacute;yu slain upon the ground.<BR>
He rushed within his leafy cot;<BR>
He sought his wife, but found her not.<BR>
Then, then the hero's senses failed;<BR>
In mad despair he wept and wailed,<BR>
Upon the pile that bird he laid,<BR>
And still in quest of Sit&aacute; strayed.<BR>
A hideous giant then he saw,<BR>
Kabandha named, a shape of awe.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
The monstrous fiend he smote and slew,<BR>
And in the flame the body threw;<BR>
When straight from out the funeral flame<BR>
In lovely form Kabandha came,<BR>
And bade him seek in his distress<BR>
A wise and holy hermitess.<BR>
By counsel of this saintly dame<BR>
To Pamp&aacute;'s pleasant flood he came,<BR>
And there the steadfast friendship won<BR>
Of Hanum&aacute;n the Wind-God's son.<BR>
Counselled by him he told his grief<BR>
To great Sugr&iacute;va, V&aacute;nar chief,<BR>
Who, knowing all the tale, before<BR>
The sacred flame alliance swore.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va to his new-found friend<BR>
Told his own story to the end:<BR>
His hate of B&aacute;li for the wrong<BR>
And insult he had borne so long.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma lent a willing ear<BR>
And promised to allay his fear.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va warned him of the might<BR>
Of B&aacute;li, matchless in the fight,<BR>
And, credence for his tale to gain,<BR>
Showed the huge fiend&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> by B&aacute;li slain.<BR>
The prostrate corpse of mountain size<BR>
Seemed nothing in the hero's eyes;<BR>
He lightly kicked it, as it lay,<BR>
And cast it twenty leagues&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> away.<BR>
To prove his might his arrows through<BR>
Seven palms in line, uninjured, flew.<BR>
He cleft a mighty hill apart,<BR>
And down to hell he hurled his dart,<BR>
Then high Sugr&iacute;va's spirit rose,<BR>
Assured of conquest o'er his foes.<BR>
With his new champion by his side<BR>
To vast Kishkindh&aacute;'s cave he hied.<BR>
Then, summoned by his awful shout,<BR>
King B&aacute;li came in fury out,<BR>
First comforted his trembling wife,<BR>
Then sought Sugr&iacute;va in the strife.<BR>
One shaft from R&aacute;ma's deadly bow<BR>
The monarch in the dust laid low.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma bade Sugr&iacute;va reign<BR>
In place of royal B&aacute;li slain.<BR>
Then speedy envoys hurried forth<BR>
Eastward and westward, south and north,<BR>
Commanded by the grateful king<BR>
Tidings of R&aacute;ma's spouse to bring.<BR>

<P>
Then by Samp&aacute;ti's counsel led,<BR>
Brave Hanum&aacute;n, who mocked at dread,<BR>
Sprang at one wild tremendous leap<BR>
Two hundred leagues across the deep.<BR>
To Lank&aacute;'s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> town he urged his way,<BR>
Where R&aacute;van held his royal sway.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
There pensive 'neath As'oka &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> boughs<BR>
He found poor Sit&aacute;, R&aacute;ma's spouse.<BR>
He gave the hapless girl a ring,<BR>
A token from her lord and king.<BR>
A pledge from her fair hand he bore;<BR>
Then battered down the garden door.<BR>
Five captains of the host be slew,<BR>
Seven sons of councillors o'erthrew;<BR>
Crushed youthful Aksha on the field,<BR>
Then to his captors chose to yield.<BR>
Soon from their bonds his limbs were free,<BR>
But honouring the high decree<BR>
Which Brahm&aacute; had pronounced of yore, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
He calmly all their insults bore.<BR>
The town he burnt with hostile flame,<BR>
And spoke again with R&aacute;ma's dame,<BR>
Then swiftly back to R&aacute;ma flew<BR>
With tidings of the interview.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then with Sugr&iacute;va for his guide,<BR>
Came R&aacute;ma to the ocean side.<BR>
He smote the sea with shafts as bright<BR>
As sunbeams in their summer height,<BR>
And quick appeared the Rivers' King &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
Obedient to the summoning.<BR>
A bridge was thrown by Nala o'er<BR>
The narrow sea from shore to shore. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><BR>
They crossed to Lank&aacute;'s golden town,<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma's hand smote R&aacute;van down.<BR>
Vibhishan there was left to reign<BR>
Over his brother's wide domain.<BR>
To meet her husband Sit&aacute; came;<BR>
But R&aacute;ma, stung with ire and shame,<BR>
With bitter words his wife addressed<BR>
Before the crowd that round her pressed.<BR>
But Sit&aacute;, touched with noble ire,<BR>
Gave her fair body to the fire.<BR>
Then straight the God of Wind appeared,<BR>
And words from heaven her honour cleared.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma clasped his wife again,<BR>
Uninjured, pure from spot and stain,<BR>
Obedient to the Lord of Fire<BR>
And the high mandate of his sire.<BR>
Led by the Lord who rules the sky,<BR>
The Gods and heavenly saints drew nigh,<BR>
And honoured him with worthy meed,<BR>
Rejoicing in each glorious deed.<BR>
His task achieved, his foe removed,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
He triumphed, by the Gods approved,<BR>
By grace of Heaven he raised to life<BR>
The chieftains slain in mortal strife;<BR>
Then in the magic chariot through<BR>
The clouds to Nandigr&aacute;ma flew.<BR>
Met by his faithful brothers there,<BR>
He loosed his votive coil of hair:<BR>
Thence fair Ayodhy&aacute;'s town he gained,<BR>
And o'er his father's kingdom reigned.<BR>
Disease or famine ne'er oppressed<BR>
His happy people, richly blest<BR>
With all the joys of ample wealth,<BR>
Of sweet content and perfect health.<BR>
No widow mourned her well-loved mate,<BR>
No sire his son's untimely fate.<BR>
They feared not storm or robber's hand;<BR>
No fire or flood laid waste the land:<BR>
The Golden Age &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> had come again<BR>
To bless the days of R&aacute;ma's reign.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  From him, the great and glorious king,<BR>
Shall many a princely scion spring.<BR>
And he shall rule, beloved by men,<BR>
Ten thousand years and hundreds ten,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
And when his life on earth is past<BR>
To Brahm&aacute;'s world shall go at last.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Whoe'er this noble poem reads<BR>
That tells the tale of R&aacute;ma's deeds,<BR>
Good as the Scriptures, he shall be<BR>
From every sin and blemish free.<BR>
Whoever reads the saving strain,<BR>
With all his kin the heavens shall gain.<BR>
Br&aacute;hmans who read shall gather hence<BR>
The highest praise for eloquence.<BR>
The warrior, o'er the laud shall reign,<BR>
The merchant, luck in trade obtain;<BR>
And S'&uacute;dras listening &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> ne'er shall fail<BR>

The Bombay edition reads <I>trilokajna,

roots, fruits and air, obtain a vision of the
three worlds with all things moving and
stationary.' MANU, XI. 236.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_15"></A><A HREF="ry003.htm#fr_15">2:3b</A>  The Indians paid great attention to
the art of physiognomy and believed that
character and fortune could be foretold
not from the face only, but from marks
upon the neck and hands. Three lines
under the chin like those at the mouth of
a conch (<I>S'an'kha</I>) were regarded as a
peculiarly auspicious sign indicating, as
did also the mark of Vishnu's discus on
the hand, one born to be a <I>chakravartin</I> or
universal emperor. In the palmistry of
Europe the line of fortune, as well as the
line of life, is in the hand. Cardan says
that marks on the nails and teeth also
show what is to happen to us: 'Sunt
etiam in nobis vestigia qu&aelig;dam futurorum
eyentuum in unguibus atque etiam in dentibus.'
Though the palmy days of Indian
chiromancy have passed away, the art
is still to some extent studied and believed
in.</P>

knowledge, and this name ia given by the
Br&aacute;hmans not to one work, but to the
whole body of their most ancient sacred
literature. Veda is the same word which
appears in the Greek &#0959&#7984&#0948&#0945, I know, and
in the English wise, wisdom, to wit. The
name of Veda is commonly given to four
collections of hymns, which are respectively
known by the names of Rig-veda,
Yajur-veda, S&aacute;ma-veda, and Atharva-veda.'

<P>
'As the language of the Veda, the Sanskrit,
is the most ancient type of the English
of the present day, (Sanskrit and
English are but varieties of one and the
same language,) so its thoughts and feelings
contain in reality the first roots and
germs of that intellectual growth which
by an unbroken chain connects our own
generation with the ancestors of the Aryan
race,--with those very people who at the
rising and setting of the sun listened with
trembling hearts to the songs of the Veda,
that told them of bright powers above, and
of a life to come after the sun of their own
lives had set in the clouds of the evening.
These men were the true ancestors of our
race, and the Veda is the oldest book we
have in which to study the first beginnings
of our language, and of all that is embodied
in language. We are by nature
Aryan, Indo-European, not Semitic: our spiritual kith
and kin are to be found in
India, Persia, Greece, Italy, Germany: not
in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Palestine.'

been married to the twenty-seven daughters
of the patriarch Daksha, or Asvin&iacute; and the
rest, who are in fact personifications of the
Lunar Asterisms. His favourite amongst
them was Rohin&iacute; to whom he so wholly
devoted himself as to neglect the rest. They
complained to their father, and Daksha
repeatedly interposed, till, finding his
remonstrances vain, he denounced a curse
upon his son-in-law, in consequence of
which he remained childless and became
affected by consumption. The wives of
Chandra having interceded in his behalf
with their father, Daksha modified an
imprecation which he could not recall,
and pronounced that the decay should be
periodical only, not permanent, and that
it should alternate with periods of recovery.
Hence the successive wane and increase
of the Moon. <I>Padma, Pur&aacute;na, Swarga-Khanda,</I>
