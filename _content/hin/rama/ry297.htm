<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXIII.: T&Aacute;R&Aacute;'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
She kissed her lifeless husband's face,<BR>
She clasped him in a close embrace,<BR>
Laid her soft lips upon his head;<BR>
Then words like these the mourner said:<BR>

<P>
'No words of mine wouldst thou regard,<BR>
And now thy bed is cold and hard.<BR>
Upon the rude rough ground o'erthrown,<BR>
Beneath thee naught but sand and stone.<BR>
To thee the earth is dearer far<BR>
Than I and my caresses are,<BR>
If thou upon her breast wilt lie,<BR>
And to my words make no reply.<BR>
Ah my beloved, good and brave,<BR>
Bold to attack and strong to save,<BR>
Fate is Sugriva's thrall, and we<BR>
In him our lord and master see.<BR>
Lo, by thy bed, a mournful band,<BR>
Thy V&aacute;nar chiefs lamenting stand.<BR>
O hear thy nobles' groans and cries,<BR>
O mark thy Angad's Weeping eyes,<BR>
O list to my entreaties, break<BR>
The chains of slumber and awake.<BR>
Ah me, my lord, this lowly bed<BR>
Where rest thy limbs and fallen head,<BR>
Is the cold couch where smitten lay<BR>
Thy foemen in the bloody fray.<BR>
O noble heart from blemish free,<BR>
Lover of war, beloved by me,<BR>
Why hast thou fled away and left<BR>
Thy T&aacute;r&aacute; of all hope bereft!<BR>
Unwise the father who allows<BR>
His child to be a warrior's spouse,<BR>
For, hero, see thy consort's fate,<BR>
A widow now moat desolate,<BR>
For ever broken is my pride,<BR>
My hope of lasting bliss has died,<BR>
And sinking in the lowest deep<BR>
Of sorrow's sea I pine and weep.<BR>
Ah, surely not of earthly mould,<BR>
This stony heart is stern and cold,<BR>
Or, in a hundred pieces rent,<BR>
It had not lingered to lament.<BR>
Dead, dead! my husband, friend, and lord<BR>
In whom my loving hopes were stored,<BR>
First in the field, his foemen's dread,<BR>
My own victorious B&aacute;li, dead!<BR>
A woman when her lord has died,<BR>
Though children flourish by her side,<BR>
Though stores of gold her coffers fill,<BR>
Is called a lonely widow still.<BR>
Alas, thy bleeding gashes make<BR>
Around thy limbs a purple lake:<BR>
Thus slumbering was thy wont to lie<BR>
On cushions bright with crimson dye.<BR>
Dark streams of welling blood besmear<BR>
Thy limbs where dust and mire adhere,<BR>
Nor have I strength, weighed down by woe,<BR>
Mine arms about thy form to throw.<BR>
The issue of this day has brought<BR>
Sugriva all his wishes sought,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma shot one shaft and he<BR>
Is freed from fear and jeopardy.<BR>
Alas, alas, I may not rest<BR>
My head upon thy wounded breast,<BR>
Obstructed by the massive dart<BR>
Deep buried in thy bleeding heart.'<BR>

<P>
Then N&iacute;la from his bosom drew<BR>
The fatal shaft that pierced him through,<BR>
Like some tremendous serpent deep<BR>
In caverns of a hill asleep.<BR>
As from the hero's wound it came,<BR>
Shot from the shaft a gleam of flame,<BR>
Like the last flashes of the sun<BR>
Descending when his course is run.<BR>
From the wide rent in crimson flood<BR>
Rushed the full stream of B&aacute;li's blood,<BR>
Like torrents down a mountain's side<BR>
With golden ore and copper dyed.<BR>
Then T&aacute;r&aacute; brushed with tender care<BR>
The dust of battle from his hair,<BR>
While her sad eyes poured down their rain<BR>
Upon her lord untimely slain.<BR>
Once more she looked upon the dead;<BR>
Then to her bright-eyed child she said:<BR>
'Turn hither, turn thy weeping eyes<BR>
Where low in death thy father lies.<BR>
By sinful deed and bitter hate<BR>
Our lord has met his mournful fate.<BR>
Bright as the sun at early morn<BR>
To Yama's halls is B&aacute;li borne.<BR>
Then go, my child, salute the king,<BR>
From whom our bliss and honour spring.<BR>

<P>
Obedient to his mother's hest<BR>
His father's feet he gently pressed<BR>

<P>
With twining arms and lingering hands:<BR>
'Father', he cried, there Angad stands.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Then T&aacute;r&aacute;: 'Art thou stern and mute,<BR>
Regardless of thy child's salute?<BR>
Hast thou no blessing for thy son,<BR>
No word for little Angad, none?<BR>
O, hero, at thy lifeless feet<BR>
Here with my boy I take my seat,<BR>
As some sad mother of the herd,<BR>
By the fierce lion undeterred,<BR>
Lies moaning by the grassy dell<BR>
Wherein her lord and leader fell.<BR>
How, having wrought that awful rite,<BR>
The sacrifice of deadly fight.<BR>
Wherein the shaft by R&aacute;ma sped<BR>
Supplied the place of water shed,<BR>
How hast thou bathed thee at the end<BR>
Without thy wife her aid to lend? &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_610"></A><A HREF="ry298.htm#fn_610"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Why do mine eyes no more behold<BR>
Thy bright beloved chain of gold,<BR>
Which, pleased with thee, the Immortals' King<BR>
About thy neck vouchsafed to fling?<BR>
Still lingering on thy lifeless face<BR>
I see the pride of royal race:<BR>
Thus when the sun has set his glow<BR>
Still rests upon the Lord of Snow.<BR>
Alas my hero! undeterred<BR>
Thou wouldst not listen to my word.<BR>
With tears and prayers I sued in vain:<BR>
Thou wouldst not listen, and art slain.<BR>
Gone is my bliss, my glory: I<BR>
And Angad now with thee will die.'<BR>
