### CANTO CXVII.: ANASÚYÁ.

But dwelling in that lonely spot  
Left by the hermits pleased him not.  
'I met the faithful Bharat here,  
The townsmen, and my mother dear:  
The painful memory lingers yet,  
And stings me with a vain regret.  
And here the host of Bharat camped,  
And many a courser here has stamped,  
And elephants with ponderous feet  
Have trampled through the calm retreat.'  
So forth to seek a home he hied,  
His spouse and Lakshman by his side.  
He came to Atri's pure retreat.  
Paid reverence to his holy feet,  
And from the saint such welcome won  
As a fond father gives his son.  
The noble prince with joy unfeigned  
As a dear guest he entertained,  
And cheered the glorious Lakshman too  
And Sítá with observance due.  
Then Anasúyá at the call  
Of him who sought the good of all,  
His blameless venerable spouse,  
Delighting in her holy vows,  
Came from her chamber to his side:  
To her the virtuous hermit cried:  
'Receive, I pray, with friendly grace  
This dame of Maithil monarchs' race:  
To Ráma next made known his wife,  
The devotee of saintliest life:  
'Ten thousand years this votaress bent  
On sternest rites of penance spent;  
She when the clouds withheld their rain,  
And drought ten years consumed the plain,  
Caused grateful roots and fruit to grow  
And ordered Gangá here to flow:  
So from their cares the saints she freed,  
Nor let these checks their rites impede,  
She wrought in Heaven's behalf, and made  
Ten nights of one, the Gods to aid:  <span
id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_400)  
Let holy Anasúyá be  
An honoured mother, Prince, to thee.  
Let thy Videhan spouse draw near  
To her whom all that live revere,  
Stricken in years, whose loving mind  
Is slow to wrath and ever kind.'  

He ceased: and Ráma gave assent,  
And said, with eyes on Sítá bent:  
'O Princess, thou hast heard with me  
This counsel of the devotee:  
Now that her touch thy soul may bless,  
Approach the saintly votaress:  

Come to the venerable dame,  
Far known by Anasúyá's name:  
The mighty things that she has done  
High glory in the world have won.'  

Thus spoke the son of Raghu: she  
Approached the saintly devotee,  
Who with her white locks, old and frail,  
Shook like a plantain in the gale.  
To that true spouse she bowed her head,  
And 'Lady, I am Sítá,' said:  
Raised suppliant hands and prayed her tell  
That all was prosperous and well.  

The aged matron, when she saw  
Fair Sítá true to duty's law,  
Addressed her thus: ' High fate is thine  
Whose thoughts to virtue still incline.  
Thou, lady of the noble mind,  
Hast kin and state and wealth resigned  
To follow Ráma forced to tread  
Where solitary woods are spread.  
Those women gain high spheres above  
Who still unchanged their husbands love,  
Whether they dwell in town or wood,  
Whether their hearts be ill or good.  
Though wicked, poor, or led away  
In love's forbidden paths to stray,  
The noble matron still will deem  
Her lord a deity supreme.  
Regarding kin and friendship, I  
Can see no better, holier tie,  
And every penance-rite is dim  
Beside the joy of serving him.  
But dark is this to her whose mind  
Promptings of idle fancy blind,  
Who led by evil thoughts away  
Makes him who should command obey.  
Such women, O dear Maithil dame,  
Their virtue lose and honest fame,  
Enslaved by sin and folly, led  
In these unholy paths to tread.  
But they who good and true like thee  
The present and the future see,  
Like men by holy deeds will rise  
To mansions in the blissful skies.  
   So keep thee pure from taint of sin,  
     Still to thy lord be true,  
   And fame and merit shalt thou win,  
     To thy devotion due.'
