<P>
He ceased; and spurred by warlike pride<BR>
The impetuous son of Raghu cried:<BR>
'Soon shall mine arm with wrathful joy<BR>
That city of the foe destroy.<BR>
Now, chieftain, now collect the host,<BR>
And onward to the southern coast!<BR>
The sun in his meridian tower<BR>
Gives glory to the V&aacute;nar power.<BR>
The demon lord who stole my queen<BR>
By timely flight his life may screen.<BR>
She, when she knows her lord is near,<BR>
Will cling to hope and banish fear,<BR>
Saved like a dying wretch who sips<BR>
The drink of Gods with fevered lips.<BR>
Arise, thy troops to battle lead:<BR>
All happy omens counsel speed.<BR>
The Lord of Stars in favouring skies<BR>
Bodes glory to our enterprise.<BR>
This arm shall slay the fiend; and she.<BR>
My consort, shall again be free.<BR>

<P>
Mine upward-throbbing eye foreshows<BR>
The longed-for triumph o'er my foes.<BR>
Far in the van be N&iacute;la's post,<BR>
To scan the pathway for the host,<BR>
And let thy bravest and thy best,<BR>
A hundred thousand, wait his hest.<BR>
Go forth, O warrior N&iacute;la, lead<BR>
The legions on through wood and mead<BR>
Where pleasant waters cool the ground,<BR>
And honey, flowers, and fruit abound,<BR>
Go, and with timely care prevent<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas foeman's dark intent.<BR>
With watchful troops each valley guard<BR>
Ere brooks and fruits and roots be marred<BR>
And search each glen and leafy shade<BR>
For hostile troops in ambuscade.<BR>
But let the weaklings stay behind:<BR>
For heroes is our task designed.<BR>
Let thousands of the V&aacute;nar breed<BR>
The vanguard of the armies lead:<BR>
Fierce and terrific must it be<BR>
As billows of the stormy sea.<BR>
There be the hill-huge Gaja's place,<BR>
And Gavaya's, strongest of his race,<BR>
And, like the bull that leads the herd,<BR>
Gav&aacute;ksha's, by no fears deterred<BR>
Let Rishabh, matchless in the might<BR>
Of warlike arms, protect our right,<BR>
And Gandham&aacute;dan next in rank<BR>
Defend and guide the other flank.<BR>
I, like the God who rules the sky<BR>
Borne on Air&aacute;vat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_910"></A><A HREF="#fn_910"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> mounted high<BR>
On stout Han&uacute;m&aacute;n's back will ride,<BR>
The central host to cheer and guide.<BR>
Fierce as the God who rules below,<BR>
On Angad's back let Lakshman show<BR>
Like him who wealth to mortals shares,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_911"></A><A HREF="#fn_911"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The lord whom S&aacute;rvabhauma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_912"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> bears.<BR>
The bold Sushen's impetuous might,<BR>
And Vegadars'&iacute;'s piercing sight,<BR>
And J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n whom bears revere,<BR>
Illustrious three, shall guard the rear.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased, the royal V&aacute;nar heard,<BR>
And swift, obedient to his word,<BR>
Sprang forth in numbers none might tell<BR>
From mountain, care, and bosky dell,<BR>
From rocky ledge and breezy height,<BR>
Fierce V&aacute;nars burning for the fight.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's course was southward bent<BR>
Amid the mighty armament.<BR>
On, joyous, pressed in close array<BR>
The hosts who owned Sugr&iacute;va's sway,<BR>
With nimble feet, with rapid bound<BR>
Exploring, ere they passed, the ground,<BR>
While from ten myriad throats rang out<BR>
The challenge and the battle shout.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
On roots and honeycomb they fed,<BR>
And clusters from the boughs o'erhead,<BR>
Or from the ground the tall trees tore<BR>
Rich with the flowery load they bore.<BR>
Some carried comrades, wild with mirth,<BR>
Then cast their riders to the earth,<BR>
Who swiftly to their feet arose<BR>
And overthrew their laughing foes.<BR>
While still rang out the general cry,<BR>
'King R&aacute;van and his fiends shall die,'<BR>
Still on, exulting in the pride<BR>
Of conscious strength, the V&aacute;nars hied,<BR>
And gazed where noble Sahya, best<BR>
of mountains, raised each towering crest.<BR>
They looked on lake and streamlet, where<BR>
The lotus bloom was bright and fair,<BR>
Nor marched--for R&aacute;ma's hest they feared<BR>
Where town or haunt of men appeared.<BR>
Still onward, fearful as the waves<BR>
Of Ocean when he roars and raves,<BR>
Led by their eager chieftains, went<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' countless armament.<BR>
Each captain, like a noble steed<BR>
Urged by the lash to double speed.<BR>
Pressed onward, filled with zeal and pride,<BR>
By R&aacute;ma's and his brother's side,<BR>
Who high above the V&aacute;nar throng<BR>
On mighty backs were borne along,<BR>
Like the great Lords of Day and Night<BR>
Seized by eclipsing planets might.<BR>
Then Lakshman radiant as the morn,<BR>
On Angad's shoulders high upborne.<BR>
With sweet consoling words that woke<BR>
New ardour, to his brother spoke:<BR>
'Soon shalt thou turn, thy queen regained<BR>
And impious R&aacute;van's life-blood drained,<BR>
In happiness and high renown<BR>
To dear Ayodhy&aacute;'s happy town.<BR>
I see around exceeding fair<BR>
All omens of the earth and air.<BR>
Auspicious breezes sweet and low<BR>
To greet the V&aacute;nar army blow,<BR>
And softly to my listening ear<BR>
Come the glad cries of bird and deer.<BR>
Bright is the sky around us, bright<BR>
Without a cloud the Lord of Light,<BR>
And S'ukra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_913"></A><A HREF="#fn_913"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> with propitious love<BR>
Looks on thee from his throne above.<BR>
The pole-star and the Sainted Seven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_914"></A><A HREF="#fn_914"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Shine brightly in the northern heaven,<BR>
And great Tris'anku,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_915"></A><A HREF="#fn_915"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> glorious king,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<A NAME="page_430"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 430</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's son from whom we spring,<BR>
Beams in unclouded glory near<BR>
His holy priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_916"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> whom all revere.<BR>
Undimmed the two Vis'&aacute;kh&aacute;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_917"></A><A HREF="#fn_917"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> shine,<BR>
The strength and glory of our line,<BR>
And Nairrit's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_918"></A><A HREF="#fn_918"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> influence that aids<BR>
Our R&aacute;kshas foemen faints and fades.<BR>
The running brooks are fresh and fair,<BR>
The boughs their ripening clusters bear,<BR>
And scented breezes gently sway<BR>
The leaflet of the tender spray.<BR>
See, with a glory half divine<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' ordered legions shine,<BR>
Bright as the Gods' exultant train<BR>
Who saw the demon T&aacute;rak slain.<BR>
O let thine eyes these signs behold,<BR>
And bid thy heart be glad and bold.'<BR>

<P>
The V&aacute;nar squadrons densely spread<BR>
O'er all the country onward sped,<BR>
While rising from the rapid beat<BR>
Of bears' and monkeys' hastening feet<BR>
Dust hid the earth with thickest veil,<BR>
And made the struggling sunbeams pale.<BR>
Now where Mahendra's peaks arise<BR>
Came R&aacute;ma of the lotus eyes<BR>
And the long arm's resistless might,<BR>
And clomb the mountain's wood-crowned height.<BR>
Thence Das'aratha's son beheld<BR>
Where billowy Ocean rose and swelled.<BR>
Past Malaya's peaks and Sahya's chain<BR>
The V&aacute;nar legions reached the main,<BR>
And stood in many a marshalled band<BR>
On loud-resounding Ocean's strand.<BR>
To the fair wood that fringed the tide<BR>
Came Das'aratha's son, and cried:<BR>
'At length, my lord Sugr&iacute;va, we<BR>
Have reached King V&aacute;run's realm the sea,<BR>
And one great thought, still-vexing, how<BR>
To cross the flood, awaits us now.<BR>
The broad deep ocean, that denies<BR>
A passage, stretched before us lies.<BR>
Then let us halt and plan the while<BR>
How best to storm the giant's isle.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: Sugr&iacute;va on the coast<BR>
By trees o'ershadowed stayed the host,<BR>
That seemed in glittering lines to be<BR>
The bright waves of a second sea.<BR>
Then from the shore the captains gazed<BR>
On billows which the breezes raised<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
To fury, as they dashed in foam<BR>
O'er V&aacute;run's realm, the Asurs' home:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_919"></A><A HREF="ry404.htm#fn_919"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
The sea that laughed with foam, and danced<BR>
With waves whereon the sunbeams glanced:<BR>
Where, when the light began to fade,<BR>
Huge crocodiles and monsters played;<BR>
And, when the moon went up the sky,<BR>
The troubled billows rose on high<BR>
From the wild watery world whereon<BR>
A thousand moons reflected shone:<BR>
Where awful serpents swam and showed<BR>
Their fiery crests which flashed and glowed,<BR>
Illumining the depths of hell,<BR>
The prison where the demons dwell.<BR>
The eye, bewildered, sought in vain<BR>
The bounding line of sky and main:<BR>
Alike in shade, alike in glow<BR>
Were sky above and sea below.<BR>
There wave-like clouds by clouds were chased,<BR>
Here cloud-like billows roared and raced:<BR>
Then shone the stars, and many a gem<BR>
That lit the waters answered them.<BR>
They saw the great-souled Ocean stirred<BR>
To frenzy by the winds, and heard,<BR>
Loud as ten thousand drums, the roar<BR>
Of wild waves dashing on the shore.<BR>
They saw him mounting to defy<BR>
With deafening voice the troubled sky.<BR>
And the deep bed beneath him swell<BR>
In fury as the billows fell.<BR>
