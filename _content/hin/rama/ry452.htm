<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LIII.: VAJRADANSHTRA'S SALLY.</H3>
<P>
When R&aacute;van in his palace heard<BR>
The mournful news, his wrath was stirred;<BR>
And, gasping like a furious snake,<BR>
To Vajradanshtra thus he spake:<BR>

<P>
'Go forth, my fiercest captain, lead<BR>
The bravest of the giants' breed.<BR>
Go forth, the sons of Raghu slay<BR>
And by their side Sugr&iacute;va lay.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: the chieftain bowed his head<BR>
And forth with gathered troops he sped.<BR>
Cars, camels, steeds were well arrayed,<BR>
And coloured banners o'er them played.<BR>
Rings decked his arms: about his waist<BR>
The life-protecting mail was braced,<BR>
And on the chieftain's forehead set<BR>
Glittered his cap and coronet.<BR>
Home on a bannered car that glowed<BR>
With golden sheen the warrior rode.<BR>
And footmen marched with spear and sword<BR>
And bow and mace behind their lord.<BR>
In pomp and pride of warlike state<BR>
They sallied from the southern gate,<BR>
But saw, as on their way they sped,<BR>
Dread signs around and overhead.<BR>
For there were meteors falling fast,<BR>
Though not a cloud its shadow cast;<BR>
And each ill-omened bird and beast,<BR>
Forboding death, the fear increased,<BR>
While many a giant slipped and reeled,<BR>
Falling before he reached the field.<BR>
They met in mortal strife engaged,<BR>
And long and fierce the battle raged.<BR>
Spears, swords uplifted, gleamed and flashed,<BR>
And many a chief to earth was dashed.<BR>
A ceaseless storm of arrows rained,<BR>
And limbs were pierced and blood-distained.<BR>
Terrific was the sound that filled<BR>
The air, and every heart was chilled,<BR>
As hurtling o'er the giants flew<BR>
The rocks and trees which V&aacute;nars threw.<BR>
Fierce as a hungry lion when<BR>
Unwary deer approach his den,<BR>

<P>
Angad, his eyes with fury red,<BR>
Waving a tree above his head.<BR>
Rushed with wild charge which none could stay<BR>
Where stood the giants' dense array.<BR>
Like tall trees levelled by the blast<BR>
Before him fell the giants fast,<BR>
And earth that streamed with blood was strown<BR>
With warriors, steeds, and cars o'erthrown.<BR>
