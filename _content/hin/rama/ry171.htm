<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XCIII.: CHITRAK&Uacute;TA IN SIGHT.</H3>
<P>
As through the woods its way pursued<BR>
That mignty bannered multitude,<BR>
Wild elephants in terror fled<BR>
With all the startled herds they led,<BR>
And bears and deer were seen on hill,<BR>
In forest glade, by every rill.<BR>
Wide as the sea from coast to coast,<BR>
The high-souled Bharat's mighty host<BR>
Covered the earth as cloudy trains<BR>
Obscure the sky when fall the rains.<BR>
The stately elephants he led,<BR>
And countless steeds the land o'erspread,<BR>
So closely crowded that between<BR>
Their serried ranks no ground was seen.<BR>
Then when the host had travelled far,<BR>
And steeds were worn who drew the car,<BR>
The glorious Bharat thus addressed<BR>
Vas'ishtha, of his lords the best:<BR>
'The spot, methinks, we now behold<BR>
Of which the holy hermit told,<BR>
For, as his words described, I trace<BR>
Each several feature of the place:<BR>
Before us Chitrak&uacute;ta shows,<BR>
Mand&aacute;kin&iacute; beside us flows:<BR>
Afar umbrageous woods arise<BR>
Like darksome clouds that veil the skies.<BR>
Now tread these mountain-beasts of mine<BR>
On Chitrak&uacute;ta's fair incline.<BR>
The trees their rain of blossoms shed<BR>
On table-lands beneath them spread,<BR>
As from black clouds the floods descend<BR>
When the hot days of summer end.<BR>
S'atrughna, look, the mountain see<BR>
Where heavenly minstrels wander free,<BR>

And horses browse beneath the steep.<BR>
Countless as monsters in the deep.<BR>
Scared by my host the mountain deer<BR>
Starting with tempest speed appear<BR>
Like the long lines of cloud that fly<BR>
In autumn through the windy sky.<BR>
See, every warrior shows his head<BR>
With fragrant blooms engarlanded;<BR>
All look like southern soldiers who<BR>
Lift up their shields of azure hue.<BR>
This lonely wood beneath the hill.<BR>
That was so dark and drear and still,<BR>
Covered with men in endless streams<BR>
Now like Ayodhy&aacute;'s city seems.<BR>
The dust which countless hoofs excite<BR>
Obscures the sky and veils the light;<BR>
But see, swift winds those clouds dispel<BR>
As if they strove to please me well.<BR>
See, guided in their swift career<BR>
By many a skilful charioteer,<BR>
Those cars by fleetest coursers drawn<BR>
Race onward over glade and lawn.<BR>
Look, startled as the host comes near<BR>
The lovely peacocks fly in fear,<BR>
Gorgeous as if the fairest blooms<BR>
Of earth had glorified their plumes.<BR>
Look where the sheltering covert shows<BR>
The trooping deer, both bucks and does,<BR>
That occupy in countless herds<BR>
This mountain populous with birds.<BR>
Most lovely to my mind appears<BR>
This place which every charm endears:<BR>
Fair as the road where tread the Blest;<BR>
Here holy hermits take their rest,<BR>
Then let the army onward press<BR>
And duly search each green recess<BR>
For the two lion-lords, till we<BR>
R&aacute;ma once more and Lakshman see.'<BR>

<P>
Thus Bharat spoke: and hero bands<BR>
Of men with weapons in their hands<BR>
Entered the tangled forest: then<BR>
A spire of smoke appeared in ken.<BR>
Soon as they saw the rising smoke<BR>
To Bharat they returned and spoke:<BR>
'No fire where men are not: 'tis clear<BR>
That Raghu's sons are dwelling here.<BR>
Or if not here those heros dwell<BR>
Whose mighty arms their foeman quell,<BR>
Still other hermits here must be<BR>
Like R&aacute;ma, true and good as he.'<BR>

<P>
His ears attentive Bharat lent<BR>
To their resistless argument,<BR>
Then to his troops the chief who broke<BR>
His foe's embattled armies spoke:<BR>
'Here let the troops in silence stay;<BR>
One step beyond they must not stray.<BR>
Come Dhrishti and Sumantra, you<BR>
With me alone the path pursue.'<BR>
Their leader's speech the warriors heard,<BR>
And from his place no soldier stirred,<BR>
And Bharat beat his eager eyes<BR>
Where curling smoke was seen to rise.<BR>

<P>
The host his order well obeyed,<BR>
And halting there in silence stayed<BR>
Watching where from the thicket's shade<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They saw the smoke appear.<BR>
And joy through all the army ran,<BR>
'Soon shall we meet,' thought every man,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'The prince we hold so dear.'<BR>
