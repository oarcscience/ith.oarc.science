<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XVI.: R&Aacute;VAN'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Then, while his breast with fury swelled,<BR>
Thus R&aacute;van spoke, as fate impelled:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Better with foes thy dwelling make,<BR>
Or house thee with the venomed snake,<BR>
Than live with false familiar friends<BR>
Who further still thy foeman's ends.<BR>
I know their treacherous mood, I know<BR>
Their secret triumph at thy woe.<BR>
They in their inward hearts despise<BR>
The brave, the noble, and the wise,<BR>
Grieve at their bliss with rancorous hate,<BR>
And for their sorrows watch and wait:<BR>
Scan every fault with curious eye,<BR>
And each slight error magnify.<BR>
Ask elephants who roam the wild<BR>
How were their captive friends beguiled.<BR>
'For fire,' they cry, 'we little care,<BR>
For javelin and shaft and snare:<BR>
Our foes are traitors, taught to bind<BR>
The trusting creatures of their kind.'<BR>
Still, still, shall blessings flow from cows,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_936"></A><A HREF="#fn_936"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And Brahmans love their rigorous vows;<BR>
Still woman change her restless will,<BR>
And friends perfidious work us ill,<BR>
What though with conquering feet I tread<BR>
On every prostrate foeman's head;<BR>
What though the worlds in abject fear<BR>
Their mighty lord in me revere<BR>
This thought my peace of mind destroys<BR>
And robs me of expected joys.<BR>
The lotus of the lake receives<BR>
The glittering rain that gems its leaves,<BR>
But each bright drop remains apart:<BR>
So is it still with heart and heart,<BR>
Deceitful as an autumn cloud<BR>
Which, though its thunderous voice be loud,<BR>
On the dry earth no torrent sends,<BR>
Such is the race of faithless friends,<BR>
No riches of the bloomy spray<BR>
Will tempt the wandering bee to stay<BR>
That loves from flower to flower to range;<BR>
And friends like thee are swift to change,<BR>
Thou blot upon thy glorious line,<BR>
If any giant's tongue but thine<BR>
Had dared to give this base advice,<BR>
He should not live to shame me twice,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then just Vibh&iacute;shan in the heat<BR>
Of anger started from his seat,<BR>
And with four captains of the band<BR>
Sprang forward with his mace in hand;<BR>
Then, fury flashing from his eye,<BR>
Looked on the king and made reply:<BR>

<P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Thy rights, O R&aacute;van, I allow:<BR>
My brother and mine elder thou.<BR>
Such, though from duty's path they stray,<BR>
We love like fathers and obey,<BR>
But still too bitter to be borne<BR>
Is thy harsh speech of cruel scorn.<BR>
The rash like thee, who spurn control,<BR>
Nor check one longing of the soul,<BR>
Urged by malignant fate repel<BR>
The faithful friend who counsels well,<BR>
A thousand courtiers wilt thou meet,<BR>
With flattering lips of smooth deceit;<BR>
But rare are they whose tongue or ear<BR>
Will speak the bitter truth, or hear.<BR>
Unclose thy blinded eyes and see<BR>
That snares of death encompass thee,<BR>
I dread, my brother, to behold<BR>
The shafts of R&aacute;ma, bright with gold,<BR>
Flash fury through the air, and red<BR>
With fires of vengeance strike thee dead,<BR>
Lord, brother, King, again reflect,<BR>
Nor this mine earnest prayer reject,<BR>
O, save thyself, thy royal town,<BR>
Thy people and thine old renown."<BR>
