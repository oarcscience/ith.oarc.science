<P>
The V&aacute;nars saw the giant foe<BR>
Pour from the gate in gallant show,<BR>

<P>
Rejoiced with warriors' fierce delight<BR>
And shouted, longing for the fight.<BR>
Near came the hosts and nearer yet:<BR>
Dire was the tumult as they met,<BR>
As, serried line to line opposed,<BR>
The V&aacute;nars and the giants closed.<BR>
Fierce on the foe the V&aacute;nars rushed,<BR>
And, wielding trees, the foremost crushed;<BR>
But, feathered from the heron's wing,<BR>
With eager flight from sounding string.<BR>
Against them shot with surest aim<BR>
A ceaseless storm of arrows came:<BR>
And, pierced in head and chest and side,<BR>
Full many a V&aacute;nar fell and died.<BR>
They perished slain in fierce attacks<BR>
With sword and pike and battle-axe;<BR>
But myriads following undismayed<BR>
Their valour in the fight displayed.<BR>
Unnumbered V&aacute;nars rent and torn<BR>
With shaft and spear to earth were borne.<BR>
But crashed by branchy trees and blocks<BR>
Of jagged stone and shivered rocks<BR>
Which the wild V&aacute;nars wielded well<BR>
The bravest of the giants fell.<BR>
Their trampled banners strewed the fields,<BR>
And broken swords and spears and shields;<BR>
And, crushed by blows which none might stay,<BR>
Cars, elephants, and riders lay.<BR>
Dh&uacute;mr&aacute;ksha turned his furious eye<BR>
And saw his routed legions fly.<BR>
Still dauntless, with terrific blows,<BR>
He struck and slew his foremost foes.<BR>
At every blow, at every thrust,<BR>
He laid a V&aacute;nar in the dust.<BR>
So fell they neath the sword and lance<BR>
In battle's wild Gandharva &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_971"></A><A HREF="#fn_971"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> dance,<BR>
Where clang of bow and clash of sword<BR>
Did duty for the silvery chord,<BR>
And hoofs that rang and steeds that neighed<BR>
Loud concert for the dancer made.<BR>
So fiercely from Dh&uacute;mr&aacute;ksha's bow<BR>
His arrows rained in ceaseless flow,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar legions turned and fled<BR>
To all the winds discomfited.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n saw the V&aacute;nars fly:<BR>
He heaved a mighty rock on high.<BR>
His keen eyes flashed with wrathful fire,<BR>
And, rapid as the Wind his sire,<BR>
Strong as the rushing tempests are,<BR>
He hurled it at the advancing car.<BR>
Swift through the air the missile sang:<BR>
The giant from the chariot sprang,<BR>
Ere crushed by that terrific blow<BR>
Lay pole and wheel and flag and bow.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n's eyes with fury blazed:<BR>
A mountain's rocky peak he raised,<BR>

<P>

<P>
Poised it on high in act to throw,<BR>
And rushed upon his giant foe.<BR>
Dh&uacute;mr&aacute;ksha saw: he raised his mace<BR>
And smote Han&uacute;m&aacute;n on the face,<BR>
Who maddened by the wound's keen pang<BR>
Again upon his foeman sprang;<BR>
And on the giant's head the rock<BR>
Descended with resistless shock.<BR>
Crushed was each limb: a shapeless mass<BR>
He lay upon the blood-stained grass.<BR>
