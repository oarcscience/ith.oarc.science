<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LIX.: R&Aacute;VANS SALLY.</H3>
<P>
They told him that the chief was killed,<BR>
And R&aacute;van's breast with rage was filled.<BR>
Then, fiercely moved by wrath and pride,<BR>
Thus to his lords the tyrant cried:<BR>

<P>
'No longer, nobles, may we show<BR>
This lofty scorn for such a foe<BR>
By whom our bravest, with his train<BR>
Of steeds and elephants, is slain.<BR>
Myself this day will take the field,<BR>
And Raghu's sons their lives shall yield.'<BR>

<P>
High on the royal car, that glowed<BR>
With glory from his face, he rode;<BR>
And tambour shell and drum pealed out,<BR>
And joyful was each giant's shout.<BR>
A mighty host, with eyeballs red<BR>
Like flames of kindled fire, he led.<BR>
He passed the city gate, and viewed,<BR>
Arrayed, the V&aacute;nar multitude,<BR>
Those wielding massy rocks, and these<BR>
Armed with the stems of uptorn trees,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma with his eyes aglow<BR>
With warlike ardour viewed the foe,<BR>
And thus the brave Vibh&iacute;shan, best<BR>
Of weapon-wielding chiefs, addressed:<BR>
'What captnin leads this bright array<BR>
Where lances gleam and banners play,<BR>
And thousands armed with spear and sword<BR>
Await the bidding of their lord?'<BR>

<P>
'Seest, thou,' Vibh&iacute;shan answered, 'one<BR>
Whose face is as the morning sun,<BR>
Pre&euml;minent for hugest frame?<BR>
Akampan &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_973"></A><A HREF="#fn_973"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is the giant's name<BR>
Behold that chieftain, chariot-borne,<BR>
Whom Brahm&aacute;'s chosen gifts adorn.<BR>
He wields a bow like Indra's own;<BR>
A lion on his flag is shown,<BR>
His eyes with baleful fire are lit:<BR>
'Tis R&aacute;van's son,'tis Indrajit<BR>
There, brandishing in mighty hands<BR>
His huge bow, Atik&aacute;ya stands.<BR>
And that proud warrior o'er whose head<BR>
A moon-bright canopy is spread:<BR>
Whose might, in many a battle tried,<BR>
Has tamed imperial Indra's pride;<BR>
Who wears a crown of burnished gold,<BR>
Is Lank&aacute;'s lord the lofty-souled.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: and R&aacute;ma knew his foe,<BR>
And laid an arrow on his bow:<BR>
'Woe to the wretch,' he ciied, 'whom fate<BR>
Abandons to my deadly hate.'<BR>
He spoke, and, firm by Lakshman's side,<BR>
The giant to the fray defied.<BR>

<P>

<P>
The lord of Lank&aacute; bade his train<BR>
Of warriors by the gates remain,<BR>
To guard the city from surprise<BR>
By R&aacute;ma's forest born allies.<BR>
Then as some monster of the sea<BR>
Cleaves swift-advancimg billows, he<BR>
Charged with impetuous onset through<BR>
The foe, and cleft the host in two.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va ran, the king to meet:<BR>
A hill uprooted from its seat<BR>
He hurled,with trees that graced the height<BR>
Against the rover of the night:<BR>
But cleft with shafts that checked its way<BR>
Harmless upon the earth it lay.<BR>
Then fiercer R&aacute;van's fury grew,<BR>
An arrow from his side he drew,<BR>
Swift as a thunderbolt, aglow<BR>
With fire, and launched it at the foe.<BR>
Through flesh and bone a way it found,<BR>
And stretched Sugr&iacute;va on the ground.<BR>
Sushen and Nala saw him fall,<BR>
Gav&aacute;ksha, Gavaya heard their call,<BR>
And, poising hills, in act * to fling<BR>
They charged amain the giant king.<BR>
They charged, they hurled the hills in vain.<BR>
He checked them with his arrowy rain,<BR>
And every brave assailant felt<BR>
The piercing wounds his missiles dealt,<BR>
Then smitten by the shafts that came<BR>
Keen, fleet, and thick, with certain aim,<BR>
They fled to R&aacute;ma, sure defence<BR>
Against the oppressor's violence,<BR>
Then, reverent palm to palm applied,<BR>
Thus Lakshman to his brother cried:<BR>
'To me, my lord, the task entrust<BR>
To lay this giant in the dust.'<BR>
'Go, then,' said R&aacute;ma, 'bravely fight;<BR>
Beat down this rover of the night.<BR>
But he, unmatched in bold emprise.<BR>
Fears not the Lord of earth and skies,<BR>
Keep on thy guard: with keenest eye<BR>
Thy moments of attack espy.<BR>
Let hand and eye in due accord<BR>
Protect thee with the bow and sword.'<BR>

<P>
Then Lakshman round his brother threw<BR>
His mighty arms in honour due,<BR>
Bent lowly down his reverent head,<BR>
And onward to the battle sped.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n from afar beheld<BR>
How R&aacute;van's shafts the V&aacute;nars quelled:<BR>
To meet the giant's car he ran,<BR>
Raised his right arm and thus began:<BR>
'If Brahm&aacute;'s boon thy life has screened<BR>
From Yaksha, God, Gandharva, fiend.<BR>
With these contending fear no ill,<BR>
But tremble at a V&aacute;nar still.'<BR>
With fury flashing from his eye<BR>
The lord of Lank&aacute; made reply.<BR>
'Strike, V&aacute;nar, strike, the fray begin,<BR>
Aml hope eternal fame to win<BR>
This arm shall pr * thee in the * ??<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_469"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 469</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And end thy glory and thy life.'<BR>
'Remember,' cried the Wind-God's son,<BR>
'Remember all that I have done,<BR>
My prowess, King, thou knowest well,<BR>
Shown in the fight when Aksha &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_974"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> fell.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With heavy hand the giant smote<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n on the chest and throat,<BR>
Who reeled and staggered to and fro,<BR>
Stunned for a moment by the blow.<BR>
Till, mustering strength, his hand he reared<BR>
And struck the foe whom Indra feared.<BR>
His huge limbs bent beneath the shock,<BR>
As mountains, in an earthquake, rock,<BR>
And from the Gods and sages pealed<BR>
Shouts of loud triumph as he reeled.<BR>
But strength returning nerved his frame:<BR>
His eyeballs flashed with fiercer flame.<BR>
No living creature might resist<BR>
That blow of his tremendous fist<BR>
Which fell upon Han&uacute;m&aacute;n's flank:<BR>
And to the ground the V&aacute;nar sank,<BR>
No sign of life his body showed:<BR>
And R&aacute;van in his chariot rode<BR>
At N&iacute;la; and his arrowy rain<BR>
Eell on the captain and his train.<BR>
Fierce N&iacute;la stayed his V&aacute;nar band,<BR>
And, heaving with his single hand<BR>
A mountain peak with vigorous swing<BR>
Hurled the huge missile at the king.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Han&uacute;m&aacute;n life and strength regained,<BR>
Burned for the fight and thus complained:<BR>
'Why, coward giant, didst thou flee<BR>
And leave the doubtful fight with me?'<BR>
Seven mighty arrows keen and fleet<BR>
The giant launched, the hill to meet;<BR>
And, all its force and fury stayed,<BR>
The harmless mass on earth was laid.<BR>
Enraged the V&aacute;nar chief beheld<BR>
The mountain peak by force repelled,<BR>
And rained upon the foe a shower<BR>
Of trees uptorn with branch and flower.<BR>
Still his keen shafts which pierced and rent<BR>
Each flying tree the giant sent:<BR>
Still was the V&aacute;nar doomed to feel<BR>
The tempest of the winged steel.<BR>
Then, smarting from that arrowy storm,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chief condensed his form, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_975"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
And lightly leaping from the ground<BR>
On R&aacute;van's standard footing found;<BR>
Then springing unimpeded down<BR>
Stood on his bow and golden crown.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar's nimble leaps amazed<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's son who stood and gazed.<BR>
The giant, raging in his heart,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Laid on his bow a fiery dart;<BR>
The V&aacute;nar on his flagstaff eyed,<BR>
And thus in tones of fury cried:<BR>
'Well skilled in magic lore art thou:<BR>
But will thine art avail thee now?<BR>
See if thy magic will defend<BR>
Thy life against the dart I send.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;van spake, the giant king,<BR>
And loosed the arrow from the string.<BR>
It pierced, with direst fury sped,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar with its flaming head.<BR>
His father's might, his power innate<BR>
Preserved him from the threatened fate.<BR>
Upon his knees he fell, distained<BR>
With streams of blood, but life remained,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Still R&aacute;van for the battle burned:<BR>
At Lakshman next his car he turned,<BR>
And charged amain with furious show,<BR>
Straining in mighty hands his bow.<BR>
'Come,' Lakshman cried, 'assay the fight:<BR>
Leave foes unworthy of thy might.'<BR>
Thus Lakshman spoke: and Lank&aacute;'s lord<BR>
Heard the dread thunder of the cord,<BR>
And mad with burning rage and pride<BR>
In hasty words like these replied:<BR>
'Joy, joy is mine, O Raghu's son:<BR>
Thy fate to-day thou canst not shun.<BR>
Slain by mine arrows thou shalt tread<BR>
The gloomy pathway of the dead.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus as, he spoke his bow he drew,<BR>
And seven keen shafts at Lakshman flew,<BR>
But Raghu's son with surest aim<BR>
Cleft every arrow as it came.<BR>
Thus with fleet shafts each warrior shot<BR>
Against his foe, and rested not.<BR>
Then one choice weapon from his store,<BR>
By Brahm&aacute;'s self bestowed of yore,<BR>
Fierce as the flames that end the world,<BR>
The giant king at Lakshman hurled.<BR>
The hero fell, and racked with pain,<BR>
Scarce could his hand his bow retain.<BR>
But sense and strength resumed their seat<BR>
And, lightly springing to his feet,<BR>
He struck with one Tremendons stroke<BR>
And R&aacute;van's bow in splinters broke.<BR>
From Lakshmans's cord three arrows flew<BR>
And pierced the giant monarch through.<BR>
Sore wounded R&aacute;van closed, and round<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's son his strong arms wound.<BR>
With strength unrivalled, Brahm&aacute;'s gift,<BR>
He strove from earth his foe to lift.<BR>
'Shall I,' he cried, 'who overthrow<BR>
Mount Meru and the Lord of Snow,<BR>
And heaven and all who dwell therein,<BR>
Be foiled by one of R&aacute;ma's kin?'<BR>
But though he heaved, and toiled, and strained,<BR>
Unmoved Ikshv&aacute;ku's son remained.<BR>
His frame by those huge arms compressed<BR>
The giant's God given *****<BR>
But conscious that himself * was part<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_470"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 470</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Of Vishnu, he was firm in heart.<BR>

<P>
The Wind-God's son the fight beheld,<BR>
And rushed at R&aacute;van, rage-impelled.<BR>
Down crashed his mighty hand the foe<BR>
Full in the chest received the blow.<BR>
His eyes grew dim, his knees gave way,<BR>
And senseless on the earth he lay.<BR>

<P>
The Wind-God's son to R&aacute;ma bore<BR>
Deep-wounded Lakshman stained with gore.<BR>
He whom no foe might lift or bend<BR>
Was light as air to such a friend.<BR>
The dart that Lakshman's side had cleft,<BR>
Untouched, the hero's body left,<BR>
And flushing through the air afar<BR>
Resumed its place in R&aacute;van's car;<BR>
And, waxing well though wounded sore,<BR>
He felt the deadly pain no more.<BR>
And R&aacute;van, though with deep wounds pained,<BR>
Slowly his sense and strength regained,<BR>
And furious still and undismayed<BR>
On bow and shaft his hand he laid.<BR>

<P>
Then Han&uacute;m&aacute;n to R&aacute;ma cried:<BR>
'Ascend my back, great chief, and ride<BR>
Like Vishnu borne on Garud's wing,<BR>
To battle with the giant king.'<BR>
So, burning for the dire attack,<BR>
Rode R&aacute;ma on the V&aacute;nar's back,<BR>
And with fierce accents loud and slow<BR>
Thus gave defiance to the foe,<BR>
While his strained bowstring made a sound<BR>
Like thunder when it shakes the ground:<BR>
'Stay, Monarch of the giants, stay,<BR>
The penalty of sin to pay.<BR>
Stay! whither wilt thou fly, and how<BR>
Escape the death that waits thee now?'<BR>

<P>
No word the giant king returned:<BR>
His eyes with flames of fury burned.<BR>
His arm was stretched, his bow was bent,<BR>
And swift his fiery shafts were sent.<BR>
Red torrents from the V&aacute;nar flowed:<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma near to R&aacute;van strode,<BR>
And with keen darts that never failed,<BR>
The chariot of the king assailed.<BR>
With surest aim his arrows flew:<BR>
The driver and the steeds he slew.<BR>
And shattered with the pointed steel<BR>
Car, flag, and pole and yoke and wheel.<BR>
As Indra hurls his bolt to smite<BR>
Mount Meru's heaven-ascending height,<BR>
So R&aacute;ma with a flaming dart<BR>
Struck Lank&aacute;'s monarch near the heart,<BR>
Who reeled and fell beneath the blow<BR>
And from loose fingers dropped his bow.<BR>
Bright as the sun, with crescent head,<BR>
From R&aacute;ma's bow an arrow sped,<BR>
And from his forehead, proud no more,<BR>
Cleft the bright coronet he wore.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma stood by R&aacute;van's side<BR>
And to the conquered giant cried:<BR>
'Well hast thou fought: thine arm has slain<BR>
Strong heroes of the V&aacute;nar train.<BR>
I will not strike or slay thee now,<BR>
For weary, faint with fight art thou.<BR>
To Lank&aacute;'s town thy footsteps bend,<BR>
And there the night securely spend.<BR>
To-morrow come with car and bow,<BR>
And then my prowess shall thou know.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: the king in humbled pride<BR>
Rose from the earth and naught replied.<BR>
With wounded limbs and shattered crown<BR>
He sought again his royal town.<BR>
