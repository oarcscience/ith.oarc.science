<P>
'What further deed remains to do<BR>
To vex the R&aacute;kshas king anew?<BR>
The beauty of his grove is marred,<BR>
Killed are the bravest of his guard.<BR>
The captains of his host are slain;<BR>
But forts and palaces remain.<BR>
Swift is the work and light the toil<BR>
Each fortress of the foe to spoil.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Reflecting thus, his tale ablaze<BR>
As through the cloud red lightning plays,<BR>
He scaled the palaces and spread<BR>
The conflagration where he sped.<BR>
From house to house he hurried on,<BR>
And the wild flames behind him shone.<BR>
Each mansion of the foe he scaled,<BR>
And furious fire its roof assailed<BR>
Till all the common ruin shared:<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan's house alone was spared.<BR>
From blazing pile to pile he sprang,<BR>
And loud his shout of triumph rang,<BR>
As roars the doomsday cloud when all<BR>
The worlds in dissolution fall.<BR>
The friendly wind conspired to fan<BR>
The hungry flames that leapt and ran,<BR>
And spreading in their fury caught<BR>
The gilded walls with pearls inwrought,<BR>
Till each proud palace reeled and fell<BR>
As falls a heavenly citadel.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Loud was the roar the demons raised<BR>
Mid walls that split and beams that blazed,<BR>
As each with vain endeavour strove<BR>
To stay the flames in house or grove.<BR>
The women, with dishevelled hair,<BR>
Flocked to the roofs in wild despair,<BR>
Shrieked out for succour, wept aloud,<BR>
And fell, like lightning from a cloud.<BR>
He saw the flames ascend and curl<BR>
Round turkis, diamond, and pearl,<BR>
While silver floods and molten gold<BR>
From ruined wall and latice rolled.<BR>
As fire grows fiercer as he feeds<BR>
On wood and grass and crackling reeds,<BR>
So Hanum&aacute;n the ruin eyed<BR>
With fury still unsatisfied.<BR>
