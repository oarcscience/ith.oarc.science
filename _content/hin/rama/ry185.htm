<P>
Thus, by his friends encompassed round,<BR>
He spoke, and R&aacute;ma, far renowned,<BR>
To his dear brother thus replied,<BR>
Whom holy rites had purified:<BR>
'O thou whom Queen Kaikeyi bare<BR>
The best of kings, thy words are fair.<BR>
Our royal father, when of yore<BR>
He wed her, to her father swore<BR>
The best of kingdoms to confer,<BR>
A noble dowry meet for her;<BR>
Then, grateful, on the deadly day<BR>
Of heavenly Gods' and demons' fray,<BR>
A future boon on her bestowed<BR>
To whose sweet care his life he owed.<BR>
She to his mind that promise brought,<BR>
And then the best of kings besought<BR>
To bid me to the forest flee,<BR>
And give the rule, O Prince, to thee.<BR>
Thus bound by oath, the king our lord<BR>
Gave her those boons of free accord.<BR>
And bade me, O thou chief of men,<BR>
Live in the woods four years and ten.<BR>
I to this lonely wood have hied<BR>
With faithful Lakshman by my side,<BR>
And Si*t&aacute; by no tears deterred,<BR>
Resolved to keep my father's word.<BR>
And thou, my noble brother, too<BR>
Shouldst keep our father's promise true:<BR>
Anointed ruler of the state<BR>
Maintain his word inviolate.<BR>
From his great debt, dear brother, free<BR>
Our lord the king for love of me,<BR>
Thy mother's breast with joy inspire,<BR>
And from all woe preserve thy sire.<BR>
*Tis said, near Gay&aacute;'s holy town &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_385"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Gay&aacute;, great *saint of high renown,<BR>
This text recited when he paid<BR>
Due rites to each ancestral shade:<BR>

<P>
&nbsp; 'A son is born his sire to free<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   From Put's infernal pains:<BR>
&nbsp; Hence, saviour of his father, he<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The name of Puttra gains.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_386"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Thus numerous sons are sought by prayer,<BR>
In Scripture trained with graces fair,<BR>

<P>
That of the number one some day<BR>
May funeral rites at Gay&aacute; pay.<BR>
The mighty saints who lived of old<BR>
This holy doctrine ever hold.<BR>
Then, best of men, our sire release<BR>
From pains of hell, and give him peace.<BR>
Now Bharat, to Ayodhya* speed,<BR>
The brave S'atrughna with thee lead.<BR>
Take with thee all the twice-born men,<BR>
And please each lord and citizen.<BR>
I now, O King, without delay<BR>
To Dandak* wood will bend my way,<BR>
And Lakshman and the Maithil dame<BR>
Will follow still, our path the same.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now, Bharat, lord of men be thou,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And o'er Ayodhy&aacute; reign:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The silvan world to me shall bow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    King of the wild domain.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yea, let thy joyful steps be bent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To that fair town to-day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And I as happy and content,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To Dandak wood will stray.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The white umbrella o'er thy brow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Its cooling shade shall throw:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  I to the shadow of the bough<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And leafy trees will go.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  S'atrughna, for wise plans renowned,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Shall still on thee attend;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And Lakshman, ever faithful found,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Be my familiar friend.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Let us his sons, O brother dear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The path of right pursue,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And keep the king we all revere<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Still to his promise true.'<BR>
