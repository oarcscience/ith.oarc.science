<P>
Then to the saint supremely wise<BR>
King Janak spoke in suppliant guise:<BR>
'Deign, Hermit, with attentive ear,<BR>
Mv race's origin to hear.<BR>
When kings a daughter's hand bestow,<BR>
'Tis right their line and fame to show.<BR>
There was a king whose deeds and worth<BR>
Spread wide his name through heaven and earth,<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>
Nimi, most virtuous e'en from youth,<BR>
The best of all who love the truth,<BR>
His son and heir was Mithi, and<BR>
His Janak, first who ruled this land.<BR>
He left a son Ud&aacute;vasu,<BR>
Blest with all virtues, good and true.<BR>
His son was Nandivardhan, dear<BR>
For pious heart and worth sincere.<BR>
His son Suketu, hero brave,<BR>
To Devar&aacute;t, existence gave.<BR>
King Devar&aacute;t, a royal sage,<BR>
For virtue, glory of the age,<BR>
Begot Vrihadratha; and he<BR>
Begot, his worthy heir to be,<BR>
The splendid hero Mah&aacute;bir<BR>
Who long in glory governed here.<BR>
His son was Sudhriti, a youth<BR>
Firm in his purpose, brave in sooth,<BR>
His son was Dhristaketu, blest<BR>
With pious will and holy breast.<BR>
The fame of royal saint he won:<BR>
Haryas'va was his princely son.<BR>
Haryas'va's son was Maru, who<BR>
Begot Prat&iacute;ndhak, wise and true.<BR>
Next K&iacute;rtiratha held the throne,<BR>
His son, for gentle virtues known.<BR>
Then followed Devamidha, then<BR>
Vibudh, Mah&aacute;ndhrak, kings of men.<BR>
Mah&aacute;ndhrak's son, of boundless might,<BR>
Was K&iacute;rtir&aacute;t, who loved the right.<BR>
He passed away, a sainted king,<BR>
And Mah&aacute;rom&aacute; following<BR>
To Swarnarom&aacute; left the state.<BR>
Then Hras'varom&aacute;, good and great,<BR>
Succeeded, and to him a pair<BR>
Of sons his royal consort bare,<BR>
Elder of these I boast to be:<BR>
Brave Kus'adhwaj is next to me. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_251"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Me then, the elder of the twain,<BR>
My sire anointed here to reign.<BR>
He bade me tend my brother well,<BR>
Then to the forest went to dwell.<BR>
He sought the heavens, and I sustained<BR>
The burden as by law ordained,<BR>
And noble Kus'adhwaj, the peer<BR>
Of Gods, I ever held most dear.<BR>
Then came S&aacute;nk&aacute;s'y&aacute;'s mighty lord,<BR>
Sudhanv&aacute;, threatening siege and sword,<BR>
And bade me swift on him bestow<BR>
S'iva's incomparable bow,<BR>

<P>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; of the lotus eyes:<BR>
But I refused each peerless prize.<BR>
Then, host to host, we met the foes,<BR>
And fierce the din of battle rose,<BR>
Sudhanv&aacute;, foremost of his band,<BR>
Fell smitten by my single hand.<BR>
When thus S&aacute;nk&aacute;s'y&aacute;'s lord was slain,<BR>
I sanctified, as laws ordain,<BR>
My brother in his stead to reign,<BR>
Thus are we brothers, Saint most high<BR>
The younger he, the elder I.<BR>
Now, mighty Sage, my spirit joys<BR>
To give these maidens to the boys.<BR>
Let S&iacute;t&aacute; be to R&aacute;ma tied.<BR>
And Urmil&aacute; be Lakshman's bride.<BR>
First give, O King, the gift of cows,<BR>
As dowry of each royal spouse,<BR>
Due offerings to the spirits pay,<BR>
And solemnize the wedding-day.<BR>
The moon tonight, O royal Sage,<BR>
In Magh&aacute;'s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="ry072.htm#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> House takes harbourage;<BR>
On the third night his rays benign<BR>
In second Ph&aacute;lguni&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="ry072.htm#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> will shine:<BR>
Be that the day, with prosperous fate,<BR>
The nuptial rites to celebrate.'<BR>

genealogies the Bengal recension varies
but slightly from the Northern. The first
six names of the genealogy of the Kings
of Ayodhy&aacute; are partly theogonical and
partly cosmogonical; the other names are
no doubt in accordance with tradition and
deserve the same amount of credence as
the ancient traditional genealogies of
other nations.' GORRESIO.</P>
