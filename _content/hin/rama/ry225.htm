<P>
But Tris'iras,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_472"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> a chieftain dread,<BR>
Marked Khara as he onward sped.<BR>
And met his car and cried, to stay<BR>
The giant from the purposed fray:<BR>
'Mine be the charge: let me attack,<BR>
And turn thee from the contest back.<BR>
Let me go forth, and thou shalt see<BR>
The strong-armed R&aacute;ma slain by me.<BR>
True are the words I speak, my lord:<BR>
I swear it as I touch my sword:<BR>
That I this R&aacute;ma's blood will spill,<BR>
Whom every giant's hand should kill.<BR>
This R&aacute;ma will I slay, or he<BR>
In battle fray shall conquer me.<BR>
Restrain thy spirit: check thy car,<BR>
And view tne combat from afar.<BR>
Thou, joying o'er the prostrate foe,<BR>
To Janasth&aacute;n again shalt go,<BR>
Or, if I fall in battle's chance,<BR>
Against my conqueror advance.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Tris'iras for death who yearned:<BR>
And Khara from the conflict turned,<BR>
'Go forth to battle,' Khara cried;<BR>
And toward his foe the giant hied.<BR>
Borne on a car of glittering hue<BR>
Which harnessed coursers fleetly drew,<BR>
Like some huge hill with triple peak<BR>
He onward rushed the prince to seek,<BR>

Still, like a big cloud, sending out<BR>
His arrowy rain with many a shout<BR>
Like the deep sullen roars that come<BR>
Discordant from a moistened drum.<BR>
But Raghu's son, whose watchful eye<BR>
Beheld the demon rushing nigh,<BR>
From the great bow he raised and bent<BR>
A shower of shafts to meet him sent.<BR>
Wild grew the fight and wilder yet<BR>
As fiend and man in combat met,<BR>
As when in some dark wood's retreat<BR>
An elephant and a lion meet.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The giant bent his bow, and true<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's brow three arrows flew.<BR>
Then, raging as he felt the stroke,<BR>
These words in anger R&aacute;ma spoke:<BR>
'Heroic chief! is such the power<BR>
Of fiends who rove at midnight hour?<BR>
Soft as the touch of flowers I feel<BR>
The gentle blows thine arrows deal.<BR>
Receive in turn my shafts, and know<BR>
What arrows fly from R&aacute;ma's bow.'<BR>
Thus as he spoke his wrath grew hot.<BR>
And twice seven deadly shafts he shot,<BR>
Which, dire as serpent's deadly fang,<BR>
Straight to the giant's bosom sprang.<BR>
Four arrows more,--each shaped to deal<BR>
A mortal wound with barb&egrave;d steel,--<BR>
The glorious hero shot, and slew<BR>
The four good steeds the car that drew.<BR>
Eight other shafts flew straight and fleet,<BR>
And hurled the driver from his seat,<BR>
And in the dust the banner laid<BR>
That proudly o'er the chariot played.<BR>
Then as the fiend prepared to bound<BR>
Forth from his useless car to ground,<BR>
The hero smote him to the heart,<BR>
And numbed his arm with deadly smart.<BR>
Again the chieftain, peerless-souled,<BR>
Seat forth three rapid darts, and rolled<BR>
With each keen arrow, deftly sped,<BR>
Low in the dust a monstrous head.<BR>
Then yielding to each deadly stroke,<BR>
Forth spouting streams of blood and smoke,<BR>
The headless trunk bedrenched with gore<BR>
Fell to the ground and moved no more.<BR>
The fiends who yet were left with life,<BR>
Routed and crushed in battle strife,<BR>
To Khara's side, like trembling deer<BR>
Scared by the hunter, fled in fear.<BR>
King Khara saw with furious eye<BR>
His scattered giants turn and fly;<BR>
Then rallying his broken train<BR>
At Raghu's son he drove amain,<BR>
Like R&aacute;hu &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_473"></A><A HREF="#fn_473"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> when his deadly might<BR>
Comes rushing on the Lord of Night.<BR>
