With angry menace Rama, best<BR>
Of Raghu's sons, the Sea addressed:<BR>
'With fiery flood of arrowy rain<BR>
Thy channels will I dry and drain.<BR>
And I and all the V&aacute;nnr host<BR>
Will reach on foot the farther coast.<BR>
Thou shalt not from destruction save<BR>
The creatures of the teeming wave,<BR>
And lapse of time shall ne'er efface<BR>
The memory of the dire disgrace'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spoke the warrior, and prepared<BR>
The mortal shaft which never spared,<BR>
Known mystic weapon, by the name<BR>
Of Brahma, red with quenchless flarme<BR>
Great terror, as he strained the bow,<BR>
Struck heaven above and earth below<BR>
Through echoing skies the thunder pealed<BR>
And startled mountains rocked and reeled<BR>
The earth was black with sudden night<BR>
And heaven was blotted from the sight.<BR>
Then ever and anon the glare<BR>
Of meteors shot through murky air,<BR>
And with a wild terrific sound<BR>
Red lightnings struck the trembling ground.<BR>
In furious gusts the fierce wind blew:<BR>
Tall trees it shattered and overthrew,<BR>
And, smiting with a giant's stroke,<BR>
Huge masses from the mountain broke.<BR>
A cry of terror long and shrill<BR>
Came from each valley, plain, and hill.<BR>
Each ruined dale, each riven peak<BR>
Re-echoed with a wail or shriek.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  While Ragbu's son undaunted gazed<BR>
The waters of the deep were raised,<BR>
And, still uplifted more and more,<BR>
Leapt in wild flood upon the shore.<BR>
Still R&aacute;ma looked upon the tide<BR>
And kept his post unterrified.<BR>
Then from the seething flood upreared<BR>
Majestic Ocean's form appeared,<BR>
As rising from his eastern height<BR>
Springs through the sky the Lord of Light.<BR>
Attendant on their monarch came<BR>
Sea serpents with their eyes aflame.<BR>
Like lazulite mid burning gold<BR>
His form was wondrous to behold.<BR>
Bright with each fairest precious stone<BR>
A chain about his neck was thrown.<BR>
Calm shone his lotus eyes beneath<BR>
The blossoms of his heavenly wreath,<BR>
And many a pearl and sea-born gem<BR>
Flashed in the monarch's diadem.<BR>
There Gang&aacute;, tributary queen.<BR>
And Sindhu &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_944"></A><A HREF="#fn_944"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> by his lord, were seen,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_444"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 444</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And every stream and brook renowned<BR>
In ancient story girt him round.<BR>
Then, as the waters rose and swelled,<BR>
The king with suppliant hands upheld,<BR>
His glorious head to R&aacute;ma bent<BR>
And thus addressed him reverent:<BR>
'Air, ether, fire, earth, water, true<BR>
To nature's will, their course pursue;<BR>
And I, as ancient laws ordain,<BR>
Unfordable must still remain.<BR>
Yet, Raghu's son, my counsel hear:<BR>
I ne'er for love or hope or fear<BR>
Will pile my waters in a heap<BR>
And leave a pathway through the deep.<BR>
Still shall my care for thee provide<BR>
An easy passage o'er the tide,<BR>
And like a city's paven street<BR>
Shall be the road beneath thy feet.'<BR>
He ceased: and R&aacute;ma spoke again:<BR>
'This spell is ne'er invoked in vain.<BR>
Where shall the magic shaft, to spend<BR>
The fury of its might, descend?'<BR>
'Shoot,' Ocean cried, 'thine arrow forth<BR>
With all its fury to the north.<BR>
Where sacred Drumakulya lies,<BR>
Whose glory with thy glory vies,<BR>
There dwells a wild Abh&iacute;ra &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_945"></A><A HREF="#fn_945"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> race,<BR>
As vile in act as foul of face,<BR>
Fierce Dasyus &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_946"></A><A HREF="#fn_946"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who delight in ill,<BR>
And drink my tributary rill.<BR>
My soul no longer may endure<BR>
Their neighbourhood and touch impure.<BR>
At these, O son of Raghu, aim<BR>
Thine arrow with the quenchless flame.'<BR>
&nbsp; Swift from the bow, as R&aacute;ma drew<BR>
His cord, the fiery arrow flew.<BR>
Earth groaned to feel the wound, and sent<BR>
A rush of water through the rent;<BR>
And famed for ever is the well<BR>
Of Vrana &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_947"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> where the arrow fell.<BR>
Then every brook and lake beside<BR>
Throughout the region R&aacute;ma dried.<BR>
But yet he gave a boon to bless<BR>
And fertilize the wilderness:<BR>
No fell disease should taint the air,<BR>
And sheep and kine should prosper there:<BR>
Earth should produce each pleasant root,<BR>
The stately trees should bend with fruit;<BR>
Oil, milk, and honey should abound,<BR>
And fragrant herbs should clothe the<BR>
&nbsp; ground.<BR>
Then spake the king of brooks and seas<BR>
To Raghu's son in words like these:<BR>
'Now let a wondrous task be done<BR>
By Nala, Vis'vakarm&aacute;'s son.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Who, born of one of V&aacute;nar race,<BR>
Inherits by his father's grace<BR>
A share of his celestial art.<BR>
Call Nala to perform his part,<BR>
And he, divinely taught and skilled,<BR>
A bridge athwart the sea shall build.'<BR>
&nbsp; He spoke and vanished Nala, best<BR>
Of V&aacute;nar chiefs, the king addressed:<BR>
'O'er the deep sea where monsters play<BR>
A bridge, O R&aacute;ma, will I lay;<BR>
For, sharer of my father's skill,<BR>
Mine is the power and mine the will.<BR>
'Tis vain to try each gentler art<BR>
To bribe and soothe the thankless heart;<BR>
In vain on such is mercy spent;<BR>
It yields to naught but punishment.<BR>
Through fear alone will Ocean now<BR>
A passage o'er his waves allow.<BR>
My mother, ere she bore her son,<BR>
This boon from Vis'vakarm&aacute; won:<BR>
'O Mandari, thy child shall be<BR>
In skill and glory next to me.'<BR>
But why unbidden should I fill<BR>
Thine ear with praises of my skill?<BR>
Command the V&aacute;nar hosts to lay<BR>
Foundations for the bridge to-day.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke: and swift at R&aacute;ma's best<BR>
Up sprang the V&aacute;nars from their rest,<BR>
The mandate of the king obeyed<BR>
And sought the forest's mighty shade.<BR>
Unrooted trees to earth they threw,<BR>
And to the sea the timber drew.<BR>
The stately palm was bowed and bent,<BR>
As'okas from the ground were rent,<BR>
And towering S&aacute;ls and light bamboos,<BR>
And trees with flowers of varied hues,<BR>
With loveliest creepers wreathed and crowned,<BR>
Shook, reeled, and fell upon the ground.<BR>
With mighty engines piles of stone<BR>
And seated hills were overthrown:<BR>
Unprisoned waters sprang on high,<BR>
In rain descending from the sky:<BR>
And ocean with a roar and swell<BR>
Heaved wildly when the mountains fell.<BR>
Then the great bridge of wondrous strength<BR>
Was built, a hundred leagues in length.<BR>
Rocks huge as autumn clouds bound fast<BR>
With cordage from the shore were cast,<BR>
And fragments of each riven hill,<BR>
And trees whose flowers adorned them still.<BR>
Wild was the tumult, loud the din<BR>
As ponderous rocks went thundering in.<BR>
Ere set of sun, so toiled each crew,<BR>
Ten leagues and four the structure grew;<BR>
The labours of the second day<BR>
Gave twenty more of ready way,<BR>
And on the fifth, when sank the sun,<BR>
The whole stupendous work was done.<BR>
O'er the broad way the V&aacute;nars sped,<BR>
Nor swayed it with their countless tread.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_445"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 445</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Exultant on the ocean strand<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan stood, and, mace in hand,<BR>
Longed eager for the onward way,<BR>
And chafed impatient at delay.<BR>
Then thus to R&aacute;ma trained and tried<BR>
In battle King Sugr&iacute;va cried:<BR>
'Come, Hauum&aacute;n's broad back ascend;<BR>
Let Angad help to Lakshman lend.<BR>
These high above the sea shall bear<BR>
Their burthen through the ways of air.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  So, with Sugr&iacute;va, borne o'erhead<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's sons the legions led.<BR>
Behind, the V&aacute;nar hosts pursued<BR>
Their march in endless multitude.<BR>
Some skimmed the surface of the wave,<BR>
To some the air a passage gave.<BR>
Amid their ceaseless roar the sound<BR>
Of Ocean's fearful voice was drowned,<BR>
As o'er the bridge by Nala planned<BR>
They hastened on to Lank&aacute;'s strand,<BR>
Where, by the pleasant brooks, mid trees<BR>
Loaded with fruit, they took their ease.<BR>
