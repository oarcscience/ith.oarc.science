<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXIII.: THE HERMIT'S SON.</H3>
<P>
But soon by rankling grief oppressed<BR>
The king awoke from troubled rest,<BR>
And his sad heart was tried again<BR>
With anxious thought where all was pain.<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman's mournful fate<BR>
On Das'aratha, good and great<BR>
As Indra, pressed with crushing weight,<BR>
As when the demon's might assails<BR>
The Sun-God, and his glory pales.<BR>
Ere yet the sixth long night was spent.<BR>
Since Rama to the woods was sent,<BR>
The king at midnight sadly thought<BR>
Of the old crime his hand had wrought,<BR>
And thus to Queen Kausaly&aacute; cried<BR>
Who still for R&aacute;ma moaned and sighed:<BR>
'If thou art waking, give, I pray,<BR>
Attention to the words I say.<BR>
Whate'er the conduct men pursue,<BR>
Be good or ill the acts they do,<BR>
Be sure, dear Queen, they find the meed<BR>
Of wicked or of virtuous deed.<BR>
A heedless child we call the man<BR>
Whose feeble judgment fails to scan<BR>
The weight of what his hands may do,<BR>
Its lightness, fault, and merit too.<BR>
One lays the Mango garden low,<BR>
And bids the gay Pal&aacute;s'as grow:<BR>
Longing for fruit their bloom he sees,<BR>
But grieves when fruit should bend the trees.<BR>
Cut by my hand, my fruit-trees fell,<BR>
Pal&aacute;s'a trees I watered well.<BR>
My hopes this foolish heart deceive,<BR>
And for my banished son I grieve.<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;, in my youthful prime<BR>
Armed with my bow I wrought the crime,<BR>
Proud of my skill, my name renowned,<BR>
An archer prince who shoots by sound.<BR>
The deed this hand unwitting wrought<BR>
This misery on my soul has brought,<BR>
As children seize the deadly cup<BR>
And blindly drink the poison up.<BR>
As the unreasoning man may be<BR>
Charmed with the gay Pal&aacute;s'a tree,<BR>
I unaware have reaped the fruit<BR>
Of joying at a sound to shoot.<BR>
As regent prince I shared the throne.<BR>
Thou wast a maid to me unknown.<BR>
The early Rain-time duly came,<BR>
And strengthened love's delicious flame.<BR>
The sun had drained the earth that lay<BR>
All glowing 'neath the summer day,<BR>
And to the gloomy clime had fled<BR>
Where dwell the spirits of the dead. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The fervent heat that moment ceased.<BR>
The darkening clouds each hour increased<BR>
And frogs and deer and peacocks all<BR>
Rejoiced to see the torrents fall.<BR>
Their bright wings heavy from the shower,<BR>
The birds, new-bathed, had scarce the power<BR>
To reach the branches of the trees<BR>
Whose high tops swayed beneath the breeze.<BR>
The fallen rain, and falling still,<BR>
Hung like a sheet on every hill,<BR>
Till, with glad deer, each flooded steep<BR>
Showed glorious as the mighty deep.<BR>
The torrents down its wooded side<BR>
Poured, some unstained, while others dyed<BR>

<P>
Gold, ashy, silver, ochre, bore<BR>
The tints of every mountain ore.<BR>
In that sweet time, when all are pleased,<BR>
My arrows and my bow I seized;<BR>
Keen for the chase, in field or grove,<BR>
Down Sarj&uacute;'s bank my car I drove.<BR>
I longed with all my lawless will<BR>
Some elephant by night to kill,<BR>
Some buffalo that came to drink,<BR>
Or tiger, at the river's brink.<BR>
When all around was dark and still,<BR>
I heard a pitcher slowly fill,<BR>
And thought, obscured in deepest shade,<BR>
An elephant the sound had made.<BR>
I drew a shaft that glittered bright,<BR>
Fell as a serpent's venomed bite;<BR>
I longed to lay the monster dead,<BR>
And to the mark my arrow sped.<BR>
Then in the calm of morning, clear<BR>
A hermit's wailing smote my ear:<BR>
'Ah me, ah me,' he cried, and sank,<BR>
Pierced by my arrow, on the bank.<BR>
E'en as the weapon smote his side,<BR>
I heard a human voice that cried:<BR>
'Why lights this shaft on one like me,<BR>
A poor and harmless devotee?<BR>
I came by night to fill my jar<BR>
From this lone stream where no men are.<BR>
Ah, who this deadly shaft has shot<BR>
Whom have I wronged, and knew it not?<BR>
Why should a boy so harmless feel<BR>
The vengeance of the winged steel?<BR>
Or who should slay the guiltless son<BR>
Of hermit sire who injures none,<BR>
Who dwells retired in woods, and there<BR>
Supports his life on woodland fare?<BR>
Ah me, ah me, why am I slain,<BR>
What booty will the murderer gain?<BR>
In hermit coils I bind my hair,<BR>
Coats made of skin and bark I wear.<BR>
Ah, who the cruel deed can praise<BR>
Whose idle toil no fruit repays,<BR>
As impious as the wretch's crime<BR>
Who dares his master's bed to climb?<BR>
Nor does my parting spirit grieve<BR>
But for the life which thus I leave:<BR>
Alas, my mother and my sire,--<BR>
I mourn for them when I expire.<BR>
Ah me, that aged, helpless pair,<BR>
Long cherished by my watchful care,<BR>
How will it be with them this day<BR>
When to the Five&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I pass away?<BR>
Pierced by the self-same dust we die,<BR>
Mine aged mother, sire, and I.<BR>
Whose mighty hand, whose lawless mind<BR>
Has all the three to death consigned!'<BR>

<P>
When I, by love of duty stirred,<BR>
That touching lamentation heard,<BR>


<P>


<P>
Pierced to the heart by sudden woe,<BR>
I threw to earth my shafts and bow.<BR>
My heart was full of grief and dread<BR>
As swiftly to the place I sped,<BR>
Where, by my arrow wounded sore,<BR>
A hermit lay on Sarj&uacute;'s shore.<BR>
His matted hair was all unbound.<BR>
His pitcher empty on the ground,<BR>
And by the fatal arrow pained,<BR>
He lay with dust and gore distained.<BR>
I stood confounded and amazed:<BR>
His dying eyes to mine he raised,<BR>
And spoke this speech in accents stern,<BR>
As though his light my soul would burn:<BR>
'How have I wronged thee, King, that I<BR>
Struck by thy mortal arrow die?<BR>
The wood my home, this jar I brought,<BR>
And water for my parents sought.<BR>
This one keen shaft that strikes me through<BR>
Slays sire and aged mother too.<BR>
Feeble and blind, in helpless pain,<BR>
They wait for me and thirst in vain.<BR>
They with parched lips their pangs must bear,<BR>
And hope will end in blank despair.<BR>
Ah me, there seems no fruit in store<BR>
For holy zeal or Scripture lore,<BR>
Or else ere now my sire would know<BR>
That his dear son is lying low.<BR>
Yet, if my mournful fate he knew,<BR>
What could his arm so feeble do?<BR>
The tree, firm-rooted, ne'er may be<BR>
The guardian of a stricken tree.<BR>
Haste to my father, and relate<BR>
While time allows, my sudden fate,<BR>
Lest he consume thee as the fire<BR>
Burns up the forest, in his ire.<BR>
This little path, O King, pursue:<BR>
My father's cot thou soon wilt view.<BR>
There sue for pardon to the sage.<BR>
Lest he should curse thee in his rage.<BR>
First from the wound extract the dart<BR>
That kills me with its deadly smart,<BR>
E'en as the flushed impetuous tide<BR>
Eats through the river's yielding side.'<BR>

<P>
I feared to draw the arrow out,<BR>
And pondered thus in painful doubt:<BR>
'Now tortured by the shaft he lies,<BR>
But if I draw it forth he dies.'<BR>
Helpless I stood, faint, sorely grieved:<BR>
The hermit's son my thought perceived;<BR>
As one  o'ercome by direst pain<BR>
He scarce had strength to speak again.<BR>
With writhing limb and struggling breath,<BR>
Nearer and ever nearer death<BR>
My senses undisturbed remain,<BR>
And fortitude has conquered pain:<BR>
Now from  one tear thy soul be freed.<BR>
Thy hand has made a Br&aacute;hman bleed.<BR>
Let not this pang thy bosom wring:<BR>
No twice-born youth am I, O King,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
For of a Vais'ya sire I came,<BR>
Who wedded with a S'udr&aacute; dame.<BR>

<P>
These words the boy could scarcely say,<BR>
As tortured by the shaft he lay.<BR>
Twisting his helpless body round,<BR>
Then trembling senseless on the ground.<BR>
Then from his bleeding side I drew<BR>
The rankling shaft that pierced him through.<BR>
With death's last fear my face he eyed,<BR>
And, rich in store of penance, died.'<BR>
