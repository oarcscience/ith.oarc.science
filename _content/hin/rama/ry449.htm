<P>
Sugr&iacute;va viewed the flying crowd,<BR>
And thus to Angad cried aloud:<BR>
'Why run the trembling hosts, as flee<BR>
Storm-scattered barks across the sea?'<BR>
'Dost thou not mark,' the chief replied,<BR>
Transfixed with shafts, with bloodstreams dyed,<BR>
With arrowy toils about them wound,<BR>
The sons of Raghu on the ground?'<BR>

<P>
That moment brought Viohishan* near.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va knew the cause of fear,<BR>
And ordered J&aacute;mbavan, who led<BR>
The bears, to check the hosts that fled.<BR>
The king of bears his hest obeyed:<BR>
The Vanars' headlong flight was stayed<BR>
A little while Vibhishan eyed<BR>
The brothers fallen side by side.<BR>
His giant fingers wet with dew<BR>
Across the heroes' eyes he drew,<BR>
Still on the pair his sad look bent,<BR>
And spoke these word in wild lament:<BR>
'Ah for the mighty chiefs brought low<BR>
By coward hand and stealthy blow!<BR>
Brave pair who loved the open fight,<BR>

<P>
Slain by that rover of the night.<BR>
Dishonest is the victory won<BR>
By Indrajit my brother's son.<BR>
I on their might for aid relied,<BR>
And in my cause they fought and died.<BR>
Lost is the hope that soothed each pain:<BR>
I live, but live no more to reign,<BR>
While Lank&aacute;'s lord, untouched by ill,<BR>
Exults in safe defiance still.'<BR>

<P>
'Not thus,' Sugr&iacute;va said, 'repine,<BR>
For Lank&aacute;'s isle shall still be thine.<BR>
Nor let the tyrant and his son<BR>
Exult before the fight be done,<BR>
These royal chiefs, though now dismayed,<BR>
Freed from the spell by Garud'a aid,<BR>
Triumphant yet the foe shall meet<BR>
And lay the robber at their feet.'<BR>

<P>
His hope the V&aacute;nar monarch told,<BR>
And thus Vibh&iacute;shan's grief consoled.<BR>
Then to Sushen who at his side<BR>
Expectant stood, Sugr&iacute;va cried:<BR>
'When these regain their strength and sense,<BR>
Fly, bear them to Kishkindh&aacute; hence.<BR>
Here with my legions will I stay,<BR>
The tyrant and his kinsmen slay,<BR>
And rescued from the giant king.<BR>
The Maithil lady will I bring,<BR>
Like Glory lost of old, restored<BR>
By S'akra, heaven's almighty lord.'<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Sushen made answer: 'Hear me yet:<BR>
When Gods and fiends in battle met,<BR>
So fiercely fought the demon crew,<BR>
So wild a storm of arrows flew,<BR>
That heavenly warriors faint with pain,<BR>
Sank smitten by the ceaseless rain.<BR>
Vrihaspati, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_969"></A><A HREF="#fn_969"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with herb and spell,<BR>
Cured the sore wounds of those who fell.<BR>
And, skilled in arts that heal and save,<BR>
New life and sense and vigour gave.<BR>
Far, on the Milky Ocean's shore,<BR>
Still grow those herbs in boundless store;<BR>
Let swiftest V&aacute;nars thither speed<BR>
And bring them for our utmost need.<BR>
Those herbs that on the mountain spring<BR>
Let Panas and Samp&aacute;ti bring,<BR>
For well the wondrous leaves they know.<BR>
That heal each wound and life bestow.<BR>
Beside that sea which, churned of yore,<BR>
The amrit on its surface bore,<BR>
Where the white billows lash the land,<BR>
Chandra's fair height and Drona stand.<BR>
Planted by Gods each glittering steep<BR>
Looks down upon the milky deep.<BR>
Let fleet Han&uacute;m&aacute;n bring us thence<BR>
Those herbs of wondrous influence.'<BR>

<P>
Meanwhile the rushing wind grew loud,<BR>
Red lightnings flashed from banks of cloud.<BR>
The mountains shook, the wild waves rose,<BR>
And smitten with resistless blows<BR>

<P>
Unrooted fell each stately tree<BR>
That fringed the margin of the sea.<BR>
All life within the waters feared<BR>
Then, as the V&aacute;nars gazed, appeared<BR>
King Garud's self, a wondrous sight,<BR>
Disclosed in flames of fiery light.<BR>
From his fierce eye in sudden dread<BR>
All serpents in a moment fled.<BR>
And those transformed to shaft that bound<BR>
The princes vanished in the ground.<BR>
On Raghu's sons his eyes he bent,<BR>
And hailed the lords armipotent.<BR>
Then o'er them stooped the feathered king,<BR>
And touched their faces with his wing.<BR>
His healing touch their pangs allayed,<BR>
And closed each rent the shafts had made.<BR>
Again their eyes were bright and bold,<BR>
Again the smooth skin shone like gold.<BR>
Again within their shell enshrined<BR>
Came memory and each power of mind:<BR>
And, from those numbing bonds released,<BR>
Their spirit, zeal, and strength increased.<BR>
Firm on their feet they stood, and then<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma spake, the lord of men:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'By thy dear grace in sorest need<BR>
From deadly bonds we both are freed.<BR>
To these glad eyes as welcome now<BR>
As Aja &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_970"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or my sire art thou.<BR>
Who art thou, mighty being? say,<BR>
Thus glorious in thy bright array.'<BR>
He ceased: the king of birds replied,<BR>
While flashed his eye with joy and pride:<BR>
'In me, O Raghu's son, behold<BR>
One who has loved thee from of old:<BR>
Garud, the lord of all that fly,<BR>
Thy guardian and thy friend am I.<BR>
Not all the Gods in heaven could loose<BR>
These numbing bonds, this serpent noose,<BR>
Wherewith fierce R&aacute;van's son, renowned<BR>
For magic arts, your limbs had bound.<BR>
Those arrows fixed in every limb<BR>
Were mighty snakes, transformed by him.<BR>
Blood thirsty race, they live beneath<BR>
The earth, and slay with venomed teeth.<BR>
On, smite the lord of Lank&aacute;'s isle,<BR>
But guard you from the giants' guile<BR>
Who each dishonest art employ<BR>
And by deceit brave foes destroy.<BR>
So shall the tyrant R&aacute;van bleed,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; from his power be freed.'<BR>
Thus Garud spake: then, swift as thought,<BR>
The region of the sky he sought,<BR>
Where in the distance like a blaze<BR>
Of fire he vanished from the gaze.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then the glad V&aacute;nars joy rang out<BR>
In many a wild tumultuous shout,<BR>
And the loud roar of drum and shell<BR>
Startled each distant sentinel.<BR>
