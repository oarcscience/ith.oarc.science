<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CIX.: THE BATTLE.</H3>
<P>
With wondrous power and might and skill<BR>
The giant fought with R&aacute;ma still.<BR>
Each at his foe his chariot drove,<BR>
And still for death or victory strove.<BR>
The warriors' steeds together dashed,<BR>
And pole with pole re&euml;choing clashed.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma launching dart on dart<BR>
Made R&aacute;van's coursers swerve and start.<BR>
Nor was the lord of Lank&aacute; slow<BR>
To rain his arrows on the foe,<BR>
Who showed, by fiery points assailed,<BR>
No trace of pain, nor shook nor quailed.<BR>
Dense clouds of arrows R&aacute;ma shot<BR>
With that strong arm which rested not,<BR>
And spear and mace and club and brand<BR>
Fell in dire rain from R&aacute;van's hand.<BR>
The storm of missiles fiercely cast<BR>
Stirred up the oceans with its blast,<BR>
And Serpent-Gods and fiends who dwell<BR>
Below were troubled by the swell.<BR>
The earth with hill and plain and brook<BR>
And grove and garden reeled and shook:<BR>
The very sun grew cold and pale,<BR>
And horror stiled the rising gale.<BR>
God and Gandharva, sage and saint<BR>
Cried out, with grief and terror faint:<BR>
O may the prince of Raghu' line<BR>
Give peace to Br&aacute;hmans and to kine,<BR>
And, rescuing the worlds, o'erthrow<BR>
The giant king our awful foe.'<BR>

<P>
Then to his deadly string the pride<BR>
Of Raghu's race a shaft applied.<BR>
Sharp as a serpent's venomed fang<BR>
Straight to its mark the arrow sprang,<BR>
And from the giant's body shred<BR>
With trenchant steel the monstrous head.<BR>
There might the triple world behold<BR>
That severed head adorned with gold.<BR>
But when all eyes were bent to view,<BR>
Swift in its stead another grew.<BR>
Again the shaft was pointed well:<BR>
Again the head divided fell;<BR>
But still as each to earth was cast<BR>
Another head succeeded fast.<BR>
A hundred, bright with fiery flame,<BR>
Fell low before the victor's aim,<BR>
Yet R&aacute;van by no sign betrayed<BR>
That death was near or strength decayed.<BR>
The doubtful fight he still maintained,<BR>
And on the foe his missiles rained.<BR>
In air, on earth, on plain, on hill,<BR>
With awful might he battled still;<BR>
And through the hours of night and day<BR>
The conflict knew no pause or stay.<BR>
