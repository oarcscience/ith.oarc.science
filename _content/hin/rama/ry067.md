### CANTO LXVII.: THE BREAKING OF THE BOW.

Then spoke again the great recluse:  
'This mighty bow, O King, produce.'  
King Janak, at the saint's request,  
This order to his train addressed:  
'Let the great bow be hither borne,  
Which flowery wreaths and scents adorn.'  
Soon as the monarch's words were said,  
His servants to the city sped,  
Five thousand youths in number, all  
Of manly strength and stature tall,  
The ponderous eight-wheeled chest that held  
The heavenly bow, with toil propelled.  
At length they brought that iron chest,  
And thus the godlike king addressed:  
'This best of bows, O lord, we bring,  
Respected by each chief and king,  
And place it for these youths to see,  
If, Sovereign, such thy pleasure be.'  

With suppliant palm to palm applied  
King Janak to the strangers cried:  
'This gem of bows, O Bráhman Sage,  
Our race has prized from age to age.  
Too strong for those who yet have reigned,  
Though great in might each nerve they strained.  

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>  

Titan and fiend its strength defies,  
God, spirit, minstrel of the skies.  
And bard above and snake below  
Are baffled by this glorious bow.  
Then how may human prowess hope  
With such a bow as this to cope?  
What man with valour's choicest gift  
This bow can draw, or string, or lift?  
Yet let the princes, holy Seer,  
Behold it: it is present here.'  

Then spoke the hermit pious-souled:  
'Ráma, dear son, the bow behold.'  
Then Ráma at his word unclosed  
The chest wherein its might reposed,  
Thus crying, as he viewed it: 'Lo!  
I lay mine hand upon the bow:  
May happy luck my hope attend  
Its heavenly strength to lift or bend.'  
'Good luck be thine,' the hermit cried:  
'Assay the task!' the king replied.  
Then Raghu's son, as if in sport,  
Before the thousands of the court,  
The weapon by the middle raised  
That all the crowd in wonder gazed.  
With steady arm the string he drew  
Till burst the mighty bow in two.  
As snapped the bow, an awful clang,  
Loud as the shriek of tempests, rang.  
The earth, affrighted, shook amain  
As when a hill is rent in twain.  
Then, senseless at the fearful sound,  
The people fell upon the ground:  
None save the king, the princely pair,  
And the great saint, the shock could bear,  

When woke to sense the stricken train,  
And Janak's soul was calm again,  
With suppliant hands and reverent head,  
These words, most eloquent, he said:  
'O Saint, Prince Ráma stands alone:  
His peerless might he well has shown.  
A marvel has the hero wrought  
Beyond belief, surpassing thought.  
My child, to royal Ráma wed,  
New glory on our line will shed:  
And true my promise will remain  
That hero's worth the bride should gain.  
Dearer to me than light and life,  
My Sitá shall be Ráma's wife.  
If thou, O Bráhman, leave concede,  
My counsellors, with eager speed,  
Borne in their flying cars, to fair  
Ayodhyá's town the news shall bear,  
With courteous message to entreat  
The king to grace my royal seat.  
This to the monarch shall they tell,  
The bride is his who won her well:  
And his two sons are resting here  
Protected by the holy seer.  
So, at his pleasure, let them lead  
The sovereign to my town with speed.'  

The hermit to his prayer inclined  
And Janak, lord of virtuous mind,  
With charges, to Ayodhyá sent  
His ministers: and forth they went.
