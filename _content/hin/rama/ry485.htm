<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CXIV: VIBH&Iacute;SHAN CONSECRATED.</H3>
<P>
Joy reigned in heaven where every eye<BR>
Had seen the Lord of Lank&aacute; die.<BR>
In cars whose sheen surpassed the sun's<BR>
Triumphant rode the radiant ones:<BR>
And R&aacute;van's death, by every tongue.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's glorious deeds were sung.<BR>
They praised the V&aacute;nars true and brave,<BR>
The counsel wise Sugr&iacute;va gave.<BR>
The deeds of Hanum&aacute;n they told,<BR>
The valiant chief supremely bold,<BR>
The strong ally, the faithful friend.<BR>
And Sit&aacute;'s truth which naught could bend.<BR>

<P>
To M&aacute;tali, whom Indra sent,<BR>
His head the son of Raghu bent:<BR>
And he with fiery steeds who clove<BR>
The clouds again to Swarga drove.<BR>

Round King Sugr&iacute;va brave and true<BR>
His arms in rapture R&aacute;ma threw,<BR>
Looked on the host with joy and pride,<BR>
And thus to noble Lakshman cried:<BR>

<P>
'Now let king-making drops be shed,<BR>
Dear brother, on Vibh&iacute;shan's head<BR>
For truth and friendship nobly shown,<BR>
And make him lord of R&aacute;van's throne.'<BR>
This longing of his heart he told:<BR>
And Lakshman took an urn of gold<BR>
And bade the wind-fleet V&aacute;nars bring<BR>
Sea water for the giants' king.<BR>
The brimming urn was swiftly brought:<BR>
Then on a throne superbly wrought<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan sat, the giants' lord,<BR>
And o'er his brows the drops were poured.<BR>
As Raghu's son the rite beheld<BR>
His loving heart with rapture swelled:<BR>
But tenderer thoughts within him woke,<BR>
And thus to Hanum&aacute;n he spoke:<BR>

<P>
'Go to my queen: this message give:<BR>
Say Lakshman and Sugr&iacute;va live.<BR>
The death of Lank&aacute;'s monarch tell,<BR>
And bid her joy, for all is well.'<BR>
