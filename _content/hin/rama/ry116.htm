<P>
Then when the people wroth and sad<BR>
Saw S&iacute;t&aacute; in bark vesture clad,<BR>
Though wedded, like some widowed thing,<BR>
They cried out, 'Shame upon thee, King!'<BR>
Grieved by their cry and angry look<BR>
The lord of earth at once forsook<BR>
All hope in life that still remained,<BR>
In duty, self, and fame unstained.<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's son with burning sighs<BR>
On Queen Kaikey&iacute; bent his eyes,<BR>
And said: 'But S&iacute;t&aacute; must not flee<BR>
In garments of a devotee.<BR>
My holy guide has spoken truth:<BR>
Unfit is she in tender youth,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
So gently nurtured, soft and fair,<BR>
The hardships of the wood to share.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  How has she sinned, devout and true,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The noblest monarch's child,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That she should garb of bark indue<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And journey to the wild?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That she should spend her youthful days<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Amid a hermit band,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like some poor mendicant who strays<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Sore troubled, through the land?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ah, let the child of Janak throw<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Her dress of bark aside,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And let the royal lady go<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With royal wealth supplied.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Not such the pledge I gave before,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Unfit to linger here:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The oath, which I the sinner swore<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Is kept, and leaves her clear.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Won from her childlike love this too<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    My instant death would be,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As blossoms on the old bamboo<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Destroy the parent tree. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_313"></A><A HREF="#fn_313"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
If aught amiss by R&aacute;ma done<BR>
Offend thee, O thou wicked one,<BR>
What least transgiession canst thou find<BR>
In her, thou worst of womankind?<BR>
What shade of fault in her appears,<BR>
Whose full soft eye is like the deer's?<BR>
What canst thou blame in Janak's child,<BR>
So gentle, modest, true, and mild?<BR>
Is not one crime complete, that sent<BR>
My R&aacute;ma forth to banishment!<BR>
And wilt thou other sins commit.<BR>
Thou wicked one, to double it?<BR>
This is the pledge and oath I swore,<BR>
What thou besoughtest, and no more,<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma--for I heard thee, dame--<BR>
When he for consecration came.<BR>
Now with this limit not content,<BR>
In hell should be thy punishment,<BR>
Who fain the Maithil bride wouldst press<BR>
To clothe her limbs with hermit dress.'<BR>

<P>
Thus spake the father in his woe;<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, still prepared to go,<BR>
To him who sat with drooping head<BR>
Spake in return these words and said:<BR>

<P>
'Just King, here stands my mother dear,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;, one whom all revere.<BR>
Submissive, gentle, old is she,<BR>
And keeps her lips from blame of thee,<BR>
For her, kind lord, of me bereft<BR>
A sea of whelming woe is left.<BR>
O, show her in her new distress<BR>
Still fonder love and tenderness.<BR>
Well honoured by thine honoured hand<BR>
Her grief for me let her withstand,<BR>
Who wrapt in constant thought of me<BR>
In me would live a devotee.<BR>


<P>


<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Peer of Mahendra, O, to her be kind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And treat I pray, my gentle mother so,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That, when I dwell afar, her life resigned,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    She may not, pass, to Yama's realm for woe.'<BR>
