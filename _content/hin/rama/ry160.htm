<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXXII.: THE DEPARTURE.</H3>
<P>
The prudent prince the assembly viewed<BR>
Thronged with its noble multitude,<BR>
Resplendent as a cloudless night<BR>
When the full moon is in his height;<BR>
While robes of every varied hue<BR>
A glory o'er the synod threw.<BR>
The priest in lore of duty skilled<BR>
Looked on the crowd the hall that filled,<BR>
And then in accents soft and grave<BR>
To Bharat thus his counsel gave:<BR>
'The king, dear son, so good and wise,<BR>
Has gone from earth and gained the skies,<BR>
Leaving to thee, her rightful lord,<BR>
This rich wide land with foison stored.<BR>
And still has faithful R&aacute;ma stood<BR>
Firm to the duty of the good,<BR>
And kept his father's host aright,<BR>
As the moon keeps its own dear light.<BR>
Thus sire and brother yield to thee<BR>
This realm from all annoyance free:<BR>
Bejoice thy lords: enjoy thine own:<BR>
Anointed king, ascend the throne.<BR>
Let vassal Princes hasten forth<BR>
From distant lands, west, south, and north,<BR>
From Kerala, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> from every sea,<BR>
And bring ten million gems to thee.'<BR>
As thus the sage Vas'ishtha spoke,<BR>
A storm of grief o'er Bharat broke.<BR>
And longing to he just and true,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
His thoughts to duteous R&aacute;ma flew.<BR>
With sobs and sighs and broken tones,<BR>
E'en as a wounded mallard moans,<BR>
He mourned with deepest sorrow moved,<BR>
And thus the holy priest reproved:<BR>
'O, how can such as Bharat dare<BR>
The power and sway from him to tear,<BR>
Wise, and devout, and true, and chaste,<BR>
With Scripture lore and virtue graced?<BR>
Can one of Das'aratha's seed<BR>
Be guilty of so vile a deed?<BR>
The realm and I are R&aacute;ma's: thou,<BR>
Shouldst speak the words of justice now.<BR>
For he, to claims of virtue true,<BR>
Is eldest born and noblest too:<BR>
Nahush, Dil&icirc;pa could not be<BR>
More famous in their lives than he.<BR>
As Das'aratha ruled of right,<BR>
So R&aacute;ma's is the power and right.<BR>
If I should do this sinful deed<BR>
And forfeit hope of heavenly need,<BR>
My guilty act would dim the shine<BR>
Of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's glorious line.<BR>
Nay, as the sin my mother wrought<BR>
Is grievous to my inmost thought,<BR>
I here, my hands together laid,<BR>
Will greet him in the pathless shade,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma shall my steps be bent,<BR>
My King, of men most excellent,<BR>
Raghu's illustrious son, whose sway<BR>
Might, hell, and earth, and heaven obey.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That righteous speech, whose every word<BR>
Bore virtue's, stamp, the audience heard;<BR>
On R&aacute;ma every thought was set,<BR>
And with glad tears each eye was wet.<BR>
'Then, if the power I still should lack<BR>
To bring my noble brother back,<BR>
I in the wood will dwell, and share<BR>
His banishment with Lakshman there.<BR>
By every art persuasive I<BR>
To bring him from the wood will try,<BR>
And show him to your loving eyes.<BR>
O Brahmans noble, good, and wise.<BR>
E'en now, the road to make and clear,<BR>
Each labourer pressed, and pioneer<BR>
Have I sent forward to precede<BR>
The army I resolve to lead.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus, by fraternal love possessed,<BR>
His firm resolve the prince expressed.<BR>
Then to Sumantra, deeply read<BR>
In holy texts, he turned and said:<BR>
'Sumantra, rise without delay,<BR>
And as I bid my words obey.<BR>
Give orders for the march with speed,<BR>
And all the army hither lead.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,<BR>
Obeyed the high-souled chief's behest.<BR>
He hurried forth with joy inspired<BR>
And gave the orders he desired.<BR>
Delight each soldier's bosom filled,<BR>
Aud through each chief and captain thrilled,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_191"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 191</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
To hear that march proclaimed, to bring<BR>
Dear R&aacute;ma back from wandering.<BR>
From house to house the tidings flew:<BR>
Each soldier's wife the order knew,<BR>
And as she listened blithe and gay<BR>
Her husband urged to speed away.<BR>
Captain and soldier soon declared<BR>
The host equipped and all prepared<BR>
With chariots matching thought for speed,<BR>
And wagons drawn by ox and steed.<BR>
When Bharat by V&aacute;s'ishtha's side,<BR>
His ready host of warriors eyed,<BR>
Thus in Sumantra's ear he spoke.:<BR>
'My car and horses quickly yoke.'<BR>
Sumantra hastened to fulfil<BR>
With ready joy his master's will,<BR>
And quickly with the chariot sped<BR>
Drawn by fleet horses nobly bred.<BR>
Then glorious Bharat, true, devout,<BR>
Whose genuine valour none could doubt,<BR>
Gave in fit words his order out;<BR>
For he would seek the shade<BR>
Of the great distant wood, and there<BR>
Win his dear brother with his prayer:<BR>
'Sumantra, haste! my will declare<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The host be all arrayed.<BR>
I to the wood my way will take,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma supplication make,<BR>
And for the world's advantage sake,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Will lead him home again.'<BR>
Then, ordered thus, the charioteer<BR>
Who listened with delighted ear,<BR>
Went forth and gave his orders clear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To captains of the train.<BR>
He gave the popular chiefs the word,<BR>
And with the news his friends he stirred,<BR>
And not a single man deferred<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Preparing for the road.<BR>
Then Br&aacute;hman, Warrior, Merchant, thrall,<BR>
Obedient to Sumantra's call,<BR>
Each in his house arose, and all<BR>
Yoked elephant or camel tall,<BR>
Or ass or noble steed in stall,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And full appointed showed.<BR>
