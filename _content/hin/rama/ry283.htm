'My brother, known by B&aacute;li's name,<BR>
Had won by might a conqueror's fame.<BR>
My father's eldest-born was he,<BR>
Well honoured by his sire and me.<BR>
My father died, and each sage lord<BR>
Named B&aacute;li king with one accord;<BR>
And he, by right of birth ordained,<BR>
The sovereign of the V&aacute;nars reigned.<BR>
He in his royal place controlled<BR>
The kingdom of our sires of old,<BR>
And I all faithful service lent<BR>
To aid my brother's government.<BR>
The fiend M&aacute;v&aacute;v&iacute;, him of yore<BR>
To Dundubhi &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_564"></A><A HREF="#fn_564"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> his mother bore,--<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
For woman's love in strife engaged,<BR>
A deadly war with B&aacute;li waged.<BR>
When sleep had chained each weary frame<BR>
To vast Kishkind&aacute;'s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_565"></A><A HREF="#fn_565"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> gates he came.<BR>
And, shouting through the shades of night,<BR>
Challenged his foeman to the fight.<BR>
My brother heard the furious shout,<BR>
And wild with rage rushed madly out.<BR>
Though fain would I and each sad wife<BR>
Detain him from the deadly strife.<BR>
He burned his demon foe to slay,<BR>
And rushed impetuous to the fray.<BR>
His weeping wives he thrust aside,<BR>
And forth, impelled by fury, hied;<BR>
While, by my love and duty led,<BR>
I followed where my brother sped.<BR>
M&aacute;y&aacute;v&iacute; looked, and at the sight<BR>
Fled from his foes in wild affright.<BR>
The flying fiend we quickly viewed.<BR>
And with swift feet his steps pursued.<BR>
Then rose the moon, whose friendly ray<BR>
Cast light upon our headlong way.<BR>
By the soft beams was dimly shown<BR>
A mighty cave with grass o'ergrown.<BR>
Within its depths he sprang, and we<BR>
The demon's form no more might see.<BR>
My brother's breast was all aglow<BR>
With fury when he missed the foe,<BR>
And, turning, thus to me he said<BR>
With senses all disquieted:<BR>
'Here by the cavern's mouth remain;<BR>
Keep ear and eye upon the strain,<BR>
While I the dark recess explore<BR>
And dip my brand in foeman's gore.'<BR>
I heard his angry speech, and tried<BR>
To turn him from his plan aside.<BR>
He made me swear by both his feet,<BR>
And sped within the dark retreat.<BR>
While in the cave he stayed, and I<BR>
Watched at the mouth, a year went by.<BR>
For his return I looked in vain,<BR>
And, moved by love, believed him slain.<BR>
I mourned, by doubt and fear distressed,<BR>
And greater horror seized my breast<BR>
When from the cavern rolled a flood,<BR>
A carnage stream of froth and blood;<BR>
And from the depths a sound of fear,<BR>
The roar of demons, smote mine ear;<BR>
But never rang my brother's shout<BR>
Triumphant in the battle rout.<BR>
I closed the cavern with a block,<BR>
Huge as a hill, of shattered rock.<BR>
Gave offerings due to B&aacute;li's shade,<BR>
And sought Kishkindh&aacute;, sore dismayed.<BR>
Long time with anxious care I tried<BR>
From B&aacute;li's lords his fate to hide,<BR>
But they, when once the tale was known,<BR>
Placed me as king on B&aacute;li's throne.<BR>
There for a while I justly reigned<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_334"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 334</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And all with equal care ordained,<BR>
When joyous from the demon slain<BR>
My brother B&aacute;li came again.<BR>
He found me ruling in his stead,<BR>
And, fired with rage, his eyes grew red.<BR>
He slew the lords who made me king,<BR>
And spoke keen words to taunt and sting.<BR>
The kingly rank and power I held<BR>
My brother's rage with ease had quelled,<BR>
But still, restrained by old respect<BR>
For claims of birth, the thought I checked.<BR>
Thus having struck the demon down<BR>
Came B&aacute;li to his royal town.<BR>
With meek respect, with humble speech,<BR>
His haughty heart I strove to reach.<BR>
But all my arts were tried in vain,<BR>
No gentle word his lips would deign.<BR>
Though to the ground I bent and set<BR>
His feet upon my coronet:<BR>
Still Bali in his rage and pride<BR>
All signs of grace and love denied.'<BR>
