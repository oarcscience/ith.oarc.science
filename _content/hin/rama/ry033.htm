<P>
Thus spoke the prince of boundless might,<BR>
And thus replied the anchorite:<BR>
'Chief of the mighty arm, of yore<BR>
Lord Vishnu whom the Gods adore,<BR>
For holy thought and rites austere<BR>
Of penance made his dwelling here.<BR>
This ancient wood was called of old<BR>
Grave of the Dwarf, the mighty-souled,<BR>
And when perfection he attained<BR>
The grove the name of Perfect gained.<BR>
Bali of yore, Virochan's son,<BR>
Dominion over Indra won,<BR>
And when with power his proud heart swelled,<BR>
O'er the three worlds his empire held.<BR>
When Bali then began a rite,<BR>
The Gods and Indra in affright<BR>
Sought Vishnu in this place of rest,<BR>
And thus with prayers the God addressed:<BR>
'Bali, Virochan's mighty son,<BR>
His sacrifice has now begun:<BR>
Of boundless wealth, that demon king<BR>
Is bounteous to each living thing.<BR>
Though suppliants flock from every side<BR>
The suit of none is e'er denied.<BR>
Whate'er, where'er, howe'er the call,<BR>
He hears the suit and gives to all.<BR>
Now with thine own illusive art<BR>
Perform, O Lord, the helper's part:<BR>
Assume a dwarfish form, and thus<BR>
From fear and danger rescue us.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Thus in their dread the Immortals sued:<BR>
The God a dwarflike shape indued:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Before Virochan's son he came,<BR>
Three steps of land his only claim.<BR>
The boon obtained, in wondrous wise<BR>
Lord Vishnu's form increased in size;<BR>
Through all the worlds, tremendous, vast,<BR>
God of the Triple Step, he passed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
The whole broad earth from side to side<BR>
He measured with one mighty stride,<BR>
Spanned with the next the firmament,<BR>
And with the third through heaven he went.<BR>

<P>
Thus was the king of demons hurled<BR>
By Vishnu to the nether world,<BR>
And thus the universe restored<BR>
To Indra's rule, its ancient lord.<BR>
And now because the immortal God<BR>
This spot in dwarflike semblance trod,<BR>
The grove has aye been loved by me<BR>
For reverence of the devotee.<BR>
But demons haunt it, prompt to stay<BR>
Each holy offering I would pay.<BR>
Be thine, O lion-lord, to kill<BR>
These giants that delight in ill.<BR>
This day, beloved child, our feet<BR>
Shall rest within the calm retreat:<BR>
And know, thou chief of Raghu's line,<BR>
My hermitage is also thine.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke; and soon the anchorite,<BR>
With joyous looks that beamed delight,<BR>
With R&aacute;ma and his brother stood<BR>
Within the consecrated wood.<BR>
Soon as they saw the holy man,<BR>
With one accord together ran<BR>
The dwellers in the sacred shade,<BR>
And to the saint their reverence paid,<BR>
And offered water for his feet,<BR>
The gift of honour and a seat;<BR>
And next with hospitable care<BR>
They entertained the princely pair.<BR>
The royal tamers of their foes<BR>
Rested awhile in sweet repose:<BR>
Then to the chief of hermits sued<BR>
Standing in suppliant attitude:<BR>
'Begin, O best of saints, we pray,<BR>
Initiatory rites to-day.<BR>
This Perfect Grove shall be anew<BR>
Made perfect, and thy words be true.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, thus addressed, the holy man,<BR>
The very glorious sage, began<BR>
The high preliminary rite.<BR>
Restraining sense and appetite.<BR>
Calmly the youths that night reposed,<BR>
And rose when morn her light disclosed,<BR>
Their morning worship paid, and took<BR>
Of lustral water from the brook.<BR>
Thus purified they breathed the prayer,<BR>
Then greeted Vis'vam&iacute;tra where<BR>
As celebrant he sate beside<BR>
The flame with sacred oil supplied.<BR>
