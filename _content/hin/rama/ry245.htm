<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLVII: R&Aacute;VAN'S WOOING.</H3>
<P>
As, clad in mendicant's disguise,<BR>
He questioned thus his destined prize,<BR>
She to the seeming saintly man<BR>
The story of her life began.<BR>
'My guest is he,' she thought, 'and I,<BR>
To 'scape his curse, must needs reply:'<BR>
'Child of a noble sire I spring<BR>
From Janak, fair Videha's king.<BR>
May every good be thine! my name<BR>
Is S&iacute;t&aacute;, R&aacute;ma's cherished dame.<BR>
Twelve winters with my lord I spent<BR>
Most happily with sweet content<BR>
In the rich home of Raghu's line,<BR>
And every earthly joy was mine.<BR>
Twelve pleasant years flew by, and then<BR>
His peers advised the king of men,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, my lord, to consecrate<BR>
Joint ruler of his ancient state.<BR>
But when the rites were scarce begun,<BR>
To consecrate Ikshv&aacute;ku's son,<BR>
The queen Kaikey&iacute;, honoured dame,<BR>
Sought of her lord an ancient claim.<BR>
Her plea of former service pressed,<BR>
And made him grant her new request,<BR>
To banish R&aacute;ma to the wild<BR>
And consecrate instead her child.<BR>
This double prayer on him, the best<BR>
And truest king, she strongly pressed<BR>
'Mine eyes in sleep I will not close,<BR>
Nor eat, nor drink, nor take repose.<BR>
This very day my death shall bring<BR>
If R&aacute;ma be anointed king.'<BR>
As thus she spake in envious ire,<BR>
The aged king, my husband's sire,<BR>
Besought with fitting words, but she<BR>
Was cold and deaf to every plea.<BR>
As yet my days are few; eighteen<BR>
The years of life that I have seen;<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, best of all alive,<BR>
Has passed of years a score and five-<BR>
R&aacute;ma the great and gentle, through<BR>
All region famed as pure and true,<BR>
Large-eyed and mighty-armed and tall.<BR>
With tender heart that cares for all.<BR>
But Das'aratha, led astray<BR>
By woman's wile and passion's sway,<BR>
By his strong love of her impelled,<BR>
The consecrating rites withheld.<BR>
When, hopeful of the promised grace,<BR>
My R&aacute;ma sought his father's face,<BR>
The queen Kaikey&iacute;, ill at ease,<BR>
Spoke to my lord brief words like these:<BR>
'Hear, son of Raghu, hear from me<BR>
The words thy father says to thee:<BR>
'I yield this day to Bharat's hand,<BR>
Free from all foes, this ancient land.<BR>
Fly from this home no longer thine,<BR>
And dwell in woods five years and nine.<BR>
Live in the forest and maintain<BR>
Mine honour pure from falsehood's stain.'<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma spoke, untouched by dread;<BR>
'Yea, it shall be as thou hast said '.<BR>
And answered, faithful to his vows,<BR>
Obeying Das'aratha's spouse:<BR>
'The offered realm I would not take,<BR>
But still keep true the words he spake.'<BR>
Thus, gentle Br&aacute;hman, R&aacute;ma still<BR>
Clung to his vow with firmest will.<BR>
And valiant Lakshman, dear to fame,<BR>
His brother by a younger dame,<BR>
Bold victor in the deadly fray,<BR>
Would follow R&aacute;ma on his way.<BR>
On sternest vows his heart was set,<BR>
And he, a youthful anchoret,<BR>
Bound up in twisted coil his hair<BR>
And took the garb which hermits wear;<BR>
Then with his bow to guard us, he<BR>
Went forth with R&aacute;ma and with me.<BR>
By Queen Kaikey&iacute;'s art bereft<BR>
The kingdom and our home we left,<BR>
And bound by stern religious vows<BR>
We sought this shade of forest boughs.<BR>
Now, best of Br&aacute;hmans, here we tread<BR>
These pathless regions dark and dread.<BR>
But come, refresh thy soul, and rest<BR>
Here for a while an honoured guest.<BR>
For he, my lord, will soon be here<BR>
With fresh supply of woodland cheer,<BR>
Large store of venison of the buck,<BR>
Or some great boar his hand has struck.<BR>
Meanwhile, O stranger, grant my prayer:<BR>
Thy name, thy race, thy birth declare,<BR>
And why with no companion thou<BR>
Roamest in Dandak forest now.'<BR>
Thus questioned S&iacute;t&aacute;, R&aacute;ma's dame.<BR>
Then fierce the stranger's answer came:<BR>
'Lord of the giant legions, he<BR>
From whom celestial armies flee,--<BR>
The dread of hell and earth and sky,<BR>
R&aacute;van the R&aacute;kshas king am I.<BR>
Now when thy gold-like form I view<BR>
Arrayed in silks of amber hue,<BR>
My love, O thou of perfect mould,<BR>
For all my dames is dead and cold.<BR>
A thousand fairest women, torn<BR>
From many a land my home adorn.<BR>
But come, loveliest lady, be<BR>
The queen of every dame and me.<BR>
My city Lank&aacute;, glorious town,<BR>
Looks from a mountain's forehead down<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_285"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 285</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Where ocean with his flash and foam<BR>
Beats madly on mine island home.<BR>
With me, O S&iacute;t&aacute;, shalt thou rove<BR>
Delighted through each shady grove,<BR>
Nor shall thy happy breast retain<BR>
Fond memory of this life of pain.<BR>
In gay attire, a glittering band*,<BR>
Five thousand maids shall round thee stand,<BR>
And serve thee at thy beck and sign,<BR>
If thou, fair S&iacute;t&aacute;, wilt be mine.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then forth her noble passion broke<BR>
As thus in turn the lady spoke:<BR>
'Me, me the wife of R&aacute;ma, him<BR>
The lion lord with lion's limb,<BR>
Strong as the sea, firm as the rock,<BR>
Like Indra in the battle shook.<BR>
Tue lord of each auspicious sign,<BR>
The glory of his princely line,<BR>
Like some fair Bodh tree strong and tall,<BR>
The noblest and the best of all,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, the heir of happy fate<BR>
Who keeps his word inviolate,<BR>
Lord of the lion gait, possessed<BR>
Of mighty arm and ample chest,<BR>
Rama the lion-warrior, him<BR>
Whose moon bright face no fear can dim,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, his bridled passions' lord,<BR>
The darling whom his sire adored,--<BR>
Me, me the true and loving dame<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma, prince of deathless fame--<BR>
Me wouldst, thou vainly woo and press?<BR>
A jackal woo a lioness!<BR>
Steal from the sun his glory! such<BR>
Thy hope Lord R&aacute;ma's wife to touch.<BR>
Ha! Thou hast seen the trees of gold,<BR>
The sign which dying eyes behold,<BR>
Thus seeking, weary of thy life,<BR>
To win the love of R&aacute;ma's wife.<BR>
Fool! wilt thou dare to rend away<BR>
The famished lion's bleeding prey,<BR>
Or from the threatening jaws to take<BR>
The fang of some envenomed snake?<BR>
What, wouldst thou shake with puny hand<BR>
Mount Mandar,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> towering o'er the laud,<BR>
Put poison to thy lips and think<BR>
The deadly cup a harmless drink?<BR>
With pointed needle touch thine eye,<BR>
A razor to thy tongue apply,<BR>
Who wouldst pollute with impious touch<BR>
The wife whom R&aacute;ma loves so much?<BR>
Be round thy neck a millstone tied,<BR>
And swim the sea from side to side;<BR>
Or raising both thy hands on high<BR>
Pluck sun and moon from yonder sky;<BR>
Or let the kindled flame be pressed,<BR>
Wrapt in thy garment, to thy breast;<BR>

<P>

<P>
More wild the thought that seeks to win<BR>
R&aacute;ma's dear wife who knows not sin.<BR>
The fool who thinks with idle aim<BR>
To gain the love of Rama's dame,<BR>
With dark and desperate footing makes<BR>
His way o'er points of iron stakes.<BR>
As Ocean to a bubbling spring,<BR>
The lion to a fox, the king<BR>
Of all the birds that ply the wing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To an ignoble crow<BR>
As gold to lead of little price,<BR>
As to the drainings of the rice<BR>
The drink they quaff in Paradise,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Amrit's heavenly flow,<BR>
As sandal dust with perfume sweet<BR>
Is to the mire that soils our feet,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A tiger to a cat,<BR>
As the white swan is to the owl,<BR>
The peacock to the waterfowl,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  An eagle to a bat,<BR>
Such is my lord compared with thee;<BR>
And when with bow and arrows he,<BR>
Mighty as Indra's self shall see<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His foeman, armed to slay.<BR>
Thou, death-doomed like the fly that sips<BR>
The oil that on the altar drips,<BR>
Shalt cast the morsel from thy lips<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And lose thy half-won prey.'<BR>
Thus in high scorn the lady flung<BR>
The biting arrows of her tongue<BR>
In bitter words that pierced and stung<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The rover of the night.<BR>
She ceased. Her gentle cheek grew pale,<BR>
Her loosened limbs began to fail,<BR>
And like a plantain in the gale<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She trembled with affright.<BR>
He terrible as Death stood nigh,<BR>
And watched with fierce exulting eye<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fear that shook her frame.<BR>
To terrify the lady more,<BR>
He counted all his triumphs o'er,<BR>
Proclaimed the titles that he bore,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His pedigree and name.<BR>
