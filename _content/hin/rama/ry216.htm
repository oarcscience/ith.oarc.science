On her ensnared in R&aacute;ma's net<BR>
His eyes the royal Rama set,<BR>

<P>
And thus, her passion to beguile,<BR>
Addressed her with a gentle smile:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'I have a wife: behold her here,<BR>
My S&iacute;t&aacute; ever true and dear:<BR>
And one like thee will never brook<BR>
Upon a rival spouse to look.<BR>
But there my brother Lakshman stands:<BR>
Unchained is he by nuptial bands:<BR>
A youth heroic, loved of all,<BR>
Gracious and gallant, fair and tall.<BR>
With winning looks, most nobly bred,<BR>
Unmatched till now, he longs to wed.<BR>
Meet to enjoy thy youthful charms,<BR>
O take him to thy loving arms.<BR>
Enamoured on his bosom lie,<BR>
Fair damsel of the radiant eye,<BR>
As the warm sunlight loves to rest<BR>
Upon her darling Meru's breast.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hero spoke, the monster heard,<BR>
While passion still her bosom stirred.<BR>
Away from R&aacute;ma's side she broke,<BR>
And thus in turn to Lakshman spoke:<BR>
'Come, for thy bride take me who shine<BR>
In fairest grace that suits with thine.<BR>
Thou by my side from grove to grove<BR>
Of Dandak's wild in bliss shalt rove.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Lakshman, skilled in soft address,<BR>
Wooed by the amorous giantess,<BR>
With art to turn her love aside,<BR>
To S&uacute;rpanakh&iacute; thus replied:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'And can so high a dame agree<BR>
The slave-wife of a slave to be?<BR>
I, lotus-hued! in good and ill<BR>
Am bondsman to my brother's will.<BR>
Be thou, fair creature radiant-eyed,<BR>
My honoured brother's younger bride:<BR>
With faultless tint and dainty limb,<BR>
A happy wife, bring joy to him.<BR>
He from his spouse grown old and grey,<BR>
Deformed, untrue, will turn away,<BR>
Her withered charms will gladly leave,<BR>
And to his fair young darling cleave.<BR>
For who could be so fond and blind,<BR>
O loveliest of all female kind,<BR>
To love another dame and slight<BR>
Thy beauties rich in all delight?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Lakshman praised in scornful jest<BR>
The long-toothed fiend with loathly breast,<BR>
Who fondly heard his speech, nor knew<BR>
His mocking words were aught but true.<BR>
Again inflamed with love she fled<BR>
To R&aacute;ma, in his leafy shed<BR>
Where S&iacute;t&aacute; rested by his side,<BR>
And to the mighty victor cried:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'What, R&aacute;ma, canst thou blindly cling<BR>
To this old false misshapen thing?<BR>
Wilt thou refuse the charms of youth<BR>
For withered breast and grinning tooth!<BR>
Canst thou this wretched creature prize<BR>
And look on me with scornful eyes?<BR>
This aged crone this very hour<BR>
Before thy face will I devour:<BR>
Then joyous, from all rivals free.<BR>
Through Dandak will I stray with thee.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She spoke, and with a glance of flame<BR>
Rushed on the fawn-eyed Maithil dame:<BR>
So would a horrid meteor mar<BR>
Fair Rohin&iacute;'s soft beaming star.<BR>
But as the furious fiend drew near,<BR>
Like Death's dire noose which chills with fear,<BR>
The mighty chief her purpose stayed,<BR>
And spoke, his brother to upbraid:<BR>
'Ne'er should we jest with creatures rude.<BR>
Of savage race and wrathful mood.<BR>
Think, Lakshman, think how nearly slain<BR>
My dear Videhan breathes again.<BR>
Let not the hideous wretch escape<BR>
Without a mark to mar her shape.<BR>
Strike, lord of men, the monstrous fiend,<BR>
Deformed, and foul, and evil-miened.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke: then Lakshman's wrath rose high,<BR>
And there before his brother's eye,<BR>
He drew that sword which none could stay,<BR>
And cleft her nose and ears away.<BR>
Noseless and earless, torn and maimed,<BR>
With fearful shrieks the fiend exclaimed,<BR>
And frantic in her wild distress<BR>
Resought the distant wilderness.<BR>
Deformed, terrific, huge, and dread.<BR>
As on she moved, her gashes bled,<BR>
And groan succeeded groan as loud<BR>
As roars, ere rain, the thunder cloud.<BR>
Still on the fearful monster passed,<BR>
While streams of blood kept falling fast,<BR>
And with a roar, and arms outspread<BR>
Within the boundless wood she fled.<BR>
To Janasth&aacute;n the monster flew;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fierce Khara there she found,<BR>
With chieftains of the giant crew<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In thousands ranged around.<BR>
Before his awful feet she bent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And fell with piercing cries,<BR>
As when a bolt in swift descent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Comes flashing from the skies.<BR>
There for a while with senses dazed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Silent she lay and scared:<BR>
At length her drooping head she raised,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And all the tale declared,<BR>
How R&aacute;ma, Lakshman, and the dame<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Had reached that lonely place:<BR>
Then told her injuries and shame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And showed her bleeding face.<BR>
