<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LVIII.: R&Aacute;MA'S MESSAGE.</H3>
<P>
The king a while had senseless lain,<BR>
When care brought memory back again.<BR>
Then straight he called, the news to hear<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma, for the charioteer,<BR>
With reverent hand to hand applied<BR>
He waited by the old man's side,<BR>
Whose mind with anguish was distraught<BR>
Like a great elephant newly caught.<BR>
The king with bitter pain distressed<BR>
The faithful charioteer addressed,<BR>
Who, sad of mien, with flooded eye,<BR>
And dust upon his limbs, stood by:<BR>
'Where will be R&aacute;ma's dwelling now,<BR>
At some tree's foot, beneath the bough;<BR>
Ah, what will be the exile's food.<BR>
Bred up with kind solicitude?<BR>
Can he, long lapped in pleasant rest,<BR>
Unmeet for pain, by pain oppressed,<BR>
Son of earth's king, his sad night spend<BR>
Earth-couched, as one that has no friend?<BR>
Behind him, when abroad he sped,<BR>
Cars, elephant, and foot were led:<BR>
Then how shall R&aacute;ma dwell afar<BR>
In the wild woods where no men are?<BR>
How, tell me, did the princes there,<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; good and soft and fair,<BR>
Alighting from the chariot, tread<BR>
The forest wilds around them spread?<BR>
A happy lot is thine, I ween,<BR>
Whose eyes my two dear sons have seen<BR>
Seeking on foot the forest shade,<BR>
Like the bright Twins to view displayed,<BR>
The heavenly As'vins, when they seek<BR>
The woods that hang 'neath Mandar's peak,<BR>
What words, Sumantra, quickly tell,<BR>
From R&aacute;ma, Lakshman. S&iacute;t&aacute; fell?<BR>
How in the wood did R&aacute;ma eat?<BR>
What was his bed, and what his seat?<BR>
Full answer to my questions give,<BR>
For I on thy replies shall live,<BR>
As with the saints Yay&aacute;ti held<BR>
Sweet converse, from the skies expelled.'<BR>

<P>
Urged by the lord of men to speak,<BR>
Whose sobbing voice came faint and weak,<BR>
Thus he, while tears his utterance broke,<BR>
In answer to the monarch spoke;<BR>
'Hear then the words that R&aacute;ma said,<BR>
Resolved in duty's path to tread.<BR>
Joining his hands, his head he bent,<BR>
And gave this message, reverent:<BR>
'Sumantra, to my father go,<BR>
Whose lofty mind all people know:<BR>
Bow down before him, as is meet,<BR>
And in my stead salute his feet.<BR>
Then to the queen my mother bend,<BR>
And give the greeting that I send:<BR>
Ne'er may her steps from duty err,<BR>
And may it still be well with her.<BR>
And add this word: 'O Queen, pursue<BR>
Thy vows with faithful heart and true;<BR>
And ever at due season turn<BR>
Where holy fires of worship burn.<BR>
And, lady, on our lord bestow<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Such honour as to Gods we owe.<BR>
Be kind to every queen: let pride<BR>
And thought of self be cast aside.<BR>
In the king's fond opinion raise<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;, by respect and praise.<BR>
Let the young Bharat ever be<BR>
Loved, honoured as the king by thee:<BR>
Thy king-ward duty ne'er forget:<BR>
High over all are monarchs set.'<BR>

<P>
And Bharat, too, for me address:<BR>
Pray that all health his life may bless.<BR>
Let every royal lady share,<BR>
As justice bids, his love and care.<BR>
Say to the strong-armed chief who brings<BR>
Joy to Iksv&aacute;ku's line of kings:<BR>
'As ruling prince thy care be shown<BR>
Of him, our sire, who holds the throne.<BR>
Stricken in years he feels their weight;<BR>
But leave him in his royal state.<BR>
As regent heir content thee still,<BR>
Submissive to thy father's will.'<BR>
R&aacute;ma again his charge renewed,<BR>
As the hot flood his cheek bedewed:<BR>
'Hold as thine own my mother dear<BR>
Who drops for me the longing tear.'<BR>
Then Lakshman, with his soul on fire,<BR>
Spake breathing fast these words of ire:<BR>
'Say, for what sin, for what offence<BR>
Was royal R&aacute;ma banished thence?<BR>
He is the cause, the king: poor slave<BR>
To the light charge Kaikey&iacute; gave.<BR>
Let right or wrong the motive be,<BR>
The author of our woe is he.<BR>
Whether the exile were decreed<BR>
Through foolish faith or guilty greed,<BR>
For promises or empire, still<BR>
The king has wrought a grievous ill.<BR>
Grant that the Lord of all saw fit<BR>
To prompt the deed and sanction it,<BR>
In R&aacute;ma's life no cause I see<BR>
For which the king should bid him flee.<BR>
His blinded eye refused to scan<BR>
The guilt and folly of the plan,<BR>
And from the weakness of the king<BR>
Here and hereafter woe shall spring.<BR>
No more my sire: the ties that used<BR>
To bind me to the king are loosed.<BR>
My brother R&aacute;ma, Raghu's son.<BR>
To me is lord, friend, sire in one.<BR>
The love of men how can he win,<BR>
Deserting, by the cruel sin,<BR>
Their joy, whose heart is swift to feel<BR>
A pleasure in the people's weal?<BR>
Shall he whose mandate could expel<BR>
The virtuous R&aacute;ma, loved so well,<BR>
To whom his subjects' fond hearts cling--<BR>
Shall he in spite of them be king?'<BR>

<P>
But Janak's child, my lord, stood by,<BR>
And oft the votaress heaved a sigh.<BR>
She seemed with dull and wandering sense,<BR>
Beneath a spirit's influence.<BR>
The noble princess, pained with woe<BR>
Which till that hour she ne'er could know,<BR>
Tears in her heavy trouble shed,<BR>
But not a word to me she said.<BR>
She raised her face which grief had dried<BR>
And tenderly her husband eyed,<BR>
Gazed on him as he turned to go<BR>
While tear chased tear in rapid flow.'<BR>
