### CANTO XLIV.: SUMITRA'S SPEECH.

Kaus´alyá ceased her sad lament,  
Of beauteous dames most excellent.  
Sumitrá who to duty clave,  
In righteous words this answer gave:  
'Dear Queen, all noble virtues grace  
Thy son, of men the first in place.  
Why dost thou shed these tears of woe  
With bitter grief lamenting so?  
If Ráma, leaving royal sway  
Has hastened to the woods away,  
'Tis for his high-souled father's sake  
That he his promise may not break.  
He to the path of duty clings  
Which lordly fruit hereafter brings--  
The path to which the righteous cleave--  
For him, dear Queen, thou shouldst not grieve.  
And Lakshman too. the blameless-souled,  
The same high course with him will hold,  
And mighty bliss on him shall wait,  
So tenderly compassionate.  
And Sítá, bred with tender care,  
Well knows what toils await her there,  
But in her love she will not part  
From Ráma of the virtuous heart.  
Now has thy son through all the world  
The banner of his fame unfurled:  
True, modest, careful of his vow,  
What has he left to aim at now?  
The sun will mark his mighty soul,  
His wisdom, sweetness, self-control,  
Will spare from pain his face and limb,  
And with soft radiance shine for him.  
For him through forest glades shall spring  
A soft auspicious breeze, and bring  
Its tempered heat and cold to play  
Around him ever night and day.  
The pure cold moonbeams shall delight  
The hero as he sleeps at night,  
And soothe him with the soft caress  
Of a fond parent's tenderness.  
To him, the bravest of the brave,  
His heavenly arms the Bráhman gave,  
When fierce Suváhu dyed the plain  
With his life-blood by Ráma slain.  
Still trusting to his own right arm  
Thy hero son will fear no harm:  
As in his father's palace, he  
In the wild woods will dauntless be.  
Whene'er he lets his arrows fly  
His stricken foemen fall and die:  
And is that prince of peerless worth  
Too weak to keep and sway the earth?  
His sweet pure soul, his beauty's charm,  
His hero heart, his warlike arm,  
Will soon redeem his rightful reign  
When from the woods he comes again.  
The Bráhmans on the prince's head  
King-making drops shall quickly shed,  
And Sitá, Earth, and Fortune share  
The glories which await the heir.  
For him, when forth his chariot swept,  
The crowd that thronged Ayodhyá wept,  
With agonizing woe distressed.  
With him in hermít's mantle dressed  
In guise of Sítá Lakshmí went,  
And none his glory may prevent.  
Yea, naught to him is high or hard,  
Before whose steps, to be his guard,  
Lakshman, the best who draws the bow,  
With spear, shaft, sword rejoiced to go.  
His wanderings in the forest o'er,  
Thine eyes shall see thy son once more.  
Quit thy faint heart, thy grief dispel,  
For this, O Queen, is truth I tell.  
Thy son returning, moonlike, thence,  
Shall at thy feet do reverence,  
And, blest and blameless lady, thou  
Shalt see his head to touch them bow,  
Yea, thou shalt see thy son made king  
When he returns with triumphing,  
And how thy happy eyes will brim  
With tears of joy to look on him!  
Thou, blameless lady, shouldst the whole  
Of the sad people here console:  
Why in thy tender heart allow  
This bitter grief to harbour now?  
As the long banks of cloud distil  
Their water when they see the hill,  

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>  

So shall the drops of rapture run  
From thy glad eyes to see thy son  
Returning, as he lowly bends  
To greet thee, girt by all his friends.'  
   Thus soothing, kindly eloquent,  
With every hopeful argument  
Kaus'alyá's heart by sorrow rent,  
   Fair Queen Sumitrá ceased.  
Kaus'alyá heard each pleasant plea,  
And grief began to leave her free,  
As the light clouds of autumn flee,  
   Their watery stores decreased.
