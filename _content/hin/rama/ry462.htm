<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXVI.: KOMBHAKARNA'S SALLY.</H3>
<P>
In pomp and pride of warlike state<BR>
The giant passed the city gate.<BR>
He raised his voice: the hills, the shore<BR>
Of Lanka's sea returned the roar.<BR>
The V&aacute;nars saw the chief draw nigh<BR>
Whom not the ruler of the sky,<BR>
Nor Yama, monarch of the dead,<BR>
Might vanquish, and affrighted fled.<BR>
When royal Angad, B&aacute;li's son,<BR>
Saw the scared V&aacute;nars turn and run,<BR>
Undaunted still he kept his ground,<BR>
And shouted as he gazed around:<BR>
'O Nala, N&iacute;la, stay nor let<BR>
Your souls your generous worth forget,<BR>
O Kumud and Gav&aacute;ksha, why<BR>
Like base-born V&aacute;nars will ye fly?<BR>
Turn, turn, nor shame your order thus:<BR>
This giant is no match for us'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They heard his voice: the flight was stayed;<BR>
Again for war they stood arrayed,<BR>
And hurled upon the foe a shower<BR>
Of mountain peaks and trees in flower.<BR>
Still on his limbs their missiles rained:<BR>
Unmoved, their blows he still sustained,<BR>
And seemed unconscious of the stroke<BR>
When rocks against his body broke.<BR>
Fierce as the flame when woods are dry<BR>
He charged with fury in his eye.<BR>
Like trees consumed with fervent heat<BR>
They fell beneath the giant's feet.<BR>
Some o'er the ground, dyed red with gore,<BR>
Fled wild with terror to the shore,<BR>
And, deeming that all hope was lost,<BR>
Ran to the bridge they erst had crossed.<BR>
Some clomb the trees their lives to save,<BR>
Some sought the mountain and the cave;<BR>
Some hid them in the bosky dell,<BR>
And there in deathlike slumber fell.<BR>

<P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Angad saw the chieftains fly<BR>
He called them with a mighty cry:<BR>
'Once more, O V&aacute;nars, charge once more,<BR>
On to the battle as before.<BR>
In all her compass earth has not,<BR>
To hide you safe, one secret spot.<BR>
What! leave your arms? each nobler dame<BR>
Will scorn her consort for the shame.<BR>
This blot upon your names efface,<BR>
And keep your valour from disgrace.<BR>
Stay, chieftains; wherefore will ye run,<BR>
A band of warriors scared by one?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Scarce would they hear: they would not stay,<BR>
And barely spoke in wild dismay:<BR>
'Have we not fought, and fought in vain<BR>
Have we not seen our mightiest slain?<BR>
The giant's matchless force we fear,<BR>
And fly because our lives are dear.'<BR>
But B&aacute;li's son with gentle art<BR>
Dispelled their dread and cheered each heart.<BR>
They turned and formed and waited still<BR>
Obedient to the prince's will.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Footnotes</H3>
<P><A NAME="fn_993"></A><A HREF="ry461.htm#fr_993">477:1</A>  There is so much commonplace repetition
in these Sallies of the R&aacute;kshas chieftains
that omissions are frequently necessary.
The usual ill omens attend the
sally of Kumbhakarna, and the Canto
ends with a description of the terrified
V&aacute;nars' flight which is briefly repeated in
different words at the begining of the
next Canto.</P>
