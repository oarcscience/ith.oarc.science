<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXIV.: DAS'ARATHA'S DEATH.</H3>
<P>
The son of Raghu to his queen<BR>
Thus far described the unequalled scene,<BR>
And, as the hermit's death he rued,<BR>
The mournful story thus renewed:<BR>
'The deed my heedless hand had wrought<BR>
Perplexed me with remorseful thought,<BR>
And all alone I pondered still<BR>
How kindly deed might salve the ill.<BR>
The pitcher from the ground I took,<BR>
And filled it from that fairest brook,<BR>
Then, by the path the hermit showed,<BR>
I reached his sainted sire's abode.<BR>
I came, I saw: the aged pair,<BR>
Feeble and blind, were sitting there,<BR>
Like birds with clipped wings, side by side,<BR>
With none their helpless steps to guide.<BR>
Their idle hours the twain beguiled<BR>
With talk of their returning child,<BR>
And still the cheering hope enjoyed,<BR>
The hope, alas, by me destroyed.<BR>
Then spoke the sage, as drawing near<BR>
The sound of footsteps reached his ear:<BR>
'Dear son, the water quickly bring;<BR>
Why hast thou made this tarrying?<BR>
Thy mother thirsts, and thou hast played,<BR>
And bathing in the brook delayed.<BR>
She weeps because thou camest not;<BR>
Haste, O my son, within the cot.<BR>
If she or I have ever done<BR>
A thing to pain thee, dearest son,<BR>
Dismiss the memory from thy mind:<BR>
A hermit thou, be good and kind.<BR>
On thee our lives, our all, depend:<BR>
Thou art thy friendless parents' friend.<BR>
The eyeless couple's eye art thou:<BR>
Then why so cold and silent now?'<BR>

<P>
With sobbing voice and bosom wrung<BR>
I scarce could move my faltering tongue,<BR>
And with my spirit filled with dread<BR>
I looked upon the sage, and said,<BR>
While mind, and sense, and nerve I strung<BR>
To fortify my trembling tongue,<BR>
And let the aged hermit know<BR>
His son's sad fate, my fear and woe:<BR>
'High-minded Saint, not I thy child,<BR>
A warrior, Das'aratha styled.<BR>
I bear a grievous sorrow's weight<BR>
Born of a deed which good men hate.<BR>
My lord, I came to Sarj?s shore,<BR>
And in my hand my bow I bore<BR>
For elephant or beast of chase<BR>
That seeks by night his drinking place,<BR>
There from the stream a sound I heard,<BR>
As if a jar the water stirred,<BR>
An elephant, I thought, was nigh:<BR>
I aimed, and let an arrow fly.<BR>
Swift to the place I made my way,<BR>
And there a wounded hermit lay<BR>
Gasping for breath: the deadly dart<BR>
Stood quivering in his youthful heart.<BR>
I hastened near with pain oppressed;<BR>
He faltered out his last behest.<BR>
And quickly, as he bade me do,<BR>
From his pierced side the shaft I drew.<BR>
I drew the arrow from the rent,<BR>
And up to heaven the hermit went,<BR>
Lamenting, as from earth he passed,<BR>
His aged parents to the last.<BR>
Thus, unaware, the deed was done:<BR>
My hand, unwitting killed thy son.<BR>
For what remains, O, let me win<BR>
Thy pardon for my heedless sin.'<BR>

<P>
As the sad tale of sin I told<BR>
The hermit's grief was uncontrolled.<BR>
With flooded eyes, and sorrow-faint,<BR>
Thus spake the venerable saint:<BR>
I stood with hand to hand applied,<BR>
And listened as he spoke and sighed:<BR>
'If thou, O King, hadst left unsaid<BR>
By thine own tongue this tale of dread,<BR>
Thy head for hideous guilt accursed<BR>
Had in a thousand pieces burst.<BR>
A hermits blood by warrior spilt,<BR>
In such a case, with purposed guilt,<BR>
Down from his high estate would bring<BR>
Even the thunder's mighty King<BR>
And he a dart who (<I>illegible</I>) sends<BR>
Against the devotee who spends<BR>
His pure life by the law of heaven--<BR>
That sinner's head will split in seven.<BR>
Thou livest, for thy heedless hand<BR>
Has wrought a deed thou hast not planned,<BR>
Else thou and all of Raghu's line<BR>
Had perished by this act of thine.<BR>
Now guide us,' thus the hermit said,<BR>
'Forth to the spot where he lies dead.<BR>
Guide us, this day, O Monarch, we<BR>
For the last time our son would see:<BR>
The hermit dress of skin he wore<BR>
Rent from his limbs distained with gore;<BR>
His senseless body lying slain,<BR>
His soul in Yama's dark domain.'<BR>

<P>
Alone the mourning pair I led,<BR>
Their souls with woe disquieted,<BR>
And let the dame and hermit lay<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Their hands upon the breathless clay.<BR>
The father touched his son, and pressed<BR>
The body to his aged breast;<BR>
Then falling by the dead boy's side,<BR>
He lifted up his voice, and cried:<BR>

<P>
'Hast thou no word, my child, to say?<BR>
No greeting for thy sire to-day?<BR>
Why art thou angry, darling? why<BR>
Wilt thou upon the cold earth lie?<BR>
If thou, my son, art wroth with me,<BR>
Here, duteous child, thy mother see.<BR>
What! no embrace for me, my son?<BR>
No word of tender love--not one?<BR>
Whose gentle voice, so soft and clear,<BR>
Soothing my spirit, shall I hear<BR>
When evening comes, with accents sweet<BR>
Scripture or ancient lore repeat?<BR>
Who, having fed the sacred fire,<BR>
And duly bathed, as texts require.<BR>
Will cheer, when evening rites are done,<BR>
The father mourning for his son?<BR>
Who will the daily meal provide<BR>
For the poor wretch who lacks a guide,<BR>
Feeding the helpless with the best<BR>
Berries and roots, like some dear guest?<BR>
How can these hands subsistence find<BR>
For thy poor mother, old and blind?<BR>
The wretched votaress how sustain,<BR>
Who mourns her child in ceaseless pain?<BR>
Stay yet a while, my darling, stay,<BR>
Nor fly to Yama's realm to-day.<BR>
To-morrow I thy sire and she<BR>
Who bare thee, child, will go with, thee.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_337"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Then when I look on Yama, I<BR>
To great Vivasvat's son will cry:<BR>
'Hear, King of justice, and restore<BR>
Our child to feed us, I implore.<BR>
Lord of the world, of mighty fame,<BR>
Faithful and just, admit my claim,<BR>
And grant this single boon to free<BR>
My soul from fear, to one like me.'<BR>
Because, my son, untouched by stain,<BR>
By sinful hands thou fallest slain<BR>
Win, through thy truth, the sphere where those<BR>
Who die by hostile darts repose.<BR>
Seek the blest home prepared for all<BR>
The valiant who in battle fall,<BR>
Who face the foe and scorn to yield,<BR>
In glory dying on the field.<BR>
Rise to the heaven where Dhundhumar<BR>
And Nahush, mighty heroes, are,<BR>
Where Janamejay and the blest<BR>
Dil&iacute;pa, Sagar, S'alvya, rest:<BR>

<P>


<P>
Home of all virtuous spirits, earned<BR>
By fervent rites and Scripture learned:<BR>
By those whose sacred fires have glowed.<BR>
Whose liberal hands have fields bestowed:<BR>
By givers of a thousand cows,<BR>
By lovers of one faithful spouse:<BR>
By those who serve their masters well.<BR>
And cast away this earthly shell.<BR>
None of my race can ever know<BR>
The bitter pain of lasting woe.<BR>
But doomed to that dire fate is he<BR>
Whose guilty hand has slaughtered thee.<BR>

<P>
Thus with wild tears the aged saint<BR>
Made many a time his piteous plaint,<BR>
Then with his wife began to shed<BR>
The funeral water for the dead.<BR>
But in a shape celestial clad,<BR>
Won by the merits of the lad.<BR>
The spirit from the body brake<BR>
And to the mourning parents spake:<BR>
'A glorious home in realms above<BR>
Rewards my care and filial love.<BR>
You, honoured parents, soon shall be<BR>
Partakers of that home with me.'<BR>

<P>
He spake, and swiftly mounting high,<BR>
With Indra near him, to the sky<BR>
On a bright car, with flame that glowed,<BR>
Sublime the duteous hermit rode.<BR>

<P>
The father, with his consort's aid.<BR>
The funeral rites with water paid,<BR>
And thus his speech to me renewed<BR>
Who stood in suppliant attitude:<BR>
'Slay me this day, O, slay me, King,<BR>
For death no longer has a sting.<BR>
Childless am I: thy dart has done<BR>
To death my dear, my only son.<BR>
Because the boy I loved so well<BR>
Slain by thy heedless arrow fell,<BR>
My curse upon thy soul shall press<BR>
With bitter woe and heaviness.<BR>
I mourn a slaughtered child, and thou<BR>
Shalt feel the pangs that kill me now.<BR>
Bereft and suffering e'en as I,<BR>
So shalt thou mourn thy son, and die.<BR>
Thy hand unwitting dealt the blow<BR>
That laid a holy hermit low,<BR>
And distant, therefore, is the time<BR>
When thou shalt suffer for the crime.<BR>
The hour shall come when, crushed by woes<BR>
Like these I feel, thy life shall close:<BR>
A debt to pay in after days<BR>
Like his the priestly fee who pays."<BR>

<P>
This curse on me the hermit laid,<BR>
Nor yet his tears and groans were stayed.<BR>
Then on the pire their bodies cast<BR>
The pair; and straight to heaven they passed.<BR>
As in sad thought I pondered long<BR>
Back to my memory came the wrong<BR>
Done in wild youth, O lady dear.<BR>
When 'twas my boast to shoot by ear.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The deed has borne the fruit, which now<BR>
Hangs ripe upon the bending bough:<BR>
Thus dainty meats the palate please,<BR>
And lure the weak to swift disease.<BR>
Now on my soul return with dread<BR>
The words that noble hermit said,<BR>
That I for a dear son should grieve,<BR>
And of the woe my life should leave.'<BR>

<P>
Thus spake the king with many a tear;<BR>
Then to his wife he cried in fear:<BR>
'I cannot see thee, love; but lay<BR>
Thy gentle hand in mine, I pray.<BR>
Ah me, if R&aacute;ma touched me thus,<BR>
If once, returning home to us,<BR>
He bade me wealth and lordship give,<BR>
Then, so I think, my soul would live.<BR>
Unlike myself, unjust and mean<BR>
Have been my ways with him, my Queen,<BR>
But like himself is all that he,<BR>
My noble son, has done to me.<BR>
His son, though far from right he stray,<BR>
What prudent sire would cast away?<BR>
What banished son would check his ire,<BR>
Nor speak reproaches of his sire?<BR>
I see thee not: these eyes grow blind,<BR>
And memory quits my troubled mind.<BR>
Angels of Death are round me: they<BR>
Summon my soul with speed away.<BR>
What woe more grievous can there be,<BR>
That, when from light and life I flee,<BR>
I may not, ere I part, behold<BR>
My virtuous R&aacute;ma, true and bold?<BR>
Grief for my son, the brave and true,<BR>
Whose joy it was my will to do,<BR>
Dries up my breath, as summer dries<BR>
The last drop in the pool that lies.<BR>
Not men, but blessed Gods, are they<BR>
Whose eyes shall see his face that day;<BR>
See him, when fourteen years are past,<BR>
With earrings decked return at last.<BR>
My fainting mind forgets to think:<BR>
Low and more low my spirits sink.<BR>
Each from its seat, my senses steal:<BR>
I cannot hear, or taste, or feel.<BR>
This lethargy of soul o'ercomes<BR>
Each organ, and its function numbs:<BR>
So when the oil begins to fail,<BR>
The torch's rays grow faint and pale.<BR>
This flood of woe caused by this hand<BR>
Destroys me helpless and unmanned,<BR>
Resistless as the floods that bore<BR>
A passage through the river shore.<BR>
Ah Raghu's son, ah mighty-armed,<BR>
By whom my cares were soothed and charmed,<BR>
My son in whom I took delight,<BR>
Now vanished from thy father's sight!<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;, ah, I cannot see;<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;, gentle devotee!<BR>
Alas, Kaikey&iacute;, cruel dame,<BR>
My bitter foe, thy father's shame!'<BR>

<P>
Kaus'aly&aacute; and Sumitr&aacute; kept<BR>
Their watch beside him as he wept.<BR>
And Das'aratha moaned and sighed,<BR>
And grieving for his darling died.<BR>
