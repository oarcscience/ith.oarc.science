'How, King,' cried R&aacute;ma, 'didst thou gain<BR>
Thy lore of sea and hill and plain?<BR>
'I told thee how,' Sugr&iacute;va,<BR>
From B&aacute;li's arm M&aacute;y&aacute;v&iacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_746"></A><A HREF="#fn_746"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
To Malaya's hill, and strove to save<BR>
His life by hiding in the cave.<BR>
I told how B&aacute;li sought, to kill<BR>
His foe, the hollow of the hill;<BR>
Nor need I, King, again unfold<BR>
The wondrous tale already told.<BR>
Then, wandering forth, my way I took<BR>
By many a town and wood and brook.<BR>
I roamed the earth from place to place,<BR>
Till, like a mirror's polished face,<BR>
The whole broad disk, that lies between<BR>
Its farthest bounds, mine eyes had seen.<BR>
I wandered first to eastern skies<BR>
Where fairest trees rejoiced mine eyes,<BR>
And many a cave and wooded hill<BR>
Where lilies robed the lake and rill.<BR>
There metal dyes that hill &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_747"></A><A HREF="#fn_747"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> adorn<BR>
Whence springs the sun to light the morn.<BR>
There, too, I viewed the Milky sea,<BR>
Where nymphs of heaven delight to be.<BR>
Then to the south I made my way<BR>
From regions of the rising day,<BR>
And roamed o'er Vindhya, where the breeze<BR>
Is odorous of sandal trees.<BR>
Still in my fear I found no rest:<BR>
I sought the regions of the west,<BR>
And gazed on Asta, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_748"></A><A HREF="#fn_748"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> where the sun<BR>

Sinks when his daily course is run<BR>
Then from that noblest hill I fled<BR>
And to the northern country sped,<BR>
Saw Himav&aacute;nt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_749"></A><A HREF="ry321.htm#fn_749"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and Meru'Meru'sp,<BR>
And stood beside the northern deep.<BR>
But when, by B&aacute;li's might oppressed,<BR>
E'en in those wilds I could not rest,<BR>
Came Hanum&aacute;nwise and brave,<BR>
And thus his prudent counsel gave:<BR>
'I told thee how Matanga &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_750"></A><A HREF="ry321.htm#fn_750"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> cursed<BR>
Thy tyrant, that his head should burst<BR>
In pieces, should be dare invade<BR>
The precincts of that tranquil shade.<BR>
There may we dwell in peace and be<BR>
From thy oppressor's malice free.'<BR>
We went to Rishyam&uacute;ka's,<BR>
And spent our days secure from ill<BR>
Where, with that curse upon his head,<BR>
The cruel B&aacute;li durst not tread.'<BR>
