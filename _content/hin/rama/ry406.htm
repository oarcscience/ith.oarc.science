<P>
He ceased: they scorned, with blinded eyes,<BR>
The foeman and his bold allies,<BR>
Raised reverent bands with one accord,<BR>
And thus made answer to their lord:<BR>
'Why yield thee, King, to causeless fear?<BR>
A mighty host with sword and spear<BR>
And mace and axe and pike and lance<BR>
Waits but thy signal to advance.<BR>
Art thou not he who slew of old<BR>
The Serpent-Gods, and stormed their hold;<BR>
Scaled Mount Kail&aacute;sa and o'erthrew<BR>
Kuvera &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_920"></A><A HREF="#fn_920"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and his Yaksha crew,<BR>

<P>
Compelling S'iva's haughty friend<BR>
Beneath a mightier arm to bend?<BR>
Didst thou not bring from realms afar<BR>
The marvel of the magic car,<BR>
When they who served Kuvera fell<BR>
Crushed in their mountain citadel?<BR>
Attracted by thy matchless fame<BR>
To thee, a suppliant, Maya came,<BR>
The lord of every D&aacute;nav band,<BR>
And won thee with his daughter's hand.<BR>
Thy arm in hell itself was felt,<BR>
Where V&aacute;suki&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_921"></A><A HREF="#fn_921"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and S'ankha dwelt,<BR>
And they and Takshak, overthrown,<BR>
Were forced thy conquering might to own.<BR>
The Gods in vain their blessing gave<BR>
To heroes bravest of the brave,<BR>
Who strove a year and, sorely pressed,<BR>
Their victor's peerless might confessed.<BR>
In vain their magic arts they tried,<BR>
In vain thy matchless arm defied.<BR>
King Varun's sons with fourfold force,<BR>
Cars, elephants, and foot, and horse,<BR>
But for a while thy power withstood,<BR>
And, conquered, mourned their hardihood.<BR>
Thou hast encountered, face to face,<BR>
King Yama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_922"></A><A HREF="#fn_922"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with his murdering mace.<BR>
Fierce as the wild tempestuous aea,<BR>
What terror had his wrath for thee,<BR>
Though death in every threatening form,<BR>
And woe and torment, urged the storm?<BR>
Thine arm a glorious victory won<BR>
O'er the dread king who pities none;<BR>
And the three worlds, from terror freed,<BR>
In joyful wonder praised thy deed.<BR>
The tribe of Warriors, strong and dread<BR>
As Indra's self, o'er earth had spread;<BR>
As giant trees that towering stand<BR>
ln mountain glens, they filled the land.<BR>
Can Raghu's son encounter foes<BR>
Fierce, numerous, and strong as those?<BR>
Yet, trained in war and practised well,<BR>
O'ermatched by thee, they fought and fell,<BR>
Stay in thy royal home, nor care<BR>
The battle and the toil to share;<BR>
But let the easy fight be won<BR>
By Indrajit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_923"></A><A HREF="#fn_923"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> thy matchless son.<BR>
All, all shall die, if thou permit,<BR>
Slain by the hand of Indrajit.'<BR>
