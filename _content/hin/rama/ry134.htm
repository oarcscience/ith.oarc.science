<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, when the morning rose,<BR>
Called Lakshman gently from repose:<BR>
'Awake, the pleasant voices hear<BR>
Of forest birds that warble near.<BR>
Scourge of thy foes, no longer stay;<BR>
The hour is come to speed away.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The slumbering prince unclosed his eyes<BR>
When thus his brother bade him rise,<BR>
Compelling, at the timely cry,<BR>
Fatigue, and sleep, and rest to fly.<BR>
The brothers rose and S&iacute;t&aacute; too;<BR>
Pure water from the stream they drew,<BR>
Paid morning rites, then followed still<BR>
The road to Chitrak&uacute;ta's hill.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma as he took the road<BR>
With Lakshman, while the morning, glowed,<BR>
To the Videhan lady cried,<BR>
S&iacute;t&aacute; the fair, the lotus-eyed:<BR>
'Look round thee, dear; each flowery tree<BR>
Touched with the fire of morning see:<BR>
The Kins'uk, now the Frosts are fled,--<BR>
How glorious with his wreaths of red!<BR>
The Bel-trees see, so loved of men,<BR>
Hanging their boughs in every glen.<BR>
O'erburthened with their fruit and flowers:<BR>
A plenteous store of food is ours.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  See, Lakshman, in the leafy trees,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Where'er they make their home.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Down hangs, the work of labouring bees<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The ponderous honeycomb.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In the fair wood before us spread<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The startled wild-cock cries:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hark, where the flowers are soft to tread,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The peacock's voice replies.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where elephants are roaming free,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And sweet birds' songs are loud,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The glorious Chitrak&uacute;ta see:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His peaks are in the cloud.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  On fair smooth ground he stands displayed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Begirt by many a tree:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  O brother, in that holy shade<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    How happy shall we be!'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, Lakshman, Sit&aacute;, each<BR>
Spoke raising suppliant hands this speech<BR>
To him, in woodland dwelling met,<BR>
V&aacute;lmiki, ancient anchoret:<BR>
'O Saint, this mountain takes the mind,<BR>
With creepers, trees of every kind,<BR>
Vith fruit and roots abounding thus,<BR>
A pleasant life it offers us:<BR>
Here for a while we fain would stay,<BR>
And pass a season blithe and gay.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then the great saint, in duty trained,<BR>
With honour gladly entertained:<BR>
He gave his guests a welcome fair,<BR>
And bade them sit and rest them there,<BR>
R&aacute;ma of mighty arm and chest<BR>
His faithful Lakshman then addressed:<BR>
'Brother, bring hither from the wood<BR>
Selected timber strong and good,<BR>
And build therewith a little cot;<BR>
My heart rejoices in the spot<BR>
That lies beneath the mountain's side,<BR>
Remote, with water well supplied.'<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;'s son his words obeyed,<BR>
Brought many a tree, and deftly made,<BR>
With branches in the forest cut,<BR>
As R&aacute;ma bade, a leafy hut.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, when the cottage stood<BR>
Fair, firmly built, and walled with wood,<BR>
To Lakshman spake, whose eager mind<BR>
To do his brother's will inclined:<BR>
'Now, Lakshman as our cot is made,<BR>
Must sacrifice be duly paid<BR>
By us, for lengthened life who hope,<BR>
With venison of the antelope.<BR>
Away, O bright-eyed Lakshman, speed:<BR>
Struck by thy bow a deer must bleed:<BR>
As Scripture bids, we must not slight<BR>
The duty that commands the rite.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lakshman, the chief whose arrows laid<BR>
His foemen low, his word obeyed;<BR>
And R&aacute;ma thus again addressed<BR>
The swift performer of his hest:<BR>
'Prepare the venison thou hast shot,<BR>
To sacrifice for this our cot.<BR>
Haste, brother dear, for this the hour,<BR>
And this the day of certain power.'<BR>
Then glorious Lakshman took the buck<BR>
His arrow in the wood had struck;<BR>
Bearing his mighty load he came,<BR>
And laid it in the kindled flame.<BR>

<P>
Soon as he saw the meat was done,<BR>
And that the juices ceased to run<BR>
From the broiled carcass, Lakshman then<BR>
Spoke thus to R&aacute;ma best of men:<BR>
'The carcass of the buck, entire,<BR>
Is ready dressed upon the fire.<BR>
Now be the sacred rites begun<BR>
To please the God, thou godlike one.'<BR>

<P>
R&aacute;ma the good, in ritual trained,<BR>
Pure from the bath, with thoughts restrained,<BR>
Hasted those verses to repeat<BR>
Which make the sacrifice complete.<BR>
The hosts celestial came in view,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to the cot withdrew,<BR>
While a sweet sense of rapture stole<BR>
Through the unequalled hero's soul.<BR>
He paid the Vis'vedevas &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="ry135.htm#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> due.<BR>
And Rudra's right, and Vishnu's too,<BR>
Nor wonted blessings, to protect<BR>
Their new-built home, did he neglect.<BR>
With voice repressed he breathed the prayer,<BR>
Bathed duly in the river fair,<BR>
And gave good offerings that remove<BR>
The stain of sin, as texts approve.<BR>
And many an altar there he made,<BR>
And shrines, to suit the holy shade,<BR>
All decked with woodland chaplets sweet,<BR>
And fruit and roots and roasted meat,<BR>
With muttered prayer, as texts require,<BR>
Water, and grass and wood and fire.<BR>
So R&aacute;ma, Lakshman, S&iacute;t&aacute; paid<BR>
Their offerings to each God and shade,<BR>
And entered then their pleasant cot<BR>
That bore fair signs of happy lot.<BR>
They entered, the illustrious three,<BR>
The well-set cottage, fair to see,<BR>
Roofed with the leaves of many a tree,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And fenced from wind and rain;<BR>
So, at their Father Brahm&aacute;'s call,<BR>
The Gods of heaven, assembling all,<BR>
To their own glorious council hall<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Advance in shining train.<BR>
So, resting on that lovely hill,<BR>
Near the fair lily-covered rill,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The happy prince forgot,<BR>
Surrounded by the birds and deer,<BR>
The woe, the longing, and the fear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That gloom the exile's lot.<BR>

hill: it is the holiest spot of that sect of
the Hindu faith who devote themselves to
this incarnation, of Vishnu. The whole
neighbourhood is R&aacute;ma's country. Every
headland has some legend, every cavern
is connected with his name; some of the
wild fruits are still called <I>St&aacute;phal</I>, being
the reputed food of the exile. Thousands
and thousands annually visit the spot, and
round the hill is a raised foot-path, on
which the devotee, with naked feet, treads
full of pious awe.' <I>Calcutta Review</I>,
