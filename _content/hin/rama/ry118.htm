<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, S&iacute;t&aacute;, Lakshman bent<BR>
At the king's feet, and sadly went<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Round him with slow steps reverent.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma of the duteous heart<BR>
Had gained his sire's consent to part,<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; by his side he paid<BR>
Due reverence to the queen dismayed.<BR>
And Lakshman, with affection meet,<BR>
Bowed down and clasped his mother's feet.<BR>
Sumitr&aacute; viewed him as he pressed<BR>
Her feet, and thus her son addressed:<BR>
'Neglect not R&aacute;ma wandering there,<BR>
But tend him with thy faithful care.<BR>
In hours of wealth, in time of woe,<BR>
Him, sinless son, thy refuge know.<BR>
From this good law the just ne'er swerve,<BR>
That younger sons the eldest serve,<BR>
And to this righteous rule incline<BR>
All children of thine ancient line--<BR>
Freely to give, reward each rite,<BR>
Nor spare their bodies in the fight.<BR>
Let R&aacute;ma Das'aratha be,<BR>
Look upon S&iacute;t&aacute; as on me,<BR>
And let the cot wherein you dwell<BR>
Be thine Ayodhy&aacute;. Fare thee well."<BR>
Her blessing thus Sumitr&aacute; gave<BR>
To him whose soul to R&aacute;ma clave,<BR>
Exclaiming, when her speech was done,<BR>
' Go forth, O Lakshman, go, my son.<BR>
Go forth, my son to win success,<BR>
High victory and happiness.<BR>
Go forth thy foemen to destroy,<BR>
And turn again at last with joy.'<BR>
&nbsp; As M&aacute;tali his charioteer<BR>
Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear,<BR>
Sumantra, palm to palm applied,<BR>
In reverence trained, to R&aacute;ma cried:<BR>
'O famous Prince, my car ascend,--<BR>
May blessings on thy course attend,--<BR>
And swiftly shall my horses flee<BR>
And place thee where thou biddest me.<BR>
The fourteen years thou hast to stay<BR>
Far in the wilds, begin to-day;<BR>
For Oueen Kaikey&iacute; cries, Away."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then S&iacute;t&aacute;, best of womankind,<BR>
Ascended, with a tranquil mind,<BR>
Soon as her toilet task was done,<BR>
That chariot brilliant as the sun.<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman true and bold<BR>
Sprang on the car adorned with gold.<BR>
The king those years had counted o'er,<BR>
And given S&iacute;t&aacute; robes and store<BR>
Of precious ornaments to wear<BR>
When following her husband there.<BR>
The brothers in the car found place<BR>
For nets and weapons of the chase,<BR>
There warlike arms and mail they laid,<BR>
A leathern basket and a spade.<BR>
Soon as Sumantra saw the three<BR>
Were seated in the chariot, he<BR>
Urged on each horse of noble breed,<BR>
Who matched the rushing wind in speed.<BR>
As thus the son of Raghu went<BR>

<P>
Forth for his dreary banishment,<BR>
Chill numbing grief the town assailed,<BR>
All strength grew weak, all spirit failed,<BR>
Ayodh&aacute; through her wide extent<BR>
Was filled with tumult and lament:<BR>
Steeds neighed and shook the bells they bore,<BR>
Each elephant returned a roar.<BR>
Then all the city, young and old,<BR>
Wild with their sorrow uncontrolled,<BR>
Rushed to the car, as, from the sun<BR>
The panting herds to water run.<BR>
Before the car, behind, they clung,<BR>
And there as eagerly they hung,<BR>
With torrents streaming from their eyes,<BR>
Called loudly with repeated cries:<BR>
'Listen, Sumantra: draw thy rein;<BR>
Drive gently, and thy steeds restrain.<BR>
Once more on R&aacute;ma will we gaze,<BR>
Now to be lost for many days.<BR>
The queen his mother has, be sure,<BR>
A heart of iron, to endure<BR>
To see her godlike R&aacute;ma go,<BR>
Nor feel it shattered by the blow.<BR>
S&iacute;t&aacute;, well done! Videha's pride,<BR>
Still like his shadow by his side;<BR>
Rejoicing in thy duty still<BR>
As sunlight cleaves to Meru's hill.<BR>
Thou, Lakshman, too, hast well deserved,<BR>
Who from thy duty hast not swerved,<BR>
Tending the peer of Gods above,<BR>
Whose lips speak naught but words of love.<BR>
Thy firm resolve is nobly great,<BR>
And high success on thee shall wait.<BR>
Yea, thou shalt win a priceless meed--<BR>
Thy path with him to heaven shall lead,'<BR>
As thus they spake, they could not hold<BR>
The tears that down their faces rolled,<BR>
While still they followed for a space<BR>
Their darling of Ikshv&aacute;ku's race.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  There stood surrounded by a ring<BR>
Of mournful wives the mournful king;<BR>
For, 'I will see once more,' he cried,<BR>
'Mine own dear son,' and forth he hied.<BR>
As he came near, there rose the sound<BR>
Of weeping, as the dames stood round.<BR>
So the she-elephants complain<BR>
When their great lord and guide is slain.<BR>
Kakutstha's son, the king of men,<BR>
The glorious sire, looked troubled then,<BR>
As the full moon is when dismayed<BR>
By dark eclipse's threatening shade.<BR>
Then Das'aratha's son, designed<BR>
For highest fate of lofty mind.<BR>
Urged to more speed the charioteer,<BR>
'Away, away! why linger here?<BR>
Urge on thy horses,' Rama cried,<BR>
And 'Stay, O stay,' the people sighed.<BR>
Sumantra, urged to speed away,<BR>
The townsmen's call must disobey,<BR>
Forth as the long-armed hero went,<BR>

The dust his chariot wheels up sent<BR>
Was laid by streams that ever flowed<BR>
From their sad eyes who filled the road.<BR>
Then, sprung of woe, from eyes of all<BR>
The women drops began to fall,<BR>
As from each lotus on the lake<BR>
The darting fish the water shake.<BR>
When he, the king of high renown,<BR>
Saw that one thought held all the town,<BR>
Like some tall tree he fell and lay,<BR>
Whose root the axe has hewn away.<BR>
Then straight a mighty cry from those<BR>
Who followed R&aacute;ma's car arose,<BR>
Who saw their monarch fainting there<BR>
Beneath that grief too great to bear.<BR>
Then 'R&aacute;ma, R&aacute;ma!" with the cry<BR>
Of 'Ah, his mother!' sounded high,<BR>
As all the people wept aloud<BR>
Around the ladies' sorrowing crowd.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma backward turned his eye,<BR>
And saw the king his father lie<BR>
With troubled sense and failing limb,<BR>
And the sad queen, who followed him,<BR>
Like some young creature in the net,<BR>
That will not, in its misery, let<BR>
Its wild eyes on its mother rest,<BR>
So, by the bonds of duty pressed,<BR>
His mother's look he could not meet.<BR>
He saw them with their weary feet,<BR>
Who, used to bliss, in cars should ride,<BR>
Who ne'er by sorrow should be tried,<BR>
And, as one mournful look he cast,<BR>
'Drive on,' he cried, 'Sumantra, fast.'<BR>
As when the driver's torturing hook<BR>
Goads on an elephant, the look<BR>
Of sire and mother in despair<BR>
Was more than  R&aacute;ma's heart could bear.<BR>
As mother kine to stalls return<BR>
Which hold the calves for whom they yearn,<BR>
So to the car she tried to run<BR>
As a cow seeks her little one.<BR>
Once and again the hero's eyes<BR>
Looked on his mother, as with cries<BR>
Of woe she called and gestures wild,<BR>
'O S&iacute;t&aacute;, Lakshman, O my child!'<BR>
'Stay,' cried the king, 'thy chariot stay:'<BR>
'On, on,' cried R&aacute;ma, 'speed away.'<BR>
As one between two hosts, inclined<BR>
To neither was Sumantra's mind.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma spake these words again:<BR>
'A lengthened woe is bitterest pain.<BR>
On, on; and if his wrath grow hot,<BR>
Thine answer be, ' I heard thee not.'<BR>
Sumantra, at the chief's behest,<BR>
Dismissed the crowd that toward him pressed,<BR>
And, as he bade, to swiftest speed<BR>
Urged on his way each willing steed.<BR>
The king's attendants parted thence,<BR>
And paid him heart-felt reverence:<BR>
In mind, and with the tears he wept,<BR>
Each still his place near R&aacute;ma kept.<BR>
As swift away the horses sped,<BR>
His lords to Das'aratha said:<BR>
'To follow him whom thou again<BR>
Wouldst see returning home is vain.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With failing limb and drooping mien<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He heard their counsel wise:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Still on their son the king and queen<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Kept fast their lingering eyes. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="ry119.htm#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
