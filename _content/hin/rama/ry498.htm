<P>
But R&aacute;ma, when he first looked down<BR>
And saw afar Ayodhy&aacute;'s town,<BR>
Had called Hanum&aacute;n to his side,<BR>
The chief on whom his heart relied,<BR>
And said: 'Brave V&aacute;nar, good at need,<BR>
Haste onward, to Ayodhy&aacute; speed,<BR>
And learn, I pray, if all be well<BR>
With those who in the palace dwell.<BR>
But an thou speedest on thy way<BR>
Awhile at S'ringavera stay.<BR>
Tell Guha the Nish&aacute;das' lord,<BR>
That victor, with my queen restored,<BR>
In health and strength with many a friend<BR>
Homeward again my steps I bend<BR>
Thence by the road that he will show<BR>
On to Avodhy&aacute; swiftly go.<BR>
There with my love my brother greet,<BR>
And all our wondrous tale repeat.<BR>
Say that victorious in the strife<BR>
I come with Lakshman and my wife,<BR>
Then mark with keenest eye each trace<BR>
Of joy or grief on Bharat's face.<BR>
Be all his gestures closely viewed,<BR>

Each change of look and attitude.<BR>
Where breathes the man who will not cling<BR>
To all that glorifies a king?<BR>
Where beats the heart that can resign<BR>
An ancient kingdom, nor repine<BR>
To lose a land renowned for breeds<BR>
Of elephants and warrior steeds?<BR>
If, won by custom day by day,<BR>
My brother Bharat thirsts for sway,<BR>
Still let him rule the nations, still<BR>
The throne of old Ikshv&aacute;ku fill.<BR>
Go, mark him well: his feelings learn,<BR>
And, ere we yet be near return.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: and, garbed in human form,<BR>
Forth sped Hanum&aacute;n swift as storm.<BR>
Sublime in air he rose, and through<BR>
The region of his father flew.<BR>
He saw far far beneath his feet<BR>
Where Gang&aacute;'s flood and Jumna meet.<BR>
Descending from the upper air<BR>
He entered S'ringavera, where<BR>
King Guha's heart was well content<BR>
To hear the message R&aacute;ma sent.<BR>
Then, with his mighty strengtn renewed,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chief big way pursued,<BR>
V&aacute;l&uacute;kin&iacute; was far behind,<BR>
And Gomat&iacute; with forests lined,<BR>
And golden fields and pastures gay<BR>
With flocks and herds beneath him lay.<BR>
Then Nandigr&aacute;ma charmed his eye<BR>
Where flowers were bright with every dye,<BR>
And trees of lovely foliage made<BR>
With meeting boughs delightful shade,<BR>
Where women watched in trim array<BR>
Their little sons' and grandsons' play.<BR>
His eager eye on Bharat fell<BR>
Who sat before his lonely cell.<BR>
In hermit weed, with tangled hair,<BR>
Pale, weak, and worn with ceaseless care.<BR>
His royal pomp and state resigned<BR>
For R&aacute;ma still he watched and pined,<BR>
Still to his dreary vows adhered,<BR>
And royal R&aacute;ma's shoes revered.<BR>
Yet still the terror of his arm<BR>
Preserved the land from fear and harm.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Wind-God's son, in form a man,<BR>
Raised reverent hands and thus began:<BR>
'Fond greeting, Prince, I bring to thee,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's self has sent it: he<BR>
For whom thy spirit sorrows yet<BR>
As for a hapless anchoret<BR>
In Dandak wood, in dire distress,<BR>
With matted hair and hermit dress.<BR>
This sorrow from thy bosom fling,<BR>
And hear the tale of joy I bring.<BR>
This day thy brother shalt thou meet<BR>
Exulting in his foe's defeat,<BR>
Freed from his toil and lengthened vow,<BR>
The light of victory on his brow,<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute;, Lakshman and his friends<BR>
Homeward at last his steps he bends.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then joy, too mighty for control,<BR>
Rushed in full flood o'er Bharat's soul;<BR>
His reeling sense and strength gave way,<BR>
And fainting on the earth he lay,<BR>
At length upspringing from the ground,<BR>
His arms about Hanum&aacute;n wound,<BR>
With tender tears of rapture sprung,<BR>
He dewed the neck to which he clung:<BR>
'Art thou a God or man,' he cried,<BR>
'Whom love and pity hither guide?<BR>
For this a hundred thousand kine,<BR>
A hundred villages be thine.<BR>
A score of maids of spotless lives<BR>
To thee I give to be thy wives,<BR>
Of golden hue and bright of face,<BR>
Each lovely for her tender grace.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased a while by joy subdued,<BR>
And then his eager speech renewed;<BR>
