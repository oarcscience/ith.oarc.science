<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XVII.: R&Aacute;MA'S APPROACH.</H3>
<P>
As R&aacute;ma, rendering blithe and gay<BR>
His loving friends, pursued his way,<BR>
He saw on either hand a press<BR>
Of mingled people numberless.<BR>
The royal street he traversed, where<BR>
Incense of aloe filled the air,<BR>
Where rose high palaces, that vied<BR>
With paly clouds, on either side;<BR>
With flowers of myriad colours graced.<BR>
And food for every varied taste,<BR>
Bright as the glowing path o'erhead<BR>
Which feet of Gods celestial tread,<BR>
Loud benedictions, sweet to hear,<BR>
From countless voices soothed his ear.<BR>
While he to each gave due salute<BR>
His place and dignity to suit:<BR>
'Be thou,' the joyful people cried,<BR>
'Be thou our guardian, lord and guide.<BR>
Throned and anointed king to-day,<BR>
Thy feet set forth upon the way<BR>
Wherein, each honoured as a God,<BR>
Thy fathers and forefathers trod.<BR>
Thy sire and his have graced the throne,<BR>
And loving care to us have shown:<BR>
Thus blest shall we and ours remain,<BR>
Yea still more blest in R&aacute;ma's reign.<BR>

<P>
No more of dainty fare we need,<BR>
And but one cherished object heed,<BR>
That we may see our prince today<BR>
Invested with imperial sway.<BR>

<P>
Such were the words and pleasant speech<BR>
That R&aacute;ma heard, unmoved, from each<BR>
Of the dear friends around him spread,<BR>
As onward through the street he sped,<BR>
For none could turn his eye or thought<BR>
From the dear form his glances sought,<BR>
With fruitless ardour forward cast<BR>
Even when Raghu's son had past.<BR>
And he who saw not R&aacute;ma nigh,<BR>
Nor caught a look from R&aacute;ma's eye,<BR>
A mark for scorn and general blame,<BR>
Reproached himself in bitter shame,<BR>
For to each class his equal mind<BR>
With sympathy and love inclined<BR>
Most fully of the princely four;<BR>
So greatest love to him they bore.<BR>

<P>
His circling course the hero bent<BR>
Round shrine and altar, reverent,<BR>
Round homes of Gods, where cross-roads met,<BR>
Where many a sacred tree was set.<BR>
Near to his father's house he drew<BR>
Like Indra's beautiful to view,<BR>
And with the light his glory gave<BR>
Within the royal palace drave.<BR>
Through three broad courts, where bowmen kept<BR>
Their watch and ward, his coursers swept,<BR>
Then through the two remaining went<BR>
On foot the prince pre?inent.<BR>
Through all the courts the hero passed,<BR>
And gained the ladies' bower at last;<BR>
Then through the door alone withdrew,<BR>
And left without his retinue.<BR>
When thus the monarch's noble boy<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Had gone his sire to meet,<BR>
The multitude, elate with joy,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Stood watching in the street,<BR>
And his return with eager eyes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Expected at the gates,<BR>
As for his darling moon to rise<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The King of Rivers &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="ry096.htm#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> waits.<BR>
