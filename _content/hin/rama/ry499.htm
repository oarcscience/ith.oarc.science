<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CXXVIII.: HANUM&Aacute;N'S STORY.</H3>
<P>
'In doubt and fear long years have passed<BR>
And glorious tidings come at last.<BR>
True, true is now the ancient verse<BR>
Which men in time of bliss rehearse:<BR>
Once only in a hundred years<BR>
Great joy to mortal men appears.<BR>
But now his woes and triumph tell,<BR>
And loss and gain as each befell.'<BR>
He ceased: Hanum&aacute;n mighty-souled<BR>
The tale of R&aacute;ma's wanderings told<BR>
From that first day on which he stood<BR>
In the drear shade of Dandak wood.<BR>
He told how fierce Vir&aacute;dha fell;<BR>
He told of S'arabhanga's cell<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma saw with wondering eyes<BR>
Indra descended from the skies.<BR>
He told how S&uacute;rpanukhi came,<BR>
Her soul aglow with amorous flame,<BR>
And fled repulsed, with rage and tears,<BR>
Reft of her nose and severed ears.<BR>
He told how R&aacute;ma's might subdued<BR>
The giants' furious multitude;<BR>
How Khara with the troops he led<BR>
And Tris'iras and D&uacute;shan bled:<BR>
How R&aacute;ma, tempted from his cot,<BR>
The golden deer pursued and shot,<BR>
And R&aacute;van came and stole away<BR>
The Maithil queen his hapless prey,<BR>
When, as he fought, the dame to save,<BR>
His noble life Jat&aacute;yus gave:<BR>
How R&aacute;ma still the the search renewed,<BR>
The robber to his hold pursued,<BR>
Bridging the sea from shore to shore,<BR>
And found his queen to part no more. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1048"></A><A HREF="#fn_1048"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
