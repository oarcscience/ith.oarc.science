<P>
'Yet more remain, brave chiefs who stake<BR>
Their noble lives for R&aacute;ma's sake.<BR>
See, glorious, golden-coated, one<BR>
Who glisters like the morning sun,<BR>
Whom thousands of his race surround,<BR>
'Tis Hara for his strength renowned,<BR>
Next comes a mighty chieftain, he<BR>
Whose legions, armed with rock and tree,<BR>
Press on, in numbers passing tale,<BR>
The ramparts of our town to scale.<BR>
O R&aacute;van, see the king advance<BR>
Terrific with his fiery glance,<BR>
Girt by the bravest of his train,<BR>
Majestic as the God of Rain,<BR>
Parjanya, when his host of clouds<BR>
About the king, embattled, crowds:<BR>
On Rikshav&aacute;n's high mountain nursed,<BR>
In Narmad&aacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_950"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A>  he slakes his thirst,<BR>
Dh&uacute;mra, proud ursine chief, who leads<BR>
Wild warriors whom the forest breeds.<BR>
His brother, next in strength and age,<BR>
In J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n the famous sage.<BR>
Of yore his might and skill he lent<BR>
To him who rules the firmament,<BR>
And Indra's liberal boons repaid<BR>
The chieftain for the timely aid.<BR>
There like a gloomy cloud that flies<BR>
Borne by the tempest through the skies,<BR>
Pram&aacute;th&iacute; stands: he roamed of yore<BR>
The forest wilds on Gang&aacute;'s shore,<BR>
Where elephants were struck with dread<BR>
And trembling at his coming fled.<BR>
There on his foes he loved to sate<BR>
The old hereditary hate. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_951"></A><A HREF="#fn_951"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>

Look, Gaja and Gav&aacute;ksha show<BR>
Their lust of battle with the foe.<BR>
See Nala burning for the fray,<BR>
And N&iacute;la chafing at delay,<BR>
Behind the eager captains press<BR>
Wild hosts in numbers numberless,<BR>
And each for R&aacute;ma's sake would fall<BR>
Or force his way through Lank&aacute;'s wall.'<BR>

hostility between V&aacute;nars and elephants.</P>
