<P>
Soon as the Maithil lady knew<BR>
That high through air the giant flew,<BR>
Distressed with grief and sore afraid<BR>
Her troubled spirit sank dismayed.<BR>
Then, as anew the waters welled<BR>
From those red eyes which sorrow swelled,<BR>
Fresh in keen words her passion broke,<BR>
And to the fierce-eyed fiend she spoke:<BR>

<P>
'Canst thou attempt a deed so base.<BR>
Untroubled by the deep disgrace.--<BR>
To steal me from my home and fly,<BR>
When friend or guardian none was nigh!<BR>
Thy craven soul that longed to steal,<BR>
Fearing the blows that warriors deal.<BR>
Upon a magic deer relied<BR>
To lure my husband from my side,<BR>
Friend of his sire, the vulture king<BR>
Lies low on earth with mangled wing,<BR>
Who gave his aged life for me<BR>
And died for her he sought to free.<BR>
Ah, glorious strength indeed is thine,<BR>
Thou meanest of thy giant line,<BR>
Whose courage dared to tell thy name<BR>
And conquer in the fight a dame.<BR>
Does the vile deed that thou hast done<BR>
Cause thee no shame, thou wicked one--<BR>
A woman from her home to rend<BR>
When none was near his aid to lend?<BR>
Through all the worlds, O giant King,<BR>
The tidings of this deed will ring,<BR>
This deed in law and honour's spite<BR>
By one who claims a hero's might.<BR>
Shame on thy boasted valour, shame!<BR>
Thy prowess is an empty name,<BR>
Shame, giant, on this cursed deed<BR>
For which thy race is doomed to bleed!<BR>
Thou fliest swifter than the gale,<BR>
For what can strength like thine avail?<BR>
Stay for one hour, O R&aacute;van, stay;<BR>
Thou shalt not flee with life away.<BR>
Soon as the royal chieftains' sight<BR>
Falls on the thief who roams by night,<BR>
Thou wilt not, tyrant, live one hour<BR>
Though backed by all thy legions' power,<BR>
Ne'er can thy puny strength sustain<BR>
The tempest of their arrowy rain:<BR>
Have e'er the trembling birds withstood<BR>
The wild flames raging in the wood?<BR>
Hear me, O R&aacute;van, let me go,<BR>
And save thy soul from coming woe.<BR>
Or if thou wilt not not me free,<BR>
Wroth for this insult done to me.<BR>
With his brave brother's aid my lord<BR>
Against thy life will raise his sword.<BR>
A guilty hope inflames thy breast<BR>
His wife from R&aacute;ma's home to wrest.<BR>
Ah fool, the hope thou hast is vain;<BR>
Thy dreams of bliss shall end in pain!<BR>
If torn from all I love by thee<BR>
Mv godlike lord no more I see,<BR>
Soon will I die and end my woes,<BR>
Nor live the captive of my foes,.<BR>
Ah fool, with blinded eyes to choose<BR>
The evil and the good refuse!<BR>
So the sick wretch with stubborn will<BR>
Turns fondly to the **cates that kill,<BR>
And madly draws his lips away<BR>
From medicine that would check decay.<BR>
About thy neck securely wound<BR>

The deadly coil of Fate is bound,<BR>
And thou, O Ravan, dost not fear<BR>
Although the hour of death is near.<BR>
With death-doomed sight thine eyes behold<BR>
The gleaming of the trees of gold,--<BR>
See dread Vaitarani, the flood<BR>
Thatt rolls a stream of foamy blood,--<BR>
See the dark wood by all abhorred--<BR>
Its every leaf a threatening sword.<BR>
The tangled thickets thou shall tread<BR>
Where thorns with iron points are spread,<BR>
For never can thy days be long,<BR>
Base plotter of this shame and wrong<BR>
To R&aacute;ma of ihe lofty soul:<BR>
He dies who drinks the poisoned bowl.<BR>
The coils of death around thee lie:<BR>
They hold thee and thou canst not fly.<BR>
Ah whither, tyrant, wouldst thou run<BR>
The vengeance of my lord to shun?<BR>
By his unaided arm alone<BR>
Were twice seven thousand fiends o'er-thrown:<BR>
Yes, in the twinkling of an eye<BR>
He forced thy mightiest fiends to die.<BR>
And shall that lord of lion heart,<BR>
Skilled in the bow and spear and dart,<BR>
Spare thee, O fiend, in battle strife,<BR>
The robber of his darling wife?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  These were her words, and more beside,<BR>
By wrath and bitter hate supplied.<BR>
Then by her woe and fear o'erthrown<BR>
She wept again and made her moan.<BR>
As long she wept in grief and dread,<BR>
Scarce conscious of the words she said,<BR>
The wicked giant onward fled<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And bore her through the air.<BR>
As firm he held the Maithil dame,<BR>
Still wildly struggling, o'er her frame<BR>
With grief and bitter misery came<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The trembling of despair.<BR>
