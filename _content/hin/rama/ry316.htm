Then to Sushen Sugr&iacute;va bent,<BR>
And thus addressed him reverent:<BR>
'Two hundred thousand of our best<BR>
With thee, my lord, shall seek the west.<BR>
Explore Sur&aacute;shtra's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_716"></A><A HREF="#fn_716"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> distant plain,<BR>
Explore V&aacute;hl&iacute;ka's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_717"></A><A HREF="#fn_717"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> wild domain,<BR>
And all the pleasant brooks that flee<BR>
Through mountains to the western sea.<BR>
Search clustering groves on mountain<BR>
heights,<BR>
And woods the whom of anchorites.<BR>
Search where the breezy hills are high,<BR>
Search where the desert regions lie.<BR>
Search all the western land beset<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
With woody mountains like a net.<BR>
The country's farthest limit reach,<BR>
And stand upon the ocean beach.<BR>
There wander through the groves of palm<BR>
Where the soft air is full of balm.<BR>
Through grassy dell and dark ravine<BR>
Seek R&aacute;van and the Maithil queen.<BR>
Go visit Somagiri's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_718"></A><A HREF="#fn_718"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> steep<BR>
Where Sindhu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_719"></A><A HREF="#fn_719"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> mingles with the deep.<BR>
There lions, borne on swift wings, roam<BR>
The levels of their mountain home,<BR>
And elephants and monsters bear,<BR>
Caught from the ocean, to their lair.<BR>
You V&aacute;nars, changing forms at will.<BR>
With rapid search must scour the hill,<BR>
And his sky-kissing peak of gold<BR>
Where loveliest trees their blooms unfold.<BR>
There golden-peaked, ablaze with light,<BR>
Uprises P&aacute;riy&aacute;tra's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_720"></A><A HREF="#fn_720"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> height<BR>
Where wild Gandharvas, fierce and fell,<BR>
In bands of countless myriads dwell.<BR>
Pluck ye no fruit within the wood;<BR>
Beware the impious neighbourhood,<BR>
Where, very mighty, strong, and hard<BR>
To overcome, the fruit they guard.<BR>
Yet search for Janak's daughter still,<BR>
For V&aacute;nars there need fear no ill.<BR>
Near, bright as turkis, Vajra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_721"></A><A HREF="#fn_721"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A> named,<BR>
There stands a hill of diamond framed.<BR>
Soaring a hundred leagues in pride,<BR>
With trees and creepers glorified.<BR>
Search there each cave and dark abyss<BR>
By waterfall and precipice.<BR>
Far in that sea the wild waves beat<BR>
On Chakrav&aacute;n's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_722"></A><A HREF="#fn_722"><FONT SIZE="1">5b</FONT></A> firm-rooted feet.<BR>
Where the great discus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_723"></A><A HREF="#fn_723"><FONT SIZE="1">6b</FONT></A> thousand rayed,<BR>
By V&iacute;svakarm&aacute;'s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_724"></A><A HREF="#fn_724"><FONT SIZE="1">7b</FONT></A> art was made.<BR>
When Panchajan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_725"></A><A HREF="#fn_725"><FONT SIZE="1">8b</FONT></A> the fiend was slain.<BR>
And Hayagr&iacute;va,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_726"></A><A HREF="#fn_726"><FONT SIZE="1">9b</FONT></A> fierce in vain,<BR>

Thence taking shell and discus went<BR>
Lord Vishnu, God preeminent.<BR>
On sixty thousand hills of gold<BR>
With wondering eyes shall ye behold,<BR>
Where in his glory every one<BR>
Is brilliant as the morning sun.<BR>
Full in the midst King Meru,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_727"></A><A HREF="#fn_727"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> best<BR>
Of mountains, lifts his lofty crest,<BR>
On whom of yore, as all have heard,<BR>
The sun well-pleased this boon conferred:<BR>
'On thee, O King, on thee and thine<BR>
Light, day and night, shall ever shine.<BR>
Gandharvas, Gods who love thee well<BR>
And on thy sacred summits dwell,<BR>
Undimmed in lustre, bright and fair,The golden sheen shall ever share.'<BR>
The Vis'vas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_728"></A><A HREF="#fn_728"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Vasus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_729"></A><A HREF="#fn_729"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> they who ride<BR>
The tempest,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_730"></A><A HREF="#fn_730"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> every God beside,<BR>
Draw nigh to Meru's lofty crest<BR>
When evening darkens in the west,<BR>
And to the parting Lord of Day<BR>
The homage of their worship pay,<BR>
Ere yet a while, unseen of all,<BR>
Behind Mount Asta's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_731"></A><A HREF="#fn_731"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> peaks he fall.<BR>
Wrought by the heavenly artist's care<BR>
A glorious palace glitters there,<BR>
And round about it sweet birds sing<BR>
Where the gay trees are blossoming:<BR>

The home of Varun &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_732"></A><A HREF="ry317.htm#fn_732"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> high souled-lord,<BR>
Wrist-girded with his deadly cord.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_733"></A><A HREF="ry317.htm#fn_733"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
With ten tall stems, a palm between<BR>
Meru and Asta's hill is seen:<BR>
Pure silver from the base it springs,<BR>
And far and wide its lustre flings.<BR>
Seek R&aacute;vanthe dame by brook,<BR>
In pathless glen, in leafy nook<BR>
On Meru's crest a hermit lives<BR>
Bright with the light that penance gives:<BR>
S&aacute;varni &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_734"></A><A HREF="ry317.htm#fn_734"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> is he named, renowned<BR>
As Brahm&aacute;'s peer, with glory crowned.<BR>
There bowing down in reverence speak<BR>
And ask him of the dame you seek.<BR>
Thus far the splendid Lord of Day<BR>
Pursues through heaven his ceaseless way,<BR>
Shedding on every spot his light;<BR>
Then sinks behind Mount Asta's height,<BR>
Thus far advance: the sunless sea<BR>
Beyond is all unknown to me.<BR>
Sushen of mighty arm, long tried<BR>
In peril, shall your legions guide,<BR>
Receive his words with high respect,<BR>
And ne'er his lightest wish neglect.<BR>
He is my consort's sire, and hence<BR>
Deserves the utmost reverence.'<BR>

rises Meru must be always on the north;
and as the sun's rays do not penetrate beyond
the centre of the mountain, the regions
beyond, or to the north of it must
be in darkness, whilst those on the south
of it must be in light: north and south
being relative, not absolute, terms, depending
on the position of the spectator
with regard to the Sun and Meru." WILSON'S
