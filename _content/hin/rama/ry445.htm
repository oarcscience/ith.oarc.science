<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLVI.: INDRAJIT'S TRIUMPH.</H3>
<P>
The V&aacute;nar chiefs whose piercing eyes<BR>
Scanned eagerly the earth and skies,<BR>
Saw the brave brothers wounded sore<BR>
Transfixed with darts and stained with gore.<BR>
The monarch of the V&aacute;nar race,<BR>
With wise Vibh&iacute;shan, reached the place;<BR>
Angad and N&iacute;la came behind,<BR>
And others of the forest kind,<BR>
And standing with Han&uacute;m&aacute;n there<BR>
Lamented for the fallen pair.<BR>
Their melancholy eyes they raised;<BR>
In fruitless search a while they gazed,<BR>
But magic arts Vibh&iacute;shan knew;<BR>
Not hidden from his keener view,<BR>
Though veiled by magic from the rest,<BR>
The son of R&aacute;van stood confessed,<BR>
Fierce Indrajit with savage pride<BR>
The fallen sons of Raghu eyed,<BR>
And every giant heart was proud<BR>
As thus the warrior cried aloud:<BR>

<P>
'Slain by mine arrows R&aacute;ma lies,<BR>
And closed in death are Lakshman's eyes.<BR>
Dead are the mighty princes who<BR>
D&uacute;shan and Khara smote and slew.<BR>
The Gods and fiends may toil in vain<BR>
To free them from the binding chain.<BR>
The haughty chief, my father's dread,<BR>
Who drove him sleepless from his bed,<BR>
While Lank&aacute;, troubled like a brook<BR>
In rain time, heard his name and shook:<BR>
He whose fierce hate our lives pursued<BR>
Lies helpless by my shafts subdued.<BR>
Now fruitless is each wondrous deed<BR>
Wrought by the race the forests breed,<BR>
And fruitless every toil at last<BR>
Like cloudlets when the rains are past.'<BR>
Then rose the shout of giants loud<BR>
As thunder from a bursting cloud,<BR>
When, deeming R&aacute;ma, dead, they raised<BR>
Their voices and the conqueror praised.<BR>

<P>
Still motionless, as lie the slain,<BR>
The brothers pressed the bloody plain,<BR>
No sigh they drew, no breath they heaved,<BR>
And lay as though of life bereaved.<BR>
Proud of the deed his art had done,<BR>
To Lank&aacute;'s town went R&aacute;van's son,<BR>
Where, as he passed, all fear was stilled,<BR>
And every heart with triumph filled.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va trembled as he viewed<BR>
Each fallen prince with blood bedewed,<BR>
And in his eyes which overflowed<BR>
With tears the flame of anger glowed.<BR>
'Calm,' cried Vibh&iacute;shan, 'calm thy fears,<BR>
And stay the torrent of thy tears.<BR>
Still must the chance of battle change,<BR>
And victory still delight to range.<BR>
Our cause again will she befriend<BR>
And bring us triumph in the end.<BR>
This is not death: each prince will break<BR>
The spell that holds him, and awake;<BR>
Nor long shall numbing magic bind<BR>
The mighty arm, the lofty mind.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: his finger bathed in dew<BR>
Across Sugr&iacute;va's eyes he drew;<BR>
From dulling mist his vision freed.<BR>
And spoke these words to suit the need:<BR>
'No time is this for fear: away<BR>
With fainting heart and weak delay.<BR>
Now, e'en the tear which sorrow wrings<BR>
From loving eyes destruction brings.<BR>
Up, on to battle at the head<BR>
Of those brave troops which R&aacute;ma led.<BR>
Or guardian by his side remain<BR>
Till sense and strength the prince regain.<BR>
Soon shall the trance-bound pair revive,<BR>
And from our hearts all sorrow drive.<BR>
Though prostrate on the earth he lie,<BR>

<P>
Deem not that R&aacute;ma's death is nigh;<BR>
Deem not that Lakshm&iacute; will forget<BR>
Or leave her darling champion yet.<BR>
Rest here and be thy heart consoled;<BR>
Ponder my words, be firm and bold.<BR>
I, foremost in the battlefield,<BR>
Will rally all who faint or yield.<BR>
Their staring eyes betray their fear;<BR>
They whisper each in other's ear.<BR>
They, when they hear my cheering cry<BR>
And see the friend of R&aacute;ma nigh,<BR>
Will cast their gloom and fears away<BR>
Like faded wreaths of yesterday.'<BR>

<P>
Thus calmed he King Sugr&iacute;va's dread;<BR>
Then gave new heart to those who fled.<BR>
Fierce Indrajit, his soul on fire<BR>
With pride of conquest, sought his sire,<BR>
Raised reverent hands, and told him all,<BR>
The battle and the princes' fall.<BR>
Rejoicing at his foes' defeat<BR>
Upsprang the monarch from his seat,<BR>
Girt by his giant courtiers: round<BR>
His warrior son his arms he wound,<BR>
Close kisses on his head applied,<BR>
And heard again how R&aacute;ma died.<BR>
