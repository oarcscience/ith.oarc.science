<P>
When, best of all who give delight,<BR>
her rama wandered for from sight,<BR>
Kausaaly'a weeping, sore distressed,<BR>
The king her husband thus addressed;<BR>
'Thy name, O Monarch, far and wid?<BR>
Through the three worlds is glorified:<BR>
Yet Rama has the praying mind.  *<BR>
His speed is true, his heart is kind.<BR>
How will thy sons, good lord, sustain<BR>
With Sita, all their care and pain?<BR>
How in the wild endure distress,<BR>
Nursed in the lap of tenderness?<BR>
How will the dear Videhan bear<BR>
The heat and cold when wandering there<BR>
Bred in the bliss of princely state,<BR>
So young and fair find delicate?<BR>
The large-eyed lady, wont to eat<BR>
The best of finely seasoned meat--<BR>
How will she now her life sustain<BR>
With woodland fare of self-sown grain?<BR>
Will she, with joys encompassed long,<BR>
Who loved the music and the song,<BR>
In the wild wood endure to hear<BR>
The ravening lion's voice of fear?<BR>
Where sleeps my strong-armed hero, where<BR>

<P>
Like Lord Mahendra's standard, fair?<BR>
Where is, by Lakshman's side, his bed,<BR>
His club-like arm beneath his head?<BR>
When shall I see his flower-like eyes,<BR>
And face that with the lotus vies,<BR>
Feel his sweet lily breath, and view<BR>
His glorious hair and lotus hue?<BR>
The heart within my breast, I feel,<BR>
Is adamant or hardest steel,<BR>
Or, in a thousand fragments split,<BR>
The loss of him had shattered it,<BR>
When those I love, who should be blest,<BR>
Are wandering in the wood distressed,<BR>
Condemned their wretched lives to lead<BR>
In exile, by thy ruthless deed.<BR>
If, when the fourteen years are past,<BR>
R&aacute;ma reseeks his home at last,<BR>
I think not Bharat will consent<BR>
To yield the wealth and government.<BR>
At funeral feasts some mourners deal<BR>
To kith and kin the solemn meal,<BR>
And having duly fed them all<BR>
Some Br&aacute;hmans to the banquet call.<BR>
The best of Br&aacute;hmans, good and wise,<BR>
The tardy summoning despise,<BR>
And, equal to the Gods, disdain<BR>
Cups, e'en of Amrit, thus to drain,<BR>
Nay e'en when Br&aacute;mans first have fed,<BR>
They loathe the meal for others spread,<BR>
And from the leavings turn with scorn,<BR>
As bulls avoid a fractured horn.<BR>
So R&aacute;ma, sovereign lord of men,<BR>
Will spurn the sullied kingship then:<BR>
He born the eldest and the best,<BR>
His younger's leavings will detest,<BR>
Turning from tasted food away,<BR>
As tigers scorn another's prey.<BR>
The sacred post is used not twice,<BR>
Nor elements, in sacrifice.<BR>
But once the sacred grass is spread,<BR>
But once with oil the flame is fed:<BR>
So R&aacute;ma's pride will ne'er receive<BR>
The royal power which others leave,<BR>
Like wine when tasteless dregs are left<BR>
Or rites of Soma juice bereft,<BR>
Be sure the pride of Raghu's race<BR>
Will never stoop to such disgrace:<BR>
Ths lordly lion will not bear<BR>
That man should beard him in his lair.<BR>
Were all the worlds against him ranged<BR>
His dauntless soul were still unchanged:<BR>
He, dutiful, in duty strong,<BR>
Would purge the impious world from wrong.<BR>
Could not the hero, brave and bold,<BR>
The archer, with his shafts of gold,<BR>
Burn up the very seas, as doom<BR>
Will in the end all life consume!<BR>
Of lion's might, eyed like a bull,<BR>
A prince so brave and beautiful,<BR>
Thou hast with wicked hate pursued,<BR>
Like sea-born tribes who eat their brood.<BR>
If thou, O Monarch, hadst but known<BR>
The duty all the Twice-born own,<BR>
If the good laws had touched thy mind,<BR>
Which sages in the Scriptures find,<BR>
Thou ne'er hadst driven forth to pine<BR>
This brave, this duteous son of thine.<BR>
First on her lord the wife depends,<BR>
Next on her son and last on friends:<BR>
These three supports in life has she,<BR>
And not a fourth for her may be.<BR>
Thy heart, O King, I have not won;<BR>
In wild woods roams my banished son;<BR>
Far are my friends: ah, hapless me,<BR>
Quite ruined and destroyed by thee.'<BR>
