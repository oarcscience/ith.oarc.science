<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIII.: THE SACRIFICE FINISHED.</H3>
<P>
The circling year had filled its course,<BR>
And back was brought the wandering horse:<BR>
Then upon Sarj&uacute;'s northern strand<BR>
Began the rite the king had planned.<BR>
With Rishyas'ring the forms to guide,<BR>
The Br&aacute;hmans to their task applied,<BR>
At that great offering of the steed<BR>
Their lofty-minded king decreed.<BR>
The priests, who all the Scripture knew,<BR>
Performed their part in order due,<BR>
And circled round in solemn train<BR>
As precepts of the law ordain.<BR>
Pravargya rites &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> were duly sped:<BR>
For Upusads &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the flames were fed.<BR>
Then from the plant &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the juice was squeezed,<BR>
And those high saints with minds well pleased<BR>
Performed the mystic rites begun<BR>
With bathing ere the rise of sun.<BR>
They gave the portion Indra's claim,<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>


<P>
And hymned the King whom none can blame.<BR>
The mid-day bathing followed next,<BR>
Observed as bids the holy text.<BR>
Then the good priests with utmost care,<BR>
In form that Scripture's rules declare,<BR>
For the third time pure water shed<BR>
On high souled Das'aratha's head.<BR>
Then Rishyas'ring and all the rest<BR>
To Indra and the Gods addressed<BR>
Their sweet-toned hymn of praise and prayer,<BR>
And called them in the rite to share.<BR>
With sweetest song and hymn intoned<BR>
They give the Gods in heaven enthroned,<BR>
As duty bids, the gifts they claim,<BR>
The holy oil that feeds the flame.<BR>
And many an offering there was paid,<BR>
And not one slip in all was made,<BR>
For with most careful heed they saw<BR>
That all was done by Veda law.<BR>
None, all those days, was seen oppressed<BR>
By hunger or by toil distressed.<BR>
Why speak of human kind? No beast<BR>
Was there that lacked an ample feast.<BR>
For there was store for all who came,<BR>
For orphan child and lonely dame;<BR>
The old and young were well supplied,<BR>
The poor and hungry satisfied.<BR>
Throughout the day ascetics fed,<BR>
And those who roam to beg their bread:<BR>
While all around the cry was still,<BR>
'Give forth, give forth,' and ' Eat your fill.'<BR>
'Give forth with liberal hand the meal,<BR>
And various robes in largess deal.'<BR>
Urged by these cries on every side<BR>
Unweariedly their task they plied:<BR>
And heaps of food like hills in size<BR>
In boundless plenty met the eyes:<BR>
And lakes of sauce, each day renewed,<BR>
Refreshed the weary multitude.<BR>
And strangers there from distant lands,<BR>
And women folk in crowded bands<BR>
The best of food and drink obtained<BR>
At the great rite the king ordained.<BR>
Apart from all, the Br&aacute;hmans there,<BR>
Thousands on thousands, took their share<BR>
Of various dainties sweet to taste,<BR>
On plates of gold and silver placed,<BR>
All ready set, as, when they willed,<BR>
The twice-born men their places filled.<BR>
And servants in fair garments dressed<BR>
Waited upon each Br&aacute;hman guest.<BR>
Of cheerful mind and mien were they,<BR>
With gold and jewelled earrings gay.<BR>
The best of Br&aacute;hmans praised the fare<BR>
Of countless sorts, of flavour rare:<BR>
And thus to Raghu's son they cried:<BR>
'We bless thee, and are satisfied.'<BR>
Between the rites some Br&aacute;hmans spent<BR>
The time in learned argument,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_23"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 23</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
With ready flow of speech, sedate,<BR>
And keen to vanquish in debate. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
There day by day the holy train<BR>
Performed all rites as rules ordain.<BR>
No priest in all that host was found<BR>
But kept the vows that held him bound:<BR>
None, but the holy Vedas knew,<BR>
And all their six-fold science &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> too.<BR>
No Br&aacute;hman there was found unfit<BR>
To speak with eloquence and wit.<BR>

<P>
And now the appointed time came near<BR>
The sacrificial posts to rear.<BR>
They brought them, and prepared to fix<BR>
Of Bel &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and Kh&aacute;dir &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> six and six;<BR>
Six, made of the Pal&aacute;s'a &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> tree,<BR>
Of Fig-wood one, apart to be:<BR>
Of Sleshm&aacute;t &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and of Devad&aacute;r &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A><BR>
One column each, the mightiest far:<BR>
So thick the two, the arms of man<BR>
Their ample girth would fail to span.<BR>
All these with utmost care were wrought<BR>
By hand of priests in Scripture taught,<BR>
And all with gold were gilded bright<BR>
To add new splendour to the rite:<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>


<P>
Twenty-and-one those stakes in all,<BR>
Each one-and-twenty cubits tall:<BR>
And one-and-twenty ribbons there<BR>
Hung on the pillars, bright and fair.<BR>
Firm in the earth they stood at last,<BR>
Where cunning craftsmen fixed them fast;<BR>
And there unshaken each remained,<BR>
Octagonal and smoothly planed.<BR>
Then ribbons over all were hung,<BR>
And flowers and scent around them flung.<BR>
Thus decked they cast a glory forth<BR>
Like the great saints who star the north. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
The sacrificial altar then<BR>
Was raised by skilful twice-born men,<BR>
In shape and figure to behold<BR>
An eagle with his wings of gold,<BR>
With twice nine pits and formed three-fold<BR>
Each for some special God, beside<BR>
The pillars were the victims tied;<BR>
The birds that roam the wood, the air,<BR>
The water, and the land were there,<BR>
And snakes and things of reptile birth,<BR>
And healing herbs that spring from earth;<BR>
As texts prescribe, in Scripture found,<BR>
Three hundred victims there were bound.<BR>
The steed devoted to the host<BR>
Of Gods, the gem they honour most,<BR>
Was duly sprinkled. Then the Queen<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;, with delighted mien,<BR>
With reverent steps around him paced.<BR>
And with sweet wreaths the victim graced;<BR>
Then with three swords in order due<BR>
She smote the steed with joy, and slew.<BR>
That night the queen, a son to gain,<BR>
With calm and steady heart was fain<BR>
By the dead charger's side to stay<BR>
From evening till the break of day.<BR>
Then came three priests, their care to lead<BR>
The other queens to touch the steed,<BR>
Upon Kaus'aly&aacute; to attend,<BR>
Their company and aid to lend.<BR>
As by the horse she still reclined,<BR>
With happy mien and cheerful mind,<BR>
With Rishyas'ring the twice-born came<BR>
And praised and blessed the royal dame.<BR>
The priest who well his duty knew,<BR>
And every sense could well subdue,<BR>
From out the bony chambers freed<BR>
And boiled the marrow of the steed.<BR>
Above the steam the monarch bent,<BR>
And, as he smelt the fragrant scent,<BR>
In time and order drove afar<BR>
All error that his hopes could mar.<BR>
Then sixteen priests together came<BR>
And cast into the sacred flame<BR>
The severed members of the horse,<BR>
Made ready all in ordered course.<BR>
On piles of holy Fig-tree raised<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The meaner victims' bodies blazed:<BR>
The steed, of all the creatures slain,<BR>
Alone required a pile of cane.<BR>
Three days, as is by law decreed,<BR>
Lasted that Offering of the Steed.<BR>
The Chatushtom began the rite,<BR>
And when the sun renewed his light,<BR>
The Ukthya followed: after came<BR>
The Atir&aacute;tra's holy flame.<BR>
These were the rites, and many more<BR>
Arranged by light of holy lore,<BR>
The Aptory&aacute;m of mighty power,<BR>
And, each performed in proper hour,<BR>
The Abhijit and Vis'vajit<BR>
With every form and service fit;<BR>
And with the sacrifice at night<BR>
The Jyotishtom and &Aacute;yus rite. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>


<P>


<P>
The task was done, as laws prescribe:<BR>
The monarch, glory of his tribe,<BR>
Bestowed the land in liberal grants<BR>
Upon the sacred ministrants.<BR>
He gave the region of the east,<BR>
His conquest, to the Hotri priest.<BR>
The west, the celebrant obtained:<BR>
The south, the priest presiding gained:<BR>
The northern region was the share<BR>
Of him who chanted forth the prayer, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Thus did each priest obtain his meed<BR>
At the great Slaughter of the Steed,<BR>
Ordained, the best of all to be,<BR>
By self-existent deity.<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's son with joyful mind<BR>
This noble fee to each assigned,<BR>
But all the priests with one accord<BR>
Addressed that unpolluted lord:<BR>
'Tis thine alone to keep the whole<BR>
Of this broad earth in firm control.<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
No gift of lands from thee we seek:<BR>
To guard these realms our hands were weak.<BR>
On sacred lore our days are spent:<BR>
Let other gifts our wants content.'<BR>
The chief of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's line<BR>
Gave them ten hundred thousand kine,<BR>
A hundred millions of fine gold,<BR>
The same in silver four times told.<BR>
But every priest in presence there<BR>
With one accord resigned his share.<BR>
To Saint Vas'ishtha, high of soul,<BR>
And Rishyas'ring they gave the whole.<BR>
That largess pleased those Brahmans well,<BR>
Who bade the prince his wishes tell.<BR>
Then Das'aratha, mighty king.<BR>
Made answer thus to Rishyas'ring:<BR>
'O holy Hermit, of thy grace,<BR>
Vouchsafe the increase of my race.'<BR>
He spoke; nor was his prayer denied:<BR>
The best of Br&aacute;hmans thus replied:<BR>
'Four sons, O Monarch, shall be thine,<BR>
Upholders of thy royal line.'<BR>

'&Aacute;gnishtoma is the name of a sacrifice,
or rather a series of offerings to fire for
five days. It is the first and principal
part of the Jyotishtoma, one of the great
sacrifices in which especially the juice of
the Soma plant is offered for the purpose
of obtaining Swarga or heaven.' GOLDST&Uuml;CKER'S
DICTIONARY. 'The <I>&Aacute;gnishtoma</I>
is Agni. It is called so because they
(the gods) praised him with this Stoma.
They called it so to hide the proper meaning
of the word: for the gods like to hide
the proper meaning of words.'

<P>
'On account of four classes of gods
having praised Agni with four Stomas,
the whole was called <I>Chatushtoma</I> (containing
four Stomas).'

<P>
'It (the &Aacute;gnishtoma) is called <I>Jyotishtoma</I>,
for they praised Agni when he had
risen up (to the sky) in the shape of a
light (<I>jyotis</I>).'

<P>
'This (&Aacute;gnishtoma) is a sacrificial performance
which has no beginning and
no end.' HAUG'S <I>Aitareya Br&aacute;hmanam</I>.

<P>
The Atir&aacute;tra, literally <I>lasting through
the night</I>, is a division of the service of
the Jyotishtoma.

<P>
The Abhijit, <I>the everywhere victorious</I>,
is the name of a sub-division of the great
sacrifice of the Gav&aacute;manaya.

<P>
The Vis'vajit, or <I>the all-conquering</I>, is
a similar sub-division.

<P>
&Aacute;yus is the name of a service forming
a division of the Abhiplava sacrifice.

<P>
'The <I>Aptory&aacute;m</I>, is the seventh or last
part of the Jyotishtoma, for the performance
of which it is not essentially necessary,
but a voluntary sacrifice instituted
for the attainment of a specific desire.
The literal meaning of the word would
be in conformity with the <I>Praudhamanoram&aacute;</I>,
a sacrifice which procures the
attainment of the desired object. GOLDST&Uuml;CKER'S
DICTIONARY.

<P>
'The <I>Ukthya</I> is a slight modification of
the Agnishtoma sacrifice. The noun to
be supplied to it is <I>kratu</I>. It is a Soma
sacrifice also, and one of the seven Sansthas
or component parts of the Jyotishtoma.
Its name indicates its nature.
For <I>Ukthya</I> means "what refers to the
Uktha," which is an older name for
Sh&aacute;stra, i.e. recitation of one of the Hotri
priests at the time of the Soma libations.
Thus this sacrifice is only a kind of supplement
to the Agnishtoma.' HAUG.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_103"></A><A HREF="ry015.htm#fr_103">24:1b</A>  'Four classes of priests were required
in India at the most solemn sacrifices.
1. The officiating priests, manual labourers,
and acolytes, who had chiefly to prepare
the sacrificial ground, to dress the
altar, slay the victims, and pour out the
libations. 2. The choristers, who chant
the sacred hymns. 3. The reciters or
readers, who repeat certain hymns. 4.
The overseers or bishops, who watch and
superintend the proceedings of the other
priests, and ought to be familiar with all
the Vedas. The formulas and verses to
be muttered by the first class are contained
in the Yajur-veda-sanhit&aacute;. The hymns
to be sung by the second class are in the
Sama-veda-sanhit&aacute;. The Atharva-veda
in said to be intended for the Brahman
or overseer, who is to watch the proceedings
of the sacrifice, and to remedy any
mistake that may occur. The hymns to
he recited by the third class are contained
in the Rigveds,' <I>Chips from a German Workshop</I>.</P>
