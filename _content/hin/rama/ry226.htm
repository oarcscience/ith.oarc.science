But when he turned his eye where bled<BR>
Both Tris'iras and D&uacute;shan dead,<BR>
Fear o'er the giant's spirit came<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma's might which naught could tame.<BR>
He saw his savage legions, those<BR>
Whose force no creature dared oppose,--<BR>
He saw the leader of his train<BR>
By R&aacute;ma's single prowess slain.<BR>
With burning grief he marked the few<BR>
Still left him of his giant crew.<BR>
As Namuchi &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_474"></A><A HREF="#fn_474"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> on Indra, so<BR>
Rushed the dread demon on his foe.<BR>
His mighty bow the monster strained,<BR>
And angrily on R&aacute;ma rained<BR>
His mortal arrows in a flood,<BR>
Like serpent fangs athirst for blood.<BR>
Skilled in the bowman's warlike art,<BR>
He plied the string and poised the dart.<BR>
Here, on his car, and there, he rode,<BR>
And passages of battle showed,<BR>
While all the skyey regions grew<BR>
Dark with his arrows as they flew.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma seized his ponderous bow,<BR>
And straight the heaven was all aglow<BR>
With shafts whose stroke no life might bear<BR>
That filled with flash and flame the air,<BR>
Thick as the blinding torrents sent<BR>
Down from Parjanya's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_475"></A><A HREF="#fn_475"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> firmament.<BR>
In space itself no space remained,<BR>
But all was filled with arrows rained<BR>
Incessantly from each great bow<BR>
Wielded by R&aacute;ma and his foe.<BR>
As thus in furious combat, wrought<BR>
To mortal hate, the warriors fought,<BR>
The sun himself grew faint and pale,<BR>
Obscured behind that arrowy veil.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As when beneath the driver's steel<BR>
An elephant is forced to kneel,<BR>
So from the hard and pointed head<BR>
Of many an arrow R&aacute;ma bled.<BR>
High on his car the giant rose<BR>
Prepared in deadly strife to close,<BR>

And all the spirits saw him stand<BR>
Like Yama with his noose in hand.<BR>
For Khara deemed in senseless pride<BR>
That he, beneath whose hand had died<BR>
The giant legions, failed at length<BR>
Slow sinking with exhausted strength.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma, like a lion, when<BR>
A trembling deer comes nigh his den.<BR>
Feared not the demon mad with hate,--<BR>
Of lion might and lion gait.<BR>
Then in his lofty car that glowed<BR>
With sunlike brilliance Khura rode<BR>
At R&aacute;ma: madly on he came<BR>
Like a poor moth that seeks the flame.<BR>
His archer skill the fiend displayed,<BR>
And at the place where R&aacute;ma laid<BR>
His hand, an arrow cleft in two<BR>
The mighty bow the hero drew.<BR>
Seven arrows by the giant sent,<BR>
Bright as the bolts of Indra, rent<BR>
Their way through mail and harness joints,<BR>
And pierced him with their iron points.<BR>
On R&aacute;ma, hero unsurpassed,<BR>
A thousand shafts smote thick and fast,<BR>
While as each missile struck, rang out<BR>
The giant's awful battle-shout.<BR>
His knotted arrows pierced and tore<BR>
The sunbright mail the hero wore,<BR>
Till, band and buckle rent away,<BR>
Glittering on the ground it lay.<BR>
Then pierced in shoulder, breast, and side,<BR>
Till every limb with blood was dyed,<BR>
The chieftain in majestic ire<BR>
Shone glorious as the smokeless fire.<BR>
Then loud and long the war-cry rose<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma, terror of his foes,<BR>
As, on the giant's death intent.<BR>
A ponderous bow he strung and bent,--<BR>
Lord Vishnu's own, of wondrous size,--<BR>
Agastya gave the heavenly prize.<BR>
Then rushing on the demon foe,<BR>
He raised on high that mighty bow,<BR>
And with his well-wrought shafts, whereon<BR>
Bright gold between the feathers shone,<BR>
He struck the pennon fluttering o'er<BR>
The chariot, and it waved no more.<BR>
That glorious flag whose every fold<BR>
Was rich with blazonry and gold,<BR>
Fell as the sun himself by all<BR>
The Gods' decree might earthward fall.<BR>
From wrathful Khara's hand, whose art<BR>
Well knew each vulnerable part,<BR>
Four keenly-piercing arrows flew,<BR>
And blood in R&aacute;ma's bosom drew,<BR>
With every limb distained with gore<BR>
From deadly shafts which rent and tore,<BR>
From Khara's clanging bowstring shots,<BR>
The prince's wrath waxed wondrous hot.<BR>
His hand upon his bow that best<BR>
Of mighty archers firmly pressed,<BR>
And from the well-drawn bowstring, true<BR>
Each to its mark, six arrows flew.<BR>
One quivered in the giant's head,<BR>
With two his brawny shoulders bled;<BR>
Three, with the crescent heads they bore,<BR>
Deep in his breast a passage tore.<BR>
Thirteen, to which the stone had lent<BR>
The keenest point, were swiftly sent<BR>
On the fierce giant, every one<BR>
Destructive, gleaming like the sun.<BR>
With four the dappled steeds he slew;<BR>
One cleft the chariot yoke in two.<BR>
One, in the heat of battle sped,<BR>
Smote from the neck the driver's head.<BR>
The poles were rent apart by three;<BR>
Two broke the splintered axle-tree.<BR>
Then from the hand of R&aacute;ma, while<BR>
Across his lips there came a smile.<BR>
The twelfth, like thunderbolt impelled,<BR>
Cut the great hand and bow it held.<BR>
Then, scarce by Indra's self surpassed,<BR>
He pierced the giant with the last.<BR>
The bow he trusted cleft in twain.<BR>
His driver and his horses slain,<BR>
Down sprang the giant, mace in hand,<BR>
On foot against the foe to stand.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Gods and saints in bright array<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Close gathered in the skies,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The prince's might in battle-fray<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Beheld with joyful eyes.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Uprising from their golden seats,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Their hands in honour raised,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They looked on R&aacute;ma's noble feats,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And blessed him as they praised.<BR>

and taking advantage of his friend's
confidence, he drank up Indra's strength
along with a draught of wine and Soma.
Indra then told the As'vins and Sarasvat&iacute;
that Namuchi had drunk up his strength.
The As'vins in consequence gave Indra a
thunderbolt in the form of a foam, with
which he smote off the head of Namuchi.'
