<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXXVII.: GUHA'S STORY.</H3>
<P>
That speech of Guha Bharat heard<BR>
With grief and tender pity stirred,<BR>
And as his ears the story drank,<BR>
Deep in his thoughtful heart it sank.<BR>
His large full eyes in anguish rolled,<BR>
His trembling limbs grew stiff and cold;<BR>
Then fell he, like a tree upturn,<BR>
In woe too grievous to be borne.<BR>
When Guha saw the long-armed chief<BR>
Whose eye was like a lotus leaf,<BR>
With lion shoulders strong and fair,<BR>
High-mettled, prostrate in despair,--<BR>
Pale, bitterly afflicted, he<BR>
Reeled as in earthquake reels a tree.<BR>
But when S'atrughna standing nigh<BR>
Saw his dear brother helpless lie,<BR>
Distraught with woe his head he bowed,<BR>
Embraced him oft and wept aloud.<BR>
Then Bharat's mothers came, forlorn<BR>
Of their dear king, with fasting worn,<BR>
And stood with weeping eyes around<BR>
The hero prostrate on the ground.<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;, by her woe oppressed,<BR>
The senseless Bharat's limbs caressed<BR>
As a fond cow in love and fear<BR>
Caresses oft her youngling dear:<BR>
Then yielding to her woe she said,<BR>
Weeping and sore disquieted:<BR>
'What torments, O my son, are these<BR>
Of sudden pain or swift disease?<BR>
The lives of us and all the line<BR>
Depend, dear child, on only thine.<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman forced to flee,<BR>
I live by naught but seeing thee:<BR>
For as the king has past away<BR>
Thou art my only help to-day.<BR>
Hast thou, perchance, heard evil news<BR>
Of Lakshman, which thy soul subdues,<BR>
Or R&aacute;ma dwelling with his spouse--<BR>
My all is he--neath forest boughs?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then slowly gathering sense and strength<BR>
The weeping hero rose at length,<BR>
And words like these to Guha spake,<BR>
That bade Kaus'aly&aacute; comfort take:<BR>
'Where lodged the prince that night? and where<BR>
Lakshman the brave, and S&iacute;t&aacute; fair?<BR>
Show me the couch whereon he lay,<BR>
Tell me the food he ate, I pray.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Guha the Nish&aacute;das' king<BR>
Replied to Bharat's questioning:<BR>
'Of all I had I brought the best<BR>
To serve my good and honoured guest<BR>
Food of each varied kind I chose,<BR>
And every fairest fruit that grows.<BR>
R&aacute;ma the hero truly brave<BR>
Declined the gift I humbly gave:<BR>
His Warrior part he ne'er forgot,<BR>
And what I brought accepted not:<BR>
'No gifts, my friend, may we accept:<BR>
Our law is, Give, and must be kept."<BR>
'The high-souled chief, O Monarch, thus<BR>
With gracious words persuaded us.<BR>
Then calm and still, absorbed in thought,<BR>
He drank the water Lakshman brought,<BR>
And then, obedient to his vows,<BR>
He fasted with his gentle spouse.<BR>
So Lakshman too from food abstained,<BR>

And sipped the water that remained:<BR>
Then with ruled lips, devoutly staid,<BR>
The three &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="ry166.htm#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> their evening worship paid.<BR>
Then Lakshman with unwearied care<BR>
Brought heaps of sacred grass, and there<BR>
With his own hands he quickly spread,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma's rest, a pleasant bed,<BR>
And faithful Sit&aacute;'s too, where they<BR>
Reclining each by other lay.<BR>
Then Lakshman bathed their feet, and drew<BR>
A little distance from the two.<BR>
Here stands the tree which lent them shade,<BR>
Here is the grass beneath it laid,<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma and his consort spent<BR>
The night together ere they went.<BR>
Lakshman, whose arms the foeman quell,<BR>
Watched all the night as sentinel,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And kept his great bow strung:<BR>
His hand was gloved, his arm waa braced,<BR>
Two well-filled quivers at his waist,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With deadly arrows, hung.<BR>
I took my shafts and trusty bow,<BR>
And with that tamer of the foe<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Stood ever wakeful near,<BR>
And with my followers, bow in hand,<BR>
Behind me ranged, a ready band,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kept watch o'er Indra's peer.'<BR>
