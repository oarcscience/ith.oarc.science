### CANTO IX.: RISHYAS'RING.

The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,  
Unfolded at the king's behest  
The plan the lords in council laid  
To draw the hermit from the shade:  
'The priest, amid the lordly crowd,  
To Lomapád thus spoke aloud:  
'Hear, King, the plot our thoughts have framed,  
A harmless trick by all unblamed.  
Far from the world that hermit's child  
Lives lonely in the distant wild:  
A stranger to the joys of sense,  
His bliss is pain and abstinence;  
And all unknown are women yet  
To him, a holy anchoret.  
The gentle passions we will wake  
That with resistless influence shake  
   The hearts of men; and he  
Drawn by enchantment strong and sweet  
Shall follow from his lone retreat,  
   And come and visit thee.  
Let ships be formed with utmost care  
That artificial trees may bear,  
   And sweet fruit deftly made;  
Let goodly raiment, rich and rare,  
And flowers, and many a bird be there  
   Beneath the leafy shade.  
Upon the ships thus decked a band  
Of young and lovely girls shall stand,  
Rich in each charm that wakes desire,  
And eyes that burn with amorous fire;  
Well skilled to sing, and play, and dance  
And ply their trade with smile and glance  
Let these, attired in hermits' dress,  
Betake them to the wilderness,  
And bring the boy of life austere  
A voluntary captive here.'  

He ended; and the king agreed,  
   By the priest's counsel won.  
And all the ministers took heed  
   To see his bidding done.  
In ships with wondrous art prepared  
Away the lovely women fared,  
And soon beneath the shade they stood  
Of the wild, lonely, dreary wood.  
And there the leafy cot they found  
   Where dwelt the devotee,  
And looked with eager eyes around  
   The hermit's son to see.  
Still, of Vibhándak sore afraid,  
They hid behind the creepers' shade.  
But when by careful watch they knew  
The elder saint was far from view,  
With bolder steps they ventured nigh  
To catch the youthful hermit's eye.  
Then all the damsels, blithe and gay,  
At various games began to play.  
They tossed the flying ball about  
With dance and song and merry shout,  
And moved, their scented tresses bound  
With wreaths, in mazy motion round.  
Some girls as if by love possessed,  
Sank to the earth in feigned unrest,  
Up starting quickly to pursue  
Their intermitted game anew.  
It was a lovely sight to see  
   Those fair ones, as they played,  
While fragrant robes were floating free,  
And bracelets clashing in their glee  
   A pleasant tinkling made.  
The anklet's chime, the Koïl's  <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81)
cry  
   With music filled the place  
As 'twere some city in the sky  
   Which heavenly minstrels grace.  
With each voluptuous art they strove  
To win the tenant of the grove,  
And with their graceful forms inspire  
His modest soul with soft desire.  
With arch of brow, with beck and smile,  
With every passion-waking wile  

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>  

   Of glance and lotus hand,  
With all enticements that excite  
The longing for unknown delight  
   Which boys in vain withstand.  
Forth came the hermit's son to view  
The wondrous sight to him so new,  
   And gazed in rapt surprise,  
For from his natal hour till then  
On woman or the sons of men  
   He ne'er had cast his eyes.  
He saw them with their waists so slim,  
With fairest shape and faultless limb,  
In variegated robes arrayed,  
And sweetly singing as they played.  
Near and more near the hermit drew,  
   And watched them at their game,  
And stronger still the impulse grew  
   To question whence they came.  
They marked the young ascetic gaze  
With curious eye and wild amaze,  
And sweet the long-eyed damsels sang,  
And shrill their merry laughter rang,  
Then came they nearer to his side,  
And languishing with passion cried:  
'Whose son, O youth, and who art thou,  
Come suddenly to join us now?  
And why dost thou all lonely dwell  
In the wild wood? We pray thee, tell,  
We wish to know thee, gentle youth;  
Come, tell us, if thou wilt, the truth.'  

He gazed upon that sight he ne'er  
Had seen before, of girls so fair,  
And out of love a longing rose  
His sire and lineage to disclose:  
'My father,' thus he made reply,  
'Is Kas'yap's son, a saint most high,  
Vibhándak styled; from him I came,  
And Rishyaœring he calls my name,  
Our hermit cot is near this place:  
Come thither, O ye fair of face;  
There be it mine, with honour due,  
Ye gentle youths, to welcome you.'  

They heard his speech, and gave consent,  
And gladly to his cottage went.  
Vibhándak's son received them well  
Beneath the shelter of his cell  
With guest-gift, water for their feet,  
And woodland fruit and roots to eat,  
They smiled, and spoke sweet words like these,  
Delighted with his courtesies:  
'We too have goodly fruit in store,  
Grown on the trees that shade our door;  
Come, if thou wilt, kind Hermit, haste  
The produce of our grove to taste;  
And let, O good Ascetic, first  
This holy water quench thy thirst.'  
They spoke, and gave him comfits sweet  
Prepared ripe fruits to counterfeit;  
And many a dainty cake beside  
And luscious mead their stores supplied.  
The seeming fruits, in taste and look,  
The unsuspecting hermit took,  
For, strange to him, their form beguiled  
The dweller in the lonely wild.  
Then round his neck fair arms were flung,  
And there the laughing damsels clung,  
And pressing nearer and more near  
With sweet lips whispered at his ear;  
While rounded limb and swelling breast  
The youthful hermit softly pressed.  
The pleasing charm of that strange bowl,  
   The touch of a tender limb,  
Over his yielding spirit stole  
   And sweetly vanquished him.  
But vows, they said, must now be paid;  
   They bade the boy farewell,  
And, of the aged saint afraid,  
   Prepared to leave the dell.  
With ready guile they told him where  
   Their hermit dwelling lay:  
Then, lest the sire should find them there,  
   Sped by wild paths away.  
They fled and left him there alone  
   By longing love possessed;  
And with a heart no more his own  
   He roamed about distressed.  
The aged saint came home, to find  
   The hermit boy distraught,  
Revolving in his troubled mind  
   One solitary thought.  
'Why dost thou not, my son,' he cried,  
   'Thy due obeisance pay?  
Why do I see thee in the tide  
   Of whelming thought to-day?  
A devotee should never wear  
   A mien so sad and strange.  
Come, quickly, dearest child, declare  
   The reason of the change.'  
And Rishyas'ring, when questioned thus,  
   Made answer in this wise:  
'O sire, there came to visit us  
   Some men with lovely eyes.  
About my neck soft arms they wound  
   And kept me tightly held  
To tender breasts so soft and round,  
   That strangely heaved and swelled.  
They sing more sweetly as they dance  
   Than e'er I heard till now,  
And play with many a sidelong glance  
   And arching of the brow.'  
'My son,' said he, 'thus giants roam  
   Where holy hermits are,  
And wander round their peaceful home  
   Their rites austere to mar.  
I charge thee, thou must never lay  
   Thy trust in them, dear boy:  
They seek thee only to betray,  
   And woo but to destroy.'  
Thus having warned him of his foes  
   That night at home he spent.  
And when the morrow's sun arose  

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>  

   Forth to the forest went.  

But Rishyas'ring with eager pace  
Sped forth and hurried to the place  
Where he those visitants had seen  
Of daintly waist and charming mien.  
When from afar they saw the son  
Of Saint Vibhándak toward them run,  
To meet the hermit boy they hied,  
And hailed him with a smile, and cried:  
'O come, we pray, dear lord, behold  
Our lovely home of which we told  
Due honour there to thee we'll pay,  
And speed thee on thy homeward way.'  
Pleased with the gracious words they said  
He followed where the damsels led.  
As with his guides his steps he bent,  
   That Bráhman high of worth,  
A flood of rain from heaven was sent  
   That gladdened all the earth.  

Vibhándak took his homeward road,  
And wearied by the heavy load  
Of roots and woodland fruit he bore  
Entered at last his cottage door.  
Fain for his son he looked around,  
But desolate the cell he found.  
He stayed not then to bathe his feet,  
Though fainting with the toil and heat,  
But hurried forth and roamed about  
Calling the boy with cry and shout,  
He searched the wood, but all in vain;  
Nor tidings of his son could gain.  

One day beyond the forest's bound  
The wandering saint a village found,  
And asked the swains and neatherds there  
Who owned the land so rich and fair,  
With all the hamlets of the plain,  
And herds of kine and fields of grain.  
They listened to the hermit's words,  
And all the guardians of the herds,  
With suppliant hands together pressed,  
This answer to the saint addressed:  
The Angas' lord who bears the name  
Of Lomapád, renowned by fame,  
Bestowed these hamlets with their kine  
And all their riches, as a sign  
Of grace, on Rishyas'ring: and he  
Vibhándak's son is said to be.'  
The hermit with exulting breast  
The mighty will of fate confessed,  
By meditation's eye discerned;  
And cheerful to his home returned.  

A stately ship, at early morn,  
The hermit's son away had borne.  
Loud roared the clouds, as on he sped,  
The sky grew blacker overhead;  
Till, as he reached the royal town,  
A mighty flood of rain came down.  
By the great rain the monarch's mind  
The coming of his guest divined.  
To meet the honoured youth he went,  
And low to earth his head he bent.  
With his own priest to lead the train,  
He gave the gift high guests obtain.  
And sought, with all who dwelt within  
The city walls, his grace to win.  
He fed him with the daintiest fare,  
He served him with unceasing care,  
And ministered with anxious eyes  
Lest anger in his breast should rise;  
And gave to be the Bráhman's bride  
His own fair daughter, lotus-eyed.  

Thus loved and honoured by the king,  
The glorious Bráhman Rishyas'ring  
Passed in that royal town his life  
With S'ántá his beloved wife.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_81"></span>[16:1](ry011.htm#fr_81) The Koïl or *kokila*
(Cuculus Indicus) as the harbinger of spring and love is a universal
favourite with Indian poets. His voice when first heard in a glorious
spring morning is not unpleasant, but becomes in the hot season
intolerably wearisome to European ears.
