<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO L.: JANAK.</H3>
<P>
The sons of Raghu journeyed forth,<BR>
Bending their steps 'twixt east and north.<BR>
Soon, guided by the sage, they found,<BR>
Enclosed, a sacrificial ground.<BR>
Then to the best of saints, his guide,<BR>
In admiration R&aacute;ma cried:<BR>

<P>
The high-souled king no toil has spared,<BR>
But nobly for his rite prepared.<BR>
How many thousand Br&aacute;hmans here,<BR>
From every region, far and near,<BR>
Well read in holy lore, appear!<BR>
How many tents, that sages screen,<BR>
With wains in hundreds, here are seen!<BR>
Great Br&aacute;hman, let us find a place<BR>
Where we may stay and rest a space.'<BR>
The hermit did as R&aacute;ma prayed,<BR>
And in a spot his lodging made,<BR>

<P>

<P>
Far from the crowd, sequestered, clear,<BR>
With copious water flowing near.<BR>

<P>
Then Janak, best of kings, aware<BR>
Of Vis'v&aacute;mitra lodging there,<BR>
With S'at&aacute;nanda for his guide--<BR>
The priest on whom he most relied.<BR>
His chaplain void of guile and stain--<BR>
And others of his priestly train,<BR>
Bearing the gift that greets the guest,<BR>
To meet him with all honour pressed.<BR>
The saint received with gladsome mind<BR>
Each honour and observance kind:<BR>
Then of his health he asked the king,<BR>
And how his rites were prospering,<BR>
Janak, with chaplain and with priest,<BR>
Addressed the hermits, chief and least,<BR>
Accosting all, in due degree,<BR>
With proper words of courtesy.<BR>
Then, with his palms together laid,<BR>
The king his supplication made:<BR>
'Deign, reverend lord, to sit thee down<BR>
With these good saints of high renown.'<BR>
Then sate the chief of hermits there,<BR>
Obedient to the monarch's prayer.<BR>
Chaplain and priest, and king and peer,<BR>
Sate in their order, far or near.<BR>
Then thus the king began to say:<BR>
'The Gods have blest my rite to-day,<BR>
And with the sight of thee repaid<BR>
The preparations I have made.<BR>
Grateful am I, so highly blest,<BR>
That thou, of saints the holiest,<BR>
Hast come, O Br&aacute;hman, here with all<BR>
These hermits to the festival.<BR>
Twelve days, O Br&aacute;hman Sage, remain--<BR>
For so the learned priests ordain--<BR>
And then, O heir of Kus'ik's name,<BR>
The Gods will come their dues to claim.'<BR>

<P>
With looks that testified delight<BR>
Thus spake he to the anchorite,<BR>
Then with his suppliant hands upraised,<BR>
He asked, as earnestly he gazed:<BR>
'These princely youths, O Sage, who vie<BR>
In might with children of the sky,<BR>
Heroic, born for happy fate,<BR>
With elephants' or lions' gait,<BR>
Bold as the tiger and the bull,<BR>
With lotus eyes so large and full,<BR>
Armed with the quiver, sword and bow,<BR>
Whose figures like the As'vins show,<BR>
Like children of the heavenly Powers,<BR>
Come freely to these shades of ours,--<BR>
How have they reached on foot this place?<BR>
What do they seek, and what their race?<BR>
As sun and moon adorn the sky,<BR>
This spot the heroes glorify:<BR>
Alike in stature, port, and mien,<BR>
The same fair form in each is seen.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>

<P>
Thus spoke the monarch, lofty-souled.<BR>
The saint, of heart unfathomed, told<BR>
How, sons of Das'aratha, they<BR>
Accompanied his homeward way,<BR>
How in the hermitage they dwelt,<BR>
And slaughter to the demons dealt:<BR>
Their journey till the spot they neared<BR>
Whence fair Vis'&aacute;l&aacute;'s towers appeared:<BR>
Ahaly&aacute; seen and freed from taint;<BR>
Their meeting with her lord the saint;<BR>
And how they thither came, to know<BR>
The virtue of the famous bow.<BR>

<P>
Thus Vis'v&aacute;mitra spoke the whole<BR>
To royal Janak, great of soul.<BR>
And when this wondrous tale was o'er,<BR>
The glorious hermit said no more.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_219"></A><A HREF="ry050.htm#fr_219">62:1</A>   The preceding sixteen lines have
occured before in Canto XLVIII. This
Homeric custom of repeating a passage of
several lines is strange to our poet. This
is the only instance I remember. The
repetition of single lines is common enough.' SCHLEGEL.</P>
