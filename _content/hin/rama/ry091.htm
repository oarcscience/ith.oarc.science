<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIII.: DAS'ARATHA'S DISTRESS.</H3>
<P>
Unworthy of his mournful fate,<BR>
The mighty king, unfortunate,<BR>
Lay prostrate in unseemly guise,<BR>
As, banished from the blissful skies,<BR>
Yay&aacute;ti, in his evil day.<BR>
His merit all exhausted, lay. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The queen, triumphant in the power<BR>
Won by her beauty's fatal dower,<BR>
Still terrible and unsubdued,<BR>
Her dire demand again renewed:<BR>
'Great Monarch,'twas thy boast till now<BR>
To love the truth and keep the vow;<BR>
Then wherefore would thy lips refuse<BR>
The promised boon 'tis mine to choose?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  King Das'aratha, thus addressed,<BR>
With anger raging in his breast,<BR>
Sank for a while beneath the pain,<BR>
Then to Kaikey&iacute; spoke again:<BR>

<P>
'Childless so long, at length I won,<BR>
With mighty toil, from Heaven a son,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, the mighty-armed; and how<BR>
Shall I desert my darling now?<BR>
A scholar wise, a hero bold,<BR>
Of patient mood, with wrath controlled,<BR>
How can I bid my R&aacute;ma fly,<BR>
My darling of the lotus eye?<BR>
In heaven itself I scarce could bear,<BR>
When asking of my R&aacute;ma there,<BR>
To hear the Gods his griefs declare,<BR>
And O, that death would take me hence<BR>
Before I wrong his innocence!'<BR>

<P>
As thus the monarch wept and wailed,<BR>
And maddening grief his heart assailed,<BR>
The sun had sought his resting-place,<BR>
And night was closing round apace.<BR>
But yet the moon-crowned night could bring<BR>
No comfort to the wretched king.<BR>
As still he mourned with burning sighs<BR>
And fixed his gaze upon the skies:<BR>
'O Night whom starry fires adorn,<BR>
I long not for the coming morn.<BR>
Be kind and show some mercy: see,<BR>
My suppliant hands are raised to thee.<BR>
Nay, rather fly with swifter pace;<BR>
No longer would I see the face<BR>
Of Queen Kaikey&iacute;, cruel, dread,<BR>
Who brings this woe upon mine head.'<BR>
Again with suppliant hands he tried<BR>
To move the queen, and wept and sighed:<BR>
'To me, unhappy me, inclined<BR>
To good, sweet dame, thou shouldst be kind;<BR>
Whose life is well-nigh fled, who cling<BR>
To thee for succour, me thy king.<BR>
This, only this, is all my claim:<BR>
Have mercy, O my lovely dame.<BR>
None else have I to take my part.<BR>
Have mercy: thou art good at heart.<BR>
Hear, lady of the soft black eye.<BR>
And win a name that ne'er shall die:<BR>
Let R&aacute;ma rule this glorious land,<BR>
The gift of thine imperial hand.<BR>
O lady of the dainty waist,<BR>
With eyes and lips of beauty graced,<BR>
Please R&aacute;ma, me, each saintly priest,<BR>
Bharat, and all from chief to least.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She heard his wild and mournful cry,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    She saw the tears his speech that broke,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Saw her good husband's reddened eye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      But, cruel still, no word she spoke.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His eyes upon her face he bent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And sought for mercy, but in vain:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She claimed his darling's banishment,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He swooned upon the ground again.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_276"></A><A HREF="ry091.htm#fr_276">106:1</A>  Only the highest merit obtains a home
in heaven for ever. Minor degrees of
merit procure only leases of heavenly
mansions terminable after periods proportioned
to the fund which buys them. King
Yay&aacute;ti went to heaven and when his term
expired was unceremoniously ejected, and
thrown down to earth.</P>
