<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVII.: S&Iacute;T&Aacute;'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
His sweetly-speaking bride, who best<BR>
Deserved her lord, he thus addressed.<BR>
Then tender love bade passion wake,<BR>
And thus the fair Videhan spake:<BR>
'What words are these that thou hast said?<BR>
Contempt of me the thought has bred.<BR>
O best of heroes, I dismiss<BR>
With bitter scorn a speech like this:<BR>

<P>

<P>
Unworthy of a warrior's fame<BR>
It taints a monarch's son with shame,<BR>
Ne'er to be heard from those who know<BR>
The science of the sword and bow.<BR>
My lord, the mother, sire, and son,<BR>
Receive their lots by merit won;<BR>
The brother and the daughter find<BR>
The portions to their deeds aligned.<BR>
The wife alone, whate'er await,<BR>
Must share on earth her husband's fate.<BR>
So now the king's command which sends<BR>
Thee to the wild, to me extends.<BR>
The wife can find no refuge, none,<BR>
In father, mother, self, or son:<BR>
Both here, and when they vanish hence,<BR>
Her husband is her sole defence.<BR>
If, Raghu's son, thy steps are led<BR>
Where Dandak's pathless wilds are spread,<BR>
My foot before thine own shall pass<BR>
Through tangled thorn and matted grass.<BR>
Dismiss thine anger and thy doubt:<BR>
Like refuse water cast them out,<BR>
And lead me, O my hero, hence--<BR>
I know not sin--with confidence.<BR>
Whate'er his lot,'tis far more sweet<BR>
To follow still a husband's feet<BR>
Than in rich palaces to lie,<BR>
Or roam at pleasure through the sky.<BR>
My mother and my sire have taught<BR>
What duty bids, and trained each thought,<BR>
Nor have I now mine ear to turn<BR>
The duties of a wife to learn,<BR>
I'll seek with thee the woodland dell<BR>
And pathless wild where no men dwell,<BR>
Where tribes of silvan creatures roam,<BR>
And many a tiger makes his home.<BR>
My life shall pass as pleasant there<BR>
As in my father's palace fair.<BR>
The worlds shall wake no care in me;<BR>
My only care be truth to thee.<BR>
There while thy wish I still obey,<BR>
True to my vows with thee I'll stray,<BR>
And there shall blissful hours be spent<BR>
In woods with honey redolent.<BR>
In forest shades thy mighty arm<BR>
Would keep a stranger's life from harm,<BR>
And how shall Sit&aacute; think of fear<BR>
When thou, O glorious lord, art near?<BR>
Heir of high bliss, my choice is made,<BR>
Nor can I from my will be stayed.<BR>
Doubt not; the earth will yield me roots,<BR>
These will I eat, and woodland fruits;<BR>
And as with thee I wander there<BR>
I will not bring thee grief or care.<BR>
I long, when thou, wise lord, art nigh,<BR>
All fearless, with delighted eye<BR>
To gaze upon the rocky hill,<BR>
The lake, the fountain, and the hill;<BR>
To sport with thee, my limbs to cool,<BR>
In some pure lily-covered pool,<BR>
While the white swan's and mallard's wings<BR>

<P>
Are plashing in the water-springs.<BR>
So would a thousand seasons flee<BR>
Like one sweet day, if spent with thee.<BR>
Without my lord I would not prize<BR>
A home with Gods above the skies:<BR>
Without my lord, my life to bless,<BR>
Where could be heaven or happiness?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Forbid me not: with thee I go<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The tangled wood to tread.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  There will I live with thee, as though<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    This roof were o'er my head.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My will for thine shall be resigned;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thy feet my steps shall guide.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thou, only thou, art in my mind:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I heed not all beside.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy heart shall ne'er by me be grieved;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Do not my prayer deny:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Take me, dear lord; of thee bereaved<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thy Sit&aacute; swears to die.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  These words the duteous lady spake,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Nor would he yet consent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His faithful wife with him to take<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To share his banishment.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He soothed her with his gentle speech;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To change her will he strove:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And much he said the woes to teach<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of those in wilds who rove.<BR>
