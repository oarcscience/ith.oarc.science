<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLIII.: THE WONDROUS DEER.</H3>
<P>
She stooped, her hands with flowers to fill,<BR>
But gazed upon the marvel still:<BR>
Gazed on its back and sparkling side<BR>
Where silver hues with golden vied.<BR>
Joyous was she of faultless mould,<BR>
With glossy skin like polished gold.<BR>
And loudly to her husband cried<BR>
And bow-armed Lakshman by his side:<BR>
Again, again she called in glee:<BR>
'O come this glorious creature see;<BR>
Quick, quick, my lord, this deer to view.<BR>
And bring thy brother Lakshman too.'<BR>
As through the wood her clear tones rang,<BR>
Swift to her side the brothers sprang.<BR>
With eager eyes the grove they scanned,<BR>
And saw the deer before them stand.<BR>
But doubt was strong in Lakshman's breast,<BR>
Who thus his thought and fear expressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Stay, for the wondrous deer we see<BR>
The fiend M&aacute;r&iacute;cha's self may be.<BR>
Ere now have kings who sought this place<BR>
To take their pastime in the chase,<BR>
Met from his wicked art defeat,<BR>
And fallen slain by like deceit.<BR>
He wears, well trained in magio guile,<BR>
The figure of a deer a while,<BR>
Bright as the very sun, or place<BR>
Where dwell the gay Gaudharya race.<BR>
No deer, O R&aacute;ma, e'er was seen<BR>
Thus decked with gold und jewels' sheen.<BR>
'Tis magic, for the world has ne'er,<BR>
Lord of the world, shown aught so fair.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But S&iacute;t&aacute; of the lovely smile,<BR>
A captive to the giant's wile,<BR>
Turned Lakshman's prudent speech aside<BR>
And thus with eager words replied:<BR>
Mv honoured lord, this deer I see<BR>
With beauty rare enraptures me.<BR>
Go, chief of mighty arm, and bring<BR>
For my delight this precious thing.<BR>
Fair creatures ot the woodland roam<BR>
Untroubled near our hermit home.<BR>
The forest cow and stag are there,<BR>
The fawn, the monkey, and the bear,<BR>
Where spotted deer delight to play,<BR>

<P>
And strong and beauteous Kinnars &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> stray.<BR>
But never, as they wandered by,<BR>
Has such a beauty charmed mine eye<BR>
As this with limbs so fair and slight,<BR>
So gentle, beautiful and bright.<BR>
O see, how fair it is to view<BR>
With jewels of each varied hue:<BR>
Bright as the rising moon it glows,<BR>
Lighting the wood where'er it goes.<BR>
Ah me, what form and grace are there!<BR>
Its limbs how fine, its hues how fair!<BR>
Transcending all that words express,<BR>
It takes my soul with loveliness.<BR>
O, if thou would, to please me, strive<BR>
To take the beauteous thing alive,<BR>
How thou wouldst gaze with wondering eyes<BR>
Delighted on the lovely prize!<BR>
And when our woodland life is o'er,<BR>
And we enjoy our realm once more,<BR>
The wondrous animal will grace<BR>
The chambers of my dwelling-place,<BR>
And a dear treasure will it be<BR>
To Bharat and the queens and me,<BR>
And all with rapture and amaze<BR>
Upon its heavenly form will gaze.<BR>
But if the beauteous deer, pursued,<BR>
Thine arts to take it still elude,<BR>
Strike it, O chieftain, and the akin<BR>
Will be a treasure, laid within.<BR>
O, how I long my time to pass<BR>
Sitting upon the tender grass,<BR>
With that soft fell beneath me spread<BR>
Bright with its hair of golden thread!<BR>
This strong desire, this eager will,<BR>
Befits a gentle lady ill:<BR>
But when I first beheld, its look<BR>
My breast with fascination took.<BR>
See, golden hair its flank adorns,<BR>
And sapphires tip its branching horns.<BR>
Resplendent as the lunar way,<BR>
Or the first blush of opening day,<BR>
With graceful form and radiant hue<BR>
It charmed thy heart, O chieftain, too.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He heard her speech with willing ear,<BR>
He looked again upon the deer.<BR>
Its lovely shape his breast beguiled<BR>
Moved by the prayer of Janak's child,<BR>
And yielding for her pleasure's sake,<BR>
To Lakshman R&aacute;ma turned and spake:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Mark, Lakshman, mark how S&iacute;t&aacute;'s breast<BR>
With eager longing is possessed.<BR>
To-day this deer of wondrous breed<BR>
Must for his passing beauty bleed,<BR>
Brighter than e'er in Nandan strayed,<BR>
Or Chaitraratha's heavenly shade.<BR>

<P>

<P>
How should the groves of earth possess<BR>
Such all-surpassing loveliness!<BR>
The hair lies smooth and bright and fine,<BR>
Or waves upon each curving line,<BR>
And drops of living gold bedeck<BR>
The beauty of his side and neck.<BR>
O look, his crimson tongue between<BR>
His teeth like flaming fire is seen,<BR>
Flashing, whene'er his lips he parts,<BR>
As from a cloud the lightning darts.<BR>
O see his sunlike forehead shine<BR>
With emerald tints and almandine,<BR>
While pearly light and roseate glow<BR>
Of shells adorn his neck below.<BR>
No eye on such a deer can rest<BR>
But soft enchantment takes the breast:<BR>
No man so fair a thing behold<BR>
Ablaze with light of radiant gold.<BR>
Celestial, bright with jewels' sheen,<BR>
Nor marvel when his eyes have seen,<BR>
A king equipped with bow and shaft<BR>
Delights in gentle forest craft,<BR>
And as in boundless woods he strays<BR>
The quarry for the venison slays.<BR>
There as he wanders with his train<BR>
A store of wealth he oft may gain.<BR>
He claims by right the precious ore.<BR>
He claims the jewels' sparkling store.<BR>
Such gains are dearer in his eyes<BR>
Than wealth that in his chamber lies.<BR>
The dearest things his spirit knows,<BR>
Dear as the bliss which Sukra chose.<BR>
But oft the rich expected gain<BR>
Which heedless men pursue in vain.<BR>
The sage, who prudent counsels know,<BR>
Explain and in a moment show.<BR>
This best of deer, this gem of all,<BR>
To yield his precious spoils must fall,<BR>
And tender S&iacute;t&aacute; by my side<BR>
Shall sit upon the golden hide.<BR>
Ne'er could I find so rich a coat<BR>
On spotted deer or sheep or goat.<BR>
No buck or antelope has such,<BR>
So bright to view, so soft to touch.<BR>
This radiant deer and one on high<BR>
That moves in glory through the sky,<BR>
Alike in heavenly beauty are,<BR>
One on the earth and one a star.<BR>
But, brother, if thy fears be true,<BR>
And this bright creature that we view<BR>
Be fierce M&aacute;r&iacute;cha in disguise,<BR>
Then by this hand he surely dies.<BR>
For that dire fiend who spurns control<BR>
With bloody hand and cruel soul,<BR>
Has roamed this forest and dismayed<BR>
The holiest saints who haunt the shade.<BR>
Great archers, sprung of royal race.<BR>
Pursuing in the wood the chase,<BR>
Have fallen by his wicked art,<BR>
And now my shaft shall strike his heart.<BR>
Vat&aacute;pi, by his magic power<BR>

<A NAME="page_280"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 280</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Made heedless saints his flesh devour,<BR>
Then, from within their frames he rent<BR>
Forth bursting from imprisonment,<BR>
But once his art in senseless pride<BR>
Upon the mightiest saint he tried,<BR>
Agastya's self, and caused him taste<BR>
The baited meal before him placed.<BR>
V&aacute;t&aacute;pi, when the rite* was o'er,<BR>
Would take the giant form he wore,<BR>
But Saint Agastya knew his wile<BR>
And checked the giant with smile<BR>
'Vat&aacute;pi, thou with cruel spite<BR>
Hast conquered many an achorite<BR>
The noblest of the Brahman ask*--<BR>
And now thy ruin comes at last'<BR>
Now if my power he thus defies,<BR>
This giant, like Vat&aacute;pi dies,<BR>
Daring to scorn a man like me,<BR>
A self subduing devotee.<BR>
Yea, as Agastya slew the foe,<BR>
My hand shall lay Mancha low<BR>
Clad in thine arms thy bow in hand,<BR>
To guard the Maithil lady stand,<BR>
With watchful eye and thoughtful breast<BR>
Keeping each word of my behest<BR>
I go, and hunting through the brake<BR>
This wondrous deer will bring or take.<BR>
Yea surely I will bring the spoil<BR>
Returning from my hunter's toil<BR>
See, Lakshman how my contort's eyes<BR>
Are longing for the lovely prize<BR>
This day it falls, that I may win<BR>
The treasure of so fair a skin.<BR>
Do thou and S&iacute;t&aacute; watch with care<BR>
Lest danger seize you unaware.<BR>
Swift from my bow one shaft will fly;<BR>
The stricken deer will fall and die<BR>
Then quickly will I stop the game<BR>
And bring the trophy to my dame.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Jatavus, guardian good and wise,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Our old and faithful friend,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The best and strongest bird that flies,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His willing aid will lend<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Maithil lady well protect,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    For every chance provide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And in thy tender care suspect<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A foe on every side.<BR>
