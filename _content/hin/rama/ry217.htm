<P>
When Khara saw his sister lie<BR>
With blood-stained limbs and troubled eye,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Wild fury in his bosom woke,<BR>
And thus the monstrous giant spoke;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Arise, my sister; cast away<BR>
This numbing terror and dismay,<BR>
And straight the impious hand declare<BR>
That marred those features once so fair.<BR>
For who his finger tip will lay<BR>
On the black snake in childish play,<BR>
And unattacked, with idle stroke<BR>
His poison-laden fang provoke?<BR>
Ill-fated fool, he little knows<BR>
Death's noose around his neck he throws,<BR>
Who rashly met thee, and a draught<BR>
Of life-destroying poison quaffed.<BR>
Strong, fierce as death, 'twas thine to choose<BR>
Thy way at will, each shape to use;<BR>
In power and might like one of us:<BR>
What hand has maimed and marred thee thus?<BR>
What God or fiend this deed has wrought,<BR>
What bard or sage of lofty thought<BR>
Was armed with power supremely great<BR>
Thy form to mar and mutilate?<BR>
In all the worlds not one I see<BR>
Would dare a deed to anger me:<BR>
Not Indra's self, the Thousand-eyed,<BR>
Beneath whose hand fierce P&aacute;ka &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> died.<BR>
My life-destroying darts this day<BR>
His guilty breath shall rend away,<BR>
E'en as the thirsty wild swan drains<BR>
Each milk-drop that the wave retains.<BR>
Whose blood in foaming streams shall burst<BR>
O'er the dry ground which lies athirst,<BR>
When by my shafts transfixed and slain<BR>
He falls upon the battle plain?<BR>
From whose dead corpse shall birds of air<BR>
The mangled flesh and sinews tear,<BR>
And in their gory feast delight,<BR>
When I have slain him in the fight?<BR>
Not God or bard or wandering ghost,<BR>
No giant of our mighty host<BR>
Shall step between us, or avail<BR>
To save the wretch when I assail.<BR>
Collect each scattered sense, recall<BR>
Thy troubled thoughts, and tell me all.<BR>
What wretch attacked thee in the way,<BR>
And quelled thee in victorious fray?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His breast with burning fury fired,<BR>
Thus Khara of the fiend inquired:<BR>
And then with many a tear and sigh<BR>
Thus S'&uacute;rpanakh&aacute; made reply:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  ''Tis Das'aratha's sons, a pair<BR>
Strong, resolute, and young, and fair:<BR>
In coats of dark and blackdeer's hide,<BR>
And like the radiant lotus eyed:<BR>
On berries roots and fruit they feed,<BR>
And lives of saintly virtue lead:<BR>
With ordered senses undefiled,<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman are they styled.<BR>

<P>
Fair as the Minstrels' King &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="ry218.htm#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> are they,<BR>
And stamped with signs of regal sway.<BR>
I know not if the heroes trace<BR>
Their line from Gods or D&aacute;nav&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_461"></A><A HREF="ry218.htm#fn_461"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> race.<BR>
There by these wondering eyes between<BR>
The noble youths a dame was seen,<BR>
Fair, blooming, young, with dainty waist,<BR>
And all her bright apparel graced.<BR>
For her with ready heart and mind<BR>
The royal pair their strength combined,<BR>
And brought me to this last distress,<BR>
Like some lost woman, comfortless.<BR>
Perfidious wretch! my soul is fain<BR>
Her foaming blood and theirs to drain.<BR>
O let me head the vengeful fight,<BR>
And with this hand my murderers smite.<BR>
Come, brother, hasten to fulfil<BR>
This longing of my eager will.<BR>
On to the battle! Let me drink<BR>
Their lifeblood as to earth they sink.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Khara, by his sister pressed,<BR>
Inflamed with fury, gave his hest<BR>
To twice seven giants of his crew,<BR>
Fierce as the God of death to view:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Two men equipped with arms, who wear<BR>
Deerskin and bark and matted hair,<BR>
Leading a beauteous dame, have strayed<BR>
To the wild gloom of Dandak's shade.<BR>
These men, this cursed woman slay,<BR>
And hasten back without delay,<BR>
That this my sister's lips may be<BR>
Red with the lifeblood of the three.<BR>
Giants, my wounded sister longs<BR>
To take this vengeance for her wrongs.<BR>
With speed her dearest wish fulfil,<BR>
And with your might these creatures kill.<BR>
Soon as your matchless strength shall lay<BR>
These brothers dead in battle fray,<BR>
She in triumphant joy will laugh,<BR>
And their hearts' blood delighted quaff.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The giants heard the words he said,<BR>
And forth with S'&uacute;rpanakh&aacute; sped,<BR>
As mighty clouds in autumn fly<BR>
Urged by the wind along the sky.<BR>
