<P>
Then Kus'ik's son, by pity warmed,<BR>
Spoke sweetly to the king transformed:<BR>
'Hail! glory of Ikshv&aacute;ku's line:<BR>
I know how bright thy virtues shine.<BR>
Dismiss thy fear, O noblest Chief,<BR>
For I myself will bring relief.<BR>
The holiest saints will I invite<BR>
To celebrate thy purposed rite:<BR>
So shall thy vow, O King, succeed,<BR>
And from thy cares shalt thou be freed.<BR>
Thou in the form which now thou hast,<BR>
Transfigured by the curse they cast,--<BR>
Yea, in the body, King, shalt flee,<BR>
Transported, where thou fain wouldst be.<BR>
O Lord of men, I ween that thou<BR>
Hast heaven within thy hand e'en now,<BR>
For very wisely hast thou done,<BR>
And refuge sought with Kus'ik's son.'<BR>

<P>
Thus having said, the sage addressed<BR>
His sons, of men the holiest,<BR>
And bade the prudent saints whate'er<BR>
Was needed for the rite prepare.<BR>
The pupils he was wont to teach<BR>
He summoned next, and spoke this speech:<BR>
'Go bid Vas'ishtha'a sons appear,<BR>
And all the saints be gathered here.<BR>
And what they one and all reply<BR>
When summoned by this mandate high,<BR>
To me with faithful care report,<BR>
Omit no word and none distort.'<BR>

<P>
The pupils heard, and prompt obeyed,<BR>
To every side their way they made.<BR>
Then swift from every quarter sped<BR>
The sages in the Vedas read.<BR>
Back to that saint the envoys came,<BR>
Whose glory shone like burning flame,<BR>
And told him in their faithful speech<BR>
The answer that they bore from each:<BR>
'Submissive to thy word, O Seer,<BR>
The holy men are gathering here.<BR>
By all was meet obedience shown:<BR>
Mahodaya &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> refused alone.<BR>

<P>
And now, O Chief of hermits, hear<BR>
What answer, chilling us with fear,<BR>
Vas'ishtha's hundred sons returned,<BR>
Thick-speaking as with rage they burned:<BR>
'How will the Gods and saints partake<BR>
The offerings that the prince would make,<BR>
And he a vile and outcast thing,<BR>
His ministrant one born a king?<BR>
Can we, great Br&aacute;hmans, eat his food,<BR>
And think to win beatitude,<BR>
By Vis'v&aacute;mitra purified?'<BR>
Thus sire and sons in scorn replied,<BR>
And as these bitter words they said,<BR>
Wild fury made their eyeballs red.<BR>

<P>
Their answer when the arch-hermit heard,<BR>
His tranquil eyes with rage were blurred;<BR>
Great fury in his bosom woke,<BR>
And thus unto the youths he spoke:<BR>
'Me, blameless me they dare to blame,<BR>
And disallow the righteous claim<BR>
My fierce austerities have earned:<BR>
To ashes be the sinners turned.<BR>
Caught in the noose of Fate shall they<BR>
To Yama's kingdom sink to-day.<BR>
Seven hundred times shall they be born<BR>
To wear the clothes the dead have worn.<BR>
Dregs of the dregs, too vile to hate.<BR>
The flesh of dogs their maws shall sate.<BR>
In hideous form, in loathsome weed,<BR>
A sad existence each shall lead.<BR>
Mahodaya too, the fool who fain<BR>
My stainless life would try to stain,<BR>
Stained in the world with long disgrace<BR>
Shall sink into a fowler's place.<BR>
Rejoicing guiltless blood to spill,<BR>
No pity through his breast shall thrill.<BR>
Cursed by my wrath for many a day,<BR>
His wretched life for sin shall pay.'<BR>

<P>
Thus, girt with hermit, saint, and priest,<BR>
Great Vis'v&aacute;mitra spoke--and ceased.<BR>
