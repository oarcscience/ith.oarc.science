<P>
Then with the morn's returning sun.<BR>
King Janak, when his rites were done,<BR>
Skilled all the charms of speech to know,<BR>
Spoke to wise S'at&aacute;nanda so:<BR>
'My brother, lord of glorious fame,<BR>
My younger, Kus'adhwaj by name,<BR>
Whose virtuous life has won renown,<BR>
Has settled in a lovely town,<BR>
S&aacute;nk&aacute;sy&aacute;, decked with grace divine,<BR>
Whose glories bright as Pushpak's shine,<BR>
While Ikshumat&iacute; rolls her wave<BR>
Her lofty rampart's foot to lave.<BR>
Him, holy priest, I long to see:<BR>
The guardian of my rite is he:<BR>
That my dear brother may not miss<BR>
A share of mine expected bliss.'<BR>

<P>
Thus in the presence of the priest<BR>
The royal Janak spoke, and ceased.<BR>
Then came his henchmen, prompt and brave,<BR>

<P>
To whom his charge the monarch gave.<BR>
Soon as they heard his will, in haste<BR>
With fleetest steeds away they raced,<BR>
To lead with them that lord of kings,<BR>
As Indra's call Lord Vishnu brings.<BR>
S&aacute;nk&aacute;s'y&aacute;'s walls they duly gained,<BR>
And audience of the king obtained.<BR>
To him they told the news they brought<BR>
Of marvels past and Janak's thought.<BR>
Soon as the king the story knew<BR>
From those good envoys swift and true,<BR>
To Janak's wish he gave assent,<BR>
And swift to Mithil&aacute; he went.<BR>
He paid to Janak reverence due,<BR>
And holy S'at&aacute;nanda too,<BR>
Then sate him on a glorious seat<BR>
For kings or Gods celestial meet.<BR>
Soon as the brothers, noble pair<BR>
Peerless in might, were seated there,<BR>
They gave the wise Sud&aacute;man, best<BR>
Of councillors, their high behest:<BR>
'Go, noble councillor,' they cried,<BR>
'And hither to our presence guide<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's son, Ayodhy&aacute;'s lord,<BR>
Invincible by foeman's sword,<BR>
With both his sons, each holy seer,<BR>
And every minister and peer.'<BR>
Sud&aacute;man to the palace flew,<BR>
And saw the mighty king who threw<BR>
Splendour on Raghu's splendid race,<BR>
Then bowed his head with seemly grace:<BR>
'O King, whose hand Ayodhy&aacute; sways,<BR>
My lord, whom Mithil&aacute; obeys,<BR>
Yearns with desire, if thou agree,<BR>
Thee with thy guide and priest to see.'<BR>
Soon as the councillor had ceased,<BR>
The king, with saint and peer and priest,<BR>
Sought, speeding through the palace gate,<BR>
The hall where Janak held his state.<BR>
There, with his nobles round him spread,<BR>
Thus to Videha's lord be said:<BR>
'Thou knowest, King, whose aid divine<BR>
Protects Ikshv&aacute;ku's royal line.<BR>
In every need, whate'er befall,<BR>
The saint Vas'ishtha speaks for all.<BR>
If Vis'v&aacute;mitra so allow,<BR>
And all the saints around me now,<BR>
The sage will speak, at my desire,<BR>
As order and the truth require.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Soon as the king his lips had stilled.<BR>
Up rose Vas'ishtha, speaker skilled.<BR>
And to Videha's lord began<BR>
In flowing words that holy man:<BR>
'From viewless Nature Brahm&aacute; rose,<BR>
No change, no end, no waste he knows.<BR>
A son had he Mar&iacute;chi styled,<BR>
And Kas'yap was Mar&iacute;chi's child.<BR>
From him Vivasvat sprang: from him<BR>
Manu whose fame shall ne'er be dim.<BR>
Manu, who life to mortals gave,<BR>
Begot Ikshv&aacute;ku good and brave.<BR>
First of Ayodhy&aacute;'s kings was he,<BR>
Pride of her famous dynasty.<BR>
From him the glorious Kukshi sprang,<BR>
Whose fame through all the regions rang.<BR>
Rival of Kukshi's ancient fame,<BR>
His heir, the great Vikukshi, came,<BR>
His son was V&aacute;na, lord of might;<BR>
His Anaranya, strong to fight.<BR>
His son was Prithu, glorious name;<BR>
From him the good Tris'anku came.<BR>
He left a son renowned afar,<BR>
Known by the name of Dhundhum&aacute;r.<BR>
His son, who drove the mighty car,<BR>
Was Yuvan&aacute;s'va, feared in war.<BR>
He passed away. Him followed then<BR>
His son M&aacute;ndh&aacute;t&aacute;, king of men.<BR>
His son was blest in high emprise,<BR>
Susandhi, fortunate and wise.<BR>
Two noble sons had he, to wit<BR>
Dhruvasandhi and Prasenajit.<BR>
Bharat was Dhruvasandhi's son,<BR>
And glorious fame that monarch won.<BR>
The warrior Asit he begot.<BR>
Asit had warfare, fierce and hot,<BR>
With rival kings in many a spot,<BR>
Haihayas, T&aacute;lajanghas styled,<BR>
And S'as'ivindus, strong and wild.<BR>
Long time he strove, but forced to yield<BR>
Fled from his kingdom and the field.<BR>
With his two wives away he fled<BR>
Where high Him&aacute;laya lifts his head,<BR>
And, all his wealth and glory past,<BR>
He paid the dues of Fate at last.<BR>
The wives he left had both conceived--<BR>
So is the ancient tale believed--<BR>
One, of her rival's hopes afraid<BR>
Fell poison in her viands laid.<BR>
It chanced that Chyavan, Bhrigu's child,<BR>
Had wandered to that pathless wild,<BR>
And there Him&aacute;laya's lovely height<BR>
Detained him with a strange delight.<BR>
There came the other widowed queen,<BR>
With lotus eyes and beauteous mien,<BR>
Longing a noble son to bear,<BR>
And wooed the saint with earnest prayer.<BR>
When thus K&aacute;lindi, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> fairest dame,<BR>
With reverent supplication came,<BR>
To her the holy sage replied:<BR>
'Born with the poison from thy side,<BR>
O happy Queen, shall spring ere long<BR>
An infant fortunate and strong.<BR>
Then weep no more, and check thy sighs,<BR>
Sweet lady of the lotus eyes.'<BR>
The queen, who loved her perished lord,<BR>
For meet reply, the saint adored,<BR>
And, of her husband long bereaved,<BR>
She bore a son by him conceived.<BR>
Because her rival mixed the bane<BR>

<P>
To render her conception vain,<BR>
And fruit unripened to destroy,<BR>
Sagar &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="ry071.htm#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> she called her darling boy.<BR>
To Sagar Asamanj was heir:<BR>
Bright Ans'um&aacute;n his consort bare.<BR>
Ans'um&aacute;n's son, Dilipa famed,<BR>
Begot a son Bhag&iacute;rath named.<BR>
From him the great Kakutstha rose:<BR>
From him came Raghu, feared by foes,<BR>
Of him sprang Purush&aacute;dak bold,<BR>
Fierce hero of gigantic mould:<BR>
Kalm&aacute;shap&aacute;da's name he bore,<BR>
Because his feet were spotted o'er. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="ry071.htm#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
From him came S'ankan, and from him<BR>
Sudars'an, fair in face and limb.<BR>
From beautiful Sudars'an came<BR>
Prince Agnivarna, bright as flame.<BR>
His son was S'&iacute;ghraga, for speed<BR>
Unmatched; and Maru was his seed.<BR>
Pras'u&#156;s'ruka was Maru's child;<BR>
His son was Ambar&iacute;sha styled.<BR>
Nahush was Ambar&iacute;sha's heir,<BR>
The mighty lord of regions fair:<BR>
Nahush begot Yay&aacute;ti: he,<BR>
N&aacute;bh&aacute;g of happy destiny.<BR>
Son of N&aacute;bh&aacute;g was Aja: his,<BR>
The glorious Das'aratha is,<BR>
Whose noble children boast to be<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman, whom we see.<BR>
Thus do those kings of purest race<BR>
Their lineage from Ikshv&aacute;ku trace;<BR>
Their hero lives the right maintained,<BR>
Their lips with falsehood ne'er were stained.<BR>
In R&aacute;ma's and in Lakshman's name<BR>
Thy daughters as their wives I claim,<BR>
So shall in equal bands be tied<BR>
Each peerless youth with peerless bride.'<BR>
