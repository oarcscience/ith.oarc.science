<P>
He ceased: and Raghu's son gave heed,<BR>
Attentive to his prudent rede:<BR>
Then turned again, with hope inspired,<BR>
To Hanum&aacute;n, and thus inquired:<BR>

<P>
'Light were the task for thee, I ween,<BR>
To bridge the sea that gleams between<BR>
The mainland and the island shore.<BR>
Or dry the deep and guide as o'er.<BR>
Fain would I learn from thee whose feet<BR>
Have trod the stones of every street,<BR>
Of fenced Lank&aacute;'s towers and forts,<BR>
And walls and moats and guarded ports,<BR>
And castles where the giants dwell,<BR>
And battlemented citadel.<BR>
O V&aacute;yu's son, describe it all,<BR>
With palace, fort, and gate, and wall.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: and, skilled in arts that guide<BR>
The eloquent, the chief replied:<BR>

<P>
'Vast is the city, gay and strong,<BR>
Where elephants unnumbered throng,<BR>
And countless hosts of R&aacute;kshas breed<BR>
Stand ready by the car and steed,<BR>
Four massive gates, securely barred,<BR>
All entrance to the city guard,<BR>
With murderous engines fixt to throw<BR>
Bolt, arrow, rock to check the foe,<BR>

<P>
And many a mace with iron head<BR>
That strikes at once a hundred dead.<BR>
Her golden ramparts wide and high<BR>
With massy strength the foe defy,<BR>
Where inner walls their rich inlay<BR>
Of coral, turkis, pearl display.<BR>
Her circling moats are broad and deep,<BR>
Where ravening monsters dart and leap.<BR>
By four great piers each moat is spanned<BR>
Where lines of deadly engines stand.<BR>
In sleepless watch at every gate<BR>
Unnumbered hosts of giants wait,<BR>
And masters of each weapon, rear<BR>
The threatening pike and sword and spear.<BR>
My fury hurled those ramparts down,<BR>
Filled up the moats that gird the town,<BR>
The piers and portals overturned,<BR>
And stately Lank&aacute; spoiled and burned,<BR>
Howe'er we V&aacute;nars force our way<BR>
O'er the wide seat of Varun's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_909"></A><A HREF="ry403.htm#fn_909"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> sway,<BR>
Be sure that city of the foe<BR>
Is doomed to sudden overthrow,<BR>
Nay, why so vast an army lead?<BR>
Brave Angad, Dwivid good at need,<BR>
Fierce Mainda, Panas famed in fight,<BR>
And N&iacute;la's skill and Nala's might,<BR>
And J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n the strong and wise,<BR>
Will dare the easy enterprise.<BR>
Assailed by these shall Lank&aacute; fall<BR>
With gate and rampart, tower and wall.<BR>
Command the gathering, chief: and they<BR>
In happy hour will haste away.'<BR>
