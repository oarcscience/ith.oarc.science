<P>
He bore her on in rapid flight,<BR>
And not a friend appeared in sight.<BR>
But on a hill that o'er the wood<BR>
Raised its high top five monkeys stood.<BR>
From her fair neck her scarf she drew,<BR>
And down the glittering vesture flew.<BR>
With earring, necklet, chain, and gem,<BR>
Descending in the midst of them:<BR>
'For these,' she thought,'my path may show,<BR>
And tell my lord the way I go.'<BR>
Nor did the fiend, in wild alarm,<BR>
Mark when she drew from neck and arm<BR>
And foot the gems and gold, and sent<BR>
To earth each gleaming ornament.<BR>

<P>
The monkeys raised their tawny eyes<BR>
That closed not in their first surprise,<BR>
And saw the dark-eyed lady, here<BR>
She shrieked above them in the air.<BR>
High o'er their heads the giant passed<BR>
Holding the weeping lady fast.<BR>
O'er Pampa's flashing flood he sped<BR>
And on to Lanka's city fled.<BR>
He bore awny in senseless joy<BR>
The prize that should his life destroy,<BR>
Like the rash fool who hugs beneath<BR>
His robe a snake with venomed teeth,<BR>
Swift as an arrow from a bow,<BR>
Speeding o'er lands that lay below,<BR>
Sublime in air his course he took<BR>
O'er wood and rook and lake and brook.<BR>
He passed at length the sounding sea<BR>
Where monstrous creatures wander free,--<BR>
Seat of Lord Varun's ancient reign,<BR>
Controller of the eternal main.<BR>
The angry waves were raised and tossed<BR>
As R&aacute;van with the lady crossed,<BR>
And fish and snake in wild unrest<BR>
Showed flashing fin and gleaming crest.<BR>
Then from the blessed troops who dwell<BR>
In air celestial voices fell:<BR>
'O ten-necked King,' they cried, 'attend:<BR>
This guilty deed will bring thine end.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;van speeding like the storm,<BR>
Bearing his death in human form,<BR>
The struggling S&iacute;t&aacute;, lighted down<BR>
In royal Lanka's glorious town;<BR>
A city bright and rich, that showed<BR>
Well-ordered street and noble road;<BR>
Arranged with just division, fair<BR>
With multitudes in court and square.<BR>
Thus, all his journey done, he passed<BR>
Within his royal home at last.<BR>
There in a queenly bower he placed<BR>
The black-eyed dame with dainty waist:<BR>
Thus in her chamber Maya laid<BR>
The lovely Maya, demon maid.<BR>
Then R&aacute;van gave command to all<BR>
The dread she-fiends who filled the halls<BR>
'This captive lady watch and guard<BR>
From sight of man and woman barred.<BR>
But all the fair one asks beside<BR>
Be with unsparing hand supplied:<BR>
As though 'twere I that asked, withhold<BR>
No pearls or dress or gems or gold.<BR>
And she among you that shall dare<BR>
Of purpose or through want of care<BR>
One word to vex her soul to say,<BR>
'Throws her unvalued life away.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spake the monarch of their race<BR>
To those she-fiends who thronged the place,<BR>
And pondering on the course to take<BR>
Went from the chamber as he spake.<BR>
He saw eight giants, strong and dread,<BR>
On flesh of bleeding victims fed,<BR>
Proud in the boon which Brahma gave,<BR>

<P>
And trusting in its power to save.<BR>
He thus the mighty chiefs addressed<BR>
Of glorious power and strength possessed:<BR>
'Arm, warriors, with the spear and bow;<BR>
With all your speed from Lank&aacute; go,<BR>
For Janasth&aacute;n, our own no more,<BR>
Is now defiled with giants' gore;<BR>
The seat of Khara's royal state<BR>
Is left unto us desolate.<BR>
In your brave hearts and might confide,<BR>
And cast ignoble fear aside.<BR>
Go, in that desert region dwell<BR>
Where the fierce giants fought and fell.<BR>
A glorious host that region held,<BR>
For power and might unparalleled,<BR>
By D&uacute;shan and brave Khara led,-<BR>
All, slain by R&aacute;ma's arrows, bled.<BR>
Hence boundless wrath that spurns control<BR>
Reigns paramount within my soul,<BR>
And naught but R&aacute;ma's death can sate<BR>
The fury of my vengeful hate.<BR>
I will not close my slumbering eyes<BR>
Till by this hand my foeman dies.<BR>
And when mine arm has slain the foe<BR>
Who laid those giant princes low,<BR>
Long will I triumph in the deed,<BR>
Like one enriched in utmost need.<BR>
Now go; that I this end may gain,<BR>
In Janasth&aacute;n. O chiefs, remain.<BR>
Watch R&aacute;ma there with keenest eye,<BR>
And all his deeds and movements spy.<BR>
Go forth, no helping art neglect,<BR>
Be brave and prompt and circumspect,<BR>
And be your one endeavour still<BR>
To aid mine arm this foe to kill.<BR>
Oft have I seen your warrior might<BR>
Proved in the forehead of the fight,<BR>
And sure of strength I know so well<BR>
Send you in Janasth&aacute;n to dwell.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The giants heard with prompt assent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The pleasant words he said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And each before his master bent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    For meet salute, his head.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then as he bade, without delay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    From Lank&aacute;'s gate they passed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And hurried forward on their way<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Invisible and fast.<BR>
