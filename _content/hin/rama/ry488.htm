<P>
He saw her trembling by his side,<BR>
And looked upon her face and cried:<BR>
'Lady, at length my task is done,<BR>
And thou, the prize of war, art won,<BR>
This arm my glory has retrieved,<BR>
And all that man might do achieved;<BR>
The insulting foe in battle slain<BR>
And cleared mine honour from its stain.<BR>
This day has made my name renowned<BR>
And with success my labour crowned.<BR>
Lord of myself, the oath I swore<BR>
Is binding on my soul no more.<BR>
If from my home my queen was reft,<BR>
This arm has well avenged the theft,<BR>
And in the field has wiped away<BR>
The blot that on mine honour lay.<BR>
The bridge that spans the foaming flood,<BR>
The city red with giants' blood;<BR>
The hosts by King Sugr&iacute;va led<BR>
Who wisely counselled, fought and bled;<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan's love, our guide and stay--<BR>
All these are crowned with fruit to-day.<BR>
But, lady,'twas not love for thee<BR>
That led mine army o'er the sea.<BR>
'Twas not for thee our blood was shed,<BR>
Or Lank&aacute; filled with giant dead.<BR>
No fond affection for my wife<BR>
Inspired me in the hour of strife.<BR>
I battled to avenge the cause<BR>
Of honour and insulted laws.<BR>
My love is fled, for on thy fame<BR>
Lies the dark blot of sin and shame;<BR>
And thou art hateful as the light<BR>

That flashes on the injured sight.<BR>
The world is all before thee: flee:<BR>
Go where thou wilt, but not with me.<BR>
How should my home receive again<BR>
A mistress soiled with deathless stain?<BR>
How should I brook the foul disgrace,<BR>
Scorned by my friends and all my race?<BR>
For R&aacute;van bore thee through the sky,<BR>
And fixed on thine his evil eye.<BR>
About thy waist his arms he threw,<BR>
Close to his breast his captive drew,<BR>
And kept thee, vassal of his power,<BR>
An inmate of his ladies' bower.'<BR>
