<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XV.: THE PREPARATIONS.</H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  There slept the Br&aacute;hmans, deeply read<BR>
In Scripture, till the night had fled;<BR>
Then, with the royal chaplains, they<BR>
Took each his place in long array.<BR>
There gathered fast the chiefs of trade,<BR>
Nor peer nor captain long delayed,<BR>
Assembling all in order due<BR>
The consecrating rite to view.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The morning dawned with cloudless ray<BR>
On Pushya's high auspicious day,<BR>
And Cancer with benignant power<BR>
Looked down on R&aacute;ma's natal hour.<BR>
The twice-born chiefs, with zealous heed,<BR>
Made ready what the rite would need.<BR>
The well-wrought throne of holy wood<BR>
And goldon urns in order stood.<BR>
There was the royal chair whereon<BR>
A tiger's skin resplendent shone;<BR>
There water, brought for sprinkling thence<BR>
When, in their sacred confluence,<BR>
Blend. Jumn&aacute;'s waves with Gang&aacute;'s tide,<BR>
From many a holy flood beside,<BR>
From brook and fountain far and near,<BR>
From pool and river, sea and mere.<BR>
And there were honey, curd, and oil,<BR>
Parched rice and grass, the garden's spoil,<BR>
Fresh milk, eight girls in bright attire,<BR>
An elephant with eyes of tire;<BR>
And urns of gold and silver made,<BR>
With milky branches overlaid,<BR>
All brimming from each sacred flood,<BR>
And decked with many a lotus bud<BR>

<P>

<P>
And dancing-women fair and free,<BR>
Gay with their gems, were there to see,<BR>
Who stood in bright apparel by<BR>
With lovely brow and witching eye.<BR>
White flashed the jewelled chouri there,<BR>
And shone like moonbeams through the air;<BR>
The white umbrella overhead<BR>
A pale and moonlike lustre shed,<BR>
Wont in pure splendour to precede,<BR>
And in such rites the pomp to lead.<BR>
There stood the charger by the side<BR>
Of the great bull of snow-white hide;<BR>
There was all music soft and loud,<BR>
And bards and minstrels swelled the crowd.<BR>
For now the monarch bade combine<BR>
Each custom of his ancient line<BR>
With every rite Ayodhy&aacute;'s state<BR>
Observed, her kings to consecrate.<BR>

<P>
Then, summoned by the king's behest,<BR>
The multitudes together pressed,<BR>
And, missing still the royal sire,<BR>
Began, impatient, to inquire:<BR>
'Who to our lord will tidings bear<BR>
That all his people throng the square?<BR>
Where is the king? the sun is bright,<BR>
And all is ready for the rite.'<BR>

<P>
As thus they spoke, Sumantra, tried<BR>
In counsel, to the chiefs replied,<BR>
Gathered from lands on every side:<BR>
'To R&aacute;ma's house I swiftly drave,<BR>
For so the king his mandate gave.<BR>
Our aged lord and R&aacute;ma too<BR>
In honour high hold all of you:<BR>
I in your words (be long your days!)<BR>
Will ask him why he thus delays.'<BR>

<P>
Thus spoke the peer in Scripture read,<BR>
And to the ladies' bower he sped.<BR>
Quick through the gates Sumantra hied,<BR>
Which access ne'er to him denied.<BR>
Behind the curtained screen he drew,<BR>
Which veiled the chamber from the view.<BR>
In benediction loud he raised<BR>
His voice, and thus the monarch praised:<BR>
'Sun, Moon, Kuvera, S'iva bless<BR>
Kakutstha's son with high success!<BR>
The Lords of air, flood, fire decree<BR>
The victory, my King, to thee!<BR>
The holy night has past away,<BR>
Auspicious shines the morning's ray.<BR>
Rise, Lord of men, thy part to take<BR>
In the great rite. Awake! awake!<BR>
Br&aacute;hmans and captains, chiefs of trade,<BR>
All wait in festive garb arrayed;<BR>
For thee they look with eager eyes:<BR>
O Raghu's son, awake! arise.'<BR>

<P>
To him in holy Scripture read,<BR>
Who hailed him thus, the monarch said,<BR>
Upraising from his sleep his head:<BR>
'Go. R&aacute;ma hither lead as thou<BR>
W (<I>illegible</I>) but now.<BR>
Come, tell me why my mandate laid<BR>
Upon thee thus is disobeyed.<BR>
Away! and R&aacute;ma hither bring;<BR>
I sleep not: make no tarrying.'<BR>

<P>
Thus gave the king command anew:<BR>
Sumantra from his lord withdrew;<BR>
With head in lowly reverence bent,<BR>
And filled with thoughts of joy, he went,<BR>
The royal street he traversed, where<BR>
Waved flag and pennon to the air,<BR>
And, as with joy the car he drove,<BR>
He let his eyes delighted rove.<BR>
On every side, where'er he came,<BR>
He heard glad words, their theme the same,<BR>
As in their joy the gathered folk<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma and the throning spoke.<BR>
Then saw he R&aacute;ma's palace bright<BR>
And vast as Mount Kail&aacute;sa's height,<BR>
That glorious in its beauty showed<BR>
As Indra's own supreme abode:<BR>
With folding doors both high and wide;<BR>
With hundred porches beautified:<BR>
Where golden statues towering rose<BR>
O'er gemmed and coralled porticoes<BR>
Bright like a cave in Meru's side,<BR>
Or clouds through Autumn's sky that ride:<BR>
Festooned with length of bloomy twine,<BR>
Flashing with pearls and jewels' shine,<BR>
While sandal-wood and aloe lent<BR>
The mingled riches of their scent;<BR>
With all the odorous sweets that fill<BR>
The breezy heights of Dardar's hill.<BR>
There by the gate the S&aacute;ras screamed,<BR>
And shrill-toned peacocks' plumage gleamed.<BR>
Its floors with deftest art inlaid,<BR>
Its sculptured wolves in gold arrayed,<BR>
With its bright sheen the palace took<BR>
The mind of man and chained the look,<BR>
For like the sun and moon it glowed,<BR>
And mocked Kuvera's loved abode.<BR>
Circling the walls a crowd he viewed<BR>
Who stood in reverent attitude,<BR>
With throngs of countrymen who sought<BR>
Acceptance of the gifts they brought.<BR>
The elephant was stationed there,<BR>
Appointed R&aacute;ma's self to bear;<BR>
Adorned with pearls, his brow and cheek<BR>
Were sandal-dyed in many a streak,<BR>
While he, in stature, bulk, and pride,<BR>
With Indra's own Air&aacute;vat &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> vied.<BR>
Sumantra, borne by coursers fleet,<BR>
Flashing a radiance o'er the street,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To R&aacute;ma's palace flew,<BR>
And all who lined the royal road,<BR>
Or thronged the prince's rich abode,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rejoiced as near he drew.<BR>
And with delight his bosom swelled<BR>
As onward still his course he held<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Through many a sumptuous court<BR>
Like Indra's palace nobly made,<BR>
Where peacocks revelled in the shade,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And beasts of silvan sort.<BR>
Through many a hall and chamber wide,<BR>
That with Kail&aacute;sa's splendour vied.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Or mansions of the Blest,<BR>
While R&aacute;ma's friends, beloved and tried,<BR>
Before his coming stepped aside,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Still on Sumantra pressed.<BR>
He reached the chamber door, where stood<BR>
Around his followers young and good,<BR>
Bard, minstrel, charioteer,<BR>
Well skilled the tuneful chords to sweep,<BR>
With soothing strain to lull to sleep,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Or laud their master dear.<BR>
Then, like a dolphin darting through<BR>
Unfathomed depths of ocean's blue<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With store of jewels decked,<BR>
Through crowded halls that rock-like rose,<BR>
Or as proud hills where clouds repose,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sumantra sped unchecked--<BR>
Halls like the glittering domes on high<BR>
Reared for the dwellers of the sky<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By heavenly architect.<BR>
