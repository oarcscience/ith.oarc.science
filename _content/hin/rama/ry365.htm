<P>
Then round the helpless S&iacute;t&aacute; drew<BR>
With fiery eyes the hideous crew,<BR>
And thus assailed her, all and each,<BR>
With insult, taunt, and threatening speech:<BR>
'What! can it be thou prizest not<BR>
This happy chance, this glorious lot,<BR>
To be the chosen wife of one<BR>
So strong and great, Pulastya's son?<BR>
Pulastya--thus have sages told--<BR>
Is mid the Lords of Life &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_843"></A><A HREF="#fn_843"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> enrolled.<BR>
Lord Brahm&aacute;'s mind-born son was he,<BR>
Fourth of that glorious company.<BR>
Vis'ravas from Pulastya sprang,--<BR>
Through all the worlds his glory rang.<BR>
And of Vis'ravas, large-eyed dame!<BR>
Our king the mighty R&aacute;van came.<BR>
His happy consort thou mayst be:<BR>
Scorn not the words we say to thee'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  One awful demon, fiery-eyed,<BR>
Stood by the Maithil queen and cried:<BR>
'Come and be his, if thou art wise.<BR>
Who smote the sovereign of the skies,<BR>
And made the thirty Gods and three,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_844"></A><A HREF="#fn_844"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>
O'ercome in furious battle, flee.<BR>

<P>
Thy lover turns away with scorn<BR>
From wives whom grace and youth adorn.<BR>
Thou art his chosen consort, thou<BR>
Shall be his pride and darling now."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Another, Vikat&aacute; by name,<BR>
In words like these addressed the dame:<BR>
The king whose blows, in fury dealt,<BR>
The N&aacute;gas &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_845"></A><A HREF="#fn_845"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and Gandharvas &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_846"></A><A HREF="#fn_846"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> felt,<BR>
In battle's fiercest brunt subdued,<BR>
Has stood by thee and humbly wooed.<BR>
And wilt thou in thy folly miss<BR>
The glory of a love like this?<BR>
Scared by his eye the sun grows chill,<BR>
The wanderer wind is hushed and still.<BR>
The rains at his command descend,<BR>
And trees with new-blown blossoms bend.<BR>
His word the hosts of demons fear.<BR>
And wilt thou, dame, refuse to hear?<BR>
Be counselled; with his will comply,<BR>
Or, lady, thou shalt surely die.'<BR>

divinities mentioned in the Rig-veda. In <A NAME="page_409"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 409</FONT></A>
Ashtaka I. S&uacute;kta XXXIV. the Rishi
Hiranyast&uacute;pa invoking the As'vins says:
&Agrave; N&aacute;saty&aacute; tribhirek&aacute;dasair iha devebniry&aacute;tam:
"O N&aacute;satyas (As'vins) come hither
with the thrice eleven Gods," And in
S&uacute;kta XLV. the Rishi Praskanva addressing
his hymn to Agni (ignis, fire),
thus invokes him: "Lord of the red
steeds, propitiated by our prayers lead
hither the thirty-three Gods." This number
must certainly have been the actual
number in the early days of the Vedic
religion: although it appears probable
enough that the thirty-three Vedic divinities
could not then be found co-ordinated
in so systematic a way as they were arranged
more recently by the authors of
the Upanishads. In the later ages of
Bramanism the number went on increasing
without measure by successive mythical
and religious creations which peopled
the Indian Olympus with abstract beings
of every kind. But through lasting veneration
of the word of tha Veda the custom
regained of giving the name of "the
thirty-three Gods" to the immense phalanx
of the multiplied deities." GORRESIO.</P>

Gandharvas are the heavenly singers or
