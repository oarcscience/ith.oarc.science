<P>
Low in the dust he saw her lie,<BR>
And Khara's wrath grew fierce and high,<BR>
Aloud he cried to her who came<BR>
Disgracefully with baffled aim:<BR>
'I sent with thee at thy request<BR>
The bravest of my giants, best<BR>
Of all who feed upon the slain:<BR>
Why art thou weeping here again?<BR>
Still to their master's interest true,<BR>
My faithful, noble, loyal crew.<BR>
Though slaughtered in the bloody fray.<BR>
Would yet their monarch's word obey.<BR>
Now I, my sister, fain would know<BR>
The cause of this thy fear and woe,<BR>
Why like a snake thou writhest there,<BR>
Calling for aid in wild despair.<BR>
Nay, lie not thus in lowly guise:<BR>
Cast off thy weakness and arise!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With soothing words the giant chief<BR>
Assuaged the fury of her grief.<BR>
Her weeping eyes she slowly dried<BR>
And to her brother thus replied:<BR>
'I sought thee in my shame and fear<BR>
With severed nose and mangled ear:<BR>
My gashes like a river bled,<BR>
I sought thee and was comforted.<BR>

<P>
Those twice seven giants, brave and strong,<BR>
Thou sentest to avenge the wrong,<BR>
To lay the savage R&aacute;ma low,<BR>
And Lakshman who misused me so.<BR>
But ah, the shafts of R&aacute;ma through<BR>
The bodies of my champions flew:<BR>
Though madly fierce their spears they plied,<BR>
Beneath his conquering might they died.<BR>
I saw them, famed for strength and speed,<BR>
I saw my heroes fall and bleed:<BR>
Great trembling seized my every limb<BR>
At the great deed achieved by him.<BR>
In trouble, horror, doubt, and dread,<BR>
Again to thee for help I fled.<BR>
While terror haunts my troubled sight,<BR>
I seek thee, rover of the night.<BR>
And canst thou not thy sister free<BR>
From this wide waste of troublous sea<BR>
Whose sharks are doubt and terror, where<BR>
Each wreathing wave is dark despair?<BR>
Low lie on earth thy giant train<BR>
By ruthless R&aacute;ma's arrows slain,<BR>
And all the mighty demons, fed<BR>
On blood, who followed me are dead.<BR>
Now if within thy breast may be<BR>
Pity for them and love for me,<BR>
If thou, O rover of the night,<BR>
Have valour and with him can fight,<BR>
Subdue the giants' cruel foe<BR>
Who dwells where Dandak's thickets grow.<BR>
But if thine arm in vain assay<BR>
This queller of his foes to slay,<BR>
Now surely here before thine eyes,<BR>
Wronged and ashamed thy sister dies.<BR>
Too well, alas, too well I see<BR>
That, strong in war as thou mayst be,<BR>
Thou canst not in the battle stand<BR>
When R&aacute;ma meets thee hand to hand.<BR>
Go forth, thou hero but in name,<BR>
Assuming might thou canst not claim;<BR>
Call friend and kin, no longer stay:<BR>
Away from Janasth&aacute;n, away!<BR>
Shame of thy race! the weak alone<BR>
Beneath thine arm may sink o'erthrown:<BR>
Fly R&aacute;ma and his brother: they<BR>
Are men too strong for thee to slay.<BR>
How canst thou hope, O weak and base,<BR>
To make this grove thy dwelling-place?<BR>
With R&aacute;ma's might unmeet to vie,<BR>
O'ermastered thou wilt quickly die.<BR>
A hero strong in valorous deed<BR>
Is R&aacute;ma, Das'aratha's seed:<BR>
And scarce of weaker might than he<BR>
His brother chief who mangled me.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus wept and wailed in deep distress<BR>
The grim misshapen giantess:<BR>
Before her brother's feet she lay<BR>
O'erwhelmed with grief, and swooned away.<BR>
