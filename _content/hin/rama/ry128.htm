<P>
So through the wide and fair extent<BR>
Of Kosala the hero went.<BR>
Then toward Ayodm&aacute; back he gazed,<BR>
And cried, with supple hands upraised:<BR>

<P>
'Farewell, dear city, in this place,<BR>
Protected by Kakutatlm's  race &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_322"></A><A HREF="#fn_322"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
And Gods, who in thy temples dwell,<BR>
And keep thine ancient citadel!<BR>
I from his debt my sire will free,<BR>
Thy well-loved towers again will see,<BR>

<P>
And, coming from my wild retreat,<BR>
My mother and my father meet.'<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Then burning grief inflamed his eye,<BR>
As his right arm he raised on high,<BR>
And, while hot tears his check bedewed,<BR>
Addressed the mournful multitude:<BR>
'By love and tender pity moved,<BR>
Your love for me you well have proved;<BR>
Now turn again with joy, and win<BR>
Success in all your hands begin'<BR>

<P>
Before the high souled chief they bent,<BR>
With circling steps around him went,<BR>
And then with bitter wailing, they<BR>
Departed each his several way.<BR>
Like the great sun engulfed by night,<BR>
The hero sped beyond their sight,<BR>
While still the people mourned his fate<BR>
And wept aloud disconsolate.<BR>

<P>
The car-borne chieftain passed the bound<BR>
Of Kos'ala's delightful ground.<BR>
Where grain and riches bless the land,<BR>
And people give with liberal hand:<BR>
A lovely realm unvexed by fear,<BR>
Where countless shrines and stakes &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> appear:<BR>
Where mango-groves and gardens grow,<BR>
And streams of pleasant water flow:<BR>
Where dwells content a well-fed race,<BR>
And countless kine the meadows grace:<BR>
Filled with the voice of praise and prayer:<BR>
Each hamlet worth a monarch's care.<BR>
Before him three-pathed Gang&aacute; rolled<BR>
Her heavenly waters bright and cold;<BR>
O'er her pure breast no weeds were spread,<BR>
Her banks were hermit-visited.<BR>
The car-borne hero saw the tide<BR>
That ran with eddies multiplied,<BR>
And thus the charioteer addressed:<BR>
'Here on the bank to-day we rest.<BR>
Not distant from the river, see!<BR>
There grows a lofty Ingud&iacute;<BR>
With blossoms thick on every spray:<BR>
There rest we, charioteer, to-day.<BR>
I on the queen of floods will gaze,<BR>
Whose holy stream has highest praise,<BR>
Where deer, and bird, and glittering snake,<BR>
God, Daitya, bard their pastime take."<BR>

<P>
Sumantra, Lakshman gave assent,<BR>
And with the steeds they thither went.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma reached the lovely tree,<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; and with Lakshman, he<BR>
Alighted from the car: with speed<BR>
Sumantra loosed each weary steed,<BR>
And hand to hand in reverence laid,<BR>
Stood near to R&aacute;ma in the shade.<BR>
R&aacute;ma's dear friend, renowned by fame,<BR>
Who of Nish&aacute;da lineage came,<BR>
Guha, the mighty chief, adored<BR>
Through all the land as sovereign lord,<BR>
Soon as he heard that prince renowned<BR>


<P>


<P>
Was resting on Nish&aacute;da ground,<BR>
Begirt by counsellor and peer<BR>
And many an honoured friend drew near.<BR>
Soon as the monarch came in view,<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman toward him flew.<BR>
Then Guha, at the sight distressed,<BR>
His arms around the hero pressed,<BR>
Laid both his hands upon his head<BR>
Bowed to those lotus feet, and said:<BR>
'O R&aacute;ma, make thy wishes known,<BR>
And be this kingdom as thine own.<BR>
Who, mighty-armed, will ever see<BR>
A guest so dear as thou to me?'<BR>

<P>
He placed before him dainty fare<BR>
Of every flavour, rich and rare,<BR>
Brought forth the gift for honoured guest,<BR>
And thus again the chief addressed<BR>
'Welcome, dear Prince, whose arms are strong;<BR>
These lands and all to thee belong.<BR>
Thy servants we, our lord art thou;<BR>
Begin, good king, thine empire now.<BR>
See, various food before thee placed,<BR>
And cups to drink and sweets to taste<BR>
For thee soft beds are hither borne,<BR>
And for thy horses grass and corn.'<BR>

<P>
To Guha as he pressed and prayed,<BR>
Thus Raghu's son his answer made:<BR>
''Twas aye thy care my heart to please<BR>
With honour, love, and courtesies,<BR>
And friendship brings thee now to greet<BR>
Thy guest thus humbly on thy feet.'<BR>

<P>
Again the hero spake, as round<BR>
The king his shapely arms he wound:<BR>
'Guha, I see that all is well<BR>
With thee and those who with thee dwell;<BR>
That health and bliss and wealth attend<BR>
Thy realm, thyself, and every friend.<BR>
But all these friendly gifts of thine,<BR>
Bound to refuse, I must decline.<BR>
Grass, bark, and hide my only wear,<BR>
And woodland roots and fruit my fare,<BR>
On duty all my heart is set;<BR>
I seek the woods, an anchoret.<BR>
A little grass and corn to feed<BR>
The horses--this is all I need.<BR>
So by this favour, King, alone<BR>
Shall honour due to me be shown.<BR>
For these good steeds who brought me here<BR>
Are to my sire supremely dear;<BR>
And kind attention paid to these<BR>
Will honour me and highly please,'<BR>
Then Guha quickly bade his train<BR>
Give water to the steeds, and grain,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, ere the night grew dark,<BR>
Paid evening rites in dress of bark,<BR>
And tasted water, on the strand,<BR>
Drawn from the stream by Lakshman's hand.<BR>
And Lakshman with observance meet<BR>
Bathed his beloved brother's feet,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Who rested with his Maithil spouse:<BR>
Then sat him down 'neath distant boughs.<BR>
And Guha with his bow sat near<BR>
To Lakshman and the charioteer,<BR>
And with the prince conversing kept<BR>
His faithful watch while Rama slept.<BR>
As Das'aratha's glorious heir,<BR>
Of lofty soul and wisdom rare,<BR>
Reclining with his S&iacute;t&aacute; there<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Beside the river lay--<BR>
He who no troubles e'er had seen,<BR>
Whose life a life of bliss had been--<BR>
That night beneath the branches green<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Passed pleasantly away.<BR>
