<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLIII.: THE SINGLE COMBATS.</H3>
<P>
Brave chiefs of each opposing side<BR>
Their strength in single combat tried.<BR>
Fierce Indrajit the fight began<BR>
With Angad in the battle's van.<BR>
Samp&aacute;t&iacute;, strongest of his race,<BR>
Stood with Prajangha face to face.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n, Jambum&aacute;l&iacute; met<BR>
In mortal opposition set.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan, brother of the lord<BR>
Of Lank&aacute;, raised his threatening sword<BR>
And singled out, with eyes aglow<BR>
With wrath, S'atrughna for his foe.<BR>
The mighty Gaja Tapan sought,<BR>
And N&iacute;la with Nikumbha fought.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, V&aacute;nar king, defied<BR>
Fierce Praghas long in battle tried,<BR>
And Lakshman fearless in the fight<BR>
Encountered Vir&uacute;p&aacute;ksha's might.<BR>
To meet the royal R&aacute;ma came<BR>
Wild Agniketu fierce as flame;<BR>
Mitraghana, he who loved to strike<BR>
His foeman and his friend alike:<BR>
With Ras'miketu, known and feared<BR>
Where'er his ponderous flag was reared;<BR>
And Yajnakopa whose delight<BR>
Was ruin of the sacred rite.<BR>
These met and fought, with thousands more,<BR>
And trampled earth was red with gore<BR>
Swift as the bolt which Indra sends<BR>
When fire from heaven the mountain rends<BR>
Smote Indrajit with furious blows<BR>
On Angad queller of his foes.<BR>
But Angad from his foeman tore<BR>
The murderous mace the warrior bore,<BR>

And low in dust his coursers rolled,<BR>
His driver, and his car of gold.<BR>
Struck by the shafts Prajangha sped,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chief Samp&aacute;ti bled,<BR>
But, heedless of his gashes he<BR>
Crushed down the giant with a tree.<BR>
Then car-borne Jambum&aacute;li smote<BR>
Hanum&aacute;n on the chest and throat;<BR>
But at the car the V&aacute;nar rushed,<BR>
And chariot, steeds, and rider crushed.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va whirled a huge tree round,<BR>
And struck fierce Praghas to the ground.<BR>
One arrow shot from Lakshman's bow<BR>
Laid mighty Vir&uacute;p&aacute;ksha low.<BR>
His giant foes round R&aacute;ma pressed<BR>
And shot their shafts at head and breast;<BR>
But, when the iron shower was spent,<BR>
Four arrows from his bow he sent,<BR>
And every missile, deftly sped;<BR>
Cleft from the trunk a giant head. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_961"></A><A HREF="ry443.htm#fn_961"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
