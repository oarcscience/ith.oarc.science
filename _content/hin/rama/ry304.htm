<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXX.: R&Aacute;MA'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
But R&aacute;ma in the autumn night<BR>
Stood musing on the mountain height.<BR>
While grief and love that scorned control<BR>
Shook with wild storms the hero's soul.<BR>
Clear was the sky, without a cloud<BR>
The glory of the moon to shroud.<BR>
And bright with purest silver shone<BR>
Each hill the soft beams looked upon,<BR>
He knew Sugriva's heart was bent<BR>
On pleasure, gay and negligent.<BR>
He thought on Janak's child forlorn<BR>
From his fond arms for ever torn.<BR>
He mourned occasion slipping by,<BR>
And faint with anguish heaved each sigh<BR>

He sat where many a varied streak<BR>
Of rich ore marked the mountain peak.<BR>
He raised his eyes the skv to view.<BR>
And to his love his sad thoughts flew.<BR>
He. heard the S&aacute;ras cry, and faint<BR>
With sorrow poured his love-born plaint:<BR>
She, she who mocked the softest tone<BR>
Of wild birds' voices with her own,--<BR>
Where strays she now, my love who played<BR>
So happy in our hermit shade '<BR>
How can my absent love behold<BR>
The bright trees with their flowers of gold,<BR>
And a11 their gleaming glory see<BR>
With eyes that vainly look for me?<BR>
How is it with my darling when<BR>
From the deep tangles of the glen<BR>
Float carols of each bird elate<BR>
With rapture singing to his mate?<BR>
In vain my weary glances rove<BR>
From lake to hill, from stream to grove:<BR>
I find no rapture in the scene,<BR>
And languish fur my fawn-eyed queen.<BR>
Ah, does strong love with wild unrest,<BR>
Born no the autumn, stir her breast?<BR>
And does the gentle lady pine<BR>
Till her bright eyes shall look in mine?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Raghu's son in piteous tone,<BR>
O'erwhelmed with sorrow, made his moan.<BR>
E'en as the bird that drinks the rains &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_633"></A><A HREF="#fn_633"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
To Indra thousand-eyed complains.<BR>
Then Lakshman who had wandered through<BR>
The copses where the berries grew,<BR>
Returning to the cavern found<BR>
His brother chief* in sorrow drowned,<BR>
And pitying the woes that broke<BR>
The spirit, of the hero spoke:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Why east thy strength of soul away,<BR>
And weakly yield to passion's sway?<BR>
Arise, my brother, do and dare<BR>
Ere action perish in despair.<BR>
Refill the firmness of thy heart,<BR>
And nerve thee for a hero's part.<BR>
Whose is the hand unscathed to sieze<BR>
The red flame quickened by the breeze?<BR>
Where is the foe will dare to wrong<BR>
Or keep the Maithil lady long?'<BR>
Then with pale lips that sorrow dried<BR>
The son of Raghu thus replied:<BR>
Lord Indra thousand-eyed, has sent<BR>
The sweet rain from the firmament,<BR>
Sees the rich promise of the grain,<BR>
And turns him to his rest again.<BR>
The clouds with voices loud and deep,<BR>
Veiling each tree upon the steep,<BR>
Up on the thirsty earth have shed<BR>
Their precious burden and are fled.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Now in kings' hearts ambition glows:<BR>
They rush to battle with their foes;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_634"></A><A HREF="#fn_634"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
But in Sugr&iacute;va's sloth I see<BR>
No care for deeds of chivalry.<BR>
See, Lakshman, on each breezy height<BR>
A thousand autumn blooms are bright.<BR>
See how the wings of wild swans gleam<BR>
On every islet of the stream.<BR>
Four months of flood and rain are past:<BR>
A hundred years they seemed to last<BR>
To me whom toil and trouble tried,<BR>
My Sit&aacute; severed from my side.<BR>
She, gentlest woman, weak and young,<BR>
Still to her lord unwearied clung.<BR>
Still by the exile's side she stood<BR>
In the wild ways of Dandak wood,<BR>
Like a fond bird disconsolate<BR>
If parted from her darling mate.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, lapped in soft repose.<BR>
Untouched by pity for my woes,<BR>
Scorns the poor exile, dispossessed,<BR>
By R&aacute;van's mightier arm oppressed,<BR>
The wretch who comes to sue and pray<BR>
From his lost kingdom far away.<BR>
Hence falls on me the V&aacute;nar's scorn,<BR>
A suitor friendless and forlorn.<BR>
The time is come: with heedless eye<BR>
He sees the hour of action fly,--<BR>
Unmindful, now his hopes succeed,<BR>
Of promise made in stress of need.<BR>
Go seek him sunk in bliss and sloth,<BR>
Forgetful of his royal oath,<BR>
And as mine envoy thus upbraid<BR>
The monarch for his help delayed:<BR>
'Vile is the wretch who will not pay<BR>
The favour of an earlier day,<BR>
Hope in the supplicant's breast awakes,<BR>
And then his plighted promise breaks.<BR>
Noblest, mid all of women born,<BR>
Who keeps the words his lips have sworn.<BR>
Yea, if those words be good or ill.<BR>
Maintains his faith unbroken still.<BR>
The *ss who forget to aid<BR>
The friend who helped them when they prayed,<BR>
Dishonoured in their death shall lie,<BR>
And dogs shall pass their corpses by.<BR>
Sure thou wouldst see my strained arm hold<BR>
My bow of battle backed with gold,<BR>
Wouldst gaze upon its awful from<BR>
Like lightning flashing through the storm,<BR>
And hear the clanging bowstring loud<BR>
As thunder from a labouring cloud<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His valour and his strength I know:<BR>
But pleasure's sway now sinks them low<BR>
With thee, my brother, for ally<BR>
That strength and valour I defy<BR>

He promised, when the rains should end,<BR>
The succour of his arm to lend.<BR>
Those months are past: he dares forget.<BR>
And, lapped in pleasure, slumbers yet.<BR>
No thought disturbs his careless breast<BR>
For us impatient and distressed.<BR>
And, while we sadly wait and pine,<BR>
Girt by his lords he quaffs the wine.<BR>
Go, brother, go, his palace seek,<BR>
And boldly to Sugr&iacute;va speak.<BR>
Thus give the listless king to know<BR>
What waits him if my anger glow:<BR>
Still open, to the gloomy God,<BR>
Lies the sad path that B&aacute;li trod.<BR>
'Still to thy plighted word be true,<BR>
Lest thou, O King, that path pursue.<BR>
I launched the shaft I pointed well.<BR>
And B&aacute;li, only B&aacute;li, fell.<BR>
But, if from truth thou dare to stray,<BR>
Both thee and thine this hand shall slay.'<BR>
Thus be the V&aacute;nar king addressed,<BR>
Then add thyself what seems the best.<BR>
