<P>
The giant lord the chariot viewed,<BR>
And humbly thus his speech renewed:<BR>
'Behold, O King, the car prepared:<BR>
Now be thy further will declared.'<BR>
He ceased: and R&aacute;ma spake once more:<BR>
'These hosts who thronged to Lank&aacute;'s shore<BR>
Their faith and might have nobly shown,<BR>
And set thee on the giants' throne.<BR>
Let pearls and gems and gold repay<BR>
The feats of many a desperate day,<BR>
That all may go triumphant hence<BR>
Proud of their noble recompense.'<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan, ready at his call,<BR>
With gold and gems enriched them all.<BR>
Ihen R&aacute;ma clomb the glorious car<BR>
That shone like day's resplendent star.<BR>
There in his lap he held his dame<BR>
Vailing her eyes in modest shame.<BR>
Beside him Lakshman took his stand,<BR>
Whose mighty bow still armed his hand,<BR>
'O King Vibh&iacute;shan,' R&aacute;ma cried,<BR>
'O V&aacute;nar chiefs, so long allied,<BR>

<P>
My comrades till the foemen fell,<BR>
List, for I speak a long farewell.<BR>
The task, in doubt and fear begun,<BR>
With your good aid is nobly done.<BR>
Leave Lank&aacute;'s shore, your steps retrace,<BR>
Brave warriors of the V&aacute;nar race<BR>
Thou, King Sugr&iacute;va, true, through all,<BR>
To friendship's bond and duty's call,<BR>
Seek far Kishkindha with thy train<BR>
And o'er thy realm in glory reign.<BR>
Farewell, Vibh&iacute;shan, Lank&aacute;'s throne<BR>
Won by our arms is now thine own,<BR>
Thou, mighty lord, hast nought to dread<BR>
From heavenly Gods by Indra led.<BR>
My last farewell, O King, receive,<BR>
For Lank&aacute;'s isle this hour I leave.'<BR>

<P>
Loud rose their cry in answer: 'We,<BR>
O Raghu's son, would go with thee.<BR>
With thee delighted would we stray<BR>
Where sweet Ayodhy&aacute;'s groves are gay,<BR>
Then in the joyous synod view<BR>
King-making balm thy brows bedew;<BR>
Our homage to Kaus'aly&aacute; pay,<BR>
And hasten on our homeward way.'<BR>

<P>
Their prayer the son of Raghu heard,<BR>
And spoke, his heart with rapture stirred:<BR>
'Sugr&iacute;va, O my faithful friend,<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan and ye chiefs, ascend.<BR>
A joy beyond all joys the best<BR>
Will fill my overflowing breast,<BR>
If girt by you, O noble band,<BR>
I seek again my native land.'<BR>
With V&aacute;nar lords in danger tried<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va sprang to R&aacute;ma's side,<BR>
And girt by chiefs of giant kind<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan's step was close behind.<BR>
Swift through the air, as R&aacute;ma chose,<BR>
The wondrous car from earth arose.<BR>
And decked with swans and silver wings<BR>
Bore through the clouds its freight of kings.<BR>
