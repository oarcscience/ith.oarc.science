<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXVI.: LAKSHMAN'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
He stood incensed with eyes of flame,<BR>
Still mourning for his ravished dame,<BR>
Determined, like the fire of Fate,<BR>
To leave the wide world desolate.<BR>
His ready bow the hero eyed,<BR>
And as again, again he sighed,<BR>
The triple world would fain consume<BR>
Like Hara &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in the day of doom.<BR>
Then Lakshman moved with sorrow viewed<BR>
His brother in unwonted mood,<BR>
And reverent palm to palm applied,<BR>
Thus spoke with lips which terror dried<BR>
'Thy heart was ever soft and kind,<BR>
To every creature's good inclined.<BR>
Cast not thy tender mood away,<BR>
Nor yield to anger's mastering sway.<BR>
The moon for gentle grace is known,<BR>
The sun has splendour all his own,<BR>
The restless wind is free and fast,<BR>
And earth in patience unsurpassed.<BR>
So glory with her noble fruit<BR>
Is thine eternal attribute.<BR>
O, let not, for the sin of one,<BR>
The triple world be all undone.<BR>
I know not whose this car that lies<BR>
In fragments here before our eyes,<BR>
Nor who the chiefs who met and fought,<BR>
Nor what the prize the foemen sought;<BR>
Who marked the ground with hoof and wheel,<BR>

<P>
Or whose the hand that plied the steel<BR>
Which left this spot, the battle o'er,<BR>
Thus sadly dyed with drops of gore.<BR>
Searching with utmost care I view<BR>
The signs of one and not of two.<BR>
Where'er I turn mine eyes I trace<BR>
No mighty host about the place.<BR>
Then mete not out for one offence<BR>
This all-involving recompense,<BR>
For kings should use the sword they bear,<BR>
Put mild in time should learn to spare,<BR>
Thou, ever moved by misery's call,<BR>
Waft the great hope and stay of all<BR>
Throughout the world who would not blame<BR>
This outrage on thy ravished dame?<BR>
Gandharvas, D&aacute;navs, Gods, the trees,<BR>
The rocks, the rivers, and the seas,<BR>
Can ne'er in aught thy soul offend,<BR>
As one whom holiest rites befriend.<BR>
But him who dared to steal the dame<BR>
Pursue, O King, with ceaseless aim,<BR>
With me, the hermits' holy band,<BR>
And thy great bow to arm thy hand<BR>
By every mighty flood we'll seeks,<BR>
Each wood, each hill from base to peak.<BR>
To the fair homes of Gods we'll fly,<BR>
And bright Gandharvas in the sky,<BR>
Until we reach, where'er he be,<BR>
The wretch who stole thy spouse from thee,<BR>
Then if the Gods will not restore<BR>
Thy S&iacute;t&aacute; when the search is o'er,<BR>
Then, royal lord of Kos'al's land,<BR>
No longer hold thy vengeful hand.<BR>
If meekness, prayer, and right be weak<BR>
To bring thee back the dame we seek,<BR>
Up, brother, with a deadly shower<BR>
Of gold-bright shafts thy foes o'erpower,<BR>
Fierce as the flashing levin sent<BR>
From King Mahendra's firmament.<BR>
