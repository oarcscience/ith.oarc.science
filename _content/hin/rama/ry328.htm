<P>
But Hanum&aacute;n, while T&aacute;ra, best<BR>
Of splendid chiefs his thought expressed,<BR>
Perceived that B&aacute;li's princely son<BR>
A kingdom for himself had won. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_759"></A><A HREF="#fn_759"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
His keen eye marked in him combined<BR>
The warrior's arm, the ruler's mind,<BR>
And every noble gift should grace<BR>
The happy sovereign of his race:<BR>
Marked how he grew with ripening age<BR>
More glorious and bold and sage,--<BR>
Like the young moon that night by night<BR>
Shines on with ever waxing light,--<BR>
Brave as his royal father, wise<BR>
As he who counsels in the skies: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_760"></A><A HREF="#fn_760"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Marked how, forwearied with the quest,<BR>
He heeded not his liege's hest,<BR>
But T&aacute;ra's every word obeyed<BR>
Like Indra still by Sukra &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_761"></A><A HREF="#fn_761"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> swayed.<BR>
Then with his prudent speech he tried<BR>
To better thoughts the prince to guide,<BR>
And by division's skilful art<BR>
The V&aacute;nars and the youth to part:<BR>
'Illustrious Angad, thou in fight<BR>
Hast far surpassed thy father's might,<BR>
Most worthy, like thy sire of old,<BR>
The empire of our race to hold.<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' fickle people range<BR>
From wish to wish and welcome change.<BR>
Their wives and babes they will not leave<BR>
And to their new-made sovereign cleave.<BR>
No art, no gifts will draw away<BR>
The V&aacute;nars from Sugr&iacute;va's sway,<BR>
Through hope of wealth, through fear of pain<BR>
Still faithful will they all remain.<BR>
Thou fondly hopest in this cave<BR>
The vengeance of the foe to brave.<BR>
But Lakshman's arm a shower will send<BR>
Of deadly shafts those walls to rend.<BR>
Like Indra's bolts his shafts have power<BR>
To cleave the mountain like a flower.<BR>
O Angad, mark my counsel well:<BR>
If in this cave thou choose to dwell,<BR>

through the love of the V&aacute;nars, the reversion
of Sugr&iacute;va's kingdom; or, as
another commentator explains it, perceived
that Angad had obtained a new kingdom
in the enchanted cave which the
V&aacute;nars, through love of him, would consent
to occupy.</P>
