<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LV.: S&Iacute;T&Aacute; IN PRISON.</H3>
<P>
Thus R&aacute;van his commandment gave<BR>
To those eight giants strong and brave,<BR>
So thinking in his foolish pride<BR>
Against all dangers to provide.<BR>
Then with his wounded heart aflame<BR>
With love he thought upon the dame,<BR>
And took with hasty steps the way<BR>

<P>
To the fair chamber where she lay,<BR>
He saw the gentle lady there<BR>
Weighed down by woe too great to bear,<BR>
Amid the throng of fiends who kept<BR>
Their watch around her as she wept:<BR>
A pinnace sinking neath the wave<BR>
When mighty winds around her rave:<BR>
A lonely herd-forsaken deer,<BR>
When hungry dogs are pressing near,<BR>
Within the bower the giant passed:<BR>
Her mournful looks were downward cast.<BR>
As there she lay with streaming eyes<BR>
The giant bade the lady rise,<BR>
And to the shrinking captive showed<BR>
The glories of his rich abode,<BR>
Where thousand women spent their days<BR>
In palaces with gold ablaze;<BR>
Where wandered birds of every sort,<BR>
And jewels flashed in hall and court.<BR>
Where noble pillars charmed the sight<BR>
With diamond and lazulite,<BR>
And others glorious to behold<BR>
With ivory, crystal, silver, gold.<BR>
There swelled on high the tambour's sound,<BR>
And burnished ore was bright around<BR>
He led the mournful lady where<BR>
Resplendent gold adorned the stair,<BR>
And showed each lattice fair to see<BR>
With silver work and ivory:<BR>
Showed his bright chambers, line on line,<BR>
Adorned with nets of golden twine.<BR>
Beyond he showed the Maithil dame<BR>
His gardens bright as lightning's flame,<BR>
And many a pool and lake he showed<BR>
Where blooms of gayest colour glowed.<BR>
Through all his home from view to view<BR>
The lady sunk in grief he drew.<BR>
Then trusting in her heart to wake<BR>
Desire of all she saw, he spake:<BR>
'Three hundred million giants, all<BR>
Obedient to their master's call,<BR>
Not counting young and weak and old,<BR>
Serve me with spirits fierce and bold.<BR>
A thousand culled from all of these<BR>
Wait on the lord they long to please.<BR>
This glorious power, this pomp and sway,<BR>
Dear lady, at thy feet I lay:<BR>
Yea, with my life I give the whole,<BR>
O dearer than my life and soul.<BR>
A thousand beauties fill my hall:<BR>
Be thou my wife and rule them all.<BR>
O hear my supplication! why<BR>
This reasonable prayer deny?<BR>
Some pity to thy suitor show,<BR>
For love's hot flames within me glow.<BR>
This isle a hundred leagues in length,<BR>
Encompassed by the ocean's strength,<BR>
Would all the Gods and fiends defy<BR>
Though led by Him who rules the sky.<BR>
No God in heaven, no sage on earth,<BR>
No minstrel of celestial birth,<BR>

<P>
No spirit in the worlds I see<BR>
A match in power and might for me.<BR>
What wilt tbou do with R&aacute;ma, him<BR>
Whose days are short, whose light is dim,<BR>
Expelled from home and royal sway,<BR>
Who treads on foot his weary way?<BR>
Leave the poor mortal to his fate.<BR>
And wed thee with a worthier mate.<BR>
My timid love, enjoy with me<BR>
The prime of youth before it flee.<BR>
Do not one hour the hope retain<BR>
To look on R&aacute;ma's face again.<BR>
For whom would wildest thought beguile<BR>
To seek thee in the giants' isle?<BR>
Say who is he has power to bind<BR>
In toils of net the rushing wind.<BR>
Whose is the mighty hand will tame<BR>
And hold the glory of the flame?<BR>
In all the worlds above, below.<BR>
Not one, O fair of form, I know<BR>
Who from this isle in fight could rend<BR>
The lady whom these arms defend.<BR>
Fair Queen, o'er Lanka's island reign,<BR>
Sole mistress of the wide domain.<BR>
Gods, rovers of the night like me,<BR>
And all the world thy slaves will be.<BR>
O'er thy fair brows and queenly head<BR>
Let conscerating balm be shed,<BR>
And sorrow banished from thy breast,<BR>
Enjoy my love and take thy rest.<BR>
Here never more thy soul shall know<BR>
The memory of thy former woe,<BR>
And here shall thou enjoy the meed<BR>
Deserved by every virtuous deed.<BR>
Here garlands glow of flowery twine,<BR>
With gorgeous hues and scent divine.<BR>
Take gold and gems and rich attire:<BR>
Enjoy with me thy heart's desire.<BR>
There stand, of chariots far the best,<BR>
The car my brother once possessed.<BR>
Which, victor in the stricken field,<BR>
I forced the Lord of Gold to yield.<BR>
'Tis wide and high and nobly wrought,<BR>
Bright as the sun and swift as thought.<BR>
Therein O S&iacute;t&aacute;, shalt tbou ride<BR>
Delighted by thy lover's side.<BR>
But sorrow mars with lingering trace<BR>
The splendour of thy lotus face.<BR>
A cloud of woe is o'er it spread,<BR>
And all the light of joy is fled.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The lady, by her woe distressed,<BR>
One corner of her raiment pressed<BR>
To her sad cheek like moonlight clear.<BR>
And wiped away a falling tear.<BR>
The rover of the night renewed<BR>
His eager pleading as he viewed<BR>
The lady stand like one distraught,<BR>
Striving to fix her wandering thought:<BR>
' Think not, sweet Lady, of the shame<BR>
Of broken vows, nor fear the blame.<BR>
The Saints approve with favouring eyes<BR>

<P>
This union knit with marriage ties.<BR>
O beauty, at thy radiant feet<BR>
I lay my heads, and thus entreat.<BR>
One word of grace, one look I crave:<BR>
Have pity on thy prostrate slave.<BR>
These idle words I speak are vain,<BR>
Wrung forth by love's consuming pain,<BR>
And ne'er of R&aacute;van be it said<BR>
He wooed a dame with prostrate head.'<BR>
Thus to the Maithil lady sued<BR>
The monarch of the giant brood,<BR>
And 'She is now mine own,' he thought,<BR>
In Death's dire coils already caught.<BR>
