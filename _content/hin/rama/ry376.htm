<P>
'Receive,' he cried, 'this precious ring, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_865"></A><A HREF="#fn_865"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Sure token from thy lord the king:<BR>
The golden ring he wont to wear:<BR>
See, R&aacute;ma's name engraven there.'<BR>
Then, as she took the ring he showed,<BR>
The tears that spring of rapture flowed.<BR>
She seemed to touch the hand that sent<BR>
The dearly valued ornament,<BR>
And with her heart again at ease,<BR>
Replied in gentle words like these:<BR>
'O thou, whose soul no fears deter.<BR>
Wise, brave, and faithful messenger!<BR>
And hast thou dared, o'er wave and foam,<BR>
To seek me in the giants' home!<BR>
In thee, true messenger, I find<BR>
The noblest of thy woodland kind.<BR>
Who couldst, unmoved by terror, brook<BR>
On R&aacute;van, king of fiends, to look.<BR>

<P>
Now may we commune here as friends,<BR>
For he whom royal R&aacute;ma sends<BR>
Must needs he one in danger tried,<BR>
A valiant, wise, and faithful guide.<BR>
Say, is it well with R&aacute;ma still?<BR>
Lives Lakshman yet untouched by ill?<BR>
Then why should R&aacute;ma's hand be slow<BR>
To free his consort from her woe?<BR>
Why spare to burn, in search of me,<BR>
The land encircled by the sea?<BR>
Can Bharat send no army out<BR>
With banners, cars and battle shout?<BR>
Cannot thy king Sugr&iacute;va lend<BR>
His legions to assist his friend?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His hands upon his head he laid<BR>
And thus again his answer made:<BR>
'Not yet has R&aacute;ma learnt where lies<BR>
His lady of the lotus eyes,<BR>
Or he like Indra from the sky<BR>
To S'ach&iacute;'s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_866"></A><A HREF="#fn_866"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> aid, to thee would fly.<BR>
Soon will he hear the tale, and then,<BR>
Roused to revenge, the lord of men<BR>
Will to the giants' island lead<BR>
Fierce myriads of the woodland breed,<BR>
Bridging his conquering way, and make<BR>
The town a ruin for thy sake.<BR>
Believe my words, sweet dame; I swear<BR>
By roots and fruit, my woodland fare,<BR>
By Meru's peak and Vindhva's chain,<BR>
And Mandar of the Milky Main,<BR>
Soon shalt thou see thy lord, though now<BR>
He waits upon Prasravan's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_867"></A><A HREF="#fn_867"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> brow,<BR>
Come glorious as the breaking morn,<BR>
Like Indra on Air&aacute;vat &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_868"></A><A HREF="#fn_868"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> borne.<BR>
For thee he looks with longing eyes;<BR>
The wood his scanty food supplies.<BR>
For thee his brow is pale and worn,<BR>
For thee are meat and wine forsworn.<BR>
Thine image in his heart he keeps,<BR>
For thee by night he wakes and weeps.<BR>
Or if perchance his eyes he close<BR>
And win brief respite from his woes,<BR>
E'en then the name of S&iacute;t&aacute; slips<BR>
In anguish from his murmuring lips.<BR>
If lovely flowers or fruit lie sees,<BR>
Which women love, upon the trees,<BR>
To thee, to thee his fancy flies.<BR>
And 'S&iacute;t&aacute;! O my love!' he cries.'<BR>

has happened to R&aacute;ma since the time
when she was carried away by R&aacute;van,
The poet therefore thinks it necessary to
repeat the whole story of the meeting
between R&aacute;ma and Sugr&iacute;va, the defeat of
B&aacute;li, and subsequent events. I give the
briefest possible outline of the story.</P>
