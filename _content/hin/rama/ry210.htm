<P>
He spoke: the younger prince obeyed:<BR>
Within the bounds his way he made,<BR>
And thus addressed, whom first he met,<BR>
A pupil of the anchoret:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Brave R&aacute;ma, eldest born, who springs,<BR>
From Das'aratha, hither brings<BR>
His wife the lady S&iacute;t&aacute;: he<BR>
Would fain the holy hermit see.<BR>
Lakshman am I--if happy fame<BR>
E'er to thine ears has brought the name--<BR>
His younger brother, prompt to do<BR>
His will, devoted, fond, and true.<BR>
We, through our royal sire's decree,<BR>
To the dread woods were forced to flee.<BR>
Tell the great Master, I entreat,<BR>
Our earnest wish our lord to greet."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke: the hermit rich in store<BR>
Of fervid zeal and sacred lore,<BR>
Sought the pure shrine which held the fire,<BR>
To bear his message to the sire.<BR>
Soon as he reached the saint most bright<BR>
In sanctity's surpassing might,<BR>
He cried, uplifting reverent hands:<BR>
'Lord R&aacute;ma near thy cottage stands.'<BR>
Then spoke Agastya's pupil dear<BR>
The message for his lord to hear:<BR>
'R&aacute;ma and Lakshman, chiefs who spring<BR>
From Das'aratha, glorious king,<BR>
Thy hermitage e'en now have sought,<BR>
And lady S&iacute;t&aacute; with them brought.<BR>
The tamers of the foe are here<BR>
To see thee, Master, and revere.<BR>
'Tis thine thy further will to say:<BR>
Deign to command, and we obey.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When from his pupil's lips he knew<BR>
The presence of the princely two.<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; born to fortune high.<BR>
The glorious hermit made reply:<BR>
'Great joy at last is mine this day<BR>
That R&aacute;ma hither finds his way,<BR>
For long my soul has yearned to see<BR>
The prince who comes to visit me.<BR>
Go forth, go forth, and hither bring<BR>
The royal three with welcoming:<BR>
Lead R&aacute;ma in and place him near:<BR>
Why stands he not already here?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus ordered by the hermit, who,<BR>
Lord of his thought, all dutv knew.<BR>
His reverent hands together laid.<BR>
The pupil answered and obeyed.<BR>
Forth from the place with speed he ran,<BR>

<P>
To Lakshman came and thus began:<BR>
'Where is he? let not R&aacute;ma wait,<BR>
But speed, the sage to venerate.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then with the pupil Lakshman went<BR>
Across the hermit settlement,<BR>
And showed him R&aacute;ma where he stood<BR>
With Janak's daughter in the wood.<BR>
The pupil then his message spake<BR>
Which the kind hermit bade him take;<BR>
Then led the honoured R&aacute;ma thence<BR>
And brought him in with reverence.<BR>
As nigh the royal R&aacute;ma came<BR>
With Lakshman and the Maithil dame,<BR>
He viewed the herds of gentle deer<BR>
Roaming the garden free from fear.<BR>
As through the sacred grove he trod<BR>
He viewed the seat of many a God,<BR>
Brahm&aacute; and Agni, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Sun and Moon,<BR>
And His who sends each golden boon; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Here Vishnu's stood, there Bhaga's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> shrine,<BR>
And there Mahendra's Lord divine;<BR>
Here His who formed this earthly frame,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><BR>
His there from whom all beings came. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_433"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><BR>
V&aacute;yu's,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and His who loves to hold<BR>
The great noose, Varim &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> mighty-souled:<BR>
Here was the Vasus'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> shrine to see,<BR>
Here that of sacred G&aacute;yatr&iacute;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A><BR>
The king of serpents &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> here had place,<BR>
And he who rules the feathered race. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A><BR>
Here K&aacute;rtikeya, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> warrior lord,<BR>
And there was Justice' King adored.<BR>
Then with disciples girt about<BR>
The mighty saint himself came out:<BR>
Through fierce devotion bright as flame<BR>
Before the rest the Master came:<BR>
And then to Lakshman, fortune blest,<BR>
R&aacute;ma these hasty words addressed:<BR>
'Behold, Agastya's self draws near,<BR>
The mighty saint, whom all revere:<BR>
With spirit raised I meet my lord<BR>
With richest wealth of penance stored.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The strong-armed hero spake, and ran<BR>
Forward to meet the sunbright man.<BR>
Before him, as he came, he bent<BR>
And clasped his feet most reverent,<BR>
Then rearing up his stately height<BR>
Stood suppliant by the anchorite,<BR>
While Lakshman's strength and S&iacute;t&aacute;'s grace<BR>
Stood by the pride of Raghu's race.<BR>

The sage his arms round Rama threw<BR>
And welcomed him with honours due,<BR>
Asked, was all well, with question sweet.<BR>
And bade the hero to a seat.<BR>
With holy oil he fed the flame,<BR>
He brought the gifts which strangers claim,<BR>
And kindly waiting on the three<BR>
With honours due to high degree,<BR>
He gave with hospitable care<BR>
A simple hermit's woodland fare.<BR>
Then sat the reverend father, first<BR>
Of hermits, deep in duty versed.<BR>
And thus to suppliant R&aacute;ma, bred<BR>
In all the lore of virtue, said:<BR>
'Did the false hermit, Prince, neglect<BR>
To hail his guest with due respect,<BR>
He must,--the doom the perjured meet,--<BR>
His proper flesh hereafter eat.<BR>
A car-borne king a lord who sways<BR>
The earth, and virtue's law obeys,<BR>
Worthy of highest honour, thou<BR>
Hast sought, dear guest, my cottage now.'<BR>
He spoke: with fruit and hermit fare,<BR>
With every bloom the branches bare,<BR>
Agastya graceed his honoured guest,<BR>
And thus with gentle words addressed:<BR>
'Accept this mighty bow, divine.<BR>
Whereon red gold and diamonds shine;<BR>
'Twas by the Heavenly Artist planned<BR>
For Vishnu's own almighty hand:<BR>
This God-sent shaft of sunbright hue,<BR>
Whose deadly flight is ever true,<BR>
By Lord Mahendra given of yore:<BR>
This quiver with its endless store.<BR>
Keen arrows hurtling to their aim<BR>
Like kindled fires that flash and flame:<BR>
Accept, in golden sheath encased,<BR>
This sword with hilt of rich gold graced.<BR>
Armed, whilom, with this best of bows<BR>
Lord Vishnu slew his demon foes,<BR>
And mid the dwellers in the skies<BR>
Won brilliant glory for his prize.<BR>
The bow, the quivers, shaft, and sword<BR>
Received from me, O glorious lord:<BR>
These conquest to thine arm shall bring,<BR>
As thunder to the thunder's King.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The splendid hermit bade him take<BR>
The noble weapons as he spake,<BR>
And as the prince accepted each<BR>
In words like these renewed his speech:<BR>
