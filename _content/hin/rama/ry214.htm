<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XVI.: WINTER.</H3>
<P>
While there the high-souled hero spent<BR>
His tranquil hours in sweet content,<BR>
The glowing autumn passed, and then<BR>
Came winter so beloved of men.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  One morn, to bathe, at break of day<BR>
To the fair stream he took his way.<BR>
Behind him, with the Maithil dame<BR>
Bearing a pitcher Lakshman came,<BR>
And as he went the mighty man<BR>
Thus to his brother chief began:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'The time is come, to thee more dear<BR>
Than all the months that mark the year<BR>
The gracious seasons' joy and pride,<BR>
By which the rest are glorified.<BR>
A robe of hoary rime is spread<BR>
O'er earth, with cold engarlanded.<BR>
The streams we loved no longer please,<BR>
But near the fire we take our ease,<BR>
Now pious men to God and shade<BR>
Offer young corn's fresh sprouted blade,<BR>
And purge away their sins with fire<BR>
Bestowed in humble sacrifice.<BR>
Rich stores of milk delight the swain,<BR>
And hearts are cheered that longed for gain.<BR>
Proud kings whose breasts for conquests glow<BR>
Lead bannered troops to smite the foe.<BR>
Dark is the north: the Lord of Day<BR>
To Yama's south &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_452"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> has turned away:<BR>
And she--sad widow--shines no more,<BR>
Reft of the bridal mark &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> she wore.<BR>
Him&aacute;laya's hill, ordained of old<BR>
The treasure-house of frost and cold,<BR>
Scarce conscious of the feebler glow,<BR>
Is truly now the Lord of Snow.<BR>
Warmed by the noontide's genial rays<BR>
Delightful are the glorious days:<BR>
But how we shudder at the chill<BR>
Of evening shadows and the rill!<BR>
How weak the sun, how cold the breeze!<BR>
How white the rime on grass and trees!<BR>
The leaves are sere, the woods have lost<BR>
Their blossoms killed by nipping frost.<BR>
Neath open skies we sleep no more:<BR>
December's nights with rime are hoar:<BR>
Their triple watch &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_454"></A><A HREF="#fn_454"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in length extends<BR>
With hours the shortened daylight lends.<BR>
No more the moon's sun-borrowed rays<BR>
Are bright, involved in misty haze,<BR>
As when upon the mirror's sheen<BR>
The breath's obscuring cloud is seen.<BR>
E'en at the full the faint beams fail<BR>
To struggle through the darksome veil:<BR>
Changed like her hue, they want the grace<BR>
That parts not yet from S&iacute;t&aacute;'s face.<BR>
Cold is the western wind, but how<BR>
Its piercing chill is heightened now,<BR>
Blowing at early morning twice<BR>
As furious with its breath of ice!<BR>
See how the dewy tears they weep<BR>
The barley, wheat, and woodland steep,<BR>
Where, as the sun goes up the sky.<BR>
The curlew and the s&aacute;ras cry.<BR>
See where the rice plants scarce uphold<BR>
Their full ears tinged with paly gold,<BR>
Bending their ripe heads slowly down<BR>
Fair as the date tree's flowery crown.<BR>
Though now the sun has mounted high<BR>
Seeking the forehead of the sky,<BR>
Such mist obscures his struggling beams,<BR>
No bigger than the moon he seems.<BR>
Though weak at first, his rays at length<BR>
Grow pleasant in their noonday strength,<BR>
And where a while they chance to fall<BR>
Fling a faint splendour over all.<BR>

See, o'er the woods where grass is wet<BR>
With hoary drops that cling there yet,<BR>
With soft light clothing earth and bough<BR>
There steals a tender glory now.<BR>
Yon elephant who longs to drink,<BR>
Still standing on the river's brink,<BR>
Plucks back his trunk in shivering haste<BR>
From the cold wave he fain would taste.<BR>
The very fowl that haunt the mere<BR>
Stand doubtful on the bank, and fear<BR>
To dip them in the wintry wave<BR>
As cowards dread to meet the brave.<BR>
The frost of night, the rime of dawn<BR>
Bind flowerless trees and glades of lawn:<BR>
Benumbed in apathetic chill<BR>
Of icy chains they slumber still.<BR>
You hear the hidden s&aacute;ras cry<BR>
From floods that wrapped in vapour lie,<BR>
And frosty-shining sands reveal<BR>
Where the unnoticed rivers steal.<BR>
The hoary rime of dewy night,<BR>
And suns that glow with tempered light<BR>
Lend fresh cool flavours to the rill<BR>
That sparkles from the tompost hill.<BR>
The cold has killed the lily's pride:<BR>
Leaf, filament, and flower have died:<BR>
With chilling breath rude winds have blown,<BR>
The withered stalk is left alone.<BR>
At this gay time, O noblest chief,<BR>
The faithful Bharat, worn by grief,<BR>
Lives in the royal town where he<BR>
Spends weary hours for love of thee.<BR>
From titles, honour, kingly sway,<BR>
From every joy he turns away:<BR>
Couched on cold earth, his days are passed<BR>
With scanty fare and hermit's fast.<BR>
This moment from his humble bed<BR>
He lifts, perhaps, his weary head,<BR>
And girt by many a follower goes<BR>
To bathe where silver Sarj&uacute; flows.<BR>
How, when the frosty morn is dim,<BR>
Shall Sarj&uacute; be a bath for him<BR>
Nursed with all love and tender care,<BR>
So delicate and young and fair.<BR>
How bright his hue! his brilliant eye<BR>
With the broad lotus leaf may vie.<BR>
By fortune stamped for happy fate,<BR>
His graceful form is tall aud straight.<BR>
In duty skilled, his words are truth:<BR>
He proudly rules each lust of youth.<BR>
Though his strong arm smites down the foe,<BR>
In gentle speech his accents flow.<BR>
Yet every joy has he resigned<BR>
And cleaves to thee with heart and mind.<BR>
Thus by the deeds that he has done<BR>
A name in heaven has Bharat won,<BR>
For in his life he follows yet<BR>
Thy steps, O banished anchoret.<BR>
Thus faithful Bharat, nobly wise,<BR>
The proverb of the world belies:<BR>
'No men, by mothers' guidance led,<BR>
The footsteps of their fathers tread.'<BR>
How could Kaikey&iacute;, blest to be<BR>
Spouse of the king our sire, and see<BR>
A son like virtuous Bharat, blot<BR>
Her glory with so foul a plot!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus in fraternal love he spoke,<BR>
And from his lips reproaches broke:<BR>
But R&aacute;ma grieved to hear him chide<BR>
The absent mother, and replied:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Cease, O beloved, cease to blame<BR>
Our royal father's second dame.<BR>
Still speak of Bharat first in place<BR>
Of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's princely race.<BR>
My heart, so firmly bent but now<BR>
To dwell in woods and keep my vow,<BR>
Half melting as I hear thee speak<BR>
Of Bharat's love, grows soft and weak,<BR>
With tender joy I bring to mind<BR>
His speeches ever sweet and kind.<BR>
That dear as Amrit took the sense<BR>
With most enchanting influence.<BR>
Ah, when shall I, no more to part,<BR>
Meet Bharat of the mighty heart?<BR>
When, O my brother, when shall we<BR>
The good and brave S'atrughna see?'<BR>
Thus as he poured his fond lament<BR>
The son of Raghu onward went:<BR>
They reached the river, and the three<BR>
Bathed them in fair God&aacute;var&iacute;.<BR>
Libations of the stream they paid<BR>
To every deity and shade,<BR>
With hymns of praise, the Sun on high<BR>
And sinless Gods to glorify.<BR>
Fresh from the purifying tide<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Resplendent R&aacute;ma came,<BR>
With Lakshman ever by his side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And the sweet Maithil dame.<BR>
So Rudra shines by worlds adored,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In glory undefiled,<BR>
When Nandi &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_455"></A><A HREF="ry215.htm#fn_455"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> stands beside his lord,<BR>
And King Him&aacute;laya's child. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="ry215.htm#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
