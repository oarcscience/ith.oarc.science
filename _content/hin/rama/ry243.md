### CANTO XLV.: LAKSHMAN'S DEPARTURE.

But Sitá hearing as she thought,  
Her husband's cry with anguish fraught.  
Called to her guardian, 'Lakshman, run  
And in the wood seek Raghu's son.  
Scarce can my heart retain its throne,  
Scarce can my life be called mine own,  
Assail my powers and senses fail  
At that long loud and bitter wail.  
Haste to the wood with all thy speed  
And save thy brother in his need  
Go, save him in the distant glade  
Where loud he calls, for timely aid.  
He \* beneath some giant foe,  
A \* whom \* overthrown'  
   \* to her prayer,\* step he stirred  
Obedient to his mother's word  
T \* Janak's child, with inflamed,  
\* scorn \*  
   Sumitrá's son, a friend \*  
\* they brother's foe  
W\* at such \*  
\* and neglect \*  
\* Lakshman, \* of me  
\* couldst see,  
\* thy \*  
\* thy feet so \*  

Thou hast no love for Ráma, no  
Thy joy is vice thy thoughts are low  
Hence thus unmoved thou yet canst stay  
While my dear lord is far away.  
If aught of ill my lord betide  
Who led thee here, thy chief and guide  
Ah what will be my hapless fate  
Left in the wild wood desolate!'  
   Thus spoke the lady sad with fear.  
With many a sigh and many a tear,  
Still trembling like a captured doe:  
And Lakshman spoke to calm her woe:  
  'Videhan Queen, be sure of this,--  
And at the thought thy fear dismiss,--  
Thy husband's mightier power defies  
All Gods and angels of the skies,  
Gandharvas, and the sons of light,  
Serpents, and rovers of the night  
I tell thee, of the sons of earth,  
Of Gods who boast celestial birth,  
Of beasts and birds and giant hosts,  
Of demigods, Gandharvas ghosts,  
Of awful fiends, O thou most fair,  
There lives not one whose heart would dare  
To meet thy Ráma in the fight,  
Like Indra's self unmatched in might.  
Such idle words thou must not say  
Thy Ráma lives whom none may slay.  
I will not, cannot leave thee here  
In the wild wood till he be near.  
The mightiest strength can ne'er withstand  
His eager force, his vigorous hand.  
No, not the triple world allied  
With all the immortal Gods beside.  
Dismiss thy fear, again take heart,  
Let all thy doubt and woe depart.  
Thy lord, be sure, will soon be here  
And bring thee back that best of deer,  
Not his, not his that mournful cry,  
Nor haply came it from the sky.  
Some giant's art was busy there  
And framed a castle based on air  
A precious pledge art thou, consigned  
To me by him of noblest mind,  
Nor can I fairest dame, forsake  
The pledge which Ráma bade me take.  
Upon our heads, O Queen, we drew  
The giants' hate when Ráma slew  
Their chieftain Khara, and the shade  
Of Janasthán in ruin laid.  
Through all this mighty wood they rove  
With varied cries from grove to grove  
On \* bent they wander here.  
But O dismiss thy causeless fear.'  
   Bright flashed her eye as Lashman spoke  
And forth her words of fury broke  
Upon her truthful guardian, flung  
With bitter taunts that pierced and stung;  
'Shame on such false compassion, base  
\* of thy glorious race!  
\* joyous sight I ween to thee  

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>  

My lord in direst strait to see.  
Thou knowest Ráma sore bested,  
Or word like this thou ne'er hadst said.  
No marvel if we find such sin  
In rivals false to kith and kin.  
Wretches like thee of evil kind,  
Concealing crime with crafty mind.  
Thou, wretch, thine aid wilt still deny,  
And leave my lord alone to die.  
Has love of me unnerved thy hand,  
Or Bharat's art this ruin planned?  
But be the treachery his or thine,  
In vain, in vain the base design.  
For how shall I, the chosen bride  
Of dark-hued Ráma, lotus-eyed,  
The queen who once called Ráma mine,  
To love of other men decline?  
Believe me, Lakshman, Ráma's wife  
Before thine eyes will quit this life,  
And not a moment will she stay  
If her dear lord have passed away.'  
   The lady's bitter speech, that stirred  
Each hair upon his frame, he heard.  
With lifted hands together laid,  
His calm reply he gently made:  
   'No words have I to answer now:  
My deity, O Queen, art thou.  
But 'tis no marvel, dame, to find  
Such lack of sense in womankind.  
Throughout this world, O Maithil dame,  
Weak women's hearts are still the same.  
Inconstant, urged by envious spite,  
They sever friends and hate the right.  
I cannot brook, Videhan Queen,  
Thy words intolerably keen.  
Mine ears thy fierce reproaches pain  
As boiling water seethes the brain.  
And now to bear me witness all  
The dwellers in the wood I call,  
That, when with words of truth I plead,  
This harsh reply is all my meed.  
Ah, woe is thee! Ah, grief, that still  
Eager to do my brother's will,  
Mourning thy woman's nature, I  
Must see thee doubt my truth and die.  
I fly to Ráma's side, and Oh,  
May bliss attend thee while I go!  
May all attendant wood-gods screen  
Thy head from harm, O large-eyed Queen  
And though dire omens meet my sight  
And fill my soul with wild affright,  
May I return in peace and see  
The son of Raghu safe with thee!'  
   The child of Janak heard him speak,  
And the hot tear-drops down her cheek,  
Increasing to a torrent, ran,  
Aa thus once more the dame began:  
'O Lakshman, if I widowed be  
Godávan's\*\* flood shall cover me,  
Or I will die by cord, or leap,  
Life weary, from yon rocky steep;  

Or deadly poison will I drink,  
Or 'neath the kindled flames will sink,  
But never, reft of Ráma, can  
Consent to touch a meaner man.'  
   The Maithil dame with many sighs,  
And torrents pouring from her eyes,  
The faithful Lakshman thus adressed,  
And smote her hands upon her breast.  
Sumitrá's son, o'erwhelmed by fears,  
   Looked on the large-eyed queen:  
     He saw that flood of burning tears,  
   He saw that piteous mien.  
     He yearned sweet comfort to afford,  
   He strove to soothe her pain  
     But to the brother of her lord  
  She spoke no word again.  
     His reverent hands once more he raised,  
   His head he slightly bent,  
     Upon her face he sadly gazed,  
   And then toward Ráma went.
