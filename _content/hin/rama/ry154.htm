<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXVI.: THE FUNERAL</H3>
<P>
The saint Vas'ishtha, best of all<BR>
Whose words with moving wisdom fall,<BR>
Bharat, Kaikey&iacute;'s son, addressed,<BR>
Whom burning *?fires of grief distressed:<BR>
'O Prince, whose fame is widely spread,<BR>
Enough of grief: be comforted.<BR>
The time is come: arise, and lay<BR>
Upon the pyre the monarch's clay.'<BR>

<P>

<P>
He heard the words Vas'ishtha spoke,<BR>
And slumbering resolution woke.<BR>
Then skilled in all the laws declare,<BR>
He bade his friends the rites prepare<BR>
They raised, the body from the oil,<BR>
And placed it, dripping, on the soil;<BR>
Then laid it on a bed, whereon<BR>
Wrought gold and precious jewels shone.<BR>
There, pallor o'er his features spread,<BR>
The monarch, as in sleep, lay dead.<BR>
Then Bharat sought his father's side,<BR>
And lifted up his voice and cried:<BR>
'O King, and has thy heart designed<BR>
To part and leave thy son behind?<BR>
Make R&aacute;ma flee, who loves the right,<BR>
And Lakshman of the arm of might?<BR>
Whither, great Monarch, wilt thou go<BR>
And leave this people in their woe.<BR>
Mourning their hero, wild with grief,<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma reft, their lion chief?<BR>
Ah, who will guard the people well<BR>
Who in Ayodhy&aacute;'s city dwell,<BR>
When thou, my sire, hast sought the sky,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma has been forced to fly?<BR>
In widowed woe, bereft of thee,<BR>
The land no more is fair to *see*<BR>
The city, to my aching sight,<BR>
Is gloomy as a moonless night.'<BR>

<P>
Thus, with o'erwhelming sorrow pained,<BR>
Sad Bharat by the bed complained:<BR>
And thus Vas'ishtha, holy sage,<BR>
Spoke his deep anguish to assuage:<BR>
'O Lord of men, no longer stay;<BR>
The last remaining duties pay:<BR>
Haste, mighty-armed, as I advise,<BR>
The funeral rites to solemnize.'<BR>

<P>
And Bharat heard Vas'ishtha's rede<BR>
With due attention and agreed.<BR>
He summoned straight from every side<BR>
Chaplain, and priest, and holy guide.<BR>
The sacred fires he bade them bring<BR>
Forth from the ohapel of the king,<BR>
Wherein the priests in order due,<BR>
And ministers, the offerings threw,<BR>
Distraught in mind, with sob and tear,<BR>
They laid the body on a bier,<BR>
And servants, while their eyes brimmed o'er<BR>
The monarch from the palace bore,<BR>
Another band of mourners led<BR>
The long procession of the dead:<BR>
Rich garments in the way they cast,<BR>
And gold and silver, as they passed,<BR>
Then other hands the corse bedewed<BR>
With fragrant juices that exude<BR>
From sandal, cedar, aloe, pine,<BR>
And every perfume rare and fine.<BR>
Then priestly hands the mighty dead<BR>
Upon the pyre deposited.<BR>
The sacred fires they tended next,<BR>
And muttered low each funeral text;<BR>
And priestly singers who rehearse<BR>

The S'aman &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="ry155.htm#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> sang their holy verse.<BR>
Forth from the town in litters came,<BR>
Or chariots, many a royal dame,<BR>
And honoured so the funeral ground,<BR>
With aged followers ringed around.<BR>
With steps in inverse order bent, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="ry155.htm#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The priests in sad procession went<BR>
Around the monarch's burning pyre<BR>
Who well had nursed each sacred fire:<BR>
With Queen Kaus'aly&aacute; and the rest,<BR>
Their tender hearts with woe distressed,<BR>
The voice of women, shrill and clear<BR>
As screaming curlews, smote the ear,<BR>
As from a thousand voices rose<BR>
The shriek that tells of woman's woes.<BR>
Then weeping, faint, with loud lament,<BR>
Down Sarj&uacute;'s shelving bank they went.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  There standing on the river side<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With Bharat, priest, and peer,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Their lips the women purified<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With water fresh and clear.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Returning to the royal town,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Their eyes with tear-drops filled,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ten days on earth they laid them down,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And wept till grief was stilled.<BR>

for any particular person: he merely
wishes to prove his own innocence by invoking
them on his own head if he had
any share in banishing R&aacute;ma.</P>
