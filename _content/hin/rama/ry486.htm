<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CXV.: SIT&Aacute;'S JOY.</H3>
<P>
The V&aacute;nar chieftain bowed his head.<BR>
Within the walls of Lank&aacute; sped,<BR>
Leave from the new-made king obtained,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute;'s lovely garden gained.<BR>
Beneath a tree the queen he found,<BR>
Where R&aacute;kshas warders watched around.<BR>
Her pallid cheek, her tangled hair,<BR>
Her raiment showed her deep despair,<BR>
Near and more near the envoy came<BR>
And gently hailed the weeping dame.<BR>
She started up in sweet surprise,<BR>
And sudden joy illumed her eyes.<BR>
For well the V&aacute;nar's voice she knew,<BR>
And hope reviving sprang and grew.<BR>

<P>
'Fair Queen,' he said, 'our task is done:<BR>
The foe is slain and Lank&aacute; won.<BR>
Triumphant mid triumphant friends<BR>
Kind words of greeting R&aacute;ma sends.<BR>
'Blest for thy sake, O spouse most true,<BR>
My deadly foe I met and slew.<BR>
Mine eyes are strangers yet to sleep:<BR>
I built a bridge athwart the deep<BR>
And crossed the sea to Lank&aacute;'s shore<BR>
To keep the mighty oath I swore.<BR>
Now, gentle love, thy cares dispel,<BR>
And weep no more, for all is well.<BR>
Fear not in R&aacute;van's house to stay<BR>
For good Vibh&iacute;shan now bears sway,<BR>
For constant truth and friendship known.<BR>

<P>
Regard his palace as thine own.'<BR>
He greets thee thus thy heart to cheer,<BR>
And urged by love will soon be here.'<BR>

<P>
Then flushed with joy the lady's cheek.<BR>
Her eyes o'erflowed, her voice was weak;<BR>
But struggling with her sobs she broke<BR>
Her silence thus, and faintly spoke:<BR>
'So fast the flood of rapture came,<BR>
My trembling tongue no words could frame.<BR>
Ne'er have I heard in days of bliss<BR>
A tale that gave such joy as this.<BR>
More precious far than gems and gold<BR>
The message which thy lips have told.'<BR>

<P>
His reverent hands the V&aacute;nar raised<BR>
And thus the lady's answer praised:<BR>
'Sweet are the words, O Queen, which thou<BR>
True to thy lord, hast spoken now,<BR>
Better than gems and pearls of price,<BR>
Yea, or the throne of Paradise.<BR>
But, lady, ere I leave this place,<BR>
Grant me, I pray, a single grace.<BR>
Permit me, and this vengeful hand<BR>
Shall slay thy guards, this R&aacute;kshas band,<BR>
Whose cruel insult threat and scorn<BR>
Thy gentle soul too long has borne.'<BR>

<P>
Thus, stern of mood, Hanum&aacute;n cried:<BR>
The Maithil lady thus replied:<BR>
'Nay, be not wroth with servants: they,<BR>
When monarchs bid must needs obey.<BR>
And, vassals of their lords, fulfil<BR>
Each fancy of their sovereign will.<BR>
To mine own sins the blame impute,<BR>
For as we sow we reap the fruit.<BR>
The tyrant's will these dames obeyed<BR>
When their fierce threats my soul dismayed.'<BR>

<P>
She ceased: with admiration moved<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chief her words approved:<BR>
'Thy speech,' he cried, 'is worthy one<BR>
Whom love has linked to Raghu's son.<BR>
Now speak, O Queen, that I may know<BR>
Thy pleasure, for to him I go.'<BR>
The V&aacute;nar ceased: then Janak's child<BR>
Made answer as she sweetly smiled:<BR>
'My first, my only wish can be,<BR>
O chief, my loving lord to see.'<BR>
Again the V&aacute;nar envoy spoke,<BR>
And with his words new rapture woke:<BR>
'Queen, ere this sun shall cease to shine<BR>
Thy R&aacute;ma's eyes shall look in thine.<BR>
Again the lord of Raghu's race<BR>
Shall turn to thee his moon-bright face.<BR>
His faithful brother shall thou see<BR>
And every friend who fought for thee,<BR>
And greet once more thy king restored<BR>
Like S'ach&iacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1037"></A><A HREF="#fn_1037"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to her heavenly lord.'<BR>
To Raghu's son his steps he bent<BR>
And told the message that she sent.<BR>
