<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLVIII: R&Aacute;VAN'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
With knitted brow and furious eye<BR>
The stranger made his fierce reply;<BR>
'In me O fairest dame, behold<BR>
The brother of the King of Gold.<BR>
The Lord of Ten Necks my title, named<BR>
R&aacute;van, for might and valour famed.<BR>
Gods and Gandharva hosts I scare;<BR>
Snakes, spirits, birds that roam the air<BR>
Fly from my coming, wild with fear,<BR>
Trembling like men when Death is near<BR>
Vais'ravan once, my brother, wrought<BR>
To ire, encountered me aud fought,<BR>

<P>
But yielding to superior might<BR>
Fled from his home in sore affright.<BR>
Lord of the man-drawn chariot, still<BR>
He dwells on famed Kail&aacute;sa's hill.<BR>
I made the vanquished king resign<BR>
The glorious car which now is mine,--<BR>
Pushpak, the far-renowned, that flies<BR>
Will-guided through the buxom skies.<BR>
Celestial hosts by Indra led<BR>
Flee from my face disquieted,<BR>
And where my dreaded feet appear<BR>
The wind is hushed or breathless is fear.<BR>
Where'er I stand, where'er I go<BR>
The troubled waters cease to flow,<BR>
Each spell-bound wave is mute and still<BR>
And the fierce sun himself is chill.<BR>
Beyond the sea my Lank&aacute; stands<BR>
Filled with fierce forms and giant bands,<BR>
A glorious city fair to see<BR>
As Indra's Amar&aacute;vat&iacute;.<BR>
A towering height of solid wall,<BR>
Flashing afar, surrounds it all,<BR>
Its golden courts enchant the sight,<BR>
And gates aglow with lazulite.<BR>
Steeds, elephants, and cars are there,<BR>
And drums' loud music fills the air,<BR>
Fair trees in lovely gardens grow<BR>
Whose boughs with varied fruitage glow.<BR>
Thou, beauteous Queen, with me shalt dwell<BR>
In halls that suit a princess well,<BR>
Thy former fellows shall forget<BR>
Nor think of women with regret,<BR>
No earthly joy thy soul shall miss,<BR>
And take its fill of heavenly bliss.<BR>
Of mortal R&aacute;ma think no more,<BR>
Whose terms of days will soon be o'er.<BR>
King Das'aratha looked in scorn<BR>
On R&aacute;ma though the eldest born,<BR>
Sent to the woods the weakling fool,<BR>
And set his darling son to rule<BR>
What, O thou large-eyed dame, hast thou<BR>
To do with fallen R&aacute;ma now,<BR>
From home and kingdom forced to fly,<BR>
A wretched hermit soon to die<BR>
Accept thy lover, nor refuse<BR>
The giant king who fondly woos.<BR>
O listen, nor reject in scorn<BR>
A heart by K&aacute;ma's arrows torn.<BR>
If thou refuse to hear my prayer,<BR>
Of grief and coming woe beware;<BR>
For the sad fate will fall on thee<BR>
Which came on hapless Urvas'&iacute;,<BR>
When with her foot she chanced to touch<BR>
Pur&uacute;ravas, and sorrowed much. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
My little finger raised in fight<BR>
Were more than match for R&aacute;ma's might<BR>
O fairest, blithe and happy be<BR>

<P>

<P>
With him whom fortune sends to thee.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Such were the words the giant said,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute;'s angry eyes were red.<BR>
She answered in that lonely place<BR>
The monarch of the giant race:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Art thou the brother of the Lord<BR>
Of Gold by all the world adored,<BR>
And sprung of that illustrious seed<BR>
Wouldst now attempt this evil deed?<BR>
I tell thee, impious Monarch, all<BR>
The giants by thy sin will fall,<BR>
Whose reckless lord and king thou art,<BR>
With foolish mind and lawless heart.<BR>
Yea, one may hope to steal the wife<BR>
Of Indra and escape with life.<BR>
But he who R&aacute;ma's dame would tear<BR>
From his loved side must needs despair,<BR>
Yea, one may steal fair S'ach&iacute;, dame<BR>
Of Him who shoots the thunder flame,<BR>
May live successful in his aim<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And length of day may see;<BR>
But hope, O giant King, in vain,<BR>
Though cups of Amrit thou may drain,<BR>
To shun the penalty and pain<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of wronging one like me.'<BR>
