<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXI.: KABANDHA'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Kabandha saw each chieftain stand<BR>
Imprisoned by his mighty hand,<BR>
Which like a snare around him pressed<BR>
And thus the royal pair addressed:<BR>
'Why, warriors, are your glances bent<BR>
On me whom hungry pangs torment?<BR>
Why stand with wildered senses? Fate<BR>
Has brought you now my maw to sate.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Lakshman heard, a while appalled,<BR>
His ancient courage he recalled,<BR>
And to his brother by his side<BR>
With seasonable counsel cried :<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'This vilest of the giant race<BR>
Will draw us to his side apace.<BR>
Come, rouse thee; let the vengeful sword<BR>
Smite off his arms, my honoured lord.<BR>
This awful giant, vast of size,<BR>
On his huge strength of arm relies,<BR>
And o'er the world victorious, thus<BR>
With mighty force would slaughter us,<BR>
But in cold blood to slay, O King.<BR>
Discredit on the brave would bring,<BR>
As when some victim in the rite<BR>
Shuns not the hand up raised to smite.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The monstrous fiend, to anger stirred,<BR>

<P>
The converse of the brothers heard.<BR>
His horrid mouth he opened wide<BR>
And drew the princes to his side.<BR>
They, skilled due time and place to note<BR>
Unsheathed their glittering sword and smote,<BR>
Till fiom the giant's shoulders they<BR>
Had hewn the mighty arms away.<BR>
His trenchant falchion R&aacute;ma plied<BR>
And smote him on the better side,<BR>
While valiant Lakshman on the left<BR>
The arm that held him prisoned cleft,<BR>
Then to the earth dismembered fell<BR>
The monster with a hideous yell,<BR>
And like a cloud's his deep roar went<BR>
Through earth and air and firmament.<BR>
Then as the giant's blood flowed fast,<BR>
On his cleft limbs his eye he cast,<BR>
And called upon the princely pair<BR>
Their names and lineage to declare.<BR>
Him then the noble Lakshman, blest<BR>
With fortune's favouring marks, addressed,<BR>
And told the fiend his brother's name<BR>
And the high blood of which he came:<BR>
'Ikshv&aacute;ku's heir here R&aacute;ma stands,<BR>
Illustrious through a hundred lands.<BR>
I, younger brother of the heir,<BR>
O fiend, the name of Lakshman bear.<BR>
His mother stole his realm away<BR>
And drove him forth in woods to stray.<BR>
Thus through the mighty forest he<BR>
Roamed with his royal wife and me.<BR>
While glorious as a God he made<BR>
His dwelling in the greenwood shade,<BR>
Some giant stole away his dame,<BR>
And seeking her we hither came.<BR>
But tell me who thou art, and why<BR>
With headless trunk that towered so high.<BR>
With flaming face beneath thy chest,<BR>
Thou liest crushed in wild unrest.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He heard the words that Lakshman spoke,<BR>
And memory in his breast awoke,<BR>
Recalling Indra's words to mind<BR>
He spoke in gentle tones and kind:<BR>
'O welcome best of men, are ye<BR>
Whom, blest by fate, this day I see.<BR>
A blessing on each trenchant blade<BR>
That low on earth these arms has laid!<BR>
Thou, lord of men, incline thine ear<BR>
The story of my woe to hear,<BR>
While I the rebel pride declare<BR>
Which doomed me to the form I wear.'<BR>
