<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXIV.: RAMA'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
Reft of his love, the royal chief,<BR>
Weighed down beneath his whelming grief,<BR>
Desponding made his brother share<BR>
His grievous burden of despair.<BR>
Over his sinking bosom rolled<BR>
The flood of sorrow uncontrolled.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And as he wept and sighed,<BR>
In mournful accents faint and slow<BR>
With words congenial to his woe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To Lakshman thus he cried:<BR>
'Brother, I ween, beneath the sun,<BR>
Of all mankind there lives not one<BR>
So full of sin, whose hand has done<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Such cursed deeds as mine.<BR>
For my sad heart with misery bleeds,<BR>
As, guerdon of those evil deeds,<BR>

<P>
Still greater woe to woe succeeds<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In never-ending line.<BR>
A life of sin I freely chose,<BR>
And from my past transgression flows<BR>
A ceaseless flood of bitter woes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My folly to repay.<BR>
The fruit of sin has ripened fast.<BR>
Through many a sorrow have I passed,<BR>
And now the crowning grief at last<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Falls on my head to-day.<BR>
From all my faithful friends I fled,<BR>
My sire is numbered with the dead,<BR>
My royal rank is forfeited,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My mother far away.<BR>
These woes on which I sadly think<BR>
Fill, till it raves above the brink,<BR>
The stream of grief in which I sink,--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The flood which naught can stay.<BR>
Ne'er, brother, ne'er have I complained;<BR>
Though long by toil and trouble pained,<BR>
Without a murmur I sustained<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The woes of woodland life.<BR>
But fiercer than the flames that rise<BR>
When crackling wood the food supplies,--<BR>
Flashing a glow through evening skies,--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  This sorrow for my wife.<BR>
Some cruel fiend has seized the prey<BR>
And torn my trembling love away,<BR>
While, as he bore her through the skies,<BR>
She shrieked aloud with frantic cries,<BR>
It tones of fear which, wild and shrill,<BR>
Retained their native sweetness still.<BR>
Ah me, that breast so soft and sweet,<BR>
For sandal's precious perfume meet,<BR>
Now all detained with dust and gore,<BR>
Shall meet my fond caress no more.<BR>
That face, whose lips with tones so clear<BR>
Made pleasant music, sweet to hear,--<BR>
With soft locks plaited o'er the brow,--<BR>
Some giant's hand is on it now.<BR>
It smiles not, us the dear light fails<BR>
When R&aacute;hu's jaw the moon assails.<BR>
Ah, my true love! that shapely neck<BR>
She loved with fairest chains to deck,<BR>
The cruel demons rend, and drain<BR>
The lifeblood from each mangled vein.<BR>
Ah, when the savage monsters came<BR>
And dragged away the helpless dame,<BR>
'The lady of the long soft eye<BR>
Called like a lamb with piteous cry.<BR>
Beneath this rock, O Lakshman, see,<BR>
My peerless consort sat with me,<BR>
And gently talked to thee the while,<BR>
Her sweet lips opening with a smile.<BR>
Here is that fairest stream which she<BR>
Loved ever, bright God&aacute;var&iacute;.<BR>
Ne'er can the dame have passed this way:<BR>
So far alone she would not stray,<BR>
Nor has my darling, lotus-eyed,<BR>
Sought lilies by the river's side,<BR>
For without me she ne'er would go<BR>

<P>
To streamlets where the wild flowers grow,<BR>
Tell me not, brother, she has strayed<BR>
To the dark forest's distant shade<BR>
Where blooming boughs are gay and sweet,<BR>
And bright birds love the cool retreat.<BR>
Alone my love would never dare,--<BR>
My timid love,--to wander there.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  O Lord of Day whose eye sees all<BR>
We act and plan, on thee I call:<BR>
For naught is hidden from thy sight,--<BR>
Great witness thou of wrong and right.<BR>
Where is she, lost or torn away?<BR>
Dispel my torturing doubt and say.<BR>
And O thou Wind who blowest free,<BR>
The worlds have naught concealed from thee.<BR>
List to my prayer, reveal one trace<BR>
Of her, the glory of her race.<BR>
Say, is she stolen hence, or dead,<BR>
Or do her feet the forest tread?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus with disordered senses, faint<BR>
With woe he poured his sad complaint,<BR>
And then, a better way to teach,<BR>
Wise Lakshman spoke in seemly speech:<BR>
'Up, brother dear, thy grief subdue,<BR>
With heart and soul thy search renew.<BR>
When woes oppress and dangers threat<BR>
Brave effort ne'er was fruitless yet.'<BR>
He spoke, but R&aacute;ma gave no heed<BR>
To valiant Lakshman's prudent rede.<BR>
With double force the flood of pain<BR>
Rushed o'er his yielding soul again.<BR>
