### CANTO I.: RÁMA'S LAMENT.

The princes stood by Pampá's side <span
id="fr_524"></span>[2](#fn_524)  
Which blooming lilies glorified.  
With troubled heart and sense o'erthrown  
There Ráma made his piteous moan.  
As the fair flood before him lay  
The reason of the chief gave way;  
And tender thoughts within him woke,  
As to Sumitrá's son he spoke:  
   'How lovely Pampá's waters show,  
Where streams of lucid crystal flow!  
What glorious trees o'erhang the flood  
Which blooms of opening lotus stud!  
Look on the banks of Pampá where  
Thick groves extend divinely fair;  
And piles of trees, like hills in size.  
Lift their proud summits to the skies.  
But thought of Bharat's  <span id="fr_525"></span>[3](#fn_525) pain and
toil,  
And my dear spouse the giant's spoil,  
Afflict my tortured heart and press  
My spirit down with heaviness.  
Still fair to me though sunk in woe  
Bright Pampá and her forest show.  
Where cool fresh waters charm the sight,  
And flowers of every hue are bright,  
The lotuses in close array  
Their passing loveliness display,  
And pard and tiger, deer and snake  
Haunt every glade and dell and brake.  
Those grassy spots display the hue  
Of topazes and sapphires' blue,  
And, gay with flowers of every dye,  
With richly broidered housings vie.  
What loads of bloom the high trees crown,  
Or weigh the bending branches down!  
And creepers tipped with bud and flower  
Each spray and loaded limb o'erpower.  
Now cool delicious breezes blow,  
And kindle love's voluptuous glow,  

When balmy sweetness fills the air,  
And fruit and flowers and trees are fair.  
Those waving woods, that shine with bloom,  
Each varied tint in turn assume.  
Like labouring clouds they pour their showers  
In rain or ever-changing flowers.  
Behold, those forest trees, that stand  
High upon rock and table-land,  
As the cool gales their branches bend,  
Their floating blossoms downward send.  
See, Lakshman, how the breezes play  
With every floweret on the spray.  
And sport in merry guise with all  
The fallen blooms and those that fall.  
See, brother, where the merry breeze  
Shakes the gay boughs of flowery trees,  
Disturbed amid their toil a throng  
Of bees pursue him, loud in song.  
The Koïls, <span id="fr_526"></span>[1b](#fn_526) mad with sweet
delight,  
The bending trees to dance invite;  
And in its joy the wild wind sings  
As from the mountain cave he springs.  
On speed the gales in rapid course,  
And bend the woods beneath their force,  
Till every branch and spray they bind  
In many a tangled knot entwined.  
What balmy sweets those gales dispense  
With cool and sacred influence!  
Fatigue and trouble vanish: such  
The magic of their gentle touch.  
Hark, when the gale the boughs has bent  
In woods of honey redolent,  
Through all their quivering sprays the trees  
Are vocal with the murmuring bees.  
The hills with towering summits rise,  
And with their beauty charm the eyes,  
Gay with the giant trees which bright  
With blossom spring from every height:  
And as the soft wind gently sways  
The clustering blooms that load the sprays,  
The very trees break forth and sing  
With startled wild bees' murmuring.  
Thine eyes to yonder Cassias  <span id="fr_527"></span>[2b](#fn_527)
turn  
Whose glorious clusters glow and burn.  

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>  

Those trees in yellow robes behold,  
Like giants decked with burnished gold.  
Ah me, Sumitrá's son, the spring  
Dear to sweet birds who love and sing,  
Wakes in my lonely breast the flame  
Of sorrow as I mourn my dame.  
Love strikes me through with darts of fire,  
And wakes in vain the sweet desire.  
Hark, the loud Koïl swells his throat,  
And mocks me with his joyful note.  
I hear the happy wild-cock call  
Beside the shady waterfall.  
His cry of joy afflicts my breast  
By love's absorbing might possessed.  
My darling from our cottage heard  
One morn in spring this shrill-toned bird,  
And called me in her joy to hear  
The happy cry that charmed her ear.  
See, birds of every varied voice  
Around us in the woods rejoice,  
On creeper, shrub, and plant alight,  
Or wing from tree to tree their flight.  
Each bird his kindly mate has found,  
And loud their notes of triumph sound,  
Blending, in sweetest music like  
The distant warblings of the shrike.  
See how the river banks are lined  
With birds of every hue and kind.  
Here in his joy the Koïl sings,  
There the glad wild-cock flaps his wings.  
The bloom, of bright As'okas <span id="fr_528"></span>[1](#fn_528)
where  
The song of wild bees fills the air,  
And the soft whisper of the boughs  
Increase my longing for my spouse.  

The vernal flush of flower and spray  
Will burn my very soul away.  
What use, what care have I for life  
If I no more may see my wife  
Soft speaker with the glorious hair,  
And eyes with silken lashes fair?  
Now is the time when all day long  
The Koïls fill the woods with song.  
And gardens bloom at spring's sweet touch  
Which my beloved loved so much.  
Ah me, Sumitrá's son, the fire  
Of sorrow, sprung from soft desire.  
Fanned by the charms the spring time shows,  
Will burn my heart and end my woes,  
Whose sad eyes look on each fair tree,  
But my sweet love no more may see.  
Ah me, Ah me, from hour to hour  
Love in my soul will wax in power,  
And spring, upon whose charms I gaze,  
Whose breath the heat of toil allays,  
With thoughts of her for whom I strain  
My hopeless eyes, increase my pain.  
As fire in summer rages through  
The forests thick with dry bamboo,  
So will my fawn eyed love consume  
My soul o'erwhelmed with thoughts of gloom.  
Behold, beneath each spreading tree  
The peacoks dance  <span id="fr_529"></span>[1b](#fn_529) in frantic
glee,  
And, stirred by all the gales that blow,  
Their tails with jewelled windows glow,  
Each bird, in happy love elate,  
Rejoices with his darling mate.  
But sights like these of joy and peace  
My pangs of hopeless love increase.  
See on the mountain slope above  
The peahen languishing with love.  
Behold her now in amorous dance  
Close to her consort's side advance.  
He with a laugh of joy and pride  
Displays his glittering pinions wide;  
And follows through the tangled dell  
The partner whom he loves so well.  
Ah happy bird! no giant's hate  
Has robbed him of his tender mate;  
And still beside his loved one he  
Dances beneath the shade in glee.  
Ah, in this month when flowers are fair  
My widowed woe is hard to bear.  
See, gentle love a home may find  
In creatures of inferior kind.  
See how the peahen turns to meet  
Her consort now with love-drawn feet.  

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>  

So, Lakshman, if my large-eyed dear,  
The child of Janak still were here,  
She, by love's thrilling influence, led,  
Upon my breast would lay her head.  
These blooms I gathered from the bough  
Without my love are useless now,  
A thousand blossoms fair to see  
With passing glory clothe each tree  
That hangs its cluster-burthened head  
Now that the dewy months  <span id="fr_530"></span>[1](#fn_530) are
fled,  
But, followed by the bees that ply  
Their fragrant task, they fall and die.  
A thousand birds in wild delight  
Their rapture-breathing notes unite;  
Bird calls to bird in joyous strain,  
And turns my love to frenzied pain,  
O, if beneath those alien skies,  
There be a spring where Sítá lies,  
I know my prisoned love must be  
Touched with like grief, and mourn with me.  
But ah, methinks that dreary clime.  
Knows not the touch of spring's sweet time.  
How could my black eyed love sustain,  
Without her lord, so dire a pain?  
Or if the sweet spring come to her  
In distant lands a prisoner,  
How may his advent and her met  
On every side with taunt and threat?  
Ah, if the springtide's languor came  
With sort enchantment o'er my dame,  
My darling of the lotus eye,  
My gently speaking love, would die;  
For well my spirit knows that she  
Can never live bereft of me  
With love that never wavered yet  
My Sítá's heart, on me is set,  
Who, with a soul that ne'er can stray,  
With equal love her love repay.  
In vain, in vain the soft wind brings  
Sweet blossoms on his balmy wings;  
Delicious from his native snow,  
To me like fire he seems to glow,  
O, how I loved a breeze like this  
When darling Sítá shared the bliss!  
But now in vain for me it blows  
To fan the fury of my woes.  
That dark-winged bird that sought the skies  
Foretelling grief with warning cries,  
Sits on the tree where buds are gay,  
And pours glad music from the spray.  
That rover of the fiels of air  
Will aid my love with friendly care,  
And me with gracious pity guide  

To my large-eved Videhan's side.  <span
id="fr_531"></span>[1b](#fn_531)  
Hark, Lakshman, how the woods around  
With love-inspiring chants resound,  
Where birds in every bloom-crowned tree  
Pour forth their amorous minstrelsy.  
As though an eager gallant wooed  
A gentle maid by love subdued,  
Enamoured of her flowers the bee  
Darts at the wind-rocked Tila tree.  <span
id="fr_532"></span>[2b](#fn_532)  
As'oka, brightest tree that grows,  
That lends a pang to lovers' woes,  
Hangs out his gorgeous bloom in scorn  
And mocks me as I weep forlorn.  
O Lakshman, turn thine eye and see  
Each blossom-laden Mango tree,  
Like a young lover gaily dressed  
Whom fond desire forbids to rest  
Look, son of Queen Sumitrá through  
The forest glades of varied hue,  
Where blooms are bright and grass is green  
The Kinnars  <span id="fr_533"></span>[3b](#fn_533) with their loves are
seen.  
See, brother, see where sweet and bright  
Those crimson lotus charm the sight,  
And o'er the flood a radiance throw  
Fair as the morning's roseate glow.  
See, Pampá, most divinely sweet,  
The swan's and mallard's loved retreat,  
Shows her glad waters bright and clear,  
Where lotuses their heads uprear  
From the pure wave, and charm the view  
With mingled tints of red and blue.  
Each like the morning's early beams  
Reflected in the crystal gleams;  
And bees in their sweet toil intent  
Weigh down each tender filament  
There with gay lawns the wood recedes;  
There wildfowl sport amid the reeds,  
There roedeer stand upon the brink,  
And elephants descend to dunk.  
The rippling waves which winds make fleet  
Against the bending lilies beat,  
And opening bud and flower and stem  
Gleam with the drops that hang on them.  
Life has no pleasure left for me  
While my dear queen I may not see,  

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>  

Who loved so well those blooms that vie  
With the full splendour of her eye,  
O tyrant Love, who will not let  
My bosom for one hour forget  
The lost one whom I yearn to meet,  
Whose words were ever kind and sweet.  
Ah, haply might my heart endure  
This hopeless love that knows not cure,  
If spring with all his trees in flower  
Assailed me not with ruthless power.  
Each lovely scene, each sound and sight  
Wherein, with her. I found delight,  
Has lost the charm so sweet of yore,  
And glads my widowed heart no more.  
On lotus buds I seem to gaze,  
Or blooms that deck Palás'a  <span id="fr_534"></span>[1](#fn_534)
sprays;  
But to my tortured memory rise  
The glories of my darling's eyes.  
Cool breezes through the forest stray  
Gathering odours on their way,  
Enriched with all the rifled scent  
Of lotus flower and filament.  
Their touch upon my temples falls  
And Sitá's fragrant breath recalls.  
Now look, dear brother, on the right  
Of Pampá towers a mountain height  
Where fairest Cassia trees unfold  
The treasures of their burnished gold.  
Proud mountain king this woody side  
With myriad ores is decked and dyed,  
And as the wind-swept blossoms fall  
Their fragrant dust is stained with all.  
To yon high lands thy glances turn:  
With pendent fire they flash and burn,  
Where in their vernal glory blaze  
Palasa flowers on leafless sprays.  
O Lakshinan, look! on Pampá's side  
What fair trees rise in blooming pride!  
What climbing plants above them show  

Or hang their flowery garlands low  
See how the amorous creeper rings  
The wind-rocked trees to which she clings,  
As though a dame by love impelled  
With clasping arms her lover held.  
Drunk with the varied scents that fill  
The balmy air. from hill to hill,  
From grove to grove, from tree to tree,  
The joyous wind is wandering free.  
These gay trees wave their branches bent  
By blooms, of honey redolent.  
There, slowly opening to the day,  
Buds with dark lustre deck the spray.  
The wild bee rests a moment where  
Each tempting flower is sweet and fair,  
Then, coloured by the pollen dyes,  
Deep in some odorous blossom lies.  
Soon from his couch away he springs:  
To other trees his course he wings,  
And tastes the honeyed blooms that grow  
Where Pampá's lucid waters flow.  
See, Lakshman, see, how thickly spread  
With blossoms from the trees o'erhead,  
That grass the weary traveller woos  
With couches of a thousand hues,  
And beds on every height arrayed  
With red and yellow tints are laid,  
No longer winter chills the earth:  
A thousand flowerets spring to birth,  
And trees in rivalry assume  
Their vernal garb of bud and bloom.  
How fair they look, how bright and gay  
With tasselled flowers on every spray!  
While each to each proud challenge flings  
Borne in the song the wild bee sings.  
That mallard by the river edge  
Has bathed amid the reeds and sedge:  
Now with his mate he fondly plays  
And fires my bosom as I gaze.  
   Mandákini  <span id="fr_535"></span>[1b](#fn_535) is far renowned:  
No lovelier flood on earth is found;  
But all her fairest charms combined  
In this sweet stream enchant the mind,  
0, if my love were here to look  
With me upon this lovely brook,  
Ne'er for Ayodhyá would I pine,  
Or wish that Indra's lot were mine.  
If by my darling's side I strayed  
O'er the soft turf which decks the glade,  
Each craving thought were sweetly stilled,  
Each longing of my soul fulfilled.  
But, now my love is far away,  
Those trees which make the woods so gay,  
In all their varied beauty dressed,  
Wake thoughts of anguish in my breast.  
   That lotus-covered stream behold  
Whose waters run so fresh and cold,  

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>  

Sweet rill, the wildfowl's loved resort,  
Where curlew, swan, and diver sport;  
Where with his consort plays the drake,  
And tall deer love their thirst to slake,  
While from each woody bank is heard  
The wild note of each happy bird.  
The music of that joyous quire  
Fills all my soul with soft desire;  
And, as I hear, my sad thoughts fly  
To Sítá of the lotus eye,  
Whom, lovely with her moonbright cheek,  
In vain mine eager glances seek.  
Now turn, those chequered lawns survey  
Where hart and hind together stray.  
Ah, as they wander at their will  
My troubled breast with grief they fill,  
While torn by hopeless love I sigh  
For Sítá of the fawn-like eye.  
If in those glades where, touched by spring,  
Gay birds their amorous ditties sing,  
Mine own beloved I might see,  
Then, brother, it were well with me:  
If by my side she wandered still,  
And this cool breeze that stirs the rill  
Touched with its gentle breath the brows  
Of mine own dear Videhan spouse.  
For, Lakshman, O how blest are those  
On whom the breath of Pampá blows,  
Dispelling all their care and gloom  
With sweets from where the lilies bloom!  
How can my gentle love remain  
Alive amid the woe and pain,  
Where prisoned far away she lies,--  
My darling of the lotus eyes?  
How shall I dare her sire to greet  
Whose lips have never known deceit?  
How stand before the childless king  
And meet his eager questioning?  
When banished by my sire's decree,  
In low estate, she followed me.  
So pure, so true to every vow,  
Where is my gentle darling now?  
How can I bear my widowed lot,  
And linger on where she is not,  
Who followed when from home I fled  
Distracted, disinherited?  
My spirit sinks in hopeless pain  
When my fond glances yearn in vain  
For that dear face with whose bright eye  
The worshipped lotus scarce can vie.  
Ah when, my brother, shall I hear  
That voice that rang so soft and clear,  
When, sweetly smiling as she spoke,  
From her dear lips gay laughter broke?  
When worn with toil and love I strayed  
With Sítá through the forest shade,  
No trace of grief was seen in her,  
My kind and thoughtful comforter.  
How shall my faltering tongue relate  
To Queen Kaus'alyá Sítá's fate?  
How answer when in wild despair  

She questions, Where is Sítá, where?  
Haste, brother, haste: to Bharat hie,  
On whose fond love I still rely.  
My life can be no longer borne,  
Since Sítá from my side is torn.'  
   Thus like a helpless mourner, bent  
By sorrow, Rama made lament;  
And with wise counsel Lakshman tried  
To soothe his care, and thus replied:  
   'O best of men, thy grief oppose,  
Nor sink beneath thy weight of woes.  
Not thus despond the great and pure  
And brave like thee, but still endure.  
Reflect what anguish wrings the heart  
When loving souls are forced to part;  
And, mindful of the coming pain,  
Thy love within thy breast restrain,  
For earth, though cooled by wandering streams,  
Lies scorched beneath the midday beams,  
Rávan his steps to hell may bend,  
Or lower yet in flight descend;  
But be tbou sure, O Raghu's son,  
Avenging death he shall not shun.  
Rise, Ráma, rise: the search begin,  
And track the giant foul with sin.  
Then shall the fiend, though far he fly,  
Resign his prey or surely die.  
Yea, though the trembling monster hide  
With Sítá close to Diti's  <span id="fr_536"></span>[1](#fn_536) side,  
E'en there, unless he yield the prize,  
Slain by this wrathful hand he dies.  
Thy heart with strength and courage stay,  
And cast this weakling mood away.  
Our fainting hopes in vain revive  
Unless with firm resolve we strive.  
The zeal that fires the toiler's breast  
Mid earthly powers is first and best.  
Zeal every check and bar defies,  
And wins at length the loftiest prize,  
In woe and danger, toil and care,  
Zeal never yields to weak despair.  
With zealous heart thy task begin,  
And thou once more thy spouse shalt win.  
Cast fruitless sorrow from thy soul,  
Nor let this love thy heart control.  
Forget not all thy sacred lore,  
But be thy noble self once more.'  
    He heard, his bosom rent by grief,  
The counsel of his brother chief;  
Crushed in his heart the maddening pain,  
And rose resolved and strong again.  
Then forth upon his journey went  
The hero on his task intent,  
Nor thought of Pampá's lovely brook,  

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>  

Or trees which murmuring breezes shook,  
Though on dark woods his glances fell,  
On waterfall and cave and dell;  
And still by many a care distressed  
The son of Raghu onward pressed.  
As some wild elephant elate  
     Moves through the woods in pride,  
So Lakshman with majestic gait  
     Strode by his brother's side.  
He, for his lofty spirit famed,  
     Admonished and condoled;  
Showed Raghu's son what duty claimed,  
     And bade his heart be bold.  
Then as the brothers strode apace  
     To Rishyamúka's height,  
The sovereign of the Vánar race <span
id="fr_537"></span>[1](ry277.htm#fn_537)  
     Was troubled at the sight.  
As on the lofty hill he strayed  
     He saw the chiefs draw near:  
A while their glorious forms surveyed,  
     And mused in restless fear.  
His slow majestic step he stayed  
     And gazed upon the pair.  
And all his spirit sank dismayed  
     By fear too great to bear.  
When in their glorious might the best  
     Of royal chiefs came nigh,  
The Vánars in their wild unrest  
     Prepared to turn and fly.  
They sought the hermit's sacred home  <span
id="fr_538"></span>[2](ry277.htm#fn_538)  
     For peace and bliss ordained,  
And there, where Vánars loved to roam.  
     A sure asylum gained.

or Amaltás is a splendid tree like a giant laburnum covered with a
profusion of chains and tassels of gold. Dr. Roxburgh well describes it
as "uncommonly beautiful when in flower, few trees surpassing it in the
elegance of its numerous long pendulous racemes of large bright-yellow
flowers intermixed with the young lively green foliage." It is
remarkable also for its curious cylindrical black seed-pods about two
feet long, which are called monkeys' walking-sticks.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[320:1](ry276.htm#fr_528) "The Jonesia Asoca is
a tree of con- siderable size, native of southern India. It blossoms in
February and March with large erect compact clusters of flowers varying
in colour from pale-orange to scarlet, almost to be mistaken, on a hasty
glance, for immense trusses of bloom of an Ixora. Mr. Fortune considered
this tree, when in full bloom superior in beauty even to the Amherstia.

The first time I saw the Asoca in flower was on the hill where the
famous rock-cut temple of Kali is situated, and a large concourse of
natives had assembled for the celebration of some Hindoo festival.
Before proceeding to the temple the Mahratta women gathered from two
trees, which were flowering somewhat below, each a fine truss of
blossom, and inserted it in the hair at the back of her head.
.........As they moved about in groups it, is impossible to imagine a
more delightful effect than the rich scarlet bunches of flowers
presented on their fine glossy jet-black hair". FIRMINGER, *Gardening

that on a former occasion a crow flying high overhead was an omen that
indicated his approaching separation from Sítá; and that now the same
bird's perching on a tree near him may be regarded as a happy augury
that she will soon be restored to her husband.
