To Indrajit &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_885"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> the bold and brave<BR>
The giant king his mandate gave:<BR>
'O trained in warlike science, best<BR>
In arms of all our mightiest,<BR>
Whose valour in the conflict shown<BR>
To Asurs and to Gods is known,<BR>
The Kinkars whom I sent are slain,<BR>
And Jambum&aacute;l&iacute; and his train;<BR>
The lords who led our giant bands<BR>
Have fallen by the monkey s hands;<BR>
With shattered cars the ground is spread,<BR>
And Aksha lies amid the dead.<BR>
Thou art my best and bravest: go,<BR>
Unmatched in power, and slay the foe.'<BR>

He heard the hest: he bent his head;<BR>
Athirst for battle forth he sped.<BR>
Four tigers fierce, of tawny hue,<BR>
With fearful teeth, his chariot drew.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Han&uacute;m&aacute;n heard his strong bow clang,<BR>
And swiftly from the earth he sprang,<BR>
While weak and ineffective fell<BR>
The archer's shafts though pointed well.<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas saw that naught might kill<BR>
The wondrous foe who mocked his skill,<BR>
And launched a magic shaft to throw<BR>
A binding spell about his foe.<BR>
Forth flew the shaft: the mystic charm<BR>
Stayed his swift feet and numbed his arm.<BR>
Through all his frame he felt the spell,<BR>
And motionless to earth he fell.<BR>
Nor would the reverent V&aacute;nar loose<BR>
The bonds that bound him as a noose.<BR>
He knew that Brahm&aacute;'s self had charmed<BR>
The weapon that his might disarmed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They saw him helpless on the ground,<BR>
And all the giants pressed around,<BR>
And bonds of hemp and bark were cast<BR>
About his limbs to hold him fast.<BR>
They drew the ropes round feet and wrists;<BR>
They beat him with their hands and fists.<BR>
And dragged him as they strained the cord<BR>
With shouts of triumph to their lord. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_886"></A><A HREF="ry387.htm#fn_886"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
