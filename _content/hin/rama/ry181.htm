<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CIII.: THE FUNERAL LIBATION.</H3>
<P>
When Rama heard from Bharat each<BR>
Dark sorrow of his mournful speech,<BR>
And tidings of his father dead,<BR>
His spirits fell, his senses fled.<BR>
For the sad words his brother spoke<BR>
Struck on him like a thunder stroke.<BR>
Fierce as the bolt which Indra throws,<BR>
The victor of his Daitya foes.<BR>
Raising his arms in anguish, he,<BR>
As when the woodman hews a tree<BR>
With its fair flowery branches crowned,<BR>
Fainted and fell upon the ground.<BR>
Lord of the earth to earth he sank.<BR>
Helpless, as when a towering bank<BR>
With sudden ruin buries deep<BR>
An elephant who lay asleep.<BR>
Then swift his wife and brothers flew,<BR>
And water, weeping, o'er him threw.<BR>
As slowly sense and strength he gained,<BR>
Fast from his eyes the tears he rained,<BR>
And then in accents sad and weak<BR>
Kakutstha's son began to speak,<BR>
And mourning for the monarch dead,<BR>
With righteous words to Bharat said:<BR>
'What calls me home, when he, alas,<BR>
Has gone the way which all must pass?<BR>
Of him, the best of kings bereft<BR>
What guardian has Ayodhya left?<BR>
How may I please his spirit? how<BR>
Delight the high-souled monarch now,<BR>
Who wept for me and went above<BR>
By me ungraced with mourning love!<BR>
Ah, happy brothers! you have paid<BR>
Due offerings to his parting shade.<BR>
E'en when my banishment is o'er,<BR>
Back to my home I go no more,<BR>
To look upon the widowed state<BR>
Reft of her king, disconsolate.<BR>
E'en then, O tamer of the foe,<BR>
If to Ayodhya's town I go.<BR>
Who will direct me as of old,<BR>
Now other worlds our father hold?<BR>
From whom, my brother, shall I hear<BR>
Those words which ever charmed mine ear<BR>
And filled my bosom with delight<BR>
Whene'er he saw me act aright?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Rama spoke: then nearer came<BR>
And looking on his moonbright dame,<BR>
'Sit'a, the king is gone,' he said:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'And Lakshman, know thy sire is dead,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_212"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 212</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And with the Gods on high enrolled:<BR>
This mournful news has Bharat told.'<BR>
He spoke: the noble youths with sighs<BR>
Rained down the torrents from their eyes.<BR>
And then the brothers of the chief<BR>
With words of comfort soothed his grief:<BR>
'Now to the king our sire who swayed<BR>
The earth be due libations paid.'<BR>
Soon as the monarch's fate she knew,<BR>
Sharp pangs of grief smote Sita through:<BR>
Nor could she look upon her lord<BR>
With eyes from which the torrents poured.<BR>
And Rama strove with tender care<BR>
To soothe the weeping dame's despair,<BR>
And then, with piercing woe distressed,<BR>
The mournful Lakshman thus addressed:<BR>
'Brother, I pray thee bring for me<BR>
The pressed fruit of the Ingudi,<BR>
And a bark mantle fresh and new,<BR>
That I may pay this offering due.<BR>
First of the three shall Sita go,<BR>
Next thou, and I the last: for so<BR>
Moves the funereal pomp of woe.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_379"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sumantra of the noble mind,<BR>
Gentle and modest, meek and kind,<BR>
Who, follower of each princely youth,<BR>
To Rama clung with constant truth,<BR>
Now with the royal brothers' aid<BR>
The grief of Rama soothed and stayed,<BR>
And lent his arm his lord to guide<BR>
Down to the river's holy side.<BR>
Tnat lovely stream the heroes found,<BR>
With woods that ever blossomed crowned,<BR>
And there in bitter sorrow bent<BR>
Their footsteps down the fair descent.<BR>
Then where the stream that swiftly flowed<BR>
A pure pellucid shallow showed,<BR>
The funeral drops they duly shed,<BR>
And 'Father, this be thine,' they said.<BR>
But he, the lord who ruled the land,<BR>
Filled from the stream his hollowed hand,<BR>
And turning to the southern side<BR>
Stretched out his arm and weeping cried:<BR>
'This sacred water clear and pure,<BR>
An offering which shall aye endure<BR>
To thee, O lord of kings, I give:<BR>
Accept it where the spirits live!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, when the solemn rite was o'er,<BR>
Came Rama to the river shore,<BR>
And offered, with his brothers' aid,<BR>
Fresh tribute to his father's shade.<BR>

<P>

<P>
With jujube fruit he mixed the seed<BR>
Of Ingudis from moisture freed,<BR>
And placed it on a spot o'erspread<BR>
With sacred grass, and weeping said:<BR>
'Enjoy, great King, the cake which we<BR>
Thy children eat and offer thee!<BR>
For ne'er do blessed Gods refuse<BR>
To share the food which mortals use.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Rama turned him to retrace<BR>
The path that brought him to the place,<BR>
And up the mountain's pleasant side<BR>
Where lovely lawns lay fair, he hied.<BR>
Soon as his cottage door he gained.<BR>
His brothers to his breast he strained.<BR>
From them and Sit'a in their woes<BR>
So loud the cry of weeping rose,<BR>
That like the roar of lions round<BR>
The mountain rolled the echoing sound.<BR>
And Bharat's army shook with fear<BR>
The weeping of the chiefs to hear.<BR>
'Bharat,' the soldiers cried, ''tis plain,<BR>
His brother Rama meets again,<BR>
And with these cries that round us ring<BR>
They sorrow for their sire the king.'<BR>
Then leaving car and wain behind,<BR>
One eager thought in every mind,<BR>
Swift toward the weeping, every man,<BR>
As each could find a passage, ran.<BR>
Some thither bent their eager course<BR>
With car, and elephant, and horse,<BR>
And youthful captains on their feet<BR>
With longing sped their lord to meet,<BR>
As though the new-come prince had been<BR>
An exile for long years unseen.<BR>
Earth beaten in their frantic zeal<BR>
By clattering hoof and rumbling wheel,<BR>
Sent forth a deafening noise as loud<BR>
As heaven when black with many a cloud,<BR>
Then, with their consorts gathered near,<BR>
Wild elephants in sudden fear<BR>
Rushed to a distant wood, and shed<BR>
An odour round them as they fled.<BR>
And every silvan thing that dwelt<BR>
Within those shades the terror felt,<BR>
Deer, lion, tiger, boar and roe,<BR>
Bison, wild-cow, and buffalo.<BR>
And when the tumult wild they heard.<BR>
With trembling pinions flew each bird,<BR>
From tree, from thicket, and from lake,<BR>
Swan, koil, curlew, crane, and drake.<BR>
With men the ground was overspread,<BR>
With startled birds the sky o'erhead.<BR>
Then on his sacrificial ground<BR>
The sinless, glorious chief was found.<BR>
Loading with curses deep and loud<BR>
The hump-back and the queen, the crowd.<BR>
Whose checks were wet, whose eyes were dim,<BR>
In fond affection ran to him.<BR>
While the big tears their eyes bedewed,<BR>
He looked upon the multitude,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_213"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 213</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And then as sire and mother do,<BR>
His arms about his loved ones threw.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Some to his feet with reverence pressed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Some in his arms he strained:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each friend, with kindly words addressed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Due share of honour gained.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, by their mighty woe o'ercome,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The weeping heroes' cry<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Filled, like the roar of many a drum,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Hill, cavern, earth, and sky.<BR>
