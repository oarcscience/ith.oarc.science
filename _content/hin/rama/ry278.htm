<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO IV: LAKSHMAN'S REPLY.</H3>
<P>
Cheered by the words that R&aacute;ma spoke,<BR>
Joy in the V&aacute;nar's breast awoke,<BR>
And, as his friendly mood he knew,<BR>
His thoughts to King Sugriva flew:<BR>
' Again,' he mused,'my high-sou'ed lord<BR>
Shall rule, to kingly state restored;<BR>
Since one so mighty comes to save,<BR>
And freely gives the help we crave."<BR>
Then joyous Hanum&aacute;n, the best<BR>
Of all the V&aacute;nar kind, addressed<BR>
These words to R&aacute;ma, trained of yore<BR>
In all the arts of speakers' lore: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_550"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
'Why do your feet this forest tread<BR>
By silvan life inhabited,<BR>
This awful maze of tree and thorn<BR>
Which Pamp&aacute;'s flowering groves adorn?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke: obedient to the eye<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma Lakshman made reply,<BR>
The name and fortune to unfold<BR>
Of Raghu's son the lofty-souled:<BR>
'True to the law, of fame unstained,<BR>
The glorious Das'aratha reigned.<BR>
And, steadfast in his duty, long<BR>
Kept the four castes &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_551"></A><A HREF="#fn_551"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>from scathe and wrong.<BR>
Through his wide realm his will was done,<BR>
And, loved by all, he hated none.<BR>
Just to each creature great and small,<BR>
Like the Good Sire he cared for all.<BR>
The Agnishtom,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> as priests advised,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And various rites he solemnized.<BR>
Where ample largess ever paid<BR>
The Brahmans for their holy aid.<BR>
Here R&aacute;ma stands, his heir by birth,<BR>
Whose name is glorious in the earth:<BR>
Sure refuge he of all oppressed,<BR>
Most faithful to his sire's behest.<BR>
He, Das'aratha's eldest born<BR>
Whom gifts above the rest adorn,<BR>
Lord of each high imperial sign, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
The glory of his kingly line,<BR>
Reft of his right, expelled from home,<BR>
Came forth with me the woods to roam,<BR>
And Sit&aacute; too, his faithful dame,<BR>
Forth with her virtuous husband came,<BR>
Like the sweet light when day is done<BR>
Still cleaving to her lord the sun.<BR>
And me his sweet perfections drew<BR>
To follow as his servant true.<BR>
Named Lakshman, brother of my lord<BR>
Of grateful heart with knowledge stored<BR>
Most meet is he all bliss to share,<BR>
Who makes the good of all his care.<BR>
While, power and lordship caat away,<BR>
In the wild wood he chose to stay,<BR>
A giant came,--his name unknown,--<BR>
And stole the princess left alone.<BR>
Then Dit&iacute;'s son &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> who, cursed of yore.<BR>
The semblance of a Rakshas wore,<BR>
To King Sugr&iacute;va bade us turn<BR>
The robber's name and home to learn.<BR>
For he, the V&aacute;nar chief, would know<BR>
The dwelling of our secret foe.<BR>
Such words of hope spake Dit&iacute;'s son,<BR>
And sought the heaven his deeds had won.<BR>
Thou hast my tale. From first to last<BR>
Thine ears have heard whate'er has past.<BR>
Rama the mighty lord and I<BR>
For refuge to Sugr&iacute;va fly.<BR>
The prince whose arm bright glory gained.<BR>
O'er the whole earth as monarch reigned,<BR>
And richest gifts to others gave,<BR>
Is come Sugr&iacute;va's help to crave;<BR>
Son of a king the surest friend<BR>
Of virtue, him who loved to lend<BR>
His succour to the suffering weak,<BR>
Is come Sugr&iacute;va's aid to seek.<BR>
Yes, Raghu's son whose matchless hand<BR>
Protected all this sea-girt land,<BR>
The virtuous prince, my holy guide,<BR>
For refuge seeks Sugr&iacute;va's side.<BR>
His favour sent on great and small<BR>
Should ever save and prosper all.<BR>
He now to win Sugr&iacute;va's grace<BR>
Has sought his woodland dwelling-place.<BR>

Son of a king of glorious fame;--<BR>
Who knows not Das'aratha's name?--<BR>
From whom all princes of the earth<BR>
Received each honour due to worth;--<BR>
Heir of that best of earthly kings,<BR>
R&aacute;ma the prince whose glory rings<BR>
Through realms below and earth and skies,<BR>
For refuge to Sugr&iacute;va flies.<BR>
Nor should the V&aacute;nar king refuse<BR>
The boon for which the suppliant sues,<BR>
But with his forest legions speed<BR>
To save him in his utmost need.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sumitr&aacute;'s son, his eyes bedewed<BR>
With piteous tears, thus sighed and sued.<BR>
Then, trained in all the arts that guide<BR>
The speaker, Hanum&aacute;n replied:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Yea, lords like you of wisest thought,<BR>
Whom happy fate has hither brought,<BR>
Who vanquish ire and rule each sense,<BR>
Must of our lord have audience.<BR>
Reft of his kingdom, sad, forlorn,<BR>
Once B&aacute;li's hate now B&aacute;li's scorn,<BR>
Defeated, severed from his spouse,<BR>
Wandering under forest boughs,<BR>
Child of the Sun, our lord and king<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va will his succours bring,<BR>
And all our V&aacute;nar hosts combined<BR>
Will trace the dame you long to find.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With gentle tone and winning grace<BR>
Thus spake the chief of V&aacute;nar race,<BR>
And then to Raghu's son he cried:<BR>
'Come, haste we to Sugriv&aacute;'s side.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke, and for his words so sweet<BR>
Good Lakshman' paid all honour meet;<BR>
Then turned and cried to Raghu's son:<BR>
'Now deem thy task already done,<BR>
Because this chief of V&aacute;nar kind,<BR>
Son of the God who rules the wind,<BR>
Declares Sugr&iacute;va's self would be<BR>
Assisted in his need by thee.<BR>
Bright gleams of joy his cheek o'erspread<BR>
As each glad word of hope he said;<BR>
And ne'er will one so valiant deign<BR>
To cheer our hearts with hope in vain.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke, and Han&uacute;m&aacute;n the wise<BR>
Cast off his mendicant disguise,<BR>
And took again his V&aacute;nar form,<BR>
Son of the God of wind and storm.<BR>
High on his ample back in haste<BR>
Baghu's heroic sons he placed.<BR>
And turned with rapid steps to find<BR>
The sovereign of the V&aacute;nar kind.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_550"></A><A HREF="ry278.htm#fr_550">327:1</A>  "In our own metrical romances, or
wherever a poem is meant not for readers
but for chanters and oral reciters, these
<I>formulae</I>, to meet the same recurring case,
exist by scores. Thus every woman in
these metrical romances who happens to
be young, is described as "so bright of ble,"
or complexion; always a man goes "the
mountenance of a mule" before he overtakes
or is overtaken. And so on through.
a vast bead-roll of cases. In the same
spirit Homer has his eternal &#0948&#8125&#0945&#8164
&#8017&#0960&#0959&#0948&#0961&#0945 &#0953&#0948&#0969&#0957, or &#0964&#0959&#0957 &#0948&#8125&#0945&#0960&#0945&#0956&#0949&#0953&#0946&#0959&#0956&#0949&#0957&#0959&#0962
&#0960&#0961&#0959&#0963&#0949&#0966&#0951, &c.

<P>
To a reader of sensibility, such recurrences
wear an air of child-like simplicity,
beautifully recalling the features of
Homer's primitive age. But they would have
appeared faults to all commonplace critics
in literary ages."
