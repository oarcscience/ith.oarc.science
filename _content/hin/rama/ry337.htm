'As to the saint I thus complained<BR>
My bitter tears fell unrestrained.<BR>
He pondered for a while, then broke<BR>
The silence, and thus calmly spoke:<BR>
'Forth from thy sides again shall spring,<BR>
O royal bird, each withered wing,<BR>
And all thine ancient power and might<BR>
Return to thee with strength of sight.<BR>
A noble deed has been foretold<BR>
In prophecy pronounced of old:<BR>
Nor dark to me are future things,<BR>
Seen by the light which penance brings.<BR>
A glorious king shall rise and reign,<BR>
The pride of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's strain.<BR>
A good and valiant prince, his heir,<BR>
Shall the dear name of R&aacute;ma bear.<BR>
With his brave brother Lakshman he<BR>
An exile in the woods shall be,<BR>
Where R&aacute;van, whom no God may slay, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_779"></A><A HREF="ry338.htm#fn_779"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Shall steal his darling wife away,<BR>
In vain the captive will be wooed<BR>
With proffered love and dainty food,<BR>
She will not hear, she will not taste:<BR>
But, lest her beauty wane and waste,<BR>
Lord Indra's self will come to her<BR>
With heavenly food, and minister.<BR>
Then envoys of the V&aacute;nar race<BR>
By R&aacute;ma sent will seek this place.<BR>
To them, O roamer of the air,<BR>
The lady's fate shalt thou declare.<BR>
Thou must not move--so maimed thou art<BR>
Thou canst not from this spot depart.<BR>
Await the day and moment due,<BR>
And thy burnt wings will sprout anew.<BR>
I might this day the boon bestow<BR>
And bid again thy pinions grow,<BR>
But wait until thy saving deed<BR>
The nations from their fear have freed.<BR>
Then for this glorious aid of thine<BR>
The princes of Ikshv&aacute;ku's line,<BR>
And Gods above and saints below<BR>
Eternal gratitude shall owe.<BR>
Fain would mine aged eyes behold<BR>
That pair of whom my lips have told,<BR>
Yet wearied here I must not stay,<BR>
But leave my frame and pass away.'<BR>
