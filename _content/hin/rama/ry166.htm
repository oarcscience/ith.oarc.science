<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXXVIII.: THE INGUD&Iacute; TREE.</H3>
<P>
When Bharat with each friend and peer<BR>
Had heard that tale so full and clear,<BR>
They went together to the tree<BR>
The bed which R&aacute;ma pressed to see.<BR>
Then Bharat to his mothers said:<BR>
'Behold the high-souled hero's bed:<BR>
These tumbled heaps of grass betray<BR>
Where he that night with Sit&aacute; lay:<BR>
Unmeet, the heir of fortune high<BR>
Thus on the cold bare earth should lie,<BR>
The monarch's son, in counsel sage,<BR>
Of old imperial lineage.<BR>
That lion-lord whose noble bed<BR>
With finest skins of deer was spread,--<BR>
How can he now endure to press<BR>
The bare earth, cold and comfortless!<BR>
This sudden fall from bliss to grief<BR>
Appears untrue, beyond belief:<BR>
My senses are distraught: I seem<BR>
To view the fancies of a dream.<BR>
There is no deity so great,<BR>
No power in heaven can master Fate,<BR>
If R&aacute;ma, Das'aratha's heir,<BR>
Lay on the ground and slumbered there;<BR>
And lovely Sit&aacute;, she who springs<BR>
From fair Videha's ancient kings,<BR>

<P>

<P>
R&aacute;ma's dear wife, by all adored,<BR>
Lay on the earth beside her lord.<BR>
Here was his couch, upon this heap<BR>
He tossed and turned in restless sleep:<BR>
On the hard soil each manly limb<BR>
Has stamped the grass with signs of him,<BR>
That night, it seems, fair Sit&aacute; spent<BR>
Arrayed in every ornament,<BR>
For here and there my eyes behold<BR>
Small particles of glistering gold.<BR>
She laid her outer garment here,<BR>
For still some silken threads appear,<BR>
How dear in her devoted eyes<BR>
Must be the bed where R&aacute;ma lies,<BR>
Where she so tender could repose<BR>
And by his side forget her woes.<BR>
Alas, unhappy, guilty me!<BR>
For whom the prince was forced to flee,<BR>
And chief of Raghu's sons and best,<BR>
A bed like this with Sit&aacute; pressed.<BR>
Son of a royal sire whose hand<BR>
Ruled paramount o'er every land,<BR>
Could he who every joy bestows,<BR>
Whose body like the lotus shows,<BR>
The friend of all, who charms the sight,<BR>
Whose flashing eyes are darkly bright.<BR>
Leave the dear kingdom, his by right,<BR>
Unmeet for woe, the heir of bliss,<BR>
And lie upon a bed like this?<BR>
Great joy and happy fate are thine,<BR>
O Lakshman, marked with each fair sign,<BR>
Whose faithful footsteps follow still<BR>
Thy brother in his hour of ill.<BR>
And blest is Sit&aacute;, nobly good,<BR>
Who dwells with R&aacute;ma in the wood.<BR>
Ours is, alas, a doubtful fate<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma reft and desolate.<BR>
My royal sire has gained the skies,<BR>
In woods the high-souled hero lies;<BR>
The state is wrecked and tempest-tossed,<BR>
A vessel with her rudder lost.<BR>
Yet none in secret thought has planned<BR>
With hostile might to seize the land:<BR>
Though forced in distant wilds to dwell,<BR>
The hero's arm protects it well.<BR>
Unguarded, with deserted wall,<BR>
No elephant or steed in stall,<BR>
My father's royal city shows<BR>
Her portals open to her foes,<BR>
Of bold protectors reft and bare,<BR>
Defenceless in her dark despair:<BR>
But still her foes the wish restrain,<BR>
As men from poisoned cates refrain.<BR>
I from this hour my nights will pass<BR>
Couched on the earth or gathered grass,<BR>
Eat only fruit and roots, and wear<BR>
A coat of bark, and matted hair.<BR>
I in the woods will pass, content,<BR>
For him the term of banishment;<BR>
So shall I still unbroken save<BR>
The promise which the hero gave.<BR>

<P>
While I remain for R&aacute;ma there,<BR>
S'atrnghna will my exile share,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma in his home again,<BR>
With Lakshman, o'er Ayodhy&aacute; reign,<BR>
for him, to rule and guard the state,<BR>
The twice-born men shall consecrate.<BR>
O, may the Gods I serve incline<BR>
To grant this earnest wish of mine!<BR>
If when I bow before his feet<BR>
And with all moving arts entreat,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He still deny my prayer,<BR>
Then with my brother will I live:<BR>
He must, he must permission give,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Roaming in forests there.'<BR>
