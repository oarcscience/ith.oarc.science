### CANTO LXVIII.: RÁVAN'S LAMENT.

They ran to Rávan in his hall  
And told him of his brother's fall:  
'Fierce as the God who rules the dead,  
Upon the routed foe he fed;  
And, victor for a while, at length  
Fell slain by Ráma's matchless strength,  
Now like a mighty hill in size  
His mangled trunk extended lies,  
And where he fell, a bleeding mass,  
Blocks Lanká's gate tbat none may pass.'  
The monarch heard: his strength gave way;  
And fainting on the ground he lay.  
Grieved at the giants' mournful tale,  
Long, shrill was Atikáya's wail;  
Aud Tris'iras in sorrow bowed  
His triple head, and wept aloud,  
Mahodar, Mahápárs'va shed  
Hot tears and mourned their brother dead.  
At length, his wandering sense restored,  
In loud lament cried Lanká's lord:  

Ah chief, for might and valour famed,  
Whose arm the haughty foeman tamed,  
Forsaking me, thy friends and all,  
Why hast thou fled to Yama's hall?  
Why hast thou fled to taste no more  
The slaughtered foeman's flesh and gore?  
Ah me, my life is done to-day:  
My better arm is lopped away.  
Whereon in danger I relied,  
And, fearless, Gods and fiends defied.  
How could a shaft from Ráma's bow  
The matchless giant overthrow,  
Whose iron frame so strong of yore  
The crushing bolt of Indra bore?  
This day the Gods and sages meet  
And triumph at their foe's defeat.  
This day the Vánar chiefs will boast  
And, with new ardour fired, their host  
In fiercer onset will assail  
Our city, and the ramparts scale.  
What care I for a monarch's name,  
For empire, or the Maithil dame?  
What joy can power and riches give,  
Or life that I should care to live,  
Unless this arm in mortal fray  
The slayer of my brother slay?  
For me, of Kumbhakarna reft,  
Death is the only solace left;  
And I will seek, o'erwhelmed with woes,  
The realm to which my brother goes.  
Ah me ill-minded, not to take  
His counsel when Vibhíshan spake  
When he this evil day foretold  
My foolish heart was overbold:  
I drove my sage adviser hence,  
And reap the fruits of mine offence.'
