<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, speeding through the skies,<BR>
Bent on the earth his eager eyes:<BR>
'Look, S&iacute;t&aacute;, see, divinely planned<BR>
And built by Vis'vakarm&aacute;'s hand,<BR>
Lank&aacute; the lovely city rest<BR>
Enthroned on Mount Trik&uacute;ta's crest<BR>
Behold those fields, ensanguined yet,<BR>
Where V&aacute;nar hosts and giants met.<BR>
There, vainly screened by charm and spell,<BR>
The robber R&aacute;van fought and fell.<BR>
There knelt Mandodari &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1044"></A><A HREF="#fn_1044"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and shed<BR>
Her tears in floods for R&aacute;van dead.<BR>
And every dame who loved him sent<BR>

<P>

<P>
From her sad heart her wild lament.<BR>
There gleams the margin of the deep,<BR>
Where, worn with toil, we sank to sleep.<BR>
Look, love, the unconquered sea behold,<BR>
King Varun's home ordained of old,<BR>
Whose boundless waters roar and swell<BR>
Rich with their store of pearl and shell.<BR>
O see, the morning sun is bright<BR>
On fair Hiranyan&aacute;bha's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1045"></A><A HREF="#fn_1045"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> height,<BR>
Who rose from Ocean's sheltering breast<BR>
That Hanum&aacute;n might stay and rest.<BR>
There stretches, famed for evermore,<BR>
The wondrous bridge from shore to shore.<BR>
The worlds, to life's remotest day.<BR>
Due reverence to the work shall pay,<BR>
Which holier for the laps of time<BR>
Shall give release from sin and crime.<BR>
Now thither bend, dear love, thine eyes<BR>
Where green with groves Kishkindh&aacute; lies,<BR>
The seat of King Sugr&iacute;va's reign,<BR>
Where B&aacute;li by this hand was slain. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1046"></A><A HREF="#fn_1046"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
There R&iacute;shyam&uacute;ka's hill behold<BR>
Bright gleaming with embedded gold.<BR>
There too my wandering foot I set,<BR>
There King Sugr&iacute;va first I met.<BR>
And, where yon trees their branches wave,<BR>
My promise of assistance gave.<BR>
There, flushed with lilies, Pamp&aacute; shines<BR>
With banks which greenest foliage lines,<BR>
Where melancholy steps I bent<BR>
And mourned thee with a mad lament.<BR>
There fierce Kabandha, spreading wide<BR>
His giant arms, in battle died.<BR>
Turn, S&iacute;t&aacute;, turn thine eyes and see<BR>
In Janasth&aacute;n that glorious tree:<BR>
There R&aacute;van, lord of giants slew<BR>
Our friend Jat&aacute;yas brave and true,<BR>
Thy champion in the hopless* strife,<BR>
Who gave for thee his noble life.<BR>
Now mark that glade amid the trees<BR>
Where once we lived as devotees.<BR>
See, see our leafy cot between<BR>
Those waving boughs of densest green,<BR>
Where R&aacute;van seized his prize and stole<BR>
My love the darling of my soul.<BR>
O, look again: beneath thee gleams<BR>
God&aacute;vari the best of streams,<BR>
Whose lucid waters sweetly glide<BR>
By lilies that adorn her side.<BR>
There dwelt Agastya, holy sage,<BR>
In plantain-sheltered hermitage.<BR>
See S'arabhanga's humble shed<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_503"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 503</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Which sovereign Indra visited.<BR>
See where the gentle hermits dwell<BR>
Neath Atri's rule who loved us well;<BR>
Where once thine eyes were blest to see<BR>
His sainted dame who talked with thee.<BR>
Now rest thine eyes with new delight<BR>
On Chitrak&uacute;ta's woody height,<BR>
See Jumna flashing in the sun<BR>
Through groves of brilliant foliage run.<BR>
Screened by the shade of spreading boughs<BR>
There Bharadv&aacute;ja keeps his vows,<BR>
There Gang&aacute;, river of the skies,<BR>
Bolls the sweet wave that purifies,<BR>
There S'ringavera's towers ascend<BR>
Where Guha reigns, mine ancient friend.<BR>
I see, I see thy glittering spires,<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;, city of my sires.<BR>
Bow down, bow down thy head, my sweet,<BR>
Our home, our long-lost home to greet.'<BR>
