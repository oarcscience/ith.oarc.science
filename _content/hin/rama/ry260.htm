<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXII.: R&Aacute;MA'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
When all the toil and search was vain<BR>
He sought, his leafy home again.<BR>
'Twas empty still: all scattered lay<BR>
The seats of grass in disarray.<BR>
He raised his shapelv arms on high<BR>
And spoke aloud with bitter cry:<BR>
'Where is the Ma&iacute;thil dame?' he said,<BR>
'O, whither has my darling fled?<BR>
Who can have borne away my dame,<BR>
Or feasted on her tender frame?<BR>
If, S&iacute;t&aacute; hidden by some tree,<BR>
Thou joyest still to mock at me,<BR>
Cease, cease thy cruel sport, and take<BR>
Compassion, or my heart will break.<BR>
Bethink thee, love, the gentle fawns<BR>
With whom thou playest on the lawns,<BR>
Impatient for thy coming wait<BR>
With streaming eyes disconsolate.<BR>
Reft of my love. I needs must go<BR>
Hence to the shades weighed down by woe.<BR>
The king our sire will see me there,<BR>
And cry, 'O perjured R&aacute;ma, where.<BR>
Where is thy faith, that thou canst speed<BR>
From exile ere the time decreed?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ah S&iacute;t&aacute;, whither hast thou fled<BR>
And left me here disquieted,<BR>
A hapless mourner, reft of hone.<BR>
Too feeble with my woe to cope?<BR>
E'en thus indignant Glory flies<BR>
The wretch who stains his soul with lies.<BR>
If thou, my love, art lost to view,<BR>
I in my woe must perish too.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Rama by big grief distraught<BR>
Wept for the wife he vainly sought.<BR>
And Lakshman whose fraternal breast<BR>
Longed for his weal, the chief addressed<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_302"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 302</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Whose soul gave way beneath the pain<BR>
When all his eager search was vain.<BR>
Like some great elephant who stands<BR>
Sinking upon the treacherous sands:<BR>
'Not yet, O wisest chief, despair;<BR>
Renew thy toil with utmost care.<BR>
This noble hill where trees are green<BR>
Has many a cave and dark ravine.<BR>
The Maithil lady day by day<BR>
Delighted in the woods to stray.<BR>
Deep in the grove she wanders still.<BR>
Or walks by blossom-covered rill,<BR>
Or fish-loved river stealing through<BR>
Tall clusters of the dark bamboo.<BR>
Or else the dame with arch design<BR>
To prove thy mood, O Prince, and mine,<BR>
Far in some sheltering thicket lies<BR>
To frighten ere she meet our eyes.<BR>
Then come, renew thy labour, trace<BR>
The lady to her lurking-place,<BR>
And search the wood from side to aide<BR>
To know where Sit&aacute; loves to bide.<BR>
Collect thy thoughts, O royal chief,<BR>
Nor yield to unavailing grief.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Lakshman, by attention stirred,<BR>
To fresh attempts his brother spurred,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, as he ceased, began<BR>
With Lakshman's aid each spot to scan.<BR>
In eager search their way they took<BR>
Through wood, o'er hill, by pool and brook,<BR>
They roamed each mount, nor spared to seek<BR>
On ridge and crag and towering peak.<BR>
They sought the dame in every spot;<BR>
But all in vain; they found her not.<BR>
Above, below, on every side<BR>
They ranged the hill, and R&aacute;ma cried,<BR>
'O Lakshman, O my brother still<BR>
No trace of S&iacute;t&aacute; on'the hill!'<BR>
Then Lakshman as he roamed the wood<BR>
Beside his glorious brother stood,<BR>
And while fierce grief his bosom burned<BR>
This answer to the chief retained:<BR>
'Thou, R&aacute;ma, after toil and pain<BR>
Wilt meet the Maithil dame again,<BR>
As Vishnu, Buli's might subdued,<BR>
His empire of the earth renewed.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma cried in mournful tone,<BR>
His spirit by his woe o'erthrown;<BR>
'The wood is searched from side to side,<BR>
No distant spot remains untried,<BR>
No lilied pool, no streamlet where<BR>
The lotus buds are fresh and fair.<BR>
Our eyes have searched the hill with all<BR>
His caves and every waterfall,--<BR>
But ah, not yet I find my wife,<BR>
More precious than the breath of life.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As thus he mourned his vanished dame<BR>
A mighty trembling seized his frame,<BR>

<P>

<P>
And by o'erpowering grief assailed,<BR>
His troubled senses reeled and failed.<BR>
Too great to bear his misery grew,<BR>
And many a long hot sigh he drew,<BR>
Then as he wept and sobbed and sighed,<BR>
"O Sita, O my love!' he cried.<BR>
Then Lakshman, joining palm to palm,<BR>
Tried every art his woe to calm.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma in his anguish heard<BR>
Or heeded not one soothing word.<BR>
Still for his spouse he mourned, and shrill<BR>
Rang out his lamentation still,<BR>
