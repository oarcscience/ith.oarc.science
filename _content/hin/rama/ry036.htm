<P>
'A king of Brahm&aacute;'s seed who bore<BR>
The name of Kus'a reigned of yore.<BR>
Just, faithful to his vows, and true,<BR>
He held the good in honour due.<BR>
His bride, a queen of noble name.<BR>
Of old Vidarbha's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> monarchs came.<BR>
Like their own father, children four,<BR>
All valiant boys, the lady bore.<BR>
In glorious deeds each nerve they strained,<BR>
And well their Warrior part sustained.<BR>
To them most just, and true, and brave,<BR>
Their father thus his counsel gave:<BR>
"Beloved children, ne'er forget<BR>
Protection is a prince's debt:<BR>
The noble work at once begin,<BR>
High virtue and her fruits to win."<BR>
The youths to all the people dear,<BR>
Received his speech with willing ear;<BR>
And each went forth his several way,<BR>
Foundations of a town to lay.<BR>
Kus'&aacute;n, a prince of high renown,<BR>
Was builder of Kaus'&aacute;mb&iacute;'s town,<BR>
And Kus'an&aacute;bha, just and wise,<BR>
Bade high Mahodaya's towers arise.<BR>
Am&uacute;rtarajas chose to dwell<BR>
In Dharm&aacute;ranya's citadel,<BR>
And Vasu bade his city fair<BR>
The name of Girivraja bear.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
This fertile spot whereon we stand<BR>
Was once the high-souled Vasu's land.<BR>
Behold! as round we turn our eyes,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Five lofty mountain peaks arise.<BR>
See! bursting from her parent hill,<BR>
Sum&aacute;gadhi, a lovely rill,<BR>
Bright gleaming as she flows between<BR>
The mountains, like a wreath is seen,<BR>
And then through Magadh's plains and groves<BR>
With many a fair m&aelig;ander roves.<BR>
And this was Vasu's old domain,<BR>
The fertile Magadh's broad champaign,<BR>
Which smiling fields of tilth adorn<BR>
And diadem with golden corn.<BR>

<P>
The queen Ghr&iacute;t&aacute;ch&iacute;, nymph most fair,<BR>
Married to Kus'an&aacute;bha, bare<BR>
A hundred daughters, lovely-faced,<BR>
With every charm and beauty graced.<BR>
It chanced the maidens, bright and gay<BR>
As lightning-flashes on a day<BR>
Of rain time, to the garden went<BR>
With song and play and merriment,<BR>
And there in gay attire they strayed,<BR>
And danced, and laughed, and sang, and played.<BR>
The God of Wind who roves at will<BR>
All places, as he lists, to fill,<BR>
Saw the young maidens dancing there,<BR>
Of faultless shape and mien most fair,<BR>
'I love you all, sweet girls,' he cried,<BR>
And each shall be my darling bride.<BR>
Forsake, forsake your mortal lot,<BR>
And gain a life that withers not.<BR>
A fickle thing is youth's brief span,<BR>
And more than all in mortal man.<BR>
Receive unending youth, and be<BR>
Immortal, O my loves, with me.'<BR>

<P>
The hundred girls, to wonder stirred,<BR>
The wooing of the Wind-God heard,<BR>
Laughed, as a jest, his suit aside,<BR>
And with one voice they thus replied.<BR>
'O mighty Wind, free spirit who<BR>
All life pervadest, through and through,<BR>
Thy wondrous power we maidens know;<BR>
Then wherefore wilt thou mock us so?<BR>
Our sire is Kus'an&aacute;bha, King;<BR>
And we, forsooth, have charms to bring<BR>
A God to woo us from the skies;<BR>
But honour first we maidens prize.<BR>
Far may the hour, we pray, be hence,<BR>
When we, O thou of little sense,<BR>
Our truthful father's choice refuse,<BR>
And for ourselves our husbands choose.<BR>
Our honoured sire our lord we deem,<BR>
He is to us a God supreme,<BR>
And they to whom his high decree<BR>
May give us shall our husbands be.'<BR>

<P>
He heard the answer they returned,<BR>
And mighty rage within him burned.<BR>
On each fair maid a blast he sent:<BR>
Each stately form be bowed and bent.<BR>
Bent double by the Wind-God's ire<BR>
Tliey sought the palace of their sire,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
There fell upon the ground with sighs,<BR>
While tears and shame were in their eyes.<BR>
The king himself, with troubled brow,<BR>
Saw his dear girls so fair but now,<BR>
A mournful sight all bent and bowed,<BR>
And grieving thus he cried aloud:<BR>
'What fate is this, and what the cause!<BR>
What wretch has scorned all heavenly laws?<BR>
Who thus your forms could curve and break?<BR>
You struggle, but no answer make.'<BR>

<P>
They heard the speech of that wise king<BR>
Of their misfortune questioning.<BR>
Again the hundred maidens sighed,<BR>
Touched with their heads his feet, and cried;<BR>
'The God of Wind, pervading space,<BR>
Would bring on us a foul disgrace,<BR>
And choosing folly's evil way<BR>
From virtue's path in scorn would stray.<BR>
But we in words like these reproved<BR>
The God of Wind whom passion moved:<BR>
'Farewell, O Lord! A sire have we,<BR>
No women uncontrolled and free.<BR>
Go, and our sire's consent obtain<BR>
If thou our maiden hands wouldst gain.<BR>
No self-dependent life we live:<BR>
If we offend, our fault forgive.'<BR>
'But led by folly as a slave,<BR>
He would not hear the rede we gave,<BR>
And even as we gently spoke<BR>
We felt the Wind-God's crushing stroke.'<BR>

<P>
The pious king, with grief distressed,<BR>
The noble hundred thus addressed:<BR>
'With patience, daughters, bear your fate,<BR>
Yours was a deed supremely great<BR>
When with one mind you kept from shame<BR>
The honour of your father's name.<BR>
Patience, when men their anger vent,<BR>
Is woman's praise and ornament;<BR>
Yet when the Gods inflict the blow<BR>
Hard is it to support the woe.<BR>
Patience, my girls, exceeds all price:<BR>
'Tis alms, and truth, and sacrifice.<BR>
Patience is virtue, patience fame:<BR>
Patience upholds this earthly frame.<BR>
And now, I think, is come the time<BR>
To wed you in jour maiden prime.<BR>
Now, daughters, go where'er you will:<BR>
Thoughts for your good my mind shall fill.'<BR>

<P>
The maidens went, consoled, away:<BR>
The best of kings, that very day,<BR>
Summoned his ministers of state<BR>
About their marriage to debate.<BR>
Since then, because the Wind-God bent<BR>
The damsels' forms for punishment,<BR>
That royal town is known to fame<BR>
By Kany&aacute;kubja's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> borrowed name.<BR>


<P>


<P>
There lived a sage called Ch&uacute;li then,<BR>
Devoutest of the sons of men;<BR>
His days in penance rites he spent,<BR>
A glorious saint, most continent.<BR>
To him absorbed in tasks austere<BR>
The child of Urmil&aacute; drew near,<BR>
Sweet Somad&aacute;, the heavenly maid,<BR>
And lent the saint her pious aid.<BR>
Long time near him the maiden spent,<BR>
And served him meek and reverent,<BR>
Till the great hermit, pleased with her,<BR>
Thus spoke unto his minister:<BR>
'Grateful am I for all thy care:<BR>
Blest maiden, speak, thy wish declare.'<BR>
The sweet-voiced nymph rejoiced to see<BR>
The favour of the devotee,<BR>
And to that eloquent old man,<BR>
Most eloquent she thus began:<BR>
'Thou hast, by heavenly grace sustained,<BR>
Close union with the Godhead gained.<BR>
I long, O Saint, to see a son<BR>
By force of holy penance won.<BR>
Unwed, a maiden life I live:<BR>
A son to me, thy suppliant, give.'<BR>
The saint with favour heard her prayer,<BR>
And gave a son exceeding fair.<BR>
Him, Ch&uacute;li's spiritual child,<BR>
His mother Brahmadatta &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> styled.<BR>
King Brahmadatta, rich and great,<BR>
In K&aacute;mpil&iacute; maintained his state,<BR>
Ruling, like Indra in his bliss,<BR>
His fortunate metropolis.<BR>
King Kus'an&aacute;bha planned that he<BR>
His hundred daughters' lord should be.<BR>
To him, obedient to his call,<BR>
The happy monarch gave them all.<BR>
Like Indra then he took the hand<BR>
Of every maiden of the band.<BR>
Soon as the hand of each young maid<BR>
In Brahmadatta's palm was laid,<BR>
Deformity and cares away,<BR>
She shone in beauty bright and gay.<BR>
Their freedom from the Wind-God's might<BR>
Saw Kus'an&aacute;bha with delight.<BR>
Each glance that on their forms he threw<BR>
Filled him with raptures ever new.<BR>
Then when the rites were all complete,<BR>
Witli highest marks of honour meet<BR>
The bridegroom with his brides he sent<BR>
To his great seat of government.<BR>

<P>
The nymph received with pleasant speech<BR>
Her daughters; and, embracing each,<BR>
Upon their forms she fondly gazed,<BR>
And royal Kus'an&aacute;bha praised.<BR>
