### CANTO XXV.: SÍTÁ'S LAMENT.

On the bare earth the lady sank,  
And trembling from their presence shrank  
Like a strayed fawn, when night is dark,  
And hungry wolves around her bark.  

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>  

Then to a shady tree she crept,  
And thought upon her lord and wept.  
By fear and bitter woe oppressed  
She bathed the beauties of her breast  
With her hot tears' incessant flow,  
And found no respite from her woe.  
As shakes a plantain in the breeze  
She shook, and fell on trembling knees;  
While at each demon's furious look  
Her cheek its native hue forsook.  
She lay and wept and made her moan  
In sorrow's saddest undertone,  
And, wild with grief, with fear appalled,  
On Ráma and his brother called:  
'O dear Kaus'alyá, <span id="fr_847"></span>[1](ry368.htm#fn_847) hear
me cry!  
Sweet Queen Sumitrá  <span id="fr_848"></span>[2](ry368.htm#fn_848),
list my sigh!  
True is the saw the wise declare:  
Death comes not to relieve despair.  
'Tis vain for dame or man to pray;  
Death will not hear before his day;  
Since I, from Ráma's sight debarred,  
And tortured by my cruel guard,  
Still live in hopeless woe to grieve  
And loathe the life I may not leave.  
Here, like a poor deserted thing,  
My limbs upon the ground I fling,  
And, like a bark beneath the blast,  
Shall sink oppressed with woes at last.  
Ah, blest are they, supremely blest,  
Whose eyes upon my lord may rest;  
Who mark his lion, port, and hear  
His gentle speech that charms the ear.  
Alas, what antenatal crime,  
What trespass of forgotten time  
Waighs on my soul, and bids me bow  
Beneath this load of misery now?'
