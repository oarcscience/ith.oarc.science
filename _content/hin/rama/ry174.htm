<P>
Thus Rama showed to Janak's child<BR>
The varied beauties of the wild,<BR>
The hill, the brook and each fair spot,<BR>
Then turned to seek their leafy cot.<BR>
North of the mountain Rama found<BR>
A cavern in the sloping ground,<BR>
Charming to view, its floor was strown<BR>
With many a mass of ore and stone,<BR>
In secret shadow far retired<BR>
Where gay birds sang with joy inspired,<BR>
And trees their graceful branches swayed<BR>
With loads of blossom downward weighed.<BR>
Soon as he saw the cave which took<BR>
Each living heart and chained the look,<BR>
Thus Rama spoke to Sita, who<BR>
Gazed wondering on the silvan view:<BR>
'Does this fair cave beneath the height,<BR>
Videhan lady, charm thy sight?<BR>
Then let us resting here a while<BR>
The languor of the way beguile.<BR>
That block of stone so smooth and square<BR>
Was set for thee to rest on there,<BR>
And like a thriving Kes'ar tree<BR>
This flowery shrub o'ershadows thee.'<BR>
Thus Rama spoke, and Janak's child,<BR>
By nature ever soft and mild,<BR>
In tender words which love betrayed<BR>
Her answer to the hero made:<BR>
'O pride of Raghu's children, still<BR>
My pleasure is to do thy will.<BR>
Enough for me thy wish to know:<BR>
Far hast thou wandered to and fro.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Sita spake in gentle tone,<BR>
And went obedient to the stone,<BR>
Of perfect face and faultless limb<BR>
Prepared to rest a while with him.<BR>
And Rama, as she thus replied,<BR>
Turned to his spouse again and cried:<BR>
'Thou seest, love, this flowery shade<BR>
For silvan creatures' pleasure made,<BR>
How the gum streams from trees and plants<BR>
Torn by the tusks of elephants!<BR>

<P>
Through all the forest clear and high<BR>
Resounds the shrill cicala's cry.<BR>
Hark how the kite above us moans,<BR>
And calls her young in piteous tones;<BR>
So may my hapless mother be<BR>
Still mourning in her home for me.<BR>
There mounted on that lofty S&aacute;l<BR>
The loud Bhringr&aacute;j &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_375"></A><A HREF="#fn_375"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> repeats his call:<BR>
How sweetly now he tunes his throat<BR>
Responsive to the Ko&iuml;l's note.<BR>
Or else the bird that now has sung<BR>
May be himself the Ko&iuml;l's young,<BR>
Linked with such winning sweetness are<BR>
The notes he pours irregular.<BR>
See, round the blooming Mango clings<BR>
That creeper with her tender rings,<BR>
So in thy love, when none is near,<BR>
Thine arms are thrown round me, my dear.'<BR>
&nbsp; Thus in his joy he cried; and she,<BR>
Sweet speaker, on her lover's knee,<BR>
Of faultless limb and perfect face,<BR>
Grew closer to her lord's embrace.<BR>
Reclining in her husband's arms,<BR>
A goddess in her wealth of charms,<BR>
She filled his loving breast anew<BR>
With mighty joy that thrilled him through.<BR>
His finger on the rock he laid,<BR>
Which veins of sanguine ore displayed,<BR>
And painted o'er his darling's eyes<BR>
The holy sign in mineral dyes.<BR>
Bright on her brow the metal lay<BR>
Like the young sun's first gleaming ray,<BR>
And showed her in her beauty fair<BR>
As the soft light of morning's air.<BR>
Then from the Kes'ar's laden tree<BR>
He picked fair blossoms in his glee,<BR>
And as he decked each lovely tress,<BR>
His heart o'erflowed with happiness.<BR>
So resting on that rocky seat<BR>
A while they spent in pastime sweet,<BR>
Then onward neath the shady boughs<BR>
Went R&aacute;ma with his Maithil spouse.<BR>
She roaming in the forest shade<BR>
Where every kind of creature strayed<BR>
Observed a monkey wandering near,<BR>
And clung to R&aacute;ma's arm in fear.<BR>
The hero R&aacute;ma fondly laced<BR>
His mighty arms around her waist,<BR>
Consoled his beauty in her dread,<BR>
And scared the Monkey till he fled.<BR>
That holy mark of sanguine ore<BR>
That gleamed on S&iacute;t&aacute;'s brow before,<BR>
Shone by that close embrace impressed<BR>
Upon the hero's ample chest.<BR>
Then S&iacute;t&aacute;, when the beast who led<BR>
The monkey troop, afar had fled,<BR>
Laughed loudly in light-hearted glee<BR>
That mark on R&aacute;ma's chest to see.<BR>

<P>

<P>
A clump of bright As'okas fired<BR>
The forest in their bloom attired:<BR>
The restless blossoms as they gleamed<BR>
A host of threatening monkeys seemed.<BR>
Then S&iacute;t&aacute; thus to R&aacute;ma cried,<BR>
As longingly the flowers she eyed:<BR>
'Pride of thy race, now let us go<BR>
Where those As'oka blossoms grow.'<BR>
He on his darling's pleasure bent<BR>
With his fair goddess thither went<BR>
And roamed delighted through the wood<BR>
Where blossoming As'okas stood,<BR>
As S'iva with Queen Um&aacute; roves<BR>
Through Himav&aacute;n's majestic groves.<BR>
Bright with purpureal glow the pair<BR>
Of happy lovers sported there,<BR>
And each upon the other set<BR>
A flower-inwoven coronet.<BR>
There many a crown and chain they wove<BR>
Of blooms from that As'oka grove,<BR>
And in their graceful sport the two<BR>
Fresh beauty o'er the mountain threw.<BR>
The lover let his love survey<BR>
Each pleasant spot that round them lay,<BR>
Then turned they to their green retreat<BR>
Where all was garnished, gay, and neat.<BR>
By brotherly affection led,<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;'s son to meet them sped,<BR>
And showed the labours of the day<BR>
Done while his brother was away.<BR>
There lay ten black-deer duly slain<BR>
With arrows pure of poison stain,<BR>
Piled in a mighty heap to dry,<BR>
With many another carcass nigh.<BR>
And Lakshman's brother saw, o'erjoyed,<BR>
The work that had his hands employed,<BR>
Then to his consort thus he cried:<BR>
'Now be the general gifts supplied.'<BR>
Then S&iacute;t&aacute;, fairest beauty, placed<BR>
The food for living things to taste,<BR>
And set before the brothers meat<BR>
And honey that the pair might eat.<BR>
They ate the meal her hands supplied,<BR>
Their lips with water purified:<BR>
Then Janak's daughter sat at last<BR>
And duly made her own repast.<BR>
The other venison, to be dried,<BR>
Piled up in heaps was set aside,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma told his wife to stay<BR>
And drive the flocking crows away.<BR>
Her husband saw her much distressed<BR>
By one more bold than all the rest,<BR>
Whose wings where'er he chose could fly,<BR>
Now pierce the earth, now roam the sky.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma laughed to see her stirred<BR>
To anger by the plaguing bird:<BR>
Proud of his love the beauteous dame<BR>
With burning rage was all aflame.<BR>
Now here, now there, again, again<BR>
She chased the crow, but all in vain,<BR>
Enraging her, so quick to strike<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_206"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 206</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
With beak and wing find claw alike:<BR>
Then how the proud lip quivered, how<BR>
The dark frown marked her angry brow!<BR>
When R&aacute;ma saw her cheek aglow<BR>
With passion, he rebuked the crow.<BR>
But bold in impudence the bird,<BR>
With no respect for R&aacute;ma's word,<BR>
Fearless again at S&iacute;t&aacute; flew:<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma's wrath to fury grew.<BR>
The hero of the mighty arm<BR>
Spoke o'er a shaft the mystic charm,<BR>
Laid the dire weapon on his bow<BR>
And launched it at the shameless crow.<BR>
The bird, empowered by Gods to spring<BR>
Through earth itself on rapid wing,<BR>
Through the three worlds in terror fled<BR>
Still followed by that arrow dread.<BR>
Where'er he flew, now here now there,<BR>
A cloud of weapons filled the air.<BR>
Back to the high-souled prince he fled<BR>
And bent at R&aacute;ma's feet his head,<BR>
And then, as S&iacute;t&aacute; looked, began<BR>
His speech in accents of a man:<BR>
'O pardon, and for pity's sake<BR>
Spare, R&aacute;ma, spare my life to take!<BR>
Where'er I turn, where'er I flee,<BR>
No shelter from this shaft I see.'<BR>

<P>
The chieftain heard the crow entreat<BR>
Helpless and prostrate at his feet,<BR>
And while soft pity moved his breast,<BR>
With wisest speech the bird addressed:<BR>
'I took the troubled S&iacute;t&aacute;'s part,<BR>
And furious anger filled my heart.<BR>
Then on the string my arrow lay<BR>
Charmed with a spell thy life to slay.<BR>
Thou seekest now my feet, to crave<BR>
Forgiveness and thy life to save.<BR>
So shall thy prayer have due respect:<BR>
The suppliant I must still protect.<BR>
But ne'er in vain this dart may flee;<BR>
Yield for thy life a part of thee,<BR>
What portion of thy body, say,<BR>
Shall this mine arrow rend away?<BR>
Thus far, O bird, thus far alone<BR>
On thee my pity may be shown.<BR>
Forfeit a part thy life to buy:<BR>
'Tis better so to live than die.'<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma spoke: the bird of air<BR>
Pondered his speech with anxious care,<BR>
And wisely deemed it good to give<BR>
One of his eyes that he might live.<BR>
To Raghu's son he made reply:<BR>
'O R&aacute;ma, I will yield an eye.<BR>
So let me in thy grace confide<BR>
And live hereafter single-eyed.'<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma charged the shaft, and lo,<BR>
Full in the eye it smote the crow.<BR>
And the Videhan lady gazed<BR>
Upon the ruined eye amazed.<BR>
The crow to R&aacute;ma humbly bent,<BR>
Then where his fancy led he went.<BR>
R&aacute;ma with Lakshman by his side<BR>
With needful work was occupied.<BR>
