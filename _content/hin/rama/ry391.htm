<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LIII.: THE PUNISHMENT.</H3>
<P>
King R&aacute;van, by his pleading moved,<BR>
The counsel of the chief approved:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Thy words are wise and true; to kill<BR>
An envoy would beseem us ill<BR>
Yet must we for his crime invent<BR>
Some fitting mode of punishment.<BR>
The tail, I fancy, is the part<BR>
Most cherished by a monkey's heart.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Make ready: set his tail aflame,<BR>
And let him leave us as he came,<BR>
And thus disfigured and disgraced<BR>
Back to his king and people haste.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The giants heard their monarch's speech;<BR>
And, filled with burning fury, each<BR>
Brought strips of cotton cloth, and round<BR>
The monkey's tail the bandage wound.<BR>
As round big tail the bands they drew<BR>
His mighty form dilating grew<BR>

<P>

<P>
Vast as the flame that bursts on high<BR>
Where trees are old and grass is dry.<BR>
Each hand and strip they soaked in oil,<BR>
And set on fire the twisted coil.<BR>
Delighted as they viewed the blaze,<BR>
The cruel demons stood at gaze:<BR>
And mid loud drums and shells rang out<BR>
The triumph of their joyful shout.<BR>
They pressed about him thick and fast<BR>
As through the crowded streets he passed,<BR>
Observing with attentive care<BR>
Each rich and wondrous structure there,<BR>
Still heedless of the eager cry<BR>
That rent the air, The spy! the spy!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Some to the captive lady ran.<BR>
And thus in joyous words began:<BR>
'That copper-visaged monkey, he<BR>
Who in the garden talked with thee,<BR>
Through Lank&aacute;'s town is led a show,<BR>
And round his tail the red flames glow.'<BR>
The mournful news the lady heard<BR>
That with fresh grief her bosom stirred.<BR>
Swift to the kindled fire she went<BR>
And prayed before it reverent:<BR>
'If I my husband have obeyed,<BR>
And kept the ascetic vows I made,<BR>
Free, ever free, from stain and blot,<BR>
O spare the V&aacute;nar; harm him not.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then leapt on high the flickering flame<BR>
And shone in answer to the dame.<BR>
The pitying fire its rage forbore:<BR>
The V&aacute;nar felt the heat no more.<BR>
Then, to minutest size reduced,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
The bonds that bound his limbs he loosed,<BR>
And, freed from every band and chain,<BR>
Rose to his native size again.<BR>
He seized a club of ponderous weight<BR>
That lay before him by the gate,<BR>
Rushed at the fiends that hemmed him round,<BR>
And laid them lifeless on the ground,<BR>
Through Lank&aacute;'s town again he strode,<BR>
And viewed each street and square and road,--<BR>
Still wreathed about with harmless blaze,<BR>
A sun engarlanded with rays.<BR>
