<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXV.: R&Aacute;MA'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Then Raghu's son, whose feeling breast<BR>
Shared the great woe that moved the rest,<BR>
Strove with wise charm their grief to ease<BR>
And gently spoke in words like these:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   'You ne'er can raise the dead to bliss<BR>
By agony of grief like this<BR>
Cease your lament, nor leave undone<BR>
The funeral task you may not shun.<BR>
As nature orders o'er the dead<BR>
Your tributary tears are shed,<BR>
But Fate, directing each event,<BR>
Is still the lord preeminent.<BR>
Yes, all obey the changeless laws<BR>
Of Fate the universal cause,<BR>
By Fate, the lives of all proceed,<BR>
That governs every word and deed,<BR>
None acts, none sees his hest obeyed.<BR>
But each and all by Fate are swayed.<BR>
The world its ordered course maintains,<BR>
And o'er that course Fate ever reigns.<BR>
Fate ne'er exceeds the rule of Fate:<BR>
Is ne'er too swift, is ne'er too late,<BR>
And making nature its ally<BR>
Forgets no life, nor passes by.<BR>
No kith and kin, no power and force<BR>
Can check or stay its settled course,<BR>
No friend or client, grace or charm,<BR>
That victor of the world disarm.<BR>
So all who see with prudent eyes<BR>
The hand of Fate must recognize,<BR>
For virtue rules, or love, or gain,<BR>
As Fate's unchanged decrees ordain.<BR>
B&aacute;li has died and won the meed<BR>
That waits in heaven on noble deed,<BR>
Throned in the seats the brave may reach<BR>
By liberal hand and gentle speech,<BR>
True to a warrior's duty, bold<BR>
In fight, the hero lofty-souled<BR>
Deigned not to guard his life: he died,<BR>
And now in heaven is glorified.<BR>
Then cease these tears and wild despair:<BR>
Turn to the task that claims your care,<BR>
For B&aacute;li's is the glorious fate<BR>
Which warriors count most fortunate.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   When R&aacute;ma's speech had found a close.<BR>
Brave Lakshman, terror of his foes,<BR>
With wise and soothing words addressed<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va still with woe oppressed:<BR>
'Arise Sugr&iacute;va,' thus he said,<BR>
'Perform the service of the dead.<BR>
Prepare with T&aacute;r&aacute; and her son<BR>
That B&aacute;li's rites be duly done.<BR>
A store of funeral wood provide<BR>
Which wind and sun and time have dried<BR>
And richest sandal fit to grace<BR>
The pyre of one of royal race.<BR>

<P>
With words of comfort soft and kind<BR>
Console poor Angad's troubled mind,<BR>
Nor let thy heart be thus cast down,<BR>
For thine is now the V&aacute;nars' town.<BR>
Let Angad's care a wreath supply,<BR>
And raiment rich with varied dye,<BR>
And oil and perfumes for the fire,<BR>
And all the solemn rites require.<BR>
Go, hasten to the town, O King,<BR>
And T&aacute;r&aacute;'s little quickly bring.<BR>
A virtue is despatch: and speed<BR>
Is best of all in hour of need.<BR>
Go, let a chosen band prepare<BR>
The litter of the dead to bear.<BR>
For stout and tall and strong of limb<BR>
Must be the cheifs who carry him.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   He spoke,--his friends' delight and pride,--<BR>
Then stood again by R&aacute;ma's side.<BR>
When T&aacute;ra &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_612"></A><A HREF="#fn_612"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> heard the words he said<BR>
Within the town he quickly sped,<BR>
And brought, on stalwart shoulders laid,<BR>
The litter for the rites arrayed,<BR>
Framed like a car for Gods, complete<BR>
With painted sides and royal seat,<BR>
With latticed windows deftly made,<BR>
And golden birds and trees inlaid:<BR>
Well joined and wrought in every part,<BR>
A marvel of ingenious art.<BR>
Where pleasure mounds in carven wood<BR>
And many a graven figure stood.<BR>
The best of jewels o'er it hung,<BR>
And wreaths of flowers around it clung,<BR>
And over all was raised on high<BR>
A canopy of saffron dye,<BR>
While like the sun of morning shone<BR>
The billiant blooms that lay thereon.<BR>
That glorious litter R&aacute;ma eyed.<BR>
And spake to Lakshman by his side:<BR>
'Let B&aacute;li on the bier be placed<BR>
And with all funeral service graced.'<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va then with many a tear<BR>
Drew B&aacute;li's body to the bier<BR>
Whereon, with weeping Angad's aid,<BR>
The relics of the chief were laid<BR>
Neath many a vesture's varied fold,<BR>
And wreaths and ornaments and gold.<BR>
Then King Sugr&iacute;va bade them speed<BR>
The obsequies by law decreed:<BR>
'Let V&aacute;nars lead the way and throw<BR>
Rich gems around them as they go,<BR>
And be the chosen bearers near<BR>
Behind them, laden with the bier.<BR>
No costly rite may you deny,<BR>
Used when the proudest monarchs die:<BR>
As for a king of widest sway.<BR>
Perform his obsequies to-day,'<BR>

Sugr&iacute;va gave his high behest;<BR>
Then Princely T&aacute;ra and the rest,<BR>
With little Angad weeping, led<BR>
The long procession of the dead.<BR>
Behind the funeral litter came,<BR>
With T&aacute;ra first, each widowed dame<BR>
In tears and shrieks her loss deplored,<BR>
Add cried aloud, My lord! My lord!<BR>
While wood and hill and valley sent<BR>
In echoes back the shrill lament.<BR>
Then on a low and sandy isle<BR>
Was reared the hero's funeral pile<BR>
By crowds of toiling V&aacute;nars, where<BR>
The mountain stream ran fresh and fair.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chiefs, a noble band,<BR>
Had laid the litter on the sand,<BR>
And stood a little space apart,<BR>
Each mourning in his inmost heart.<BR>
But T&aacute;ra, when her weeping eye<BR>
Saw B&aacute;li, on the litter lie,<BR>
Laid his dear head upon her lap,<BR>
And wailed aloud her dire mishap;<BR>
'O mighty V&aacute;nar, lord and king,<BR>
To whose fond breast brave, and bold,<BR>
Rise, look upon me as of old.<BR>
Rise up, my sovereign, dost thou see<BR>
A crowd of subjects weep for thee?<BR>
Still o'er thy face, though breath has fled.<BR>
The joyous light of life is spread:<BR>
Thus around the sun, although he set,<BR>
A crimson glory lingers yet.<BR>
Death clad in R&aacute;ma's form to-day<BR>
Hast dragged thee from the world away.<BR>
One shaft from his tremendous bow<BR>
Dooms us to widowhood and woe.<BR>
Hast thou, O V&aacute;nar King, no eyes<BR>
Thy weeping wives to recognize,<BR>
Who for the length of way unmeet<BR>
Have followed thee with weary feet?<BR>
Yet every moon-faced beauty here<BR>
By thee, O King was counted dear.<BR>
Lord of the V&aacute;nar race, hast thou<BR>
No eyes to see Sugr&iacute;va now?<BR>
About thee stands in mournful mood<BR>
A sore-afflicted multitude,<BR>
And T&aacute;ra and thy lords of state<BR>
Around their monarch weep and wait,<BR>
Arise my lord, with gentle speech,<BR>
As was thy wont, dismissing each,<BR>
Then in the forest will we play<BR>
And love shall make our spirits gay.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The V&aacute;nar dames raised T&aacute;ra, drowned<BR>
In floods of sorrow, from the ground;<BR>
And Angad with Sugr&iacute;va's aid,<BR>
O'erwhelmed with anguish and dismayed,<BR>
Weeping for his departed sire,<BR>
Placed Bali's body on the pyre:<BR>
Then lit the flame, and round the dead<BR>
Paced slowly with a mourner's tread.<BR>
Thus with full rites the funeral train.<BR>
Performed the service for the slain,<BR>
Then sought the flowing stream and made<BR>
Libations to the parted shade.<BR>
There, setting Angad first in place,<BR>
The chieftains of the Vanar race,<BR>
With T&aacute;ra and Sugr&iacute;va, shed<BR>
The water that delights the dead.<BR>
