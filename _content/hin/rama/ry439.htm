<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XL.: R&Aacute;VAN ATTACKED.</H3>
<P>
Still stood the son of Raghu where<BR>
Suvela's peak rose high in air,<BR>
And with Sugr&iacute;va turned his eye<BR>
To scan each quarter of the sky.<BR>
There on Trik&uacute;ta, nobly planned<BR>
And built by Vis'vakarm&aacute;'s hand,<BR>
He saw the lovely Lank&aacute;, dressed<BR>
In all her varied beauty, rest.<BR>
High on a tower above the gate<BR>
The tyrant stood in kingly state,<BR>
The royal canopy displayed<BR>
Above him lent its grateful shade,<BR>
And servants, from the giant band,<BR>
His cheek with jewelled chowries fanned.<BR>
Red sandal o'er his breast was spread,<BR>
His ornaments and robe were red:<BR>
Thus shows a cloud of darksome hue<BR>
With golden sunbeams flashing through.<BR>
While R&aacute;ma and the chiefs intent<BR>
Upon the king their glances bent,<BR>
Up sprang Sugr&iacute;va from the ground<BR>
And reached the turret at a bound.<BR>
Unterrified the V&aacute;nar stood,<BR>
And wroth, with wondrous hardihood,<BR>
The king in bitter words addressed,<BR>
And thus his scorn and hate expressed:<BR>

<P>
'King of the giant race, in me<BR>
The friend and slave of R&aacute;ma see.<BR>
Lord of the world, he gives me power<BR>
To smite thee in thy fenced tower.'<BR>
While through the air his challenge rang,<BR>
At R&aacute;van's face the V&aacute;nar sprang.<BR>
Snatched from his head the kingly crown<BR>
And dashed it in his fury down.<BR>
Straight at his foe the giant flew,<BR>
His mighty arms about him threw.<BR>
With strength resistless swung him round<BR>
And dashed him panting to the ground,<BR>

<P>
Unharmed amid the storm of blows<BR>
Swift to his feet Sugr&iacute;va rose.<BR>
Again in furious fight they met:<BR>
With streams of blood their limbs were wet,<BR>
Each grasping his opponent's waist.<BR>
Thus with their branches interlaced,<BR>
Which, crimson with the flowers of spring,<BR>
From side to side the breezes swing,<BR>
In furious wrestle you may see<BR>
The Kins'uk and the Seemal tree. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_958"></A><A HREF="ry440.htm#fn_958"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
They fought with fists and hands, alike<BR>
Prepared to parry and to strike.<BR>
Long time the doubtful combat, waged<BR>
With matchless strength and fury, raged.<BR>
Each fiercely struck, each guarded well,<BR>
Till, closing, from the tower they fell,<BR>
And, grasping each the other's throat,<BR>
Lay for an instant in the moat,<BR>
Then rose, and each in fiercer mood<BR>
The sanguinary strife renewed.<BR>
Well matched in size and strength and skill<BR>
They fought the dubious battle still.<BR>
While sweat and blood their limbs bedewed<BR>
They met, retreated, and pursued:<BR>
Each stratagem and art they tried,<BR>
Stood front to front and swerved aside.<BR>
His hand a while the giant stayed<BR>
And called his magic to his aid.<BR>
But brave Sugr&iacute;va, swift to know<BR>
The guileful purpose of the foe,<BR>
Gained with light leap the upper air.<BR>
And breath and strength and spirit then;<BR>
Then, joyous as for victory won,<BR>
Returned to Raghu's royal son.<BR>
