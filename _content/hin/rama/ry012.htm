<P>
'Again, O best of kings, give ear:<BR>
My saving words attentive hear,<BR>
And listen to the tale of old<BR>
By that illustrious Br&aacute;hman told,<BR>
'Of famed Ikshv&aacute;ku's line shall spring<BR>
('Twas thus he spoke) a pious king,<BR>
Named Das'aratha, good and great,<BR>
True to his word and fortunate.<BR>
He with the Angas' mighty lord<BR>
Shall ever live in sweet accord,<BR>
And his a daughter fair shall be,<BR>
S'&aacute;nt&aacute; of happy destiny.<BR>
But Lomap&aacute;d, the Angas' chief,<BR>
Still pining in his childless grief,<BR>
To Das'aratha thus shall say:<BR>
'Give me thy daughter, friend, I pray,<BR>
Thy S'&aacute;nt&aacute; of the tranquil mind,<BR>
The noblest one of womankind.'<BR>

<P>
The father, swift to feel for woe,<BR>
Shall on his friend his child bestow;<BR>
And he shall take her and depart<BR>
To his own town with joyous heart.<BR>
The maiden home in triumph led,<BR>
To Rishyas'ring the king shall wed.<BR>
And he with loving joy and pride<BR>
Shall take her for his honoured bride.<BR>
And Das'aratha to a rite<BR>
That best of Br&aacute;hmans shall invite<BR>
With supplicating prayer,<BR>
To celebrate the sacrifice<BR>
To win him sons and Paradise, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
That he will fain prepare.<BR>

<P>
From him the lord of men at length<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The boon he seeks shall gain,<BR>
And see four sons of boundless strength<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His royal line maintain.'<BR>
'Thus did the godlike saint of old<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The will of fate declare,<BR>
And all that should befall unfold<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Amid the sages there.<BR>
O Prince supreme of men, go thou,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Consult thy holy guide,<BR>
And win, to aid thee in thy vow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  This Br&aacute;hman to thy side.'<BR>
Sumantra's counsel, wise and good,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  King Das'aratha heard,<BR>
Then by Vas'ishtha's side he stood<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And thus with him conferred:<BR>
'Sumantra counsels thus: do thou<BR>
My priestly guide, the plan allow.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Vas'ishtha gave his glad consent,<BR>
And forth the happy monarch went<BR>
With lords and servants on the road<BR>
That led to Rishyas'ring's abode.<BR>
Forests and rivers duly past,<BR>
He reached the distant town at last<BR>
Of Lomap&aacute;d the Angas' king,<BR>
And entered it with welcoming.<BR>
On through the crowded streets he came,<BR>
And, radiant as the kindled flame,<BR>
He saw within the monarch's house<BR>
The hermit's son most glorious.<BR>
There Lomap&aacute;d, with joyful breast,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To him all honour paid,<BR>
For friendship for his royal guest<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His faithful bosom swayed.<BR>
Thus entertained with utmost care<BR>
Seven days, or eight, he tarried there,<BR>
And then that best men thus broke<BR>
His purpose to the king, and spoke:<BR>
'O King of men, mine ancient friend,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  (Thus Das'aratha prayed)<BR>
Thy S'ant&aacute; with her husband send<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My sacrifice to aid.<BR>
Said he who ruled the Angas, Yea,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And his consent was won:<BR>
And then at once he turned away<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To warn the hermit's son.<BR>
He told him of their ties beyond<BR>
Their old affection's faithful bond:<BR>
'This king,' he said, 'from days of old<BR>
A well beloved friend I hold.<BR>
To me this pearl of dames he gave<BR>
From childless woe mine age to save,<BR>
The daughter whom he loved so much,<BR>
Moved by compassion's gentle touch.<BR>
In him thy S'ant&aacute;'s father see:<BR>
As I am even so is he.<BR>
For sons the childless monarch yearns:<BR>
To thee alone for help he turns.<BR>
Go thou, the sacred rite ordain<BR>
To win the sons he prays to gain:<BR>
Go, with thy wife thy succour lend,<BR>
And give his vows a blissful end.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hermit's son with quick accord<BR>
Obeyed the Angas' mighty lord,<BR>
And with fair S'ant&aacute; at his side<BR>
To Das'aratha's city hied.<BR>
Each king, with suppliant hands upheld,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Gazed on the other's face:<BR>
And then by mutual love impelled<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Met in a close embrace.<BR>
Then Das'aratha's thoughtful care,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Before he parted thence,<BR>
Bade trusty servants homeward bear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The glad intelligence:<BR>
'Let all the town be bright and gay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With burning incense sweet;<BR>
Let banners wave, and water lay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The dust in every street,'<BR>
Glad were the citizens to learn<BR>
The tidings of their lord's return,<BR>
And through the city every man<BR>
Obedienly his task began.<BR>
And fair and bright Ayodhy&aacute; showed,<BR>
As following his guest he rode<BR>
Through the full streets where shell and drum<BR>
Proclaimed aloud the king was come.<BR>
And all the people with delight<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kept gazing on their king,<BR>
Attended by that youth so bright,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The glorious Rishyas'ring.<BR>
When to his home the king had brought<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hermit's saintly son,<BR>
He deemed that all his task was wrought,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And all he prayed for won.<BR>
And lords who saw that stranger dame<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  So beautiful to view,<BR>
Rejoiced within their hearts, and came<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And paid her honour too.<BR>
There Rishyasring passed blissful days,<BR>
Graced like the king with love and praise<BR>
And shone in glorious light with her,<BR>
Sweet S'&aacute;nt&aacute;, for his minister,<BR>
As Brahm&aacute;'s son Vas'ishtha, he<BR>
Who wedded Saint Arundhati.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="ry013.htm#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

connected in Indian belief. A man desires
above every thing to have a son to perpetuate
his race, and to assist with sacrifices
and funeral rites to make him worthy to
obtain a lofty seat in heaven or to preserve
that which he has already obtained.'
