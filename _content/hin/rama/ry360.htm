<P>
While from his shelter in the boughs<BR>
The V&aacute;nar looked on R&aacute;ma's spouse<BR>
He heard the gathered giants raise<BR>
The solemn hymn of prayer and praise.--<BR>
Priests skilled in rite and ritual, who<BR>
The Vedas and their branches &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_829"></A><A HREF="#fn_829"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> knew.<BR>
Then, as loud strains of music broke<BR>
His sleep, the giant monarch woke.<BR>
Swift to his heart the thought returned<BR>
Of the fair queen for whom he burned;<BR>
Nor could the amorous fiend control<BR>
The passion that absorbed his soul.<BR>
In all his brightest garb arrayed<BR>
He hastened to that lovely shade.<BR>
Where glowed each choicest flower and fruit.<BR>
And the sweet birds were never mute.<BR>
And tall deer bent their heads to drink<BR>
On the fair streamlet's grassy brink.<BR>
Near that As'oka grove he drew,--<BR>
A hundred dames his retinue.<BR>
Like Indra with the thousand eyes<BR>
Girt with the beauties of the skies.<BR>
Some walked beside their lord to hold<BR>
The chouries, fans, and lamps of gold.<BR>
And others purest water bore<BR>
In golden urns, and paced before.<BR>
Some carried, piled on golden plates.<BR>
Delicious food of dainty cates;<BR>
Some wine in massive bowls whereon<BR>
The fairest gems resplendent shone.<BR>
Some by the monarch's side displayed,<BR>
Wrought like a swan, a silken shade:<BR>
Another beauty walked behind,<BR>
The sceptre to her care assigned.<BR>
Around the monarch gleamed the crowd<BR>
As lightnings flash about a cloud.<BR>
And each made music as she went<BR>
With zone and tinkling ornament.<BR>
Attended thus in royal state<BR>
The monarch reached the garden gate,<BR>
While gold and silver torches, fed<BR>
With scented oil a soft light shed. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_830"></A><A HREF="#fn_830"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>

He, while the flame of fierce desire<BR>
Burnt in his eyes like kindled fire,<BR>
Seemed Love incarnate in his pride,<BR>
His bow and arrows laid aside. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_831"></A><A HREF="ry361.htm#fn_831"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
His robe, from spot and blemish free<BR>
Like Amrit foamy from the sea, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_832"></A><A HREF="ry361.htm#fn_832"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Hung down in many a loosened fold<BR>
Inwrought with flowers and bright with gold.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar from his station viewed,<BR>
Amazed, the wondrous multitude,<BR>
Where, in the centre of that ring<BR>
Of noblest women, stood the king,<BR>
As stands the full moon fair to view,<BR>
Girt by his starry retinue.<BR>
