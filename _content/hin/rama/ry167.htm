<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXXIX.: THE PASSAGE OF GANG&Aacute;.</H3>
<P>
That night the son of Raghu lay<BR>
On Gang&aacute;'s bank till break of day:<BR>
Then with the earliest light he woke<BR>
And thus to brave S'atrughna spoke.<BR>
'Rise up, S'atrughna, from thy bed:<BR>
Why sleepest thou the night is fled.<BR>
See how the sun who chases night<BR>
Wakes every lotus with his light.<BR>
Arise, arise, and first of all<BR>
The lord of S'ringavera call,<BR>
For he his friendly aid will lend<BR>
Our army o'er the flood to send.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus urged, S'atrughna answered: 'I,<BR>
Remembering R&aacute;ma, sleepless lie.'<BR>
As thus the brothers, each to each,<BR>
The lion-mettled, ended speech,<BR>
Came Guha, the Nish&aacute;das' king,<BR>
And spoke with kindly questioning:<BR>
'Hast thou in comfort passed,' he cried,<BR>
'The night upon the river side?<BR>
With thee how fares it? and are these,<BR>
Thy soldiers, health and at ease?'<BR>
Thus the Nish&aacute;das' lord inquired<BR>
In gentle words which love inspired,<BR>
And Bharat, R&aacute;ma's faithful slave,<BR>
Thus to the king his answer gave:<BR>
'The night has sweetly passed, and we<BR>
Are highly honoured, King, by thee.<BR>
Now let thy servants boats prepare,<BR>
Our army o'er the stream to bear.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The speech of Bharat Guha heard,<BR>
And swift to do his bidding stirred.<BR>
Within the town the monarch sped<BR>
And to his ready kinsmen said:<BR>
'Awake, each kinsman, rise, each friend!<BR>
May every joy your lives attend.<BR>
Gather each boat upon the shore<BR>
And ferry all the army o'er.'<BR>
Thus Guha spoke: nor they delayed,<BR>
But, rising quick, their lord obeyed,<BR>
And soon, from every side secured,<BR>
Five hundred boats were ready moored.<BR>
Some reared aloft the mystic sign, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And mighty bells were hung in line:<BR>
Of firmest build, gay flags they bore,<BR>
And sailors for the helm and oar.<BR>
One such King Guha chose, whereon,<BR>
Of fair white cloth, an awning shone,<BR>
And sweet musicians charmed the ear,--<BR>
And bade his servants urge it near.<BR>
Then Bharat swiftly sprang on board,<BR>
And then S'atrughna, famous lord,<BR>
To whom, with many a royal dame,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; and Sumitr&aacute; came.<BR>
The household priest went first in place,<BR>
The elders, and the Brahman race,<BR>
And after them the monarch's train<BR>
Of women borne in many a wain,<BR>
Then high to heaven the shouts of those<BR>
Who fired the army's huts, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> arose,<BR>
With theirs who bathed along the shore,<BR>
Or to the boats the baggage bore.<BR>
Full freighted with that mighty force<BR>
The boats sped swiftly on their coarse,<BR>
By royal Guha's servants manned,<BR>
And gentle gales the banners fanned.<BR>
Some boats a crowd of dames conveyed,<BR>
In others noble coursers neighed;<BR>
Some chariots and their cattle bore,<BR>
Some precious wealth and golden store.<BR>
Across the stream each boat was rowed,<BR>
There duly disembarked its load,<BR>
And then returning on its way,<BR>
Sped here and there in merry play.<BR>
Then swimming elephants appeared<BR>
With flying pennons high upreared.<BR>
And as the drivers urged them o'er,<BR>
The look of winged mountains wore.<BR>
Some men in barges reached the strand,<BR>
Others on rafts came safe to land:<BR>
Some buoyed with pitchers crossed the tide,<BR>
And others on their arms relied.<BR>
Thus with the help the monarch gave<BR>
The army crossed pure Gang&aacute;'s wave:<BR>
Then in auspicious hour it stood<BR>
Within Prayuga's famous wood.<BR>
The prince with cheering words addressed<BR>
His weary mem, and bade them rest<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where'er they chose and he,<BR>
With priest and deacon by his side,<BR>
To Bharadvaja's dwelling hied<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That best of saints to see.<BR>
