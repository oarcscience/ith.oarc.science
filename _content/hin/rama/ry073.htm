<P>
On that same day that saw the king<BR>
His gift of kine distributing,<BR>
The lord of Kekaya's son, by name<BR>
Yudh&aacute;jit, Bharat's uncle, came,<BR>
Asked of the monarch's health, and then<BR>
Addressed the reverend king of men:<BR>
'The lord of Kekaya's realm by me<BR>
Sends greeting, noble King, to thee:<BR>
Asks if the friends thy prayers would bless<BR>
Uninterrupted health possess.<BR>
Right anxious, mighty King, is he<BR>
My sister's princely boy to see.<BR>
For this I sought Ayodhy&aacute; fair<BR>
The message of my sire to bear.<BR>
There learning, O my liege, that thou<BR>
With sons and noble kinsmen now<BR>
Wast resting here, I sought the place<BR>
Longing to see my nephew's face.'<BR>
The king with kind observance cheered<BR>
His friend by tender ties endeared,<BR>
And every choicest honour pressed<BR>
Upon his honourable guest.<BR>

<P>
That night with all his children spent,<BR>
At morn King Das'aratha went,<BR>
Behind Vas'ishtha and the rest,<BR>
To the fair ground for rites addressed.<BR>
Then when the lucky hour was nigh<BR>
Called Victory, of omen high,<BR>
Came R&aacute;ma, after vow and prayer<BR>
For nuptial bliss and fortune fair,<BR>
With the three youths in bright attire,<BR>
And stood beside his royal sire.<BR>
To Janak then Vas'ishtha sped,<BR>
And to Videha's monarch said:<BR>
'O King, Ayodhy&aacute;'s ruler now<BR>
Has breathed the prayer and vowed the vow,<BR>
And with his sons expecting stands<BR>
The giver of the maidens' hands.<BR>
The giver and the taker both<BR>
Must ratify a mutual oath.<BR>
Perform the part for which we wait,<BR>
And rites of marriage celebrate.'<BR>

<P>
Skilled in the laws which Scriptures teach,<BR>
He answered thus Vas'ishtha's speech:<BR>
'O Saint, what warder bars the gate?<BR>
Whose bidding can the king await?<BR>
In one's own house what doubt is shown?<BR>
This kingdom, Sage, is all thine own.<BR>
E'en now the maidens may he found<BR>
Within the sacrificial ground:<BR>
Each vow is vowed and prayed each prayer,<BR>
And they, like fire, are shining there.<BR>
Here by the shrine my place I took<BR>
Expecting thee with eager look.<BR>
No bar the nuptial rites should stay:<BR>
What cause have we for more delay?'<BR>
When Janak's speech the monarch heard<BR>
To sons and saints he gave the word,<BR>
And set them in the holy ring.<BR>
Then to Vas'ishtha spoke the king<BR>
Of Mithil&aacute;: 'O mighty Sage,<BR>
Now let this task thy care engage,<BR>
And lend thine aid and counsel wise<BR>
The nuptial rites to solemnize.'<BR>

<P>
The saint Vas'ishtha gave assent,<BR>
And quickly to the task he went.<BR>
With Vis'v&aacute;mitra, nothing both,<BR>
And S'at&aacute;nanda aiding both.<BR>
Then, as the rules prescribe, they made<BR>
An altar in the midst, and laid<BR>
Fresh wreaths of fragrant flowers thereon.<BR>
The golden ladles round it shone;<BR>
And many a vase, which branches hid<BR>
Fixed in the perforated lid,<BR>
And sprays, and cups, and censers there<BR>
Stood filled with incense rich and rare;<BR>
Shell-bowls,and spoons, and salvers dressed<BR>
With gifts that greet the honoured guest;<BR>
Piles of parched rice some dishes bore,<BR>
Others with corn prepared ran o'er;<BR>
And holy grass was duly spread<BR>
In equal lengths, while prayers were said.<BR>
Next chief of saints, Vas'ishtha came<BR>
And laid the offering in the flame.<BR>
Then by the hand King Janak drew<BR>
His S&iacute;t&aacute;, beautiful to view,<BR>
And placed her, bright in rich attire,<BR>
R&aacute;ma to face, before the fire,<BR>
Thus speaking to the royal boy<BR>
Who filled Kaus'aly&aacute;'s heart with joy:<BR>
'Here S&iacute;t&aacute; stands, my daughter fair,<BR>
The duties of thy life to share.<BR>
Take from her father, take thy bride,<BR>
Join hand to hand, and bliss betide!<BR>
A faithful wife, most blest is she,<BR>
And as thy shade will follow thee.'<BR>

<P>
Thus as he spoke the monarch threw<BR>
O'er her young limbs the holy dew,<BR>
While Gods and saints were heard to swell<BR>
The joyous cry, 'Tis well! 'Tis well!<BR>
His daughter S&iacute;t&aacute; thus bestowed,<BR>
O'er whom the sacred drops had flowed.<BR>
King Janak's heart with rapture glowed.<BR>
Then to Prince Lakshman thus he cried'.<BR>
'Take Urmil&aacute; thine offered bride,<BR>
And clasp her hand within thine own<BR>
Ere yet the lucky hour be flown.'<BR>
Then to Prince Bharat thus cried he;<BR>
'Come, take the hand of M&aacute;ndavi.'<BR>
Then to S'atrughna: 'In thy grasp<BR>
The hand of S'rutakirti clasp.<BR>
Now, Raghu's sons, may all of you<BR>
Be gentle to your wives and true;<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Keep well the vows you make to-day,<BR>
Nor let occasion slip away.'<BR>

<P>
King Janak's word the youths obeyed;<BR>
The maidens' hands in theirs they laid.<BR>
Then with their brides the princes went<BR>
With ordered steps and reverent<BR>
Bound both the tire and Janak, round<BR>
The sages and the sacred ground.<BR>

<P>
A flowery flood of lucid dyes<BR>
In rain descended from the skies,<BR>
While with celestial voices blent<BR>
Sweet strains from many an instrument,<BR>
And the nymphs danced in joyous throng<BR>
Responsive to the minstrel's song.<BR>
Such signs of exultation they<BR>
Saw on the princes' wedding day.<BR>
Still rang the heavenly music's sound<BR>
When Raghu's sons thrice circled round<BR>
The fire, each one with reverent head,<BR>
And homeward then their brides they led.<BR>
They to the sumptuous palace hied<BR>
That Janak's care had seen supplied.<BR>
The monarch girt with saint and peer<BR>
Still fondly gazing followed near.<BR>
