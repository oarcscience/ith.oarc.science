<P>
Thus Saram&aacute; her story told:<BR>
And Sit&aacute;'s spirit was consoled.<BR>
As when the first fresh rain is shed<BR>
The parching earth is comforted.<BR>
Then, filled with zeal for Sit&aacute;'s sake,<BR>
Again in gentle tones she spake,<BR>
And, skilled in arts that soothe and please,<BR>
Addressed the queen in words like these;<BR>
'Thy husband, lady, will I seek,<BR>
Say the fond words thy lips would apeak,<BR>
And then, unseen of any eye,<BR>
Back to thy side will swiftly fly.<BR>
My airy flights are speedier far<BR>
Than Garuda's and the tempest are.'<BR>

<P>
Then Sit&aacute; spake: her former woe<BR>
Still left her accents faint and low:<BR>
'I know thy steps, which naught can stay,<BR>
Can urge through heaven and hell their way.<BR>
Then if thy love and changeless will<BR>
Would serve the helpless captive still,<BR>
Go forth and learn each plot and guile<BR>
Planned by the lord of Lank&aacute;'s isle.<BR>
With magic art like maddening wine<BR>
He cheats these weeping eyes of mine.<BR>
Torments me with his suit, nor spares<BR>
Reproof or flattery, threats or prayers.<BR>
These guards surround me night and day;<BR>
My heart is sad, my senses stray;<BR>
And helpless in my woe I fear<BR>
The tyrant R&aacute;van even here.'<BR>

<P>
Then Saram&aacute; replied:'I go<BR>
To learn the purpose of thy foe,<BR>
Soon by thy side again to stand<BR>
And tell thee what the king has planned.'<BR>
She sped, she heard with eager ears<BR>
The tyrant speak his hopes and fears.<BR>
Where, gathered at their master's call,<BR>
The nobles filled the council hall;<BR>
Then swiftly, to her promise true,<BR>
Back to the As'oka grove she flew.<BR>
The lady on the grassy ground,<BR>
Longing for her return, she found;<BR>
Who with a gentle smile, to greet<BR>
The envoy, led her to a seat<BR>
Through her worn frame a shiver ran<BR>
As Saram&aacute; her tale began:<BR>
'There stood the royal mother: she<BR>
Besought her son to set thee free,<BR>

<P>
And to her counsel, tears and prayers,<BR>
The elder nobles added theirs:<BR>
'O be the Maith&iacute;l queen restored<BR>
With honour to her angry lord.<BR>
Let Janasth&aacute;n's* unhappy fight<BR>
Be witness of the hero's might.<BR>
Hanu&uacute;m&aacute;n o'er the waters came<BR>
And looked upon the guarded dame.<BR>
Let Lank&aacute;'s chiefs who fought and fell<BR>
The prowess of the leader tell.'<BR>
In vain they sued, in vain she wept,<BR>
His purpose still unchanged he kept.<BR>
As clings the miser to his gold,<BR>
He would not loose thee from his hold.<BR>
No, never till in death he lies,<BR>
Will Lank&aacute;'s lord release his prize.<BR>
Soon slain by R&aacute;ma's arrows all<BR>
The giants with their king will fall,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to his home will lead<BR>
His black-eyed queen from bondage freed.'<BR>

<P>
An awful sound that moment rose<BR>
From Lank&aacute;'s fast-approaching foes,<BR>
Where drum and shell in mingled peal<BR>
Made earth in terror rock and reel.<BR>
The hosts within the walls arrayed<BR>
Stood trembling, in their hearts dismayed;<BR>
Thought of the tempest soon to burst,<BR>
Aud Lank&aacute;'s lord, their ruin, cursed.<BR>
