<P>
The son of Raghu heard, consoled,<BR>
The wondrous tale Hanum&aacute;n told;<BR>
And, as his joyous hope grew high,<BR>
In friendly words he made reply:<BR>

<P>
'Behold a mighty task achieved.<BR>
Which never heart but his conceived.<BR>
Who else across the sea can spring,<BR>
Save V&aacute;yu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="ry401.htm#fn_906"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> and the Feathered King?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="ry401.htm#fn_907"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>
Who, pass the portals strong and high.<BR>
Which N&aacute;gas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="ry401.htm#fn_908"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A> Gods, and fiends defy,<BR>
Where R&aacute;van's hosts their station keep,--<BR>
And come uninjured o'er the deep?<BR>
By such a deed the Wind-God's son<BR>
Good service to the king has done,<BR>
And saved from ruin and disgrace<BR>
Lakshman and me and Raghu's race.<BR>
Well has he planned and bravely fought.<BR>
And with due care my lady sought.<BR>
But of the sea I sadly think,<BR>
And the sweet hopes that cheered me sink.<BR>
How can we cross the leagues of foam<BR>
That keep us from the giant's home?<BR>
What can the V&aacute;nar legions more<BR>
Than muster on the ocean shore?'<BR>
