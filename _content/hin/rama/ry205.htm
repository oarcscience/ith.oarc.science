<P>
So Raghu's son, his foemen's dread,<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; and his brother sped,<BR>
Girt round by many a twice-born sage,<BR>
To good Sutikshna's hermitage. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_420"></A><A HREF="#fn_420"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Through woods for many a league he passed,<BR>
O'er rushing rivers full and fast,<BR>
Until a mountain fair and bright<BR>
As lofty Meru rose in sight.<BR>
Within its belt of varied wood<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku'a sons and S&iacute;t&aacute; stood,<BR>
Where trees of every foliage bore<BR>
Blossom and fruit in endless store.<BR>
There coats of bark, like garlands strung,<BR>
Before a lonely cottage hung,<BR>
And there a hermit, dust-besmeared,<BR>
A lotus on his breast, appeared.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma with obeisance due<BR>
Addressed the sage, as near he drew:<BR>
'My name is R&aacute;ma, lord; I seek<BR>
Thy presence, saint, with thee to speak.<BR>
O sage, whose merits ne'er decay,<BR>
Some word unto thy servant say.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The sage his eyes on  R&aacute;ma bent,<BR>
Of virtue's friends pre&euml;minent;<BR>
Then words like these he spoke, and pressed<BR>
The son of Raghu to his breast:<BR>
'Welcome to thee, illustrious youth,<BR>
Best champion of the rights of truth!<BR>
By thine approach this holy ground<BR>
A worthy lord this day has found.<BR>
I could not quit this mortal frame<BR>
Till thou shouldst, come, O dear to fame:<BR>
To heavenly spheres I would not rise,<BR>
Expecting thee with eager eyes.<BR>


<P>



<P>
I knew that thou, unkinged, hadst made<BR>
Thy home in Chitrak&uacute;ta's shade.<BR>
E'en now, O R&aacute;ma, Indra, lord<BR>
Supreme by all the Gods adored,<BR>
King of the Hundred Offerings, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_421"></A><A HREF="#fn_421"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> said,<BR>
When he my dwelling visited,<BR>
That the good works that I have done<BR>
My choice of all the worlds have won.<BR>
Accept this meed of holy vows,<BR>
And with thy brother and thy spouse,<BR>
Roam, through my favour, in the sky<BR>
Which saints celestial glorify.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To that bright sage, of penance stern,<BR>
The high-souled R&aacute;ma spake in turn,<BR>
As V&aacute;sava &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_422"></A><A HREF="#fn_422"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> who rules the skies<BR>
To Brahm&aacute;'s gracious speech replies:<BR>
I of myself those worlds will win,<BR>
O mighty hermit pure from sin:<BR>
But now, O saint, I pray thee tell<BR>
Where I within this wood may dwell:<BR>
For I by S'arabhanga old,<BR>
The son of Gautama, was told<BR>
That thou in every lore art wise,<BR>
And seest all with loving eyes.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus to the saint, whose glories high<BR>
Filled all the world, he made reply:<BR>
And thus again the holy man<BR>
His pleasant speech with joy began:<BR>
'This calm retreat, O Prince, is blest<BR>
With many a charm: here take thy rest.<BR>
Here roots and kindly fruits abound,<BR>
And hermits love the holy ground.<BR>
Fair silvan beasts and gentle deer<BR>
In herds unnumbered wander here:<BR>
And as they roam, secure from harm,<BR>
Our eyes with grace and beauty charm:<BR>
Except the beasts in thickets bred,<BR>
This grove of ours has naught to dread."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hermit's speech when R&aacute;ma heard,--<BR>
The hero ne'er by terror stirred,--<BR>
On his great bow his hand he laid,<BR>
And thus in turn his answer made:<BR>
'O saint, my darts of keenest steel,<BR>
Armed with their murderous barbs, would deal<BR>
Destruction mid the silvan race<BR>
That flocks around thy dwelling-place.<BR>
Most wretched then my fate would be<BR>
For such dishonour shown to thee:<BR>
And only for the briefest stay<BR>
Would I within this grove delay.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke and ceased. With pious care<BR>
He turned him to his evening prayer,<BR>
Performed each customary rite,<BR>
And sought his lodging for the night,<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; and his brother laid<BR>

Beneath the grove's delightful shade,<BR>
First good S&uacute;t&iacute;kshnu, when he saw<BR>
The shades of night around them draw,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With hospitable care<BR>
The princely chieftains entertained<BR>
With store of choicest food ordained<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  For holy hermit's fare.<BR>
