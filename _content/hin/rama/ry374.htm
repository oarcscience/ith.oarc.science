<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXIV.: HANUM&Aacute;N'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Thus spoke the dame in mournful mood,<BR>
And Hanum&aacute;n his speech renewed:<BR>
'O lady, by thy lord's decree<BR>
I come a messenger to thee.<BR>
Thy lord is safe with steadfast friends,<BR>
And greeting to his queen he sends,<BR>
And Lakshman, ever faithful bows<BR>
His reverent head to R&aacute;ma's spouse.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Through all her frame the rapture ran,<BR>
As thus again the dame began:<BR>
'Now verily the truth I know<BR>
Of the wise saw of long ago:<BR>
'Once only in a hundred years<BR>
True joy to living man appears.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He marked her rapture-beaming hue,<BR>
And nearer to the lady drew,<BR>
But at each onward step he took<BR>
Suspicious fear her spirit shook.<BR>
'Alas, Alas,' she cried in fear.<BR>
'False is the tale I joyed to hear.<BR>
'Tis R&aacute;van, 'tis the fiend, who tries<BR>
To mock me with a new disguise.<BR>
If thou, to wring my woman's heart,<BR>
Hast changed thy shape by magic art,<BR>
And wouldst a helpless dame beguile,<BR>
The wicked deed is doubly vile.<BR>
But no: that fiend thou canst not be:<BR>
Such joy I had from seeing thee.<BR>
But if my fancy does not err,<BR>
And thou art R&aacute;ma's messenger,<BR>
The glories of my lord repeat:<BR>
For to these ears such words are sweet.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The V&aacute;nar knew the lady's thought,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_862"></A><A HREF="#fn_862"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
And gave the answer fondly sought:<BR>

<P>
'Bright as the sun that lights the sky<BR>
Dear as the Moon to every eye.<BR>
He scatters blessings o'er the land<BR>
Like bounties from Vais'ravan's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_863"></A><A HREF="ry375.htm#fn_863"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> hand.<BR>
Like Vishnu strong and unsubdued,<BR>
Unmatched in might and fortitude.<BR>
Wise, truthful as the Lord of Speech,<BR>
With gentle words he welcomes each.<BR>
Of noblest mould and form is he,<BR>
Like love's incarnate deity.<BR>
He quells the fury of the foe,<BR>
And strikes when justice prompts the blow.<BR>
Safe in the shadow of his arm<BR>
The world is kept from scathe and harm.<BR>
Now soon shall R&aacute;van rue his theft,<BR>
And fall, of realm and life bereft.<BR>
For R&aacute;ma's wrathful hand shall wing<BR>
His shafts against the giant king.<BR>
The day, O Maithil Queen, is near<BR>
When he and Lakshman will he here,<BR>
And by their side Sugr&iacute;va lead<BR>
His countless hosts of V&aacute;nar breed.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va's servant, I, by name<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n, by his order came.<BR>
With desperate leap I crossed the sea<BR>
To Lank&aacute;'s isle in search of thee,<BR>
No traitor, gentle dame, am I:<BR>
Upon my word and faith rely.'<BR>
