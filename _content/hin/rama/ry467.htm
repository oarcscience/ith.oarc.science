<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXI.: ATIK&Aacute;YA'S DEATH.</H3>
<P>
But Atik&aacute;ya's wrath grew high<BR>
To see his noblest kinsmen die.<BR>
He, fiercest of the giant race,<BR>
Presuming still on Brahm&aacute;'s grace;<BR>
Proud tamer of the immortals' pride,<BR>
Whose power and might with Indra's vied,<BR>
For blood and vengeful carnage burned,<BR>
And on the foe his fury turned.<BR>
High on a car that flashed and glowed<BR>
Bright as a thousand suns he rode.<BR>
Around his princely brows was set<BR>
A rich bejewelled coronet.<BR>
Gold pendants in his ears he wore;<BR>
He strained and tried the bow he bore,<BR>
And ever, as a shaft he aimed,<BR>
His name and royal race proclaimed.<BR>
Scarce might the V&aacute;nars brook to hear<BR>
His clanging bow and voice of fear:<BR>
To Raghu's elder son they fled,<BR>
Their sure defence in woe and dread.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma bent his eyes afar<BR>
And saw the giant in his car<BR>
Fast following the flying crowd<BR>
And roaring like a rainy cloud.<BR>
He, with the lust of battle fired,<BR>
Turned to Vibh&iacute;shan and inquired:<BR>
'Say, who is this, of mountain size,<BR>
This archer with the lion eyes?<BR>
His car, which strikes our host with awe,<BR>
A thousand eager coursers draw.<BR>
Surrounded by the flashing spears<BR>
Which line his car, the chief appears<BR>
Like some huge cloud when lightnings play<BR>
About it on a stormy day;<BR>
And the great bow he joys to hold<BR>
Whose bended back is bright with gold,<BR>
As Indra's bow makes glad the skies,<BR>
That best of chariots glorifies.<BR>
O see the sunlike splendour flung<BR>
From the great flag above him hung,<BR>
Where, blazened with refulgent lines,<BR>
R&aacute;hu &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1005"></A><A HREF="#fn_1005"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the dreadful Dragon shines.<BR>
Full thirty qivers near his side,<BR>
His car with shafts is well supplied:<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_483"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 483</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And flashing like the light of stars<BR>
Gleam his two mighty scimitars.<BR>
Say, best of giants, who is he<BR>
Before whose face the V&aacute;nars flee?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma spake. Vibh&iacute;shan eyed<BR>
The giants chief, and thus replied:<BR>
'This R&aacute;ma, this is R&aacute;van's son:<BR>
High fame his youthful might has won.<BR>
He, best of warriors, bows his ear<BR>
The wisdom of the wise to hear.<BR>
Supreme is he mid those who know<BR>
The mastery of sword and bow.<BR>
Unrivalled in the bold attack<BR>
On elephant's or courser's back,<BR>
He knows, beside, each subtler art,<BR>
To win the foe, to bribe, or part.<BR>
On him the giant hosts rely,<BR>
And fear no ill when he is nigh.<BR>
This peerless chieftain bears the name<BR>
Of Atik&aacute;va huge of frame,<BR>
Whom Dhanyam&aacute;lin&iacute; of yore<BR>
To R&aacute;van lord of Lank&aacute; bore.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Roused by his bow-string's awful clang,<BR>
To meet their foes the V&aacute;nars sprang.<BR>
Armed with tall trees from Lank&aacute;'s wood,<BR>
And rocks and mountain peaks, they stood.<BR>
The giant's arrows, gold-bedecked,<BR>
The storm of hurtling missiles checked;<BR>
And ever on his foemen poured<BR>
Fierce tempest from his clanging cord;<BR>
Nor could the V&aacute;nar chiefs sustain<BR>
His shafts' intolerable rain.<BR>
They fled: the victor gained the place<BR>
Where stood the lord of Raghu's race,<BR>
And cried with voice of thunder: 'Lo,<BR>
Borne on my car, with shaft and bow,<BR>
I, champion of the giants, scorn<BR>
To fight with weaklings humbly born.<BR>
Come forth your bravest, if he dare,<BR>
And right with one who will not spare.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Forth sprang Sumitr&aacute;'s noble child, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1006"></A><A HREF="#fn_1006"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And strained his ready bow, and smiled;<BR>
And giants trembled as the clang<BR>
Through heaven and earth reechoing rang.<BR>
The giant to his string applied<BR>
A pointed shaft, and proudly cried;<BR>
'Turn, turn, Sumitr&aacute;'s son and fly,<BR>
For terrible as Death am I<BR>
Fly, nor that youthful form oppose,<BR>
Untrained in war, to warriors' blows.<BR>
What! wilt thou waste thy childish breath<BR>
And wake the dormant fire of death?<BR>
Cast down, rash boy, that useless bow:<BR>
Preserve thy life, uninjured go.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: and stirred by wrath & pride<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;'s noble son replied:<BR>
'By warlike deed, not words alone,<BR>
The valour of the brave is shown.<BR>
Cease with vain boasts my scorn to move,<BR>

<P>

<P>
And with thine arm thy prowess prove.<BR>
Borne on thy car, with sword and bow,<BR>
With all thine arms, thy valour show.<BR>
Fight, and my deadly shafts this day<BR>
Low in the dust thy head shall lay,<BR>
And, rushing fast in ceaseless flood,<BR>
Shall rend thy flesh and drink thy blood.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His giant foe no answer made,<BR>
But on his string an arrow laid.<BR>
He raised his arm, the cord he drew,<BR>
At Lakshman's breast the arrow flew.<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;'s son, his foemen's dread,<BR>
Shot a fleet shaft with crescent head,<BR>
Which cleft that arrow pointed well,<BR>
And harmless to the earth it fell.<BR>
A shower of shafts from Lakshman's bow<BR>
Fell fast and furious on the foe<BR>
Who quailed not as the missiles smote<BR>
With idle force his iron coat.<BR>
Then came the friendly Wind-God near,<BR>
And whispered thus in Lakshman's ear:<BR>
'Such shafts as these in vain assail<BR>
Thy foe's impenetrable mail.<BR>
A more tremendous missile try,<BR>
Or never may the giant die.<BR>
Employ the mighty spell, and aim<BR>
The weapon known by Brahma's name.'<BR>
He ceased - Sumitr&aacute;'s son obeyed:<BR>
On his great bow the shaft was laid,<BR>
And with a roar like thunder, true<BR>
As Indra's flashing bolt, it flew.<BR>
The giant poured his shafts like rain<BR>
To check its course, but all in vain.<BR>
With spear and mace and sword he tried<BR>
To turn the fiery dart aside.<BR>
Winged with a force which naught could check.<BR>
It smote the monster in the neck,<BR>
And, sundered from his shoulders, rolled<BR>
To earth his head and helm of gold.<BR>
