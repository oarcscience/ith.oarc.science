<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXVII.: M&Aacute;R&Iacute;CHA'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
M&aacute;r&iacute;cha gave attentive ear<BR>
The ruler of the fiends to hear:<BR>
Then, trained in all the rules that teach<BR>
The eloquent, began his speech:<BR>
''Tis easy task, O King, to find<BR>
Smooth speakers who delight the mind.<BR>
But they who urge and they who do<BR>
Distasteful things and wise, are few.<BR>
Thou hast not learnt, by proof untaught,<BR>
And borne away by eager thought,<BR>
That R&aacute;ma, formed for high emprise,<BR>
With Varun or with Indra vies.<BR>
Still let thy people live in peace,<BR>
Nor let their name and lineage cease,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma with his vengeful hand<BR>
Can sweep the giants from the land.<BR>
0, let not Janak's daughter bring<BR>
Destruction on the giant king.<BR>
Let not the lady S&iacute;t&aacute; wake<BR>
A tempest, on thy head to break.<BR>
Still let the dame, by care untried,<BR>
Be happy by her husband's side,<BR>
Lest swift avenging ruin fall<BR>
On glorious Lank&aacute;, thee, and all.<BR>
Men such as thou with wills unchained,<BR>
Advised by sin and unrestrained,<BR>
Destroy themselves, the king, the state,<BR>
And leave the people desolate.<BR>
R&aacute;ma, in bonds of duty held,<BR>
Was never by his sire expelled.<BR>
He is no wretch of greedy mind,<BR>
Dishonour of his Warrior kind.<BR>
Free from all touch of rancorous spite,<BR>
All creatures' good is his delight.<BR>
He saw his sire of truthful heart<BR>
Deceived by  Queen Kaikey&iacute;'s art,<BR>
And said, a true and duteous son,<BR>
'What thou hast promised shall be done.'<BR>
To gratify the lady's will,<BR>
His father's promise to fulfil,<BR>
He left his realm and all delight<BR>
For Dandak wood, an anchorite.<BR>
No cruel wretch, no senseless fool<BR>
Is R&aacute;ma, unrestrained by rule.<BR>
This groundless charge has ne'er been heard,<BR>
Nor shouldst thou speak the slanderous word.<BR>
R&aacute;ma in truth and goodness bold<BR>
Is Virtue's self in human mould,<BR>
The sovereign of the world confessed<BR>
As Indra rules among the Blest.<BR>
And dost thou plot from him to rend<BR>
The darling whom his arms defend?<BR>
Less vain the hope to steal away<BR>
The glory of the Lord of Day.<BR>

<P>
O R&aacute;van, guard thee from the fire<BR>
Of vengeful R&aacute;ma's kindled ire,--<BR>
Each spark a shaft with deadly aim,<BR>
While bow and falchion feed the flame.<BR>
Cast not away in hopeless strife<BR>
Thy realm, thy bliss, thine own dear life.<BR>
O R&aacute;van of his might beware,<BR>
A God of Death who will not spare.<BR>
That bow he knows so well to draw<BR>
Is the destroyer's flaming jaw,<BR>
And with his shafts which flash and glow<BR>
He slays the armies of the foe.<BR>
Thou ne'er canst win--the thought forego--<BR>
From the safe guard of shaft and bow<BR>
King Janak's child, the dear delight<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma unapproached in might.<BR>
The spouse of Raghu's son, confessed<BR>
Lion of men with lion chest,--<BR>
Dearer than life, through good and ill<BR>
Devoted to her husband's will,<BR>
The slender-waisted, still must be<BR>
From thy polluting touches free.<BR>
Far better grasp with venturous hand<BR>
The flame to wildest fury fanned.<BR>
What, King of giants, canst thou gain<BR>
From this attempt so wild and vain?<BR>
If in the fight his eye he bend<BR>
Upon thee, Lord, thy days must end.<BR>
So life and bliss and royal sway,<BR>
Lost beyond hope, will pass away.<BR>
Summon each lord of high estate,<BR>
And chief, Vibh&iacute;shan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to debate.<BR>
With peers in lore of counsel tried<BR>
Consider, reason, and decide<BR>
Scan strength and weakness, count the cost,<BR>
What may be gained and what be lost.<BR>
Examine and compare aright<BR>
Thy proper power and R&aacute;ma's might,<BR>
Then if thy weal be still thy care.<BR>
Thou wilt be prudent and forbear.<BR>
O giant King, the contest shun,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy force is all too weak<BR>
The lord of Kos&aacute;l's mighty son<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In deadly fray to seek.<BR>
King of the hosts that rove at night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  O hear what I advise:<BR>
My prudent counsel do not slight;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be patient and be wise.'<BR>
