<P>
But R&aacute;ma, pride of Raghu's race,<BR>
Gazed tenderly on Lakshman's face,<BR>
And, as the sight his spirit broke,<BR>
Turned to Sushen and sadly spoke:<BR>
'Where is my power and valour? how<BR>
Shall I have heart for battle now,<BR>
When dead before my weeping eyes<BR>
My brother, noblest Lakshman, lies?<BR>
My tears in blinding torrents flow,<BR>
My hand unnerved has dropped my bow<BR>
The pangs of woe have blanched my cheek.<BR>
My heart is sick, my strength is weak.<BR>
Ah me, my brother! Ah, that I<BR>
By Lakshman's side might sink and die<BR>
Life, war and conquest, all are vain<BR>
If Lakshman lies in battle slain.<BR>
Why will those eyes my glances shun?<BR>
Hast thou no word of answer, none?<BR>
Ah, as thy noble spirit flown<BR>
And gone to other worlds alone?<BR>
Could thou not let thy brother seek<BR>
Those worlds with thee? O speak, O speak!<BR>
Rise up once more, my brother, rise,<BR>
Look on me with thy loving eyes.<BR>
Were not thy steps beside me still<BR>

<P>
In gloomy wood, on breezy hill?<BR>
Did not thy gentle care assuage<BR>
Thy brother's grief and fitful rage?<BR>
Didst thou not all his troubles share,<BR>
His guide and comfort in despair?'<BR>

<P>
As R&aacute;ma, vanquished, wept and sighed<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chieftain thus replied:<BR>
'Great Prince, unmanly thoughts dismiss,<BR>
Nor yield thy soul to grief like this,<BR>
In vain those burning tears are shed:<BR>
Our glory Lakshman is not dead.<BR>
Death on his brow no mark has set,<BR>
Where beauty's lustre lingers yet.<BR>
Clear is the skin, and tender hues<BR>
Of lotus flowers his palms suifuse.<BR>
O R&aacute;ma, cheer thy trembling heart;<BR>
Not thus do life and body part,<BR>
Now, Hanum&aacute;n, to thee I speak:<BR>
Hie hence to tall Mahodaya's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1017"></A><A HREF="ry477.htm#fn_1017"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> peak<BR>
Where herbs of sovereign virtue grow<BR>
Which life and health and strength bestow<BR>
Bring thou the leaves to balm his pain,<BR>
And Lakshman shall be well again.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: the Wind-God's son obeyed<BR>
Swift through the clouds his way he made.<BR>
He reached the hill, nor stayed to find<BR>
The wondrous herbs of healing kind,<BR>
From its broad base the mount he tore<BR>
With all the shrubs and trees it bore,<BR>
Sped through the clouds again and showed<BR>
To wise Sushen his woodv load. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1018"></A><A HREF="ry477.htm#fn_1018"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Sushen in wonder viewed the hill,<BR>
And culled the sovereign salve of ill.<BR>
Soon as the healing herb he found,<BR>
The fragrant leaves he crushed and ground.<BR>
Then over Lakshman's face he bent,<BR>
Who, healed and strengthened by the scent<BR>
Of that blest herb divinely sweet,<BR>
Rose fresh and lusty on his feet.<BR>
