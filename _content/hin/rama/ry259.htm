<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXI.: R&Aacute;MA'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
As R&aacute;ma sought his leafy cot<BR>
Through his left eye keen throbbings shot,<BR>
His wonted strength his frame forsook,<BR>
And all his body reeled aud shook.<BR>
Still on those dreadful signs he thought,<BR>
Sad omens with disaster fraught,<BR>
And from his troubled heart he cried,<BR>
'O, may no ill my spouse betide!'<BR>
He hastened to his dwelling-place,<BR>
Then sinking neath his misery's weight,<BR>
He looked and found it desolate.<BR>
Tossing his mighty arms on high<BR>
He sought her with an eager cry.<BR>
From spot to spot he wildly ran<BR>
Each corner of his home to scan.<BR>
He looked, but S&iacute;t&aacute; was not there;<BR>
His cot was disolate and bare,<BR>
Like streamlet in the winter frost,<BR>
The glory of her lilies lost.<BR>
With leafy tears the sad trees wept<BR>
As a wild wind their branches swept.<BR>
Mourned bird aud deer, and every flower<BR>
Drooped fainting round the lonely bower.<BR>
The silvan deities had fled<BR>
The spot where all the light was dead,<BR>
Where hermit coats of skin displayed,<BR>
And piles of sacred grass were laid.<BR>
He saw, and maddened by his pain<BR>
Cried in lament again, again:<BR>
'Where is she, dead or torn away.<BR>
Lost, or some hungry giant's prey?<BR>
Or did my darling chance to rove<BR>
For fruit and blossoms though the grove?<BR>
Or has she sought the pool or rill,<BR>
Her pitcher from the wave to fill?'<BR>
His eager eyes on fire with pain<BR>
He roamed about with maddened brain.<BR>
Each grove and glade he searched with care,<BR>
He sought, but found no S&iacute;t&aacute; there.<BR>
He wildly rushed from hill to hill;<BR>
From tree to tree, from rill to rill.<BR>
As bitter woe his bosom rent<BR>
Still R&aacute;ma roamed with fond lament:<BR>
'O sweet Kadamba say has she<BR>
Who loved thy bloom been seen by thee?<BR>
If thou have seen her face most fair,<BR>
Say, gentle tree, I pray thee, where.<BR>
O Bel tree with thy golden fruit<BR>
Round as her breast, no more be mute.<BR>
Where is my radiant darling, gay<BR>
In silk that mocks thy glossy spray?<BR>
O Arjun, say, where is she now<BR>
Who loved to touch thy scented bough?<BR>
Do not thy graceful friend forget,<BR>
But tell me, is she living yet?<BR>
Speak, Basil, thou must surely know,<BR>
For like her limbs thy branches show,--<BR>
Most lovely in thy fair array<BR>
Of twining plant and tender spray.<BR>
Sweet Tila, fairest of the trees,<BR>
Melodious with the hum of bees,<BR>
Where is my darling Sita, tell,--<BR>
The dame who loved thy flowers so well?<BR>
A&#156;oka, act thy gentle part,--<BR>
Named Heartsease,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> give me what thou art,<BR>
To these sad eyes my darling show<BR>
And free me from this load of woe.<BR>
O Palm, in rich ripe fruitage dressed<BR>
Round as the beauties of her breast,<BR>

<P>
If thou have heart to know and feel,<BR>
My peerless consort's fate reveal.<BR>
Hast thou, Rose-apple, chanced to view<BR>
My darling bright with golden hue?<BR>
If thou have seen her quickly speak,<BR>
Where is the dame I wildly seek?<BR>
O glorious Cassia, thou art gay<BR>
With all thy loveliest bloom to-day,<BR>
Where is my dear who loved to hold<BR>
In her full lap thy flowery gold?'<BR>
To many a tree and plant beside,<BR>
To Jasmin, Mango, S&aacute;l, he cried.<BR>
'Say, hast thou seen, O gentle deer,<BR>
The fawn-eyed S&iacute;t&aacute; wandering here?<BR>
It may be that my love has strayed<BR>
To sport with fawns beneath the shade,<BR>
If thou, great elephant, have seen<BR>
My darling of the lovely mien,<BR>
Whose rounded limbs are soft and fine<BR>
As is that lissome trunk of thine,<BR>
O noblest of wild creatures, show<BR>
Where is the dame thou needs must know.<BR>
O tiger, hast thou chanced to see<BR>
My darling? very fair is she.<BR>
Cast all thy fear away, declare,<BR>
Where is my moon-faced darling, where?<BR>
There, darling of the lotus eye,<BR>
I see thee, and 'tis vain to fly.<BR>
Wilt thou not speak, dear love? I see<BR>
Thy form half hidden by the tree.<BR>
Stay if thou love me, S&iacute;t&aacute;, stay<BR>
In pity cease thy heartless play,<BR>
Why mock me now? thy gentle breast<BR>
Was never prone to cruel jest.<BR>
'Tis vain behind yon bush to steal:<BR>
Thy shimmering silks thy path reveal.<BR>
Fly not, mine eyes pursue thy way;<BR>
For pity's sake, dear S&iacute;t&aacute;, stay.<BR>
Ah me, ah me, my words are vain;<BR>
My gentle love is lost or slain.<BR>
How could her tender bosom spurn<BR>
Her husband on his home-return?<BR>
Ah no, my love is surely dead,<BR>
Fierce giants on her flesh have fed,<BR>
Rending the soft limbs of their prey<BR>
When I her lord was far away.<BR>
That moon-bright face, that polished brow,<BR>
Red lips, bright teeth--what are they now?<BR>
Alas, my darling's shapely neck<BR>
She loved with chains of gold to deck.--<BR>
That neck that mocked the sandal scent,<BR>
The ruthless fiends have grasped and rent<BR>
Alas, 'twas vain those arms to raise<BR>
Soft as the young tree's tender sprays<BR>
Ah, dainty meal for giants' lips<BR>
Were arms and quivering finger tips.<BR>
Ah, she who counted many a friend<BR>
Was left for fiends to seize and rend,<BR>
Was left by me without defence<BR>
From ravening giants' violence.<BR>
O Lakshman of the arm of might,<BR>

<P>
Say, is my darling love in sight;<BR>
O dearest S&iacute;t&aacute;. where art thou?<BR>
Where is my darling consort now?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus as he cried in wild lament<BR>
From grove to grove the mourner went.<BR>
Here for a moment sank to rest.<BR>
Then started up and onward pressed.<BR>
Thus roaming on like one distraught<BR>
Still for his vanished love he sought.<BR>
He searched in wood and hill and glade,<BR>
By rock and brook and wild cascade.<BR>
Through groves with restless step he sped<BR>
And left no spot unvisited.<BR>
Through lawns and woods of vast extent<BR>
Still searching for his love he went<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With eager steps and fast.<BR>
For many a weary hour he toiled,<BR>
Still in his fond endeavour foiled,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yet hoping to the last.<BR>
