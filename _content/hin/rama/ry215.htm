The bathing and the prayer were o'er;<BR>
He turned him from the grassy shore,<BR>
And with his brother and his spouse<BR>
Sought his fair home beneath the boughs,<BR>
Sit&aacute; and Lakshman by his side,<BR>
On to his cot the hero hied,<BR>
And after rites at morning due<BR>
Within the leafy shade withdrew.<BR>

Then, honoured by the devotees,<BR>
As royal R&aacute;ma sat at ease,<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; near him, o'er his head<BR>
A canopy of green boughs spread,<BR>
He shone as shines the Lord of Night<BR>
By Chitr&aacute;'s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> side, his dear delight.<BR>
With Lakshman there he sat and told<BR>
Sweet stories of the days of old,<BR>
And as the pleasant time he spent<BR>
With heart upon each tale intent,<BR>
A giantess, by fancy led,<BR>
Came wandering to his leafy shed.<BR>
Fierce S'&uacute;rpanakh&iacute;,--her of yore<BR>
The Ten-necked tyrant's mother bore,--<BR>
Saw R&aacute;ma with his noble mien<BR>
Bright as the Gods in heaven are seen;<BR>
Him from whose brow a glory gleamed,<BR>
Like lotus leaves his full eyes beamed:<BR>
Long-armed, of elephantine gait,<BR>
With hair close coiled in hermit plait:<BR>
In youthful vigour, nobly framed,<BR>
By glorious marks a king proclaimed:<BR>
Like some bright lotus lustrous-hued,<BR>
With young Kandarpa's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_458"></A><A HREF="#fn_458"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> grace endued:<BR>
As there like Indra's self he shone,<BR>
She loved the youth she gazed upon.<BR>
She grim of eye and foul of face<BR>
Loved his sweet glance and forehead's grace:<BR>
She of unlovely figure, him<BR>
Of stately form and shapely limb:<BR>
She whose dim locks disordered hung,<BR>
Him whose bright hair on high brows clung:<BR>
She whose fierce accents counselled fear,<BR>
Him whose soft tones were sweet to hear:<BR>
She whose dire form with age was dried,<BR>
Him radiant in his youthful pride:<BR>
She whose false lips maintained the wrong,<BR>
Him in the words of virtue strong:<BR>
She cruel-hearted, stained with sin,<BR>
Him just in deed and pure within.<BR>
She, hideous fiend, a thing to hate,<BR>
Him formed each eye to captivate:<BR>
Fierce passion in her bosom woke,<BR>
And thus to Raghu's son she spoke:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'With matted hair above thy brows,<BR>
With bow and shaft and this thy spouse,<BR>
How hast thou sought in hermit dress<BR>
The giant-haunted wilderness?<BR>
What dost thou here? The cause explain:<BR>
Why art thou come, and what to gain?'<BR>
As S'&uacute;rpanakh&aacute; questioned so,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, the terror of the foe,<BR>
In answer to the monster's call,<BR>
With fearless candour told her all.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
'King Das'aratha reigned of old,<BR>
Like Gods celestial brave and bold.<BR>
I am his eldest son and heir,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma is the name I bear.<BR>
This brother, Lakshman, younger born,<BR>
Most faithful love to me has sworn.<BR>
My wife, this princess, dear to fame,<BR>
Is Sit&aacute; the Videhan dame.<BR>
Obedient to my sire's behest<BR>
And by the queen my mother pressed,<BR>
To keep the law and merit win,<BR>
I sought this wood to harbour in.<BR>
But speak, for I of thee in turn<BR>
Thy name, and race, and sire would learn.<BR>
Thou art of giant race, I ween.<BR>
Changing at will thy form and mien.<BR>
Speak truly, and the cause declare<BR>
That bids thee to these shades repair.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma spoke: the demon heard,<BR>
And thus replied by passion spurred:<BR>
'Of giant race, what form soe'er<BR>
My fancy wills, 'tis mine to wear.<BR>
Named S'&uacute;rpanakh&aacute; here I stray,<BR>
And where I walk spread wild dismay.<BR>
King R&aacute;van is my brother: fame<BR>
Has taught perchance his dreaded name,<BR>
Strong Kumbhakama slumbering deep<BR>
In chains of never-ending sleep:<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan of the duteous mind.<BR>
In needs unlike his giant kind:<BR>
D&uacute;shan and Khara, brave and bold<BR>
Whose fame by every tongue is told:<BR>
Their might by mine is far surpassed;<BR>
But when, O best of men, I cast<BR>
These fond eyes on thy form, I see<BR>
My chosen love and lord in thee.<BR>
Endowed with wondrous might am I:<BR>
Where'er my fancy leads I fly.<BR>
The poor misshapen Sit&aacute; leave,<BR>
And me, thy worthier bride receive.<BR>
Look on my beauty, and prefer<BR>
A spouse more meet than one like her:<BR>
I'll eat that ill-formed woman there:<BR>
Thy brother too her fate shall share.<BR>
But come, beloved, thou shalt roam<BR>
With me through all our woodland home;<BR>
Each varied grove with me shalt seek,<BR>
And gaze upon each mountain peak.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As thus she spoke, the monster gazed<BR>
With sparkling eyes where passion blazed:<BR>
Then he, in lore of language learned,<BR>
This answer eloquent returned:<BR>
