<P>
Then R&aacute;ma with a cheerful mind<BR>
The bow to Varun's hand resigned.<BR>
Due reverence to the saints he paid,<BR>
And thus addressed his sire dismayed:<BR>
'As Bhrigu's son is far from view,<BR>
Now let the host its march pursue,<BR>
And to Ayodhy&aacute;'s town proceed<BR>
In four-fold bands, with thee to lead.'<BR>

<P>
King Das'aratha thus addressed<BR>
His lips to R&aacute;ma's forehead pressed,<BR>
And held him to his aged breast.<BR>
Rejoiced in sooth was he to know<BR>
That Bhrigu's son had parted so,<BR>
And hailed a second life begun<BR>
For him and his victorious son.<BR>
He urged the host to speed renewed,<BR>
And soon Ayodhy&aacute;'s gates he viewed.<BR>
High o'er the roofs gay pennons played;<BR>
Tabour and drum loud music made;<BR>
Fresh water cooled the royal road,<BR>
And flowers in bright profusion glowed.<BR>
Glad crowds with garlands thronged the ways<BR>
Rejoicing on their king to gaze<BR>
And all the town was bright and gay<BR>
Exalting in the festive day.<BR>
People and Br&aacute;hmans flocked to meet<BR>
Their monarch ere he gained the street.<BR>
The glorious king amid the throng<BR>
Rode with his glorious sons along,<BR>
And passed within his dear abode<BR>
That like Him&aacute;laya's mountain showed.<BR>
And there Kausaly&aacute;, noble queen,<BR>
Sumitr&aacute; with her lovely mien,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; of the dainty waist,<BR>
And other dames his bowers who graced,<BR>
Stood in the palace side by side<BR>
And welcomed home each youthful bride:<BR>
Fair S&iacute;t&aacute;, lofty-fated dame,<BR>
Urmil&aacute; of the glorious fame,<BR>
And Kus'adhwaja's children fair,<BR>
With joyous greeting and with prayer,<BR>
As all in linen robes arrayed<BR>
With offerings at the altars prayed,<BR>
Due reverence paid to God above.<BR>
Each princess gave her soul to love,<BR>
And hidden in her inmost bower<BR>
Passed with her lord each blissful hour.<BR>
The royal youths, of spirit high,<BR>
With whom in valor none shall vie,<BR>
Lived each within his palace bounds<BR>
Bright as Kuvera's pleasure-grounds,<BR>
With riches, troops of faithful friends,<BR>
And bliss that wedded life attends:<BR>
Brave princes trained in warlike skill,<BR>
And duteous to their father's will.<BR>
At length the monarch called one morn<BR>
Prince Bharat, of Kaikey&iacute; born,<BR>
And cried: 'My son, within our gates<BR>
Lord Yudh&aacute;jit thine uncle waits.<BR>
The son of Kekaya's king is he,<BR>
And came, my child, to summon thee.'<BR>

<P>
Then Bharat for the road prepared,<BR>
And with S'atrughna forth he fared.<BR>
First to his sire he bade adieu,<BR>
Brave R&aacute;ma, and his mothers too.<BR>
Lord Yudh&aacute;jit with joyful pride<BR>
Went forth, the brothers by his side,<BR>
And reached the city where he dwelt:<BR>
And mighty joy his father felt.<BR>

<P>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman honoured still<BR>
Their godlike sire with duteous will.<BR>
Two constant guides for R&aacute;ma stood,<BR>
His father's wish, the people's good.<BR>
Attentive to the general weal<BR>
He thought and wrought to please and heal,<BR>
His mothers too he strove to please<BR>
With love and sonly courtesies.<BR>
At every time, in every spot,<BR>
His holy guides he ne'er forgot.<BR>
So for his virtues kind and true<BR>
Dearer and dearer R&aacute;ma grew<BR>
To Das'aratha, Br&aacute;hmans, all<BR>
In town and country, great and small.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma by his darling's side<BR>
Saw many a blissful season glide,<BR>
Lodged in her soul, each thought on her,<BR>
Lover, and friend, and worshipper.<BR>
He loved her for his father's voice<BR>
Had given her and approved the choice:<BR>
He loved her for each charm she wore<BR>
And her sweet virtues more and more.<BR>
So he her lord and second life<BR>
Dwelt in the bosom of his wife,<BR>
In double form, that, e'en apart,<BR>
Each heart could commune free with heart.<BR>

<P>
Still grew that child of Janak's race,<BR>
More goddess-fair in form and face,<BR>
The loveliest wife that e'er was seen,<BR>
In mortal mould sweet Beauty's Queen.<BR>
Then shone the son Kaus'aly&aacute; bore,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With this bright dame allied,<BR>
Like Vishnu whom the Gods adore,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With Lakshmi by his side.<BR>
