<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXII.: R&Aacute;VAN ROUSED.</H3>
<P>
But S&uacute;rpanakh&aacute; saw the plain<BR>
Spread with the fourteen thousand slain,<BR>
Doers of cruel deeds o'erthrown<BR>
By R&aacute;ma's mighty arm alone,<BR>
Add Tris'iras and D&uacute;shan dead,<BR>
And Khara, with the hosts they led.<BR>
Their death she saw, and mad with pain,<BR>
Roared like a cloud that brings the rain,<BR>
And fled in anger and dismay<BR>
To Lank&aacute;, seat of R&aacute;van's sway.<BR>
There on a throne of royal state<BR>
Exalted sat the potentate,<BR>
Begirt with counsellor and peer,<BR>
Like Indra with the Storm-Gods near.<BR>
Bright as the sun's full splendour shone<BR>
The glorious throne he sat upon,<BR>
As when the blazing fire is red<BR>
Upon a golden altar fed.<BR>
Wide gaped his mouth at every breath,<BR>
Tremendous as the jaws of Death.<BR>
With him high saints of lofty thought,<BR>
Gandharvas, Gods, had vainly fought.<BR>
The wounds Were on his body yet<BR>
From wars where Gods and demons met.<BR>
And scars still marked his ample chest<BR>
By fierce Air&aacute;vat's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_485"></A><A HREF="#fn_485"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> tusk impressed.<BR>
A score of arms, ten necks, had he,<BR>
His royal gear was brave to see.<BR>
His massive form displayed each sign<BR>
That marks the heir of kingly line.<BR>
In stature like a mountain height,<BR>
His arms were strong, his teeth were white,<BR>
And all his frame of massive mould<BR>
Seemed lazulite adorned with gold.<BR>
A hundred seams impressed each *limb*<BR>
Where Vishnu's arm had wounded him,<BR>
And chest and shoulder bore the print<BR>
Of sword and spear and arrow dint,<BR>
Where every God had struck a blow<BR>
In battle with the giant foe.<BR>
His might to wildest rage could wake<BR>
The sea whose faith naught else can shake,<BR>
Hurl towering mountains to the earth,<BR>
And crush e'en foes of heavenly birth.<BR>
The bonds of law and right he spurned:<BR>
To others' wives his fancy turned.<BR>
Celestial arms he used in fight,<BR>
And loved to mar each holy rite.<BR>
He went to Bhogavat&iacute;'s town,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Where V&aacute;suki was beaten down,<BR>
And stole, victorious in the strife,<BR>
Lord Takshaka's beloved wife.<BR>
Kail&aacute;sa's lofty crest he sought,<BR>
And when in vain Kuvera fought,<BR>
Stole Pushpak thence,the car that through<BR>
The air, as willed the master, flew.<BR>
Impelled by furious anger, he<BR>
Spoiled Nandan's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> shade and Nalin&iacute;,<BR>
And Chaitraratha's heavenly grove,<BR>
The haunts where Gods delight to rove.<BR>
Tall as a hill that cleaves the sky,<BR>
He raised his mighty arms on high<BR>
To check the blessed moon, and stay<BR>
The rising of the Lord of Day.<BR>
Ten thousand years the giant spent<BR>
On dire austerities intent.<BR>
And of his heads an offering, laid<BR>
Before the Self-existent, made.<BR>
No God or fiend his life could take,<BR>
Gandharva, goblin, bird, or snake:<BR>
Safe from all fears of death, except<BR>
From human arm, that life was kept.<BR>
Oft when the priests began to raise<BR>
Their consecrating hymns of praise,<BR>
He spoiled the Soma's sacred juice<BR>
Poured forth by them in solemn use.<BR>

The sacrifice his hands o'erthrew,<BR>
And cruelly the Br&aacute;hmans slew.<BR>
His was a heart that naught oould melt,<BR>
Joying in woes which others felt.<BR>

<P>
She saw the ruthless monster there,<BR>
Dread of the worlds, unused to spare.<BR>
In robes of heavenly texture dressed,<BR>
Celestial wreaths adorned his breast.<BR>
He sat a shape of terror, like<BR>
Destruction ere the worlds it strike.<BR>
She saw him in his pride of place,<BR>
The joy of old Pulastya's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="ry231.htm#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> race,<BR>
Begirt by counsellor and peer,<BR>
R&aacute;van, the foeman's mortal fear,<BR>
And terror in her features shown,<BR>
The giantess approached the throne.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then S&uacute;rpanakh&aacute; bearing yet<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Each deeply printed trace<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where the great-hearted chief had set<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A mark upon her face,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Impelled by terror and desire,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Still fierce, no longer bold,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To R&aacute;van of the eyes of fire<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Her tale, infuriate, told,<BR>
