<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXV.: VIS'V&Aacute;MITRA'S TRIUMPH</H3>
<P>
Then from Him&aacute;laya's heights of snow,<BR>
The glorious saint prepared to go,<BR>
And dwelling in the distant east<BR>
His penance and his toil increased.<BR>
A thousand years his lips he held<BR>
Closed by a vow unparalleled,<BR>
And other marvels passing thought,<BR>
Unrivalled in the world, he wrought.<BR>
In all the thousand years his frame<BR>
Dry as a log of wood became.<BR>
By many a cross and check beset,<BR>
Rage had not stormed his bosom yet.<BR>
With iron will that naught could bend<BR>
He plied his labour till the end.<BR>
So when the weary years were o'er,<BR>
Freed from his vow so stern and sore,<BR>
The hermit, all his penance sped,<BR>
Sate down to eat his meal of bread.<BR>
Then Indra, clad in Br&aacute;hman guise,<BR>
Asked him for food with hungry eyes.<BR>
The mighty saint, with steadfast soul,<BR>
To the false Br&aacute;hman gave the whole,<BR>
And when no scrap for him remained,<BR>
Fasting and faint, from speech refrained.<BR>
His silent vow he would not break:<BR>
No breath he heaved, no word he spake<BR>
Then as he checked his breath, behold!<BR>
Around his brow thick smoke-clouds rolled<BR>
And the three worlds, as if o'erspread<BR>
With ravening flames, were filled with dread.<BR>
Then God and saint and bard, convened.<BR>
And N&aacute;ga lord, and snake, and fiend,<BR>
Thus to the General Father cried,<BR>
Distracted, sad, and terrified:<BR>
'Against the hermit, sore assailed,<BR>
Lure, scathe, and scorn have naught availed,<BR>
Proof against rage and treacherous art<BR>
He keeps his vow with constant heart.<BR>
Now if his toils assist him naught<BR>
To gain the boon his soul has sought,<BR>
He through the worlds will ruin send<BR>
That fixt and moving things shall end,<BR>
The regions now are dark with doom,<BR>
No friendly ray relieves the gloom.<BR>
Each ocean foams with maddened tide<BR>
The shrinking hills in fear subside.<BR>
Trembles the earth with feverous throe<BR>
The wind in fitful tempest blows.<BR>
No cure we see with troubled eyes:<BR>
And atheist brood on earth may rise.<BR>
The triple world is wild with care,<BR>
Or spiritless in dull despair.<BR>
Before that saint the sun is dim,<BR>
His blessed light eclipsed by him.<BR>
Now ere the saint resolve to bring<BR>
Destruction on each living thing,<BR>
Let us appease, while yet we may,<BR>
Him bright as fire, like fire to slay.<BR>
Yea, as the fiery flood of Fate<BR>
Lays all creation desolate.<BR>
He o'er the conquered Gods may reign:<BR>
O, grant him what he longs to gain.'<BR>

<P>
Then all the Blest, by Brahm&aacute; led,<BR>
Approached the saint and sweetly said:<BR>
'Hail, Br&aacute;hman Saint! for such thy place:<BR>
Thy vows austere have won our grace.<BR>
A Br&aacute;hman's rank thy penance stern<BR>
And ceaseless labour richly earn.<BR>
I with the Gods of Storm decree<BR>
Long life, O Br&aacute;hman Saint, to thee.<BR>
May peace and joy thy soul possess;<BR>
Go where thou wilt in happiness.'<BR>

<P>
Thus by the General Sire addressed,<BR>
Joy and high triumph filled his breast.<BR>
His head in adoration bowed,<BR>
Thus spoke he to the Immortal crowd:<BR>
'If I, ye Gods, have gained at last<BR>
Both length of days and Br&aacute;hman caste,<BR>
Grant that the high mysterious name,<BR>
And holy Vedas, own my claim,<BR>
And that the formula to bless<BR>
The sacrifice, its lord confess.<BR>
And let Vas'ishtha, who excels<BR>
In Warriors' art and mystic spells,<BR>
In love of God without a peer.<BR>
Confirm the boon you promise here.'<BR>

<P>
With Brahm&aacute;'s son Vas'ishtha, best<BR>
Of those who pray with voice repressed,<BR>
The Gods by earnest prayer prevailed,<BR>
And thus his new-made friend he hailed:<BR>
'Thy title now is sure and good<BR>
To rights of saintly Br&aacute;hmanhood.'<BR>
Thus spake the sage. The Gods, content,<BR>
Back to their heavenly mansions went.<BR>
And Vis'vamitra, pious-souled,<BR>
Among the Br&aacute;hman saints enrolled,<BR>
On reverend Vas'ishtha pressed<BR>
The honours due to holy guest.<BR>
Successful in his high pursuit,<BR>
The sage, in penance resolute,<BR>
Walked in his pilgrim wanderings o'er<BR>
The whole broad land from shore to shore.<BR>
'Twas thus the saint, O Raghu's son,<BR>
His rank among the Br&aacute;hmans won.<BR>
Best of all hermits, Prince, is he;<BR>
In him incarnate Penance see.<BR>
Friend of the right, who shrinks from ill,<BR>
Heroic powers attend him still.'<BR>

<P>
The Br&aacute;hman, versed in ancient lore,<BR>
Thus closed his tale, and said no more,<BR>
To S'at&aacute;nanda Kus'ik's son<BR>
Cried in delight, Well done! well done!<BR>
Then Janak, at the tale amazed,<BR>
Spoke thus with suppliant hands upraised:<BR>
'High fate is mine, O Sage, I deem,<BR>
And thanks I owe for bliss supreme,<BR>
That thou and Raghu's children too<BR>
Have come my sacrifice to view.<BR>
To look on thee with blessed eyes<BR>
Exalts my soul and purifies.<BR>
Yea, thus to see thee face to face<BR>
Enriches me with store of grace.<BR>
Thy holy labours wrought of old,<BR>
And mighty penance, fully told,<BR>
R&aacute;ma and I with great delight<BR>
Have heard, O glorious Anchorite.<BR>
Unrivalled thine ascetic deeds:<BR>
Thy might, O Saint, all might exceeds.<BR>
No thought may scan, no limit bound<BR>
The virtues that in thee are found.<BR>
The story of thy wondrous fate<BR>
My thirsty ears can never sate.<BR>
The hour of evening rites is near:<BR>
The sun declines in swift career.<BR>
At early dawn, O Hermit, deign<BR>
To let me see thy face again.<BR>
Best of ascetics, part in bliss:<BR>
Do thou thy servant now dismiss.'<BR>

<P>
The saint approved, and glad and kind<BR>
Dismissed the king with joyful mind<BR>
Around the sage King Janak went<BR>
With priests and kinsmen reverent.<BR>
Then Vis'v&aacute;mitra, honoured so,<BR>
By those high-minded, rose to go,<BR>
And with the princes took his way<BR>
To seek the lodging where they lay.<BR>
