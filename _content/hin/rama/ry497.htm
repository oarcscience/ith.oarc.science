<P>
But R&aacute;ma bade the chariot stay,<BR>
And halting in his airy way,<BR>
In Bharadv&aacute;'s holy shade<BR>
His homage to the hermit paid.<BR>
'O saint,' he cried, 'I yearn to know<BR>
My dear Ayodhy&aacute;'s weal and woe.<BR>
O tell me that the people thrive,<BR>
And that the queens are yet alive.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Joy gleamed in Bhardv&aacute;ja's eye,<BR>
Who gently smiled and made reply:<BR>
'Thy brother, studious of thy will,<BR>
Is faithful and obedient still.<BR>
In tangled twine he coils his hair:<BR>
Thy safe return is all his care.<BR>
Before thy shoes he humbly bends,<BR>
And to thy house and realm attends.<BR>
When first these dreary years began,<BR>
When first I saw the banished man,<BR>
With Sit&aacute;, in his hermit coat,<BR>
At this sad heart compassion smote.<BR>
My breast with tender pity swelled:<BR>
I saw thee from thy home expelled,<BR>
Reft of all princely state, forlorn,<BR>
A hapless wanderer travel-worn,<BR>
Firm in thy purpose to fulfil<BR>
Thy duty and thy father's will.<BR>
But boundless is my rapture now:<BR>
Triumphant, girt with friends, art thou.<BR>
Where'er thy wandering steps have been,<BR>
Thy joy and woe mine eyes have seen.<BR>
Thy glorious deeds to me art known,<BR>
The Br&aacute;hmans saved, the foes o'erthrown.<BR>
Such power have countless seasons spent<BR>
In penance and devotion lent.<BR>
Thy virtues, best of chiefs, I know,<BR>
And now a boon would fain bestow.<BR>
This hospitable gift &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1047"></A><A HREF="ry498.htm#fn_1047"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> receive:<BR>
Then with the dawn my dwelling leave.'<BR>
The bended head of R&aacute;ma showed<BR>
His reverence for the grace bestowed;<BR>
Then for each brave companion's sake<BR>
He sought a further boon and spake:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O let that mighty power of thine<BR>
The road to fair Ayodhy&aacute; line<BR>
With trees where fruit of every hue<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' eye and taste may woo,<BR>
And flowers of every season, sweet<BR>
With stores of honeyed juice, may meet,'<BR>
The hero ceased: the hermit bent<BR>
His reverend head in glad assent;<BR>
And swift, as Bharadv&aacute;ja willed,<BR>
The prayer of R&aacute;ma was fulfilled.<BR>
For many a league the lengthening road<BR>
Trees thick with fruit and blossom showed<BR>
With luscious beauty to entice<BR>
The taste like trees of Paradise.<BR>
The V&aacute;nars passed beneath the shade<BR>
Of that delightful colonnade,<BR>
Still tasting with unbounded glee<BR>
The treasures of each wondrous tree.<BR>
