### CANTO XXII.: LAKSHMAN CALMED.

So Ráma kept unshaken still  
His noble heart with iron will.  
To his dear brother next he turned,  
Whose glaring eyes with fury burned,  
Indignant, panting like a snake,  
And thus again his counsel spake:  
'Thine anger and thy grief restrain,  
And firm in duty's path remain.  
Dear brother, lay thy scorn aside,  
And be the right thy joy and pride.  
Thy ready zeal and thoughtful care  
To aid what rites should grace the heir,--  
These 'tis another's now to ask;  
Come, gird thee for thy noble task,  
That Bharat's throning rites may he  
Graced with the things prepared for me.  
And with thy gentle care provide  
That her fond heart, now sorely tried  
With fear and longing for my sake,  
With doubt and dread may never ache.  
To know that thoughts of coming ill  
One hour that tender bosom fill  
With agony and dark despair  
Is grief too great for me to bear.  
I cannot, brother, call to mind  
One wilful fault or undesigned,  
When I have pained in anything  
My mothers or my sire the king.  
The right my father keeps in view,  
In promise, word, and action true;  
Let him then all his fear dismiss,  
Nor dread the loss of future bliss.  
He fears his truth herein will fail:  
Hence bitter thoughts his heart assail.  
He trembles lest the rites proceed,  
And at his pangs my heart should bleed.  
So now this earnest wish is mine,  
The consecration to resign,  
And from this city turn away  
To the wild wood with no delay.  
My banishment to-day will free  
Kaikeyí from her cares, that she,  
At last contented and elate,  
May Bharat's throning celebrate.  

Then will the lady's trouble cease,  
Then will her heart have joy and peace,  
When wandering in the wood I wear  
Deerskin, and bark, and matted hair.  
Nor shall by me his heart be grieved  
Whose choice approved, whose mind conceived  
This counsel which I follow. No,  
Forth to the forest will I go.  
'Tis Fate, Sumitrás son, confess,  
That sends me to the wilderness.  
'Tis Fate alone that gives away  
To'other hands the royal sway  
How could Kaikeyí's purpose bring  
On me this pain and suffering,  
Were not her change of heart decreed  
By Fate whose will commands the deed?  
I know my filial love has been  
The same throughout for every queen,  
And with the same affection she  
Has treated both her son and me.  
Her shameful words of cruel spite  
To stay the consecrating rite,  
And drive me banished from the throne,--  
These I ascribe to Fate alone,  
How could she, born of royal race,  
Whom nature decks with fairest grace,  
Speak like a dame of low degree  
Before the king to torture me?  
But Fate, which none may comprehend,  
To which all life must bow and bend,  
In her and me its power has shown,  
And all my hopes are overthrown.  
What man, Sumitrá's darling, may  
Contend with Fate's resistless sway,  
Whose all-commanding power we find  
Our former deeds alone can bind?  
Our life and death, our joy and pain,  
Anger and fear, and loss and gain,  
Each thing that is, in every state,  
All is the work of none but Fate.  
E'en saints, inspired with rigid zeal.  
When once the stroke of Fate they feel,  
In sternest vows no more engage,  
And fall enslaved by love and rage.  
So now the sudden stroke whose weight  
Descends unlooked for, comes of Fate,  
And with unpitying might destroys  
The promise of commencing joys.  
Weigh this true counsel in thy soul:  
With thy firm heart thy heart control;  
Then, brother, thou wilt cease to grieve  
For hindered rites which now I leave.  
So cast thy needless grief away,  
And strictly my commands obey.  
Those preparations check with speed,  
Nor let my throning rites proceed.  
Those urns that stand prepared to shed  
King-making drops upon my head,  
Shall, with their pure lustrations now  
Inaugurate my hermit's vow.  

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>  

Yet what have I to do with things  
That touch the state and pomp of kings?  
These hands of mine shall water take  
To sanctify the vow I make.  
Now Lakshman, let thy heart no more  
My fortune changed and lost deplore.  
A forest life more joys may bring  
Than those that wait upon a king,  
Now though her arts successful mar  
     My consecrating rite,  
   Let not the youngest queen too far  
     Thy jealous fear excite.  
   Nor let one thought suggesting ill  
     Upon our father fall,  
   But let thy heart remember still  
     That Fate is lord of all.'
