<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLV.: THE SEVEN DEFEATED.</H3>
<P>
Forth went the seven in brave attire,<BR>
In glory brilliant as the fire.<BR>
Impetuous chiefs with massive bows,<BR>
The quellers of a host of foes:<BR>

<P>

<P>
Trained from their youth in martial lore,<BR>
And masters of the arms they bore:<BR>
Each emulous and fiercely bold,<BR>
And banners wrought with glittering gold<BR>
Waved o'er their chariots, drawn at speed<BR>
By coursers of the noblest breed.<BR>
On through the ruins of the grove<BR>
At Hannm&aacute;n they fiercely drove,<BR>
And from the ponderous bows they strained<BR>
A shower of deadly arrows rained.<BR>
Then scarce was seen the V&aacute;nar's form<BR>
Enveloped in the arrowy storm.<BR>
So stands half veiled the Mountains' King<BR>
When rainy clouds about him cling.<BR>
By nimble turn, by rapid bound<BR>
He shunned the shafts that rained around,<BR>
Eluding, as in air he rose.<BR>
The rushing chariots of his foes,<BR>
The mighty V&aacute;nar undismayed<BR>
Amid his archer foemen played,<BR>
As plays the frolic wind on high<BR>
Mid bow-armed &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="ry384.htm#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> clouds that fill the sky,<BR>
He raised a mighty roar and yell<BR>
That fear on all the army fell,<BR>
And then, his warrior soul aglow<BR>
With fury, rushed upon the foe,<BR>
Some with his open hand he beat<BR>
To death and trampled with his feet;<BR>
Some with fierce nails he rent and slew,<BR>
And others with his fists o'erthrew;<BR>
Some with his legs, as on he rushed,<BR>
Some with his bulky chest he crushed:<BR>
While some struck senseless by his roar<BR>
Dropped on the ground and breathed no more.<BR>
The remnant, seized with sudden dread,<BR>
Turned from the grove and wildly fled.<BR>
The trampled earth was thickly strown<BR>
With steed and car and flag o'erthrown,<BR>
And the red blood in rivers flowed<BR>
From slaughtered fiends o'er path and road.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_882"></A><A HREF="ry382.htm#fr_882">419:1</A>  We were told a few lines before that
the chariot of Jambumah was drawn by
asses. Here horses are spoken of. The
Commentator notices the discrepancy and
says that by horses asses are meant.</P>
