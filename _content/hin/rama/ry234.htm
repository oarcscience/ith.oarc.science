<P>
'Hear me, M&aacute;r&iacute;cha, while I speak,<BR>
And tell thee why thy home I seek.<BR>
Sick and distressed am I, and see<BR>
My surest hope and help in thee.<BR>
Of Janasth&aacute;n I need not tell,<BR>
Where S&uacute;rpanakh&aacute;, Khara dwell,<BR>
And D&uacute;shan with the arm of might.<BR>
And Tris'iras, the fierce in fight,<BR>
Who feeds on human flesh and gore,<BR>
And many noble giants more,<BR>
Who roam in dark of midnight through<BR>
The forest, brave and strong and true.<BR>
By my command they live at ease<BR>
And slaughter saints and devotees.<BR>
Those twice seven thousand giants, all<BR>
Obedient to their captain's call,<BR>
Joying in war and ruthless deeds<BR>
Follow where mighty Khara leads.<BR>
Those fearless warrior bands who roam<BR>
Through Janasth&aacute;n their forest home,<BR>
In all their terrible array<BR>
Met R&aacute;ma in the battle fray.<BR>
Girt with all weapons forth they sped<BR>
With Khara at the army's head.<BR>
The front of battle R&aacute;ma held:<BR>
With furious wrath his bosom swelled.<BR>
Without a word his hate to show<BR>
He launched the arrows from his bow.<BR>
On the fierce hosts the missiles came,<BR>
Each burning with destructive flame,<BR>
The twice seven thousand fell o'erthrown<BR>
By him, a man, on foot, alone.<BR>
Khara the army's chief and pride,<BR>
And D&uacute;shan, fearless warrior, died,<BR>
And Trisiras the fierce was slain,<BR>
And Dandak wood was free again.<BR>

<P>
He, banished by his angry sire.<BR>
Roams with his wife in mean attire.<BR>
This wretch, his Warrior tribe's disgrace<BR>
Has slain the best of giant race.<BR>

<P>
Harsh, wicked, fierce and greedy-souled,<BR>
A fool, with senses uncontrolled,<BR>
No thought of duty stirs his breast:<BR>
He joys to see the world distressed.<BR>
He sought the wood with fair pretence<BR>
Of truthful life and innocence,<BR>
But his false hand my sister left<BR>
Mangled, of nose and ears bereft.<BR>
This R&aacute;ma's wife who bears the name<BR>
Of S&iacute;t&aacute;, in her face and frame<BR>
Fair as a daughter of the skies,--<BR>
Her will I seize and bring the prize<BR>
Triumphant from the forest shade:<BR>
For this I seek thy willing aid<BR>
If  thou, O mighty one, wilt lend<BR>
Thy help and stand beside thy friend,<BR>
I with my brothers may defy<BR>
All Gods embattled in the sky.<BR>
Come, aid me now, for thine the power<BR>
To succour in the doubtful hour.<BR>
Thou art in war and time of fear,<BR>
For heart and hand, without a peer.<BR>
For thou art skilled in art and wile,<BR>
A warrior brave and trained in guile.<BR>
With this one hope, this only aim,<BR>
O Rover of the Night, I came.<BR>
Now let me tell what aid I ask<BR>
To back me in my purposed task.<BR>
In semblance of a golden deer<BR>
Adorned with silver spots appear.<BR>
Go, seek his dwelling: in the way<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma and his consort stray.<BR>
Doubt not the lady, when she sees<BR>
The wondrous deer amid the trees,<BR>
Will bid her lord and Lakshman take<BR>
The creature for its beauty's sake.<BR>
Then when the chiefs have parted thence,<BR>
And left her lone, without defence,<BR>
As R&aacute;hu storms the moonlight, I<BR>
Will seize the lovely dame and fly.<BR>
Her lord will waste away and weep<BR>
For her his valour could not keep.<BR>
Then boldly will I strike the blow<BR>
And wreak my vengeance on the foe.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When wise M&aacute;r&iacute;cha heard the tale<BR>
His heart grew faint, his cheek was pale,<BR>
He stared with open orbs, and tried<BR>
To moisten lips which terror dried,<BR>
And grief, like death, his bosom rent<BR>
As on the king his look he bent.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The monarch's will he strove to stay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Distracted with alarm,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  For well he knew the might that lay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    In R&aacute;ma's matchless arm.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With suppliant hands Mar&iacute;cha stood<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And thus began to tell<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His counsel for the tyrant's good,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And for his own as well.<BR>
