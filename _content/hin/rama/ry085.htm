<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO VII.: MANTHAR&Aacute;'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
It chanced a slave-born handmaid, bred<BR>
With Queen Kaikey&iacute;, fancy-fed,<BR>
Mounted the stair and stood upon<BR>
The terrace like the moon that shone.<BR>
Thence Manthar&aacute; at ease surveyed<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute; to her eyes displayed,<BR>
Where water cooled the royal street,<BR>
Where heaps of flowers were fresh and sweet,<BR>
And costly flags and pennons hung<BR>
On roof and tower their shadow flung;<BR>
With covered ways prepared in haste,<BR>
And many an awning newly placed;<BR>
With sandal-scented streams bedewed,<BR>
Thronged by a new bathed multitude:<BR>
Whose streets were full of Br&aacute;hman bands<BR>
With wreaths and sweetmeats in their hands.<BR>
Loud instruments their music raised,<BR>
And through the town, where'er she gazed,<BR>
The doors of temples glittered white,<BR>
And the maid marvelled at the sight.<BR>

<P>
Of R&aacute;ma's nurse who, standing by,<BR>
Gazed with a joy-expanded eye,<BR>
In robes of purest white attired,<BR>
The wondering damsel thus inquired:<BR>

<P>
'Does R&aacute;ma's mother give away<BR>
Rich largess to the crowds to-day,<BR>
On some dear object fondly bent,<BR>
Or blest with measureless content?<BR>
What mean these signs of rare delight<BR>
On every side that meet my sight?<BR>
Say, will the king with joy elate<BR>
Some happy triumph celebrate?'<BR>

<P>
The nurse, with transport uncontrolled,<BR>
Her glad tale to the hump-back told:<BR>
'Our lord the king to-morrow morn<BR>
Will consecrate his eldest-born,<BR>
And raise, in Pushya's favouring hour,<BR>
Prince R&aacute;ma to the royal power.'<BR>
As thus the nurse her tidings spoke,<BR>
Rage in the hump-back's breast awoke.<BR>
Down from the terrace, like the head<BR>
Of high Kail&aacute;sa's hill, she sped.<BR>
Sin in her thoughts, her soul aflame,<BR>
Where Queen Kaikey&iacute; slept, she came:<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
'Why sleepest thou?' she cried, 'arise,<BR>
Peril is near, unclose thine eyes.<BR>
Ah, heedless Queen, too blind to know<BR>
Wnat floods of sin above thee flow!<BR>
Thy boasts of love and grace are o'er:<BR>
Thine is the show and nothing more.<BR>
His favour is an empty cheat,<BR>
A torrent dried by summer's heat.'<BR>

<P>
Thus by the artful maid addressed<BR>
In cruel words from raging breast,<BR>
The queen, sore troubled, spoke in turn;<BR>
'What evil news have I to learn?<BR>
That mournful eye, that altered cheek<BR>
Of sudden woe or danger speak.'<BR>

<P>
Such were the words Kaikey&iacute; said:<BR>
Then Manthar&aacute;, her eyeballs red<BR>
With fury, skilled with treacherous art<BR>
To grieve yet more her lady's heart,<BR>
From R&aacute;ma, in her wicked hate,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;'s love to alienate,<BR>
Upon her evil purpose bent<BR>
Began again most eloquent:<BR>
'Peril awaits thee swift and sure,<BR>
And utter woe defying cure;<BR>
King Das'aratha will create<BR>
Prince R&aacute;ma Heir Associate.<BR>
Plunged in the depths of wild despair,<BR>
My soul a prey to pain and care,<BR>
As though the flames consumed me, zeal<BR>
Has brought me for my lady's weal,<BR>
Thy grief, my Queen, is grief to me:<BR>
Thy gain my greatest gain would be.<BR>
Proud daughter of a princely line,<BR>
The rights of consort queen are thine.<BR>
How art thou, born of royal race,<BR>
Blind to the crimes that kings debase!<BR>
Thy lord is gracious, to deceive,<BR>
And flatters, but thy soul to grieve,<BR>
While thy pure heart that thinks no sin<BR>
Knows not the snares that hem thee in.<BR>
Thy husband's lips on thee bestow<BR>
Soft soothing word, an empty show:<BR>
The wealth, the substance, and the power<BR>
This day will be Kaus'aly&aacute;'s dower.<BR>
With crafty soul thy child he sends<BR>
To dwell among thy distant friends,<BR>
And, every rival far from sight,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma gives the power and might.<BR>
Ah me! for thou, unhappy dame,<BR>
Deluded by a husband's name,<BR>
With more than mother's love hast pressed<BR>
A serpent to thy heedless breast,<BR>
And cherished him who works thee woe,<BR>
No husband but a deadly foe.<BR>
For like a snake, unconscious Queen,<BR>
Or enemy who stabs unseen,<BR>
King Das'aratha all untrue<BR>
Has dealt with thee and Bharat too.<BR>
Ah, simple lady, long beguiled<BR>
By his soft words who falsely smiled!<BR>
Poor victim of the guileless breast,<BR>
A happier fate thou meritest.<BR>
For thee and thine destruction waits<BR>
When he Prince R&aacute;ma consecrates.<BR>
Up, lady, while there yet is time;<BR>
Preserve thyself, prevent the crime.<BR>
Up, from thy careless ease, and free<BR>
Thyself, O Queen, thy son, and me!'<BR>

<P>
Delighted at the words she said,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; lifted from the bed,<BR>
Like autumn's moon, her radiant head,<BR>
And joyous at the tidings gave<BR>
A jewel to the hump-back slave;<BR>
And as she gave the precious toy<BR>
She cried in her exceeding joy:<BR>
'Take this, dear maiden, for thy news<BR>
Most grateful to mine ear, and choose<BR>
What grace beside most fitly may<BR>
The welcome messenger repay.<BR>
I joy that R&aacute;ma gains the throne:<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;'s son is as mine own.'<BR>
