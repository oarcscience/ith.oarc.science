<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LI.: LAKSHMAN'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
As Lakshman still his vigil held<BR>
By unaffected love impelled,<BR>
Guha, whose heart the sight distressed,<BR>
With words like these the prince addressed:<BR>
'Beloved youth, this pleasant bed<BR>
Was brought for thee, for thee is spread;<BR>
On this, my Prince, thine eyelids close,<BR>
And heal fatigue with sweet repose.<BR>
My men are all to labour trained,<BR>
But hardship thou hast ne'er sustained.<BR>
All we this night our watch will keep<BR>
And guard Kakutstha's son asleep,<BR>
In all the world there breathes not one<BR>
More dear to me than Raghu's son.<BR>
The words I speak, heroic youth.<BR>
Are true: I swear it by my truth.<BR>
Through his dear grace supreme renown<BR>
Will, so I trust, my wishes crown.<BR>
So shall my life rich store obtain<BR>
Of merit, blest with joy and gain.<BR>
While Raghu's son and S&iacute;t&aacute; lie<BR>
Entranced in happy slumber, I<BR>
Will, with my trusty bow in hand,<BR>
Guard my dear friend with all my band.<BR>
To me, who oft these forests range,<BR>
ls naught therein or new or strange.<BR>
We could with equal might oppose<BR>
A four-fold army led by foes.'<BR>

<P>
Then royal Lakshman made reply:<BR>
'With thee to stand as guardian nigh,<BR>
Whose faithful soul regards the right,<BR>
Fearless we well might rest to-night.<BR>
But how, when R&aacute;ma lays his head<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; on his lowly bed,--<BR>
How can I sleep? how can I care<BR>
For life, or aught that's bright and fair?<BR>
Behold the conquering chief, whose might<BR>
Is match for Gods and fiends in fight;<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; now he rests his bead<BR>
Asleep on grass beneath him spread.<BR>
Won by devotion, text, and prayer.<BR>
And many a rite performed with care.<BR>
Chief of our father's sons he shines<BR>
Well marked, like him, with favouring signs.<BR>
Brief, brief the monarch's life will be<BR>
Now his dear son is forced to flee;<BR>
And quickly will the widowed state<BR>
Mourn for her lord disconsolate.<BR>
Each mourner there has wept her fill;<BR>
The cries of anguish now are still:<BR>
In the king's hall each dame, o'ercome<BR>
With wearines of woe is dumb.<BR>
This first sad night of grief, I ween,<BR>
Will do to death each sorrowing queen:<BR>
Scarce is Kaus'aly&aacute; left alive;<BR>
My mother, too, can scarce survive.<BR>
If when her heart is fain to break,<BR>
She lingers for S'atrughna's sake,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; mother of the chief,<BR>
Must sink beneath the chilling grief,<BR>
That town which countless thousands fill,<BR>
Whose hearts with love of R&aacute;ma thrill,--<BR>
The world's delight, so rich and fair,--<BR>
Grieved for the king, his death will share.<BR>
The hopes he fondly cherished, crossed.<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;'s throne to Rama lost,--<BR>
With mournful cries. Too late, too late!<BR>
The king my sire will meet his fate.<BR>
And when my sire has passed away,<BR>
Most happy in their lot are they,<BR>
Allowed, with every pious care,<BR>
Part in his funeral rites to bear.<BR>
And O, may we with joy at last,--<BR>
These years of forest exile past,--<BR>
Turn to Ayodhy&aacute;'s town to dwell<BR>
With him who keeps his promise well.'<BR>

<P>
While thus the hero mighty-souled,<BR>
In wild lament his sorrow told,<BR>
Faint with the load that on him lay,<BR>
The hours of darkness passed away.<BR>
As thus the prince, impelled by zeal<BR>
For his loved brother, prompt to feel<BR>
Strong yearnings for the people's weal,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His words of truth outspake,<BR>
King Guha grieved to see his woe.<BR>
Heart-stricken, gave his tears to flow,<BR>
Tormented by the common blow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sad, as a wounded snake.<BR>
