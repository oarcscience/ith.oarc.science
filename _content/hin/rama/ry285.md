### CANTO XI.: DUNDUBHI.

'I doubt not, Prince, thy peerless might,  
Armed with these shafts so keen and bright,  
Like all-destroying fires of fate,  
The worlds could burn and devastate.  
But lend thou first thy mind and ear  
Of Báli's power and might to hear.  
How bold, how firm, in battle tried,  
Is Báli's heart; and then decide.  
From east to west, from south to north  
On restless errand hunting forth,  

From farthest sea to sea he flies  
Before the sun has lit the skies.  
A mountain top he oft will seek.  
Tear from its root a towering peak.  
Hurl it aloft, as 'twere a ball,  
And catch it ere to earth it fall.  
And many a tree that long has stood  
In health and vigour in the wood,  
His single arm to earth will throw,  
The marvels of his might to show.  
Shaped like a bull, a monster bore  
The name of Dundubhi of yore:  
He matched in size a mountain height,  
A thousand elephants in might.  
By pride of wondrous gifts impelled,  
And strength he deemed unparalleled,  
To Ocean, lord of stream and brook,  
Athirst for war, his way he took.  
He reached the king of rolling waves  
Whose gems are piled in sunless caves,  
And threw his challenge to the sea;  
'Come forth, O King, and fight with me.'  
He spoke, and from his ocean bed  
The righteous  <span id="fr_568"></span>[1](#fn_568) monarch heaved his
head,  
And gave, sedate, his calm reply  
To him whom fate impelled to die:  
'Not mine, not mine the power,' he cried,  
'To cope with thee in battle tried;  
But listen to my voice, and seek  
The worthier foe of whom I speak.  
The Lord of Hills, where hermits live  
And love the home his forests give,  
Whose child is S'ankar's darling queen,  <span
id="fr_569"></span>[2](#fn_569)  
The King of Snows is he I mean.  
Deep caves has he, and dark boughs shade  
The torrent and the wild cascade.  
From him expect the fierce delight  
Which heroes feel in equal fight.'  
He deemed that fear checked ocean's king,  
And, like an arrow from the string,  
To the wild woods that clothe the side  
Of Lord Himálaya's hills he hied.  
Then Dundubhi, with hideous roar.  
Huge fragments from the summit tore  
Vast as Airávat,  <span id="fr_570"></span>[3](#fn_570) white with
snow,  
And hurled them to the plains below.  
Then like a white cloud soft, serene.  
The Lord of Mountains' form was seen.  
It sat upon a lofty crest.  
And thus the furious fiend addressed:  
'Beseems thee not, O virtue's friend,  
My mountain tops to rive and rend;  

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>  

For I, the hermit's calm retreat,  
For deeds of war am all unmeet,'  
   The demon's eye with rage grew red,  
And thus in furious tone he said:  
'If thou from fear or sloth decline  
To match thy strength in war with mine,  
Where shall I find a champion, say,  
To meet me burning for the fray?'  
He spoke: Himálaya, skilled in lore  
Of eloquence, replied once more,  
And, angered in his righteous mind,  
Addressed the chief of demon kind:  
'The Vánar Báli, brave and wise,  
Son of the God who rules the sides, <span
id="fr_571"></span>[1](#fn_571)  
Sways, glorious in his high renown,  
Kishkindhá his imperial town.  
Well may that valiant lord who knows  
Each art of war his might oppose  
To thine, in equal battle set,  
As Namuehi  <span id="fr_572"></span>[2](#fn_572) and Indra met.  
Go, if thy soul desire the fray;  
To Báli's city speed away,  
And that uoconquered hero meet  
Whose fame is high for warlike feat.'  
He listened to the Lord of Snow,  
And, his proud heart with rage aglow,  
Sped swift away and lighted down  
By vast Kishkindhá, Báli's town.  
With pointed horns to strike and gore  
The semblance of a bull he bore,  
Huge as a cloud that downward bends  
Ere the full flood of rain descends.  
Impelled by pride and rage and hate,  
He thundered at Kishkindhá's gate;  
And with his bellowing, like the sound  
Of pealing drums, he shook the ground,  
He rent the earth and prostrate threw  
The trees that near the portal grew.  
King Báli from the bowers within  
Indignant heard the roar and din.  
Then, moonlike mid the stars, with all  
His dames he hurried to the wall;  
And to the fiend this speech, expressed  
In clear and measured words, addressed:  
'Know me for monarch. Báli styled,  
Of Vánar tribes that roam the wild.  
Say why dost thou this gate molest,  
And bellowing thus disturb our rest?  
I know thee, mighty fiend: beware  
And guard thy life with wiser care.'  
He spoke: and thus the fiend returned,  
While red with rage his eyeballs burned:  
'What! speak when all thy dames are nigh  
And hero-like thy foe defy?  

Come, meet me in the fight this day,  
And learn my strength by bold assay.  
Or shall I spare tbee, and relent  
Until the coming night be spent?  
Take then the respite of a night  
And yield thee to each soft delight.  
Then, monarch of the Vánar race.  
With loving arms thy friends embrace.  
Gifts on thy faithful lords bestow,  
Bid each and all farewell, and go.  
Show in the streets once more thy face,  
Instal thy son to fill thy place.  
Dally a while with each dear dame;  
And then my strength thy pride shall tame  
For, should I smite thee drunk with wine  
Enamoured of those dames of thine,  
Beneath diseases bowed and bent,  
Or weak, unarmed, or negligent,  
My deed would merit hate and scorn  
As his who slays the child unborn.'  
Then Báli's soul with rage was tired,  
Queen Tárá and the dames retired;  
And slowly, with a laugh of pride,  
The king of Vánars thus replied:  
'Me, fiend, thou deemest drunk with wine:  
Unless thy fear the fight decline,  
Come, meet me in the fray, and test  
The spirit of my valiant breast.'  
He spoke in wrath and high disdain;  
And, laying down his golden chain,  
Gift of his sire Mahendra, dared  
The demon, for the fray prepared;  
Seized by the horns the monster, vast  
As a huge hill, and held him fast,  
Then fiercely dragged him round and round,  
And, shouting, hurled him to the ground.  
Blood streaming from his ears, he rose,  
And wild with fury strove the foes.  
Then Báli, match for Indra's might,  
With every arm renewed the fight.  
He fought with fists, and feet, and knees,  
With fragments of the rock, and trees.  
At last the monster's strength, assailed  
By S'akra's  <span id="fr_573"></span>[1b](#fn_573) conquering
offspring, failed.  
Him Bali raised with mighty strain.  
And dashed upon the ground again;  
Where, bruised and shattered, in a tide  
Of rushing blood, the demon died.  
King Báli saw the lifeless corse,  
And bending, with tremendous force  
Raised the huge bulk from where it lay,  
And hurled it full a league away.  
As through the air the body flew,  
Some blood-drops, caught by gales that blew,  
Welled from his shattered jaw and fell  
By Saint Matanga's hermit cell:  
Matanga saw, illustrious sage,  
Those drops defile his hermitage,  

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>  

And, as he marvelled whence they came,  
Fierce anger filled his soul with flame:  
'Who is the villain, evil-souled,  
With childish thoughts unwise and bold,  
Who is the impious wretch,' he cried,  
'By whom my grove with blood is dyed?'  

Thus spoke Matanga in his rage,  
And hastened from the hermitage,  
When lo, before his wondering eyes  
Lay the dead bull of mountain size  
His hermit soul was nothing slow  
The doer of the deed to know,  
And thus the Vánar in a burst  
Of wild tempestuous wrath he cursed:  
'Ne'er let that Vánar wander here,  
For, if he come, his death is near.  
Whose impious hand with blood has dyed  
The holy place where I abide,  
Who threw this demon corse and made  
A ruin of the pleasant shade.  
If e'er he plant his wicked feet  
Within one league of my retreat;  
Yea, if the villain come so nigh  
That very hour he needs must die.  
And let the Vánar lords who dwell  
In the dark woods that skirt my cell  
Obey my words, and speeding hence  
Find them some meeter residence.  
Here if they dare to stay, on all  
The terrors of my curse shall fall.  
They spoil the tender saplings, dear  
As children which I cherish here,  
Mar root and branch and leaf and spray,  
And steal the ripening fruit away.  
One day I grant, no further hour,  
To-morrow shall my curse have power,  
And then each Vánar I may see  
A stone through countless years shall be.'  
The Vánars heard the curse and hied  
From sheltering wood and mountain side.  
King Báli marked their haste and dread,  
And to the flying leaders said:  
'Speak, Vánar chiefs, and tell me why  
From Saint Matanga's grove ye fly  
To gather round me: is it well  
With all who in those woodlands dwell?'  
He spoke: the Vánar leaders told  
King Báli with his chain of gold  
What curse the saint had on them laid,  
Which drove them from their ancient shade.  
Then royal Báli sought the sage,  
With reverent hands to soothe his rage.  
The holy man his suppliant spurned,  
And to his cell in anger turned.  
That curse on Báli sorely pressed.  
And long his conscious soul distressed.  
Him still the curse and terror keep  
Afar from Rishyamúka's steep.  
He dares not to the grove draw nigh,  
Nay scarce will hither turn his eye.  
We know what terrors warm him hence,  
And roam these woods in confidence.  
Look, Prince, before thee white and dry  
The demon's bones uncovered lie,  
Who, like a hill in bulk and length,  
Fell ruind for his pride of strength.  
See those high Sál trees seven in row  
That droop their mighty branches low,  
These at one grasp would Báli seize,  
And leafless shake the trembling trees.  
These tales I tell, O Prince, to show  
The matchless power that arms the foe.  
How canst thou hope to slay him? how  
Meet Báli in the battle now?'  

Sugríva spoke and sadly sighed:  
And Lakshman with a laugh replied:  
'What show of power, what proof and test  
May still the doubts that fill thy breast?'  

He spoke. Sugríva thus replied:  
'See yonder Sál trees side by side.  
King Báli here would take his stand  
Grasping his bow with vigorous hand,  
And every arrow, keen and true.  
Would strike its tree and pierce it through  
If Ráma now his bow will bend,  
And through one trunk an arrow send;  
Or if his arm can raise and throw  
Two hundred measures of his bow,  
Grasped by a foot and hurled through air,  
The demon bull that moulders there,  
My heart will own his might and fain  
Believe my foe already slain.'  

Sugríva spoke inflamed with ire,  
Scanned Ráma with a glance of fire,  
Pondered a while in silent mood.  
And thus again his speech renewed:  
'All lands with Báli's glories ring,  
A valiant, strong, and mighty king;  
In conscious power unused to yield;  
A hero first in every field.  
His wondrous deeds his might declare,  
Deeds Gods might scarcely do or dare;  
And on this power reflecting still  
I roam on Rishyamúka's hill.  
Awed by my brother's might I rove,  
In doubt and fear, from grove to grove,  
While Hanumán, my chosen friend,  
And faithful lords my steps attend;  
And now, O true to friendship's tie,  
I hail in thee my best ally.  
My surest refuge from my foes,  
And steadfast as the Lord of Snows.  
Still, when I muse how strong and bold  
Is cruel Báli, evil-souled,  
But ne'er, O chief of Raghu's line,  
Have seen what strength in war is thine,  
Though in my heart I may not dare  
Doubt thy great might, despise, compare,  
Thoughts of his fearful deeds will rise  
And fill my soul with sad surmise.  
Speech, form, and trust which naught may move  

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>  

Thy secret strength and glory prove,  
As smouldering ashes dimly show  
The dormant fires that live below.'  
   He ceased: and Ráma answered, while  
Played o'er his lips a gracious smile:  
'Not yet convinced? This clear assay  
Shall drive each lingering doubt away.'  
Thus Ráma spoke his heart to cheer,  
To Dundubhi's vast frame drew near:  
He touched it with his foot in play  
And sent it twenty leagues away.  
Sugríva marked what easy force  
Hurled through the air that demon's corse  
Whose mighty bones were white and dried,  
And to the son of Raghu cried:  
'My brother Báli, when his might  
Was drunk and weary from the fight,  
Hurled forth the monster body, fresh  
With skin and sinews, blood and flesh.  
Now flesh and blood are dried away.  
The crumbling bones are light as hay,  
Which thou, O Raghu's son, hast sent  
Flying through air in merriment.  
This test alone is weak to show  
If thou be stronger or the foe.  
By thee a heap of mouldering bone,  
By him the recent corse was thrown.  
Thy strength, O Prince, is yet untried:  
Come, pierce one tree: let this decide.  
Prepare thy ponderous bow and bring  
Close to thine ear the straining string.  
On yonder Sál tree fix thine eye,  
And let the mighty arrow fly,  
I doubt not, chief, that I shall see  
Thy pointed shaft transfix the tree.  
Then come, assay the easy task,  
And do for love the thing I ask.  
   Best of all lights, the Day-God fills  
     With glory earth and sky:  
   Himálaya is the lord of hills  
     That heave their heads on high.  
   The royal lion is the best  
     Of beasts that tread the earth;  
   And thou, O hero, art confessed  
     First in heroic worth.'
