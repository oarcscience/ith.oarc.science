<P>
Shouts of triumphant joy outrang<BR>
As to their feet the V&aacute;nars sprang:<BR>
And, on the mighty task intent,<BR>
Swift to the sea their steps they bent.<BR>
They stood and gazed upon the deep,<BR>
Whose billows with a roar and leap<BR>
On the sea banks ware wildly hurled,--<BR>
The mirror of the mighty world.<BR>
There on the strand the V&aacute;nars stayed<BR>
And with sad eyes the deep surveyed,<BR>
Here, as in play, his billows rose,<BR>
And there he slumbered in repose.<BR>
Here leapt the boisterous waters, high<BR>
As mountains, menacing the sky,<BR>
And wild infernal forms between<BR>
The ridges of the waves were seen.<BR>

<P>
They saw the billows rave and swell,<BR>
And their sad spirits sank and fell;<BR>
For ocean in their deep despair<BR>
Seemed boundless as the fields of air.<BR>
Then noble Angad spake to cheer<BR>
The V&aacute;nars and dispel their fear:<BR>
'Faint not: despair should never find<BR>
Admittance to a noble mind.<BR>
Despair, a serpent's mortal bite,<BR>
Benumbs the hero's power and might.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then passed the weary night, and all<BR>
Assembled at their prince's call,<BR>
And every lord of high estate<BR>
Was gathered round him for debate.<BR>
Bright was the chieftains' glorious band<BR>
Round Angad on the ocean strand,<BR>
As when the mighty Storm-Gods meet<BR>
Round Indra on his golden seat.<BR>
Then princely Angad looked on each,<BR>
And thus began his prudent speech:<BR>
'What chief of all our host will leap<BR>
A hundred leagues across the deep?<BR>
Who, O illustrious V&aacute;nars, who<BR>
Will make Sugriva's promise true,<BR>
And from our weight of fear set free<BR>
The leaders of our band and me!<BR>
To whom, O warriors, shall we owe<BR>
A sweet release from pain and woe,<BR>
And proud success, and happy lives<BR>
With our dear children and our wives,<BR>
Again permitted by his grace<BR>
To look with joy on R&aacute;ma's face,<BR>
And noble Lakshman, and our lord<BR>
The king, to our sweet homes restored?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus to the gathered lords he spoke;<BR>
But no reply the silence broke.<BR>
Then with a sterner voice he cried:<BR>
'O chiefs, the nation's boast and pride,<BR>
Whom valour strength and power adorn,<BR>
Of most illustrious lineage born,<BR>
Where'er you wilt you force a way,<BR>
And none your rapid course can stay.<BR>
Now come, your several powers declare.<BR>
And who this desperate leap will dare?<BR>
