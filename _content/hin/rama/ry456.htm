<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LX.: KUMBHAKARN'A ROUSED.</H3>
<P>
With humbled heart and broken pride<BR>
Through L&aacute;nka's gate the giant hied,<BR>
Crushed, like an elephant beneath<BR>
A lion's spring and murderous teeth,<BR>
Or like a serpent neath the wing<BR>
And talons of the Feathered King.<BR>
Such was the giant's wild alarm<BR>
At arrows shot by R&aacute;ma's arm;<BR>
Shafts with red lightning round them curled,<BR>
Like Brahm&aacute;'s bolts that end the world.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Supported on his golden throne,<BR>
With failing eye and humbled tone,<BR>
'Giants,' he cried, 'the toil is vain,<BR>
Fruitless the penance and the pain,<BR>
If I whom Indra owned his peer,<BR>
Secure from Gods, a mortal fear.<BR>
My soul remembers, now too late,<BR>
Lord Brahm&aacute;'s words which spoke my fate:<BR>
'Tremble, proud Giant,' thus they ran,<BR>
'And dread thy death from slighted man.<BR>
Secure from Gods and demons live,<BR>
And serpents, by the boon I give.<BR>
Against their power thy life is charmed,<BR>
But against man is still unarmed,'<BR>
This R&aacute;ma is the man foretold<BR>
By Anaranra's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_982"></A><A HREF="#fn_982"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> lips of old:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Fear, R&aacute;van', basest of the base:<BR>
For of mine own imperial race<BR>
A prince in after time shall spring<BR>
And thee and thine to ruin bring.<BR>
And Vedavat&iacute;, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_983"></A><A HREF="#fn_983"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> ere she died<BR>
Slain by my ruthless insult, cried:<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_473"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 473</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
'A scion of my royal line<BR>
Shall slay, vile wretch, both thee and thine.'<BR>
She in a later birth became<BR>
King Janak's child, now R&aacute;ma's dame.<BR>
Nandis'vara &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_984"></A><A HREF="#fn_984"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> foretold this fate,<BR>
And Um&aacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_985"></A><A HREF="#fn_985"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> when I moved her hate,<BR>
And Rambh&aacute;, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_986"></A><A HREF="#fn_986"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the lovely child<BR>
Of Varun &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_987"></A><A HREF="#fn_987"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> by thy touch defiled.<BR>
I know the fated hour is nigh:<BR>
Hence, captains, to your stations fly.<BR>
Let warders on the rampart stand:<BR>
Place at each gate a watchful band;<BR>
And, terror of immortal eyes,<BR>
Let mightiest Kumbhakarna rise.<BR>
He, slumbering, free from care and pain,<BR>
By Brahm&aacute;'s curse, for months has lain.<BR>
But when Prahasta's death he hears,<BR>
Mine own defeat and doubts and fears,<BR>
The chief will rise to smite the foe<BR>
And his unrivalled valour show.<BR>
Then Raghu's royal sons and all<BR>
The V&aacute;nars neath his might will fall.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The giant lords his hest obeyed,<BR>
They left him, trembling and afraid,<BR>
And from the royal palace strode<BR>
To Kumbhakarna's vast abode.<BR>
They carried garlands sweet and fresh,<BR>
And reeking loads of blood and flesh.<BR>
They reached the dwelling where he lay,<BR>
A cave that stretched a league each way,<BR>
Sweet with fair blooms of lovely scent<BR>
And bright with golden ornament.<BR>
His breathings came so fierce and fast.<BR>
Scarce could the giants brook the blast.<BR>
They found him on a golden bed<BR>
With his huge limbs at length outspread.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
They piled their heaps of venison near,<BR>
Fat buffaloes and boars and deer.<BR>
With wreaths of flowers they fanned his face,<BR>
And incense sweetened all the place.<BR>
Each raised his mighty voice as loud<BR>
As thunders of an angry cloud,<BR>
And conchs their stirring summons gave<BR>
That echoed through the giant's cave.<BR>
Then on his breast they rained their blows.<BR>
And high the wild commotion rose<BR>
When cymbal vied with drum and horn.<BR>
And war cries on the gale upborne<BR>
Through all the air loud discord spread,<BR>
And, struck with fear, the birds fell dead.<BR>
But still he slept and took his rest.<BR>
Then dashed they on his shaggy chest<BR>
Clubs, maces, fragments of the rock:<BR>
He moved not once, nor felt the shock.<BR>
The giants made one effort more<BR>
With shell and drum and shout and roar.<BR>
Club, mallet, mace, in fury plied,<BR>
Rained blows upon his breast and side,<BR>
And elephants were urged to aid,<BR>
And camels groaned and horses neighed.<BR>
They drenched him with a hundred pails,<BR>
They tore his ears with teeth and nails.<BR>
They bound together many a mace<BR>
And beat him on the head and face;<BR>
And elephants with ponderous tread<BR>
Stamped on his limbs and chest and head.<BR>
The unusual weight his slumber broke:<BR>
He started, shook his sides, and woke;<BR>
And, heedless of the wounds and blows,<BR>
Yawning with thirst and hunger rose.<BR>
His jaws like hell gaped fierce and wide,<BR>
Dire as the flame neath ocean's tide.<BR>
Red as the sun on Meru's crest<BR>
The giant's face his wrath expressed,<BR>
And every burning breath he drew<BR>
Was like the blast that rushes through<BR>
The mountain cedars. Up he raised<BR>
His awful head with eyes that blazed<BR>
Like comets, dire as Death in form<BR>
Who threats the worlds with fire and storm.<BR>
The giants pointed to their stores<BR>
Of buffaloes and deer and boars,<BR>
And straight he gorged him with a flood<BR>
Of wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood.<BR>
He ceased: the giants ventured near<BR>
And bent their lowly heads in fear.<BR>
Then Kumbhakarna glared with eyes<BR>
Still heavy in their first surprise,<BR>
Still drowsy from his troubled rest,<BR>
And thus the giant band addressed.<BR>
'How have ye dared my sleep to break?<BR>
No trifling cause should bid me wake.<BR>
Say, is all well? or tell the need<BR>
That drives you with unruly speed<BR>
To wake me. Mark the words I say,<BR>
The king shall tremble in dismay,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_474"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 474</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The fire be quenched and Indra slain<BR>
Ere ye shall break my rest in vain.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yup&aacute;ksha answered: 'Chieftain, hear;<BR>
No God or fiend excites our fear.<BR>
But men in arms our walls assail:<BR>
We tremble lest their might prevail.<BR>
For vengeful R&aacute;ma vows to slay<BR>
The foe who stole his queen away,<BR>
And, matchless for his warlike deeds,<BR>
A host of mighty V&aacute;nars leads.<BR>
Ere now a monstrous V&aacute;nar came.<BR>
Laid Lank&aacute; waste with ruthless flame,<BR>
And Aksha, R&aacute;van's offspring, blew<BR>
With all his warrior retinue.<BR>
Our king who never trembled yet<BR>
For heavenly hosts in battle met.<BR>
At length the general dread has shared,<BR>
O'erthrown by R&aacute;ma's arm and spared.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: and Kumbhakarna spake:<BR>
'I will go forth and vengeance take;<BR>
Will tread their hosts beneath my feet,<BR>
Then triumph-flushed our king will meet.<BR>
Our giant bands shall eat their fill<BR>
Of V&aacute;nars whom this arm shall kill.<BR>
The princes' blood shall be my draught,<BR>
The chieftains' shall by you be quaffed.'<BR>
He spake, and, with an eager stride<BR>
That shook the earth, to R&aacute;van hied,<BR>
