<P>
The monarch, as Kaikeyi pressed<BR>
With cruel words her dire request,<BR>
Stood for a time absorbed in thought<BR>
While anguish in his bosom wrought.<BR>
Does some wild dream my heart assail!<BR>
Or do my troubled senses fail!<BR>
Does some dire portent scare my view?<BR>
Or frenzy's stroke my soul subdue?'<BR>
Thus as he thought, his troubled mind<BR>
In doubt and dread no rest could find,<BR>
Distressed and trembling like a deer<BR>
Who sees the dreaded tigress near.<BR>
On the bare ground his limbs he thres,<BR>
And many a long sigh he drew,<BR>
Like a wild snake, with fury blind,<BR>
By charms within a ring confined.<BR>
Once as the monarch's fury woke,<BR>
'Shame on thee!' from his bosom broke,<BR>
And then in sense-bewildering pain<BR>
He fainted on the ground again.<BR>
At length, when slowly strength returned,<BR>
He answered as his eyeballs burned<BR>
With the wild fury of his ire<BR>
Consuming her, as 'twere, with fire:<BR>
'Fell traitress, thou whose thought design<BR>
The utter ruin of my line,<BR>
What wrong have I or R&aacute;ma done?<BR>
Speak murderess, speak thou wicked one,<BR>
Seeks he not evermore to please<BR>
Thee with all sonlike courtesies?<BR>
By what persuasion art thou led<BR>
To bring this ruin on his head?<BR>
Ah me, that fondly unaware<BR>
I brought thee home my life to snare,<BR>
Called daughter of a king, in truth<BR>
A serpent with a venomed tooth!<BR>
What fault can I pretend to find<BR>
In R&aacute;ma praised by all mankind,<BR>
That I my darling should forsake?<BR>
No, take my life, my glory take:<BR>
Let either queen be from me torn,<BR>
But not my well-loved eldest-born,<BR>
Him but to see is highest bliss,<BR>
And death itself his face to miss.<BR>
The world may sunless stand, the grain<BR>
May thrive without the genial rain,<BR>
But if my R&aacute;ma be no nigh<BR>
My spirit from its frame will fly.<BR>
Enough, thine impious plan forgo,<BR>
O thou who plottest sin and woe.<BR>
My head before my feet, I kneel,<BR>
And pray thee some compassion feel,<BR>
O wicked dame, what can have led<BR>
Thy heart to dare a plot so dread?<BR>
Perchance thy purpose is to sound<BR>
The grace thy son with me has found;<BR>
Perchance the words that, all these days,<BR>
Thou hast said in R&aacute;ma's praise,<BR>
Were only feigned; designed to cheer<BR>
With flatteries a father's ear.<BR>
Soon as thy grief, my Queen, I knew,<BR>
My bosom felt the anguish too.<BR>
In empty halls art thou posessed,<BR>
And subject to anothers' hest?<BR>
Now on Ikshv&aacute;ku's ancient race<BR>
Falls foul disorder and disgrace,<BR>
If thou, O Queen, whose heart so long<BR>
Has loved the good should choose the wrong<BR>
Not once, O large-eyed dame, hast thou<BR>
Been guilty of offence till now,<BR>
Nor said a word to make me grieve,<BR>
Nor will I now thy sin believe.<BR>
With thee my R&aacute;ma used to hold<BR>
Like place with Bharat lofty-souled.<BR>
As thou so ofthe, when the pair<BR>
Were children yet, wouldst fain declare.<BR>
And can thy righteous soul endure<BR>
That R&aacute;ma glorious, pious, pure,<BR>
Should to the distant wilds be sent<BR>
For fourteen years of banishment?<BR>
Yea, R&aacute;ma Bharat's self exceeds<BR>
In love to thee and sonlike deeds,<BR>
And, for deserving love of thee,<BR>
As Bharat, even so is he.<BR>
Who better than that chieftain may<BR>
Obedience, love, and honour pay,<BR>
They dignity with care protect,<BR>
Thy slightest word and wish respect?<BR>
Of all his countless followers none<BR>
Can breathe a word against my son;<BR>
Of many thousands not a dame<BR>
Can hint reproach or whisper blame.<BR>
All creatures feel the sweet control<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma's pure and gentle soul.<BR>
The pride of Manu's race he binds<BR>
To him the people's grateful minds.<BR>
He wins the subjects with his truth,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The poor with gifts and gentle ruth,<BR>
His teachers with his docile will,<BR>
The foemen with his archer skill.<BR>
Truth, purity, religious zeal,<BR>
The hand to give, the heart to feel.<BR>
The love that ne'er betrays a friend,<BR>
The rectitude that naught can bend,<BR>
Knowledge, and meek obedience grace<BR>
My R&aacute;ma pride of Raghu's race.<BR>
Canst thou thine impious plot design<BR>
'Gainst him in whom these virtues shine,<BR>
Whose glory with the sages vies,<BR>
Peer of the Gods who rule the skies!<BR>
From him no harsh or bitter word<BR>
To pain one creature have I heard,<BR>
And how can I my sin address,<BR>
For thee, with words of bitterness?<BR>
Have mercy, Queen: some pity show<BR>
To see my tears of anguish now,<BR>
And listen to my mournful cry,<BR>
A poor old man who soon must die.<BR>
Whate'er this sea-girt land can boast<BR>
Of rich and rare from coast to coast,<BR>
To thee, my Queen, I give it all:<BR>
But O, thy deadly words recall:<BR>
O see, my suppliant hands entreat,<BR>
Again my lips are on thy feet:<BR>
Save R&aacute;ma, save my darling child,<BR>
Nor kill me with this sin defiled.'<BR>
He grovelled on the ground, and lay<BR>
To burning grief a senseless prey,<BR>
And ever and anon, assailed<BR>
By floods of woe he wept and wailed,<BR>
Striving with eager speed to gain<BR>
The margent of his sea of pain.<BR>

<P>
With fiercer words she fiercer yet<BR>
The hapless father's pleading met:<BR>
'O Monarch, if thy soul repent<BR>
The promise and thy free consent,<BR>
How wilt thou in the world maintain<BR>
Thy fame for truth unsmirched with stain?<BR>
When gathered kings with thee converse,<BR>
And bid thee all the tale rehearse.<BR>
What wilt thou say, O truthful King,<BR>
In answer to their questioning?<BR>
'She to whose love my life I owe,<BR>
Who saved me smitten by the foe,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;, for her tender care,<BR>
Was cheated of the oath I sware.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Thus wilt thou answer, and forsworn<BR>
Wilt draw on thee the princes' scorn.<BR>
Learn from that tale, the 'Hawk and Dove,'<BR>
How strong for truth was Saivya's love.<BR>
Pledged by his word the monarch gave<BR>
His flesh the suppliant bird to save.<BR>
So King Alarka gave his eyes,<BR>
And gained a mansion in the skies.<BR>


<P>


<P>
The Sea himself his promise keeps,<BR>
And ne'er beyond his limit sweeps.<BR>
My deeds of old again recall,<BR>
Nor let thy bond dishonoured fall.<BR>
The rights of truth thou wouldst forget<BR>
Thy R&aacute;ma on the throne to set,<BR>
And let thy days in pleasure glide,<BR>
Fond King, Kaus'aly&aacute; by thy side.<BR>
Now call it by what name thou wilt,<BR>
Justice, injustice, virtue, guilt,<BR>
Thy word and oath remain the same,<BR>
And thou must yield what thus I claim.<BR>
If R&aacute;ma be anointed, I<BR>
This very day will surely die,<BR>
Before thy face will poison drink,<BR>
And lifeless at thy feet will sink.<BR>
Yea, better far to die than stay<BR>
Alive to see one single day<BR>
The crowds before Kaus'aly&aacute; stand<BR>
And hail her queen with reverent hand.<BR>
Now by my son, myself, I swear,<BR>
No gift, no promise whatsoe'er<BR>
My steadfast soul shall now content,<BR>
But only R&aacute;ma's banishment.'<BR>

<P>
So far she spake by rage impelled,<BR>
And then the queen deep silence held.<BR>
He heard her speech full fraught with ill,<BR>
But spoke no word bewildered still,<BR>
Gazed on his love once held so dear<BR>
Who spoke unlovely rede to hear;<BR>
Then as he slowly pondered o'er<BR>
The queen's resolve and oath she swore.<BR>
Once sighing forth, Ah R&aacute;ma! he<BR>
Fell prone as falls a smitten tree.<BR>
His senses lost like one insane,<BR>
Faint as a sick man weak with pain,<BR>
Or like a wounded snake dismayed,<BR>
So lay the king whom earth obeyed.<BR>
Long burning sighs he slowly heaved,<BR>
As, conquered by his woe, he grieved,<BR>
And thus with tears and sobs between<BR>
His sad faint words addressed the queen:<BR>

<P>
'By whom, Kaikey&iacute;, wast thou taught<BR>
This flattering hope with ruin fraught?<BR>
Have goblins seized thy soul, O dame,<BR>
Who thus canst speak and feel no shame?<BR>
Thy mind with sin is sicklied o'er,<BR>
From thy first youth ne'er seen before.<BR>
A good and loving wife wast thou,<BR>
But all, alas! is altered now.<BR>
What terror can have seized thy breast<BR>
To make thee frame this dire request,<BR>
That Bharat o'er the land may reign,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma in the woods remain?<BR>
Turn from thine evil ways, O turn,<BR>
And thy perfidious counsel spurn,<BR>
If thou would fain a favour do<BR>
To people, lord, and Bharat too.<BR>
O wicked traitress, fierce and vile,<BR>
Who lovest deeds of sin and guile,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
What crime or grievance dost thou see,<BR>
What fault in R&aacute;ma or in me?<BR>
Thy son will ne'er the throne accept<BR>
If R&aacute;ma from his rights be kept,<BR>
For Bharat's heart more firmly yet<BR>
Than R&aacute;ma's is on justice set.<BR>
How shall I say, Go forth, and brook<BR>
Upon my R&aacute;ma's face to look,<BR>
See his pale cheek and ashy lips<BR>
Dimmed like the moon in sad eclipse?<BR>
How see the plan so well prepared<BR>
When prudent friends my counsels shared,<BR>
All ruined, like a host laid low<BR>
Beneath some foeman's murderous blow?<BR>
What will these gathered princes say,<BR>
From regions near and far away?<BR>
'O'erlong endures the monarch's reign,<BR>
For now he is a child again.'<BR>
When many a good and holy sage<BR>
In Scripture versed, revered for age,<BR>
Shall ask for R&aacute;ma, what shall I<BR>
Unhappy, what shall I reply?<BR>
'By Queen Kaikey&iacute; long distressed<BR>
I drove him forth and dispossessed.'<BR>
Although herein the truth I speak,<BR>
They all will hold me false and weak.<BR>
What will Kaus'aly&aacute; say when she<BR>
Demands her son exiled by me?<BR>
Alas! what answer shall I frame,<BR>
Or how console the injured dame?<BR>
She like a slave on me attends,<BR>
And with a sister's care she blends<BR>
A mother's love, a wife's, a friend's.<BR>
In spite of all her tender care,<BR>
Her noble son, her face most fair,<BR>
Another queen I could prefer<BR>
And for thy sake neglected her,<BR>
But now, O Queen, my heart is grieved<BR>
For love and care by thee received,<BR>
E'en as the sickening wretch repents<BR>
His dainty meal and condiments.<BR>
And how will Queen Sumitr&aacute; trust<BR>
The husband whom she finds unjust,<BR>
Seeing my R&aacute;ma driven hence<BR>
Dishonoured, and for no offence?<BR>
Ah! the, Videhan bride will hear<BR>
A double woe, a double fear,<BR>
Two whelming sorrows at one breath,<BR>
Her lord's disgrace, his father's death.<BR>
Mine aged bosom she will wring<BR>
And kill me with her sorrowing,<BR>
Sad as a fair nymph left to weep<BR>
Deserted on Him&aacute;laya's steep.<BR>
For short will be my days, I ween,<BR>
When I with mournful eyes have seen<BR>
My R&aacute;ma wandering forth alone<BR>
And heard dear S&iacute;t&aacute; sob and moan.<BR>
Ah me! my fond belief I rue.<BR>
Vile traitress, loved as good and true,<BR>
As one who in his thirst has quaffed,<BR>
Deceived by looks, a deadly draught.<BR>
Ah! thou hast slain me, murderess, while<BR>
Soothing my soul with words of guile,<BR>
As the wild hunter kills the deer<BR>
Lured from the brake his song to hear.<BR>
Soon every honest tongue will fling<BR>
Reproach on the dishonest king;<BR>
The people's scorn in every street<BR>
The seller of his child will meet,<BR>
And such dishonour will be mine<BR>
As whelms a Br&aacute;hman drunk with wine.<BR>
Ah me, for my unhappy fate,<BR>
Compelled thy words to tolerate!<BR>
Such woe is sent to scourge a crime<BR>
Committed in some distant time.<BR>
For many a day with sinful care<BR>
I cherished thee, thou sin and snare,<BR>
Kept thee, unwitting, like a cord<BR>
Destined to bind its hapless lord.<BR>
Mine hours of ease I spent with thee,<BR>
Nor deemed my love my death would be,<BR>
While like a heedless child I played,<BR>
On a black snake my hand I laid.<BR>
A cry from every mouth will burst<BR>
And all the world will hold me curst,<BR>
Because I saw my high-souled son<BR>
Unkinged, unfathered, and undone;<BR>
'The king by power of love beguiled<BR>
Is weaker than a foolish child,<BR>
His own beloved son to make<BR>
An exile for a woman's sake.<BR>
By chaste and holy vows restrained,<BR>
By reverend teachers duly trained.<BR>
When he his virtue's fruit should taste<BR>
He falls by sin and woe disgraced.'<BR>
Two words will all his answer be<BR>
When I pronounce the stern decree,<BR>
'Hence, R&aacute;ma, to the woods away,'<BR>
All he will say is, I obey.<BR>
O, if he would my will withstand<BR>
When banished from his home and land.<BR>
This were a comfort in my woe;<BR>
But he will ne'er do this, I know.<BR>
My R&aacute;ma to the forest fled,<BR>
And curses thick upon my head,<BR>
Grim Death will bear me hence away,<BR>
His world-abominated prey.<BR>
When I am gone and R&aacute;ma too.<BR>
How wilt thou those I love pursue?<BR>
What vengeful sin will be designed<BR>
Against the queens I leave behind?<BR>
When thou hast slain her son and me<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; soon will follow: she<BR>
Will sink beneath her sorrows' weight,<BR>
And die like me disconsolate,<BR>
Exist, Kaikey&iacute;, in thy pride,<BR>
And let thy heart be gratified,<BR>
When thou my queens and me hast hurled,<BR>
And children, to the under world.<BR>
Soon wilt thou rule as empress o'er<BR>
My noble house unvext before.<BR>
But then to wild confusion left,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Of R&aacute;ma and of me bereft.<BR>
If Bharat to thy plan consent<BR>
And long for R&aacute;ma's banishment,<BR>
Ne'er let his hands presume to pay<BR>
The funeral honours to my clay<BR>
Vile foe, thou cause of all mine ill,<BR>
Obtain at last thy cursed will.<BR>
A widow soon shalt thou enjoy<BR>
The sweets of empire with thy boy.<BR>
O Princess, sure some evil fate<BR>
First brought thee here to devastate,<BR>
In whom the night of ruin lies<BR>
Veiled in a consort's fair disguise.<BR>
The scorn of all and deepest shame<BR>
Will long pursue my hated name,<BR>
And dire disgrace on me will press,<BR>
Misled by thee to wickedness.<BR>
How shall my R&aacute;ma, whom, before,<BR>
His elephant or chariot bore,<BR>
Now with his feet, a wanderer, tread<BR>
The forest wilds around him spread?<BR>
How shall my son, to please whose taste,<BR>
The deftest cooks, with earrings graced,<BR>
With rivalry and jealous care<BR>
The dainty meal and cates prepare--<BR>
How shall he now his life sustain<BR>
With acid fruit and woodland grain?<BR>
He spends his time unvext by cares,<BR>
And robes of precious texture wears:<BR>
How shall he, with one garment round<BR>
His limbs recline upon the ground?<BR>
Whose was this plan, this cruel thought<BR>
Unheard till now, with ruin fraught,<BR>
To make thy son Ayodhy&aacute;'s king,<BR>
And send my R&aacute;ma wandering?<BR>
Shame, shame on women! Vile, untrue,<BR>
Their selfish ends they still pursue.<BR>
Not all of womankind I mean.<BR>
But more than all this wicked queen.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  O worthless, cruel, selfish dame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I brought thee home, my plague and woe.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  What fault in me hast thou to blame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Or in my son who loves thee so?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fond wives may from their husbands flee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And fathers may their sons desert,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But all the world would rave to see<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    My R&aacute;ma touched with deadly hurt.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  I joy his very step to hear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    As though his godlike form I viewed;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And when I see my R&aacute;ma near<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I feel my youth again renewed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  There might be life without the sun,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Yea, e'en if Indra sent no rain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But, were my R&aacute;ma banished, none<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Would, so I think, alive remain.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A foe that longs my life to take,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I brought thee here my death to be,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Caressed thee long, a venomed snake,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And through my folly die, Ah me!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  R&aacute;ma and me and Lakshman slay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And then with Bharat rule the state;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  So bring the kingdom to decay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And fawn on those thy lord who hate,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Plotter of woe, for evil bred,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    For such a speech why do not all<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy teeth from out thy wicked head<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Split in a thousand pieces fall?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My R&aacute;ma's words are ever kind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He knows not how to speak in ire:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then how canst thou presume to find<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A fault in him whom all admire?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yield to despair, go mad, or die,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Or sink within the rifted earth;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy fell request will I deny,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thou shamer of thy royal birth.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy longer life I scarce can bear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thou ruin of my home and race,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Who wouldst my heart and heartstrings tear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Keen as a razor, false and base.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  My life is gone, why speak of joy?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    For what, without my son, were sweet?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Spare, lady, him thou canst destroy;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I pray thee as I touch thy feet.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He fell and wept with wild complaint.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Heart-struck by her presumptuous speech,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But could not touch, so weak and faint,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The cruel feet he strove to reach.<BR>
