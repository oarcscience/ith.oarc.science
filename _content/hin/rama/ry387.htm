<P>
On the fierce king Han&uacute;m&aacute;n turned<BR>
His angry eyes that glowed and burned.<BR>
He saw him decked with wealth untold<BR>
Of diamond and pearl and gold,<BR>
And priceless was each wondrous gem<BR>
That sparkled in his diadem.<BR>
About his neck rich chains were twined,<BR>
The best that fancy e'er designed,<BR>
And a fair robe with pearls bestrung<BR>
Down from his mighty shoulders hung.<BR>
Ten heads he reared, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> as Mandar's hill<BR>

<P>

<P>
Lifts woody peaks which tigers fill.<BR>
Bright were his eyes, and bright, beneath,<BR>
The flashes of his awful teeth.<BR>
His brawny arms of wondrous size<BR>
Were decked with rings and scented dyes<BR>
His hands like snakes with five long heads<BR>
Descending from their mountain beds.<BR>
He sat upon a crystal throne<BR>
Inlaid with wealth of precious stone,<BR>
Whereon, of noblest work, was set<BR>
A gold-embroidered coverlet,<BR>
Behind the monarch stood the best<BR>
Of beauteous women gaily dressed.<BR>
And each her giant master fanned,<BR>
Or waved a chourie in her hand.<BR>
Four noble courtiers &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="ry388.htm#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> wise and good<BR>
In counsel, near the monarch stood,<BR>
As the four oceans ever stand<BR>
About the sea-encompassed land.<BR>
Still, though his heart with rage was fired,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar marvelled and admired:<BR>
'O what a rare and wondrous sight!<BR>
What beauty, majesty, and might!<BR>
All regal pomp combines to grace<BR>
This ruler of the R&aacute;kshas race.<BR>
He, if he scorned not right aud law,<BR>
Might guide the world with tempered awe:<BR>
Yea, Indra and the Gods on high<BR>
Might on his saving power rely.'<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_886"></A><A HREF="ry386.htm#fr_886">421:1</A>  The <I>sloka</I> which follows is probably
an interpolation, as it is inconsistent w?th
the questioning in Canto L.:
He looked on Ravan in his pride,
And boldly to the monarch cried:
'I came an envoy to this place
From him who rules the V&aacute;nar race.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_887"></A><A HREF="ry387.htm#fr_887">421:2</A>  The ten heads of R&aacute;van have provoked
much ridicule from European critics.
It should be remembered that
Spenser tells us of "two brethren giants"
"The one of which had two heads, the
other three;" and Milton speaks of the
"four-fold visaged Four," the four Cherubic
shapes each of which had four faces.</P>
