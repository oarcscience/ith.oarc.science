<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXIX.: COUNSEL TO S&Iacute;T&Aacute;.</H3>
<P>
Scarce had the sire, with each dear queen,<BR>
Heard R&aacute;ma's pleading voice, and seen<BR>
His darling in his hermit dress<BR>
Ere failed his senses for distress.<BR>
Convulsed with woe, his soul that shook,<BR>
On Raghu's son he could not look;<BR>
Or if he looked with failing eye<BR>
He could not to the chief reply.<BR>
By pangs of bitter grief assailed,<BR>
The long-armed monarch wept and wailed,<BR>
Half dead a while and sore distraught,<BR>
While R&aacute;ma filled his every thought.<BR>
'This hand of mine in days ere now<BR>
Has reft her young from many a cow.<BR>
Or living things has idly slain:<BR>
Hence comes, I ween, this hour of pain.<BR>
Not till the hour is come to die<BR>
Can from its shell the spirit fly.<BR>
Death comes not, and Kaikey&iacute; still<BR>
Torments the wretch she cannot kill,<BR>
Who sees his son before him quit<BR>
The fine soft robes his rank that fit,<BR>
And, glorious as the burning fire,<BR>
In hermit garb his limbs attire.<BR>
Now all the people grieve and groan<BR>
Through Queen Kaikey&iacute;'s deed alone,<BR>
Who, having dared this deed of sin,<BR>
Strives for herself the gain to win.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke. With tears his eyes grew dim,<BR>
His senses all deserted him.<BR>
He cried, O R&aacute;ma, once, then weak<BR>
And fainting could no further speak.<BR>
Unconscious there he lay: at length<BR>
Regathering his sense and strength,<BR>
While his full eyes their torrents shed,<BR>
To wise Sumantra thus he said:<BR>
'Yoke the light car, and hither lead<BR>
Fleet coursers of the noblest breed,<BR>
And drive this heir of lofty fate<BR>
Beyond the limit of the state.<BR>
This seems the fruit that virtues bear,<BR>
The meed of worth which texts declare--<BR>
The sending of the brave and good<BR>
By sire and mother to the wood.'<BR>

<P>
He heard the monarch, and obeyed,<BR>
With ready feet that ne'er delayed,<BR>
And brought before the palace gate<BR>
The horses and the car of state.<BR>
Then to the monarch's son he sped,<BR>
And raising hands of reverence said<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
That the light car which gold made fair,<BR>
With best of steeds, was standing there.<BR>
King Das'aratha called in haste<BR>
The lord o'er all his treasures placed.<BR>
And spoke, well skilled in place and time,<BR>
His will to him devoid of crime:<BR>
'Count all the years she has to live<BR>
Afar in forest wilds, and give<BR>
To S&iacute;t&aacute; robes and gems of price<BR>
As for the time may well suffice.'<BR>
Quick to the treasure-room he went,<BR>
Charged by that king most excellent,<BR>
Brought the rich stores, and gave them all<BR>
To S&iacute;t&aacute; in the monarch's hall.<BR>
The Maithil dame of high descent<BR>
Received each robe and ornament,<BR>
And tricked those limbs, whose lines foretold<BR>
High destiny, with gems and gold.<BR>
So well adorned, so fair to view,<BR>
A glory through the hall she threw:<BR>
So, when the Lord of Light upsprings,<BR>
His radiance o'er the sky he flings.<BR>
Then Queen Kaus'aly&aacute; spake at last,<BR>
With loving arms about her cast,<BR>
Pressed lingering kisses on her head,<BR>
And to the high-souled lady said:<BR>
'Ah, in this faithless world below<BR>
When dark misfortune comes and woe,<BR>
Wives, loved and cherished every day,<BR>
Neglect their lords and disobey.<BR>
Yes, woman's nature still is this:--<BR>
After long days of calm and bliss<BR>
When some light grief her spirit tries,<BR>
She changes all her love, or flies.<BR>
Young wives are thankless, false in soul,<BR>
With roving hearts that spurn control.<BR>
Brooding on sin and quickly changed,<BR>
In one short hour their love estranged.<BR>
Not glorious deed or lineage fair,<BR>
Not knowledge, gift, or tender care<BR>
In chains of lasting love can bind<BR>
A woman's light inconstant mind.<BR>
But those good dames who still maintain<BR>
What right, truth, Scripture, rule ordain--<BR>
No holy thing in their pure eyes<BR>
With one beloved husband vies.<BR>
Nor let thy lord my son, condemned<BR>
To exile, be by thee contemned,<BR>
For be he poor or wealthy, he<BR>
Is as a God, dear child, to thee.'<BR>

<P>
When S&iacute;t&aacute; heard Kaus'aly&aacute;'s speech<BR>
Her duty and her gain to teach,<BR>
She joined her palms with reverent grace<BR>
And gave her answer face to face:<BR>
'All will I do, forgetting naught,<BR>
Which thou,O honoured Queen, hast taught.<BR>
I know, have heard, and deep have stored<BR>
The rules of duty to my lord.<BR>
Not me, good Queen, shouldst thou include<BR>
Among the faithless multitude.<BR>
Its own sweet light the moon shall leave<BR>
Ere I to duty cease to cleave.<BR>
The stringless lute gives forth no strain,<BR>
The wheelless car is urged in vain;<BR>
No joy a lordless dame, although<BR>
Blest with a hundred sons, can know.<BR>
From father, brother, and from son<BR>
A measured share of joy is won:<BR>
Who would not honour, love, and bless<BR>
Her lord, whose gifts are measureless?<BR>
Thus trained to think, I hold in awe<BR>
Scripture's command and duty's law.<BR>
Him can I hold in slight esteem?<BR>
Her lord is woman's God, I deem.'<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; heard the lady's speech,<BR>
Nor failed those words her heart to reach.<BR>
Then, pure in mind, she gave to flow<BR>
The tear that sprang of joy and woe.<BR>
Then duteous R&aacute;ma forward came<BR>
And stood before the honoured dame,<BR>
And joining reverent hands addressed<BR>
The queen in rank above the rest:<BR>
'O mother, from these tears refrain;<BR>
Look on my sire and still thy pain.<BR>
To thee my days afar shall fly<BR>
As if sweet slumber closed thine eye,<BR>
And fourteen years of exile seem<BR>
To thee, dear mother, like a dream.<BR>
On me returning safe and well,<BR>
Girt by my friends, thine eyes shall dwell.'<BR>

<P>
Thus for their deep affection's sake<BR>
The hero to his mother spake,<BR>
Then to the half seven hundred too.<BR>
Wives of his sire, paid reverence due.<BR>
Thus Das'aratha's son addressed<BR>
That crowd of matrons sore distressed:<BR>
'If from these lips, while here I dwelt,<BR>
One heedless taunt you e'er have felt,<BR>
Forgive me, pray. And now adieu,<BR>
I bid good-bye to all of you.'<BR>
Then straight, like curlews' cries, upwent<BR>
The voices of their wild lament,<BR>
While, as he bade farewell, the crowd<BR>
Of royal women wept aloud,<BR>
And through the ample hall's extent.<BR>
Where erst the sound of tabour, blent<BR>
With drum and shrill-toned instrument,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In joyous concert rose,<BR>
Now rang the sound of wailing high,<BR>
The lamentation and the cry,<BR>
The shriek, the choking sob, the sigh<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That told the ladies' woes.<BR>
