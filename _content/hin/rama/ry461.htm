<P>
But haughty Kumbhakarna spurned<BR>
His counsel, and to R&aacute;van turned:<BR>
'Thy life from peril will I free<BR>
And slay the foe who threatens thee.<BR>
A hero never vaunts in vain,<BR>
Like bellowing clouds devoid of rain,<BR>
Nor, Monarch, be thine ear inclined<BR>
To counsellors of slavish kind,<BR>
Who with mean arts their king mislead<BR>
And mar each gallant plan and deed.<BR>
O, let not words like his beguile<BR>
The glorious king of Lanka's isle.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus scornful Kumbhakarna cried,<BR>
And R&aacute;van with a laugh replied:<BR>
'Mahodar fears and fain would shun<BR>
The battle with Ikshvaku's son.<BR>
Of all my giant warriors, who<BR>
Is strong as thou, and brave and true?<BR>
Ride, conqueror, to the battle ride,<BR>
And tame the foeman's senseless pride.<BR>
Go forth like Yama to the field,<BR>
And let thine arm thy trident wield.<BR>
Scared by the lightning of thine eye<BR>
The Vanar hosts will turn and fly;<BR>
And Rama, when he sees thee near,<BR>
With trembling heart will own his fear.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The champion heard, and, well content,<BR>
Forth from the hall his footsteps bent.<BR>
He grasped his spear, the foeman's dread,<BR>
Black iron all, both shaft and head.<BR>
Which, dyed in many a battle, bore<BR>
Great spots of slaughtered victims' gore.<BR>
The king upon his neck had thrown<BR>
The jewelled chain which graced his own.<BR>
And garlands of delicious scent<BR>
About his limbs for ornament.<BR>
Around his arms gay bracelets clung,<BR>
And pendants in his ears were hung.<BR>
Adorned with gold, about his waist<BR>
His coat of mail was firmly braced,<BR>
And like N&aacute;r&aacute;yan &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_992"></A><A HREF="#fn_992"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> or the God<BR>
Who rules the sky he proudly trod.<BR>
Behind him went a mighty throng<BR>
Of giant warriors tall and strong,<BR>

With cars, with camels, and with steeds:<BR>
And, armed with spear and axe and sword<BR>
Were fain to battle for their lord. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_993"></A><A HREF="ry462.htm#fn_993"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
