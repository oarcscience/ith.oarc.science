<P>
They rose in air: the region grew<BR>
Dark with their shadow as they flew.<BR>
Swift to a lovely grove &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> they came<BR>
That rivalled heavenly Nandan's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> fame<BR>
Where countless bees their honey stored,--<BR>
The pleasance of the V&aacute;nars' lord,<BR>
To every creature fenced and barred,<BR>
Which Dadhimukh was set to guard,<BR>
A noble V&aacute;nar, brave and bold,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va's uncle lofty-souled.<BR>
To Angad came with one accord<BR>
The V&aacute;nars, and besought their lord<BR>
That they those honeyed stores might eat<BR>
That made the grove so passing sweet.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He gave consent: they sought the trees<BR>
Thronged with innumerable bees.<BR>
They rifled all the treasured store,<BR>
And ate the fruit the branches bore,<BR>
And still as they prolonged the feast<BR>
Their merriment and joy increased.<BR>
Drunk with the sweets, they danced and bowed,<BR>
They wildly sang, they laughed aloud.<BR>
Some climbed and sprang from tree to tree,<BR>
Some sat and chattered in their glee.<BR>
Some scaled the trees which creepers crowned,<BR>
And rained the branches to the ground.<BR>
There with loud laugh a V&aacute;nar sprang<BR>
Close to his friend who madly sang,<BR>
In doleful mood another crept<BR>
To mix his tears with one who wept.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Dadhimukh with fury viewed<BR>
The intoxicated multitude.<BR>
He looked upon the rifled shade,<BR>
And all the ruin they had made;<BR>
Then called with angry voice, and strove<BR>
To save the remnant of the grove,<BR>
But warning cries and words were spurned,<BR>
And angry taunt and threat returned.<BR>
Then fierce and wild contention rose:<BR>
With furious words he mingled blows.<BR>
They by no shame or fear withheld,<BR>
By drunken mood and ire impelled,<BR>
Used claws, and teeth, and hands, and beat<BR>
The keeper under trampling feet.<BR>
