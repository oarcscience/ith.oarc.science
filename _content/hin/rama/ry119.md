### CANTO XLI.: THE CITIZENS' LAMENT.

The lion chief with hands upraised  
Was born from eyes that fondly gazed.  
But then the ladies' bower was rent  
With cries of weeping and lament:  
'Where goes he now, our lord, the sure  
Protector of the friendless poor,  
In whom the wretched and the weak  
Defence and aid were wont to seek?  
All words of wrath he turned aside,  
And ne'er, when cursed, in ire replied.  
He shared his people's woe, and stilled  
The troubled breast which rage had filled.  
Our chief, on lofty thoughts intent,  
In glorious fame preeminent:  
As on his own dear mother, thus  
He ever looked on each of us.  
Where goes he now? His sire's behest,  
By Queen Kaikeyí's guile distressed,  
Has banished to the forest hence  
Him who was all the world's defence.  
Ah, senseless King, to drive away  
The hope of men, their guard and stay,  
To banish to the distant wood  
Ráma the duteous, true, and good!'  
The royal dames, like cows bereaved  
Of their young calves, thus sadly grieved.  
The monarch heard them as they wailed,  
And by the fire of grief assailed  
For his dear son, he bowed his head,  
And all his sense and memory fled.  
   Then were no fires of worship fed,  
Thick darkness o'er the sun was spread.  
The cows their thirsty calves denied,  
And elephants flung their food aside.

Tris'anku,  <span id="fr_315"></span>[1](ry120.htm#fn_315) Jupiter
looked dread,  
And Mercury and Mars the red,  
In direful opposition met,  
The glory of the moon beset.  
The lunar stars withheld their light,  
The planets were no longer bright,  
But meteors with their horrid glare,  
And dire Vis'ákhás  <span id="fr_316"></span>[2](ry120.htm#fn_316) lit
the air.  
As troubled Ocean heaves and raves  
When Doom's wild tempest sweeps the waves,  
Thus all Ayodhyá reeled and bent  
When Ráma to the forest went.  
And chilling grief and dark despair  
Fell suddenly on all men there.  
Their wonted pastime all forgot,  
Nor thought of food, or touched it not.  
Crowds in the royal street were seen  
With weeping eye and troubled mien:  
No more a people gay and glad,  
Each head and heart was sick and sad.  
No more the cool wind softly blew,  
The moon no more was fair to view,  
No more the sun with genial glow  
Cherished the world now plunged in woe.  
Sons, brothers, husbands, wedded wives  
Forgot the ties that joined their lives;  
No thought for kith and kin was spared,  
But all for only Ráma cared.  
And Ráma's friends who loved him best,  
Their minds disordered and distressed.  
By the great burthen of their woes  
Turned not to slumber or repose.  
   Like Earth with all her hills bereft  
     Of Indra's guiding care.  
   Ayodhyá in her sorrow left  
     By him, the high souled heir.  
   Was bowed by fear and sorrow's force,  
     And shook with many a throe,  
   While warrior, elephant, and horse  
     Sent up the cry of woe.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[143:1](ry118.htm#fr_314) 'Thirty centuries
have passed since he began this memorable journey. Every step of it is
known and is annually traversed by thousands: hero worship is not
extinct. What can Faith do! How strong are the ties of religion when
entwined with the legends of a country! How many a cart creeps creaking
and weary along the road from Ayodhyá to Chitrakút. It is this that
gives the Rámáyan a strange interest, the story still lives.' *Calcutta
Review: Vol. XXIII.*
