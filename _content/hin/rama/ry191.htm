<P>
Bearing the sandals on his head<BR>
Away triumphant Bharat sped,<BR>
And clomb, S'atrughna by his side,<BR>
The car wherein he wont to ride.<BR>
Before the mighty army went<BR>
The lords for counsel eminent,<BR>
Vas'ishtha, V&aacute;madeva next,<BR>
J&aacute;v&aacute;li, pure with prayer and text.<BR>

<P>
Then from that lovely river they<BR>
Turned eastward on their homeward way:<BR>
With reverent steps from left to right<BR>
They circled Chitrak&uacute;ta's height,<BR>
And viewed his peaks on every side<BR>
With stains of thousand metals dyed.<BR>
Then Bharat saw, not far away,<BR>
Where Bharadw&aacute;ja's dwelling lay,<BR>
And when the chieftain bold and sage<BR>
Had reached that holy hermitage,<BR>
Down from the car he sprang to greet<BR>
The saint, and bowed before his feet.<BR>
High rapture filled the hermit's breast,<BR>
Who thus the royal prince addressed:<BR>
'Say, Bharat, is thy duty done?<BR>
Hast thou with R&aacute;ma met, my son?'<BR>

<P>
The chief whose soul to virtue clave<BR>
This answer to the hermit gave:<BR>
'I prayed him with our holy guide:<BR>
But Raghu's son our prayer denied,<BR>
And long besought by both of us<BR>
He answered Saint Vas'ishtha thus:<BR>
'True to my vow, I still will be<BR>
Observant of my sire's decree:<BR>
Till fourteen years complete their course<BR>
That promise shall remain in force.'<BR>
The saint in highest wisdom caught,<BR>
These solemn words with wisdom fraught,<BR>
To him in lore of language learned<BR>
Most eloquent himself returned:<BR>
'Obey my rede: let Bharat hold<BR>
This pair of sandals decked with gold:<BR>
They in Ayodhy&aacute; shall ensure<BR>
Our welfare, and our bliss secure.'<BR>
When R&aacute;ma heard the royal priest<BR>
He rose, and looking to the east<BR>
Consigned the sandals to my hand<BR>
That they for him might guard the land.<BR>
Then from the high-souled chief's abode<BR>
I turned upon my homeward road,<BR>
Dismissed by him, and now this pair<BR>
Of sandals to Ayodhy&aacute; bear.'<BR>

<P>
To him the hermit thus replied,<BR>
Bv Bharat's tidings gratified:<BR>
'No marvel thoughts so just and true,<BR>
Thou best of all who right pursue,<BR>
Should dwell in thee, O Prince of men,<BR>
As waters gather in the glen.<BR>
He is not dead,we mourn in vain:<BR>
Thy blessed father lives again,<BR>
Whose noble son we thus behold<BR>
Like Virtue's self in human mould.'<BR>
He ceased: before him Bharat fell<BR>
To clasp his feet, and said farewell:<BR>
His reverent steps around him bent,<BR>
And onward to Ayodhy&aacute; went.<BR>
His host of followers stretching far<BR>
With many an elephant and car,<BR>
Waggon and steed, and mighty train,<BR>
Traversed their homeward way again.<BR>
O'er holy Yamun&aacute; they sped,<BR>
Fair stream, with waves engarlanded,<BR>
And then once more the rivers' queen,<BR>
The blessed Gang&aacute;'s self was seen.<BR>
Then making o'er that flood his way,<BR>
Where crocodiles and monsters lay,<BR>
The king to S'ringavera drew<BR>
His host and royal retinue.<BR>
His onward way he thence pursued,<BR>
And soon renowned Ayodhy&aacute; viewed.<BR>
Then burnt by woe and sad of cheer<BR>
Bharat addressed the charioteer:<BR>
'Ah, see, Ayodhy&aacute; dark and sad,<BR>
Her glory gone, once bright and glad:<BR>
Of joy and beauty reft, forlorn,<BR>
In silent grief she seems to mourn.'<BR>
