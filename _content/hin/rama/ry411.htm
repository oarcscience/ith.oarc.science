<P>
The king in counsel unsurpassed<BR>
His eye around the synod cast,<BR>
And fierce Prahasta, first and best<BR>
Of all his captains, thus addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Brave master of each warlike art,<BR>
Arouse thee and perform thy part.<BR>
Array thy fourfold forces &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_928"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> well<BR>
To guard our isle and citadel.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The captain of the hosts obeyed,<BR>
The troops with prudent skill arrayed;<BR>
Then to the hall again he hied,<BR>
And stood before the king and cried:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Each inlet to the town is closed<BR>
Without, within, are troops disposed.<BR>
With fearless heart thine aim pursue<BR>
And do the deed thou hast in view,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spoke Prahasta in the zeal<BR>
That moved him for the kingdom's weal.<BR>
And thus the monarch, who pursued<BR>
His own delight, his speech renewed:<BR>
'In ease and bliss, in toil and pain,<BR>
In doubts of duty, pleasure, pain,<BR>
Your proper path I need not tell.<BR>
For of yourselves ye know it well.<BR>
The Storm-Gods, Moon, and planets bring<BR>
New glory to their heavenly king,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_929"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
And, ranged about your monarch, ye<BR>
Give joy and endless fame to me.<BR>
My secret counsel have I kept,<BR>
While senseless Kumbhakarna slept.<BR>
Six months the warrior's slumbers last<BR>
And bind his torpid senses fast;<BR>
Bat now his deep repose he breaks,<BR>
The beat of all our champions wakes.<BR>
I captured, R&aacute;ma's heart to wring,<BR>
This daughter of Videha's king.<BR>
And brought her from that distant land &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
Where wandered many a R&aacute;kshas band.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Disdainful still my love she spurns.<BR>
Still from each prayer and offering turns,<BR>
Yet in all lands beneath the sun<BR>
No dame may rival S&iacute;t&aacute;, none,<BR>
Her dainty waist is round and slight,<BR>
Her cheek like autumn's moon is bright.<BR>
And she like fruit in graven gold<BR>
Mocks her &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_931"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> whom Maya framed of old.<BR>
Faultless in form, how firmly tread<BR>
Her feet whose soles are rosy red!<BR>
Ah, as I gaze her beauty takes<BR>
My spirit, and my passion wakes.<BR>
Looking for R&aacute;ma far away<BR>
She sought with tears a year's delay<BR>
Nor gazing on her love-lit eye<BR>
Could I that earnest prayer deny.<BR>
But baffled hopes and vain desire<BR>
At length my patient spirit tire.<BR>
How shall the sons of Raghu sweep<BR>
To vengeance o'er the pathless deep?<BR>
How shall they lead the V&aacute;nar train<BR>
Across the monster-teeming main?<BR>
One V&aacute;nar yet could find a way<BR>
To Lank&aacute;'s town, and burn and slay.<BR>
Take counsel then, remembering still<BR>
That we from men need fear no ill;<BR>
And give your sentence in debate,<BR>
For matchless is the power of fate.<BR>
Assailed by you the Gods who dwell<BR>
In heaven beneath our fury fell.<BR>
And shall we fear these creatures bred<BR>
In forests, by Sugr&iacute;va led?<BR>
E'en now on ocean's farther strand,<BR>
The sons of Das'aratha stand.<BR>
And follow, burning to attack<BR>
Their giant foes, on S&iacute;t&aacute;'s track.<BR>
Consult then, lords for ye are wise:<BR>
A seasonable plan devise.<BR>
The captive lady to retain,<BR>
And triumph when the foes are slain.<BR>
No power can bring across the foam<BR>
Those V&aacute;nars to our island home;<BR>
Or if they madly will defy<BR>
Our conquering might, they needs must die.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Kumbhakarna's anger woke.<BR>
And wroth at R&aacute;van's words he spoke:<BR>
'O Monarch, when thy ravished eyes<BR>
First looked upon thy lovely prize,<BR>
Then was the time to bid us scan<BR>
Each peril and mature a plan.<BR>
Blest is the king who acts with heed,<BR>
And ne'er repents one hasty deed;<BR>
And hapless he whose troubled soul<BR>
Mourns over days beyond control.<BR>

<P>
Thou hast, in beauty's toils ensnared,<BR>
A desperate deed of boldness dared;<BR>
By fortune saved ere R&aacute;ma's steel<BR>
One wound, thy mortal bane, could deal.<BR>
But, R&aacute;van, as the deed is done,<BR>
The toil of war I will not shun.<BR>
This arm, O rover of the night,<BR>
Thy foemen to the earth shall smite,<BR>
Though Indra with the Lord of Flame,<BR>
The Sun and Storms, against me came.<BR>
E'en Indra, monarch of the skies,<BR>
Would dread my club and mountain size,<BR>
Shrink from these teeth and quake to hear<BR>
The thunders of my voice of fear.<BR>
No second dart shall R&aacute;ma cast:<BR>
The first he aims shall be the last.<BR>
He falls, and these dry lips shall drain<BR>
The blood of him my hand has slain;<BR>
And Sit&aacute;, when her champion dies,<BR>
Shall be thine undisputed prize.'<BR>
