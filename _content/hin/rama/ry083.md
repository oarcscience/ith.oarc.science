### CANTO V.: RÁMA'S FAST.

Then Saint Vas'ishtha to the king  
Came ready at his summoning.  
'Now go,' exclaimed the monarch, 'thou  
Enriched by fervent rite and vow,  
For Ráma and his wife ordain  
The fast, that joy may bless his reign.'  

The best of those who Scripture know  
Said to the king, 'My lord, I go.'  
To Ráma's house Vas'ishtha hied,  
The hero's fast by rule to guide,  
And skilled in sacred texts to tell  
Each step to him instructed well.  
Straight to Prince Ráma's high abode,  
That like a cloud pale-tinted showed,  
Borne in his priestly car he rode.  
Two courts he passed, and in the third  
He stayed his car. Then Ráma heard  
The holy sage was come, and flew  
To honour him with honour due.  
He hastened to the car and lent  
His hand to aid the priest's descent.  
Then spoke Vas'ishtha words like these,  
Pleased with his reverent courtesies,  
With pleasant things his heart to cheer  
Who best deserved glad news to hear:  
'Prince, thou hast won thy father's grace,  
And thine will be the Regent's place:  
Now with thy Sítá, as is right,  
In strictest fasting spend the night,  

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>  

For when the morrow's dawn is fair  
The king will consecrate his heir:  
So Nahush, <span id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_269) as the wise relate,  
Yayáti joyed to consecrate.'  

Thus having said, Vas'ishtha next  
Ordained the fast by rule and text,  
For Ráma faithful to his vows  
And the Videhan dame his spouse.  
Then from the prince's house he hied  
With courteous honours gratified.  
Round Ráma gathered every friend  
In pleasant talk a while to spend.  
He bade good night to all at last,  
And to his inner chamber passed.  
Then Ráma's house shone bright and gay  
With men and maids in glad array,  
As in the morning some fair lake  
When all her lotuses awake,  
And every bird that loves the flood  
Flits joyous round each opening bud.  

Forth from the house Vas'ishtha drove,  
That with the king's in splendour strove,  
And all the royal street he viewed  
Filled with a mighty multitude  
The eager concourse blocked each square,  
Each road and lane and thoroughfare,  
And joyous shouts on every side  
Rose like the roar of Ocean's tide,  
As streams of men together came  
With loud huzza and glad acclaim.  
The ways were watered, swept and clean,  
And decked with flowers and garlands green  
And all Ayodhyá shone arrayed  
With banners on the roofs that played.  
Men, women, boys with eager eyes,  
Expecting when the sun should rise,  
Stood longing for the herald ray  
Of Ráma's consecration day,  
To see, a source of joy to all,  
The people-\*honoured festival.  

The priest advancing slowly through  
The mighty crowd he cleft in two,  
Near to the monarch's palace drew.  
He sought the terrace, by the stair,  
Like a white cloud peak high in air,  
The reverend king of men to meet  
Who sate upon his splendid seat:  
Thus will Vrihaspati arise  
To meet the monarch of the skies.  
But when the king his coming knew,  
He left his throne and near him drew  
Questioned by him Vas'ishtha said  
That all his task was duly sped.  
Then all who sate there, honouring  
Vas'ishtha, rose as rose the king,  
Vas'ishtha bade his lord adieu,  
And all the peers, dismissed, withdrew.  

Then as a royal lion seeks  
His cave beneath the rocky peaks,  
So to the chambers where abode  
His consorts Das'aratha strode.  
   Full-thronged were those delightful bowers  
     With women richly dressed,  
   And splendid as the radiant towers  
     Where Indra loves to rest.  
   Then brighter flashed a thousand eyes  
     With the light his presence lent,  
   As, when the moon begins to rise  
     The star thronged firmament.
