<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LV.: FEAR FOR S&Iacute;T&Aacute;.</H3>
<P>
But other thoughts resumed their sway<BR>
When Lank&aacute;'s town in ruin lay;<BR>
And, as his bosom felt their weigh<BR>
He stood a while to meditate<BR>
'What have I done?', he thought with shame,<BR>
'Destroyed the town with hostile flame.<BR>
O happy they whose firm control<BR>
Checks the wild passion of the soul;<BR>
Who on the fires of anger throw<BR>
The cooling drops that check their glow.<BR>
But woe is me, whom wrath could lead<BR>
To do this senseless shameless deed.<BR>
The town to fire and death I gave,<BR>
Nor thought of her I came to save,--<BR>
Doomed by my own rash folly, doomed<BR>
To perish in the flames consumed.<BR>
If I, when anger drove me wild.<BR>
Have caused the death of Janak's child,<BR>
The kindled flame shall end my woe,<BR>
Or the deep fires that burn below,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="ry394.htm#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Or my forsaken corse shall be<BR>
Food for the monsters of the sea.<BR>
How can I meet Sugr&iacute;va? how<BR>
Before the royal brothers bow,--<BR>
I whose rash deed has madly foiled.<BR>
The noble work in which we toiled?<BR>
Or has her own bright virtue shed<BR>
Its guardian influence round her head?<BR>
She lives untouched,--the peerless dame;<BR>
Flame has no fury for the flame.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="ry394.htm#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The very fire would ne'er consent<BR>
To harm a queen so excellent,--<BR>
The high-souled R&aacute;ma's faithful wife,<BR>
Protected by her holy life.<BR>
She lives, she lives. Why should I fear<BR>
For one whom Raghu's sons hold dear?<BR>
Has not the pitying fire that spared<BR>
The V&aacute;nar for the lady cared?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Such were his thoughts: he pondered long,<BR>
And fear grew faint and hope grew strong.<BR>
Then round him heavenly voices rang,<BR>
And, sweetly tuned, his praises sang:<BR>
'O glorious is the exploit done<BR>
By Hanum&aacute;n the Wind-God's son.<BR>
The flames o'er Lank&aacute;'s city rise:<BR>
The giants' home in ruin lies.<BR>
O'er roof and wall the fires have spread,<BR>
Nor harmed a hair of S&iacute;t&aacute;'s head.'<BR>
