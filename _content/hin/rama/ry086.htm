<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO VIII: MANTHAR&Aacute;'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
The damsel's breast with fury burned:<BR>
She answered, as the gift she spurned:<BR>
'What time, O simple Queen, is this<BR>
For idle dreams of fancied bliss?<BR>
Hast thou not sense thy state to know,<BR>
Engulfed in seas of whelming woe;<BR>
Sick as I am with grief and pain<BR>
My lips can scarce a laugh restrain<BR>
To see thee hail with ill-timed joy<BR>
A peril mighty to destroy.<BR>
I mourn for one so fondly blind:<BR>
What woman of a prudent mind<BR>
Would welcome, e'en as thou hast done,<BR>
The lordship of a rival's son,<BR>
Rejoiced to find her secret foe<BR>
Empowered, like death, to launch the blow;<BR>
I see that R&aacute;ma still must fear<BR>
Thy Bharat, to his throne too near.<BR>
Hence is my heart disquieted,<BR>
For those who fear are those we dread.<BR>
Lakshman, the mighty bow who draws,<BR>
With all his soul serves R&aacute;ma's cause;<BR>
And chains as strong to Bharat bind<BR>
S'atrughna, with his heart and mind,<BR>
Now next to R&aacute;ma, lady fair,<BR>
Thy Bharat is the lawful heir:<BR>
And far remote, I ween, the chance<BR>
That might the younger two advance.<BR>
Yes, Queen,'tis R&aacute;ma that I dread,<BR>
Wise, prompt, in warlike science bred;<BR>
And oh, I tremble when I think<BR>
Of thy dear child on ruin's brink.<BR>

<P>
Blest witn a lofty fate is she,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;; for her son will be<BR>
Placed, when the moon and Pushya meet,<BR>
By Br&aacute;hmans on the royal seat,<BR>
Thou as a slave in suppliant guise<BR>
Must wait upon Kaus'aly&aacute;'s eyes,<BR>
With all her wealth and bliss secured<BR>
And glorious from her foes assured.<BR>
Her slave with us who serve thee, thou<BR>
Wilt see thy son to R&aacute;ma bow,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute;'s friends exult o'er all,<BR>
While Bharat's wife shares Bharat's fall.'<BR>

<P>
As thus the maid in wrath complained,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; saw her heart was pained,<BR>
And answered eager in defence<BR>
Of Ram&aacute;'s worth and excellence:<BR>
'Nay, R&aacute;ma, born the monarch's heir,<BR>
By holy fathers trained with care,<BR>
Virtuous, grateful, pure, and true,<BR>
Claims royal sway as rightly due.<BR>
He, like a sire, will long defend<BR>
Each brother, minister, and friend.<BR>
Then why, O hump-back, art thou pained<BR>
To hear that he the throne has gained?<BR>
Be sure when R&aacute;ma's empire ends,<BR>
The kingdom to my son descends,<BR>
Who, when a hundred years are flown,<BR>
Shall sit upon his fathers' throne.<BR>
Why is thine heart thus sad to see<BR>
The joy that is and long shall be,<BR>
This fortune by possession sure<BR>
And hopes which we may count secure?<BR>
Dear as the darling son I bore<BR>
Is R&aacute;ma, yea, or even more.<BR>
Most duteous to Kaus'aly&aacute;, he<BR>
Is yet more dutiful to me.<BR>
What though he rule, we need not fear:<BR>
His brethren to his soul are dear.<BR>
And if the throne Prince R&aacute;ma fill<BR>
Bharat will share the empire still.'<BR>

<P>
She ceased. The troubled damsel sighed<BR>
Sighs long and hot, and thus replied:<BR>
'What madness has possessed thy mind,<BR>
To warnings deaf, to dangers blind?<BR>
Canst thou not see the floods of woe<BR>
That threaten o'er thine head to flow:<BR>
First R&aacute;ma will the throne acquire,<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma's son succeed his sire,<BR>
While Bharat will neglected pine<BR>
Excluded from the royal line.<BR>
Not all his sons, O lady fair,<BR>
The kingdom of a monarch share:<BR>
All ruling when a sovereign dies<BR>
Wild tumult in the state would rise.<BR>
The eldest, be he good or ill,<BR>
Is ruler by the father's will.<BR>
Know, tender mother, that thy son<BR>
Without a friend and all undone.<BR>
Far from the joyous ease of home<BR>
An alien from his race will roam.<BR>
I sped to thee for whom I feel,<BR>
But thy fond heart mistakes my zeal,<BR>
Thy hand a present would bestow<BR>
Because thy rival triumphs so.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma once begins his sway<BR>
Without a foe his will to stay,<BR>
Thy darling Bharat he will drive<BR>
To distant lands if left alive.<BR>
By thee the child was sent away<BR>
Beneath his grandsire's roof to stay.<BR>
Even in stocks and stones perforce<BR>
Will friendship spring from intercourse.<BR>
The young S'atrughna too would go<BR>
With Bharat, for he loved him so.<BR>
As Lakshman still to R&aacute;ma cleaves,<BR>
He his dear Bharat never leaves.<BR>
There is an ancient tale they tell:<BR>
A tree the foresters would fell<BR>
Was saved by reeds that round it stood,<BR>
For love that sprang of neighbourhood.<BR>
So Lakshman R&aacute;ma will defend,<BR>
And each on each for aid depend.<BR>
Such fame on earth their friendship wins<BR>
As that which binds the Heavenly Twins.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma ne'er will purpose wrong<BR>
To Lakshman, for their love is strong.<BR>
But Bharat, Oh, of this be sure,<BR>
Must evil at his hands endure.<BR>
Come, R&aacute;ma from his home expel<BR>
An exile in the woods to dwell.<BR>
The plan, O Queen, which I advise<BR>
Secures thy weal if thou be wise,<BR>
So we and all thy kith and kin<BR>
Advantage from thy gain shall win.<BR>
Shall Bharat, meet for happier fate,<BR>
Born to endure his rival's hate,<BR>
With all his fortune ruined cower<BR>
And dread his brother's mightier power!<BR>
Up, Queen, to save thy son, arise;<BR>
Prostrate at R&aacute;ma's feet he lies.<BR>
So the proud elephant who leads<BR>
His trooping consorts through the reeds<BR>
Falls in the forest shade beneath<BR>
The lion's spring and murderous teeth.<BR>
Scorned by thee in thy bliss and pride<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; was of old defied,<BR>
And will she now forbear to show<BR>
The vengeful rancour of a foe?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  O Queen, thy darling is undone<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When R&aacute;ma's hand has once begun<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Ayodhy&aacute;'s realm to sway,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Come, win the kingdom for thy child<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And drive the alien to the wild<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    In banishment to-day.'<BR>
