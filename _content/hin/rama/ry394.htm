He looked upon the burning waste,<BR>
Then sought the queen in joyous haste,<BR>
With words of hope consoled her heart,<BR>
And made him ready to depart.<BR>

He sealed Arishta's glorious steep<BR>
Whose summits beetled o'er the deep.<BR>
The woods in varied beauty dressed<BR>
Hung like a garland round his crest,<BR>
And clouds of ever changing hue<BR>
A robe about his shoulders threw.<BR>
On him the rays of morning fell<BR>
To wake the hill they loved so well,<BR>
And bid unclose those splendid eyes<BR>
That glittered in his mineral dyes.<BR>
He woke to hear the music made<BR>
By thunders of the white cascade,<BR>
While every laughing rill that sprang<BR>
From crag to crag its carol sang.<BR>
For arms, he lifted to the stars<BR>
His towering stems of Deod&aacute;rs,<BR>
And morning heard his pealing call<BR>
In tumbling brook and waterfall.<BR>
He trembled when his woods were pale<BR>
And bowed beneath the autumn gale,<BR>
And when his vocal reeds were stirred<BR>
His melancholy moan was heard.<BR>
&nbsp; Far down against the mountain's feet<BR>
The V&aacute;nar heard the wild waves beat;<BR>
Then turned his glances to the north.<BR>
Sprang from the peak and bounded forth,<BR>
The mountain felt the fearful shock<BR>
And trembled through his mass of rock.<BR>
The tallest trees were crushed and rent<BR>
And headlong to the valley sent,<BR>
And as the rocking shook each cave<BR>
Loud was the roar the lions gave.<BR>
Forth from the shaken cavern came<BR>
Fierce serpents with their tongues aflame;<BR>
And every Yaksha, wild with dread,<BR>
And Kinnar and Gandharva, fled.<BR>
