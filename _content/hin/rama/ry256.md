### CANTO LVIII.: THE BROTHERS' MEETING.

When Ráma's deadly shaft had struck  
The giant in the seeming buck.  
The chieftain turned him from the place  
His homeward way again to trace.  
Then as he hastened onward, fain  
To look upon his spouse again,  
Behind him from a thicket nigh  
Rang out a jackal's piercing cry.  
Alarmed he heard the startling shriek  
That raised his hair and dimmed his cheek,  
And all his heart was filled with doubt  
As the shrill jackal's cry rung out:  
'Alas, some dire disaster seems  
Portended by the jackal's screams.  
O may the Maitil dame be screened  
From outrage of each hungry fiend!  

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>  

Alas, if Lakshman chanced to hear  
That bitter cry of woe and fear  
What time Márícha, as he died,  
With voice that mocked my accents cried,  
Swift to my side the prince would flee  
And quit the dame to succour me.  
Too well I see the demon band  
The slaughter of my love have planned.  
Me far from home and Sítá's view  
The seeming deer Márícha drew.  
He led me far through brake and dell  
Till wounded by my shaft he fell,  
And as he sank rang out his cry,  
'O save me, Lakshman, or I die.'  
May it be well with both who stayed  
In the great wood with none to aid,  
For every fiend is now my foe  
For Janasthán's great overthrow,  
And many an omen seen to-day  
Has filled my heart with sore dismay.'  
   Such were the thoughts and sad surmise  
Of Ráma at the jackal's cries,  
And all his heart within him burned  
As to his cot his steps he turned.  
He pondered on the deer that led  
His feet to follow where it fled,  
And sad with many a bitter thought  
His home in Janasthán he sought.  
His soul was dark with woe and fear  
When flocks of birds and troops of deer  
Move round him from the left, and raised  
Discordant voices as they gazed.  
The omens which the chieftain viewed  
The terror of his soul renewed,  
When lo, to meet him Lakshman sped  
With brows whence all the light had fled.  
Near and more near the princes came,  
Each brother's heart and look the same;  
Alike on each sad visage lay  
The signs of misery and dismay,  
Then Ráma by his terror moved  
His brother for his fault reproved  
In leaving Sítá far from aid  
In the wild wood where giants strayed.  
Lakshman's left hand be took, and then  
In gentle tones the prince of men,  
Though sharp and fierce their tenour ran,  
Thus to his brother chief began:  
   'O Lakshman, thou art much to blame  
Leaving alone the Maíthil dame,  
And flying hither to my side:  
O, may no ill my spouse betide!  
But ah. I know my wife is dead,  
And giants on her limbs have fed,  
So strange, so terrible are all  
The omens which my heart appal.  
O Lakshman, may we yet return  
The safety of my love to learn.  
To find the child of Janak still  
Alive and free from scathe and ill!  
Each bird with notes of warning screams,  

Though the hot sun still darts his beams.  
The moan of deer, the jackal's yell  
Of some o'erwhelming misery tell.  
O mighty brother, still may she.  
My princess, live from danger free!  
That semblance of a golden deer  
     Allured me far away,  
   I followed nearer and more near,  
     And longed to take the prey.  
   I followed where the quarry fled:  
     My deadly arrow flew,  
   And as the dying creature bled,  
     The giant met my view.  
   Great tear and pain oppress my heart  
     That dreads the coming blow,  
   And through my left eye keenly dart  
     The throbs that herald woe.  
   Ah Lakshman, all these signs dismay,  
     My soul that sinks, with dread,  
   I know my love is torn away,  
     Or, haply, she is dead.'
