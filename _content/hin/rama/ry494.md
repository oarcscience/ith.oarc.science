### CANTO CXXIII.: THE MAGIC CAR.

Then slept the tamer of his foes  
And spent the night in calm repose.  
Vibhíshan came when morning broke,  
And hailed the royal chief, and spoke:  
'Here wait thee precious oil and scents,  
And rich attire and ornaments.  
The brimming urns are newly filled,  
And women in their duty skilled,  
With lotus-eyes, thy call attend,  
Assistance at thy bath to lend.'  
'Let others,' Ráma cried,'desire  
These precious scents, this rich attire,  
I heed not such delights as these,  
For faithful Bharat, ill at ease,  
Watching for me is keeping now  
Far far away his rigorous vow.  
By Bharat's side I long to stand,  
I long to see my fatherland.  

Far is Ayodhvá: long, alas,  
The dreary road and hard to pass.'  
   'One day,' Vibhíshan cried, 'one day  
Shall bear thee o'er that length of way.  
Is not the wondrous chariot mine,  
Named Pushpak, wrought by hands divine.  
The prize which Rávan seized of old  
Victorious o'er the God of Gold  
This chariot, kept with utmost care,  
Will waft thee through the fields of air,  
And thou shalt light unwearied down  
In fair Ayodhyá's royal town.  
But yet if aught that I have done  
Has pleased thee well, O Raghu's son;  
If still thou carest for thy friend,  
Some little time in Lanká spend;  
There after toil of battle rest  
Within my halls an honoured guest.'  
Again the son of Raghu spake:  
'Thy life was perilled for my sake.  
Thy counsel gave me priceless aid:  
All honours have been richly paid.  
Scarce can my love refuse, O best  
Of giant kind, thy last request.  
But still I yearn once more to see  
My home and all most dear to me;  
Nor can I brook one hour's delay:  
Forgive me, speed me on my way.'  
   He ceased: the magic car was brought,  
Of yore by Vis'vakarmá wrought.  
In sunlike sheen it flashed and blazed;  
And Raghu's sons in wonder gazed.
