<P>
Then Bharat's face was eastward bent<BR>
As from the royal town he went.<BR>
He reached Sud&aacute;m&aacute;'s farther side,<BR>
And glorious, gazed upon the tide;<BR>
Passed Hl&aacute;din&iacute;, and saw her toss<BR>
Her westering billows hard to cross.<BR>
Then old Ikshv&aacute;ku's famous son<BR>
O'er S'atadr&uacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_348"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> his passage won,<BR>
Near Ailadh&aacute;na on the strand,<BR>
And came to Aparparyat's land.<BR>
O'er S'il&aacute;s flood he hurried fast,<BR>
Akurvat&iacute;'s fair stream he passed,<BR>
Crossed o'er A'gneya's rapid rill,<BR>
And S'alyakartan onward still.<BR>
S'il&aacute;vah&aacute;'s swift stream he eyed,<BR>
True to his vows and purified.<BR>
Then crossed the lofty hills, and stood<BR>
In Chaitraratha's mighty wood.<BR>
He reached the confluence where meet<BR>
Sarasvat&iacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and Gang&aacute; fleet,<BR>
And through Bh&aacute;runda forest, spread<BR>
Northward of V&iacute;ramatsya, sped.<BR>
He sought Kalinda's child, who fills<BR>

The soul with joy, begirt by hills,<BR>
Reached Yamun&aacute; and passing o'er,<BR>
Rested his army on the shore:<BR>
He gave his horses food and rest,<BR>
Bathed reeking limb and drooping crest.<BR>
They drank their fill and bathed them there,<BR>
And water for their journey bare.<BR>
Thence through a mighty wood he sped<BR>
All wild and uninhabited,<BR>
As in fair chariot through the skies,<BR>
Most fair in shape a Storm-God flies.<BR>
At Ans'udh&aacute;na Gang&aacute;, hard<BR>
To cross, his onward journey barred,<BR>
So turning quickly thence he came<BR>
To Pr&aacute;gvat's city dear to fame.<BR>
There having gained the farther side<BR>
To Kutikoshtik&aacute; he hied:<BR>
The stream he crossed, and onward then<BR>
To Dharmavardhan brought his men.<BR>
Thence, leaving Toran on the north.<BR>
To Jambuprastha journeyed forth.<BR>
Then onward to a pleasant grove<BR>
By fair Var&uacute;ha's town he drove,<BR>
And when a while he there had stayed,<BR>
Went eastward from the friendly shade.<BR>
Eastward of Ujjih&aacute;n&aacute; where<BR>
The Priyak trees are tall and fair,<BR>
He passed, and rested there each steed<BR>
Kxhausted with the journey's speed.<BR>
There orders to his men addressed,<BR>
With quickened pace he onward pressed,<BR>
A while at Sarvatirtha spent,<BR>
Then o'er Utt&aacute;nik&aacute; he went.<BR>
O'er many a stream beside he sped<BR>
With coursers on the mountains bred,<BR>
And passing Hastiprishthak, took<BR>
The road o'er Kutik&aacute;s fair brook.<BR>
Then, at Lohitya's village, he<BR>
Crossed o'er the swift Kap&iacute;vat&iacute;,<BR>
Then passed, where Ekas'&aacute;la stands,<BR>
The Sth&aacute;numat&iacute;s flood and sands,<BR>
And Gomat&iacute; of fair renown<BR>
By Vinata's delightful town.<BR>
When to Kalinga near he drew,<BR>
A wood of Sal trees charmed the view;<BR>
That passed, the sun began to rise,<BR>
And Bharat saw with happy eyes,<BR>
Ayodh&aacute;'s city, built and planned<BR>
By ancient Manu's royal hand,<BR>
Seven nights upon the road had passed,<BR>
And when he saw the town at last<BR>
Before him in her beauty spread,<BR>
Thus Bharat to the driver said:<BR>
'This glorious city from afar,<BR>
Wherein pure groves and gardens are,<BR>
Seems to my eager eyes to-day<BR>
A lifeless pile of yellow clay.<BR>
Through all her streets where erst a throng<BR>
Of men and women streamed along,<BR>
Uprose the multitudinous roar:<BR>
To-day I hear that sound no more.<BR>
No longer do mine eyes behold<BR>
The leading people, as of old,<BR>
On elephants, cars, horses, go<BR>
Abroad and homeward, to and fro.<BR>
The brilliant gardens, where we heard<BR>
The wild note of each rapturous bird.<BR>
Where men and women loved to meet,<BR>
In pleasant shades, for pastime sweet,--<BR>
These to my eyes this day appear<BR>
Joyless, and desolate, and drear;<BR>
Each tree that graced the garden grieves,<BR>
And every path is spread with leaves.<BR>
The merry cry of bird and beast,<BR>
That spake aloud their joy has ceased:<BR>
Still is the long melodious note<BR>
That charmed us from each warbling throat,<BR>
Why blows the blessed air no more,<BR>
The incense-breathing air that bore<BR>
Its sweet incomparable scent<BR>
Of sandal and of aloe blent?<BR>
Why are the drum and tabour mute?<BR>
Why is the music of the lute<BR>
That woke responsive to the quill,<BR>
Loved by the happy, hushed and still?<BR>
My boding spirit gathers hence<BR>
Dire sins of awful consequence,<BR>
And omens, crowding on my sight,<BR>
Weigh down my soul with wild affright<BR>
Scarce shall I find my friends who dwell<BR>
Here in Ayodhy&aacute; safe and well:<BR>
For surely not without a cause<BR>
This crushing dread my soul o'erawes.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Heart sick, dejected, every sense<BR>
Confused by terror's influence,<BR>
On to the town he quickly swept<BR>
Which King Ikshv&aacute;ku's children kept.<BR>
He passed through Vaijayanta's gate,<BR>
With weary steeds, disconsolate.<BR>
And all who near their station held,<BR>
His escort. crying Victory, swelled,<BR>
With heart distracted still he bowed<BR>
Farewell to all the following crowd,<BR>
Turned to the driver and began<BR>
To question thus the weary man:.<BR>
'Why was I brought, O free from blame,<BR>
So fast, unknown for what I came?<BR>
Yet fear of ill my heart appals,<BR>
And all my wonted courage falls.<BR>
For I have heard in days gone by<BR>
The changes seen when monarchs die;<BR>
And all those signs. O charioteer,<BR>
I see today surround me here:<BR>
Each kinsman's house looks dark and grim,<BR>
No hand delights to keep it trim:<BR>
The beauty vanished. and the pride,<BR>
The doors, unkept, stand open wide.<BR>
No morning rites are offered there,<BR>
No grateful incense loads the air,<BR>
And all therein, with brows o'ercast,<BR>
Sit joyless on the ground and fast.<BR>
Their lovely chaplets dry and dead,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_180"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 180</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Their courts unswept, with dust o'erspread,<BR>
The temples of the Gods to-day<BR>
No more look beautiful and gay.<BR>
Neglected stands each holy shrine,<BR>
Each image of a Lord divine.<BR>
No shop where flowery wreaths are sold<BR>
Is bright and busy as of old.<BR>
The women and the men I mark<BR>
Absorbed in fancies dull and dark,<BR>
Their gloomy eyes with tears bedewed,<BR>
A poor afflicted multitude.'<BR>

<P>
His mind oppressed with woe and dread,<BR>
Thus Bharat to his driver said,<BR>
Viewed the dire signs Ayodhy&aacute; showed,<BR>
And onward to the palace rode.<BR>
