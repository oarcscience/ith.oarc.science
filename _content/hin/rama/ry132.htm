<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LIV.: BHARADV&Aacute;JA'S HERMITAGE.</H3>
<P>
So there that night the heroes spent<BR>
Under the boughs that o'er them bent,<BR>
And when the sun his glory spread,<BR>
Upstarting, from the place they sped.<BR>
On to that spot they made their way,<BR>
Through the dense wood that round them lay,<BR>
Where Yamun&aacute;'s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> swift waters glide<BR>


<P>


<P>
To blend with Gang&aacute;'s holy tide.<BR>
Charmed with the prospect ever new<BR>
The glorious heroes wandered through<BR>
Full many a spot of pleasant ground,<BR>
Rejoicing as they gazed around,<BR>
With eager eye and heart at ease,<BR>
On countless sorts of flowery trees.<BR>
And now the day was half-way sped<BR>
When thus to Lakshman R&aacute;ma said:<BR>
'There, there, dear brother, turn thine eyes;<BR>
See near Pray&aacute;g &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> that smoke arise:<BR>
The banner of our Lord of Flames<BR>
The dwelling of some saint proclaims.<BR>
Near to the place our steps we bend<BR>
Where Yamun&aacute; and Gang&aacute; blend.<BR>
I hear and mark the deafening roar<BR>
When chafing floods together pour.<BR>
See, near us on the ground are left<BR>
Dry logs, by labouring woodmen cleft,<BR>
And the tall trees, that blossom near<BR>
Saint Bharadv&aacute;ja's home, appear.'<BR>

<P>
The bow-armed princes onward passed,<BR>
And as the sun was sinking fast<BR>
They reached the hermit's dwelling, set<BR>
Near where the rushing waters met.<BR>
The presence of the warrior scared<BR>
The deer and birds as on he fared,<BR>
And struck them vith unwonted awe:<BR>
Then Bharadv&aacute;ja's cot they saw.<BR>
The high-souled hermit soon they found<BR>
Girt by his dear disciples round:<BR>
Calm saint, whose vows had well been wrought,<BR>
Whose fervent rites keen sight had bought.<BR>
Duly had flames of worship blazed<BR>
When R&aacute;ma on the hermit gazed:<BR>
His suppliant hands the hero raised,<BR>
Drew nearer to the holy man<BR>
With his companions, and began,<BR>
Declaring both his name and race<BR>
And why they sought that distant place;<BR>
'Saint, Das'aratha's children we,<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman, come to thee.<BR>
This my good wife from Janak springs.<BR>
The best of fair Videha's kings;<BR>
Through lonely wilds, a faultless dame,<BR>
To this pure grove with me she came.<BR>
My younger brother follows still<BR>
Me banished by my father's will:<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;'s son, bound by a vow,--<BR>
He roams the wood beside me now.<BR>
Sent by my father forth to rove,<BR>
We seek, O Saint, some holy grove,<BR>
Where lives of hermits we may lead,<BR>
And upon fruits and berries feed.'<BR>

<P>
When Bharadv&aacute;ja, prudent-souled,<BR>
Had heard the prince his tale unfold,<BR>
Water he bade them bring, a bull,<BR>
And honour-gifts in dishes full,<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And drink and food of varied taste,<BR>
Berries and roots, before him placed,<BR>
And then the great ascetic showed<BR>
A cottage for the guests' abode.<BR>
The saint these honours gladly paid<BR>
To R&aacute;ma who had thither strayed,<BR>
Then compassed sat by birds and deer<BR>
And many a hermit resting near.<BR>
The prince received the service kind,<BR>
And sat him down rejoiced in mind.<BR>
Then Bharadv&aacute;ja silence broke,<BR>
And thus the words of duty spoke:<BR>
'Kakutstha's royal son, that thou<BR>
Hadst sought this grove I knew ere now.<BR>
Mine ears have heard thy story, sent<BR>
Without a sin to banishment.<BR>
Behold, O Prince, this ample space<BR>
Near where the mingling floods embrace,<BR>
Holy, and beautiful, and clear:<BR>
Dwell with us, and be happy here.'<BR>

<P>
By Bharadv&aacute;ja thus addressed,<BR>
R&aacute;ma whose kind and tender breast<BR>
All living things would bless and save,<BR>
In gracious words his answer gave:<BR>

<P>
'My honoured lord, this tranquil spot,<BR>
Fair home of hermits, suits me not:<BR>
For all the neighbouring people here<BR>
Will seek us when they know me near:<BR>
With eager wish to look on me,<BR>
And the Videhan dame to see,<BR>
A crowd of rustics will intrude<BR>
Upon the holy solitude.<BR>
Provide, O gracious lord, I pray,<BR>
Some quiet home that lies away,<BR>
Where my Videhan spouse may dwell<BR>
Tasting the bliss deserved so well.'<BR>

<P>
The hermit heard the prayer he made:<BR>
A while in earnest thought he stayed.<BR>
And then in words like these expressed<BR>
His answer to the chief's request:<BR>
'Ten leagues away there stands a hill<BR>
Where thou mayvst live, if such thy will:<BR>
A holy mount, exceeding fair;<BR>
Great saints have made their dwelling there:<BR>
There great Lang&uacute;rs &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_328"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in thousands play,<BR>
And bears amid the thickets stray;<BR>
Wide-known by Chitrak&uacute;ta's name,<BR>
It rivals Gandham&aacute;dan's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> fame.<BR>
Long as the man that hill who seeks<BR>
Gazes upon its sacred peaks,<BR>
To holy things his soul he gives<BR>
And pure from thought of evil lives.<BR>
There, while a hundred autumns fled,<BR>
Has many a saint with hoary head<BR>
Spent his pure life, and won the prize,<BR>
By deep devotion, in the skies:<BR>

<P>

<P>
Best home, I ween, if such retreat,<BR>
Far from the ways of men, be sweet:<BR>
Or let thy yewre of exile flee<BR>
Here in this hermitage with me.'<BR>

<P>
Thus Bharadv&aacute;ja spake, and trained<BR>
In lore of duty, entertained<BR>
The princes and the dame, and pressed<BR>
Hie friendly gifts on every guest.<BR>

<P>
Thus to Pray&aacute;g the hero went,<BR>
Thus saw the saint preeminent,<BR>
And varied speeches heard and said:<BR>
Then holy night o'er heaven was spread.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma took, by toil oppressed,<BR>
With Sit&aacute; and his brother, rest;<BR>
And so the night, with sweet content,<BR>
In Bharadv&aacute;ja's grove was spent.<BR>
But when the dawn dispelled the night,<BR>
R&aacute;ma approached the anchorite,<BR>
And thus addressed the holy sire<BR>
Whose glory shone like kindled fire:<BR>
'Well have we spent, O truthful Sage,<BR>
The night within thy hermitage:<BR>
Now let my lord his guests permit<BR>
For their new home his grove to quit.'<BR>

<P>
Then, as he saw the morning break,<BR>
Ih answer Bharadv&aacute;ja spake:<BR>
'Go forth to Chitrak&uacute;ta's hill,<BR>
Where berries grow, and sweets distil:<BR>
Full well, I deem, that home will suit<BR>
Thee, R&aacute;ma, strong and resolute.<BR>
Go forth, and Chitrak&uacute;ta seek,<BR>
Famed mountain of the Varied Peak.<BR>
In the wild woods that gird him round<BR>
All creatures of the chase are found:<BR>
Thou in the glades shalt see appear<BR>
Vast herds of elephants and deer.<BR>
With Si'ta there shalt thou delight<BR>
To gaze upon the woody height;<BR>
There with expanding heart to look<BR>
On river, table-land, and brook,<BR>
And see the foaming torrent rave<BR>
Impetuous from the mountain cave.<BR>
Auspicious hill! where all day long<BR>
The lapwing's cry, the Koil's song<BR>
Make all who listen gay:<BR>
Where all is fresh and fair to see,<BR>
Where elephants and deer roam free,<BR>
There, as a hermit, stay.'<BR>
