<P>
The V&aacute;nar watched concealed: each word<BR>
Of S&iacute;t&aacute; and the fiends he heard,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And in a maze of anxious thought<BR>
His quick-conceiving bosom wrought.<BR>
'At length my watchful eyes have seen,<BR>
Pursued so long, the Maithil queen,<BR>
Sought by our V&aacute;nar hosts in vain<BR>
From east to west, from main to main,<BR>
A cautious spy have I explored<BR>
The palace of the R&aacute;khshas lord,<BR>
And thoroughly learned, concealed from sight,<BR>
The giant monarch's power and might.<BR>
And now my task must be to cheer<BR>
The royal dame who sorrows here.<BR>
For if I go, and sooth her not,<BR>
A captive in this distant spot,<BR>
She, when she finds no comfort nigh,<BR>
Will sink beneath her woes and die.<BR>
How shall my tale, if unconsoled<BR>
I leave her. be to R&aacute;ma told?<BR>
How shall I answer Raghu's son,<BR>
'No message from my darling, none!'<BR>
The husband's wrath, to fury fanned,<BR>
Will scorch me lifeless where I stand,<BR>
Or if I urge my lord the king<BR>
To Lank&aacute;'s isle his hosts to bring,<BR>
In vain will be his zeal, in vain<BR>
The toil, the danger, and the pain.<BR>
Yea, this occasion must I seize<BR>
That from her guard the lady frees, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_852"></A><A HREF="#fn_852"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
To win her ear with soft address<BR>
And whisper hope in dire distress.<BR>
Shall I, a puny V&aacute;nar, choose<BR>
The Sanskrit men delight to use?<BR>
If. as a man of Br&aacute;hman kind,<BR>
I speak the tongue by rules refined.<BR>
The lady, yielding to her fears,<BR>
Will think 'tis R&aacute;van's voice she hears.<BR>
I must assume my only plan--<BR>
The language of a common &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_853"></A><A HREF="#fn_853"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> man.<BR>
Yet, if the lidy sees me nigh,<BR>

second passage, may perhaps be understood<BR>
not a language in which words different<BR>
from Sanskrit were used, but the employment<BR>
of formal and elaborate diction,<BR>

<P>
In terror she will start and cry;<BR>
And all the demon band, alarmed,<BR>
Will come with various weapons armed.<BR>
With their wild shouts the grove will fill.<BR>
And strive to take me, or to kill.<BR>
And, at my death or capture, dies<BR>
The hope of R&aacute;ma's enterprise.<BR>
For none can leap, save only me,<BR>
A hundred leagues across the sea.<BR>
It is a sin in me, I own,<BR>
To talk with Janak's child alone.<BR>
Yet greater is the sin if I<BR>
Be silent, and the lady die.<BR>
First I will utter R&aacute;ma's name.<BR>
And laud the hero's gifts and fame.<BR>
Perchance the name she holds so dear<BR>
Will soothe the faithful lady's fear.'<BR>

unmistakeable interpolation. Instead of
advancing the story it goes back to Canto
XVII. containing a lamentation of S&iacute;t&aacute;
after R&aacute;van has left her, and describes the
the auspicious signs sent to cheer her, the
throbbing of her left eye, arm, and side.
The Canto is found in the Bengal recension.
Gorresio translates it. and observes:
"I think that Chapter XXVIII.--The
Auspicious Signs--is an addition, a later
interpolation by the Rhapsodists. It has
no bond of connexion either with what
precedes or follows it, and may be struck
out not only without injury to, but positively
to the advantage of the poem. The
metre in which this chapter is written
differs from that which is generally adopted
in the course of the poem.'</P>
