<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIII.: R&Aacute;VAN'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
But Mah&aacute;p&aacute;rs'va saw the sting<BR>
Of keen reproach had galled the king;<BR>
And humbly, eager to appease<BR>
His anger, spoke in words like these:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'And breathes there one so cold and weak<BR>
The forest and the gloom to seek<BR>
Where savage beasts abound, and spare<BR>
To taste the luscious honey there?<BR>
Art thou not lord? and who is he<BR>
Shall venture to give laws to thee?<BR>
Love thy Videhan still, and tread<BR>
Upon thy prostrate foeman's head.<BR>
O'er Sit&aacute;'s will let thine prevail,<BR>
And strength achieve if flattery fail.<BR>
What though the lady yet be coy<BR>
And turn her from the proffered joy?<BR>
Soon shall her conquered heart relent<BR>
And yield to love and blandishment.<BR>
With us let Kumbhakarna fight,<BR>
And Indrajit of matchless might<BR>
We need not other champions, they<BR>
Shall lead us forth to rout and slay.<BR>
Not ours to bribe or soothe or part<BR>
The foeman's force with gentle art,<BR>
Doomed, conquered by our might, to feel<BR>
The vengeance of the warrior's steel.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The R&aacute;kshas monarch heard, and moved<BR>
By flattering hopes the speech approved:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Hear me,' he cried, 'great chieftain, tell<BR>
What in the olden time befell,--<BR>
A secret tale which, long supressed,<BR>
Lies prisoned only in my breast.<BR>
One day--a day I never forget--<BR>
Fair Punjikasthal&aacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="ry413.htm#fn_932"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I met,<BR>
When, radiant as a flame of fire,<BR>
She sought the palace of the Sire.<BR>
In passion's eager grasp I tore<BR>
From her sweet limbs the robes she wore,<BR>
And heedless of her prayers and cries<BR>
Strained to my breast the vanquised prize.<BR>
Like Nalini &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="ry413.htm#fn_933"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with soil distained.<BR>
The mansion of the Sire she gained,<BR>
And weeping made the outrage known<BR>
To Brahm&aacute; on his heavenly throne.<BR>
He in his wrath pronounced a curse,--<BR>
That lord who made the universe:<BR>
'If, R&aacute;van, thou a second time<BR>
Be guilty of so foul a crime,<BR>
Thy head in shivers shall be rent:<BR>
Be warned, and dread the punishment.<BR>
Awed by the threat of vengeance still<BR>
I force not Sit&aacute;'s stubborn will.<BR>
Terrific as the sea in might:<BR>
My steps are like the Storm-Gods' flight;<BR>
But R&aacute;ma knows not this, or he<BR>
Had never sought to war with me.<BR>
Where is the man would idly brave<BR>
The lion in his mountain cave,<BR>
And wake him when with slumbering eyes<BR>
Grim, terrible as Death, he lies?<BR>
No, blinded R&aacute;ma knows me not:<BR>
Ne'er has he seen mine arrows shot;<BR>
Ne'er marked them speeding to their aim<BR>
Like snakes with cloven tongues of flame.<BR>
On him those arrows will I turn,<BR>
Whose fiery points shall rend and burn.<BR>
Quenched by my power when I assail<BR>
The glory of his might shall fail,<BR>
As stars before the sun grow dim<BR>
And yield their feeble light to him.'<BR>
