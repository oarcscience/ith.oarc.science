<P>
When R&aacute;ma. chief of Raghu's race,<BR>
Arrived at that delightful place,<BR>
He looked on S&iacute;t&aacute; first, and then<BR>
To Lakshman spake the lord of men:<BR>
'Now first the shades of night descend<BR>
Since to the wilds our steps we bend.<BR>
Joy to thee, brother! do not grieve<BR>
For our dear home and all we leave.<BR>
The woods unpeopled seem to weep<BR>
Around us, as their tenants creep<BR>
Or fly to lair and den and nest,<BR>
Both bird and beast, to seek their rest.<BR>
Methinks Ayodhy&aacute;'s royal town<BR>
Where dwells my sire of high renown,<BR>
With all her men and dames to-night<BR>
Will mourn us vanished from their sight.<BR>
For, by his virtues won, they cling<BR>
In fond affection to their king,<BR>
And thee and me, O brave and true,<BR>
And Bharat and S'atrughna too.<BR>
I for my sire and mother feel<BR>
Deep sorrow o'er my bosom steal,<BR>
Lest mourning us, oppressed with fears,<BR>
They blind their eyes with endless tears.<BR>
Yet Bharat's duteous love will show<BR>
Sweet comfort in their hours of woe,<BR>
And with kind words their hearts sustain,<BR>
Suggesting duty, bliss, and gain.<BR>
I mourn my parents now no more:<BR>
I count dear Bharat's virtues o'er,<BR>
And his kind love and care dispel<BR>
The doubts I had, and all is well.<BR>
And thou thy duty wouldst not shun,<BR>
And, following me, hast nobly done;<BR>
Else, bravest, I should need a band<BR>
Around my wife as guard to stand.<BR>
On this first night, my thirst to slake,<BR>
Some water only will I take:<BR>
Thus, brother, thus my will decides,<BR>
Though varied store the wood provides.'<BR>

<P>
Thus having said to Lakshman, he<BR>
Addressed in turn Sumantra: 'Be<BR>
Most diligent to-night, my friend,<BR>
And with due care thy horses tend.'<BR>
The sun had set: Sumantra tied<BR>
His noble horses side by side,<BR>
Gave store of grass with liberal hand,<BR>
And rested near them on the strand.<BR>
Each paid the holy evening rite,<BR>
And when around them fell the night,<BR>
The charioteer, with Lakshman's aid,<BR>
A lowly bed for R&aacute;ma laid.<BR>
To Lakshman R&aacute;ma bade adieu,<BR>
And then by, S&iacute;t&aacute;'s side he threw<BR>
His limbs upon the leafy bed<BR>
Their care upon the bank had spread.<BR>
When Lakshman saw the couple slept,<BR>
Still on the strand his watch he kept,<BR>
Still with Sumantra there conversed,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's varied gifts rehearsed.<BR>
All night he watched, nor sought repose,<BR>
Till on the earth the sun arose:<BR>
With him Sumantra stayed awake,<BR>
And still of R&aacute;ma's virtues spake.<BR>
Thus, near the river's grassy shore<BR>
Which herds unnumbered wandered o'er,<BR>
Repose, untroubled, R&aacute;ma found,<BR>
And all the people lay around.<BR>
The glorious hero left his bed,<BR>
Looked on the sleeping crowd, and said<BR>
To Lakshman, whom each lucky line<BR>
Marked out for bliss with surest sign:<BR>
'O brother Lakshman, look on these<BR>
Reclining at the roots of trees;<BR>
All care of house and home resigned,<BR>
Caring for us with heart and mind,<BR>
These people of the city yearn<BR>

<P>
To see us to our home return:<BR>
To quit their lives will they consent,<BR>
But never leave their firm intent.<BR>
Come, while they all unconscious sleep,<BR>
Let us upon the chariot leap,<BR>
And swiftly on our journey speed<BR>
Where naught our progress may impede,<BR>
That these fond citizens who roam<BR>
Far from Ikshv&aacute;ku's ancient home,<BR>
No more may sleep 'neath bush and tree,<BR>
Following still for love of me.<BR>
A prince with tender care should heal<BR>
The self-brought woes his people feel,<BR>
And never let his subjects share<BR>
The burthen he is forced to bear.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Lakshman to the chief replied,<BR>
Who stood like Justice by his side:<BR>
'Thy rede, O sage, I well commend:<BR>
Without delay the car ascend.'<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma to Sumantra spoke:<BR>
'Thy rapid steeds, I pray thee, yoke.<BR>
Hence to the forest will I go:<BR>
Away, my lord, and be not slow.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sumantra, urged to utmost speed,<BR>
Yoked to the car each generous steed,<BR>
And then, with hand to hand applied,<BR>
He came before the chief and cred:<BR>
'Hail, Prince, whom mighty arms adorn,<BR>
Hail, bravest of the chariot-borne!<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; and thy brother thou<BR>
Mayst mount: the car is ready now.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hero clomb the car with haste:<BR>
His bow and gear within were placed,<BR>
And quick the eddying flood he passed<BR>
Of Tamas&aacute; whose waves run fast.<BR>
Soon as he touched the farther side.<BR>
That strong-armed hero, glorified,<BR>
He found a road both wide and clear,<BR>
Where e'en the timid naught could fear.<BR>
Then, that the crowd might be misled,<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma to Sumantra said:<BR>
'Speed north a while, then hasten back,<BR>
Returning in thy former track,<BR>
That so the people may not learn<BR>
The course I follow: drive and turn.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sumantra, at the chief's behest.<BR>
Quick to the task himself addressed;<BR>
Then near to R&aacute;ma came, and showed<BR>
The chariot ready for the road.<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute;, then, the princely two,<BR>
Who o'er the line of Raghu threw<BR>
A glory ever bright and new,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon the chariot stood.<BR>
Sumantra fast and faster drove<BR>
His horses, who in fleetness strove<BR>
Still onward to the distant grove,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hermit-haunted wood.<BR>
