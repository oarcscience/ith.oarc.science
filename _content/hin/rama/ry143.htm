<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXV.: THE WOMEN'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
And now the night had past away,<BR>
And brightly dawned another day;<BR>
The minstrels, trained to play and sing,<BR>
Flocked to the chamber of the king:<BR>
Bards, who their gayest raiment wore,<BR>
And heralds famed for ancient lore:<BR>
And singers, with their songs of praise,<BR>
Made music in their several ways.<BR>
There as they poured their blessings choice.<BR>
And hailed their king with hand and voice,<BR>
Their praises with a swelling roar<BR>
Echoed through court and corridor.<BR>
Then as the bards his glory sang,<BR>
From beaten palms loud answer rang,<BR>
As glad applauders clapped their hands,<BR>
And told his deeds in distant lands.<BR>
The swelling concert woke a throng<BR>
Of sleeping birds to life and song:<BR>
Some in the branches of the trees,<BR>
Some caged in halls and galleries.<BR>
Nor was the soft string music mute;<BR>
The gentle whisper of the lute,<BR>
And blessings sung by singers skilled<BR>
The palace of the monarch filled.<BR>
Eunuchs and dames of life unstained,<BR>
Each in the arts of waiting trained,<BR>
Drew near attentive as before,<BR>
And crowded to the chamber door:<BR>
These skilful when and how to shed<BR>
The lustral stream o'er limb and head,<BR>
Others with golden ewers stood<BR>
Of water stained with sandal wood.<BR>
And many a maid, pure, young, and fair,<BR>
Her load of early offerings bare,<BR>
Cups of the flood which all revere,<BR>
And sacred things, and toilet gear.<BR>
Each several thing was duly brought<BR>
As rule of old observance taught,<BR>
And lucky signs on each impressed<BR>
Stamped it the fairest and the best.<BR>
There anxious, in their long array,<BR>
All waited till the shine of day:<BR>
But when the king nor rose nor spoke,<BR>
Doubt and alarm within them woke.<BR>
Forthwith the dames, by duty led,<BR>
Attendants on the monarch's bed,<BR>
Within the royal chamber pressed<BR>
To wake their master from his rest.<BR>
Skilled in the lore of dreaming, they<BR>
First touched the bed on which he lay.<BR>
But none replied; no sound was heard.<BR>

Nor hand, nor head, nor body stirred.<BR>
They trembled, and their dread increased,<BR>
Fearing his breath of life had ceased,<BR>
And bending low their heads, they shook<BR>
Like the tall reeds that fringe the brook,<BR>
In doubt and terror down they knelt,<BR>
Looked on his face, his cold hand felt,<BR>
And then the gloomy truth appeared<BR>
Of all their hearts had darkly feared.<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; and Sumitr&aacute;, worn<BR>
With weeping for their sons, forlorn,<BR>
Woke not, but lay in slumber deep<BR>
And still as death's unending sleep.<BR>
Bowed down by grief, her colour fled,<BR>
Her wonted lustre dull and dead,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; shone not, like a star<BR>
Obscured behind a cloudy bar.<BR>
Beside the king's her couch was spread,<BR>
And next was Queen Sumitr&aacute;'s bed,<BR>
Who shone no more with beauty's glow,<BR>
Her face bedewed with tears of woe.<BR>
There lapped in sleep each wearied queen,<BR>
There as in sleep, the king was seen;<BR>
And swift the troubling thought came o'er<BR>
Their spirits that he breathed no more.<BR>
At once with wailing loud and high<BR>
The matrons shrieked a bitter cry,<BR>
As widowed elephants bewail<BR>
Their dead lord in the woody vale.<BR>
At the loud shriek that round them rang,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; and Sumitr&aacute; sprang<BR>
Awakened from their beds, with eyes<BR>
Wide open in their first surprise.<BR>
Quick to the monarch's side they came,<BR>
And saw and touched his lifeless frame;<BR>
One cry, O husband! forth they sent,<BR>
And prostrate to the ground they went.<BR>
The king of Kosal's daughter &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> there<BR>
Writhed, with the dust on limb and hair<BR>
Lustreless, as a star might lie<BR>
Hurled downward from the glorious sky.<BR>
When the king's voice in death was stilled,<BR>
The women who the chamber filled<BR>
Saw, like a widow elephant slain,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; prostrate in her pain.<BR>
Then all the monarch's ladies led<BR>
By Queen Kaikey&iacute; at their head,<BR>
Poured forth their tears, and weeping so,<BR>
Sank on the ground, consumed by woe.<BR>
The cry of grief so long and loud<BR>
Went up from all the royal crowd,<BR>
That, doubled by the matron train,<BR>
It made the palace ring again.<BR>
Filled with dark fear and eager eyes,<BR>
Anxiety and wild surmise;<BR>
Echoing with the cries of grief<BR>
Of sorrowing friends who mourned their chief,<BR>
Dejected, pale with deep distress,<BR>
Hurled from their height of happiness:<BR>
Such was the look the palace wore<BR>
Where lay the king who breathed no more.<BR>
