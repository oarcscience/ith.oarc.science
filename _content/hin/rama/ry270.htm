<P>
'Lord of the mighty arm, of yore<BR>
A shape transcending thought I wore,<BR>
And through the triple world's extent<BR>
My fame for might and valour went.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_313"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 313</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Scarce might the sun and moon on high,<BR>
Scarce Sakra, with ray beauty vie.<BR>
Then for a time this form I took,<BR>
And the great world with trembling shook<BR>
The saints in forest shades who dwelt<BR>
The terror of my presence felt.<BR>
But once I stirred to furious rage<BR>
Great Sth&uacute;las'nas, glorious sage.<BR>
Culling in woods his hermit food<BR>
My hideous shape with fear he viewed.<BR>
Then forth his words of anger burst<BR>
That bade me live a thing accursed:<BR>
'Thou, whose delight is others' pain,<BR>
This grisly form shalt still retain.'<BR>
Then when I prayed him to relent<BR>
And fix some term of punishment,--<BR>
Prayed that the curse at length might cease,<BR>
He bade me thus expect release:<BR>
'Let R&aacute;ma cleave thine arms away<BR>
And on the pyre thy body lay,<BR>
And then shalt thou, set free from doom,<BR>
Thine own fair shape once more assume.'<BR>
O Lakshman, hear my words: in me<BR>
The world-illustrious Danu see.<BR>
By Indra's curse, subdued in fight,<BR>
I wear this form which scares the sight.<BR>
By sternest penance long maintained<BR>
The mighty Father's grace I gained.<BR>
When length of days the God bestowed,<BR>
With foolish pride my bosom glowed.<BR>
My life, of lengthened years assured,<BR>
I deemed from Sakra's might secured.<BR>
Led by my senseless pride astray<BR>
I challenged Indra to the fray.<BR>
A flaming bolt with many a knot<BR>
With his terrific arm he shot.<BR>
And straight my head and thighs compressed<BR>
Were buried in my bulky chest.<BR>
Deaf to each prayer and piteous call<BR>
He sent me not to Yama's hall.<BR>
'These prayers and cries,' he said 'are vain.<BR>
The Father's word must true remain<BR>
But how my lengthened life be spent<BR>
By one the bolt has * and rent?<BR>
How can I live' I cried, 'unfed<BR>
With shattered face and thighs and head?'<BR>
As thus I spoke his grace to crave<BR>
Arms each a league in length he gave,<BR>
And opened in my chest beneath<BR>
This mouth supplied with fearful teeth.<BR>
So my huge arms I used to cast<BR>
Round woodland creatures as they passed,<BR>
And fed within the forest here<BR>
On lion, tiger, pard,* and deer.<BR>
Then Indra spake to soothe my grief:<BR>
'When Rama and his brother chief<BR>
From thy huge bulk those arms shall cleave,<BR>
Then shall the skies thy sould recieve.'<BR>
Disguised in this terrific shape<BR>

<P>
I let no woodland thing escape,<BR>
And still my longing sould was pleased<BR>
Whene'er my arms a victim seized,<BR>
For in these arms I fondly thought<BR>
Would R&aacute;ma's self at last be caught.<BR>
Thus hoping, toiling many a day<BR>
I yearned to cast my life away,<BR>
And here, my lord, thou standest now:<BR>
Blessings be thine for none but thou<BR>
Could cleave my arms with trenchant stroke:<BR>
True are the words the hermit spoke.<BR>
Now let me, best of warriors, lend<BR>
My counsel, and thy plans befriend,<BR>
And aid thee with advice in turn<BR>
If thou with fire my corse wilt burn.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As thus the mighty Danu prayed<BR>
With offer of his friendly aid,<BR>
While Lakshman gazed with anxious eye,<BR>
The virtuous R&aacute;ma made reply:<BR>
'Lakshman and I through forest shade<BR>
From Janasth&aacute;n a while had strayed.<BR>
When none was near her, R&aacute;van came<BR>
And bore away my glorious dame,<BR>
The giant's form and size unknown,<BR>
I learn as yet his name alone.<BR>
Not yet the power and might we know<BR>
Or dwelling of the monstrous foe.<BR>
With none our helpless feet to guide<BR>
We wander here by sorrow tried.<BR>
Let pity move thee to requite<BR>
Our service in the funeral rite.<BR>
Our hands shall bring the boughs that, dry<BR>
Where elephants have rent them, lie,<BR>
Then dig a pit, and light the fire<BR>
To burn thee as the laws require.<BR>
Do thou as meed of this declare<BR>
Who stole my spouse, his dwelling where,<BR>
0, if thou can. I pray thee say,<BR>
And let this grace our deeds repay.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Danu had lent attentive ear<BR>
The words which R&aacute;ma spoke to hear,<BR>
And thus, a speaker skilled and tried.<BR>
To that great orator replied:<BR>
' No heavenly lore my soul endows,<BR>
Naught know I of thy Maithil spouse.<BR>
Yet will I, when my shape I wear.<BR>
Him who will tell thee all declare.<BR>
Then, R&aacute;ma, will my lips disclose<BR>
His name who well that giant knows<BR>
But, till the flames my corse devour<BR>
This hidden knowledge mocks my power.<BR>
For through that curse's withering taint<BR>
My knowledge now is small and faint<BR>
Unknown the giant's very name<BR>
Who bore away the Maithil dame<BR>
Cursed for my evil deeds I wore<BR>
A shape which all the worlds abhor.<BR>
Now ere with wearied steeds the sun<BR>
Through western skies his course have run,<BR>
Deep in a pit my body lay<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_314"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 314</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And burn it in the wonted way.<BR>
When in the grave my corse is placed,<BR>
With fire and funeral honours graced,<BR>
Then I, great chief, his name will tell<BR>
Who knows the giant robber well.<BR>
With him, who guides his life aright,<BR>
In league of trusting love unite,<BR>
And he, O valiant prince, will be<BR>
A faithful friend and aid to thee.<BR>
For, R&aacute;ma, to his searching eyes<BR>
The triple world uncovered lies.<BR>
For some dark cause of old, I ween,<BR>
Through all the spheres his ways have been.'<BR>
