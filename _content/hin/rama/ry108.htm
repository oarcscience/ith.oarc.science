<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXX.: THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE.</H3>
<P>
The daughter of Videha's king,<BR>
While R&aacute;ma strove to soothe the sting<BR>
Of her deep anguish, thus began<BR>
Once more in furtherance of her plan:<BR>
And with her spirit sorely tried<BR>
By fear and anger, love and pride,<BR>
With keenly taunting words addressed<BR>
Her hero of the stately breast:<BR>
'Why did the king my sire, who reigns<BR>
O'er fair Videha's wide domains,<BR>
Hail R&aacute;ma son with joy unwise,<BR>
A woman in a man's disguise?<BR>
Now falsely would the people say,<BR>
By idle fancies led astray,<BR>
That R&aacute;ma's own are power and might,<BR>
As glorious as the Lord of Light.<BR>
Why sinkest thou in such dismay?<BR>
What fears upon thy spirit weigh,<BR>
That thou, O R&aacute;ma, fain wouldst flee<BR>
From her who thinks of naught but thee?<BR>
To thy dear will am I resigned<BR>
In heart and body, soul and mind,<BR>
As S&aacute;vitri gave all to one,<BR>
Satyav&aacute;n, Dyumatsena's son. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Not e'en in fancy can I brook<BR>
To any guard save thee to look:<BR>
Let meaner wives their houses shame,<BR>
To go with thee is all my claim.<BR>
Like some low actor, deemst thou fit<BR>
Thy wife to others to commit--<BR>
Thine own, espoused in maiden youth,<BR>
Thy wife so long, unblamed for truth?<BR>
Do thou, my lord, his will obey<BR>
For whom thou losest royal sway,<BR>
To whom thou wouldst thy wife confide--<BR>
Not me, but thee, his wish may guide.<BR>
Thou must not here thy wife forsake,<BR>
And to the wood thy journey make,<BR>
Whether stern penance, grief, and care,<BR>
Or rule or heaven await thee there.<BR>
Nor shall fatigue my limbs distress<BR>
When wandering in the wilderness:<BR>
Each path which near to thee I tread<BR>
Shall seem a soft luxurious bed.<BR>
The reeds, the bushes where I pass,<BR>
The thorny trees, the tangled grass<BR>
Shall feel, if only thou be near,<BR>
Soft to my touch as skins of deer.<BR>
When the rude wind in fury blows,<BR>
And scattered dust upon me throws,<BR>
That dust, beloved lord, to me<BR>
Shall as the precious sandal be.<BR>
And what shall be more blest than I,<BR>
When gazing on the wood I lie<BR>
In some green glade upon a bed<BR>
With sacred grass beneath us spread?<BR>
The root, the leaf, the fruit which thou<BR>
Shalt give me from the earth or bough,<BR>
Scanty or plentiful, to eat,<BR>
Shall taste to me as Amrit sweet.<BR>
As there I live on flowers and roots<BR>
And every season's kindly fruits,<BR>
I will not for my mother grieve,<BR>
My sire, my home, or all I leave.<BR>
My presence, love, shall never add<BR>
One pain to make the heart more sad;<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
I will not cause thee grief or care,<BR>
Nor be a burden hard to bear.<BR>
With thee is heaven, where'er the spot;<BR>
Each place is hell where thou art not.<BR>
Then go with me, O R&aacute;ma; this<BR>
Is all my hope and all my bliss.<BR>
If thou wilt leave thy wife who still<BR>
Entreats thee with undaunted will,<BR>
This very day shall poison close<BR>
The life that spurns the rule of foes.<BR>
How, after, can my soul sustain<BR>
The bitter life of endless pain,<BR>
When thy dear face, my lord, I miss!<BR>
No, death is better far than this.<BR>
Not for an hour could I endure<BR>
The deadly grief that knows not cure,<BR>
Far less a woe I could not shun<BR>
For ten long years, and three, and one.'<BR>

<P>
While fires of woe consumed her, such<BR>
Her sad appeal, lamenting much;<BR>
Then with a wild cry, anguish-wrung,<BR>
About her husband's neck she clung.<BR>
Like some she-elephant who bleeds<BR>
Struck by the hunter's venomed reeds,<BR>
So in her quivering heart she felt<BR>
The many wounds his speeches dealt.<BR>
Then, as the spark from wood is gained, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Down rolled the tear so long restrained:<BR>
The crystal moisture, sprung from woe,<BR>
From her sweet eyes began to flow,<BR>
As runs the water from a pair<BR>
Of lotuses divinely fair.<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute;'s face with long dark eyes,<BR>
Pure as the moon of autumn skies,<BR>
Faded with weeping, as the buds<BR>
Of lotuses when sink the floods.<BR>
Around his wife his arms he strained,<BR>
Who senseless from her woe remained,<BR>
And with sweet words, that bade her wake<BR>
To life again, the hero spake:<BR>
'I would not with thy woe, my Queen,<BR>
Buy heaven and all its blissful sheen.<BR>
Void of all fear am I as He,<BR>
The self-existent God, can be.<BR>
I knew not all thy heart till now,<BR>
Dear lady of the lovely brow<BR>
So wished not thee in woods to dwell;<BR>
Yet there mine arm can guard thee well.<BR>
Now surely thou, dear love, wast made<BR>
To dwell with me in green wood shade.<BR>
And, as a high saint's tender mind<BR>
Clings to its love for all mankind,<BR>
So I to thee will ever cling,<BR>
Sweet daughter of Videha's king.<BR>
The good, of old, O soft of frame,<BR>
Honoured this duty's sovereign claim,<BR>
And I its guidance will not shun,<BR>
True as light's Queen is to the Sun.<BR>


<P>


<P>
I cannot, pride of Janak's line,<BR>
This journey to the wood decline:<BR>
My sire's behest, the oath he sware,<BR>
The claims of truth, all lead me there.<BR>
One duty, dear the same for aye,<BR>
Is sire and mother to obey:<BR>
Should I their orders once transgress<BR>
My very life were weariness.<BR>
If glad obedience be denied<BR>
To father, mother, holy guide,<BR>
What rites, what service can be done<BR>
That stern Fate's favour may be won?<BR>
These three the triple world comprise,<BR>
O darling of the lovely eyes.<BR>
Earth has no holy thing like these<BR>
Whom with all love men seek to please.<BR>
Not truth, or gift, or bended knee,<BR>
Not honour, worship, lordly fee,<BR>
Storms heaven and wins a blessing thence<BR>
Like sonly love and reverence.<BR>
Heaven, riches, grain, and varied lore,<BR>
With sons and many a blessing more,<BR>
All these are made their own with ease<BR>
By those their elders' souls who please.<BR>
The mighty-souled, who ne'er forget,<BR>
Devoted sons, their filial debt,<BR>
Win worlds where Gods and minstrels are,<BR>
And Brahm&aacute;'s sphere more glorious far.<BR>
Now as the orders of my sire,<BR>
Who keeps the way of truth, require,<BR>
So will I do, for such the way<BR>
Of duty that endures for aye:<BR>
To take thee, love, to Dandak's wild<BR>
My heart at length is reconciled,<BR>
For thee such earnest thoughts impel<BR>
To follow, and with me to dwell.<BR>
O faultless form from feet to brows,<BR>
Come with me, as my will allows,<BR>
And duty there with me pursue,<BR>
Trembler, whose bright eyes thrill me through.<BR>
In all thy days, come good come ill,<BR>
Preserve unchanged such noble will,<BR>
And thou, dear love, wilt ever be<BR>
The glory of thy house and me.<BR>
Now, beauteous-armed, begin the tasks<BR>
The woodland life of hermits asks.<BR>
For me the joys of heaven above<BR>
Have charms no more without thee, love.<BR>
And now, dear S&iacute;t&aacute;, be not slow:<BR>
Food on good mendicants bestow,<BR>
And for the holy Br&aacute;hmans bring<BR>
Thy treasures and each precious thing.<BR>
Thy best attire and gems collect,<BR>
The jewels which thy beauty decked,<BR>
And every ornament and toy<BR>
Prepared for hours of sport and joy:<BR>
The beds, the cars wherein I ride,<BR>
Among our followers, next, divide.'<BR>

<P>
She conscious that her lord approved<BR>
Her going, with great rapture moved,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Hastened within, without delay,<BR>
Prepared to give their wealth away.<BR>
