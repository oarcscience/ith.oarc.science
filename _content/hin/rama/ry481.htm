<P>
Then M&aacute;tali to R&aacute;ma cried:<BR>
'Let other arms the day decide.<BR>
Why wilt thou strive with useless toil<BR>
And see his might thy efforts foil?<BR>
Launch at the foe thy dart whose fire<BR>
Was kindled by the Almighty Sire.'<BR>
He ceased: and Raghu's son obeyed:<BR>
Upon his string the hero laid<BR>
An arrow, like a snake that hissed.<BR>
Whose fiery flight had never missed:<BR>
The arrow Saint Agastya gave<BR>
And blessed the chieftain's life to save<BR>
That dart the Eternal Father made<BR>
The Monarch of the Gods to aid;<BR>
By Brahm&aacute;'s self on him bestowed<BR>
When forth to fight Lord Indra rode.<BR>
'Twas feathered with the rushing wind;<BR>
The glowing sun and fire combined<BR>
To the keen point their splendour lent;<BR>
The shaft, ethereal element,<BR>
By Meru's hill and Mandar, pride<BR>
Of mountains, had its weight supplied.<BR>
He laid it on the twisted cord,<BR>
He turned the point at Lank&aacute;'s lord,<BR>
And swift the limb-dividing dart<BR>
Pierced the huge chest and cleft the heart,<BR>
And dead he fell upon the plain<BR>
Like Vritra by the Thunderer slain.<BR>
The R&aacute;kahas host when R&aacute;van fell<BR>
Sent forth a wild terrific yell,<BR>
Then turned and fled, all hope resigned,<BR>
Through Lank&aacute;'s gates, nor looked behind<BR>
His voice each joyous V&aacute;nar raised,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, conquering R&aacute;ma, praised.<BR>
Soft from celestial minstrels came<BR>
The sound of music and acclaim.<BR>
Soft, fresh, and cool, a rising breeze<BR>
Brought odours from the heavenly trees,<BR>
And ravishing the sight and smell<BR>
A wondrous rain of blossoms fell:<BR>
And voices breathed round Raghu's son:<BR>
'Champion of Gods, well done, well done.'<BR>
