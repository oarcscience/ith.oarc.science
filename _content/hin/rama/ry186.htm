<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CVIII.: J&Aacute;V&Aacute;LI'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Thus R&aacute;ma soothed his brother's grief:<BR>
Then virtuous J&aacute;v&aacute;li, chief<BR>
Of twice-born sages, thus replied<BR>
In words that virtue's law defied:<BR>
'Hail, Raghu's princely son, dismiss<BR>
A thought so weak and vain as this.<BR>
Canst thou, with lofty heart endowed,<BR>
Think with the dull ignoble crowd?<BR>
For what are ties of kindred? can<BR>
One profit by a brother man?<BR>
Alone the babe first opes his eyes,<BR>
And all alone at last he dies.<BR>
The man, I ween, has little sense<BR>
Who looks with foolish reverence<BR>
On father's or on mother's name:<BR>
In others, none a right may claim.<BR>
E'en as a man may leave his home<BR>
And to a distant village roam,<BR>
Then from his lodging turn away<BR>
And journey on the following day,<BR>
Such brief possession mortals hold<BR>
In sire and mother, house and gold,<BR>
And never will the good and wise<BR>
The brief uncertain lodging prize.<BR>
Nor, best of men, shouldst thou disown<BR>
Thy sire's hereditary throne,<BR>
And tread the rough and stony ground<BR>
Where hardship, danger, woes abound.<BR>
Come, let Ayodhy&aacute; rich and bright<BR>
See thee enthroned with every rite:<BR>
Her tresses bound in single braid &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_387"></A><A HREF="ry187.htm#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
She waits thy coming long delayed.<BR>
O come, thou royal Prince, and share<BR>
The kingly joys that wait thee there,<BR>
And live in bliss transcending price<BR>
As Indra lives in Paradise.<BR>
The parted king is naught to thee,<BR>
Nor right in living man has he:<BR>
The king is one; thou, Prince of men,<BR>
Another art: be counselled then.<BR>
Thy royal sire, O chief, has sped<BR>
On the long path we all must tread.<BR>
The common lot of all is this,<BR>
And thou in vain art robbed of bliss.<BR>
For those--and only those--I weep<BR>
Who to the path of duty keep;<BR>
For here they suffer ceaseless woe,<BR>
And dying to destruction go.<BR>
With pious care, each solemn day,<BR>
Will men their funeral offerings pay:<BR>
See, how the useful food they waste:<BR>
He who is dead no more can taste.<BR>
If one is fed, his strength renewed<BR>
Whene'er his biother takes his food,<BR>
Then offerings to the parted pay;<BR>
Scarce will they serve him on his way.<BR>
By crafty knaves these rites were framed,<BR>
And to enforce men's gifts proclaimed;<BR>
'Give, worship, lead a life austere,<BR>
Keep lustral rites, quit pleasures here.'<BR>
There is no future life: be wise,<BR>
And do, O Prince, as I advise.<BR>
Enjoy, my lord, thy present bliss,<BR>
And things unseen from thought dismiss.<BR>
Let this advice thy bosom move,<BR>
The counsel sage which all approve;<BR>
To Bharat's earnest prayer incline,<BR>
And take the rule so justly thine.'<BR>
