### CANTO VIII.: THE HERMITAGE.

So Ráma and Sumttrá's son,  
When every honour due was done,  
Slept through the night. When morning  
   broke,  
The heroes from their rest awoke.  
Betimes the son of Raghu rose,  
With gentle Sítá, from repose,  
And sipped the cool delicious wave  
Sweet with the scent the lotus gave,  
Then to the Gods and sacred flame  
The heroes and the lady came,  
And bent their heads in honour meet  
Within the hermit's pure retreat.  
When every stain was purged away,  
They saw the rising Lord of Day:  
Then to Sutíkhna's side they went,  
And softly spoke, most reverent:  
   'Well have we slept, O holy lord,  
Honoured of thee by all adored:  
Now leave to journey forth we pray:  
These hermits urge us on our way.  
We haste to visit, wandering by,  
The ascetics' homes that round you lie,  
And roaming Dandak's mighty wood  
To view each saintly brotherhood,  
For thy permission now we sue,  
With these high saints to duty true,  
By penance taught each sense to tame,--  
In lustre like the smokeless flame.  
Ere on our brows the sun can beat  
With fierce intolerable heat.  
Like some unworthy lord who wins  
His power by tyranny and sins,  
O saint, we fain would part.' The three  
Bent humbly to the dovotee.  
He raised the princes as they pressed  
His feet, and strained them to his breast;  
And then the chief of devotees  
Bespake them both in words like these.  
'Go with thy brother, Ráma, go,  
Pursue thy path untouched by woe:  
Go with thy faithful Sítá, she  
Still like a shadow follows thee  
Roam Dandak wood observing well  
The pleasant homes where hermits dwell,--  
Pure saints whose ordered souls adhere  
To penance rites and vows austere.  

There plenteous roots and berries grow,  
And noble trees their blossoms show,  
And gentle deer and birds of air  
In peaceful troops are gathered there.  
There see the full-blown lotus stud  
The bosom of the lucid flood,  
And watch the joyous mallard shake  
The reeds that fringe the pool and lake.  
See with delighted eye the rill  
Leap sparkling from her parent hill,  
And hear the woods that round thee lie  
Reëcho to the peacock's cry.  
And as I bid thy brother, so,  
Sumitrá's child, I bid thee go.  
Go forth, these varied beauties see,  
And then once more return to me.'  
   Thus spake the sage Sutikshna: both  
The chiefs assented, nothing loth.  
Round him with circling steps they paced,  
Then for the road prepared with haste.  
Tnere Sítá stood, the dame long-eyed,  
Fair quivers round their waists she tied,  
And gave each prince his trusty bow,  
And sword which ne\*er a spot might know.  
Each took his quiver from her \*and.  
And clanging bow and gleaming brand:  
Then from the hermits' home the two  
Went forth each woodland scene to view.  
Eavh beauteous in the bloom of age,  
Dismissed by that illustrious sage,  
With bow and sword accoutred, hied  
Away, and Sítá by their side.
