<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CXII.: THE SANDALS.</H3>
<P>
High wonder mingled with delight<BR>
Took the great sages at the sight.<BR>
Thrilling their breasts who came to view<BR>
The meeting of the peerless two.<BR>
The saints and sages' holy train<BR>
Departed to their home again.<BR>
And high each holy voice was raised,<BR>
And thus the glorious brothers praised.<BR>

<P>
'High fate is his, the sire of two<BR>
Most virtuous sous, so brave and true:<BR>
With wonder and with joy intense<BR>
Our ears have heard their conference.<BR>
Then the great sages, longing all<BR>
To see the ten-necked tyrant &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_395"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> fall,<BR>
To Bharat, bravest of the brave,<BR>
Their salutary counsel gave:<BR>

<P>
'O thou of lofty lineage born,<BR>
Whom wisdom, conduct, fame adorn,<BR>
Thou for thy honoured father's sake<BR>
Shouldst R&aacute;ma's righteous counsel take.<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
All debts to Queen Kaikey&iacute; paid,<BR>
Thy sire his home in heaven has made,<BR>
So virtuous R&aacute;ma we would see<BR>
From filial obligation free.'<BR>
Thus gave each royal sage advice,<BR>
High saint, and bard of Paradise;<BR>
Then quickly vanishing from view<BR>
Each to his proper home withdrew.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma's face his rapture showed,<BR>
And his full heart with joy o'erflowed,<BR>
While, as the sages parted thence,<BR>
He paid his humble reverence.<BR>

<P>
Then Bharat shook in every limb<BR>
As suppliant thus he spake to him:<BR>
'The duty of a king respect,<BR>
Held by our race in high respect:<BR>
And O, thy gracious ear incline<BR>
To heed my mother's prayer and mine.<BR>
The mighty realm to rule and guard<BR>
For me alone is task too hard.<BR>
No power have I the love to gain<BR>
Of noble, citizen, and swain.<BR>
All those who know thee, warrior, friend,<BR>
On thee their eager glances bend,<BR>
As labouring hinds who till the plain<BR>
Look fondly for the Lord of Rain.<BR>
O wisest Prince, thy realm secure,<BR>
And make its firm foundations sure.<BR>
Kakutstha's son, thy mighty arm<BR>
Can keep the nation free from harm.'<BR>
He spoke, and fell in sorrow drowned<BR>
At R&aacute;ma's feet upon the ground,<BR>
And there the hero sued and sighed,<BR>
And 'Hear me, Raghu's son,' he cried.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma raised him up, and pressed<BR>
His brother to his loving breast,<BR>
And sweetly as a wild swan cried<BR>
To Bharat dark and lotus-eyed:<BR>

<P>
'So just and true thy generous soul,<BR>
Thy hand may well this earth control:<BR>
But many a sage his aid will lend.<BR>
With counsellor, and peer, and friend:<BR>
With these advise: their counsel ask,<BR>
And so perform thy arduous task.<BR>
The moon his beauty may forgo,<BR>
The cold forsake the Hills of Snow,<BR>
And Ocean o'er his banks may sweep,<BR>
But I my father's word will keep.<BR>
Now whether love of thee or greed<BR>
Thy mother led to plan the deed,<BR>
Forth from thy breast the memory throw,<BR>
And filial love and reverence show.'<BR>
Thus spake Kaus'aly&aacute;'s son: again<BR>
Bharat replied in humble strain<BR>
To him who matched the sun in might<BR>
And lovely as the young moon's light:<BR>
'Put, noble brother, I entreat,<BR>
These sandals on thy blessed feet:<BR>
These, lord of men, with gold bedecked,<BR>
The realm and people will protect.'<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, as his brother prayed<BR>
Beneath his feet the sandals laid,<BR>
And these with fond affection gave<BR>
To Bharat's hand, the good and brave.<BR>
Then Bharat bowed his reverent head<BR>
And thus again to R&aacute;ma said:<BR>
'Through fourteen seasons will I wear<BR>
The hermit's dress and matted hair:<BR>
With fruit and roots my life sustain,<BR>
And still beyond the realm remain,<BR>
Longing for thee to come again.<BR>
The rule and all affairs of state<BR>
I to these shoes will delegate.<BR>
And if, O tamer of thy foes,<BR>
When fourteen years have reached their close,<BR>
I see thee not that day return,<BR>
The kindled fire my frame shall burn.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma to his bosom drew<BR>
Dear Bharat and S'atrughna too:<BR>
'Be never wroth,' he cried, 'with her,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;'s guardian minister:<BR>
This, glory of Ikshv&aacute;ku's line,<BR>
Is S&iacute;t&aacute;'s earnest prayer and mine.'<BR>
He spoke, and as the big tears fell,<BR>
To his dear brother bade farewell.<BR>
Round R&aacute;ma, Bharat strong and bold<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    In humble reverence paced,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When the bright sandals wrought with gold<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Above his brows were placed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The royal elephant who led<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The glorious pomp he found,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And on the monster's mighty head<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Those sandals duly bound.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then noble Rama, born to swell<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The glories of his race,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To all in order bade farewell<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With love and tender grace--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To brothers, counsellers, and peers,--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Still firm, in duty proved,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Firm, as the Lord of Snow uprears<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His mountains unremoved.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  No queen, for choking sobs and sighs,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Could say her last adieu:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma bowed, with flooded eyes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And to his cot withdrew.<BR>
