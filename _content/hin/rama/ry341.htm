<P>
The chieftain turned his glances where<BR>
The legions sat in mute despair;<BR>
And then to Hanum&aacute;n, the best<BR>
Of V&aacute;nar lords, these words addressed:<BR>
'Why still, and silent, and apart,<BR>
O hero of the dauntless heart?<BR>
Thou keepest measured in thy mind<BR>
The laws that rule the V&aacute;nar kind,<BR>
Strong as our king Sugriva, brave<BR>
As R&aacute;ma's self to slay or save,<BR>
Through every land thy praise is heard,<BR>
Famous as that illustrious bird,<BR>
Arishtanemi's son, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_783"></A><A HREF="#fn_783"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the king<BR>
Of every fowl that plies the wing.<BR>
Oft have I seen the monarch sweep<BR>
With sounding pinions o'er the deep,<BR>
And in his mighty talons bear<BR>
Huge serpents struggling through the air.<BR>
Thy arms, O hero, match in might<BR>
The ample wings he spreads for flight;<BR>
And thou with him mayest well compare<BR>
In power to do, in heart to dare.<BR>
Why, rich in wisdom, power, and skill,<BR>
O hero, mt thou lingering still?<BR>
An Apsaras &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_784"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the fairest found<BR>
Of nymphs for heavenly charms renowned,<BR>
Sweet Punjikasthal&aacute;, became<BR>
A noble V&aacute;nar's wedded dame.<BR>
Her heavenly title heard no more,<BR>
Anjan&aacute; was the name she bore,<BR>
When, cursed by Gods, from heaven she fell<BR>
In V&aacute;nar form on earth to dwell,<BR>
New-born in mortal shape the ch*ild<BR>
Of Kunjar monarch of the wild.<BR>
In youthful beauty wondrous fair,<BR>
A crown of jewels about her hair,<BR>
In silken robes of richest dye<BR>
She roamed the hills that kiss the sky.<BR>
Once in her tinted garments dressed<BR>
She stood upon the mountain crest,<BR>
The God of Wind beside her came,<BR>
And breathed upon the lovely dame.<BR>
And as he fanned her robe aside<BR>
The wondrous beauty that he eyed<BR>
In rounded lines of breast and limb<BR>
And neck and shoulder ravished him;<BR>
And captured by her peerless charms<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
He strained her in his amorous arms,<BR>
Then to the eager God she cried<BR>
In trembling accents, terrified:<BR>
'Whose impious love has wronged a spouse<BR>
So constant in her nuptial vows?'<BR>
He heard, and thus his answer made:<BR>
'O, be not troubled, nor afraid.<BR>
But trust, and thou shalt know ere long<BR>
My love has done thee, sweet, no wrong.<BR>
So strong and brave and wise shall be<BR>
The glorious child I give to thee.<BR>
Might shall be his that naught can tire,<BR>
And limbs to spring as springs his sire,'<BR>
Thus spoke the God; the conquered dame<BR>
Rejoiced in heart nor feared me shame.<BR>
Down in a cave beneath the earth<BR>
The happy mother gave thee birth.<BR>
Once o'er the summit of the wood<BR>
Before thine eyes the new sun stood.<BR>
Thou sprangest up in haste to seize<BR>
What seemed the fruitage of the trees.<BR>
Up leapt the child, a wondrous bound,<BR>
Three hundred leagues above the ground,<BR>
And, though the angered Day-God shot<BR>
His fierce beams on him, feared him not.<BR>
Then from the hand of Indra came<BR>
A red bolt winged with wrath and flame.<BR>
The child fell smitten on a rock.<BR>
His cheek was shattered by the shock,<BR>
Named Hanum&aacute;n &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_785"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> thenceforth by all<BR>
In memory of the fearful fall,<BR>
The wandering Wind-God saw thee lie<BR>
With bleeding cheek and drooping eye,<BR>
And stirred to anger by thy woe<BR>
Forbade each scented breeze to blow.<BR>
The breath of all the worlds was stilled,<BR>
And the sad Gods with terror filled<BR>
Prayed to the Wind, to calm the ire<BR>
And soothe the sorrow of the sire.<BR>
His fiery wrath no longer glowed,<BR>
And Brahm&aacute;'s self the boon bestowed<BR>
That in the brunt of battle none<BR>
Should slay with steel the Wind-God's son.<BR>
Lord Indra, sovereign of the skies,<BR>
Bent on thee all his thousand eyes,<BR>
And swore that ne'er the bolt which he<BR>
Hurls from the heaven should injure thee,<BR>
'Tis thine, O mighty chief, to share<BR>
The Wind-God's power, his son and heir.<BR>
Sprung from that glorious father thou.<BR>
And thou alone, canst aid us now.<BR>
This earth of yore, through all her climes,<BR>
I circled one-and-twenty times,<BR>
And gathered, as the Gods decreed,<BR>
Great store of herbs from hill and mead,<BR>
Which, scattered o'er the troubled wave.<BR>
The Amrit to the toilers gave,<BR>

<P>
But now my days are wellnigh told,<BR>
My strength is gone, my limbs are old,<BR>
And thou, the bravest and the best,<BR>
Art the sure hope of all the rest.<BR>
Now, mighty chief, the task assay:<BR>
Thy matchless power and strength display<BR>
Rise up, O prince, our second king,<BR>
And o'er the flood of ocean spring.<BR>
So shall the glorious exploit vie<BR>
With his who stepped through earth and sky.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_786"></A><A HREF="ry342.htm#fn_786"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
He spoke: the younger chieftain heard,<BR>
His soul to vigorous effort stirred,<BR>
And stood before their joyous eyes<BR>
Dilated in gigantic size.<BR>
