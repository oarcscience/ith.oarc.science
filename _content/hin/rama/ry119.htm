<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLI.: THE CITIZENS' LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
The lion chief with hands upraised<BR>
Was born from eyes that fondly gazed.<BR>
But then the ladies' bower was rent<BR>
With cries of weeping and lament:<BR>
'Where goes he now, our lord, the sure<BR>
Protector of the friendless poor,<BR>
In whom the wretched and the weak<BR>
Defence and aid were wont to seek?<BR>
All words of wrath he turned aside,<BR>
And ne'er, when cursed, in ire replied.<BR>
He shared his people's woe, and stilled<BR>
The troubled breast which rage had filled.<BR>
Our chief, on lofty thoughts intent,<BR>
In glorious fame preeminent:<BR>
As on his own dear mother, thus<BR>
He ever looked on each of us.<BR>
Where goes he now? His sire's behest,<BR>
By Queen Kaikey&iacute;'s guile distressed,<BR>
Has banished to the forest hence<BR>
Him who was all the world's defence.<BR>
Ah, senseless King, to drive away<BR>
The hope of men, their guard and stay,<BR>
To banish to the distant wood<BR>
R&aacute;ma the duteous, true, and good!'<BR>
The royal dames, like cows bereaved<BR>
Of their young calves, thus sadly grieved.<BR>
The monarch heard them as they wailed,<BR>
And by the fire of grief assailed<BR>
For his dear son, he bowed his head,<BR>
And all his sense and memory fled.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then were no fires of worship fed,<BR>
Thick darkness o'er the sun was spread.<BR>
The cows their thirsty calves denied,<BR>
And elephants flung their food aside.<BR>

Tris'anku, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_315"></A><A HREF="ry120.htm#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Jupiter looked dread,<BR>
And Mercury and Mars the red,<BR>
In direful opposition met,<BR>
The glory of the moon beset.<BR>
The lunar stars withheld their light,<BR>
The planets were no longer bright,<BR>
But meteors with their horrid glare,<BR>
And dire Vis'&aacute;kh&aacute;s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_316"></A><A HREF="ry120.htm#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> lit the air.<BR>
As troubled Ocean heaves and raves<BR>
When Doom's wild tempest sweeps the waves,<BR>
Thus all Ayodhy&aacute; reeled and bent<BR>
When R&aacute;ma to the forest went.<BR>
And chilling grief and dark despair<BR>
Fell suddenly on all men there.<BR>
Their wonted pastime all forgot,<BR>
Nor thought of food, or touched it not.<BR>
Crowds in the royal street were seen<BR>
With weeping eye and troubled mien:<BR>
No more a people gay and glad,<BR>
Each head and heart was sick and sad.<BR>
No more the cool wind softly blew,<BR>
The moon no more was fair to view,<BR>
No more the sun with genial glow<BR>
Cherished the world now plunged in woe.<BR>
Sons, brothers, husbands, wedded wives<BR>
Forgot the ties that joined their lives;<BR>
No thought for kith and kin was spared,<BR>
But all for only R&aacute;ma cared.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's friends who loved him best,<BR>
Their minds disordered and distressed.<BR>
By the great burthen of their woes<BR>
Turned not to slumber or repose.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like Earth with all her hills bereft<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of Indra's guiding care.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ayodhy&aacute; in her sorrow left<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    By him, the high souled heir.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Was bowed by fear and sorrow's force,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And shook with many a throe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  While warrior, elephant, and horse<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Sent up the cry of woe.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_314"></A><A HREF="ry118.htm#fr_314">143:1</A>  'Thirty centuries have passed since he
began this memorable journey. Every step
of it is known and is annually traversed
by thousands: hero worship is not extinct.
What can Faith do! How strong are the
ties of religion when entwined with the
legends of a country! How many a cart
creeps creaking and weary along the road
from Ayodhy&aacute; to Chitrak&uacute;t. It is this
that gives the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan a strange interest,
the story still lives.' <I>Calcutta Review:
