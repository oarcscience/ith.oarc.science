<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LIII.: R&Aacute;MA'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
When evening rites were duly paid,<BR>
Reclined beneath the leafy shade,<BR>
To Lakshman thus spake R&aacute;ma, best<BR>
Of those who glad a people's breast:<BR>
'Now the first night has closed the day<BR>
That saw us from our country stray,<BR>
And parted from the charioteer;<BR>
Yet grieve not thou, my brother dear.<BR>
Henceforth by night, when others sleep,<BR>
Must we our careful vigil keep,<BR>
Watching for S&iacute;t&aacute;'s welfare thus,<BR>
For her dear life depends on us.<BR>
Bring me the leaves that lie around,<BR>
And spread them here upon the ground,<BR>
That we on lowly beds may lie,<BR>
And let in talk the night go by.'<BR>

<P>
So on the ground with leaves o'erspread,<BR>
He who should press a royal bed,<BR>
R&aacute;ma with Lakshman thus conversed,<BR>
And many a pleasant tale rehearsed:<BR>
'This night the king,' he cried, 'alas!<BR>
In broken sleep will sadly pass.<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; now content should be,<BR>
For mistress of her wish is she.<BR>
So fiercely she for empire yearns,<BR>
That when her Bharat home returns,<BR>
She in her greed, may even bring<BR>
Destruction on our lord the king.<BR>
What can he do, in feeble eld,<BR>
Reft of all aid and me expelled,<BR>
His soul enslaved by love, a thrall<BR>
Obedient to Kaikey&iacute;'s call?<BR>
As thus I muse upon his woe<BR>
And all his wisdoms overthrow,<BR>
Love is, methinks, of greater might<BR>
To stir the heart than gain and right.<BR>
For who, in wisdom's lore untaught.<BR>
Could by a beauty's prayer be bought<BR>
To quit his own obedient son,<BR>
Who loves him, as my sire has done!<BR>
Bharat, Kaikey&iacute;'s child, alone<BR>
Will, with his wife, enjoy the throne,<BR>
And blissfully his rule maintain<BR>
O'er happy Kos'ala's domain.<BR>
To Bharat's single lot will fall<BR>
The kingdom and the power and all,<BR>
When fails the king from length of days,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma in the forest strays.<BR>
Whoe'er, neglecting right and gain,<BR>
Lets conquering love his soul enchain,<BR>
To him, like Das'aratha's lot,<BR>
Comes woe with feet that tarry not.<BR>
Methinks at last the royal dame,<BR>
Dear Lakshman, has secured her aim,<BR>
To see at once her husband dead,<BR>
Her son enthroned, and R&aacute;ma fled.<BR>
Ah me! I fear, lest borne away<BR>
By frenzy of success, she slay<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;, through her wicked hate<BR>
Of me, bereft, disconsolate;<BR>
Or her who aye for me has striven<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;, to devotion given.<BR>
Hence, Lakshman, to Avodhy&aacute; speed,<BR>
Returning in the hour of need.<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; I my steps will bend<BR>
Where Dandak's mighty woods extend.<BR>
No guardian has Kaus'aly&aacute; now:<BR>
O, be her friend and guardian thou.<BR>
Strong hate may vile Kaikey&iacute; lead<BR>
To many a base unrighteous deed,<BR>
Treading my mother 'neath her feet<BR>
When Bharat holds the royal seat.<BR>
Sure in some antenatal time<BR>
Were children, by Kausaly&aacute;'s crime.<BR>
Torn from their mothers' arms away,<BR>
And hence she mourns this evil day.<BR>
She for her child no toil would spare<BR>
Tending me long with pain and care;<BR>
Now in the hour of fruitage she<BR>
Has lost that son, ah, woe is me.<BR>
O Lakshman, may no matron e'er<BR>
A son so doomed to sorrow bear<BR>
As I, my mother's heart who rend<BR>
With anguish that can never end.<BR>
The S&aacute;rik&aacute;, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> methinks, possessed<BR>
More love than glows in R&aacute;ma's breast.<BR>
Who, as the tale is told to us.<BR>
Addressed the stricken parrot thus:<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
'Parrot, the capturer's talons tear,<BR>
While yet alone thou flutterest there.<BR>
Before his mouth has closed on me:'<BR>
So cried the bird, herself to free.<BR>
Reft of her son, in childless woe,<BR>
My mother's tears for ever flow:<BR>
Ill-fated, doomed with grief to strive.<BR>
What aid can she from me derive?<BR>
Pressed down by care, she cannot rise<BR>
From sorrow's flood wherein she lies.<BR>
In righteous wrath my single arm<BR>
Could, with my bow, protect from harm<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;'s town and all the earth:<BR>
But what is hero prowess worth?<BR>
Lest breaking duty's law I sin,<BR>
And lose the heaven I strive to win,<BR>
The forest life today I choose,<BR>
And kingly state and power refuse.'<BR>

<P>
Thus mourning in that lonely spot<BR>
The troubled chief bewailed his lot,<BR>
And filled with tears, his eyes ran o'er;<BR>
Then silent sat, and spake no more.<BR>
To him, when ceased his loud lament,<BR>
Like fire whose brilliant might is spent.<BR>
Or the great sea when sleeps the wave,<BR>
Thus Lakshman consolation gave:<BR>
'Chief of the brave who bear the bow,<BR>
E'en now Ayodhy&aacute;, sunk in woe,<BR>
By thy departure reft of light<BR>
Is gloomy as the moonless night.<BR>
Unfit it seems that thou, O chief.<BR>
Shouldst so afflict thy soul with grief,<BR>
So with thou S&iacute;t&aacute;'s heart consign<BR>
To deep despair as well as mine.<BR>
Not I, O Raghu's son, nor she<BR>
Could live one hour deprived of thee:<BR>
We were, without thine arm to save,<BR>
Like fish deserted by the wave.<BR>
Although my mother dear to meet,<BR>
S'atrughna and the king, were sweet,<BR>
On them, or heaven, to feed mine eye<BR>
Were nothing, if thou wert not by.'<BR>

<P>
Sitting at ease, their glances fell<BR>
Upon the beds, constructed well.<BR>
And there the sons of virtue laid<BR>
Their limps beneath the fig tree's shade.<BR>
