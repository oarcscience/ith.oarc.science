Where stately mansions rose around,<BR>
A palace fairer still he found,<BR>
Whose royal height and splendour showed<BR>
Where Ravan's self, the king, abode,<BR>
A chosen band with bow and sword<BR>
Guarded the palace of their lord,<BR>
Where R&aacute;ksha's dames of noble race<BR>
And many a princess fair of face<BR>
Whom R&aacute;van's arm had torn away<BR>
From vanquished kings in slumber lay.<BR>

There jewelled arches high o'erhead<BR>
An ever-changing lustre shed<BR>
From ruby, pearl, and every gem<BR>
On golden pillars under them.<BR>
Delicious came the tempered air<BR>
That breathed a heavenly summer there,<BR>
Stealing through bloomy trees that bore<BR>
Each pleasant fruit in endless store.<BR>
No check was there from jealous guard,<BR>
No door was fast, no portal barred;<BR>
Only a sweet air breathed to meet<BR>
The stranger, as a host should greet<BR>
A wanderer of his kith and kin<BR>
And woo his weary steps within.<BR>
He stood within a spacious hall<BR>
With fretted roof and painted wall,<BR>
The giant R&aacute;van's boast and pride,<BR>
Loved even as a lovely bride.<BR>
'Twere long to tell each marvel there,<BR>
The crystal floor, the jewelled stair,<BR>
The gold, the silver, and the shine<BR>
Of chrysolite and almandine.<BR>
There breathed the fairest blooms of spring;<BR>
There flashed the proud swan's silver wing,<BR>
The splendour of whose feathers broke<BR>
Through fragrant wreaths of aloe smoke.<BR>
'Tis lndra's heaven,' the V&aacute;nar cried<BR>
Gazing in joy from side to side;<BR>
'The home of all the Gods is this,<BR>
The mansion of eternal bliss.'<BR>
There were the softest carpets spread,<BR>
Delightful to the sight and tread,<BR>
Where many a lovely woman lay<BR>
O'ercome by sleep, fatigued with play.<BR>
The wine no longer cheered the feast,<BR>
The sound of revelry had ceased.<BR>
The tinkling feet no longer stirred,<BR>
No chiming of a zone was heard.<BR>
So when each bird has sought her nest<BR>
And swans are mute and wild bees rest,<BR>
Sleep the fair lilies on the lake<BR>
Till the sun's kiss shall bid them wake.<BR>
Like the calm field of winter's sky<BR>
Which stars unnumbered glorify,<BR>
So shone and glowed the sumptuous room<BR>
With living stars that chased the gloom.<BR>
'These are the stars,' the chieftain cried,<BR>
'In autumn nights that earth-ward glide,<BR>
In brighter forms to reappear<BR>
And shine in matchless lustre here.'<BR>
With wondering eyes a while he viewed<BR>
Each graceful form and attitude.<BR>
One lady's head was backward thrown,<BR>
Bare was her arm and loose her zone.<BR>
The garland that her brow had graced<BR>
Hung closely round another's waist.<BR>
Here gleamed two little feet all bare<BR>
Of anklets that had sparkled there,<BR>
Here lay a queenly dame at rest<BR>
In all her glorious garments dressed,<BR>
There slept another whose small hand<BR>
Had loosened every tie and band,<BR>
In careless grace another lay<BR>
Wide gems and jewels cast away,<BR>
Like a young creeper when the tread<BR>
Of the wild elephant has spread<BR>
Confusion and destruction round,<BR>
And cast it flowerless to the ground.<BR>
Here lay a slumberer still as death,<BR>
Save only that her balmy breath<BR>
Raised ever and anon the lace<BR>
that floated o'er her sleeping face.<BR>
There, sunk in sleep, an amorous maid<BR>
Her sweet head on a mirror laid,<BR>
Like a fair lily bending till<BR>
Her petals rest upon the rill.<BR>
Another black-eyed damsel pressed<BR>
Her lute upon her heaving breast,<BR>
As though her loving arms were twined<BR>
Round him for whom her bosom pined.<BR>
Another pretty sleeper round<BR>
A silver vase her arm's had wound<BR>
That seemed, so fresh and fair and young<BR>
A wreath of flowers that o'er it hung.<BR>
In sweet disorder lay a throng<BR>
Weary of dance and play and song,<BR>
Where heedless girls had sunk to rest<BR>
One pillowed on anothers breast<BR>
Her tender cheek half seen beneath<BR>
Bed roses of the falling wreath,<BR>
The while her long soft hair concealed<BR>
The beauties that her friend revealed.<BR>
With limbs at random interlaced<BR>
Bound arm and leg and throat and waist,<BR>
Wreath of women lay asleep<BR>
Blossoms in a careless heap.<BR>
