<P>
That shout, which shook the land with fear,<BR>
In thunder smote on B&aacute;li's ear,<BR>
Where in the chamber barred and closed<BR>
The sovereign with his dame reposed.<BR>
Each amorous thought was rudely stilled,<BR>
And pride and rage his bosom filled.<BR>
His angry eyes flashed darkly red,<BR>
And all his native brightness fled,<BR>
As when, by swift eclipse assailed,<BR>
The glory of the sun has failed.<BR>
While in his fury uncontrolled<BR>
He ground his teeth, his eyeballs rolled,<BR>
He seemed a lake wherein no gem<BR>
Of blossom decks the lotus stem.<BR>
He heard, and with indignant pride<BR>
Forth from the bower the V&aacute;nar hied.<BR>
And the earth trembled at the beat<BR>
And fury of hit hastening feet.<BR>
But T&aacute;ra to her consort flew,<BR>
Her loving arms around him threw.<BR>
And trembling and bewildered, gave<BR>
Wise counsel that might heal and save:<BR>
'O dear my lord, this rage control<BR>
That like a torrent floods thy soul,<BR>
And cant these idle thoughts away<BR>
Like faded wreath of yesterday,<BR>
O tarry till the morning light,<BR>
Then, if thou wilt, go forth and fight.<BR>

<P>
Think not I doubt thy valour, no;<BR>
Or deem thee weaker than thy foe,<BR>
Yet for a while would have thee stay<BR>
Nor see thee tempt the fight to-day.<BR>
Now list, my loving lord, and learn<BR>
The reason why I bid thee turn.<BR>
Thy foeman came in wrath and pride,<BR>
And thee to deadly fight defied,<BR>
Thou wentest out: he fought, and fled<BR>
Sore wounded and discomfited.<BR>
But yet, untaught by late defeat,<BR>
He comes his conquering foe to meet.<BR>
And calls thee forth with cry and shout:<BR>
Hence spring, my lord, this fear and doubt.<BR>
A heart so bold that will not yield,<BR>
But yearns to tempt the desperate field,<BR>
Such loud defiance, fiercely pressed,<BR>
On no uncertain hope can rest.<BR>
So lately by thine arm o'erthrown,<BR>
He comes not back, I ween, alone.<BR>
Some mightier comrade guards his side,<BR>
And spurs him to this burst of pride.<BR>
For nature made the V&aacute;nar wise:<BR>
On arms of might his hope relies;<BR>
And never will Sugr&iacute;va seek<BR>
A friend whose power to save is weak.<BR>
Now listen while my lips unfold<BR>
The wondrous tale my Angad told.<BR>
Our child the distant forest sought,<BR>
Aud, learnt from spies, the tidings brought.<BR>
Two sons of Das'arathu, sprung<BR>
From old Ikshv&aacute;ku, brave and young,<BR>
Renowned in arms, in war untamed--<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman are they named--<BR>
Have with thy foe Sugr&iacute;va made<BR>
A league of love and friendly aid.<BR>
Now R&aacute;ma, famed for exploit high,<BR>
Is bound thy brother's firm ally,<BR>
Like fires of doom &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_580"></A><A HREF="#fn_580"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that ruin all<BR>
He makes each foe before him fall.<BR>
He is the suppliant's sure defence,<BR>
The tree that shelters innocence.<BR>
The poor and wretched seek his feet:<BR>
In him the noblest glories meet.<BR>
With skill and knowledge vast and deep<BR>
His sire's commands he loved to keep;<BR>
With princely gifts and graces stored<BR>
As metals deck the Mountains' Lord.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_581"></A><A HREF="#fn_581"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Thou canst not, O my hero, stand<BR>
Before the might of R&aacute;ma's hand;<BR>
For none may match his powers or dare<BR>
With him in deeds of war compare.<BR>
Hear, I entreat, the words I say,<BR>
Nor lightly turn my rede away.<BR>
O let fraternal discord cease,<BR>
And link you in the bonds of peace.<BR>
Let consecrating rites ordain<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Sugr&iacute;va partner of thy reign.<BR>
Let war and thoughts of conflict end,<BR>
And be thou his and R&aacute;ma's friend,<BR>
Each soft approach of love begin.<BR>
And to thy soul thy brother win;<BR>
for whether here or there he be,<BR>
Thy brother still, dear lord, is he.<BR>
Though far and wide these eyes I strain<BR>
A friend like him I seek in vain.<BR>
Let gentle words his heart incline,<BR>
And gifts and honours make him thine,<BR>
Till, foes no more, in love allied,<BR>
You stand as brothers side by side.<BR>
Thou in high rank wast wont to hold<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, formed in massive mould;<BR>
Then come, thy brother's love regain,<BR>
For other aids are weak and vain.<BR>
If thou would please my soul, and still<BR>
Preserve me from all fear and ill,<BR>
I pray thee by thy love be wise<BR>
And do the thing which I advise.<BR>
Assuage thy fruitless wrath, and shun<BR>
The mightier arms of Raghu's son;<BR>
For Indra's peer in might is he,<BR>
A foe too strong, my lord, for thee.'<BR>
