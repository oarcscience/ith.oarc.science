<P>
To him Mahes'var thus replied:<BR>
'O strong-armed hero, lotus-eyed,<BR>
Thou, best of those who love the right,<BR>
Hast nobly fought the wondrous fight.<BR>
Dispelled by thee the doom that spread<BR>
Through trembling earth and heaven is fled.<BR>
The worlds exult in light and bliss,<BR>
And praise thy name, O chief, for this.<BR>
Now peace to Bharat's heart restore,<BR>
And bid Kausaly&aacute; weep no more.<BR>
Thy face let Queen Kaikey&iacute; see,<BR>
Let fond Sumitr&aacute; gaze on thee.<BR>
The longing of thy friends relieve,<BR>
The kingdom of thy sires receive.<BR>
Let sons of gentle S&iacute;t&aacute; born<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's ancient line adorn.<BR>
Then from all care and foemen freed<BR>
Perform the offering of the steed.<BR>
In pious gifts thy wealth expend,<BR>
Then to the home of Gods ascend,<BR>
Thy sire, this glorious king, behold.<BR>
Among the blest in heaven enrolled.<BR>
He comes from where the Immortals dwell:<BR>
Salute him, for he loves thee well.'<BR>

<P>
His mandate Raghu's sons obeyed,<BR>
And to their sire obeisance mads,<BR>
Where high he stood above the car<BR>
In wondrous light that shone afar,<BR>
His limbs in radiant garments dressed<BR>
Whereon no spot of dust might rest.<BR>
When on the son he loved so well<BR>
The eyes of Das'aratha fell,<BR>
He strained the hero to his breast<BR>
And thus with gentle words addressed:<BR>
'No joy to me is heavenly bliss,<BR>
For there these eyes my R&aacute;ma miss.<BR>
Enrolled on high with saint and sage,<BR>
Thy woes, dear son, my thoughts engage.<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;'s guile I ne'er forget:<BR>
Her cruel words will haunt me yet,<BR>
Which sent thee forth, my son, to roam<BR>
The forest far from me and home.<BR>
Now when I look on each dear face,<BR>
And hold you both in fond embrace,<BR>
My heart is full of joy to see<BR>
The sons I love from danger free.<BR>
Now know I what the Gods designed,<BR>
And how in R&aacute;ma's form enshrined<BR>
The might of Purushottam lay,<BR>
The tyrant of the worlds to slay.<BR>
Ah, how Kausaly&aacute; will rejoice<BR>
To hear again her darling's voice,<BR>
And, all thy weary wanderings o'er,<BR>

<P>
To gaze upon thy face once more.<BR>
Ah blest, for ever blest are they<BR>
Whose eyes shall see the glorious day<BR>
Of thy return in joy at last,<BR>
Thy term of toil and exile past.<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;'s lord, begin thy reign,<BR>
And day by day new glory gain,'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: and R&aacute;ma thus replied:<BR>
'Be not this grace, O sire, denied.<BR>
Those hasty words, that curse revoke<BR>
Which from thy lips in anger broke:<BR>
'Kaikey&iacute;, be no longer mine:<BR>
I cast thee off, both thee and thine.'<BR>
O father, let no sorrow fall<BR>
On her or hers: thy curse recall.'<BR>
'Yea, she shall live, if so thou wilt,'<BR>
The sire replied, 'absolved from guilt.'<BR>
Round Lakshman then his arms he threw,<BR>
And moved by love began anew:<BR>
'Great store of merit shall be thine,<BR>
And brightly shall thy glory shine;<BR>
Secure on earth thy brother's grace.<BR>
And high in heaven shall be thy place.<BR>
Thy glorious king obey and fear:<BR>
To him the triple world is dear.<BR>
God, saint, and sage, by Indra led,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma bow the reverent head,<BR>
Nor from the Lord, the lofty-souled,<BR>
Their worship or their praise withhold.<BR>
Heart of the Gods, supreme is he,<BR>
The One who ne'er shall cease to be.'<BR>

<P>
On S&iacute;t&aacute; then he looked and smiled;<BR>
'List to my words' he said, 'dear child,<BR>
Let not thy gentle breast retain<BR>
One lingering trace of wrath or pain.<BR>
When by the fire thy truth be proved,<BR>
By love for thee his will was moved.<BR>
The furious flame thy faith confessed<BR>
Which shrank not from the awful test:<BR>
And thou, in every heart enshrined,<BR>
Shalt live the best of womankind.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: he bade the three adieu,<BR>
And home to heaven exulting flew.<BR>
