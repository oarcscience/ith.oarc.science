<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LX.: LAKSHMAN REPROVED.</H3>
<P>
But R&aacute;ma ceased not to upbraid.<BR>
His brother for untimely aid,<BR>
And thus, while anguish wrung his breast,<BR>
The chief with eager question pressed:<BR>
'Why, Lakshman, didst thou hurry hence<BR>
And leave my wife without defence?<BR>
I left her in the wood with thee.<BR>
And deemed her safe from jeopardy.<BR>
When first thy form appeared in view,<BR>
I marked that S&iacute;t&aacute; come not too.<BR>
With woe my troubled soul was rent,<BR>
Prophetic of the dire event.<BR>
Thy coming steps afar I spied,<BR>
I saw no S&iacute;t&aacute; by thy side.<BR>
And felt a sudden throbbing dart<BR>
Through my left eye, and arm, and heart.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lakshman, with Fortune's marks impressed,<BR>
His brother mournfully addressed:<BR>
'Not by my heart's free impulse led,<BR>
Leaving thy wife to thee I sped;<BR>
But by her keen reproaches sent,<BR>
O R&aacute;ma, to thine aid I went.<BR>
She heard afar a mournful cry,<BR>
'O save me, Lakshman, or I die.'<BR>
The voice that spoke in moving tone<BR>
Smote on her ear and seemed thine own.<BR>
Soon as those accents reached her ear<BR>
She yielded to her woe and fear,<BR>
She wept o'ercome by grief, and cried,<BR>
'Fly, Lakshman, fly to R&aacute;ma's side.'<BR>
Though many a time she bade me speed,<BR>
Her urgent prayer I would not heed.<BR>
I bade her in thy strength confide,<BR>
And thus with tender words replied:<BR>
'No giant roams the forest shade<BR>
From whom thy lord need shrink dismayed.<BR>
No human voice, believe me, spoke<BR>
Those words thy causeless fear that woke.<BR>
Can he whose might can save in woe<BR>
The heavenly Gods e'er stoop so low,<BR>
And with those piteous accents call<BR>
For succour like a caitiff thrall?<BR>
And why should wandering giants choose<BR>
The accents of thy lord to use,<BR>
In alien tones my help to crave,<BR>
And cry aloud. O Lakshman, save?<BR>
Now let my words thy spirit cheer.<BR>
Compose thy thoughts and banish fear.<BR>
In hell, in earth, or in the skies<BR>
There is not, and there cannot rise<BR>
A champion whose strong arm can slay<BR>
Thy R&aacute;ma in the battle fray.<BR>
To heavenly hosts he ne'er would yield<BR>
Though Indra led them to the field.<BR>
To soothe her thus I vainly sought:<BR>
Her heart with woe was still distraught.<BR>
While from her eyes the waters ran<BR>
Her bitter speech she thus began:<BR>
'Too well I see thy dark intent:<BR>
Thy lawless thoughts on me are bent.<BR>
Thou hopest, but thy hope is vain,<BR>
To win my love, thy brother slain.<BR>
Not love, but Bharat's dark decree<BR>
To share his exile counselled thee,<BR>

<P>
Or hearing now his bitter cry<BR>
Thou surely to his aid wouldst fly.<BR>
For love of me, a stealthy foe<BR>
Thou choosest by his side to go,<BR>
And now thou longest that my lord<BR>
Should die, and wilt no help afford.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Such were the words the lady said:<BR>
With angry fire my eyes were red.<BR>
With pale lips quivering in my rage<BR>
I hastened from the hermitage.'<BR>
He ceased; and frenzied by his pain<BR>
The son of Raghu spoke again:<BR>
'O brother, for thy fault I grieve,<BR>
The Maithil dame alone to leave.<BR>
Thou knowest that my arm is strong<BR>
To save me from the giant throng,<BR>
And yet couldst leave the cottage, spurred<BR>
To folly by her angry word.<BR>
For this thy deed I praise thee not,--<BR>
To leave her helpless in the cot,<BR>
And thus thy sacred charge forsake<BR>
For the wild words a woman spake.<BR>
Yea thou art all to blame herein,<BR>
And very grievous is thy sin.<BR>
That anger swayed thy faithless breast<BR>
And made thee false to my behest.<BR>
An arrow speeding from my bow<BR>
Has laid the treacherous giant low,<BR>
Who lured me eager for the chase<BR>
Far from my hermit dwelling-place.<BR>
The string with easy hand I drew,<BR>
The arrow as in pastime flew,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The wounded quarry bled.<BR>
The borrowed form was cast away,<BR>
Before mine eye a giant lay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With bright gold braceleted.<BR>
My arrow smote him in the chest:<BR>
The giant by the pain distressed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Raised his loud voice on high.<BR>
Far rang the mournful sound: mine own,<BR>
It seemed, were accent, voice, and tone,<BR>
They made thee leave my spouse alone<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And to my rescue fly,'<BR>
