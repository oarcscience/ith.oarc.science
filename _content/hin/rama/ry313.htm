Then R&aacute;ma, best of all who guide<BR>
Their steps by duty, thus replied:<BR>
'What marvel if Lord Indra send<BR>
The kindly rain, O faithful friend?<BR>
If, thousand-rayed, the God of Day<BR>
Drive every darksome cloud away?<BR>
Or, rising high, the Lord of Night<BR>
Flood the broad heaven with silver light?<BR>
What marvel, King, that one like thee<BR>
The glory of his friends.should be?<BR>
No marvel, O my lord, that thou<BR>
Hast shown thy noble nature now.<BR>
Thy heart, Sugriva, well I know:<BR>
Naught from thy lips but truth may flow,<BR>
With thee for friend and champion all<BR>
My foes beneath my arm will fall.<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas, when my queen he stole,<BR>
Brought sure destruction on his soul,<BR>
Like Anuhl&aacute;da &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_653"></A><A HREF="#fn_653"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> who beguiled<BR>
Queen Sach&iacute; called Puloma's child.<BR>
Yes, near, Sugriva, is the day<BR>
When I my demon foe shall slay,<BR>
As conquering Indra in his ire<BR>
Slew Queen Paulomi's haughty sire.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_654"></A><A HREF="#fn_654"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: thick clouds of dust rose high<BR>
To every quarter of the sky:<BR>
The very sun grew faint and pale<BR>
Behind the darkly-gathering veil.<BR>
The mighty clouds that hung o'erhead<BR>
From east to west thick darkness spread,<BR>
And earth to her foundations shook<BR>
With hill and forest, lake and brook.<BR>
Then hidden was the ground beneath<BR>
Fierce warriors armed with fearful teeth,<BR>
Hosts numberless, each lord in size<BR>
A match for him who rules the skies:<BR>
From many a sea and distant hill,<BR>
From rock and river, lake and rill.<BR>
Some like the morning sun were bright.<BR>
Some, like the moon, were silver white:<BR>
These green as lotus fibres, those<BR>
White-coated from their native snows.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_655"></A><A HREF="#fn_655"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Then S'atabali came in view<BR>
Girt by a countless retinue.<BR>
Like some gold mountain high in air<BR>
T&aacute;r&aacute;'s illustrious sire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_656"></A><A HREF="#fn_656"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> was there.<BR>
There Rum&aacute;'s father,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_657"></A><A HREF="#fn_657"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> far-renowned,<BR>
With tens of thousands ranged around.<BR>
There, tinted like the tender green<BR>
Of lotus filaments, was seen,<BR>
Compassed by countless legions, one<BR>
Whose face was as the morning sun,<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n's father good and great,<BR>
Kesar&iacute;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_658"></A><A HREF="#fn_658"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> wisest in debate.<BR>
There the proud king Gav&aacute;ksha, feared<BR>
For his strong warrior arm, appeared.<BR>
There Dh&uacute;mra, mighty lord, the dread<BR>
Of foes, his ursine legions led.<BR>
There Panas, first for warlike fame,<BR>
With twenty million warriors came.<BR>
There glorious N&iacute;la, dark of hue,<BR>
Arrayed his countless troops in view.<BR>
There moved lord Gavaya brave and bold,<BR>
Resplendent like a hill of gold,<BR>
And near him Dar&iacute;mukha stood<BR>
With millions from the hill and wood<BR>
And *Dwivid famed for strength and speed,<BR>
And Mamda, both of Asvin seed.<BR>
There Gaja, strong and glorious, led<BR>
The countless troops around him spread,<BR>
And J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_659"></A><A HREF="#fn_659"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> the king whose sway<BR>
The bears delighted to obey,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
With swarming myriads onward pressed<BR>
True to his lord Sugr&iacute;va's hest;<BR>
And princely Ruman, dear to fame,<BR>
Led millions whom no hosts could tame,<BR>
All these and many a chief beside&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_660"></A><A HREF="ry314.htm#fn_660"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Came onward fierce in warlike pride.<BR>
They covered all the plain, and still<BR>
Pressed forward over wood and hill.<BR>
In rows for many a league around<BR>
They rested on the grassy ground;<BR>
Or to Sugr&iacute;va made their way.<BR>
Like clouds about the Lord of Day,<BR>
And to the king their proud heads bent<BR>
In power and might preeminent.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va then to R&aacute;ma sped.<BR>
And raised his reverent hands, and said<BR>
That every chief from coast to coast<BR>
Was present with his warrior host.<BR>
