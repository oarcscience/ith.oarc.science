<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXVII.: KUMBHAKARNA'S DEATH.</H3>
<P>
Thus from their flight the V&aacute;nars turned,<BR>
And every heart for battle burned,<BR>
Determined on the spot to die<BR>
Or gain a warrior's meed on high.<BR>
Again the V&aacute;nars stooped to seize<BR>
Their weapons, rocks and fallen trees;<BR>
Again the deadly fight began,<BR>
And fiercely at the giant ran.<BR>
Unmoved the monster kept his place:<BR>
He raised on high his awful mace,<BR>
Whirled the huge weapon round his head<BR>
And laid the foremost V&aacute;nars'dead.<BR>
Eight thousand fell bedewed with gore,<BR>
Then sank and died seven hundred more.<BR>
Then thirty, twenty, ten, or eight<BR>
At each fierce onset met their fate,<BR>
And fast the fallen were devoured<BR>
Like snakes by Garud's beak o'erpowered.<BR>
Then Dwivid from the V&aacute;nar van.<BR>
Armed with an uptorn mountain, ran,<BR>
Like a huge cloud when fierce winds blow,<BR>
And charged amain the mountain foe.<BR>
With wondrous force the hill he threw:<BR>
O'er Kumbhakarna's head it flew,<BR>
And falling on his host afar<BR>
Crushed many a giant, steed, and car.<BR>
Rocks, trees, by fierce Han&uacute;m&aacute;n sped,<BR>
Rained fast on Kumbhakrna's head.<BR>
Whose spear each deadlier missile stopped,<BR>
And harmless on the plain it dropped.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_478"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 478</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Then with his furious eyes aglow<BR>
The giant rushed upon the foe,<BR>
Where, with a woody hill upheaved,<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n's might his charge received.<BR>
Through his vast frame the giant felt<BR>
The angry blow Han&uacute;m&aacute;n dealt.<BR>
He reeled a moment, sure distressed,<BR>
Then smote the V&aacute;nar on the breast,<BR>
As when the War-God's furious stroke<BR>
Through Krauncha's hill a passage broke. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_994"></A><A HREF="#fn_994"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Fierce was the blow, and deep and wide<BR>
The rent: with crimson torrents dyed,<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n, maddened by the pain,<BR>
Roared like a cloud that brings the rain,<BR>
And from each R&aacute;kshas throat rang out<BR>
Loud clamour and exultant shout.<BR>
Then Nila hurled with mustered might<BR>
The fragment of a mountain height;<BR>
Nor would the rock the foe have missed,<BR>
But Kumbhakarna raised his fist<BR>
And smote so fiercely that the mass<BR>
Fell crushed to powder on the grass.<BR>
Five chieftains of the V&aacute;nar race &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_995"></A><A HREF="#fn_995"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Charged Kumbhakarna face to face,<BR>
And his huge frame they wildly beat<BR>
With rocks and trees and hands and feet.<BR>
Round Rishabh first the giant wound<BR>
His arms and hurled him to the ground,<BR>
Where speechless, senseless, wounded sore,<BR>
He lay his face besmeared with gore.<BR>
Then N&iacute;la with his fist he slew,<BR>
And S'arabh with his knee o'erthrew,<BR>
Nor could Gav&aacute;ksha's strength withstand<BR>
The force of his terrific hand.<BR>
At Gandham&aacute;dan's eager call<BR>
Rushed thousands to avenge their fall,<BR>
Nor ceased those V&aacute;nars to assail<BR>
With knee and fist and tooth and nail.<BR>
Around his foes the giant threw<BR>
His mighty arms, and nearer drew<BR>
The captives subject to his will:<BR>
Then snatched them up and ate his fill.<BR>
There was no respite then, no pause:<BR>
Fast gaped and closed his hell-like jaws:<BR>
Yet, prisoned in that gloomy cave,<BR>
Some V&aacute;nars still their lives could save:<BR>
Some through his nostrils found a way,<BR>
Some through his ears resought the day.<BR>
Like Indra with his thunder, like<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
The God of Death in act to strike,<BR>
The giant seized his ponderous spear,<BR>
And charged the foe in swift career.<BR>
Before his might the V&aacute;nars fell,<BR>
Nor could their hosts his charge repel.<BR>
Then trembling, nor ashamed to run,<BR>
They turned and fled to Raghu's son.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When B&aacute;li's warrior son &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_996"></A><A HREF="#fn_996"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> beheld<BR>
Their flight, his heart with fury swelled.<BR>
He rushed, with his terrific shout,<BR>
To meet the foe and stay the rout.<BR>
He came, he hurled a mountain peak,<BR>
And smote the giant on the cheek.<BR>
His ponderous spear the giant threw:<BR>
Fierce was the cast, the aim was true;<BR>
But Angad, trained in war and tried,<BR>
Saw ere it came, and leapt aside.<BR>
Then with his open hand he smote<BR>
The giant on the chest and throat.<BR>
That blow the giant scarce sustained;<BR>
But sense and strength were soon regained.<BR>
With force which nothing might resist<BR>
He caught the V&aacute;nar by the wrist,<BR>
Whirled him, as if in pastime, round,<BR>
And dashed him senseless on the ground.<BR>
There low on earth his foe lay crushed:<BR>
At King Sugr&iacute;va next he rushed,<BR>
Who, waiting for the charge, stood still,<BR>
And heaved on high a shattered hill,<BR>
He looked on Kumbhakarna dyed<BR>
With streams of blood, and fiercely cried:<BR>
'Great glory has thine arm achieved,<BR>
And thousands of their lives bereaved.<BR>
Now leave a while thy meaner foes,<BR>
And brook the hill Sugr&iacute;va throws.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke, and hurled the mass he held:<BR>
The giant's chest the stroke repelled,<BR>
Then on the V&aacute;nars fell despair,<BR>
And R&aacute;kshas clamour filled the air.<BR>
The giant raised his arm, and fast<BR>
Came the tremendous &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_997"></A><A HREF="#fn_997"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> spear he cast.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n caught it as it flew,<BR>
And knapped it on his knee in two.<BR>
The giant saw the broken spear:<BR>
His clouded eye confessed his fear;<BR>
Yet at Sugr&iacute;va's head he sent<BR>
A peak from Lank&aacute;'s mountain rent.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_479"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 479</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The rushing mass no might could stay:<BR>
Sugriva fell and senseless lay.<BR>
The giant stooped his foe to seize,<BR>
And bore him thence, as bears the breeze<BR>
A cloud in autumn through the sky.<BR>
He heard the sad Immortals sigh,<BR>
And shouts of triumph long and loud<BR>
Went up from all the R&aacute;kshas crowd.<BR>
Through Lanka's gate the giant passed<BR>
Holding his struggling captive fast,<BR>
While from each terrace, house, and tower<BR>
Fell on his haughty head a shower<BR>
Of fragrant scent and flowery rain,<BR>
Blossoms and leaves and scattered grain. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_998"></A><A HREF="#fn_998"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By slow degrees the V&aacute;nars' lord<BR>
Felt life and sense and strength restored.<BR>
He heard the giants' joyful boast:<BR>
He thought upon his V&aacute;nar host.<BR>
His teeth and feet he fiercely plied.<BR>
And bit and rent the giant's side,<BR>
Who, mad with pain and smeared with gore,<BR>
Hurled to the ground the load he bore.<BR>
Regardless of a storm of blows<BR>
Swift to the sky the V&aacute;nar rose,<BR>
Then lightly like a flying ball<BR>
High overleapt the city wall,<BR>
And joyous for deliverance won<BR>
Regained the side of Raghu s son.<BR>
And Kumbhakarna, mad with hate<BR>
And fury, sallied from the gate,<BR>
The carnage of the foe renewed<BR>
And filled his maw with gory food.<BR>
Slaying, with headlong frenzy blind,<BR>
Both V&aacute;nar foes and giant kind.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nor would Sumitra's valiant son &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_999"></A><A HREF="#fn_999"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The might of Kumbhakarna shun,<BR>
Who through his harness felt the sting<BR>
Of keen shafts loosened from the string.<BR>
His heart confessed the warrior's power,<BR>
And, bleeding from the ceaseless shower<BR>
That smote him on the chest and side,<BR>
With words like these the giant cried:<BR>
'Well fought, well fought, Sumitra's son;<BR>
Eternal glory hast thou won,<BR>
For thou in desperate fight hast met<BR>
The victor never conquered yet,<BR>
Whom, borne on huge Air&aacute;vat's back,<BR>
E'en Indra trembles to attack,<BR>
Go, son of Queen Sumitr&aacute;, go:<BR>
Thy valour and thy strength I know.<BR>
Now all my hope and earnest will<BR>
Is R&aacute;ma in the fight to kill.<BR>
Let him beneath my weapons fall,<BR>
And I will meet and conquer all.'<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
The chieftain, of Sumitr&aacute; born,<BR>
Made answer as he laughed in scorn:<BR>
'Yea, thou hast won a victor's fame<BR>
From trembling Gods and Indra's shame.<BR>
There waits thee now a mightier foe<BR>
Whose prowess thou hast yet to know.<BR>
There, famous in a hundred lands,<BR>
R&aacute;ma the son of Raghu stands.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Straight at the king the giant sped,<BR>
And earth was shaken at his tread.<BR>
His bow the hero grasped and strained,<BR>
And deadly shafts in torrents rained.<BR>
As Kumbhakarna felt each stroke<BR>
From his huge mouth burst fire and smoke;<BR>
His hands were loosed in mortal pain<BR>
And dropped his weapons on the plain.<BR>
Though reft of spear and sword and mace<BR>
No terror changed his haughty face.<BR>
With heavy hands he rained his blows<BR>
And smote to death a thousand foes.<BR>
Where'er the furious monster strode<BR>
While down his limbs the red blood flowed<BR>
Like torrents down a mountain's side,<BR>
V&aacute;nars and bears and giants died.<BR>
High o'er his head a rock he swung,<BR>
And the huge mass at R&aacute;ma flung.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma's arrows bright as flame<BR>
Shattered the mountain as it came.<BR>
Then Raghu's son, his eyes aglow<BR>
With burning anger, charged the foe,<BR>
And as his bow he strained and tried<BR>
With fearful clang the cord replied.<BR>
Wroth at the bowstring's threatening clang<BR>
To meet his foe the giant sprang.<BR>
High towering with enormous frame<BR>
Huge as a wood-crowned hill he came.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma firm and self-possessed<BR>
In words like these the foe addressed:<BR>
'Draw near, O R&aacute;kshas lord, draw near,<BR>
Nor turn thee from the fight in fear.<BR>
Thou meetest R&aacute;ma face to faoe,<BR>
Destroyer of the giant race.<BR>
Come, fight, and thou shalt feel this hour.<BR>
Laid low in death, thy conqueror's power.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: and mad with wrath and pride<BR>
The giant champion thus replied:<BR>
'Come thou to me and thou shalt find<BR>
A foeman of a different kind.<BR>
No Khara, no Vir&aacute;dha,--thou<BR>
Hast met a mightier warrior now.<BR>
The strength of Kumbhakarna fear,<BR>
And dread the iron mace I rear<BR>
This mace in days of yore subdued<BR>
The Gods and D&aacute;nav multitude.<BR>
Prove, lion of Ikshv&aacute;ku's line.<BR>
Thy power upon these limbs of mine.<BR>
Then, after trial, shalt thou bleed,<BR>
And with thy flesh my hunger feed.'<BR>
&nbsp; He ceased and R&aacute;ma, undismayed,<BR>
Upon his cord those arrows laid<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_480"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 480</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Which pierced the stately S&aacute;l trees through,<BR>
And B&aacute;li king of V&aacute;nars slew.<BR>
They flew, they smote, but smote in vain<BR>
Those mighty limbs that felt no pain.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma sent with surest aim<BR>
The dart that bore the Wind-God's name.<BR>
The missile from the giant tore<BR>
His huge arm and the mace it bore,<BR>
Which crushed the V&aacute;nars where it fell:<BR>
And dire was Kumbhakarna's yell.<BR>
The giant seized a tree, and then<BR>
Rushed madly at the lord of men.<BR>
Another dart, Lord Indra's own,<BR>
To meet his furious onset thrown,<BR>
His left arm from the shoulder lopped,<BR>
And like a mountain peak it dropped.<BR>
Then from the bow of R&aacute;ma sped<BR>
Two arrows, each with crescent head;<BR>
And, winged with might which naught could stay,<BR>
They cut the giant's legs away.<BR>
They fell, and awful was the sound<BR>
As those vast columns shook the ground;<BR>
And sky and sea and hill and cave<BR>
In echoing roars their answer gave.<BR>
Then from his side the hero drew<BR>
A dart that like the tempest flew--<BR>
No deadlier shaft has ever flown<BR>
Than that which Indra called his own--<BR>
Nor could the giant's mail-armed neck<BR>
The fury of the missile check.<BR>
Through skin and flesh and bone it smote<BR>
And rent asunder head and throat.<BR>
Down with the sound of thunder rolled<BR>
The head adorned with rings of gold,<BR>
And crushed to pieces in its fall<BR>
A gate, a tower, a massive wall.<BR>
Hurled to the sea the body fell:<BR>
Terrific was the ocean's swell,<BR>
Nor could swift fin and nimble leap<BR>
Save the crushed creatures of the deep.<BR>

<P>
Thus he who plagued in impious pride<BR>
The Gods and Br&aacute;hmans fought and died.<BR>
Glad were the hosts of heaven, and long<BR>
The air re-echoed with their song. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1000"></A><A HREF="#fn_1000"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
