<P>
His pitying eyes with tears bedewed,<BR>
The weeping queen again he viewed,<BR>
And saw around the prisoner stand<BR>
Her demon guard, a fearful band.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_828"></A><A HREF="#fn_828"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Some earless, some with ears that hung<BR>
Low as their feet and loosely swung:<BR>
Some fierce with single ears and eyes,<BR>
Some dwarfish, some of monstrous size:<BR>
Some with their dark necks long and thin<BR>
With hair upon the knotty skin:<BR>
Some with wild locks, some bald and bare,<BR>
Some covered o'er with bristly hair:<BR>
Some tall and straight, some bowed and bent<BR>
With every foul disfigurement:<BR>
All black and fierce with eyes of fire.<BR>
Ruthless and stern and swift to ire:<BR>
Some with the jackal's jaw and nose.<BR>
Some faced like boars and buffaloes:<BR>
Some with the heads of goats and kine,<BR>
Of elephants, and dogs, and swine:<BR>
With lions' lips and horses' brows,<BR>
They walked with feet of mules and cows:<BR>
Swords, maces, clubs, and spears they bore<BR>
In hideous hands that reeked with gore,<BR>
And, never sated, turned afresh<BR>
To bowls of wine and piles of flesh.<BR>
Such were the awful guards who stood<BR>
Round S&iacute;t&aacute; in that lovely wood,<BR>
While in her lonely sorrow she<BR>
Wept sadly neath a spreading tree.<BR>
He watched the spouse of R&aacute;ma there<BR>
Regardless of her tangled hair,<BR>
Her jewels stripped from neck and limb,<BR>
Decked only with her love of him.<BR>

the band of monster at the gate
of the city of Alcina:

"Non fu veduta mai pi&uacute; strana torma,<BR>
Pi&uacute; monstruosi volti e peggio fatti;<BR>
Alcun' dal collo in gi&uacute; d'uomini han forma,<BR>
Col viso altri di simie, altri di gatti;<BR>
Stampano alcun con pi&eacute; caprigni l'orma,<BR>
Alcuni son centauri agili ed atti."<BR>
