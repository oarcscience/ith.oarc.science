### CANTO XL.: THE CLEAVING OF THE EARTH.

The hermit ceased: the tale was done:  
Then in a transport Raghu's son  

Again addressed the ancient sire  
Resplendent as a burning fire:  
'O holy man, I fain would hear  
The tale repeated full and clear  
How he from whom my sires descend  
Brought the great rite to happy end.'  
The hermit answered with a smile:  
'Then listen, son of Raghu, while  
My legendary tale proceeds  
To tell of high-souled Sagar's deeds.  
Within the spacious plain that lies  
From where Himálaya's heights arise  
To where proud Vindhya's rival chain  
Looks down upon the subject plain--  
A land the best for rites declared-- <span
id="fr_183"></span>[1b](#fn_183)  
His sacrifice the king prepared.  
And Ans'umán the prince--for so  
Sagar advised--with ready bow  
Was borne upon a mighty car  
To watch the steed who roamed afar.  
But Indra, monarch of the skies,  
Veiling his form in demon guise,  
Came down upon the appointed day  
And drove the victim horde away.  
Reft of the steed the priests, distressed,  
The master of the rite addressed;  
'Upon the sacred day by force  
A robber takes the victim horse.  
Haste, King! now let the thief be slain;  
Bring thou the charger back again:  
The sacred rite prevented thus  
Brings scathe and woe to all of us.  
Rise, monarch, and provide with speed.  
That naught its happy course impede.'  
   King Sagar in his crowded court  
Gave ear unto the priests' report.  
He summoned straightway to his side  
His sixty thousand sons, and cried:  
'Brave sons of mine, I knew not how  
These demons are so mighty now:  
The priests began the rite so well  
All sanctified with prayer and spell.  
If in the depths of earth he hide,  
Or lurk beneath the ocean's tide,  

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>  

Pursue, dear sons, the robber's track;  
Slay him and bring the charger back.  
The whole of this broad earth explore,  
Sea-garlanded, from shore to shore:  
Yea, dig her up with might and main  
Until you see the horse again.  
Deep let your searching labour reach,  
A league in depth dug out by each.  
The robber of our horse pursue,  
And please your sire who orders you.  
My grandson, I, this priestly train,  
Till the steed comes, will here remain.'  
   Their eager hearts with transport burned  
As to their task the heroes turned.  
Obedient to their father, they  
Through earth's recesses forced their way.  
With iron arms' unflinching toil  
Each dug a league beneath the soil.  
Earth, cleft asunder, groaned in pain,  
As emulous they plied amain  
Sharp-pointed coulter, pick, and bar,  
Hard as the bolts of Indra are.  
Then loud the horrid clamour rose  
Of monsters dying 'neath their blows,  
Giant and demon, fiend and snake,  
That in earth's core their dwelling make.  
They dug, in ire that naught could stay,  
Through sixty thousand leagues their way,  
Cleaving the earth with matchless strength  
Till hell itself they reached at length.  
Thus digging searched they Jambudvip  <span
id="fr_184"></span>[1](ry041.htm#fn_184)  
With all its hills and mountains steep.  
Then a great fear began to shake  
The heart of God, bard, fiend, and snake,  
And all distressed in spirit went  
Before the Sire Omnipotent.  
With signs of woe in every face  
They sought the mighty Father's grace,  
And trembling still and ill at ease  
Addressed their Lord in words like these:  
'The sons of Sagar, Sire benign,  
Pierce the whole earth with mine on mine,  
And as their ruthless work they ply  
Innumerable creatures die,  
'This is the thief,' the princes say,  
'Who stole our victim steed away.  
This marred the rite, and caused us ill.  
And so their guiltless blood they spill.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_181"></span>[50:1](ry039.htm#fr_181) Garuda.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[50:2](ry039.htm#fr_182) Ikshváku, the name of
a king of Ayodhyá who is regarded as the founder of the Solar race,
means also a *gourd*. Hence, perhaps, the myth.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[50:1b](ry040.htm#fr_183) The region here
spoken of is called in the Laws of Manu *Madhyades'a* or the middle
region. 'The region situated between the Himálaya and the Vindhya
Mountains ... is called *Madhyades'a*, or the middle region; the space
comprised between these two mountains from the eastern to the western
sea is called by sages Áryávartta, *the seat of honourable men*.' (MANU,
II, 21, 22.) The Sanskrit Indians called themselves Áryans, which means
*honourable, noble*, to distinguish themselves from the surrounding
nations of different origin.' GORRESIO.
