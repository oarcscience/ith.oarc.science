"Once in my strength and vigour's pride<BR>
I roamed this earth from side to side,<BR>
And towering like a mountain's crest,<BR>
A thousand N&aacute;gas'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> might possessed.<BR>
Like some vast sable cloud I showed:<BR>
My golden armlets flashed and glowed.<BR>
A crown I wore, an axe I swayed,<BR>
And all I met were sore afraid.<BR>
I roved where Dandak wood is spread;<BR>
On flesh of slaughtered saints I fed.<BR>
Then Vis'v&aacute;mitra, sage revered.<BR>
Holy of heart, my fury feared.<BR>
To Das'aratha's court he sped<BR>
And went before the king and said:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
'With me, my lord, thy R&aacute;ma send<BR>
On holy days his aid to lend.<BR>
M&aacute;r&iacute;cha fills my soul with dread<BR>
And keeps me sore disquieted.'<BR>

<P>
The monarch heard the saint's request<BR>
And thus the glorious sage addressed:<BR>

<P>
'My boy as yet in arms untrained<BR>
The age of twelve has scarce attained.<BR>
But I myself a host will lead<BR>
To guard thee in the hour of need.<BR>
My host with fourfold troops complete,<BR>
The rover of the night shall meet,<BR>
And I, O best of saints, will kill<BR>
Thy foeman and thy prayer fulfil.'<BR>
The king vouchsafed his willing aid:<BR>
The saint again this answer made:<BR>

<P>
'By R&aacute;ma's might, and his alone,<BR>
Can this great fiend be overthrown.<BR>
I know in days of yore the Blest<BR>
Thy saving help in fight confessed.<BR>
Still of thy famous deeds they tell<BR>
In heaven above, in earth, and hell,<BR>
A mighty host obeys thy hest:<BR>
Here let it still, I pray thee, rest.<BR>
Thy glorious son, though yet a boy,<BR>
Will in the fight that fiend destroy.<BR>
R&aacute;ma alone with me shall go:<BR>
Be happv, victor of the foe.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke: the monarch gave assent,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to the hermit lent.<BR>
So to his woodland home in joy<BR>
Went Vis'v&aacute;mitra with the boy.<BR>
With ready bow the champion stood<BR>
To guard the rites in Dandak wood.<BR>
With glorious eyes, most bright to view,<BR>
Beardless as yet and dark of hue;<BR>
A single robe his only wear,<BR>
His temples veiled with waving hair,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Around his neck a chain of gold,<BR>
He grasped the bow he loved to bold;<BR>
And the young hero's presence made<BR>
A glory in the forest shade.<BR>
Thus R&aacute;ma with his beauteous mien,<BR>
Like the young rising moon was seen,<BR>
I, like a cloud which tempest brings,<BR>
My arms adorned with golden rings,<BR>
Proud of the boon which lent me might,<BR>
Approached where dwelt the anchorite.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma saw me venturing nigh,<BR>
Raising my murderous axe on high;<BR>
He saw, and fearless of the foe,<BR>
Strung with calm hand his trusty bow<BR>
By pride of conscious strength beguiled,<BR>
I scorned him as a feeble child,<BR>
And rushed with an impetuous bound<BR>
On Vis'v&aacute;mitra's holy ground.<BR>
A keen swift shaft he pointed well,<BR>
The foeman's rage to check and quell,<BR>
And hurled a hundred leagues away<BR>
Deep in the ocean waves I lay.<BR>
He would not kill, but, nobly brave,<BR>
My forfeit life he chose to save.<BR>
So there I lay with wandering sense<BR>
Dazed by that arrow's violence.<BR>
Long in the sea I lay: at length<BR>
Slowly returned my sense and strength,<BR>
And rising from my watery bed<BR>
To Lank&aacute;'s town again I sped.<BR>
Thus was I spared, but all my band<BR>
Fell slain by R&aacute;ma's conquering hand,--<BR>
A boy, untrained in warrior skill,<BR>
Of iron arm and dauntless will.<BR>
If thou with R&aacute;ma still, in spite<BR>
Of warning and of prayer, wilt fight,<BR>
I see terrific woes impend,<BR>
And dire defeat thy days will end.<BR>
Thy giants all will feel the blow<BR>
And share the fatal overthrow,<BR>
Who love the taste of joy and play,<BR>
The banquet and the festal day.<BR>
Thine eyes will see destruction take<BR>
Thy Lank&aacute;, lost for Sit&aacute;'s sake,<BR>
And stately pile and palace fall<BR>
With terrace, dome, and jewelled wall.<BR>
The good will die: the crime of kings<BR>
Destruction on the people brings:<BR>
The sinless die, as in the lake<BR>
The fish must perish with the snake.<BR>
The prostrate giants thou wilt see<BR>
Slain for this folly wrought by thee,<BR>
Their bodies bright with precious scent<BR>
And sheen of heavenly ornament;<BR>
Or so the remnant of thy train<BR>
Seek refuge far, when help is vain<BR>
And with their wives, or widowed, fly<BR>
To every quarter of the sky;<BR>
Thy mournful eyes, where'er they turn,<BR>
Will see thy stately city burn,<BR>
When royal homes with fire are red,<BR>

<P>
And arrowy nets around are spread.<BR>
A sin that tops all sins in shame<BR>
Is outrage to another's dame,<BR>
A thousand wives thy palace fill,<BR>
And countless beauties wait thy will.<BR>
O rest contented with thine own,<BR>
Nor let thy race be overthrown.<BR>
If thou, O King, hast still delight<BR>
In rank and wealth and power and might,<BR>
In noble wives, in troops of friends,<BR>
In all that royal state attends,<BR>
I warn thee, cast not all away,<BR>
Nor challenge R&aacute;ma to the fray.<BR>
If deaf to every friendly prayer,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thou still wilt seek the strife,<BR>
And from the side of R&aacute;ma tear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His lovely Maithil wife,<BR>
Soon will thy life and empire end<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Destroyed by R&aacute;ma's bow,<BR>
And thou, with kith and kin and friend,<BR>
To Yama'a realm must go.'<BR>
