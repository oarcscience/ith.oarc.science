S&aacute;rd&uacute;la, R&aacute;van's spy, surveyed<BR>
The legions on the strand arrayed.<BR>
And bore, his bosom racked with fear,<BR>
These tidings to the monarch's ear:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'They come, they come. A rushing tide,<BR>
Ten leagues they spread from side to side,<BR>
And on to storm thy citv press,<BR>
Fierce rovers of the wilderness.<BR>
Rich in each princely power and grace,<BR>
The pride of Das'aratha's race,<BR>
R&aacute;ma and Lakshman lead their bands,<BR>
And halt them on the ocean sands.<BR>
O Monarch, rise, this peril meet;<BR>
Risk not the danger of defeat.<BR>

<P>
First let each wiser art be tried;<BR>
Bribe them, or win them, or divide.'<BR>
Such was the counsel of the spy:<BR>
And R&aacute;van called to S'uka: 'Fly,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va lord of V&aacute;nars seek,<BR>
And thus my kingly message speak:<BR>
'Great power and might and fame are thine.<BR>
Brave scion of a royal line,<BR>
King Riksharajuas' son, in thee<BR>
A brother and a friend I see.<BR>
How wrouged by me canst thou complain?<BR>
What profit here pretend to gain?<BR>
If from the wood the wife I stole<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma of the prudent soul,<BR>
What cause hast thou to mourn the theft?<BR>
Thou art not injured or bereft.<BR>
Return, O King, thy steps retrace<BR>
And seek thy mountain dwelling-place.<BR>
No, never may thy hosts within<BR>
My Lank&aacute;'s walls a footing win.<BR>
A mighty town whose strength defies<BR>
The gathered armies of the skies.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: obedient S'uka heard;<BR>
With wings and plumage of a bird<BR>
He rose in eager speed and through<BR>
The air upon his errand flew.<BR>
Borne o'er the sea with rapid wing<BR>
He stood above the V&aacute;nar king,<BR>
And spoke aloud, sublime in air.<BR>
Thu message he was charged so bear.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar heard the words he spoke,<BR>
And quick redoubling stroke on stroke<BR>
On head and pinions hemmed him round<BR>
And bore him struggling to the grouud.<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas wounded and distressed<BR>
These words to Raghu's son addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Quick, quick! This V&aacute;nar host * restrain,<BR>
For heralds never must be slain.<BR>
To him alone, a wretch untrue,<BR>
The punishment of death is due<BR>
Who leaves his master's speech unsaid<BR>
And speaks another word * instead'<BR>
Moved by the suppliant speech and praver<BR>
Up sprang the prince and cried, forbear.<BR>
Saved from his wild assailant's blows<BR>
Again the R&aacute;kshas herald rose<BR>
And borne on light wings to the sky<BR>
Addressed Sugr&iacute;va from on high:<BR>
'O V&aacute;nar Monarch, chief endued<BR>
With power and wonderous fortitude.<BR>
What answer is my king the fear<BR>
And scourge of weeping worlds, to hear?'<BR>
'Go tell thy lord,' Sugr&iacute;va cried.<BR>
'Thou, R&aacute;ma's foe, art thus defied.<BR>
His arm the guilty Bali slew;<BR>
Thus, tyrant, shalt thee perish too,<BR>
Thy sons, thy friends, proud King and all<BR>
Thy kith and kin with thee shall fall;<BR>
And emptied of the giant's brood,<BR>
Burnt * Lank&aacute; be a solitude.<BR>

<P>
Fly to the Sun-God's pathway, go<BR>
And hide thee deep in hell below:<BR>
In vain from R&aacute;ma shalt thou flee<BR>
Though heavenly warriors fight for thee.<BR>
Thine arm subdued, securely bold,<BR>
The Vulture-king infirm and old:<BR>
But will thy puny strength avail<BR>
When Raghu's wrathful sons assail?<BR>
A captive in thy palace lies<BR>
The lady of the lotus eyes:<BR>
Thou knowest not how fierce and strong<BR>
Is he whom thou hast dared to wrong.<BR>
The best of Raghu's lineage, he<BR>
Whose conquering hand shall punish thee.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: and Augad raised a cry;<BR>
'This is no herald but a spy.<BR>
Above thee from his airy post<BR>
His rapid eye surveyed our host,<BR>
Where with advantage he might scan<BR>
Our gathered strength from rear to van,<BR>
Bind him. V&aacute;nars, bind the spy,<BR>
Nor let him back to Lank&aacute; fly.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They hurled the R&aacute;kshas to the ground,<BR>
Thiey grasped his neck, his pinions bound,<BR>
And firmly held bear while * in vain<BR>
His voice was lifted to complain.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma's heart inclined to spare,<BR>
He listened to his plaint and prayer,<BR>
And cried aloud: 'O V&aacute;nars, cease;<BR>
The captive from his bonds release.'<BR>
