<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLIX.: THE CROSSING OF THE RIVERS.</H3>
<P>
Now R&aacute;ma, ere the night was fled,<BR>
O'er many a league of road had sped,<BR>
Till, as his course he onward held,<BR>
The morn the shades of night dispelled.<BR>
The rites of holy dawn he paid,<BR>
And all the country round surveyed.<BR>
He saw, as still he hurried through<BR>
Wth steeds which swift as arrows flew,<BR>
Hamlets and groves with blossoms fair,<BR>
And fields which showed the tillers' care,<BR>
While from the clusteied dwellings near<BR>
The words of peasants reached his ear:<BR>
'Fie on our lord the king, whose soul<BR>
Is yielded up to love's control!<BR>
Fie on the vile Kaikevi! Shame<BR>
On that malicious sinful dame,<BR>
Who, keenly bent on cruel deeds,<BR>
No hounds of righht and virtue heeds,<BR>
But with her wicked art has sent<BR>
So good a prince to banishment,<BR>
Wi-o, tender-hearted, ruling well<BR>
His senses in the woods to dwell.<BR>
Ah cruel king! his heart of steel<BR>
For his own son no love could feel,<BR>

<P>
Who with the sinless R&aacute;ma parts,<BR>
The darling of the people's hearts.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  These words he heard the peasants say,<BR>
Who dwelt in hamlets by the way,<BR>
And, lord of all the realm by right,<BR>
Through Kosala pursued his flight.<BR>
Through the auspicious flood, at last,<BR>
Of Vesasruti's stream he passed,<BR>
Aud onward to the place he sped<BR>
By Saint Agastya tenanted.<BR>
Still on for many an hour he hied,<BR>
And crossed the stream whose fooling tide<BR>
Rolls onward till she meets the sea,<BR>
The herd-frequented Gomatil<BR>
Borne by his rapid horses o'er,<BR>
He reached that river's further shore.<BR>
And Syandik&aacute;'s,whose svan-loved stream,<BR>
Resounded with the peacock's scream.<BR>
Then as he journeyed on his road<BR>
To hvs Videhan bride he showed<BR>
The populous land which Manu old<BR>
To King IKshvaku gave to hold.<BR>
The glorious prince, the lord of men<BR>
Looked on the charioteer, and then<BR>
Voiced like a wild swan, loud and clear.<BR>
He spake these words and bade him hear:<BR>
'When shall I, with returning feet<BR>
My father and my mother meet?<BR>
When shall I lead the hunt once more<BR>
In bloomy woods on Sarju's shore?<BR>
Most eagerly I long to ride<BR>
Urging the chase on Sarju's side.<BR>
For royal saints have seen no blame<BR>
In this, the monarch's matchless game.'<BR>

<P>
Thus speeding on,--no reft or stay,--<BR>
Ikshvaku's son pursued his way.<BR>
Oft his sweet voice the silence broke,<BR>
And thus on varied themes he spoke.<BR>
