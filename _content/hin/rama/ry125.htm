<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLVII.: THE CITIZENS' RETURN.</H3>
<P>
The people, when the morn shone fair,<BR>
Arose to find no R&aacute;ma there.<BR>
Then fear and numbing grief subdued<BR>
The senses of the multitude.<BR>
The woe-born tears were running fast<BR>
As all around their eyes they cast,<BR>
And sadly looked, but found no trace<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma, searching every place.<BR>
Bereft of R&aacute;ma good and wise.<BR>
With drooping cheer and weeping eyes,<BR>
Each woe-distracted sage gave vent<BR>
To sorrow in his wild lament:<BR>
'Woe worth the sleep that stole our sense<BR>
With its beguiling influence,<BR>
That now we look in vain for him<BR>
Of the broad chest and stalwart limb!<BR>
How could the strong-armed hero, thus<BR>
Deceiving all, abandon us?<BR>
His people so devoted see,<BR>
Yet to the woods, a hermit, flee?<BR>
How can he, wont our hearts to cheer,<BR>
As a fond sire his children dear,--<BR>
How can the pride of Raghu's race<BR>
Fly from us to some desert place!<BR>
Here let us all for death prepare,<BR>
Or on the last great journey fare. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_320"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Of R&aacute;ma our dear lord bereft,<BR>
What profit in our lives is left?<BR>
Huge trunks of trees around us lie,<BR>
With roots and branches sere and dry.<BR>
Come let us set these logs on tire<BR>
And throw our bodies on the pyre.<BR>
What shall we speak? How can we say<BR>
We followed R&aacute;ma on his way.<BR>
The mighty chief whose arm is strong,<BR>
Who sweetly speaks, who thinks no wrong?<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;'s town with sorrow dumb,<BR>
Without our lord will see us come,<BR>
And hopeless misery will strike<BR>
Elder, and child, and dame alike.<BR>
Forth with that peerless chief we came,<BR>
Whose mighty heart is aye the same:<BR>
How, reft of him we love, shall we<BR>
Retuming dare that town to see?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Complaining thus with varied cry<BR>
They tossed their aged arms on high.<BR>
And their sad hearts with grief were wrung.<BR>
Like cows who sorrow for their young.<BR>
A while they followed on the road<BR>
Which traces of his chariot showed,<BR>
But when at length those traces failed,<BR>
A deep despair their hearts assailed.<BR>

The chariot marks no more discerned,<BR>
The hopeless sages backward turned:<BR>
'Ah, what is this? What can we more?<BR>
Fate stops the way, and all is o'er.'<BR>
With wearied hearts, in grief and shame<BR>
They took the road by which they came,<BR>
And reached Ayodhy&aacute;'s city, where<BR>
From side to side was naught but care.<BR>
With troubled spirits quite cast down<BR>
They looked upon the royal town,<BR>
And from their eyes, oppressed with woe,<BR>
Their tears again began to flow.<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma reft, the city wore<BR>
No look of beauty as before,<BR>
Like a dull river or a lake<BR>
By Garud robbed of every snake.<BR>
Dark, dismal as the moonless sky,<BR>
Or as a sea whose bed is dry,<BR>
So sad, to every pleasure dead,<BR>
They saw the town, disquieted.<BR>
On to their houses, high and vast,<BR>
Where stores of precious wealth were massed,<BR>
The melancholy Br&aacute;hmans passed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Their hearts with anguish cleft:<BR>
Aloof from all, they came not near<BR>
To stranger or to kinsman dear,<BR>
Showing in faces blank and drear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That not one joy was left.<BR>
