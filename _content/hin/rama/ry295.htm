<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXI.: HANUM&Aacute;N'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
There, like a fallen star, the dame<BR>
Fell by her lord's half lifeless frame;<BR>
And Hanum&aacute;n drew softly near,<BR>
And strove her grieving heart to.cheer:<BR>
'By changeless law our bliss and woe<BR>
From ancient worth and folly flow.<BR>
What fruits soe'er we cull, the seeds<BR>
Were scattered by our former deeds.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>

<P>
Why mourn another's mournful fate,<BR>
And weep, thyself unfortunate?<BR>
Be calm, O thou whose heart is wise,<BR>
for none deserves another's sighs.<BR>
Look up, with idle sorrow strive:<BR>
Thy child, his heir, is yet alive.<BR>
Let needful rites be duly done,<BR>
Nor in thy woe forget thy son.<BR>
Regard the law which all obey:<BR>
They spring to life, they pass away.<BR>
Begin the task that bids thee rise,<BR>
And stay these tears, for thou art wise.<BR>
Our lord the king is doomed to die,<BR>
On whom ten million hearts rely,<BR>
Kind, liberal, patient, true, and just<BR>
Was lie in whom they place their trust,<BR>
And now he seeks the land of those<BR>
Who for the right subdue their foes.<BR>
Each V&aacute;nar lord with all his train,<BR>
Each ranger of this wild domain,<BR>
And Angad here, thy darling, see<BR>
A governor and friend in thee.<BR>
These twain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_604"></A><A HREF="ry296.htm#fn_604"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> whose hearts with sorrow ache<BR>
The funeral rites shall undertake,<BR>
And Angad by his mother's care<BR>
Be king, his father's rightful heir.<BR>
Now let him pay, as laws require,<BR>
His sacred duty to his sire,<BR>
Nor one solemnity omit<BR>
Of all that mighty kings befit.<BR>
And when thy loud eye sees thine own<BR>
Dear Angad on his father's throne,<BR>
Then, lightened of its load of pain,<BR>
Thy spirit will have rest again.'<BR>

<P>
She heard his speech, she heaved her head,<BR>
Looked upon Hanum&aacute;n and said,<BR>

<P>
'Sweeter my slain lord's limbs to touch,<BR>
Than Angad or a hundred such.<BR>
No rule or right, a widowed dame,<BR>
O'er Angad or the realm I claim,<BR>
Sugriva is the uncle, he<BR>
In every act supreme must be,<BR>
I pray thee, chief, this plan resign,<BR>
Nor claim from me what ne'er is mine.<BR>
The father with his tender care<BR>
Guards the dear child the mother bare,<BR>
Where'er I be, no sweeter task,<BR>
No happier joy I hope or ask<BR>
Than thus to sit with loving eyes<BR>
And watch the bed where B&aacute;li lies.<BR>
