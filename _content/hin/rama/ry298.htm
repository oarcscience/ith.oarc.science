<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXIV.: SUGR&Iacute;VA'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
But when Sugr&iacute;va saw her weep<BR>
O'erwhelmed in sorrow's rushing deep.<BR>
Swift through his bosom pierced the sting<BR>
Of anguish for the fallen king.<BR>
At the sad sight his eyes beheld<BR>
A flood of bitter tears outwelled,<BR>
And, with his bosom racked and rent,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma with his train he went.<BR>
He came with faltering steps and slow<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma held his mighty bow<BR>
And arrow like a venomed snake,<BR>
And to the son of Raghu spake:<BR>
'Well hast thou kept, O King, thy vow:<BR>
The promised fruit is gathered now.<BR>
But life is marred, my soul to-day<BR>
Turns sickening from all joy away.<BR>

<P>

<P>
For, while this queen laments and sighs<BR>
Amid a mourning people's cries,<BR>
And Angad weeps his father slain,<BR>
How can my heart delight to reign?<BR>
For outrage, fury, senseless pride,<BR>
My brother, doomed of yore, has died.<BR>
Yet, Raghu's son, in bitter woe<BR>
I mourn his fated overthrow.<BR>
Ah, better far in pain and ill<BR>
To dwell on Rishyam&uacute;ka still<BR>
Than gain the heaven of Gods and all<BR>
Its pleasures by my brother's fall.<BR>
Did not he cry,--great-hearted foe,--<BR>
'Go, for I will not slay thee, Go'?<BR>
With his brave soul those words agree:<BR>
My speech, my deeds, are worthy me.<BR>
How can a brother counterweigh<BR>
His grievous loss with joys of sway,<BR>
And see with dull unpitying eye<BR>
So brave and good a brother die?<BR>
His lofty soul was nobly blind:<BR>
My death alas, he ne'er designed;<BR>
But I, urged blindly on by hate,<BR>
Sought with his life my rage to sate.<BR>
He smote me with a splintered tree:<BR>
I groaned aloud and turned to flee,<BR>
From stern reproaches he forbore,<BR>
And gently bade me sin no more.<BR>
Serene and dutiful and good<BR>
He kept the laws of brotherhood:<BR>
I, fierce and greedy, vengeful, base,<BR>
Showed all the vices of our race.<BR>
Ah me, dear friend, my brother's fate<BR>
Lays on my soul a crushing weight:<BR>
A sin no heart should e'er conceive,<BR>
But at the thought each soul should grieve:<BR>
Sin such as Indra's when his blow<BR>
Laid heavenly Vis'var&uacute;pa &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_611"></A><A HREF="#fn_611"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> low.<BR>
Yet earth, the waters of the seas,<BR>
The race of women and the trees<BR>
Were fain upon themselves to take<BR>
The weight of sin for Indra's sake.<BR>
But who a V&aacute;nar's soul will free,<BR>
Or ease the load that crushes me?<BR>
Wretch that I am, I may not claim<BR>
The reverence due to royal name.<BR>
How shall I reign supreme, or dare<BR>
Affect the power I should not share?<BR>
Ah me, I sorrow for my sin,<BR>
The ruin of my race and kin,<BR>
Polluted by a hideous crime<BR>
World-hated till the end of time.<BR>
Alas, the floods of sorrow roll<BR>
With whelming force upon my soul:<BR>
So gathers the descending rain<BR>
In the deep hollow of the plain.<BR>
