<P>
Dismissed with every honour due<BR>
The V&aacute;nar from the spot withdrew.<BR>
Then joyous thought the Wind-God's son:<BR>
'The mighty task is wellnigh done.<BR>
The three expedients I must leave;<BR>
The fourth alone can I achieve. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_877"></A><A HREF="#fn_877"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
These dwellers in the giants' isle<BR>
No arts of mine can reconcile.<BR>
I cannot bribe: I cannot sow<BR>
Dissension mid the R&aacute;kshas foe.<BR>
Arts, gifts, address, these fiends despise;<BR>
But force shall yet their king chastise.<BR>
Perchance he may relent when all<BR>
The bravest of his chieftains fall.<BR>
This lovely grove will I destroy,<BR>
The cruel R&aacute;van's pride and joy.<BR>
The garden where he takes his ease<BR>
Mid climbing plants and flowery trees<BR>
That lift their proud tops to the skies,<BR>
Dear to the tyrant as his eyes.<BR>
Then will he rouse in wrath, and lead<BR>
His legions with the car and steed<BR>
And elephants in long array,<BR>
And seek me thirsty for the fray.<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas legions will I meet,<BR>
And all his bravest host defeat;<BR>
Then, glorious from the bloody plain,<BR>
Turn to my lord the king again.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then every lovely tree that bore<BR>
Fair blossoms, from the soil he tore,<BR>
Till each green bough that lent its shade<BR>
To singing birds on earth was laid.<BR>
The wilderness he left a waste,<BR>
The fountains shattered and defaced:<BR>
O'erthrew and levelled with the ground<BR>
Each shady seat and pleasure-mound.<BR>
Each arbour clad with climbing bloom,<BR>
Each grotto, cell, and picture room,<BR>
Each lawn by beast and bird enjoyed,<BR>
Each walk and terrace was destroyed.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And all the place that was so fair<BR>
Was left a ruin wild and bare,<BR>
As if the fury of the blast<BR>
Or raging fire had o'er it passed.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_876"></A><A HREF="ry379.htm#fr_876">417:1</A>  I omit two Cantos of dialogue. S&iacute;t&aacute;
tells Hanum&aacute;n again to convey her message
to R&aacute;ma and bid him hasten to rescue
her. Hanum&aacute;n replies as before that
there is no one on earth equal to R&aacute;ma,
who will soon come and destroy R&aacute;van.
There is not a new idea in the two Cantos:
all is reiteration.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_877"></A><A HREF="ry379.htm#fr_877">417:2</A>  The expedients to vanquish an enemy
or to make him come to terms are said to
be four: conciliation, gifts, disunion, and
force or punishment. Hanum&aacute;n considers
it useless to employ the first three and
resolves to punish R&aacute;van by destroying
his pleasure-grounds.</P>
