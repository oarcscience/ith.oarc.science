<P>
Struck down with overwhelming shame<BR>
She shrank within her trembling frame.<BR>
Each word of R&aacute;ma's like a dart<BR>
Had pierced the lady to the heart;<BR>
And from her sweet eyes unrestrained<BR>
The torrent of her sorrows, rained.<BR>
Her weeping eyes at length she dried,<BR>
And thus mid choking sobs replied:<BR>
'Canst thou, a high-born prince, dismiss<BR>
A hign-born dame with speech like this?<BR>
Such words befit the meanest hind,<BR>
Not princely birth and generous mind,<BR>
By all my virtuous life I swear<BR>
I am not what thy words declare.<BR>
If some are faithless, wilt thou find<BR>
No love and truth in womankind?<BR>
Doubt others if thou wilt, but own<BR>
The truth which all my life has shown.<BR>
If, when the giant seized his prey,<BR>
Within his hated arms I lay,<BR>
And felt the grasp I dreaded, blame<BR>
Fate and the robber, not thy dame.<BR>
What could a helpless woman do?<BR>
My heart was mine and still was true,<BR>
Why when Han&uacute;m&aacute;n sent by thee<BR>
Sought Lank&aacute;'s town across the sea,<BR>
Couldst thou not give, O lord of men,<BR>
Thy sentence of rejection then?<BR>
Then in the presence of the chief<BR>
Death, ready death, had brought relief,<BR>
Nor had I nursed in woe and pain<BR>
This lingering life, alas in vain.<BR>
Then hadst thou shunned the fruitless strife<BR>
Nor jeopardied thy noble life,<BR>
But spared thy friends and bold allies<BR>
Their vain and weary enterprise.<BR>
Is all forgotten, all? my birth,<BR>
Named Janak's child, from fostering earth?<BR>
That day of triumph when a maid<BR>
My trembling hand in thine I laid?<BR>
My meek obedience to thy will,<BR>
My faithful love through joy and ill,<BR>

<P>
That never failed at duty's call--<BR>
O King, is all forgotten, all?'<BR>

<P>
To Lakshman then she turned and spoke<BR>
While sobs and sighs her utterance broke:<BR>
'Sumitr&aacute;'s son, a pile prepare,<BR>
'My refuge in my dark despair.<BR>
I will not live to bear this weight<BR>
Of shame, forlorn and desolate.<BR>
The kindled fire my woes shall end<BR>
And be my best and surest friend.'<BR>

<P>
His mournful eyes the hero raised<BR>
And wistfully on R&aacute;ma gazed,<BR>
In whose stern look no ruth was seen,<BR>
No mercy for the weeping queen.<BR>
No chieftain dared to meet those eyes,<BR>
To pray, to question or advise.<BR>

<P>
The word was passed, the wood was piled<BR>
And fain to die stood Janak's child.<BR>
She slowly paced around her lord.<BR>
The Gods with reverent act adored,<BR>
Then raising suppliant hands the dame<BR>
Frayed humbly to the Lord of Flame;<BR>
'As this fond heart by virtue swayed<BR>
From Raghu's son has never strayed,<BR>
So, universal witness, Fire<BR>
Protect my body on the pyre,<BR>
As Raghu's son has idly laid<BR>
This charge on S&iacute;t&aacute;, hear and aid.'<BR>

<P>
She ceased: and fearless to the last<BR>
Within the flame's wild fury passed.<BR>
Then rose a piercing cry from all<BR>
Dames, children, men, who saw her fall<BR>
Adorned with gems and gay attire<BR>
Beneath the fury of the fire.<BR>
