### CANTO CXI.: VIBHÍSHAN'S LAMENT.

Vibhíshan saw his brother slain,  
Nor could his heart its woe contain.  
O'er the dead king he sadly bent  
And mourned him with a loud lament:  
'O hero, bold and brave.' he cried,  
'Skilled in all arms, in battle tried.  
Spoiled of thy crown, with limbs outspread.

Why wilt thou press thy gory bed?  
Why slumber on the earth's cold breast,  
When sumptuous couches woo to rest?  
Ah me, my brother over bold,  
Thine is the fate my heart foretold:  
But love and pride forbade to hear  
The friend who blamed thy wild career.  
Fallen is the sun who gave us light,  
Our lordly moon is veiled in night.  
Our beacon fire is dead and cold  
A hundred waves have o'er it rolled.  
What could his light and fire avail  
Against Lord Ráma's arrowy hail?  
Woe for the giants' royal tree,  
Whose stately height was fair to see.  
His buds were deeds of kingly grace,  
His bloom the sons who decked his race.  
With rifled bloom and mangled bough  
The royal tree lies prostrate now.'  
'Nay, idly mourn not," Ráma cried,  
'The warrior king has nobly died,  
Interpid hero, firm through all.  
So fell he as the brave should fall;  
And ill beseems it chiefs like us  
To weep for those who perish thus.  
Be firm: thy causeless grief restrain,  
And pay the dues that yet remain,  

Again Vibhíshan sadly spoke:  
'His was the hero arm that broke  
Embattled Gods' and Indra's might,  
Unconquered ere to-day in fight.  
He rushed against thee, fought and fell,  
As Ocean, when his waters swell,  
Hurling his might against a rock,  
Falls spent and shattered by the shock  
Woe for our king's untimely end,  
The generous lord the trusty friend:  
Our sure defence when fear arose,  
A dreaded scourge to stubborn foes.  
O, let the king thy hand has slain  
The honours of the dead obtain.'  

Then Ráma answered. 'Hatred dies  
When low in dust the foeman lies.  
Now triumph bids the conflict cease,  
And knits us in the bonds of peace.  
Let funeral rites be duly paid.  
And be it mine thy toil to aid.'
