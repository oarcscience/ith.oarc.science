<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LIII.: ANGAD'S COUNSEL.</H3>
<P>
They looked upon the boundless main<BR>
The awful seat of Varun's reign.<BR>
And heard his waters roar and rave<BR>
Terrific with each crested wave.<BR>
Then, in the depths of sorrow drowned,<BR>
They sat upon the bosky ground,<BR>
And sadly, as they pondered, grieved<BR>
For days gone by and naught achieved.<BR>
Pain pierced them through with sharper sting<BR>
When, gazing on the trees of spring,<BR>
They saw each waving bough that showed<BR>
The treasures of its glorious load,<BR>
And helpless, fainting with the weight<BR>
Of woe they sank disconsolate.<BR>
Then, lion-shouldered, stout and strong,<BR>
The noblest of the V&aacute;nar throng,<BR>
Angad the prince imperial rose,<BR>
And, deeply stricken by the woes<BR>
That his impetuous spirit broke,<BR>
Thus gently to the chieftains spoke:<BR>
'Mark ye not, V&aacute;nars, that the day<BR>
Our monarch fixed has passed away?<BR>
The month is lost in toil and pain,<BR>
And now, my friends, what hopes remain?<BR>
On you, in lore of counsel tried,<BR>
Our king Sugr&iacute;va most relied.<BR>
Your hearts, with strong affection fraught,<BR>

<P>
His weal in every labour sought,<BR>
And the true valour of your band<BR>
Was blazoned wide in every land.<BR>
Forth on the toilsome search you sped,<BR>
By me--for so he willed it--led.<BR>
To us, of every hope bereft,<BR>
Death is the only refuge left.<BR>
For none a happy life may see<BR>
Who fails to do our king's decree.<BR>
Come, let us all from food abstain,<BR>
And perish thus, since hope is vain.<BR>
Stern is our king and swift to ire,<BR>
Imperious, proud, and fierce like fire,<BR>
And ne'er will pardon us the crime<BR>
Of fruitless search and wasted time.<BR>
Far better thus to end our lives,<BR>
And leave our wealth, our homes and wives,<BR>
Leave our dear little ones and all,<BR>
Than by his vengeful hand to fall.<BR>
Think not Sugr&iacute;va's wrath will spare<BR>
Me B&aacute;li's son, imperial heir:<BR>
For Raghu's royal son, not he,<BR>
To this high place anointed me,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, long my bitter foe,<BR>
With eager hand will strike the blow,<BR>
And, mindful of the old offence,<BR>
Will slay me now for negligence,<BR>
Nor will my pitying friends have power<BR>
To save me in the deadly hour.<BR>
No--here, O chieftains, will I lie<BR>
By ocean's marge, and fast and die.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They heard the royal prince declare<BR>
The purpose of his fixt despair;<BR>
And all, by common terror moved,<BR>
His speech in these sad words approved:<BR>
'Sugr&iacute;va's heart is hard and stern,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's thoughts for S&iacute;t&aacute; yearn.<BR>
Our forfeit lives will surely pay<BR>
For idle search and long delay,<BR>
And our fierce king will bid us die<BR>
The favour of his friend to buy.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then T&aacute;ra softly spake to cheer<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' hearts oppressed by fear:<BR>
'Despair no more, your doubts dispel:<BR>
Come in this ample cavern dwell.<BR>
There may we live in blissful ease<BR>
Mid springs and fruit and bloomy trees,<BR>
Secure from every foe's assault,<BR>
For magic framed the wondrous vault.<BR>
Protected there we need not fear<BR>
Though R&aacute;ma and our king come near;<BR>
Nor dread e'en him who batters down<BR>
The portals of the foeman's town.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_758"></A><A HREF="#fn_758"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
