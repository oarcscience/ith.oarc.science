<P>
'Then Bharat to Satrughna showed<BR>
The spot, and eager onward strode,<BR>
First bidding Saint Vasishtha bring<BR>
The widowed consorts of the king,<BR>
As by fraternal love impelled<BR>
His onward course the hero held,<BR>
Sumantra followed close behind<BR>
Satrughra with an anxious mind:<BR>
Not Bharat's self more fain could be<BR>
To look on Rama's face than he.<BR>
As, speeding on, the spot he neared,<BR>
Amid the hermits' homes appeared<BR>
His brother's cot with leaves o'erspread,<BR>
And by its side a lowly shed.<BR>
Before the shed great heaps were left<BR>
Of gathered flowers and billets cleft,<BR>
And on the trees hung grass and bark<BR>
Rama and Lakshman's path to mark:<BR>
And heaps of fuel to provide<BR>
Against the cold stood ready dried.<BR>
The long-armed chief, as on he went<BR>
In glory's light preeminent,<BR>
With joyous words like these addressed<BR>
The brave Satrughna and the rest:<BR>
'This is the place, I little doubt,<BR>
Which Bharadv&aacute;ja pointed out,<BR>
Not far from where we stand must be<BR>
The woodland stream, Mand&aacute;kini.<BR>
Here on the mountain's woody side<BR>
Roam elephants in tusked pride,<BR>
And ever with a roar and cry<BR>
Each other, as they meet, defy.<BR>
And see those smoke-wreaths thick and dark:<BR>
The presence of the flame they mark,<BR>
Which hermits in the forest strive<BR>
By every art to keep alive.<BR>
O happy me! my task is done,<BR>
And I shall look on Raghu's son,<BR>
Like some great saint, who loves to treat<BR>
His elders with all reverence meet.'<BR>
Thus Bharat reached that forest rill,<BR>
Thus roamed on Chitrakuta's hill;<BR>
Then pity in his breast awoke,<BR>
And to his friends the hero spoke:<BR>
'Woe, woe upon my life and birth!<BR>
The prince of men, the lord of earth<BR>
Has sought the lonely wood to dwell<BR>
Sequestered in a hermit's cell.<BR>
Through me, through me these sorrows fall<BR>
On him the splendid lord of all:<BR>
Through me resigning earthly bliss<BR>
He hides him in a home like this.<BR>
Now will I, by the world abhorred,<BR>
Fall at the dear feet of my lord,<BR>
And at fair Sitft's too, to win<BR>
His pardon for my heinous sin.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As thus he sadly mourned and sighed,<BR>
The son of Dasaratha spied<BR>
A bower of leafy branches made,<BR>
Sacred and lovely in the shade,<BR>
Of fair proportions large and tall,<BR>
Well roofed with boughs of palm, and S&aacute;l,<BR>
Arranged in order due o'erhead<BR>
Like grass upor an altar spread.<BR>
Two glorious bows were gleaming there,<BR>
Like Indra's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the rainy air,<BR>
Terror of foemen. backed with gold,<BR>
Meet for the mightiest hand to hold:<BR>
And quivered arrows cast a blaze<BR>
Bright gleaming like the Day-God's rays:<BR>
Thus serpents with their eyes aglow<BR>
Adorn their capital below.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Great swords adorned the cottage, laid<BR>
Each in a case of gold brocade;<BR>
There hung the trusty shields, whereon.<BR>
With purest gold the bosses shone.<BR>
The brace to bind the bowman's arm,<BR>
The glove to shield his hand from harm,<BR>
A lustre to the cottage lent<BR>
From many a golden ornament:<BR>
Safe was the cot from fear of men<BR>
As from wild beasts the lion's den.<BR>
The fire upon the altar burned,<BR>
That to the north and east was turned.<BR>
Bharat his eager glances bent<BR>
And gazed within the cot intent;<BR>
In deerskin dress, with matted hair,<BR>
Rama his chief was sitting there:<BR>
With liou-shl ulders broad and strong,<BR>
With lotus eyes, arms thick and long.<BR>
The righteous sovereign, who should be<BR>
Lord paramount from sea to sea,<BR>
High-minded, born to lofty fate,<BR>
Like Brahma's self supremely great;<BR>
With Lakshman by his side, and her,<BR>
Fair Sita, for his minister.<BR>
And Bharat gazing, overcome<BR>
By sorrow for a while was dumb,<BR>
Then, yielding to his woe, he ran<BR>
To Kama and with sobs began:<BR>
'He who a royal seat should fill<BR>
With subjects round to do his will,<BR>
My elder brother,--see him here,<BR>
With silvan creatures waiting near.<BR>
The high-souled hero, wont to wear<BR>
The costliest robes exceeding fair,<BR>
Now banished, in a deerskin dress,<BR>
Here keeps the path of righteousness.<BR>
How brooks the son of Eaghu now<BR>
The matted locks which load his brow,<BR>
Around whose princely head were twined<BR>
Sweet blossoms of the rarest kind?<BR>
The prince whose merits grew, acquired<BR>

<P>
By rites performed as he desired,<BR>
Would now a store of merit gain<BR>
Bought by his body's toil and pain.<BR>
Those limbs to which pure sandal lent<BR>
The freshness of its fragrant scent,<BR>
Exposed to sun. and dust, and rain,<BR>
Are now defiled with many a stain.<BR>
And I the wretched cause why this<BR>
Falls on the prince whose right is bliss!<BR>
Ah me, that ever I was born<BR>
To be the people's hate and scorn!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Bharat cried: of anguish sprung,<BR>
Great drops upon his forehead hung.<BR>
He fell o'erpowered-his grief was such-<BR>
Ere he is brother's feet could touch.<BR>
As on the glorious prince he gazed<BR>
In vain his broken voice he raised:<BR>
'Dear lord'--through tears and sobbing came,<BR>
The only words his lips could frame.<BR>
And brave Satrughna wept aloud,<BR>
As low at R&aacute;ma's feet he bowed.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, while his tears ran fast,<BR>
His arms around his brothers cast.<BR>
Guha, Sumantra came to meet<BR>
The princes in their wild retreat.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Vrihaspati and Sukra bright<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Their greeting thus rejoice to pay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To the dear Lord who brings the night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And the great God who rules the day.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then wept the dwellers of the shade,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Whose eyes the princes, meet to ride<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  On mighty elephants, surveyed;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And cast all thought of joy aside.<BR>
