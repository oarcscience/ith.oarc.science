<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXVII.: R&Aacute;MA APPEASED.</H3>
<P>
As R&aacute;ma, pierced by sorrow's sting,<BR>
Lamented like a helpless thing,<BR>
And by his mighty woe distraught<BR>
Was last in maze of troubled thought,<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;'s son with loving care<BR>
Consoled him in his wild despair,<BR>
And while his feet he gently pressed<BR>
With words like these the chief addressed;<BR>
'For sternest vow and noblest deed<BR>
Was Das'aratha blessed with seed.<BR>
Thee for his son the king obtained,<BR>
Like Amrit by the Gods regained.<BR>
Thy gentle graces won his heart,<BR>
And all too weak to live apart<BR>
The monarch died, as Bharat told,<BR>
And lives on high mid Gods enrolled.<BR>

<P>
If thou, O R&aacute;ma, wilt not bear<BR>
This grief which fills thee with despair,<BR>
How shall a weaker man e'er hope,<BR>
Infirm and mean, with woe to cope?<BR>
Take heart, I pray thee, noblest chief:<BR>
What man who breathes is free from grief?<BR>
Misfortunes come and burn like flame,<BR>
Then fly as quickly as they came.<BR>
Yay&aacute;ti son of Nahush reigned<BR>
With Indra on the throne he gained.<BR>
But falling for a light offence<BR>
He mourned a while the consequence.<BR>
Vasishtha, reverend saint and sage,<BR>
Priest of our sire from youth to age,<BR>
Begot a hundred sons, but they<BR>
Were smitten in a single day. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And she, the queen whom all revere,<BR>
The mother whom we hold so dear,<BR>
The earth herself not seldom feels<BR>
Fierce fever when she shakes and reels.<BR>
And those twin lights,the world's great eyes,<BR>
On which the universe relies,--<BR>
Does not eclipse at times assail<BR>
Their brilliance till their fires grow pale?<BR>
The mighty Powers, the Immortal Blest<BR>
Bend to a law which none contest.<BR>
No God, no bodied life is free<BR>
From conquering Fate's supreme decree,<BR>
E'en S'akra's self must reap the meed<BR>
Of virtue and of sinful deed.<BR>
And O great lord of men, wilt thou<BR>
Helpless beneath thy misery bow?<BR>
No, if thy dame be lost or dead,<BR>
O hero, still be comforted,<BR>
Nor yield for ever to thy woe<BR>
O'ermastered like the mean and low.<BR>
Thy peers, with keen far-reaching eyes,<BR>
Spend not their hours in ceaseless sighs;<BR>
In dire distress, in whelming ill<BR>
Their manly looks are hopeful still.<BR>
To this, great chief, thy reason bend,<BR>
And earnestly the truth perpend.<BR>
By reason's aid the wisest learn<BR>
The good and evil to discern.<BR>
With sin and goodness scarcely known<BR>
Faint light by chequered lives is shown;<BR>
Without some clear undoubted deed<BR>
We mark not how the fruits succeed.<BR>
In time of old, O thou most brave,<BR>
To me thy lips such counsel gave.<BR>
Vrihaspati &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> can scarcely find<BR>
New wisdom to instruct thy mind.<BR>
For thine is wit and genious high<BR>
Meet for the children of the sky.<BR>
I rouse that heart benumbed by pain<BR>
And call to vigorous life again.<BR>
Be manly godlike vigour shown;<BR>
Put forth that noblest strength, thine own.<BR>

<P>
Strive, best of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's strain,<BR>
Strive till the conquered foe be slain.<BR>
Where is the profit or the joy<BR>
If thy fierce rage the worlds destroy?<BR>
Search till thou find the guilty foe,<BR>
Then let thy hand no mercy show.'<BR>
