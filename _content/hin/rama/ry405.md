### CANTO VI.: RÁVAN'S SPEECH.

But when the giant king surveyed  
His glorious town in ruin laid,  
And each dire sign of victory won  
By Hanumán the Wind-God's son,  
He vailed his angry eyes oppressed  
By shame, and thus his lords addressed:  
'The Vánar spy has passed the gate  
Of Lanká long inviolate,  
Eluded watch and ward, and seen  
With his bold eyes the captive queen.  
My royal roof with flames is red,  
The bravest of my lords are dead,  
And the fierce Vánar in his hate  
Has left our city desolate.  
Now ponder well the work that lies  
Before us, ponder and advise.  
With deep-observing judgment scan  
The peril, and mature a plan.  
From counsel, sages say, the root,  
Springs victory, most glorious fruit.  
First ranks the king, when woe impends  
Who seeks the counsel of his friends,  
Of kinsmen ever faithful found,  
Or those whose hopes with his are bound,  
Then with their aid his strength applies,  
And triumphs in his enterprise.  
Next ranks the prince who plans alone,  
No counsel seeks to aid his own,  
Weighs loss and gain and wrong and right,  
And seeks success with earnest might.  
Unwisest he who spurns delays,  
Who counts no cost, no peril weighs,  
Speeds to his aim, defying fate,  
And risks his all, precipitate.  
Thus too in counsel sages find  
A best, a worst, a middle kind.  
When gathered counsellors explore  
The way by light of holy lore,  
And all from first to last agree,  
Is the best counsel of the three.  
Next, if debate first waxes high,  
And each his chosen plan would try  
Till all agree at last, we deem  
This counsel second in esteem.  
Worst of the three is this, when each  
Assails with taunt his fellow's speech;  
When all debate, and no consent  
Concludes the angry argument.  
Consult then, lords; my task shall be  
To crown with act your wise decree.  
With thousands of his wild allies  
The vengeful Ráma hither hies;  
With unresisted might and speed  
Across the flood his troops will lead,  
Or for the Vánar host will drain  
The channels of the conquered main.'
