<P>
When R&aacute;ma saw the giant nigh.<BR>
On foot, alone, with mace reared high,<BR>
In mild reproof at first he spoke.<BR>
Then forth his threatening anger broke:<BR>
'Thou with the host 'twas thine to lead,<BR>
With elephant and car and steed,<BR>
Hast wrought an act of sin and shame,<BR>
An act which all who live must blame.<BR>
Know that the wretch whose evil mind<BR>
Through the grief of human kind,<BR>
Through the three worlds confess him lord,<BR>
Must perish dreaded and abhorred.<BR>
Night-rover, when a villain's deeds<BR>
Distress the world he little heeds,<BR>
Each hand is armed his life to take,<BR>
And crush him like a deadly snake.<BR>
The end is near when men begin<BR>
Through greed or lust a life of sin,<BR>
E'en as a Br&aacute;hman's dame, unwise,<BR>
Eats of the fallen hail &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and dies.<BR>

<P>
Thy hand has slain the pure and good,<BR>
The hermit saints of Dandak wood,<BR>
Of holy life, the heirs of bliss;<BR>
And thou shalt reap the fruit of this.<BR>
Not long shall they whose cruel breasts<BR>
Joy in the sin the world detests<BR>
Retain their guilty power and pride,<BR>
But fade like trees whose roots are dried.<BR>
Yes, as the seasons come and go.<BR>
Each tree its kindly fruit must show,<BR>
And sinners reap in fitting time<BR>
The harvest of each earlier crime.<BR>
As those must surely die who eat<BR>
Unwittingly of poisoned meat,<BR>
They too whose lives in sin are spent<BR>
Receive ere long the punishment.<BR>
And know, thou rover of the night,<BR>
That I, a king, am sent to smite<BR>
The wicked down, who court the hate<BR>
Of men whose laws they violate.<BR>
This day my vengeful hand shall send<BR>
Shafts bright with gold to tear and rend,<BR>
And pass with fury through thy breast<BR>
As serpents pierce an emmet's nest.<BR>
Thou with thy host this day shalt be<BR>
Among the dead below, and see<BR>
The saints beneath thy hand who bled,<BR>
Whose flesh thy cruel maw has fed.<BR>
They, glorious on their seats of gold,<BR>
Their slayer shall in hell behold.<BR>
Fight with all strength thou callest thine,<BR>
Mean scion of ignoble line,<BR>
Still, like the palm-tree's fruit, this day<BR>
My shafts thy head in dust shall lay.'<BR>

<P>
Such were the words that R&aacute;ma said:<BR>
Then Khara's eyes with wrath glowed red,<BR>
Who, maddened by the rage that burned<BR>
Within him, with a smile returned:<BR>

<P>
'Thou Das'aratha's son, hast slain<BR>
The meaner giants of my train:<BR>
And canst thou idly vaunt thy might<BR>
And claim the praise not thine by right?<BR>
Not thus in self-laudation rave<BR>
The truly great, the nobly brave:<BR>
No empty boasts like thine disgrace<BR>
The foremost of the human race.<BR>
The mean of soul, unknown to fame,<BR>
Who taint their warrior race with shame,<BR>
Thus speak in senseless pride as thou,<BR>
O Raghu's son, hast boasted now,<BR>
What hero, when the war-dry rings,<BR>
Vaunts the high race from which he springs,<BR>
Or seeks, when warriors meet and die.<BR>
His own descent to glorify?<BR>
Weakness and folly show confessed<BR>
In every vaunt thou utterest,<BR>
As when the flames fed high with grass<BR>
Detect the *simulating* brass,<BR>
Dost thou note see me standing here<BR>
Armed with the mighty mace I rear,<BR>
*Firm* as an earth upholding hill<BR>
Whose summit veins of metal fill?<BR>
Lo, here I stand before thy face<BR>
To slay thee with my murderous mace,<BR>
As Death, the universal lord,<BR>
Stands threatening with his fatal cord.<BR>
Enough of this. Much more remains<BR>
That should be said: but time constrains.<BR>
Ere to his rest the sun descend,<BR>
And shades of night the combat end,<BR>
The twice seven thousand of my band<BR>
Who fell beneath thy bloody hand<BR>
Shall have their tears all wiped away<BR>
And triumph in thy fall to-day.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke, and loosing from his hold<BR>
His mighty mace ringed round with gold,<BR>
Like some red bolt alive with fire<BR>
Hurled it at R&aacute;ma, mad with ire.<BR>
The ponderous mace which Khara threw<BR>
Sent fiery flashes as it flew.<BR>
Trees, shrubs were scorched beneath the blast,<BR>
As onward to its aim it passed.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma, watching as it sped<BR>
Dire as His noose who rules the dead,<BR>
Cleft it with arrows as it came<BR>
On rushing with a hiss and flame.<BR>
Its fury spent and burnt away,<BR>
Harmless upon the ground it lay<BR>
Like a great snake in furious mood<BR>
By herbs of numbing power subdued.<BR>
