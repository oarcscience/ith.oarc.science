<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXX.: BHARAT'S DEPARTURE.</H3>
<P>
While thus he spoke, the envoys borne<BR>
On horses faint and travel-worn<BR>
Had gained the city fenced around<BR>
With a deep moat's protecting bound.<BR>
An audience of the king they gained,<BR>
And honours from the prince obtained;<BR>
The monarch's feet they humbly pressed,<BR>
To Bharat next these words addressed:<BR>
'The household priest and peers by us<BR>
Send health to thee and greet thee thus:<BR>
&nbsp; Come to thy father's house with haste:<BR>
Thine absent time no longer waste.<BR>
Receive these vestures rich and rare,<BR>
These costly gems and jewels fair,<BR>
And to thy uncle here present<BR>
Each precious robe and ornament.<BR>
These for the king and him suffice--<BR>
Two hundred millions is their price--<BR>
These, worth a hundred millions, be<BR>
Reserved, O large-eyed Prince, for thee.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Loving his frieuds with heart and soul,<BR>
The joyful prince received thie whole,<BR>
Due honour to the envoys paid,<BR>
And thus in turn his answer made:<BR>
'Of Das'aratha tidings tell:<BR>
Is the old king my father well?<BR>
Is R&aacute;ma, and is Lakshman, he<BR>
Of the high-soul, from sickness free?<BR>
And she who walks where duty leads,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; known for gracious deeds,<BR>
Mother of R&aacute;ma, loving spouse,<BR>
Bound to her lord by well kept vows?<BR>
And Lakshman's mother too, the dame<BR>
Sumitr&aacute; skilled in duty's claim,<BR>
Who brave S'atrughna also bore,<BR>
Second in age,--her health declare.<BR>

<P>
And she, in self-conceit most sage,<BR>
With selfish heart most prone to rage,<BR>
My mother, fares she well? has she<BR>
Sent message or command to me?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Bharat spake, the mighty-souled,<BR>
And they in brief their tidings told:<BR>
'All they of whom thou askest dwell,<BR>
O lion lord, secure and well:<BR>
Thine all the smiles of fortune are:<BR>
Make ready; let them yoke the car.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus by the royal envoys pressed,<BR>
Bharat again the band addressed:<BR>
'I go with you: no long delay,<BR>
A single hour I bid you stay.'<BR>
Thus Bharat, son of him who swayed<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;s realm, his answer made,<BR>
And then bespoke, his heart to please,<BR>
His mother's sire in words like these:<BR>
'I go to see my father, King,<BR>
Urged by the envoys' summoning;<BR>
And when thy soul desires to see<BR>
Thy grandson, will return to thee.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The king his grandsire kissed his head,<BR>
And in reply to Bharat said:<BR>
'Go forth, dear child: how blest is she,<BR>
The mother of a son like thee!<BR>
Greet well thy sire, thy mother greet,<BR>
O thou whose arms the foe defeat;<BR>
The household priest, and all the rest<BR>
Amid the Twice-born chief and best;<BR>
And R&aacute;ma and brave Lakschman, who<BR>
Shoot the long shaft with aim so true.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To him the king high honour showed,<BR>
And store of wealth and gifts bestowed,<BR>
The choicest elephants to ride,<BR>
And skins and blankets deftly dyed,<BR>
A thousand strings of golden beads,<BR>
And sixteen hundred mettled steeds:<BR>
And boundless wealth before him piled<BR>
Gave Kekaya to Kaikey&aacute;s child.<BR>
And men of counsel, good and tried,<BR>
On whose firm truth he aye relied,<BR>
King As'vapati gave with speed<BR>
Prince Bharat on his way to lead.<BR>
And noble elephants, strong and young,<BR>
From sires of Indras'ira sprung,<BR>
And others tall and fair to view<BR>
Of great Air&aacute;vat's lineage true:<BR>
And well yoked asses fleet of limb<BR>
The prince his uncle gave to him.<BR>
And dogs within the palace bred,<BR>
Of body vast and massive head,<BR>
With mighty fangs for battle, brave,<BR>
The tiger's match in strength, he gave.<BR>
Yet Bharat's bosom hardly glowed<BR>
To see the wealth the king bestowed;<BR>
For he would speed that hour away,<BR>
Such care upon his bosom lay:<BR>
Those eager envoys urged him thence,<BR>
And that sad vision's influence.<BR>
He left hia court-yard, crowded then<BR>
With elephants and steeds and men,<BR>
And, peerless in immortal fame,<BR>
To the great royal street he came.<BR>
He saw, as farther still he went,<BR>
The inner rooms most excellent,<BR>
And passed the doors, to him unclosed,<BR>
Where check nor bar his way oppossd.<BR>
There Bharat stayed to bid adieu<BR>
To grandsire and to uncle too,<BR>
Then, with S'atrughna by his side,<BR>
Mounting his car, away he hied.<BR>
The strong-wheeled cars were yoked, and<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   they<BR>
More than a hundred, rolled away:<BR>
Servants, with horses, asses, kine,<BR>
Followed their lord in endless line.<BR>
So, guarded by his own right hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Forth high-souled Bharat hied,<BR>
Surrounded by a lordly band<BR>
On whom the king relied.<BR>
Beside him sat S'atrughna dear,<BR>
The scourge of trembling foes:<BR>
Thus from the light of Indra's sphere<BR>
A saint made perfect goes.<BR>
