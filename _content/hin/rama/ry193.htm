<P>
Then when the pious chief had seen<BR>
Lodged in her home each widowed queen,<BR>
Still with his burning grief oppressed<BR>
His holy guides he thus addressed:<BR>
'I go to Nandigr&aacute;m: adieu,<BR>
This day, my lords to all of you:<BR>
I go, my load of grief to bear,<BR>
Reft of the son of Raghu, there.<BR>
The king my sire, alas, is dead.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to the forest fled;<BR>
There will I wait till he, restored,<BR>
Shall rule the realm, its lightful lord.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They heard the high-souled prince's speech,<BR>
And thus with ready answer each<BR>
Of those great lords their chief addressed.<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>
With saint Vas'ishtha and the rest:<BR>
'Good are the words which thou hast said,<BR>
By brotherly affection led,<BR>
Like thine own self, a faithful friend,<BR>
True to thy brother to the end:<BR>
A heart like thine must all approve,<BR>
Which naught from virtue's path can move,'<BR>

<P>
Soon as the words he loved to hear<BR>
Fell upon Bharat's joyful ear,<BR>
Thus to the charioteer he spoke:<BR>
'My car witn speed, Sumantra, yoke.'<BR>
Tnen Bharat with delighted mien<BR>
Obeisance paid to every queen,<BR>
And with S'atrughna by his side<BR>
Mounting the car away he hied.<BR>
With lords, and priests in long array<BR>
Tne brothers hastened on their way.<BR>
And the great pomp the Br&aacute;hmans led<BR>
With Saint Vas'ishtha at their head.<BR>
Then every face was eastward bent<BR>
As on to Nundigr&aacute;m they went.<BR>
Behind the army followed, all<BR>
Unsummoned by their leader's call,<BR>
And steeds and elephants and men<BR>
Streamed forth with every citizen.<BR>
As Bharat in his chariot rode<BR>
His heart with love fraternal glowed,<BR>
And with the sandals on his head<BR>
To Nundigr&aacute;m he quickly sped.<BR>
Within the town he swiftly pressed,<BR>
Alighted, and his guides addressed:<BR>
'To me in trust my brother's hand<BR>
Consigned the lordship of the land,<BR>
When he these gold-wrought sandals gave<BR>
As emblems to protect and save.'<BR>
Then Bharat bowed, and from his head<BR>
The sacred pledge deposited,<BR>
And thus to all the people cried<BR>
Who ringed him round on every side:<BR>
'Haste, for these sandals quickly bring<BR>
The canopy that shades the king.<BR>
Pay ye to them all reverence meet<BR>
As to my elder brother's feet,<BR>
For they will right and law maintain<BR>
Until King R&aacute;ma come again.<BR>
My brother with a loving mind<BR>
These sandals to my charge consigned:<BR>
I till he come will guard with care<BR>
The sacred trust for Raghu's heir.<BR>
My watchful task will soon be done,<BR>
The pledge restored to Raghu's son;<BR>
Then shall I see, his wanderings o'er,<BR>
These sandals on his feet once more.<BR>
My brother I shall meet at last,<BR>
The burthen from my shoulders cast,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's hand the realm restore<BR>
And serve my elder as before.<BR>
When Rama takes again this pair<BR>
Of sandals kept with pious care,<BR>
And here his glorious reign begins,<BR>
I shall be cleansed from all my sins,<BR>

<P>
When the glad people's voices ring<BR>
With welcome to the new-made king,<BR>
Joy will be mine four-fold as great<BR>
As if supreme I ruled the state.'<BR>

<P>
Thus humbly spoke in sad lament<BR>
The chief in fame pre&euml;minent:<BR>
Thus, by his reverent lords obeyed,<BR>
At Nandigr&aacute;m the kingdom swayed.<BR>
With hermit's dress and matted hair<BR>
He dwelt with all his army there.<BR>
The sandals of his brother's feet<BR>
Installed upon the royal seat,<BR>
He, all his powers to them referred,<BR>
Affairs of state administered.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In every care, in every task,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    When golden store was brought,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He first, as though their rede to ask,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Those royal sandals sought.<BR>
