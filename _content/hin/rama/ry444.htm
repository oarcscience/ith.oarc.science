<P>
Brave R&aacute;ma, burning still to know<BR>
The station of his artful foe,<BR>

Gave to ten chieftains, mid the best<BR>
Of all the host, his high behest.<BR>
Swift rose in air the V&aacute;nar band:<BR>
Each region of the sky they scanned:<BR>
But R&aacute;van's son by magic skill<BR>
Checked them with arrows swifter still,<BR>
When streams of blood from chest and side<BR>
The dauntless V&aacute;nars' limbs had dyed.<BR>
The giant in his misty shroud<BR>
Showed like the sun obscured by cloud.<BR>
Like serpents hissing through the air,<BR>
His arrows smote the princely pair;<BR>
And from their limbs at every rent<BR>
A stream of rushing blood was sent.<BR>
Like Kins'uk trees they stood, that show<BR>
In spring their blossoms' crimson glow.<BR>
Then Indrajit with fury eyed<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's royal sons, and cried:<BR>

<P>
'Not mighty Indra can assail<BR>
Or see me when I choose to veil<BR>
My form in battle: and can ye,<BR>
Children of earth, contend with me?<BR>
The arrowy noose this hand has shot<BR>
Has bound you with a hopeless knot;<BR>
And, slaughtered by my shafts and bow,<BR>
To Yama's hall this hour ye go.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke, and shouted. Then anew<BR>
The arrows from his bowstring flew,<BR>
And pierced, well aimed with perfect art,<BR>
Each limb and joint and vital part.<BR>
Transfixed with shafts in every limb.<BR>
Their strength relaxed, their eyes grew dim.<BR>
As two tall standards side by side,<BR>
With each sustaining rope untied.<BR>
Fall levelled by the howling blast,<BR>
So earth's majestic lords at last<BR>
Beneath the arrowy tempest reeled,<BR>
And prostrate pressed the battle field.<BR>
