<P>
On to Prasravan's hill they sped<BR>
Where blooming trees their branches spread.<BR>
To Raghu's sons their heads they bent<BR>
And did obeisance reverent.<BR>
Then to their king, by Angad led,<BR>
Each V&aacute;nar chieftain bowed his head;<BR>
And Hanum&aacute;n the brave and bold<BR>
His tidings to the monarch told;<BR>
But first in R&aacute;ma's hand he placed<BR>
The gem that S&iacute;t&aacute;'s brow had graced:<BR>
'I crossed the sea: I searched a while<BR>
For S&iacute;t&aacute; in the giants' isle.<BR>
I found her vext with taunt and threat<BR>
By demon guards about her set.<BR>
Her tresses twined in single braid,<BR>
On the bare earth her limbs were laid.<BR>
Sad were her eyes: her cheeks were pale<BR>
As shuddering flowers in winter's gale.<BR>
I stood beside the weeping dame,<BR>
And gently whispered R&aacute;ma's name:<BR>
With cheering words her grief consoled,<BR>
And then the whole adventure told.<BR>
She weeps afar beyond the sea,<BR>
And her true heart is still with thee.<BR>
She gave a sign that thou wouldst know,<BR>
She bids thee think upon the crow,<BR>
And bright mark pressed upon her brow<BR>
When none was nigh but she and thou.<BR>
She bids thee take this precious stone,<BR>
The sea-born gem thou long hast known.<BR>
'And I', she said, 'will dull the sting<BR>
Of woe by gazing on the ring.<BR>
One little month shall I sustain<BR>
This life oppressed with woe and pain:<BR>
And when the month is ended, I<BR>
The giants' prey must surely die.'<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_902"></A><A HREF="ry397.htm#fr_902">426:1b</A>  Three Cantos consisting of little but
repetitions are omitted. Dadhimukh escapes
from the infuriated monkeys and
hastens to Sugr&iacute;va to report their misconduct.
Sugr&iacute;va infers that Hanum&aacute;n and
his band have been successful in their
search, and that the exuberance of spirits
and the mischief complained of, are but
the natural expression of their joy. Dadhimukh
obtains little sympathy from
Sugr&iacute;va, and is told to return and send
the monkeys on with all possible speed.</P>
