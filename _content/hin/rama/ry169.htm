<P>
Soon as he saw the prince's mind<BR>
To rest that day was well inclined,<BR>
He sought Kaikey&iacute;'s son to please<BR>
With hospitable courtesies.<BR>
Then Bharat to the saint replied:<BR>
'Our wants are more than satisfied.<BR>
The gifts which honoured strangers greet,<BR>
And water for our weary feet<BR>
Hast thou bestowed with friendly care,<BR>
And every choice of woodland fare.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Bharadv&aacute;ja spoke, a smile<BR>
Playing upon his lips the while:<BR>
'I know, dear Prince, thy friendly mind<BR>
Will any fare sufficient find,<BR>
But gladly would I entertain<BR>
And banquet all thine armed train:<BR>
Such is my earnest wish: do thou<BR>
This longing of my heart allow,<BR>
Why host thou hither bent thy way,<BR>
And made thy troops-behind thee stay?<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_198"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 198</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Why unattended? couldst thou not<BR>
With friends and army seek this spot?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bhharat, with reverent hands raised high,<BR>
To that great hermit made reply:<BR>
'My troops, for awe of thee, O Sage,<BR>
I brought not to thy hermitage:<BR>
Troops of a king or monarch's son<BR>
A hermit's home should ever shun.<BR>
Behind me comes a mighty train<BR>
Wide spreading o'er the ample plain,<BR>
Where every chief and captain leads<BR>
Men, elephants, and mettled steeds<BR>
I feared, O reverend Sage, lest these<BR>
Might harm the holy ground and trees,<BR>
Springs might be marred and cots o'er-thrown,<BR>
So with the priests I came alone.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Bring all thy host,' the hermit cried,<BR>
And Bharat, to his joy, complied.<BR>
Then to the chapel went the sire,<BR>
Where ever burnt the sacred fire,<BR>
And first, in order due, with sips<BR>
Of water purified his lips:<BR>
To Visvakarm&aacute;, then he prayed,<BR>
His hospitable feast to aid:<BR>
'Let Vis'vakarm&aacute; hear my call,<BR>
The God who forms and fashions all:<BR>
A mighty banquet I provide,<BR>
Be all my wants this day supplied.<BR>
Lord Indra at their head, the three &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Who guard the worlds I call to me:<BR>
A mighty host this day I feed,<BR>
Be now supplied my every need.<BR>
Let all the streams that eastward go,<BR>
And those whose waters westering flow,<BR>
Both on the earth and in the sky,<BR>
Flow hither and my wants supply.<BR>
Be some with ardent liquor filled,<BR>
And some with wine from flowers distilled,<BR>
While some their fresh cool streams retain<BR>
Sweet as the juice of sugar-cane,<BR>
I call the Gods I call the band<BR>
Of minstrels that around them stand:<BR>
I call the H&aacute;h&aacute; and Huh&uacute;,<BR>
I call the sweet Vis'v&aacute;sa<BR>
I call the heavenly wives of these<BR>
With all the bright Apsarases,<BR>
Alambushe of beauty rare,<BR>
The charmer of the tangled hair,<BR>
Ghrit&aacute;ch&iacute; And Vis'v&aacute;chi fair,<BR>
Hem&aacute; and Bh&iacute;m&aacute; sweet to view,<BR>
And lovely N&aacute;gadant&aacute; too,<BR>
And all the sweetest nymphs who stand<BR>
By Indra or by Brahm&aacute;'s hand--<BR>
I summon these with all their train<BR>
And Tumburu to lead the strain.<BR>
Here let Kuvera's garden rise<BR>
Which far in Northern Kuru &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> lies:<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
For leaves let cloth and gems entwine,<BR>
And let its fruit be nymphs divine.<BR>
Let Soma &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_367"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> give the noblest food<BR>
To feed the mighty multitude,<BR>
Of every kind, for tooth and lip,<BR>
To chew, to lick, to suck, and sip.<BR>
Let wreaths, where fairest flowers abound,<BR>
Spring from the trees that bloom around.<BR>
Each sort of wine to woo the taste,<BR>
And meats of every kind be placed.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spake the hermit sulf-restrained,<BR>
With proper tone by rules ordained,<BR>
On deepest meditation bent,<BR>
In holy might predominent.<BR>
Then as with hands in reverence raised<BR>
Absorbed in thought he eastward gazed,<BR>
The deities be thus addreased<BR>
Came each in semblance manifest.<BR>
Delicious gales that cooled the frame<BR>
From Malaya and Dardar came,<BR>
That kissed those scented hills and threw<BR>
Auspicious fragrance where they blew.<BR>
Then falling fast in sweetest showers<BR>
Came from the sky immortal flowers,<BR>
And all the airy region round<BR>
With heavenly drums was made to sound.<BR>
Then breathed a soft celestial breeze,<BR>
Then danced the bright Apsarases,<BR>
The minstrels and the Gods advanced,<BR>
And warbling lutes the soul entranced.<BR>
The earth and sky that music filled,<BR>
And through each ear it softly thrilled,<BR>
As from the heavenly quills it fell<BR>
With time and tune attempered well.<BR>
Soon as the minstrels ceased to play<BR>
And airs celestial died away.<BR>
The troops of Bharat saw amazed<BR>
What Vis'vakarm&aacute;'s art had raised.<BR>
On every side, five leagues around,<BR>
All smooth and level lay the ground,<BR>
With fresh green grass that charmed the sight<BR>
Like sapphires blent with lazulite.<BR>
There the Wood-apple hung the head,<BR>
The Mango and the Citron glowed<BR>
The Bel and scented Jak were there,<BR>
And Aml&aacute; with fruitage fair.<BR>
There, brought from Northern Kuru, stood<BR>
Rich in delights, the glorious wood,<BR>
And many a stream was seen to glide<BR>

With flowering trees along its side.<BR>
There mansions rose with four wide halls,<BR>
And elephants and chargers' stalls,<BR>
And many a house of royal state,<BR>
Triumphal are and bannered gate.<BR>
With noble doorways, sought the sky,<BR>
Like a pale cloud, a palace high,<BR>
Which far and wide rare fragrance shed,<BR>
With wreaths of white engarlanded.<BR>
Square was its shape, its halls were wide,<BR>
With many a seat and couch supplied,<BR>
Drink of all kinds, and every meat<BR>
Such as celestial Gods might eat.<BR>
Then at the bidding of the seer<BR>
Kaikeyi''s strong-armed son drew near.<BR>
And passed within that fair abode<BR>
Which with the noblest jewels glowed.<BR>
Then, as Vas'ishtha led the way,<BR>
The councillors, in due array.<BR>
Followed delighted and amazed<BR>
And on the glorious structure gazed.<BR>
Then Bharat, Raghu's son, drew near<BR>
The kingly throne, with prince and peer,<BR>
Whereby the chouri in the shade<BR>
Of the white canopy was laid.<BR>
Before the throne he humbly bent<BR>
And honoured R&aacute;ma, reverent,<BR>
Then in his hand the chouri bore,<BR>
And sat where sits a councillor,<BR>
His ministers and household priest<BR>
Sat by degrees from chief to least,<BR>
Then sat the captain of the host<BR>
And all the men he honoured most.<BR>
Then when the saint his order gave,<BR>
Each river with enchanted wave<BR>
Rolled milk and curds divinely sweet<BR>
Before the princely Bharat's feet;<BR>
And dwellings fair on either side,<BR>
With gay white plaster beautified.<BR>
Their heavenly roofs were seen to lift,<BR>
The Bra'hman Bharady'aja's gift,<BR>
Then straight by Lord Kuvera sent,<BR>
Gay with celestial ornament<BR>
Of bright attire and jewels' shine.<BR>
Came twenty thousand nymphs divine:<BR>
The man on whom those beauties glanced<BR>
That moment felt his soul entranced.<BR>
With them from Nandan's blissful shades<BR>
Came twenty thousand heavenly maids.<BR>
Tumburu, Na'rad, Gopa came,<BR>
And Sutanu, like radiant flame.<BR>
The kings of the Gandharva throng,<BR>
And ravished Bharat with their song.<BR>
Then spoke the saint, and swift obeyed<BR>
Alambusb'a, the fairest maid,<BR>
And Mis'rakes'i bright to view,<BR>
Ramana, Pundarik'a too,<BR>
And danced to him with graceful ease<BR>
The dances of Apsarases.<BR>
All deplete that by Gods are worn,<BR>
Or Chaitraratha's graves adorn,<BR>

<P>
Bloomed by the saint's command arrayed<BR>
On branches in Praya'ga's shade.<BR>
When at the saint's command the breeze<BR>
Made music with the Vilva trees,<BR>
To wave in rhythmic beat began<BR>
The boughs of each Myrobolan,<BR>
And holy fig-trees wore the look<BR>
Of dancers, as their leaflets shook.<BR>
The fair Tama'la, palm, and pine,<BR>
With trees that tower and plants that twine,<BR>
The sweetly varying forms displayed<BR>
Of stately dame or bending maid.<BR>
Here men the foaming winecup quaffed,<BR>
Here drank of milk full many a draught,<BR>
And tasted meats of every kind,<BR>
Well dressed, whatever pleased their mind.<BR>
Then beauteous women, seven or eight,<BR>
Stood ready by each man to wait:<BR>
Beside the stream his limbs they stripped<BR>
And in the cooling water dipped.<BR>
And then the fair ones, sparkling eyed,<BR>
With soft hands rubbed his limbs and dried.<BR>
And sitting on the lovely bank<BR>
Held up the winecup as he drank.<BR>
Nor did the grooms forget to feed<BR>
Camel and mule and ox and steed,<BR>
For there were stores of roasted grain,<BR>
Of honey and of sugar-cane.<BR>
So fast the wild excitement spread<BR>
Among the warriors Bharat led,<BR>
That all the mighty army through<BR>
The groom no more his charger knew,<BR>
And he who drove might seek in vain<BR>
To tell his elephant again.<BR>
With every joy and rapture fired,<BR>
Entranced with all the heart desired,<BR>
The myriads of the host that night<BR>
Revelled delirious with delight.<BR>
Urged by the damsels at their side<BR>
In wild delight the warriors cried:<BR>
'Ne'er will we seek Ayodhya', no,<BR>
Nor yet to Dandak forest go:<BR>
Here will we stay: may happy fate<BR>
On Bharat and on R&aacute;ma wait'<BR>
Thus cried the army gay and free<BR>
Exulting in their lawless glee,<BR>
Both infantry and those who rode<BR>
On elephants, or steeds bestrode,<BR>
Ten thousand voices shouting, 'This<BR>
Is heaven indeed for perfect bliss.'<BR>
With garlands decked they idly strayed,<BR>
And danced and laughed and sang and played.<BR>
At length as every soldier eyed,<BR>
With food like Amrit satisfied.<BR>
Bach dainty cate and tempting meat,<BR>
No longer had he care to eat.<BR>
Thus soldier, servant, dame, and slave<BR>
Received whate'er the wish might crave.<BR>
As each in new-wrought clothes arrayed<BR>
Enjoyed the feast before him laid.<BR>

Each man was seen in white attire<BR>
Unstained by spot or speck of mire:<BR>
None was athirst or hungry there,<BR>
And none had dust upon his hair.<BR>
On every side in woody dells<BR>
Was milky food in bubbling wells,<BR>
And there were all-supplying cows<BR>
And honey dropping from the boughs.<BR>
Nor wanted lakes of flower-made drink<BR>
With piles of meat upon the brink,<BR>
boiled, stewed, and roasted, varied cheer,<BR>
Peachick and jungle-fowl and deer,<BR>
There was the flesh of kid and boar,<BR>
And dainty sauce in endless store,<BR>
With juice of flowers concocted well,<BR>
And soup that charmed the taste and smell,<BR>
And pounded fruits of bitter taste,<BR>
And many a bath was ready placed<BR>
Down by each river's shelving side<BR>
There stood great basins well supplied,<BR>
And laid therein, of dazzling sheen,<BR>
White brushes for the teeth were seen,<BR>
And many a covered box wherein<BR>
Was sandal powdered for the skin.<BR>
And mirrors bright with constant care,<BR>
And piles of new attire were there,<BR>
And store of sandals and of shoes,<BR>
Thousands of pairs, for all to choose:<BR>
Eye-unguents, combs for hair and beard,<BR>
Umbrellas fair and bows appeared.<BR>
Lakes gleamed, that lent digestive aid,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="ry170.htm#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And some for pleasant bathing made,<BR>
With waters fair, and smooth incline<BR>
For camels, horses, mules, and kine.<BR>
There saw they barley heaped on high<BR>
The coutless cattle to supply:<BR>
The golden grain shone fair and bright<BR>
As sapphires or the lazulite.<BR>
To all the gathered host it seemed<BR>
As if that magic scene they dreamed,<BR>
And wonder, as they gazed, increased<BR>
At Bharadv&aacute;ja's glorious feast.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus in the hermit's grove they spent<BR>
That night in joy and merriment,<BR>
Blest as the Gods who take their ease<BR>
Under the shade of Nandan's trees.<BR>
Each minstrel bade the saint adieu,<BR>
And to his blissful mansion flew,<BR>
Aiid every stream and heavenly dame<BR>
Ktturned as swiftly as she came.<BR>
