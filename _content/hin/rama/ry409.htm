<P>
Soon as the light of morning broke,<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan from his slumber woke,<BR>
And, duty guiding every thought,<BR>
The palace of his brother sought.<BR>
Vast as a towering hill that shows<BR>
His peaks afar, that palace rose.<BR>
Here stood within the monarch's gate<BR>
Sage nobles skilful in debate.<BR>
There strayed in glittering raiment through<BR>
The courts his royal retinue,<BR>
Where in wild measure rose and fell<BR>
The music of the drum and shell,<BR>
And talk grew loud, and many a dame<BR>
Of fairest feature went and came<BR>
Through doors a marvel to behold,<BR>
With pearl inlaid on burning gold:<BR>
Therein Gandharvas or the fleet<BR>
Lords of the storm might joy to meet.<BR>
He passed within the wondrous pile,<BR>
Chief glory of the giants' isle:<BR>
Thus, ere his fiery course be done,<BR>
An autumn cloud admits the sun.<BR>

<P>
He heard auspicious voices raise<BR>
With loud accord the note of praise,<BR>
And sages, deep in Scripture, sing<BR>
Each glorious triumph of the king.<BR>
He saw the priests in order stand,<BR>
Curd, oil, in every sacred hand;<BR>
And by them flowers were laid and grain,<BR>
Due offerings to the holy train.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan to the monarch bowed,<BR>
Raised on a throne above the crowd:<BR>
Then, skilled in arts of soft address,<BR>
He raised his voice the king to bless,<BR>
And sate him on a seat where he<BR>
Full in his brother's sight should be.<BR>
The chieftain there, while none could hear,<BR>
Spoke his true speech for R&aacute;van's ear,<BR>
And to his words of wisdom lent<BR>
The force of weightiest argument:<BR>
&nbsp; 'O brother, hear! since R&aacute;ma's queen<BR>
A captive in thy house has been,<BR>
Disastrous omens day by day<BR>
Have struck our souls with wild dismay.<BR>
No longer still and strong and clear<BR>
The flames of sacrifice appear,<BR>
But, restless with the frequent spark,<BR>
Neath clouds of smoke grow faint and dark.<BR>
Our ministering priests turn pale<BR>
To see their wonted offerings fail,<BR>
And ants and serpents creep and crawl<BR>
Within the consecrated hall.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_926"></A><A HREF="#fn_926"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Dried are the udders of our cows,<BR>
Our elephants have juiceless brows,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_927"></A><A HREF="#fn_927"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Nor can the sweetest pasture stay<BR>
The charger's long unquiet neigh.<BR>
Big tears from mules and camels flow<BR>
Whose staring coats their trouble show,<BR>
Nor can the leech's art restore<BR>
Their health and vigour as before.<BR>
Rapacious birds are fierce and bold:<BR>
Not single hunters as of old,<BR>
In banded troops they chase the prey,<BR>
Or gathering on our temples stay.<BR>
Through twilight hours with shriek and howl<BR>
Around the city jackals prowl,<BR>
And wolves and foul hyaenas wait<BR>
Athirst for blood at every gate.<BR>
One sole atonement still may cure<BR>
These evils, and our weal assure.<BR>
Restore the Maithil dame, and win<BR>
An easy pardon for thy sin.'<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
The R&aacute;kshas monarch heard, and moved<BR>
To sudden wrath his speech reproved:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'No danger, brother, can I see:<BR>
The Maithil dame I will not free.<BR>
Though all the Gods for R&aacute;ma fight,<BR>
He yields to my superior might.'<BR>
Thus the tremendous king who broke<BR>
The ranks of heavenly warriors spoke,<BR>
And, sternly purposed to resist,<BR>
His brother from the hall dismissed.<BR>

the male elephant's temples, especially at
certain seasons, is frequently spoken of
in Sanskrit poetry. It is said to deceive
and attract the bees, and is regarded as a
sign of health and masculine vigour.</P>
