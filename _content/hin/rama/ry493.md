### CANTO CXXII.: INDRA'S BOON.

Then Indra, he whose fiery stroke  
Slew furious Páka, turned and spoke:  
'A glorious day, O chief, is this,  
Rich with the fruit of lasting bliss.  
Well pleased are we: we love thee well  
Now speak, thy secret wishes tell.'  

Thus spake the sovereign of the sky,  
And this was Ráma's glad reply:  
'If I have won your grace, incline  
To grant this one request of mine.  
Restore, O King: the Vánar dead  
Whose blood for me was nobly shed.  

<span id="page_501">p. 501</span>  

To life and strength my friends recall,  
And bring them back from Yama's hall.  
When, fresh in might the warriors rise,  
Prepare a feast to glad their eyes.  
Let fruits of every season glow,  
And streams of purest water flow.'  
   Thus Raghu's son, great-hearted, prayed,  
And Indra thus his answer made:  
'High is the boon thou seekest: none  
Should win this grace but Raghu's son.  
Yet, faithful to the word I spake,  
I grant the prayer for thy dear sake.  
The Vánars whom the giants slew  
Their life and vigour shall renew.  
Their strength repaired, their gashes healed  
Whose torrents dyed the battle field,  
The warrior hosts from death shall rise \*  
Like sleepers when their slumber flies.'  
   Restored from Yama's dark domain  
The Vánar legions filled the plain,  
And, round the royal chief arrayed,  
With wondering hearts obeisance paid.  
Each God the son of Raghu praised,  
And cried as loud his voice he raised:  
'Turn, King, to fair Ayodhyá speed,  
And leave thy friends of Vánar breed.  
Thy true devoted consort cheer  
After long days of woe and fear.  
Bharat, thy loyal brother, see,  
A hermit now for love of thee.  
The tears of Queen Kaus'alyá dry,  
And light with joy each stepdame's eye;  
Then consecrated king of men  
Make glad each faithful citizen,'  
   They ceased: and borne on radiant cars  
Sought their bright home amid the stars.
