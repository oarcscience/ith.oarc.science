<P>
When mutual courtesies had past,<BR>
Vis'&aacute;l&aacute;'s ruler spoke at last:<BR>
'These princely youths, O Sage, who vie<BR>
In might with children of the sky,<BR>
Heroic, born for happy fate,<BR>
With elephants' or lions' gait,<BR>
Bold as the tiger or the bull,<BR>
With lotus eyes so large and full,<BR>
Armed with the quiver, sword, and bow,<BR>
Whose figures like the As'vins&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> show,<BR>
Like children of the deathless Powers,<BR>
Come freely to these shades of ours,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>--<BR>
How have they reached on foot this place?<BR>
What do they seek, and what their race?<BR>
As sun and moon adorn the sky,<BR>
This spot the heroes glorify.<BR>
Alike in stature, port, and mien,<BR>
The same fair form in each is seen,'<BR>

<P>
He spoke; and at the monarch's call<BR>
The best of hermits told him all,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
How in the grove with him they dwelt,<BR>
And slaughter to the demons dealt.<BR>
Then wonder filled the monarch's breast,<BR>
Who tended well each royal guest.<BR>
Thus entertained, the princely pair<BR>
Remained that night and rested there,<BR>
And with the morn's returning ray<BR>
To Mithil&aacute; pursued their way.<BR>

<P>
When Janak's lovely city first<BR>
Upon their sight, yet distant, burst,<BR>
The hermits all with joyful cries<BR>
Hailed the fair town that met their eyes.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma saw a holy wood,<BR>
Close, in the city's neighbourhood,<BR>
O'ergrown, deserted, marked by age,<BR>
And thus addressed the mighty sage:<BR>
'O reverend lord. I long to know<BR>
What hermit dwelt here long ago.'<BR>
Then to the prince his holy guide,<BR>
Most eloquent of men, replied:<BR>
'O R&aacute;ma, listen while I tell<BR>
Whose was this grove, and what befell<BR>
When in the fury of his rage<BR>
The high saint cursed the hermitage.<BR>
This was the grove--most lovely then--<BR>
Of Gautam, O thou best of men,<BR>
Like heaven itself, most honoured by<BR>
The Gods who dwell above the sky.<BR>
Here with Ahaly&aacute; at his side<BR>
His fervid task the ascetic plied.<BR>
Years fled in thousands. On a day<BR>
It chanced the saint had gone away,<BR>
When Town-destroying Indra came,<BR>
And saw the beauty of the dame.<BR>
The sage's form the God endued,<BR>
And thus the fair Ahaly&aacute; wooed:<BR>
'Love, sweet! should brook no dull delay<BR>
But snatch the moments when he may.'<BR>
She knew him in the saint's disguise,<BR>
Lord Indra of the Thousand Eyes,<BR>
But touched by love's unholy fire,<BR>
She yielded to the God's desire.<BR>

<P>
'Now, Lord of Gods!' she whispered, 'flee,<BR>
From Gautam save thyself and me.'<BR>
Trembling with doubt and wild with dread<BR>
Lord Indra from the cottage fled;<BR>
But fleeing in the grove he met<BR>
The home-returning anchoret,<BR>
Whose wrath the Gods and fiends would shun,<BR>
Such power his fervent rites had won.<BR>
Fresh from the lustral flood he came,<BR>
In splendour like the burning flame,<BR>
With fuel for his sacred rites,<BR>
And grass, the best of eremites.<BR>
The Lord of Gods was sad of cheer<BR>
To see the mighty saint so near,<BR>
And when the holy hermit spied<BR>
In hermit's garb the Thousand-eyed,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
He knew the whole, his fury broke<BR>
Forth on the sinner as he spoke:<BR>

<P>
Because my form thou hast assumed,<BR>
And wrought this folly, thou art doomed,<BR>
For this my curse to thee shall cling,<BR>
Henceforth a sad and sexless thing'<BR>

<P>
No empty threat that sentence came,<BR>
It chilled his soul and marred his frame,<BR>
His might and godlike vigour fled,<BR>
And every nerve was cold and dead.<BR>

<P>
Then on his wife his fury burst.<BR>
And thus the guilty dame he cursed:<BR>
'For countless years, disloyal spouse,<BR>
Devoted to severest vows,<BR>
Thy bed the ashes, air thy food,<BR>
Here shalt thou live in solitude.<BR>
This lonely grove thy home shall be,<BR>
And not an eye thy form shall see.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma, Das'aratha's child,<BR>
Shall seek these shades then drear and wild,<BR>
His coming shall remove thy stain,<BR>
And make the sinner pure again.<BR>
Due honour paid to him, thy guest,<BR>
Shall cleanse thy fond and erring breast,<BR>
Thee to my side in bliss restore,<BR>
And give thy proper shape once more.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="ry049.htm#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Thus to his guiltv wife he said,<BR>
Then far the holy Gautam fled.<BR>
And on Him&aacute;laya's lovely heights<BR>
Spent the long years in sternest rites.'<BR>
