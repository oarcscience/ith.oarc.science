<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXII.: HANUMAN'S COUNSEL.</H3>
<P>
Sugr&iacute;va heard, and, trained and tried<BR>
In counsel, to his lords replied:<BR>
'No deed of mine, no hasty word<BR>
The anger of the prince has stirred.<BR>
But haply some who hate me still<BR>
And watch their time to work me ill,<BR>
Have slandered me to Raghu's son,<BR>
Accused of deeds I ne'er have done.<BR>
Now, O my lords--for you are wise--<BR>
Speak truly what your hearts advise.<BR>
And, pondering each event, inquire<BR>
The reason of the prince's ire.<BR>
No fear have I of Lakshman: none:<BR>
No dread of Raghu's mightier son.<BR>
But wrath, that fires a friendly breast<BR>
Without due cause, distrubs my rest.<BR>
With labour light is friendship gained.<BR>
But with severest toil maintained.<BR>
And doubt is strong, and faith is weak,<BR>

<P>

<P>
And friendship dies when traitors speak.<BR>
Hence is my troubled bosom cold<BR>
With fear of Rama lofty-souled;<BR>
For heavy on my spirit weigh<BR>
His favours I can ne'er repay.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: and Hanuman of all<BR>
The V&aacute;nars in the council hall<BR>
In wisdom first, and rank, expressed<BR>
The thoughts that filled his prudent breast:<BR>
'No marvel thou rememberest yet<BR>
The service thou shouldst ne'er forget,<BR>
How the brave prince of Raghu'a seed<BR>
Thy days from fear and peril freed;<BR>
And B&aacute;li for thy sake o'erthrew,<BR>
Whom Indra's self might scarce subdue.<BR>
I doubt not R&aacute;ma's anger burns<BR>
For the scant love thy heart returns.<BR>
For this he sends his brother, him<BR>
Whose glory never waxes dim.<BR>
Sunk in repose thy careless eye<BR>
Marks not the seasons as they fly,<BR>
Nor sees that autumn has begun<BR>
With dark blooms opening to the sun.<BR>
Clear is the sky no cloudlet mars<BR>
The splendour of the shining stars.<BR>
The balmy air is soft and still,<BR>
And clear and bright are lake and rill.<BR>
Thou heedest not with blinded eyes<BR>
The hour for warlike enterprise.<BR>
Hence Lakshman hither comes to break<BR>
Thy slothful trance and bid thee wake.<BR>
Then, Monarch, with a patient ear<BR>
The high-souled R&aacute;ma's message hear,<BR>
Which, reft of wife and realm and friends,<BR>
Thus by another's mouth he sends.<BR>
Thou, V&aacute;nar King, hast done amiss:<BR>
And now I see no way but this;<BR>
Before his envoy humbly stand<BR>
And sue for peace with suppliant hand.<BR>
High duty bids a courtier seek<BR>
His master's weal, and freely speak.<BR>
So by no thought of fear controlled<BR>
My speech, O King, is free and bold,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma, if his anger glow,<BR>
Can, with the terrors of his bow.<BR>
This earth with all the Gods subdue,<BR>
Gandharvas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_637"></A><A HREF="#fn_637"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the demon crew.<BR>
Unwise to stir his wrathful mood<BR>
Whose favour must again be wooed.<BR>
And, most of all, unwise for one<BR>
Grateful like thee for service done.<BR>
Go with thy son and kinsmen: bend<BR>
Thy humble head and greet thy friend.<BR>
And, like a fond obedient spouse,<BR>
Be faithful to thy plighted vows.<BR>

<P>

in the Bengal recension Gorresio
says: 'The text here makes use of a
strange and something more than bold
metaphor which I have sought to modify.
The text says: "Here is Lakshman the
charioteer of words who by the orders of
Rama has come hither upon the ear
of resolution." In his Italian translation
he renders the passage: "Here is Laksh-
man, the brother of Rama who by his
orders comes hither the determined bearer
of words."</P>
