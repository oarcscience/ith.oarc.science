<P>
Then in sweet accents low and mild<BR>
The V&aacute;nar spoke to Janak's child:<BR>
'A noble king, by sin unstained,<BR>
The mighty Das'aratha reigned.<BR>
Lord of the warrior's car and steed,<BR>
The pride of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's seed.<BR>
A faithful friend, a blameless king.<BR>
Protector of each living thing.<BR>
A glorious monarch, strong to save,<BR>
Blest with the bliss he freely gave,<BR>
His son, the best of all who know<BR>
The science of the bended bow,<BR>
Was moon-bright R&aacute;ma, brave and strong<BR>
Who loved the right and loathed the wrong<BR>
Who ne'er from kingly duty swerved,<BR>
Loved by the lands his might preserved.<BR>
His feet the path of law pursued;<BR>
His arm rebellious foes subdued.<BR>
His sire's command the prince obeyed<BR>
And, banished, sought the forest shade,<BR>
Where with his wife and brother he<BR>
Wandered a saintly devotee.<BR>
There as he roamed the wilds he slew<BR>
The bravest of the R&aacute;kshas crew.<BR>
The giant king the prince beguiled,<BR>
And stole his consort, Janak's child.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma roamed the country round,<BR>
And a firm friend, Sugr&iacute;va, found,<BR>
Lord of the V&aacute;nar race, expelled<BR>
From his own realm which B&aacute;li held,<BR>
He conquered B&aacute;li and restored<BR>
The kingdom to the rightful lord.<BR>
Then by Sugr&iacute;va's high decree<BR>
The V&aacute;narlegions searched for thee,<BR>
Samp&aacute;ti's counsel bade me leap<BR>
A hundred leagues across the deep.<BR>
And now my happy eyes have seen<BR>
At last the long-sought Maithil queen.<BR>
Such was the form, the eye, the grace<BR>
Of her whom R&aacute;ma bade me trace.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: her flowing locks she drew<BR>
To shield her from a stranger's view;<BR>
Then, trembling in her wild surprise,<BR>
Raised to the tree her anxious eyes.<BR>
