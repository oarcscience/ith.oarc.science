### CANTO LXI.: RÁMA'S LAMENT.

As Ráma sought his leafy cot  
Through his left eye keen throbbings shot,  
His wonted strength his frame forsook,  
And all his body reeled aud shook.  
Still on those dreadful signs he thought,  
Sad omens with disaster fraught,  
And from his troubled heart he cried,  
'O, may no ill my spouse betide!'  
He hastened to his dwelling-place,  
Then sinking neath his misery's weight,  
He looked and found it desolate.  
Tossing his mighty arms on high  
He sought her with an eager cry.  
From spot to spot he wildly ran  
Each corner of his home to scan.  
He looked, but Sítá was not there;  
His cot was disolate and bare,  
Like streamlet in the winter frost,  
The glory of her lilies lost.  
With leafy tears the sad trees wept  
As a wild wind their branches swept.  
Mourned bird aud deer, and every flower  
Drooped fainting round the lonely bower.  
The silvan deities had fled  
The spot where all the light was dead,  
Where hermit coats of skin displayed,  
And piles of sacred grass were laid.  
He saw, and maddened by his pain  
Cried in lament again, again:  
'Where is she, dead or torn away.  
Lost, or some hungry giant's prey?  
Or did my darling chance to rove  
For fruit and blossoms though the grove?  
Or has she sought the pool or rill,  
Her pitcher from the wave to fill?'  
His eager eyes on fire with pain  
He roamed about with maddened brain.  
Each grove and glade he searched with care,  
He sought, but found no Sítá there.  
He wildly rushed from hill to hill;  
From tree to tree, from rill to rill.  
As bitter woe his bosom rent  
Still Ráma roamed with fond lament:  
'O sweet Kadamba say has she  
Who loved thy bloom been seen by thee?  
If thou have seen her face most fair,  
Say, gentle tree, I pray thee, where.  
O Bel tree with thy golden fruit  
Round as her breast, no more be mute.  
Where is my radiant darling, gay  
In silk that mocks thy glossy spray?  
O Arjun, say, where is she now  
Who loved to touch thy scented bough?  
Do not thy graceful friend forget,  
But tell me, is she living yet?  
Speak, Basil, thou must surely know,  
For like her limbs thy branches show,--  
Most lovely in thy fair array  
Of twining plant and tender spray.  
Sweet Tila, fairest of the trees,  
Melodious with the hum of bees,  
Where is my darling Sita, tell,--  
The dame who loved thy flowers so well?  
Aœoka, act thy gentle part,--  
Named Heartsease, <span id="fr_508"></span>[1](#fn_508) give me what
thou art,  
To these sad eyes my darling show  
And free me from this load of woe.  
O Palm, in rich ripe fruitage dressed  
Round as the beauties of her breast,  

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>  

If thou have heart to know and feel,  
My peerless consort's fate reveal.  
Hast thou, Rose-apple, chanced to view  
My darling bright with golden hue?  
If thou have seen her quickly speak,  
Where is the dame I wildly seek?  
O glorious Cassia, thou art gay  
With all thy loveliest bloom to-day,  
Where is my dear who loved to hold  
In her full lap thy flowery gold?'  
To many a tree and plant beside,  
To Jasmin, Mango, Sál, he cried.  
'Say, hast thou seen, O gentle deer,  
The fawn-eyed Sítá wandering here?  
It may be that my love has strayed  
To sport with fawns beneath the shade,  
If thou, great elephant, have seen  
My darling of the lovely mien,  
Whose rounded limbs are soft and fine  
As is that lissome trunk of thine,  
O noblest of wild creatures, show  
Where is the dame thou needs must know.  
O tiger, hast thou chanced to see  
My darling? very fair is she.  
Cast all thy fear away, declare,  
Where is my moon-faced darling, where?  
There, darling of the lotus eye,  
I see thee, and 'tis vain to fly.  
Wilt thou not speak, dear love? I see  
Thy form half hidden by the tree.  
Stay if thou love me, Sítá, stay  
In pity cease thy heartless play,  
Why mock me now? thy gentle breast  
Was never prone to cruel jest.  
'Tis vain behind yon bush to steal:  
Thy shimmering silks thy path reveal.  
Fly not, mine eyes pursue thy way;  
For pity's sake, dear Sítá, stay.  
Ah me, ah me, my words are vain;  
My gentle love is lost or slain.  
How could her tender bosom spurn  
Her husband on his home-return?  
Ah no, my love is surely dead,  
Fierce giants on her flesh have fed,  
Rending the soft limbs of their prey  
When I her lord was far away.  
That moon-bright face, that polished brow,  
Red lips, bright teeth--what are they now?  
Alas, my darling's shapely neck  
She loved with chains of gold to deck.--  
That neck that mocked the sandal scent,  
The ruthless fiends have grasped and rent  
Alas, 'twas vain those arms to raise  
Soft as the young tree's tender sprays  
Ah, dainty meal for giants' lips  
Were arms and quivering finger tips.  
Ah, she who counted many a friend  
Was left for fiends to seize and rend,  
Was left by me without defence  
From ravening giants' violence.  
O Lakshman of the arm of might,  

Say, is my darling love in sight;  
O dearest Sítá. where art thou?  
Where is my darling consort now?'  
   Thus as he cried in wild lament  
From grove to grove the mourner went.  
Here for a moment sank to rest.  
Then started up and onward pressed.  
Thus roaming on like one distraught  
Still for his vanished love he sought.  
He searched in wood and hill and glade,  
By rock and brook and wild cascade.  
Through groves with restless step he sped  
And left no spot unvisited.  
Through lawns and woods of vast extent  
Still searching for his love he went  
   With eager steps and fast.  
For many a weary hour he toiled,  
Still in his fond endeavour foiled,  
   Yet hoping to the last.
