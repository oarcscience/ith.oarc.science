<P>
Then, all his thoughts on S&iacute;t&aacute; bent,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chieftain made lament:<BR>
'The queen to R&aacute;ma's soul endeared,<BR>
By Lakshman's pious heart revered,<BR>
Lies here,--for none may strive with Fate,<BR>
A captive, sad and desolate.<BR>
The brothers' might full well she knows,<BR>
And bravely bears the storm of woes,<BR>
As swelling Gang&aacute; in the rains<BR>
The rush of every flood sustains.<BR>
Her lord, for her, fierce B&aacute;li slew,<BR>
Vir&aacute;dha's monstrous might o'erthrew,<BR>
For her the fourteen thousand slain<BR>
In Janasth&aacute;n bedewed the plain.<BR>
And if for her Ikshv&aacute;ku's son<BR>
Destroyed the world 'twere nobly done.<BR>
This, this is she, so far renowned,<BR>
Who sprang from out the furrowed ground, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_827"></A><A HREF="#fn_827"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Child of the high-souled king whose sway<BR>
The men of Mithil&aacute; obey;<BR>
The glorious lady wooed and won<BR>
By Das'aratha's noblest son;<BR>
And now these sad eyes look on her<BR>
Mid hostile fiends a prisoner.<BR>
From home and every bliss she fled<BR>
By wifely love and duty led,<BR>
And heedless of a wanderer's woes,<BR>
A life in lonely forests chose.<BR>
This, this is she so fair of mould.<BR>
Whose limbs are bright as burnished gold.<BR>

<P>
Whose voice was ever soft and mild.<BR>
Who sweetly spoke and sweetly smiled.<BR>
O, what is R&aacute;ma's misery! how<BR>
He longs to see his darling now!<BR>
Pining for one of her fond looks<BR>
As one athirst for water brooks.<BR>
Absorbed in woe the lady sees<BR>
No R&aacute;kshas guard, no blooming trees.<BR>
Her eyes are with her thoughts, and they<BR>
Are fixed on R&aacute;ma far away.'<BR>
