<P>
Again the V&aacute;nar chief replied,<BR>
With her wise answer satisfied:<BR>
'Well hast thou said: thou canst not brave<BR>
The rushing wind, the roaring wave.<BR>
Thy woman's heart would sink with fear<BR>
Before the ocean shore were near.<BR>
And for thy dread lest limb of thine<BR>
Should for a while be touched by mine,<BR>
The modest fear is worthy one<BR>
Whose cherished lord is Raghu's son.<BR>
Yet when I sought to bear thee hence<BR>
I spoke the words of innocence,<BR>
Impelled to set the captive free<BR>
By friendship for thy lord and thee.<BR>
But if with me thou wilt not try<BR>
The passage of the windy sky,<BR>

<P>

<P>
Give me a gem that I may show,<BR>
Some token which thy lord may know.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Again the Maithil lady spoke,<BR>
While tears and sobs her utterance broke:<BR>
'The surest of all signs is this,<BR>
To tell the tale of vanished bliss.<BR>
Thus in my name to R&aacute;ma speak:<BR>
'Remember Chitrak&uacute;ta's peak.<BR>
And the green margin of the rill &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_873"></A><A HREF="#fn_873"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
That flows beside that pleasant hill,<BR>
Where thou and I together strayed<BR>
Delighting in the tangled shade.<BR>
There on the grass I sat with thee<BR>
And laid my head upon thy knee.<BR>
There came a greedy crow and pecked<BR>
The meat I waitd to protect<BR>
And, heedless of the clods I threw,<BR>
About my head in circles flew,<BR>
Until by darling hunger pressed<BR>
He boldly pecked me on the breast.<BR>
I ran to thee in rage and grief<BR>
And prayed for vengeance on the thief.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_874"></A><A HREF="#fn_874"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> from his slumber rose<BR>
And smiled with pity at my woes.<BR>
Upon my bleeding breast he saw<BR>
The scratches made by beak and claw.<BR>
He laid an arrow on his bow.<BR>
And launched it at the shameless crow.<BR>
That shaft, with magic power endued,<BR>
The bird, where'er he flew, pursued,<BR>
Till back to Raghu's son he fled<BR>
And bent at R&aacute;ma's feet his head.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_875"></A><A HREF="#fn_875"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>
Couldst thou for me with anger stirred<BR>
Launch that dire shaft upon a bird,<BR>
And yet canst pardon him who stole<BR>
The darling of thy heart and soul?<BR>
Rise up, O bravest of the brave.<BR>
And come in all thy might to save.<BR>
Come with the thunders of thy bow,<BR>
And smite to earth the Rakshas foe.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She ceased; and from her glorious hair<BR>
She took a gem that sparkled there<BR>
A token which her husband's eyes<BR>
With eager love would recognize.<BR>
His head the V&aacute;nar envoy bent<BR>
In low obeisance reverent.<BR>
And on his finger bound the gem<BR>
She loosened from her diadem.<BR>
