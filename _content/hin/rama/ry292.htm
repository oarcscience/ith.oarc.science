<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XVIII.: R&Aacute;MA'S REPLY.</H3>
<P>
He ceased: and R&aacute;ma's heart was stirred<BR>
At every keen reproach he heard.<BR>
There B&aacute;li lay, a dim dark sun,<BR>
His course of light and glory run;<BR>
Or like the bed of Ocean dried<BR>
Of his broad floods from side to side,<BR>
Or helpless, as the dying fire,<BR>
Hushed his last words of righteous ire.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, with his spirit moved,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar king in turn reproved:<BR>
'Why dost thou B&aacute;li, thus revile,<BR>
And castest not a glance the while<BR>
On claims of duty, love, and gain,<BR>
And customs o'er the world that reign?<BR>
Why dost thou blame me, rash and blind,<BR>
Fickle as all thy V&aacute;nar kind.<BR>
Slighting each rule of ancient days<BR>
Which all the good and prudent praise?<BR>
This land, each hill and woody chase,<BR>
Belongs to old Ikshv&aacute;ku's race:<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
With bird and beast and man, the whole<BR>
Is ours to cherish and control.<BR>
Now Bharat, prompt at duty's call,<BR>
Wise, just, and true, is lord of all.<BR>
Each claim of law, love, gain he knows,<BR>
And wrath and favour duly shows.<BR>
A king from truth who never bends,<BR>
And grace with vigour wisely blends;<BR>
With valour worthy of his race,<BR>
He knows the claims of time and place,<BR>
Now we and other kings of might,<BR>
By his ensample taught aright,<BR>
The lands of every region tread<BR>
That justice may increase and spread.<BR>
While royal Bharat, wise and just,<BR>
Rules the broad earth, his glorious trust,<BR>
Who shall attempt, while he is lord,<BR>
A deed by Justice held abhorred?<BR>
We now, as Bharat has decreed,<BR>
Let justice guide our every deed,<BR>
And toil each sinner to repress<BR>
Who scorns the way of righteousness.<BR>
Thou from that path hast turned aside,<BR>
And virtue's holy law defied.<BR>
Left the fair path which kings should tread,<BR>
And followed pleasure's voice instead.<BR>
The man who cleaves to duty's law<BR>
Regards these three with filial awe--<BR>
The sire, the elder brother, third<BR>
Him from whose lips his lore he heard.<BR>
Thus too, for duty's sake, the wise<BR>
Regard with fond paternal eyes<BR>
The well-loved younger brother, one<BR>
Their lore has ripened, and a son.<BR>
Fine are the laws which guide the good,<BR>
Abstruse, and hardly understood;<BR>
Only the soul, enthroned within<BR>
The breast of each, knows right from sin<BR>
But thou art wild and weak of soul,<BR>
And spurnest, like thy race, control;<BR>
The true and right thou canst not find.<BR>
Tht blind consulting with the blind.<BR>
Incline thine ear and I will teach<BR>
The cause that prompts my present speech<BR>
This tempest of thy soul assuage<BR>
Nor blame me in thine idle rage.<BR>
On this great sin thy thoughts bestow,<BR>
The sin for which I lay thee low.<BR>
Thou, B&aacute;li, in thy brother's life<BR>
Hast robbed him of his wedded wife,<BR>
And keepest, scorning ancient right,<BR>
His Rum&aacute; for thine own delight.<BR>
Thy son's own wife should scarcely be<BR>
More sacred in thine eyes than she.<BR>
All duty thou hast scorned, and hence<BR>
Comes punishment for dire offence.<BR>
For those who blindly do amiss<BR>
There is, I ween, no way but this:<BR>
To check the rash who dare to stray<BR>
From custom which the good obey,<BR>
I may not, sprung of Kshatriya line,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_347"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 347</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Forgive this heinous sin of thine:<BR>
The laws for those who sin like thee<BR>
The penalty of death decree.<BR>
Now Bharat rules with sovereign sway,<BR>
And we his royal word obey.<BR>
Tnere was no hope of pardon, none,<BR>
For the vile deed that thou hast done,<BR>
That wisest monarch dooms to die<BR>
The wretch whose crimes the law defy;<BR>
And we, chastising those who err,<BR>
His righteous doom administer.<BR>
Mv soul accounts Sugr&iacute;va dear<BR>
E'en as my brother Lakshman here.<BR>
He brings me blessing, and I swore<BR>
his wife and kingdom to restore:<BR>
A bond in solemn honour bound<BR>
When V&aacute;nar chieftains stood around.<BR>
And can a king like me forsake<BR>
His friend, and plighted promise break?<BR>
Reflect, O V&aacute;nar, on the cause,<BR>
The sanction of eternal laws,<BR>
And, justly smitten down, confess<BR>
Thou diest for thy wickediness,<BR>
By honour was I bound to lend<BR>
Assistance to a faithful friend;<BR>
And thou hast met a righteous fate<BR>
Thy former sins to expiate.<BR>
And thus wilt thou some merit win<BR>
And make atonement for thy sin.<BR>
For hear me, V&aacute;nar King, rehearse<BR>
What Manu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> spake in ancient verse,--<BR>
This holy law, which all accept<BR>
Who honour duty, have I kept:<BR>
'Pure grow the sinners kings chastise,<BR>
And, like.the virtuous, gain the skies;<BR>
By pain or full atonement freed,<BR>
They reap the fruit of righteous deed,<BR>
While kings who punish not incur<BR>
The penalties of those who err.'<BR>
M&aacute;ndh&aacute;t&aacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> once, a noble king,<BR>
Light of the line from which I spring,<BR>
Punished with death a devotee<BR>
When he had stooped to sin like thee;<BR>
And many a king in ancient time<BR>
Has punished frantic sinners' crime,<BR>
And, when their impious blood was spilt,<BR>
Has washed away the stain of guilt.<BR>
Cease, B&aacute;li, cease; no more complain:<BR>
Reproaches and laments are vain.<BR>
For thou art justly punished: we<BR>
Obey our king and are not free.<BR>
Once more, O B&aacute;li, lend thine ear<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Another weightiest plea to hear.<BR>
For this, when heard and pondered well.<BR>
Will all complaint and rage dispel.<BR>
My soul will ne'er this deed repent,<BR>
Nor was my shaft in anger sent.<BR>
We take the silvan tribes beset<BR>
With snare and trap and gin and net,<BR>
And many a heedless deer we smite<BR>
From thickest shade, concealed from sight.<BR>
Wild for the slaughter of the game,<BR>
At stately stags our shafts we aim.<BR>
We strike them bounding scared away,<BR>
We strike them as they stand at bay,<BR>
When careless in the shade they lie,<BR>
Or scan the plain with watchful eye.<BR>
They turn away their heads; we aim,<BR>
And none the eager hunter blame.<BR>
Each royal saint, well trained in law<BR>
Of duty, loves his bow to draw<BR>
And strike the quarry, e'en as thou<BR>
Hast fallen by mine arrow now,<BR>
Fiphting with him or unaware,--<BR>
A V&aacute;nar thou.--I little care.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_600"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
But yet, O best of V&aacute;nars, know<BR>
That kings who rule the earth bestow<BR>
Fruit of pure life and virtuous deed.<BR>
And lofty duty's hard-won meed.<BR>
Harm not thy lord the king: abstain<BR>
From ant and word that cause him pain;<BR>
For kings are children of the skies<BR>
Who walk this earth in men's disguise.<BR>
But thou, in duty's claims untaught,<BR>
thy breast with blinding passion fraught,<BR>
Assailest me who still have clung<BR>
To duty, with thy bitter tongue.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased; and Ball sore distressed<BR>
The sovereign claims of law confessed,<BR>
And freed, o'erwhelmed with woe and shame,<BR>
The lord of Raghu's race from blame.<BR>
Then, reverent palm to palm applied,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma thus the V&aacute;nar cried:<BR>
'True, best of men, is every word<BR>
That from thy lips these ears have heard,<BR>
It ill beseems a wretch like me<BR>
To bandy empty words with thee.<BR>
Forgive the angry taunts that broke<BR>
From my wild bosom as I spoke.<BR>
And lay not to my charge, O King,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_348"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 348</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
My mad reproaches' idle sting.<BR>
Thou, in the truth by trial trained,<BR>
Best knowledge of the right hast gained:<BR>
And layest, just and pure within,<BR>
The meetest penalty on sin.<BR>
Through every bond of law I burst,<BR>
The boldest sinner and the worst.<BR>
O let thy right-instructing speech<BR>
Console my heart and wisely teach.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like some sad elephant who stands<BR>
Fast sinking in the treacherous sands,<BR>
Thus B&aacute;li raised despairing eyes;<BR>
Then spake again with sobs and sighs:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Not for myself, O King, I grieve,<BR>
For T&aacute;r&aacute; or the friends I leave,<BR>
As for sweet Angad, my dear son,<BR>
My noble, only little one.<BR>
For, nursed in luxury and bliss,<BR>
His father he will mourn and miss,<BR>
And like a stream whose fount is dry<BR>
Will waste away and sink and die,--<BR>
My own dear child, my only boy,<BR>
His mother T&aacute;r&aacute;'s hope and joy.<BR>
Spare him, O son of Raghu, spare<BR>
The child entrusted to thy care.<BR>
My Angad and Sugr&iacute;va treat<BR>
E'en as thy heart considers meet,<BR>
For thou, O chief of men, art strong<BR>
To guard the right and punish wrong.<BR>
O, if thou wilt thine ear incline<BR>
To hear these dying words of mine,<BR>
He and Sugr&iacute;va will to thee<BR>
As Bharat and as Lakshman be.<BR>
Let not my T&aacute;r&aacute;, left forlorn,<BR>
Weep for Sugr&iacute;va's wrathful scorn;<BR>
Nor let him, for her lord's offence,<BR>
Condemn her faithful innocence.<BR>
And well and wisely may he reign<BR>
If thy dear grace his power sustain:<BR>
If, following thee his friend and guide,<BR>
He turn not from thy hest aside:<BR>
Thus may he reign with glory, nay<BR>
Thus to the skies will win his way.<BR>
Though stayed by T&aacute;r&aacute;'s fond recall,<BR>
By thy dear hand I longed to fall.<BR>
Against my brother rushed and fought,<BR>
And gained the death I long have sought.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma thus the prince consoled<BR>
From whose clear eyes the mists were rolled:<BR>
'Grieve not for those thou leavest thus,<BR>
Nor tremble for thyself or us,<BR>
For we will deal with thine and thee<BR>
As duty and the laws decree.<BR>
He who exacts and he who pays,<BR>
Is justly slain or justly slays,<BR>
Shall in the life to come have bliss;<BR>
For each has done his task in this.<BR>
Thou, wandering from the right, art made<BR>
Pure by the forfeit thou hast paid.<BR>
Thy weight of sins is cast aside,<BR>
And duty's claim is satisfied.<BR>
Then grieve no more, O Prince, but clear<BR>
Thy bosom from all doubt and fear,<BR>
For fate, inexorably stern,<BR>
Thou hast no power to move or turn.<BR>
Thy princely Angad still will share<BR>
My tender love. Sugr&iacute;va's care;<BR>
And to thy offspring shall be shown<BR>
Affection that shall match thine own.'<BR>
