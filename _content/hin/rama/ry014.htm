<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XII.: THE SACRIFICE BEGUN.</H3>
<P>
Again the spring with genial heat<BR>
Returning made the year complete.<BR>
To win him sons, without delay<BR>
His vow the king resolved to pay:<BR>
And to Vas'ishtha, saintly man,<BR>
In modest words this speech began:<BR>
'Prepare the rite with all things fit<BR>
As is ordained in Holy Writ,<BR>
And keep with utmost care afar<BR>
Whate'er its sacred forms might mar.<BR>
Thou art, my lord, my trustiest guide,<BR>
Kind-hearted, and my friend beside;<BR>
So is it meet thou undertake<BR>
This heavy task for duty's sake.'<BR>

<P>
Then he, of twice-born men the best,<BR>
His glad assent at once expressed:<BR>
'Fain will I do whate'er may be<BR>
Desired, O honoured King, by thee.'<BR>
To ancient priests he spoke, who, trained<BR>
In holy rites, deep skill had gained:<BR>
'Here guards be stationed, good and sage<BR>
Religious men of trusted age.<BR>
And various workmen send and call,<BR>
Who frame the door and build the wall:<BR>
With men of every art and trade,<BR>
Who read the stars and ply the spade,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And mimes and minstrels hither bring,<BR>
And damsels trained to dance and sing.'<BR>

<P>
Then to the learned men he said,<BR>
In many a page of Scripture read:<BR>
'Be yours each rite performed to see<BR>
According to the king's decree.<BR>
And stranger Br&aacute;hmans quickly call<BR>
To this great rite that welcomes all.<BR>
Pavilions for the princes, decked<BR>
With art and ornament, erect,<BR>
And handsome booths by thousands made<BR>
The Br&aacute;hman visitors to shade,<BR>
Arranged in order side by side,<BR>
With meat and drink and all supplied.<BR>
And ample stables we shall need<BR>
For many an elephant and steed:<BR>
And chambers where the men may lie,<BR>
And vast apartments, broad and high,<BR>
Fit to receive the countless bands<BR>
Of warriors come from distant lands.<BR>
For our own people too provide<BR>
Sufficient tents, extended wide,<BR>
And stores of meat and drink prepare,<BR>
And all that can be needed there.<BR>
And food in plenty must be found<BR>
For guests from all the country round.<BR>
Of various viands presents make,<BR>
For honour, not for pity's sake,<BR>
That fit regard and worship be<BR>
Paid to each caste in due degree.<BR>
And let not wish or wrath excite<BR>
Your hearts the meanest guest to slight;<BR>
But still observe with special grace<BR>
Those who obtain the foremost place,<BR>
Whether for happier skill in art<BR>
Or bearing in the rite their part.<BR>
Do you, I pray, with friendly mind<BR>
Perform the task to you assigned,<BR>
And work the rite, as bids the law,<BR>
Without omission, slip, or flaw'<BR>

<P>
They answered: 'As thou seest fit<BR>
So will we do and naught omit.'<BR>
The sage Vas'ishtha then addressed<BR>
Sumantra called at his behest:<BR>
'The princes of the earth invite,<BR>
And famous lords who guard the rite,<BR>
Priest, Warrior, Merchant, lowly thrall,<BR>
In countless thousands summon all.<BR>
Where'er their home be, far or near,<BR>
Gather the good with honour here,<BR>
And Janak, whose imperial sway<BR>
The men of M&iacute;thil&aacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> obey.<BR>
The firm of vow, the dread of foes,<BR>
Who all the lore of Scripture knows,<BR>


<P>


<P>
Invite him here with honour high,<BR>
King Das'aratha's old ally.<BR>
And K&aacute;s'i's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> lord of gentle speech,<BR>
Who finds a pleasant word for each,<BR>
In length of days our monarch's peer,<BR>
Illustrious king, invite him here.<BR>
The father of our ruler's bride,<BR>
Known for his virtues far and wide,<BR>
The king whom Kekaya's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> realms obey,<BR>
Him with his son invite, I pray.<BR>
And Lomap&aacute;d the Angas' king,<BR>
True to his vows and godlike, bring.<BR>
For be thine invitations sent<BR>
To west and south and orient.<BR>
Call those who rule Sur&aacute;shtra's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> land,<BR>
Suv&iacute;ra's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A> realm and Sindhu's strand,<BR>
And all the kings of earth beside<BR>
In friendship's bonds with us allied:<BR>
Invite them all to hasten in<BR>
With retinue and kith and kin.'<BR>

<P>
Vas'ishtha's speech without delay<BR>
Sumantra bent him to obey.<BR>
And sent his trusty envoys forth<BR>
Eastward and westward, south and north.<BR>
Obedient to the saint's request<BR>
Himself he hurried forth, and pressed<BR>
Each nobler chief and lord and king<BR>
To hasten to the gathering.<BR>
Before the saint Vas'ishtha stood<BR>
All those who wrought with stone and wood,<BR>
And showed the work which every one<BR>
In furtherance of the rite had done,<BR>
Rejoiced their ready zeal to see,<BR>
Thus to the craftsmen all said he:<BR>
'I charge ye, masters, see to this,<BR>
That there be nothing done amiss,<BR>
And this, I pray, in mind be borne,<BR>
That not one gift ye give in scorn:<BR>
Whenever scorn a gift attends<BR>
Great sin is his who thus offends.'<BR>

<P>
And now some days and nights had past,<BR>
And kings began to gather fast,<BR>
And precious gems in liberal store<BR>
As gifts to Das'aratha bore.<BR>
Then joy thrilled through Vas'ishtha's breast<BR>
As thus the monarch he addressed:<BR>
'Obedient to thy high decree<BR>
The kings, my lord, are come to thee.<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And it has been my care to greet<BR>
And honour all with reverence meet.<BR>
Thy servants' task is ended quite,<BR>
And all is ready for the rite.<BR>
Come forth then to the sacred ground<BR>
Where all in order will be found.'<BR>
Then Rishyas'ring confirmed the tale:<BR>
Nor did their words to move him fail.<BR>
The stars propitious influence lent<BR>
When forth the world's great ruler went.<BR>

<P>
Then by the sage Vas'ishtha led<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The priest begun to speed<BR>
Those glorious rites wherein is shed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The lifeblood of the steed.<BR>
