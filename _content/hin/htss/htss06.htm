<p align="center">(Sanskrit form M&#256;&#7750;IKYA V&#256;CHAKA)</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> the days when the powerful P&#257;ndyan Kings flourished in Madura, there was once a prime minister who early became convinced of the transitoriness of this world's life and its riches. When on a visit to Perundurai, now &#256;vudaiy&#257;rkoil in the Tanjore District, he suddenly and completely came under the influence of a Brahman religious teacher, who for him was the manifestation of the very God Himself. Then and there he began to sing the "Sacred Utterance" (Tiruv&#257;saham), and was named by his preceptor "Utterer of Jewels" (M&#257;&#7751;ikka V&#257;sahar). Returning to Madura, he forsook his high office with all its rewards, to become a religious poet wandering without earthly attachments from shrine to shrine. The stories clustering around his religious experience can be read by English readers in Dr. Pope's great edition of his work. We find him practising austerities at Chidambaram, or miraculously giving the gift of speech to the dumb daughter of the Ch&#333;l&#804;a king, or defeating in disputation a band of Buddhists from Ceylon, but of certain historical information about him we have practically none. Even the question of the century in which he lived is a battleground of the antiquarians. Tradition places him in the fifth century, earlier than the writers of the D&#275;v&#257;ram;</p>  
<p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></A></p>  
<p>but the opinion of scholars seems to be converging on the view that he lived in the latter half of the ninth, or the first half of the tenth century of our era. Another of his works is the Tirukk&#333;vaiy&#257;r, an erotic poem of four hundred stanzas. Among Tamil S&#769;aivite writers none makes a stronger devotional appeal than M&#257;&#7751;ikka V&#257;sahar. There is a common Tamil saying that nothing can melt the heart of the man who is not melted by the Tiruv&#257;saham.</p>

<p>Stanzas 80-92 are samples from an opening poem of one hundred stanzas, each ten of which has its own metre and is fairly complete in itself. They fairly reflect the saint's varying moods. Notice the importance he attaches to emotion; his worst self-reproach is for feeling no frenzy. As to his conception of God, see how the word 'grace' recurs in nearly every stanza. And yet that God of grace is called (in No. 84) both being and non-existence.</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Hundred Verses</span></h5>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">80. Thrills and trembles my frame;<br> Hands are lifted on high;<br> Here at Thy fragrant feet,<br> Sobbing and weeping I cry;<br> Falsehood forsaking, I shout,<br> "Victory, victory, praise!<br> Lord of my life, these clasped hands<br> Worship shall bring Thee always.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">81. Indra or Vish&#7751;u or Brahm,<br> Their divine bliss crave not I;<br> I seek the love of Thy saints,<br> Though my house perish thereby.<br> To the worst hell I will go,<br> So but Thy grace be with me.<br> Best of all, how could my heart<br> Think of a god beside Thee?</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">82. Though like Thy saints I seem, &#8217;tis but the acting of a part.<br> Yet wondrous swift I run to reach the heaven where Thou art.<br> O hill of gold and precious gems, grant in Thy grace to me<br> A heart to melt, lord of my life, in ceaseless love to Thee.</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">83. I have no fear of births, but quake at thought that I must die.<br> E&#8217;en heav&#8217;n to me were naught; for earth's whole empire what care I?<br> O S&#769;iva wreathed with honeyed blossoms, "When shall come the morn<br> When Thou wilt grant Thy grace to me?" I cry with anguish torn.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">84. The sky, earth, wind, the light, our very flesh and life art Thou,<br> Being art Thou, non-being too, Thou king, who see&#8217;st how<br> Men dance like puppets with their foolish thoughts of 'I' and 'Mine,'<br> While Thou the cords dost pull. What words can tell Thy praise divine?</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">85. At sound of cries like this, "O Bull-rider whose spreading hair<br> The falling stream receives! "Heaven's Lord," true devotees there were,<br> Whose love-thrilled heart broke forth, like stopped-up rivers rushing down.<br> Yet Thou didst choose no one of them, but me to be Thine own.<br> And yet my body will not turn from heel to head one heart<br> To melt in love for Thee, one eye to shed the tears that smart<br> In swelling floods. Ah! wretched that I am, who only moan!<br> My two eyes are unfeeling wood, my heart a great dead stone!</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">86. Amid the fruits of deeds I lay. Thou didst thyself reveal<br> With words of comfort saying "Come, I will destruction deal<br> To evil fruit of deeds," and thus thou mad&#8217;st me all Thy slave.<br> And yet I stand as if a statue made of steel, nor rave,<br> Nor sing, nor cry, nor wail&#8212;woe's me&#8212;nor in my spirit faint<br> With deep desire, so dull am I. O being ancient,<br> Thou art beginning, Thou art end: tell me, how can I be<br> So dead at heart? The end if this I do not dare to see.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">87. Him though men seek, none fully know; in Him no evil is.<br> None are His kindred; knowledge perfect, effortless is His.<br> A cur am I, yet He hath giv&#8217;n to me in sight of men<br> A place on earth, and shewed me things far beyond mortal ken.<br> He told me what no ears can hear; from future births He sav&#8217;d.<br> Such magic wrought my Lord who me hath lovingly enslaved.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">88. Our God of gods, whom e&#8217;en the devas&#8217; king knows but in part,<br> Ruleth the three who in the fair world-gardens life impart,<br> And life maintain, and life destroy; our First, Reality,<br> Father of old, whose consort Um&#257; is, our sovereign, He <a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="green">p. 94</font></A> <a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="green">p. 95</font></A><br> Came down in grace and made e&#8217;en me to be His very own.<br> Henceforth before no man I bow; I fear but Him alone.<br> Now of His servants&#8217; servants I have joined the sacred throng,<br> And ever more and more I'll bathe in bliss. with dance and song.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">89. The meanest cur am I; I know not how to do the right;<br> &#8217;Twere but what I deserve, should&#8217;st Thou my wickedness requite<br> With the dread fate of those who never saw Thy flowery feet;<br> For though mine eyes have seen, my ears have heard saints guileless, meet,<br> Who reached Thy fragrant presence, yet I stay, for false am I,<br> Fit for naught save to eat and dress, Lion of victory.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">90. None but myself has sunk myself. Thy name be ever praised!<br> No blame lay I on Thee, lauds to my Master be upraised!<br> Yet to forgive is aye a mark of greatness. Praise to Thee!<br> Lord of the land celestial, Praise! O end this life for me.</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">91. The fawn-eyed maid is part of Thee! From holy writ Thou&#8217;rt hid!<br> Thou&#8217;rt honey, yea ambrosia, by man's mind not compass&egrave;d.<br> O king who bearest with my faults, some harsh words did I say.<br> Thy saints have entered heaven. Without, falsehood and I still stay.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">92. Since I am false, and false my heart, and false my very love,<br> Howe&#8217;er I weep, still held by deed can I reach Thee above?<br> O honey, nectar, O essential sweetness, great as sweet,<br> Grant grace to me to find the path that leads unto Thy feet.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">93. Heav&#8217;n, earth, and all that therein is, thou makest without seed.<br> Thou dost preserve and Thou destroy. &#8217;Tis Thou who hast decreed<br> That I though treacherous, mean, should be a man who frenzied faints<br> Before Thy temple gates, one with the band of Thy true saints.<br> What men themselves have planted, e&#8217;en a poisonous mango tree,<br> They root not up. O Lord of mine, as such a tree keep me.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Our next five stanzas, taken from a hymn of fifty, are full of the pathos expressed in the title, which is a refrain recurring in every verse. Only flashes of the light of the presence of God pierce the prevailing gloom. The saint cannot free himself from sensuality,</p>  
<p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></A> <a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></A></p>  
<p>even while he hates it. He wonders whether even the God who drank poison for others&#8217; sake will leave him alone.</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wilt Thou Leave Me?</span></h5>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">94. Mingling in grace with me, O rider of the bull, Thou mad&#8217;st me Thine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But wilt Thou leave me? Thou whose form in the fierce tiger's skin is clad,<br> Uttarak&#333;sama&#7749;gai old has Thee for king. O lord of mine<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With matted hair, hold Thou me up; for I am weary grown and sad.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">95. Set in the marge of flowing stream that eats its banks away, the tree<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes to its fall; and thus am I, my sense bewitch&#8217;d by maids&#8217; dark eyes.<br> Uttarak&#333;sama&#7749;gai's king, spouse of gem-vested P&#257;rvati,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who dwell'st in &#256;r&#363;r holy, O protector, for my help arise.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">96. In ignorance I spurned thy grace. Dost Thou, my gem, now me despise,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And wilt thou leave me? O destroy my sum of deeds and make me thine.<br> Uttarak&#333;sama&#7749;gai's king, &#8217;tis surely true, the great and wise,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When only little curs play false, to mercy ever will incline.</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">97. With none to cheer me from my fear, far have I wandered wearily,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;O Lightning-like, and wilt Thou leave me? If I truly thee compare,<br> Uttarak&#333;sama&#7749;gai's king, I find naught else resembling Thee;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But a true father, mother dear art Thou to me, my treasure rare.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">98. Whether I praise or curse Thee, still I'm stained with sin and sorrowing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, wilt Thou leave me? Splendour shining like the red-hued coral mount,<br> Master, thou drankest poison black, the humbler beings pitying,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That I, Thy meanest one, might find no poison, but a nectar fount.</div></p>

<p>Our poet made songs which maidens might sing in their rhythmical games, or as they sat at the grinding-stone. In India the boatman sings as he rows, the ryot sings as he draws from the well, the sepoy sings on his march. A feature of such songs is the refrain, which is usually a mere collection of euphonic syllables, though it may have a meaning. Here are specimens of a few songs intended for women. The refrain of the first, "&#274;l&#333;remb&#257;v&#257;y" probably means "Receive and ponder what I say, O lady." The Grinding song, strangely enough, is used at funerals, as also is the 'Antiphony.' The song of 'The Three Castles&#8217; Destruction' is supposed to accompany play with a ball or a kind of shuttle called 'und&#299;.' For the legend of the Three Castles, see page <A HREF="htss02.htm#page_7">7</A>. 'The Shoulder-Play' is for some ancient game in which women grasped each other's shoulders.</p>

<p>In the poetry of all lands lovers have appealed to birds to be their messengers to the distant loved one. This is so common in Indian poetry as to have become a recognised convention. Here the saint sends his message of love and devotion, in one case by a humming bee, in the other by the Indian cuckoo, to S&#769;iva who dwells in Tillai, i.e. Chidambaram.</p>  
<p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></A> <a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Bee's Message</span></h5>

<p>One of the little childishnesses involved in idolatry is that every morning with solemn ceremony the idol must be wakened from his sleep, bathed, and dressed. Here is a song with which he is roused from slumber. But notice how successfully our author has filled his poem with the fresh morning feeling, and the sights and sounds of the sudden break of the Indian dawn.</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Idol's Awakening</span></h5>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">115.
