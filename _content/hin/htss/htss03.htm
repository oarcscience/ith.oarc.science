<p align="center">(Tamil: TIRU J&Ntilde;&#256;NA SAMBANDAM&#362;RTI SW&#256;M&#298;)</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> the first half of the seventh century A.D. the worship of S&#769;iva Was at its lowest ebb, overpowered by the Jainism and Buddhism which prevailed throughout the Tamil country. But a few pious S&#769;aivites remained faithful. One of them, whose name means that his heart was laid at S&#769;iva's foot, and who lived in the town in the Tanjore District now known as Shiy&#257;li, prayed to the S&#769;iva worshipped in the Shiy&#257;li temple that he might be given a son who would dispel the godless dark and win men to Lord S&#769;iva again. Sambandar's birth was the answer to that prayer. At the tender age of three, so orthodox S&#769;aivites believe, this child was fed by Sivas spouse with milk from her divine breast, mingled with divine wisdom, whence he is called in his full name, "The man connected with wisdom divine," Tiru J&ntilde;&#257;na Sambandar.</p>  
<p>He grew up to be a pilgrim poet, who visited most of the S&#769;aivite shrines with which South India abounds, in each place singing the praise of the S&#769;iva whom there he worshipped. The cause he loved suffered a severe blow when the great king of Madura, with many of his subjects, went over to the Jain religion. The queen-consort and her prime minister (see stanzas 20 and 21) remained faithful to S&#769;aivism, and sent for Sambandar.</p>  
<p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The lonely saint faced a vast multitude of Jains in the royal presence, conquered them in argument, and reconverted the king. Eight thousand of the stubborn Jains, with Sambandar's consent, were impaled alive. Later on, after a similar adventure in another of the three great kingdoms of the Tamil country of his time, Sambandar converted to S&#769;aivism a crowd of Buddhist opponents.</p>  
<p>This is about all that is known of a man who helped to sing Buddhism right out of Southern India, and who composed the collection of hymns which stands first among the canonical works of S&#769;aivites. Legends make him a wonder-worker, but we must draw our knowledge of the man from his poems themselves. He certainly was skilful in the handling of the many metres in which Tamil poetry is written, and it is not impossible that his productions were as effortless as the stories of him tell. That is their weakness, for there is not very much of heart religion in them. But they seem to have powerfully helped in that process of eliminating Jainism and Buddhism from India of which we know so little, though it was complete enough to be one of the marvels of history. Their author holds the foremost place among the four great 'S&#769;aivite Preceptors' (S&#769;iv&#257;ch&#257;ryar), and some call him the incarnation of one of the sons of S&#769;iva.</p>  
<p>His date seems to be one of the few clearly established dates in the history of the religion of the country. Stanza 19 shews that he was a contemporary of another great early S&#769;aivite, whose name means "Little Servant of God," and who is known to have fought in a battle which took place in 642 A.D.</p>  
<p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></A> <a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></A></p>  
<p>We begin with the first verse which the author composed. According to the legends he uttered it at the age of three, on the banks of the temple tank at Shiy&#257;li (once Bram&#257;puram), after S&#769;iva's consort had fed him with milk from her own breast. The stanza itself of course contains no allusion to the story, but it is one of the best known verses in the S&#769;aivite hymnbook.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">1. His ears are beringed, He rideth the bull;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His head is adorned with the crescent moon's ray; White is He with ash from the burning-ground swept;<br> And He is the thief who my heal t steals away. Great Brahm&#257; enthroned on the lotus&#8217; full bloom<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Erstwhile bowed him down and His glory extolled, And singing received he the grace of our lore<br> Who dwelleth in fam&egrave;d Bram&#257;puram old.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>No pilgrimage in South India is more popular than that to Tiruva&#7751;&#7751;&#257;malai in North Arcot, the temple by a hill celebrated in many poems. S&#769;aivism has tried to express the existence of the 'eternal feminine' in deity by giving S&#769;iva a lady who not only is His consort, but is actually a part of Him, and is so represented in many images, which show S&#769;iva as masculine on one side and feminine on the other.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">2. He is our only Lord, conjoin&egrave;d still<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To her whose breast no sucking lips have known.<br> They who in A&#7751;&#7751;&#257;malai's holy hill,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where falling waters noisy chatter down,<br> And the hill glistens gem-like, bow before<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Our great one who is lord and lady too,<br> Unfailingly for them shall be no more<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Dread fruit of good and bad deeds they may do.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></A> <a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></A></p>  
<p>One of the first puzzles to a student of S&#769;aivism is the way in which each of the numerous shrines seems to be spoken of as if it were S&#769;iva's exclusive abode. The broad river marked on English maps as the Cauvery, but in Tamil called the K&#257;viri, which brings so much blessing to a large part of South India that the respect in which it is held is not difficult to understand, is fringed throughout its length with shrines which are believed to confer the blessings of S&#769;iva on all who visit them. One of these is 'Neytt&#257;nam,' 'Place of Ghee.'</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">3. So ye but say Neytt&#257;nam is the home<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of our great Lord who wears in his long hair<br> The crescent moon, the river, and the snake,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Neytt&#257;nam where chaste maidens gather fair,<br> On the north bank of K&#257;viri's loud stream,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Your vileness, guiltiness, the sin you dread,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Your sorrows many, shall be banish&egrave;d.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>This specimen of a hymn connected with Palny in the Madura District alludes (in stanza 5) to the well-known legend which says in the S&#769;aivite way that those who love God need not fear death. M&#257;rkandeya was a boy devoted to S&#769;iva, but over his life hung a terrible cloud, for the fates had decreed that he would not live beyond his sixteenth year. As the appointed time drew near his father lived in an agony of dread, but M&#257;rkandeya, free from fear, spent all his time in the worship of S&#769;iva. The god of Death came at last. Regardless of the fact that the boy was at worship he threw over him that noose which pulls out human life from the body. The boy clung to S&#769;iva's lingam with both his hands. From within the lingam S&#769;iva burst forth, kicked the terrible death-god and pierced him with his trident. So M&#257;rkandeya was saved. The scene is sculptured on many temples.</p>  
<p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></A> <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">4. Holy Vedas chanting,<br> Sacred thread He wears;<br> All His hosts surround Him<br> Whom the white bull bears.<br> Cometh He in splendour,<br> Tiger-skin attired.<br> 'Lord, our naked beggar<br> Above all desired,'<br> Cry ye in your worship,<br> At His feet appeal.<br> He who dwells in Palny<br> All your sin will heal.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">5. Three eyes hath His forehead,<br> Fair moon crowns His hair;<br> When Death sought a victim,<br> S&#769;iva's foot crashed there;<br> Gory streams of blood flowed,<br> Death it was that died,<br> Such is He, our Father,<br> Um a, at His side;<br> Dwells He aye in Palny,<br> Where bees hum around<br> Drunk with honeyed sweetness,<br> Till its groves resound.</div></p>  
<p>A multitude of hymns chant the glory of Chidambaram, ancient Tillai, holiest of all the S&#769;aivite shrines. Pious S&#769;aivites have for it a feeling not unlike the Jews&#8217; feeling for Jerusalem. The tending of the sacrificial fire comes down from pre-historic times, being firmly established when the earliest hymns of the Rig Veda were composed.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">6. Tending as taught of old the sacrificial fire,<br> At Tillai Brahmans pure drive out misfortune dire.<br> There dwells the First of all, moon-crowned, and<br> those who cleave<br> For ever to His foot, no cleaving sin will grieve.</div></p>

<p>Conjeeveram, the ancient Tamil name of which is given in this stanza, though more famous as a Vaish&#7751;avite than as a S&#769;aivite shrine, offers in its temples a remarkable compendium of the religious history of South India. See the article 'K&#257;nchipuram' in Dr. Hastings&#8217; 'Encyclop&aelig;dia of Religion and Ethics.'</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">7. He is the pith of holy writ;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And in the tangle of His hair<br> The spotless crescent's ray is lit;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He is both Lord and Lady fair.<br> He our great sovereign doth abide<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In Kachchi Ehambam's fair town.<br> My mind can think of naught beside,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Naught beside Him, and Him alone.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>The next two stanzas, taken from two separate hymns associated with the great cities of Trichinopoly and Madura, both sacred places of S&#769;aivism, are set side by side in order to bring out a point which even the most sympathetic student may not ignore. S&#769;iva is commonly spoken of as all good, as in stanza 8, and yet not infrequently He includes, as in stanza 9, both good and its opposite. The pantheistic tendency even in these hymns causes God to be sometimes depicted as so all-embracing as to include evil as well as good.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">8. All goodness hath He and no shadow of ill.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Grey-white is His bull, fair Um&#257; shares His form.<br> His wealth is past searching. Chir&#257;pa&#7735;&#7735;i's hill<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is His, whom to praise keeps my heart ever warm.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">9. Thou art right and Thou art wrong,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of holy &#256;lav&#257;y;<br> Kinsman, I to Thee belong;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Never fades Thy light away.<br> Thou the sense of books divine,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou my wealth, my bliss art Thou,<br> Thou my all, and in Thy shrine<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With what praises can I bow?</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></A> <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></A></p>  
<p>No one can know S&#769;iva unless He chooses to reveal Himself. This thought constantly recurs with great emphasis. Its favourite expression is in the first legend of the four told in our introduction. Hymn singers are fond of contrasting with the vain search of Brahm&#257; and Vish&#7751;u the revelation of Himself which S&#769;iva has graciously granted to them. Compare stanzas 25 and 48.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">10. Thou Light whom Brahm&#257;, being's fount, and Vish&#7751;u could not see,<br> No righteousness have I, I only speak in praise of Thee.<br> Come, Valivalam's Lord, let no dark fruit of deeds, I pray,<br> Torment Thy slave who with his song extols Thee day by day.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Astrology plays a large part in popular Hinduism, and the influence of baleful or auspicious stars must be reckoned with in daily life. Most baleful of all is the influence of the eclipse, which is caused by two dragons R&#257;hu and K&#275;tu which swallow the moon or the sun. This stanza enumerates the nine planets, Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury; Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, R&#257;hu and K&#275;tu, and says that to the singer, who has S&#769;iva in his heart, all of them, even the dragons of eclipse, are auspicious. It is a powerful and characteristically Hindu way of saying that all things work together for good to those who love God.</p>  
<p>The reference to the bamboo constantly recurs in descriptions of ladies&#8217; beauty. Everyone who has seen a feathery clump of bamboo trees waving in the breeze will understand it as a symbol of delicate grace.</p>  
<p>The v&#299;&#7751;a is the most delicate and beautiful instrument played in South India.</p>  
<p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></A> <a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">11. She shares His form whose shoulders&#8217; curve vies with the bamboo's grace.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His throat the poison drank, He touched the v&#299;&#7751;a into tune.<br> The lustrous moon and Ganges crown His hair, and He a place<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hath made Himself within my heart. Wherefore let shine the moon<br> Or sun or any star of good or ill, or serpents twain.<br> For S&#769;iva's slave all are benign, all work for him great gain.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>White ash from burnt cow-dung must be worn by all true S&#769;aivites. Every day the worshipper, facing north-east and crying 'S&#769;iva, S&#769;iva,' must dip in the ash the fingers of his right hand and draw the three middle fingers from left to right along his forehead, so leaving three horizontal white lines. The ceremonial side of S&#769;aivism is so prominent that this one stanza must be given, a specimen of many extolling the virtues and potencies of the ash.</p>  
<p>The Tantras are works inculcating ceremonies, also magic performances and mystic rites. Some of these are of an immoral nature.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">12. The sacred ash has mystic power,<br> &#8217;Tis worn by dwellers in the sky.<br> The ash bestows true loveliness.<br> Praise of the ash ascends on high.<br> The ash shows what tile Tantras mean,<br> And true religion's essence tells,<br> The ash of Him of &#256;lav&#257;y,<br> In whom red-lipp&egrave;d Um&#257; dwells.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></A> <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></A></p>  
<p>Equally important with the wearing of the sacred ash is the constant repetition of the five syllables, or panch&#257;kshara, 'Namas&#769;iv&#257;ya.' This, which means literally 'a bow to S&#769;iva,' is the chief mantra or mystic utterance of S&#769;aivism. In S&#769;aivite catechisms a whole chapter is devoted to its uses.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">13. Those who repeat it while love's tears outpour,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;It gives them life, and guides them in the way.<br> &#8217;Tis the true substance of the Vedas four,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord's great name, wherefore 'Hail S&#769;iva,' say.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>The next three stanzas are from a hymn written in a very attractive short-lined metre, and promise light, freedom from rebirth, and bliss, through devotion to S&#769;iva at &#256;r&#363;r (now Tiruva&#7735;&#7735;&#363;r in the Tanjore District).</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">14. For the Father in &#256;r&#363;r<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sprinkle ye the blooms of love;<br> In your heart will dawn true light,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Every bondage will remove.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">15. Him the holy in &#256;r&#363;r<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ne&#8217;er forget to laud and praise;<br> Bonds of birth will severed be,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Left behind all worldly ways.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">16. In &#256;r&#363;r, our loved one's gem,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Scatter golden blossoms fair.<br> Sorrow ye shall wipe away,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yours be bliss beyond compare.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></A> <a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></A></p>  
<p>Associated with the hymn from which our next verse is taken is a story of the author, Sambandar, helping a sorrowing woman by raising to life the man she loved, who had been killed by snake-bite. The hymn makes no allusion to such a miracle, but it does give an example of intercession on behalf of another, an element which is somewhat rare in these devotional books.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">17. Prostrate with fear at Thy feet she cries 'Lord with matted hair, my Refuge, Rider of the bull! Lord of Maruhal where fresh water-lilies bloom, is it right to leave her in this anguish of heart?</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Our present writer's poems contain such frequent denunciations of Buddhism or Jainism that it is clear that they were written at a time when the struggle between Hinduism and these other religions was at its height. Buddhism and Jainism are scarcely known in South India to-day, though at one time they were supreme. It is probable that these songs helped not a little to drive them out of the country.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">18. Those Buddhists and mad Jains may slander speak.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such speech befits the wand&#8217;rers from the way.<br> But He who came to earth and begged for alms,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the thief who stole my heart away.<br> The raging elephant charged down at Him;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O marvel! He but took and wore its hide;<br> Madman men think Him, but He is the Lord<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in great Bram&#257;puram doth abide.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></A> <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></A></p>  
<p>The "Little Servant of God" mentioned in the next verse is one of the 63 canonized saints of S&#769;aivism. According to the collection of legends known as the Periya Pur&#257;&#7751;am, which is a Tamil S&#769;aivite classic, he fought at the battle of V&#257;d&#257;pi, the modern Bad&#257;mi, which took place in 642 A.D. There are other indications which strengthen the view that these hymns date from the seventh century A.D.</p>  
<p>In the first three lines of the verse S&#769;iva is conceived as a lover, and the devotee as the woman whom He loves. In India the pain of absence from a lover is supposed to cause spots to appear on the skin of the woman who loves.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">19. Birds in the flowering green-branched pu&#7751;&#7751;ai tree,<br> Love writeth clear its marks on me, for He<br> Who cured my grief, yet left unending pain.<br> Senk&#257;ttanku&#7693;i is His holy fane,<br> And there His "Little Servant" dwells, who now<br> And ever doth before Lord S&#769;iva bow.<br> There in the burning-ground, with fire in hand,<br> Sporteth unceasingly our Master grand.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Another possible indication of date occurs in the next two verses, given in English prose because the Tamil names will not fit into English metres. The Mangaiyarkkarasi here mentioned was the wife of a king of Madura, K&#363;n P&#257;&#7751;diyan, known to history. According to the above-mentioned collection of stories, this king became a Jain. Then the queen and the prime minister named in our poem sent for Sambandar, our author, through whose efforts the king was reconverted, and all Jain teachers were executed by impaling. Unfortunately the date of K&#363;n P&#257;&#7751;diyan cannot at present be accurately determined. An able discussion of it can be seen in "The Tamilian Antiquary, No. 3."</p>  
<p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></A> <a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></A></p>  
<p>The explanation of the term 'Fish-eyed maid,' which sounds curiously in English ears, is that in Madura S&#769;iva's consort is called M&#299;n&#257;kshi, i.e. fish-eyed. The suggestion of the epithet, frequently applied to beautiful women, is that the motion of their eyes resembles the beautiful motion of a fish in water.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">20. This is Alav&#257;y, where dwells the flame-formed lord of hosts, giver of the four Vedas and their meaning, with the fair fish-eyed maid. Here, reigning like the goddess of good fortune, Mangaiyarkkarasi the Ch&#333;la king's daughter, braceletted chaste P&#257;&#7751;diyan queen, daily serves and praises God.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>The poem from which 20 and 21 are taken consists of stanzas like these alternately praising the queen and the king's minister, the last verse praising them both together.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">21. This is &#256;lav&#257;y, S&#769;iva's abode. To those who forsake the world He reveals Himself as world-forsaking too. Head of the heavenly ones, He rides the one white bull. Praised is He by Kulachchirai, minister of that monarch who wears white ash, and loves to lay himself bare at the feet of S&#769;iva's slaves.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Once, says a story, when Sambandar was about to contend with the Jains, the queen feared the consequences which might befal him, but he assured her in this verse that he could dare all when his God of Madura was on his side.</p>  
<p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></A> <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">22. O fair one with the deer's glance meek,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;P&#257;&#7751;dya's great queen, think not of me<br> As of some sucking infant weak,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because such wicked foes there be.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only Hara by me stand,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stronger am I than all their band.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>The story here is that the Janis had set fire to Sambandar's house. He prayed in this stanza that the fire, transformed into a fever, might go to the P&#257;ndyan king, then a Jain. It did so, and the king was converted.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">23. O Thou whose form is fiery red,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In holy Alav&#257;y, our Sire,<br> In grace deliver me from dread.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;False Jains have lit for me a fire:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, let it to the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;iyan ruler go,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he the torture of slow flame may know.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Our specimens of Sambandar's poetry may end with a verse which is a kind of benediction, often set as an auspicious word on the front page of a book.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">24. Blest be the Brahmans pure, the heavenly ones, and kine.<br> Cool rain fall on the earth! May the king's glory shine!<br> Perish all forms of ill! Let Hara's name resound!<br> May sorrow pass away, from earth's remotest bound.</div></p>
