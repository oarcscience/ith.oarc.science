<p align="center">(Abbreviated as SUNDARAR)</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> third of these hymn-writers, named in full Sundaram&#363;rti Sw&#257;mi, was, like Sambandar, a Brahman. He was born in the South Arcot District, and is generally believed to have flourished in the first quarter of the ninth century A.D. He evidently sat loose to caste scruples, for neither of his two wives was a Brahman. One was a dancing-girl in the S&#769;aivite temple at Tiruv&#257;r&#363;r, the modern Tiruvalur in the Tanjore District, while the other was a V&#275;&#7735;&#257;&#7735;a woman of Tiruvottiy&#363;r, now a suburb of Madras. His life seems to have been no happier than life in polygamy usually is, and to add to his difficulties he sometimes found himself without food for his ladies to eat. He frankly praised God for what he could get, and on the whole his hymns are on a lower spiritual plane than those of the first two writers, though there are some which bear the marks of real spiritual experience. Of the sixty-three saints whom S&#769;aivites hold in special honour, Sundarar seems to have been the last, for he sang the praises of the other sixty-two.</p>

<p>Sundarar, as our first sample of him shews, was not only later than the two authors whom we have been studying; he was the last of the sixty-three canonized saints of S&#769;aivism. A serious weakness of the religion here shews its head. S&#769;iva has his favourites, who can do no wrong. The stanza is given in prose, for these names cannot fit into any English metrical line. The first two will be recognised as names of the poets whose work we have been considering. N&#257;&#7735;aipp&#333;v&#257;n is Nandan, the pariah saint. Silandi (= spider) is K&#333;chchenga&#7789; Chola, who figures largely in early Tamil history.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">65. &Ntilde;&#257;nasambandar and Tirun&#257;vukkarasar, skilled in the Tamil tongue, N&#257;&#7735;aipp&#333;v&#257;n, learned S&#363;dan, S&#257;kkiyan, Silandi, Ka&#7751;&#7751;appan, Ka&#7751;ampullan, these may do wrong, but yet Thou count&#8217;st it right. Hence have I come to the sounding anklets of Thy feet, O lord of Tiruppung&#363;r with its pools where blossoms many a golden lotus gem.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>To English ears the metre of the next two verses, which are common favourites, has a curious sound. It is a close reproduction of the Tamil, so close that the tune of the Tamil hymn could be sung to the English words.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">66. Golden art Thou in Thy form, girt around with the fierce tiger's skin,<br> Fair shines Thy tangle of hair, crowned with blooms from the kondai's bright tree,<br> Sov&#8217;reign, great jewel art Thou, the red ruby of Mal&#804;ap&#257;&#7693;i,<br> Mother, on Thee, none but Thee, can my heart evermore fix&egrave;d be.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></A> <a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">67. Clad in the little loin-cloth, my body with holy ash white,<br> Lo I have come to Thy foot; O my head, I beseech Thee, take me.<br> Portion of sword-eyed Um&#257;, Thou red ruby of Mal&#804;ap&#257;&#7693;i,<br> Friend, &#8217;tis on Thee, none but Thee, can my heart evermore fix&egrave;d be.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Is the S&#769;iva manifested at one shrine so distinct from the S&#769;iva manifested at another as to endanger the unity of God? If tradition is right, the danger is very real, for Sundarar was already worshipping at one shrine, Tiruvottiy&#363;r, when he remembered the lord of &#256;r&#363;r, and deciding to go to him like a returning prodigal, sang this stanza.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">68. Ah sinful, I have left the path of love and service pure!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Now know I well the meaning of my sickness and my pain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I will go worship. Fool! how long can I so far remain<br> From Him, my pearl, my diamond rare, the king of great &#256;r&#363;r.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>The joy in God which shines in our next hymn evidently rests on some experience of divine grace which we should have liked to hear more definitely described.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">69. O madman with the moon-crowned hair,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou lord of men, thou fount of grace,<br> How to forget Thee could I bear?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;My soul hath aye for Thee a place.<br> Ve&#7751;&#7751;ey-nall&#363;r, in "Grace's shrine"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;South of the stream of Pe&#7751;&#7751;ai, there<br> My father, I became all thine;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How could I now myself forswear?</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></A> <a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">70. I roamed, a cur, for many days<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Without a single thought of Thee,<br> Roamed and grew weary, then such grace<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As none could win Thou gayest me.<br> Ve&#7751;&#7751;ey-nall&#363;r, in "Grace's shrine"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where bamboos fringe the Pe&#7751;&#7751;ai, there<br> My Shepherd, I became all thine;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How could I now myself forswear?</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">71. Henceforth for me no birth, no death,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;No creeping age, bull-rider mine.<br> Sinful and full of lying breath<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Am I, hut do Thou mark me Thine.<br> Ve&#7751;&#7751;ey-nall&#363;r, in "Graces shrine"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;South of the wooded Pe&#7751;&#7751;ai, there<br> My Master, I became all thine;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How could I now myself forswear?</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>The varying mood of the saint, now joyous and triumphant, now plaintively looking for death, is reflected in the next two verses from one hymn.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">72. Linked to naught else in life, my mind thinks only of Thy holy feet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm born anew, from this time forth I pass the way of birth no more.<br> In Ko&#7693;umu&#7693;i, lord austere, where wise men Thee with praises greet,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Should I forget Thee, my own tongue 'Hail, S&#769;iva'! crying, would adore.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></A> <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">73. When will the end draw nigh, sense fade, life close, and I the bier ascend?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;This, naught but this, is all my thought. But, lord of speech, Thou light on high,<br> Where the bright streams of K&#257;viri to Ko&#7693;umu&#7693;i coolness lend,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Should I forget Thee, my own tongue to Thee would loud 'Hail, S&#769;iva' cry.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>God should deliver His own from death. The appeal here is to the familiar story of Markandeya (see No. 3). Yama is the god of death who gathers in the souls of men.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">74. The young saint refuge sought from Death;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To save him, Thou grim Death did&#8217;st slay,<br> Such deeds Thy might accomplisheth,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And I who have beheld them pray<br> "O Father, should dread Yama press<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;On me, forbid him. &#8217;Tis my slave";<br> Do Thou in green Pung&#363;r confess.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I've reached Thy foot, and Thou can&#8217;st save."</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Sundarar is sure that S&#769;iva will understand his perplexities in supplying the needs of his fair ladies. For does not S&#769;iva Himself bear the burden of two ladies, P&#257;rvati his consort, and Gang&#257; (lady Ganges) in his hair? Sundarar, in the legend with which these verses are connected, when one of his wives was suffering hunger, miraculously received some uncooked rice from S&#769;iva. This was not enough; to complete the miracle S&#769;iva must remove the rice for him to &#256;r&#363;r the abode of his fair one. This too was done in answer to the hymn of which the next two stanzas are a sample.</p>  
<p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></A> <a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">75. Ever I think but of Thee;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Daily in worship I bow;<br> She of the sword-piercing eyes,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Leave her not suffering now.<br> K&#333;&#7735;ili's lord, Thou didst give<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Rice in Ku&#7751;&#7693;aiy&#363;r this day.<br> No man to bring it have I,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bid it be sent me, I pray.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">76. Thou art half woman Thyself; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ga&#7749;g&#257; is in Thy long hair.<br> Full well canst Thou comprehend<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Burden of women so fair.<br> Ku&#7751;&#7693;aiy&#363;r circled with gems,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;There didst Thou give rice to-day.<br> Source of all, wonderful one,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bid it be sent me, I pray.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>The saint advises his fellow-poets to sing the praises of S&#769;iva rather than the praises of men because they seldom reward the poets. S&#769;iva rewards them here and hereafter. The P&#257;ri mentioned in 78 was a chieftain in the Tamil country in the early centuries of our era, famed for his liberality.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">77. Though ye fawn on men of lies,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They to saints will nothing give;<br> Sing not them, O poets wise,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But if ye would wealth receive<br> Sing the Sire of Puhal&#363;r;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Here your wants will be supplied,<br> Pain will flee; there evermore<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ye will kings in heav&#8217;n abide.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></A> <a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">78. Call the weak by Bhima's name,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Style him Arjun with his bow,<br> Give the mean man P&#257;ri's fame,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Not a gift will he bestow.<br> Sing, O bards, our holy God,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;White with ash, in Puhal&#363;r.<br> In the deathless one's abode<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall reign for evermore.</div></p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Life and experience have no value, no reality. God alone is real, the refuge from the unreal.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">79. Our life is all unreal,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Its end is only dust,<br> Out of the sea of birth<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Come ruin, pain and lust.<br> Delay not to do good<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But praise Ket&#257;ram's king,<br> Whom Vish&#7751;u and great Brahm<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly sought sorrowing.</div></p>
