<P>a Yoking mind first,<BR>
Extending his thoughts, Savitr<BR>
Discerning the light,<BR>
Hath brought Agni from the earth.<BR>
b Yoking with mind the gods,<BR>
Going to the heaven, the sky, with thought,<BR>
Those that are to make great light,<BR>
Savitr instigates.<BR>
c With mind well yoked are we<BR>
In the instigation of god Savitr,<BR>
For strength to go to the heaven.<BR>
d They yoke their minds, they yoke their thoughts,<BR>
The priests of the mighty wise priest,<BR>
He alone, who knoweth the way, appointeth their functions [1]<BR>
Great is the praise of the god Savitr.<BR>
e I yoke with honour your ancient prayer;<BR>
The praises go like Suras on their way;<BR>
All the sons of immortality hear (it),<BR>
Who have achieved dwellings divine.<BR>
f He whose advance others followed,<BR>
Gods, of the god praising might,<BR>
He who meted out the regions of earth,<BR>
He is the brilliant god Savitr in greatness.<BR>
g O god Savitr, instigate the sacrifice, instigate the lord of the sacrifice [2] to good luck; may the divine Gandharva, who purifieth thoughts purify our thought; may the lord of speech to-day make sweet our utterance.<BR>
h This sacrifice for us, O god Savitr<BR>
Do thou instigate, serving the gods,<BR>
Finding comrades, ever victorious,<BR>
Winning booty, winning heaven.<BR>
i By the Rc make the Stoma to prosper,<BR>
By the Gayatra the Rathantara,<BR>
The Brhat with the Gayatri for its metre.<BR>
k On the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the A&ccedil;vins, with the hands of Pusan, with the Gayatri metre, I take thee, in the manner of Angiras.<BR>
l Thou art the spade, thou art the woman [3], from the abode of the earth I bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras; with the Tristubh metre I grasp thee in the manner of Angiras.<BR>
m Thou art the bearer, thou art the woman; through thee may we be strong to dig Agni of the dust in his place; with the Jagati metre I grasp thee in the manner of Angiras.<BR>
n Grasping in thy hand, Savitr,<BR>
Bearing the spade of gold,<BR>
Therewith digging Agni<BR>
Do thou bring for us light unperishing.<BR>
With the Anustubh metre I grasp thee in the manner of Angiras.</P>
<H3>iv. i. 2.</H3>

At their assemblies in ages gone by, the sages;<BR>
Therewith the gods mastered the pressed (juice)--<BR>
In the Saman of order proclaiming the stream.<BR>

Along the days first, the all-knower,<BR>
And in many ways along the rays of the sun [2],<BR>
He hath extended along sky and earth.<BR>
I The steed coming from the way<BR>
Driveth every foe;<BR>
He is fain to gaze with his eye<BR>
On Agni in his great abode.<BR>
m Coming to earth, O steed,<BR>
Do thou seek Agni with thy radiance;<BR>
Turning from earth I tell us<BR>
Whence we shall dig him up.<BR>
n Thy back is the sky, thy abode earth,<BR>
Thy breath the atmosphere, thy birthplace the ocean;<BR>
Discerning with thine eye,<BR>
Do thou overcome [3] the enemy.<BR>

Thence let us dig Agni of fair aspect,<BR>
Mounting the heaven on the top of the vault.<BR>
q The water divine do thou pour, full of sweetness<BR>
To avert diseases for men,<BR>
From their place let arise<BR>
Plants with fair leaves.<BR>

s I touch thee with speech, with ghee,<BR>
With friendly mind accept it;<BR>
With mortal glory, with engaging colour,<BR>
Agni, with body full of life may not be touched.<BR>
t Round the offerings hath Agni gone,<BR>
The sage, the lord of strength,<BR>
Bestowing jewels on the donor.<BR>
u May we set thee around us, O Agni,<BR>
The sage, O strong one, as a fort,<BR>
Of daring due, day by day,<BR>
Destroyer of that which may be broken.<BR>

i Thee Pathya Vrsan doth kindle,<BR>
Best slayer of foes,<BR>
Winner of booty in every conflict.<BR>
k Sit thou, O Hotr, in thine own world, wise,<BR>
Place thou the sacrifice in the birthplace of good deeds,<BR>
Eager for the gods, do thou sacrifice to them with oblation;<BR>
O Agni, bestow great strength on the sacrificer.<BR>
l The Hotr hath sat him down in the place of the Hoty, wise,<BR>
Glittering, shining, skilful,<BR>
With vows and foresight undeceived, most wealthy,<BR>
Bearing a thousand, pure-tongued Agni.<BR>

g The four and thirty ribs of the strong steed,<BR>
Kin of the gods, the axe meeteth;<BR>
Skilfully do ye make the joints faultless;<BR>
Declaring each part, do ye cut it asunder.<BR>
h One carver is there of the steed of Tvastr<BR>
Two restrainers are there, so is the use;<BR>
Those parts of thy limbs that I place in order,<BR>
Those in balls I offer in the fire.<BR>
i Let not thy dear self distress thee [3] as thou comest;<BR>
Let not the axe stay in thy body;<BR>
May no greedy skilless carver,<BR>
Missing the joints, mangle thy limbs with the knife.<BR>
k Thou dost not die, indeed, thou art not injured,<BR>
On easy paths thou goest to the gods;<BR>
The bays, the dappled ones, have become thy yoke-fellows;<BR>
The steed bath stood under the yoke of the ass.<BR>
I Wealth of kine for us, may the strong one (grant), wealth in horses,<BR>
Men and sons, and every form of prosperity;<BR>
May Aditi confer on us sinlessness;<BR>
Kingship for us may the horse rich in offering gain.</P>
