<P>
This is a collection of essays by Sister Nivedita, Margaret E. Noble,
an Anglo-Irish Hindu convert who moved to India and devoted herself
to helping poor women of all castes.
It includes an appreciative introduction by
<A HREF="../tagore/index.htm">Rabindranath Tagore</A>, the
Nobel laureate writer, one of her many friends in the
Bengali artistic community.
</P>
<P>
Although long out of print, this book was a sensation when it
was originally published.
Nivedita here espouses Hindu pan-Indian nationalism,
while also rationalizing some of the aspects of Indian
life such as the caste system.
She deals with the historical background of religious tolerance in India,
including the contributions of Muslims and Buddhists,
and the ability of Hinduism to assimilate compatible doctrines,
no matter what their source.</P>
<P>
Nivedita has a unique and much beloved position in Indian history
as one of the few westerners who took up the cause of Indian independence.
You will come away from reading this book
with a new appreciation for the problems which India faced in forging
a democratic nation based on diversity.
