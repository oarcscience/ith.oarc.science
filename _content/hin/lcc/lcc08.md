### ACT THE SECOND

#### THE SHAMPOOER <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38) WHO GAMBLED

\[*Enter a maid*.\]

*Maid*.

I AM sent with a message to my mistress by her mother. I must go in and
find my mistress. \[*She walks about and looks around her*.\] There is
my mistress. She is painting a picture, and putting her whole heart into
it. I must go and speak to her.

\[*Then appear the love-lorn Vasantasenā, seated, and Madanikā*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. Well, girl, and then—

*Madanikā*. But mistress, you were not speaking of anything. What do you
mean?

*Vasantasenā*. Why, what did I say?

*Madanikā*. You said, "and then"—

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Puckering her brows*.\] Oh, yes. So I did.

*Maid*. \[*Approaching*.\] Mistress, your mother sends word that you
should bathe and then offer worship to the gods.

*Vasantasenā*. You may tell my mother that I shall not take the
ceremonial bath to-day. A Brahman must offer worship in my place.

*Maid*. Yes, mistress.

\[*Exit*.

*Madanikā*. My dear mistress, it is love, not naughtiness, that asks the
question—but what does this mean?

*Vasantasenā*. Tell me, Madanikā. How do I seem to you?

*Madanikā*. My mistress is so absent-minded that I know her heart is
filled with longing for somebody.

*Vasantasenā*. Well guessed. My Madanikā is quick to fathom another's
heart.

*Madanikā*. I am very, very glad. Yes, Kāma is indeed mighty, and

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

his great festival is welcome when one is young. But tell me, mistress,
is it a king, or a king's favorite, whom you worship?

*Vasantasenā*. Girl, I wish to love, not to worship.

*Madanikā*. Is it a Brahman that excites your passion, some youth
distinguished for very particular learning?

*Vasantasenā*. A Brahman I should have to reverence.

*Madanikā*. Or is it some young merchant, grown enormously wealthy from
visiting many cities?

*Vasantasenā*. A merchant, girl, must go to other countries and leave
you behind, no matter how much you love him. And the separation makes
you very sad.

*Madanikā*. It isn't a king, nor a favorite, nor a Brahman, nor a
merchant. Who is it then that the princess loves?

*Vasantasenā*. Girl! Girl! You went with me to the park where Kāma's
temple stands?

*Madanikā*. Yes, mistress.

*Vasantasenā*. And yet you ask, as if you were a perfect stranger.

*Madanikā*. Now I know. Is it the man who comforted you when you asked
to be protected?

*Vasantasenā*. Well, what was his name?

*Madanikā*. Why, he lives in the merchants’ quarter.

*Vasantasenā*. But I asked you for his name.

*Madanikā*. His name, mistress, is a good omen in itself. His name is
Chārudatta.

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Joyfully*.\] Good, Madanikā, good. You have guessed
it.

*Madanikā*. \[*Aside*.\] So much for that. \[*Aloud*.\] Mistress, they
say he is poor.

*Vasantasenā*. That is the very reason why I love him. For a courtezan
who sets her heart on a poor man is blameless in the eyes of the world.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

*Madanikā*. But mistress, do the butterflies visit the mango-tree when
its blossoms have fallen?

*Vasantasenā*. That is just why we call that sort of a girl a butterfly.

*Madanikā*. Well, mistress, if you love him, why don't you go and visit
him at once?

*Vasantasenā*. Girl, if I should visit him at once, then, because he
can't make any return—no, I don't mean that, but it would be hard to see
him.

*Madanikā*. Is that the reason why you left your jewels with him?

*Vasantasenā*. You have guessed it.

 

*A voice* <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39) *behind the scenes*. Oh,
sir, a shampooer owes me ten gold-pieces, and he got away from us. Hold
him, hold him! \[*To the fleeing shampooer*.\] Stop, stop! I see you
from here. \[*Enter hurriedly a frightened shampooer*.\]

*Shampooer*. Oh, confound this gambling business!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Freed from its tether, the ace—  
I might better say "ass"—how it kicks me!  
And the cast of the dice called the "spear"  
Proves true to its name; for it sticks me.<span
class="margnote">1</span>  
The keeper's whole attention  
Was busy with the score;  
So it took no great invention  
To vanish through the door.  
But I cannot stand forever  
In the unprotected street.  
Is there no one to deliver?  
I would fall before his feet.<span class="margnote">2</span>

</div>

While the keeper and the gambler are looking somewhere else for me, I'll
just walk backwards into this empty temple and turn goddess. \[*He makes
all sorts of gestures, takes his place, and waits. Enter Māthura and the
gambler*.\]

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

*Māthura*. Oh, sir, a shampooer owes me ten gold-pieces, and he got away
from us. Hold him, hold him! Stop, stop! I see you from here.

*Gambler*. You may run to hell, if they'll take you in;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  With Indra, the god, you may stay:  
For there's never a god can save your skin,  
  While Māthura wants his pay.<span class="margnote">3</span>

</div>

*Māthura*. Oh, whither flee you, nimble rambler,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You that cheat an honest gambler?  
You that shake with fear and shiver,  
All a-tremble, all a-quiver;  
You that cannot trip enough,  
On the level ground and rough;  
You that stain your social station,  
Family, and reputation!<span class="margnote">4</span>

</div>

*Gambler*. \[*Examining the footprints*.\] Here he goes. And here the
tracks are lost.

*Māthura*. \[*Gazes at the footprints. Reflectively*.\] Look! The feet
are turned around. And the temple hasn't any image. \[*After a moment's
thought*.\] That rogue of a shampooer has gone into the temple with his
feet turned around.

*Gambler*. Let's follow him.

*Māthura*. All right. \[*They enter the temple and take a good look,
then make signs to each other*.\]

*Gambler*. What! a wooden image?

*Māthura*. Of course not. It's stone. \[*He shakes it with all his
might, then makes signs*.\] What do we care? Come, let's have a game.
\[*He starts to gamble as hard as he can*.\]

*Shampooer*. \[*Trying with all his might to repress the gambling fever.
Aside*.\] Oh, oh!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Oh, the rattle of dice is a charming thing,  
  When you haven't a copper left; <span id="page_31">p. 31</span>  
It works like a drum on the heart of a king,  
  Of all his realm bereft.<span class="margnote">5</span>

For gamblers leap down a mountain steep—  
  I know I shall not play.  
Yet the rattle of dice is as sweet as the peep  
  Of nightingales in May.<span class="margnote">6</span>

</div>

*Gambler*. My turn, my turn!

*Māthura*. Not much! it's my turn.

*Shampooer*. \[*Coming up quickly from behind*.\] Isn't it my turn?

*Gambler*. We've got our man.

*Māthura*. \[*Seizing him*.\] You jail-bird, you're caught. Pay me my
ten gold-pieces.

*Shampooer*. I'll pay you this very day.

*Māthura*. Pay me this very minute!

*Shampooer*. I'll pay you. Only have mercy!

*Māthura*. Come, will you pay me now?

*Shampooer*. My head is getting dizzy. \[*He falls to the ground. The
others beat him with all their might*.\]

*Māthura*. There \[*drawing the gamblers’ ring*\] you're bound by the
gamblers’ ring.

*Shampooer*. \[*Rises. Despairingly*.\] What! bound by the gamblers’
ring? Confound it! That is a limit which we gamblers can't pass. Where
can I get the money to pay him?

*Māthura*. Well then, you must give surety.

*Shampooer*. I have an idea. \[*He nudges the gambler*.\] I'll give you
half, if you'll forgive me the other half.

*Gambler*. All right.

*Shampooer*. \[*To Māthura*.\] I'll give you surety for a half. You
might forgive me the other half.

*Māthura*. All right. Where's the harm?

*Shampooer*. \[*Aloud*.\] You forgave me a half, sir?

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

*Māthura*. Yes.

*Shampooer*. \[*To the gambler*.\] And you forgave me a half?

*Gambler*. Yes.

*Shampooer*. Then I think I'll be going.

*Māthura*. Pay me my ten gold-pieces! Where are you going?

*Shampooer*. Look at this, gentlemen, look at this! Here I just gave
surety to one of them for a half, and the other forgave me a half. And
even after that he is dunning me, poor helpless me!

*Māthura*. \[*Seizing him*.\] My name is Māthura, the clever swindler,
and you're not going to swindle me this time. Pay up, jail-bird, every
bit of my money, and this minute, too.

*Shampooer*. How can I pay?

*Māthura*. Sell your father and pay.

*Shampooer*. Where can I get a father?

*Māthura*. Sell your mother and pay.

*Shampooer*. Where can I get a mother?

*Māthura*. Sell yourself and pay.

*Shampooer*. Have mercy! Lead me to the king's highway.

*Māthura*. Go ahead.

*Shampooer*. If it must be. \[*He walks about*.\] Gentlemen, will you
buy me for ten gold-pieces from this gambling-master? \[*He sees a
passer-by and calls out*.\] What is that? You wish to know what I can
do? I will be your house-servant. What! he has gone without even
answering. Well, here's another. I'll speak to him. \[*He repeats his
offer*.\] What! this one too takes no notice of me. He is gone. Confound
it! I've had hard luck ever since Chārudatta lost his fortune.

*Māthura*. Will you pay?

*Shampooer*. How can I pay? \[*He falls down. Māthura drags him
about*.\] Good gentlemen, save me, save me! \[*Enter Darduraka*.\]

*Darduraka*. Yes, gambling is a kingdom without a throne.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You do not mind defeat at all;  
Great are the sums you spend and win;  
While kingly revenues roll in,  
Rich men, like slaves, before you fall.<span class="margnote">7</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You earn your coin by gambling,  
Your friends and wife by gambling,  
Your gifts and food by gambling;  
Your last cent goes by gambling.<span class="margnote">8</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My cash was taken by the trey;  
The deuce then took my health away;  
The ace then set me on the street;  
The four completed my defeat.<span class="margnote">9</span>

</div>

\[*He looks before him*.\] Here comes Māthura, our sometime
gambling-master. Well, as I can't escape, I think I'll put on my veil.
\[*He makes any number of gestures with his cloak, then examines it*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

This cloth is sadly indigent in thread;  
  This lovely cloth lets in a lot of light;  
This cloth's protective power is nearly fled;  
  This cloth is pretty when it's rolled up tight.<span
class="margnote">10</span>

</div>

Yet after all, what more could a poor saint do? For you see,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

One foot I've planted in the sky,  
The other on the ground must lie. <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40)  
The elevation's rather high,  
But the sun stands it. Why can't I?<span class="margnote">11</span>

</div>

*Māthura*. Pay, pay!

*Shampooer*. How can I pay? \[*Māthura drags him about*.\]

*Darduraka*. Well, well, what is this I see? \[*He addresses a
bystander*.\] What did you say, sir? "This shampooer is being maltreated
by the gambling-master, and no one will save him"? I'll save him myself.
\[*He presses forward*.\] Stand back, stand back!

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

\[*He takes a look*.\] Well, if this isn't that swindler Māthura. And
here is the poor saintly shampooer; a saint to be sure,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Who does not hang with bended head  
  Rigid till set of sun,  
Who does not rub his back with sand  
  Till boils begin to run,  
Whose shins dogs may not browse upon,  
  As they pass him in their rambling. <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41)  
Why should this tall and dainty man  
  Be so in love with gambling?<span class="margnote">12</span>

</div>

Well, I must pacify Māthura. \[*He approaches*.\] How do you do,
Māthura? \[*Māthura returns the greeting*.\]

*Darduraka*. What does this mean?

*Māthura*. He owes me ten gold-pieces.

*Darduraka*. A mere bagatelle!

*Māthura*. \[*Pulling the rolled-up cloak from under Darduraka's arm*.\]
Look, gentlemen, look! The man in the ragged cloak calls ten gold-pieces
a mere bagatelle.

*Darduraka*. My good fool, don't I risk ten gold-pieces on a cast of the
dice? Suppose a man has money—is that any reason why he should put it in
his bosom and show it? But you,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You'll lose your caste, you'll lose your soul,  
For ten gold-pieces that he stole,  
To kill a man that's sound and whole,  
  With five good senses in him.<span class="margnote">13</span>

</div>

*Māthura*. Ten gold-pieces may be a mere bagatelle to you, sir. To me
they are a fortune.

*Darduraka*. Well then, listen to me. Just give him ten more, and let
him go to gambling again.

*Māthura*. And what then?

*Darduraka*. If he wins, he will pay you.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

*Māthura*. And if he doesn't win?

*Darduraka*. Then he won't pay you.

*Māthura*. This is no time for nonsense. If you say that, you can give
him the money yourself. My name is Māthura. I'm a swindler and I play a
crooked game, and I'm not afraid of anybody. You are an immoral
scoundrel.

*Darduraka*. Who did you say was immoral?

*Māthura*. You're immoral.

*Darduraka*. Your father is immoral. \[He gives the shampooer a sign to
escape.\]

*Māthura*. You cur! That is just the way that you gamble.

*Darduraka*. That is the way I gamble?

*Māthura*. Come, shampooer, pay me my ten gold-pieces.

*Shampooer*. I'll pay you this very day. I'll pay at once. \[Māthura
drags him about.\]

*Darduraka*. Fool! You may maltreat him when I am away, but not before
my eyes.

\[*Māthura seizes the shampooer and hits him on the nose. The shampooer
bleeds, faints, and falls flat. Darduraka approaches and interferes.
Māthura strikes Darduraka, and Darduraka strikes back*.\]

*Māthura*. Oh, oh, you accursèd hound! But I'll pay you for this.

*Darduraka*. My good fool, I was walking peaceably along the street, and
you struck me. If you strike me to-morrow in court, then you will open
your eyes.

*Māthura*. Yes, I'll open my eyes.

*Darduraka*. How will you open your eyes?

*Māthura*. \[*Opening his eyes wide*.\] This is the way I'll open my
eyes. \[Darduraka throws dust in Māthura's eyes, and gives the shampooer
a sign to escape. Māthura shuts his eyes and falls down. The shampooer
escapes.\]

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

*Darduraka*. \[*Aside*.\] I have made an enemy of the influential
gambling-master Māthura. I had better not stay here. Besides, my good
friend Sharvilaka told me that a young herdsman named Aryaka has been
designated by a soothsayer as our future king. Now everybody in my
condition is running after him. I think I will join myself to him.

\[*Exit*.

 

*Shampooer*. \[*Trembles as he walks away and looks about him*.\] Here
is a house where somebody has left the side-door open. I will go in.
\[*He enters and perceives Vasantasenā*.\] Madam, I throw myself upon
your protection.

*Vasantasenā*. He who throws himself upon my protection shall be safe.
Close the door, girl. \[*The maid does so*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. What do you fear?

*Shampooer*. A creditor, madam.

*Vasantasenā*. You may open the door now, girl.

*Shampooer*. \[*To himself*.\] Ah! Her reasons for not fearing a
creditor are in proportion to her innocence. The proverb is right:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The man who knows his strength and bears a load  
  Proportioned to that strength, not more nor less,  
  Is safe from stumbling and from sore distress,  
Although he wander on a dreary road.<span class="margnote">14</span>

</div>

That means me.

 

*Māthura*. \[*Wiping his eyes. To the gambler*.\] Pay, pay!

*Gambler*. While we were quarreling with Darduraka, sir, the man
escaped.

*Māthura*. I broke that shampooer's nose for him with my fist. Come on!
Let's trace him by the blood. \[*They do so*.\]

*Gambler*. He went into Vasantasenā's house, sir.

*Māthura*. Then that is the end of the gold-pieces.

*Gambler*. Let's go to court and lodge a complaint.

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

*Māthura*. The swindler would leave the house and escape. No, we must
besiege him and so capture him.

 

\[*Vasantasenā gives Madanikā a sign*.\]

*Madanikā*. Whence are you, sir? or who are you, sir? or whose son are
you, sir? or what is your business, sir? or what are you afraid of?

*Shampooer*. Listen, madam. My birthplace is Pātaliputra, madam. I am
the son of a householder. I practise the trade of a shampooer.
Vasantasenā. It is a very dainty art, sir, which you have mastered.

*Shampooer*. Madam, as an art I mastered it. It has now become a mere
trade.

*Madanikā*. Your answers are most disconsolate, sir. Pray continue.

*Shampooer*. Yes, madam. When I was at home, I used to hear travelers
tell tales, and I wanted to see new countries, and so I came here. And
when I had come here to Ujjayinī, I became the servant of a noble
gentleman. Such a handsome, courteous gentleman! When he gave money
away, he did not boast; when he was injured, he forgot it. To cut a long
story short: he was so courteous that he regarded his own person as the
possession of others, and had compassion on all who sought his
protection.

*Madanikā*. Who may it be that adorns Ujjayinī with the virtues which he
has stolen from the object of my mistress’ desires?

*Vasantasenā*. Good, girl, good! I had the same thought in mind.

*Madanikā*. But to continue, sir

*Shampooer*. Madam, he was so compassionate and so generous that now—

*Vasantasenā*. His riches have vanished?

*Shampooer*. I didn't say it. How did you guess it, madam?

*Vasantasenā*. What was there to guess? Virtue and money seldom keep
company. In the pools from which men cannot drink there is so much the
more water.

*Madanikā*. But sir, what is his name?

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

*Shampooer*. Madam, who does not know the name of this moon of the whole
world? He lives in the merchants’ quarter. He whose name is worthy of
all honor is named Chārudatta.

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Joyfully rising from her seat*.\] Sir, this house is
your own. Give him a seat, girl, and take this fan. The gentleman is
weary. \[*Madanikā does as she is bid*.\]

*Shampooer*. \[*Aside*.\] What! so much honor because I mentioned
Chārudatta's name? Heaven bless you, Chārudatta! You are the only man in
the world who really lives. All others merely breathe. \[*He falls at
Vasantasenā's feet*.\] Enough, madam, enough. Pray be seated, madam.

*Vasantasenā*. \[Seating herself.\] Where is he who is so richly your
creditor, sir?

*Shamp*. The good man's wealth consists in kindly deeds;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  All other wealth is vain and quickly flies.  
The man who honors not his neighbor's needs,  
  Does that man know what honor signifies?<span
class="margnote">15</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. But to continue—

*Shampooer*. So I became a servant in his employ. And when his wealth
was reduced to his virtue, I began to live by gambling. But fate was
cruel, and I lost ten gold-pieces.

*Māthura*. I am ruined! I am robbed!

*Shampooer*. There are the gambling-master and the gambler, looking for
me. You have heard my story, madam. The rest is your affair.

*Vasantasenā*. Madanikā, the birds fly everywhither when the tree is
shaken in which they have their nests. Go, girl, and give the
gambling-master and the gambler this bracelet. And tell them that this
gentleman sends it. \[*She removes a bracelet from her arm, and gives it
to Madanikā*.\]

*Madanikā*. \[*Receiving the bracelet*.\] Yes, mistress. \[*She goes
out*.\]

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

*Māthura*. I am ruined! I am robbed!

*Madanikā*. Inasmuch as these two are looking up to heaven, and sighing,
and chattering, and fastening their eyes on the door, I conclude that
they must be the gambling-master and the gambler. \[*Approaching*.\] I
salute you, sir.

*Māthura*. May happiness be yours.

*Madanikā*. Sir, which of you is the gambling-master?

*Māth*. O maiden, fair but something less than shy,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  With red lip wounded in love's ardent play,  
On whom is bent that sweet, coquettish eye?  
  For whom that lisp that steals the heart away?<span
class="margnote">16</span>

</div>

I haven't got any money. You'll have to look somewhere else.

*Madanikā*. You are certainly no gambler, if you talk that way. Is there
any one who owes you money?

*Māthura*. There is. He owes ten gold-pieces. What of him?

*Madanikā*. In his behalf my mistress sends you this bracelet. No, no!
He sends it himself.

*Māthura*. \[*Seizing it joyfully*.\] Well, well, you may tell the noble
youth that his account is squared. Let him come and seek delight again
in gambling.

\[*Exeunt Māthura and the gambler*.

*Madanikā*. \[*Returning to Vasantasenā*.\] Mistress, the
gambling-master and the gambler have gone away well-pleased.

*Vasantasenā*. Go, sir, and comfort your kinsfolk.

*Shampooer*. Ah, madam, if it may be, these hands would gladly practise
their art in your service.

*Vasantasenā*. But sir, he for whose sake you mastered the art, who
first received your service, he should have your service still.

*Shampooer*. \[*Aside*.\] A very pretty way to decline my services. How
shall I repay her kindness? \[Aloud.\] Madam, thus dishonored as a
gambler, I shall become a Buddhist monk. And so,

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

madam, treasure these words in your memory: "He was a shampooer, a
gambler, a Buddhist monk."

*Vasantasenā*. Sir, you must not act too precipitately.

*Shampooer*. Madam, my mind is made up. \[*He walks about*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I gambled, and in gambling I did fall,  
  Till every one beheld me with dismay.  
Now I shall show my honest face to all,  
  And walk abroad upon the king's highway.<span
class="margnote">17</span>

</div>

\[*Tumultuous cries behind the scenes*.\]

*Shampooer*. \[*Listening*.\] What is this? What is this? \[*Addressing
some one behind the scenes*.\] What did you say? "Post-breaker,
Vasantasenā's rogue elephant, is at liberty!" Hurrah! I must go and see
the lady's best elephant. No, no! What have I to do with these things? I
must hold to my resolution.

\[*Exit*.

\[*Then enter hastily Karnapūraka, highly delighted, wearing a gorgeous
mantle*.\]

*Karnapūraka*. Where is she? Where is my mistress?

*Madanikā*. Insolent! What can it be that so excites you? You do not see
your mistress before your very eyes.

*Karnapūraka*. \[*Perceiving Vasantasenā*.\] Mistress, my service to
you.

*Vasantasenā*. Karnapūraka, your face is beaming. What is it?

*Karnapūraka*. \[*Proudly*.\] Oh, mistress! You missed it! You didn't
see Karnapūraka's heroism to-day!

*Vasantasenā*. What, Karnapūraka, what?

*Karnapūraka*. Listen. Post-breaker, my mistress’ rogue elephant, broke
the stake he was tied to, killed his keeper, and ran into the street,
making a terrible commotion. You should have heard the people shriek,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Take care of the babies, as quick as you can,  
  And climb up a roof or a tree! <span id="page_41">p. 41</span>  
The elephant rogue wants the blood of a man.  
  Escape! Run away! Can't you see?<span class="margnote">18</span>

</div>

And:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

How they lose their ankle-rings!  
Girdles, set with gems and things,  
Break away from fastenings!

As they stumble, trip, and blunder,  
See the bracelets snap asunder,  
Each a tangled, pearly wonder!<span class="margnote">19</span>

</div>

And that rogue of an elephant dives with his trunk and his feet and his
tusks into the city of Ujjayinī, as if it were a lotus-pond in full
flower. At last he comes upon a Buddhist monk. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42) And while the man's staff and his water
jar and his begging-bowl fly every which way, he drizzles water over him
and gets him between his tusks. The people see him and begin to shriek
again, crying "Oh, oh, the monk is killed!"

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Anxiously*.\] Oh, what carelessness, what
carelessness!

*Karnapūraka*. Don't be frightened. Just listen, mistress. Then, with a
big piece of the broken chain dangling about him, he picked him up,
picked up the monk between his tusks, and just then Karnapūraka saw him,
I saw him, no, no! the slave who grows fat on my mistress' rice-cakes
saw him, stumbled with his left foot over a gambler's score, grabbed up
an iron pole out of a shop, and challenged the mad elephant—

*Vasantasenā*. Go on! Go on!

*Karnap*. I hit him—in a fit of passion, too—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  He really looked like some great mountain peak.  
And from between those tusks of his I drew  
  The sacred hermit meek.<span class="margnote">20</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. Splendid, splendid! But go on!

*Karnapūraka*. Then, mistress, all Ujjayinī tipped over to one side,

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

like a ship loaded unevenly, and you could hear nothing but "Hurrah,
hurrah for Karnapūraka!" Then, mistress, a man touched the places where
he ought to have ornaments, and, finding that he hadn't any, looked up,
heaved a long sigh, and threw this mantle over me.

*Vasantasenā*. Find out, Karnapūraka, whether the mantle is perfumed
with jasmine or not.

*Karnapūraka*. Mistress, the elephant perfume is so strong that I can't
tell for sure.

*Vasantasenā*. Then look at the name.

*Karnapūraka*. Here is the name. You may read it, mistress. \[*He hands
her the mantle*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Reads*.\] Chārudatta. \[*She seizes the mantle eagerly
and wraps it about her*.\]

*Madanikā*. The mantle is very becoming to her, Karnapūraka.

*Karnapūraka*. Oh, yes, the mantle is becoming enough.

*Vasantasenā*. Here is your reward, Karnapūraka. \[*She gives him a
gem*.\]

*Karnapūraka*. \[*Taking it and bowing low*.\] Now the mantle is most
wonderfully becoming.

*Vasantasenā*. Karnapūraka, where is Chārudatta now?

*Karnapūraka*. He started to go home along this very street.

*Vasantasenā*. Come, girl! Let us go to the upper balcony and see
Chārudatta.

\[*Exeunt omnes*.
