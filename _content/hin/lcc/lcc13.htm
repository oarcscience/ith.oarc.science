<p><i>Maitreya</i>.</p>  
<p>HOW beautiful the old garden Pushpakaranda is.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. You are quite right, my friend. For see!<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The trees, like merchants, show their wares;<br> Each several tree his blossoms bears,<br> While bees, like officers, are flitting,<br> To take from each what toll is fitting.<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT></span></div></p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. This simple stone is very attractive. Pray be seated.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. [<i>Seats himself</i>.] How Vardham&#257;naka lingers, my friend!</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. I told Vardham&#257;naka to bring Vasantasen&#257; and come as quickly as he could.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Why then does he linger?<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Is he delayed by some slow-moving load?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Has he returned with broken wheel or traces?<br> Obstructions bid him seek another road?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His bullocks, or himself, choose these slow paces?<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT></span></div></p>  
<p>[<i>Enter Vardham&#257;naka with the bullock-cart, in which Aryaka lies hidden</i>.]</p>

<p>I have come a long distance from the city. Shall I get out of the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A></p>  
<p>cart and seek a hiding-place in the grove? or shall I wait to see the owner of the cart? On second thoughts, I will not hide myself in the grove; for men say that the noble Ch&#257;rudatta is ever helpful to them that seek his protection. I will not go until I have seen him face to face.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&#146;Twill bring contentment to that good man's heart<br> To see me rescued from misfortune's sea.<br> This body, in its suffering, pain, and smart,<br> Is saved through his sweet magnanimity.<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT></span></div></p>  
<p><i>Vardham&#257;naka</i>. Here is the garden. I'll drive in. [<i>He does so</i>.] Maitreya!</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Good news, my friend. It is Vardham&#257;naka's voice. Vasantasen&#257; must have come.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Good news, indeed.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. You son of a slave, what makes you so late?</p>  
<p><i>Vardham&#257;naka</i>. Don't get angry, good Maitreya. I remembered that I had forgotten the cushion, and I had to go back for it, and that is why I am late.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Turn the cart around, Vardham&#257;naka. Maitreya, my friend, help Vasantasen&#257; to get out.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Has she got fetters on her feet, so that she can't get out by herself? [<i>He rises and lifts the curtain of the cart</i>.] Why, this isn't mistress Vasantasen&#257;&#151;this is Mister Vasantasena.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. A truce to your jests, my friend. Love cannot wait. I will help her to get out myself. [<i>He rises</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. [<i>Discovers him</i>.] Ah, the owner of the bullock-cart! He is attractive not only to the ears of men, but also to their eyes. Thank heaven! I am safe.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. [<i>Enters the bullock-cart and discovers Aryaka</i>.] Who then is this?<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

<p>Who are you, sir?</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. I am one who seeks your protection, Aryaka, by birth a herdsman.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Are you he whom King P&#257;laka took from the hamlet where he lived and thrust into prison?</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. The same.</p>

<p>[<i>Aryaka manifests his joy</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Vardham&#257;naka, remove the fetters from his foot.</p>  
<p><i>Vardham&#257;naka</i>. Yes, sir. [<i>He does so</i>.] Master, the fetters are removed.</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. But you have bound me with yet stronger fetters of love.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Now you may put on the fetters yourself. He is free anyway. And it's time for us to be going.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Peace! For shame!</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. Ch&#257;rudatta, my friend, I entered your cart somewhat unceremoniously. I beg your pardon.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. I feel honored that you should use no ceremony with me.</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. If you permit it, I now desire to go.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Go in peace.</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. Thank you. I will alight from the cart.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. No, my friend. The fetters have but this moment been removed, and you will find walking difficult. In this spot</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></p>  
<p>where men seek pleasure, a bullock-cart will excite no suspicion. Continue your journey then in the cart.</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. I thank you, sir.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rud</i>. Seek now thy kinsmen. Happiness be thine!</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. Ah, I have found thee, bless&egrave;d kinsman mine!</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rud</i>. Remember me, when thou hast cause to speak.</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. Thy name, and not mine own, my words shall seek.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rud</i>. May the immortal gods protect thy ways!</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. Thou didst protect me, in most perilous days.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rud</i>. Nay, it was fate that sweet protection lent.</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. But thou wast chosen as fate's instrument.<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT></span></p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. King P&#257;laka is aroused, and protection will prove difficult. You must depart at once.</p>  
<p><i>Aryaka</i>. Until we meet again, farewell.</p>
