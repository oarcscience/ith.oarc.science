<p align="center">[<i>Enter a maid</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>.</p>  
<p>I AM sent with a message to my mistress by her mother. I must go in and find my mistress. [<i>She walks about and looks around her</i>.] There is my mistress. She is painting a picture, and putting her whole heart into it. I must go and speak to her.</p>  
<p>[<i>Then appear the love-lorn Vasantasen&#257;, seated, and Madanik&#257;</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Well, girl, and then&#151;</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. But mistress, you were not speaking of anything. What do you mean?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Why, what did I say?</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. You said, "and then"&#151;</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. [<i>Puckering her brows</i>.] Oh, yes. So I did.</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. [<i>Approaching</i>.] Mistress, your mother sends word that you should bathe and then offer worship to the gods.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. You may tell my mother that I shall not take the ceremonial bath to-day. A Brahman must offer worship in my place.</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. Yes, mistress.</p>  
<p align="right">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. My dear mistress, it is love, not naughtiness, that asks the question&#151;but what does this mean?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Tell me, Madanik&#257;. How do I seem to you?</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. My mistress is so absent-minded that I know her heart is filled with longing for somebody.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Well guessed. My Madanik&#257; is quick to fathom another's heart.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. I am very, very glad. Yes, K&#257;ma is indeed mighty, and</p>

<p>his great festival is welcome when one is young. But tell me, mistress, is it a king, or a king's favorite, whom you worship?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Girl, I wish to love, not to worship.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Is it a Brahman that excites your passion, some youth distinguished for very particular learning?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. A Brahman I should have to reverence.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Or is it some young merchant, grown enormously wealthy from visiting many cities?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. A merchant, girl, must go to other countries and leave you behind, no matter how much you love him. And the separation makes you very sad.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. It isn't a king, nor a favorite, nor a Brahman, nor a merchant. Who is it then that the princess loves?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Girl! Girl! You went with me to the park where K&#257;ma's temple stands?</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Yes, mistress.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. And yet you ask, as if you were a perfect stranger.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Now I know. Is it the man who comforted you when you asked to be protected?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Well, what was his name?</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Why, he lives in the merchants&#146; quarter.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. But I asked you for his name.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. His name, mistress, is a good omen in itself. His name is Ch&#257;rudatta.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. [<i>Joyfully</i>.] Good, Madanik&#257;, good. You have guessed it.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] So much for that. [<i>Aloud</i>.] Mistress, they say he is poor.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. That is the very reason why I love him. For a courtezan who sets her heart on a poor man is blameless in the eyes of the world.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_29"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 29</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. But mistress, do the butterflies visit the mango-tree when its blossoms have fallen?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. That is just why we call that sort of a girl a butterfly.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Well, mistress, if you love him, why don't you go and visit him at once?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Girl, if I should visit him at once, then, because he can't make any return&#151;no, I don't mean that, but it would be hard to see him.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Is that the reason why you left your jewels with him?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. You have guessed it.</p>

<p><i>Shampooer</i>. Yes, madam. When I was at home, I used to hear travelers tell tales, and I wanted to see new countries, and so I came here. And when I had come here to Ujjayin&#299;, I became the servant of a noble gentleman. Such a handsome, courteous gentleman! When he gave money away, he did not boast; when he was injured, he forgot it. To cut a long story short: he was so courteous that he regarded his own person as the possession of others, and had compassion on all who sought his protection.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Who may it be that adorns Ujjayin&#299; with the virtues which he has stolen from the object of my mistress&#146; desires?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Good, girl, good! I had the same thought in mind.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. But to continue, sir</p>  
<p><i>Shampooer</i>. Madam, he was so compassionate and so generous that now&#151;</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. His riches have vanished?</p>  
<p><i>Shampooer</i>. I didn't say it. How did you guess it, madam?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. What was there to guess? Virtue and money seldom keep company. In the pools from which men cannot drink there is so much the more water.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. But sir, what is his name?</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Shampooer</i>. Madam, who does not know the name of this moon of the whole world? He lives in the merchants&#146; quarter. He whose name is worthy of all honor is named Ch&#257;rudatta.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. [<i>Joyfully rising from her seat</i>.] Sir, this house is your own. Give him a seat, girl, and take this fan. The gentleman is weary. [<i>Madanik&#257; does as she is bid</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Shampooer</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] What! so much honor because I mentioned Ch&#257;rudatta's name? Heaven bless you, Ch&#257;rudatta! You are the only man in the world who really lives. All others merely breathe. [<i>He falls at Vasantasen&#257;'s feet</i>.] Enough, madam, enough. Pray be seated, madam.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. [Seating herself.] Where is he who is so richly your creditor, sir?</p>  
<p><i>Shamp</i>. The good man's wealth consists in kindly deeds;<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;All other wealth is vain and quickly flies.<br> The man who honors not his neighbor's needs,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Does that man know what honor signifies?<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT></span></div></p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. But to continue&#151;</p>  
<p><i>Shampooer</i>. So I became a servant in his employ. And when his wealth was reduced to his virtue, I began to live by gambling. But fate was cruel, and I lost ten gold-pieces.</p>  
<p><i>M&#257;thura</i>. I am ruined! I am robbed!</p>  
<p><i>Shampooer</i>. There are the gambling-master and the gambler, looking for me. You have heard my story, madam. The rest is your affair.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Madanik&#257;, the birds fly everywhither when the tree is shaken in which they have their nests. Go, girl, and give the gambling-master and the gambler this bracelet. And tell them that this gentleman sends it. [<i>She removes a bracelet from her arm, and gives it to Madanik&#257;</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. [<i>Receiving the bracelet</i>.] Yes, mistress. [<i>She goes out</i>.]</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>M&#257;thura</i>. I am ruined! I am robbed!</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Inasmuch as these two are looking up to heaven, and sighing, and chattering, and fastening their eyes on the door, I conclude that they must be the gambling-master and the gambler. [<i>Approaching</i>.] I salute you, sir.</p>  
<p><i>M&#257;thura</i>. May happiness be yours.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Sir, which of you is the gambling-master?</p>  
<p><i>M&#257;th</i>. O maiden, fair but something less than shy,<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;With red lip wounded in love's ardent play,<br> On whom is bent that sweet, coquettish eye?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For whom that lisp that steals the heart away?<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT></span><!-- paragraph continues --></div></p>  
<p>I haven't got any money. You'll have to look somewhere else.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. You are certainly no gambler, if you talk that way. Is there any one who owes you money?</p>  
<p><i>M&#257;thura</i>. There is. He owes ten gold-pieces. What of him?</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. In his behalf my mistress sends you this bracelet. No, no! He sends it himself.</p>  
<p><i>M&#257;thura</i>. [<i>Seizing it joyfully</i>.] Well, well, you may tell the noble youth that his account is squared. Let him come and seek delight again in gambling.</p>  
<p align="right">[<i>Exeunt M&#257;thura and the gambler</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. [<i>Returning to Vasantasen&#257;</i>.] Mistress, the gambling-master and the gambler have gone away well-pleased.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Go, sir, and comfort your kinsfolk.</p>  
<p><i>Shampooer</i>. Ah, madam, if it may be, these hands would gladly practise their art in your service.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. But sir, he for whose sake you mastered the art, who first received your service, he should have your service still.</p>  
<p><i>Shampooer</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] A very pretty way to decline my services. How shall I repay her kindness? [Aloud.] Madam, thus dishonored as a gambler, I shall become a Buddhist monk. And so,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A></p>  
<p>madam, treasure these words in your memory: "He was a shampooer, a gambler, a Buddhist monk."</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Sir, you must not act too precipitately.</p>  
<p><i>Shampooer</i>. Madam, my mind is made up. [<i>He walks about</i>.]<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">I gambled, and in gambling I did fall,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Till every one beheld me with dismay.<br> Now I shall show my honest face to all,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And walk abroad upon the king's highway.<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT></span></div></p>  
<p>[<i>Tumultuous cries behind the scenes</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Shampooer</i>. [<i>Listening</i>.] What is this? What is this? [<i>Addressing some one behind the scenes</i>.] What did you say? "Post-breaker, Vasantasen&#257;'s rogue elephant, is at liberty!" Hurrah! I must go and see the lady's best elephant. No, no! What have I to do with these things? I must hold to my resolution.</p>  
<p align="right">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>  
<p>[<i>Then enter hastily Karnap&#363;raka, highly delighted, wearing a gorgeous mantle</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. Where is she? Where is my mistress?</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. Insolent! What can it be that so excites you? You do not see your mistress before your very eyes.</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. [<i>Perceiving Vasantasen&#257;</i>.] Mistress, my service to you.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Karnap&#363;raka, your face is beaming. What is it?</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. [<i>Proudly</i>.] Oh, mistress! You missed it! You didn't see Karnap&#363;raka's heroism to-day!</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. What, Karnap&#363;raka, what?</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. Listen. Post-breaker, my mistress&#146; rogue elephant, broke the stake he was tied to, killed his keeper, and ran into the street, making a terrible commotion. You should have heard the people shriek,<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

<p>And that rogue of an elephant dives with his trunk and his feet and his tusks into the city of Ujjayin&#299;, as if it were a lotus-pond in full flower. At last he comes upon a Buddhist monk.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And while the man's staff and his water jar and his begging-bowl fly every which way, he drizzles water over him and gets him between his tusks.

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. [<i>Anxiously</i>.] Oh, what carelessness, what carelessness!</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. Don't be frightened. Just listen, mistress. Then, with a big piece of the broken chain dangling about him, he picked him up, picked up the monk between his tusks, and just then Karnap&#363;raka saw him, I saw him, no, no! the slave who grows fat on my mistress' rice-cakes saw him, stumbled with his left foot over a gambler's score, grabbed up an iron pole out of a shop, and challenged the mad elephant&#151;</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Go on! Go on!</p>  
<p><i>Karnap</i>. I hit him&#151;in a fit of passion, too&#151;<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;He really looked like some great mountain peak.<br> And from between those tusks of his I drew<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred hermit meek.<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT></span></div></p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Splendid, splendid! But go on!</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. Then, mistress, all Ujjayin&#299; tipped over to one side,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A></p>  
<p>like a ship loaded unevenly, and you could hear nothing but "Hurrah, hurrah for Karnap&#363;raka!" Then, mistress, a man touched the places where he ought to have ornaments, and, finding that he hadn't any, looked up, heaved a long sigh, and threw this mantle over me.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Find out, Karnap&#363;raka, whether the mantle is perfumed with jasmine or not.</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. Mistress, the elephant perfume is so strong that I can't tell for sure.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Then look at the name.</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. Here is the name. You may read it, mistress. [<i>He hands her the mantle</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. [<i>Reads</i>.] Ch&#257;rudatta. [<i>She seizes the mantle eagerly and wraps it about her</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Madanik&#257;</i>. The mantle is very becoming to her, Karnap&#363;raka.</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. Oh, yes, the mantle is becoming enough.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Here is your reward, Karnap&#363;raka. [<i>She gives him a gem</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. [<i>Taking it and bowing low</i>.] Now the mantle is most wonderfully becoming.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Karnap&#363;raka, where is Ch&#257;rudatta now?</p>  
<p><i>Karnap&#363;raka</i>. He started to go home along this very street.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Come, girl! Let us go to the upper balcony and see Ch&#257;rudatta.</p>
