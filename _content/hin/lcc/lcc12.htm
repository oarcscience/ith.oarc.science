<p><i>Maid</i>.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p>ISN'T my mistress awake yet? Well, I must go in and wake her. [<i>She walks about. Vasantasen&#257; appears, dressed, but still asleep. The maid discovers her</i>.] It is time to get up, mistress. The morning is here.</p>  
<p>Vasantasen&#257;. [<i>Awakening</i>.] What! is the night over? is it morning?</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. For us it is morning. But for my mistress it appears to be night still.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. But girl, where is your gambler?</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. Mistress, after giving Vardham&#257;naka his orders, Ch&#257;rudatta went to the old garden Pushpakaranda.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. What orders?</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. To have the bullock-cart ready before daylight; for, he said, Vasantasen&#257; was to come&#151;</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Where, girl?</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. Where Ch&#257;rudatta is.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. [<i>Embraces the maid</i>.] I did not have a good look at him in the evening. But to-day I shall see him face to face. Tell me, girl. Have I found my way into the inner court?</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. You have found your way not only into the inner court, but into the heart of every one who lives here.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Tell me, are Ch&#257;rudatta's servants vexed?</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. They will be.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. When?</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. When my mistress goes away.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. But not so much as I shall be. [<i>Persuasively</i>.] Here,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A></p>  
<p>girl, take this pearl necklace. You must go and give it to my lady sister, his good wife. And give her this message: "Worthy Ch&#257;rudatta's virtues have won me, made me his slave, and therefore your slave also. And so I hope that these pearls may adorn your neck."</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. But mistress, Ch&#257;rudatta will be angry with you.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Go. He will not be angry.</p>  
<p><i>Maid</i>. [<i>Takes the necklace</i>.] Yes, mistress. [<i>She goes out, then returns</i>.] Mistress, his lady wife says that her lord made you a present of it, and it would not be right for her to accept it. And further, that you are to know that her lord and husband is her most excellent adornment.</p>  
<p align="center">[<i>Enter Radanik&#257;, with Ch&#257;rudatta's little son</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Radanik&#257;</i>. Come, dear, let's play with your little cart.</p>  
<p><i>Rohasena</i>. [<i>Peevishly</i>.] I don't like this little clay cart, Radanik&#257;. Give me my gold cart.</p>  
<p><i>Radanik&#257;</i>. [<i>Sighing wearily</i>.] How should we have anything to do with gold now, my child? When your papa is rich again, then you shall have a gold cart to play with. But I'll amuse him by taking him to see Vasantasen&#257;. [<i>She approaches Vasantasen&#257;</i>.] Mistress, my service to you.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. I am glad to see you, Radanik&#257;. But whose little boy is this? He wears no ornaments, yet his dear little face makes my heart happy.</p>  
<p><i>Radanik&#257;</i>. This is Ch&#257;rudatta's son, Rohasena.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. [<i>Stretches out her arms</i>.] Come, my boy, and put your little arms around me. [<i>She takes him on her lap</i>.] He looks just like his father.</p>  
<p><i>Radanik&#257;</i>. More than looks like him, he is like him. At least I think so. His father is perfectly devoted to him.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. But what is he crying about?</p>  
<p><i>Radanik&#257;</i>. He used to play with a gold cart that belongs to the son of a neighbor. But that was taken away, and when he asked</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A></p>  
<p>for it, I made him this little clay cart. But when I gave it to him, he said "I don't like this little clay cart, Radanik&#257;. Give me my gold cart."</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Oh, dear! To think that this little fellow has to suffer because others are wealthy. Ah, mighty Fate! the destinies of men, uncertain as the water-drops which fall upon a lotus-leaf, seem to thee but playthings! [<i>Tearfully</i>.] Don't cry, my child. You shall have a gold cart to play with.</p>  
<p><i>Rohasena</i>. Who is she, Radanik&#257;?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. A slave of your father's, won by his virtues.</p>  
<p><i>Radanik&#257;</i>. My child, the lady is your mother.</p>  
<p><i>Rohasena</i>. That's a lie, Radanik&#257;. If the lady is my mother, why does she wear those pretty ornaments?</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. My child, your innocent lips can say terrible things. [<i>She removes her ornaments. Weeping</i>.] Now I am your mother. You shall take these ornaments and have a gold cart made for you.</p>  
<p><i>Rohasena</i>. Go away! I won't take them. You're crying.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. [<i>Wiping away her tears</i>.] I'll not cry, dear. There! go and play. [<i>She fills the clay cart with her jewels</i>.] There, dear, you must have a little gold cart made for you.</p>  
<p align="right">[<i>Exit Radanik&#257;, with Rohasena</i>.</p>

<p><i>Radanik&#257;</i>. [<i>Entering</i>.] Mistress, Vardham&#257;naka is here, and he says that the cart is waiting at the side-door.</p>  
<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. He must wait a minute, girl, while I get ready.</p>  
<p><i>Rad</i>. Wait a minute, Vardham&#257;naka, while she gets ready.</p>  
<p align="right">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Vardham&#257;naka</i>. Hello, I've forgotten the cushion. I must go and get it. But the nose-rope makes the bullocks skittish. I suppose I had better take the cart along with me.</p>

<p><i>Sth&#257;varaka</i>. Sansth&#257;naka, the king's brother-in-law, said to me "Take a bullock-cart, Sth&#257;varaka, and come as quick as you can to the old garden Pushpakaranda." Well, I'm on my way there. Get up, bullocks, get up! [<i>He drives about and looks around</i>.] Why, the road is blocked with villagers' carts. What am I to do now? [<i>Haughtily</i>.] Get out of my way, you! Get out of my way! [<i>He listens</i>.] What's that? you want to know whose cart this is? This cart belongs to Sansth&#257;naka, the king's brother-in-law. So get out of my way&#151;and this minute, too! [<i>He looks about</i>.] Why, here's a man going in the other direction as fast as he can. He is trying to hide like a runaway gambler, and he looks at me as if I were the gambling-master. I wonder who he is. But then, what business is it of mine? I must get there as soon as I can. Get out of my way, you villagers, get out of my way! What's that? you want me to wait a minute and put a shoulder to your wheel? Confound you! A brave man like me, that serves Sansth&#257;naka, the king's brother-in-law, put a shoulder to your wheel? After all, the poor fellow is quite alone. I'll do it. I'll stop my cart at the side-door to Ch&#257;rudatta's orchard. [<i>He does so</i>.] I'm coming!</p>  
<p align="right">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>

<p><i>Maid</i>. Follow me, mistress.</p>

<p><i>A voice behind the scenes</i>. Police! Police! Every man at his post! The young herdsman has just broken jail, killed the jailer, broken his fetters, escaped, and run away. Catch him! Catch him!</p>

<p><i>V&#299;raka</i>. Chandanaka, I have my suspicions.</p>  
<p><i>Chandanaka</i>. Suspicions? How so?</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>V&#299;r</i>. You gurgled in your craven throat; it seems a trifle shady. You said "I saw the gentleman," and then "I saw the lady." That's why I'm not satisfied.</p>  
<p><i>Chandanaka</i>. What's the matter with you, man? We southerners don't speak plain. We know a thousand dialects of the barbarians&#151;the Khashas, the Khattis, the Kadas, the Kadatthobilas, the Karn&#257;tas, the Karnas, the Pr&#257;varanas, the Dr&#257;vidas, the Cholas, the Ch&#299;nas, the Barbaras, the Kheras, the Kh&#257;nas, the Mukhas, the Madhugh&#257;tas, and all the rest of &#146;em, and it all depends on the way we feel whether we say "he" or "she," "gentleman" or "lady."</p>  
<p><i>V&#299;raka</i>. Can't I have a look, too? It's the king's orders. And the king trusts me.</p>  
<p><i>Chandanaka</i>. I suppose the king doesn't trust me!</p>  
<p><i>V&#299;raka</i>. Isn't it His Majesty's command?</p>  
<p><i>Chandanaka</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] If people knew that the good herdsman escaped in Ch&#257;rudatta's cart, then the king would make Ch&#257;rudatta suffer for it. What's to be done? [<i>Reflecting</i>.] I'll stir up a quarrel the way they do down in the Carnatic. [<i>Aloud</i>.] Well, V&#299;raka, I made one inspection myself&#151;my name is Chandanaka&#151;and you want to do it over again. Who are you?</p>  
<p><i>V&#299;raka</i>. Confound it! Who are you, anyway?</p>
