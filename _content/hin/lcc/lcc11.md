### ACT THE FIFTH

#### THE STORM

\[*The love-lorn Chārudatta appears, seated*.\]

*Chārudatta*. \[*Looks up*.\]

AN untimely storm <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59) is gathering. For
see!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The peacocks gaze and lift their fans on high;  
  The swans forget their purpose to depart;  
The untimely storm afflicts the blackened sky,  
  And the wistful lover's heart.<span class="margnote">1</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The wet bull's belly wears no deeper dye;  
  In flashing lightning's golden mantle clad,  
  While cranes, his buglers, make the heaven glad,  
The cloud, a second Vishnu, <span id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60) mounts
the sky.<span class="margnote">2</span>

</div>

And yet again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As dark as Vishnu's form, with circling cranes  
To trumpet him, instead of bugle strains,  
  And garmented in lightning's silken robe,  
Approaches now the harbinger of rains.<span class="margnote">3</span>

When lightning's lamp is lit, the silver river  
  Impetuous falls from out the cloudy womb;  
  Like severed lace from heaven-cloaking gloom,  
It gleams an instant, then is gone forever.<span
class="margnote">4</span>

Like shoaling fishes, or like dolphins shy,  
Or like to swans, toward heaven's vault that fly,  
  Like paired flamingos, male and mate together,  
Like mighty pinnacles that tower on high, <span id="page_76">p.
76</span>  
  In thousand forms the tumbling clouds embrace,  
  Though torn by winds, they gather, interlace,  
And paint the ample canvas of the sky.<span class="margnote">5</span>

The sky is black as Dhritarāshtra's face;  
Proud as the champion of Kuru's race,  
  The haughty peacock shrills his joy abroad;  
The cuckoo, in Yudhishthira's sad case,  
  Is forced to wander if he would not die;  
  The swans must leave their forest-homes and fly,  
Like Pāndu's sons, to seek an unknown place.<span
class="margnote">6</span>

</div>

\[*Reflecting*.\] It is long since Maitreya went to visit Vasantasenā.
And even yet he does not come.

\[*Enter Maitreya*.\]

*Maitreya*. Confound the courtezan's avarice and her incivility! To
think of her making so short a story of it! Over and over she repeats
something about the affection she feels, and then without more ado she
pockets the necklace. She is rich enough so that she might at least have
said: "Good Maitreya, rest a little. You must not go until you have had
a cup to drink." Confound the courtezan! I hope I'll never set eyes on
her again. \[*Wearily*.\] The proverb is right. " It is hard to find a
lotus-plant without a root, a merchant who never cheats, a goldsmith who
never steals, a village-gathering without a fight, and a courtezan
without avarice." Well, I'll find my friend and persuade him to have
nothing more to do with this courtezan. \[*He walks about until he
discovers Chārudatta*.\] Ah, my good friend is sitting in the orchard.
I'll go to him. \[*Approaching*.\] Heaven bless you! May happiness be
yours.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Looking up*.\] Ah, my friend Maitreya has returned. You
are very welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.

*Maitreya*. Thank you.

*Chārudatta*. Tell me of your errand, my friend.

*Maitreya*. My errand went all wrong.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

*Chārudatta*. What! did she not accept the necklace?

*Maitreya*. How could we expect such a piece of luck? She put her
lotus-tender hands to her brow, <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61) and
took it.

*Chārudatta*. Then why do you say "went wrong"?

*Maitreya*. Why not, when we lost a necklace that was the pride of the
four seas for a cheap golden casket, that was stolen before we had a
bite or a drink out of it?

*Chārudatta*. Not so, my friend.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

She showed her trust in leaving us her treasure;  
The price of confidence has no less measure.<span
class="margnote">7</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. Now look here! I have a second grievance. She tipped her
friend the wink, covered her face with the hem of her dress, and laughed
at me. And so, Brahman though I am, I hereby fall on my face before you
and beg you not to have anything more to do with this courtezan. That
sort of society does any amount of damage. A courtezan is like a pebble
in your shoe. It hurts before you get rid of it. And one thing more, my
friend. A courtezan, an elephant, a scribe, a mendicant friar, a
swindler, and an ass—where these dwell, not even rogues are born.

*Chārudatta*. Oh, my friend, a truce to all your detraction! My poverty
of itself prevents me. For consider:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The horse would gladly hasten here and there,  
  But his legs fail him, for his breath departs.  
So men's vain wishes wander everywhere,  
  Then, weary grown, return into their hearts.<span
class="margnote">8</span>

</div>

Then too, my friend:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If wealth is thine, the maid is thine,  
  For maids are won by gold;

\[*Aside*. And not by virtue cold. *Aloud*.\]

But wealth is now no longer mine,  
  And her I may not hold.<span class="margnote">9</span>

</div>

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

*Maitreya*. \[*Looks down. Aside*.\] From the way he looks up and sighs,
I conclude that my effort to distract him has simply increased his
longing. The proverb is right. "You can't reason with a lover."
\[*Aloud*.\] Well, she told me to tell you that she would have to come
here this evening. I suppose she isn't satisfied with the necklace and
is coming to look for something else.

*Chārudatta*. Let her come, my friend. She shall not depart unsatisfied.

\[*Enter Kumbhīlaka*.\]

*Kumbhīlaka*. Listen, good people.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The more it rains in sheets,  
  The more my skin gets wet;  
The more the cold wind beats,  
  The more I shake and fret.<span class="margnote">10</span>

</div>

\[*He bursts out laughing*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I make the sweet flute speak from seven holes,  
  I make the loud lute speak on seven strings;  
In singing, I essay the donkey's rôles:  
  No god can match my music when he sings.<span
class="margnote">11</span>

</div>

My mistress Vasantasenā said to me "Kumbhīlaka, go and tell Chārudatta
that I am coming." So here I am, on my way to Chārudatta's house. \[*He
walks about, and, as he enters, discovers Chārudatta*.\] Here is
Chārudatta in the orchard. And here is that wretched jackanapes, too.
Well, I'll go up to them. What! the orchard-gate is shut? Good! I'll
give this jackanapes a hint. \[*He throws lumps of mud*.\]

*Maitreya*. Well! Who is this pelting me with mud, as if I were an
apple-tree inside of a fence?

*Chārudatta*. Doubtless the pigeons that play on the roof of the
garden-house.

*Maitreya*. Wait a minute, you confounded pigeon! With this stick I'll
bring you down from the roof to the ground, like an over-ripe mango.
\[*He raises his stick and starts to run*.\]

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

*Chārudatta*. \[*Holding him back by the sacred cord*.\] Sit down, my
friend. What do you mean? Leave the poor pigeon alone with his mate.

*Kumbhīlaka*. What! he sees the pigeon and doesn't see me? Good! I'll
hit him again with another lump of mud. \[*He does so*.\]

*Maitreya*. \[*Looks about him*.\] What! Kumbhīlaka? I'll be with you in
a minute. \[*He approaches and opens the gate*.\] Well, Kumbhīlaka, come
in. I'm glad to see you.

*Kumbhīlaka*. \[*Enters*.\] I salute you, sir.

*Maitreya*. Where do you come from, man, in this rain and darkness?

*Kumbhīlaka*. You see, she's here.

*Maitreya*. Who's she? Who's here?

*Kumbhīlaka*. She. See? She.

*Maitreya*. Look here, you son of a slave! What makes you sigh like a
half-starved old beggar in a famine, with your "shesheshe"?

*Kumbhīlaka*. And what makes you hoot like an owl with your "whowhowho"?

*Maitreya*. All right. Tell me.

*Kumbhīlaka*. \[*Aside*.\] Suppose I say it this way. \[*Aloud*.\] I'll
give you a riddle, man.

*Maitreya*. And I'll give you the answer with my foot on your bald spot.

*Kumbhīlaka*. Not till you've guessed it. In what season do the
mango-trees blossom?

*Maitreya*. In summer, you jackass.

*Kumbhīlaka*. \[*Laughing*.\] Wrong!

*Maitreya*. \[*Aside*.\] What shall I say now? \[*Reflecting*.\] Good!
I'll go and ask Chārudatta. \[*Aloud*.\] Just wait a moment.
\[*Approaching Chārudatta*.\] My friend, I just wanted to ask you in
what season the mango-trees blossom.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

*Chārudatta*. You fool, in spring, in *vasanta*.

*Maitreya*. \[*Returns to Kumbhīlaka*.\] You fool, in spring, in
*vasanta*.

*Kumbhīlaka*. Now I'll give you another. Who guards thriving villages?

*Maitreya*. Why, the guard.

*Kumbhīlaka*. \[*Laughing*.\] Wrong!

*Maitreya*. Well, I'm stuck. \[*Reflecting*.\] Good! I'll ask Chārudatta
again. \[*He returns and puts the question to Chārudatta*.\]

Chārudatta. The army, my friend, the *senā*.

Maitreya. \[*Comes back to Kumbhīlaka*.\] The army, you jackass, the
*senā*.

*Kumbhīlaka*. Now put the two together and say ‘em fast.

*Maitreya*. Senā-vasanta.

*Kumbhīlaka*. Say it turned around.

*Maitreya*. \[*Turns around*.\] Senā-vasanta.

*Kumbhīlaka*. You fool! you jackanapes! Turn the parts of the thing
around!

*Maitreya*. \[*Turns his feet around*.\] Senā-vasanta.

*Kumbhīlaka*. You fool! Turn the parts of the word around!

*Maitreya*. \[*After reflection*.\] Vasanta-senā.

*Kumbhīlaka*. She's here.

*Maitreya*. Then I must tell Chārudatta. \[*Approaching*.\] Well,
Chārudatta, your creditor is here.

*Chārudatta*. How should a creditor come into my family?

*Maitreya*. Not in the family perhaps, but at the door. Vasantasenā is
here.

*Chārudatta*. Why do you deceive me, my friend?

*Maitreya*. If you can't trust me, then ask Kumbhīlaka here. Kumbhīlaka,
you jackass, come here.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

*Kumbhīlaka*. \[*Approaching*.\] I salute you, sir.

*Chārudatta*. You are welcome, my good fellow. Tell me, is Vasantasenā
really here?

*Kumbhīlaka*. Yes, she's here. Vasantasenā is here.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Joyfully*.\] My good fellow, I have never let the
bearer of welcome news go unrewarded. Take this as your recompense.
\[*He gives him his mantle*.\]

*Kumbhīlaka*. \[*Takes it and bows. Gleefully*.\] I'll tell my mistress.

\[*Exit*.

*Maitreya*. Do you see why she comes in a storm like this?

*Chārudatta*. I do not quite understand, my friend.

*Maitreya*. I know. She has an idea that the pearl necklace is cheap,
and the golden casket expensive. She isn't satisfied, and she has come
to look for something more.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Aside*.\] She shall not depart unsatisfied.

\[*Then enter the love-lorn Vasantasenā, in a splendid garment, fit for
a woman who goes to meet her lover, a maid with an umbrella, and the
courtier*.\]

*Courtier*. \[*Referring to Vasantasenā*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lakshmī <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62) without the lotus-flower is
she,  
  Loveliest arrow of god Kāma's bow, <span
id="fr_63"></span>[2](#fn_63)  
The sweetest blossom on love's magic tree.

See how she moves, so gracefully and slow!  
  In passion's hour she still loves modesty;  
In her, good wives their dearest sorrow know.

When passion's drama shall enacted be,  
  When on love's stage appears the passing show,  
  A host of wanderers shall bend them low,  
Glad to be slaves in such captivity.<span class="margnote">12</span>

</div>

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

See, Vasantasenā, see!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The clouds hang drooping to the mountain peaks,  
Like a maiden's heart, that distant lover seeks:  
The peacocks startle, when the thunder booms,  
And fan the heaven with all their jeweled plumes.<span
class="margnote">13</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mud-stained, and pelted by the streaming rain,  
To drink the falling drops the frogs are fain;  
Full-throated peacocks love's shrill passion show,  
And nīpa flowers like brilliant candles glow;  
Unfaithful clouds obscure the hostage moon,  
Like knaves, unworthy of so dear a boon;  
Like some poor maid of better breeding bare,  
The impatient lightning rests not anywhere.<span
class="margnote">14</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. <span id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64) Sir, what you say is
most true. For

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The night, an angry rival, bars my way;  
Her thunders fain would check and hinder me:  
"Fond fool! with him I love thou shalt not stay,  
’Tis I, ’tis I, he loves," she seems to say,  
"Nor from my swelling bosom shall he flee."<span
class="margnote">15</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. Yes, yes. That is right. Scold the night.

*Vasantasenā*. And yet, sir, why scold one who is so ignorant of woman's
nature? For you must remember:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The clouds may rain, may thunder ne’er so bold,  
  May flash the lightning from the sky above;  
That woman little reeks of heat or cold,  
  Who journeys to her love.<span class="margnote">16</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. But see, Vasantasenā! Another cloud,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Sped by the fickle fury of the air  
  A flood of arrows in his rushing streams,  
His drum, the roaring thunder's mighty blare,  
  His banner, living lightning's awful gleams—<span id="page_83">p.
83</span>

Rages within the sky, and shows him bold  
  ’Mid beams that to the moon allegiance owe,  
Like a hero-king within the hostile hold  
  Of his unwarlike foe.<span class="margnote">17</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. True, true. And more than this:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As dark as elephants, these clouds alone  
  Fall like a cruel dart—  
With streaks of lightning and with white birds strewn—  
  To wound my wretched heart.  
But, oh, why should the heron, bird of doom,  
  With that perfidious sound <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65)  
Of "Rain! Rain! Rain!"—grim summons to the tomb  
  For her who spends her lonely hours in gloom—  
Strew salt upon the wound?<span class="margnote">18</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. Very true, Vasantasenā. And yet again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It seems as if the sky would take the guise  
  Of some fierce elephant to service bred;  
The lightning like a waving streamer flies,  
  And white cranes serve to deck his mighty head.<span
class="margnote">19</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. But look, sir, look!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Clouds, black as wet tamāla-leaves, the ball  
  Of heaven hide from our sight;  
Rain-smitten homes of ants decay and fall  
  Like beasts that arrows smite;  
Like golden lamps within a lordly hall  
  Wander the lightnings bright;  
As when men steal the wife of some base thrall,  
Clouds rob the moon of light.<span class="margnote">20</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. See, Vasantasenā, see!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Clouds, harnessed in the lightning's gleams,  
  Like charging elephants dash by; <span id="page_84">p. 84</span>  
At Indra's bidding, pour their streams,  
Until with silver cords it seems  
  That earth is linked with sky.<span class="margnote">21</span>

</div>

And look yonder!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As herds of buffaloes the clouds are black;  
  The winds deny them ease;  
They fly on lightning wings and little lack  
  Of seeming troubled seas.

Smitten with falling drops, the fragrant sod,  
Upon whose bosom greenest grasses nod,  
Seems pierced with pearls, each pearl an arrowy rod.<span
class="margnote">22</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. And here is yet another cloud.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The peacock's shrill-voiced cry  
Implores it to draw nigh;  
And ardent cranes on high  
Embrace it lovingly.

The wistful swans espy  
The lotus-sweeter sky;  
The darkest colors lie  
On heaven clingingly.<span class="margnote">23</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. True. For see!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A thousand lotuses that bloom by night,  
A thousand blooming when the day is bright,  
Nor close nor ope their eyes to heaven's sight;  
  There is no night nor day.

The face of heaven, thus shrouded in the night,  
Is only for a single instant bright,  
When momentary lightning gives us sight;  
  Else is it dark alway.

Now sleeps the world as still as in the night  
Within the house of rain where naught is bright, <span id="page_85">p.
85</span>  
Where hosts of swollen clouds seem to our sight  
  One covering veil of gray.<span class="margnote">24</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. True. And see!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The stars are lost like mercies given  
  To men of evil heart;  
Like lonely-parted wives, the heaven  
  Sees all her charms depart.  
And, molten in the cruel heat  
  Of Indra's bolt, it seems  
As if the sky fell at our feet  
  In liquid, flowing streams.<span class="margnote">25</span>

</div>

And yet again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The clouds first darkly rise, then darkly fall,  
Send forth their floods of rain, and thunder all;  
Assuming postures strange and manifold,  
Like men but newly blest with wealth untold.<span
class="margnote">26</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. True.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The heaven is radiant with the lightning's glare;  
  Its laughter is the cry of myriad cranes;  
Its voice, the bolts that whistle through the air;  
  Its dance, that bow whose arrows are the rains.  
It staggers at the winds, and seems to smoke  
With clouds, which form its black and snaky cloak.<span
class="margnote">27</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. O shameless, shameless sky!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

      To thunder thus, while I  
      To him I love draw nigh.  
Why do thy thunders frighten me and pain?  
Why am I seized upon by hands of rain?<span class="margnote">28</span>

</div>

O Indra, mighty Indra!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Did I then give thee of my love before,  
That now thy clouds like mighty lions roar?  
Ah no! Thou shouldst not send thy streaming rain,  
To fill my journey to my love with pain.<span class="margnote">29</span>

</div>

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

Remember:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For Ahalyā's sweet sake thou once didst lie;  
  Thou knowest lover's pain.  
As thou didst suffer then, now suffer I;  
  O cruel, cease thy rain.<span class="margnote">30</span>

</div>

And yet:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thunder and rain and lighten hundredfold  
  Forth from thy sky above;  
The woman canst thou not delay nor hold  
  Who journeys to her love.<span class="margnote">31</span>

Let thunders roar, for men were cruel ever;  
But oh, thou maiden lightning! didst thou never  
Know pains that maidens know?<span class="margnote">32</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. But mistress, do not scold the lightning. She is your
friend,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

This golden cord that trembles on the breast  
Of great Airāvata; <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66) upon the crest  
  Of rocky hills this banner all ablaze;  
This lamp in Indra's palace; but most blest  
  As telling where your most belovèd stays.<span
class="margnote">33</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. And here, sir, is his house.

*Courtier*. You know all the arts, and need no instruction now. Yet love
bids me prattle. When you enter here, you must not show yourself too
angry.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Where anger is, there love is not;  
Or no! except for anger hot,  
  There is no love.

Be angry! make him angry then!  
Be kind! and make him kind again  
  The man you love.<span class="margnote">34</span>

</div>

So much for that. Who is there? Let Chārudatta know, that

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

While clouds look beautiful, and in the hour  
Fragrant with nīpa and kadamba flower,  
She comes to see her lover, very wet,  
With dripping locks, but pleased and loving yet.  
Though lightning and though thunder terrifies,  
She comes to see you; ’tis for you she sighs.  
The mud still soils the anklets on her feet,  
But in a moment she will have them sweet.<span
class="margnote">35</span>

</div>

*Chārudatta*. \[*Listening*.\] My friend, pray discover what this means.

*Maitreya*. Yes, sir. \[*He approaches Vasantasenā. Respectfully*.\]
Heaven bless you!

*Vasantasenā*. I salute you, sir. I am very glad to see you. \[*To the
courtier*.\] Sir, the maid with the umbrella is at your service.

*Courtier*. \[*Aside*.\] A very clever way to get rid of me.
\[*Aloud*.\] Thank you. And mistress Vasantasenā,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Pride and tricks and lies and fraud  
  Are in your face;  
False playground of the lustful god,  
  Such is your face;  
The wench's stock in trade, in fine,  
  Epitome of joys divine,  
I mean, your face  
  For sale! the price is courtesy.  
I trust you'll find a man to buy  
  Your face.<span class="margnote">36</span>

</div>

\[*Exit*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. Good Maitreya, where is your gambler?

*Maitreya*. \[*Aside*.\] "Gambler"? Ah, she's paying a compliment to my
friend. \[*Aloud*.\] Madam, here he is in the dry orchard.

*Vasantasenā*. But sir, what do you call a dry orchard?

*Maitreya*. Madam, it's a place where there's nothing to eat or drink.
\[*Vasantasenā smiles*.\] Pray enter, madam.

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Aside to her maid*.\] What shall I say when I enter?

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

*Maid*. "Gambler, what luck this evening?"

*Vasantasenā*. Shall I dare to say it?

*Maid*. When the time comes, it will say itself.

*Maitreya*. Enter, madam.

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Enters, approaches Chārudatta, and strikes him with
the flowers which she holds*.\] Well, gambler, what luck this evening?

*Chārudatta*. \[*Discovers her*.\] Ah, Vasantasenā is here. \[*He rises
joyfully*.\] Oh, my belovèd,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My evenings pass in watching ever,  
  My nights from sighs are never free;  
This evening cannot else than sever  
  In bringing you—my grief and me.<span class="margnote">37</span>

</div>

You are very, very welcome. Here is a seat. Pray be seated.

*Maitreya*. Here is a seat. Be seated, madam. \[*Vasantasenā sits, then
the others*.\]

*Chārudatta*. But see, my friend,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The dripping flower that decks her ear, droops down,  
               And one sweet breast  
Anointed is, like a prince who wears the crown,  
               With ointment blest.<span class="margnote">38</span>

</div>

My friend, Vasantasenā's garments are wet. Let other, and most
beautiful, garments be brought.

*Maitreya*. Yes, sir.

*Maid*. Good Maitreya, do you stay here. I will wait upon my mistress.
\[*She does so*.\]

*Maitreya*. \[*Aside to Chārudatta*.\] My friend, I'd just like to ask
the lady a question.

*Chārudatta*. Then do so.

*Maitreya*. \[*Aloud*.\] Madam, what made you come here, when it is so
stormy and dark that you can't see the moon?

*Maid*. Mistress, the Brahman is very plain-spoken.

*Vasantasenā*. You might better call him clever.

*Maid*. My mistress came to ask how much that pearl necklace is worth.

*Maitreya*. \[*Aside to Chārudatta*.\] There! I told you so. She thinks
the pearl necklace is cheap, and the golden casket is expensive. She
isn't satisfied. She has come to look for something more. Maid. For my
mistress imagined that it was her own, and gambled it away. And nobody
knows where the gambling-master has gone, for he is employed in the
king's business.

*Maitreya*. Madam, you are simply repeating what somebody said before.

*Maid*. While we are looking for him, pray take this golden casket.
\[*She displays the casket. Maitreya hesitates*.\] Sir, you examine it
very closely. Did you ever see it before?

*Maitreya*. No, madam, but the skilful workmanship captivates the eye.

*Maid*. Your eyes deceive you, sir. This is the golden casket.

*Maitreya*. \[*Joyfully*.\] Well, my friend, here is the golden casket,
the very one that thieves stole from our house.

*Chārudatta*. My friend,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The artifice we tried before,  
Her stolen treasure to restore,  
Is practised now on us. But no,  
I cannot think ’tis really so.<span class="margnote">39</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. But it is so. I swear it on my Brahmanhood.

*Chārudatta*. This is welcome news.

*Maitreya*. \[*Aside to Chārudatta*.\] I'm going to ask where they found
it.

*Chārudatta*. I see no harm in that.

*Maitreya*. \[*Whispers in the maid's ear*.\] There!

*Maid*. \[*Whispers in Maitreya's ear*.\] So there!

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

*Chārudatta*. What is it? and why are we left out?

*Maitreya*. \[*Whispers in Chārudatta's ear*.\] So there!

*Chārudatta*. My good girl, is this really the same golden casket?

*Maid*. Yes, sir, the very same.

*Chārudatta*. My good girl, I have never let the bearer of welcome news
go unrewarded. Take this ring as your recompense. \[*He looks at his
finger, notices that the ring is gone, and betrays his embarrassment*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. \[*To herself*.\] I love you for that.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Aside to Maitreya*.\] Alas,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When in this world a man has lost his all,  
  Why should he set his heart on longer life?  
His angers and his favors fruitless fall,  
  His purposes and powers are all at strife.<span
class="margnote">40</span>

Like wingless birds, dry pools, or withered trees,  
Like fangless snakes—the poor are like to these.<span
class="margnote">41</span>

Like man-deserted houses, blasted trees,  
Like empty wells—the poor are like to these.  
For them no pleasant hours serve happy ends;  
They are forgotten of their sometime friends.<span
class="margnote">42</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. But you must not grieve thus beyond reason. \[*He bursts out
laughing. Aloud*.\] Madam, please give me back my bath-clout.

*Vasantasenā*. Chārudatta, it was not right that you should show your
distrust of me by sending me this pearl necklace.

*Chārudatta*. \[*With an embarrassed smile*.\] But remember,
Vasantasenā,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Who will believe the truth?  
  Suspicion now is sure.  
This world will show no ruth  
  To the inglorious poor.<span class="margnote">43</span>

</div>

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

*Maitreya*. Tell me, girl, are you going to sleep here to-night?

*Maid*. \[*Laughing*.\] But good Maitreya, you show yourself most
remarkably plain-spoken now.

*Maitreya*. See, my friend, the rain enters again in great streams, as
if it wanted to drive people away when they are sitting comfortably
together.

*Chārudatta*. You are quite right.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The falling waters pierce the cloud,  
  As lotus-shoots the soil;  
And tears the face of heaven shroud,  
  Who weeps the moon's vain toil.<span class="margnote">44</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

In streams as pure as thoughts to good men given,  
  But merciless as darts that Arjun hurls,  
And black as Baladeva's cloak, the heaven  
  Seems to pour out all Indra's hoarded pearls.<span
class="margnote">45</span>

</div>

See, my belovèd, see!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The heaven is painted with the blackest dye,  
  And fanned by cool and fragrant evening airs;  
Red lightning, glad in union, clasps the sky  
With voluntary arms, and shows on high  
  The love that maiden heart to lover bears.<span
class="margnote">46</span>

</div>

\[*Vasantasenā betrays her passion, and throws her arms about
Chārudatta. Chārudatta feels her touch, and embraces her*.\]

*Chārudatta*. More grimly yet, O thunder, boom;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  For by thy grace and power  
My love-distracted limbs now bloom  
  Like the kadamba flower.  
  Her dear touch all my being thrills,  
And love my inmost spirit fills.<span class="margnote">47</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. Confound you, storm! You are no gentleman, to frighten the
lady with the lightning.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

Chārudatta. Do not rebuke the storm, my friend.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Let ceaseless rain a hundred years endure,  
  The lightning quiver, and the thunder peal;  
For what I deemed impossible is sure:  
  Her dear-loved arms about my neck I feel.<span
class="margnote">48</span>

</div>

And oh, my friend,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He only knows what riches are,  
Whose love comes to him from afar,  
Whose arms that dearest form enfold,  
While yet with rain ’tis wet and cold.<span class="margnote">49</span>

</div>

Vasantasenā, my belovèd,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The masonry is shaken; and so old  
The awning, that ’twill not much longer hold.  
Heavy with water is the painted wall,  
From which dissolving bits of mortar fall.<span
class="margnote">50</span>

</div>

\[*He looks up*.\] The rainbow! See, my belovèd, see!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

See how they yawn, the cloudy jaws of heaven,  
As by a tongue, by forkèd lightning riven;  
  And to the sky great Indra's fiery bow  
In lieu of high-uplifted arms is given.<span class="margnote">51</span>

</div>

Come, let us seek a shelter. \[*He rises and walks about*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

On palm-trees shrill,  
On thickets still,  
On boulders dashing,  
On waters splashing,  
Like a lute that, smitten, sings,  
The rainy music rings.<span class="margnote">52</span>

</div>

\[*Exeunt omnes*.
