### ACT THE NINTH

#### THE TRIAL

\[*Enter a beadle*.\]

*Beadle*.

THE magistrates said to me "Come, beadle, go to the courtroom, and make
ready the seats." So now I am on my way to set the court-room in order.
\[*He walks about and looks around him*.\] Here is the court-room. I
will enter. \[*He enters, sweeps, and puts a seat in its place*.\]
There! I have tidied up the court-room and put the seats in readiness,
and now I will go and tell the magistrates. \[*He walks about and looks
around him*.\] But see! Here comes that arrant knave, the king's
brother-in-law. I will go away without attracting his attention. \[*He
stands apart. Enter Sansthānaka, in gorgeous raiment*.\]

*Sansth*. I bathed where water runs and flows and purls;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I shat within a garden, park, and grove  
With women, and with females, and with girls,  
Whose lovely limbs with grace angelic move.<span
class="margnote">1</span>

My hair is shometimes done up tight, you shee;  
In locks, or curls, it hangs my forehead o’er;  
Shometimes ’tis matted, shometimes hanging free;

And then again, I wear a pompadour.  
I am a wonder, I'm a wondrous thing,  
And the husband of my shishter is the king.<span
class="margnote">2</span>

</div>

And beshides, I've found a big hole, like a worm that has crawled into
the knot of a lotush-root, and is looking for a hole to creep out at.
Now who was I going to accuse of thish wicked deed? \[*He recalls
something*.\] Oh, yesh! I remember. I was going to accuse poor
Chārudatta of thish wicked deed. Beshides, he's poor. They'll believe
anything about him. Good! I'll go to the court-room and lodge a public
complaint against Chārudatta, how he shtrangled

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

Vasantasenā and murdered her. Sho now I'm on my way to the court-room.
\[He walks about and looks around him.\] Here is the court-room. I'll go
in. \[He enters and looks about.\] Well, here are the sheats, all
arranged. While I'm waiting for the magishtrates, I'll jusht sit down a
minute on the grass. \[*He does so*.\]

*Beadle*. \[*Walks about in another direction, and looks before him*.\]
Here come the magistrates. I will go to them. \[*He does so*.\]

\[*Enter the judge, accompanied by a gild-warden, a clerk, and
others*.\]

*Judge*. Gild-warden and clerk!

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. We await your bidding.

*Judge*. A trial depends to such an extent upon others that the task of
the magistrates—the reading of another's thoughts—is most difficult.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Men often speak of deeds that no man saw,  
Matters beyond the province of the law;  
Passion so rules the parties that their lies  
Hide their offenses from judicial eyes;  
This side and that exaggerate a thing,  
Until at last it implicates the king;  
To sum it up: false blame is easy won,  
A true judge little praised, or praised by none.<span
class="margnote">3</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Men often point to sins that no man saw,  
And in their anger scorn the patient law;  
In court-rooms even the righteous with their lies  
Hide their offenses from judicial eyes;  
And those who did the deed are lost to view,  
Who sinned with plaintiff and defendant too;  
To sum it up: false blame is easy won,  
A true judge little praised, or praised by none.<span
class="margnote">4</span>

</div>

For the judge must be

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Learnèd, and skilled in tracing fraud's sly path,  
And eloquent, insensible to wrath; <span id="page_134">p. 134</span>  
To friend, foe, kinsman showing equal grace,  
Reserving judgment till he know the case;  
Untouched by avarice, in virtue sound,  
The weak he must defend, the knave confound;  
An open door to truth, his heart must cling  
To others' interests, yet shun each thing  
That might awake the anger of the king.<span class="margnote">5</span>

</div>

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. And do men speak of defects in your virtue? If
so, then they speak of darkness in the moonlight.

*Judge*. My good beadle, conduct me to the court-room.

*Beadle*. Follow me, Your Honor. \[*They walk about*.\] Here is the
court-room. May the magistrates be pleased to enter. \[*All enter*.\]
Judge. My good beadle, do you go outside and learn who desires to
present a case.

*Beadle*. Yes, sir. \[*He goes out*.\] Gentlemen, the magistrates ask if
there is any here who desires to present a case.

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Gleefully*.\] The magishtrates are here. \[*He struts
about*.\] I desire to present a cashe, I, an arishtocrat, a man, a
Vāsudeva, the royal brother-in-law, the brother-in-law of the king.

*Beadle*. \[*In alarm*.\] Goodness! The king's brother-in-law is the
first who desires to present a case. Well! Wait a moment, sir. I will
inform the magistrates at once. \[*He approaches the magistrates*.\]
Gentlemen, here is the king's brother-in-law who has come to court,
desiring to present a case.

*Judge*. What! the king's brother-in-law is the first who desires to
present a case? Like an eclipse at sunrise, this betokens the ruin of
some great man. Beadle, the court will doubtless be very busy to-day. Go
forth, my good man, and say "Leave us for to-day. Your suit cannot be
considered."

*Beadle*. Yes, Your Honor. \[*He goes out, and approaches
Sansthānaka*.\] Sir, the magistrates send word that you are to leave
them for to-day; that your suit cannot be considered.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Wrathfully*.\] Confound it! Why can't my shuit be
conshidered? If it isn't conshidered, then I'll tell my brother-in-law,
King Pālaka, my shishter's husband, and I'll tell my shishter and my
mother too, and I'll have thish judge removed, and another judge
appointed. \[*He starts to go away*.\]

*Beadle*. Oh, sir! Brother-in-law of the king! Wait a moment. I will
inform the magistrates at once. \[*He returns to the judge*.\] The
brother-in-law of the king is angry, and says—\[*He repeats
Sansthānaka's words*.\]

*Judge*. This fool might do anything. My good man, tell him to come
hither, that his suit will be considered.

*Beadle*. \[*Approaching Sansthānaka*.\] Sir, the magistrates send word
that you are to come in, that your suit will be considered. Pray enter,
sir.

*Sansthānaka*. Firsht they shay it won't be conshidered, then they shay
it will be conshidered. The magishtrates are sheared. Whatever I shay,
I'll make ’em believe it. Good! I'll enter. \[*He enters and approaches
the magistrates*.\] I am feeling very well, thank you. Whether you feel
well or not—that depends on me.

*Judge*. \[*Aside*.\] Well, well! We seem to have a highly cultivated
plaintiff. \[*Aloud*.\] Pray be seated.

*Sansthānaka*. Well! Thish floor belongs to me. I'll sit down wherever I
like. \[*To the gild-warden*.\] I'll sit here. \[*To the beadle*.\] Why
shouldn't I sit here? \[*He lays his hand on the judge's head*.\] I'll
sit here. \[*He sits down on the floor*.\]

*Judge*. You desire to present a case?

*Sansthānaka*. Of courshe.

*Judge*. Then state the case.

*Sansthānaka*. I'll whishper it. I was born in the great family of a man
as glorioush as a wine-glass.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My father's father of the king—in law;  
The king, he is my daddy's son-in-law; <span id="page_136">p.
136</span>  
And I am brother to the king—in law;  
And the husband of my shishter is the king.<span
class="margnote">6</span>

</div>

*Judge*. All this we know.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Why should you boast of this your noble birth?  
’Tis character that makes the man of worth;  
But thorns and weeds grow rank in fertile earth.<span
class="margnote">7</span>

</div>

State your case.

*Sansthānaka*. I will, but even if I was guilty, he wouldn't do anything
to me. Well, my shishter's husband liked me, and gave me the besht
garden there is, the old garden Pushpakaranda, to play in and look
after. And there I go every day to look at it, to keep it dry, to keep
it clean, to keep it blosshoming, to keep it trimmed. But fate decreed
that I shaw—or rather, I didn't shee —the proshtrate body of a woman.

*Judge*. Do you know who the unfortunate woman was?

*Sansthānaka*. Hello, magishtrates! Why shouldn't I know? A woman like
that! the pearl of the city! adorned with a hundred golden ornaments!
Shombody's unworthy shon enticed her into the old garden Pushpakaranda
when it was empty, and for a mere trifle—for her money!—shtrangled
Vasantasenā and killed her. But I didn't—\[*He breaks off, and puts his
hand over his mouth*.\]

*Judge*. What carelessness on the part of the city police! Gild-warden
and clerk, write down the words "I didn't," as the first article in the
case.

*Clerk*. Yes, sir. \[*He does so*.\] Sir, it is written.

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Aside*.\] Goodnessh! Now I've ruined myshelf, like a
man that shwallows a cake of rice and milk in a hurry. Well, I'll get
out of it thish way. \[*Aloud*.\] Well, well, magishtrates! I was jusht
remarking that I didn't shee it happen. What are you making thish
hullabaloo about? \[*He wipes out the written words with his foot*.\]

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

*Judge*. How do you know that she was strangled—and for her money?

*Sansthānaka*. Hello! Why shouldn't I think sho, when her neck was
shwollen and bare, and the places where you wear jewels didn't have any
gold on them?

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. That seems plausible.

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Aside*.\] Thank heaven! I breathe again. Hooray!

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. Upon whom does the conduct of this case depend?

*Judge*. The case has a twofold aspect.

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. How so?

*Judge*. We have to consider the allegations, then the facts. Now the
investigation of the allegations depends upon plaintiff and defendant.
But the investigation of the facts must be carried out by the wisdom of
the judge.

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. Then the conduct of the case depends upon the
presence of Vasantasenā's mother?

*Judge*. Precisely. My good beadle, summon Vasantasenā's mother,
without, however, giving her cause for anxiety.

*Beadle*. Yes, Your Honor. \[*He goes out, and returns with the mother
of the courtezan*.\] Follow me, madam.

*Mother*. My daughter went to the house of a friend to enjoy her youth.
But now comes this gentleman—long life to him!—and says "Come! The judge
summons you." I find myself quite bewildered. My heart is palpitating.
Sir, will you conduct me to the court-room?

*Beadle*. Follow me, madam. \[*They walk about*.\] Here is the
courtroom. Pray enter, madam. \[*They enter*.\]

*Mother*. \[*Approaching*.\] Happiness be yours, most worthy gentlemen.

*Judge*. My good woman, you are very welcome. Pray be seated.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

*Mother*. Thank you. \[*She seats herself*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Abusively*.\] You're here, are you, you old bawd?

*Judge*. Tell me. Are you Vasantasenā's mother?

*Mother*. I am.

*Judge*. Whither has Vasantasenā gone at this moment?

*Mother*. To the house of a friend.

*Judge*. What is the name of her friend?

*Mother*. \[*Aside*.\] Dear me! Really, this is very embarrassing.
\[*Aloud*.\] Any one else might ask me this, but not a judge.

*Judge*. Pray do not be embarrassed. The conduct of the case puts the
question.

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. The conduct of the case puts the question. You
incur no fault. Speak.

*Mother*. What! the conduct of the case? If that is so, then listen,
worthy gentlemen. There lives in the merchants’ quarter the grandson of
the merchant Vinayadatta, the son of Sāgaradatta, a man whose name is a
good omen in itself—that name is Chārudatta. In his house my daughter
enjoys her youth.

*Sansthānaka*. Did you hear that? Write those words down. My contention
is with Chārudatta.

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. It is no sin for Chārudatta to be her friend.

*Judge*. The conduct of this case demands the presence of Chārudatta.

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. Exactly.

*Judge*. Dhanadatta, write as the first article in the case "Vasantasenā
went to the house of Chārudatta." But must we summon the worthy
Chārudatta also? No, the conduct of the case summons him. Go, my good
beadle, summon Chārudatta,—but gently, without haste, without giving him
cause for anxiety, respectfully, as it were incidentally,—with the words
"The judge wishes to see you."

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

*Beadle*. Yes, Your Honor. \[*He goes out, then returns with
Chārudatta*.\] Follow me, sir.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Thoughtfully*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My character and kin are known  
  Unto the king who rules our state;  
And in this summons there is shown  
  A doubt begotten of my wretched fate.<span class="margnote">8</span>

</div>

\[*Reflectively. Aside*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ah! Were there those, the man to recognize  
  Who met me on the road, from bondage freed?  
Or did the king, who sees through cunning spies,  
  Learn that my cart was lent him in his need?  
Why should I else be forced to tread the street,  
Like one accused of crime, my judge to meet?<span
class="margnote">9</span>

</div>

But why consider thus? I must go to the court-room. My good beadle,
conduct me to the court.

*Beadle*. Follow me, sir. \[*They walk about*.\]

*Chārudatta*. \[*Apprehensively*.\] And what means this?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hear how the gloomy raven hoarsely croaks;  
  The slaves of justice summon me again;  
My left eye twitches; these repeated strokes  
  Of threatened evil frighten me and pain.<span
class="margnote">10</span>

</div>

*Beadle*. Follow me, sir, gently and without haste.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Walks about and looks before him*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Upon the withered tree, a crow  
    Turns to the sun;  
His left eye falls on me. Ah, woe!  
    My doubt is done.<span class="margnote">11</span>

</div>

\[*He looks in another direction*.\] But see! a snake!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

His eye is fixed upon me; and his back  
Flashes like antimony's lustrous black; <span id="page_140">p.
140</span>  
His long tongue quivers; four white fangs appear;  
His belly swells and coils. He slumbered here,  
This prince of serpents, till I crossed his path,  
And now he darts upon me in his wrath.<span class="margnote">12</span>

</div>

And more than this:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I slip, although the ground has felt no rain;  
My left eye, and my left arm throb again;  
Another bird is screaming overhead;  
All bodes a cruel death, and hope is fled.<span
class="margnote">13</span>

</div>

Surely, the gods will grant that all may yet be well.

*Beadle*. Follow me, sir. Here is the court-room. Pray enter.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Enters and looks about*.\] How wonderfully splendid is
the court-room. For it seems an ocean,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Whose waters are the king's advisers, deep  
In thought; as waves and shells it seems to keep  
The attorneys; and as sharks and crocodiles  
It has its spies that stand in waiting files;  
Its elephants and horses <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82) represent  
The cruel ocean-fish on murder bent;  
As if with herons of the sea, it shines  
With screaming pettifoggers’ numerous lines;  
While in the guise of serpents, scribes are creeping  
  Upon its statecraft-trodden shore: the court  
The likeness of an ocean still is keeping,  
  To which all harmful-cruel beasts resort.<span
class="margnote">14</span>

</div>

Come! \[*As he enters, he strikes his head against the door.
Reflectively*.\] Alas! This also?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My left eye throbs; a raven cries;  
A serpent coils athwart my path.  
My safety now with heaven lies.<span class="margnote">15</span>

</div>

But I must enter. \[*He does so*.\]

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

*Judge*. This is Chārudatta.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A countenance like his, with clear-cut nose,  
Whose great, wide-opened eye frank candor shows,  
Is not the home of wantonness;  
With elephants, with horses, and with kine,  
The outer form is inner habit's sign;  
With men no less.<span class="margnote">16</span>

</div>

*Chārudatta*. My greetings to the officers of justice. Officials, I
salute you.

*Judge*. \[*Betraying his agitation*.\] You are very welcome, sir. My
good beadle, give the gentleman a seat.

*Beadle*. \[*Brings a seat*.\] Here is a seat. Pray be seated, sir.
\[*Chārudatta seats himself*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Angrily*.\] You're here, are you, you woman-murderer?
Well! Thish is a fine trial, thish is a jusht trial, where they give a
sheat to thish woman-murderer. \[*Haughtily*.\] But it's all right. They
can give it to him.

*Judge*. Chārudatta, have you any attachment, or affection, or
friendship, with this lady's daughter?

*Chārudatta*. What lady?

*Judge*. This lady. \[*He indicates Vasantasenā's mother*.\]

*Chārudatta*. \[*Rising*.\] Madam, I salute you.

*Mother*. Long life to you, my son! \[*Aside*.\] So this is Chārudatta.
My daughter's youth is in good hands.

*Judge*. Sir, is the courtezan your friend? \[*Chārudatta betrays his
embarrassment*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. He tries to hide the deed he did;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He lies, from shame or fear;  
  He murdered her, of her got rid  
For gold, and thinks the deed is hid;  
  Not sho his mashter here.<span class="margnote">17</span>

</div>

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. Speak, Chārudatta. Do not be ashamed. This is a
lawsuit.

*Chārudatta*. \[*In embarrassment*.\] Officials, how can I testify that
a courtezan is my friend? But at worst, it is youth that bears the
blame, not character.

*Judge*. The case is hard; then banish shame,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Though it oppress your heart;  
Speak truth with fortitude, and aim  
  To set deceit apart.<span class="margnote">18</span>

</div>

Do not be embarrassed. The conduct of the case puts the question.

*Chārudatta*. Officer, with whom have I a lawsuit?

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Arrogantly*.\] With me!

*Chārudatta*. A lawsuit with you is unendurable!

*Sansthānaka*. Well, well, woman-murderer! You murder a woman like
Vasantasenā who used to wear a hundred gems, and now you try deceitful
deceivings to hide it!

*Chārudatta*. You are a fool.

*Judge*. Enough of him, good Chārudatta. Speak the truth. Is the
courtezan your friend?

*Chārudatta*. She is.

*Judge*. Sir, where is Vasantasenā?

*Chārudatta*. She has gone home.

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. How did she go? When did she go? Who
accompanied her?

*Chārudatta*. \[*Aside*.\] Shall I say that she went unobserved?

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. Speak, sir.

*Chārudatta*. She went home. What more shall I say?

*Sansthānaka*. She was enticed into my old garden Pushpakaranda, and was
shtrangled for her money. Now will you shay that she went home?

*Chārudatta*. Man, you are crazy.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The very clouds of heaven wet not you;  
  Your lips are like the blue jay's wing-tip worn,  
Yes, full as fickle with their speech untrue,  
  And like the winter lotus lustre-lorn.<span class="margnote">19</span>

</div>

*Judge*. \[*Aside*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Take the Himalayan hills within your hand,  
And swim from ocean strand to ocean strand,  
And hold within your grasp the fleeting wind:  
Then may you think that Chārudatta sinned.<span
class="margnote">20</span>

</div>

\[*Aloud*.\] This is the noble Chārudatta. How could he commit this
crime? \[*He repeats the verse* "A countenance like his:" *page*
[141](#page_141).\]

*Sansthānaka*. Why thish partiality in a lawshuit?

*Judge*. Away, you fool!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Illiterate, you gloss the Sacred Law,  
  And still your tongue uninjured find?  
The midday sun with steadfast eye you saw,  
  And are not straightway stricken blind?  
You thrust your hand into the blazing fire,  
  And draw it forth, unscathed and sound?  
Drag Chārudatta's virtue in the mire,  
  Nor sink beneath this yawning ground?<span class="margnote">21</span>

</div>

How could the noble Chārudatta commit a crime?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Of all the riches of the mighty sea  
Only the swelling waters now are left,  
Because, without consideration, he  
For others' good—himself of all has reft.  
And should this high-souled man, this store-house where  
All gems of virtue gather and unite,  
For lucre's sake, so foul a trespass dare  
That in it even his foe could not delight?<span
class="margnote">22</span>

</div>

*Mother*. You scoundrel! When the golden casket that was left

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

with him as a pledge was stolen by thieves at night, he gave in place of
it a pearl necklace that was the pride of the four seas. And he should
now, for a mere trifle—for her money!—do this sin? Oh, my child, come
back to me, my daughter! \[*She weeps*.\]

*Judge*. Noble Chārudatta, did she go on foot, or in a bullock-cart?

*Chārudatta*. I did not see her when she went. Therefore I do not know
whether she went on foot, or in a bullock-cart.

\[*Enter Vīraka, in anger*.\]

*Vīraka*. My anger was so prodded to the quick

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

By that dishonoring, insulting kick,  
And so I brooded, till at last the night  
Unwilling yielded to the dawning light.<span class="margnote">23</span>

</div>

So now I will go to the court-room. \[*He enters*.\] May happiness be
the lot of these honorable gentlemen.

*Judge*. Ah, it is Vīraka, the captain of the guard. Vīraka, what is the
purpose of your coming?

*Vīraka*. Well! I was looking for Aryaka, in all the excitement about
his escape from prison. I had my suspicions about a covered bullock-cart
that was coming, and wanted to look in. "You've made one inspection,
man, I must make another," said I, and then I was kicked by the highly
respectable Chandanaka. You have heard the matter, gentlemen. The rest
is your affair.

*Judge*. My good man, do you know to whom the bullock-cart belonged?

*Vīraka*. To this gentleman here, Chārudatta. And the driver said that
Vasantasenā was in it, and was on her way to have a good time in the old
garden Pushpakaranda.

*Sansthānaka*. Lishten to that, too!

*Judge*. This moon, alas, though spotless-bright,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Is now eclipsed, and robbed of light; <span id="page_145">p.
145</span>  
The bank is fallen; the waves appear  
Befouled, that once were bright and clear.<span
class="margnote">24</span>

</div>

Vīraka, we will investigate your case here later. Mount the horse that
stands before the court-room door, go to the garden Pushpakaranda, and
see whether a woman has perished there or not.

*Vīraka*. Yes, sir. \[He goes out, then returns.\] I have been there.
And I saw the body of a woman, torn by wild beasts.

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. How do you know that it was the body of a
woman?

*Vīraka*. That I perceived from the traces of hair and arms and hands
and feet.

*Judge*. Alas for the difficulties which are caused by the actions of
men!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The more one may apply his skill,  
The harder is the matter still;  
Plain are indeed the law's demands,  
Yet judgment insecurely stands  
As some poor cow on shifting sands.<span class="margnote">25</span>

</div>

*Chārudatta*. \[*Aside*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As bees, when flowers begin to blow,  
Gather to sip the honey, so  
When man is marked by adverse fate,  
Misfortunes enter every gate.<span class="margnote">26</span>

</div>

*Judge*. Noble Chārudatta, speak truth!

*Chārudatta*. A mean and jealous creature, passion-blind,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Sets all his soul, some fatal means to find  
To slay the man he envies; shall his lies  
By evil nature prompted, win the prize?  
No! he is unregarded by the wise.<span class="margnote">27</span>

</div>

And more than this:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The creeper's beauty would I never blight,  
Nor pluck its flowers; should I not be afraid <span id="page_146">p.

*Sansthānaka*. Hello, magishtrates! How can you inveshtigate the cashe
with such partiality? Why, even now you let thish shcoundrel Chārudatta
shtay on his sheat.

*Judge*. My good beadle, so be it. \[The beadle follows Sansthānaka's
suggestion.\]

*Chārudatta*. Consider, magistrates, consider what you are doing! \[*He
leaves his seat, and sits on the floor*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Dancing about gleefully. Aside*.\] Fine! The shin that
I did falls on another man's head. Sho I'll sit where Chārudatta was.
\[*He does so*.\] Look at me, Chārudatta, and confessh that you murdered
her.

*Chārudatta*. Magistrates!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A mean and jealous creature, passion-blind,  
Sets all his soul, some fatal means to find  
To slay the man he envies; shall his lies,

No! he is unregarded by the wise.<span class="margnote">(27)</span>

\[*Sighing. Aside*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My friend Maitreya! Oh, this cruel blow!

But Maitreya I sent to Vasantasenā, that he might bring me tidings of
her, and might restore the jewels which she gave my child, to buy him a
toy cart. Why then does he linger?

 

\[*Enter Maitreya with the gems*.\]

*Maitreya*. Chārudatta bade me go to Vasantasenā, to return her

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

jewels, and he said to me: "Maitreya, Vasantasenā adorned my dear
Rohasena with her own jewels, and sent him thus to his mother. It was
fitting that she should give him the jewels, but not that we should
receive them. Therefore restore them to her." So now I will go to
Vasantasenā's house. \[*He walks about and looks around, then speaks to
a person behind the scenes*.\] Ah, it is Master Rebhila. Oh, Master
Rebhila, why do you seem so exceedingly troubled? \[*He listens*.\]
What! do you mean to say that my dear friend Chārudatta has been
summoned to court? That can hardly be an insignificant matter. \[*He
reflects*.\] I will go to Vasantasenā's house later, but now I will go
to the court-room. \[*He walks about and looks around*.\] Here is the
court-room. I will go in at once. \[*He enters*.\] May happiness be the
lot of the magistrates. Where is my friend?

*Judge*. Here.

*Maitreya*. My friend, I wish you happiness.

*Chārudatta*. It will be mine.

*Maitreya*. And peace.

*Chārudatta*. That too will be mine.

*Maitreya*. My friend, why do you seem so exceedingly troubled? And why
were you summoned?

*Chārudatta*. My friend,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A scoundrel I, who bear the blame,  
  Nor seek in heaven to be blest;  
A maid—or goddess—’tis the same  
  But he will say the rest.<span class="margnote">30</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. What? what?

*Chārudatta*. \[*Whispers*.\] That is it.

*Maitreya*. Who says that?

*Chārudatta*. \[*Indicating Sansthānaka*.\] This poor fellow is the
instrument that fate uses to accuse me.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

*Maitreya*. \[*Aside to Chārudatta*.\] Why don't you simply say that she
went home?

*Chārudatta*. Though I say it, it is not believed, so unfortunate is my
condition.

*Maitreya*. But gentlemen! He adorned the city of Ujjayinī with
mansions, cloisters, parks, temples, pools, and fountains, and he should
be mad enough to commit such a crime—and for a mere trifle?
\[*Wrathfully*.\] You offspring of a loose wench, you brother-in-law of
the king, Sansthānaka, you libertine, you slanderer, you buffoon, you
gilded monkey, say it before me! This friend of mine doesn't even draw a
flowering jasmine creeper to himself, to gather the blossoms, for fear
that a twig might perhaps be injured. How should he commit a crime like
this, which heaven and earth call accursèd? Just wait, you son of a
bawd! Wait till I split your head into a hundred pieces with this staff
of mine, as crooked as your heart.

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Angrily*.\] Lishten to that, gentlemen! I have a
quarrel, or a lawshuit, with Chārudatta. What right has a man with a
pate that looks like a caret, to shplit my head into a hundred pieces?
Not much! You confounded rashcal! \[*Maitreya raises his staff repeats
his words. Sansthānaka rises angrily and strikes him. Maitreya strikes
back. During the scuffle  the jewels fall from Maitreya's girdle*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Picks up the jewels and examines them. Excitedly*.\]
Look, gentlemen, look! These are the poor girl's jewels! \[*Pointing to
Chārudatta*.\] For a trifle like thish he murdered her, and killed her
too. \[*The magistrates all bow their heads*.\]

*Chārudatta*. \[*Aside to Maitreya*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

’Tis thus my fate would vent its gall,  
That at this moment they should fall,  
  These gems—and with them, I.<span class="margnote">31</span>

*Maitreya*. But why don't you simply tell the truth?

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

*Chārudatta*. My friend,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The king perceives with blinded eye,  
  Nor on the truth that eye will bend;

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. \[*Looking at the casket. To Vasantasenā's

whether it be the same or not.

*Mother*. \[*Examining the casket*.\] It is similar, but not the same.

*Sansthānaka*. Oh, you old bawd! You confessh it with your eyes, and
deny it with your lips.

*Mother*. Away, you scoundrel!

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. Speak carefully. Is it the same or not?

*Mother*. Sir, the craftsman's skill captivates the eye. But it is not
the same.

*Judge*. My good woman, do you know these jewels?

*Mother*. No, I said. No! I don't recognize them; but perhaps they were
made by the same craftsman.

*Judge*. Gild-warden, see!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Gems often seem alike in many ways,

</div>

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. Do these jewels belong to Chārudatta?

*Chārudatta*. Never!

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. To whom then?

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

*Chārudatta*. To this lady's daughter.

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. How did she lose them?

*Chārudatta*. She lost them. Yes, so much is true.

*Gild-warden and Clerk*. Chārudatta, speak the truth in this matter. For
you must remember,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Truth brings well-being in its train;  
Through speaking truth, no evils rise;  
Truth, precious syllable!—Refrain

*Chārudatta*. The jewels, the jewels! I do not know. But I do know that
they were taken from my house.

*Sansthānaka*. Firsht you take her into the garden and murder her. And
now you hide it by tricky trickinessh.

*Judge*. Noble Chārudatta, speak the truth!

*Sansthānaka*. Killed her! Come, you shay it too. "I killed her."

*Chārudatta*. You have said it.

*Sansthānaka*. Lishten, my mashters, lishten! He murdered her! No one
but him! Doubt is over. Let punishment be inflicted on the body of thish
poor Chārudatta.

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

*Judge*. Beadle, we must do as the king's brother-in-law says.

*Guardsmen*, lay hold on this Chārudatta. \[*The guardsmen do so*.\]

*Mother*. Be merciful, good gentlemen, be merciful! \[*She repeats what
she had said before, beginning* "When the golden casket:" *page*
[143](#page_143).\] If my daughter is killed, she is killed. Let him
live for me—bless him! And besides, a lawsuit is a matter between
plaintiff and defendant. I am the real plaintiff. So let him go free!

*Sansthānaka*. You shlave, get out of the way! What have you got to shay
about him?

*Judge*. Go, madam. Guardsmen, conduct her forth.

*Mother*. Oh, my child, my son!

\[*Exit weeping*.

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Aside*.\] I've done shomething worthy of myshelf. Now
I'll go.

\[*Exit*.

*Judge*. Noble Chārudatta, the decision lies with us, but the rest
depends on the king. And yet, beadle, let King Pālaka be reminded of
this:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Brahman who has sinned, our laws declare,  
  May not be slain, but banished from the realm,  
And with his wealth entire abroad may fare.<span
class="margnote">39</span>

</div>

*Beadle*. Yes, Your Honor. \[*He goes out, then reenters in tears*.\]
Oh, sirs, I was with the king. And King Pālaka says: "Inasmuch as he
killed Vasantasenā for such a trifle, these same jewels shall be hung
about his neck, the drum shall be beaten, he shall be conducted to the
southern burying-ground, and there impaled." And whoever else shall
commit such a crime, shall be punished with the like dreadful doom.

*Chārudatta*. Oh, how wanton is this act of King Pālaka! Nevertheless,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Although his counsellors may plunge a king  
  Into injustice’ dangers great,  
Yet he will reap the woe and suffering;  
  And ’tis a righteous fate.<span class="margnote">40</span>

</div>

And more than this:

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

They who pervert the king's true bent,  
  The white crow's part who play,  
Have slain their thousands innocent,  
  And slay, and slay, and slay.<span class="margnote">41</span>

</div>

My friend Maitreya, go, greet the mother of my son in my name for the
last time. And keep my son Rohasena free from harm.

*Maitreya*. When the root is cut away, how can the tree be saved?

*Chārudatta*. No, not so.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When man departs to worlds above,  
  In living son yet liveth he;  
Bestow on Rohasena love  
  No less than that thou gayest me.<span class="margnote">42</span>

*Maitreya*. Oh, my friend! I will prove myself your friend by continuing
the life that you leave unfinished.

*Chārudatta*. And let me see Rohasena for a single moment.

*Maitreya*. I will. It is but fitting.

*Judge*. My good beadle, remove this man. \[*The beadle does so*.\] Who
is there? Let the headsmen receive their orders. \[*The guardsmen loose
their hold on Chārudatta, and all of them go out*.\]

*Beadle*. Come with me, sir.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Mournfully repeats the verse, page* [146](#page_146),
*beginning* "My friend Maitreya!" *Then, as if speaking to one not
present*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If you had proved my conduct by the fire,
