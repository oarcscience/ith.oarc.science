### ACT THE FOURTH

#### MADANIKA AND SHARVILAKA

\[*Enter a maid*.\]

*Maid*.

I AM entrusted with a message for my mistress by her mother. Here is my
mistress. She is gazing at a picture and is talking with Madanikā. I
will go to her. \[*She walks about. Then enter Vasantasenā, as
described, and Madanikā*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. Madanikā girl, is this portrait really like Chārudatta?

*Madanikā*. Very like.

*Vasantasenā*. How do you know?

*Madanikā*. Because my mistress’ eyes are fastened so lovingly upon it.

*Vasantasenā*. Madanikā girl, do you say this because courtezan courtesy
demands it?

*Madanikā*. But mistress, is the courtesy of a girl who lives in a
courtezan's house, necessarily false?

*Vasantasenā*. Girl, courtezans meet so many kinds of men that they do
learn a false courtesy.

*Madanikā*. But when the eyes of my mistress find such delight in a
thing, and her heart too, what need is there to ask the reason?

*Vasantasenā*. But I should not like to have my friends laugh at me.

*Madanikā*. You need not be afraid. Women understand women.

*Maid*. \[*Approaching*.\] Mistress, your mother sends word that a
covered cart is waiting at the side-door, and that you are to take a
drive.

*Vasantasenā*. Tell me, is it Chārudatta who invites me?

*Maid*. Mistress, the man who sent ornaments worth ten thousand gold
pieces with the cart—

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

*Vasantasenā*. Is who?

*Maid*. Is the king's brother-in-law, Sansthānaka.

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Indignantly*.\] Go! and never come again on such an
errand.

*Maid*. Do not be angry, mistress. I was only sent with the message.

*Vasantasenā*. But it is the message which makes me angry.

*Maid*. But what shall I tell your mother?

*Vasantasenā*. Tell my mother never to send me another such message,
unless she wishes to kill me.

*Maid*. As you will. \[*Exit*.\]

\[*Enter Sharvilaka*.\]

*Sharv*. Blame for my sin I laid upon the night;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  I conquered sleep and watchmen of the king;  
But darkness wanes, and in the sun's clear light  
  My light is like the moon's—a faded thing.<span
class="margnote">1</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Whoever cast at me a passing look,  
  Or neared me, anxious, as they quickly ran,  
All such my laden soul for foes mistook;  
  For sin it was wherein man's fear began.<span
class="margnote">2</span>

</div>

Well, it was for Madanikā's sake that I did the deed of sin.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I paid no heed to any one who talked with serving-men;  
  The houses ruled by women-folk—these I avoided most;  
And when policemen seemed to have me almost in their ken,  
  I stood stock-still and acted just exactly like a post.  
A hundred such manœuvres did I constantly essay,  
And by such means succeeded in turning night to day.<span
class="margnote">3</span>

</div>

\[*He walks about*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. Girl, lay this picture on my sofa and come back at once
with a fan.

*Madanikā*. Yes, mistress.

\[*Exit with the picture*.

*Sharvilaka*. This is Vasantasenā's house. I will enter. \[*He does
so*.\]

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

I wonder where I can find Madanikā. \[*Enter Madanikā with the fan.
Sharvilaka discovers her*.\] Ah, it is Madanikā.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Surpassing Madana <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49) himself in
charm,  
  She seems the bride of Love, in human guise;  
Even while my heart the flames of passion harm,  
  She brings a sandal <span id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50) coolness to my
eyes.<span class="margnote">4</span>

</div>

Madanikā!

*Madanikā*. \[*Discovers Sharvilaka*.\] Oh, oh, oh, Sharvilaka! I am so
glad, Sharvilaka. Where have you been?

*Sharvilaka*. I will tell you. \[*They gaze at each other
passionately*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. How Madanikā lingers! I wonder where she is. \[*She looks
through a bull's-eye window*.\] Why, there she stands, talking with a
man. Her loving glance does not waver, and she gazes as if she would
drink him in. I imagine he must be the man who wishes to make her free.
Well, let her stay, let her stay. Never interrupt anybody's happiness. I
will not call her.

*Madanikā*. Tell me, Sharvilaka. \[*Sharvilaka looks about him
uneasily*.\] What is it, Sharvilaka? You seem uneasy.

*Sharvilaka*. I will tell you a secret. Are we alone?

*Madanikā*. Of course we are.

*Vasantasenā*. What! a deep secret? I will not listen.

*Sharvilaka*. Tell me, Madanikā. Will Vasantasenā take a price for your
freedom?

*Vasantasenā*. The conversation has to do with me? Then I will hide
behind this window and listen.

*Madanikā*. I asked my mistress about it, Sharvilaka, and she said that
if she could have her way, she would free all her servants for nothing.
But Sharvilaka, where did you find such a fortune that you can think of
buying my freedom from my mistress?

*Sharvilaka*. A victim to my pauper plight,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  And your sweet love to win, <span id="page_60">p. 60</span>  
For you, my timid maid, last night  
  I did the deed of sin.<span class="margnote">5</span>

</div>

Vasantasenā. His face is tranquil. It would be troubled, if he had
sinned.

*Madanikā*. Oh, Sharvilaka! For a mere nothing—for a woman—you have
risked both things!

*Sharvilaka*. What things?

*Madanikā*. Your life and your character.

*Sharvilaka*. My foolish girl, fortune favors the brave.

*Madanikā*. Oh, Sharvilaka! Your character was without a stain. You
didn't do anything very bad, did you, when for my sake you did the deed
of sin?

*Sharv*. The gems that magnify a woman's charm,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As flowers the creeping plant, I do not harm.  
I do not rob the Brahman of his pelf,  
Nor seize the sacrificial gold myself.  
I do not steal the baby from the nurse,  
Simply because I need to fill my purse.  
Even as a thief, I strive with main and might  
For just distinction 'twixt the wrong and right.<span
class="margnote">6</span>

</div>

And so you may tell Vasantasenā this:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

These ornaments were made for you to don,  
  Or so it seems to me;  
But as you love me, never put them on  
  Where other folks may see.<span class="margnote">7</span>

</div>

*Madanikā*. But Sharvilaka, ornaments that nobody may see, and a
courtezan—the two things do not hang together. Give me the jewels. I
want to see them.

*Sharvilaka*. Here they are. \[*He gives them to her with some
uneasiness*.\]

*Madanikā*. \[*Examining the jewels*.\] It seems to me I have seen these
before. Tell me. Where did you get them?

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

*Sharvilaka*. What does that matter to you, Madanikā? Take them.

*Madanikā*. \[*Angrily*.\] If you can't trust me, why do you wish to buy
my freedom?

*Sharvilaka*. Well, this morning I heard in the merchants’ quarter that
the merchant Chārudatta—

\[*Vasantasenā and Madanikā swoon*.\]

*Sharvilaka*. Madanikā! Come to yourself! Why is it that now

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Your figure seems to melt in limp despair,  
Your eyes are wildly rolling here and there?  
That when I come, sweet girl, to make you free,  
You fall to trembling, not to pitying me?<span class="margnote">8</span>

</div>

*Madanikā*. \[*Coming to herself*.\] O you reckless man! When you did
what you ought not to have done for my sake, you didn't kill anybody or
hurt anybody in that house?

*Sharvilaka*. Madanikā, Sharvilaka does not strike a terrified man or a
man asleep. I did not kill anybody nor hurt anybody.

*Madanikā*. Really?

*Sharvilaka*. Really.

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Recovering consciousness*.\] Ah, I breathe again.

*Madanikā*. Thank heaven!

*Sharvilaka*. \[*Jealously*.\] What does this "Thank heaven" mean,
Madanikā?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I sinned for you, when love had made me pine,  
  Although my house was good since time began;  
Love took my virtue, but my pride is mine.  
  You call me friend and love another man?<span
class="margnote">9</span>

</div>

\[*Meaningly*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A noble youth is like a goodly tree;  
  His wealth, the fruit so fair;  
The courtezan is like a bird; for she  
  Pecks him and leaves him bare.<span class="margnote">10</span>

Love is a fire, whose flame is lust,  
  Whose fuel is gallantry, <span id="page_62">p. 62</span>  
Wherein our youth and riches must  
  Thus sacrificèd be.<span class="margnote">11</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. \[With a smile.\] His excitement is a little out of
place.

*Sharvilaka*. Yes!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Those men are fools, it seems to me,  
  Who trust to women or to gold;  
For gold and girls, ’tis plain to see,  
  Are false as virgin snakes and cold.<span class="margnote">12</span>

Love not a woman; if you ever do,  
  She mocks at you, and plays the gay deceiver:  
Yet if she loves you, you may love her too;  
  But if she doesn't, leave her.<span class="margnote">13</span>

</div>

Too true it is that

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A courtezan will laugh and cry for gold;  
She trusts you not, but waits your trustful hour.  
If virtue and a name are yours, then hold!  
Avoid her as you would a graveyard flower.<span
class="margnote">14</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As fickle as the billows of the sea,  
  Glowing no longer than the evening sky,  
A woman takes your gold, then leaves you free;  
  You're worthless, like cosmetics, when you're dry.<span
class="margnote">15</span>

</div>

Yes, women are indeed fickle.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

One man perhaps may hold her heart in trust,  
  She lures another with coquettish eyes,  
Sports with another in unseemly lust,  
  Another yet her body satisfies.<span class="margnote">16</span>

</div>

As some one has well said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

On mountain-tops no lotuses are grown;  
  The horse's yoke no ass will ever bear;  
Rice never springs from seeds of barley sown;  
  A courtezan is not an honest fair.<span class="margnote">17</span>

</div>

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

Accursèd Chārudatta, you shall not live! \[*He takes a few steps*.\]

*Madanikā*. \[*Seizing the hem of his garment*.\] O you foolish man!
Your anger is so ridiculous.

*Sharvilaka*. Ridiculous? how so?

*Madanikā*. Because these jewels belong to my mistress.

*Sharvilaka*. And what then?

*Madanikā*. And she left them with that gentleman.

*Sharvilaka*. What for?

*Madanikā*. \[*Whispers*.\] That's why.

*Sharvilaka*. \[*Sheepishly*.\] Confound it!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The sun was hot one summer day;  
I sought the shadow, there to stay:  
Poor fool! the kindly branch to pay,  
I stole its sheltering leaves away.<span class="margnote">18</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. How sorry he seems. Surely, he did this thing in
ignorance.

*Sharvilaka*. What is to be done now, Madanikā?

*Madanikā*. Your own wit should tell you that.

*Sharvilaka*. No. For you must remember,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Nature herself gives women wit;  
Men learn from books a little bit.<span class="margnote">19</span>

</div>

*Madanikā*. Sharvilaka, if you will take my advice, restore the jewels
to that righteous man.

*Sharvilaka*. But Madanikā, what if he should prosecute me?

*Madanikā*. No cruel heat comes from the moon.

*Vasantasenā*. Good, Madanikā, good!

*Sharvilaka*. Madanikā,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For what I did, I feel no grief nor fear;  
  Why tell me of this good man's virtues high?  
Shame for my baseness touches me more near;  
  What can this king do to such rogues as I?<span
class="margnote">20</span>

</div>

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

Nevertheless, your suggestion is inconsistent with prudence. You must
discover some other plan.

*Madanikā*. Yes, there is another plan.

*Vasantasenā*. I wonder what it will be.

*Madanikā*. Pretend to be a servant of that gentleman, and give the
jewels to my mistress.

*Sharvilaka*. And what then?

*Madanikā*. Then you are no thief, Chārudatta has discharged his
obligation, and my mistress has her jewels.

*Sharvilaka*. But isn't this course too reckless?

*Madanikā*. I tell you, give them to her. Any other course is too
reckless.

*Vasantasenā*. Good, Madanikā, good! Spoken like a free woman.

*Sharvilaka*. Risen at last is wisdom's light,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Because I followed after you;  
When clouds obscure the moon by night,  
  ’Tis hard to find a guide so true.<span class="margnote">21</span>

</div>

*Madanikā*. Then you must wait here a moment in Kāma's shrine, while I
tell my mistress that you have come.

*Sharvilaka*. I will.

*Madanikā*. \[*Approaches Vasantasenā*.\] Mistress, a Brahman has come
from Chārudatta to see you.

*Vasantasenā*. But girl, how do you know that he comes from Chārudatta?

*Madanikā*. Should I not know my own, mistress?

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Shaking her head and smiling. Aside*.\] Splendid!
\[*Aloud*.\] Bid him enter.

*Madanikā*. Yes, mistress. \[*Approaching Sharvilaka*.\] Enter,
Sharvilaka.

*Sharvilaka*. \[*Approaches. With some embarrassment*.\] My greetings to
you.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

*Vasantasenā*. I salute you, sir. Pray be seated.

*Sharvilaka*. The merchant sends this message: "My house is so old that
it is hard to keep this casket safe. Pray take it back." \[*He gives it
to Madanikā, and starts to leave*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. Sir, will you undertake a return commission of mine?

*Sharvilaka*. \[*Aside*.\] Who will carry it? \[*Aloud*.\] And this
commission is—

*Vasantasenā*. You will be good enough to accept Madanikā.

*Sharvilaka*. Madam, I do not quite understand.

*Vasantasenā*. But I do.

*Sharvilaka*. How so?

*Vasantasenā*. Chārudatta told me that I was to give Madanikā to the man
who should return these jewels. You are therefore to understand that he
makes you a present of her.

*Sharvilaka*. \[*Aside*.\] Ah, she sees through me. \[*Aloud*.\] Good,
Chārudatta, good!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

On virtue only set your heart's desire;  
The righteous poor attain to heights whereto  
The wicked wealthy never may aspire.<span class="margnote">22</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

On virtue let the human heart be set;  
To virtue nothing serves as check or let.  
The moon, attaining unattainable, is led  
By virtue to her seat on Shiva's head.<span class="margnote">23</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. Is my driver there? \[*Enter a servant with a
bullock-cart*.\]

*Servant*. Mistress, the cart is ready.

*Vasantasenā*. Madanikā girl, you must show me a happy face. You are
free. Enter the bullock-cart. But do not forget me.

*Madanikā*. \[*Weeping*.\] My mistress drives me away. \[*She falls at
her feet*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. You are now the one to whom honor should be

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

paid. <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51) Go then, enter the cart. But
do not forget me.

*Sharvilaka*. Heaven bless you! and you, Madanikā,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Turn upon her a happy face,  
And hail with bended head the grace  
That gives you now the name of wife,  
As a veil to keep you safe through life.<span class="margnote">24</span>

</div>

\[*He enters the bullock-cart with Madanikā, and starts away*.\]

*A voice behind the scenes*. Men! Men! We have the following orders from
the chief of police: "A soothsayer has declared that a young herdsman
named Aryaka is to become king. Trusting to this prophecy, and alarmed
thereat, King Pālaka has taken him from his hamlet, and thrown him into
strict confinement. Therefore be watchful, and every man at his post."

*Sharvilaka*. \[*Listening*.\] What! King Pālaka has imprisoned my good
friend Aryaka? And here I am, a married man. Confound it! But no,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Two things alone—his friend, his wife  
  Deserve man's love below;  
A hundred brides may forfeit life  
  Ere he should suffer so.<span class="margnote">25</span>

</div>

Good! I will get out. \[*He does so*.\]

*Madanikā*. \[*Folding her hands. Tearfully*.\] My lord, if you must, at
least bring me first to your parents.

*Sharvilaka*. Yes, my love, I will. I had the same thought in mind.
\[*To the servant*.\] My good fellow, do you know the house of the
merchant Rebhila?

*Servant*. Certainly.

*Sharvilaka*. Bring my wife thither.

*Servant*. Yes, sir.

*Madanikā*. If you desire it, dear. But dear, you must be very careful.

\[*Exit*.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

*Sharvilaka*. Now as for me,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I'll rouse my kin, the kitchen cabinet,  
  Those high in fame by strength of good right arm,  
And those who with the king's contempt have met,  
  And royal slaves, to save my friend from harm:  
          Like old Yaugandharāyana  
          For the good king Udayana.<span class="margnote">26</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My friend has causeless been confined  
By wicked foes of timid kind;  
I fly, I fly to free him soon,  
Like the eclipse-oppressèd moon.<span class="margnote">27</span>

</div>

\[*Exit*.\]

Maid. \[*Entering*.\] Mistress, I congratulate you. A Brahman has come
with a message from Chārudatta.

*Vasantasenā*. Ah, this is a joyful day. Show him every mark of respect,
girl, and have him conducted hither by one of the pages.

*Maid*. Yes, mistress.

\[*Exit*.

\[*Enter Maitreya with a page*.\]

*Maitreya*. Well! Rāvana, the king of the demons, travels with his
chariot that they call the "Blossom." He earned it by his penances. Now
I am a Brahman, and though I never performed any penances, I travel with
another sort of a blossom—a woman of the town.

*Maid*. Sir, will you inspect our gateway.

*Maitreya*. \[*Gazes admiringly*.\] It has just been sprinkled and
cleaned and received a coat of green. The threshold of it is pretty as a
picture with the offerings of all sorts of fragrant flowers. It
stretches up its head as if it wanted to peep into the sky. It is
adorned with strings of jasmine garlands that hang down and toss about
like the trunk of the heavenly elephant. It shines with its high ivory
portal. It is lovely with any number of holiday banners that gleam red
as great rubies and wave their coquettish fingers as

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

they flutter in the breeze and seem to invite me to enter. Both sides
are decorated with holiday water-jars of crystal, which are charming
with their bright-green mango twigs, and are set at the foot of the
pillars that sustain the portal. The doors are of gold, thickly set with
diamonds as hard to pierce as a giant's breast. It actually wearies a
poor devil's envy. Yes, Vasantasenā's house-door is a beautiful thing.
Really, it forcibly challenges the attention of a man who doesn't care
about such things.

*Maid*. Come, sir, and enter the first court.

*Maitreya*. \[*Enters and looks about*.\] Well! Here in the first court
are rows of balconies brilliant as the moon, or as sea-shells, or as
lotus-stalks; whitened by handfuls of powder strewn over them; gleaming
with golden stairways inlaid with all sorts of gems: they seem to gaze
down on Ujjayinī with their round faces, the crystal windows, from which
strings of pearls are dangling. The porter sits there and snoozes as
comfortably as a professor. The crows which they tempt with rice-gruel
and curdled milk will not eat the offering, because they can't
distinguish it from the mortar. Show me the way, madam.

*Maid*. Come, sir, and enter the second court.

*Maitreya*. \[*Enters and looks about*.\] Well! Here in the second court
the cart-bullocks are tied. They grow fat on mouthfuls of grass and
pulse-stalks which are brought them, right and left, by everybody. Their
horns are smeared with oil. And here is another, a buffalo, snorting
like a gentleman insulted. And here is a ram <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52) having his neck rubbed, like a
prize-fighter after the fight. And here are others, horses having their
manes put in shape. And here in a stall is another, a monkey, tied fast
like a thief. \[*He looks in another direction*.\] And here is an
elephant, taking from his drivers a cake of rice and drippings and oil.
Show me the way, madam.

*Maid*. Come, sir, and enter the third court.

*Maitreya*. \[*Enters and looks about*.\] Well! Here in the third court

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

are these seats, prepared for young gentlemen to sit on. A half-read
book is lying on the gaming-table. And the table itself has its own
dice, made out of gems. And here, again, are courtezans and old
hangers-on at court, past masters in the war and peace of love,
wandering about and holding in their fingers pictures painted in many
colors. Show me the way, madam.

*Maid*. Come, sir, and enter the fourth court.

*Maitreya*. \[*Enters and looks about*.\] Well! Here in the fourth court
the drums that maiden fingers beat are booming like the thunder; the
cymbals are falling, as the stars fall from heaven when their merit is
exhausted; <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53) the pipe is discoursing
music as sweet as the humming of bees. And here, again, is a lute that
somebody is holding on his lap like a girl who is excited by jealousy
and love, and he is stroking it with his fingers. And here, again, are
courtezan girls that sing as charmingly as honey-drunken bees, and they
are made to dance and recite a drama with love in it. And water-coolers
are hanging in the windows so as to catch the breeze. Show me the way,
madam.

*Maid*. Come, sir, and enter the fifth court.

*Maitreya*. \[*Enters and looks about*.\] Well! Here in the fifth court
the overpowering smell of asafetida and oil is attractive enough to make
a poor devil's mouth water. The kitchen is kept hot all the time, and
the gusts of steam, laden with all sorts of good smells, seem like sighs
issuing from its mouth-like doors. The smell of the preparation of all
kinds of foods and sauces makes me smack my lips. And here, again, is a
butcher's boy washing a mess of chitterlings as if it were an old
loin-cloth. The cook is preparing every kind of food. Sweetmeats are
being constructed, cakes are being baked. \[*To himself*.\] I wonder if
I am to get a chance to wash my feet and an invitation to eat what I can
hold. \[*He looks in another direction*.\] There are courtezans and
bastard pages,

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

adorned with any number of jewels, just like Gandharvas <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54) and Apsarases. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55) Really, this house is heaven. Tell me, who
are you bastards anyway?

Pages. Why, we are bastard pages—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Petted in a stranger's court,  
  Fed on stranger's food,  
Stranger's money makes us sport—  
  Not so very good.  
Stranger women gave us birth,  
  Stranger men begot;  
Baby elephants in mirth,  
  We're a bastard lot.<span class="margnote">28</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. Show me the way, madam.

*Maid*. Come, sir, and enter the sixth court.

*Maitreya*. \[*Enters and looks about*.\] Well! Here in the sixth court
they are working in gold and jewels. The arches set with sapphires look
as if they were the home of the rainbow. The jewelers are testing the
lapis lazuli, the pearls, the corals, the topazes, the sapphires, the
cat's-eyes, the rubies, the emeralds, and all the other kinds of gems.
Rubies are being set in gold. Golden ornaments are being fashioned.
Pearls are being strung on a red cord. Pieces of lapis lazuli are being
cleverly polished. Shells are being pierced. Corals are being ground.
Wet bundles of saffron are being dried. Musk is being moistened.
Sandalwood is being ground to make sandal-water. Perfumes are being
compounded. Betel-leaves and camphor are being given to courtezans and
their lovers. Coquettish glances are being exchanged. Laughter is going
on. Wine is being drunk incessantly with sounds of glee. Here are
men-servants, here are maid-servants, and here are men who forget child
and wife and money. When the courtezans, who have drunk the wine from
the liquor jars, give them the mitten, they—drink. Show me the way,
madam.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

*Maid*. Come, sir, and enter the seventh court.

*Maitreya*. \[*Enters and looks about*.\] Well! Here in the seventh
court the mated doves are sitting comfortably in their snug dovecotes,
billing and cooing and nothing else, and perfectly happy. And there is a
parrot in a cage, chanting like a Brahman with a bellyful of curdled
milk and rice. And here, again, is a talking thrush, chattering like a
housemaid who spreads herself because somebody noticed her. A cuckoo,
her throat still happy from tasting all sorts of fruit-syrups, is cooing
like a procuress. Rows of cages are hanging from pegs. Quails are being
egged on to fight. Partridges are being made to talk. Caged pigeons are
being provoked. A tame peacock that looks as if he was adorned with all
sorts of gems is dancing happily about, and as he flaps his wings, he
seems to be fanning the roof which is distressed by the rays of the sun.
\[*He looks in another direction*.\] Here are pairs of flamingos like
moonbeams rolled into a ball, that wander about after pretty girls, as
if they wanted to learn how to walk gracefully. And here, again, are
tame cranes, walking around like ancient eunuchs. Well, well! This
courtezan keeps a regular menagerie of birds. Really, the courtezan's
house seems to me like Indra's heaven. Show me the way, madam.

*Maid*. Come, sir, and enter the eighth court.

*Maitreya*. \[*Enters and looks about*.\] Madam, who is this in the silk
cloak, adorned with such astonishingly tautologous ornaments, who
wanders about, stumbling and stretching his limbs?

*Maid*. Sir, this is my mistress’ brother.

*Maitreya*. What sort of ascetic exercises does a man have to perform,
in order to be born as Vasantasenā's brother? But no,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He may be shiny, may be greasy,  
  And perfumed may he be.  
And yet I warn you to go easy;  
  He's a graveyard champak-tree.<span class="margnote">29</span>

</div>

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

\[*He looks in another direction*.\] But madam, who is that in the
expansive garment, sitting on the throne? She has shoes on her greasy
feet.

*Maid*. Sir, that is my mistress' mother.

*Maitreya*. Lord! What an extensive belly the dirty old witch has got! I
suppose they couldn't put that superb portal on the house till after
they had brought the idol in?

*Maid*. Rascal! You must not make fun of our mother so. She is pining
away under a quartan ague.

*Maitreya*. \[*Bursts out laughing*.\] O thou blessèd quartan ague! Look
thou upon a Brahman, even upon me, with this thy favor!

*Maid*. Rascal! May death strike you.

*Maitreya*. \[*Bursts out laughing*.\] Why, wench, a pot-belly like that
is better dead.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Drinking brandy, rum, and wine,  
  Mother fell extremely ill.  
If mother now should peak and pine,  
  A jackal-pack would have its fill.<span class="margnote">30</span>

</div>

Well, I have seen Vasantasenā's palace with its many incidents and its
eight courts, and really, it seems as if I had seen the triple heaven in
a nut-shell. I haven't the eloquence to praise it. Is this the house of
a courtezan, or a piece of Kubera's <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56)
palace? Where's your mistress?

*Maid*. She is here in the orchard. Enter, sir.

*Maitreya*. \[*Enters and looks about*.\] Well! What a beautiful
orchard! There are any number of trees planted here, and they are
covered with the most wonderful flowers. Silken swings are hung under
the thick-set trees, just big enough for a girl to sit in. The golden
jasmine, the shephālikā, the white jasmine, the jessamine, the
navamallikā, the amaranth, the spring creeper, and all the other flowers
have fallen of themselves, and really, it makes Indra's heaven

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

look dingy. \[*He looks in another direction*.\] And the pond here looks
like the morning twilight, for the lilies and red lotuses are as
splendid as the rising sun. And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The ashoka-tree, whose twigs so merry  
  And crimson flowers have just appeared,  
Seems like a battling mercenary,  
  With clotting crimson gore besmeared.<span class="margnote">31</span>

</div>

Good! Now where's your mistress?

*Maid*. If you would stop star-gazing, sir, you would see her.

*Maitreya*. \[*Perceives Vasantasenā and approaches*.\] Heaven bless
you!

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Speaking in Sanskrit*. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57)\] Ah, Maitreya! \[*Rising*.\] You are very
welcome. Here is a seat. Pray be seated.

*Maitreya*. When you are seated, madam. \[*They both seat themselves*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. Is the merchant's son well?

*Maitreya*. Well, madam.

*Vasantasenā*. Tell me, good Maitreya,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Do friends, like birds, yet seek a shelter free  
Beneath the modest boughs of this fair tree,  
Whose leaves are virtues, confidence its root,  
Its blossoms honor, good its precious fruit?<span
class="margnote">32</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. \[*Aside*.\] A good description by a naughty woman.
\[*Aloud*.\] They do, indeed.

*Vasantasenā*. Tell me, what is the purpose of your coming?

*Maitreya*. Listen, madam. The excellent Chārudatta folds his
hands <span id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58) and requests—

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Folding her hands*.\] And commands—

*Maitreya*. He says he imagined that that golden casket was his own and
gambled it away. And nobody knows where the gambling-master

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

has gone, for he is employed in the king's business.

*Maid*. Mistress, I congratulate you. The gentleman has turned gambler.

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Aside*.\] It was stolen by a thief, and he is so proud
that he says he gambled it away. I love him for that.

*Maitreya*. He requests that you will therefore be good enough to accept
in its place this necklace of pearls.

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Aside*.\] Shall I show him the jewels?
\[*Reflecting*.\] No, not yet.

*Maitreya*. Why don't you take this necklace?

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Laughs and looks at her friend*.\] Why should I not
take the necklace, Maitreya? \[*She takes it and lays it away. Aside*.\]
How is it possible that drops of honey fall from the mango-tree, even
after its blossoms are gone? \[*Aloud*.\] Sir, pray tell the worthy
gambler Chārudatta in my name that I shall pay him a visit this evening.

*Maitreya*. \[*Aside*.\] What else does she expect to get out of a visit
to our house? \[*Aloud*.\] Madam, I will tell him—\[*aside*\] to have
nothing more to do with this courtezan.

\[*Exit*.

*Vasantasenā*. Take these jewels, girl. Let us go and bring cheer to
Chārudatta.

*Maid*. But mistress, see! An untimely storm is gathering.

*Vasant*. The clouds may come, the rain may fall forever,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  The night may blacken in the sky above;  
For this I care not, nor I will not waver;  
  My heart is journeying to him I love.<span class="margnote">33</span>

</div>

Take the necklace, girl, and come quickly.

\[*Exeunt omnes*.
