<p align="center">[<i>Enter, with a cloak in his hand, Maitreya</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>.</p>  
<p>YOU must invite some other Brahman. I am busy." And yet I really ought to be seeking invitations from a stranger. Oh, what a wretched state of affairs! When good Ch&#257;rudatta was still wealthy, I used to eat my fill of the most deliciously fragrant sweetmeats, prepared day and night with the greatest of care. I would sit at the door of the courtyard, where I was surrounded by hundreds of dishes, and there, like a painter with his paint-boxes, I would simply touch them with my fingers and thrust them aside. I would stand chewing my cud like a bull in the city market. And now he is so poor that I have to run here, there, and everywhere, and come home, like the pigeons, only to roost. Now here is this jasmine-scented cloak, which Ch&#257;rudatta's good friend J&#363;rnavriddha has sent him. He bade me give it to Ch&#257;rudatta, as soon as he had finished his devotions. So now I will look for Ch&#257;rudatta. [<i>He walks about and looks around him</i>.] Ch&#257;rudatta has finished his devotions, and here he comes with an offering for the divinities of the house.</p>  
<p>[<i>Enter Ch&#257;rudatta as described, and Radanik&#257;</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Ah, it is my constant friend Maitreya. You are very welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Thank you. [<i>He seats himself</i>.] Well, comrade, here is a jasmine-scented cloak which your good friend J&#363;rnavriddha has sent. He bade me give it you as soon as you had finished your devotions. [<i>He presents the cloak. Ch&#257;rudatta takes it and remains sunk in thought</i>.] Well, what are you thinking about?</p>

<p><i>Maitreya</i>. My dear friend, be not thus cast down. Your wealth has been conveyed to them you love, and like the moon, after she has yielded her nectar to the gods, your waning fortunes win an added charm.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Comrade, I do not grieve for my ruined fortunes. But<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;This is my sorrow. They whom I<br> &nbsp;Would greet as guests, now pass me by.<br> "This is a poor man's house," they cry.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Oh, confound the money! It is a trifle not worth thinking about. It is like a cattle-boy in the woods afraid of wasps; it doesn't stay anywhere where it is used for food.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya</i>. But just remember what a trifle money is, after all, and be more cheerful.</p>

<p>Comrade, I have made my offering to the divinities of the house. Do you too go and offer sacrifice to the Divine Mothers at a place where four roads meet.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. No!</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Why not?</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Because the gods are not gracious to you even when thus honored. So what is the use of worshiping?</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Not so, my friend, not so! This is the constant duty of a householder.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

<p>Why then do you hesitate? Go and offer sacrifice to the Mothers.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. No, I'm not going. You must send somebody else. Anyway, everything seems to go wrong with me, poor Brahman that I am! It's like a reflection in a mirror; the right side becomes the left, and the left becomes the right. Besides, at this hour of the evening, people are abroad upon the king's highway&#151;courtezans, courtiers, servants, and royal favorites. They will take me now for fair prey, just as the black-snake out frog-hunting snaps up the mouse in his path. But what will you do sitting here?</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Good then, remain; and I will finish my devotions.</p>
