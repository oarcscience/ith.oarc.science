<p>[<i>Reflecting</i>.] It is long since Maitreya went to visit Vasantasen&#257;. And even yet he does not come.</p>  
<p align="right">[<i>Enter Maitreya</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Confound the courtezan's avarice and her incivility! To think of her making so short a story of it! Over and over she repeats something about the affection she feels, and then without more ado she pockets the necklace. She is rich enough so that she might at least have said: "Good Maitreya, rest a little. You must not go until you have had a cup to drink." Confound the courtezan! I hope I'll never set eyes on her again. [<i>Wearily</i>.] The proverb is right. " It is hard to find a lotus-plant without a root, a merchant who never cheats, a goldsmith who never steals, a village-gathering without a fight, and a courtezan without avarice." Well, I'll find my friend and persuade him to have nothing more to do with this courtezan. [<i>He walks about until he discovers Ch&#257;rudatta</i>.] Ah, my good friend is sitting in the orchard. I'll go to him. [<i>Approaching</i>.] Heaven bless you! May happiness be yours.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. [<i>Looking up</i>.] Ah, my friend Maitreya has returned. You are very welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Thank you.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Tell me of your errand, my friend.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. My errand went all wrong.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. What! did she not accept the necklace?</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. How could we expect such a piece of luck? She put her lotus-tender hands to her brow,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and took it.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Then why do you say "went wrong"?</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Why not, when we lost a necklace that was the pride of the four seas for a cheap golden casket, that was stolen before we had a bite or a drink out of it?</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Not so, my friend.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">She showed her trust in leaving us her treasure;<br> The price of confidence has no less measure.<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT></span></div></p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Now look here! I have a second grievance. She tipped her friend the wink, covered her face with the hem of her dress, and laughed at me. And so, Brahman though I am, I hereby fall on my face before you and beg you not to have anything more to do with this courtezan. That sort of society does any amount of damage. A courtezan is like a pebble in your shoe. It hurts before you get rid of it. And one thing more, my friend. A courtezan, an elephant, a scribe, a mendicant friar, a swindler, and an ass&#151;where these dwell, not even rogues are born.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Oh, my friend, a truce to all your detraction! My poverty of itself prevents me. For consider:<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

<p>Then too, my friend:<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">If wealth is thine, the maid is thine,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For maids are won by gold;<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

<p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Looks down. Aside</i>.] From the way he looks up and sighs, I conclude that my effort to distract him has simply increased his longing. The proverb is right. "You can't reason with a lover." [<i>Aloud</i>.] Well, she told me to tell you that she would have to come here this evening. I suppose she isn't satisfied with the necklace and is coming to look for something else.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Let her come, my friend. She shall not depart unsatisfied.</p>  
<p align="right">[<i>Enter Kumbh&#299;laka</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. Listen, good people.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The more it rains in sheets,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The more my skin gets wet;<br> The more the cold wind beats,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The more I shake and fret.<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT></span><!-- paragraph continues --></div></p>  
<p>[<i>He bursts out laughing</i>.]<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

<p>My mistress Vasantasen&#257; said to me "Kumbh&#299;laka, go and tell Ch&#257;rudatta that I am coming." So here I am, on my way to Ch&#257;rudatta's house. [<i>He walks about, and, as he enters, discovers Ch&#257;rudatta</i>.] Here is Ch&#257;rudatta in the orchard. And here is that wretched jackanapes, too. Well, I'll go up to them. What! the orchard-gate is shut? Good! I'll give this jackanapes a hint. [<i>He throws lumps of mud</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Well! Who is this pelting me with mud, as if I were an apple-tree inside of a fence?</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Doubtless the pigeons that play on the roof of the garden-house.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Wait a minute, you confounded pigeon! With this stick I'll bring you down from the roof to the ground, like an over-ripe mango. [<i>He raises his stick and starts to run</i>.]</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. [<i>Holding him back by the sacred cord</i>.] Sit down, my friend. What do you mean? Leave the poor pigeon alone with his mate.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. What! he sees the pigeon and doesn't see me? Good! I'll hit him again with another lump of mud. [<i>He does so</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Looks about him</i>.] What! Kumbh&#299;laka? I'll be with you in a minute. [<i>He approaches and opens the gate</i>.] Well, Kumbh&#299;laka, come in. I'm glad to see you.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. [<i>Enters</i>.] I salute you, sir.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Where do you come from, man, in this rain and darkness?</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. You see, she's here.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Who's she? Who's here?</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. She. See? She.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Look here, you son of a slave! What makes you sigh like a half-starved old beggar in a famine, with your "shesheshe"?</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. And what makes you hoot like an owl with your "whowhowho"?</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. All right. Tell me.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] Suppose I say it this way. [<i>Aloud</i>.] I'll give you a riddle, man.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. And I'll give you the answer with my foot on your bald spot.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. Not till you've guessed it. In what season do the mango-trees blossom?</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. In summer, you jackass.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. [<i>Laughing</i>.] Wrong!</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] What shall I say now? [<i>Reflecting</i>.] Good! I'll go and ask Ch&#257;rudatta. [<i>Aloud</i>.] Just wait a moment. [<i>Approaching Ch&#257;rudatta</i>.] My friend, I just wanted to ask you in what season the mango-trees blossom.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. You fool, in spring, in <i>vasanta</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Returns to Kumbh&#299;laka</i>.] You fool, in spring, in <i>vasanta</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. Now I'll give you another. Who guards thriving villages?</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Why, the guard.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. [<i>Laughing</i>.] Wrong!</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Well, I'm stuck. [<i>Reflecting</i>.] Good! I'll ask Ch&#257;rudatta again. [<i>He returns and puts the question to Ch&#257;rudatta</i>.]</p>  
<p>Ch&#257;rudatta. The army, my friend, the <i>sen&#257;</i>.</p>  
<p>Maitreya. [<i>Comes back to Kumbh&#299;laka</i>.] The army, you jackass, the <i>sen&#257;</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. Now put the two together and say &#145;em fast.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Sen&#257;-vasanta.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. Say it turned around.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Turns around</i>.] Sen&#257;-vasanta.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. You fool! you jackanapes! Turn the parts of the thing around!</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Turns his feet around</i>.] Sen&#257;-vasanta.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. You fool! Turn the parts of the word around!</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>After reflection</i>.] Vasanta-sen&#257;.</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. She's here.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Then I must tell Ch&#257;rudatta. [<i>Approaching</i>.] Well, Ch&#257;rudatta, your creditor is here.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. How should a creditor come into my family?</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Not in the family perhaps, but at the door. Vasantasen&#257; is here.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. Why do you deceive me, my friend?</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. If you can't trust me, then ask Kumbh&#299;laka here. Kumbh&#299;laka, you jackass, come here.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. [<i>Approaching</i>.] I salute you, sir.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. You are welcome, my good fellow. Tell me, is Vasantasen&#257; really here?</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. Yes, she's here. Vasantasen&#257; is here.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. [<i>Joyfully</i>.] My good fellow, I have never let the bearer of welcome news go unrewarded. Take this as your recompense. [<i>He gives him his mantle</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Kumbh&#299;laka</i>. [<i>Takes it and bows. Gleefully</i>.] I'll tell my mistress.</p>  
<p align="right">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. Do you see why she comes in a storm like this?</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. I do not quite understand, my friend.</p>  
<p><i>Maitreya</i>. I know. She has an idea that the pearl necklace is cheap, and the golden casket expensive. She isn't satisfied, and she has come to look for something more.</p>  
<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] She shall not depart unsatisfied.</p>
