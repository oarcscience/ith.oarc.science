This malefactor enticed the courtezan Vasantasen&#257; into the deserted old garden Pushpakaranda, and for a mere trifle murdered her by strangling. He was taken with the booty, and confessed his guilt. Therefore are we under orders from King P&#257;laka to execute him. And if any other commit such a crime, accurs&egrave;d in this world and the next, him too King P&#257;laka condemns to the like punishment.</p>
