</p>  <h2 align="center">III, 9. Against vishkandha and k&acirc;bava (hostile demons).</h2>  
<p>1. Of karsapha and visapha heaven is the father and earth the mother. As, ye gods, ye have brought on (the trouble), thus do ye again remove it!<br> 2. Without fastening the), (the protecting plants?) held fast, thus it has been arranged by Manu. The vishkandha do I render impotent, like one who gelds cattle.<br> 3. A talisman tied to a reddish thread the active (seers) then do fasten on: may the fastenings render impotent the eager, fiery k&acirc;bava!<br> 4. And since, O ye eager (demons), ye walk like gods by the wile of the Asuras, the fastening (of the amulet) is destructive to the k&acirc;bava, as the ape to the dog.<br> 5. I revile thee, the k&acirc;bava, unto misfortune, (and) shall work harm for thee. Accompanied with curses ye shall go out like swift chariots!<br> 6. A hundred and one vishkandha are spread out along the earth; for these at the beginning they brought out thee, the amulet, that destroys vishkandha.</p>
