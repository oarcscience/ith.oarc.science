## VII, 115. Charm for the removal of evil characteristics, and the acquisition of auspicious ones.

1\. Fly forth from here, O evil mark, vanish from here, fly forth to
yonder place! Upon him that hates us do we fasten thee with a brazen
hook.  
2. The unsavoury mark which flying has alighted upon me, as a creeper
upon a tree, that mayest thou put away from us, away from here, O
golden-handed  
(golden-rayed) Savitar (the sun), bestowing goods upon us!  
3. Together with the body of the mortal, from his birth, one and a
hundred marks are born. Those that are most foul do we drive away from
here; the auspicious ones, O Gâtavedas (Agni), do thou hold fast for
us!  
4. These (marks) here I have separated, as cows scattered upon the
heather. The pure marks shall remain, the foul ones I have made to
disappear!
