</p>  <h2 align="center">V, 21 Hymn to the battle-drum, the terror of the enemy.</h2>  
<p>1. Carry with thy voice, O drum, lack of heart, and failure of courage among the enemies! Disagreement, dismay, and fright, do we place into the enemies: beat them down, O drum!<br> 2. Agitated in their minds, their sight, their hearts, the enemies shall run, frightened with terror, when our oblation has been offered!<br> 3. Made of wood, equipped with the skin of the cow, at home with every clan, put thou with thy voice terror into the enemies, when thou hast been anointed with ghee!<br> 4. As the wild animals of the forest start in fear from man, thus do thou, O drum, shout against the enemies, frighten them away, and bewilder their minds!<br> 5. As goats and sheep run from the wolf, badly frightened, thus do thou, O drum, shout against the enemies, frighten them away, and bewilder their minds!<br> 6. As birds start in fear from the eagle, as by day and by night (they start) at the roar of the lion, thus do thou, O drum, shout against the enemies, frighten them away, and bewilder their minds!<br> 7. With the drum and the skin of the antelope all the gods, that sway the battle, have scared away the enemies.<br> 8. At the noise of the beat of the feet when Indra disports himself, and at his shadow, our enemies yonder, that come in successive ranks, shall tremble!<br> 9. The whirring of the bowstring and the drums shall shout at the directions where the conquered armies of the enemies go in successive ranks!<br> 10. O sun, take away their sight; O rays, run after them; clinging to their feet, fasten yourselves upon them, when the strength of their arms is gone!<br> 11. Ye strong Maruts, Prisni's children, with Indra as an ally, crush ye the enemies; Soma the king (shall crush them), Varuna the king, Mah&acirc;deva, and<br> also Mrityu (death), and Indra!<br> 12. These wise armies of the gods, having the sun as their ensign, shall conquer our enemies! Hail!</p>
