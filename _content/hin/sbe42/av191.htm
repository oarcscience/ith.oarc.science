</p>  <h2 align="center">VI, 112. Expiation for the precedence of a younger brother over an older.</h2>  
<p>1. May this (younger brother) not slay the oldest one of them, O Agni; protect him that he be not torn out by the root! Do thou here cunningly loosen the fetter of Gr&acirc;hi (attack of disease); may all the gods give thee leave!<br> 2. Free these three, O Agni, from the three fetters with which they have been shackled! Do thou cunningly loosen the fetters of Gr&acirc;hi; release them all, father, sons, and mother!<br> 3. The fetters with which the older brother, whose younger brother has married before him, has been bound, with which he has been encumbered and shackled limb by limb, may they be loosened; since fit for loosening they are! Wipe off, O P&ucirc;shan, the misdeeds upon him that practiseth abortion!</p>
