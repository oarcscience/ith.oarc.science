## IV, 16. Prayer to Varuna for protection against treacherous designs.

1\. The great guardian among these (gods) sees as if from anear. He that
thinketh he is moving stealthily--all this the gods know.  
2. If a man stands, walks, or sneaks about, if he goes slinking away, if
he goes into his hiding-place; if two persons sit together and scheme,
king Varuna is there as a third, and knows it.  
3. Both this earth here belongs to king Varuna, and also yonder broad
sky whose boundaries are far away. Moreover these two oceans are the
loins of Varuna; yea, he is hidden in this small (drop of) water.  
4. He that should flee beyond the heaven far away would not be free from
king Varuna. His spies come hither (to the earth) from heaven, with a
thousand eyes do they watch over the earth.  
5. King Varuna sees through all that is between heaven and earth, and
all that is beyond. He has counted the winkings of men's eyes. As a
(winning) gamester puts down his dice, thus does he establish these
(laws).  
6. May all thy fateful toils which, seven by seven, threefold, lie
spread out, ensnare him that speaks falsehood: him that speaks the truth
they shall let go!  
7. With a hundred snares, O Varuna, surround him, let the liar not go
free from thee, O thou that observest men! The rogue shall sit, his
belly hanging loose, like a cask without hoops, bursting all about!  
8. With (the snare of) Varuna which is fastened lengthwise, and that
which (is fastened) broadwise, with the indigenous and the foreign, with
the divine and the human,--  
9. With all these snares do I fetter thee, O N. N., descended from N.
N., the son of the woman N. N.: all these do I design for thee.
