<p>1. Heaven and earth, the broad atmosphere, the goddess of the field, and the wonderful, far-striding (Vishnu); moreover, the broad atmosphere guarded by V&acirc;ta (the wind): may these here be inflamed, when I am inflamed!<br> 2. Hear this, O ye revered gods! Let Bharadv&acirc;ga recite for me songs of praise! 'May he who injures this our plan be bound in the fetter (of disease) and joined to misfortune!<br> 3. Hear, O soma-drinking Indra, what with burning heart I shout to thee! I cleave, as one cleaves a tree with an axe, him that injures this our plan.<br> 4. With (the aid of) thrice eighty siman-singers, with (the aid of) the &Acirc;dityas, Vasus, and Angiras--may our father's sacrifices and gifts to the priests, aid us-do I seize this one with fateful fervour.<br> 5. May heaven and earth look after me, may all the gods support me! O ye Angiras, O ye fathers devoted to Soma, may he who does harm enter into misfortune!<br> 6 . He who perchance despises us, O ye Maruts, he who abuses the holy practice which is beiog performed by us, may his evil deeds be firebrands to him, may the heavens surround with fire the hater of holy practices!<br> 7. Thy seven in-breathings and thy eight marrows, these do I cut for thee by means of my charm. Thou shalt go to the seat of Yama, fitly prepared, with Agni as thy guide!<br> 8. I set thy footstep upon the kindled fire. May Agni surround thy body, may thy voice enter into breath!</p>
