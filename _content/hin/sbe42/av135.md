# V.

# CHARMS PERTAINING TO ROYALTY (RÂGAKARMÂNI).

## IV, 8. Prayer at the consecration of a king.

1\. Himself prosperous (bhûto), he does put strength into the beings
(bhûteshu); he became the chief lord of the beings (bhûtânâm). To his
consecration death does come: may he, the king, favour this kingdom!  
2. Come forth hither-do not glance away-as a mighty guardian, slayer of
enemies! Step hither, thou who prosperest thy friends: the gods shall
bless thee!  
3. As he did step hither all (men) did attend him. Clothed in grace, he
moves, shining by his own lustre. This is the great name of the manly
Asura; endowed with every form (quality) he entered upon immortal
(deeds).  
4. Thyself a tiger, do thou upon this tiger-skin stride (victorious)
through the great regionst All the clans shall wish for thee, and the
heavenly waters, rich in sap!  
5. The heavenly waters, rich in sap, flow joyously, (and too) those in
the sky and upon the earth: with the lustre of all of these do I
sprinkle thee.  
6. They have sprinkled thee with their lustre., the heavenly waters rich
in sap. May Savitar thus fashion thee, that thou shalt prosper thy
friends!  
7. (The waters) thus embracing him, the tiger, promote him, the lion, to
great good fortune. Him, the leopard in the midst of the waters, as
though standing in the ocean, the beneficent (floods, or the vigorous
priests) cleanse thoroughly!
