</p>  <h2 align="center">II, 26. Charm for the prosperity of cattle.</h2>  
<p>1. Hither shall come the cattle which have strayed to a distance, whose companionship V&acirc;yu (the wind) enjoys! (The cattle) whose structure of form Tvashtar knows, Savitar shall hold in place in this stable!<br> 2. To this stable the cattle shall flow together, Brihaspati skilfully shall conduct them hither! S&icirc;n&icirc;v&acirc;l&icirc; shall conduct hither their van: do thou, O Anumati, hold them in place after they have arrived!<br> 3. May the cattle, may the horses, and may the domestics flow together; may the increase of the grain flow together! I sacrifice with an oblation that causeth to flow together!<br> 4. I pour together the milk of the cows, I pour together strength and sap with the ghee. Poured together shall be our heroes, constant shall be the cows with me the owner of the cows!<br> 5. I bring hither the milk of the cows, I have brought hither the sap of the grain. Brought hither are our heroes, brought hither to this house are our wives.</p>
