</p>  <h2 align="center">XX, 127. A kunt&acirc;pa-hymn.</h2>  <h3 align="center" align="center">A.</h3>  
<p>1. Listen, ye folks, to this: (a song) in praise of a hero shall be sung! Six thousand and ninety (cows) did we get (when we were) with Kaurama among the Rusamas,--<br> 2. Whose twice ten buffaloes move right along, touether with their cows; the height of his chariot just misses the heaven which recedes from its touch.<br> 3. This one (Kaurama) presented the seer with a hundred jewels, ten chaplets, three hundred steeds, and ten thousand cattle.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">B.</h3>  
<p>4. Disport thyself, O chanter, disport thyself as a bird upon a flowering tree; thy tongue glides quickly over the lips as a razor over the strop.<br> 5. The chanters with their pious song hurry on blithely as cows; at home are their children, and at home the cows do they attend.<br> 6. Bring hither, O chanter, thy poem, that which earns cattle and earns good things! Among the gods (kings) place thy voice as a manly archer his arrow!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">C.</h3>  
<p>7. Listen ye to the high praise of the king who rules over all peoples, the god who is above mortals, of Vaisv&acirc;nara Parikshit!<br> 8. 'Parikshit has procured for us a secure dwelling when he, the most excellent one, weat to his seat.' (Thus) the husband in Kuru-land, when he founds his household, converses with his wife.<br> 9. 'What may I bring to thee, curds, stirred drink, or liquor?' (Thus) I the wife asks her husband in the kingdom of king Parikshit.<br> 10. Like light the ripe barley runs over beyond the mouth (of the vessels). The people thrive merrily in the kingdom of king Parikshit.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">D.</h3>  
<p>11. Indra has awakened the poet, saying: 'Arise, move about, and sing; of me, the strong, verily, sing the praises; full every pious one shall offer thee (sacrificial reward)!'<br> 12. Here, O cattle, ye shall be born, here, ye horses, here, ye domestics! And P&ucirc;shan also, who bestows a thousand (cows) as sacrificial reward, settles down here.<br> 13. May these cattle, O Indra, not suffer harm, and may their owner not suffer harm; may the hostile folk, O Indra, may the thief not gain possession of them!<br> 14. We shout to the hero with hymn and song we (shout) with a pleasing song. Take delight in our songs; may we not ever suffer harm!</p>
