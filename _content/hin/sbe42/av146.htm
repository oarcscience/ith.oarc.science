</p>  <h2 align="center">III, 2. Battle-charm for confusing the enemy.</h2>  
<p>1. Agni, our skilful vanguard, shall attack, burning, against their schemes and hostile plans! G&acirc;tavedas shall bewilder the plans of the enemy, and deprive them (of the use) of their hands!<br> 2. This fire has confused the schemes that are in your mind; it shall blow you from your home, blow you away from everywhere!<br> 3. O Indra, bewildering their schemes, come hither with thy (own) plan: with the impact of the fire and the wind scatter them to either side!<br> 4. O ye plans of theirs, fly ye away; O ye schemes, be ye confused! Moreover, what now is in their mind, do thou drive that out of them!<br> 5. Do thou, O (goddess) Apvi, confusing their plans, go forth (to them), and seize their limbs! Attack them, burn with flames into their hearts; strike the enemy with fits, (strike our) opponents with darkness!<br> 6. That army yonder o( the enemy, that comes against us fighting with might, do ye, O Maruts, strike with planless darkness, that one of them shall not know the other!</p>
