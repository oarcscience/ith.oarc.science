</p>  <h2 align="center">VI, 71. Brahmanical prayer at the receipt of gifts.</h2>  
<p>1. The varied food which I consume in many places, my gold, my horses, and, too, my cows, goats, and sheep: everything whatsoever that I have received as a gift--may Agni, the priest, render that an auspicious offering!<br> 2. The gift that has come to me by sacrifice, or without sacrifice, bestowed by the Fathers, granted by men, through which my heart, as it were, lights up with joy--may Agni, the priest, render that an auspicious offering!<br> 3. The food that I, O gods, improperly consume, (the food) I promise, intending to give of it (to the Brahmans), or not to give of it, by the might of mighty Vaisv&acirc;nara (Agni) may (that) food be for me auspicious and full of honey!</p>
