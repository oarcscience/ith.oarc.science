## VI, 59. Prayer to the plant arundhatî for protection to cattle.

1\. Thy foremost protection, O Arundhatî, do thou bestow upon steer and
milch-kine, upon (cattle of) the age when weaned from their mother, upon
(all) four-footed creatures!  
2. May Arundhatî, the herb, bestow protection along with the gods,
render full of sap the stable, free from disease our men!  
3. The variegated, lovely, life-giving (plant) do I invoke. May she
carry away for us, far from the cattle, the missile hurled by Rudra!
