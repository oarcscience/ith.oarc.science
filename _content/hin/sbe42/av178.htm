</p>  <h2 align="center">IV, 38. A. Prayer for success in gambling.</h2>  
<p>1. The successful, victorious, skilfully gaming Apsar&acirc;, that Apsar&acirc; who makes the winnings in the game of dice, do I call hither.<br> 2. The skilfully gaming Apsar&acirc; who sweeps and heaps up (the stakes), that Apsar&acirc; who takes the winnings in the game of dice, do I call hither.<br> May she, who dances about with the dice, when she takes the stakes from the game of dice, when she desires to win for us, obtain the advantage by (her) magic! May she come to us full of abundance! Let them not win this wealth of ours!<br> 4. The (Apsar&acirc;s) who rejoice in dice, who carry grief and wrath-tbat joyful and exulting Apsar&acirc;, do I call hither.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">B. Prayer to secure the return of calves that have strayed to a distance.</h3>  
<p>5. They (the cattle) who wander along the rays of the sun, or they who wander along the flood of light) they whose bull (the. sun), full of strength, from afar protecting, with the day wanders about all the worlds-may he (the bull), full of strength, delighting in this offering, come to us touether with the atmosphere!<br> 6. Together with the atmosphere, O thou who art full of strength, protect the white (kark&icirc;) calf, O thou swift steed (the sun)! Here are many drops (of ghee) for thee; come hither! May this white calf (kark&icirc;) of thine, may thy mind, be here!<br> 7. Together with the atmosphere, O thou who art full of strength, protect the white (kark&icirc;) calf, O thou swift steed (the sun)! Here is the fodder, here the stall, here do we tie down the calf. Whatever (are your) names, we own you. Hail!</p>
