</p>  <h2 align="center">X, 3. Praise of the virtues of an amulet derived from the varana-tree.</h2>  
<p>1. Here is my varana-amulet, a bull that destroys the rivals: with it do thou close in upon thy enemies, crush them that desire to injure thee!<br> 2. Break them, crush them, close in upon them: the amulet shall be thy vanguard in front! With the varana the Devas (gods) did ward off (av&acirc;rayanta) the onslaught of the Asuras (demons) day after day.<br> 3, This thousand-eyed, yellow, golden varanaamulet is a universal cure; it shall lay low thy enemies: be thou the first to injure those that hate thee!<br> 4. This varana will ward off (v&acirc;rayishyate) the spell that has been spread against thee; this will protect thee from human danger, this will protect thee from all evil!<br> 5. This divine tree, the varana, shall shut out (v&acirc;ray&acirc;t&acirc;i)! The gods, too, have shutout (avivaran) the disease that has entered into this (man).<br> 6. If when asleep thou shalt behold an evil dream; as often as a wild beast shall run an inauspicious course; from (ominous) sneezing, and from the evil shriek of a bird, this varana-amulet will protect thee (v&acirc;rayishyate).<br> 7. From Ar&acirc;ti (grudge), Nirriti (misfortune), from sorcery, and from danger; from death and overstrong weapons the varana will protect thee.<br> 8. The sin that my mother, that my father, that my brothers and my sister have committed; the sin that we (ourselves) have committed, from that this divine tree will protect us.<br> 9. Through the varana are confused my enemies and my (rival) kin. To untraversed gloom they have gone: they shall go to the nethermost darkness!<br> 10. (May) I (be) unharmed, with cows unharmed, long-lived, with undiminished men! This varana-amulet shall guard me in every region (of space)!<br> 11. This varana upon my breast, the kingly, divine tree, shall smite asunder my enemies, as Indra the Dasyus, the Asuras (demons)!<br> 12. Long-lived, a hundred autumns old, do I wear this varana: kingdom and rule, cattle and strength, this shall bestow upon me!<br> 13. As the wind breaks with might the trees, the lords of the forest, thus do thou break my rivals, those formerly born, and the latter born! The varana shall watch over thee!<br> 14. As the wind and the fire consume the trees, the lords of the forest, thus, do thou consume my rivals, those formerly born, and the latter born! The varana shall watch over thee!<br> 15. As, ruined by the wind, the trees lie prostrate, thus do thou ruin and prostrate my rivals, those formerly born, and the latter born! The varana shall watch over thee!<br> 16. Do thou cut off, O varana, before their appointed time and before old age, those that aim to injure him in his cattle, and threaten his sovereignty!<br> 17. As the sun is resplendent, as in him brilliance has been deposited, thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast for me reputation and prosperity, shall sprinkle me with brilliance, and anoint me with splendour!<br> 18. As splendour is in the moon, and in the sun, the beholder of men, thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &amp;c.<br> 19. As splendour is in the earth, as in this G&acirc;tavedas (the fire), thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &amp;c.<br> 20. As splendour is in the maiden, as in this appointed chariot, thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &amp;c.<br> 21. As splendour is in the soma-draught, as splendour is in the honey-mixture (for guests), thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &amp;c.<br> 22. As splendour is in the agnihotra-oblation, as splendour is in the call vashat, thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &amp;c.<br> 23. As splendour is in the sacrificer, as (splendour) has been deposited in the sacrifice, thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &amp;c.<br> 24. As splendour is in Prag&acirc;pati, as in this Parameshthin (the lord on high), thus shall the amulet of varana hold fast, &amp;c.<br> 25. As immortality is in the gods, as truth has been deposited in them, thus shall the amulet of varana hod fast, &amp;c.</p>
