## III, 5. Praise of an amulet derived from the parna-tree, designed to strengthen royal power.

1\. Hither hath come this amulet of parna-wood, with its might mightily
crushing the enemy. (It is) the strength of the gods, the sap of the
waters: may it assiduously enliven me with energy!  
2. The power to rule thou shalt hold fast in me, O amulet of parna-wood;
wealth (thou shalt hold fast) in me! May I, rooted in the domain of
royalty, become the chief!  
3. Their very own amulet which the gods deposited secretly in the tree,
that the gods shall give us to wear, together with life!  
4. The parna has come hither as the mighty strength of the soma, given
by Indra, instructed by Varuna. May I, shining brilliantly, wear it,
unto long life, during a hundred autumns!  
5. The amulet of parna-wood has ascended upon me unto complete exemption
from injury, that I may rise superior (even) to friends and alliances!  
6. The skilful builders of chariots, and the ingenious workers of metal,
the folk about me all, do thou, O parna, make my aids!  
7. The kings who (themselves) make kings, the charioteers, and leaders
of hosts, the folk about me all, do thou, O parna, make my aids!  
8. Thou art the body-protecting parna, a 'liero, brother of me, the
hero. Along with the brilliancy of the year do I fasten thee on, O
amulet!
