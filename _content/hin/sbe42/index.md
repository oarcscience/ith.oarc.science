# Hymns of the Atharva-Veda

###### translated by

## Maurice Bloomfield

#### Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 42

#### \[1897\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This, the 42nd volume of the the Sacred Books of the East, is an
anthology of representative hymns from the Arthrva-veda, the fourth
Veda. This selection is grouped thematically, so the hymns are not in
numeric order.

This etext, which was one of the early additions to Intangible Textual
Heritage, was originally prepared in July 2000; for a variety of reasons
I had to leave out most of the introduction and all of the footnotes.
All of the body text of this book is in the etext, however. This etext
was revised in November 2004; changes included a number of typographic
corrections, and breaking the etext down into chapters. The original,
one-file version of this etext (without the corrections) is still online
[here](../av) (*348,392 bytes*).
