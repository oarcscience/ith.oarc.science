</p>  <h2 align="center">V, 23. Charm against worms in children.</h2>  
<p>1. I have called upon heaven and earth, I have called upon the goddess Sarasvat&icirc;, I have called upon Indra and Agni: 'they shall crush the worm,' (I said).<br> 2. Slay the worms in this boy, O Indra, lord of treasures! Slain are all the evil powers by my fierce imprecation!<br> 3. Him that moves about in the eyes, that moves about in the nose, that gets to the middle of the teeth, that worm do we crush.<br> 4. The two of like colour, the two of different colour; the two black ones, and the two red ones; the brown one, and the brown-eared one; the (one like a) vulture, and the (one like a) cuckoo, are slain.<br> 5. The worms with white shoulders, the black ones with white arms, and all those that are variegated, these worms do we crush.<br> 6. In the east rises the sun, seen by all, slaying that which is not seen; slaying the seen and the unseen (worms), and grinding to pieces all the worms.<br> 7. The yev&acirc;sha and the kashkasha, the egatka, and the sipavitnuka--the seen worm shall be slain, moreover the unseen shall be slain!<br> 8. Slain of the worms is the yev&acirc;sha, slain further is the nadaniman; all have I crushed down like lentils with a mill-stone.<br> 9. The worm with three heads and the one with three skulls, the speckled, and the white--I crush his ribs and I tear off his head.<br> 10. Like Atri, like Kanva, and like Gamadagni do I slay you, ye worms! With the incantation of Agastya do I crush the worms to pieces.<br> 11. Slain is the king of the worms, and their viceroy also is slain. Slain is the worm, with him his mother slain, his brother slain, his sister slain.<br> 12. Slain are they who are inmates with him, slain are his neighbours; moreover all the quite tiny worms are slain.<br> 13. Of all the male worms, and of all the female worms do I split the heads with the stone, I burn their faces with fire.</p>
