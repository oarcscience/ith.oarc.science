</p>  <h2 align="center">I, 11. Charm for easy parturition.</h2>  
<p>1. Aryaman as active hotar-priest shall utter for thee the vashat-call at this (soma-) pressing, O P&ucirc;shan! May (this) woman, (herself) begotten in<br> the proper way, be delivered, may her joints relax, that she shall bring forth!<br> 2. Four directions has the heaven, and also four the earth: (from these) the gods created the embryo. May they open her, that she shall bring forth!<br> 3. May S&ucirc;shan open: her womb do we cause to gape. Do thou, O S&ucirc;shan, loosen the womb, do thou, O Bishkal&acirc;, let go (the ernbryo)!<br> 4. Attached not at all to the flesh, nor to the fat, not at all to the marrow, may the splotched, moist, placenta come down to be eaten by a dog! May the placenta fall down!<br> 5. I split open thy vagina, thy womb, thy canals; I separate the mother and the son, the child along with the placenta. May the placenta fall down!<br> 6. As flies the wind, as flies the mind, as fly the winged birds, so do thou, O embryo,. ten months old, fall along with the placenta! May the placenta fall down!</p>
