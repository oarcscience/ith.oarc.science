## II, 3. Charm against excessive discharges from the body, undertaken with spring-water.

1\. The spring-water yonder which runs down upon the mountain, that do I
render healing for thee, in order that thou mayest contain a potent
remedy.  
2. Then surely, yea quite surely, of the hundred remedies contained in
thee, thou art the most superior in checking discharges and removing
pain.  
3. Deep down do the Asuras bury this great healer of wounds: that is the
cure for discharges, and thal hath removed disease.  
4. The ants bring the remedy from the sea: that is the cure for
discharges, and that hath quieted disease.  
5. This great healer of wounds has been gotten out of the earth: that is
the cure for discharges, and  
that hath removed disease.  
6. May the waters afford us welfare, may the herbs be propitious to us I
Indra's bolt shall beat off the Rakshas, far (from us) shall fly the
arrows cast by the Rakshas!
