## VI, 110. Expiatory charm for a child born under an unlucky star.

1\. Of yore, (O Agni), thou wast worthy of supplication at the
sacrifice; thou wast the priest in olden times, and now anew shalt sit
(at our sacrifice)! Delight, O Agni, thy own body, and, sacrificing,
bring good fortune here to us!  
2. Him that hath been born under the (constellation) gyeshihaghnî ('she
that slays the oldest'), or under the vikritâu ('they that uproot'),
save thou from being torn up by the root by Yama (death)! May be (Agni)
guide him across all misfortunes to long life, to a life of a hundred
autumns!  
3. On a tiger (-like) day the hero was born; born under a (good)
constellation he becometh a mighty hero. Let him not slay, when he grows
up, his father, let him not injure the mother that hath begotten him!
