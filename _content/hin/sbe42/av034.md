## I, 17. Charm to stop the flow of blood.

1\. The maidens that go yonder, the veins, clothed in red garments, like
sisters without a brother, bereft of strength, they shall stand still!  
2. Stand still, thou lower one, stand still, thou higher one; do thou in
the middle also stand still! The most tiny (vein) stands still: may then
the great artery also stand still!  
Of the hundred arteries, and the thousand veins, those in the middle
here have indeed stood still. At the same time the ends have ceased (to
flow).  
4. Around you has passed a great sandy dike: stand ye still, pray take
your case!
