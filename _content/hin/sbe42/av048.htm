</p>  <h2 align="center">IV, 4. Charm to promote virility.</h2>  
<p>1. Thee, the plant, which the Gandharva dug up for Varuna, when his virility had decayed, thee, that causest strength[1], we dig up.<br> 2. Ushas (Aurora), S&ucirc;rya, (the sun), and this charm of mine; the bull Prag&acirc;pati (the lord of creatures) shall with his lusty fire arouse him!<br> 3. This herb shall make thee so very full of lusty strength, that thou shalt, when thou art excited, exhale heat as a thing on fire!<br> 4. The fire of the plants, and the essence of the bulls shall arouse him! Do thou, O Indra, controller of bodies, place the lusty force of men into this person!<br> 5. Thou (O herb) art the first-born sap of the waters and also of the plants. Moreover thou art the brother of Soma, and the lusty force of the antelope buck!<br> 6. Now, O Agni, now, O Savitar, now, O goddess Sarasvat&icirc;, now, O Brahmanaspati, do thou stiffen the pasas as a bow!<br> 7. I stiffen thy pasas as a bowstring upon the bow. Embrace thou (women) as the antelope buck the gazelle with ever unfailing (strength)!<br> 8. The strength of the horse, the mule, the goat and the ram, moreover the strength of the bull bestow upon him, O controller of bodies (Indra)!</p>  
<p>[1. The original, more drastically, sepaharshan&icirc;m. By a few changes and omissions in stanzas 3, 6, and 7 the direct simplicity of the original has been similarly veiled.]</p>
