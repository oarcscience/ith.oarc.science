</p>  <h2 align="center">IV, 6. Charm against demons (pis&acirc;ka) conceived as the cause of disease.</h2>  
<p>1. May Agni Vaisv&acirc;nara, the bull of unfailing strength, burn up him that is evil-disposed, and desires to harm us, and him that plans hostile deeds against us!<br> 2. Between the two rows of teeth of Agni Vaisv&acirc;nara do I place him that plans to injure us, when we are not planning to injure him; and him that plans to injure us, when we do plan to injure him.<br> Those who hound us in our chambers, while shouting goes on in the night of the new moon, and the other flesh-devourers who plan to injure us, all of them do I overcome with might.<br> 4. With might I overcome the Pis&acirc;kas, rob them of their property; all evil-disposed (demons) do I slay: may my device succeed!<br> 5. With the gods who vie with, and measure their swiftness with this sun, with those that are in the rivers, and in the mountains, do I, along with my cattle, consort.<br> 6. I plague the Pis&acirc;kas as the tiger the cattle-owners. As dogs who have seen a lion, these do not find a refuge.<br> 7. My strength does not lie with Pis&acirc;kas, nor with thieves, nor with prowlers in the forest. From the village which I enter the Pis&acirc;kas vanish away.<br> 8. From the village which my fierce power has entered the Pis&acirc;kas vanish away; they do not devise evil.<br> 9. They who irritate me with their jabber, as (buzzing) mosquitoes the elephant, them I regard as wretched (creatures), as small vermin upon people.<br> 10. May Nirriti (the goddess of destruction) take hold of this one, as a horse with the halter! The fool who is wroth with me is not freed from (her) snare.</p>
