## VI, 27. Charm against pigeons regarded as ominous birds.

1\. O ye gods, if the pigeon, despatched as the messenger of Nirriti
(the goddess of destruction), hath come here seeking (us out), we shall
sing his praises, and prepare (our) ransom. May our two-footed and
four-footed creatures be prosperous!  
2. Auspicious to us shall be the pigeon that has been despatched;
harmless, ye gods, the bird shall be to our house! The sage Agni shall
verily take pleasure in our oblation; the winged missile shall avoid
us!  
3. The winged missile shall not do us injury: upon our hearth, our
fireplace he (the pigeon) takes his steps! Propitious he shall be to our
cattle and  
our domestics; may not, ye gods, the pigeon here do harm to us!
