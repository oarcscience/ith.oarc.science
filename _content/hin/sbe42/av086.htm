</p>  <h2 align="center">IV, 19. Mystic power of the ap&acirc;m&acirc;rga-plant, against demons and sorcerers.</h2>  
<p>1. On the one hand thou deprivest of kin, on the other thou now procurest kinfolk. Do thou, moreover, cut the offspring of him that practises spells, as a reed that springs up in the rain!<br> 2. By a Br&acirc;hmana thou hast been blest, by Kanva, the descendant of Nrishad. Thou goest like a stronor army; where thou hast arrived, O plant, there there is no fear.<br> 3. Thou goest at the head of the plants, spreading lustre, as if with a light. Thou art on the one hand the protector of the weak, on the other the slayer of the Rakshas.<br> 4. When of yore, in the beginning, the gods drove out the Asuras with thee, then, O plant, thou wast begotten as ap&acirc;m&acirc;rga ('wiping out').<br> 5. Thou cuttest to pieces (vibhindat&icirc;), and hast a hundred branches; vibhindant ('cutting to pieces') is thy father's name. Do thou (turn) against, and cut to pieces (vi bhindhi) him that is hostile towards us!<br> 6. Non-being arose from the earth, that goes to heaven, (as) a great expansion. Thence, verily, that, spreading vapours, shall turn against the performer (of spells)!<br> 7. Thou didst grow backward, thou hast fruit which is turned backward. Ward off from me all curses, ward off very far destructive weapons!<br> 8. Protect me with a hundredfold, guard me with a thousandfold (strength)! Indra, the strong, shall put strength into thee, O prince of plants!</p>
