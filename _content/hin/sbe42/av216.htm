</p>  <h2 align="center">IX, 1. Hymn to the honey-lash of the Asvins.</h2>  
<p>1. From heaven, from earth, from the atmosphere, from the sea, from the fire, and from the wind, the honey-lash hath verily sprung. This, clothed in amrita (ambrosia), all the creatures revering, acclaim in their hearts.<br> 2. Great sap of all forms (colours) it hath-they call thee moreover the seed of the ocean. Where the honey-lash comes bestowing gifts, there life's breath, and there immortality has settled down.<br> 3. Men severally, contemplating it profoundly, behold its action upon the earth: from the fire and from the wind the honey-lash hath verily sprung, the strong child of the Maruts.<br> 4. Mother of the &Acirc;dityas, daughter of the Vasus, breath of life of created beings, nave of immortality, the honey-lash, golden-coloured, dripping ghee, as a great embryo, moves among mortals.<br> 5. The god's begot the lash of honey, from it came an embryo having all forms (colours). This, as soon as born, (while yet) young its mother nourishes; this, as soon as born, surveys all the worlds.<br> 6. Who knows it and who perceives it, the inexhaustible, soma-holding cup that has come from the heart of it (the honey-lash)? 'Tis the wise priest: he shall derive inspiration from it!<br> 7. He knows them, and he perceives them, the inexhaustible breasts of it (the honey-lash), that yield a thousand streams. Nourishment they pour out -without recalcitration.<br> 8. The great (cow) that loudly gives forth the sound 'him,' that bestows strength, and goes with loud shouts to the holy act, bellowing with lust for the three (male) gharmas (fires), she lows, and drips with (streams) of milk.<br> 9. When the waters, the mighty bulls, self-sovereign, wait upon (the cow), swollen with milk, (then) they, the waters, pour nourishment (upon her), and cause her to pour nourishment at will for him that knoweth this.<br> 10. The thunder is thy voice, O Prag&acirc;pati; as a bull thou hurlest thy fire upon the earth. From the fire, and from the wind the honey-lash hath verily sprung, the strong child of the Maruts.<br> 11. As the soma at the morn ing-pressure is dear to the Asvins, thus in my own person, O Asvins, lustre shall be sustained!<br> 12. As the soma at the second (mid-day) pressure is dear to Indra and Agni, thus in my own person, O Indra, and Agni, lustre shall be sustained!<br> 13. As the soma at the third pressure (evening) is dear to the Ribhus, thus in my own person, O Ribhus, lustre shall be sustained!<br> 14. May I beget honey for myself; may I obtain honey for myself! Bringing milk, O Agni, I have come:. endow me with lustre!<br> 15. Endow me, O Agni, with lustre, endow me with offspring and with life! May the gods take note of this (prayer) of mine; may Indra together with the Rishis (take note of it)!<br> 16. As bees carry together honey upon honey, thus in my own person, O Asvins, lustre shall be sustained!<br> 17. As the bees pile this honey upon honey, thus in my own person, O Asvins, lustre, brilliance, strength, and force shall be sustained!<br> 18. The honey that is in the mountains, in the heights; in the cows, and in the horses; the honey which is in the sur&acirc; (brandy) as it is being poured out, that shall be in me!<br> 19. O Asvins, lords of brightness, anoint me with the honey of the bee, that I may speak forceful speech among men!<br> 20. The thunder is thy speech, O Prag&acirc;pati; as a bull thou hurlest thy fire upon earth and heaven. All animals live upon it (the earth), and she with it (Prag&acirc;pati's fire) fills nourishment and food.<br> 21. The earth is the staff, the atmosphere the embryo, the heaven the whip (itself?), the lightning the whip-cord; of gold is the tip (of the whip?).<br> 22. He that knoweth the seven honies of the whip becomes rich in honey; (to wit), the Br&acirc;hmana, the king, the cow, the ox, rice, barley, and honey as the seventh.<br> 23. Rich in honey becomes he, rich in honey become his appurtenances, worlds rich in honey does he win, he that knoweth thus.<br> 24. When in a bright sky it thunders, then Prag&acirc;pati manifests himself to (his) creatures (prag&acirc;h). Therefore do I stand with the sacred cord suspended from the right shoulder (pr&acirc;kinopavita), saying, 'O Prag&acirc;pati, watch over me!' The creatures (prag&acirc;h) watch over him, Prag&acirc;pati watches over him, that knoweth thus.</p>  </div>  </BODY>
